"Shall we?"
"Th-thanks Gabriel," Cas said roughly.
The bar wasn't even open yet, but Ellen and Jo were loading fridges and prepping appetizers for the evening crowd.
"Nice," Dean nodded smiling, his eyes roaming all over him. "My first day back too," he admitted.
"Maybe not for an angel."
Dean pulled back slightly and when Cas opened his eyes, green eyes were scanning his own.
"Only his legal guardian-"
Castiel rolled his eyes and kissed him pushing him onto the bed.
Cas felt his heart skip a beat under his green eyed gaze. He almost wished he had been making it up.
"No, that's his sister, Amara. She died when I was little."
“Send him to Heaven,” The order is clear. Jimmy sets his features into a warm smile and opened the door. Dean Winchester stands there in a light green button up shirt that brings out his eyes over a black tee shirt, a nervous smile and a bunch of flowers. Jimmy feels something stir inside him that he had never felt before.
"Nothing much, just made an impression last night with our boy Abel, thought I'd get to know you strangers. Also I heard from Singer and your car will be out of commission for awhile. He didn't want you boys thinking you'd be out of here anytime soon."
"I am a connoisseur of beauty. I mean, look at me!" Cas couldn’t help the small smile that curled his lips for a moment at his brother’s ridiculous sense of humor.
He was his feet I a second turning towards him, gun in hand and ready for a fight.
"You," he cleared his throat, "you like him?"
He is surrounded by black water. Hands are pulling him down and down. He can't breathe. He flails his arms and kicks his legs but he can't find his way to the surface. Arms hold him tight from behind. He had to get to his brother. He had to-
"Well, I doubt very much you want to go to the ball dressed like that."
Out of the closest cop car stepped a large man with a balding head, aviator sun glasses, polished badge and gun at his side all winking menacingly in the sun.
“He’s already there. He landed last night.” The words came out of him unbidden. His team all stared at him perplexed.
“I just treat you with respect. Is that so out of your normal life that you don’t recognize it?”
"You love it." She was too self-satisfied and he decided to go back to the watching the action.
She found a splash of water left in the pitcher and drank it down instead of using it for a much needed cleaning. Then she turned to her stand mirror and looked herself over.
"Oh, I'm doing well, sir." Cas swallowed nervously as Bobby stepped back.
Gabe gave Dean a speculative look. “There’s nothing wrong with him. He just doesn’t want to face reality yet.”
This was the last straw, Uriel loses all pretense of civility, “What’s he doing here, this is-” Naomi cuts him off with a wave of her hand.
"Uh, Thank you...for saving me," Dean seemed to have to force the words out.
Then he removed his apron and stepped out from behind the bar to follow the waiting woman. Sancho watched downing this drink like the others and thinking hard.
His future wife. He looked up at Charlie, who gave him a little wave with her hand that wasn't obviously attached to a broken arm.
"Why are you bringing me here?" He asked Crowley, who had been waiting in the carriage for her.
Dean grinned, and held out his hands for the keys he knew Sam would be throwing his way.
Dean looked around him at the three dead demons scattered about the small courtyard, shaking off the emotions Castiel had left in him. "Better than them," Dean snarked, indicating the three dead demons, but really still looking into the darkness where his angel had run. "You two get the other one?"
Castiel smiled back, it was a tight smile that he didn't feel he still missed his father something fierce. These little reminders of him hurt, but they also felt like a benediction. Wherever his father was, he hoped he would come back soon. His brothers were flailing without his guidance and firm hand.
"From last time. Yes. Why would I forget?"
"Why don't we stop this charade, Nick?" He said. We have your little gang surrounded. Give us the boy and let's put an end to this suffering."
“I guess I better figure out what to say…” him and his useless words.
Cas followed a second behind, embarrassed and tired.
"Here-ye, here-ye. By order of his Majesty Dean the first," he began his highly trained voice reaching out well above the bustle, Cas quickened his pace and hurried to see what the announcement was all about.
They had no hope of catching her, and the door guards had been pulled to the garden so she ran out of the castle unhindered. Down the outside stairs she went. As she crossed the pentagram she heard more voices behind her and as she turned to look her foot pulled out of her slipper. She paused to go back and get the fallen slipper, but saw two guards coming from the left path and just kept running, half hobbled as she limped down the stairs. She silently thanked her siblings for all the years they had chased her up and down the stairs.
The town was a bustle with activity, it was the first truly nice day in over two weeks and some of the first big harvests of the spring were coming in. Women were out in spectacular finery to show off, Castiel studied the dress of a woman and her three daughters. They were obviously the latest import from Paris and he was filled with envy.
"What other stuff?" Sam asked.
Something in the sky caught their eyes and they all turned to look up. At first Dean thought the fireworks had started early, but the light in the sky was an odd shade of yellow and didn’t make any noise as it streaked across the sky. Dean startled as he recognized  what he was seeing. A falling angel. He would bet his life on it.
Gabe had retreated inside himself.
"Just...do your best." He then told him where to take the sword and hide it once he had it in his possession and how to let him know it was there. Then the man pushed him out of his carraige and clicked his horses and rode away.
And from there the conversation flowed easily. Somehow Dean managed to get two more “free” drinks into him as they chatted.
"Dean!" Cas squeaked out, and Dean slid off his cock to look up at the angel. He was a wreck, a hand in his own hair, which was a mess. His eyes flashed at him, and Dean back up laying himself down as the angel lowered himself down over him. His now slick cock sliding up next to Dean's. Dean moaned out as the full hot weight of him covered his body, the sudden pressure and feel of that smooth, hard, wet cock next to his own causing him to have to breath deeply to calm down. Castiel nuzzled his neck his hand sliding up his sides and his hips bucked into him. The feel of his dry cock sliding against the one he had made wet was it's own kind of exquisite torture.
“That you turning up is my favorite part of any case.”
Gabe actually looked startled by this revelation. “I mean I haven't checked…”
“Right,” Cas said, feeling strangely out of breath at the thought of this man, Dean, and pleasure in the same sentence. “Thank you, Dean.”
Cas stared at his feet. "I stay out of their stupid arguments. But if I had known...Dean, will you please tell me what happened to you?"
The man lowered his odd thin blade, looking down at the corpse before him.
It felt magical. Castiel loved being in gowns and pretending he was a woman. In fact, more and more the dresses stayed on well after the act was done. He started to wear his hair differently, and to choose more feminine clothes from the many costumes he borrowed during the day. Every day he looked in the mirror and saw the person he wanted to be. The woman he wanted to be.
“Well I killed that sonafabitch, so are we done?”
She didn't let the tears start. Not with them watching. As soon as they were out the door she ran into the kitchen and out into stable yard behind the house. She ran until she came to the central fountain throwing herself on the ground where she finally let the tears flow.
Time seemed to stand still as he looked down on the man. An angel, he thought.
the attack and stepped back out of range easily.
“And why would you do that?” Jo asked, exasperated. “Or should I ask how cute she is?”
"Dean leaned over him to get a look at the place. "This it?"
Still he managed to get his companion half way out of the water and his arm out from under the idiot in only a few tortuous minutes. They both lay there coughing for an interminable minute. Castiel managed to turn him so he could cough the water out of his lungs. They both lay there, panting, Castiel's arm around him as they both breathed in and out heavily. Once the man's breath slowed to a more normal pace Castiel pushed himself up and sat, knees to his chest, forehead pressed into his bare knees, muddy, exhausted and freezing. He sat there for a moment running his shaking icy hands through his hair. He looked down at the man, he was breathing heavy, but less so, his eyes popped open like a dead fish. Everything had a pale unearthly glow since the stars and a bare sliver of moon were the only light source out here.
He had to be doing something wrong.
Sometimes Dean felt like a complete idiot, the truth hit him so hard. He had been so caught up in the romantic possibilities he had completely missed the point. This was why Charlie had agreed to stay. Why she hadn't been as cold as he had been warned and why she still wanted an alliance. She couldn't marry Jo. But she could marry him and stay in the Winchester Castle with him and have Jo at her side.
Clenching his fists he took a deep breath, feeling something in his chest loosen. Maybe if he was honest with himself he wasn't mad at Cas for asking questions about pumpkin carving he was mad at himself for trying so hard. Obviously the angel thought of him and his brother as his friends, but nothing more. How could he? He was an angel after all, again. He would never understand that sort of thing. Dean himself barely understood it. All he knew is that since he had been cured of being a demon, one thing had been clear. How he felt about Cas. Too bad it would always be one sided.
The door opened behind him and a gruff bearded man in a black suit was being dragged in by a tired looking Anais.  Naomi nods at the man who enters, “Major Singer.”
Dean looked over at Cas. "It wouldn't be the first time." He raised the dragonslayer to do just that, but Crowley held up a hand.
The three men stopped in their tracks.
"Oh, um Dean gave me the address at school awhile ago...I hadn't seen him in a couple weeks and..." Dean was looking sheepish and avoided looking at his uncle.
"Good luck, Cas," his golden eyes flashing as he handed over the goods.
"Dean?" A voice called out from somewhere, making Cas miss his shot spectacularly. Feeling like he'd been caught doing something he shouldn't be doing. An older man, short beard and a ratty looking trucker hat on his head came around the corner. He stopped when he spotted them. "Oh, I didn't realize you had company," Then he seemed to recognize him. "Wait, Castiel?"
The sound of a hammer hitting metal rang through the air. They changed their trajectory accordingly and came to a rusting shed behind a tall pile of car frames.
Dean looked into his eyes, hoping if he was honest that he was useless that he would let it drop. "Look, the two things. Fix cars and take care of Sammy."
"This isn't safe, Dean."
Dean came and lay down beside her, cradling her in his arms. They fell asleep that way, but only for a few minutes. The clock tower chimed out the time not ten minutes later, waking them. It was eleven. They stared into each others eyes as the last bell rang through the air.
A man stepped into the light, it took Sam a moment to place him, it was Cas's brother Michael. Lucifer's goons moved their weapons to train on him instead of Sam. Then another figure walked into the light, and another, Gabriel, Raphael. Then Castiel and...Dean. More men stepped out, men Sam didn't know until Lucifer and his gang were surrounded.
"You wanna grab a burger or something?"
But they were all visibly shaken. Dean waved his hand forward motioning everyone to the back of the lit room towards what turned out to be an actual wooden door with iron bound hinges. They all fell into position as Garth opened the door. The smell of sulfur and smoke blasted their senses, but the corridor was clear and they pushed their way forward into the dark.
“Hi. Uh, Jimmy.”
“Let’s make sure you don’t drown first, shall we?”  Cas replied, gliding back towards him easily.
Bobby came running outside looking wide eyed and bewildered. He looked even more concerned when he saw Cas carrying Dean.
Squinting, Castiel sat up, causing Dean to stir.
Castiel narrowed his eyes letting his knees go, and pushing himself up into a kneel.
No one else could hurt him with words quite as well, except maybe Sam, or his late father. 'Are you under the impression that family's supposed to make you feel good?', he heard Bobby's voice in his head. Family's supposed to make you miserable.
Charlie interrupted them both, "I want to go with you."
He wasn't 100% sure if it was the cold or nervousness at kissing Cas, but something made him start to shiver.
Sam looked at him like he thought there was nothing more idiotic than him at the moment. "As the prince of this realm and second in command of...everything in the kingdom, I object to sending the King on a hunting mission without properly trained backup."
"-Sam!" he calls out. His feet seemed to be on fire and he is under heavy hot sweat-sodden blankets.
He looked up at his brother, and suddenly realized his brother had actually been concerned.
Dean twisted his head around to look at Cas, he towered over him. He caught Castiel’s eye and they stared at each other as he pushed himself forward. Dean moved to meet him, letting the hard pressure open him up till he could feel Cas’s flush with him, his balls hanging over his taint.
“Well it is customary to grant the knight with a new name.”
Nothing was ever easy.  In fact sometimes is seemed the harder she tried, the more things went wrong. This time the problem wasn't so catastrophic as decimating heaven, but it still seemed as devastating in her own mind. All Castiel had wanted was to greet Deana with the perfect pie.  It had been months since she had seen her and it was something she knew the hunter would appreciate. So she had arrived at the bunker a bit early and got to work. She had calculated her reaction, she was smile and duck her head and laugh at her and all the past crap that had kept them apart this year would fade away behind her smile.
“Mechanic?” Cas asked, tilting his head.
“The Empty and I had a lot of alone time together. I asked.”
“Fastest,” Jimmy commands.
After awhile Castiel had acquired enough coin to purchase some used, but serviceable day clothes, and at night they dressed him up in ballgowns of every color.
"I appreciate you coming to the meet. I wasn't sure you would."
He shook his head. "Forever."
What did it matter? One didn't just watch another human in need drown when they could do something. He ran to the end of the dock, his feet slapping against the frosted wood, and made a perfect swan-dive into the fast moving river.
"To our ride."
Cas couldn’t help himself as he put a hand on Dean’s head and started to trust in and out of his mouth. He didn't even mind the occasional bite of teeth.
“Can’t we use the elevator?” Dean asked, the thought of running up twenty flights of stairs being a bit dubious. He wasn’t in that good of shape.
"I didn't know," Cas looks stricken and he reached a hand across the table laying it over Dean's. His hand was warm and a little bit greasy from all the burgers. Firm and gentle and uncalloused. Dean swallowed feeling like he had something stuck in his throat, but the panic was subsiding.
They both hear the door to the roof open.
They rode on in silence.
"They were hanging out to dry."
"Prison." Naomi said bluntly. So much for her overly diplomatic manner.
Dean frowned, wishing he could just start over. Sam shrugged. "Pumpkins?"
“Is that bacon?” He asked.
They stood there, the sound of the faucet running the only sound, staring into each others eyes while Castiel held his arm. Dean couldn’t help but imagine kissing those lips. Wanted nothing more than to be brave and close that distance.
“Actually I didn’t call you,” he said wryly.
"A demon," He finally stated, staring at the man at his feet as if curious more than confused.
Don Quixote, however had eyes only for one thing. The giant long haired waiter currently busing tables in the corner. In fact half of the bar seemed to be ogling the tall long haired man.
"Oh, yeah, I just had some groceries to carry in," Dean explained helplessly. He hadn't been expecting Cas yet. He had planned out how he was going to call the angel down when everything was all set up.  Now he felt foolish, and to add insult to injury, his mouth ran away from him though and added treacherously, "...and some pumpkins." He wasn't even sure why he thought this was a good idea. He was obviously not cut out for this shit.
He chuckled under his breath. The first feelings that weren't guilt despair and self recrimination he'd felt in days.
Crowley rolled his eyes, but marched forward forcing himself through the crack in the wall. Then he was stuck, and not from the tight space.
"Ah, but you cannot know his intentions, can you. He hurt you. What else matters."
"Dean," he felt odd not adding a title, he had been doing so his entire life. It felt nice to be just Dean for once.
"Listen Cas. Whatever this is...it isn't up to them. It isn't up to your Step father to decide who you want to be with. It's up to us."
Castiel sat next to him on the couch, not saying much, except to contradict everything that Gabriel told him. Dean was hyper aware of his leg against his, though at least they were now clothed, if a little haphazardly. Dean was only wearing a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt. Cas had a pair of loose jeans and a tank top, with his blanket wrapped around him still. Dean too had the wool still draped over his unhurt shoulder. They both had large thick socks on their still numb feet. The fire still cheerfully blazed in the fireplace, Balthazar tended it with mock enthusiasm and much snark.
Cas lead them out of the dining room and out into the foyer. And up a staircase with polished wood and gold flecked cream wallpaper. There was even a chandelier hanging from the ceiling.
“What is ‘Zork’?”
“Of course!”  Dean slipped his arm around his shoulders and steered him outside.  He started to head towards the stairs leading to his room, but Dean was heading towards the office. They disengaged.
Cas whipped his head around to stare at Dean. Looking from him to the portrait of his uncle and back to Dean. "That, umm, isn't Lucifer? Why would you call him that?" Cas asked, feeling like he's been doused in cold water.
Dean let out a low whistle. "Okay, I take it back, two houses is fine."
"Want some of mine?" He held the cup up invitingly.
And so their summer began.
From then on until Dean drove him home Sam stayed with them preventing him from telling him in confidence.
He had seen the man run by him from his perch in a tree where he had decided to eat his lunch of a couple hard boiled eggs. Grace had been busy munching some of the grass in the clearing and he had just been minding his own business grateful to be out from under his step family. The man had calmly crossed the clearing over, his sword ready and looking like a stalking cat when the boar had broken through the underbrush. He had witnessed the first pass and then the one where the foul beast had actually grazed his leg without the man getting even close to him. The man fought beautifully, it could have been a dance. But as soon as he had seen the hit he had dropped his lunch to the forest floor and jumped onto Grace without even bothering to re-saddle her. He had gotten there just in time. Surely the mans injuries could have been worse, if not deadly had he let the creature rend him.
“That’s good. Cause I am not funny,” Jimmy tells him.
Crowley chuckled, but didn't answer.
Castiel frowned and tried again.  Same result.
"Shit, I'm sorry!" Dean apologized brushing off his leg as if that would do anything helpful. The scalding hot was cooling rapidly.
“Yes, we are free.” Sam told her, more sure in his signing with the simpler phrase. Dean smiled and agreed, it seemed to put her at ease.
Dean stopped short to stare at his adviser and mentor as is he had gone mad, "A hiccup? Bobby our entire future rests on this working out, if they don't bail us out of this mess we are done."
Sam nodded, thinking. "So do think she will marry you?” Dean shrugged. “You still want to marry her?"
“Is it that time?” Chuck played along, looking at his wrist even though he wore no watch.
"This just reminded me of that night..." Dean trailed off, fidgeting, uncomfortable in the remembering.
Orienting himself he went to the corner of the building with the offices. A woman in a gray power suit with immaculately coiffed red hair sat waiting for him in the counselor's office. She gave him a tight official smile.
“Mr. Novak, and forgive my attire, I didn't have time to dress properly,” Cas said, ducking his head.
“Don Quixote de La Mancha, having proven yourself this day in terrible and glorious combat,” he struck a soft blow to one shoulder then lifted the blade up over Don Quixote’s other shoulder, “I hear-by dub thee, Knight.” And the blade landed on the other shoulder completing the ritual.
He held up his hands like a supplicant to take the hot chocolate and Dean carefully handed it over so it wouldn't spill. Lowering himself to the wood planks next to the blanketed man he sighed.
Cas glanced back over his shoulder watching a smaller wave crash, the water not even reaching his heels this time. "I came when you called." He said as he turned back around, holding his arms out to his sides.
It was abysmal. "This can't be right," Dean said, looking at her, shocked.
"Oh, Your Highness," Sam bowed his head as to an equal. Dean hastily sketched a similar bow.
"Oh yeah, Bobby has quite the collection of books. He may not look it, but the man is quite the scholar."
He does this every night after the others go to bed.
"He's your uncle," Dean was taking slow steps backward as if to get away from the portrait.
"A couple weeks, there's a lot of body work and a couple parts he'll need to ship in. He says you a should come by the junkyard when you can."
“But I can fix it.” Jimmy intoned, before he could continue. Damn right he could fix it. And without a stupid Hunter doing wet work. This mission required subtlety not the blunt instrument of death.  “If there is a back-up, I will find it. Just give me twelve hours.” And he hung up the phone before Uriel could protest, and got out of his car marching once more in the the electronics super store.
“Porn?” Agent Singer asks incredulous. Dean ignores him, knowing full well what will happen next. The page loads and pop ups start appearing all over the screen, suddenly the computer screen freezes completely glitching out and going dark.
"Shut up Balthazar," Michael and the man who must be Gabriel, snapped at the same time.
Now the damned thing had him cornered and he wasn't going to make it out without injury. Or worse. Boars were notoriously vicious.
“Oh, uh, work,” Cas said, the last thing he wanted to do was talk about work. “But i came a day early so i could relax a bit. I’ve never been to SoCal before.”
“How well do you-”
Then he leaned in and kissed him. It had been all he could think of all week. The pillowy lips of the man had troubled his sleep until he woken in the night and snuck out of the castle to see if he could find the man again.
“You’re on your own, Jimmy. There won’t be back up. I can’t even condone you doing this,” Uriel warned him in his head.
The money left from his mothers estate had been used up by the Lord Zachariah's extravagance until there was nothing left. When the debt collectors had come knocking it had somehow fallen on Castiel's shoulders to make up for the lack.
"Then let us consult with the craftsman Singer and see how our noble steed fares."
"Please?" Cas whined at him. His muscles ached and cramped in the cold and he was losing focus. Cold made one stupid and he couldn't afford to be stupid right now.
“Away foul demon, he was never yours.” Dean called out, his voice tight with trying to hold back the pain. Sam was trying to struggle up, but he had fallen badly on his fore arms and was in more pain that Dean.
"Is there something wrong with the pie, hon?" The waitress asked as she passed by.
Dean felt like the man was talking in riddles and it was making hims tetchy. "Sam, what? Of course- he's..." but then he realized he didn't really know. After his tryst with Anna, he had gone straight to the shower then to bed, hating himself, Anna, Castiel and the world all at the same time.
Roosters do not crow at the break of dawn. They crow well before the sun hits the horizon and seemingly anytime they felt like it. Castiel found himself waking groggy and bone weary to the grating sound that ripped through the night. He scrubbed a hand across his stubble covered face and sat up, for a moment confused as to where he was.
"Cas," He said, his voice high and cracking, in surprise. He looked vulnerable and suddenly Cas wished he hadn't come. Somehow he just couldn't make himself invisible around this man. A trick he could usually employ in most situations. Dean not only saw him, but was seen by him. It made being with him frightening.
Cas stood perfectly still not daring to breathe, knowing he had more to say.
"Anna Milton," He replied in kind. He was sort of done with the girl. "I need to find my first class."
He helped her out of the gown, but only after they had moved into the wagon. His lackeys made haste to unhitch the mounts from the borrowed carriage while they went inside. Crowley made disparaging faces at the dirt on the hem of her gown. He took the necklace and earrings, and the ivory combs. Made her wipe her face with a few more snarky comments.
"Why...why do you have a picture of Lucifer on your wall?"
Chuck struggled trying to climb back inside, but failed, holding on for dear life.
“And my brother? Jess? Chuck? Are they in danger?” Jimmy just looks out over the ocean and doesn’t answer. It is answer enough.
Maybe he wouldn’t go straight to sleep, he might spend a few minutes thinking about what could have happened with the cute receptionist.
"Okay..." the boy says. Cas, his name is Cas.
Dean didn’t hesitate, running out of the room as fast as his legs would carry him.  Castiel was just being led into the made entrance as he arrive. She was gazing around in awe as he came out at the top of the grand staircase.
Dean’s stare turned into a wicked grin. “Mr. Novak, you are full of little surprises.”
Sam pretended to read the page in front of him, but he was so intensely aware of Ruby's presence he was just staring at the page, the black letters blurring before his eyes. It was true, he was tense, but he had to get his grades back up or Dean would kill him.
He took a steadying breath, not caring that he was cryinf. “How when you died the last time I broke. I was so lost without you Cas. I nearly gave up. I really did. But when you came back, I didn’t tell you. It was like you said, just being in your presence was enough to get me up off the floor and keep going. I didn’t dare hope for more. Why would an angel want more.”
“And you saw them?” Dean nodded, his head feeling fuzzy as he tried to remember. “Did you back up the files? Is there an external drive?”
“Fine. And I’ll take you down just for kicks.”
Why couldn't his plans ever turn out, not even the simple ones that were meant to bring them closer.
The town was mostly dark, here in the docks area only every other block had a street lamp that was lit. It was getting towards the time of night when you could almost say it was the next morning.
“Uh, yeah, explain to me what’s with all the Patrick Swayze everywhere?”
As soon as she is gone his eyes lock with Dean's.
Two, the man was smart. His instinct wasn't bad and he was probably doing the only thing that would keep him from that mans clutches, but he was aimless and lost. His only goal to find the lost man of his dreams.
"Goodnight."
Castiel shrugged. "Want the tour?"
Dean nodded, snapping his mouth such, and feeling drained.
“Spit it out, Meg.”
It was November before the opportunity to use the lethal injections arose.  When the occasion finally occurred, the last person Dean expected to see was Billie.  She was dressed in black, now, with Death’s scythe in her hand.
Castiel didn’t talk to him on the phone as much – that wasn’t a big deal, either.  They’d gone a day or two without talking before since they’d sort-of-kind-of gotten together in December.  Dean would’ve been able to convince himself that the Mark was making him paranoid, but his instincts said otherwise.
“Hello, Dean,” said Castiel.
More than two months went by.  Dean and Sam both texted and called Castiel, but to no avail.
“Dean,” Castiel said again, his eyes on a bruise on Dean’s stomach.  “I-…”
“Cas?!” Dean yelled desperately.
Dean looked at Castiel as though he wanted to cry.  Castiel held himself back in case Sam or Kevin was around, but Dean came toward him anyway and pulled the angel into a tight hug.  When he came away, his eyes were shining.
“Posh?” Dean interrupted.  “Expensive?”  He gestured to the pure white sheets.  “Stain-free?  Cas, a single
“Cas?” asked Sam.
“What’s wrong with black tie?” asked Crowley, who was holding two black suits out to Dean.  “You two dress up in suits all the time, pretending to be ‘Agents Timberlake and Fatone,’ or ‘Agents Styles and Horan.’”  Crowley used air quotes.
Finally, when they arrived at the bunker, he asked, “So, batteries…”
Castiel gave a dark look of suspicion, and Dean knew that the angel knew exactly what he was doing.  He acquiesced, though.  Once Castiel was on his stomach, Dean traced his fingertips across the angel’s hips and thighs and butt.  He made wide, sweeping curves, massaging Castiel’s butt as he grew closer and closer to the hole.  Dean grabbed some lubricant off of the night stand next to him, and then slowly fit one and then two fingers inside, allowing them to catch on the tight muscle on the way in.  Castiel thrusted once into the mattress, a desperate moan escaping him.
“I’m sure it’ll be fine,” Dean said, his voice coming out clipped.  “Thanks – thanks for the heads up, Garth.  I’ve gotta go.  I can hear him coming down.”  Dean couldn’t hear anything.
Dean thought he might break Lucifer’s magical hold on him with his anger alone, but instead the angel moved impossibly closer.  “Castiel has given you everything he has, but you’re broken, even more than the rest of your species.  I might be evil, but all the better to recognize it, Dean.
Dean was confused.  “Wait.  What?  How?”  Did he mean before they had faced Lucifer?  Or something he had been doing in the week and a half since Castiel last spoke to them?  Something was
“Cas, you're gonna want some backup on this,” insisted Sam.
“Cas, why would an angel blow up a Colonel Scoop's in your name?” asked Sam.
“I think so,” said Castiel.  “I will be.”  And it was Castiel, the same Castiel he’d spoken to on the phone just yesterday.  The same Castiel that had healed him after his smiting sickness earlier that day.
“When I was out with Crowley, I had sex with every man, woman, human, and demon that I wanted to!  You can tell that to Cas, too, or else I will next time I see him.  And for the first time in my life I didn’t have to worry about what my young impressionable kid brother would think, and it was
“Okay, Dean,” said Castiel frankly, and this time he moved in for the kiss.
“No, thankfully,” said Castiel.  “But it’s why I was still allowed to see you at all.
“This is not you, man,” Dean protested as Castiel stocked the gas station shelves.  “You are above this.  Come on.”
It felt like the bottom had fallen out of Castiel’s stomach.  But there was still hope.  Dean had been dead before, after all…
“Not that I have anything like that in mind in the future,” Castiel added hurriedly.  “But I’m an angel, Dean, and my duty is to Heaven above all, as yours is to Sam.”
Dean dug his fingers even farther into Castiel’s hips and once again attempted to pull Castiel back downward, groaning in frustration when Castiel grinned and resisted his efforts.
Castiel sighed as though Dean were being very annoying.  “We need to talk to Kevin and see if he’s been able to translate the tablet,” he said gruffly.
“Nah, seriously, dude.  We took down
“Yep,” said a voice to his right.  “That’s the good news.”
They had not been on board with telling Dean and Sam.
An uncomfortable feeling began inside Castiel.  It was a prickling of his skin, the way it used to be, before he Fell…
And then Sam slumped over in his arms, gasping and coughing.  Dean called for Castiel, but then he saw that the sky was full of shooting stars.
Dean almost fired back, “But I don’t want to be with other people!”
They thought he was under some sort of spell!  But he had to leave.  He could barely protect Kelly on his own!  The recent deaths of Joshua and Kelvin flashed in front of him.  He could
“Enough,” said Sam.  “Cas, you said when you heard Benjamin, he was screaming.”
“I just… look, Dean,” Castiel was saying.  “Now that the Darkness is out… I don’t have time for all of these… human… things.  Okay?”
“Thanks, man,” said Dean, unable to believe his luck.
!” Castiel said insistently.
. You told me I was out, Dean.”
The bad guy had been caught.  Castiel felt a swoop of pride; they had won this battle, even though Castiel had been, frankly, terrible at hunting.
It did not escape Dean’s notice that although he thought that life would be a lot more cramped with Castiel hanging around all the time, he was also desperate for his friend to stay.
“I’ll come to you,” Dean said.  He paused before adding, “If you’ve, um, got some free time.”
“And hey, look at that, you're finally not a virgin anymore,” Dean responded.  But you know what?  I think it was time.  I respect the fact that you wanted to stay true and pure and waited.”
“That doesn’t sound like the Dean Winchester I know and love,” she said.  “The man who has been dead so many times, but it never seems to stick.”  She observed him critically.  “Maybe you’re not that guy anymore, the guy who saves the world, the guy who always thinks he’ll win no matter what.”
Dean patted Castiel on the arm.  “I'm fine.”  He could feel Dean’s energy, however, and it was writhing with something new, something awful.
Slowly, he used the lubricant and reached underneath Castiel, massaging his behind as he sucked lazily.  Castiel, groaned softly as Dean neared his hole.  Finally, when he was sure Castiel was ready, he carefully inserted one finger.  Castiel’s breathing had picked up, and he made a half-hearted attempt to reach for Dean, but Dean moved easily out of the way.  He could tell when he found the right spot because Castiel groaned and then pitched forward in surprise.  “Dean!”
Castiel took great care in healing Sam the rest of the way, and by the new year he had recovered fully from the trials and Gadreel.  New Years’ Day came and went.  Sam and Castiel drank Scotch and heard the shotguns and fireworks outside suggesting the new year, and Sam fell asleep in the lounge area in front of the tiny television.
Sam opened his eyes and gave a smile that was less sleepy than Castiel would’ve expected.  “I thought so,” he said.  “He loves you too, you know?”
Ramiel had said.
Dean wished his words of comfort that morning could’ve come true for the kid.  “Yeah, well-…”
The portly man swept away, and Dean and Castiel followed him down a long hallway into an open ballroom.  The ballroom contained several large tables, at which sat over 30 couples of what looked like all nationalities.  Dean could immediately pick out at least two other same-sex couples of the male variety and two female, so Crowley had been right – they didn’t stick out, after all.  A few of the couples were standing and talking to other people at other tables, but most were seated.
amount?” Dean asked.  Honestly, when he thought of Castiel sleeping with someone else, he found himself feeling incredibly pissed the fuck off.
“Kevin's blood is on my hands, and that ain't ever getting clean,” Dean was protesting in the face of Sam’s anger.  “I'll burn for that.  I will.  But I'll find Gadreel.  And I will end that son of a bitch.  But I'll do it alone.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You thought his life was at stake,” said Castiel.
“Yeah,” Dean said, “I got played.”
He wished he hadn’t said that to Sam, and he hoped Sam hadn’t said anything to Cas.  (He would rather eat his own eyeballs then ask.)  Either way, he had a feeling that Castiel had been able to guess.  Castiel knew more about him than he knew about himself, including the fact that when he was left to his own devices he definitely tended to be promiscuous.  Maybe that was why Castiel had said the thing about the “female in the car.”  In the end, Castiel’s involvement with Hannah was probably his fault.
“You… you did?”
“What other angel?”
“Hey there.”
One of the handsome men across the table spoke up.  “It’s not how these things are typically done,” he said, seeming apologetic.  His accent was slightly French.  “But Timmy’s always said he doesn’t care what others do.  This is his passion, and he’ll host the auctions and his parties how he pleases.  And the donors don’t care, of course, because it brings a crowd.”
“Sam, this isn't about me,” interrupted Castiel.  “It's about Benjamin.”
“Of course she’s not,” said Castiel, again with that “the sky is blue” voice.  “Dean, Amara was a cosmic being.  She was bonded to you through the Mark, and that bond manifested as attraction.  I would not begrudge you kissing her, just like I don’t begrudge you kissing anyone else.”
Dean shrugged.  “Sounds easy enough for you,” he said.
“Just because Dad put on my handcuffs doesn’t mean you’re suddenly tough shit.”  He moved back infinitesimally.
“It’s a boy,” said Sam suddenly.
“I know,” Dean said grumbled, irritated but resolute.  “You’ll call when you have news, yeah?”
“I’m James Carmichael,” said Castiel.  “And this is my husband, Walter Cannon.”  He put his arm on Dean’s shoulder tentatively, imitating Justin and Tyler’s public display of affection.  Dean’s heart seemed to stop in his chest.
He knew, on some level, that she had used all of the spells and devices at Heaven’s disposal to take control of his mind.  A small part of him felt that she was justified, and that it was a part of his penance, at least at first.  These angels had gotten him out of Purgatory, after all, so they had the right to use him for their purposes.  He had once told Dean that his resurrection after the leviathans had taken control of his body had been a punishment, and he believed this now more than ever.  He was a warrior, and he had done horrible things in the name of the greater good.  He would not be allowed rest, not be allowed death.  His powers would be used as the tools of others.
“No, no, no.  No, no.  It's fine, Cas,” Dean said.  “Besides, I had it comin'.”
“I did miss you, Dean,” he said.
Dean remembered, not for the first time in the last few days, all of the awful choices Castiel had made in the name of “handling it himself” – becoming God, deceiving them for an entire year, leaving him alone in Purgatory, allowing Lucifer to possess him…
“I can go with you,” Dean said, without much hope.
On some level, Castiel understood what had happened.  He understood that a team of angels had worked hard to extract him from Purgatory, and that some of them had died in the process.  He understood that Heaven was now under the control of an angel named Naomi, who used to be based in Angel Intelligence.  She had a reputation for being as ruthless as she was devious, but not evil.  She had always reminded him of Michael, a bit.
“I think I may have a lead on Lucifer.  I found a police report in Cleveland about a man whose eyes flared a glowing red.  It could be Lucifer in a new body.”
The first time Dean thought they might have a shot was with a waitress named Mandy who came on strongly to Castiel in a diner – in front of his mother and Sam, no less!
Castiel looked puzzled again for a second, then said, “Dean, you misunderstand me.  Per our agreement, sex with someone else, without the other present, would be cheating.  When I think of this I find myself feeling a slight amount of jealousy.”
Dean moved forward on the bed until their lips brushed, feather-light.  He moved back just a little and looked at Castiel, clearly a request for permission.
“I’ll deal with it,” snapped Castiel.  “I’ve got to go.”
For example, after Castiel didn’t call for a week in November, he finally admitted to Dean, “Crowley told me that you had, um, carnal relations, during the time that you were a demon.  Now, I don’t mind if you did, Dean, I was just-…”
“It's a gift,” Dean said, barely looking at him.  “You keep those.”
Castiel struggled away from Lucifer.  “You wanna play that way?” Lucifer taunted, and punched him repeatedly in the face.  He was fighting all of them at once, and winning.
“Uh, no,” Dean said, attempting to mask his shock at even being asked.  “Definitely not.”
When Castiel finally removed his shirt to reveal the lithe runner’s build beneath, he caught Dean’s eye again.  “Like what you see?” he asked, quirking a smile.
“Please!” Castiel begged to Naomi.  He could feel himself punching every part of Dean he could find.  He was killing him…
Over, done, finite.  But now – now we’ve got Rosemary’s baby, and – and
“What the hell are you talking about?” asked Dean.  Panic alarms flared in his mind, and everything – the demon trials, the angel trials, even Castiel – paled in comparison to this.
Fuck this.  “Cas and I broke up,” he said matter-of-factly.
Lucifer – or rather, Vince Vincente – had reportedly spent the day in the studio, so Castiel, Crowley, Sam, and Dean broke into Ladyheart’s hotel rooms.  They found only a human tooth that had been ripped out of the mouth by the root.
“That mission has been completed,” Castiel’s rough voice responded.  “Only a few angels still remain on Earth, and those angels are harmless and have promised not to harm humans.”
“Uh, everything I can.  There's actually another angel in there working on him right now.”
“I um…” (Kiss.)  “I also thought maybe-…”  (Kiss.)  “If you’re still interested-…”  (Kiss.) “We could try sex with, um, the positions reversed, like you said.”  (Kiss.)
to die,” she realized, and Dean did.
Castiel looked into Dean’s eyes, surprise showing in the depths of the blue.  There were merely inches left between them.  “I thought you hadn’t figured out your feelings?” he whispered.
Castiel had always given him space to progress their relationship however he wanted, which was part of why he adored the angel so much.  Still, he worried that Castiel had been at the bunker for an entire two months without making up an excuse to leave.
He tried to call Castiel again, but, of course, there was no answer.
“Dean?” Castiel said, surprised and panicked as Dean, Sam, and Mary filed into the house.
(It was getting easier each day, though it would never be truly easy.)  The second-most-interesting thing that had happened in the past four years had been a nest of six vampires in Missouri.  And
Crowley snapped his fingers, and suddenly both Dean and Castiel were wearing black dress pants and dress shoes along with their flannel tops.  Their previous pants and shoes sat folded on their laps.
“T-Two thousand eight hundred,” said Dean.   Jesus, he was going to blow like a teenager in this room full of a hundred people…
“Don’t worry,” Dean said, “We’ll get you figured out after we finish this case.  Um, in the meantime, I guess you can just stay here tonight.  Don’t watch me sleep, okay, ‘cause that’s creepy.  But you could use my laptop.  If you’re going to be a hunter, you might want to familiarize yourself with the internet.  Just… when you find the porn, click exit, because some of the porn sites give you viruses, and you don’t know which ones to use.”
Castiel appeared to stutter for a second, as if lost for words.  “Angel… Amore,” he finally ground out, wincing.  He seemed to be trying to shrink backward into the wall, and Dean had to lean in to hear what he was saying.  When he did, Castiel moved even farther back.
to a man, at least not like he was to Cas.  Granted, he’d never really given himself the chance to decide if he was truly attracted to men.  He liked women, after all (that much he knew for certain).  Women were easier – easier for him to not become attached to, and more socially acceptable.  That had always been enough, at least until Castiel.
“Right, well, don’t dream of anything,” snapped Dean.  “Look, here’s the Rod of Aaron, I’m taking the Staff of Moses like we agreed, just take me to the bunker.”  He shoved one of the suitcases into Crowley’s waiting arms and tightened his hold on the other two.
“Who are you gonna believe?” Ishim asked Castiel.  “Your brother, or some filthy ape who's always talking down to you, always mocking you!”
It was Bobby, sitting on a chair in front of Harvelle’s Roadhouse.  Dean felt something warm tug at his insides.  Bobby and Harvelle’s… well, Heaven was definitely good so far.  But surely they were only memories.  Bobby was in Heaven’s prison for assisting Castiel in Metatron’s escape years before.
He looked at Sam pointedly.  “Now, if you’re done with this Lifetime movie moment, I’m starving.”
“That's not what he was doing,” said Hannah.  “Roll it back.  There.”  Hannah pointed to a girl sitting in a booth at the ice cream shop.  “That was an angel – Esther.  She's one of Metatron's.”
“Dean,” Cas began again, and Dean began thrusting in earnest.
Dean wasn’t attracted to men, for the simple reason that his father wouldn’t have stood for it.  He occasionally had thoughts about men, but he reassured himself that that didn’t mean that he was gay.  After all, he was (this he knew for sure) extremely attracted to women, and there were quite enough of those to go around.
Sam still seemed to finally give up, only adding that he would be back in five minutes if Dean didn’t come out of his room.
Too late, he thought. Castiel stopped in front of him. He hadn’t looked away once, walking in the middle of the crowd of students without a single care in the world. His throat was dry, his tongue felt heavy in his mouth. He was stuck, drowning in his blue eyes. He had never realized that they were that blue.
Still trying to hold back the sobs, he felt like his chest was suddenly ripped open, every emotion he had ever felt exposed, raw, for everyone to see.
When the figure next to Castiel turned toward Dean, he started looking in front of him again, ignoring the feeling of jealousy spreading in his chest. Meg Masters. She was always glued to Castiel’s side, with an arm around his shoulders, or her head in his lap. Dean couldn’t understand why Castiel had chosen to date her. He was so good he didn’t even seem real, and she was the complete opposite… She didn’t even try to hide it, so Castiel had to know about everything. About the gun that she was carrying around at all times. About the way she acted around anyone who wasn’t Castiel. She was a dick, basically. Simply seeing her car around town pissed Dean off. She obviously didn’t deserve Castiel, yet she had the chance to be the person chosen by Castiel. She had his heart, his love, and to Dean, it wasn’t fair.
Plus, Dean was nothing. He didn’t have any exceptional capacities, and to him, he didn’t have any redeemable qualities either. As he liked to call himself any chance he’d get, basically writing it under his name on any of his belongings, he was a teenage dirtbag.
Cas’ eyes widened again, his mouth opening in shock, his fingers gripping at nothing.
He could feel his lips starting to shake, but still didn’t dare to move. The dark-haired boy smiled, stuffing his hands in his pockets. What was happening right now? How did he know who Dean was?
Dean threw him a disbelieved look.
It seemed like the portal just couldn’t close with him in the opening. He could probably get completely inside if he tried, but he wanted to get them both out, not stuck in.
“Don’t you get it?! I love you! I always have!”
Slowly getting Cas back into the room, he felt the edges of the portal running against his back, and finally it was done.
“’Cause I’m just a teenage dirtbag, Dean, like you.”
Only allowing himself a small gasp, he kissed back, trying to put all his love, adoration and relief into it.
If God wasn’t such an asshole, he’d be praying to reach it on time. But since God was pretty much the reason all this shit show was happening, the only thought in Dean’s mind was the same that had been going off this entire hour.
His eyes were closing again, and he barely registered the door slamming behind him before he fell back on his bed.
“But I’m already dressed!”
Biting back on a sob of relief, Dean immediately reached out his hand.
“Seriously Sam, shut your mouth.”
Shit. This little fucker was way too clever for his age.
He couldn’t really remember all the details from the dream, he was pretty sure that they were at prom. He also felt really good just thinking about it, which probably meant that it had been a pretty good dream. Damn, if only dreams weren’t so easy to forget…
Immediately looking Cas over to make sure he was okay, Dean froze when their eyes met. Just like his, Cas’ were still filled with tears, and a multitude of emotions seemed to go through them all at once. Shock, disbelief, surprise, fear…
He wanted to sigh, but couldn’t stop the smile and the probably soft blush that was spreading on his face. He loved dreaming about Castiel, because it was the only time when he could pretend that he was close to the guy. Like Dean was his whole world, because it sure as hell seemed like Castiel was his, or at least could be.
“Jerk.” Sam muttered, not even trying to hide his smile.
For a second, he swore he saw Cas furrow his eyebrows. He dared himself to hope a bit more.
“Please, you have to wake up!”
Hope became desperation.
He didn’t know why, but he finally felt tears run down his cheeks.
He was looking at Castiel again. The distance between them was too big for him to see anything, but when Castiel threw his head back with a smile, laughing at some joke that Meg had told him, he could tell that his blue eyes were as bright as a night sky full of stars.
All but throwing himself into the infinite void, not knowing what would happen to him, he instinctively held his breath, as if he was jumping into a pool.
“School, Dean?”
“You could say that.” Dean sighed, finally coming to terms with the fact that Sam wasn’t going to drop the subject.
As he got to it, the portal was barely big enough for Dean to step through, but he couldn’t afford to stop now.
“Son of a bitch!”
Surprising even himself, Dean let out a small laugh. Unable to stop himself, he softly stroked Cas’ hair.
How could he know who Dean was? Why did he care? Suddenly, Dean wanted to run. It felt overwhelming. Why today, why now? He had dreamt about these eyes on him, and now that it was the case… How could he even believe this to be real?
Jumping to his feet, he watched as Cas completely disappeared into the Empty. Not taking a second to think, Dean ran towards the closing portal.
“Dean.”
He was hoping for a quiet drive, but, apparently, Sam was really trying to be the biggest bitch of all this morning.
Everything was going too fast, one second him and Cas were running into the room, the next Cas was pushing him aside.
“Come with me Friday, don’t say maybe.” The smile on Castiel’s face seemed to grow bigger.
“You’re such an idiot…”
He forced himself to look away, but the image of Castiel laughing was still perfectly clear in his mind.
He felt a hand grip his.
Staring at the ceiling, his gaze slowly fell down on his alarm clock again, the digits finally registering.
“Dean!”
Only his torso had fit through, but he could still feel his legs and some light was visible behind him, so he had to assume his lower half was still in the room in the bunker.
It was all he had. He hoped, like he had never dared to hope before, that it was enough.
Finally, voice hoarse from everything that had just happened, eyes incredibly wide, Cas broke the silence:
It was just a flash of tan fabric at first, somewhere a couple feet under the portal.
He nodded, smiling, blushing, but he didn’t care. He was a teenage dirtbag, and so was Castiel.
He couldn’t let it happen. Cas was an idiot for thinking Dean wouldn’t interfere.
Both of his hands in Cas’ hair, he let himself cry again, feeling his broken heart slowly being mended together with every kiss that Cas pressed to his lips, every stroke of Cas’ hand against his cheek, every bubble of warmth that kept exploding in his chest whenever he realized that this was real.
“I love you too.”
Cas was crying, Dean could see it. There was no light that could reflect on the tears, yet his eyes were still shining with them. He looked back at Dean, his face sad and clearly resigned.
Dean felt himself stop breathing again, and the tears he’d been holding back almost spilling. It felt like losing everything. His hope, his life, his soul… Nothing seemed to matter anymore.
He was doing some laps, his eyes unconsciously drifting towards the benches where he immediately spotted a familiar face. Even from afar, he could tell that his hair was as wild as usual. On anybody else, it would look terrible, but Castiel somehow pulled it off, looking like a walking fantasy in his stupidly adorable oversized trench coat. Why he couldn’t get a coat that fitted him was a true mystery, but once again, it only made him look more charming.
They arrived on time, probably thanks to the few speed limits that Dean ignored while trying to get away from his brother as soon as possible. Dean had run off towards the locker rooms immediately after having parked his car, and Sam had disappeared somewhere in the hallways to look for his friends.
Dean squinted briefly at his alarm, but couldn’t seem to find it in him to care. He came to rest his head against the door, his eyes already closing.
Cas had believed in him when no one else did. He had always been by his side, no matter how many times Dean had tried to push him away.
He felt so angry. Angry at the Empty for even daring to come anywhere near Cas, angry at Cas for sacrificing himself to save Dean
“Fine.” He mumbled, still half asleep. Being already pissed off this early wasn’t good, he could already tell that this day was going to be awful.
He was trying very hard to make his brother understand that if he could kill with a stare, he would do it right now. But Sam was only glaring at him as if Dean was the biggest moron living on the planet.
“Winchester! Look at where you’re going!”
Dean was on the floor. The sound of his own heartbeat in his ears was deafening.
His voice shaking with fear and heartbreak, holding onto his last sliver of hope, he screamed:
He pulled as hard as he could. It was clear the Empty was still sucking Cas in, but it looked like the portal was still trying to close.
“Stay…” He repeated, his voice a whimper, letting the tears blur his vision completely.
With a gasp of surprise, he instinctively tugged on the hand, bringing the other’s body against his.
“No, no! I’ve got you, I’m not letting go!”
He still wasn’t making any move to get up. Dean couldn’t stop crying, he knew he was two seconds away from completely breaking down.
He didn’t care about any of it anymore. All that mattered was getting Cas home.
Castiel.
Dean didn’t even try to deny it. He knew that if he did, Sam would just keep questioning him, which would either end up in a fight or with him finding out about Castiel. Two things that he didn’t want to see happen anytime in the near future.
They both stayed silent for a bit, as if neither of them could remember how to form words. The world seemed to have stopped, everything standing still, waiting.
His eyes opened and immediately widened when he saw Dean.
“I still can’t believe that you chose Dr Sexy MD over studying for your test…”
Even when they were separated, Dean knew Cas would be there for him if he could. Dean only needed to ask.
, and angry at himself for not making sure that Cas knew he was loved and wanted sooner.
He was listening to Iron Maiden right now, alone, his back pressed against his locker. Just thinking about it, he had a lot of fantasies about Castiel. How he would ask him out, how he would tell him how he feels… Or the other way around, mostly the other way around in fact, with Castiel telling him that he had loved him all this time, Castiel kissing him, Castiel holding his hand…
Sorry.
he tried to shout, but his vessel wouldn’t obey.
Castiel gave Dean a wide smile, then twitched uncomfortably.  “Dean, I need… I need…”
He briefly considered his options.  Justin and Tyler were currently speaking in low voices with T.L. Laurant across the room.  Judging by their body language, Dean was able to ascertain that they were bidding their host good-bye.  The demon knife was held preciously in Justin’s right hand, in an old-looking scabbard.  Prisha and Imanu were currently engaged in the bidding war for Gungnir.
“You have work to do,” said Billie.  “That’s all you need to know.  And trust me, having my eyes opened to the necessity of any humans, especially Winchesters, is not a thrill.  So…you wanna die, but I say…keep living.”  And she sent him back.
“Hunting,” said Dean without thinking.
Castiel did a mental inventory of his true form.  Weak, but he would recover with enough time – a
Dean’s look of surprise turned into one of bliss.  “God yes!” he exclaimed, his eyes catching Castiel’s blue ones.  Castiel ignored Dean’s words, but allowed himself a slight smile.
“Dean… how did you come to acquire the Mark of Cain?”
“What are we, Cas?” Dean asked softly.
There was no use hiding it from Death herself.  “What do you want me to say?” he asked. “Doesn’t matter.
Dean turned back to Castiel with alarm, but the angel stalled him with a hand to his chest and a reassuring look.  “It’s nothing you can fix, Dean.  I’m an angel.  We aren’t meant to be grounded at all, much less grounded in one place.”
As the one-month anniversary of his last contact with Castiel approached, the angel’s words echoed in Dean’s head:
“She’s chained up,” answered Sam.
Apparently, this was all it took for their tender moment to turn into something more.  A wall of desire hit Dean so suddenly it was like being bowled over.  He could feel himself hardening. He intensified the kiss, moving his hand steadily up Castiel’s leg.
Castiel’s vessel felt heavy and disgusting.  He had sweat through all of his clothing.  He realized with a start that he had unzipped his pants and pulled out his erection in his frenzy for relief which had never come.  Now that the Angel Amore was out of his system, he was still half-hard and frustrated, but also tired and lethargic.  Castiel longed to clean both himself and his clothes, but the angel cuffs prevented it at the moment.  How long would it be before Dean came to let him out?
Sam shrugged.  “I did, really.”
Dean laughed, then pretended to shudder.  “Ugh.  Domestic life.”
Castiel’s eyes widened.  “Those are the property of angels and wield great power.  You must take me to them.”
“You could join if you think you can survive it,” Billy added with a wicked grin.
Yes, it was better if Castiel remained human and didn’t go looking for trouble.  At least then he would stay
“There’s no need,” said Dean.  “You’re family.”
Dean was shocked.  Sam was one thing – Sam knew him better than he knew himself.  But his
“A sales associate?” Dean asked in disbelief.
missed call, at 11:49 AM
But there were lives at stake.  “I'm on my way,” he said, ending the call.
“Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!” yelled Dean, rounding the corner and addressing the blond woman.  “It's okay.  It's okay.  He's a friend, all right?  Hey, Cas.”
“Castiel, please proceed to the Room for Captives,” Hannah said.  “Dean Winchester killed Tessa, but we have managed to subdue him.”
Suddenly, they were startled by the sound of Mary clearing her throat.  She was looking, amused, at Dean’s hand on top of Castiel’s.  With a heart-stopping yelp, Dean let his hand drop to the floor.
Dean supposed he could just add it to the pile of things he was guilty about, which had grown exponentially since his time as a demon.  The single thing he didn’t regret, surprisingly, was finally admitting to Sam that he had had a “thing” with Castiel.  Nothing had changed between the two brothers as a result, and if it weren’t for his fear of emotional confrontation Dean almost wished he had told his brother sooner.
“Well, thanks. School wasn’t exactly easy for me. In fact, I mostly hated it. I just try to remember what that was like and do what I can to make sure my students don’t feel the same. If that means some paint mishaps, then I’ll take it.”
*****
Raindrops pepper the ground outside while he walks through the nightly closing procedures and standard safety checks to make sure that all the tools and vehicle parts are secured and ready for the next morning. Satisfied, he flips off the lights and enters the front reception area through the side door that connects the garage to the small customer lobby. Considering the weather and the fact that it’s past closing time, Dean’s surprised to find someone standing just inside the front entrance, back turned to the lobby as he stares out the windowed door towards the street.
Dean doesn’t really know what to say to that, so he looks back out towards the dogs still playing in the water and leans back, resting his weight on his wrists as he enjoys the feel of the sun on his face and the company of his new companion. A minute or so passes when he decides to speak again.
A pang of nostalgia hits him out of nowhere and his stomach drops as he sucks in a breath. He doesn’t know how to describe the feeling, but it’s like he
His words are cut off as a hand is placed on Dean’s shoulder from someone standing behind him. He turns around to come face to face with Ellen. She looks more stressed out than she has been all evening, so that can’t be a good sign.
Tonight, a nervous excitement fills the air at the Roadhouse Bar and Grill and the place is absolutely buzzing. It’s mostly packed full of family and friends for what has been dubbed its “Grand Pre-Opening”, a somewhat private event. The restaurant has not been opened to the public quite yet, but the kitchen and bar are fully staffed for the guests and service is in full swing. In addition to the usual familiar faces, the invitees include a select list of well known community members as well as journalists belonging to local newspapers, magazines, and food blogs. The hope is that the event will drum up excitement for the Roadhouse’s grand opening next week, when the doors officially open and all of Bobby and Ellen’s hard work is laid bare to the court of public opinion.
“As long as there’s beer with that pizza, count me in,” Dean says.
“Um. You have something on your face.” Dean’s hands shoot up to rub at his nose, his cheeks, and over his mouth, until finally Cas specifies, “By your ear. No. Other ear. Yeah. There.” Finally, Dean’s hand comes away with green paint smeared on his fingertips. “And forgive me, but is that glitter in your hair?”
Cas wipes his face with a napkin and sets his hands in his lap. “Yes, thank you very much. The food is delicious.”
Ash, one of the more seasoned bartenders here, gives him a hearty slap on the shoulder as he steps past Dean, holding the door so they can switch positions in the entranceway.
The man marches towards him and the room fills with flashes of fire and light, sparks dancing all around, cascading from the ceiling. The man stops and Dean’s heart slows. He should be scared, he should run, but he stays put, unable to tear his eyes away the stranger. He’s transfixed. Another particularly vivid flash of light illuminates the room, and Dean picks up on something large and looming just behind the figure. The way the light plays against it, it almost looks like…
Just outside of his view, he senses another’s presence and his world grows inexplicably calm as the storm continues to rage around him. Without seeing him, Dean is aware that the dark haired man in the long coat - the one he’s seen before in dreams past - is there with him, and Dean innately knows that he is safe.
look back at him are a deep blue, a reflection of the storm closing in overhead. They’re full of… Dean isn’t quite sure… desperation maybe, or hopelessness, but there’s kindness there, too. They’re shiny and searching and they stay locked with Dean’s as he offers one gentle nod of his head, giving Dean permission to drive on. So he does.
“Yeah man, no worries.” Dean watches as the guy shoves his book back in the backpack, zips it closed, then hoists it up over his shoulder. “Hey, you gonna be— ...okay?” Before the sentence is finished, the stranger is out the door.
“Anyway, Cas, it was good to see you and thanks again for the amazing review. I’ll let the family know that I was able to thank you in person, they’ll be happy to hear it.” As he speaks, he notices that Cas has a confused look on his face, and a slight tilt of the head makes it look like he’s thinking. Jesus, Dean needs to get the fuck out of here. He makes his move to turn around back to his cart and step away when Cas’s firm hand grabs him at the elbow to get his attention.
The article continues to overflow with sophisticated praise and rounds out on a beautiful note about Ellen’s
Castiel just stares back at Dean and tilts his head to the side again, looking lost and confused, but also really adorable. “I’m sorry. I’m not much for movies.” He shrugs and glances down, pushing sand around with his forefinger.
It’s not like he’s lonely in the way that he gets bored on a Saturday night and needs more friends. No, he’s lonely in the way that settles like an ache in his chest, like something is missing and hollow and desperate to be filled. He longs for the companionship and easy comfort that only comes with knowing someone so well that their presence is an effortless constant, a continuous source of warmth and assurance.
The next morning Dean gets to the shop a little early, the optimism of it being a Friday providing a natural levity to the day, even before the coffee kicks in. He usually works on Saturdays, but Bobby gave him the weekend off. Technically, he always has Sunday off, but it’s nice to add a work-free Saturday to the rotation for once. San Seton is a small enough town that many businesses are still closed on Sundays, but it’s a tradition that’s fading fast. Bobby, however, being the old stubborn man that he is, refuses to give way to
“Cas, wait.” They both freeze, Cas seemingly holding his breath and Dean not sure where his words are coming from. “Why don’t you take my number? That way, we can try for that beer some other time.”
Dean turns to look at the man and he takes in the wild, dark hair, the strong jaw, and the ocean blue eyes…
“Thank you, but please, I don’t want any kind of special treatment. You weren’t saving this seat for someone else were you?”
Aside from the gorgeous coastline, the road into and through Bagyo is speckled with shops and restaurants, all local, no recognizable corporate chains or flashy signs, just small establishments, mostly all family owned and operated. One of his absolute favorite places is a short way off the main road and right on the water. It’s a small hole-in-the-wall joint at the marina where several sailboats and small fishing vessels are anchored, and it serves the greatest clam chowder Dean has ever tasted. On a good day, the line is out the door and around the corner, full of locals and outsiders alike.
Just as before, Dean thinks he should be scared, but there is a calmness that settles over him that he can’t explain, so he approaches the man in the kitchen. When the stranger speaks, his voice is deep and commanding. Dean can’t quite grasp what exactly is being said, but Dean feels his pulse quicken. It all seems so ominous, and yet Dean feels safe, protected. The man’s presence is somehow familiar and calming. Dean doesn’t know why.
“Sounds amazing, man. I’m happy you got to take the time off.”
Dean has been at the beach for over two hours already and the familiar soreness in his muscles from walking along the sand has begun to creep in. The sun’s heat is settling on his face and arms and he thinks he should probably call it a day, since he hasn’t applied sunscreen since before leaving the apartment this morning. As he readies himself to make his way back to his card, another dog comes bounding up to him, circling his legs.
Seb makes a playful yelp, clearly unamused by the strange staring contest happening, and it proves to be a successful distraction. Castiel bends down to give Seb a pat on the head and takes a step back, away from Dean and in the direction from which he came.
“What?!” Sam lurches forward in his seat, nearly knocking Jessica off his shoulder. He sits back and readjusts her, lowering his voice. “Are you kidding me, Dean? You didn’t think to share that with the class?”
“Yes, I suppose.”
“You’ll find no argument with me there.”
Ash scoffs behind a knowing smile. “Where else you think she’d be? Listen, I gotta run to the bank for her before they close or she’ll have my ass. I was supposed to go two hours ago. You gonna hang out a bit? I’ll come back!” He finishes the question without waiting for an answer as he takes off in the direction Dean just came from. He’s in a hurry but doesn’t quite run, although looking at the time, he totally should. Ash just might have the laziest urgency Dean’s ever seen, either that or he’s the most energetic stoner, but who knows which. Whichever it is, Ash is out of sight and Dean turns on his heel to head inside.
An hour later, Dean heads back over to the table where Jo is arm wrestling some guy and Sam looks to be half holding Jess up to make sure she doesn’t fall off her stool as she laughs at Jo’s trash talking. Jo wins and as she’s celebrating her victory, the guy passes Dean while headed back towards the bar, presumably to buy her the drink that she undoubtedly wagered. He’s about to make a snarky comment when Jo beats him to it.
“And maybe I want to smoosh
“Jeeze, Dean. Subtle, much? Why don’t we have a drink first before you go hunting for better company.” Sam says it jokingly, but Dean knows there is a hint of honesty there.
had enough for tonight.” Jess boops Sam on the nose and Dean sees that Sam is trying hard not to laugh.
Castiel looks up at him, like it’s a weird question to ask, and Dean wonders if he’s somehow managed to cross a line by bringing up his girlfriend. Or maybe she’s his wife? He isn’t sure, but he’s only trying to be polite. “Ummm… she seems to like it, I guess.”
He rubs his hands together and blows on them to warm them up. The sun is going down and with it, the temperature. He can tell that the storm that’s been brewing all day isn’t too far off, but he’s got some time to enjoy his food and the view before he’ll head back and hunker down for the night. The line isn’t too long at the moment and he’s just about to step into the building when he looks up and spots a familiar maroon hoodie off in the distance, the occupant of the hoodie seated at a bench facing the marina.
“Well look at that, that’s some pretty epic timing,” Dean beams. “I just finished up here and looks like those clouds did, too.”
“Wait. Did she actually reject Dean Winchester?! ‘Cuz I gotta be honest, I thought she was going to be a sure thing. Even though Jess and I did aaaaallllll that work for you and you just ran off with Ash the second we turned our backs and--”
*****
As Benny speaks, and without skipping a beat, he wipes off the countertop and grabs Dean a bottle of his favorite beer, a stout called Blue Thursday. Ellen, the fearless leader of this establishment, gets it shipped in from a lesser known brewery in Kansas. Dean was skeptical at first, rarely trusting all the new brewers with their overconfidence and disappointing unoriginality, but one sip of the Blue Thursday and he was hooked. He sometimes wonders if Ellen keeps ordering it just for him, but he doesn’t want to ask because, well, he doesn’t want to know the answer, so he keeps on drinking it and recommends the stout to anyone who’ll listen.
Dean found the truck abandoned on the side of a backroad about half a year ago, and after local law enforcement ran the VIN number and contacted the owner, the guy told Dean he could have her so long as he didn’t have to deal with getting her towed and Dean covered all the expenses, including the transfer of registration fees. By that evening, she was hauled to the back lot of
Before turning the corner, Dean lifts his head to throw a final glance down the aisle. He catches Cas looking back at him and their eyes meet. Dean smiles and walks away with his heart in his throat.
, does he look just as good as Dean remembers. Castiel is wearing fitted dark jeans with a black t-shirt under a maroon blazer. There’s a brown leather bag slung over his shoulder and he looks every bit the part of a young, casual professor. He has barely-there stubble on his face and Dean swears his skin is already a shade darker from the California sun. He silently wonders if Castiel has been back at the beach.
Dean’s helping one of their regulars, Mildred, with a couple of questions she has about her new Corolla. It’s only two years old, less than ten thousand miles and runs perfectly, yet she always manages to find an excuse to come into the shop. (It’s funny how her questions always seem to come up when Dean is working the desk. Go figure). He doesn’t mind, she’s actually pretty funny and generally harmless. Dean’s always assumed she’s also a bit lonely and spends her time making casual friends at various shops around town.
That evening, Dean crashes into his bed, exhausted. Zaz jumps right up next to him and promptly makes herself comfortable alongside Dean’s legs. When she first attempted to sleep in his bed, he had tried to tell her no, he really did, but she’s about as stubborn as Sam, and he no longer remembers when he gave up the fight. He’ll never admit it to Sam, but he really doesn’t mind having lost this one. The two of them fall fast asleep, happily worn out from a day in the sun.
Dean nearly chokes on the silent gasp that he inhales. The
“You finally figure out how to properly tie that tarp down?” Bobby muses from the doorway to the garage, coffee mug in hand.
“Listen, I gotta get some paperwork done and send a few emails. You’re welcome to hang out here for a bit and wait out the rain. Should pass us over pretty soon. This one’s not stickin’ around for long.” Dean can see the man’s shoulders relax at that information.
He gladly accepts.
“Well, no.”
“You got it. We’ll work the room.” And then they’re off to do whatever it is that they plan to do to be Dean’s wingwomen.
Dean takes a moment to survey the rest of him. He’s got a scruffy beard that’s at least a week or two old, dirt on his nose, and discoloration around his left cheekbone and under the eye. He looks like he’s seen better days, but his eyes still shine brighter than anyone’s Dean has ever seen. It momentarily makes his brain stutter to a halt as he takes in the man standing before him, but he recovers quickly.
Even as he says the words, Dean can feel a heat rise up through his body. It begins at his legs and works it’s way up through his torso until he can feel it burn hot on his paint-covered ears.
“Oh.” Steve looks down at his backpack, then at the dark storm clouds rolling in, and then back at Dean. “I have somewhere,” he says, suddenly avoiding eye contact again while he busies himself with his backpack, adjusting it before he picks it up and hoists it over his shoulder. “I better get going then.”
He needs to drive.
Cas’s eyes search his, looking for honesty behind his words. Cas must find what he’s looking for because after a beat, he agrees.
When Dean speaks next, most of his soup and half his sandwich is already gone, Steve’s meal similarly devoured. “So, where are you from?”
Two days ago, however, Dean recruited Jess and Jo to help coordinate a family meeting of sorts. They made sure that everyone had at least fifteen minutes to meet at the Roadhouse early this morning - before the restaurant opens, before Dean has to be at work, and before Sam can drown himself in his textbooks. As planned, they are all gathered together and sitting at a table because today is a big day. Today, the
“You got an invite?”
“Dude. You alright?”
“I just mean that I’m headed to a family thing, so uh, thanks for the invite, but I can’t. It’s the first time we’re all going to have a chance to be together in a long time and--”
Dean chuckles at the skeptical frown on Castiel’s face, and then they catch each other’s eyes again as silence falls between them. Dean sees something in those sapphire eyes looking back at him, but he can’t name it. All he knows is that he feels drawn to Castiel, with an inexplicable desire to get closer to him, in any way that he can. If he didn’t know any better, he’d say that Castiel makes him feel… a sense of longing, but that’s ridiculous. It doesn’t make any sense. They met a whole ten minutes ago, and yet, if he’s not totally misreading the situation, he thinks that maybe Castiel is hesitating? Staying put just a little too long?
Cas looks nervous again, and Dean almost asks if everything is alright before Cas speaks first. “Dean, I know that I’m here on a professional capacity and I’m sure you are very busy, but if you’re not needed immediately, would you like to s--”.
happen to order one of the best items on the menu, if you want my opinion. I can’t take credit for it, but I can tell you that it’s one of Ellen’s best recipes. I’ve never had jambalaya like hers and you won’t find anything else like it in California. I’d be willing to bet on that.”
“Here we are, best seat in the house!” Dean pulls out Cas’s chair and he accepts, dropping his shoulder bag down next to him.
Before pulling onto the road, he stops and looks over at his passenger. “So. Where to?”
“Okay. First of all… Sebastian is a
Thank god. Dean isn’t sure he could have handled whatever it was that Sam was about to say. He already knows that Sam isn’t a proponent of the one night stand, but to make it worse, Sam has been particularly worried over Dean for the past several months, after his breakup with his last girlfriend, Lisa. No matter how many times Dean assures him that he’s over her and he’s okay, Sam remains fussy and protective, like Dean is a fragile thing ready to crumble at any given moment. The truth of it is, he really is over her. Sure, the breakup wasn’t a picnic, but once he got some space from Lisa, it didn’t take long to come to the realization that they were never good for one another. Dean had simply been going through the motions, but his heart was never fully invested. He doesn’t miss her.
Dean leans in and gives Ellen a light kiss on the cheek. “Good luck with that.”
Dean cuts her off.
The feeling recedes almost as quickly as it comes and Dean finds his metaphorical footing again. Then he remembers; he swore to himself that if he ever saw Cas again, he’d thank him for the review he wrote on the Roadhouse.
“Hey, uh, I’m not trying to be presumptuous here, but, uh, do you have someplace to stay tonight?” When Steve’s eyes snap up to meet his, nervous and fearful, Dean realizes his question came out all wrong. “It’s just that there’s a pretty nasty storm headed this way and by the looks of it, it’s going to make landfall within the hour. So if you’re headed somewhere, you’ll want to get there quick. I can drive you, if you need a ride.”
“Yeah, me too.” Dean glances over his shoulder towards Ellen’s retreating frame before twisting back to Cas. “Oh! By the way, how’s Sebastian doing? Any more attempts to sneak out and make new friends?”
The day presses on and although he’s kept busy, it drags on in that long, drawn out way that Fridays usually do, when he looks at the clock expecting two hours to have passed only to see it’s been a whole fifteen minutes. He’s been assigned to work the front desk today, his absolute least favorite thing to do. It’s usually Garth’s job, but Garth is working the Saturday shift and has today off, and Cesar is in the garage with Bobby working on an old station wagon.
“Well, actually, they hired me on as an editor, but I don’t want to get away from my writing, so I asked to take on some journalism assignments as well. This is my first one.” Cas is shy, but Dean can also sense the pride he possesses in mentioning his career.
He drops his backpack from his shoulders and slides into the passenger seat of the car.
“Goodbye, Dean.”
Dean watches him leave and cleans up the remainder of the trash, tossing it into a nearby trash can. The wind blows and a shiver runs from his feet up through his spine, reminding him that he needs to get home and soon. He pops the collar on his leather jacket and pulls it tight around him. The temperature feels like it just dropped several degrees and he quickly jogs to his car, eager to escape the cold.
Mildred finally parts ways, promising to bring Dean some of her homemade apple fritters next week.
“What brings you in tonight?”
Dean ignores the way his chest constricts when hearing about Charlie again, and the coinciding disappointment he feels is stupid and pointless. He knows the guy’s got a girlfriend, so why does it still feel shitty every time Cas mentions her?
“I can’t find him anywhere. He just took off running and I couldn’t keep up! Oh God, she’s going to kill me. I need to find him.” The man’s words tumble out in a rush while he runs a hand through his hair (ah - so that’s why it looks like the dude just rolled out of a good night in bed).
Castiel glances at him and quirks a half-smile. “Am I that obvious?”
He takes a few more minutes to finish his beer. Before he leaves, he catches Benny’s eye and gives him a nod from across the room, not daring to tempt Ellen’s patience considering he doesn’t yet know Ash’s fate. He flashes a twenty-dollar bill and puts it on the counter with a flirtatious wink, placing his empty bottle on top, and then he’s out the door.
a sure thing, alright? But I wasn’t, apparently.” There’s a beat of silence as Jo takes in what he said. “Besides, you didn’t even find anyone for me, did you?” Jess snorts a laugh and nearly falls off the stool. Sam is there to catch her and he manages to look annoyed yet amused at the same time.
Bending down to pet the dog, a young puppy by the looks of him, Dean expects him to get a couple of curious sniffs in before taking off again in search of something or someone more exciting, but the put doesn’t leave. Instead, he keeps nuzzling up to Dean, wagging his tail and practically begging for attention as he winds in and around Dean’s legs. The puppy has a reddish tone to his otherwise sandy-brown fur and big, floppy ears, and is so adorable that even Dean ultimately can’t resist dropping down to his knees to play with the little guy.
“Dean?” Cas speaks up before he can make his move. “Um, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to grab a beer with me. If you aren’t busy, of course. Charlie doesn’t need the wine for at least another hour or so and there’s this brewery we visited a few weeks ago that I’ve been wanting to --”
While Dean processes this information, the guy looks up and they make eye contact through the shop’s windows. They hold a stare for a moment and then, without thinking, Dean lifts his hand in a silent wave. The guy tilts his head ever so slightly to the side and tentatively returns the gesture, but he doesn’t smile.
Dean walks to the front and steps out onto the sidewalk, the blue-eyed man already out of sight. In his place he finds that there’s a bright rainbow arching across the sky and he shakes his head as he smiles to himself.
“You got somewhere you need to be?” Dean asks casually, partly because he’s genuinely curious and partly because small talk seems like the polite thing to do, friendly customer service and all that.
Okay then, Dean should steer clear of the girlfriend talk. Got it.
He nudges at a pair of boots sticking out from under the belly of a 1987 Ford F-150, but when there’s no immediate response, he gives the bottom of the left boot a swift kick.
It’s not that he’s not good with customers, because he is - he’s charming as hell when he needs to be. It’s just that he’d much rather be elbows deep in the hood of a car than plastering on a sometimes-fake smile while handling walk-ins at the front desk, taking phone calls, and filling out customer forms all day. Customer service is exhausting in a way that cars never are. Cars don’t give an attitude or make unreasonable demands. Cars don’t get emotional or ask stupid questions. Cars just… are. They’re like puzzles and figuring out what’s wrong with them is just as satisfying as fixing them. So yeah, the front desk sucks.
Dean reluctantly heads to the kitchen to find Bobby red in the face and stuck somewhere between frustrated and horrified while Sam stands against the wall dumbfounded, several bowls of tomato bisque turned upside down on the floor between them. Dean doesn’t wait to be told what’s going on and immediately jumps into action, directing Sam to help clean the mess while he and Bobby get another batch started in record time. This is the type of situation in which Dean thrives - one where others look to him for help, where he can be a leader and problem solver, and where he can turn a potentially disastrous situation right side up again.
Sam has been so buried in his law books lately that if he’s actually considering a moment away, no one would dare deny him.
Dean’s closest friends and family know that he essentially swings both ways. It’s not something he necessarily wears on his sleeve, but he doesn’t hide it from them either. There was a time when he was younger that he felt shame in the fact that he was interested in men in the same way he was interested in women. Then, one evening when he was in his late teens and heavily influenced by one Mr. Jack Daniels, there came an unexpected confession to Sam about his bisexuality. It was immediately followed by Sam’s unprejudiced acceptance and, ever since that night, the weight of it didn’t sit so heavily on his shoulders anymore. He hadn’t realized how much he genuinely feared Sam’s judgement and disappointment until the moment he realized he didn’t have it, and after that, no one else’s opinion really mattered in comparison. From that point on in his life, he’s always surrounded himself with people who accept him exactly as he is and he’s never looked back or felt the need to apologize for himself.
“Dare I ask?” Cas has an inquisitive eyebrow raised now.
“Jeeze, Cas. Keep sweet talking like that and Ellen will come find you and smother you with all that hometown charm you seemed to love so much. She does that, and there will be no escape for you.”
“Anyway, thank you for… well… just thanks.” He looks up through his lashes at Dean, his eyes bluer than an hour ago, if that’s even possible, and lifts the corner of his mouth in a barely-there shadow of a smile.
“Well, if you--” His words are cut short when Castiel starts speaking at the same time while making a move to get to his feet.
What’s his deal, anyway? He seems worried, maybe even scared, though that might be a bit presumptuous. Dean briefly wonders if he’s homeless, but he’s not so sure. There’s just something about him, something
“I didn’t know until tonight, okay? Like I said, we briefly met at the dog beach when he thought he had lost his dog. It’s not like we shared our life stories. After we recognized each other and I found out about his day job, I figured it would be best not to spread the information until after he was gone - you know how Jo and Ellen can get. They didn’t need the extra pressure tonight.”
The stranger looks up at Dean, concerned. “You think it’ll come back tonight? The rain?” Dean detects worry behind the words.
“I just moved here not too long ago and I’ve never spent much time at a beach. I am clearly very unprepared for such an experience, but Charlie asked if I could bring Seb here and I couldn’t tell her no. She’s very persuasive when she wants something.”
“I think
Castiel extends his arm again for an impersonal yet professional handshake. Dean complies and smiles through it.
“I should actually get going. I’ve already been here much longer than expected.” He stands, brushing the sand off of his hands and jeans the best he can, Dean following his lead.
Cas smiles brightly at him for the briefest moment before he schools his face back to a look that is far more reserved, though Dean still notices the faint pink hue that brushes across Cas’s cheeks. Dean hands him over the menu and lets him know that his server will be someone named Alfie. Cas thanks him and Dean has to will himself to walk away. This is basically a business setting and no matter how much he might want to strike up a conversation with the guy, now is certainly not the time.
It’s a gorgeous day along the Southern California coastline, seventy-seven degrees in early April and with the type of breeze brushing through the air that provides a satisfying sweep of cool air without being bothersome. The sun is out and so are the runners, bikers, hipsters, surfers, and dog owners.  The atmosphere is cheerful, bright and lively. Some would call it picturesque, but not Dean Winchester. Dean simply calls it
Cas tilts his head again before another half-smile makes its way from his lips to his eyes.
The wind screams and the rain bites sharp at his face, yet a faint warmth wraps around his shoulders, feeling like a blanket where there is none. It seems to be coming from the man next to him. Dean can’t explain it, but the force encircles and shelters him. He should be afraid. He should be running for cover or preparing to fight, but instead, he faces the furious, fiery power before him with tranquil assuredness. He is protected.
Bobby lets out a bark of laughter. “Well would ya look at that. You’re funny sometimes, too.”
The four of them laugh their way down the street. Sam and Jess crawl into the backseat and Jo settles in the passenger side. Dean makes threats about no one upchucking in his Baby, but the drive home is thankfully uneventful. He drops Jo off first and they say their goodnights. When he pulls away from Jo’s, he looks in the rearview mirror and can see that Jess has fallen asleep on Sam’s shoulder. She’s snoring slightly and looks completely unattractive with her mouth hanging open and her hair a mess, but Sam is as content as he can possibly be, so he chooses not to say anything and keeps his phone in his pocket despite the excellent opportunity for blackmail material. He smiles at Sam through the mirror and heads off down the road.
“Yeah. Sorry. Hello,” he responds, hoping it wasn’t obvious that he was staring.
“Of course I will. I already planned on bringing them coffee and bagels in the morning. I’ll tell them then.”
It’s a small, two bedroom home, sitting on the same property as Singer Auto. Bobby had it built for himself when he was a bachelor and just getting his business up and running, but when he married Jody, they moved into a larger home across town. Bobby used it as a sort of combined office space and storage unit after that… until Dean came along and needed Bobby’s help. Dean’s been living there ever since, going on three years now. It’s not a glamorous living, that’s for sure, but Dean could do a whole lot worse. And he almost did.
“Hey man. I’m sorry but we just closed up shop for the night,” he apologizes.
“Then what’s the issue?” Dean pins Steve with a friendly but challenging look. When Steve blankly stares back, Dean elaborates. “Listen, the extra food was for a friend of mine who was supposed to meet me here. He couldn’t make it but I had already ordered. And the chowder isn’t nearly as good reheated, it deserves to be savored hot and fresh.” It’s only a partial lie.
“No?”
“Okay. Alright. It’ll be fine. I’ll help you look. What does your dog look like?” Dean’s problem solving instincts kick in and he immediately gets into leader-mode.
“Just a little.”  Dean means to make a joke or some sarcastic comment to keep the mood light, but the words never come. Instead, he catches himself staring at Castiel for just a second too long, mesmerized by his husky voice and the blue in his eyes. He’s about to feel embarrassed for the prolonged eye contact, but then realizes that Castiel is starting right back at him. Dean breaks the eye contact first, and Castiel seems to shake himself back to the present.
Sam, Jess, Jo, and Dean all lose themselves in each other’s company. Before long, the bottle of Jack is unveiled and passed around as time escapes them. It’s one of the best nights Dean’s had in awhile, the kind of night that leaves him feeling full, loved, and happy. It’s also probably the last night that Sam will allow himself to relax and enjoy the company of others for quite some time - his BAR Exam is in early July and it’s not likely that he’ll come up for air again before then. Dean’s missed his brother over the past few months as his studying has taken over his life, but he’s proud of Sam in a way that makes his chest swell and his eyes prickle.
Steve is standing in front of him now, hand extended. Dean accepts it, the handshake firm and deceptively confident, but it’s the eyes that give him away. His hands are soft and solid, not calloused and rough like Dean’s own, and they are surprisingly warm despite the cold air. Dean finds himself holding on perhaps a second too long, captivated by the way Steve’s long fingers gently envelope his palm. “It was nice to meet you, Steve.”
Dean is eager to get Castiel settled and comfortable as quickly as possible. Not only is the fluttering feeling in his chest at seeing him again unnerving, but Dean absolutely isn’t about to be the one to screw up a major opportunity for Ellen and Bobby, even if they probably have no idea about it.
“When I’m writing a piece, I usually don’t discuss my opinions until it’s published, but just between you and me, I will say that I have to agree with you, so I won’t be betting against you anytime soon,” he answers, voice lowered as if he’s letting Dean in on a secret.
No. I couldn’t be. There’s no way his stranger would have been able to travel from San Senton to Bagyo Bay on foot in just a few hours. Maybe he has a car?
“What?” Steve’s eyes grow wider than before as he looks down at the bowl of soup Dean is pulling from the brown bag. He’s at a loss for words, but quickly declines. “No. No, thank you.”
After running through the morning routine and before switching on the neon ‘OPEN’ sign, he hurries out back to check the truck for water damage, not that he expects any. It wasn’t much of a storm last night, more like a quick downpour before it moved on, but another, much larger surge is expected to hit sometime tonight. He’s reinforcing some knots when he’s interrupted.
. He learned his lesson after a windstorm swept through a few months back. The dirt and debris were hell to clean.
Cas cracks a barely-there smile, but it’s enough to bring a softness to his features. “Is that supposed to be a threat? Because it certainly doesn’t sound like one.”
The bisque debacle is handled with relative ease and Bobby doesn’t strangle Sam in the process, so Dean’s gonna call this an overall win. He stays in the kitchen a little while longer to help with other miscellaneous tasks and he lets Bobby bark orders at him until things feel back to normal.
“Hiya, Cas! Fancy meeting you here.” Castiel’s eyes flare wide at the moment of recognition, and Dean feels proud of himself for remembering his name; it doesn’t matter that he’s had the guy’s face in his mind since they walked away from one another at the beach, no one needs to know that part, but
“Well I’m glad he was out making friends while I was losing my mind shouting his name.” The sarcastic tone makes Dean chuckle.
(Yet Dean usually finds him in the shop on Sundays “making exceptions” anyway).
Steve looks stunned as Dean then pulls a sandwich out and sets it on top of the bowl. Satisfied that he’s managed to make it this far, he pulls the second brown bag into his lap and takes out his own bowl of soup and sandwich, setting the two water bottles down between them.
“Alright.” Sam interrupts. “I think it’s time I take this one home. She’s had enough for tonight. In fact, she had enough a few drinks ago.”
“I can only hope to be so lucky. I swear he’s got more energy than should be legal.”
Before he can make an attempt to rectify it, Cas is already making his exit. “Yes, well, thanks again for your hospitality - I should be going now. I don’t want to take up any more of your time.” There’s an annoyed tilt to his response and Dean secretly berates himself for causing it.
Sam shrugs. “I saw you talking to a dude in a maroon blazer. He was carrying a shoulder bag. You seemed familiar with him, is all.” Dean doesn’t miss the way that Sam is being careful with his words here.
“Nice to officially meet you, Steve. So, what brings you out here? You a tourist?” Although he thinks he knows the answer, he’s not going to assume the guy’s a vagrant. Maybe he’s just a lonely passerby. Or he’s lost. Or he’s any number of other things.
“Oh yeah. Of course. I was about to do the same before Zaz made a new best friend.” He turns to look back out at the dogs, whistles, and calls for them. “Zaz! Come!” She may be a big goofy ball of fur, but at least Sam taught her to obey commands quite well. Sure enough, Zaz turns direction and races towards Dean, Seb following closely behind. When the dogs reach them, Dean and Castiel attach the leashes, ready to head home.
As Dean walks away, he hears Ellen address Castiel; “Hiya honey. Everything to your liking? Can I get you anything?” He turns to see Ellen patting him on the shoulder.
“Hey! You two knuckleheads knock it off and let’s get this thing over and done with already. I’ve got work to do,” Bobby gripes from his seat. Ellen comes back to the table from the kitchen to sit down next to him. Jess scoots a little closer to Sam, and Jo takes her own seat. Dean grabs his laptop and to try and lighten the nervous tension, he asks for a drumroll as he opens it up to the article. Jo, Sam, and Jess oblige by pounding on the table in front of them as Dean dramatically clears his throat to read aloud.
Dean’s adoptive sister, Jo, and longtime family friend, Ash, are both here helping as well, Jo waiting on tables and Ash working his magic behind the bar. The popularity of this pre-opening can largely be attributed to those two (but if anyone asks Bobby, which no one really does, they are the ones to
“What grade do you teach? With the paint and glitter, I’m guessing… kindergarten? Maybe first grade?” The question is sincere and Dean feels excitement behind his ribs at Cas’s interest.
He’s always been the kind of guy that’s appreciated a satisfying random hookup now and again, and finding someone to spend the night with has never been a problem for Dean, but over the past two years or so, the desire to slip between the sheets with someone who may or may not remember his name the next morning has become less and less of a priority. He’s noticed himself staying at home more often than going out, and on more than one occasion he’s found himself providing an excuse rather than accepting an offer on the table. Honestly, it’s been such a gradual change that he hasn’t much thought about it… until recently. His friends have made offhanded and playful comments about his lack of extracurricular activities, and while that doesn’t really bother him, he can no longer deny the underlying buzz of
“So! Where’s miss can’t-hold-her-liquor barbie? Did she have to get back to the sorority house?”
“He’s just fine. Apparently, ‘that’s just the way he is,’ according to Charlie.” Cas uses air-quotes and Dean wants to laugh and call him adorable, but with some effort, he refrains from doing either. “She basically laughed at me when I told her that I nearly had a breakdown when he took off out of my sight. I feel a bit like an idiot, but now I know better, I guess.”
“It’s only going to get worse as it gets closer. This is why I couldn’t just leave you out there.”
Sliding to take Jo’s spot on the stool, he spins himself back to face the small table, trying to ignore the thrum of nervousness buzzing under his skin. When he looks up, he comes face to face with Sam, who is now also sitting directly across from him, having snuck in to steal Jess’s vacated seat. He also sees that in the brief moment of shifting bodies, Ash somehow managed to find himself a few tables over and talking with two beautiful young women. There are smiles all around and Ash’s laugh rings out clear across the bar. Good for him.
stranger, obviously, but all the same, he wonders. He scans the shops and business, especially the eateries, looking to spot the dude, mindlessly hoping he’s had at least one decent meal today.
“You shut your face and just sit here and look pretty. Jess and I are going to work reconnaissance, so now’s your last chance - preference?” Jo is not what Dean would consider a lightweight in terms of her alcohol intake capabilities, but even he can tell she’s already feeling pretty good. He silently guesses that she gave herself a bit of a head start before leaving the Roadhouse.
“Hey Dean-O! I was wonderin’ if I’d see you tonight! Been a minute, man.”
He dreams of a storm. There’s bright lightning and thunder strong enough to shake the earth beneath his feet and make his chest rumble. He doesn’t recognize where he is - some kind of shed, or maybe a barn. He hears more than he feels a rush of wind followed by a startling bang. The barn doors slam open and standing on the other side is a tall, dark haired man in a long coat. Dean can’t quite make out his face.
Before long, the downpour eases up and as if by magic, the clouds begin to clear and the sky brightens.
Jo takes the opportunity to chime in. “Oh! Let me be your wingman! Do you have a preference for what type of equipment you’re looking to service tonight? Or is this an open bar type of situation?” She gives him a conspiratorial look accompanied by a mischievous wink. “Come on, I need to know what we’re working with here. The night’s not getting any younger and we need to get you laid!”
What was he dreaming about, before being rudely awaken?
He had tried to ignore it for years, to find reasons, he let his own self-esteem convince him that it meant nothing. But it was the complete opposite, actually.
Dean was blushing so hard, he could feel it. The hallway seemed too narrow suddenly, too hot, and looking at Castiel was too much. He was dreaming again, wasn’t he?
Seeing the Empty reach Cas, taking him away, seemed to flip some kind of switch.
For the upper half however, he didn’t really know how to describe his surroundings in another way than Big Fat Nothing.
Hoping that he was right, Dean kept going, twisting around so that he would be the last to leave the Empty.
If he failed, if Castiel didn’t come back, he didn’t know what he would do.
If there was one thing Dean knew right now, it was that he couldn’t lose him again.
Dean rolled around in bed, groaning, trying to block out the sound of whoever was knocking on his door so loudly. Just when he was about to fall back asleep, a voice joined the knocking, causing him to curse basically every known entity.
“Cas!”
Still trying to look around something that was literally impossible to look at, something finally caught his eyes.
Suddenly, he had a handful of Cas in his arms again, but before he had time to react, he felt lips press against his.
“I got two tickets to Iron Maiden.”
His brain didn’t seem to be able to catch up with his eyes fast enough.
It only seemed fitting that Castiel asked Dean to go to prom with him the Friday after, while they were jumping around and holding hands, listening to Iron Maiden.
He didn’t even care that those words he had kept hidden, so deep, for so long, were finally out in the open.
He let a small smile stretch his lips.
Dean turned the volume of the radio up, drowning out whatever Sam was going to say next in the sound of the electric guitars.
The expression on Sam’s face when Dean finally came down was so smug that he nearly decided to leave him here. He had long legs, he could walk to school. But Dean didn’t stop, speeding in front of his brother.
Cas’ scent immediately overwhelmed Dean’s senses, his hair tickling Dean’s chin.
“Why did you wake up so late anyway? Is your alarm broken? Did you throw it out of the window again?”
“Whatever…”
But then, slowly, as if he was breaking the surface of a lake, the rest of him appeared. His torso. His legs. His face.
He didn’t think he could find the words, but he needed Cas to understand. He had been so close to losing everything.
“So don’t you dare start now!”
Blue eyes.
Not immediately being thrown back out, or feeling an unbearable pain, he allowed himself to quickly assess the situation.
He sobbed, a heart that couldn’t possibly be broken any more than it had already been somehow still being crushed to pieces:
“Yeah, yeah, fine, go get dressed.”
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
He always had this fantasy, about him and Castiel, simply lying on his bed, or sitting on the hood of his car, listening to Iron Maiden. It was dumb, because Iron Maiden didn’t even seem like the type of music that Castiel would enjoy. He looked so soft, with his shirts and sweaters, his blue jeans, and white shoes, he probably listened to stuff like Debussy, or some indie band that literally no one knew the name of.
Relieved that Cas was there, awake, and acknowledging him, he spread his fingers, every part of him begging Cas to take his hand.
