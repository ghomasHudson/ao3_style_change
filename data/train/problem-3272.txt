Cas busies himself getting them something to sleep in, urging Dean under the covers once they’re both dressed, on their sides, face to face. They lie there in charged silence for a while, flipping between staring at one another and letting their eyes dart away self-consciously. He can’t help but think that someone’s gotta say
A couple of episodes in, Castiel can sense Dean’s attention waning, his posture relaxing as he dozes off and slips down from his sitting position. He seems to be incrementally pressing himself closer to Castiel, as if to get more comfortable, in a way that Castiel can’t be sure is unconscious. He lets Dean sleep this time, turns the television off and carefully extricates himself, exiting the room as quietly as possible.
Dean hides it a little better this time, but there’s still something noticeably stiff in his frame, something about that question that makes him uneasy. “Actually,” he says, clearing his throat. “I thought maybe we could do a little more research first.”
But Cas is unmoved by Dean’s lack of subtlety, simply reaches back down and starts to work Dean back up, his touch steady and sure. He doesn’t even need to be told when Dean’s close, just eases off and resituates himself further up Dean’s body, knees tucked up against either side of Dean’s chest, his cock tantalizingly close to Dean’s mouth. Dean tries to part his lips and lean in but Cas threads his fingers through Dean’s hair and grips tight, keeps himself just out of Dean’s reach. Dean whimpers at the tease – he wants to pull Cas closer, dig his fingers into those gorgeous thighs and relish the feeling of Cas sliding hot along his tongue, but he resolutely keeps his hands where they are and doesn’t press his luck.
and he finds himself floundering for a second because he hasn’t really thought that part through. Maybe he should have done some research of his own.
Dean’s wary about those kinds of displays in public, though; Castiel understands and respects that. No matter how strong the urge is to let any interested parties know that displaying said interest is futile, that pursuing Dean is a misguided notion they’d be better off forgetting.
His threat is pure bluster, an obvious bluff – being with Cas is well worth waiting for, and, well, sometimes it’s even better when the tension has a chance to build before they act on it. Dean’s got a suspicion that Cas likes making him wait, might even be doing it on purpose at the moment and, well, Dean might like that a little bit too.
. He leans even further into Dean’s space, his touches technically not indecent but skirting the line for sure. Dean would be embarrassed by it if he weren’t in the same boat himself; he’s damn easy for it, spreads his legs wider for Cas’s wandering fingers, tilts his head just so for Cas to nuzzle at his pulse point, pressing a kiss there that’s too soft for the way it gets Dean going.
“What?” Dean asks, his chest tightening at Cas’s stern tone. Shit, Dean went out on a limb even bringing it up, suggesting that they put it behind them, swallowing his hurt feelings and embarrassment enough to manage giving Cas a call.
Dean could bury his face, mumble some vague answer, and Cas wouldn’t push the issue, but he’s not about to chicken out now. “I’m usually alone when I do this. And I feel like—” he stops to think about it, to find terms that get the point across but don’t mortify him in the process. “Like I’m getting away with something. Like I’m doing something I’m not supposed to but it’s such a
Dean swallows hard, overwhelmed by a rush of vulnerability that he wouldn’t have predicted when Charlie first sidled up to him with a conspiratorial gleam in her eyes. It might be nice to feel normal for once. Dean’s life is already so far removed from normal to begin with, but that’s something he came to terms with a long time ago. It’s just this particular part he’s still working on. As much as he’d like to say otherwise, those hang-ups aren’t entirely behind him, but he’s come pretty far, and now that he’s opened his mind to the idea, he has to admit that Charlie’s made a lot of good points. Besides, at the end of the day, it just feels idiotic to keep the best thing that’s ever happened to him hidden away like a shameful secret.
He even goes so far as to outright refuse to go into the basement in case Cas is there, no matter how much Sam whines that he needs help moving some boxes.
Castiel can feel Dean’s eyes on him at key points in the show’s plot, looking for a reaction – or, sometimes, glancing in his direction for seemingly no reason at all, darting away as soon as Castiel dares to glance back.
Cas watches him carefully, thumb tracing the ridge of Dean’s cheekbone. “I’m not asking you to say anything.”
Dean tries again to snap himself out of it, to remind himself that there’s a job here – or that the very least, that he needs to prove that there isn’t one. “What makes this guy so sure it wasn’t, y’know, a
Castiel lets his hand rest low on Dean’s stomach, sliding over the temptingly bare spot where his shirt’s ridden up. He knows that Dean is awake too – knows from the outward physical signs, the way he stirs slightly, the rhythm of his breath faltering before evening out. But he knows it on a deeper level too, the part of him that’s still an angel and in tune with these things, especially with Dean.
Cas pulls him in for a kiss, pouring everything he has into it, and Dean’s scrambling to keep up, fingers clutching at Cas’s belt, winding around his tie to get him
Once again, it’s working a case that ends up testing his patience the most. Being on the road is always a mine field that way – interacting with new people, tensions running high, less time alone with Dean if Sam’s sharing the motel room with them.
“So do you,” Castiel replies, because Dean deserves that compliment and many more besides. He leans in to get his mouth on Dean’s jaw, his neck, his collarbones. “You feel incredible. You
“If you want,” Cas says after a short pause, trying to appear nonchalant. It might be convincing if he didn’t know Cas so well.
Dean tenses, thinking Cas must be fucking with him. He glances over his shoulder warily. "What?" He honestly never thought he'd hear those words out of Cas's mouth, no matter how often Dean has been
“You’re not the only one enjoying yourself, Dean. I’m—” He falters for a moment, and Dean can see him carefully choosing his words. “I’m so
When they turn in for the evening, Cas is settling in the bedroom while Dean shuts himself in the bathroom, brushing his teeth far longer than necessary, mind working overtime wondering what’ll be different about tonight. If anything.
It used to be a novelty for Dean to wake up feeling so warm and content, such a rare occurrence that he could easily count the number of instances on one hand. But this is his normal every day now, blinking into awareness with his face tucked against Cas’s neck, Cas’s arm loosely encircling his waist, utterly at peace. He’s loathe to move at all, but he adjusts his position only so his head’s resting more comfortably on Cas’s chest. He’d be perfectly happy to stay just like this for at least another hour, no desire or requirement to face the day just yet, but he only has a moment to enjoy the steady rise and fall of Cas’s breathing before he wakes too.
For a brief, sinking moment, Dean thinks he must have been dreaming after all. Of course this was too good to be true. But this—
capable of overpowering him, but it was more dangerous too, not always a risk he was willing to take. But Cas is so
“They never do, do they?” Dean agrees, nodding vaguely. His brain’s a little mushy, so it takes a few seconds to register what Sam just said. “Wait, there’s a security camera in that room?” He really tries to keep his tone at a level of mild interest, but he can tell it didn’t work when Sam finally shoots him a funny look.
“Okay,” Dean repeats inanely, huffing out a laugh but quickly sobering because yeah, this… this is a thing that’s about to happen.
That was exactly the thing for Dean – there was no particular moment, no ground-breaking epiphany that made him realize, made him
Too soon they break the spell and take a step back to assess the damage. The window’s looking a little worse for wear, glass streaked up with come and fingerprints and even – most mortifying of all, somehow – a faint outline of
Dean takes it upon himself to get this show on the road, nipping at Cas’s lips, earning a sharp bite and a
Cas makes a sad, thoughtful noise, and Dean knows he understands, that they’ll save the talk about the more emotional stuff for another day.
in return. Dean breaks the kiss only to gasp, “Yeah, Cas, c’mon,” wanting to encourage him, to make it abundantly clear that oh, yes, this is what he wants tonight. Dean hums into it eagerly when Cas kisses him again, redoubling his efforts, holding him tighter, one hand sliding down to Dean’s ass and squeezing firmly, proprietary. The thrust of Cas’s tongue is more demanding now, and he breaks away to kiss along Dean’s chin, teeth grazing his jawline, sucking marks into his throat.
“Anyone ever—” he attempts. He sighs, takes a moment to collect himself. “Anyone ever, y’know, look at you funny? Like, if you’re out with a… girlfriend or something.”
But that’s not fair. Dean’s too needy, and this is too messy already. Even now he’s watching Cas’s fingers resting against the reflective metal and wondering what it would be like to hold Cas’s hand. “No,” he says, abrupt, shaking his head at himself more than anything else. “I’m good.”
“Okay,” Dean says, deceptively upbeat, making a show of placing his coffee cup on the roof of the car. “I’ll come to you then.” He barely takes one step in the dude’s direction before he visibly recoils, damn near tripping over his feet backing away and scrambling into his car.
“Maybe another time,” Dean says, pulling Cas closer. Castiel’s intrigued by the possibility, but he remains focused on the task at hand. “Need you to do a lot more than look right now.”
“I don’t understand why you feign indifference,” Cas says, eyes flicking towards Dean’s as he presses a kiss over Dean’s heart. “We both know you’re eager for this,” he adds, hands sliding to Dean’s ass and squeezing. Dean flushes a bit, but doesn’t deny it. “
He ducks right into the bedroom when he’s ready, avoiding seeing Cas but hearing his footsteps approach the bathroom, followed by the sound of the lock clicking closed. He sheds whatever clothing he can get away with quickly and pulls out the first comfortable thing he finds when he reaches into the dresser, undressed and in bed in record time.
Cas hums again, and the sound of it gives Dean goosebumps. “Dean,” he says, amusement creeping into his voice. “Are you suggesting we share body heat?”
“Right,” Castiel says reflexively, trying not to let his eyes linger on the stray water droplets clinging to Dean’s neck.
“I’ll, uh—” Dean attempts, genuinely unsure how to respond to such a blatant invitation, especially with Cas right next to him. He glances in Cas’s direction, and the look in his eyes makes Dean swallow hard, stomach flipping, almost entirely forgetting what he was going to say. “I’ll keep that in mind.”
“Good night, Dean,” Cas says, sounding just as pleased as Dean feels, palm resting flat and warm against Dean’s back.
than enough. He’s not just willing to settle for it, it’s what he wants. If letting go of some trappings of divinity means he gets to be more wholly devoted to Dean, if that’s a choice he has to make, it’s an easy one.
“I read about some disappearances around here three years ago,” Cas says after a stretch of silence, thoughtfully rearranging his cards. Dean hasn’t even picked up his hand yet. “Two newlyweds vanished on their honeymoon in July, then a nature photographer a few months later. It doesn’t seem too likely that they’re related, but I suppose it’s possible. What do you think?”
, like he sometimes does when they’re in the presence of others. That difference is always intriguing to Castiel, and it’s tempting to see what else Dean will allow when they’re away from prying eyes.
Words can be powerful, devastating, uplifting, but they’re not the only thing that matters. The way Dean pulls him in and kisses him, the way he’s welcomed Castiel into his life and given him his trust, that’s more than enough.
His hand just barely slips beneath the worn fabric of Dean’s shirt, but he doesn’t follow through on the suggestion of undressing Dean. He just lets his palm rest there heavily, his grip on Dean’s hip sure and firm, fingers cool against Dean’s overheated skin. Dean’s properly hard now, and Cas’s thumb tracing aimless patterns so close to where his body is screaming for touch might actually do him in.
When they part, Cas gazes at him fondly, gloved hand cupping Dean’s cheek. “That’s a much better reward than a sack of gold.”
“So y’know, we could see if there’s anything on their social media that might help,” he explains with a veneer of confidence that seems thin in Castiel’s eyes. “Twitter, Instagram, uh… Facebook? Do kids still use Facebook?”
He thought Dean might pretend to be insulted by the comment – although it is undoubtedly a true statement – but he definitely detects a spark of interest in Dean’s eyes that warrants further investigation. He turns on his heel and heads outside before Dean can try to get the last word in. It occurs to Castiel belatedly that he could start a fire with a thought, and he’s strangely pleased that it didn’t seem to cross Dean’s mind either. There’s a line for Castiel between wanting to feel useful and only being seen as important for his powers.
He starts shivering audibly in the dark, praying that Cas has fallen asleep by now, but knowing his luck is never that good.
He’s pulled from his thoughts when Cas catches his eye again, still smiling. “Let’s sleep here tonight,” he offers holding out a beckoning hand to Dean.
Dean relaxes with his head resting on Castiel’s stomach, and Castiel takes a moment just to observe him fondly, running gentle fingers through his hair. “That was
Dean swings the fridge door open with the intention of blocking her out, but now that she’s got him thinking about it, staring morosely at a sad-looking leftover sandwich, he’s not sure why he’s being so resistant either. Maybe it’s still a force of habit, being contrary and grumpy for the sake of appearances, no matter how obvious it is that it’s just an act. Even he doesn’t entirely understand why he does the things he does, but that doesn’t exactly stop him.
there’d probably be a dance floor too and he is not at all prepared to get swept up in a giant mass of sweaty bodies. Dean genuinely thinks he might be in over his head, but just as he’s contemplating a daring escape, they roll to a stop at their destination.
Dean needs a shower, for obvious reasons, and hell, he feels like his mind could use a good scrubbing too, because apparently it’s too filthy to function properly.
Dean looks at Cas again, gaze traveling shamelessly along his strong jaw, his broad shoulders, and licks his lips. God, of all things for Sheriff Douchebag to call him out for – yeah, he
They both choose the same moment to gradually pull away, although Castiel would be content to stay like that for quite a long time, feeling their hearts beating in sync. He suspects that Dean feels the same.
The bad vibes only get worse when he and Cas drive out to the county office to touch base with the sheriff.
Cas stares at Dean in consideration. “All right,” he says eventually, voice deep and agreeable and god, fucking
Dean doesn’t really pretend to be accomplishing anything here, just runs his soapy hands along Cas’s firm chest. He presses a kiss to Cas’s throat because he can’t resist, but he follows Cas’s lead and doesn’t escalate. Cas lets out a pleased hum, barely audible over the spray, but a tingling buzz beneath Dean’s lips. He breathes Cas’s name when Cas reciprocates; the answering kiss on his neck is almost chaste, but the feeling of his stubble scratching Dean’s sensitive skin is electrifying.
thing, putting him back together again after dismantling him so expertly (and okay, fine, Dean likes it too. Kind of a lot.)
Dean doesn’t miss the challenge in Cas’s eyes and he makes an attempt to match it, even though he’s admittedly a little thrown off here. “And what are you gonna do?” he asks, raising an eyebrow. “You just gonna sit there?” Dean can’t fucking believe this – he’s about two seconds from dragging Cas onto the bed or at least climbing into the chair with him because
Of course, he can only anticipate Dean so much. There are certain things Dean might have buried so deeply that even he might not know exactly what he’s after, or what he’s comfortable admitting to.
“Uh,” he fumbles, starts and stops again, trying to focus on the case. “Cameras? You got cameras here?”
then Cas abruptly takes his hand away, and Dean’s thrown off by being left in the lurch, hips twitching up into nothing as Cas runs his hand up and down Dean’s heaving chest, crooning endearments his ear as he settles back down.
Castiel takes that under advisement when the opportunity presents itself. When Dean sleepily curls up beside him, Castiel allows a few minutes to pass, wondering if he’ll wake up on his own. Dean only slides further down the headboard and closer to Castiel, head practically in his lap.
“How dare you,” Dean fires back, his attempt at righteous indignation undercut by the way he yawns and cuddles closer to Cas, his eyelids drooping. He’s got a whole rant lined up –
Dean can feel excitement bubbling up within him as Cas closes the distance, steps up right behind him, tantalizingly near, but not quite touching. Cas reaches a hand out over Dean’s shoulder and presses a palm to the glass, muscled arm boxing Dean in.
“Hmm,” Dean muses, closing his eyes and tucking his face against the crook of Castiel’s neck, arm tightening around his waist, already drifting off. “Surprise me.”
, this unfathomably powerful celestial being just swept into Dean’s life like a hurricane, exactly when Dean needed him the most.
Castiel had never thought of his hands as anything special – they were utilitarian, if anything, adequately skilled and strong, capable as they needed to be. They were reliable in combat, useful for practical reasons, but nothing much more profound than that.
,” Cas replies in frustration, voice dipping into a growl and goddamn, that’s so hot, Dean’s just as weak for that voice as ever. Cas keeps shoving forward insistently, cock riding so close to where Dean really wants it, like Cas wants inside
Dean supposes that with his record of acting in complete opposition to how he actually feels, Cas’s hesitance was probably justified. “How long have— When did you know it was like that for you?” he asks, not sure what he wants the answer to be.
Castiel clears his throat against the urge to cup Dean’s face in his hands, stroke his fingers through Dean’s hair, though his suspicions that Dean would welcome that are almost entirely confirmed. “I’m saying good night now.”
Dean’s face is nestled against Cas’s neck and he can’t resist leaving a few slow kisses there, loving the rasp of Cas’s stubble when he drags his lips along Cas’s jawline. Cas stirs sleepily, a low groan bubbling up from his throat, so deep that Dean feels the reverberation beneath his lips. It’s late enough into the morning that Cas allows his eyes to flutter open instead of grumping at Dean to go back to sleep for another hour, and Dean meets his gaze for just a moment before leaning in to kiss his pulse point. There’s nothing but miles of bare skin at his disposal and he can’t help but take advantage, nudging this scenario in a direction it was bound to go anyway, an inevitable result of them wrapped up together in bed, legs intertwined. It’s easy enough to shift until he’s more fully on top of Cas, squarely situated between his sturdy thighs.
“Good night, Dean,” Castiel dutifully replies as Dean slips from the room with one last glance in Castiel’s direction.
He can do that again. He can make his own luck. It’s not like he doesn’t know how to get attention if he wants it; he’s been practicing that art for decades at this point in this life. Why should he let all that talent go to waste and wait for attention to come to him?
Cas’s fingertips brush against his nipple, and he lets out a pathetic sound that Cas, thankfully, takes as encouragement. Dean arches into it as Cas teases and pinches, moaning louder – who’s going to hear him? – and reaches back to tangle his fingers in Cas’s hair.
Sure, that kind of mushy sincerity is nothing to complain about. Even if, despite how corny it is, a line like that from Cas never fails to catch him off-guard, get him flustered and blushing in public like an absolute dork. But considering that the last time someone made a remark like that to Dean, he and Cas ended up defiling a truck stop bathroom, Dean can’t help but be the tiniest bit... disappointed.
He thought they were clear on all this. He’s starting to wonder if they had a misunderstanding, if Dean’s almost explicit (or so he thought) permission to not keep those tendencies bottled up was lost on Cas, that whatever progress they’d made in helping him let go and stop berating himself wasn’t enough, and he was still holding back.
Castiel smiles at how endearingly awkward he is, how his emotions are swimming terribly close to the surface but he’s continuing anyway. “I’m glad you told me.”
he is when he rubs up against Cas’s taut stomach. He stifles a moan, bucking his hips, shamelessly chasing the friction, and fuck,
Castiel watches Dean from the chair near the bed, fascinated by the almost innocent curiosity in Dean’s eyes as he stares back at Castiel, wrapped up cozy and secure in the blankets.
There are times when Dean can’t turn around without running into Cas, but there’s other times when Dean doesn’t see Cas at all for hours on end, long periods that stretch into days, and the only way he can tell if Cas is even at home is by checking for his car in the garage.
Dean peers over his shoulder and yep, of course, it’s just his luck that some slob chose that very moment to make an appearance, standing outside his own car at the adjacent pump.
he feels even when he’s so still, his breathing soft and even, heartbeat steady, body warm beneath Castiel’s fingers. “Dean.”
He keeps going with one finger for as long as he can stand it, and when he tries to add another, Cas doesn’t stop him this time. He could cry at how good it feels, toes curling at the added stretch, contorted and totally on display for Cas, but after a while he growls in frustration again, can’t get the angle right and it’s
And it feels infinitely worse when he finally makes it to the kitchen and finds only Sam seated at the table.
And even if Dean doesn’t voice it out loud either, Castiel knows without a shadow of a doubt, can see plainly in Dean’s eyes, that he feels the way Castiel does.
that he was, and that idea alone just draws out his pleasure, spilling over his fingers and onto the sheets for what feels like ages before he finally starts to come down.
Cas usually relents here, but Dean notices the determination on his face. “If you want it,” Cas says, carefully at first, as if unsure, then gaining confidence, “Then you can ask for it.”
Castiel’s enthusiasm gets the better of him, but Dean goes with it easily when Castiel presses forward, lets himself be pushed to the floor. There’s mounting urgency in his kiss, a clear need for
It’s thrilling to see Dean like this, lost in arousal. Castiel had caught glimpses years ago, accidental stolen moments before Castiel fully understood boundaries or decorum – popped in unannounced but undetected only to catch Dean in a private moment then flitted away, contrite, when he realized what he was intruding on. He didn’t think too much of it at the time, and even later, when his feelings for Dean had undeniably changed, he tried not to dwell on it, tempting as it was. Whatever he might have seen was never meant for him.
“God,” Dean sighs, a pleasant weight against Castiel’s chest. “I haven’t done this in—” he pauses, continues with a chuckle. “Uh, ever I guess.”
like a funny story, but Charlie’s grinning, carefree and mischievous, and if it’s a tale she’s eager to tell, Dean’s definitely all ears.
does that sound like a fantastic idea, one that should be reality right this very second. It’s only been a few hours since the last time, but that’s not a deterrent at all. If anything, it only makes him crave it even more, the memory of how incredible it feels so inescapably fresh. “You wanna be inside me, Cas?”
Dean’s spending a lot more time with him than he ever has, is learning all kinds of stuff about him, the things you can only discover about a person when you’re in close, extended proximity with them. Cas is a night owl, for one, which is interesting. But that also means he’s a complete grouch in the morning, heavily reliant on coffee to get him to a point where Dean can talk to him without getting a grumble and an eyeroll in return.
Cas bristles in that familiar way, and Dean knows he’s about half a second from speaking up and putting this asshole in his place, but Dean beats him to it. “Can we help you, pal?” he asks, pleased that his voice is so steady, that he actually stands his ground as says something. It was only a short time ago that Dean would’ve ignored a guy like this completely, feeling too raw and vulnerable to find his voice, and then he would’ve felt shitty about for the rest of the afternoon. Probably longer than that.
he was doing for Dean; when he allows himself to think about it, he’s floored by the weight of it, by how far Cas has come, and that Dean was part of it. “Did you— all that stuff you said you did.” Dean pauses and swallows, hopes this isn’t a stupid question. “Did you really do it for me?”
Old, deep-seated habits tell Dean to take that sentiment as rejection, as unwillingness to deal with Dean’s emotional demands. There’s a part of him that thinks this is exactly what he feared: committing to Dean is just too much to ask.
This Sunday lived up to its name to the fullest, because the sun was shining brightly, donating rich, warm light, which made its way through the windows of Castiel's bedroom. They were rather silly this morning – Dean realized that pretty soon. Castiel insisted on feeding Dean with all kinds of food, his cheeks already hurt from grinning all the time whenever he made Castiel laugh when he nibbled on his fingers and his palm instead of the grapes or pieces of bun Castiel tried to shove into his mouth. Dean in his stead noted Castiel was terribly squeamish and ticklish – somehow a drop of jam had landed on Castiel's naked chest, and when Dean had leaned in and licked it off wickedly and allowed his hands to ghost over the lean sides, Castiel suddenly shrieked and writhed underneath him desperately, giggling and yelping at the same time. This brought them to breathless tickle fights, until Castiel practically begged Dean to stop, completely out of breath. It was still a miracle to Dean that they had managed eating anything at all.
Despite all the care taken they couldn't withstand touching the other man; Dean's hands groped Castiel's shoulders, back and firm, round butt unabashedly, and Castiel's fingers stroked Dean's sides and hips slowly, torturously. They were as closely compressed as physically possible, and their restrained caresses and touches weren't as chaste as needed. It took a while until they managed to get rid of their erections; they kissed less but stroked each other instead – however, whenever their lips collided, the fire and passion were instantly rekindled. Dean couldn't remember having felt this way before, as he clung to Castiel's body and enjoyed his little, tender fondlings. It felt as if he was burning alive, like some beast tore his chest up – and yet it felt so good, so perfect... Usually it had never been complicated – when he wanted sex, he normally found a willing partner, they got on with it and then the whole show was over. With Castiel, things were different, absurdly different even. He was content do accept what Castiel was willing to give him and to return as much; for the first time ever Dean had found someone who didn't go to bed with him instantly, and he was ready to
Full of spirit Dean splashed some holy water right into the monster's face – he received agonized cries, white smoke soared into the night's air with a sizzling noise. The demon grunted and shook terribly. When he calmed down, he gave Dean the evil eye and wiped over Castiel's wet face, the smugness was erased out of the features he currently abused.
Dean was a nervous wreck. Castiel had gone into town to run some last errands, and Dean knew, once he returned to Bobby, it would be the last time he saw him – that Cas was about to go away on his trip within the next hour or so. Dean was all twitchy, walking up and down Bobby’s living room. At last, Bobby gave him an unnerved, long glare, which made Dean sigh and sit down at the kitchen table to fetch himself another cup of coffee.
“The kid’s great. I mean, he seems scarily composed in regards to what he has been through. Damn mature for his age… and I really liked talking to him. He’s so bright, you know? Straight-A student and all that.” He sighed, suddenly heavy-hearted.
„I can defend myself when push comes to shove, Dean. As I said, it’s really kind of you. But I don’t want to drag you even more into this. Aaron had always had feelings of jealousy. How do you think he will react when I show up with
Dean’s jaw dropped and he exclaimed an offended “Hey!” – but Castiel just grinned and pushed him towards the staircase so that Dean could go upstairs and take a shower.
He looked down at his lover in awe, and he watched him as he undid his jeans with rough, hectic movements; he saw, Dean's fingers where trembling with nervousness, and his head was tilted as he focused on his task. He let him pull down his jeans and boxershorts in one go, and he didn't even feel embarrassed or awkward, as he stood naked in front of his lover in his garage, while the fresh wind blew inside and stroked his frame and stimulated each fiber of his skin – Dean's scraping teeth were too distracting to worry about such trifles. A wicked tongue moved along his hipbones, there were gentle, yet brusque bites into the lean flesh of his abdomen, and Castiel's grip on Dean's shoulders tightened as his abs constricted with shocked lust – a hot wave of desire poured down on him, and his legs became wobbly, as Dean's hot, moist breath ghosted over his exposed erection.
Their eyes were glued to one another, speaking of so many things they already knew and had thought about. That this wasn’t a spontaneous decision, that it was a life-long responsibility, that it wasn’t going to be easy. They knew all that, didn’t even have to talk about it. Cas’ throat corded up with joy, so strong, it was close to pain. He felt hot tears welling up in his eyes, sucked in a shaky breath. With his free hand, he stroked through the short-cropped, dishwater blonde hair of his husband, right above his temple. Dean leaned into the gentle touch, hummed appreciatively and closed his eyes.
Deeply moved, Castiel sat up, took Dean’s hand into his. He sought for his eyes, firmly held his gaze, as he rubbed Dean’s knuckles with his thumb tenderly. Castiel’s other hand came up and framed his cheek, his face came closer. Dean froze with torrid pleasure, watched his lover mesmerized. Cas’ eyes were already closing, his and Dean’s lips merely a handbreadth apart. He spoke softly, his words breathed against Dean’s mouth like a wisp of wind.
Dean placed the book aside and lay down on the bed. He closed his eyes and listened to the compositions Castiel was working his way through, how they filled the house with sweet notes… Outside, it started raining, and the rain seemed to accompany Castiel’s music perfectly. A sensation of complete calm grew in Dean, he felt all at ease, while he cherished Castiel’s talent. He could have listened to him forever. After a few songs, Dean got curious, though, and he wanted to see what Castiel looked like when he played, whether his mien was as concentrated as Dean imagined. He longed to witness Castiel’s fingers flying over the ebony and white keys. He got up and left his room, descended the stairs quietly to the living room neighboring the kitchen. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw something was baking in the oven, looking a lot like a version of Shepherd’s pie. He tiptoed to the living room carefully, not wanting to disturb Castiel in his play. The man was sitting in front of the piano, his head a little bowed in concentration, his posture stiff and straight. His eyes quickly fled to Dean’s, acknowledging he was there with a brief nod, then he continued playing.
A few moments later, Dean had abducted them to a calmer section of their garden, so that they could have a moment to themselves. It seemed everyone wanted to congratulate them for a splendid evening and for the incredible amount of money they had collected – but Dean had realized that Castiel needed a break, and he himself also wouldn’t have minded a little breather. With cool beers, they now sat on some chairs at the other end of the garden, a few feet away from the bustling activity. Dean held Castiel’s hand loosely in his, sometimes kneaded his fingers playfully, absentmindedly. To feel the weight and warmth of his fingers in his was soothing to Dean, reassuring. A tentative smile graced Castiel’s mouth as their eyes met. Dean was ruminative, memories of the past springing to his mind suddenly.
“Keep going,” Dean insists, which isn’t an answer, but Castiel trusts him enough to be clear if he’s not enjoying himself.
then, one that he’s hardly gotten to touch in weeks. That gets him thinking less about made up scenarios and more about the ridiculous tempting
“Maybe,” Cas admits, moving fractionally closer, hands resting on the countertop on either side of Dean. “Maybe I do.” There’s a hint of something seductive there, so faint and fleeting that Dean thinks he might have imagined it.
Castiel pauses thoughtfully for a moment, not wanting to give away his suspicions too soon, giving Dean a chance to say more. “Did you find something?” he asks, when Dean offers no additional explanation.
“Not buying it,” Dean replies as he jots down their scores for this round – as if it even matters anymore.
. It’s all perfectly understandable and natural and nothing he shouldn’t be able to deal with like a grown-ass man. But despite all his completely reasonable logic, he still feels like a fucking idiot, sweaty and tongue-tied, silently ogling Cas like a hormonal teenager at every opportunity.
Dean licks his lips and nods. Castiel’s pleased but not surprised by his reaction, that eager look on his face when Castiel gives him
,” Castiel replies. “It’s like I said last night. I looked into local disappearances, everything that might be a red flag, and I didn’t come up with anything. I even widened my search to a 10-mile radius and still couldn’t piece anything together.”
, probably has been since Cas’s fist connected with Jones’ face, since Dean got an eyeful of Cas looking pissed off and
He stares at Cas’s name in his contacts, thumb hovering over [CALL], but he loses his nerve, opens up the messenger instead.
Dean’s cheeks burn and his stomach twists with nerves and arousal, but he looks in Cas’s eyes and does as he’s told. “I deserve a reward, sir,” he says, relieved that his voice comes out steady.
Dean didn’t need much more coaxing than that, kept his hands to himself, so to speak, though Castiel could tell that even the pressure of his clothes stretched taut where he was hard and aching was almost unbearable. Like he could tip over the edge from that alone, and maybe he
“Dean, please,” Castiel says, desperation leaking into his voice. The last thing he wanted was to upset Dean further. “Just let me—”
,” Dean repeats emphatically, breaking into another near-hysterical peal of laughter, shoulders shaking, cheeks still damp. “Uh,” he says when he finally calms himself down, “Wow.” He feels floaty, faintly delirious with relief and excitement. Thank god for happy accidents, because he wouldn’t have known how to ask for this and it’s so
He’s almost startled to see their waitress there, leaning in to top off their coffee. The words are innocuous enough, but the gleam in her eyes when she glances at Dean tells an entirely different story. Dean freezes at first, not expecting the compliment, but even after he recovers he’s earnestly clueless about how to respond, especially with Cas sitting right there. Before he can even attempt a reply, she’s called away by another customer, face falling when their interaction is cut short.
, use Dean’s body for his pleasure and spill inside him, mark him up in the dirtiest, most intimate way possible.
Even on that precarious precipice of orgasm he’s still polite enough to make sure, though he doesn’t
Cas isn’t buying it, Dean can see that from the way he narrows his eyes, from the imperious tilt of his head. “But you
“Been putting these off for a while,” Dean explains, as they settle onto the couch. “Used to watch these all the damn time when I was younger, till Sam started giving me shit about it,” he continues with a snort, leaning forward to open the laptop on the coffee table and pull up the videos. “Kept saying I had a ‘crush’ on Harrison Ford.”
“Amy Mulholland was very excited about her ‘promposal’ last month,” Castiel reports after a long stretch of silence, leaning on the table with his chin in one hand.
Cas flattens Dean to the window, breathing harshly against his neck. “Want to fuck you,” he groans, punctuates the thought with a sharp bite on Dean’s lower lip – and god, for all that Dean knows Cas
No thanks to Jones, Dean would bet. “Nice to know you’re lookin’ out for your citizens, Sheriff,” Dean fires back, scowling.
For all Dean’s faux grumpiness, he can’t entirely fight a pleased little grin, unable to hide that he’s flattered by Castiel’s appreciative gaze. Castiel’s gratified to see that, because he can’t imagine himself breaking that habit anytime soon.
, almost invite it, because that’s the whole point of this idiotic plan, to get the vampire’s attention and convince her to head out back for some ‘alone time,’ where Dean can dispose of her without causing a scene. Even if he doesn’t like the idea, Castiel can still appreciate the irony of using her own tactics against her.
“Can you, uh—” he says, not sure how to indicate that Cas should probably let him down from the countertop.
“Yeah,” Dean says with a dreamy sigh, immediately wrapping all four limbs around Castiel when he joins him on the bed. “He’s gonna totally rock my world, too.”
If he spends another hour lying in bed – trying to push obscene images from his mind, willing his body to behave itself so he can leave his room without scandalizing anyone, praying he doesn’t run into Cas – then, well. No one has to know.
Castiel was too, but he’s suddenly in less of a hurry. He offers nothing but an unapologetic shrug in reply, reveling in the laugh that earns him, the conspiratorial smirk.
to have them, too stupid with lust to take everything off properly, but the truth is that even during a hookup with a stranger it felt too exposed, too difficult to make the inevitable quick getaway. It’s almost enough to dredge up some self-consciousness, but the look in Cas’s eyes tells Dean that he’s got nothing to be embarrassed about. Dean’s mostly used to the way Cas looks at him – even in a romantic way, by now – but Cas turning that intense gaze on him when they’re both undressed is an entirely different story.
. And yeah, his mind is fixated on less wholesome activities at the moment but honestly he’s pining for Cas in his bed again in
Then he won’t feel right again until he Cas returns, even if Dean doesn’t actually see him. Lying in bed and hearing Cas enter his own room is enough. Just knowing that Cas has come home makes Dean sleep better, and he needs all the help with that that he can get, because the dreams haven’t slowed down at all.
“Of course I would,” Castiel replied with a tone of conviction that he hadn’t entirely intended, running on auto-pilot. “In fact, I am.”
“You’re tired,” Castiel points out, trying to mask his own disappointment that the evening has drawn to a close. “I’ll go.”
Dean’s stupidly relieved that she’s being so awesome about this. “Yeah,” he says with a faltering smile. “Cool.” He doesn’t really know where he wants to go from here, drinks from his mug and looks at Charlie expectantly.
Cas steps back to admire him again, fingers slipping up Dean’s sleeve and tracing the goosebumps that’ve broken out on his skin. Might have more to blame for those than the cold.
He gets a faint mumble in reply this time, Dean’s grip on his pillow tightening for just a second before slackening again. Emboldened, Castiel allows the barest movement of his hand, just a tiny stroke up and down, as much of a soothing and innocuous action as he can make it.
It’s so easy, then, to get swept up by a wave of anticipation, reassured by the knowledge that this is something they’ll likely do again. “Awesome,” Dean replies with an almost shy quirk of his lips.
Castiel hasn’t forgotten what a rare sight this is, Dean looking so peaceful and contemplative, gazing out over the lake. He must feel pressure to fill the empty spaces with chatter, sometimes, either for his own sake or for others. But maybe he’s started to realize that Castiel doesn’t need that from him, that just being here is enough.
He knows it’s different for Dean. Dean’s not confused by his desires, but for all his experience, his painstakingly crafted façade of coolness or brazen enthusiasm, he is sometimes ashamed of them. He understands that part of himself perfectly well, but it’s clear that, far too often, he wishes that he didn’t.
Castiel happily complies, sliding forward the slightest bit and then a little bit further, trying not to succumb to the overwhelming sensation of having Dean like this.
He holds another strawberry out for Dean, observing with interest his heavy breathing, half-lidded eyes. It’s fascinating and thrilling to know that this is enough to arouse him; that’s true for Castiel too, especially with Dean’s lips briefly wrapping around his fingers as he withdraws his hand.
“Don’t fall asleep on me,” Dean says, after a moment, nudging him. “We’re gonna go again,” he insists, “And I’m not gonna cry this time.”
Deans heart thuds through the silence that follows. “I have been avoiding you,” Cas eventually admits, “But it’s—” he seems to struggle with himself, exasperated and slightly confused, “Dean I… I
part that he and Cas discussed, that whole ‘best I’ve ever had’ spiel wasn’t just him stroking Cas’s ego – as much as he does like to do that. He’s got a decently lengthy list of wild flings that were kind of fucking mind-blowing at the time, and maybe still are, in retrospect, but no one’s ever left him with that utterly fulfilled, bone-deep satisfaction like Cas does.
“Oh yeah?” Dean smirks at him, a teasing spark in his eye. “How far did you think things were gonna go?”
Dean gets caught up in that intense gaze so damn easily. He’d give anything to know what Cas is thinking sometimes, and he’s becoming increasingly convinced that all he’d have to do is find the nerve to ask.
“I’ll let you know,” Dean promises. “Definitely not changing my mind right now, though,” he admits, surprisingly unabashed about his own eagerness.
He springs into action the instant she’s too close to Dean for his liking, grabbing her and wrenching her away. He has a stray thought that it shouldn’t have been quite so easy to sneak up on her with her heightened senses, which is clear evidence of the effect Dean has on her – a vampire in someone else’s thrall, for once – before rounding on her and driving his blade straight through her heart. He doesn’t actually need to use a weapon for this, but merely ending its life with a blast of his grace didn’t seem as appealing in the heat of the moment. And one strike is certainly enough, his aim is good, but he throws another in just to be safe, finding it viscerally satisfying in a way it usually isn’t when eradicating commonplace, lower monsters like this one.
And yeah, he doesn’t really want to spend a whole day of alone time with Cas doing chores and suffering through research. “I wanna lay around and watch TV,” he admits after a beat. “With you.” He slept like a rock but he still feels like he could use a nap, or at least an excuse to curl up with Cas for a while.
Dean was totally shaken by that dream. He’s been so caught up wondering how the hell he started dreaming about romance novels that he didn’t even realize he’s practically been living in one. And it’s about time he stopped ignoring the
It’s not the first time he’s thought about it. Normally, he’s hasty to bury that inclination before he can dwell on it, but right now, Dean lets himself get lost in the fantasy, dipping down to kiss Cas, whimpering into his mouth as the pleasure spikes just from the ideas circling his mind, coming sudden and
Dean gets the sense that Cas is leaving the ball in his court. Dean could follow his base lust right now, and he’s certain Cas would readily accompany him down that path, but he’s already made his decision. And if this shower is really not going to lead to anything other than showering, Dean figures he might as well do just that.
“You close?” Dean asks, and Cas hums an affirmative against his throat. “Me too.” Close is a generous way of describing the way he feels right now, teetering on the edge of climax and eager to go over it. But right now, he wants Cas to get there first. “C’mon, Cas, just… inside me, you can—” Dean breaks off on a choked moan. “I want it,
gone, has just disappeared without a word. He doesn’t even leave goddamn note, which is just discourteous, if you ask Dean. He should be used to Cas wandering off on him, but maybe in the back of his mind, Dean expected it to be different now that Cas has got a home base to return to, somewhere he’s supposed to be.
Castiel doesn’t quite crave food the way Dean does, but he’s greedy for the ritual of it, sitting with Dean eating breakfast and discussing their plans for the day, admiring Dean’s freckles when he sips his coffee, hoping that’s an opportune moment to do so without Dean calling attention to his staring.
close, just close enough for Dean to wish that it didn’t matter so much, that he could inch his way into Cas’s space, press his shoulder against Cas’s without being so uptight about it, feeling like people are watching with sharp eyes and judgmental attitudes.
Dean opens his eyes, seeks out Cas’s, and he feels the tension drain from him almost immediately. There’s still some doubt, some lingering shame, but it’s overpowered, as usual, by the reminder that
He hears Cas sigh and shift around, and suddenly he’s right up against Dean’s back, breath hot against Dean’s skin, arm wrapped around his middle.
“I don’t believe I did ask you,” Cas says, still appearing unfazed, but Dean knows him too well to buy it. Jones is getting under his skin. “I assure you, I have no interest in your opinion.”
He can be methodical beginning to end this time, string Dean along a bit because they both enjoy that. He can take the opportunity to go slow because that’s what he needs to do to get Dean ready, despite Dean’s insistence and his own waning patience.
He hovers in the doorway for a minute, watching quietly as Cas tends to his horse, so engrossed by the sight that he nearly jumps at the sudden sound of Cas’s voice.
Dean’s not sure, actually, but— “I did with Rhonda,” he admits on a breath. He’s mostly trying to be honest, but if it has the added effect of playing to Cas’s competitive streak, that wouldn’t be the worst thing.
Then the door clicks closed behind him, and he looks at Cas, faintly terrified, heart pounding. “Cas, I…”
Cas pulls him in with all four limbs, holds him close and readily opens his mouth, meets the slide of Dean’s tongue with the lazy curl of his own, presses their bodies flush with a sinuous roll of his hips. Dean rocks into it, has to pull his mouth away with a gasp, nearly delirious from the sensation of Cas’s insistent hardness against his own. They grind together with rapidly building urgency, hands wandering until they’re both worked up and restless, breaking the kiss and panting for breath.
and all, but I don’t think you have to work so hard to impress your boyfriend over there.” He scoffs. “I know what people like him are like. Got that
Still, Dean can’t fight how good it feels to see Cas when they do run into each other. His heart races when Cas smiles at him or is amused by one of his dumb jokes. When Cas brings Dean dessert from a diner he stopped at on his way back, or tells him about how he’d tracked down a werewolf pack and easily eliminated it, Dean has no control over the pleasure that starts in his stomach and spreads all the way to his toes. When Cas offers a casual, friendly touch, Dean can’t deny that that spark of lust is still there, on top of everything else, but it’s different now: still electric, but more dangerous.
in the same way. “It’s not the same for him. He doesn’t take it personally.” Cas isn’t afraid like Dean is. “You know how he is, no freakin’ shame about anything, and usually that’s a good thing, but—” He chokes out a laugh, swipes his hand over his face, finds his cheeks damp. “You shoulda seen him last night. Some drunk asshole was running his mouth about—” He shakes his head, not sure how to finish that thought, but he thinks Charlie gets the picture. “Wasn’t even cause of us, it was something on TV. I froze up, I just wanted to stay out of it, you know? Like he’d be able to
“They should be so lucky,” Cas says in a low rumble, sliding his fingers back into Dean’s mouth before he can respond. “It’s a privilege to see how gorgeous you are like this.”
, Dean can’t really say he didn’t expect Cas’s weird amount of professionalism about the whole thing.
looked at – if he didn’t already suspect he had a slight exhibitionist streak in him, he’s certainly confirming it now.
Castiel is so aware of what he’s being let in on, being invited into the sanctity of Dean’s room like this, so aware of Dean’s presence beside him in a close, private space.
Dean loves watching him in action, the way he stalks around the table to plan his shot, muscled shoulders flexing. It’s stifling in this place so Cas is stripped down to a t-shirt and hell, Dean’s sweating too, all that toned, tan flesh taunting Dean from afar, a flash of it when Cas leans over to sink a ball in the corner pocket, shirt riding up at the hip, thick biceps stretching the sleeves tight.
Castiel would tell Dean that he’s close, but he’s well aware that Dean already knows, doesn’t even want to be thrown off his rhythm long enough for Castiel to warn him,
Even though his own eyes slam shut in pleasure, Dean knows that Cas is watching him keenly, enraptured by the way Dean responds to his attentions. Cas retrieves the abandoned bottle from the mussed sheets and flips it open, takes Dean’s cock in hand, slicks him up with tight, leisurely strokes and Christ, Dean’s already so close to losing it. He bites his lip and tries to control himself, to keep from thrusting into Cas’s fist until he tips over the edge. Cas makes him crazy, spread out and unfairly gorgeous, his touch confident, knowing exactly how to make Dean feel good – Christ, maybe too good too soon.
, he thinks to himself over and over, at a loss for any other words, too raw and wrung out from overstimulation to talk about anything out loud either way. He’s only half-aware of Cas getting them cleaned up and coaxing Dean under the covers, melting further when Cas slips into bed behind him.
“No, uh—” Dean had begged off from that game after one go ‘round. The first time he and Cas both tried to slap the same pile of cards, Cas’s hand settling heavily over his own, he knew he had to switch to another game before he embarrassed himself. “I’ve gotta good feeling this time. Definitely gonna steal the win out from under you.”
Cas has always encouraged Dean for doing as he asks, but he’s never really phrased it that way, like he’s commending Dean for his performance, never sounded so
Talking it over, though. That was a mortifying conversation. Just bringing the subject up had been hard enough, but walking through the nitty-gritty details was a totally different story. But after he pushed past the initial embarrassment, it was honestly more of a turn on than anything else to listen to Cas describe
“Dude, how can you even tell?” Dean asks, incredulous. From where he’s standing, the moss is just a patch of fuzzy green in the damp soil, but Cas obviously sees things with a level of depth that Dean can’t really match. “You really know what
He’s so fucking glad he talked Cas out of that trench coat before they came out tonight. Then Cas had upped the ante, of course, by taking off the jacket too and rolling his shirtsleeves up, and there’s here’s still something so thrilling, so illicit about the sight of Cas’s bare forearms, the feel of skin and muscle beneath Dean’s greedy fingers, tie loosened from Dean tugging at it, reeling Cas in as if he’s the one in control here.
whines at the long line of his throat, the way he licks a few drops away and wipes his mouth with the back of his hand, staring Dean down the entire time. It might look creepy on someone else—hell, maybe it looks creepy on Cas too, but Dean’s too stupidly into him to find it anything other than a huge turn on.
, and so egregiously mishandled them. His inability to own up to his mistake makes the shame resurface, and that doesn’t make things any easier, doesn’t make him any more willing to face Dean.
Castiel leaves him be at first, suspecting he’ll eventually rouse again, especially when the abnormally loud opening sequence from the next episode starts. But even then, Dean remains undisturbed, leaning more heavily against Castiel, breath growing slower and deeper.
Dean turns back to Cas, fully prepared to dive right back in and spend the entire ride making out like over-eager teenagers. But as enticing as the prospect is, something makes him hesitate – some lingering, sensible part of his brain that hasn’t been overridden by lust and whiskey pipes up and suggests that maybe they should put this on pause. Because Dean’s easily worked up by Cas even when he’s stone cold sober, and his blood-alcohol level is not doing him any favors, if his display at the bar is any indication. He doesn’t exactly trust himself not to get carried away right now.
It reached down and grabbed them by the necks, the shadows spreading through their bodies as it had done once before. Struggling against it was pointless.
Cas was down to his neck, the shadows crawly up his face. He had closed his eyes, and briefly accepted his fate – until he felt a warm, familiar pair of hands grip him tight and raise him out of the darkness.
“Ehh. You say tomato, I say potato.” It shrugged. “At the end of the day – do you really want to stay awake, thinking about all the misery you caused, when you could just spare us both and take good, long, forever nap?”
“What about them?” Dean asked, towards the rest of the gang. They had stepped back, unsure whether or not they should revere the figure before them – or, in Ash (and Charlie)’s case, if they should hit on her.
“Y-Yes”, Jack said, hesitant. “The Shadow was looking for me. That’s why Cas made the deal in the first place.”
“Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, boy. You have to give me more than that. You’re gonna have to give me
Castiel picked him up, wrapped on the clothes of his former self, though he didn’t understand quite what had happened. “Why is he – why is he like this?”
“It looks like he was still writing”, Kevin said, snatching the last unfinished page from the typewriter. He scanned the paper, his face growing somber at each line. “Something about… clown vampires? Vampire mimes? This guy’s writing was really bad.”
“Alright, give me the scoop”, Dean said, the phone perched on his ear, while plucking the cushions out of the couch and sticking his hand between the crevices. “What’s going on over there?”
Above them, on the ceiling, there was a crack. A gateway. It was not golden like the others had been before; it was pitch black, and if they listened closely enough, they could hear the distance sound of humming coming through.
“I should warn you, though, a lot of things have changed since you… departed. For started, your mother is now the queen of Hell.”
“No, it’s not – never mind”, Dean sighed, turning to Charlie. He felt a nod growing on his throat. “Charlie. Hi. I’m –”
“W-O-W! Now that’s what I’m talking about!” The Shadow said, running its hands overs its head and down its neck. It had abandoned Cas’ likeness and taken Jack’s instead, though its eyes were apparently stuck on their golden form.
say she wanted to get to know me, and she already spent so long locked up, I didn’t think it was fair to do that to her again, so… I let her out”, he shrugged. “She’s… hard at work.”
“You know, I always figured you’d go for a redhead, but at least she is Irish”, she joked. “What else have you been using it for?”
Being reborn, however, meant having a body of their own – for many, it was a sudden, shocking experience of feeling their own flesh, of understanding the sensation of having fingers.
Bela took them to Rowena’s throne room – it wasn’t like she could say no to the Almighty, anyway – and while the Queen of Hell was more than eager to help them out, there was also very little that she could
“Are you two John’s boys? Look at you! His spitting image!” Bill said, laying a heavy hand on Sam’s shoulder.
Bobby and Rufus were locked in a game of pool, while Ellen and another man – a gruff-looking fella, salt-and-pepper hair, that could look like he had just quit being sheriff in
“So... what now?” Sam asked, putting his beer down. “No Chuck. No grand destiny. No strings. What are we supposed to do?”
Michael held back. He had been the last to arrive at the Empty, and for him the situation was a little more complex. “Is Adam alive?” he asked Sam.
“Ugh, fine, fine”, she gave in, pressing her thumbs against her temples. “But I swear to… me, I guess, if I see any of you here in the next thirty years, I
“His idea or Jody’s?” Dean asked, while crouching between the coffee table and the armchair, his knees complaining all the way down.
, I would love to come by after work, but I warn you, it will be late, probably around one or two in the morning, mind you."
“Here you go kiddo.” Looking up Dean smiled wide when he saw Gabriel walk up to them with a big ice cream sunday, just like the one the couple had.
Castiel watched Dean for a moment to see if he was going to react to what he said, but it seemed his boy didn’t want to answer.
“Are you positive?” Bring his face closer, Sam gave a small nod, looking nervous. Burying his face into Sam neck, Gabriel blew a loud raspberry in to the boy’s skin. Squealing, Sam wiggled trying to get away, but Gabriel held him in place continuing to tickle him as he blew into his neck.
It felt strange think of Castiel that way. It was strange but it felt good. Pouting, he looked up to his Daddy with puppy eyes.
Dean did try to ignore Gabriel talking about him. He couldn’t believe what was happening to him. He had no way of escaping by the sound of what he’s hearing. He didn’t want this but it seemed that he had no choice. Feeling anger build inside Dean could feel hot tears start to form. Screaming loudly, Dean pushed the pacifier out with his tongue. He felt it fall out down to the side of his face. If they wanted a baby they were going to get one, he thought as he screamed louder.
Sucking for a while Dean started to find he actual liked the bottle, he found it soothing. As he finished Dean pushed the nipple out with his tongue. Feeling Castiel sit him up, the blue eyed man started to rub his back, making him burp a few times.
“Let’s just head home.” Picking up some of the bags, Castiel glanced to his brother before making his way out of the mall.
Humming, Dean held out his hand towards Michael. Seeing the man properly, it still made him slightly uncomfortable at how much Michael looked like his Daddy. Apart from the eyes, frown and longer legs he would have thought he was Daddy’s twin. But thankfully to Dean, Michael’s face wasn’t as soft and loving as Castiel’s. Lest that was something that was just all his Daddy’s.
“No Michael,” Castiel interrupted giving his brothers hand a squeeze, “Gabriel explained everything and once I calmed I realised it wasn’t your fault. I’m sorry for how I reacted.”
“Deany, it’s time for your nap baby,” Castiel said, walking into the living-room with a bottle in his hand.
Looking round Sam noticed a pink body suit with a Dalmatian stitched on the front. Taking a step towards it Sam stopped himself, it was over in the girly cloths. He couldn’t have it even though he really liked it, he was a boy and boys don’t wear pink, at least that was what John had always told him. Letting out a small sigh Sam looked over, upset he couldn’t have it.
“I think that’s a great idea, but first I think we should say thank you to Crowley. Can you say thank you baby?”
“Yes little one. I wound never lie to you.” Hearing Sam sigh happily, Michael glanced to his brother to see him smiling towards him with such trusting eyes.
Following Deans hand, Castiel picked up the toy and handed it to his boy. “There you go baby, did you want to play with the puppy?”
Dean just lay there as Castiel pulled the overalls up his legs. He was happy Castiel didn’t want to make him into a baby girl, he would have preferred that he wasn’t been made into a baby at all but he was happy Castiel wanted him as he was if he really thought about it. Castiel had said he wanted him. No one had ever wanted him but this man did. Why would he? Dean wasn’t anything special. Feeling his stomach flip, Dean frowned. He felt very confused.
Dean eyes widened when he saw his Daddy holding up a fluffy stuffed bumblebee. Dean had never seen anything so soft in his life. Holding his hands up, Dean hummed when Castiel lowered it so he could hold it. Feeling its furry body Dean smiled up at his Daddy. He had got this specially from him. Feeling his heart warm Dean pulled his bee in close, rubbing its fur along his cheek. “...anks...ow”
“Here baby, eat up,” Castiel held up a spoon-full to Dean. Dean turned his head away before it got to close. “Come on Dean, don’t you want to try it?”
Thinking about his dad, Dean cried a bit harder. Why did this man pick him? Dean had heard about other homeless dispersing and never coming back but he never thought it would happen to him.
Pulling up onto Castiel’s drive, Sam waited quietly for his Daddy to come around the car to open the door.
Castiel could feel his eyes tear up at the sight of his baby. Dean’s whole body was shaking in his arms, his baby was having a terrible panic attack.
Going down the aisles Gabriel let Sam pick most of the clothes he liked. So far he had picked three body suits, two t-shirts and a pair of blue overalls, all with puppy designs over them. Seeing a pattern in what Sam was choosing he figured his baby must really like dogs. Letting Sam pick another t-shirt with a puppy on it, Gabriel started to grab though non-puppy clothes that he thought would be good.
“I don’t always depend on you. I told you I’m happy walking or even taking a bus,” Dean crinkles his nose at hearing his Daddy. He hoped his Daddy wasn’t changing his mind. Dean didn’t like the idea of being on a crowded bus full of people staring at him. Shaking at the thought Dean pulled on Castiel’s shirt. “..no..Dada..no”
“I think Uncle Gabriel should make my baby pancakes know after being such a jerk, what do you think Deany?” Castiel said glaring at his brother. Dean smirked to himself before nodding his head.
Unknown to the brothers as they walked down the street a black business car passed them, with someone who had spotted them.
Michael sighed looking up from his computer. “I wanted to surprise you, so I ordered the best toddler set that we make and Samuel has been my little helper and picked out what he wanted.”
Hearing Gabriel, Dean tried to relax, knowing he would be back with his Daddy soon. But he couldn’t stop a question going around and around in his mind. Why was he taken away from his Daddy? He knew now that it hadn’t anything to do with Castiel. His Daddy would have stopped the men if they hadn’t hurt him and held him down. If his daddy could have stopped them then Dean wouldn’t have been taken to that hell.
Grinning, Gabriel shook his head, “Afraid not big bro, anyway you’re always in suits. Today we are going to be comfortable,” he said, handing Michael the clothes.
Dean felt surprising warm. He normally wasn’t when he woke. Feeling something pulling at him he stretched out. It must be PC Bill trying to move him again, he thought. “I’m up Bill, I’ll start moving in a bit,” Dean groaned, starting to wake up. Hearing mumbling, Dean opened his eyes, expecting to see a stone wall. Instead he saw a pair of black shoes near to his head. Looking up, he saw Gabriel sitting in a chair, staring down at him. Suddenly he remembered he wasn’t at the church. He had been kidnapped.
Thank you everyone for the comments and kudos, you are all amazing and a big help. please let me know what you think xxxx
“Gabe, can you hold Dean and start feeding him while I make him a bottle please.” Without giving ether of the boys a choice Castiel placed Dean into Gabriel’s arms.
“Alright Deano you’re coming with me. We’re doing to go look at the cooler toys while Daddy looks around at the boring stuff,” Gabriel said, winking to his brother.
Gabriel had to bite his lip to stop himself from smiling, he knew he would just piss off the pouting boy even more if Dean saw him laughing. “Aww, what’s up kiddo? Are you not happy to see your favourite Uncle?”
Chuckling, Michael left his coffee. Moving closer to the boy he noticed him flinch when he went to pick him up.
“Yeah Unc Cas,” Sam smiled, making grabby hands for his brother. He would happily cuddle with his brother.
“When did he decide this?It’s not like Castiel to not notify me first,” Michael said, not looking very pleased.
“Shh baby Daddy’s here...Daddy’s here.” Hosting his boy out of his brother’s arms, Castiel held Dean close, rocking gently. Looking from his brother to the women Castiel frowned. He could only guess what was going on,but he really didn’t care; the only thing he cared about was Dean. His poor little boy looked so distressed. His eyes were red and puffy from crying so much.
Smiling, Gabriel could tell Sam was nervous. His baby had been silent since he woke from his nap. When Castiel called saying it was okay to come over, he was so happy. He was fearful that Castiel would say no, he didn’t know what he would have done with a very upset little boy.
“Right, all done. Now I’m going to take you to the waiting ward, it will only be for a few hours till they are ready to finish the botched up job of the treatments you have had. It’s clear to me that whoever did it wasn’t professional. They didn’t even give you the new mind treatment. But don’t you worry once you’ve been through it, you won’t remember the ordeal you’ve been through and will be a happy baby for some lovely couple.”
Castiel chuckled. He surprised Dean when he pressed a soft kiss on his cheek. Pleased, Dean hummed, leaned into the lingering caress. A hot shiver ran down his spine when Cas touched his face and directed him into a deep, slow kiss. Butterflies were tingling in his stomach, he blushed somewhat. Cas let go of him and looked at him, gave him an amused smile. His hand was still holding Dean’s cheek, his forefinger gently stroked along his slight stubble.
“Must be nice to feel that way,” Dean muttered, his voice husky with emotion – and now, he wasn’t envious of Castiel anymore, he was truly glad for him that Castiel had found a way out of his own misery. Castiel regarded him pensively, a cryptic smile on his mouth. He looked down at their intertwined hands and Dean thought he detected a faint blush spreading on Castiel’s cheeks.
"Thanks, Gabe, that's a good idea...", he said and retrieved his cell phone, starting to type a text-message. He stopped when he heard Gabe's unnerved groan and when he looked up he saw he was actually rolling his eyes at him. He didn't know what he had done to upset Gabriel, however his partner pointed at his phone incredulously to make himself clear.
After two hours, the course was coming to an end. All attendees were a little sweaty by now, but the exhausted smiles and grins on their faces were nothing but joyful. Gabriel received a long round of applause and bowed down to the group. Then some of the group stayed for drinks at the bar, while others took their leave and got their coats from the wardrobe. Castiel said he wanted to leave as well because the day had been very long for him and he was getting tired. Dean didn’t mind, thinking he could fall asleep pretty soon, too. When they turned around to go, he caught Gabriel’s eyes looking at them – and Gabriel winked at him knowingly, making Dean smirk to himself when they left the place.
am going to do”, Dean said. He reached for his shoulder, for the shadow of a touch that still lingered. “I’m going to bring Cas back.”
“We’re not giving up”, Dean said, determined. “We’re already here. Even if we have to knock on every door…”
“Ours”, Dean corrected, wrapping an arm around Cas’ shoulder. He didn’t understand what was going on – he didn’t have the faintest clue of what could possibly be going on between these three – but at least that much he knew.
“Oh, honey, we’re well past that”, at her side, Billie laughed. “See, Castiel? This is what happens when you mess with the natural order of things.”
Thankfully, Jack stepped in. “I can get us there”, he said, snatching them away with a snap of his fingers.
“He left it before, he can do it again. If not, we – Jack can do it. If Chuck could bring Lucifer back, Jack can –”
He stepped back, throwing her one last look before she returned to her throne. Queen of Hell… that was something he’d never get used to.
“He’s not dead, he’s just powerless”, Jack clarified. “I’m technically him, now, actually. It’s really is a long story.”
“This place is a mess and half”, Dean said, the moment his eyes adjusted to the brightness of the new corridor.
“I don’t know, but I’ll try”, Jack said. He pressed his fingers over the handprint, clearing his mind – through all the voices, all the prayers, all the beings he felt connected to, he reached out to one in particular. “Castiel”, he called out, to the vastness of the universe. “Castiel”, he called again, past the stars, the planets, into the void and beyond. “Father.”
“Just the two of them is enough”, he said. He rubbed the palms of his hands against his pants, following Anael down the corridor.
“I can see shame no longer cloaks your heart, Dean Winchester. Good. Unfortunately… there are billions of heavens to look through, and we don’t have the manpower to look through all of them. Especially if we don’t know what we’re looking for. I certainly can’t help you – I have to create more angels, keep the lights on here, keep the personal heavens from deteriorating more than they already…”
Cas crawled away, towards the closest body. He recognized him – Gabriel. Though he had died in a different universe, he still landed there anyway. Were all angels, all demons, across all universes bound to that place? How many different versions of him were there?
“But it’s different”, Jack intervened. “Chuck’s knowledge… it’s like a library. I have all the books in here, but I haven’t read all of them yet. It will take time.”
“Not really, I don’t think so”, the boy scratched his chin. “And the reapers can’t let them stick around anymore, either. That’s the new order of business. It’s not good for anyone, right?”
“I don’t know. Probably in a dungeon somewhere with that sleazy old man – what’s his name? Ketch, I guess.”
“What was I, born yesterday? Be reasonable, Castiel.” It kicked him away, stretching its legs. “Even I can admit when I was wrong. You
They hesitated – Eileen in particular – but Sam gave them the go-ahead. He was not one to trust Hell, but after everything, he trusted Rowena.
Teleporting always made the stomach hurt, and the location they were heading into didn’t bring out good memories for either Dean, Sam
“It doesn’t matter”, he said, turning back to the Shadow. “You have to let us out now. If one angel awake was bad, imagine a legion of them. We’re never going to give you peace.”
“Yes, yes, you have a lot of questions, and we will soon have time to answer them all. For now, why don’t you follow Naomi – she’s gonna put you all up to date on all that is, all that was, and all that it will be.”
Castiel swallowed hard. It wasn’t. It couldn’t be. Not again. Not again. Please. Please. Not again. “It’s okay”, he said, wiping the tear from Jack’s cheek. “It’s okay.”
“Can you take us to her?” Jack asked. He had mostly been observing the place – he had never been to hell before. It was not like he imagined. He figured there would’ve been a lot of more…extra-dimensional torture aspects, instead of some old caves.
is happening?” he insisted. Flashes of things moved behind the tracks. Gigantic things. Things beyond even his comprehension.
Sam hanged up first, while Dean held back for a moment, staring out of the window of the bedroom and into the beach just outside his door. Cas was outside, sitting on the sand, his purple linen shirt with the sleeves rolled up and a straw hat barely hanging on his head as he tried to build a castle with Jackie.
“It’s an empty heaven”, Ash said, making a beeline to the pool table. He reached underneath it and pressed a button; the surface flipped, revealing a rudimentary map – mostly made out of toy soldiers, scraps and markers. Like some kid’s attempt at a D&D battle map. “Which, it should go without saying, should
adverbs”, Charlie laughed, scavenging through the books on the shelves. “And killing women. His sex scenes were not that good, either.”
“Without the angels, the place isn’t as strong as it used to be”, Mary explained. “The walls… they were thinning out. Your friend there, Ash, he started going through heavens, pulling people along. He found Ellen and Jo and Bill, and they found Bobby, and he found Rufus and me, and I found Charlie and Kevin… Mostly by accident. I thought they were the other ones. From the other universe.”
“Aw, that’s romantic”, the Shadow interrupted, rising from the ground. It had, once again, tried to take on Cas’ form, to unfortunate results. “Told you he was gonna come for you! And now that he cleared the doorway to the other side, I can pass through and eat my way through the buffet. And I’m starting with you two lovebirds.”
He could still remember, clear as day. Sam’s incredibly long speech, which had only made him cry three times. Dean suggesting that his last drink be shared with Claire, as her first one, which she laughed incredibly uncomfortably. Karaoke was nice; seeing Crowley and Hannah wrestling for the improvised bouquet… not so much.
“And? Not all of them by choice. Not all of them willingly. Can you not think of any monsters you’ve encountered that needed help, rather than someone playing judge, jury and executioner? Someone who had a bad encounter, someone you and your brother or any other hunter couldn’t save in time?”
The new chapter of their lives was just starting out, and now they were the ones who’d get to write it… together.
The jacket was being kept on his bottom drawer, folded carefully, exactly as it had been since he’d last worn it. The stench of death was still impregnated into the fabric, and as he ran his fingers over the dried blood texture, it was like being there again.
. God, you’re always in such a hurry, aren’t you?!” she hassled, getting up from her seat. “Now, I heard through the grapevine that a while back, the Empty invaded Heaven, isn’t that right, lad?”
A funny thing happened when a legion of angels, including three archangels, stepped through a passage into Heaven.
“It’s okay, father”, the boy said, taking Cas’ hands on his own. The tears were swelling on his eyes. “Tell me that it’s okay.”
He hovered his hand over the mass of pins, closing his eyes for a second. The energy – he could feel it, like a faint memory he couldn’t quite fully visualize. But he knew where it was. He knew how to get there.
“We’re gonna need a little more to go than just that. What else are we supposed to be looking for?” Bobby asked.
“It’s… it’s not going well. Bobby’s bunking with Rufus – they drop by every other day. The Harvelles are reopening the Roadhouse. Ellen promised she’s gonna include some non-alcoholic options, if you ever want to drop by.”
“I’m still not sure if this isn’t some kind of Djinn illusion”, Rufus complained. “The Torah doesn’t say anything about heaven, and why would my heaven have Bobby Singer on it?”
“Yes. Maybe you don’t have to kill all of them, all the time”, she rolled eyes. “I’ve only been queen for a short time, but I’ve seen a lot of tormented souls here, Sam, even before they came to Hell. Can you imagine what is like for those in a place like Purgatory?”
Mary rushed over, wrapping her arms around her kids; “it’s good to see you boys again”, she whispered, kissing them both on the cheek. Bobby followed close by, minus the kissing.
“So? Hunter. College boy. Psych. Special Child. Boyking. Vessel. Men of Letters. Witch. Straight. Gay. Bi. Man. Woman. Those are all just
“So much faith”, he laughed, throwing aside a chewed rattle. “How about the others? How’s everyone else doing?”
It was like a shockwave, spreading out across the far corners of the celestial plane; a guff of hope that reenergized all those it came in contact with. The lights turned back on, and the walls rebuilt themselves. The place was, once again, whole.
That left the handful of reapers awakened by Castiel, led by Tessa and Billie. The two had crossover back into the land of the living – dead but also not, thus prime candidates for the role of Death after the demise of the last one; though which one of them had stepped first was unclear, as both donned a version of the Ring on their finger.
“I’ve been trying to contact him for a while now, but with no results”, Jack explained. “And for some reason, I can’t – I can’t open a door to the Empty.”
“They’ll go back to their own heavens, for the time being, while we do some reforms around. With more angels, things will be easier. I already have some plans – Uncle Crowley used to watch this show with me, about these four people torturing each other in some sort of hell, and I think he was looking for inspiration, but I didn’t get around to finishing it, but then, last year, with Chuck gone, actually sat down and –”
“What exactly are we supposed to be looking for here?” Rufus asked, pushing a couple of books off the shelf. “There’s no doors here.”
“Can we focus on the task at hand, please, instead of talking about all the women who died after sleeping with Sam?” Dean begged, rubbing his eyes.
“We don’t actually…have any clues”, Sam stammered. “Maybe it’s like a negative zone? Or… or it has a bad energy or something?”
Dean reached out around his neck, feeling the weeding present he’d gotten. Sure they had the rings, but the vial hanging at the end of the silver chain, containing Cas’ grace… that meant much more to him. With the angels back, his powers had gone back to normal, but still, he’d chosen to become human – for Dean, with Dean, in sickness and health; in life and death and beyond.
“Great. So we have to find a hidden door in Heaven. That’s fantastic”, Dean groaned, massaging his forehead. “Let’s get going, then.”
“No! Jack, don’t!” Cas forced himself up, putting his body between the boy and the Shadow. “You can’t do this.”
“He’s a little boy, isn’t he?” the Shadow asked, mouth twitched in a grimace. “Without his archangel powers to age him up, without the need of a grace to keep him alive – he’s just a little boy. Yours, by the looks of it.”
“Oh, not you again”, said a familiar voice – his own voice, but slightly to the left. “Did we not have a deal? Weren’t you supposed to be asleep?”
On the other end of the line, Sam chuckled. “Nothing, really. Everything’s been pretty calm, all things considered.”
Sam sighed. He knew the question was coming. “It’s actually going great. We’ve been helping a lot of people.”
“I’ve tried”, they heard someone say behind them. There was no ruffling of feather anymore – but Jack was standing there nonetheless, in his white jacket, with a smile on his face, his hand raised. “Hello.”
“Not enough juice. Hell, I can’t even keep one measly little angel asleep, much less fix this up. And why should I care, really?” it shrugged. “I was the only thing keeping those things out there from coming to this side and eating you people up for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but you have no respect! You think you can stroll in and out, disrespect my sleep, whenever you want! I just wanted to sleep, Castiel! Why couldn’t you just.
“Hello, Uncle Crowley. Good to see you back at the land of the living”, Amara said, before they could make their exit, stage left.
books!” Charlie squealed. “You guys should really read them, you were all there! You should especially read The Man Who Would Be King. It’s told through Cas’ point of view. It’s
“You know this isn’t a vacation spot, right?” asked a demon, stepping out of the shadows of a corner. “You can’t keep waltzing in and out of here whenever you’re in the mood.”
“You can only get out of here if they open a rift, and they won’t. You were right. They won’t come for me, they –”
At the other side of the door, the heaven waiting for them was exactly as chaotic as they’d expect from someone like Ash – but also way more populated.
“Of course! St. Paddy’s bash. Should we wear only green? I can grow out a beard and go dressed as a leprechaun.”
“Because you are the most powerful witch in the world, Rowena, if someone can do it, it’s you”, Sam pleaded.
“Exactly. Now, if I remember correctly, the Empty exists outside of reality. It can’t just come into this plane unprompted.”
!” the Shadow spat out, clapping its hands. “You came here, and you blew all over me – and not even in the fun way! And you made this place loud and unbearable! I can hear them – the Other Ones – they are coming, and they are coming fast! But I’m going to eat you up, and I’m going to stop all of this, and then I’m going back to sleep again.”
“Well, yeah, me and Aunt Amara are trying, but there’s a lot of things we need to work on”, Jack explained.
“So there are no more ghosts downstairs?” Sam frowned. “No more vengeful spirits? Unfinished business – nothing?”
“You mean Castiel”, Naomi interrupted, almost spitefully. “If he is in the Empty, that means he is dead.”
of him?” it laughed. “He was building his little castles in the sandbox, sure, but there’s a whole other playground out there, buddy boy, and you don’t want that shit to cross over here. This isn’t just breaking the fourth wall; it’s taking a hammer and tearing down the whole damn studio.”
“Only died because of your brother’s bad writing”, he filled in, quickly. “Don’t you think they deserve a second chance, now, without the burden of Chuck’s decisions controlling them? Don’t you think
When the light dissipated and the humming sound ceased, angels and humans (and the occasional reaper and demon, lest we forget) found the environment had changed – the cracks had healed, yes, but the darkness of the Empty had dissipated along with it, and it was now a white-hot room, no longer pulling them down. The angels and demons and reapers still asleep had disappeared.
He shot Dean a disgusted look. “God had a personal heaven? You think that’s where he had been hiding all this time?”
She led them along the way through the many corridors of letter ‘A’s, down to the ‘As’, and then ‘Ash’s, until they landed on an unexpected hallway. “His name is Ash…ley Simpson?” Sam squinted.
“The Queen of Hades it is, then. Come on, Persephone, lead the way”, he said, gesturing to Sam, whose ears perked up.
It took a moment for Sam and Dean to process who they were seeing, and even longer to fully register it. “
“I can handle it, I just need a little more focus”, she said, closing her eyes. Maybe all that yoga had actually served for something, after all.
“You know, you could just go back to sleep”, the Shadow said, fiddling with its nails. It had conjured a chair for itself, using Cas as a footrest. “You don’t need to see what happens next.”
“Huh? What? No, I didn’t do it!” Ash shouted, jumping on his feet. He squinted at the newcomers with mild surprise. “Oh, it’s you guys. Did you die again?”
“That one is pretty inevitable. In fact, if you decide to be petulant and stay awake, I’ll make it worse for you. When they open that rift – and they will open it, sooner or later – I’ll gobble up their universe, brick by boring brick, until the last star dies out, and when it does, I’ll spit you out, so you have to spend the rest of eternity alone. Do you really want that to be your end?”
It was the Roadhouse again, as it had been the last time, and Ash was there again, passed out on a couch, but it was not a memory; there were other people, people who he’d definitely never met before while alive.
Not that there was much of it. The lights on Heaven kept flickering, giving a glimpse on the deteriorating walls of the celestial office building. There was broken furniture everywhere – well, not so much broken as much as it was coming undone, unraveling at the seams, like everything else.
“The ones he created, yes, but do you really think he was the only one? Don’t you think there was something
“Oh, here it is”, he pulled the pillows up. He used to hide guns and knives under there, and now he was finding tiny plastic pink beach rakes. The kid wanted what the kid wanted. “I gotta go, man. Same time next week?”
“Could I have a moment with Samuel before you head off into the next part of your quest?” Rowena requested. “Alone?”
books, lined up row after row, with some editions scattered over the carpet. At the corner of the room, there was a desk, with an old-timey typewriter, a half-written page still stuck to it.
“It doesn’t matter if I approve or not, Sam”, Dean interrupted. While ravaging through the drawers in the nightstand, he found several familial trinkets – a postcard from Adam and Michael, who’d taken a sabbatical from Heaven and left with his former vessel to explore the world, both so that they could get to know it better and to adjust to his new age they had been brought back into (Adam complained a lot about people thinking they were twins; Michael had gone into perhaps too vivid details all the places he’d been inside Adam now that he didn’t need to
“It’s a place where angels go when they die”, Kevin said, with a swing of his beer. He had made no mention of leaving his stool. “It was in one of the tablets.”
The dumbstruck countenance he received for saying this would have made Dean laugh at any other occasion. Now it unsettled him, and he wasn't sure it was exactly what Castiel wanted as well. Castiel blinked a few times, standing idly there and seeming nothing but petrified. It wasn't the reaction Dean had hoped for, but then again, he hadn't had any idea how he had wanted Castiel to react in the first place. Since Dean was a man who faced his fears and who didn't get easily discouraged, he decided to allure Castiel – he'd be damned if he couldn't seduce him, at least a tiny bit until he found his tongue again.
Castiel's arms around his neck stiffened, his fingers got lost in Dean's short hair and he tugged lightly at the strands. Dean allowed him to tilt his head and their kisses deepened, became more frantic, heated. When they let go, Dean's head was swimming, his knees felt like jelly. Castiel's knowing look and his hesitant smile created a fond feeling in Dean's chest. He leaned in once more to claim those lips again, then they let go of one another and walked inside, closing the door behind them. Dean frowned at himself when the feeling of familiarity ran through his being like a soothing caress, as he followed Castiel into the kitchen. He had only been here twice, but it already felt homely to him. From the living room instrumental guitar music came, resounding within the whole flat, yet not in an annoying volume. It sounded Spanish or Mexican, Dean wasn't sure, though he thought it sounded rather bewitching and exotic. He couldn't stop looking at Castiel's occupied body when the man bent slightly down and got two bottles of beer out of the fridge, one of his feet tapping with the rhythm of the playing song. His therapist turned a little around to Dean and raised his brows, asking him "Do you want one?" and of course Dean nodded – beer had been his substitute for coffee, water and other soft drinks for quite some time now, though he could go without it if necessary. Castiel beamed at him and opened the bottles, a calm, however silently happy gleam within his eyes.
Gabriel became aware of the change in Dean’s features and turned around, detected Castiel approaching. Castiel only had eyes for Dean. It seemed his equilibrium returned to him, now that he could contemplate the man he loved. Before, he had felt like helplessly floating in space, confused and disoriented. All his uncertainties, all his qualms, were laid to rest once he saw the heat in Dean’s green eyes.
When Dean drove to the police station, he scanned the sky above him in all directions, up until the horizon. It was hard to imagine that a tornado warning had been issued for today – there were some dark rain clouds in the sky, sure, but there were also vast stretches of azure blue, the sun struggled through in between clouds. However, the wind was blowing fiercely, pushed the clouds swiftly along. Thoughtfully, Dean envisioned their house and the precautions they had taken, hoping it would suffice and keep their home intact. Maybe they would be lucky. Maybe the tornado wouldn’t even hit them or touch ground.
Castiel scoffed and shook his head, an amused smile tugging at his mouth. He lay down on his back and placed his legs on Dean's lap nonchalantly.
"Yeah, alright. You better make sure I won't die, though," he joked. He recognized the cheerful expression in Castiel's light blue irises, and now he was certain his eyes were
in all this time? Dean, it’s been nearly two months”, Cas said. Dean smiled wistfully and regarded Cas, feeling something tug at his heart. How could he explain all of this chaos inside of his head to Cas? That he didn’t want anyone else, that it felt strange to touch himself, because all he could ever think about was Cas, and that Cas wasn’t there? He smacked his lips, pressed his tongue against one molar as he contemplated Cas for a second.
Author's note – thanks for your interest so far! I'm happy about all the alert messages I received…! Jfyi, I'm currently finishing chapter 10… feedback is as always appreciated.
Today, it was a rainy summer’s day. Even though it was only noon, dark clouds hung in the sky and made it seem as if evening was already approaching. It drizzled. Dean was at the western graveyard to pay a visit to his family’s graves. Castiel was at his side, and Dean found strength in his company. Hand in hand, they sauntered from one grave to the next, stopped in front of every Montague crypt. Dean contemplated the graves silently, remembering the deceased family members resting in them. And for the first time, there was no hate on his mind, no abstract plan for revenge on the Capulets, no pent-up anger. He was just sad and missed the people he had lost. Castiel rubbed his back soothingly, understanding Dean’s commotion. Dean tried to smile at his partner, but failed. He couldn’t hide from him how he was feeling, what was really going on inside of him. Castiel beckoned his head to the side, hinted at the latest grave. Dean took a deep breath, stepped in front of the grave – John’s. Countless flower wreaths covered it.
Looking up he could see his boy trying to break out of the bigger man’s hold with Gabriel right behind him screaming for the man to let him go. He didn’t know what happened but after seeing Dean’s scared little face, but he suddenly couldn’t hear anything. It was like someone had pushed the mute button in his mind, his baby’s face at that moment will forever be engraved into his heart. And the only thing he could think was that its was all his fault. “..D..Dean..”
As he walked up, he could hear Castiel laughing behind him. “Smug git,” he mumbled walking into the nursery.
Letting his boy calm down Castiel lifted Dean into his arms. He loved hearing his baby laugh, hearing his Dean so happy made his own heart swell with happiness.
“Hmm, na, I think Granddaddy suits you, doesn’t it Deanie, is Mickey your Granddaddy now.” smiled Castiel tickling at Dean’s belly making his baby giggle.
“I won’t do anything Casey. Dean should just be thankful I’m not his Daddy,” Gabriel frowned, looking down at a scared looking Dean.
“Good morning Samuel.” The man looked at him with his cold blue eyes and a small grin. “Did you sleep well?”
Castiel felt like Michael wasn’t the same person that he had grown up with, he use to really look up to his big brother. But now he just didn’t know how he felt about him anymore.
“What do you want baby, do you want Daddy to keep on humming?” Castiel asked. Shaking his head Dean tapped his Daddy’s lips again. “Oh, do you want Daddy to sing to you?”
Oh thank god, she thought. “Cas...Cas! Gabriel has Dean, he’s bring him home,” she said showing Castiel her phone.
Dean looked on from his high-chair. What has he done? He hurt Daddy! He was going to be in so much trouble. Dean jumped when he heard the front door slam open.
“Present. Can I have a present mama? it’s nearly my birthday.” Charlie grinned, holding her arms out to be picked up.
“Of course it’s okay baby. Dean is going to love it, not because its cars but because his cute little brother got it for him.”
Getting up, Castiel walked into the kitchen, finding the red car on top of a few files on the table. Picking up everything he came back, handing Gabriel the toy. Sitting back on the sofa Castiel opened the file with Dean’s name on it. Flicking through Castiel was shocked at how little info there was on his baby.
“Yeap, I just need to stop at the drugstore, then we’ll head back to yours,” Gabriel said, holding the door open for his little brother as he pushed the stroller out.
Dean opened his eyes to see what was going on, he had never seen people act the way this family did. Seeing everyone acting so happy and loving, it did make him wonder why his real family wasn’t the same. He had only a hand full of happy memories, all involving his mom before she died, everything after was just...well, he didn’t really like to think about it.
“Just delivering a nursery that was ordered,” the man said, walking away into the room across from his.
Waiting an hour, Castiel spots Dean limping past the car to the church. The boy didn’t look so great. Even in the dark, Castiel could see his boy was paler then normal. “That’s him Gabriel.” he said.
Frowning into Sam’s soft hair Gabriel lightly bounced his boy around the room, “Aww Buddy, I was only gone a minute. Shh its okay, Daddy wasn’t leaving you.”
“We’re not spanking my baby Gabriel. It was an accident. It was my own fault for not watching where I was going,” Castiel said as Gabriel wiped the blood off his arm.
Giggling looking from Michael to his Daddy, Dean shook his head, it was funny hearing Michael telling his Daddy off.
Hey everyone, sorry its been so long since I last posted, but here's my latest chapter, hope you all like it, and thank you for the kudos and comments you're all awesome :-) xx
Both brothers waited a while for Dean to fall asleep. Getting out of the driver’s side Gabriel headed up the church. Castiel climbed into the back seat ready nervously watching out for other people.
“Sam.” Glaring back Sam saw his Daddy giving him a warning look, but he didn’t care, he wanted to play with Dean. Daddy was just being mean. Sticking his tongue out he turned away smiling at Dean, ignoring Gabriel. “We play De,” he said pulling at the tape on the box.
Gabriel grinned before drinking his coffee again. He was glad his brother was happy. Putting the cup back down he feels something nudging him in the knee, looking down he saw a small sock covered foot poking him. Turning his gaze up he saw Dean’s green eyes looking at him from behind a stuffed bumblebee covering his face. “What’s up kiddo?” He asked, smiling at how cute the boy looked.
“Dean also needs his boosters, so can you make him as comfortable while I get them?” Dr Bailey said, standing to go to her cabinet.
Sighing, Castiel held the bottle to his baby’s lips. He wasn’t mad at Michael, not anymore, he just really didn’t know what to say to his big brother to make it alright.
“Boring. Michael has me going through the names of the new candidates he has come by, he’s been driving me mad Cassie,” Gabriel groaned.
Looking back into his room Dean noticed a blue puppy stuffy sitting on a shelf. “Dada?” he asked, making grabby hand towards the toy.
Feeling tears in his eyes Dean held up his hand, touching the top of Sam’s head, Dean combed his fingers through Sam’s soft brown hair. “Sammy...orry..”
“Slow down Dean, you’ll get a stomach ache if you drink too fast,” Castiel said, pulling the bottle back.
Gabriel smirked to himself, he was so glad his nephew’s pout didn’t work on him. “We can play more after your nap buddy.”
Gabriel knew he needed to look after his family right now, but he had something important of his own to sort out.
He should talk to his older brother, but he didn’t know what to say. He felt he had over reacted towards him yesterday. He knew now it wasn’t Michael’s fault for Dean being taken. But a part of him still didn’t feel like he could trust his big brother around his baby.
Dean hadn’t watched TV in, well, ever. His dad wouldn’t let him, even after school his dad always told him and his little brother Sam to go up to their rooms and not come out and bother him. He could remember one time he did try watching the tv once. Dean had snuck down while his dad was asleep, he must have been watching for about five minutes before his dad came thundering down the stairs. Feeling himself cringe Dean tried to not think about it, he just remembered why he never tried again after that.
Sitting in silence, Castiel cuddled his baby happily. His boy held on to his shirt tightly with his small hand. He could have stayed there holding his baby forever but he soon heard a knock on the door, taking him out of his trance.
