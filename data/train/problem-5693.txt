Peter nodded. He felt a huge burden being lifted from his shoulders. Even if the worst happened to his parents, he wouldn’t end up in foster care again, which Peter believed would be a death sentence for him at this point.
“What the hell, Wilson?” MJ yelled.
“Peter, have you ever wanted to fly in an Iron Man suit?” Tony questioned him with a mischievous grin.
Maria released Carol turned towards her daughter. “Yeah, it wasn’t exactly a surprise to me.”
“I’m sorry, kiddo. That’s just how people are. I wish we could help, but the only option at this point would be to switch schools,” Tony offered.
Peter waved goodbye the principal and felt his last silver of security slip away. He was terrified of what lied ahead of him today.
“He doesn’t want you here. Right, Peter?”
When Peter arrived at school, his loyal bodyguard was waiting for him by his locker.
He knew he'd be asked something personal if he picked truth, so he went with dare and hoped Clint wouldn't humiliate him.
If that was directed at Peter, he would’ve died from fear right there. Clint, on the other hand, seemed perfectly fine.
Peter silently opened his door and stepped into the hall. It was very quiet, except he was pretty certain it was Tony who was snoring down the hall.
He heard the gun go off just once. He squeezed his eyes shut and sobbed harder. He prayed this was just a nightmare, but it wasn’t.
“Yes, Asgard.”
That was officially the best party Peter's even been to (not that he's actually been to many). Now he was unpacking the few things he had. His room was pretty bland, but it was his.
“Definitely,” he responded with enthusiasm that matched Steve and Tony’s as he followed them inside.
“You are the worst,” Peter called out from under the blanket.
“That’s not going to help, you know. They’re just gonna do the same thing tomorrow and the rest of the school year.”
He lied awake for hours the previous night thinking about his family and Gwen and why he was so scared about making friends. He knew he wasn’t crazy to think that their deaths were all linked and the common factor was him, but he knew there had to be more to it. He knew there was something in his past that he didn’t know about that had to be the reason connecting their deaths because deep down he knew he it wasn’t his fault they were murdered, and he decided he was going to find out about it.
“No, I didn’t lose it. I left it right by my suit, but it wasn’t there when I went to change.”
“What do you mean not interested? You said I was attractive like 5 minutes ago. Are you not gay?” Wade seemed almost desperate for an answer.
It took Peter a minute to formulate is response and MJ’s gaze stayed on him the entire time.
“I lost Steve’s shield! Help me find it!”
He gave up and went back to his room. He was gonna try to get a little bit of sleep before their hearing in the morning.
Steve cut him off quickly, “No, Tony.”
“Alright, fine. You can have an extra day before going back.”
Clint gasped. “Peter is right there! How dare you use such harsh language in front of a child! Capsicle would be so disappointed in you.” Clint reached behind his ears and turned his hearing aids back on.
“I'll have to see if I'm free,” Peter sarcastically replied and flopped back down on his bed.
“I’m taking you down with me, fucker.”
“Hey, Peter, is something wrong?” Ned asked, “You’ve seemed upset all day.”
Peter followed his dad’s directions and after a couple of minutes he had calmed down to a point where he could actually talk.
“I-I don't know. That's a difficult choice,” he finally confessed.
“What is it?” MJ questioned.
Walking in the tower knowing it was now his home felt so much different than last time he was here. He felt so comfortable and safe.
“Peter, are you okay?” MJ asked after watching Peter stare at his desk for a couple minutes, thinking intensely.
His foster parents wanted him gone after the police came, thinking he would cause them more trouble in the future. Peter didn’t care. He was filled with sorrow and convinced he’d never be happy again. It’s not like he even deserved to be happy anyway. The universe gave him 3 clear examples of this.
“He’s almost impossible to wake up this early.”
“It doesn't matter,” Steve responded.
I will be posting sneak peaks for new chapters and new fics on there, and only there. You guys are also free to ask me questions about any of my stories or really anything on there. You can also send me prompts and characters to write about if you want. So please go check it out.
“That was me. I got a new phone yesterday and I thought it would be a funny joke, but now I can see that I let it go for too long. I’m sorry.”
Wade was surprisingly silent. Peter gave him a quizzical look in return.
“Kid?”
Tony responded this time, “Nope. That doesn't matter either.”
“Listen up, you little asshole,” Peter was shocked by the words coming out of his mouth, “You do as I say. You do the chores I tell you to do. You don’t speak unless I say you can. If you don’t follow my rules, prepare to be punished. Do you understand me?”
Peter was absolutely ecstatic. He was overjoyed by the fact his dads were together again, although not in the way he would’ve preferred, but in a way that worked for everyone. He was also glad that Tony and Bucky got along. All Peter wanted was a happy family, and he had it again.
“I will. I love you 3000, Dad,” she replied as she sat up.
“Dad, it’s not just that. People are always coming up to me asking about you guys and the Avengers. I’m so sick of it!” he exclaimed.
‘Fuck!’ Panic began to build in his chest.
“Go on a date with me. I promise you’ll fall in love,” Wade finished with a sing-song voice.
He didn’t get a chance to, though. Once again, Wade showed up and dragged him to his English class. Peter had no clue how he memorized his schedule already, but he was nonetheless grateful for his help.
“I stole Fury’s pager and asked your mom to come home. I know how much you’ve been missing her lately, so I wanted to surprise you.”
“Well, we’ll give you a full tour later, but we have the living areas at the top of the tower, then we have training areas, I have my lab…” Tony continued on until they reached the top floor. The other Avengers were there, but they were fighting over something, it looked like a tv remote, so they didn't notice Tony, Steve, and Peter’s presence.
Peter felt very touched by what Tony said. He never realized how much they wanted him. He felt very loved in this moment. He hugged his dad, tightly.
MJ stayed silent, but gave a Peter a look that pressured him into explaining further.
The ride to school dragged Peter’s mood back down. He usually could ask his dads to join him if he wanted, but today he had no choice in the matter. He rode alone and in silence thinking about how much the day was going to suck.
Peter was surprised that they already had a room for him.
“Wow. I don’t know what to say about all this,” Steve finally spoke.
“Okay,” Steve smiled, “We can take you shopping tomorrow if you'd like.”
“I’m so glad you’re here, Dad,” he commented before hugging them both.
Maria looked over and smiled at her beloved daughter.
Tony sighed. They looked at each for a minute.
Steve and Tony eventually said goodbye to Peter, and headed back home. Neither of them could stop smiling. Steve wrapped his arms around his husband.
“I love you, too. What wish?”
Bucky grabbed the collar of Sam shirt and glared at him.
Once Peter calmed down, they set him on a chair. He saw them whispering in the corner. He couldn’t remember what they were talking about, but he saw the worried looks on their faces. He looked at the spider bite on his arm, now covered by a bandage. He didn’t think the bite was a big deal, besides the fact that it really hurt.
His dads. That would take a while to get used to.
“It’s okay. Do you know when you’re coming home?”
“Wow. Fourteen already?” Morgan nodded happily.
Peter almost lied to them, but he knew they knew the truth. There was just no point in lying at this point.
‘What if this is just some fucked up dream?’
Peter began to feel horribly self conscious so he focused on his feet as he rushed to his first class. Unfortunately, that wasn’t much better than the hallway. All eyes were on him when he entered the classroom, including the teacher’s.
“Ugh,” he groaned, “What do I do then? I never wanted anyone to find out.”
“Tony! Language!” Steve warned him.
Sam rolled his eyes. “Why would I help you find it? It’s your fault you lost it.”
“Not really,” he felt like being honest, “I think I’m gonna go home. I can’t deal with all of this.”
Peter was pretty suspicious, but Natasha intimidated him so he just moved past it.
After spending some time with Clint and Natasha, who were quite entertaining, Peter decided to explore the tower a bit more. He eventually ended up in the Avenger’s gym, which had a lot of specialized equipment for each Avenger to practice their skills, and met up with Thor down there.
It would be a huge adjustment to live here, and it was now really sinking in for Peter. Being the child of billionaire Tony Stark meant he, too, would be a billionaire. Living with him meant living in a fancy penthouse on top of a building he owned. Not to mention, both of his parents would be superheroes. Fucking superheroes! How could he ever possibly live up to that?
“How lucky,” Carol commented, “Hey, let’s go inside. I want to see your mother.”
“I think that depends on your religion? And he keeps it in his room, I believe,” Peter tried to answer honestly.
“Why not? He wants to do it. Let us have a little bit of fun.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Natasha slapped the side of Clint’s head. “One, there's a kid here. Two, horror movies suck.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dare.”
“How’s your day been, Peter?” Miles questioned as they both sat down.
“Yes?”
“You okay, Peter?” Steve asked him.
“They are currently on a mission with the Avengers,” the robotic voice answered plainly.
You know, I met Morgan at the funeral. She’s so much like you already. Smart, brave, and loving. I have a feeling she’ll be following in your footsteps one day, and I know she’ll be just as great as you. Don’t worry, I’ll be looking out for her. I won’t let her get into too much trouble.
“Okay, I think it’s time to go. Peter’s gotta get ready for bed soon,” Tony announced.
“Jarvis, where is Peter?” Tony asked, hoping his son wasn’t dead or had run away.
Tony kissed Steve’s cheek and pulled out of his embrace.
Peter didn’t reply, but he didn’t have to. They all already knew the truth.
“I don’t want to lose you, too,” he sobbed while he hugged her. She hugged him back.
MJ gave him an inquisitive look, but decided not to poke any further. For the rest of the class they just made small talk about school.
Tony quirked his eyebrow and sent a curious glance at the other other. He knew Peter would talk about him, but he wondered what Steve was saying.
The previous day was an eye opening experience for Peter. As much as he hated to admit it, he can’t handle being alone forever.
Peter sighed. As much as he'd love to scream yes, he couldn't shake his past memories. Tony seemed to sense Peter was going to shoot them down again, so he didn't let Peter respond.
Peter glanced over at Ned and Miles, actually hoping they had a million questions to ask him right now. Luckily, they did.
Thor smiled at him. “Oh it’s alright, Peter. Asgardians are much more resilient than humans.”
Later in the day, Steve and Tony gave Peter a tour of the tower. Peter was particularly interested in the labs. He and Tony had many long conversations about science and tech stuff while Steve sat and listened. He didn't really understand what they were talking about.
“They definitely don't mean to. They get very excited about many things - superheroes included.”
“I’m so glad you’re back. I missed you so much and I love you so much. My wish came true!” she cheered.
Peter’s face grew red and he looked away in an attempt to hide it. He had no idea why Wade seemingly liked him or why he even liked him back.
“You look tired. Let's get you to bed.”
“Don’t apologize,” her voice softened, “It wasn’t your fault.”
“Don’t trust Wade, Peter. He’ll screw you then dump you,” MJ warned.
Peter stayed on the floor until he calmed down. He wiped the tears off his face, he didn’t even realise he’d been crying.
He had tried really hard to keep the whole Spider-Man thing a secret because he didn’t want to put himself, May, or his friends in danger. He’s seen what happened to the rest of the Avengers, and he knew he didn’t want that for himself.
“I have my dads. They’re all a need, okay?” Peter stated a bit too aggressively.
He smiled a bit and wiped his face.
When Peter woke up, he glanced towards the window to see that it was considerably darker out then when he arrived home. He figured his dads would be back by now and eating dinner, so Peter groggily dragged himself out of bed and headed for the kitchen. He was surprised, worried, and a bit upset to find it empty still.
“How are you feeling, Dad?”
“You can’t put this off forever,” Tony warned.
When he stepped into the hallway, he got surrounded yet again by a group of excited teens. Panic quickly started to set in, but he felt someone suddenly grab his arm and started pulling him through the crowd.
“Random Artificial Intelligence Name. Listen, she needed a name and I didn't have a lot of time. You try coming up with AI names.”
He wasn't sure if he should help Steve or go do something else, so he stood there awkwardly watching both of them. Tony seemed to take notice.
His parents, Aunt, Uncle, and best friend were all murdered. Peter suffered from depression, anxiety, and PTSD. He also had an alcohol addiction. He had attempted suicide multiple times. This kid was just 15, but he had gone through way too much suffering.
Both Ned and Miles seemed a bit disappointed that Peter didn’t really seem interested in talking to them, so they all worked on the assignment and talked mainly to each other until the end of class. Peter was very grateful to hear the bell when the period ended. Ned and Miles were nice, but they were very draining for Peter.
Peter felt his heart stop as he looked up. A large group of students were surrounding his desk.
“100% Peter. I am irresistible.” Wade winked.
Peter dreaded the thought of school. School already sucked, but knowing he'd be there permanently, and not just a month or two, made it worse. He really wished he'd at least be going to a decent school, and with Tony Stark as his father, he'd probably get that wish.
“Isn't that impossible?” He thought he heard that only Thor could pick it up.
Peter couldn’t control his panic. He thrashed around and accidentally kicked Gwen’s bed. She slowly woke up. Once she realized what was going on, a man stood beside her with a gun to her head. Peter tried to scream.
Peter thought he was in the clear yesterday after making it through the whole day without anyone finding out who exactly he was. Apparently, someone had found out and now everyone knew.
“You know… attractive jocks.”
He decided he should head back to his room before Steve or Tony woke up. He didn't want to worry them.
“To make you squirm :)”
Steve smiled. “That’s great! We’ll have to talk more about this tomorrow, but that’s great. I love you, Tony.”
“You're going to have to behave now. I can't have you switching houses every week. And you're going to be switching schools again, which I'm sure you're used to, but this new school you're going to be at for the next 3 years, so
The longer they talked to Peter, the more they wanted him. He was so much like the both of them. Smart, kind, and brave. They wanted him to be a part of their family so much.
The next foster home he went to was decent. Peter didn’t seem to notice. He spent all day in bed and refused to talk to anyone. One day, after being in that house for a week, he found his foster parents’ alcohol stash. And that’s when Peter started drinking to rid him of his pain. He switched foster homes almost 20 times that year because he’d been caught drinking. Peter didn’t care, he wouldn’t stop drinking. When he drank, he forgot about his parents, Aunt, Uncle, and Gwen.
“Sure,” he said quietly.
“About what?”
Peter was miserably stuck in his current foster home for almost another month. They didn't like him much there, but he never gave them a reason to kick him out. He just wanted to be with Steve and Tony in the Avengers Tower; he really missed them.
He sighed in defeat. “Fine.”
“Would you like a tour?” Steve asked politely.
“Truth!” Clint seemed to be very excited that Peter was playing with him.
Well, at least not much good happened to him after his 5th birthday. That was the day his life went to shit, and except for a few short moments the universe granted him, Peter knew he’d never feel happiness again.
“When are they going to get back?” He could feel his anxiety growing every second.
“Ugh. You never let me have fun.”
“Well I have too much energy to go back to sleep. I have to do something.”
Peter groaned, “School.”
“Hey. We don't have to talk about anything if it makes you uncomfortable,” Tony said softly.
Monica stepped to the side and signaled for Carol to walk in.
Peter shrugged his shoulders. “I'm fine. I don't feel like talking about it.”
“Okay, dinner’s ready.”
Peter felt very touched by that comment. He knew he had a long way to go in his journey for improving his mental health, but he was also happy to know he was capable of having good days still. Hopefully he could continue his streak tomorrow.
Steve shook his head in disappointment and stepped forward to break the pair up. He was already late, and he didn’t want to have to stop a full blown fight between his two hot headed friends.
“Are you new here?” he questioned.
Peter was tired and leaned against Tony's shoulder. He thought about whether or not he'd actually get to live with the Avengers.
He barely managed to let out a “yes.”
“Thanks for having me tonight, Steve. It was a lovely evening, and it was good to see you again. And to meet Bucky.”
“Fine. I will cuddle with you for a bit.”
“What did he do?” Peter was confused.
Tony paused. “No. I’m sorry. Will you be okay for tonight? Or do you want me to call someone?”
Steve and Tony glanced at each other. They silently debated it for a moment before Tony gave the final verdict.
“My birth parents died when I was young. Then my aunt and uncle adopted me. They died, too. And then my best friend died. I can’t shake the fear that they could die, too. The tower is safe, but I have no clue what’s going on out there. I don’t think I could handle losing them, too. And I’m worried about what would happen to me if they died. I can’t go back to foster care.”
Peter had been sitting in a separate room for over 30 minutes. He told himself not to care, but this was the closest he’s ever gotten to being adopted. He had the tiniest bit of hope deep down inside him that he would actually get adopted and finally be able to be happy. He knew that was nonsense though. Of course they wouldn’t want him after they saw his file.
She can’t help but stare at him as he leaves, since he’s the first man she’s seen in person for years.
Time: 1000
She took the papper in her hands and in the corner. A small memorial peice mentions driver, Edwin Jarvis also persihed in the crash. He was a foot note in the story or Maria and Howard. He barley got two inches.
Submit or be submitted. And that’s exactly what she did. She rolled over and played it safe.
The perfect cover, she as the focal point of the party, allowing her to talk to anyone and everyone, especially her target.
“I don’t either.” He kissed her softly and left.
Svetlana shuffles towards her, gun cocked, she holds it steady against Lara’s head, and she goes silent, whimpering softly, “Please God, please forgive me. I’m sorry God. I don’t want to die, I don’t want-”
“Neutralize as in kill?” Toni says,
Her successful mission was a show of good faith. Lucifer living up to her name. Evil, cruel, and unbothered by moral tethers was a good reputation for an asset. But those who knew her code name didn’t know she spent nights in her bed sobbing, or lying on her kitchen floor silently staring at the ceiling.
Steve hesitated, and Amanda groaned, “Oh my god, that sounded so stalkery.”
She didn’t have to worry about being stir crazy for much longer, because as seven months set in she didn’t want to leave her bed, let alone her apartment. She watched documentaries, of many different varieties, historical, scientific, and some specifically about pregnancy.
“Why?”
It was weeks till she worked up the courage to make her first recording, and it wasn’t for the person she really wanted to talk to. Pepper was a safe bet. Caring, non judgmental. She could confess her sins, and she had no grievances against the woman, her best friend.
“No. I’ve been here for a while. Besides, that’s your private information. If you wanted me to know, you’d tell me.”
But when it’s over, they’re both panting, Manya turns towards her affectionately, and Toni lets her cuddle a moment. She squeezes her eyes shut, as little tears pool in the corners. This was supposed to be the start of the mission. The seduction. She had months to work with, and this was the perfect start to it.
“So it was your first kiss.” Sindy sat down right next to Toni, and Elle sat further away.
Howard no longer entertains at his own house, since people were starting to notice, but instead hosts a weekly poker night where rich men gamble away their pocket money.
Finally, he has a shot, their back is turned and they’re running to the edge of the building when Steve throws his shield. His head snapped towards Steve suddenly, and he catches the saucer with ease, before sending it right back.
And he watched her go, down the hallway and thinks maybe she’ll just leave and he’ll never see her again.
Comments are like oxygen, I can't breath without. Drop a compliment, comment, or concern below and I'll reply shortly! Thanks to my beta Balletgrl046, you're a peach!
“I didn’t either, I got out.”
The girls moved towards the door where Toni stood, they must’ve been drunker than Howard because they fell all over themselves.
“And therefor, not expendable.” Matveev smiles, “Unlike Svetlana, two of you are expendable.”
Toni grinned, “Yeah, like children of multi billionaire’s whose parents die. Rich orphans.”
“Meet who?” Toni said again, “What was he?”
“You didn’t tell me?” Rhodey exclaimed, “Did you tell the father?”
“Pep and Rhodey? Yeah.”
“Toni?” He says, turning over towards her, “You awake?”
“They won’t help.”
Brynn flashed her a looked, and Toni backtracked, “No no no, that’s not what I meant, I mean we are together and we are having sex. Or were.”
“So, that was nice.” He said
“Have you ever kissed a boy?” Elle asked
Target: Thanos
“I’ve left you a change of clothes on the table to the far left, be quick and come this way when you’re done.” She turns on her heel, and leaves Antonia in the room.
Advanced biochemistry, thermodynamic theory, monetary econ, and her least favorite, home ec.
“Fury offered me a job. At SHIELD.” Toni says, “But you knew that.”
“Steve! Less flirting more fighting!” Sam cries out taking to the sky to support Nat as she starts to attack the soldier, and disarms him.
Where the Red Room was dark, and imposing, the Velyka Zhytomyrska Hotel was sleek and futuristic, both buildings made Toni uneasy.
She couldn’t finish, she didn’t want to.
“Why do we need to?” one girl in the front of the class said, and Toni scoffed to herself,
“You’re Black Wid-” Toni stopped, as the woman raised her pointer finger to her mouth, shhhing her from far away. As Toni stepped closer to the car, the woman smiled and pivoted away, down the hallway.
She stood there a moment silently, before he said, “I lost Peggy! The last person left in my life. You don’t know what that’s like.”
“Nika here has been spreading lies.”
“Yes. I love you Toni.”
“I knew she was familiar. All the cuts and bruises made it harder to see, but that’s Toni Stark. Call her offices, look for that Potts woman she’s always running around with.”
Toni whirled around suddenly, and Eva almost ran into her, “Are you sure you’re not afraid of me?”
Silently the guards and Instructors leave them once they’ve be subdued, and they sit alone in silence.
Shit, now they knew. Now everyone would know.
“Thank you, one of my talents is finding stupid things to be angry about.” She grinned, and walked up to him,
“Follow him.” He said, and the second man went down the steep path after the driver.
After finding the solution, and sending Vanko back to Siberan prison, she comes out of her lab for the first time for a bit. She added a communal floor because apparently everyone likes the chit chat over breakfast, and since it’s closest, she heads there for ceral.
Target: Antonia Sobol
-May 23rd
“No.” She pauses, “I mean before that. Before my kidnapping.”
“Never again?” Antonia replied, she didn’t trust the stranger, but she could recall the sensation of a slap across the face as tears ran down her cheeks, “Please please please, I’m sorry.” She felt the memory like it’d just happened seconds ago, but it was like one piece of a puzzle, and she was missing the rest.
“Pray tell, how do you know these things?” She asks
“You seem to hate me.” He says, looking up from his food, “I don’t know why.”
Toni’s heart is racing, she can’t sit up and she can’t talk but she doesn’t want this, she needs this baby to live.
He stepped a little closer, “I’m sorry. Do you know why you were being chased?”
“That’s alright, you can call me Toni.” Why not make friends with your dad’s prostitutes, what could go wrong.
“Fucking hell Maria! Don’t be such a bitch!” Howard stood up from the table suddenly shaking the glasses and plates and stormed off towards his room.
Natasha murmurs, “More than we can say for him.”
She gestured towards the open door, and Toni started walking through it, limping slightly, where Eva hid tried to kick in her knee when the trial began, the Instructors stayed inside watching and cleaning the room.
“I’d like you to show me what’ve you’ve learned from me so far. The first girl to go on Pointe will probably be victorious today.”
“Steve did you read any of the files Natasha and I released?” Toni says,
She, despite apperences, was ready to curl up and die. She gifted Rhodey a suit very subtly so he didn’t suspect a thing. She had copies of tech plans and JARVIS’s access code for Bruce. A modified armor for Nat, heet seaking arrows for Clint, chest plates that reflect bullets for Thor ,and even a refinished sheild with a more accseible grip in the back, for Rogers.
“It’s gonna be okay, Peter. I think you should go talk to Tony about this and see what he thinks you should do. He knows a lot more about this stuff than I do, but I do know this isn’t the end of the world.”
“I just wanted to say that I love you, Peter. I’m glad you’re my best friend.”
Steve and Tony finished up and headed back into the dining room where Peter was hugging Bucky goodbye.
“No, but come on. It'll be fun,” he tried to convince them, “Here, Peter you can ask me first.”
“I’ll miss you, too, Dad. I love you.”
“We know a lot of bad stuff happened to you, but you don't have to worry anymore. We'll protect you, and you won't hurt us. And maybe you can be happy, too.”
She picked up the helmet and pressed it forehead against hers.
Peter relaxed and smiled back before jumping back into his conversation with Bruce.
“Hey, I'm serious about the behaving thing, Peter,” Alex warned him again.
Tony laughed loudly. “Of course not. You need school.”
He looked back towards Alex. He said things were different now. Peter wished he could fully believe him, but he didn't. Though, being the idiot he was, he decided to take a chance anyway. He turned back to the door.
Also, thank you for everything you’ve done for me. I honestly still don’t know why you chose to find me and mentor to me back in 2016, but I will be eternally grateful for that. I was a scared, confused kid with powers I would’ve never imagined having, and you helped me become a real hero.
Peter ran over and gave Alex a big hug. It would be sad to not see Alex again. He was always there for Peter. He was the reason Peter was still alive right now. Most importantly, he never gave up on Peter, and he was so grateful for that.
“Wow. Little mean, but okay,” Tony replied as he got out of bed.
“You’ve got nothing to worry about, Peter. My dad’s a cop. We’ll be safe.”
They both smiled at him. “That sounds perfect,” Steve told him and hugged him again.
For dinner, it was just Peter, Steve, and Tony. They told Peter that he would have a chance to hang out with the rest of the Avengers later.
Once they were certain he was fine, they went back to eating. There was awkward silence for a minute.
“Well, I’m not sure how much you already know about my past, but my parents died a while ago, definitely before you were born. It was a car accident and it happened after I got in an argument with my father. We didn’t have the best relationship, but it still messed me up because of the things I said before they left. And my mother…” he trailed off and paused for a minute to compose himself.
“Wait,” Monica called out, “Mom you don’t even seem surprised.”
“Yes,
Tony smiled at his son’s hopefulness. He loved how he always tried to find the good any situation.
“Ok good. So what was that all about?”
Monica threw open the front door. She heard the tv on in the living room. She quickly tossed her blanket on the nearest chair before dashing over to her other mom. She signaled for Carol to wait outside the room.
Peter didn't want to bother them. JARVIS didn't respond, so Peter assumed he wouldn't tell Steve or Tony.
“Yeah. Come here, Peter. Meet Pepper Potts.”
Peter sighed. “At least tell me you picked a good school.”
“I’m sorry. I’m a bit overwhelmed right now,” Peter apologized and took a deep breath to calm himself.
Peter giggled, “RAIN?”
“What if you come and visit the tower for day? You could meet everyone, I'll show you my lab, and we could show you your room.”
Peter rolled his eyes. As much as he appreciated Wade helping him out, he didn’t like how “lovey-dovey” Wade acted towards him.
Peter nodded. He’s never heard of that place before. Was it a country? Peter wasn’t great with geography, but he was sure if Asgard was a country all the immature kids at school would have had a grand time making jokes out of it.
Toni’s face shone with pride at his defense, but when he hung up he angrily hit her with the back of his hand, landing right on her cheekbone.
They scurried away, leaving the empty wet pot before her.
Finally one of the doctors turns to the screen, “ON, we’re going to begin the process of waking him. We’ll move him to the set stage.”
Petra dramatically walked towards the mat, “Oooh I’m so scared. Try not to kill anyone this time Sobol?”
All she can think about is her escape, and how it’s going to be much different from Tania’s.
“Well, I have a fantastic solution to that.” Steve gently pulled off Toni’s shirt, before his own, while she worked on her jeans. “Isn’t Bruce dropping by tomorrow?” Steve said suddenly, “So maybe I shouldn’t sleep over.”
The words shock Annie, she considered her own words before speaking, “Because I’m rich? Because I went to the Oscars?”
“Well it is.” She says, “She’s been forcing you to the top since before you got here.”
Lara stands up, her legs are shaking so hard, it takes her a moment to walk towards them. Matveev gestures to a chair next to her, and Lara sits down, her legs shaking. She takes two straps of duck tape around Lara’s wrists.
The teacher usually took their side, because they had more numbers, and asked Antoinette to sit with her for the rest of recess. She didn’t mind really, because it was more fun than sitting alone, but the taunts they sent her on the way back to the classroom when the teacher wasn’t looking, made her blood boil. Antoinette didn’t really know why she followed this routine, the definition of insanity was repeating the same action over and over and expecting a different result, so maybe she was insane. They never relented, they never let her play, they never even considered taking pity on her. But she continued her path every recess.
Someone must’ve tipped off Coulson or Fury or someone that she was dieing, but whoever is was she’s pissed and greatful. It isn’t so easy to hate Howard when he technically saved her life, and because of that she can’t hate Rogers so much.
“Madame!” Katya says, “Please, I haven’t done anything wrong! She disobeyed your orders, she’s the weak one!”
Toni smiled, “New York City.” Home.
“Yes Steve. I read them before I showed them to you.” She replied, she’d read them six time, annotated it three times, reorganized it once, and burned it twice. Because she knew what this would do to them.
Date: April 4th, 1996
“It’s not the typical kind. No swing set.” She smiled, “We own forty acres, half of which is dense forest, just outside the mansion. There is an electric fence surrounding it. ”
“I was seventeen. Lucie had just died, I was fucking anything that moved and I messed up my pill, so I took a vacation and have been trying to drink myself to death for about two years.”
They all sat in the family room, pretending to watch some home improvement show. Clint glanced over and awkwardly met her eyes for just a second, before looking away. Some spy.
“There are better ways to become an Avenger.”
Nika laughs, and the room goes quiet a moment. She turns to Tania and makes eye contact that says it all. Tania looks furious, the whisper start again in a few seconds, but it felt like a lifetime.
“Where do I know you from?”
The conspiracy theories around Toni’s sexuality got worse by the day, and she had quite a few more days of eighth grade at this school. Her room was empty, Willa, her new roommate didn’t stick around long, only slept in the shared room once a week.
“You can’t tell my dad.” Toni said quietly
She knew it wouldn’t go well. She knew he’d overreact. But she couldn’t keep coddling him, he was an adult.
Francesca smiled, “You know a lot about world wars, don’t you?”
“Come on Sobol.” She said, grabbing Toni’s wrist and sharply pulling her onto the mats, “it’s too late to back out now.”
“Why?” Koila asks
“You can tell the truth.”
She strides through it, towards Madame’s office, for her debrief.
It’s just in time too, because Zma announces their first sparring match, the following day.
Brynn was beautiful without trying. Not like Toni who wasn’t bad looking but as previously mentioned, could look better.
“Yeah, because you don’t do anything any yet you have everything. Everyone says your this genius like your father, but I think it’s all a ruse so that they can make your inherit the company when your daddy gets tired or runs off with some bitch.”
Unlike the other girls, Tania didn’t retreat into herself after the murder. Mila, and Toni became more quiet and reserved, even though no one even knew Toni murdered Nika.
She’d been having a good day, a good week even, which was a rare commodity. Howard sent her a note congratulating her on being on the dean's list, and Toni knew it was only because Maria caught him with her new mistress, and wanted some good will with his daughter, but she didn’t care.
She takes a deep breath, “No.”
“You’ve killed people’s parents, you’ve killed people’s kids. Why shouldn’t they come after you?”
“We’ll figure it out when we get to it.”
Toni steps off her own stool, “I’d like to hear a story. Tell me something about yourself.”
The headmistress takes Lucie away that night, and she’s sent home soon after. Toni stays, and for the short rest of the year she silently takes wild looks from the other girls, she hears lesbian, dyke, slut tossed around but the emptiness numbs her and she barely notices.
“It’s no matter now. The girls dead, the elimination was successful. However, this class has a rare case. There were two weak links at once.”
It’s a days walk to the mansion but she makes it. Only running into Eva once, but carefully avoids her by ducking under cover.
A heavy weight settled in Toni’s stomach, and she silent listened to her new friends theorize about how awful the next three years would be if they had to talk to or even look at Lucette Steele or Antoinette Stark for hours.
He doesn’t think much of the call from Pierce the next day. Maybe it’s to debrief or tell him who’ll be taking over Fury’s position. He doesn’t see it coming, not by a long shot.
“Yes, Lucette Steele will be in attendance. I suggest you behave yourself.” Maria continued primly, “Her father is one of Howard’s biggest competitors, so a friendship between you two could be bad. Let alone a...” Maria didn’t finish her sentence.
Zma gave her an amused look, but shook her head, “I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I’ve explained the rules many times. One knock down is all that is required to win a match at this time. Multiple rounds of fighting will be introduced later, I promise.”
“What am I doing here?” Nika says, breathlessly, “What are you doing here?”
It wasn’t till they’d found the safe SHIELD car parked two blocks down that Natasha turned to her, “Did you shoot him?”
The dark winding road lulled Toni to sleep for the very last time. It was a weightless sleep that filtered dreams in and out, none of them mattered though, all she could feel was calmness. It’s only fitting she was woken sharply, by the screech of metal against metal, followed by a crash. The car was firmly wedged into the highway side rail.
She stops putting her jeans on suddenly, of course that’s why. He wanted an out. “Ok. I understand.”
“It didn’t really come up,” She pauses wiping a runaway tear, “till now. She’s sick. She’s in New York. I think I have to give a blood transfer or something.”
“A lot of things. Most of it’s making fun of you for stupid stuff, like your accent, or ‘amnesia’. Some of it though, she was disappointed in herself. She broke her toe the next day getting herself on Pointe.”
The kids on the playground were cruel. That is the first lesson Antoinette ever learned at school. Other children might have learned their colors, or days of the week, but they didn’t start Kindergarten two years ahead, and they didn’t wait until May to join the class. She’s had to wait till May, because the school refused to have a two year old enrolled in preschool, and her birthday was very unfortunately late in the year. So maybe if she had started school with everyone else, she’d have some friends by now, because she wasn’t necessarily smaller than the other kids, and she certainly wasn’t stupider, she was just different, like a variable thrown in at the last minute. So Antoinette could understand why the kids didn’t really talk to her, or let her play, but she still didn’t appreciate it.
“Did they say she couldn’t?” Madame asks, smiling amused.
“No, these heels hurt and my thong is riding up my ass.”
Target: Winter Soldier
“You weren’t exactly on call.” She tapped her fingers together, “He knew. He didn’t want to be involved I guess. Or maybe he didn’t want to be involved with me. It doesn’t really matter now Alex is dead.”
When she finally let go and stopped, Toni was breathless, “But..but isn’t that illegal? I’m underage.”
The hospital is grim and clean. He wants to comfort Natasha somehow, but can’t figure out what would help. He doesn’t know how close they were.
Francesca was not invited to dinner ever, Antoinette didn’t know where she ate. She wished Francesca was here because Father was sick or something, sick and angry, he moved slowly and talked mostly gibberish, but still managed to cuss out Mother.
“So a fake death? Nice, classic. Let’s see, Filippov was in 99’, Krupin in 02’, then Sobol right after.” He paused, “It’s not Sobol, is it? Lucifer herself?”
“Yeah, you are. You’ve been redeemed. You can move on.” She pauses looking towards the papers, “I never can.”
Only the look of pure fear Katya had in her eyes as the last drops of blood drained from her neck, and the light disappeared in her pupil.
Toni couldn’t see anything, but she heard everything.
Toni shrugged, “OK, well then you’re to most famous kidnappee.”
She set it down gently, turning towards him. “I’m an orphan.”
He’ll deal with them in a minute, all he can concentrate on is catching the guy.
“Last night, and Maria said no, and you said-”
“You heard him.” Toni’s voice cracked, “He did it.”
“Ironic that you taught me how to find people like you, that you engineered your own assassin.”
“What reason?” He says
The Orlov girl, Kayta Toni thought, looked down at her feet a moment and said nothing, so the Instructor went on with her lesson, explaining the phonetics of French and Bulgarian to them.
“I mean, if Eva dies in this trial, it’ll be you and me in the final. But we’re not killing each other.”
Manya’s face changes in seconds, from confusion to worry, “I’m so sorry. How rude of me. I’m Manya Volkov, you must be Anya, the lady of the party.”
She paused as if waiting for a response, “I lost someone. Again. Didn’t think I could take it again, but here I am. Still standing no matter how much I wish I wasn’t.”
He doesn’t say anything, just looks down at her, and she pauses a moment before pushing one of the heavy doors open. When she turns to look back, he’s already making his way down the hallway.
It was another moment before Toni got a good hold on her, and restrained her from struggling and getting away.
“You’re Howard’s daughter,” Steve says finally,
They all eventually stood up and followed Toni down the stairs, where the robot sat. She pressed her buttons, and once again it beeped on, before the arm began to move.
“You didn’t know your own name?” Nika says, stepping closer,
Toni could see the slight cracks in Coulson's normally neutral face, she’d almost surprised him, she’d almost made him blush or laugh or prove he was human in some way. But not quite. One day.
If she were here, she’d send him that look. The one that said go for it, you idiot.
Since I haven't posted in 84 years I haven't been validated in a while so go encourage me to write more and save me and my therapist half an hour this Tuesday. I've also met a really cute boy in fiction club and he reads and I love him and I can't tell anyone so I thought I'd tell you.
“It wasn’t like that.” Toni says quietly, “I confided in her, I think we were friends.”
“I’ve been waiting to see you, and I must say I’m not disappointed. Beautiful, and a reputation for intelligence, you really are the perfect candidate.”
“Because I’ve been destroying you in physics and astronomy for a year?”
Jarvis replaced Francesca, Maria hired him, not Father. Annie saw a pattern, whenever Father hired someone, they were young and female and left rather quickly, with the exception of Francesca, but whenever Maria hired someone, they were older, not exclusively male but might as well have been, and they always died before Maria or Father could fire them, with the exception of Jarvis.
“She was afraid they’d take her off.” Nika says, “Nothing's worse than not being on Pointe she says.” She glances at her feet a second, “Maybe it’s for the best I’ve been thrown out of her group.”
With renewed adrenaline, they approach the two, sure enough, the soldier manages to toss the woman backward again and reoriented himself towards Steve.
“I can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic.”
Toni nodded, it was the most extreme version yet, but she had the advantage. She’d been on twice as many missions as them combined, some of which were in similar conditions. Maybe she could hide for a while and let them tire themselves out.
His mind reeling after his tense discussion with Fury, Steve hopped up the stairs of his new apartment.
“Seems like it’s working right now.”
The whole group goes silent. For just a moment. Svetlana barks back, “What?”
“No.” Toni shakes her head, “That’s what you called me. My name is Antoinette Stark.”
“Hi, I’m Maia.”
The girl nodded silently, “Why are you here?”
And that’s how ‘Lucifer’ would be retired.
“Oh honey.” Toni said , “You don’t have to get me drunk for me to fuck you. I’ve already had a shitty night so let’s cut to the chase, find a big ass bed in this big ass mansion and let’s stock up on more shit to tell our therapists in twenty years.”
She runs upstairs, and cries “Dad! Dad! My robot worked!” fprgetting he had company and only just noticing the table full of suprised faces, and the one annoyed face,
Toni glanced at the mats, not returning her banter, and Petra groaned in frustration. It’d become a game to try to get a reaction out of Toni since last week. Spilling food on her, tripping her in the halls, and hiding her uniforms was just some of their favorite methods of torment.
“At least I’m not wetting the bed every other night,” Tania remarks,
Finally, as he neared the top of the next flight of stairs, the door to his apartment was in view, he strode towards it when someone flung open their own door and rushed out barging into him.
“What? What do you mean? I have to come back?”
The table was clear, and they still sat there, for minutes before Mother stood up and started walking towards her room, Antoinette followed.
Targets were high profile people, celebrities or inventors, he started to wonder who Toni really was.
“Madame,” Toni said, she felt like her whole body was shaking, but her hands and voice were firm. “Am I done now?”
“Why didn’t you reveal your identity when you came back?” Steve said,
Toni rolled her eyes. Was this it? She was pressuring her to practically kill herself for fear of being outed as crazy?
“Didn’t have to run to knock the smirk of you.”
“You’re wrong. He wouldn’t drive. He didn’t.”
“Quel temps fait-il Markov?” She started easy with the weather. Markov, the first girl in line was short and plump. They hadn’t started combat training yet, but she’d be in a world of trouble when they did.
She wanted to scream, she wanted to scare them. She’d certainly been scared.
Her eyes shot open, she knew how far to push, and where to throw, she’d made precise calculations and it ensured accuracy and success. When she threw the ball forward her breath hitched with the crowd of children, she involuntarily closed her eyes and opened only in time to see it swoosh into the ring, no rim, only net.
“Yeah you don’t do anything! I worked to get here I didn’t sit on my ass and have things handed to me! You’ll learn what it’s like to struggle real soon.” Sasha reached forward and pushed Lucette, who at the last second grabbed the railing and only fell on her butt.
Date: June 26th, 1999
“That’s quite enough chit chat girls.” A sharpening clicking sound alerts Toni to Madame’s presence, “I’m afraid you’ll both have to be punished.”
“Yeah? Why?”
“Who was it?” He said finally as a pause, “Did you have some secret relationship no one knows about or was it-”
“Am I leaving soon?”
“Alex?”
They walk slowly down the hall, only a few doors down is Manya’s room. It’s filled with a dresser and a mirror, and a closet, not to mention clothes are stacked on top of each other in the back of the room.
“You got back just in time, we nearly finished moving him.” Coulson mused, suddenly another agent popped in the door, “Agent Coulson, we’ve got a hit in New Mexico. Come see.”
“Yeah, probably pulled in by a horse drawn carriage.”
“I’m on the pill.” She replied, despite the fact her plane to new york from LA had messed up her whole schedule, she had total trust in the magic of modern contraceptive medicine.
“Unimportant. What’s all this?” She gestures to the many boxes of files and paper, some paper is just spread out on the floor in no particular manner of organization.
“Don’t you start turning this on me young lady.” She can practically see his blood pressure rising.
She never took it as a compliment, because it didn’t mean much. She had nothing to do with her beauty.
“Why don’t we all venture down and take a look, this game is stiff anyways.”
She missed one or two meals a day, spending her minimal off time in an empty classroom doing crunches and pushups. Despite being relatively small, at only eleven and surrounded by fourteen year olds, she had considerable muscle mass at this point.
But Tania was better than she looked, with a grin she slid just out of the way, and caught Toni from behind with another hit.
“Really? Howard?” He must’ve realized that he repeated himself, “I mean, where is he now?”
She definitely didn’t expect that one.
September 10th, 2001
She must’ve been an odd sight. A young woman dressed as a maid, walking down a street that was getting busier and busier as she neared the city. She ignored a few leers, and men offering her rides, tuning them out the same way she turned her classmates out for years.
Instead she looked at him, they were closer now, she could smell the booze on his breath. They’d been taught how to deal with alcohol. The kinds of it, it’s effects, and that you should avoid it on missions, because it made you sloppy. She certainly could confirm that by the way Mazur seemed to be holding on to her for stability as well as control.
She couldn’t hear much, but his grunting and her own sniffling, but she thought she could make out the click of a lock behind her, Mazur didn’t notice, till a tall blonde lady was behind him with a small needle in his neck. He fell into her arms quickly and she dragged him onto the bed.
-The hotel is a real 5-star hotel and it looks pretty awesome and is poorly described due to the horrible mess in the story.
Her daughter’s name was Maia.
“So Svetlana Alekseev killed her.”
“We began this class with twelve students.” Toni furrowed her brow. The class had begun before her arrival though,
Asset: Asset Name Confirmed, Awaiting Final Candidate
She’d initially set out to find somewhere to set up some sort of hideout for an easy escape route, but all the windows were barred, very small and very close to the ceiling, and she’d yet to come across any doors.
“I asked the boys to play ball. They said no, so I asked for one chance to make a shot.”
It was heavy and quick the first time, but as they went it got slower and longer, she didn’t mind. Halfway through their third time he whispered, “Should we have used a condom?”
Looking back on things Lucie said, everything fit together like a puzzle piece, she told Toni how the school they were at was different, even though she was being bullied and teased, it was for different things. Previously, Toni assumed, she’d been teased for being weak and fragile and hollow, because she was always sick. Now they were teasing her for being rich, but they were after Toni too so she didn’t feel alone.
“No. I was never a handler for Russian assets, but I had my own pet project. The soldier, of course. I organized all his missions going back thirty years.”
The day is worse than the others for whatever reason. Only one other girl in the class has been given a real life mission, and from what she could tell, Eva’s mission didn’t go well.
Manya’s father was an untrusting man, and he was hard set in his ways. He’d allowed his daughter to go unmarried, but this would be the final straw.
“And I’m the last?” She says,
He’d been hit, and it wasn’t good. Steve turned towards the window and got a look at the shooter, dressed in all black and running. He started towards him when Fury grabbed his wrist.
He didn’t appreciate her lack of fear and sent her on an impossible list of chores. But she had the backing of the KGB to help her complete them, and he couldn’t help but be impressed.
At twenty three years old, even though she doesn’t believe in god, Toni thinks whomever is pulling the strings up there has it out for her.
“Toni.” He said nothing else, but his eyes were questioning everything. She realized he had absolutely no idea what had happened. He didn’t even know if he was a father. She wanted to cry, imagining going through what happened again. Would he blame her for killing their baby?
Pepper, (her new assistant), saved her. She should’ve been able to take him, but the reactor left her weak. Weaker than she’d ever been before.
While the most exciting part of this trial will be the shootouts, Toni is left to take care of the boring bits, while she waits for Tania or Eva to find her.
Toni searches the room, no one reacts for a moment and Toni wonders if they’ll just kill anyone who raises their hand.
It’s fine, she’s fine. Being with him was getting old anyways. She’ll do it by herself.
She needed to do this as fast as possible before they whipped the ball out of her hands and laughed her off the property. Her mind raced, and span because she was not used to this uncertainty, this time yesterday she was sitting quietly with the teacher and now she was shooting basketballs in front of her whole class.
“You’re much smaller than us, always have been.” She starts, “Some girls here are petite, but you always looked younger. Besides, you’re much less… developed.”
“That’s rich coming from you.”
“Coming!” She drops her shoes and bag by the door, walks into the kitchen. Steve is mixing something on the stove and the world news channel is on.
Losing Lucie is incomparable to pain Toni’s felt before. She has felt pain, plenty of times but crying about this seems ridiculous and weak. Toni’s knows’ she’s made of diamonds.
Her left leg was suddenly free, and she rammed it into Eva’s stomach. The girl doubled over in pain and fell to the side, Toni shot up from the ground and waited just a moment for the girl to turn over onto her back.
Eva steps back in line, and stares straight ahead, refusing to turn to Toni.
“Bad week?” Toni said finally, and Nika looked at her surprised, as if she forgot Toni was there.
Toni had gotten boobs recently, and she very much enjoyed them. They could be a hassle on stairs, and jump roping was a forgotten memory, but they made dresses look older, more sophisticated. They weren’t even that big, probably would get bigger after she got her period, but Toni felt a sense of accomplishment at managing to obtain boobs.
“So you have kissed a girl.”
“Katya! Please she’ll kill you!” Toni pleads, “She thinks you’re weak, but you’re not!”
“No you can’t, Judyta. It’s over.”
In just a moment she was free from both sets of shackles, and started to undo Toni’s.
She gets home and regrets every decision she has ever made. Why did she talk to her, why did she say stupid things? Why can’t she be normal.
He was smelly and fat, not necessarily the worst thing someone could be, but paired with an uneven temper, and incredibly boring interests, she could barely stand the sight of him, let alone to spend time with him.
But she was late for her plane.
“Stark’s are made of iron.” She said
Sasha was standing close by with her parents, her grin was malleolus and it grew as she stalked over to Toni.
The hardest part of her life was lying. Everything was a lie.
A body was waiting there, burnt to a crisp, unrecognizable. But the same height and weight as Toni. She’d flee, leaving the corpse, and some manservant who wouldn’t want to admit his failure. The Red Room would be alerted of her failure and subsequent death.
But instead of running, or crying, she smiled.
Toni sighed, “It’s fine. It would have come out anyways. I’m sorry I was a bitch to you at first. No one deserves to be treated like that Lucette.”
“I mean, you said either you die or Eva does, and I could die too. I’d actually say Eva’s pretty keen on the idea.”
But it still shocked her, she still sat in her room and marveled at the fact that Toni ‘ice queen’ Stark, who prided herself of being made of diamond, untouchable but mortal emotions, was crying, sobbing infact. Like a child.
He nodded, accepting her story but took a step closer, “There’s a stain on my sheets.”
She fell to the ground in shock, and he said nothing, eventually leaving. Maria, who was now back at home, found Toni on the ground, and for the first time in ten or so years, gently picked her up, helped her to the bathroom, and gently applied concealer to her cheek. Before placing a light blue pill on the counter.
“Am I being eliminated?” Toni said, “Is that why I’m here?” Her heart started to pound, so she tried to steady her breath, Madame just laughed,
Sasha, to the least, was shock. Toni had always been quiet, even when they were friends. She looked like she was about to retort when Toni grabbed Lucette’s hand and hauled her back to their room. Neither spoke till they were safe inside.
Rumors flew around that the guards indulged in the prisoners on the way to execution, and Toni’s stomach turned at the very thought, but right now her only focus was leaving this country having completed the mission.
“Yeah.”
He stops, his hand had been clenched. That was exactly what he’d been planning on doing.
She paused, “Agent 13, I was assigned to watch over you.”
“You ever seen Lucette Steele on TV?”
They begin down the depression in the land, but Toni can see the road from here, they’re so close,
“Yours?”
“I know.” Toni replied,
“Oh no, you didn’t think that was free?” Toni pauses, “Did you?”
“It’s not,” Fury shifted, “My wife kicked me out.”
He looked oddly at peace when he went, with a shaky breath, like the last exhale of an angry life.
The baby didn’t come quick, or easy. It was long pushes and hours and hours of pain. But the cry of a newborn silenced everyone in the room, before the nurse could speak Toni cried in Italian, “Non dirmi cos'è, non voglio saperlo.” Don’t tell me what it is. I don’t want to know.
“I have a bad memory, besides there’s not much to tell.”
“You cunt.” Toni murmurs, she pauses a moment, allowing for the adrenaline to wear off, if she’d been shot but hadn’t noticed.
But she remembered Eva’s words. She was past redemption. Wherever she was going she prayed she wouldn’t see anyone she loved there. And if either of them deserved to go to hell, it was Eva.
The remaining ten girls stared at her wide eyes a moment, before a petite girl, Lidia, raised her hand. “Did she rely too much on her larger size?”
“I said eliminate her.” Madame said, and Toni didn’t respond to start to act so she stepped closer, almost on the mat, “Antonia Sobol. Kill her, she’s lost.”
She realizes she’s forgotten her mission. The soldier is still out there. He could be close. And she couldn’t take him out under Hydra’s thumb. She had to go somewhere Hydra didn’t like to go. Where the KGB couldn’t track her down.
“I’ll never go willingly. Never.” Toni said, “I don’t work with murderers.”
With the momentum from landing her kick, she swung the second guard over her shoulder and on top of the first. They laid there groaning, as if unable to comprehend being taken down by a girl half their size in thirty seconds.
“We don’t have rights!” She cried, “We lost them when we got careless, reckless. When people got hurt, we lost them.”
“Sobol.” Madame said, and Toni looked towards her, trying to keep her expression even, “Eliminate her.”
“Tell me your story. Just like Nika. Tell me what happened and put me out of my misery. Don’t let Eva get this. Don’t let her win.”
“That sucks.” Toni said, tapping lighter punches on the pads so she could talk, “I’m sorry Tania treats you like that. All of you.”
Maybe she’d stop drinking all together, as long as she was being told to, or forced too, she wasn’t giving up any power. And it felt pretty shitty to be drunk or hungover all the time.
Tania and Eva nodded, so Toni accepted the explanation, “I could recount the death tolls if you wish, who was killed. When and where.” She pauses and Toni swears Madame purposefully makes eye contact with her, “And by whom.”
The rest of the day Toni numbs herself. She goes through classes like a vegetable, answer only a few questions, and trying to ignore the whispers of her classmates.
Madame always talked about death like others talked about lunch. Maybe we can talk about it after lunch Suzanne? Or how about after these young women kill each other, would after their deaths be a good time for you?
The building is cold too, and the sheets she was issued are thin and worthless, so she sleeps on top of them to avoid frantically making her bed before inspection every morning.
“I don’t think it’s a good idea.” Steve says, “We’re doing so good in our little bubble. Aren’t we?”
“Ready for what?” she said,
“Well done, Ms. Sobol.” She said quietly to Toni, “Can anyone explain what Ms. Utkyn did wrong?”
It’s so rudimentary, she doesn’t even have to break into Sasha’s room over April break. Sasha went home, along with almost every other student, but Toni’s never been invited back to her house over break, on the brief chat with Maria, she’s told to keep safe at school over break.
No one ever told her to stop, and she never faltered in her job.
“Hey!” She cried, “Let me go!” They lifted her up and started to move. She couldn’t see much since the sun was right in her eyes, but she could smell freshly cut grass and gasoline. Finally, as she stoped squirming, she could make out a long stretch of road ahead of her, a landing strip she thought to herself.
“You won’t.” She pauses, “Still got a bullet in that pistol?”
She drops the pads, and holds out her hands, “Let’s switch, I’m tired of holding these.”
The girls scattered, only two girls who followed Eva everywhere she went and Klara remained.
For a change, Toni was given the details. They were hired by Manya’s half brother Samuil, who wanted to inherit the fortune instead of her.
She was inches away from hitting record, when a wash of gold light filtered across her hand and the armor. She lifted her hands to her face, before she found the source of the light.
Maria told her a week after it happened, Toni doesn’t know why. Maybe she couldn’t bring herself to do it, maybe she forgot. It doesn’t matter. She didn’t offer much as comfort, just a stiff hug and quiet condolences, but Howard was clear that Toni would not being going to the funeral, and wouldn’t even disclose how she died.
The woman stands up rather quickly, and finally, he has a clear look at her face. Even though it’s a little bloodied, it clicks.
Because this was not the deal. The deal was find Captain America’s body, give him a proper burial, maybe donate his outfit to a museum, be hailed as a hero and recognized for doing something her father never could and ultimately forget about the physical embodiment of her father's expectations that she could never reach.
“I had to. I let myself be controlled when I was a kid in order to survive. But I wasn’t a kid anymore. I forgot my mission, my purpose.”
“Tera, tell me where the nearest rager to my house is.” She phoned her nearby friend, who always seemed to know where free booze was.
She stays awake as long as she can, but even in the awkward position she’s in, she eventually gives in to exhaustion. The van was eerie and uncomfortable, the floor was unfinished and the wall was cold. She was shaken awake by a silent man, and she could feels the creases on her face from leaning against the wall.
“The party isn’t for me,” Toni says, feigning shyness, and Manya chuckles,
It’s one of those nights, when she’s finished the offical project she’d been working on, a styalzied gun with pinpoint acrucy and detector when target is in range, when she begins working on her unnamed robot, but this night was different, because on this night it worked.
“Oh, I think you left your TV on, by the way,” Amanda said turning towards him, before starting down the hall again.
“I punched a girl. In the nose.”
She didn’t dare turn around to the figure behind her, deep down she knew not to ask for help. She could, however, see his shadow from the street lights surrounding them. It was slow and decided, bulky and intimidating. He first walked to the front passenger seat, and tore off the door. She watched in horror as he wrapped his hand around her mother's neck, and slowly tightened his grip before pressing her against the headrest and the back of the chair, raising her by her neck till she stopped squirming and deflated against his hand.
“It didn’t-”
Tania smiled weakly, “This won’t end well.”
“A little lonely is all.” She gestures to the rest of the bar, almost entirely empty, “Not much company.”
“Are you injured? Do you need help?” The woman said, slightly more concerned, she didn’t wait for a response, “Your phone is being tracked help is on the way. Stay on the line, try and talk if you can.”
“Uh huh?”
“Rhodey I had a baby.”
“Well, it’s our name on the side of the building,” Steve countered, “So try not to be so inconsiderate.” She hated when he did that.
“She’s disabling security protocols and dumping all the secrets onto the internet.” Pierce supplies,
“Why didn’t I hear anything about it on the news?”
But their talking from the right side of a two way mirror and the Captain doesn’t know their there, so it’s not that repurposed.
Toni blinks, “Why?”
Petra, Katya, Mila, Nika. Their faces flashed through her head. Not their faces, their corpses. Their blood. It was on her hands. Only fair for the world to punish her. She wishes it would be death instead of this.
The other women snapped at her at first, but everyone soon realized it did no good. The young girl was inconsolable.
But that’s for later.
So she let go of Petra’s shoulder, and moved them up towards her neck. Not much pressure was needed, till she felt the throat close. Petra started choking, and grabbed and scratched at Toni’s hands, so she applied more force to the neck.
“And when you do, I’ll be there to step on your fingers.” She pauses, “Besides, I don’t allow prisoners to escape.”
She turns back to the folders and flips open the first one. A familiar girl’s picture is paper clipped neatly to the front, she knows it’s her. Part of the writing is in Russian, which she seems to understand.
After a few minutes, her mouth was sore, it pulled slightly, closing. He yelped and slapped her across the face, grabbing her jaw again, harder this time, he screamed, “Open you slut!” Another slap and he began again, harder this time, till the tears slid down her neck.
Klara steeled herself a moment, before answering, “한 남자가 친구에게 돈을주고 아내를 얻는다.” Surprising articulate, Toni thought to herself, “A man gives money to a friend to get a wife.” wasn’t the most detailed response, but she doubted she could do much better herself.
As she stood up, she grabbed a link in Koila’s handcuff chain, dragging her up too. The guards took one look at her and waved them both out of the cell.
“I plan on keeping it that way.” She grips the underside of the bar, and whips out a small silver pistol, “You should’ve stayed dead.”
“Everyday. I loved her, I loved Francesa like I love Jarvis. I never told anyone but Maria knows, she was there.”
“Don’t you even fucking shut up?” Antoinette said, not quietly at all, inciting a gasp from the surrounding kids, shocking Holly and her friend into silence, but not for long, “Listen you little-” Holly started, and Antoinette, without realizing it and later regretting it deeply, because it wasn’t a good choice and is never the answer, punched Holly right in the nose.
The doctor pauses, “We had to remove her to operate on you. There was extensive damage, I’m afraid the car crash ruptured part of the uterus, we only would’ve been able to save her if you had no injuries, but that wasn’t the case.”
Toni held her breath, waiting for him to decline. Why would he want to meet her anyways, what could she possibly do.
And finally she was rushed to the hospital two weeks early, and Toni’s pretty sure she pushed herself into labor out of sheer force of will.
The sun has risen more since she got on the chopper, and the sights are beautiful. She can’t focus on them too long, as her mind is racing.
The man looks at her a moment, “You ask too many questions.”
Tania nodded, “I was on a street corner, begging. Told me she’d give me a meal and a bed for the night and I woke up just outside the mansion.”
Toni exhaled, “Nika wouldn’t lie.”
“No it’s for Banner.”
Zma smiled, “Vasilla?” She said, and Lara nodded, “Espionage and combat are nothing without grace. The only thing more graceful than a ballerina is a wild dove.”
Date: October 7th, 2014
Toni is a missing kid, even if everyone thinks she’s dead, and a lot of other candidates were missing children.
She shouldn’t have told her that, but Toni had always been a proud little girl, Madame must’ve seen it in her.
Steve glances around, the soldier- Bucky is long gone. When the agents surrounded them, he didn’t even notice him slip away.
She killed people, little girls, so that they wouldn’t kill her. How much better was she than the soldier after all. Maybe he’d had a metaphorical gun to his head the entire time too.
Toni’s working theory is that she just breathes between glares. She was right though, all twelve dresses hung up in front of her were of the same color, similar fabrics, and basic cuts, she just couldn’t decided. What a problem to have, deciding which fancy dress to wear to a fancy party Toni doesn’t even fancy being at.
Toni swallowed hard, Natasha piped in, “It’s done Toni, it’s all out there. Steve’s almost got the helicarrier down, we have to go.”
“Don’t ask any questions, and don’t speak English. We don’t want to attract attention girl.”
-The target in chapter 5 was a person involved in the very small Ukrainian campaign in the early 2000s. I didn’t know much about the events so I borrowed a name from a much smaller figure rather than a key player. The story greatly exaggerates the events and involves Russia, while there is no evidence that Russia was involved. It’s more than someone on another side rented their highly trained agents to spy rather than the government actually getting involved though.
“Bye Peter,” Wade said with a lovey-dovey tone as he blew a kiss in Peter’s direction.
“It’s going to be okay, Peter. Your dads have fought aliens from outer space and won. Missions like that don’t happen often. I don’t think you will have to worry about them dying for a long time. And you don’t have to worry about going back to foster care. Everything will be okay. I promise.”
“Good. I assume you want to be alone now, right?” Steve chuckled as Peter nodded.
“That’s what friends are for.”
‘He’s gotta drop this charade soon. No way someone like him is actually interested in me,” Peter thought with certainty.
“What do I need a phone for anyway?” Peter butt-in, “It's not like I have friends to text, and you already gave me a computer.”
He apologized for freaking out and then sat down across from the couple.
“See ya later, Bucky. I’ll miss you.”
“Friday, where are Sam and Bucky?”
“One last thing though,” Alex turned to Steve and Tony, “I suggest you get Peter set up with a therapist. He used to see one when he was younger, but he hasn't been able to for a while, and think it would be good for him.”
Tony cracked one eyes open to check the time. It was barely 7 am.
They both nodded. “Bye Peter,” he finally said before handing Steve Peter’s bag and waving goodbye.
“I think Peter was the best option for us,” Steve agreed.
Peter was glad that went over smoothly and handed over his schedule. Once Wade began walking, Peter started following him around like a lost puppy. Their first stop was at his locker.
“Wait, what?” Tony blurted out. He wasn’t expecting to have that information just dropped on him, especially from Peter and not Steve himself.
He gave himself a minute to calm his nerves before leaving the car, walking up to the front door, and knocking on it.
He headed over to the windows (Which was basically a wall of glass. Peter thought it was kinda stupid. Isn't your home supposed private?). He could see the entire city through them. It made him feel small, but watching the tiny lights on cars dart along the streets did help calm him.
He silently snuck back into his room and laid down on his bed. He glanced at the clock sitting on his night stand.
All the people he ever loved in his life died, and Peter was convinced it was all his fault. He was dangerous to be around. He only brought death and suffering. He ran away from Gwen’s house. He couldn’t bare being in there any longer. He ran all the way home. Later the police showed up to talk to him. They all had sad looks on their faces because they knew this was the third time he was part of a murder case.
“Hey,” Carol interjected, “How about you two catch me up on everything that’s happened since I’ve been gone. I know I’ve missed quite a bit.”
Peter hesitantly agreed. He knew he'd never want to leave once he got there, but he agreed because it would make them happy, and he still had that tiny piece of hope inside him.
He quickly hopped out of his bed and ran to the kitchen, phone in hand. May gave him a quizzical look when she saw he was still in his Spider-Man suit, but Peter just shoved the phone into her hand.
“It was kinda an accident. He was over when you dropped me off. I don’t think Dad wanted me to meet him yet because he seemed pretty embarrassed, but his boyfriend actually seems cool.”
“Yeah, he’s over the moon right now.” Tony chuckled.
Peter excitedly jumped up. “Hell yes!”
Despite the lack of people approaching Peter throughout the morning, he still felt kind of miserable and he didn’t quite know why, but he actually noticed himself feeling somewhat happy when Wade joined him for lunch.
Getting through first period was the easiest part of Peter’s school day because he had MJ to back him up. He knew his day would get worse when he wasn’t with her.
MJ looked genuinely ashamed and upset. Peter was surprised to see her like that. It was a new side to her, but he was also very glad to find out it was all a joke. He was terrified something bad would come of the text, but knowing it was just friend made the whole situation better.
“Oh my god,” Peter gasped, “That is so cool!” He could feel himself started to geek out.
“Maybe once you leave.”
He laid down on bed once everything was in its new home. He stared at the ceiling and thought of Gwen. His life was great, but it would never be perfect if she wasn't in it. He wished he could've saved her.
“Peter, we really want to adopt you. Please consider it,” Steve sounded like he would start begging soon.
They tried to start conversations with him, but Peter was trying to say as little as possible. He didn't want them to become more attached than they already seem to be.
Eventually they arrived at the Avengers Tower. He stared in amazement at the building. It looked so much more impressive up close.
Peter stood up and took a deep breath, then he walked down the hall to Alex’s office door. He placed his hand on the doorknob and hesitated.
“I know you and my dad are pretty close. How do you handle him going away on dangerous missions?”
Peter glanced at her for a minute, but she just continued to read.
His dream felt very similar to an early memory he had. He didn't know why he was having dreams of his parents all of a sudden. Sure, he thought about them sometimes, but he didn't dream about them. Was the dream supposed to mean something?
Alex’s face lit up. “I think I know the perfect kid. His name’s Peter, you’ll love him. Why don't you two come back tomorrow to meet him?”
“That? It’s a project Tony and I have been working on for a bit.” He started walking over to it. Peter followed. “It’s a machine that can detect potential enhanced or ‘super’ people.”
“I know. I just hope this all works out.”
“Well, I can’t deny that, but I suppose I should finally talk to your dad again, and meet ‘Bucky’. Gotta make sure a serial killer isn’t hanging around my kid.”
“Damn… I guess you're just mortal,” Clint said, pretending to be surprised.
Peter gave him a confused look, but answered the question anyway. “No. You seem fine.”
“What are you, in middle school?” Natasha asked him.
“I don’t know, they never tell me when May is behind me. That’s how she found out. I don’t think they work on like family and friends.”
“You can only sit if Peter approves.”
Tony followed Steve around the small house until they met up with Peter them.
After dinner, the other Avengers joined them for a movie night. Peter felt nervous because he was surrounded by so many strong and amazing people. He felt small and insignificant.
He didn't have the energy to disagree with Steve. He just continued to cry. He missed his family and Gwen. Steve and Tony still held him as he cried. He was still amazed that they hadn't left yet. This was his third breakdown today.
“Are you and Natasha dating?” The question had been lingering in the back of his head after seeing Natasha sit down on Clint’s lap.
Peter sighed. “I don’t want to be alone. I don’t want to feel like this all the time.”
He got no response, just a sad smile.
“What do you want?”
“Well that's no fun,” Steve said.
Peter joined his fathers for dinner later. Steve was cooking on the stove and Tony sat on the counter beside him. Tony seemed particularly excited to see him. He hopped off the counter and called Peter over as soon as he walked into the kitchen.
Peter woke up a few hours later to the smell of food. He wandered over to the kitchen where he saw Steve cooking and Tony was sitting on the counter, playing with a tablet.
Steve smirked, “Alright, let me know then.”
Peter’s eyes drifted to the floor as he responded. “I don’t know. I guess not a lot of people like you pay attention to me, let alone be this nice to me.”
Tony’s heart couldn’t help but skip a beat. It was the first time he had seen Steve in person since the divorce, and suddenly all of his lingering feelings were brought right back up to the surface. Tony wondered if Steve was feeling the same.
As expected, a few seconds later Steve answered the door. Neither of them were prepared for the moment they would finally be face to face again.
4 people greeted Peter once he entered the house. There was a mom, a dad, and two other boys, they both seemed shy. Peter tried his best to be polite despite the fact he didn’t like people, well except for Gwen. Alex made sure he was settled in and then left. Things took a big turn once he left. His foster father yelled at him to come to the kitchen. He walked in and sat down on the chair across from him.
“Fourteen.”
Peter had few memories of his parents and his life before their death, but they were all good memories. He remembered a big house, lots of toys, and loving parents, who were scientists. His favorite memories of parents were when they brought him to their lab. He didn’t remember what his parents were working on, he could only remember crawling around, playing with toys, and one memory with a spider.
Howard nodded, and they gathered the papers, and the group started upstairs, Toni started to walk with them when Howard turned around, “It’s still guys night Antoinette. We’re just going to fix all the bugs in that gun and play poker, it’d just bore you.”
“I don’t think that’s-”
“You?” She paused, squinting, “Like me?” She almost wants to ask if he like likes her but she’s not ready to revert to full playground mode.
“I know this place.” Toni shoots up, holding the document, “It’s a private building owned by a couple of dozen shell corporations, to hide the fact it’s operated by SHIELD, or should I say HYDRA.”
But the didn’t find out, not at first, they talked to her and they hardly bitched about Lucette or her, so she often engaged in conversation and for the first time she had friends. Sasha is her favorite, because she doesn’t filter herself and she doesn’t try hard. The often sit in Toni’s room because she has no roommate.
“With the gun, before I disarmed him.” She points to her hip, bleeding profusely and he bends down to hold pressure, they need help. But it’s too quiet all of a sudden.
“What do you mean?” Eva said the wind must’ve been knocked out of her since her voice sounded so hoarse.
Toni flinched, “I’ve made mistakes. We all have. I’m doing my best to right wrongs, there’s no shame in that.”
They both get up slowly, but it seems Eva has retreated. The rules have been broken, and they both know Eva won’t end the game if one of them is killed. She’ll go on till she thinks she’s won.
“Be quiet.” One of the two guards sitting in the van says, their voice is almost robotic.
The agent doesn’t seem to care, “I’m sure you didn’t.”
“Ronnie. Ronnie Richards.”
Their faces were stoic, judgmental, and all around prudish. She made a point of avoiding the last month or so of her life, steering clear of partying, to avoid a fight. But that’s where Howard wanted to go, and Howard didn’t like not getting his way.
“To kill him?”
Walking down the hallway Toni kept her face neutral. It was a difficult task, between the raging voice in her head, and the whispering voices around her. It wasn’t a quiet whisper either, she could make out exactly what they were saying,
She put up with the low level agents telling her she couldn’t be there for about two minutes before she realized they didn’t even know why she was there. “I need to see Agent Coulson, or someone who knows what the fuck is going on.”
“Well, it’s kind of his business. And maybe mine.”
She realized her mistake the moment the words left her mouth, but Madame’s lips curled in the way they always did when she thought something was funny, “Oh darling, you haven’t even started.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I was born in New York.” she pauses at Tania’s widening eyes, “And my name isn’t Antonia Sobol. It’s Antoinette Stark.”
The grinned, and Barton took another apple from her basket of apples.
The bell rung, saving Annie from having to answer anymore questions, and they seemed to move on after that with some swaying from the girl in the back who seemed to hate Annie for some reason.
Natasha paused, but Toni continued. “I met you on a mission, my first mission.”
-December 9th the second Friday of December is lost and found, and I thought I’d use a slightly more funny/happy date after the last chapter. Toni is found by a lot of people, many of whom also thought she was lost.
She arrived in the morning, classes in session, a few drifters scrambled through the hall, none looked at her.
Girls she didn’t recognize, from nearly her own age, to ten years old were hurling insults and accusations as she made the short walk to her bed. They only let up when she let herself flop on the rickety piece of furniture.
The girl, Tania she thinks, kicked the back of her chair, “Wow, that really hurt. I’m shaking.”
“I told my nanny she was a slut.”
“Well actually-” Obidiah turned to the makeshift shooting range where Toni tested it out earlier, and it shot perfectly, silences and accurate.
She hadn’t even started to show yet. Just under 4 months, the pregnancy books she bought said she’d start showing any day now.
Steve found her in the desert covered in blood (not hers) and surrounded by scraps of metal (very much hers). She felt bad, he’d had to take more than a month off of his search for Barnes, because she got herself kidnapped.
“To be a father!”
“Fine but if you miss, you have to stop bothering us forever!”
She met Lucie on the walk to school everyday. It was a nice tradition they started in private school together as a survival tactic, now turned cutesy relationship thing.
“I’m literally deform, don’t make me show you.” She was ready to unbutton her shirt when she got a ping on her stark phone. It read, “Urgent: South Alaska-Antarctic search squad found something early this morning. Looks promising. What next?”
She entered without a hitch, no one batted an eye at a young girl in uniform. She slipped on an empty elevator and rose to floor thirteen, room ninety four. The key card she’d been given opened the door, so she slipped inside and shut it quickly.
“And what would that make me?” Madame said, almost gleefully,
“It’s Antoinette, Sin!” the other giggled, “Sorry. We’re a little tipsy.” She whispered the last part as if it was a secret.
“No, I’m infiltrating the meeting and exposing HYDRA within SHIELD, Steve is going to disable the help carriers and everything.” She pauses a moment, “And try to neutralize the soldier.”
Toni’s face falls, she’d been procrastinating, dropping even detail she could remember to put off Tania’s death.
She was leaving the Red Room. She was going outside, for the first time in years. And if she had anything to say about it, she wasn't going to come back.
Katya scoffs, “We all know what you did to Nika.”
“Doctor, blood’s back, she’s not drunk or high, but she’s pregnant.” she could hear a far away voice say, then a door slammed shut. The person closest to her curses under his breath.
Her voice was alone in the night, and the air was so thick her words felt stifled. She was about to continue her calling when she heard a loud footstep, from outside the wrecked car.
“You. Must. Be. Antonia.” The taller of the two said
“Nope.”
Toni doesn’t get off the ground for ten minutes after the last shot though, Tania lies near her a few feet back, but they’re both silent.
Time: 2300
“Let’s not bother her right now, it’s pretty out, let’s go outside.” Francesca held her hand out to Antoinette and she stared at it for a moment, before taking it and walking to the back of the house with her.
Sasha turned towards Toni, making the connection, “Figures they’d pair the rich snobs together.”
Kozlov begins to ask another question, when Madame strides towards her, “That is quite enough Kozlov.”
“Oh my god. But you used protection right?”
“There’s no way you could keep a lower profile Brynn. You haven’t done anything tabloid worthy in years.”
“What the-” she started, across from her sat two men in suits, giving her a severe look that said, go ahead. Try and run, give us an excuse to shoot you.
They’d died so Toni could live.
“No.” Toni says, “That’s the last ditch plan.”
Maybe she hadn’t done such a great job of concealing her skin as she thought she had.
She tried not to imagine exactly what she’d do to the rude men if she could. In between her fantastical beat downs, she could see Mila in the hallway, bleeding out. Eva was screaming at her and her ears felt like they were going to explode but she couldn’t get away. She could see a rifle in her arm, pointed at Mila and warm as if she’d just fired.
RIP Tania. Had a lot of conflict over this one. The scene where she dies was one of the first scenes I imagined so I've been working up to this for a while. I wish I hadn't named her Tania because it's so close to Toni, so sorry if I confused you guys, I confused my beta reader with that.
“No. Maybe your dad is, but you are not. You’re made of diamond, tough but beautiful rare but dangerous. A promise, you’re a promise but you decided what that promise is.”
For a moment she cringed, what a thing to say. What a stupid shitty thing to say.
Toni scoffs, “You might as well have.”
“She’s weak.” Madame says, “The punishment for weakness is death. Only then can the strong rise.”
“So you punched her?”
She takes a break, only a few minutes, till she clears the perimeter of the classroom and starts running laps. Thrifty, sixty, ninety, till she collapses on a desk
“Ok Toni. Come to my room, my roommate Vanessa’s parents just left and she has a killer radio.”
Tania looked at her the same way she had for years. With disgust and hatred. “Well I hate killers.” She stood up and walked away
For a split second he wondered if he had left something on, but just to be safe he opened the door slowly, not letting it creak.
“Really?” Steve said, “You’re letting this stupid argument get in the way?”
And then she could escape.
“Well, getting into a room with Alexander Pierce isn’t a bad start.” Natasha says turning on her heel, “I don’t know if you’re ready to go with Steve, but I wouldn’t mind a little backup.”
It’s tricky business, poisoning someone.
She ducked as Tania surged, her, throwing her body at her legs and knocking her off balance for just a moment. But it was enough.
“You know it’s different. He was with them for decades, just shy of a century. You need to be angry at the ones pulling the strings.”
She handed out the leotards, and Toni worried hers would be too small, as she remembers no measurements being taken, and she wouldn’t fit into the same one as Klara.
“You did it?” Toni said,
Suddenly her eyes land on the only table not crowded with metal tools, on it lies a few yellow folders, stuffed with papers. She picks up the one on top and considers opening it, before she places it neatly back on the stack.
“This is just the prototype, the next model will have more feautes, better automation and-”
So she started prenatal care, and planned. Most teenage girls who fall pregnant are overwhelmed, but Toni squashed her feelings and figured out how to do this with no one ever finding out. She first made Tera and her doctor sign non-disclosure agreements, then her lawyer, then she pushed back her summer vacation to Italy a few months so that she’d leave around five months, when she started showing. Nobody in Italy really knew her and if she kept her head down, she could certainly avoid the press. Maria and Howard said nothing about her plan changes, not suspecting anything. And suddenly Toni was alone, but not alone because her baby kept her silent company.
Natasha’s eyes widened in recognition, but her brow furrowed, “No. That was Antonia Sobol. I looked her up after that mission. I kept my eye on her. She was Lucifer. She died on a mission three years later.”
“Stark’s no better. You know that shit she said about that reporter, he got fired! He was just doing his job, not his fault she couldn’t take a joke.”
Toni shrugs and follows her out, “When do we leave?”
Toni finally let her fear and shock show on her face, “What? But there were twelve of us? You can’t kill eleven innocent girls!”
Quickly Francesa scribbles in another figure by the house, Antoinette returns to her own drawing and notices Francesa shades the house to look dark and scary before asking, “What are you drawing Antoinette?”
Madame looked at her curiously for a moment, when she first came in, then she began yelling.
-Sept 10th national suicide day chapter 5
A small circle of blood mixed with dirt is growing around her torso, Toni ducks to her side, “Tania! Tania are you ok?”
Toni adjusts the grip on her gun slightly, but he notices, “Bingo. I haven’t seen one of you before, besides Ms. Romanov of course. They usually keep you on a tight leash. Can’t remember any runaways in the last twenty years.”
Nika looked so sad though, Toni almost wanted to let her win so she’d perk up a bit. It was depressing to watch her go through the motions.
Toni turned away, just for a second, even though she knew better. And Shvets used the opening to sweep her legs out from under her, she fell to the ground but kept a grip on her pistol.
“I didn’t mean that. I don’t remember.”
“Oh honey. So are we.”
“In the pursuit of the strongest, I can. The trauma makes you ruthless, precise, and untouchable. Only once you’ve gone through purgatory, can you see heaven.”
“Reed Richards son? I hated that kid.” She’d met him a few times at their parents work meetings, “Well, he better have some good booze.”
“Who are you?” Toni said, “They said another agent would be my expo.”
But she doesn’t catch the end of their conversation, when the agent leads him out of the room.
“That I was American.” Nika exhales sharply, “My parents were assassinated. I remember that a little. I can see a man choking my mother to death, but that’s all. And they said I was a genius, my IQ was 146. That’s why they placed me ahead of my age, I think.”
“No he wasn’t, he doesn’t drive much anymore.”
“Remember how you said I could go back to school soon?”
And just like that, Party Toni was loose again, this time with a vengeance. She didn’t think about a goddamn thing.
“Both. Neither.” She grinned, “By the way, isn’t this my kitchen? And don’t both you have, your own?”
She watched him silently from the bathroom as he stumbled through the room, almost tripping on boxes and towels on the ground. He made his way to the bed, and just like she’d predicted he looked about ready to flop down and sleep.
“I don’t remember.” Antonia replied
It was the equivalent of her parents telling her they weren’t angry, just disappointed. She looked over at the other Avengers, minus Thor, who usually dropped in, literally, every other week for a fight and some lunch and then went back to his galactic ass kicking.
She almost doesn’t catch her slip out the backdoor when new guests arrive, and it takes a moment to detangle herself from the crowd to follow her.
Eva probably hears the gunshot.
She pushes up and over the wall and both the soldier and Steve watch silently for a second. Her feet are planted on the highway and she sighs, “Really? A highway? Could you be more overdramatic?”
“Hey.” She starts preparing cheerios, trying not to notice how fucking ripped he is. Does he still have to work out? Or does the serum just keep him completly jacked?
“I know, but we don’t have time. He’ll go to jail, he’ll get what’s coming to him.”
She’s done being led.
Annie gulped, the other girls were looking at her, none jumped to her defense, “Well, my dad was friends with one of the nominee’s I think-”
She wished she was an airhead, who couldn’t tell calculus from quantum physics, because the only thing her ‘gifted mind’ was getting her now was a death sentence.
Target: Ihor Mazur
“You said yesterday that you’d tuck me in.”
“Victim?” Toni said, “It’s half a mug of spilled coffee and some bread crumbs! There isn’t a victim here! This literally does not matter!”
She’s silent the ride home, and it’s a long trip. She only stops crying when she can see the top of the Red Room mansion, and by the time she strides inside the prison, her tears are wiped away and she’s ready to face them again. For now.
Would she be here for years?
“Yes.”
Inside is a little girl, ten years old with freckles brown eyes and hair sitting in a hospital bed.
“I ditched my bong, but my parents meet and greet went south. I’m getting in my car, just give me an address and details.”
“Yeah.”
“Ok fine, what’s your name?”
“It’s just not how I thought tonight would end up going. That’s all.”
It’s been two years since Howard, Maria, and Jarvis died. She’s supposed to speak at their two year anniversary memorial but she can’t think of anything to write about them. The day arrives quickly, she thinks it snuck up. Soon enough she’s lightly holding Rhodey’s hand as she walks up the staircase in a black dress. Surrounded by her parents friends, she doesnt fit in. She’s isn’t glamorous, or classy. Sure she’s pretty, but if she put more time and effort in she could be prettier. Maria almost got her into modeling as a child, but then Howard dated a model, and then model meant slut.
“You’re aunt was part of SHIELD? Is that why you want to kill the soldier so bad, did he kill your aunt?”
“Can’t do what Annie?”
“Good.” Antoinette and Maria blinked in surprise, “Punch anyone who gets in your way, because they’ll sure as hell punch you if you let them.”
She tells him Bucky’s four sister are all still alive, being significantly younger than them but are spread around the globe, only one is still in America and all of them are still fairly elderly.
“It totally did.” She sighed, “I just saw you when you moved in, but haven’t really seen you since, so I figured you were just visiting. I swear I didn’t plan this. I don’t have a shrine in my closet.”
“I'm sorry,” he apologized again.
“Thanks, Ned. I’m just scared that they’re gonna expose me. Tony told me to lay low for the next few days while he tracks down who sent the text.”
“Hello!” a cheerful voice called out in front of him.
Peter let out a small laugh. “No. I’m not very athletic,” he explained.
Oh, and school is pretty weird now. Everyone who was dusted is the same age as when they left, but everyone who wasn’t has aged. I see people from my high school around town occasionally but they’re adults. And now we’re going to school with a bunch of kids we don’t know. It’s really weird, but at least my best friends are still with me.
“Antoinette Stark. You look at me.” She lifted her hands off her face and looked Jarvis in the eyes, he only said her full name when she was in trouble, but he didn’t look angry.
Her grades were optimal, she was first in class, maybe because she wasn’t busy with anything other than studying, or maybe because she was just smart.
“Really? What’d she say?”
“No!” She started yelling again and the men tighten their grip, “Take me back!”
“We’re requesting Agent Coulson right now Ms. Stark, but he’s on official business.”
“So Antoinette-”
She looks at the ground and for nearly a minute is completley silent. “I almost turned around because I saw some random figure in the hall. I can’t see anything, I’m not wearing contacts or glasses. I just didn’t want to have to talk to anyone, nothing to do with you. However I would absoluetly not mind jumping your bones or even having a ‘relationship’ if you so desire, but not right this instant because I am very tired.”
She went home, to the manor, which was quiet. Maria and Howard were in Aspen or Guatemala, vacationing. Rhodey couldn’t take time off the air force whenever Toni was sad, her apparent baby daddy probably didn’t remember their one night stand, her baby was meeting it’s real family right now, and Lucie was dead. The numbness Toni fought for, that ended up getting her pregnant wore off just as she arrived to the hollow mansion, empty of servants or parents or little babies or pretty girls. And Toni sat down in the middle of the hill where she laid with Francesa and she thought about the dark scary mansion she’d drawn and Toni couldn’t help but feel like a scary, hollow, mansion herself.
“I wish you’d had me killed that night!” Toni says, “I wish I had died with them.”
He grimaced, “Cup of coffee?”
They met up silently, for the first time in years, “Whatever it takes.”
So the first fifteen minutes of the party are spent scouting out Lucie, she doesn’t know how she missed this in their emails. She’ll have to be more descriptive next time and they can make plans to meet up.
-October 7th, national revenge day, a Libian holiday. Toni really tries to get revenge this chapter. Very revengish.
“Then what’s your name?” Natasha says stepping back in the room, which unlike the others isn’t empty.
Toni paused, confused and Tania continued, “Ivana didn’t die from an accident. Madame had her killed two days before you got here.”
“Why do you think?” She says back coldly, turning out of the room, Steve follows,
She’s been surrounded by her classmates, girls in other classes, and the Instructors, all of whom are female. Rumors that there’s a male doctor in the infirmary have been spreading for years, but Toni’s made sure to avoid injury.
She hadn’t even opened a bottle, when she heard Rhodey behind her, “Toni. Put it down.”
“Yeah.”
“But then we realized. If given the opportunity, Shvets could potentially kill both Utkyn and Sobol.”
“He promised I could go on his next trip. I was gonna take over the company someday I should know how to run it. But he forgot, so I had to beg and beg, and I joined them last minute. So last minute they didn’t realize there was an extra girl in the car until my parents were dead.”
Toni paused, looking away from the towards the door where Howard disappeared,
But she had a secret safe haven, Lucie and her had traded emails and often talked, quite possibly keeping Toni sane. Lucie was going to public school in New York, and she loved it. No one seemed to care who her parents were and how much money she had there, it’s ironic she faced more bullying for being rich in a private school.
Toni took one look back towards the mats. Maybe she could survive, maybe if she never failed.
“And?”
But even though he and the man had their disagreements, it’s hard to watch him code on the table from behind a window. He can’t imagine what Natasha must be going through.
“Steve is alright, Ms. Stark.”
“Thank you for finding me.”
She shook her head, “Collateral damage. Wrong place, wrong time. I was eight years old.”
“I was just thinking of dear Ursula.” Toni remarks, “Do you think she knew what was happening in her final moments?”
“I gotta go Maia. It was nice meeting you.”
“You knew her for a day.”
“Rich orphans?”
“You’re being hired, sweetheart.” Madame said, leaning on her desk, “Surprisingly, I’m sad to see you go. Can’t say that about many candidates or assets for that matter. Lord knows Romanov was a pain in my-”
“Who are you?” Koila asked,
“Who’s still...”
He’s still in his own head as he knocks out the last of Peirce’s cronies in the elevator, and barely registers the breaking glass around him. He does notice the fall and the impact of the ground. Has the ground gotten harder since he last plummeted to it?
“So you lied to me?” She asks,
Time: 0100
Antonia gets up from the chair and looks around the otherwise deserted room, it seems to go on forever with the only exit right behind Madame.
“I identify with it. Fritz Haber made two world changing inventions using nitrogen. Fertilizer, which ended up saving tons of people from starving, but he also started chemical warfare for the Germans in world war one.”
“Were you there?” Steve says tentatively
“I trust you were successful?”
She did follow Toni down the remaining narrow passage, and out the door, where another dead guard lied, Koila looked at the man only a moment as they walked past them, then at Toni, but made the connection.
Toni didn’t know why she was mad at Lucie, it’s not like she killed herself, and it’s not like this was a shock to anyone else. But it shook Toni to her core, made her reevaluate life, because if it can snuff out a good person, a much better person that To I'll ever be, slowly and painfully letting her suffer like that, then what’s the point?
Kissing Lucie is a lot like knowing Lucie, soft and sweet and pure. Her blonde hair was long but often swept back, her green eyes were striking. Neither deepened the kiss, neither knew how. But they sat there kissing slowly, tenderly for what seemed like a long time.
“What’d who do to who?” Rogers asked, walking towards them
“What?” Mother said
“What type of skills?” Antonia asks
But she realized it was easier to wake up in someone else’s bed than sleep alone.
She could hear the things they said to her face everyday, and worse, she could hear the things they whispered about her behind her back.
“Antoinette Stark, Lucette Steele and like two other heiresses.”
“Well you seemed sincere.”
“Don’t I? I wasn’t a Red Room handler, but I was in contact with them. I was supposed to get a very promising asset from them a few years ago and was ever so disappointed that she died tragically. In the line of duty of course.”
Sasha sat down on her bed, “Right? Those kinda girls just enroll here last minute, meanwhile I’ve been working in a scholarship to go here since first grade!” Sasha motioned for Toni to sit next to her.
It wasn’t long till he couldn’t stand upright, and his handwriting lagged. Next went his speech, and his dart throwing aim.
“Do you think our line of work values sportsmanship?” Madame says, she walks towards Eva slowly, her lips are still smiling but now they’ve gotten thinner. She brushes her finger across Eva’s forehead and runs it through the first strand of hair framing her face, “And what, pray tell, gave you the idea I cared at all about what you think?”
“Tones.” Rhodey said nudging her, she cracked and eye open and the clock read six o’seven. She’d only fallen asleep a few hours ago, why was he waking her up. “Oh my god Tones I’m so sorry.”
“What?” Tania said
“Antoinette. Let’s go.” He seemed to have a special drug in the bathroom that cures hangovers and drunkenness in minutes, but Toni couldn’t even start thinking about that.
Toni’s unfortunately familiar with the hallway she’s being dragged down. At the end of it, sits two thick doors, inside is an open warehouse type room, where she was forced to kill the closest person she had to a friend, and where she lost her memory, and identity.
“You will not touch your bodies while you dance.”
Natasha smiles thinly before handing Toni the gun, “Who’s your friend?”
There were pages and pages to read, and Toni couldn’t very well walk up to Sasha and snatch the pages out of her hand. The teachers did nothing to stop her, quite possibly having no idea what was going on.
“It’s like you were trying to make it difficult for me on purpose.”
She sat, if only out of exhaustion. If this was a test Toni would fail, but as soon at Eva’s head hit the ground she stopped caring about examinations.
Peter really believed what Tony said. If he was adopted, he would have a family again, and the tower was the safest place he could think of. Maybe if he was adopted, he could put his past behind him and just be happy with his dads.
Bruce suggested sci-fi. Tony called him a nerd. Bruce just sighed and decided to let the other picks. Thor suggested something funny, but Clint shot that down.
Peter looked over and saw his new math teacher.
“We can change my name to Peter Parker Rogers-Stark. Parker doesn't really sound like a last name anyway.”
Peter watched as Wade spotted him and he was tempted to crawl under the table to hide, but he knew his fate. Wade excitedly walked over to Peter and immediately sat down beside him. He was preparing to tell Wade to fuck off, when MJ intervened.
“I’m from here, but I just moved recently and switched schools.” He tried to keep it vague because he really didn’t want to get into the whole adoption thing with these 2 guys he just met.
Tony and Steve shared another look.
“This is the very first Stark Phone. And it's all yours! You can do just about anything with it; listen to music, play games, take pictures, text, etc. It even has its own custom AI, RAIN.”
Peter was dropped off and MJ saved him from any other unwanted interaction. By now, Peter was trying to come up with an excuse to go home. He considered just calling his dads, but decided pretending to be sick would work better.
A few months after living with his Aunt and Uncle, Peter started school. He excelled in class, but he didn’t make any friends. After his teacher talked to his Uncle and Aunt about his antisocial behavior, and they decided to take Peter to a psychiatrist. He was diagnosed with depression, and given medicine to help him.
“Ugh. Fine!”
“Good.”
“Okay, well we love you! See you at dinner time!” Steve announced as he placed a kiss on Peter’s cheek.
“You just said it yourself! We don’t know how strong he is!”
Peter sat nervously on the front porch of his foster home. He was waiting for Steve and Tony to come pick him up, and getting lost in his thoughts.
English class was very interesting. The same girl from Peter’s math class sat next to him again, although this time she wasn’t reading, so Peter got a better look at her face.
He wondered if Steve and Tony would force him to get up early or would let him sleep in as long as he pleased. He hoped for the latter.
He got up from the table and started walking down the hallway towards his dads’ room. He paused halfway there, though. He knew Tony wouldn’t be upset if came to talk to him, but Peter just didn’t think he was ready to get that personal yet. His dreams were some of the most personal things about him.
Tony turned around and was a bit surprised to see him, but still smiled. Peter thought he might be upset to see him up so late, but apparently not.
Eventually he heard the elevator door open and Pepper walked in holding a box of pizza. She headed straight for the kitchen.
“I love you 3001, Morgan.”
Peter thought for a moment. Admittedly, he hadn’t really seen much of the Avengers in action. When the New York alien attack happened, he had been in a mental hospital upstate because Alex forced him there after attempting suicide. He saw short clips on the news while he was there, and when he returned to school everyone was talking about the Avengers. Peter didn’t have a phone at the time, so he knew only what others were saying. Despite how little he knew, he looked up to the Avengers after that. Some nights he dreamed of being a superhero too. It all seemed so great, and Peter thought helping others could make him forget about all his suffering. Actually knowing them now didn’t change his opinion much either.
Steve could only shrug in response. “Why don’t we eat?”
Peter quickly got to his seat in the back of the class, but that still didn’t help the situation at all. Everyone kept looking at him and whispering. At this point Peter wanted nothing more than to disappear, but since that was impossible, he instead looked down at his desk, desperately hoping everyone would leave him alone and class would start.
“Oh you know I’m right, Clint. Even Thor agreed with me.”
“What?” Peter asked, deeply confused.
“Shit! Sorry! I didn’t mean to!” Peter quickly apologized, hoping Thor wouldn’t be mad. He didn’t even flinch, though.
“It's not your fault. You didn't kill them. Some messed up people out there did. They are to blame, not you,” Steve tried to comfort him.
Peter sighed. He had to get up and go to school. This was his life now. He couldn’t skip because he didn’t feel like showing up, or go in late because he wanted to sleep in. He had to be a good student now, so he got up and got ready before heading to the kitchen.
“It feels rude not to.”
“He might be difficult to take care of at times, but Peter’s a great kid. He’s smart, he’s kind, and I know once he gets a stable family, he’ll finally be able to let himself be happy and love again.”
“I know. I'm both nervous and excited. Oh god, do you think we're ready to do this?” Tony suddenly began to panic. He knew he wanted to be a dad, but he wasn't sure if he was actually prepared to be one.
“I can be quiet,” Tony flirted.
For how little Peter exercised, he always seemed to be in really good shape, so running was difficult by a long shot, it was just tiring for him. The day had been tiring enough, and running wasn’t going to help anything, but it wasn’t like he could just walk out like he would’ve in the past.
Peter sighed and then rubbed his eyes. Once he reopened them, he noticed the sun beginning to rise. He sat there for most of the night.
Steve kissed his husband before letting him get back to work. He was excited for what would soon happen.
Tony sighed. He wasn’t annoyed with Peter, he was somewhat annoyed with himself now that he actually had to admit the truth out loud.
“I have a confession to make,” she blurted out.
. Please feel free to message me to talk about my stories, ask for a sneak peek, or even make requests for to write! Thanks for reading.
‘Curse my loving and caring parents,’ Peter thought to himself.
When Peter walked into his new school, it was nearly empty due to the fact he had to show up early to talk to the principal and get a tour of the school. Peter walked quietly down the hallway, glancing around at his new school. It was cleaner and looked nicer than most public schools he’s been to. He was nervous to be there, though. It was permanent this time.
“Whatever,” Peter commented, annoyance prevalent in his voice.
“So, why are we under the bleachers?”
He looked over at Alex like he was asking for permission.
“What do you think Peter’s done today?” Steve asked Tony while they rode up their floor.
Peter jumped out of his seat, surprising both Steve as Tony.
“Alright, Peter, it's time to talk about school,” Tony warned him.
“Oh sweet! Your locker is near mine. Hopefully that means I’ll be able to see more of your beautiful face,” he commented with a cheesy smile and a wink.
“What happens if i’m not?” He was curious.
“I don’t know. This is all kinda crazy.”
Tony smiled and handed the tablet to Peter so he could look at the suit more. He watched the teen fawn over his suit until Steve finished cooking.
Steve chuckled. “Now he sounds like a real teenager.”
“Someone had a good day,” Steve commented with a teasing tone and set a plate down in front of Peter.
Alex cut him off, “You know that’s not what I meant. Many couples want younger children rather than teenagers.”
He didn’t want to discourage his son from seeking help, especially since he was just a child who experienced so much more trauma than anyone ever should.
MJ nodded, but Peter could tell she wasn’t exactly satisfied with his answer. She seemed to love to collect information, but that was all Peter was willing to give at this point. He had only known her for two whole days after all, and he wasn’t quite sure if he even considered her a friend at this point.
“I do it to protect you, Tony. It's not fun watching you get hurt.”
“That’s not fair. If I have to be up, then he should be up, too,” Peter argued childishly.
“I was just wondering because you don’t seem to want to talk to me, or Miles. You seem to like MJ and Wade better.”
“Let’s go for a walk together,” she suggested.
“Alright, let's go tell the others, Cap.”
“Yes, May!” he shouted back.
Peter was hesitant. “What game?”
It wasn't a big deal though. He was already a Rogers-Stark.
“Yeah. So what?”
“Can you tell me about Asgard?”
He groaned internally and tossed his phone towards the end of his bed. He always got in his own head and he had no clue why. Life was good for once and he should just be enjoying it, yet here he was, trying to figure out how it was going to get ruined.
The door opened and Alex walked in. He was ready leave, but that wasn't happening. He was shocked when Alex told him that they still wanted to meet him.
Bucky sighed in defeat. “No, alright. I just really need your help. I don’t want Steve to be mad at me.”
The longer he waited, the more he doubted himself. He wondered if they changed their minds and he was waiting for something that was never going to happen. He tried to remind himself stuff like this takes a while, but his life was already full of so much disappointment he couldn’t be sure.
“I’m sorry,” he immediately apologized.
“Can I be the first test subject?”
“The hell do you want, man?”
Tony was glad something good could come out of his horrible past. If he could take his past experiences and use them to help his son, he would happily do so.
Peter wondered if they would keep trying to be his friends in the future.
“I have a surprise!” She could barely contain her excitement.
“It's okay if you don't want it changed, too,” Steve reassured him.
“Weird,” Tony whispered to himself. He checked the living room only to find Clint napping on Natasha’s lap. Tony was only 50% sure Natasha was also napping, but he didn’t want to find out. He headed towards the kitchen where Steve was.
Tony gave him a small, awkward smile before slipping past him and into his house. He took a moment to look around the place since he had never seen it before.
Tony shrugged, “Fancy steroids?”
Peter tried to hide his laugh. Natasha walked back with popcorn.
They were still confused, but they sat down to read the file. They were shocked to say the least.
Eventually, Peter sank to the floor. He sat and watched the city.
He walked to his room and started packing his things. Alex walked in about a minute later.
Steve and Tony both got up and hugged him. Peter usually didn't like unwanted hugs, but this time they actually felt somewhat comforting.
“Peter,” Tony replied sternly.
“I have so much to tell you!”
“Okay, breakfast is ready. Put the tablet away Tony,” Steve commanded while he set down plates of food on the table.
Tony whined when suddenly his heat source slipped out of his arms.
By the time he turned 15, Peter nearly died from alcohol poisoning twice, and tried to kill himself 7 times. When he couldn’t get alcohol, Peter became extremely depressed, he couldn’t bare thinking about all the death he caused so he tried to permanently end his suffering. Of course since the universe hated him, he survived every attempt.
Sam rolled his eyes. “You idiot. I don’t know a damn thing you could do to make Steve mad at you.”
“Well, are you ready to officially move in?” Tony asked and shuffled excitedly.
That didn’t stop the two friends from attempting to whisper questions at him from time to time throughout the entire period. Peter didn’t say anything in response, though. He didn’t want to.
Clint smiled mischievously. “Thor! Grab your hammer. Peter, I dare you to pick it up.”
Natasha turned back to Peter and quirked her eyebrow, silently restating Clint’s original question. Peter wondered how this debate even started in the first place.
“He doesn’t even know sign language,” Natasha argued.
“Oh, I know I dramatic,” he countered, “but I’m also right. Don’t think I don’t know that you’ve rebuilt my old suit already.”
“Well, we’re still building it. And we need a database of known enhanced people to help it tell the difference.”
“Well, if you aren’t safe at school, then we’d have to look into other schooling options like private school or homeschooling.”
“Wait, Peter’s here,” Clint exclaimed and ran over to the couch, jumping on it. “We need your opinion.”
“Aunt May? Uncle Ben?” he called out for them. He didn’t get a response.
“You know what, I will. We’ll go together.”
“Oh, I’m sorry, Pete,” Tony replied softly, “We probably should’ve texted you or something before we headed out.”
“Coming!” she called back.
After the movie, Peter talked to the other Avengers. He told them a little about himself. He was still a bit nervous so he didn't tell them much. They seemed to notice his nervousness and they broke off into their own conversations.
He lead Peter down to his workshop. He had been recently working on a new Iron Man suit and he figured that Peter would be interested in helping him or watching him work on it.
Peter cried for a bit longer. He eventually broke away from his Aunt’s arms and silently walked up to his bedroom. They gathered his things and took a few of his parents’ things. They managed to make it home without another breakdown from Peter.
“Technically, she's agender, but I guess you could say she's a girl. It doesn't matter, though. She's an AI,” he replied pointedly to his husband.
“Yeah, yeah. Let’s go. I heard that Steve is leaving for a mission in a few hours.”
“That’s stupid. Everyone needs friends.”
“Why? Why are they gone? I want them back! Aunt May, bring them back!” he screamed.
“Tony, I said no.”
Peter sighed in frustration. High school was hard enough, but all of people bothering him about his family made it infinitely harder, and he didn’t know what to do at this point. He just wanted to be left alone and have a normal life, but deep down he knew it would never be normal; it would never be like it was before.
“I know. Tell Pepper I love her for me.”
“Yes, and Peter, this is Thor,” Steve said while Thor walked over to greet him.
The couple exchanged a look.
“What’s going on?” Steve questioned Alex.
“Michelle, I’m just trying to hang with my new boo, Peter.”
“Please Jarvis? I’m sure he wouldn’t care.”
“Maybe,” he awkwardly commented.
Peter wasn’t really into social media, so he really had no idea how big the news of his adoption was. Maybe no one cared, he knew he probably wouldn’t, but considering the fact that the Avengers were celebrities, people probably cared too much.
Peter sighed. “I’m not really looking for any friends right now.”
“You'd be safer at a private school. They'd keep your identity a secret and you could be a normal kid,” Tony explained, trying to convince Peter that's what was best for him.
Peter angrily sighed to himself and rolled onto his side. He decided to sleep to pass the time, and to ignore his thoughts.
“What’s that?” She cocked her head as she pointed at Peter’s wrist.
Peter sat in stunned silence for a minute. He hadn’t expected all of that. He also hadn’t expected such anger to come from MJ. She was normally a really chill person.
Peter suddenly sensed he wasn’t alone. He turned around and saw Bruce walking into the lab.
It sounded like a better idea than Peter could come up with.
“Nice to meet you, Peter!” Thor shook his hand before headed back over to the couch.
“Well, we’re glad you have our last name.” Steve smiled down at him. Peter smiled back. It felt permanent now, like there’s no going back. He’s officially a Rogers-Stark.
“Whatever. I still need help finding it. Can you please help me?” Bucky pleaded.
Someone wanted him. Even though he thought he was worthless, someone wanted him. It took him a few minutes to process this.
“Disney movies are fun, at least the ones I've seen,” Thor responded.
Tony felt conflicted. It had been about 3 years after his and Steve’s divorce, so he wasn’t that shocked to hear that Steve had started dating again, but he figured they would discuss introducing new partners to Peter beforehand when it came time to do so. He knew he couldn’t actually be mad, though, because it was an accident, and Peter was a teen who was obviously handling it well.
Peter sat anxiously alone on the couch for a while. He turned the tv on just for some background noise, but was too nervous to actually pay attention. He was just waiting for some mystery person to come keep him company, which normally he wouldn’t be happy about, but today he really needed it.
After that they made their way back to class very slowly since neither were very interested in working on classwork.
“Nice,” Wade replied casually, “Good to meet you. Let me see your schedule, so we can start the tour.”
The lab was empty when he entered. He asked Jarvis for a mini tour so he would know where everything was, but just as Peter was about to start fooling around with some chemicals, he noticed something in the corner Jarvis didn’t point out.
“Okay. Do you have a specific age you want?”
“People like me?”
“Are you serious?” he asked, more shocked than he’d ever been in his life.
Alex came up behind Peter and put his hand on Peter’s shoulder. He jumped, not expecting to be touched.
Peter shrugged. “It was fine I guess. Just a normal school day.”
“Okay. I guess I can go during lunch.”
“I think your chance is close to 0%.” Peter hoped that would shut down the situation.
“Tony…” Steve whispered.
“I just feel a bit intimidated…”
“We’re not children, Steve. We don’t need a robot babysitting us while you’re gone,” Bucky argued.
Steve and Tony both gave him a sympathetic look.
Then he opened the door, and changed his life.
Sam stood up from his seat. He was just about ready to fight Bucky right then and there, and they both knew it.
“Why did you move?” Miles asked curiously.
Peter felt something in their embrace he hadn’t felt in a long time. He felt loved. It reminded him of distant memories of his parents holding him and kissing him before putting him to bed, and how his aunt and uncle started doing that too after his parents’ death. He became overwhelmed with emotions, mostly good ones, in fact, he couldn’t even remember the last time he felt this happy.
MJ was unusually quiet and looked a little nervous. Peter picked up on it and gave her a curious glance.
Peter was surprised that after reading his file and experiencing Peter mid-anxiety attack, they still seemed eager to meet him. That tiny shred of hope he had grew. That was dangerous for Peter, but he couldn't help it.
Peter didn’t talk to Wade for the rest of the tour. That didn’t seem to bother him, though. He had a joyful smile on his face as he kept up their conversation himself.
“Not me.” Peter was beginning to feel frustrated yet again.
And now the couple was alone.
“Well, will you be my friend, Peter Parker?” She gave him a hopeful smile.
“Well, I don’t really want to talk about my parents, or the rest of the Avengers.”
Steve rolled his eyes, but he still smiled. Peter felt relieved.
“Yeah, except I can’t find my shield.”
‘Me too,’ Peter silently wished.
“Yeah,” Tony replied with a huge grin. “I guess we’re good dads then.”
“Yes,” he begrudgingly admitted.
“Come on, Pete. You know you have to go to school.”
When they got there, Peter explained the situation to the principal who was also very sympathetic. He decided he would make an announcement right away making sure students would know that they’d receive detention if they continued to mob him. Peter wasn’t sure how effective that would be, but it was better than nothing, and he was grateful for any help.
“Is it true? Are your dads Captain America and Iron Man?” one of them asked.
It's been forever people! Sorry for not posting anything for so long. I promise that I won't disappear for like 7 months again. Anyway, enjoy the chapter and there's some important notes at the end.
“I don't know,” he weakly replied and looked down at the table in front of the two of them.
“Oh yeah.” Tony remembered and turned towards his son. “Well, as you know, your legal name is Peter Parker, and since you're a part of our family now, we were curious if you wanted to change your last name to match ours.”
“Sure. That sounds great. Thank you,” Steve said with a voice Tony knew was hiding most of his excitement.
Pepper seemed to sense what was going on. She placed her hand on Peter’s shoulder and gently lifted his head so he looked her in the eyes.
Peter just pulled out his phone and showed them both the conversation with the unknown number.
“If you want to spend a night there, then I'm not against it. Anything to convince you.”

“Yeah. I moved here over the summer. I’ve had trouble making friends so far,” she said the last part quietly.
“Nice of you to join us,” Steve teased as Peter entered the kitchen.
“You know you don't have to worry about being greedy. We can get you pretty much anything you'd need, or want,” Steve reassured him after he hesitated to speak.
‘I doubt that,’ thought angrily.
“Do they always fight this much?” Peter whispered to Steve.
Peter dreaded answering his questions. He just wanted to work on the assignment. He thought Miles and Ned were both nice people, but he wasn’t interested in making friend while they clearly were. He still wanted to be nice, though, so he did answer Ned’s questions.
“Now get off the ground, go in there, and give yourself a chance to be happy.”
“Peter, this is Wade Wilson,” the principal introduced, “He’s a junior and he will be showing you around. He’s a bit of a troublemaker, but you seem like a good kid, so hopefully that will rub off on him. Have a great first day.”
‘Why is Wade so persistent? He doesn’t even know me, but he’s acting like he knows we’re going to get together in the future. That’s so not happening,” he thought angrily.
Peter wasn’t quite happy with MJ and her assumptions, so he sped up his pace to reach their classroom faster. He’d rather work on classwork or something than listen to MJ pretending to know him.
Peter was surprised. He didn’t know that Clint was deaf. He also never noticed the hearing aids sitting behind his ears.
“Tony, babe? Can I talk to you?” Steve asked as he entered Tony’s lab. Tony looked up from his work and saw the nervous look on Steve’s face. He got slightly worried.
“Yeah. What’s up?” he responded looking up towards her bed.
“I-I can’t do this!” he shouted and curled into a ball on the floor.
“You okay, Peter?” Steve asked him after noticing he was a bit on edge.
“We wanted a kid that wouldn't likely get adopted by someone else, you know? Like a troubled kid or something,” Tony explained.
“Shit! Sam!” Bucky shouted as he kicked open the door and ran into the room.
Morgan couldn’t help but bust out laughing, causing Tony to chuckle with her.
“You annoy me. Leave.”
“We have a child in our house, Tony.”
Tony smiled and opened his arms, waiting for Steve to return to the bed. Steve laid down and Tony immediately clung to him.
Tony also liked to team up with other people to embarrass Steve. When Natasha asked him “Truth or dare?”, he said dare and winked at her.
I know you’ll never read this because you’re already gone, but I need some closure and May suggested I write you a letter, so here we go.
“So, how was school?” Steve asked, hopeful for a positive response.
Peter awkwardly walked over and sat down beside his father.
“What?” Peter blurted out in shock. He nearly fell over, but he caught himself and quickly sat down on his bed.
“You said you’re not interested in dating ‘right now’. As in I have a chance in the future.” His smirk turned into a smile.
“I love it. This is amazing. Thank you,” he responded as he turned back around and quickly hugged them. They both smiled at him.
“Peter is very difficult. He’s against being adopted in the first place, I thought you two could possibly change his mind, but he’s convinced you wouldn’t want him after you knew who he really is.”
Peter jumped. “N-no. Don't. I'll be fine. Just leave me alone.”
“I slept fine,” he answered Steve.
The only odd thing, though, was that he expected at least a few people to come up to him and ask about his dads or the Avengers. He guessed that the news probably hadn’t gotten out yet because he knew how popular the Avengers are. Regardless, Peter hoped he could keep his identity a secret for a while because he’d rather be that invisible kid in the back of the class, than be mobbed by a bunch of Avengers fans.
“Something is wrong.”
Hey. I know it been forever but I forced myself to write a new chapter for you guys. I’ve also decided for the holidays I’m gonna 2 more chapters over the next 2 days for you guys so enjoy.
Natasha rolled her eyes. “Damn it,” she whispered.
“Okay, don’t freak out,” she warned as she read over the texts.
“How cute,” Steve commented, smiling, as they both walked into the kitchen. “Now come eat so we can get to school on time.”
After his
She felt so selfish for wanting her mom to be at home with her instead of out in space helping people, but she had just gotten her back after 6 years of thinking she was probably dead. She just wanted to spend some time with her mom.
When Peter arrived home after school, he found his floor completely empty. His dads and the Avengers were nowhere to be seen, which was odd because for as long as Peter has lived in the tower, it was never totally empty. He didn’t really mind, though, because after the crappy day he had at school, all he wanted to do was be alone for bit.
“Keep quiet or we kill her,” he heard a deep voice tell him.
“It’s my first day of school. If I have to suffer so do you.”
“I’m Peter.”
By his 14th birthday, Peter had been through nearly 60 foster homes. He was used to moving a lot. It's not like he cared where he went as long as he could still go to school with Gwen. A couple of times his foster homes were too far away from his school so he had to switch. Peter would make his foster families hate him to the point where they wanted him gone immediately. A couple times he’d get pretty bad beating for acting that way, but there was no way in hell Peter would give up Gwen. He loved her and she was all he had.
“What do you mean by ‘compromise’?” Steve responded.
Regardless feel free to leave me a nice comment to remind me people actually like my writing and that I should continue to write. Or go bug me on tumblr.
Pepper pulled him into a tight hug.
“Uh, yeah. I'm fine. I just get worried when people start fighting. Bad things usually happen when people fight.”

Morgan rolled her eyes and giggled. “You’re so dramatic.”
Peter groaned. School was not his favorite subject. He felt like he'd be fine if he didn't go to school. He was smart enough to survive. Also isn't he technically a billionaire now?
