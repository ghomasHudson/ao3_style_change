“Good. You should go there. Would you like me to walk with you?” John asked further and she looked into his open expression.
“You are so unbelievably beautiful! I could just fuck you all day long.. God, you're driving me crazy!” he'd breath with the tone of painful effort of holding back.
“I'm sure. Now let me snog you!” he whispered, mouth crushing to Sherlock's again and was warmly greeted.
“HOW ON EARTH COULD I CALM DOWN WHILE LOSING MY PUP AND HAVING MY MATE FREAK OUT RIGHT NEXT TO ME?!”
They worried more about each other than about themselves. He wondered if that was a blessing or a curse.
The doctor made a few humming noises before handing him a tissue to clean himself. She then locked his feet on these.. pedestals to take a look at his opening, gentle but foreign fingers invading his most private zone. He didn't like it. Couldn't John do it?!
“Don't worry. You seemed like the day was finally catching up to you and there are more pleasant sights than you falling on the stairs and potentially squishing your babies.” The flat way in which Sherlock said that made John swallow hard. It really wasn't a nice image in his mind. Sherlock offered him a cup of tea, but didn't let John take it. Instead he motioned for John to take a seat in his armchair in the living room and set the mug down on the small round table beside him. John took a sip and was happy to find that the drink was at just the right temperature now. Reclining in his chair, he rubbed a hand over his eyes.
He found himself unable to move when Mycroft was walking off, all his words clinging to him like bad omens. “Time to choose a side, Dr. Watson.”
Greg watched him finish their coffees. “Well, isn't that nice? Thanks. You'll be keeping him around then, I assume?” he asked, stirring some milk into his coffee.
Sherlock seemed to be taking it the wrong way. “John, I think I should emphasise that I consider myself married to my work and while I appreciate your company, I'm really not looking for any-”
John frown against his chest as he himself stared at the ceiling, sticking to the ignore-emotion-technique he had pursued for most of the time they had talked. Come to think of it, he hadn't really changed position at all except for that one time on all fours, since all the other ones he'd spent looking up at John bent over him. Unusual for an Alpha to prefer a face-to-face position when their Omega is in heat, since they mostly preferred the submi- wait- their Omega?
How could he do that? The Omega could clearly feel the bones on John's shoulders, his shirts were hanging off his body, looser than ever.
So, I am basically amazed and flattered by the amount of comments the last chapter got. I know first hand that sometimes it's just reading and moving on to the next story, but it really helps an author's confidence AND writing to get some feedback for their work because it really is /work/ and receiving no literal feedback can be really depressing because it feel as if no one can value the effort, which leads to thinking that the content or technique is too bad.
John stumbled over that. He'd always been expected to do housework and leaving a mess like the living room would usually have gotten him some punishment, and not of the sexy sort. “Oh.. Sorry, I-”
Lost in a tangle of legs, hands grasping at hair and lips trying desperately to breath through each other, climax was approaching quickly and an impact inevitable.
John was too good for him. He was concerned and forgiving and Sherlock was just toying with him like he was his personal entertainer. He humbly shut his eyes as the familiar hand carded through his hair. “Still last week's incident? I know, Sherlock... but you've got to let that go. Nothing happened, hm? We're all fine, love.”
John swallowed. “Who says I trust him?” It was working far too well for John's liking, this mind game. He didn't know where Mycroft had gotten those notes, but he didn't want to go any further, either.
“Sorry, I swear I'm not intentionally loading this on you. Wait, where's-” he twisted around, remembering his own popsicle and found a large stain on the carped close to where his head had been. “Shit, no!” He brought his hand against his forehead.
“He'll be out in a minute.” John informed Greg with a little smile, then grabbed Jacob and lifted him out of his high chair. “Right, we're out now. See you in a bit.” And with that, John carried two children, strapped to his chest and back, and their bag downstairs, came back up and took the remaining three in similar manner.
The man came closer to pick up the plate from next to Sherlock's bed. “I am just following orders, Mr. Holmes.” Now Sherlock could get a good whiff of the other's scent. It appeared to be the masked Beta scent. So this man was the only one attending him, it seemed. “The food was kosher, by the way. It wouldn't do to risk your health. So, you can eat whatever is brought to you without fear. After all, we wouldn't want those pups to starve to death, would we? That would be very bad for our negotiations.” the man said with a mean grin on his face. “Your Alpha wouldn't cooperate if you or the pups were unwell and then what use would you be to us?”
“I'm tired. I'll have a pee and be back to bed in a minute. Please be there.” Sherlock whispered, pecking his mate's lips one last time before getting up and going to the bathroom.
John ducked out of the flat and down the stairs. He walked down to the tube and got in with a heavy feeling in his chest. His journey wasn't very long as Yvonne lived close to her office, so he was quick to send a text thanking Sherlock for his continued help as soon as he got reception again. He wasn't surprised when no answer came. Usually, the Alpha replied within minutes to text messages, but John had observed he usually took between quarter to half an hour to answer when he was watching the pups for him. It was kind of sweet, he thought, that Sherlock was so committed to them, especially after the fuss he initially made over not wanting to have anything to do with them and since they weren't, in any way, his. Now it seemed he was just yearning for a chance to spend time with them when he wasn't on a case, which seemed to mean John couldn't be around or needed to at least be napping. He'd worry about Sherlock doing fishy things, but the pups loved him. They wouldn't be so easy around him if he did anything, so John figured he just didn't want to be seen being social and soft.
“Oh, I see you have made a decision, then?” came the kind voice of Dr. Field and they broke apart, John smiling at her shyly. The John-kind of shy, that wasn't really shy, but rather John.
“Well, I think I see were gets his willpower from.” he quirked a smile. “I mean, you don't really seem like the omega stereotype.”
John knew he wasn't overweight, but with the standard that society set for Omegas' beauty, he just felt ugly. Not that it mattered, he wasn't trying to attract any partners, but he missed the strength and agility he once knew as an army doctor. Mrs Hudson's compliments were nice, but hardly helpful. He retreated himself to 221B after about an hour. He was in his bedroom when Sherlock got back in. He heard the Alpha rummaging around, making noise, but he refused to pay him any attention, very much angry at Sherlock's previous move. It took Sherlock merely a few text messages to get John downstairs, though, and the Omega hated himself for it.
John smirked a little and went to sit down by his mate's side. The doctor chuckled kindly. “I am afraid we aren't that far yet. But I will say you are making extraordinary progress! I've seen a couple of Omegas in similar injuries and states, but only very few have showed natural healing processes
“We have to check every side street on the boy's way. See if we can find any clues.” Sherlock replied, pulling his phone out to text the members of his homeless network. He had a couple of them in this area, they might have seen something.
you, John, but I'm an individual. I agreed to set down work for the last couple of months and to not pursue the dangerous ones. That does
The sight of Sherlock's own sadness made his tears spill over. “I know. But I don't know how. I don't.. I can't do this any longer, Sherlock. I'm sorry, but I can't. I've been to war and I don't know how to be a mate to someone, let alone a father. I just fuck up left and right and you're stuck with me and
“Yeah, I do.” John breathed back. Sherlock concentrated fully on his own heartbeat now, feeling the intensity of it in his neck, hearing it in his ears.
“Yes, and I think you will remember that I declined, Dr Watson. My brother is to come home with me.” Mycroft declared, putting one of his 'pleasure not to do business with you' smiles on.
Lisa left her details and made them promise, again, not to tell her parents before taking off. John looked at Sherlock with a troubled expression on his face.
reactions he had neither expected nor predicted because they were not what everyone else would do, stories he never told, just every so often hinted at subconsciously, habits he kept and changed all the time they lived together. It had been over a year now. John and him living together.
And indeed, Sherlock hugged her back, giving her cheek a small peck, then staring at John with eyes widened in annoyance. John frowned. When they parted again, Sherlock had a small smile on his lips and if these really were his parents, they'd see how fake it was, like people who really knew him did. His, apparent, father went over and they, too, hugged, though they passed on the kissing. “Well, John, I suppose you have just met my parents.” Sherlock said, louder than strictly necessary, to skip introductions. “How long are you going to stay?” he asked impatiently.
has an effect. Come.” John said softly, grabbing for Sherlock's hand as they waddled for a walk to the nearest grocery store.
“Wait,” John caught up, “Mummy?” he was confused. These people, this nice and lovely elder couple, the parents of Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes.
The older man grabbed the lifeless body by its shoulders and heaved it up to stand. “As exhausted as you are, you will, trust me.”
“Great, then go get us some.” said the younger man, eyes focusing back on the telly – one of their few entertainers these days as neither could bear to go out with the other for more than two hours any more.
Sometimes, words would slip John's tongue, such as “good Omega, so obedient, so pregnant, carrying my child,” but neither would make a mention of it afterwards.
“Seventeen year old omega boy, went missing two days ago. At first the parents thought it was just another one of his pranks, apparently he does that from time to time, but he didn't come back that night. They're worried as hell - mind you, I'd be, who can blame them.” Lestrade told them, scratching the back of his head nervously at the thought of being in the parents' situation. He may be an incompetent detective, but quite the caring father himself.
“Have you eaten?” came the whispered question and internally, Sherlock laughed at the pity he gave himself because John would never cease to feed him while he was carrying a part of him, too.
“I want to go back to working when I've had these. Is that alright?” John asked, palming his middle for emphasis. That conversation had headed down a road he didn't care to pass at this time. Specifically Sherlock's last comment had set off something deeply unsettling in John. “If I earn my own money I might be able to afford my own flat, be out of your way.”
Sherlock heard his words, but he couldn't make any sense of them. His brain was shut down and he felt as if he was dreaming, far away from reality. Surely this must be a beautifully pleasant dream. He was vaguely pawing at the band of John's trousers, his fingers finally figuring out how to open zip and flies on these bloody jeans. He made a small keening noise as John's brief-clad erection sprang free and he realised just
John was cooking some dinner. Sherlock had told him he was hungry for some steak and now John was cutting up vegetables for a salad to go with it.
John looked to Sherlock, who returned his glance, looking sour. “Who was that?” John asked, heart still pumping at a viscous speed, ready for a fight that was neither his, nor an appropriate one. Being oppressed after years in the military weren't doing good on his nerves.
He watched them toddle off and stood to hang up his jacket before approaching Sherlock. “Were they alright?”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow and propped himself up on one arm again. “Well, I'm sorry I am not the conversational type. I wasn't and I'm still not, difference being, that I like you and I have little chance, what with the whole gender and bond things...” he tried to excuse himself, embarrassed to be losing his reputation.
“Shh. Sherlock, calm down, please. See, I'm calming down, too. Everything's alright! All will be well.” John whispered in agitation, drawing Sherlock close and rocking him gently as he would a child. Their child. The child
They were silent from then on, but it didn't take long to reach their destination either way. John found himself waddling into an empty underground parking lot. It was dark and grey and in some places leaky. All in all, a rather dramatic setting. When he caught sight of Mycroft, he felt it sort of made sense. “I have a phone, you know. Considering you brought it to the flat, you really should know. I mean, very elegant with the car and your PA and all.. but you could have just phoned me. On my phone.”
On the cab ride, Sherlock explained little about where they were going, but filled John in on what it was all about. John remembered reading about serial suicides in the newspaper recently and how the police were getting nowhere with their investigation.
“No! It's... overwhelming.. all these hormones and emotions..” in fact, every time he thought he'd gotten the upper hand, a new situation swept over him like a tidal wave, taking him by too much of a surprise to battle it down in time. The satisfied smile on John's face and the mocking raised eyebrow on Mycroft's didn't make him feel any more dignified.
“Sherlock!” the plump Omega practically purred, cocking her head and approached him with a stance that was clearly expecting a hug.
Sherlock stopped him by pressing his lips against John's. He shifted his weight, drawing a leg back over John's hips. John fought to stop him separating them. “No. No, I'm sorry, please. Don't..”
“I will go back on suppressants. I can pass as an ordinary Omega that way. After all, that's how I got into the army.”
“Keep it cool, mate.” Lestrade piped in, grabbing John's shoulder. “Who does work these days? Are they here today?”
Sherlock said his name again, but this time, he sounded distant, his name a melody rather than a call. As the Omega started rolling his hips, John understood that he was fantasising.
I found it surprisingly hard to start this chapter off, but after a certain part, it practically wrote itself ;) So here's a, uh... taste of what's to come (Jesus Christ, I said stop it, my brain's out of control..)
“Look, Sherlock, I honestly don't know what it is you are feeling at the moment, but let me tell you, I can very well imagine.. Whatever comes out of this appointment,
He felt guilty for not even giving them a chance to impress other people, wasting them on being worn in the flat. He was grateful, though, as he thought he would find the alternative process rather humiliating. He knew he looked like a beach ball and, while he didn't mind it himself much – he was very pregnant after all – people never viewed these things quite as simply. Especially Purists had a reputation of not being able to keep their legs shut and the fact that John was pregnant
his help, he'd been managing for over a year now with Sherlock doing little more than paying the rent, providing basic things like money for clothing and food and occasionally feeding an early bird or waking John from unintended naps on the floor. Nevertheless, he wanted John to be healthy and happy and that meant he needed more time for himself. Of course, the Omega could work less at the surgery, but he didn't seem to want to and Sherlock wanted to be the absolute last person to ever suggest that, especially after what he knew of John's past, which, admittedly, he didn't think was a whole lot in relation to what was actually all there.
“John.” the low rumble sounded and John turned back around to look at his mate's blank face as he sank into the hot water with his eyes closed. “I know I'm being very emotional and changeable. I suppose my hormones are spiralling because of.. “
“Teenage omega boy, running of at night – clearly a romantic, but the desperate kind, imagining and wanting their life to be like in one of those films. John, that.. crappy... about the vampires and werewolves and that stupid omega teenage girl...”
John eventually broke their silence by kissing Sherlock and then speaking. “Had I ever known what prostate stimulation really feels like, I would have done this ages ago.” he chuckled.
as most people thought him, he was far from that! Just because he wore those ridiculously adorable jumpers and could socialise, didn't mean he wasn't suffering from PTSD and fighting his own disturbed mind with all his willpower. But no one ever looked at the shaking hand, most people didn't even realise John was left-handed! They only saw limp and cane and thought 'ah, well, he was a soldier, he will have gotten wounded', but not one of them saw it was an at least partly psychosomatic limp. Nobody noticed how uncomfortable John could get talking to people, how he loathed the general ignorance of society and despised talking to narrow-minded, superficial, stupid people. John surely wasn't a genius, but lord he was intelligent. Smart. Cunning.
Slowly he lowered his head again to take John's lips in for another passionate kiss, then another, then one that didn't want to end.
“I do hope I'm not keeping you two apart.” Mycroft offered sarcastically after John had been reading and re-reading the text, pondering on the intention.
“John, you don't have more time. It's very impressive you could go this long without eating or sleeping properly and I am more than overwhelmed by how strong you still are, guiding me around with so much of my weight still leaning on you – and I bet, at the moment, I weigh more than you. But you're pushing your limits, John, you're this close to collapsing! Hand me my phone.”
“Do you touch yourself?” Sherlock asked in an unexpected rush of bravery. He saw a chance to coax John and, by God, he would take it. “During your build-up for sex? Do you think of all the things you want to do to me and pleasure yourself?”
The rest of the appointment was just Dr. Field remarking how well everything looked and that they were doing a good job with the situation. On their way out, she asked them to make a new appointment and to remember looking through the pamphlets.
His heart was pounding so strongly he barely had a chance to calm down as he heard it thumping in his ears and felt his throat and wrists moving slightly with the force of it.
John stepped back from the bed and Sherlock swung his arm behind himself and waved his hand up and down. John understood, stopped and took his hand. “What is it?” he asked and followed as he was weakly pulled back into the room.
right now, dear nature, not to spare a sociopath from it. Lacking empathy doesn't seem to be too much of a thrill when dealing with one's panicking Alpha mate.
John took Angelo's absence as an opportunity to look around and study the familiar grounds. The restaurant was busy, but to a more than acceptable level, the conversations around them blurring into an even buzz with the occasional laughter topping it. There were people of all ages, families, friends, lovers and even a group of probably entertainers of some sort, regarding the straight backs and graceful movements. When his eyes fell back on his mate, he was aware he had been looking at him all that time. He cocked his head to one side as in question.
Sherlock's face pinched up in suspicion. It wasn't the first time he'd pulled that face. It wasn't the first time he felt suspicious of John either. “That's to be expected. But you are on a good way. I'm glad to see you make progress.”
The detective waved his hand dismissively, taking a few steps to where there was still tea in the pot. “Oh, I.. probably deleted the information. I don't usually anticipate my parents visiting me – they can be so very dull! Ugh, and Mycroft tries to make me take them to a musical he has promised to take them to.” John huffed a little chuckle at the thought of Mycroft in a musical audience. “A
Greg glanced down at the boy in response to the curse, but said nothing when Tommy didn't react. He sighed, nodding. “Sure makes me uncomfortable.” He was looking around, then, as he shook his head. “God damn, this is the 21
Due to my sudden burst of gratitude, I am giving you the next chapter already instead of leaving you hanging with anticipation after that last one. Next one will take a bit again, though - haven't begun it yet, but it's all right there in my head ;)
“Yes, and I have been protesting this for just as long! Had any of you ever paid the slightest bit of attention to my
John chuckled proudly. “That's what I've been teaching you: You're impatient, too eager. You always prepared yourself for hours on end, there was no resistance left whenever I got to you, next to no friction. I always just worked myself right to the edge before coming upstairs because I knew you weren't gonna satisfy me.” he said, pressing a kiss against Sherlock's shoulder. “You had to learn somehow.”
that. “How can you still trust me? After all the things you know about me, experienced yourself and haven't yet heard, how can still believe I am actually suited to bring up your children?“
“Sherlock is on his way here, John. Let's just wait till he gets here, so you can see he's okay, hm?”
When he did wake up, however, shock and exasperation were written all over his face. “Jesus Christ! Oh, god- did I-?! Sherlock, was I-?! Fuck- FUCK! I'm so sorry- I'm so bloody sorry!”
Interesting. Usually, an Alpha would be proud to have an oversized cock, but apparently John was rather ashamed of it, although he had never been shy about sex before.
Sherlock didn't know it, and it made John feel a little giddy to watch him obliviously move back to consuming the last crumbs of bread and forkfuls of his meal, but, indeed, John had turned down an invitation to a date three days before this whole madness had started because he'd felt weird about it and thinking about it for the rest of that day and the entirety of that night had let him come to the long-denied conclusion, that he was already in love. Fallen, help- and hopelessly for his flatmate and best friend, who would never have known, had he not gone into heat.
Sherlock sank back into the examination-chair, releasing a deep breath. “So, I'm not losing the pup?” he breathed.
Sherlock giggled in delight behind him. Who needed an Alpha when you had John Watson; half as tall, twice as dominant, fluffy as a kitten and viscous as a tarantula on steroids.
John snorted in amusement. “You're terrible with moods!” he whispered against Sherlock's lips, their foreheads together.
“That's quite alright.” He briefly laid the phone down close by a he put on his shoes. Then he had a thought and quickly picked it up again. “And, John. Get something to eat.”
“That doesn't mean an Alpha is ready to let their Omega penetrate them anally.” Sherlock said, smug grin and raised eyebrow.
“I know, love.” the doctor soothed, stroking the Omega's cheek with his thumb. “I know.” Leaning forward again, John kissed him once more, his other hand still on his partner's belly. “What do you want to eat?”
“I have a potential client coming later this morning and I was hoping you would.. assist me.” Sherlock knew it sounded a bit stumbled, but he couldn't think of better words. He didn't need help as such and he didn't want John to feel like an accessory, dragged along to feed the Alpha's pride. Not when there was that honest, and fragile, glimmer of hope in his expression.
“Sometimes, with a newly formed cycle and an exuberant amount of copulation, an Omega can conceive even outside of heats. If an Alpha is found and bonded with, the constant stimulation can cause an ovum to drop. Luckily this one hasn't been fertilised, but was flooded out of your body again after it 'expired', if you so like. That is what happened yesterday night. That is what the bleeding was.”
At that, the doctor moved back down on his partner's body, rubbing their pricks together before sitting upright and grabbing the brunets cock to line it up with his hole.
“Oh, come on then, I'll help you.” John said, shifting, but Sherlock held him down, pinned with his own upper half.
Three weeks into pregnancy and Sherlock was retching for the better part of two hours each morning and evening, often also at night. John would sit beside him and stroke his back soothingly, while listening to Sherlock blaming him between heaves. After half an hour, John would get up and make tea to balance Sherlock's body nutrients. And sometimes he'd make three or four cups because the mere taste of tea made him vomit.
I hate children, but the learning process in animals is fascinating. It's nice to have a setting in which children develop more quickly, that makes it easier ;)
There must have been a look on Sherlock's face, that he wasn't aware of himself, but in John it had certainly triggered a very, very guilty feeling. “Calm down, John, it's not your fault. It... It was me, I do apologise, and I realise this must be a rather compromising circumstance for you, but I assure you, I would never tell a soul. This is entirely my fault-”
She checked his CV again. “You're, uhm... well, you're a bit over-qualified.” It was the first time he'd ever heard such praise directed at him.
You may also notice that I'm changing the formatting to make the chapters look nicer and easier to read. There may still occur hiccups, but I'm working to fix everything from chapter 1 onward. If anyone feels qualified to Beta things for me (which also entails getting to read chapters early and potentially discuss story elements and give immediate feedback to me), please hit me up via email (kinkmerighthererightnow@gmail.com) or on tumblr (http://kinkmerighthererightnow.tumblr.com/), where I don't check regularly, but I'll still see it in time :) I do have the conditions that you be mature and have good English skills - otherwise I could just beta myself, which I'm simply too lazy to do.
Retrieving their tray from the kitchen, John experimentally placed its edges on the sides of the tub and it held. Sherlock put down his tea on it with a grateful grunt. John lovingly patted his hair before getting up. “Call me if you need me, yeah?”
(And, yes, no notes at the beginning this time. I figured it wouldn't do much good on the atmosphere^^)
“Your deodorant told me that.” he said arrogantly and John, knowing the burn that was about to befall this poor sod, readied himself to be able to follow Sherlock's train of thought.
For hours John sat beside Sherlock, holding his hand, unable to refrain from touching and kissing his long missed mate. Now and then his hand would travel down to his abdomen and feel his heart sink at how small the bulge was for being filled with four pups and approaching its five-months-mark. How little had that bastard offered him? Had Sherlock eaten all of it? For their children? Surely he would have just let himself starve to death otherwise, that maniac. No, that wasn't fair, Sherlock had endured a lot, John shouldn't be thinking of him like that.
Mycroft gave him a look that clearly repeated 'trust issues'. Somehow, that made John offer his hand up again. Mycroft took it between both of his, studying it. “Remarkable.” he finally concluded.
Sherlock let his hand fall from John's face and instead held his hand. “I know. But if I hadn't- I mean... Maybe you would never have been...”
His muscles were still mostly lax, slowly tensing more and more as his brain gave orders to move, but the cold tickled their reflex to try and produce warmth through the exertion. Honestly, the human body wasn't really an expert at keeping itself warm, but then again, why would it be? Evolution had reduced the necessary fur and fat layers with the growing use of clothing. However, a too tight shirt and some tailored trousers didn't provide much warmth in an unheated room in what looked like the basement to an apartment building. Screaming wouldn't do though, he was sure. Besides, remaining calm would be healthiest – he wouldn't risk his pups like that in a fruitless attempt to get out, especially when he didn't know his enemy.
.” Sherlock replied, wrinkling his nose. “Tell me you've got an interesting case!” he demanded dramatically, consumed by the sheer agony of having nothing to but to organise his mind palace and that he had already done during John's last shift two days ago.
It took the paramedics long and torturous minutes to finally arrive and when they did, they asked John to step away – how could they take his mate away in a situation like this?! Only upon explaining he was a doctor was John allowed to assist, hold Sherlock's hand, kiss his forehead and hold one of his legs as they were shoved apart.
“Just found him in the alley. Drugs, probably ODed. Cancel my 5 o'clock appointment.” the man was saying quickly, bustling past the woman and up a set of stairs.
He focussed on his breathing and caressed the limb a little bit. Five minutes between them. This was going quicker than he'd expected.
John looked blank and for a moment Sherlock feared he'd misinterpreted John's behaviour towards him, but then the Alpha turned his hand so their palms were touching and squeezed lightly as if to signalise that the message has been processed and appreciated.
His colour drained and he looked like a cold corpse even more than usual. At least, John thought, Sherlock ate, ate much more than usual. There were days he seemed insatiable and John mused about how he would get later on, when the pup actually grew in size and required more nutrition. It was all so visible in his innocent features and Sherlock couldn't stop deducing, even if he tried.
“John..” he muttered, the information not having quite caught. Until now. “John!” he shouted, shaking his mate awake. “JOHN!”
“Yes, Mycroft, I get it, I have accepted this fact by now – I don't have that big a problem with your proposals anymore.”
Pain. Wrong. Something was wrong and it was making itself known by wrecking Sherlock's body with cramping muscles in his abdomen. It got worse and it didn't seem to know how to end. A grunt escaped his throat, he finally opened his eyes. Something was odd, but his sleep-addled brain couldn't piece it together yet. His arse felt wet. Cramping in the abdominal area, slick around the after – he couldn't be in heat, he was pregnant already! He threw the blanket over John's sleeping form to see for himself what the source of this unnameable pain was.
They didn't perform oral sex on Omegas, not even if they were their pregnant mates. It was beneath them. Their natural pride wouldn't allow it. Unless it was a perfect bond. A perfect bond.
The Omega wasn't sure if Sherlock was asking him or himself, but he was curious if the Alpha knew the answer already. “Dunno, who?”
“I'm sorry.” Sherlock said to appease his Alpha and simply leant forward to give it a hearty lick up the shaft, just to dip down into the slit, tasting the pre-come John had produced when his Omega had worked lower regions, the work now being picked back up.
Sherlock reluctantly rolled onto his back and pulled at John's hand. The Alpha understood and bent down to give his Omega a proper kiss. “Now you can go.” Sherlock said and turned away from him again. He heard John chuckle behind him as he left the room.
“I still won't live off your brother's wealth.” the Alpha grinned as Sherlock huffed out an annoyed breath. “You might be a sociopath, but I still have my pride. Can't change my opinion about certain things.. Not anymore.”
John huffed out an amused breath. “Don't you think that's a bit of a late notice?” he asked, leaning down to kiss Sherlock's temple.
The doctor nodded, although he clearly didn't fully understand. “John Watson.” he introduced himself. He looked Sherlock up and down. “How old are you? I'd say sixteen? seventeen?”
John and Sherlock exchanged a look and approached them further. Lisa was in tears as she spoke. “Thank you so much! I didn't expect you to find him so quickly.”
“Alright,” he said, ordering the other men to set Sherlock's legs back down, ”Mr. Holmes, your after is neither swollen nor dilated, only reddened. As long as you don't excrete any larger clumps, I don't see your pup in necessary danger, however, I would advise you to see your doctor as soon as possible. When is your next regular check-up?”
“Oh, I'm not stopping you. You are right in your position, I'd just like you two to play fair with one another, yes, that goes for you as well as for him, Sherlock. But I tell you one thing Mycroft: If you make him feel uncomfortable in
“You are a trained military doctor, you were wounded in action, I noticed your limp on the way here, but you're keeping your exercising routine up. You miss the war. You're only practising because it pays well, you would much rather go back to the military, but they won't take a surgeon with a tremor and a limb, not even a skilled one like yourself.” Sherlock fired.
Sherlock practically roared as John's body clenched around him and he spilled deep inside his mate, thrusts stopping immediately when he was buried inside John all the way.
“No. No, you don't get to say sorry. You know well enough that none of this was your fault and you couldn't have made it any better than the way you did.”
“Could you stuff away your stupid alpha pride for a minute and just accept that we need support here!?” Sherlock bellowed and startled John with it. He stepped up to him, hands comind to each of the other's arms. “John, I love you dearly, but you alone can't provide for a family of six individuals
Mycroft looked at him for a moment before turning and leaving them alone again. It wasn't long after that Sherlock's body was shaken by spasms and he curled in on himself, facing John as his soar throat released tight moans of pain. They were getting easier, calmer, less severe, but John suffered through every second with Sherlock.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and removed his arm from where it pinned John's throat to the wall. Immediately John's hand reached up to examine his temple which had just taken a serious punch from his mate. “You really need to get your skates on.”
“Wh- How?!” John's question fell on deaf ears, like so often, and he thought to himself that it was less enigmatic, as Sherlock seemed to hope, and more annoying. Nevertheless, he caught up with the Alpha's long stride and they were marching straight for the entrance of the shabby place. There was a guard outside, a tall Beta with broad shoulders. He was about twice John's height, twice Sherlock's width.
“Why do you always let me eat this much?!” Sherlock accused as he had a wretch-free moment over the toilet.
Of course, I'll help you as much as I can whenever I'm home, but in contrast to you, when you're not on hormones, I mean, I do have to sleep and eat..”
A loud growl announced the impending relief of Sherlock's torture. His mind darkly registered a deep joy inside of him. He only hoped the Alpha wasn't in a rut. He wouldn't know the scent of it, but he'd feel the knot ripping him apart.
To think about how John had kissed it just this morning, had pushed his pelvis against his softer arse, nipped at their bond bite and gripped at the soft flesh on his hips while he thrust deep against that sweet spot- no, concentrate!
“Oh, you wanna go see right now? I mean I can hardly wear this thing now, can I? Might as well get it off.”
“Yes,” John answered, “only I don't seem able to stop tending to you.” With this, he pushed his tongue forward and into Sherlock's mouth.
Sherlock, moments later, sat down in that same spot. He raised his mug to his lips, looked at John and sighed, lowering his coffee again. “Do not tell me you are feeling bad about this now.”
John had never been so close and he would never let him back away, he swore to his heart's holy demon.
The younger man rubbed both hands down his face. “I don't want you to move out.” he finally admitted and John was taken aback.
“Well, anyway. I will go back to work as soon as possible, just like I will leave as late as possible, and I will work as many shifts as possible- no,
John chuckled. “Then everything you shall have. Well, at least everything we've got here.” and with a final chaste kiss, he got up to prepare a right dinner buffet of which Sherlock ate almost everything and later threw up almost half of.
“So, what the hell are you doing, John?! Deliberately starving yourself?! Trying to punish yourself for something that's not your-”
Silent pride and smugness also decorated John's face as he nodded his head, then looked straight ahead with his chin high as he said “Thank you.”
“Shut up..!” there was a mewling sound, that confirmed John – Sherlock was too far gone himself already. It was the same mewling every time, John had remembered it as one of the standard noises Sherlock made during sex. It was a high-pitched, strangled sounding little sound that marked the point of no return for the Omega. There followed a series of moans that always sounded like Sherlock was surprised about having sex – something John would never really understand, but appreciated for the arousing effect they had. When Sherlock had rutted himself to his climax, he leaned forward heavily, trapping John between the chair and himself. The Alpha followed just a second later.
“That's what makes me different from most Omegas.” he smirked and John returned the expression. It felt nice to see he could still do this; manipulate others without feeling guilty or any of that idiocy. It made arguing with John a lot easier.
“Yeah, I was meant to be picking up my kids about now... A friend's going to look after them for me, but, you know.”
, to not have it penetrate his senses any longer. A drawn-out, painful moan for his mate was barely interrupted by the screeching of the door, announcing his usual 'company' to the room.
careless! I have chosen an adequate mate, conceived a child – I am only three weeks along, Mycroft and I have only decided I will keep it a week ago! Excuse my not being as perfectly quick as wished for! And anyway, I don't see you with child!” he argued. He couldn't stand Mycroft trying to educate him.
John nodded, cutting the lettuce into squares. “I've noticed. That's good, they're back on their schedule.”
“No, that's fine.” John smiled back at her. Sarah was very pretty in her ordinary way. He liked her smile; it seemed so honest.
The elder woman wrinkled her nose as she hesitated in giving his pup over to him. Alex, too shifted in disturbance, sleep falling away gradually at the unpleasant smell on his Omega. “Maybe you should take a shower first. If I am bothered by that smell, and I am way past my prime, then I don't think the little ones would appreciate it either.”
Sherlock listened for the door downstairs to close and got up after a breath that prepared him for the torture that was other people. It took him 2 minutes to get dressed, absolutely not in the mood to wear just his sheet. He went straight for the mugs and threw “coffee?” at Greg as he came into view.
“That's alright. Don't worry about it.” he replied, then left. He went back into the living room, where he picked up his abandoned tea and sank down into his chair. He pondered Sherlock's words. The Omega had been warmer ever since his heat and while he'd always kind of kept his old self, he had been a lot more open and emotional with John. Not that he minded, but it was a little heartbreaking to still see him uncomfortable with his new behaviour. Since he got back, Sherlock had been 'worse', yes, but John hadn't expected an outbreak like
John draped his arms around Sherlock as the call was finally answered. “Hello? Yes, we need an ambulance. 221B Baker Street. My mate is possibly having a miscarriage. Yes, thank you.”
There he was, sitting in his chair like any other day, feeling unusually warm, despite the chilling autumn weather, the heaters still cold at this time of year.
I think you'll want to reconsider picking a fight with a Captain of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers, sir. Since you don't appear to have invited me for any reason other than to humiliate me with your sexism, I will be on my way now. Don't reply. I will break your nose.” he nearly whispered in his rage, pulling his jacket from the back of the chair and leaving the room, door left where it had swung wide open.
Instead, Sherlock pointedly involved John in mundane things like breakfast and dinner (whether he ate some himself or not was irrelevant), offering him tea and coffee repeatedly, forgetting John was pregnant and couldn't have them, asking if he could buy a thing or two when he next went out shopping. And, most surprisingly, having clothes delivered by mail. The wardrobe in John's bedroom slowly began to fill up more and more. All clothes he would have bought for himself as well and the right sizes at that. He never had to worry about going to the shops, having himself measured and being pointed to clothes that looked like tents. The stuff Sherlock was having delivered for him seemed to be tailored perfectly to flatter his figure.
Sherlock us the saliva he left on and a tiny bit inside the resistant muscles and on his index finger as he licked it, to push said finger tryingly into the little hole.
He had done it when they were children, making it obvious he was to present as omega and had not stopped since because he had never had children of his own, or even a second heat. He had loathed his nature and had acted against it ever since he'd known about it. “No, but without your work for Scotland Yard, you would never have found private clients.”
This chapter almost wrote itself, I'm a little stunned. I started two nights ago and here it just is..
He didn't want to hear it. “Get. Out!” His insides were flaring with worry and unease. His pup was in danger. He couldn't have his pup in danger. He needed to protect his pup.
“Very detailed plan, isn't it?” Mycroft mocked to display his higher position to Sherlock. “I gather there was an abnormality discovered at your ultrasound the other day?” his brother added to piss him off as best as possible.
“Hm.” John confirmed, yawning heartily before burying his nose in Sherlock's chest. “We have an appointment in two weeks.”
“I don't... Not for nothing, but I don't feel good about taking them to someone else's. They're still so small and they've started a phase where they're wary of strange adults..”
“You won't touch me at all. You aren't even reacting to any sort of approach I try on you. You keep telling me that you love me, so, naturally, I have to assume that my physique is putting you off.” Sherlock explained, rather angrily.
“Sometimes,” she said with a shrug. “Come on, I put a lot of effort into dinner, I'm not letting that go to waste.” She grabbed his hand and led him into the kitchen.
“Yes. I have always wanted this.” Although Sherlock could see the mild surprise over that fact on John's face, the Alpha didn't say anything. “Are you manipulating me?!”
Upon this, Mycroft huffed out an annoyed breath but left. John turned and went to fetch his laptop, Sherlock lingered a moment, drunk on the display of dominance. The Alpha he had been promised to was known for her qualities in the BDSM world, but she was weak at heart. They'd met once and he could read the sentiment on her face as she lay eyes on him.
“Well, yes, technically. The reproductive organs and mechanisms are still intact in some, but really that would depend on the genetic-”
327 Kudos, 101 Comments (granted, half of which are my replies to your comments) and 64 bookmarks?! Woah, it's only 14 chapters, guys, I am overwhelmed! Thank you so much!
“No?” John chuckled at Alex's proud rebellion. “Oh, dear. You know we still need him, right? Papa can't afford to pay rent
The woman turned to him now, giving her husband the chance to shake John's hand warmly while she patted Sherlock's cheek. “And yet you look like it's been at least 12.” she said proudly, pinching the newly developed fat on his hip.
The Omega knew it was a stab, but he had always been bad at not defending himself. “She knows about them, they were one of the first things I brought up with her, in fact. She's asked to meet them, but I don't want to take them out the house overnight just yet and for some reason I'm a bit reluctant to bring her here.”
happened, is that you dropped another ovum, likely a reaction to the high amount of sex you are having after your cycle has just begun. Your body is confused.”
“Sorry, did I just text a murderer?! What good will that do?” Just as he finished his question, his phone lit up and started ringing. They both looked at it with mixed feelings. The caller ID said the number was withheld.
He took the stairs quickly, entering the darkened room quietly. While much more independent, Purist pups tended to be more sensitive to light, so he kept his blinds mostly shut throughout the day. He didn't mind. As they still mainly slept, he spent little time in the room either way, using the time to set up his own independence instead. He knew they needed the peace and the space, bonding with each other as they went through this stage. He bent over Katherine's cot, stroke her chubby blushed cheek to wake her up. She sighed happily before smacking her lips clumsily and blinking her eyes open. “Hello darling. It's time for some lunch, don't you think?” he hummed softly to her and, as if agreeing with him, stuck her short arms up. He chuckled, picked her up and leaned her back against himself. He kissed her temple and lay her down on his bed, then went to pick up Alex, who was already talking to him, having been woken by his voice.
a possibility..” the Alpha continued to mutter, the intensity of his scent increasing as his nature tried to calm his 'pregnant mate in distress'.
There he was, suddenly realising and feeling ashamed, humiliated, by the first wet gush he felt leaking out of the one place he had never expected to feel so needy for attention about.
“That's great. Sounds like it was a successful evening for you. And did you treat Sherlock nicely, too?”
Sherlock's back to him - not that Sherlock ever wanted to decide positions, he knew little about all this after all - and then reached around, lightly pressing against the slightly hanging tissue.
Now, another two weeks later, John sat in the red armchair, that had become 'his', six months pregnant, still thinking about everything Mycroft had said.
Greg and he watched the two Omegas through the one-way glass. No words had fallen yet. Mr Edwards was assessing the situation. John was assessing his weak spots. By the look in his eyes, Sherlock could tell John was going to try to break him. He knew he should have told Lestrade this, so things could be called off before it was too late or something, but he didn't want to deny John this. The Alpha had long suspected John needed an outlet for what seemed to be a lifetime of horrible events and while a psychiatrist would have been the safer option, the Omega didn't have money for one and he was guaranteed not to accept that kind of help from Sherlock as well.
“Well- I mean- uh...” John stammered and Sherlock recapitulated what exactly it was that defined a couple in a romantic relationship. Love, passion. They had that. Closeness, trust. Check. They even lived together.
cold towards him. “Okay.” he said, then nodded and awkwardly got up to fetch their cups and pour the boiling water into them. Handing Sherlock his mug with a murmured “I'll leave you to yourself then”, setting his own down on the small table, he took their bag and carried it into their bedroom, beginning to sort clean and dirty clothes and putting them away appropriately. He supposed it were the hormones. Other pregnant Omegas might get overly emotional, maybe Sherlock just got overly detached. He shouldn't be taking it harshly. Actually, he should have expected it. He didn't know why it affected him so badly, but something seemed to fall into place inside his mind, a gap that finally closed. He let himself fall back to sit on the bed, his head suddenly empty and full to the brim at the same time.
by the end of it and might not be able to ever lose the weight or even the breasts he was going to grow. Thinking of himself all bloated, in feminine shape, saggy belly and stretch marks everywhere, job quit because he couldn't physically keep up any longer – it disgusted him. John would leave him, surely, for a more attractive version. No, John wasn't the kind of man to do that. But they'd stop kissing and touching and having sex, which was bad because Sherlock liked sex! And as someone who got addicted so easily, he got a little addicted to John's closeness. And his cock.
“This is his hunting ground, right here in the heart of the city. Now that we know his victims were abducted, that changes everything. Because all of his victims disappeared from busy streets, crowded places, but nobody saw them go. Think! Who do we trust, even though we don’t know them? Who passes unnoticed wherever they go? Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?”
down there. He was so far gone; too far, in fact, to even be repelled by this disgusting craving of being infiltrated by another person's genitalia, like he always had been with other people. Right now, that seemed simply marvellous, most desirable.
In the night blurring week three of his kidnapping into week four, Sherlock faces more enemies than the obvious creep. Ironically, it might just lead to his rescue.
“Sure.” John replied, smiling a little. Sherlock knew John sounded disbelieving on purpose and therefore just stared back at him until John took a sip of his water. Then, he simply mimicked the action, drowning his exhaustion from walking on aching feet with as much water as was possible to drink without John noticing.
When he opened his eyes again, the room was dark. And also not the living room. In fact, he dimly recognised it to be their bedroom. It was dark outside and John's steady, deep breathing a warm feeling in his chest. He rolled around to where his mate lay on his back, one arm on his belly, the other trapped beneath Sherlock's back. He regarded John for a moment, then draped himself over more than half of John's body and fell back asleep within mere minutes.
“I'm not going to chase people around London for a while and John wants to do his best to support me.” Sherlock answered triumphantly, knowing fully well Mycroft knew he knew. It was their sibling bond.
He didn't care about what others thought of him, he never had. He was born with this body, he knew and accepted how he was biologically destined to look this way – he only ever tried to look good enough for himself and he found tight shirts and slim tailored dark suits suited his dark curls and pale skin and eyes well. Being fit was a benefit his job brought and he wouldn't change anything only because he had presented as an Omega now. Alphas didn't like tall and muscular Omegas anyway. Well, except John, apparently. John liked to copulate with him nonetheless and when Sherlock got bored, he made use of that fact. Like the other day, when he had laid between his and John's armchairs, John working on his laptop, and he had lifted the device out of his lap, with his foot, and placed it on his own chair. John hadn't protested, just looked at Sherlock disbelievingly for a second and then had followed many minutes of John roughly pushing him over the wooden floor.
As if on cue, Sherlock shot back to dip his head into the toilet. He blindly punched the air behind him, trying to hit his laughing mate.
It was a challenge Sherlock was too pregnant to accept. He wanted to settle this pointless spinning in circles. “Can we at least try it?”
“Good to see you all cheered up.” Greg commented with a grin directed at John, who gave him a small smile, focusing on Sherlock again.
“I never thought of these crimes as something that could happen in my own life. Then again, I never thought I'd make friends with somebody, let alone find a mate or have children.” Sherlock admitted after a while. “Do you really think we will be able to keep them safe from these things?” he asked honestly, looking down at where his hands roamed his shirt-clad belly.
John was dialling someone, presumably an ambulance, and crawling back to him. “Sherlock, I need you to stay calm.” he tried to say in a comforting voice and failing spectacularly.
a purist.” John pressed out through his teeth, eyes closed. He then realised what he'd just said and looked around quickly to see if anyone else could have heard. It was just the three of them. “That's how Sherlock and I met. He found me in that actioning house you shut down about a year back.”
Currently, they were looking at “Item 341”, a very young Omega, with innocent green eyes and a silent acknowledgement of his defeat. “He is an Omega of high ranks, well bred and nothing, if not a good house-omega.” The guide continued talking, spitting out information that was this poor soul's life. They were kept in here like animals in a zoo.
Sherlock leaned forward, crawling into John's lap like a cat, cupping his face and tilting it up to kiss him. “Had anyone ever told me I would once be addicted to kissing someone, I'd have declared them mad..”
“Well, for me she moves a bit too fast. For her, I move too slowly.” he sighed, knowing he'd have to be more specific, but not wanting to go into more detail. “She wants to meet them. They don't want to meet anybody.”
Sherlock leaned forward, closing the small gab between them then, starting with a soft kiss, which then turned into an assault of more passionate kisses. “How about we skip dinner and walk, and I just ride you?” Sherlock's voice vibrated deep in John's chest as he nuzzled against him softly, lips brushing against John's while he spoke.
It's sooo short :'( But I'm afraid, from now on, most chapters are going to be rather short as I am not sure how many ideas I'll have that aren't too similar to each other and I've got a lot of chapters to fill with at least a bit of plot. Yes, plot will continue to be quite present in the future, but no worries, I won't forget about the smut - how could I :3
He was too tired to really focus on much on his way home. The best he could do was look forward to getting back to his pups, which was pretty much a given at any time any way. Part of him was envious of Sherlock, having spent another evening with them. He bet they'd played games, like Cluedo, and that they love Sherlock and think their papa is lame. And if they were old enough to to have these thoughts, they'd pity him for being incredibly pathetic and insecure. Or maybe that was just himself.
“Financially, yes. Anything might happen any day, but my savings will have you off comfortably, no matter what happens- listen, John. I estimate there is no reason in telling you that I do regard you as a capable Alpha and an appropriate mate for my brother. You are, in fact, one of the few I would trust with my life, which is to be taken as a great compliment and not one to be expected a single more time. I trust your competence in any field, including your profession, but you know yourself how little you can afford on your wages as it is.”
In bed they lay side by side for a long while, cuddling, tracing light patterns with fingertips, kissing, enjoying. They finished of the day with Sherlock climbing on top of John, kissing him deeply, sliding down between his legs and sucking him off with expertise while stroking himself to completion.
Lie. Lie! He misinterpreted the 'obliged', didn't he? Sherlock wouldn't submit just because he was in heat! Stupid John. “You don't
“Ugh, that house had been scrubbed to the last inch! It reeked of chemicals all just aiming to erase his scent. Your nose would have been too occupied with all of that to really pick up his remaining traces. For that, you deal with hormones too subconsciously. You smelled it, but it was so faint in comparison that the info wasn't even considered. As a purist myself, I have a much more sensitive nose, especially towards other purists. For reproduction or protection, that all depends on the individuals at hand. My suppressants limit my ability to pick up certain scents, but not enough that I wouldn't smell an OP racing towards heat.”
He only noticed Sherlock when he mage the mattress dip low beside him. His head snapped over to look at his mate and Sherlock's look was still distant, but warmer. “I turned off the tab, then.” he said, falling quiet for a minute before starting again. “I don't like you very much at the moment, John. You're not my mate. It seems we're back to when we first met. Like you're trying, but you're not being as open with me as you want me to be with you. What am I to you? The strange, intriguing man, who knew more about you than you would like after knowing you only a couple of seconds? Am I that weird, breezy, drug-addicted man you couldn't really trust?”
Sherlock stepped right behind him, drawing his arms around John's waist. It wasn't as narrow as his own, but that's just how John was built. It didn't make him any less thin. “I could help you, you know.” Sherlock murmured into his hair.
“Yes, maybe rather not,” Sherlock hummed, musing, “you would probably spill it.” he added, deliberate tease.
“Let me finish. I know this must be way off anything you expected for your life, especially with it coming so very late-”
The other reason is, that my body has noted there is an Omega in heat, which it has already tended to once. If I go, my body would seek you out again because I'm trimmed to taking care of you right now and I might either go out and rape any Omega that smells even the least bit of heat or I'll, too, develop psychological deficiencies because my Alpha nature thinks me incapable of fulfilling my duties, acting on instinct and tending to Omegas.
John, relieved Sherlock was ready to drop the subject, replied relatively easily to what seemed to be the most important question in the matter. “Not to me.”
Sherlock groggily raised his head from the side of the tub, a thick, red stripe along his cheek marking his error. “Mh. Much more relaxed, yes.” he replied in a barely intelligible murmur.
It worked so very, incredibly well, that he did not even mind his unresolved feelings for this situation, for John.
Ah, I'm sorry it took so long, but I'll spare you all the details from now on. Just read and enjoy.. I guess.
John wandered out to the building's entrance to get himself a coffee. He was down to bracing himself against walls, tremors shaking his body and an old friend ramming needles into his leg. He felt so miserable. His head twitched and jerked into the wall, hitting it hard multiple times. When the open area made him visible to the nurse at the front desk, the young man pushed himself out of his chair to assist, but John raised a trembling hand.
just stay here, John. I can afford accommodating us both and, well, you have met Mycroft, he seems eager to keep you around me.”
So, here's an apology for last chapter's embarrassing outcome. I on't pretend any of what I do is 'good', but most is definitely better than the crap I produced last time - I had an emotional period. I can't write when I'm emotional.
A moment later, he he was pressed flat against the wall. John was rubbing against him, biting Sherlock's lips, his throat, his neck, his ear. This. This was what he'd been looking for in John. Savagery. An Alpha who could be both calm and composed, but also letting himself be driven entirely by instinct. Hurting him. Dominating him. Making him feel small.
“The pup and I are both fine!” Sherlock snapped back angrily. It was just the kind of mockery he couldn't take at the moment, he was worried enough anyway.
How could this have happened to him? All his life he had managed to stay far, far away from this Alpha-Omega trivia. He had
John had paid him his full attention the moment he'd been accused of positioning Sherlock below him. Ten other eyes all focused on the tall Alpha. John looked like he was caught between feeling offended and wanting to crawl into a corner for having offended an Alpha. He stuttered his first words. “I- No. That was not... That,” he mulled the words over in his mouth, feeling ashamed and helpless; something he remembered all too well and didn't want to. “Please, don't.”
He looked mack up at Sherlock, who had moved on to two fingers. John swallowed, his body confused, half-aroused, half-disturbed. It wasn't until Sherlock moaned lowly, that John's mind pushed aside to give room to his desire again.
John released him instantly. Sherlock had his eyes clenched closed, tears running down his cheeks. He was reaching up a hand to feel the source of pain. When he opened his eyes, John was just licking the last traces of blood from his lips. He didn't care for Sherlock's scared look or the way he was holding his pulsating earlobe. All John gave him was a look of content and undisturbed want.
“Because she is an Omega who killed her boyfriends Alpha sister because she blackmailed him. There was no reason for her, an unlikely suspect to the police, to attack another Omega, especially not a stranger.”
He was half-carrying Sherlock again by the time they arrived at Angelo's, but once there, the detective straightened back up – he had a reputation here, no need for emotional displays. Oddly enough, John was absolutely fine with that. He had expected it and it would have had him worried had it been any other way. He found himself smiling brightly as he held the door open for his pregnant mate.
Sherlock himself was panting, clearly working close to the edge now. John gently let his hands roam up to the centre of the globe that was forming on his mate, eyes fixed on the Omega's face now. He dipped a thumb into the indent of Sherlock's navel and he shouted John's name, semen shooting up against his tummy and John's chin.
Mrs Hudson nodded. “His brother helped him get through it, but mind you, there were times when I was worried about that boy. Not that I'm not always worried about him, dashing about, chasing murderers all on his own... No, it's good he has someone he can appreciate to have at the flat now.” she concluded, patting his arm and standing up. “I was just on my way up to feed the little ones when I found you here. Do you want to do it instead now?”
Why, John, why was it so important to look at him right now?! What could possibly be so very urgent that he needed to see his face?! Did he want to humiliate him even more, make fun of him? Take pictures and send them to everyone he knew?
Sherlock didn't even think of looking at the other man like he was. He turned his face into the cushions to hide the screwed up expression his broken mask had left behind.
When there was no protest, however, one slender digit sank in between his cheeks, down until it brushed over John's whole, caressing it while he gasped at the alien touch.
“Not that I could say, nah. Never seen 'em here.” a quick look at John didn't seem to stop her now. “But then, I don't work Mondays 'n' Fridays.”
“That would explain why I constantly seek your sexual attention.” Sherlock mused inching close enough for his breath to caress John's cheek.
that marked John's anger. Instead, he slumped forward into Sherlock's arms, who reflexively embraced him and held him in a hug-like position. Looking down at the head against his chest, he saw the miserable creature that was John Watson. His John. The ever-fighting strong individual; the soldier. He'd never seen him give up on a fight; never seen him broken. Even when he had returned from war, PTSD, tremor and limb on him, he had still held himself strong and proud. Now, here he was: newly bonded, madly in love, expectant father and an emotional wreck.
John was visibly suppressing a smile, trying to play it cool. It was no secret he was fond of Sherlock and liked feeling involved and needed. The Omega had a chronic need to help others. Sherlock was ready to put it to use. “Sure, okay.” John answered eventually and finished his apple. Rosie stretched her hands out for it, but John tapped her bottle. She had no teeth yet and he'd have to blend an apple for it to be edible to her. Besides, they still had a week or two before they would even start ingesting anything other than milk. She had a brief flicker of disappointment on her face, but the movement of his finger fascinated her and she began mimicking him absent-mindedly. When he got up to throw the remainder of his breakfast in the bin, she focused on her hand and a second later she was giggling at the tiny drumming sounds she could make on her tray. With his back to him, Sherlock observing her wasn't something John could see and, while he grinned like the proud father he was, he picked her up. “Now, don't make too much noise, somebody wants to work here.” he said fondly, looking back at the Alpha with an apologetic smile. He wanted to say Sherlock was smiling too, one of his honest smiles, but John didn't trust quick glances like that, especially not when he was in a good mood like this. He saw kind smiles on everyone when he was in this mode. He bounced Rosie on his hip and she giggled happily, but when he was about to set her down to wake and get her siblings for their breakfast, she suddenly started wriggling, her arms flailing in Sherlock's direction. She made an insistent noise and John sighed, straightening back up.
“He's an Omega, for God's sake! Wandering around outside at night, anything could happen to him – being murdered is just the lucky option!” Really, how stupid must a pair of
When they went to bed later that night, Sherlock shuffled close to John like he always did, although this time not with the intention of gaining sex from it. John threw his arm around him happily, kissing him lovingly until sleep was gripping at the pregnant man.
“It's obvious.” he replied, but said nothing more. He loved being a tease like that and John knew that so he didn't ask. They just lay their, holding each other, kissing gently, John's hand on his belly constantly and his own hand joined in a protective caress that soothed both their nerves, eased their minds. It was stupid, but having something to touch strengthened the belief in something going right.
He opened the bag and looked inside it. There were clothes inside, at least 10 different outfits, he estimated as he rifled through them, bent low, one hand against the wall to keep himself from falling over. He turned his head around to talk to Sherlock, but the man had taken to playing his instrument and seemed too deep into it to disturb. John sighed, looking back down at his... present? He grabbed the bag by the straps and lifted it. Unhealthy, he was aware, but he may as well try them on. Only he saw himself in a bit of a predicament when he, once again, faced the stairs leading to 'his' bedroom.
“Of course.” Sherlock frowned. She had been good so far, so he couldn't see how there would be a problem with it now. John seemed surprised by his answer, which made him draw his eyebrows together even more. Had he not been showing his acceptance of their situation? He'd been trying hard to make a point of how he didn't mind the children as much as he'd thought he would. Having them around was not much of a bother, as it turned out they were quiet enough.
“Uh, y-yeah, er, nice to.. meet you.. too.” he stammered in confusion as she walked past him, looking around the flat, but not like it was unfamiliar, but rather like she was searching for someone. After her followed an alpha man, hair just the same pale silver as his wife's, smile just as warm and comforting as hers. Well, as comforting as two strangers walking into his flat could be.
With a raised eyebrow, Sherlock put his attention back to the laptop in front of him and typed. “Thorough look you've had at it, was it?” he said, rolling his eyes as he proceeded to work through any hints he could get. His log in details were saved on Facebook and an Omega flirting site he found in the boy's browser history. “Teenagers are so easy to crack these days. They're hardly even trying to keep anything secret. Here, he has been chatting with someone who calls himself 'DollarDan' on this website and the name reappears in the list of his friends on Facebook – the profile pictures are identical. That pervert promised him the moon and he fell for it. They are both stupid, we don't have to worry about our pups, John. Now, from the email address he's registered with, we can work our way through to his emails and here we have.. that! is exactly what I expected. Isn't that cute, they thought their data would be safer this way – isn't that just adorable, someone should teach them important things at school.” There was a pause in which Sherlock read through the exchanged messages. “They met every so often at a bar in central London, we should go there straight away.” he said and with it, stood quickly, getting dressed.
“Hey, I know you said I could stay here, but I'll do my best to get out as quickly as possible, yeah? You don't have to pretend.”
“Quite right. I suppose you could take John as a role model whilst learning how to be responsible.” the older brother kept picking with the usual arrogance adorning his face.
“As long as you don't expect me to care for them, you can do whatever you like with them. I conduct chemical experiments, however, so make sure they don't touch anything.” Sherlock replied, taking a drag and keeping the smoke in his mouth for a moment before blowing it out the window.
It didn't make any sense. Why drug him to abduct him and then say it wouldn't do to harm him? If whatever had knocked him out hadn't meant a risk to the pups, then that meant there good chemists on board, which left him with the question of why they didn't want to drug him any more now. If it was safe, then why keep him conscious? Was it necessary for him to witness something? Maybe he was supposed to meet this man, to converse with him. After all, for someone who wasn't supposed to talk to him, he'd said rather a lot.
“Say, Sherlock... Are.. Are you actively trying to.. make me come in my pants.. as often as possible?”
Sherlock jerked up at the voice addressing him. Coming up with a fever, he squinted, averting his eyes from the light flooding in from the street and behind the man. “Go away, leave me alone.” he commanded listlessly.
John took a deep, sobering breath and looked at his watch, it had been half an hour; Sherlock never bathed that long.
Lestrade gave them a curious look and Sherlock simply told him “we'll explain in full at a later time, for now, we need to return this child. Oh, and I texted you another address as you were combing through the back of the club. Go there and arrest both the Omega and the Beta.”
“I thought it was obvious by now: I'd do anything for you.” he let the back of his hand brush down the now slightly plumper cheeks. “Surely you must feel it, too. That what reaches deeper, far beyond the flatness of our bond.”
lucky it didn't catch because with four already feeding, that one would probably not have survived or, if it had, you'd be walking bones by now – yes, you would have had to eat even more, love, I know: horrible.” Sherlock answered his sarcastic look with an annoyed one. “Anyway. The amount of hormones, attention and nurturing an Omega receives from their Alpha can also have an influence on the development of the pups. I think you can make the following connection yourself.”
Sherlock didn't know whether or not his emotions translated correctly onto his face – they usually didn't. Most likely, the small smile tugging at Sherlock's lips looked like a completely flat expression to John. “I'll be out in a minute.” he supplied and pushed away from the wall to start shampooing his hair. He heard John close the door and felt his posture sink reflexively. He was always a little tense around the Alpha – a rudiment of behaviour from when he expected John to reject him like everybody else did; internally, he was always calm in John's presence, cradled in the trust for him to stand up for Sherlock when someone was being an idiot. He would need to work on his body's response to his mate. His mate. Good Lord...
Not so John. John, when confronted, had been disbelieving, incredulous, he didn't take Sherlock for such a person because he had stepped into his life when things were going well, considering. He let Sherlock smoke, he was concerned and if he ever found him drugged, he would likely be angry, feel betrayed, but John would not hurt him for it because to John, Sherlock was a grown man, someone to take seriously, who made their own life-choices. Of course, in times like these John would probably hit him and hold him under quarantine if he ever shot up, but he simply wouldn't do that because John was there. John didn't fool him, didn't mock him. John saw him as a man. A man with a story to be told and kept secret. A man with priorities and quirks. A man with a life of his own, with privacy and drama because no one had ever listened to him. John would. That was all he needed – the knowledge that someone who mattered
As soon as he was spent, the Alpha pulled out of him, zipped his trousers and wordlessly left the room. Sherlock threw up as he felt the foreign semen spurt out of him, drenching the mattress. He coughed heavily, choking on the bitter, thick fluid and hung his upper body lifelessly over the side of the bed as it contracted and expelled more of his stomachs few contents.
“Very good, thanks, come on in. Do you like my blouse?” she asked playfully, shaking her shoulders as she walked backwards.
“You probably will until you reclaim me as yours.” As John merely pinched his lips, Sherlock laid a hand on his shoulder, speaking more softly. “We need to get going.”
“Huh, looks like you've got them perfectly under control.” John plopped down beside the Alpha and watched the children as they turned the plushy to face them as they talked to it about something to do with ...pudding? “Really, I'm grateful to you for helping like this. I know this isn't what you wanted when you took me in.”
He turned back to watch himself from the side again. If only he wasn't pregnant, he'd simply stop eating, ignore the hunger, but, no! there was a pup to feed. He looked disgusting! This wasn't 'healthy weight' anymore, this was being overweight!
“That's biological. Especially Omegas release a lot more of the so-called 'happy hormones' during pregnancy to encourage reproduction. A habit that makes you feel good, is a habit that you're prone to keep.”
They chuckled in choir now, faces close. “I didn't say that either. Though I did think it.” He whispered the last bit and closed in.
“Everything you requested is inside the bag. I'll be sure to send 'someone' in to gather more information. Inform me, if you find out
He threw himself over the length of the sofa taking and releasing deep breaths, closing his eyes and trying to slip into relaxation mode as he needed to a lot lately. He felt John's hand caressing up his clothed shin shortly before he lifted both of Sherlock's legs and added his weight to the seating of the couch himself. The Omega's feet and calves found new ground in John's lap, where his soles experienced their first massage and take it from him, John knew what he was doing!
“John! Johnnn!” he moaned. Biting his lips in an attempt to keep quiet, he lay his forehead against John's, looking him in the eyes with the torture of approaching bliss, which arrived just when John's calm expression fell to give way a similar one as Sherlock's.
Sherlock did. He turned around, the motions pressing their mouths together momentarily, making them intensify their efforts noticeably.
John chuckled and spoke more quietly to them. “Sherlock made them for us. So, what are you going to do?”
perfume a proud one, looked up at him in a mix of offence and disapproval. Patronising. “John H Watson, 36, male, Omega Purist,” he read aloud.
He let John know. Of the fear he'd felt for their pups. The day he realised he was becoming thinner again and that his abdomen hadn't changed for a while. He'd eaten everything presented to him, but a meal a day simply wasn't enough for an Omega growing four pups.
“Oh,” Greg said, slowly realising the situation properly, “his parents will be glad to have him back then, such a place..”
He propped up an elbow on the arms of his chair and connected his shaking hand to his forehead, massaging it clumsily. His eyes began to burn suddenly and he fought back the tears drumming against his eyelids.
“All that matters now is that you're back and safe. Everything else we can discuss once you're recovered and home.”
John blushed a little and cleared his throat. “Yeah, um, but- but it wasn't in the.. heat of the moment, as they say..” he confirmed shyly. “We, ah, we talked and, uh, we discussed and we agreed. Kind of.” he stammered, directing his look at Sherlock, searching for help.
John had followed him to the door. “All in due time, Sherlock. You're young, you have time to wait.”
“Everyone else okay with that?” he asked, selecting the book. Emmy agreed, the other two nodded, unaware Sherlock couldn't see that, but he knew either way and started reading a page prior to where John had apparently left it off.
John, who had been drifting out of reality with new information, old information and a certain sleepiness that his pups had less to do with that the past 15 years of his life, shook himself as her words registered and got up hastily. “Oh, er, ta! Thanks for looking after them while I was away, as well. Can't really afford daycare for them yet.” He smiled at her in a mildly apologetic way.
“I say that. Now, calm down, it will be fine. Disabilities are neither an automatic reason for bullying and unhappiness, nor are they necessarily life-threatening. Autism, she speculated. Autism isn't a bad thing.”
“If we're both going to be home all day, we'll be fighting all the time.” John argued, tired of telling Sherlock the same things over and over again.
As the Alpha looked on in shock, Sherlock positioned himself comfortably, but so that John could see what he was doing. On his back, reaching around his belly with both hands, he pushed down his pants, which John helped him discard, and then slid his hands back up what little of his thighs he could still touch, bringing them to his cock. He pumped a few times, massaging his balls to encourage his arousal, then brought one hand down, brushing over his perineum and touching the ring of muscles to his opening. He sighed luxuriously, like he was tasting water the first time after days without a drop.
“We will find our way out. Have a good night, Mr. Holmes, Doctor Watson.” the man said and both he and his quiet assistant shook their hands before leaving.
He got up and walked to the bathroom door. Knocking cautiously, he asked after his mate through the door. “Sherlock? Are you alright in there?”
They looked, and smelled, like a nice elder couple, a tone beneath their conjoined smells that was oddly familiar.
Sherlock took an audible breath at that – you might imagine what he felt. “Good, yes, thank you, Mummy. Now go.” he moved to open the door, a sign for them to leave now, leave fast, thank you very much. It was then, that John really saw where Sherlock got his temper from because mummy clearly wasn't ready to just leave. She insisted on hugs and kisses and for them to visit them soon.
Sherlock's mind wasn't really at ease and he continued to stare at the bloody picture for so long, John eventually just took it from him and lay it aside where it was safe but out of sight for the Omega.
“Funny how you used the plural there. He isn't your wife's biological son, is he?” John was calculating his words like Sherlock hadn't seen him do before. From the first syllable, he was manipulating the conversation in the direction
The Omega looked down at his hands as he began to feel them stirring without his intend. “I want a fix..” he mumbled, more to himself than to anyone else. He felt the desperation travel from his hands to his mind. He'd been vastly underwhelmed with mental tasks lately and his brain was spinning out of control, thoughts washing in; thoughts he'd been trying so hard to shut out.
Now John was laying back, watching, a little anxiously, as Sherlock's head approached his most intimate area.
He, in return opened up expectantly, enjoying the feeling of John's tongue exploring, warm breath against his lips. God, he was already aroused again. Surely that could not be the standard of his life now, could it? Laying in bed for days and marvelling over being kissed, internally begging for more like a pathetic, little, dependent Omega with the need for his Alpha to take care of him, spoil him, toady him like he couldn't take care of himself. The thought alone was revolting enough for him to shove John back and shuffle out of his bed to pad off to the bathroom. John's concerned call he only answered with some mumbling. He didn't follow him, however.
“You caught onto their signs of child neglect, I think, as an Omega, you have an insight to this that the rest of us can't hope to ever achieve.”
At that, Sherlock simply pulled him close and hugged him in unspoken apology and gratitude. “It's beautiful, John.”
“Thanks,” was the DI's reply. Then he decided to start small-talk. “So, how are you two holding up then? John looked a bit exhausted.”
Sherlock merely hummed in confirmation, looking at John loving and longingly, glad they were finally back to their known privacy. John's expression let on much the same and Sherlock leaned down to kiss him passionately. He brought a hand up to cup the Alpha's face to deepen the kiss before John broke it off, a hint of a smile on his lips. “I'm gonna make some tea and prepare a bath, alright?”
Hiyah! I know, this chapter isn't terribly long, but I'm drowning at the mo, so I hope you don't mind too much.. Tell me what you think! Any misspelled words or the likes: /please/ let me know! :)
“Because, John, I'm not in the position to fight anymore and so you will have to take my place!” the detective said in an annoyed manner.
