“Don’t… Don’t go far, alright?” Jo asked, looking a little anxious. “Please? Stay in the courtyard, at least.”
“If you do,” Dean said gently, “I trust you to catch me.”
“Ah, good,” Castiel said. “I haven’t had time to explore much.” He realized that was kind of a stupid thing to say, since this was the first time either of them had been in this place. They’d both been on that boat when they’d dragged the merman up. Alastair had been one of the first to kick at him when he tried to blow all their skulls apart.
He moved forward on wobbly legs, heart in his throat, and approached the dragon. Castiel’s hide radiated heat. Dean was almost afraid he would burn himself when he finally put a hand on the dragon’s scales, but all he felt was a pleasant heat that bordered just on the right side of uncomfortable.
Castiel lifts Dean’s head gently and ties his tie around his hunter’s eyes. He can feel as Dean’s body tenses and relaxes underneath him, a gut reaction to being tied up and rendered blind. Castiel puts a gentle, steadying hand on Dean’s arm, a soothing reminder that he’s safe. After a lifetime of hunting and fighting, it’s no wonder Dean has a reaction to being put in a position where he’s unable to defend himself. Castiel’s whole goal is to make him feel safe and loved, though. The angel hums quietly, pleased, as Dean relaxes.
. He had a bad feeling it was the latter.
Dean sighed, flipping water lightly in the air. “I guess I just need to get used to it,” he said. He shrugged, looking a little embarrassed. “Earlier, when we… Earlier-ah, never mind.”
“’Course. ‘Night, Cas.”
crawl onto my back-“
“You as well,” Castiel replied. “Forget this ever happened. I have a feeling you will not be treated kindly if the others knew of this.”
Regardless of what had happened to bring the event to pass, at some point, Castiel had watched
He moved through the hall to Dean’s bedroom, figuring the Omega might be asleep. But no, the bed was still made and Dean’s duffle bag—the one he’d taken to Castiel’s apartment—was still sitting on it, unpacked. Frowning even deeper, Castiel moved back to the kitchen, and that was where he saw it.
He’s not surprised. He doesn’t have time to be. The second he catches the headlights out of the corner of his eye the grille is already slamming into his door and Dean is spinning.
Charlie’s almost put a hole in her lip with an incisor and she doesn’t look like she’s having much fun anymore. Dean’s hand is really shaking now as he grabs the last biscuit from the stack and slathers it in jam. It wiggles sickeningly in his hand. “Dean, look, I’m sure there’s––there’s definitely something you can do. I’m talking about coding not––not real life and there aren’t mistakes like that, there’s always something you can do––“
“When are you gonna be in the mood, Dean? Tomorrow? Next year?”
Charlie spreads her hands. “I don’t know. Maybe you’re in an interactive puzzle. Maybe there’s some reason why you’re stuck, some mystery you have to solve.”
“Good move,” Bobby says, nodding sagely. Dean hates them both. He tries to sink down into the couch cushions. Maybe they’ll suffocate him and he can reset to the bathroom just to come out and have this whole stupid conversation all over again.
“To be honest, Charlie,” he finally says, “it’s actually been a pretty weird couple of days.”
Oh, this is definitely annoying. “What codeword? Why are you acting like this is totally cool?”
“What the fuck, Sam?” It comes out a little angry, a little demanding, but Dean thinks he’s entitled to a little snappishness. Sam looks at him, eyebrows drawn up in his oh really? face.
“Well, it starts the same. But then I, you know. Just do whatever. It’s Groundhog Day except there’s no rodents.”
“Dean,” Charlie says, and he wonders if her face looks as scared as her voice sounds. “Dean, what are you talking about?”
He hasn’t had enough coffee for this. Maybe he shouldn’t have let the waitress go so quick. He scrubs both hands against his temples, surprised to find they’re trembling. “Okay, so I can just––satisfy this loop, or whatever? Find something to answer the question?”
Dean leans his elbow on the table and whirls his finger in the air in a keep going motion. “C’mon, Professor Lightman. Tell me how to finish War Games. What else could it be?”
“There’s not going to be a tomorrow, Sam,” he tries to explain. The rage is all the way down to his knees and his whole body’s quaking with it. It’s the energy he always tries to dredge up before he goes onstage; ever since he was fifteen and his Dad handed him a guitar and said, c’mon, kid, you play backup for me tonight, huh? and the terror exploded across his body bright and hot as a dying star, he’s thought, this is what it’s supposed to feel like. This is what’s gonna make me good. And it does; his hands never shake when he holds his guitar but they do when he’s washing the sweat off his face in the bathroom afterwards.
“So get this,” Sam starts, at the same time Dean says, “You got the number for animal control on you?”
“Yeah, yeah, I get it. So get a little technical about the loop thing. How can I get out?”
She relaxes. The waitress comes by to ask if they need anything, completely unnoticed by Charlie. Dean shoots her a quick smile to signal that they’re fine. “Well, then you’re not in a causal loop. Nothing ever changes in those. So you still have free will; you can exert control over the outcome of every iteration.” A sigh rushes through him, a breath he hadn’t even known he was holding. “So you’re not in a 12 Monkeys situation or a bootstraps paradox. You are free to move about the cabin.” She pauses. “The cabin is the time loop. Because it’s small and self-contained––“
Ten a.m. Friday rolls around for once. Dean goes to meet Charlie at the Nashville Jam Café, sees her at a table in the corner. She’s cut her hair since he saw her over the summer; she’s half-standing, waving so vigorously she knocks over a glass. When he gets closer she scoots up and wraps her arms tight enough around his waist to bruise, and he scratches his fingers into the back of her head and says “It is really, really good to see you, Charlie.”
He makes his way out, over the pedestrian bridge. He wanders over it slowly. Mostly just people watching. It’s not real crowded at this time of night, this time of year, but he’s far from alone. Mostly college kids, buzzed or drunk off their asses. A few couples, holding hands, maybe trying to finagle a lock with their sharpied initials onto the thick metal beams.
“Actually, Sam.” Bile is crawling up his throat and everything in his face burns and he feels horrible, unfeeling and unloving and undying. “I think I can do whatever the fuck I want these days.”
He takes a gulp of water instead. And then another. And then another. Five minutes ago he was dead. He was dead in the car that’s been his entire life since he turned eighteen and the paramedics were going to have to scrape him out of it with a spatula. He was dead and he felt his bones snap inside him and there was this nasty little jolt that he thinks was his neck cracking clean in half. Sam just watches as he drains the glass. When he sets it back down, his hand is shaking. In the other room Springsteen sings about his runway American dream while Clarence wails on sax.
Of course she perks up like she’s a cocker spaniel and he’s just waved a slice of bacon at her. She swallows and says, “Oh heck yeah, dude. What about them?”
––and then he’s blinking at himself. Staring into the mirror of Sammy’s downstairs bathroom, smooth and unscathed. The LED bulbs buzzing and the faucet gurgling happily into the sink.
“Dean,” she says, urgent all of a sudden. Dean can’t feel his lips. Also his lungs aren’t working. This is a bit much for a panic attack, he thinks, until Charlie is shouting “Dean, Dean, you’re anaphylactic, what are you––you have allergies? I’m calling an ambulance, just––“
But then Sam slid open the door and called out, you get back in that car and run away from this and I’ll kick your sorry ass, so Dean hauled himself up and nursed the same beer for three hours until he just couldn’t keep dodging people anymore. Until the only thought in his head was drive drive drive away and he did the only thing he ever knew how to do, kick the Impala into third gear and tear ass down the highway.
For a while Charlie chatters about how Chicago has been, how boring her new job is, how close she is to getting past the firewalls in the NRA’s server. She asks him a lot of questions––how are you liking city life, is your new place alright, should we go to Hot Topic and get you some cool posters, do you like the guys at the garage, have you been seeing anybody since the breakup and in more than a casual sex way, is Nashville as fun as it looks on TV, do you think you’re going to settle down here––and Dean doesn’t really feel like answering. He just wants to watch her talk, her face so animated and her narrow chin bobbing up and down as she chatters. He just wants to listen to the sound of her voice.
“Doesn’t matter.” The heel of his hand presses hard enough against his eye to see bursts of white. “I’ll see you tomorrow, okay?” And he hangs up on her mid-protest. Turns his phone off, ignoring the dozen missed calls and texts, and crawls under the covers in his Henley and jeans. For a long time, he lays awake. Stares at the ceiling and tries very, very hard not to think about anything at all.
Yeah, no, he’s not doing this. He grabs the phone from her and she makes a whiny little noise of protest. She makes grabby hands for it. “Considering in a couple hours you’re not even gonna remember this conversation, I think I’m the one who should get the answers here. Where the hell did this loop come from?”
For a moment he doesn’t speak. Now, for some reason, right this moment, it hits him: the stupid, absurd, awful gravity of what’s happening. Suddenly it’s not a joke; he died in that car crash and when that dog bit his throat out and when he fell down that hole in the ground. “Oh,” he says, and the sound he makes almost passes for a chuckle. That burning is back behind his eyes. He died and he’s going to die again, and no one in his godforsaken life seems to know how to stop it. Blueberry/thyme/pine nut jam doesn’t seem so fucking scary after all.
“Seriously, kid, what’s the matter with you? I ain’t seen you flirt with even one of Sam’s cute paralegal friends. I’m startin’ to worry.”
It’s some kind of––of mental hiccup. Or something. All he knows is he’s not getting behind the wheel for the rest of the night so he shoves his hands in his pockets and walks over an hour from Sam’s place in West End Park to his apartment. It’s not an apartment so much as it is one mostly renovated room above a garage. His bed is tucked into an alcove across from the kitchenette and the walls are striped in varying shades of off-white from the paint job his landlord never finished. It’s kind of a shithole, which makes Dean feel better about the whole thing. He hasn’t had a mailing address since he was about four years old. Having one now makes him feel like he’s up onstage forgetting the chords to the song he’s supposed to be playing. Like he’s stumbling through some performance he hadn’t realized he wasn’t ready for.
He’s parked by the Riverfront bus stop, forehead against the wheel. Now his dad is dead, and he is too, and there doesn’t seem to be anything he can do about either of those things.
“What’s the difference?”
“This is your problem,” Sam says. Dean still doesn’t open his eyes. He doesn’t have to for him to know Sam is pointing an accusing finger at his nose. “You are so terminally fucking negative.”
“Uh, Charlie,” he says. Rubs the back of his hand over his eyes. “Not to sound a little––but, um. Didn’t we already talk about this?”
“No, that’s not––I didn’t––” and Dean immediately feels like shit, because god, of course he wouldn’t. “I’m just––I’m kinda freaking out here, man. Because I was just in the car, or I could have sworn I was, because you were honestly, no offense, kinda pissing me off with the whole trying to get me to have a good time thing, and Bobby kept clapping me on the shoulder and not saying anything mean, and there’s a lot of people here wishing me a happy birthday and most of them I don’t even know because they’re your friends you invited, so I just wanted a breather and I was headed out to clear my head, and then all of a sudden––”
There’s almost no space on the table under the twelve pots of jam Charlie wanted to sample, crowded together in little glass jars in varying levels of gourmet pretentiousness. There’s a sickly bruise-purple blueberry/thyme/pine nut concoction he’s actually a little afraid of. Never in his life has he eaten a pine nut, and now doesn’t seem like the time to branch out.
“I really don’t know what you want from me,” he snaps. “You come to California when I’m sick, you don’t leave no matter how much I tell you to fuck off, you drag my sorry ass to rehab twice––and then you move to Nashville to be near me? And you get an actual big boy job instead of playing gigs at every roadside bar in America? So I thought you wanted to be here, and I thought maybe you wanted to settle down––so why are you so pissed? Why are you acting like it’s some unholy violation that Bobby and Ellen and Jo came down? That I invited some people over? You think you’re inconveniencing them by having a birthday?”
He cruises through the heart of the city for a while, just driving aimlessly. Drunk people stumble through the streets and his window is rolled down so he can catch flashes of music from the bars he passes. Trumpets wail into banjos which twang into thumping bass along one street. He still doesn’t know if he actually likes this city––it’s crowded and chintzy and the traffic is just the fucking worst––but he loves the music. Whenever he’s feeling a little too inside himself he can head out to any of the hundreds of bars or clubs, can pay a few bucks’ cover and slip inside and disappear into it. When he was real little, in the years after Mom died and it was just him and Sammy in the backseat of the Impala on long stretches of highway for days at a time, he used to get wound so tight that it was like his body was just one big knot. But when they stopped for the night, when he carried a sleeping Sammy into the motel room and Dad turned on the radio or strummed his guitar––the sound worked through him in waves, loosened him up. He’d lay on his stomach with his arms under his cheek to protect it from cheap, scratchy carpet, and he’d just watch his dad. Watch his big hands scribble lyrics and chords in his notebook. Watch his thick fingers flick over the strings, coaxing out sounds Dean would try to replicate as soon as he was alone with the guitar. He wouldn’t want to close his eyes, afraid to miss one of these moments where he could be close to John and actually feel close. He fell asleep like that more than once, and he’d wake up curled next to his brother in bed and his dad slinging whiskey and muttering to himself about rhyme schemes well into the morning.
“There’s nothing wrong with you,” Castiel said gently. “What would make you feel better right now?”
Underneath the crashing boom of the fireworks all around them, Dean whispered, “You’re so beautiful.”
“Settle down, boys. We still have some Angels to slaughter,” Azazel said once the laughter had died a little. “C’mon, Asmodeus. You’re blocking the way.”
“That is… surprisingly intellectual,” he admitted. “I suppose I should have expected no less from you. Humans are remarkably good at figuring out ways to kill other creatures without having to use strength or their own selves.”
Eventually, somewhere near midnight, Castiel rolled over and closed his eyes. It wasn’t long before he’d joined Dean in sleep.
, Cas.
Dean wanted to tell him to fuck off, but this was getting weird now. He simply ignored the other Alpha, hoping he’d leave him alone. Those hopes were dashed when he went to wipe down the countertop and suddenly found a large, clammy hand gripping his wrist in a bruising grip.
He rose up, flicking his fins as best he could to turn himself around and present his back and tail to the doctor. He didn’t trust the guy, not really, and the survivor in him was screaming at him for taking his eyes off the enemy. Dean was fucking tired of trying to understand and sound out English, though. He was done with this conversation.
“Why?” Dean asked, frowning.
Castiel stared in disbelief as his co-captain stalked off toward the locker room. The nearby underclassmen were staring at him with eyes as wide as saucers, shocked to see their beloved senior captains so upset and unprofessional. The rage in Castiel’s chest was slowly beginning to drain away, especially as he stared at Benny’s discarded swim cap. In its place, shame and anxiety slipped in, curling in a dark, ugly coil in Castiel’s gut. He looked back over at the other side of the pool instinctively and found Dean looking back at him.
“Dean, look!” Castiel smiled as he held up three bars of candy, handing two of them to Dean. “Someone threw the Snickers right at my face!” He smiled and pointed to a red mark on his forehead. For some reason, that was the funniest thing Dean had seen in a while. He threw his head back and laughed.
This had all panned out to be much more complicated than he’d thought. He’d been prepared for six months of researching and getting to know the subject and its culture. This, all of this, felt
Dean eyed him. “Oh, so I’m in love you now, is that it?”
He reached down between Dean’s legs, feeling at his husband’s trembling hand before locating his hole and pushing his finger inside right alongside Dean’s. Dean released a long, loud moan at the sensation.
Castiel stopped the motor somewhere far enough that the beach was only a sliver of color on the horizon. He had a little battery that he could use to charge the motor if need be, but he wasn’t really afraid of getting stuck out on the water. Somehow, nothing about it scared him. Not even the possible thunderclouds on the horizon.
His eyes rolled up into his head halfway to the ground, and he knew no more.
He froze up for half a second, fear making his eyes go wide, and that was all the opening Luke needed.
His eyes were aching with the kind of exhaustion that could only be achieved by getting about six hours of sleep in three days. This last hunt had been brutal. Dean wished he’d had backup, but with Sam on a hiking trip with Eileen in the mountains and Jack and Castiel busy getting the last of Heaven in order, Dean hadn’t been able to get any help. Well, no. Scratch that. He hadn’t had the balls to admit that he’d
Mwahahaha. Welcome to the Speed ROLLERCOASTER, bitches!
“Uh, thanks, Cas,” Dean managed to choke out. He tried for a grin, praying it didn’t look as dopey as he felt. “Did... Did you, uh... Did you break your record?”
“I suppose,” he admitted, unable to remain angry when Dean was smiling at him like that. “Don’t think I’ll forget about this. I’d like to make it up to you.” The Alpha frowned, considering that. “Perhaps I could cook you something that
He sighed aloud as the intro started. He wished Dean was here right now.
way, not yours, understood?
“Your tail is absolutely incredible,” he said from behind Dean. His voice sounded distant and watery through the far-up opening at the top of Dean’s tank. “The way your fins move is breathtaking. Tell me, how long does it take younglings to learn to swim?”
Dean felt a sudden ache in his chest, a longing for Castiel. He wished the dragon were standing beside him. Even if Castiel wasn’t able to save him, Dean still wanted to be held by him, with his strong arms and warm wings. He missed Castiel. He wished he’d been able to apologize to him before he died.
“I wanna go back down now. Cas,
The two Growlers communicated with Tower, negotiating their landing. Dean pulled back on the throttle a little as he came to the end of his pattern, waiting for a break in the action before he could ask for permission to land again. When the channel quieted as the two Growlers switched over to Ground, Dean spoke up.
Michael was silent for a moment, eyes narrowing slightly as he thought deeply about the question. After a period of tense silence, he stepped out of the shadows and gestured at Alfie. “You’re dismissed. Do not speak a word of what you’ve heard in this room or I’ll have your tongue, understood?”
In the… in the wind.
Castiel frowned as well, his face mirroring Dean’s. “What could you possibly mean by that?” he asked. “I hope you’re not questioning my devotion to you. T-To your health, I mean.”
Castiel sat, frozen, barely daring to move. His heart was pounding hard enough for him to see it on the edges of his vision.
Castiel wanted to snap at him, ask him what the hell he thought he was going to do with a simple phone number, but he decided against it. Gabriel wasn’t who he was mad at, anyway. Dean wasn’t either, but he wasn’t feeling like apologizing to Dean just yet. He’d go home and stew first.
By the way, it is TOTALLY possible to be terrible at cooking but fantastic at baking. I have no idea how, but if you think it's not true, tell that to my partner who can bake a fantastic pie but can't grill salmon to save his life. It's freaking ridiculous.
Anyway, it’s a good thing Sam’s got going here. Renting a whole house for cheap, new legal aid gig where he gets to save kids and lock up abusive assholes. Dean feels so wrong inside of it, like a b natural honking out of tune in the middle of Come Together. That had happened once, years ago, when he was playing the bass with Dad at some bar. His finger slipped and someone laughed and Dean had spent the rest of the night with his guts in a knot while his dad refused to look at him. He feels like that now, every day. Even the ones before the loop. Like he’s just waiting for something to snap, for the other shoe to drop right on his head. And now, he guesses, it finally has.
Dean would laugh if the rage in his chest wasn’t unfurling out through his hands. He digs his fingernails into the wood and doesn’t realize he’s speaking until the words are out of his mouth. “I don’t want this. I don’t want this to be happening.”
Dean stares at him, open mouthed. Sam takes a swig of his cream soda and looks out over everyone’s heads, nodding absentmindedly along to the Three Dog Night song Dean had queued up earlier. He looks completely unrattled. Hair combed and brushing his collar, brows knitted in a little when he sees Bobby pick up one of his artisan pots from New Mexico to check for a price tag on the bottom. He looks––the same, the same as earlier, the same as when people started milling in for this stupid birthday party Dean didn’t want but Sam did so that was that. The same as the first time he mentioned Mrs. Chambers and her granddaughter (who Dean’s talked to Mrs. Chambers about before and who’s just about a decade too young for Dean, thank you) and he saw Bobby pick up the vase and it’s freaking Dean out more than he has the words to describe.
“You got any special computer nerd thoughts on the subject of time loops?”
Of course, he doesn’t see her tomorrow. At first light he thinks he might make it; the sun is reassuring, makes him feel like he’s woken up from some bad dream. But then he gets downstairs and realizes Baby’s still parked in Sam’s driveway and he’s hoofing it. This is fine, he tells himself. This is normal. Cars are rumbling down the street and hungover bridesmaids are squinting through sunglasses outside their hotels and are birds soaring above him and this is just a normal Friday morning after a normal Thursday night in the completely unremarkably normal life of Dean Winchester. He’s almost halfway to believing it, too, when his foot drops into empty space where the manhole cover should be.
The jam’s as bad as he thought it would be, sweet and salty in a way that just doesn’t do it for him. He forces himself to swallow, heart hammering in his chest and heat exploding across his cheeks and the back of his neck. “Listen, Charlie, it’s fine. It’s really fine. I’m gonna figure it out.” He tries to shoot her a sunny grin; Charlie’s gone a little hazy so he’s not sure if he’s successful or not.
Dean shuts his eyes. Sucks in one short breath, lets it out in a rush through his nose. “Don’t start this with me tonight. I’m not in the mood.”
“You should go take care of your vase,” Dean blurts, and Sam squints until there’s a shatter and a groan and a hiss of just shove it under the couch and Sam is up in a flash yelling “That better not be that vase that was on the sideboard, that’s an authentic Hopi healing pot––” and Dean takes that as his cue to slip out the back door and down the steps.
“Stop, stop.” There are gouges in the wood where he’s gripping. It’s okay, he thinks; they won’t be there tomorrow. Or whatever passes for tomorrow. “Just––stop. I’ve already heard it.”
“Yeah, yeah.” He rubs the back of his neck. Glances around the restaurant but no one is paying attention to their conversation. Not that it would matter if they did, he thinks. “Well, let’s say that you’re stuck in one. A real you-die-and-wake-up-four-hours-earlier-in-your-little-brother’s-bathroom sort of time loop. What would cause that? And how would you get out?”
“Okay okay okay,” Sam interrupts, and he’s making his real concerned face now, the one that’s just a little too scared for Dean’s liking. He grips him by the shoulder and steers him down the hall into the kitchen where it’s a little quieter. “Let’s get you some water, yeah?”
They just won’t leave. Something hot and snarling mad is waking up in Dean’s chest. In a few seconds it’s going to be fully alert, sniffing the air for blood it can draw; Dean’s legs stretch and he’s standing, lumbering into the kitchen and out the sliding door, slamming it shut with enough force to let the people milling around in there know to mind their own business.
“Oh my god.” Charlie rocks back in her chair. She claps her hands together, looking inappropriately delighted. Dean scowls at her. “How many iterations have you done? How many times have we had this conversation? Have I given you the codeword yet?”
Dean doesn’t realize his head is in his hands until his phone rings and he has to lower one to dig it out of his pocket to answer. Half-past eleven; he doesn’t even look at the name on the screen when he answers, “Hey, Charlie.”
“You get this idjit talking yet?” he asks Jo, nudging Dean’s leg with his foot.
“So get this,” he hears a moment before his brother’s hand is slipping a fresh beer bottle into his own and leaning in to talk over the talk and the laughter and the music. “Mrs. Chambers is here and she’s grilling me about why the birthday boy’s been hiding all night instead of mingling with her granddaughter who’s visiting from Austin, and who she mentioned, several times, is very pretty and very single.”
“They’re snacks I brought to last year’s State,” Castiel explained. “They really are very delicious. They’re not very hard to get online, either, so they’re a far better alternative than having to speak to that demoness.” He shuddered at the mere thought.
There was no hiding the heat that rose to Dean’s cheeks then. He swallowed thickly, fighting past the sudden heaviness of his tongue in his mouth. “Okay,” he managed.
Castiel knew he wasn’t the only one who was tired of this war. It had been going on for more than eight hundred years, and it seemed endless. Neither side seemed to want to back down. The dragons were beginning to say that the War on Syphon would only end when one side went extinct. It was a horrifying thing to think of.
“You’re dating, right?” Benny asked, frowning back.
Dean swallowed, looking down and away, at the bathroom floor over the edge of the tub. “You think you’re gonna find them?”
. At worst...
Leaving his apartment that night felt like a breath of fresh air. Castiel took the rooftops as his route, all too happy to stretch his legs a little. He found himself on the roof of a building opposite Purgatory at the end of his journey, his heart rate pleasantly fast. Castiel breathed in cool night air, kneeling on the edge of the roof he’d perched on so he could frown at the diner.
Dean turned his head and found a pretty brunette standing next to him. She wore the uniform of a healer, her dark hair tied back in a neat ponytail. She smiled at him, her eyes flicking once to the dragon sleeping at his side.
Suddenly, everything sort of made sense. Castiel could have smacked himself for how obvious the answer seemed. Dean was right outside the Bunker, kneeling in the location that Castiel had begun to see as his garden. The angel frowned as he probed a little at Dean’s soul, disliking the way the normally vibrant gold of it was dulled. It seemed his hunter wasn’t feeling well. Perhaps that was why he’d left the bed without any warning and gone to work on Castiel’s garden at six in the morning.
The answer literally came to them. Like, it flew over the mountains and landed just outside the walls, tucking three sets of wings behind its back.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean squeezed his eyes shut, trying not to remember what had happened down in that chamber. His jeans were still sticky with the spew of Alastair’s blood. God, the
“Perfect,” Michael choked out, voice brittle and paper-thin. “Fucking perfect.” He put down his half-eaten sandwich and left the room without another word.
, actually. It was as baffling as it was intriguing.
“C’mon, Novak,” Benny said, patting his co-captain on the shoulder. “Cool it, yeah? We’re almost done.” He gave Castiel the trademark Benny smile that made it hard to be angry at him no matter
Castiel got up and turned off the TV. He walked past the kitchen, walked past Dean still crunching on his carrot, and headed to his bedroom. He had a suit somewhere in his closet that he could wear. He had a few, actually. He didn’t really care which one he pulled out. He didn’t know the Greek restaurant Arthur was taking him to, only that it was on the nice side of town and Castiel would feel like an idiot if he didn’t wear something fancy.
high, you know? I’ve always been told that’s dragon territory.”
He forced himself to take a deep breath, to calm the unusual fire burning in his chest. He’d promised himself something. He had to carry that out.
“I know,” Castiel replied heavily. “I just... it’s the anniversary. I had to do
Castiel watched as the ‘open’ sign clicked off at precisely ten o’clock, the last of the patrons leaving soon after. He’d observed a few low-level criminals coming and going throughout the day, but no one major. Everyone leaving currently looked to be normal civilians.
Dean wanted to shout back that he was fine, but then he realized that Castiel was right. The waters would be rough and unstable until they got past where the waves were breaking. Even Dean, a strong swimmer and someone who’d lived in the water all his life, knew better than to trust the night tides. If he tried to swim out now, he could very well end up bashed against some jagged rock, previously invisible in the dark waters.
Gods, Dean was so close. He was right in front of Castiel’s face, mere feet from the dragon’s snout. Castiel focused all of his being on the unconscious human right in front of him, on the space that was gradually getting lesser and lesser between them.
Dean was screwed either way.
Castiel ducked underneath a rock spire, banking toward the mountains. He hoped to lose Ishim in the twisting canyons and narrow passes of the Ryuu mountains. Maybe they’d have a chance at outmaneuvering him. At the most, it would buy Castiel time to think of a way to get out of this.
Sam sighs and spreads his legs out wider so he can rest his forearms on the counter. He does his Therapist Hands, cupping them together and using them to punctuate every sentence. “Look, I’m really sorry if I overstepped and you’re really not comfortable with this whole party thing.” Ellen’s in the living room saying, yeah, Jo, get your ass over here, and Jo is shaking her head with a smile. “I just wanted to do something nice for you. In three decades you’ve never had an actual birthday party. And now that things are finally somewhere approaching the neighborhood of normal, I thought it was time.” Dean’s staring at his brother’s face but he’s supposed to be sunk on Sam’s IKEA loveseat watching Ellen pump her and Jo’s arms back and forth while Bobby snorts in disapproval and Rufus from down the street talks at him about bullhead trout. But now he’s shaking in the kitchen while his brother gives him puppy eyes and says “I know how hard it’s been, and I sure haven’t made it any easier on you the past few years. I just want you to feel okay celebrating, Dean. Even if it’s just for tonight.”
Dean ran. He got all the way down the tower, made it all the way to the corridor right outside, before Azazel burned it to the ground.
Dean wanted to argue that he
Castiel snarled, putting as much thunder as he could in the noise. His wings flared again, battering at the confines of the net. It didn’t seem to even strain as it kept him contained. Panic was beginning to slither through Castiel’s veins. He couldn’t open his wings, couldn’t shift, couldn’t escape. It sent his heart thudding wildly.
After a moment, the dark-haired swim captain spoke again, voice quiet and thoughtful.
Dean was moving around the kitchen, cooking what looked to be bacon and eggs in a pan. Castiel stood in the entrance and watched him for a moment, too tired to form physical words.
For a moment, Castiel allowed himself to imagine where the prince was. Dean was probably asleep somewhere, perhaps curled up in a bed at the village. His green eyes would be closed, his freckled cheeks flushed with the warmth of human sleep, his plush lips parted slightly. He was beautiful.
It was actually kind of endearing, the way Castiel snarled at every new person to enter the room. If Dean wasn’t so annoyed because he constantly had to apologize and try to calm the person down, he would have been touched by the protectiveness Castiel seemed to retain for him. The dragon hadn’t left his side — or his bed — since he’d woken.
Castiel laughed, gummy smile and bright eyes and dimples and all. He hugged Dean hard, his arms warm and strong around Dean’s shoulders. “You can do this,” he said into Dean’s ear. “I believe in you.”
Castiel swallowed. “Goodbye, Dean.”
“Okay,” Castiel agreed after only a moment of hesitation. He tossed the notebook aside, uncaring of where it landed. This was too fascinating for him to pass up. “Tell me about what you hunt.”
“Whidbey Tower, this is Hunter zero-five-bravo, requesting landing again,” he said. He tried to keep his voice neutral and calm. It wasn’t anyone’s fault that he was late, really. Shit just
Through the rain-streaked window of the cockpit, Dean could see the lights of Washington’s coast flying past beneath his jet. He’d been following the coastline for a little over an hour, his flight path outlined in a highlighter on the map strapped to his lapboard. Dean had already negotiated an approach with Seattle Center. He was getting close to his destination.
he shouldn’t be putting himself in unnecessary danger. The difference was small, but vitally important.
“He’s gonna be mad,” Dean repeated. “I gotta go.” He’d closed his eyes, his head swimming. He was going to puke up every drop of the tea he’d just drank, but he took another sip just to soothe his aching throat.
“It’s... Novak,” Castiel corrected distantly, eyes wide and shocked. He
“Of course,” Castiel replied, shaking out his newly-human shoulders. “Why wouldn’t they?”
“We need to take the gun,” Dean said as Castiel turned around and began to hastily unlock the restraints. When Dean was free, the doctor hesitated, turning to look at Alastair’s unconscious body. Dean saw him look and winced. “Cas, he’ll be fine. It’s not like the booms are real. He’ll be found later.”
“Yeah. He had an interesting tattoo,” Dean said. He knew he could just come out and say he’d talked to a Demon, but he didn’t think Castiel would appreciate talking about such sensitive things in the setting they were in.
“Bet I could,” Cam argued, grinning. “What’ll ya give me if I do, Novak?”
“You think we can do this?” Dean whispered, more into Castiel’s hoodie than to the boy himself.
“Dean, I... I want you to know that it’s not about you, it’s—”
“Guessing you heard that, then?” Dean asked bitterly, voice smaller and shakier than he’d intended. He gripped the edges of the towel tightly. When he inhaled, he realized it smelled like something sweet and earthy. Like... Like Castiel’s hair when it got wet. The other boy had given him his towel?
“Okay,” Dean said, sounding content with that plan. “And then after, we can use those seeds I bought you and plant that stuff in your garden, right? D’you wanna do that?”
Purgatory.
thing—”
The idea of the precious human beside Castiel being burned to a crisp made him angry. He still had yet to get rid of the churning anger deep in his gut. It had settled in the face of worrying for Dean and being grateful for his health, but it was still there. It reminded Castiel of the way the man had laughed when Dean had collapsed, of the little sobs of pain the prince had been emitting as he’d been whipped mercilessly.
turned to look at him. Dean’s vision was too blurry by now for him to make out his angel’s expression, but he would bet twenty bucks Castiel was
“Maybe,” Dean replied. He ground down tentatively, causing them both to moan as their dicks rubbed together again.
And they were about to go a lot higher.
Castiel looked up at him, broken from his spiral of thought, and quirked a small smile. “I’m pleased to hear you enjoyed it. I could get you more, if you’d like. Because of the... For more information, of course.”
“Yes, Dean?” Castiel asked over his shoulder. He was attempting to sort berries, frowning at the different variations and colors with an intensity that was nearly comical.
. When did this happen? Are you alright?” His hold on Dean’s forearm was gentle but firm. Any other time, Dean might have been panicking because of the warm scrape of Castiel’s calloused hands against his skin. Right now, though, he was panicking for an entirely different reason.
, Dean hated disappointing people.
There was a quiet rushing noise, and Dean squeezed his eyes shut as brush of air caressed his cheek. It smelled of cold mountain air, momentarily clearing away the stench of rotted bodies and rusted metal away. Dean nearly sobbed at that, so starved for freedom and sunlight he was practically insane.
He’d expected swearing, screaming, threatening, but not... this. This strange, beautiful young man was just eating his sandwich like there wasn’t a murderer standing in his apartment with a gun leveled at his forehead. Castiel had blood all over him, for God’s sake. It sounded as if the entire Lawrence police force was out, screaming down the streets in search of Castiel and his brothers.
Castiel considered. Not much, if he was being honest. He was outnumbered. The men looked to be stronger than him in every regard, and they had weapons. Long-range weapons.
Castiel frowned. “Maybe they should come over here so we can practice relay starts. We haven’t seen much of each other.” Their relay hadn’t qualified for State, but they’d definitely qualified for Districts. They were swimming tomorrow. They needed to practice.
Yes, these would have to do. Nodding to himself, Clyde looked back at Dean’s grumpy form on the bed and shook his head slightly. The idiot was still moping. A scan of the other room showed that Castiel was doing the same thing. Clyde would need to be pretty blunt to get anything through these two idiots’ thick skulls. It was time to take some drastic measures.
Besides, she’d saved Dean. He suspected he would always feel indebted to her for that.
Castiel wasn’t sure how much his shouting had registered, but he was fairly sure that the door slamming had been loud. He looked up, searching and listening for any indication that Dean might have woken, but his friend still seemed to be sound asleep. That was good. The last thing Castiel wanted was to have this conversation right now.
To refuse an opponent the opportunity to fight in such a way was seen as dishonorable. Ishim was essentially bringing a sword to a fistfight. Fire was destructive and violent. It often led to both participants being hurt in some way, even the firebringer themselves. Very rarely did both dragons survive. It seemed that now, Ishim wasn’t fucking around either. He was willing to debase his own honor in favor of ending Castiel quickly and painfully.
Thank you for reading. I hope to see you soon with another long one! We'll see where my muse takes me. ;)
He’d felt the exact same way when he was little, too. He’d never imagined it would be like this.
telling you, so play by my rules.”
that Dean’s left knee was hurting, and that it was likely an ACL strain because of the way he seemed to favor it when he bent and unbent it. He didn’t want to unsettle Dean, though, so he stayed quiet and let him reply.
Dean looked at his mark, wondering who his Alpha was. What did they look like? Would they like him? What was their gender? Who were they? Would he ever see them again? Wasn’t there supposed to be some sort of an electric spark, some sort of indication that they’d
“Okay,” Dean said, sounding considerably more amused than before. “Okay, angel. Fine.”
Castiel frowned deeper. “I asked you to tell me when you were uncomfortable. You did so. I… I appreciate that, Dean.” He gave the prince a warm smile, which sent all sorts of flutters exploding in Dean’s chest. “Was there a particular reason you wanted to go back down? Other than that I went way higher and farther than I told you I would, of course.” He frowned. "I'm very sorry about that."
Castiel pauses, considering Dean’s request. “I’ll keep you blindfolded when I’m pleasuring you,” he decides. He wants Dean to feel everything, wants his every sense to be heightened without his sight. “I’ll take it off when you’ve orgasmed, though. Does that sound okay?”
The response, thankfully, was prompt. “Hunter zero-five-bravo, you’re cleared to land at runway one-four left, over,” the comms told him. Dean breathed a soft sigh of relief.
Castiel launched into the air.
Castiel nodded, smiling at the thought. “The Himalayas are breathtaking. I would love to see them someday too.”
“Something new,” Castiel replied tiredly. “Gabriel calls it a ‘brookie.’ It’s a brownie and a cookie mixed together. I don’t know how it’s going to turn out.” He glanced back at the oven, where the supposed ‘brookie’ was likely baking.
Pushing inside Dean was glorious. His husband was all fever heat and silky skin and glorious pressure. Castiel released an unrestrained moan of primal pleasure as he seated himself inside Dean’s body, his fingers digging hard into the supple muscle of Dean’s hips. Dean gave a broken moan, baring the gorgeous golden arch of his neck as he tossed his head back in pleasure.
“I miss you,” his Alpha finally said, a whisper in the darkness. “I never see you anymore and I hate it.” His voice was tight, choked with tears that he was obviously trying to suppress. Castiel didn't dare interrupt him, knowing how hard it was for his Alpha to express how he was feeling sometimes.
was, but it made Castiel happy, so he was fine with it.
Instead of leaving, Castiel sat down right beside Dean and began rubbing his back again. Through Dean’s clothes and the two blankets, it was almost impossible to feel his hand. Dean focused on it anyway, tethering his mind to the task of discerning where Castiel’s hand was on its path up and down his back.
There was nothing before him but darkness and swirling wind. He hadn’t expected anything more.
, but he couldn’t speak. Those words,
Castiel knew that Dean had grown up in motel rooms. Dean had told him multiple times that he didn’t care where he slept, as long as he got some sleep. Castiel knew that Dean wanted the hotel room for him, because for some reason, his friend had gotten it into his head that Castiel needed to be babied when it came to traveling. Castiel was more than happy with wherever they laid their heads, as long as Dean was there.
If I haven't scared you off yet, read on! And if you need more detailed trigger warnings, please see the end of the chapter notes. :)
Dean finished his postflight checks, nodded an exhausted thanks to the ground guys he passed, and headed to the main building to grab his stuff from a locker.
Dean started to sing, and everything else sort of faded away.
“Okay. Uh, ‘night. Again.”
“Uh… I—”
Dean gave Castiel a small smile, green gaze clear and bright for just a moment. He looked into Castiel’s eyes, light flickering in the gold depths of his green irises. “I love you too, Cas,” Dean rasped out. His voice broke halfway through, but it was still the most beautiful thing Castiel had ever heard. The dragon kissed his human tenderly on the forehead. Just before he pulled away, he heard Dean’s whisper. “You caught me.”
Dean sucked in a trembling breath. “I’m sorry,” he said, looking up through teary eyes. “I s-swear, Michael, that wasn’t what I wanted to do. I swear to God, I wouldn’t try to embarrass you. I just wanted to—”
“Wow,” Dean muttered.
, Dean wanted to say. Or maybe,
“’Course,
“They won’t,” Michael said grimly. “If there’s one thing I know about the Prince brothers, it’s that they like to play with their toys.” They both shuddered in revulsion, likely thinking of Gadreel. He still hadn’t spoken a word since his rescue. His mind had been fractured.
, though, and Dean realized with a sinking feeling in his gut that Castiel and his brothers didn’t know it.
The rest of the day went well. Customers came and went. Garth appeared in the afternoon to take over for Benny. Dean was working a double-shift, so no one came to relieve him. He didn’t mind. He helped close up, then waved goodbye to everyone and headed to the parking lot. He was exhausted, but happy. Dean whistled all the way to the car, climbed in, and grabbed his phone. He’d just opened the texting app to ask Cas if he wanted to go to dinner or something for fun when a notification beeped at him.
“Fish,” Alastair breathed.
…” He smiled.
Jo turned and hurried over to a large metal trapdoor near the cabinets on the far wall. Castiel watched as she opened the trapdoor and yanked up a bucket of ice. He reflected, distantly, that keeping the ice trapped in an insulated, buried compartment was genius.
“Who the hell are you?” Dean asked. The only reason he wasn’t more afraid was because the man was wearing a dark, shell-like jacket, just like Castiel’s. An Angel. He had similar blue eyes, though his were icier and... colder.
Castiel chuckled, kissing his temple. “I know.”
Dean snorted. “It’s not the first time, Benny. Well, at least not the first time he’s beaten me.” Dean’s words stuck in his throat, hard to admit even after all this time and all that had happened. “He’s… uh, he’s kinda always done that.”
Dean laughed at the idea of his straight-laced, follow-the-rules, read-the-Terms-of-Agreement best friend throwing eggs on the sidewalk and not cleaning them up. “That’s fuckin’ hilarious. What else did you do?”
“Whatever you say, darling,” Balthazar smirked.
As March turned to April, spring began to shift to summer. The anxiety and agitation that every college student felt during finals week was beginning to creep up on everyone. Castiel coped by baking new and random things that he and Gabriel came up with and writing vigorously, sometimes into the early morning. Dean coped by cleaning nearly everything in sight and being extra snappy when he hadn’t had his coffee in the mornings.
Dean smiled. “I can’t wait.” There was no trace of flirtatiousness in his tone. He was dead serious.
Dean was glad he’d agreed to become Castiel’s roommate. He didn’t think he could imagine anyone better. They’d been best friends for about a year and a half before Michael had entered the picture.
Castiel frowned, not missing the self-deprecating ‘for once’ in that sentence. “What do you mean by that? And what is this ‘useful’ thing? Why are you outside, barely dressed, so early in the morning?” Castiel once again resisted the urge to simply ask,
People come and people go. Dean wonders if Sam’s still pissed at him. Wonders if he’ll be pissed at Dean tomorrow, or whatever passes for tomorrow, and not even know why. Wonders if maybe he really did die in that car crash and now he’s just in hell, reliving one shitty night of his life for the rest of eternity. He pitches his head back to look at the stars through the metal lattice of the bridge. Asks the universe––the Universe the way Sam talks about it, this sweeping, sentient cosmic force––why it wants to watch him suffer. And he’s not proud of it, but he prays. Scrunches out his face real tight and says, God, or anyone, if you’re out there, I know I ain’t been too good thus far with the smoking and the drinking and the lying and the fornicating and the not paying taxes. But I swear, if you let me out of this, I’ll be good, I’ll buy a house and move to the suburbs and I’ll be better to Sam and I’ll call Bobby more just to check in. If you please just send me something, something good.
“I don’t do open mics,” he argues, even though he absolutely does do open mics––because it’s Nashville, it’s almost weird if you don’t go out and do sad little shows to eight drunk people on a weeknight––and then Bobby comes over, perches awkwardly on the arm of the couch.
Spoons and forks rattle and as her hands slap against the table. She leans forward, eyes almost cartoonishly wide. “Dean Winchester, are you telling me that you’re currently enclosed in a temporal loop right now?”
“Well, it’s a pretty big trope in video games––actually a lot of scholars say one of the reasons they’re getting more popular culture is because they’re so close to interactive media. Just like in a video game, you’ve got a character who has to move through the same environment over and over again until they master it and they can move on.”
“What the fuck what, Dean?”
Sam huffs and makes his you’re acting like such a child unlike me, an adult man face. “I think thirty-two’s a little old to be throwing hissy fits on your birthday, man.” Dean just gapes at him some more while the song changes to I Don’t Wanna Know by Fleetwood Mac, and Dean knows the next one is going to be Creedence, and the next one is going to be Springsteen, and Ellen’s going to get a little too into Born to Run and try to get Jo to swing dance with her and the vase Bobby didn’t scoot back close enough to the wall is going to get flung to the floor and shatter into pieces. “Look, I know you didn’t want to make it a whole thing, but Bobby and Ellen wanted to come down to see you and I just thought it would be nice if––”
Once he’s stood in Sam’s bedroom window and watched the guys from animal control sweep their flashlights over the whole neighborhood, he heads out. Turns his phone off because he’s tired of the same concerned calls and texts over and over again.
“What?”
Dean frowns. “You mean like they have to go on some deep internal journey and find out who they are or something?”
People still come by to try and chat him up and wish him a happy birthday. After a while of just grunting and moodily sipping a beer, people seem to get the message. Springsteen gets sprung from a cage on Highway 9 and the pot shatters. Sam stalks in complaining, “That’s an authentic Hopi healing pot––oh man, this was handmade––” and Jo flops down next to him on the couch. Her hair’s longer now than it was the last time he saw her. He wonders if he’s gonna ever be surprised by the length of anyone’s hair again. He had no idea how much he took the simple pleasures of life for granted.
“Do things change from iteration to iteration? Or do you just do the exact same thing over and over?”
Dean leans back until he’s wavering on two legs of his chair. Maybe he’ll fall and crack his head open on the floor. And then he’ll come to standing in Sammy’s bathroom again. “I’m stuck because my life sucks and I watched Groundhog Day way too many times as a kid. Mystery solved.”
“Oh, that’s alright,” the man responds. His voice is deep, even-toned; almost serene. “I die all the time these days.” And he turns to look at Dean.
It’s a nice neighborhood Sam’s got here. A lot of big lawns and clapboard siding and bikes in sheds. It’s walking distance to Vanderbilt, which was good for Sam and his avowed mission to reduce his carbon footprint by walking everywhere. Dean had asked from a payphone in Tuscaloosa if he was sure it wasn’t just because he couldn’t pay rent and get a car because he was broke from Stanford undergrad, and Sam had hung up and hadn’t picked up the phone for a whole week. It drove him straight crazy, calling and calling and getting no answer. He knew Sam was fine, knew he was getting through law school okay, knew he was going to therapy and to meetings and that he wasn’t using, but Dean still felt that worry eating away at his stomach all three years he was in school. And then he came up for his graduation, and a nasty little voice in his head said you know how well he handles transitional periods, right? and even though he looked healthy and sounded bright and he moved in these beautiful, crisp, opioid-free motions, Dean just never got back on the road.
She smiles, sunny and pleased. “I also came to sleep with as many shitty country singers I can fit into forty-eight hours. And I need you to be in a better mood for that so you can hook me up with all the sad sacks you do open mics with.”
It was dim and quiet inside, just like he remembered. Dean headed for the familiar stall on autopilot, his legs weak now that he was nearly there. His steps were soft and silent on the rough wood of the stable floor. All around, the gentle noises of horses eating and resting came to his ears.
Another pen rose, but Castiel stepped forward and grabbed it out of the air before it could move, glaring at the ceiling as he growled firmly, “Stop hitting Dean.”
“Wonder if Clyde can eat bacon,” Dean said aloud, flipping some pieces over.
I hope everyone is doing well! I still am, for once, and I don't want to jinx anything, but I
.” He looked away, face red just at the thought. Dean and all those miles of tan, freckled skin that he sometimes showed when it was particularly hot and he went shirtless. Dean and those beautiful green eyes of his, Dean and—
burst into flight and head east, she would never hate him. It wasn’t in her nature.
“It’s only for one night,” Castiel muttered, sounding as if he was convincing himself more than Dean. Dean looked over as he began to toe off his shoes, feeling a little awkward as the doctor nodded at the bed somewhat reluctantly. “You take one side, I’ll take the other. We can put a pillow between us or something.”
Another blatant lie. Castiel’s fists clenched in anger at Dean’s father, who pushed him so hard and then left him alone when he finally accomplished something. “I suppose I’ll need to cheer extra loud during your races, then?”
A soft noise next to Castiel startled him. He turned and finally saw the human cowering a few feet away. Dean was curled into a little ball, mere meters away from where Castiel’s talons were dug into the ground. The human was trembling faintly, terrified.
Hello, my friends! You didn't REALLY think I was going to make you wait for the next chapter, did you? ;) You'll have to wait for Chapter Nine, but this one is coming on schedule, like the New Year's gift never happened.
At the moment, he had to duck out of the way as return bullets began to ring past, flashing and zipping through the air around them. A flash of pain arced up Castiel’s left bicep, signaling that he’d probably gotten nicked. He ducked and rolled, coming up behind a crate of what must have been several hundred pounds of cocaine. He’d never been more grateful for the density of all that powder than he was now.
Castiel wondered about the urge to press his lips to the prince’s, just to see how he reacted, to see how he tasted, how he felt.
Castiel wouldn’t ever find out.
Castiel gritted his teeth, tightening his grip on the little hand-mixer he was holding. “No. I’m telling you to leave me alone. I don’t want your help finding love, nor do I need it. I would appreciate it greatly if you stayed out of it.”
. I was scared of my Dad hurting my brother, and I was scared of him hurting me. I’m not a hero. I’m a coward.”
He was cutting his hair one day a month or so after the first night on Eden’s peak, squinting at his reflection in the mirror as he struggled to shave the hairs at the side of his head evenly with his dagger, when he saw Castiel come up behind him.
“I’m here, sweetheart,” Castiel whispered, holding his arms out. “It’s okay.”
“That would require speaking to her, which I would very much not like to do,” Castiel said flatly. The team burst out laughing. Dean thought he caught a grin on Coach Singer’s face, but the man was quick to hide it. Apparently, Bela’s bitchiness wasn’t as subtle as Dean had assumed. Castiel nodded at Cam’s outstretched hand. “How about fifty dollars and a bag of those stupid fruit gummies you like so much?”
Ishim roared, shoving at Castiel. His single eye was wild with pain and fury, so unlike the cool calm Ishim usually possessed. It made Castiel realize just how badly Ishim wanted him dead. The silver dragon wouldn’t stop until one of them was mere ashes in the wind.
Unfortunately, as soon as they hopped in the pool, Castiel could tell there was going to be a problem.
to have been an Alpha. Dean wasn’t into sexist stereotypes, but he couldn’t deny that certain Alphas had a sort of
Castiel blinked. He hadn’t ever thought of that. He knew that Dean had issues surrounding his male parental figure. John Winchester had not been the kindest man, by human standards. Indeed, some of the things he’d done made even Castiel angry. But Castiel had never considered the possible affiliation between Dean’s father and their time together through a simple title.
“I don’t know, but they don’t sound happy,” Garth replied. He handed Dean the phone when Dean held out his hand. Dean frowned as he put it to his ear.
Food, which the Omega got so excited about. Toothpaste, which he joyously stated was the ‘expensive, candy-tasting shit’ when he tried it the first morning. That damned stuffed bee, which Dean slept with every night, curled up in a fluffy little ball in the nest he’d made and gleefully showed to Castiel the first afternoon of his stay. Dean, Dean, Dean, Dean, Dean. He was imprinted into every thought in Castiel’s mind, every inch of his apartment, every fiber of his life.
In moments, Castiel was asleep.
“Well, they don’t live in the water,” Dean finally said. He peeked up at Castiel through his lashes, something twisting at his mouth. It took a second, but...
, Clyde typed.
The question was so out of the blue that Castiel felt like he’d been slapped. “They’re… They’re good. You might receive a better answer if you asked Dean that, Sam.”

The fucker gave Castiel a winning smile when they both surfaced.
“I will not,” Castiel replied. His voice, which had been so angry and full of real emotion a few seconds ago, was now calm and steely once again. It fucking
~>>>~
Castiel growled again, frustration building. He’d been almost fond of the prince earlier that morning, but now that fondness was being eaten up by faint disgust and intense annoyance. “I already told you. I want you to kill Alastair.”
Dean blushed, the color making his freckles stand out and his green eyes glow. A surge of blood raced to Castiel’s already rock-hard cock and he couldn’t help but tighten his arms where they were wrapped around Dean’s slender waist. “I don’t know,” the other boy said, voice barely more than a whisper. The gleam of arousal and the feeling of his boner pressed against Castiel’s told the dark-haired boy that Dean definitely wanted this, he was just unsure.
“On the ground!” Dean shouted from his back. “They’re humans.”
Dean frowned, defenses rising. “That was in no way peaceful. He was gonna rip your head off, Cas!”
“None taken,” Castiel replied calmly. “Will the city be able to recover?”
Dean gave him a beautiful smile. “Thanks. It’s gotten me this far.” He patted his body and looked down at himself, as if checking he was still in one piece. “We’re all good here. You gonna run?”
for the Alpha’s thick thighs. Dean tried to shake that thought off, embarrassed and a little bit ashamed.
Dean smiled shyly, resisting the urge to hide his face. “You, uh… you feelin’ up to kissing?” He’d learned that Castiel enjoyed kissing, as long as there wasn’t any sexual intent behind it. “If not, that’s fine. And if you gotta go somewhere, that’s fine too. I guess I kinda just barged in on you, and, uh—”
“I’ll tell you, but you can’t write it,” Dean said.
“Uh, okay,” he said aloud, wincing at the abruptness. Damn it, damn it, damn it!
. And he was tired of pretending otherwise.
“What are they called?” Castiel asked, intrigued. Dean still wasn’t looking at him. The merman almost looked... ashamed. For long moments, he didn’t answer.
Dean’s angel beamed at him. “Perfect.” He leaned in to press another gentle kiss to Dean’s lips, then released him so he could pull away and start moving toward the exit of the kitchen. He
The dragon’s wings were drooping, nearly brushing the sand beneath him. He couldn’t find it in himself to care.
known?”
“Of course not,” Castiel said. He looked at Dean with serious blue eyes, the color seeming even brighter because of the soft blue sleep shirt he was wearing. “I was just offering.”
It took Dean four hundred meters to begin following him right into the wall. Castiel found himself barely putting his feet on the wall before Dean was flipping too. At the end of their five-hundred-yard set, they were neck and neck, swimming as hard as they could to get to the wall first. Castiel touched before Dean, but he didn’t miss the fact that Dean had started twenty seconds behind him.
“Wait, wait, wait,” Dean cut in, something cold curling in his gut. “The guy’s name is Azazel?”
Castiel laughed. “Our cook used to have a jar of coconut oil in the pantry. We would measure how hot it had gotten by how much had melted. I remember my brothers and I throwing eggs onto the sidewalk just to see them cook.”
“Absolutely not,” Castiel replied.
“Heya, Cas,” a familiar voice said softly. It was soft and deep, colored with that beautiful accent that Castiel had dreamed about for exactly a year. He swallowed and sat up, finally daring to turn around.
Castiel’s face was calm, his eyebrows drawn together with what looked like sorrow. “Do you want to be beaten, Dean?”
Dean ended up disliking the white sauce with the little flecks that Castiel told him was called ‘ranch,’ but he did like the fries. He ended up finishing the entire burger and most of his fries before he was full. Castiel saved part of his burger for later, claiming he couldn’t eat nearly as much as Dean. After that, they got back on the road.
“I’ll explain later,” Dean said, and he sounded almost pleading. His eyes were a brilliant green in the flashing yellow of the alarm on the wall. “We need to get out of here.”
. Castiel smiled at the memory of the night before. He knew the merman’s name now.
“You try,” Cas directed, standing. Dean made a softer, sadder sound when the hand was withdrawn from his hair, but he didn’t tense. He simply laid obediently in Castiel’s lap, his back rising and falling, skin damp with sweat. He was quite stunning, Castiel realized. Beautifully human.
The door abruptly unlocked and slammed open. Before Dean or Castiel could react, a notebook flew through the doorway and slammed right into Castiel’s chest. It deliberately swerved around Dean and struck the other boy, bouncing off and landing on the floor. A pen came through soon after and hit the wall with a crack. The door abruptly slammed shut again, the lock clicking definitively.
(Warning for a two-second insight into Dean's, uh, shower routine, featuring an even shorter guest appearance of Castiel's name.)
“I’m going to leave, and you’re going to call the police immediately, aren’t you?” Castiel asked. He wasn’t even sure why he wanted to know, but he couldn’t think of anything else to say. The Omega chewing his sandwich swallowed, carefully putting it back on his plate.
His friend stood and put a gentle hand on Dean’s shoulder. Dean thought he could feel the warmth even through the layers of fabric he had on. “Come on, Dean. We can talk about what happened in the morning, alright?” Castiel asked. His voice was soft, like he was talking to a child. “Time for bed now.”
On the very cusp of releasing a soundwave that could likely shatter the very hull of the ship, something smashed into Dean’s stomach and he choked out a pathetic gasp instead. The breath flew from his lungs, not returning even as his gills flared desperately and he gasped, terrified. He looked up through streaming eyes to see the human going to kick him again.
Maybe. He hated to say it, but this was bigger than when he’d begged his aunt to take Sam in so his little brother could have a chance at a normal childhood. This was different than when he’d packed his bags and run off to college, unable to take his father’s cruel fists and crueler words any longer. This whole thing was different.
“No, I’ll be fine,” Castiel replied. It was only a few hours, anyway.
They started forward, moving across the beach and through the trees. Surprisingly, riding a walking dragon was like riding a really tall, really warm horse. As they continued along in the darkness, guided by Castiel’s night-vision, Dean found himself loosening, his body moving with the cadence of the dragon’s steps instead of fighting against each and every one.
Dean sat up so fast he smashed his forehead against Castiel’s nose. His friend grunted in pain and grabbed at his face with his right hand. His left was shaking Dean’s shoulder so hard, Dean was sure his eyeballs were rattling in their sockets.
Anna was staring at him with wide dark eyes. There was a moment where she seemed to be trying to communicate with low rumblings, before she remembered that he was in human form and that she was a dragon. There was a brief period of silence, and then Anna was shrinking to Castiel’s size. Her female human form looked shocked and a little afraid. “Castiel?” she whispered. “My gods. What are you
“Oh, uh... Good? Uh, okay, so... So... uh, how... how is this gonna work?” Dean stammered. He laughed, choked. “This sounds so stupid, I—”
. Any one of us could. You’re supposed to know what you’re doing. What the hell were you thinking?”
“I know,” Dean said gently. “I get it, Cas. Thanks for looking out for me. I promise I’ll eat when I wake up, okay? You can feed me whatever the hell you want, or I can make it. Or we can order it. Whatever. Just… please? I haven’t slept more than three hours in the past forty-eight, and I’m starting to see math equations on your face.”
“His fever is getting high,” Missouri said. “I need ice, now.”
, if his English was to be trusted—that he’d killed. “Okay,” he said.
Hair. Dean’s hair.
This chapter is dedicated to the absolutely ridiculous heat wave my area had this past summer. It was unbelievable. And yes, we had no air conditioning. Ick.
Undeterred, Dean prepared for his first event. He jumped right in the water beside Castiel when they started warmups, though he could sense it kind of irritated the other boy. Dean hoped it wasn’t too annoying. There wasn’t space in any other lane.
. And I didn’t even know if that was enough.”
Castiel smiled. Curious merman.
“I wasn’t sure if you would appreciate the gesture,” Castiel said sheepishly. “I guessed.”
“What are you scared of, sweet boy?” Castiel asked, gentle as always.
So on the first of July, Dean and Castiel packed the car, locked their apartment, and hit the road for California.
Castiel tried not to stomp up the stairs, reminding himself that Dean would be home and that it wasn’t fair to be mean to him just because his head hurt. Still, it was in with a frustrated huff that he yanked the door to their apartment open and stalked inside.
A gentle finger traced the lines of his face, startling him only slightly. He hadn’t been aware of how far into his thoughts he’d slipped. “You’re so thin,” Castiel murmured, running his thumb gently along the bolt of Dean’s jaw. “Has anything happened? Have you been safe?” His fingertips grazed the bruised side of Dean’s face, cool against the hot, injured skin.
Dean was wearing a long-sleeved flannel. From this angle, Castiel could almost imagine he had no Soul Mark on his inner right wrist. He could imagine that Dean’s Soul Mark was on his left shoulder instead, a set of angel wings where his shoulder met his tricep.
was left unsaid. Castiel understood Dean’s tentativeness around that word. It implied that what they’d said in that armory was true. It implied that there was going to be something
His legs felt strange when he climbed out of the cockpit and descended the ladder. He was too tired to do much more than nod or wave at the various people that called greetings to him. He was here often enough to have made friends, though his brain was too exhausted to pull up more than some names and basic information. He hurried through postflight checks, grateful that the compressors on the wheels hadn’t been damaged by his rough landing. That would have required a message to maintenance, which meant more paperwork, which meant more
“Thank you. Perhaps after the war we can speak again,” Castiel said. He gave her a small smile. “Goodbye Anna.”
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel murmured, sitting on the couch. “This was very kind of you.”
He swung his leg over Castiel’s neck, right at the wide juncture where it met his shoulders. Surprisingly, Castiel wasn’t too much wider than Baby. It was just like mounting a saddled warhorse.
“I’m... staying here?” he managed, going for the safe option out of all the questions swirling in his head.
There was nothing Castiel could say to that. Absolutely nothing.
Dean was still on his hands and knees, though. He’d stopped vomiting finally, but he hadn’t moved a bit.
“Talking to Coach,” Castiel replied. “We have something we need to tell you.”
“You’re… You’re saying you’ve been with many people,” Castiel guessed, wondering where this was going. “You believe that since you’ve dated and painted so many people, you know how to read them.”
The cave echoed with their shouts. Castiel didn't respond to Dean, though, so the echoes soon died away.
He and Dean stayed like that for at least thirty seconds. It was longer than Castiel might be comfortable with someone else, but when he was with Dean, the lines of what was normal and acceptable seemed to blur and soften. When they broke away, Dean looked much more relaxed. Castiel frowned at him anyway, eyes zeroing in on the bruise.
amazing, and the variety of soaps and shampoos available made Dean’s hands shake a little. He didn’t know which was the least expensive, so he just went with a random one and found himself exiting the shower smelling like mint and sweet citrus.
He slapped the wall, elbow popping painfully as he did. The Sparrows went wild. When Dean turned to look at the board, his eyes widened as he realized he’d beat the opposing team by four tenths of a second.
a heart, who deserved the things they were wishing for, and who were good enough for whatever — or whomever — it was they were pining for.
They’re on a hunt, of course, when Castiel learns about it.
“Ick,” Dean said, laughing a little. “How’d you clean ‘em off?”
When Coach Shurley gave the okay, Castiel shoved off the wall, streamlining halfway across the pool before breaking the water with a powerful arc of his arms. His shoulders stretched pleasantly as he broke the surface. He loved butterfly. Most swimmers hated it, but there was something about the precise rhythm and steady flow of it that Castiel was addicted to.
Dean silently agreed. Heat, he could deal with. Heat
for sure.”
it? Fuck, he was so fucked. Fuck.
Castiel considered that quietly. “Is there a strategy you have for defeating Alastair at all? You… You do know him well, after all.”
~>>>~
“What’s the matter?” Castiel asked. “Is Sam alright?” He knew that Dean’s contact list was limited to very few people. No one really texted Dean anyway.
Dean thought of the time Castiel had drunkenly called Meg instead of him and asked her to pick him up after he got hammered at a party in the very beginning of freshman year. Dean remembered feeling so fucking
whining. He wasn’t. “When I sit up it’s fine, but when I lay down my nose gets so stuffed up that it hurts.” He glared at the pillow. “I can’t
Dean smiled, something soft and almost… loving in his green eyes. “I’m super glad, Cas,” he said quietly. “I had a blast with you today, too. Honey ain’t usually my thing, but you made it super fun. Thanks for bein’ such a good… uh, such a good friend.”
“Dean, it’s a very important-“
“Perhaps I can start with a name, then,” he decided. “What’s your name, merman?”
So he saw the warning look. He saw the answering realization on Dean’s face as he wiped blood off his cheek and gave Sam a shaky smile. He put a hand on Castiel’s shoulder as the boys were climbing into Dean’s beloved car to drive back to the motel.
. I don’t know. I just… I can’t… I keep tryin’ to make this work because if it doesn’t… If it doesn’t…”
“This is not a discussion we should be having at your brother’s wedding,” Castiel grumbled, a hint of underlying growl in his voice. Dean just laughed and twirled away as the music rose and fell, soft and beautiful around them. As he came back, he caught the intensity in Castiel’s blue eyes. “Yes, I think I will.”
“See you, Cassie.” Gabriel watched him turn around and head out the back door. Castiel didn’t want Dean to see him leave. Part of him hoped Dean thought he was coming back, just to be mean.
The prince checked his weaponry one more time, fingers meticulous and smooth. Castiel watched him somewhat anxiously, feeling sort of naked in his thin leather armor. He wouldn’t need it, really. His dragon form was enough protection. It was more of a precautionary measure.
“Of course,” Castiel croaked out. “Goodnight.”
“He’s my cousin,” Castiel said without really meaning to. “He and I own this place, actually.”
“It seems that is going to involve... talking to people,” Castiel grumbled. “I’m not sure I’m prepared for that as of now.”
“It’s not your fault,” Castiel said firmly. “You never should have been taken in the first place. I’m just righting a grievous wrong as best I can.” He changed lanes, speeding up a little, and spared a glance at Dean. “Your turn.”
“You’re very strange,” Castiel remarked bluntly.
bad. Could have been much worse, if I’d decided so.” He gave a little smirk.
Castiel was pounding his way toward Alastair again. Blood was seeping from the wound on his right flank now. Dean could tell, from the tightness of the dragon’s muscles, that Castiel was in pain.
tired.
The screen faded to black.
Those five words smacked Dean in the chest like a freight train, warm and good. It made him feel like he was simultaneously flying and falling straight to the center of the earth. Dean choked on his next breath and had to cough it out, pretending like he’d inhaled some water. One of the swimmers on the deck patted him on the back until he stopped coughing.
Castiel turned to look at Dean, taking a moment to observe him carefully for the first time. The other boy was standing beside him, all sharp lines and tanned muscles and blinding white teeth. Of course, his body was as perfect as the rest of him. His broad, strong shoulders tapered to a slim waist and nicely toned abs. Dean’s entire body seemed to be made of miles of golden skin and subtle muscle lines. His long legs were slightly bowed.
He’d said it twice now, Castiel hadn’t missed that. He’d refrained from responding the first time, too wrapped up in apologizing, but now he cursed himself for not easing the doubts Dean was probably having. Despite how loved he was, Dean sometimes questioned it, especially after Castiel had just up and left. He knew that Dean struggled with that, with being left behind.
Castiel blinked at the firmness in his older self’s words. “Then what should I do?” he asked.
They passed under a few wispy clouds, the heavens opening before them. Castiel stayed as quiet as possible, keeping his eye out for any dragons that might be flying around. If they heard his wingbeats, there was a chance they wouldn’t be able to see him. He hadn’t been lying. He was built for night travel.
Yay, another chapter! I've been feeling pretty awful lately, so I'm sorry if the editing isn't done as well as usual, but I hope you still enjoy this one! Time for things to get... spicy. ;)
stopping him from just dropping off and falling all the way back down to earth.
This chapter is... fun. Yes, very fun. Also, have any of you ever done that thing where you write and put a lot of time and effort into a story, then read back over it halfway through and think that it's absolute shit? Yeah... I have a HUGE problem with that. :'(
Castiel sat up like he’d been electrocuted, the most movement Dean had seen out of him all day. “Dean, that’s a fantastic idea,” he said.
Dean swallowed, his throat dry. He felt faint, lighter than air. All the sound in the world seemed to fade away, everything zeroing in on the dragon sitting before him. “What are you saying, Cas?” he asked quietly.
“Dean,” Castiel said quietly once the motor had started, voice almost lost in the rumble of the bus engine.
“Sundown, jerk.”
Dean hit the gas.
“He tried to kill me.” Castiel swallowed, trying to fight past the tightness of his throat. “He chased me and... me and Dean.”
need to get out of here. It makes me itch to know that those men are still out there, and that they could still hurt you.” He wanted to say more, so much more, but Dean was looking at him with soft green eyes that seemed too big underneath the shadow of the hood he was wearing over his face.
There was no response. Dean hadn’t been expecting one. He turned off his radio and maneuvered his plane into a turn, preparing to go in a wide circle over the base. It would delay him by five minutes. He tried not to let the time get to him, but five minutes felt like an
“I-uh…” Dean gave a little dry laugh, trying to force some of the pain in his chest away as he remembered. “A dragon saved me.” Yes, a dragon. A beautiful, handsome dragon.
Castiel’s body lowered, his muscles tensing as he crouched like a trap coiled to spring. Dean opened his mouth, maybe to shout, maybe to ask for a little more time to adjust. It didn’t matter what it was. It was torn away from him as Castiel launched into the air.
!” Michael snarled. His voice was a little lower than a shout, likely so he didn’t disturb any party guests that might be standing near the entrance of the hallway. “What matters is that you fucked up and there’s
Dean wished it had.
“Hunter zero-five-bravo, you’re good. Hold-steady at taxiway lima alpha Charlie,” Whidbey Tower told him. “Go ahead and switch to Ground. Have a nice night, sir.”
“So… uh, what now?” Dean asked quietly.
, Dean,” Castiel spat over his shoulder. It was filled with so much venom that Dean flinched like he’d been struck.
It's always bittersweet, ending a long fic like this one. While I'm sad it ended, I'm also very grateful for every single reader who came along for the ride. Whether you were here from the very first chapter, or are reading this five years in the future, I want to thank you for being here. You guys seriously make writing a joy. I never could have imagined that a secret passion of mine could have grown to what it is now, and it's all thanks to this site and to you guys. Y'all are amazing.
Gabriel set the bag of chocolate chips down and turned, blinking at him. “Uh, the number from that person in your class? Yeah, it’s right here. Why?”
Dean, thankfully, seemed as if he hadn’t noticed. He was perfectly content as he ate his ice cream, unaware of the swirling internal conflict raging inside of Castiel. Castiel prayed Dean would remain upbeat and content after their conversation, but he couldn’t deny the little voice in his head that told him this was going to turn into an argument. A big one.
Castiel hurtled out of the pool room and into the hall, feeling even more nauseous the faster he ran toward the exam rooms. He’d left the merman with Alastair for close to an
Determined not to show it, Castiel took a step back and grabbed the door of their apartment. “Leave him alone, or I’ll call the police. Then we’ll
Perhaps this season wasn’t going to be as perfect as he’d thought.
Castiel frowned. “Pie?” He'd heard Dean mention it twice now.
“Jesus, what is it with the competition pools and being freezing cold?” he asked. Diving in would be torture.
That was when Dean realized they were laying in his bed. Castiel was wearing loose clothes that looked quite comfortable, his hair tousled with sleep. Dean’s sea-blue sheets were twisted around the dragon’s waist, same as they were around his own.
didn’t even know he and his brothers were blood. In fact, there were only a select few amount of people who knew. So why had he just added this young, foreign Omega to that very short list? Was he really so depraved that a pretty face and some sass could unwind his careful control? Castiel didn’t think so. He was very in control of his Alpha instincts.
“Dean!” Castiel shouted, at the same time as Dean’s loud curse. The dragon cursed as well, throwing himself out of bed to drag Dean up off the floor. “You assbutt. You’re supposed to be resting.”
“Oh?” Castiel peeled away from him for half a second, ducking around a pair of Alphas and a female Beta walking the other way, then rejoined Dean’s side.
, Clyde typed.
“I think it is,” Castiel replied quietly, amazed. “If this is love, then perhaps I can understand why humans obsess over it so much. The Righteous Man is truly beautiful.” He looked down at the human nuzzling sleepily at the skin of his collarbone. “Dean is beautiful.”
Thankfully, that was the last Castiel heard of anything from either of them. He moved through the rest of his classes in peace, then took the bus home. He got back before Dean, since Dean worked at the restaurant until later in the evening. Castiel was glad. He’d been planning on going out and possibly buying some snacks for the movie night they’d had planned. It had been far too long since either he or Dean had relaxed, and he secretly wanted to see the excitement in the other boy’s eyes at the sight of pie. Maybe Castiel would make a pie for him. Did they have the ingredients?
Sam sighs again. More annoyed this time. “I just don’t get why you have to be so––so shitty about this. Are you ever going to let me start trying to make things up to you?”
Dean swats the air in front of his face; sure enough, he bats Sam’s hand away. He opens his eyes to scowl at him then, trying to control his voice. “Well, Sammy. I sure am sorry I’m not handling this the way you would, with a big happy smile and a pdf of affirmations my therapist printed off for me––“
“Sorta. I started attacking his music career and, y’know, he’s never gonna let that slide.”
“You’re sure in a snit for a guy who has all his loved ones together under one roof to celebrate his birthday,” she notes. He just grunts. “Seriously?” Another grunt. She reaches over to pinch the delicate skin of his side and he can’t swallow the yelp. “You dick. I drove in a car for fifteen hours with my mom and Bobby arguing over crusty old maps just for you to scowl at all of us?”
Water running. Bathroom door opening. Bodies moving, music blaring. “So get this,” Sam saying.
“You drove down to spend the weekend sneaking into bachelorette parties that are too drunk to realize you’re a stranger drinking on their dime,” he snaps.
“That’s fine,” he says, “but––”
“Just fuck off,” he snaps, and he stalks over to the couch to sulk until the universe decides to drop a piano on his head or something.
There’s a moment between heartbeats, between one of the 100,000 he has in any given day and the last one of his life, where he tries to think something good. Glass shimmers in the air, into his hair, his face, his hands, and he wonders, distantly, what his last thought should be. His eyes drift shut against the impact as the Impala glides across the pavement, turning ass over teakettle while every window shatters and this red spray splatters the windshield, and he thinks that this is always a good part of the movie. When the rugged hero’s drawing his last breath and the enemy ranks are closing in and he grips his gun as best he can in one bloody hand because like hell he’s going down without a fight. And the audience is breathless, the women clutching their pearls, the men hard-jawed and intense, and Sammy next to him squirming around in his seat to hiss into Dean’s ear, not like this, right? I mean, he can’t just die like this, can he? His story’s all wrong if he dies like this in the end, Dean! But the Impala rolls once, twice, gas and steel and smolder and all the weight of the world pulling the car into a snarl around him and he wants to squint stoically into the distance, John Wayne the fuck out of his last moments on Earth, but the only thing running through his mind is fuck fuck fuck, no way it ends like this Sammy, please Christ, before he is nothing but broken bone and torn skin and stone dead––
Sam’s face immediately darkens and his voice gets almost too low to hear over the noise. “That’s not funny, Dean. If you brought something into my house––”
“Well,” Charlie says, considering. Crossing her arms over her chest, she goes on, “I mean, there’s different kinds of loops, and how you satisfy it depends on what kind it is. You could have a for loop, which just runs however many times you set it to, or you can have a while or a do while loop where it just runs as long as your programmed expression is true or, y’know, false, depending, or you could have––” and she stops cold. Really gnawing on her lip now.
Strawberry jam oozes out of her mouth as she takes a bite of biscuit. She wipes at it with an already very dirty napkin and says around a mouthful of dough and fruit and sugar, “Oh yeah? Why’s ‘at?”
He blinks. “Well. I sure do keep dying and coming back to 10 p.m. Thursday night.”
“Okay, but. Outside of video games, what do you know?”
“Oh, fuck you, you––Loony Toons asshole.” He makes it almost two blocks before there’s a Doberman snarling in his face. His eyes make it most of the way through a roll before there’s teeth in his throat.
“It could be an infinite loop.” It rushes out in one breath and her eyebrows are absolutely writhing on her forehead. “Those happen when you don’t add a terminating condition and the program just runs over and over again. They’re usually a mistake, but––they do happen.”
