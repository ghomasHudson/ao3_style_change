“Looking.”
Slowly, Sherlock’s temper dissipates. He’s tired. Empty. He sits on the couch, rakes his hands through his curls. Tugs at his scalp. Keeps tugging until kind fingers encourage him to relinquish his hair, to lift his head. Once Sherlock meets John’s eyes, John drops a kiss on his brow.
“I…” It’s almost a question.
They've been sharing a bed more frequently. They haven't discussed the all-encompassing question of

Huskier. “Which I put out.”
Not so much cold feet as unforgiving introspection and perspective.
John noses down his neck. Kisses his clavicle.
“Not my fault. I’m already comfortable.”
“What other one?”
She kisses his cheek. Runs away blushing.
John smiles ruefully against Sherlock’s neck. “Either I’m talking to myself out loud or you’re reading my mind.”
Sherlock opens his mouth to say something snarky. Changes his mind at the last second and replies, “If my doctor commands.”
“I didn’t know you like vanilla ice cream,” John says.
“What happened?” John asks.
Sodden jumper sleeves rolled up to his elbows. The sound of water sloshing and cutlery clinking. John is barefoot, at ease. Posture perfect. He stands straight for every occasion, be it conversing with Mycroft Holmes or scrubbing congealed pasta sauce from Mrs. Hudson’s good spatula.
Clamps his hand down on Sherlock’s crotch. Sherlock is already undoing his belt.
John smiles apologetically at Sarah. She looks beautiful. Radiant in the candlelight. She orchestrates a

Sherlock’s sleep schedule is chaotic. To put it mildly. When he does find it necessary to succumb to his transport’s need to rest, he either folds himself over the kitchen table like a limp marionette or he drags himself to the couch before he looses consciousness in the strangest of places. Like the shower. Or on the landing.
Sherlock starts nosing around, too. Mirroring John because when in doubt, do as John does. Flattens his nostrils closed against the top of John’s head and exhales. “Tedious.”
John buys a ring.
John blinks. Checks the projector again, though he’s not sure why. “We’re in the wrong threatre.” He stands up.
Please, dear God, no more weddings in real life.
Sherlock smiles. Soft. Small. Evocative.
Sherlock says. Less quietly but no less verbally.
or apply one of the many lotions/oils/scrubs adorning the side of the tub.
Sherlock is familiar with death. In fact, he would say he’s on a fist name basis. John is also familiar with death, but in a different manner entirely. Sherlock connects the dots, solves for X. He’s committed thousands of poisons and weapons and motives to memory because death is a sneaky bastard. John heals the wounded. Or kills them, depending.
John would feel sorry for Mycroft, only he doesn't.
John wakes to Sherlock muttering what sounds like numbers at random. He’s lying flat on his back, staring at the ceiling. Chest rising and falling. Light pollution seeps through the curtains of Sherlock’s bedroom window, a blush of oranges and reds and yellows enliven the pale expanse of his torso. He’s unashamedly naked, one leg dangling off the side of his bed and the other lost under the covers.
Really?

“This wasn’t a date,” Sherlock says, bemused.
“Pub’s allowing this, then?” Bird asks.
Resolved.
“You’re desperately in love with him.”
One of the greatest minds of the twenty-first century is practically climbing the walls. He steps on and off the coffee table. Scatters sheets of music. His fingers wind tightly in his hair, pulling and pulling and whimpering at the strain and the stress of all the noise, noise, noise! Never, not once, has John found Sherlock’s masochistic quirks to be remotely funny; episodes cataclysmic to his manner as a functioning human being in his own right.

Sherlock is delighted to obey John. For once.

“We have an hour before they burry us alive.” Sherlock’s vocal chords make sweet, sweet love to John’s cochlea.
John hits send before he realizes that he actually text,
“Not the word I was looking for,” Sherlock gasps when John manhandles him toward the guesthouse.
“It’s who you take with you.”
—there is no failsafe for a certain pair of idiots knocked unconscious and barricaded behind the slabs of maybe-perhaps-beef.
“Almost done. Don’t wriggle around so much.” John sits solidly in Sherlock’s lap.
Sherlock scratches the back of John’s hand. An odd and painful way to remember him by. Sherlock grasps the cuff of Mycroft’s dinner jacket. John watches after them until the darkness obscures their figures navigating the alcove toward home.
And upsilon is known as Pythagoras’ letter and Pythagoras is theorized to—“
it pains him to listen to John think. Everything the Ferris Wheel incorporates, utter repugnance in Sherlock’s limited experience. Confined spaces. Repetition. Tedium. Comprehension, a frown on John’s face when he finally realises he’ll be accompanying the only grown man he knows who handles boredom about as well as a Attention Deficit Hyperactive two-year-old on the verge of a sugar-induced coma.
Worth what, he can’t fathom. But definitely deserving of more than his fair share.
“You okay?” When Sherlock doesn’t answer, he hazards a guess, “Mycroft?”
Sherlock huffs. Doesn’t matter. Irrelevant.

Sherlock knows what John likes, but John likes a lot. Sex-wise and food-wise. He needs to narrow the playing field or he’ll be slaving over a hot stove all day and then slaving under a hot John all night. Neither of which appeals to him, presently.
John can’t decide what’s worse. Being shot at or Sherlock wallowing in a kind of state where hopes and dreams go to die.
Damn her.
“Fitting ornamentation for the flat.” Sherlock twiddles his canvas.
Sherlock objects to desperate.
“Does he?” John bends down. Nudges Sherlock’s face with his nose until their mouths meet. Kisses him chastely, the sound of their lips parting, touching. Sherlock’s heart vacates his chest, tries to find a new home in his throat. It’s mildly uncomfortable. Sherlock doesn’t like it. Except not really. Because it’s fascinating. Hasn’t felt this way before. Hasn’t been rendered speechless before. Breathless. Wanting more of something legal, something good, something alive. “He didn’t threaten to break me if I break your heart, did he?” John kisses Sherlock again. A little kiss. Gentle, sipping shallowly at Sherlock’s lips.
Sherlock is texting Lestrade around John’s back. Hooking his arm under John’s arm and tilting his head to one side, his injured cheek angled toward the light—the better for John to see. “Taught myself.”
John grabs the sleeve of his robe. “I’m sorry, Sherlock,” he titters. Actually titters. Sherlock has never heard a man giggle like John Watson. He’s never been known to find solace in what can arguably be described as annoying, either. But John isn’t annoying. He’s fascinating. Loyal. An enigma. (
John ignores him. Nibbles on his popcorn.
“Leave,” Sherlock says none too gently, but breathlessly. Difficult to sound threatening in the state he’s in.
John drops his luggage beside the door.
“Yes.” Sherlock’s lips twist into something resembling a smile. His cherry flavored sucker has stained his mouth red. If John didn’t hold himself to the bravery standards of his late father, Sherlock might creep him out. “Jim Moriarty is scared of you. I like that.”
“You’re an arsehole. That was six years ago.”
John doesn’t like this plan.
John can’t stop laughing.
Sherlock would rather John punch him in the face. It would hurt less.
Sherlock mouths,

But this? White paint, white bedclothes, and an original Thomas Kindade painting? Hardly.

John restrains him. Sherlock fumbles the thumbs down the stairs. He does not approve of John’s approach to what Mycroft stuffily refers to as a
“Are they promoting underage sex?”
John makes tea.
John suddenly needs to kiss him. Right now.
Jesus.
Rather than say anything, he holds the picture in question for Sherlock to observe. An everyman wearing the same shirt, John believes, as the too-pretty-to-be-real male model loafing the entirety of a two-page spread.
Sherlock is used to drowning by now.
“You’d be carted off to prison.”
"Soon," Sherlock says, almost breathlessly. Like he can't believe it. A little introsepction, an inward gaze at the immediate future, the immediate forever, until the two of them are nothing but a memory flyaway in the firmament. Burning brightly, rubies and diamonds. Sherlock's eyes shine like pennies at the bottom of a pool. Treasure, indeed.
) The courage, Art Nouveau, dangerous, what have you. John was insanely attracted to her profession in the face of her assurances that modeling is a tedious business. Maintaining a single position for hours. Keeping still, keeping quiet.

“No.”
“No. The wife orchestrated the entire assault, obviously.”
Sherlock is speaking animatedly about his first, official case with the Yard. John has never heard this story before and he’s hanging on Sherlock’s every word. Sherlock never does anything by halves. He’s either on or off, traveling hundreds of kilometers an hour or standing perfectly still. So he’s capable of talking while barely moving at all. A nigh twitch of his lips. This evening, however, cedes the more energetic, the more passionate side of Sherlock. Arms waving, fingers splaying, gesticulating with his entire body. Poetry in motion. The lights cast Sherlock in a lovely glow. Purple. Wisteria, maybe? John doesn’t know. But it’s pretty.
“Stop the cab!” Sherlock shoves John outside when the taxi screeches to a halt. Sherlock is a study in wounded pride, not-quite shame coloring his Hellenistic cheeks pink. John wishes he’d kept his mouth shut. Doesn’t stop him from thinking that Sherlock is kind of adorable when he’s trying to prove a point. If that’s what he has in mind. Points to prove, not John Watson’s to murder.
Sherlock asks, “Why did he shout the Chinese tradition of penjing?” What he means is,
Two things. One, Sherlock is vivacious and smiling so John has a snowball’s chance in hell of denying him. Two, Sherlock said

John scoffs. Licks his palm and immediately dives into Sherlock’s trousers, foreplay be damned.

“Uuurrrhhggg.”
“What are you doing?”
Sherlock thinks. Gasps aloud.
John grapples with his weight. Pins Sherlock’s wrists over his head. “What do you think?” John asks with feigned nonchalance, once he’s sure neither of them are about to fall on their asses.
Three months after Sherlock’s return, John is bound and determined to force-feed his on-again/off-again flatmate Mrs. Hudson’s shepherd’s pie come hell or high water. He balks when he spies Sherlock’s six-pack of contrition shoved behind a severed leg. The

John mimes. Sherlock checks the reflection in the window. Table three, bald German with acute gingivitis. He either has a gun in his pocket or he’s very excited about his lasagna. John isn’t so much mouthing,
“No,” Sherlock answers.
They disrobe on their way to the bathroom, leaving a trail of sodden trousers, socks, and pants in their wake. A bit of a shock to find the shower in question is barely a shower at all. They stand naked, side by side, scrutinizing with chary eyes. Sherlock shrugs. Bullies John inside, suffering John’s not-really-protestations until he slides in with him. It’s a tight fit. Something their turgid members appreciate, but their elbows and knees don’t.
“Stood you up?”
John makes room for Sherlock, who ignores the offer for the first ten minutes. He’s…well. He’s
“How did she have a child if he’s dead? His sperm should be dead.”
“From a splinter? Hardly.”
Sherlock is chary of John’s thinking cap. He says, “It wasn’t murder,” way too gleefully. Must be worse than murder.
“Normally say,” John finishes for him. “Because they’re idiots.”
Sherlock watches John use his 10-in-1 as a hammer. His face “goes all soft”, per John, and a surge of affection catches him unawares. “John,” he starts. “Would you stay if I—“ Tries again, reduced to stammering by the raw honesty in John’s eyes. “What if I couldn’t—“ Frustrated. “If I couldn’t give you what you need. What you want. Would you stay?”
“Can’t Harry help?”
“Bedroom?”
It’s said affectionately. Warm, reliable, much like John himself.
John shrugs. “S’not like I didn’t deserve it.”
a waste of space on his hard drive because he lives with the man and it’s in his best interest to hone his ability to assess whether John’s feeling murderous or John’s feeling gassy.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft says, as if his brother’s name is a threat in and of itself, “we’re leaving.”
John stares down at Sherlock. Licks his lips. “How?”
May be a warning. May be Sherlock's version of sweet talk. More than likely both.
, superior suite, booked under the name Sherrinford.
John smiles. “Yes, you do.” Continues sorting August.
Sherlock receives a text from Mycroft. The address to
Reporters camp outside the flat on Monday. Their names dominate the headlines on Tuesday. Lestrade and his team applaud their arrival at the Yard on Wednesday. John disables comments on his blog on Thursday. Victor Trevor pays a visit to Mrs. Hudson on Friday, arms loaded with swatches and pamphlets and tiny magnifying glass boutineers. By Saturday, the world is aware Sherlock Holmes and John Watson are tying the knot. By Sunday, the world is invited to a wedding neither John nor Sherlock know anything about.
Sherlock waves him off. “Not my fault you didn’t figure it out.”
Sherlock lobs him a funny look. John loves the crease between his eyebrows when he’s confused.
"What would you call it, then?"
Sherlock motions for John to proceed.
“Did you kill Manny again because you can or because multiple stab wounds to the bum is case-related?”
He’s blushing.
John is mopping the kitchen floor. If grinding a wet rag against the linoleum with the heel of his bare foot can be called mopping. He stops. Blinks at Sherlock, who is sitting in his chair. John shifts his weight. His toes stick to the gelid tiles. “Congratulations.”
“Okay, that last part is me. But Sarah isn’t an option.”
I know these chapter notes disrupt the flow of the story, but I want you all to know I'm trying very hard to update daily. Don't give up on me!
overused and unimaginative. He listens, but he does not absorb. Not entirely. His thoughts are separate and distinct from the vitriol spewing from the mouths of those whose sense of self worth is next to nothing, his mind the brine to their oily constitutions.
“What are you thinking?”
Of course he does. It’s obvious. Sherlock can’t help but curl his lip in response. Mycroft sits opposite him in John’s chair. Legs crossed, umber sock garters just visible up his trouser leg. Makes Sherlock want to break something. Of Mycroft’s, preferably. John would not appreciate finding a mess upon his return from the shops.
“How did she have a child if he’s dead? His sperm should be dead.”
John ignores him. Nibbles on his popcorn.
John can’t help it. He gives Sarah the side-eye before he defends her:
“I’m a whole person,” Sherlock announces out of the blue.
One. Two. Three times. He feels like he’s wrung dry, turned inside out with the intensity.
“What about the other one?”
When Sherlock approached him with another art-related investigation—one far removed from penile dismemberment—he thought it would be one of those relatively painless cases. You know. The kind where Sherlock makes an appearance, identifies the culprit, and departs in a span of minutes. John only refers to these prompt episodes of deduction as
. (If he’s capitalizing willy-nilly, he might as well go whole hog.) Focuses on the fact that John is going to kiss him. (Or maybe punch him. John does surprise.) Sherlock is obtuse when it comes to sentiment and all its trappings he eschews, but he’s adept at interpreting a shift of the eyes, a nibble of the lip. Micro expressions. John wants him.
“Obvious.”
“Cashmere.”
John kisses him fervently for giving voice to the latter. Their pocket of air is compromised, but it's fine. It's all fine.
“Why would you play again if you already know he loves you?”
. John’s shoulder begins to ache. Seizing up. He rolls his head from side to side, stretches the muscles in his neck as best he can. His arms are folded across his chest to keep his core warm.
John’s stomach lurches to one side, noticing a pattern. Showers less than ten minutes long. A periodic crackle of newsprint, not a haphazard ransacking for obituaries out of sheer boredom. The susurrus of what Sherlock refers to as crap telly.
Sherlock glares at John from under his arm.
They sneak out through John’s bedroom window. Down the fire escape, creeping through the alleyways. Sherlock’s pace is strident and eager. John relishes that warm and fuzzy feeling he gets when he’s doing something wrong for the right reasons. The clip-lap of Sherlock’s shoes on the pavement keeps time with his heart.
Drowning. Deeper. Sinking down and down inside his chest. Plummeting, freefalling, flying until he reaches the bottom or the peak, the apex or the nadir. Either way. Doesn't matter; he's teetering on the edge of the world, looking down into the starry night. Eyes wide. A beat of suspended animation. Heat, pressure, pleasure.
John undresses Sherlock slowly. Loves him slowly, meticulously. Once it’s been said, it’s easier to say again and again and again, punctuating John’s hands just there, his mouth on his—
So he can, what? Spy on a killer? He’s chased off Deez, God knows how. And he expects John to just go with it?
And, okay. It is pretty funny.
Sherlock and John have a giggle fit.
“Sherlock,” John tries his hand at an imitation of Greg, albeit a sleepy Greg. “Fancy divulging this week’s lottery numbers? Thanks, mate.”
Sherlock cuts his eyes to John, who’s waiting for him to continue. Eyebrows knitting now that he’s stuttered to a halt. “—killed him. Obvious. Boring. John?” Sherlock turns on his heel and strides briskly toward the main road. There’s another mystery to solve. Namely, their anniversary.
Mary is dumbstruck.
Lestrade spits coffee out of his mouth.
Sherlock hugs himself. Scratches through his sleeves. Waits and waits and waits for an eternity. Time and space pressing down, down, down on his shoulders. His vertebra allocating the pain throughout his spine. Down his arms and legs and he can’t remember when he was. Or where he’s gone. Or why he’s supposed to be. But he does remember the name and the face of his dealer.
I'm sorry, I've been sick. I couldn't NOT write something for Valentine's Day, though. Forgive me for the randomness and the not-traditionally-romanticness of this chapter. I'm going back to bed. 9-6
“They’re yellow.”
His boldfaced lie facilitates his graduation from a minor inconvenience to a full-blown nuisance.
John is pouring over a ream of text messages. Printed, portrait, at 120% for his convenience. And how is it, exactly, that Sherlock can be so accommodating and so insulting at the same time? John sighs. Grinds his knuckles against his temples. He’s seeing double, eyes shifting against his will. Losing focus. He has no earthly idea how long it’s been since the start of Sherlock’s most recent case.
"John," Sherlock presses on. "I won't regale your friends and family with anecdotes from our many cases together. It would do little to illustrate how integral you are to me and my work. You are..." Looks down at (what appears to be) his half-eaten dinner. "...more than a friend. You are my partner. So believe me when I say I wish you every happiness. I am a cynic, John. When you told me you were getting married, I found the idea or marriage ludicrous and superficial. Now, I find it..." Looks up, into John's eyes. "...agreeable."
Sherlock stumbles into the living room, coat askew. “Shh!” he drunk-whispers to John, who drunk-shuts the door behind them, rattling the skull on the mantle.
Sherlock rests his hand on John’s back. Feels him breathing in and out, in and out. Music to his ears. John’s existence inspires him to compose the final movements of Franz Schubert’s Symphony No. 8 in B minor. A right mess. Because really? Sherlock would be ashamed of himself if he weren’t so stunned by the enormity of John’s effect on him.
“Afraid I can’t say the same,” John is somewhat irked to admit. “How do you know Sherlock?”
“No. Not what I meant.”

, like needles pricking his arms. And it’s
“Oh. Right. Damn.”
“John…” Sherlock attempts. He sweeps his eyes up and down the couch. No place to sit. John is being unaccommodating. Perches on the edge of the table instead. Pats John’s shoulder three times. Because three is always nice. (
John hangs up his coat. “What game?”
“Lima syndrome,” John whispers. Or thinks. They’re so close now Sherlock can scarcely tell the difference.
John pauses for thought. “Yes, I think so.” Sweeps the trash in the bin beside the loo. “Only one thing can make it better.”
Sherlock knows what John is thinking. Probably based on the hue of his tracheas or something. “Redecorated.”
Romantic gestures, words of affirmation, terms of endearment. Discarded, left fermenting in the deepest and darkest reservoirs of Sherlock’s hindbrain.
Invaded. How appropriate.
“I trust you’ll have my back in this endeavor?”
“My fingers are like jam,” Sherlock announces. Starts once he perceives that John is standing next to him, half-empty glass of water in his shaking left hand.
When Sherlock leaves his mobile unattended in order to wash the remnants of a pig fetus out of his hair—
“You’re doing what?” Sherlock asks his client. “Oh. No, no, no. Not an optimum manner whereupon you’ll achieve orgasm—“ Sherlock wrinkles his nose. “Clearly, I was mistaken.”
Because Sherlock already has a massive ego and if John knows Sherlock as well as he thinks he does, he’s recording them snogging.

“And sex again. Horny bastards.”
I apologize for the somewhat directionless chapter. The John to my Sherlock needed me tonight and she takes priority to my mediocre writing. Please enjoy what I was able to finish!
John sighs. He accepts the proffered beer anyway.
Sherlock is just fine with that.
why, but the compromise of John Watson’s safety—the usual ‘could be dangerous’ notwithstanding—is linked directly to Sherlock’s ability to function under stress. Worse than H.O.U.N.D., his body shaking uncontrollably. His mind replaying the unfortunate events leading to John’s incapacitation, over and over. Lead pipe, generic ne’er-do-well number two, and somebody played cricket as a child. Once to the face, twice to the shoulder. Bam, bam, bam.
John scours the usual places. And the unusual. Sherlock’s homeless network are real tight-lipped bastards when there’s nothing in it for them—John has a ten pound note on his person, which pales in comparison to Sherlock’s standard fifty quid—and Mycroft proves to be as insufferably vague as ever.
John revisits their conversation. “Son of a bitch,” he says.
And Sherlock isn’t a romantic.
John’s eyes are closed. Relaxing fully under Sherlock’s ministrations. Sherlock cleans his back. His spine. Cataloguing vertebra and counting the near-invisible body hair.
“I have no control over previews.”
Sherlock makes love like no one John has ever known. Most people associate intimacy with sex or the physical aspects of a romantic relationship. Sherlock associates intimacy with an intense familiarity that goes beyond a memorization of facts, committing to memory thoughts and feelings and honest to God pablum.
Sherlock lolls his head from side to side. Reveling in John’s praise. Tugging meekly at his shirt as his body writhes, nipples peaking against the see-through fabric.
Must be written all over Sherlock’s face because Mycroft grins wryly. “He’s the best thing that’s ever happened to you. I’m afraid,” he says, picking lint from the arm of John’s recliner, “that if he were to sever ties during this particular juncture of your…”
“At this time of night? It had better be a case.”
Flesh. Flushed and perspiring beneath the sheets of John’s bed. A cocoon of linen, and their broken sighs reverberate in their ears, safe and sound in a tangle of limbs and a nest of pillows and discarded clothing. John loves him as one condemned to die on the morrow. Thoroughly, attentively, casing Sherlock’s lean frame beneath his body. Extols him past the point of no return with
“Let’s get started, shall we?” Sherlock says as he sheds his coat. A black, diaphanous shirt hangs loose on his shoulders, clings tight to his abdomen. A pair of studded, leather trousers like a second skin. They complement the curve of his plump arse and emphasize the length of his outrageously long legs. Powerful thighs. Muscular calves and...John’s not entirely sure how Sherlock got himself in them, but he’s not complaining. On the contrary. A bit distracted by the idea of him removing them, honestly. Peeling them off, and he’d have to go slow. May even need a little help.
John offers Sherlock a small smile. “Right.” Stands a little straighter. “Good.”
“John?”
“Yeah, like that’s going to happ–” John nearly chokes when ‘silk and steel’ sweeps into the room, all perfectly styled hair and sharp cheekbones.
. He’d almost forgotten…how amazing John is. How his sense of home manifested itself in the shape of his dearest friend, utterly and completely, and John draws back. Damn near takes Sherlock’s heart with him. Lurching like it’s trying to follow, trying to minimize the distance between the two of them because nothing on this Earth will separate Sherlock and John so cruelly ever again.
“That’s a little pedophiliac, isn’t it?”
He bangs his humerus against the kitchen table. Pain. Radiating down his arm. Better. Much better. Tactics he remembers well from his Afghan days. Standing watch in the middle of the night, nothing but adrenaline and bad coffee to keep him awake. Kneeling on the ground, making himself uncomfortable. The best way to stay alert.
. The pad of his finger heavy against his bottom lip. Down his chin, his chest, muscles rippling in its wake. Directs John’s attention back to his crotch. John doesn’t remember the last time he was so turned on by so very little, and Sherlock Holmes is barely in a state of undress.
John abandons Sherlock's hair in retaliation. Between his shoulders, down his spine, over the swell of his backside and up again. Sherlock sleeps in the nude. John really doesn't mind.
“And sex again. Horny bastards.”
Sherlock and John stand outside The Grove, bundled up in their coats. The police have long since departed with Carruthers, and the stag do has disbanded, but since John ‘single handedly subdued Carruthers in a formidable fashion’ according to one Mr Sherlock Holmes, he lagged behind to give his statement and made absolutely sure Sherlock didn’t need any medical attention.
Sherlock thinks.
They grin inanely at one another. John is three sheets to the wind. “Hey.” He prods Sherlock’s calf with his foot. “It’s not how you die that matters.”
“What is your B.M.I.?”
“Well, thank God you aren’t completely hopeless!” Sherlock snaps before he swans out of the room.
The Kiss N’Tell phone rings.
John draws the back of Sherlock’s hand to his lips. Plants a kiss on his knuckles.
“Because I can,” Sherlock says, twirling his spoon for emphasis.
John smirks.
John uses his free hand to unbutton Sherlock’s coat.
“Hardly routine.”
Christ, he was better than good, he was sex in leather. A lap dance’s wet dream. The strip tease to end all strip teases. And he hadn’t even technically finished taking any of his clothes off. No, good wasn’t good enough. He was great. Better than great. He was mind-blowing.
. (If he’s capitalizing willy-nilly, he might as well go whole hog.) Focuses on the fact that John is going to kiss him. (Or maybe punch him. John does surprise.) Sherlock is all thumbs when it comes to sentimentality and its trappings he eschews, but he can interpret a shift of the eyes, a nibble of the lip. Micro expressions. John wants him.
Sherlock is concerned for John’s sanity. “We solve crimes on a regular basis.” He pauses. Tilts his head to one side. “Well, I solve crimes on a regular basis.”
“Man crushes?”
the spindrift.
“Later,” Sherlock tries to convince him. “I’ll explain everything later.” Explores the divots on John’s cheek, around the back of his neck. “Just…” he says, edging closer. Breath ghosting across John’s lips.
Oh. Because it's John who's calling. Because John is running an errand. Necessary, but inconvenient.
John catches someone’s eye.
“I’d rather die.”
John rolls over on his back. He clutches his stomach, laughter bubbling between his lips. “You tit!”
Sherlock does not believe in love.
Brain teaser. Yes. Good.
Sherlock grunts. Braces himself against the wall of the shower. Inhales the scent of his shampoo. He’s overreacting. Stop. Listen. Breathe. He can hear John in the kitchen. Cooking dinner? Or demolishing his chemistry set, one. But John wouldn’t do that. No, John is the antithesis of the opinions of people who don’t matter in this equation. And John’s words…
Sherlock grumps, “I’m complimenting you. That’s what you do when you compliment people. Would you have me compliment you stintingly?” Touches John’s wrist. “She’d be lucky to have you,” he says again. Like he’s daring John to argue.
John thinks.
“Teenagers,” Sherlock adds, brushing his gloved fingers over the medley of automobile skeletons soldered and riveted together in the name of fun. He ducks under a gnarled tailpipe. “Misguided youth.”
He buys a sombrero.
“Wraith. Those things on the horses in the movie you made me sit through.”
his Death Wish.
John shouldn’t be encouraging him. He really shouldn’t. But he can’t help himself. Who could? Honestly? Sherlock, even at his most vulnerable, is conscious of every word, gesture, thought. He never does or says or thinks for the hell of it. So John can understand the attraction; why Sherlock turned to cocaine in his youth.
"So it would seem." Sherlock grabs his coat, switching his phone from one hand to the other so he can slide his arms into the sleeves. "You ran into him on your way to see Lestrade."
“You just kissed Molly Hooper.”

is the rub.
. Sherlock as John once remembered him annuls the fear of losing his shit. He fights to sustain the phantasm with the desperation of a drowning man, willing Sherlock to linger because no blood, no broken pieces, all there was and will be no more.
John is sexual. Sherlock is asexual. This is the first and most insignificant setback in a series of impediments for them as a…Sherlock shudders at the word
he pens over Sherlock’s tidy scrawl.
“From a splinter? Hardly.”
“You know. On a scale of one to ten. Ten being absurdly romantic and perfect and everything.”
"What. Like, buried treasure? Are you going to make me dig for it?"
I've decided the best I'll be able to promise you guys is one chapter a week during Prom/Wedding Season Apocalypse 2013. (March, April, and May.) This one is short, unfortunately, but starting next week my chapters will be longer (hopefully) and more consistent (hopefully). Thank you for your patience. You all are due a surprise and--while it is taking a while--I will inform you that John plus Sherlock plus formalwear is coming along nicely.
Sherlock is offended. An indignant stiffening of his spine. “Do you regret coming here with me?” he wonders. He can feel John shake his head between his shoulder blades. Lips branding his nape with languid kisses.
John is laughing in spite of himself. How extensively did Sherlock tamper with his mobile?
Twenty-six texts between the two of them. Catch 22. Sherlock doesn’t want the hailstorm of congratulations and well wishes to affect his thinking, but also doesn’t want to turn off his phone should Lestrade require his assistance. Moans with each new message. Puts Irene Adler to shame.
“Mine,” Sherlock is proud to announce. His chest heaving. The buttons of his shirt biting into his skin. “You’re mine.”
of John's onerous typing douses him with relief.
John drops the pamphlet on the floor. He’s not sure where to start because the instructions are in Chinese. “Remind me why you destroyed your old table?”
“I’m going to ignore your sarcasm in lieu of
Sherlock is refulgent and pale, surrounded by women dressed in bedazzled eveningwear. In his veins courses the fire of his city, his circulatory system a percussive map of London’s streets. Seventy-two beats per minute.
The question is: Why would Mycroft care?
I have no excuse this time. I'm just lazy.
Sherlock wonders.
Sherlock is writhing internally. John’s strong arms circling his chest, holding him close, and Sherlock would rather John punch him in the face. It would hurt less.
He weighs and considers. (
“Statistically speaking, two to three percent of prison deaths are the direct result of homicide.”
“This will probably come as no surprise to you, John, but I’m not the most compassionate person in London.”
John enters the kitchen, bags of groceries in his hands.
That queer gleam again.
Sherlock gasps for breath.
Mycroft quirks his eyebrows. Folds his hands neatly in his lap. “John,” he admonishes. “Don’t be ridiculous. You know me better than that.” A beat of strategic silence. “I won’t just break you. I will eviscerate you.”
“Mycroft’s taken care of the necessary legalities,” Sherlock exhales, his voice barely above a whisper. Swallows. “All that’s left is our signatures.” Looks into John’s eyes. John’s astonishingly blue eyes. And it all becomes very real, suddenly. As real as lapis lazuli and marigold and Sherlock succumbs to John’s gravitational pull. Noting the premature crowsfeet, the fading tan, the grey hairs, and he wants to absorb it all at the same time and never come up for air. “Say the word,” he hears himself speak, but his voice sounds far away. Too wrapped up in John’s eyelashes, his breath puffing against Sherlock’s mouth, drowning in the details. “And I’m yours forever.”
They’ve been sleeping together. It’s obvious. Of course it’s obvious. Everybody knows it. Neither perpetrator attempts to hide the evidence of their lovemaking. They cast furtive glances at each other all morning, over breakfast. Sherlock feels no need to point out their indiscretion. Because it would invite animosity on his part and because he wishes to survey them undisturbed. They appear to be happy. Giggling into their porridge. Eyes bright, cheeks flush.
Sherlock’s mobile rings.
“This wasn’t a date,” Sherlock says, bemused.
“A bit.”
“Nevermind.” John leaves for work.
Sherlock hops in behind him. Or, well. Not hop. Sherlock doesn't hop. He's too graceful to hop. He bounds. Or springs. Or something.
“How long are we staying?”
“He sends his regards,” Sherlock grumbles.
They stand together, conversing on a level unremitting. Their love masquerades as an alleyway, winding strategically around Sherlock’s heart.
Sherlock has a Mycroft.
Sherlock has never generated anything more beautiful.
Sherlock helps John up the stairs. He hums his acquiescence while he picks John’s coat off his shoulders. Steers John toward the couch. Not the least bit surprised when he starts snoring before his head hits the Union Jack pillow.
John looks at him with eyes so heavy with emotion they start to shine, to overflow, complementing a smile as catching as the rest of him.
Branded on the inside of his skull. On the backs of his eyeballs. Searing, hot. Tears trickle down his face when a familiar presence offers him sweet, sweet relief. His mind, barreling, helter-skelter, off the tracks, off the map. Falling, plummeting into a ruinous abyss. Chartreuse and calm and quiet and he can’t resist the call of the void.
“Drugs are bad. Don’t use them,” Sherlock instructs. “Unless you can get away with it.”
“Just in case,” Sherlock finds himself agreeing.
“Yes,” Sherlock murmurs. Like he knows. But he would. And will. Always will.
John fails to make Sherlock understand the concept of
“What a punch.”
“That’s preposterous.”
“There you are,” Sherlock may or may not speak aloud. John can’t be sure.
Shit just got realer.
“Stitches are superficial.” Sherlock laughs mirthlessly, slamming the door closed. Locks them inside. “So help me, John. If you die—“ He’s at a loss for words. Sherlock is rarely, if ever, at a loss of words. Crowds John where he sits. His bony knees grinding John’s legs into the side of the table. “I hope it was worth it. Brilliant. Really.”
“This is me propositioning you.”
John’s back cracks satisfyingly. He smiles when he hears Mrs. Hudson’s ineffable “Hoo-hoo!” upon letting herself inside. “I brought you boys a little snack.”
“That’s for the knickering.”
Sherlock simulates distress, leaving the table. Head bowed, feints left, tackling the German out of his chair before he can put a bullet through his wife’s head.
John enables him. Makes Sherlock regard himself in a new light. Like he’s worth it.
Sherlock narrows his eyes and Mycroft sighs. More bullets. A cache.
John walks into the bathroom. Undoing the buttons of his shirt.
“I’m afraid I would keep you anyway,” Sherlock blurts. He’s surprised to hear himself divulge this heretofore heavily guarded secret. A bit not good. Admitting he would hold John hostage against his will. Because he would. Or not. Probably not. But he’d try. For a while. Sherlock swallows his uncertainty. Tastes like mercury. Vexed and impatient, he snaps, “Say something!”
Sherlock turns his head. “Can’t what?” His heart does not belong in his throat. How? When? Why is his heart in his throat?
John falters, but only for a second. Stands his ground and squares his jaw against the heat rising in his cheeks. “What?”
“Shut up,” Sherlock snaps. “It’s half ten in the morning,” White-knuckling the sheets, shoulders tense. Hair in disarray. “I can’t do this.”
“I would have you be the death of me,” Sherlock admits. All the social conventions wither and die because that’s a bit
“Oh, c’mon.” John drops his hand and nudges a potato. “I skive off and solve crimes with you all the time.”
Sherlock huffs, not without humor. “Like I said. I care absolutely nothing about my public image.”
“Victor is trying to convince me I’m their hero. Thinks it will persuade me to lecture them about not abusing drugs and stranger danger—“ (John sucks on his lips to keep from snorting.) “—and looking both ways before crossing the street…”
“It really isn’t.” John smirks. “Donovan?”
“Okay.”
Tears and sweat and Sherlock pleading with John under his breath, “Get it out.” Sherlock buries his face in John’s neck. Clutches at his jumper, curling in on himself. He trembles from exertion so John holds him. He just holds him. And he feels as helpless now as he did when he was shot, left for dead. Runs his hands up and down Sherlock’s back, the ridges of his spine piercing his heart like a barrage of bullets burning hot in the Afghan sun.
Intimacy. Something Sherlock never thought he’d have with anyone. Willingness to allow a man like John Watson to breach the icy walls around his heart. Doesn’t remember the exact moment a conscious decision was made, but stubbornly refusing to aid John in his efforts to form a bond, a link, a connection, and failing miserably. With his stupid unconditional love Sherlock not only managed to accept, to desire, but replicate in under twenty-four hours.
Nothing, as of yet, has given him any reason to put faith in such an ill-defined emotion. Love is patient, love is kind. Love is privy to murder. Love is the soft, white underbelly of altruism. Jealousy and illusions of control. Love is more than vicious, it’s an excuse. An excuse to screen calls, dictate wardrobes. Batter and bruise. An excuse not to be alone.
) “If you choose to take liberties, I will be forced to retaliate, John.”
John waits.
John chuckles. “Wanker.”
John kisses him. Sudsy tongue leaving residue of his morning ablutions on Sherlock’s lips. “Turnabout’s fair play.”
Sherlock frowns at his mirror image. No. Not an option. He will be polite. He will be courteous. He will endeavor to pretend he’s having the time of his life. John’s worth it.
“Good.” Sherlock taps his mobile once more and straddles Deez’s lap as the first notes of
A companion piece to Mozzarella.
No answer.
John prods at his crows feet. Frowns at his reflection. Sherlock watches him from his chair, slightly confused. John is not a vain man. He is, however, subject to hubris, which Sherlock has come to associate with men of John’s stature and profession. But John isn’t most men. He dresses for comfort and convenience, not fashion. An almost Spartan lifestyle, really. And Sherlock’s brains, his cleverness, have never—not once—been seen as a threat. John finds him amazing. Spectacular.
For a second.
has been marked out.
John kisses Sherlock in earnest.
John sincerely hopes not. Besides,
Is the exception.
Scanning! In the middle of a row! John wonders what Sherlock finds so bloody interesting before the world’s only consulting detective wrinkles his nose, leans forward, and kisses him.
John takes a pen out of his pocket. He draws a skull in the window of the homey cottage in the corner of the painting. “There. That’s more like it. More you.”
Sherlock trails after him, face flushed. He leaves his mobile on the sink.
. Chasing the mouse under—
at John. Saying a million things and saying nothing at all. Marriage has not been a topic of discussion since the night Sherlock instinctively proposed. Since the day John said yes to more than pizza. They’ve lived together, worked together in (mostly) harmony for years. If it’s not broke, don’t fix it.
A hypnic jerk. A gasp. Opaque visions of tea lights and boiled shrimp dispersing as he wakes from a hellish nightmare. Sherlock stares at the ceiling from his supine position on the couch. The familiar
He bites his lip and–
Immeasurable. John is so much bigger, so much greater than the melanin of his hair, the marrow of his bones. His eyes are the ocean, his skin is the desert. Sherlock could fall into him and never find his way out. Sometimes, he thinks he already has.
“So?” he prompts.
Leeds John’s acerbic cocktail of multi-surface cleaners can be called thoughtful. What John doesn’t know can’t—
face, which normally leads to prohibition including—but not limited to—nicotine patches, severed heads, and combustible materials.
John checks his pulse. Fixes the collar of Sherlock’s robe. Rubs his thumb under Sherlock’s eyes, noting the evidence of discoloration from lack of sleep. Tuts his disappointment, but he’s smiling. He leads Sherlock to where the bed (was) in reality and Sherlock follows. Drops his guard wholly and without hesitation.
I really suck at this updating daily thing. I'll try to do better.
Next preview: Dark, teen love, angst, kissing in the rain. John almost wonders if it’s the same movie aside from the fact that the actors are different.
Sherlock stops short when he hears the lift chime at the end of the corridor. The doors slide open to reveal none other than Anderson. He’s reviewing some sort of pamphlet so he hasn’t noticed them yet.
. Against his hip, under his knee.
Sherlock tells the cabbie, "Musgrave Manor," when he climbs into the backseat. John wants to question Sherlock. Manor? What manor? What's at a manor? They're not staying there, are they? Is this about the case? Is it murder? Murder at a manor? Is Sherlock playing Cluedo in real life? Sherlock can read John's unspoken questions in the flicker of his eyelashes and the number of times he clenches his fist. Chuckles darkly. Smug-arse bastard.
“John belongs to me, Mycroft.”
He doesn’t care, he doesn’t care,
“Because there’s no one else,” Sherlock says.
“Why else would you ask such a tedious question?”
“Fellatio,” Sherlock hums.
And it’s John, John, John. Over and over and over again until Sherlock is speaking his name with such reverence. Tightens his grip. The wool of his jumper beneath his fingernails.
John crawls up Sherlock’s body. And—
That doesn’t stop Sherlock from kissing John again. And that doesn’t stop John from letting him.
Sherlock unplugs the memory stick. “We’re done here. Come on.” Steers John outside. His face hurts from the effort not to laugh. John’s chortling enough for the both of them.
Then,
John counters with,
. Heaven or hell, Sherlock honestly doesn’t care. The question of God does not appeal to him simply because there isn’t enough data and there never will be enough data. Holy wars and hate crimes are intriguing in and of themselves, but teenagers precede religion as a whole on his list of
Something is definitely amiss when Sherlock kisses Molly Hooper over a dead body.
“Oh, Sherlock. You believe yourself to be in love with him, don’t you?”
No tomes with feathers or bones bookmarking his favorite passages, his favorite anything.
Sherlock deposits his half-empty glass on a passing tray without looking. He doesn’t need to, really. He’s consciously aware of everyone in the room, regardless of their position on his Relevance Scale because
But no. He still marvels at John. Still loves himself.
Sherlock goes on and on and on. While John cooks, while John eats, while John watches telly, even while John bathes.
“Shut up.”
Just. Don’t.
John smiles. “I know what you’re thinking.”
Sherlock is amused. John is irritated.
Sherlock feels, and he’s pretty sure he’s feeling the hell out of it.
John swallows. He can feel heat rising in his face, pooling between his legs. His mouth is full of saliva at the thought of seeing even a hint of Sherlock’s naked body.
“No such thing,” Sherlock tells his clavicle.
“Where have you been?”
Sherlock grabs John’s hand.
John tries to tune Sherlock out. Sadly, Sherlock is tune-out proof. John has yet to determine how or why. It may be his Alan Rickman-esque baritone that demands attention. May be that his presence is commanding to the nth degree. To the point where pedestrians ignorant of the infamy of
John looms, bracing his arms on either side of Sherlock’s shoulders. He hasn’t fallen asleep yet. Or he stirred awake when John regained consciousness. John wouldn’t have bothered saying “Hi.” otherwise.
“I do.” It warms a part of John’s heart to hear Victor support Sherlock. Until he says: “John does.”
Thank you everyone for your continued patience. And for catching my awful mistakes. Spell check has obviously made me very lazy. =)
. He tosses bandages, sutures, ointments, and a stethoscope over his shoulder. John reflexively catches the more fragile of the salves.
He’s desperate. Skin itching, crawling, host to microscopic insets Sherlock tears at with his fingernails. Gouging channels, bleed them out. He steadies himself against the wall. Cold, brick, damp. The smell of mildew and vomit and other bodily fluids he’s probably standing in because his shoes are sticky.
“I’m ribbing you.” John tries to dodge a bullet, “I know that wasn’t your A game.”
Sherlock is not a romantic.
.” Sherlock sits on the sofa, his chin cradled atop his thumbs and his mouth hidden behind his intertwined fingers. “Pray tell.”
John is grinding his teeth. Mycroft is probably sucking on a toffee.
Sherlock eases his grip. “I would find that man and make him beg for mercy.”
“The lava game.”
John huffs.
“All the joys of parenthood, but none of the responsibility.”
“No, Sherlock, you’re wrong. You mean codeword.”
“I wasn’t aware Dr. Watson’s sexual orientation included men.”
again.)
"I'm for a shower," John says.
The next morning, John finds Sherlock asleep under the covers wearing nothing but his pants. At some point during the night, John assumes he solved whatever it was that needed solving and—dispossessing himself of sleep for three days straight—assented to crash in John’s room, forsaking his pajamas en lieu of shucking his very expensive clothing at the foot of John’s bed. They sleep together every once in a while. Amorous activities, no cases to solve, but the sight of Sherlock’s messy head of hair resting on John’s pillow is still a novelty.
He keeps them to remind himself that love—or what workaday people call love—is, at its core, deception. Flattery, sweet nothings, please. Sherlock takes the letters and tosses them in the fire, which is always lit. The paper turns to ash, tendrils of smoke, and the sentiments contained within burst into flames.
Sherlock scoffs. “Nice. Nice is a word used to describe one of your dull acquaintances or your great aunt Silvia’s handmade doilies.” He taps a beat on the doorknob, his patience wearing thin. “John, you didn’t have to accompany me if that’s what you’re getting at.”
Sherlock grouses. Or tires to grouse. Sounds like he’s caught between being incommoded and aroused. Frowns when John appreciates his sensitivity with an ‘mhm’ of his own, eyes twinkling. “You’re heavy.”
. A pathetic argument. While it’s true they do not in fact date, their romantic relationship is subject to change. Just like everything else on the face of the Earth. Logic eases Sherlock’s mind, but not his respiratory system. So he nods.
“Obviously.”
“Yes. Alright.” John fights the urge to yank his covers from under Sherlock and pull them over his head. “Thinking cap, on.”
John shrugs his shoulders. Ambles around the room with his hands in his pockets. “I wouldn’t say harass.” It’s only natural for civilians to ask him questions:
“No, it’s—“ The ability to speak a complete sentence seems to have abandoned them both. Sherlock is panting, John is panting, and they cling to one another like they’ll fly to pieces if they let go. Too warm and distinctly uncomfortable and love coils heavy in John’s chest, taut between his ribs. He wants he choke on it. Lose himself in it. Because something—
Sherlock honestly wouldn’t have it any other way.
Then his skin. Less words and an onslaught of More.
“Mm,” Sherlock concurs.
“Where th’ hell did you get an

is where Mycroft fails to understand. Sherlock is already addicted. Wholly and completely.
Over and over and over again until Sherlock is speaking his name with reverence. Woolen jumper beneath his fingernails.
“Later. I’ll explain everything later…”
Sherlock shrugs his shoulders. Gouges the dead skin around his big toe.
In Sherlock’s opinion, it’s a mistake to theorize without all the facts. “John is characteristically romantic in his depiction of me and my work. And the papers? Oooh,” he purrs. “Must be true.”
Which is why he buys the ring. Because why in the hell not?
I'm typing directly into the Chapter Text box so don't be alarmed if there are more typos than usual. Thank you for your patience! And for the lovely advice and reminders to back up my documents. You live and you learn. Then you die and forget it all.

.) “I had the worst day. Then you—“ He snorts. “—
Juliet’s speech is considered a soliloquy because she thinks she’s alone.
His fingers dance around his neck, over his clavicle, to the collar of his shirt, which he unbuttons, undulating once again. His body begging, begging,
“We could call it Gladstone.”
“Why the headphones?”
Somewhere, deep down, John knows this is no chance encounter. This.
Sherlock blinks at him.
Sherlock is a loser. Because love is a chemical defect found on the losing side. Because John Watson has somehow, someway wormed himself not only inside Sherlock’s heart, but also inside Sherlock’s head—where it matters. He can feel him there behind his waking eyes. A visceral rhythm pounding and pounding in the environs of his sinus cavity. Bright. Beautiful. Loud. Sherlock, more than once, is confident he’s hallucinating. That he’s been drugged. Tripping on acid or cocaine. Jonesing for nicotine at the very least.
John’s noblesse oblige waylays the common cold. Makes his eyes water and his ears roar. He does not force himself inside Mrs. Hudson’s home even though he wants to yank the landline off the wall. Does not chastise Sherlock for speaking with he whom John henceforth refers to as
John marvels. Never, not once, has Sherlock attempted to tell a joke so far removed from the spectrum of gallows humor. He opens and closes his mouth, unsure.
“We’re ruining the furniture.”
Mouths another
Alienating.
A knock on the door diverts Sherlock’s attention. Mycroft strides into the flat at his leisure as if he owns the place, ubiquitous umbrella hanging on the crook of his arm. “Don’t we look sharp,” he pontificates, but his smile is genuine. “Your chariot awaits, gentlemen.”
Slim sullenly nurses his beer while Hotty elbows him in the ribs.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “
“Speaking of favors…” Victor purrs. “Will you think about it?”
They gravitate toward one another like they’re following a script. Written and revamped beyond comperhension, memorized to the letter. Their legs tangle, skin on skin. John breathes in and Sherlock breathes out.
John says, “Run away with me.”
John giggles. “I can’t tell. Is that a smoldering look or is he constipated?”
“I mean. I wasn’t.” John clears his throat. “It’s not very you, is it?”
. “…acquaintance, you will not recover.”
“What now?” John asks as they wheel their new belongings toward the complimentary taxi.
“You know that wouldn’t save you, right? And what am I doing on the ground?”
“Do you care?”
John pointedly inhales and exhales.
Yes. Okay. Yes. Whatever John wants.
One week. Two weeks go by.
“Ah!” Sherlock’s eyes widen. Prodding again. “Aurora Borealis.” His fingertips supplement, probing the corners of John’s eyes. “Pretty.”
“Twilight?” John hisses between his teeth. And it’s more than a little sad he’s familiar with the genre. “No. We’re here to see
“Unless you intend to help instruct me on the unimaginative task of swapping saliva with a murderous vamp, I suggest you shut up.”
“Sherlock?” John is standing in the doorway, one hand holding a clipboard and the other resting on the door handle. “What are you doing here?”
John doesn’t look at him when he explains, “The website said it’s better to cook them alive.”
“What moron told you that?”
Sherlock frowns at his mirror image. No. Not an option. He will be polite. He will be courteous. He will endeavor to pretend he’s having the time of his life. John’s worth it.
“What happened to the exterminator?”
John finishes preparing the tea. Arranges their cups side by side. He does not wait for Sherlock to acknowledge his proximity because Sherlock’s perception of time is damnably skewed when he’s working and it’s likely John will be waiting on Sherlock’s consent for twenty-plus minutes if that's the case. John nuzzles Sherlock’s temple with the end of his nose. Brushes his lips against the lobe of his ear.
Sherlock retains valuable information from each case he solves. Bits and pieces here and there, whatever strikes him as largely pertinent. For John? Sherlock’s dedicated more space on his hard drive than is necessary for one person. And he periodically makes room for more.
Breathes deep. Evaluates the stages of sleep John undergoes in the wee hours of the morning. Spectral headlights span across the walls like some kind of Arthurian beast John always goes on and on about.

“Oh, they live forever. Sex must never turn boring after five hundred years.”
"You're the exception," he voices the last thought aloud.
is supposed to be. Typically, John buys classic scents. Something moderately cheap and accessible. He doesn’t question Sherlock’s choice, though. “Nutmeg, Cedar, and Brazilian Rosewood, John!” brooks no arguments.
Mrs. Hudson releases John with gargantuan effort. Turns to Sherlock. Face blotched and grinning big and Sherlock recoils. Blanches when she lands a wet kiss on his cheek.
"'Course." Sherlock blinks at him lazily. "Do you think I flew you to Paris for a case?"
John chuckles. Sherlock frowns against his hair.
That’s all. Just. Him.
Just in time!
“Right.” John clears his throat. Raps his knuckles on the paneled window separating Mycroft and himself from the nameless/faceless chauffer. He climbs out of the car when it rolls to a stop, but before he slams the door in Mycroft’s face, he impresses upon him, “I love your brother. And I don’t give a damn if you approve or not because this…” He’s growling now. “…
But no. He can’t.
Gaiety countermands the fear of faulty equipment. Morons.
Sherlock sighs audibly, “John.”
Sherlock’s eyebrows disappear behind his fringe.
John will not be stunned right now. He can be stunned later. “Nice try,” he says. “Won’t work.”
“You stink,” John says fondly. Doesn’t prevent him from sticking his nose in that spot behind Sherlock’s ear. Sighing heavily against his grimy skin. “I stink.”
“Good. Be ready at noon.”
They're just this side of uncontrobable laughter.
John is terrified again.
John has to see this. He opens the shower curtain again to ask the name of his front so he can look up Sherlock’s ‘egregious profile’, but Sherlock already has the page loaded on his mobile, thrust under John’s nose.

John pauses for thought. “Yes, I think so.” Sweeps the trash in the bin beside the loo. “Only one thing can make it better.”

“You could’ve died,” John interrupts Sherlock’s commentary, eyes trained on nothing outside. His hands ball into fists.

He’s not dead, as indicated by the sigh muted against the leather cushions.

“Lestrade would help me hide the evidence,” John tries to speak. The result is:
“Sounds like you dropped something. You okay?”
John has noticed. “Well. It’s sort of a family friendly film. I think.”
Sherlock grabs John’s forearm. John sighs into his pillow.
John touches his forehead. Hisses. Fingers return tipped with blood. “Nice.”
Sherlock objects to desperate.
Sherlock, who never imagined someone—anyone—could (or would) worship him so shamelessly.
A touch. A caress.
John whips his head around. No use in denying it. “I–yes.”

Sarah’s chair is empty.
. A pathetic argument, really. While it’s true they do not, in fact, date, their romantic relationship (Sherlock mentally recoils at the term.) is subject to change. Just like everything else on the face of the Earth. Logic eases Sherlock’s mind, but not his respiratory system. So he nods.
Sherlock replies as John resuscitates a part of him he didn’t know he had.
Not weird in a bad way, weird in an
“You already know me,” Sherlock complains quietly.
Sherlock strikes back three weeks later. John suspects nothing.
Sherlock regains his balance. His orbit. His sun.
John is wearing his best trousers, a suitable dinner jacket, an unassuming dress shirt, and a powder blue ascot. It’s the most daring accessory John owns.
John reads the sticky note in reference to the milk. Worries his bottom lip between his teeth. Bites down hard to stymie foul language swarming inside his mouth. He slams the refrigerator door shut.
“Samantha.”
“Fine. Okay. But your voice? His face? Not seeing it.”
“I’m reading a text.”

“You Googled
Sherlock congratulates himself on the metaphor, sliding down John’s chest and his belly and sitting in John’s lap and
“Well, you’re doubly amazing.” John drags his nose through Sherlock’s hair, across his forehead. Plants a kiss on the bridge of his nose. Then down, down, returning to Sherlock’s lips and they welcome him back with languid enthusiasm. “God, your mouth,” John continues to lavish Sherlock with compliments. “Your eyes,” he says, pulling back far enough to look into them. “You’re beautiful.”
A mouse scampers across the living room floor and disappears amongst Sherlock’s discarded sheet music.
I'm currently using a random-word generator for drabble prompts. If you would like me to experiment with a certain word, message me. Because it sounds like fun.
A pang of what may or may not be sympathy. Sherlock helps himself to some roast to make amends. It seems to please John in some form or fashion because he stops playing with his food and starts cutting into it. For a few minutes, the only sound between the two of them consists of the clinking of their cutlery. They don’t look at each other while they eat. Comfortable silence swathes Sherlock’s prickly disposition and John’s low spirits. The longer they share their meal, their unspoken camaraderie, the more comfortable they feel.
and I meant it.”
Bird immediately leaves the room.
Sherlock can feel the tremor in John’s hand. His cock answers in kind, twitching sympathetically.
Sherlock rakes his fingers through his hair, tangle in his soppy curls. John’s words bandage the evidence of insults past. Enfold him, a second skin, and it’s John’s assertions how he’s fantastic, brilliant, and marvelous that support Sherlock as he shrugs off the
John’s nose whistles in Sherlock’s ear. Broken. Probably. John promises, “I’m okay.” Then, “You’re okay.”
“Thank you, Molly,” Sherlock purrs. Like she’s offered to fetch him a cup of coffee and not involuntarily succumbed to whatever social experiment he has up his sleeve. “Text me the results.” He spins on his heel, bidding John to follow.
John offers him a smile. Sherlock returns it.
“No, you didn’t.” John tosses the Union Jack pillow on the floor between the coffee table and his chair. “Go on, then.”
and you are over
John is tucked against his side. One arm draped across his waist. Kisses the back of his neck. “I’m sorry,” he says against Sherlock’s skin. “I can’t…”
The first preview plays. Dark, teen love, angst, kissing in the rain. Sherlock makes gargling noises throughout. “Are you trying to kill me? I think you’re trying to kill me.”
