John reaches over and puts a hold on the beeping machine.  "I'll get you some ice, pain medication and…"  John wants to take a pen light to examine Sherlock's eyes, wants to examine every inch of him .  "I'll get your nurse."
“They said he’d be out for a while yet,” Mycroft walks up to Sherlock’s bedside and takes his brother’s hand for a brief moment.
Mycroft grips the handle of his umbrella tightly.  Takes a deep breath in and lets it out.  "Greg loves his job. He is good at it.  He's worked his entire adult life to build up a reputation.  Tomorrow all of that is gone.  He's the gay detective."  Mycroft winces, "The dick that likes dick."
“I think she just might be able to do it,” John quips as he tries to commit everything about Lestrade’s condition to memory. He’s managed to escape interrogation once. He doubts he’ll be as lucky again. “I am familiar with his condition. I’d be happy to answer any questions…”
He looked down at his body, at the cloth that surrounded it, trapped it.  He tore at it desperate to be free, snapped at it, bit at it.  He growled in frustration at the bonds that entrapped him.  The growl ignited some long forgotten sense in him and his whole body tensed and flexed at once, expanding upward and outward.  He stretched and his clothes ripped away.  Free.  Cold.   Another growl escaped his throat, he pawed at the ground, clawed at the ground.  He shivered, the hair came up on his pale white skin.  Not enough.   He shook violently like a dog just out of the bath and the hairs kept coming, a few strands, a few patches, and finally thick golden fur.
"It is late.  You haven't slept.  If you want to get some rest, my assistant will alert you to any chance in Sherlock's condition.  You won't have much chance once he wakes up."
“He is very good at knowing only what he wishes to know.”  Mycroft bites his lip, “and I suppose I am very good at keeping things from him, from everybody…  It seemed better that way.”
John returns his attention to the physician.  “Yes, DI Lestrade.”   He hates himself for forgetting about Lestrade.
“Your brother?  We are moving him to his room now.   Somebody will be out to get you shortly.”  The doctor is gone before they can ask another question.
Sherl…--  He’s texting when he hears a knock at the door.  “Sherlo…”  No, Sherlock wouldn’t knock.  He opens the door.  Mycroft stands in the entryway.
John frustration is mounting but visiting hours were almost over. He could go in at any time but if he has any hope of getting Mycroft in there in the next four hours he has to go now. “I’m going to tell him you’re a coward. Do you want him to hear that?”
"He will need a good deal of support." John doesn't want to make promises he can't keep, but he does know what Lestrade needs, will need.  Knows what he needed, anyway.  "Not just in the physical sense."
"We have been here a full day, John.  We've not slept.  We've not changed clothes.  Surely, we can be spared one last indignity."
A deep baying answered them and john set off in the lead.   He sensed something strange and familiar in the air.  A musky wild scent that reminded him of childhood, that reminded him the dawn of time.     He moved towards that scent.  Faster.  As fast as his legs could carry him.  It wasn't fast enough.   He needed to go faster.  He needed to be free.
"Not for her. She is a terrible cook, she has a bit of excess body hair, but I swear to you that she isn't a werewolf!"  John grabbed the phone back, angrily.
John takes his seat at Sherlock's bedside.  "I'm back."  He rubs the back of Sherlock's hand, careful of the ivs and wires.   "I have so many things I want to say to you, but first I need you to wake up.  So just wake up."
“Fine?”  He nearly laughs but stops himself.  “He’ll be fine.”   Tears threaten to fall.  He doesn’t look away.  “Mycroft he’ll…”
“I don’t know.”    John follows him down to the car.  It’s windy, cold.  It’s freezing.  He didn’t grab a coat.  He doesn’t care.
“She liked the gloves?”   John heard the footsteps coming up behind him.  He isn’t surprised.   He is surprised not to be surprised.
“My parents married…”  John shook his head.  “No, they were married 5 years before Harriet came along.”
The idea of what Mycroft’s version of wall shooting might entail preoccupies his mind for some time.
"In your own time then."  John mutters, a slight edge of worry disguised as bitterness.  "Like always."
The food really does taste good, like a small life preserver in the middle of the ocean.   Food always tastes better to the hungry.
"Thank you," he almost whispers in the direction of the nurse then turns sad eyes on John and his companion, "Now I believe we were going to get some tea.   There is a rather fine bakery down the street.  I'll have some things brought in."
But after a few bites, his body unsatiated, but past a danger can no longer stomach any of it.  He pushes his plate away and notices the others have made very little progress on their own.
“I would like that,” she answers softly. “But first…” she takes a deep breath, “you’ll introduce me to him? I think it’s time.”
"Easy."   Sherlock stepped out of the pool. "You must be starving.  And we can have some meat. I ordered steaks from room service.   But first i think we should maybe have a bath."
“There is nothing I can do for him, or for Sherlock.  The Met ran in the shooter before we’d even arrived at the hospital.  Greg would want it that way.  So, I suppose my not interfering is something.  They are doing a blood drive in his name, it’s all over the news,” he holds up his phone, “and I can’t even participate in that.  I know hundreds of people, John.  I like a half dozen or so.  I love three.   Two of them are in this hospital and I am useless.”
"Who writes these websites?   Wolfsbane is a poison.  What if somebody tried that because they wanted to look like that guy teen girls  from that movie teen girls like?  Kids could die, Sherlock."
“Little late for that,” She focuses her attention on her injured son, “I don’t want him to be alone.”
Sherlock backed slowly away.  "John.  It is me.  Sherlock.  Your friend.  You are a man.  You are a doctor.  You are not an animal.  You can control this."
Mycroft shrugs, “I am afraid the matter remained unresolved when I returned to school for the start of term.”
“Sherlock did what Sherlock does.   He left. “ Mycroft groans as the car pulls to a stop.  A red light.  It’s not the first.  “We need a siren.”  Mycroft takes out his phone and presses a series of keys.   John can’t be bothered to figure out which.
John tries not to watch.  For all of Mycroft's theatrics, he is a private, quiet man.  Allowing his most private moments to be displayed for two virtual strangers feels wrong to John.
He’s never been afraid of the sight of blood.   He’s never shied away from an injured man.  He’s never been made sick by the condition of a body found at a crime scene.
“Are you him?” A small gray haired woman asks as soon as John enters Lestrade’s room. Her tone is accusatory. It startles him.
"How can anything be useful about werewolves.  They are myths.   You get bit by one you become one.  You have a parent who is one, you become one.  You munch on some wolfsbane in the moonlight… and as a physician I cannot recommend it… You might, maybe, possibly become a werewolf."   John gaped.
He expects Mycroft to jump in every few words with questions, but the man sits patiently his blue eyes focused, concentrating, absorbing every word as John goes over it all, the broken ribs, the collapsed lung, the bone fragments they removed from his lung, the bullet fragments they’ve removed from his spinal column, the  potential for nerve damage, the problem of swelling and the seemingly minor injury to his knee.
John doesn’t realize he’s nodded off in his chair until he’s startled awake by a soft rap on the room’s partially open door.  “Dr. Watson?”
"It will relax you."  Sherlock assured him.   "Salt water will heal your wounds."  Sherlock sat beside John and placed a hand on the bruised patch of John's skin right above his heart where the first shot hit.
Mycroft’s car is warm.  Too warm.    “What happened?  I had a shift at the surgery.  A patient had to be transferred to hospital.  I stay…”    Emotion creeps into John’s voice.  He coughs.  He looks away.
He takes a look at the x-rays and they are familiar, unremarkable, yet completely new.  He’s a little at sea.  He’s treated these wounds in an army of men paraded through his operating theatre.   This is a single man, a man he knows.  He has stood beside this man on a very different battlefield.  This man fell beside Sherlock.  His injuries could have been, maybe should have been, his own..
“Your patient is out of surgery.”  John looks quickly at Sherlock’s sleeping body before remembering Lestrade.   He looks to the corner where Mycroft had been seating.   Mycroft is gone.   “Yes?”
"I left him in your care, Mr. Holmes. I let you both be.  Now he's broken.  I think you've done more than enough."
"It is all that I have."  Mycroft bites his bottom lip.  "John, Anthea is waiting outside.  She'll get you back to Sherlock's room.  Thank you."
John picked up the scent of iron now  His stomach growled.  He saw the wound on Sherlock's shoulder and licked his lips, hungry, starving.
“For your sister, her 41st”   Mycroft  starts towards a table.   John understands he is supposed to follow.  He hasn’t paid for his order.   He doesn’t think he’s supposed to.
“I will out myself, John, to anybody in the world. But you cannot ask me to out him to his mother. It’s different.”
John stands in line at a café inside a large department store.   He needs a gift for Harry.   Her 40th birthday is tomorrow.  He hasn’t a clue what to get her.
John walks into the small private waiting room, astonished, but not really to find the table filled with a silver tea service and a wide array of pastry and other more savory small bites.
In some ways this part of his chosen profession had been easier when he served.   There was precious little interaction with the families of the gravely injured men in his care.  He’s not done this part in a very long time.
"I'm fine." John called, ego bruised more than his body.   He wiped the mud from his cheek as Sherlock doubled back and reached out his hand to help John up.   John slowly righted himself.  Sherlock studied the ground where John fell..
Sherlock slowly reached into his jacket pocket.  "It's okay.  It is going to be okay."  He tried to sound soothing.
Mycroft turns to the older woman, "I am so very sorry our meeting had to occur under these circumstances,"
He's not noticed hunger, but suddenly he's ravenous and he has to restrain himself from grabbing a little bit of everything all at once.    Suddenly he is reminded of decorum and turns to make sure that Lestrade's mother has made it into the room.
The door opens.   It’s the 245th time since they arrived in the waiting room.   John’s been counting.   He doesn’t look up.  “Holmes!”
"Wolf."  John took a deep breath.  The iron in Sherlock's blood intoxicated him, the salt repulsed him.  "I…."
Sherlock took John's hand and traced the outline of his nail beds.  They were red and raw where the thicker claws had pushed through.   "You…"
John knows he brought the nurses attention back around and he thinks he might deserve whatever punishment Mycroft deems worthy for this all too abrupt interruption.
“Still, I suspect it would be prudent to provide some reinforcement to your walls.  It wouldn’t do at all to strike down a passing pedestrian.”
“I didn’t know about you and Lestrade.”   John wonders if he should still be calling Lestrade Lestrade.   Sherlock and Gre… he recalls.   “I assumed… he wears a ring.  You both wear rings.”
John tenses, expecting Mycroft to pull some sort of rank, to threaten to relocate the woman and her entire life en masse to the coldest most isolated reaches of Siberia.  John starts towards the door trying to usher Mrs. Lestrade out of the room before she sees something that cannot be unseen.
John Watson is a doctor.   He’s seen plenty of injured, dying, and dead men before.   He’s seen men, barely out of school, laying open before him their insides shredded by shrapnel and known they were too far gone.  He has spent hours, days, weeks, months, years living and working amongst those injured and those healing.
"This is harder to tell just by looking, but this source things werewolves might have fur inside their skin.   Any chance your Aunt Gertrude…. " Sherlock
“Lestrade.  Lestrade got called away on a case, a double homicide.  He called Sherlock to do what Sherlock does.”
John nods, unsure of what meal they are nearest too, unsure of the last time he ate.   He's not given much thought to food since Mycroft's call and that feels like three lifetimes ago, but he wouldn't swear to it.
"Lestrade's… Greg's injuries are extensive.  The surgery he endured was a long one.  Assuming he can avoid infection, recovery will be long, slow, painful, and tedious."  John is too tired to pull punches.
When Sherlock was halfway through feeding him, John held up a hand to pause. He looked down and held his aching belly in both hands, lightly rubbing his fingers along his stretched skin to try and soothe it. He reached around to try and feel his navel, stretched tight and round from the pressure of the churning mass of food and water in his stomach.
Tonight, though. Tonight John felt the need to grow huge and heavy burn like fire deep in his gut. He wanted Sherlock’s hands to feel him swell. He wanted to push his belly out until it could burst, and then rub it and push it out fuller even more.
Sherlock opened his eyes, not realizing he’d closed them. The man was breathing hard and holding his belly with both hands, taking long, deep breaths that expanded his heavy body even more.
Nearly a full minute into the video, the man finally stepped forward and reached out to grab something on a table out of view. His bicep bulged as he held the full gallon of liquid in his hand. Sherlock could tell it wasn’t just pure milk – whatever was inside looked too dark, like some sort of powder had been mixed in. He rapidly scanned the way the man’s small, steady fingers gripped the handle as he shook the liquid inside.
He raised the bottle back to his mouth and continued, fighting past the aching clenching of his belly as it tried to resist the addition of anything more. He held the liter bottle with both hands, letting his belly hang free and heavy in front of him into Sherlock’s eager hands. They rubbed over the tight crest of his rounded stomach, lightly scratched his stretched sides and traced around his navel.
Sherlock took John’s fourth drained glass from his hands and turned him around before pulling John backwards against him. John reached his arms up and let Sherlock pull off his jumper, then leaned back against him and closed his eyes as Sherlock wrapped his arms around John’s chest, getting used to the feeling of being completely exposed.
Two swallows left, and John burned at the whines escaping his throat. The skin of his belly was taut and hot beneath his palm, swelling into his hand . . .
John did. He raised it to his lips and started to gulp, shivering when Sherlock’s hands reached around to the very tip of his belly, pushing his skin painfully against the pressure in his stomach and dipping inside the sensitive skin in his navel. John’s belly hung painfully out in front of him, swelling even more with each swallow of milk, pushing out and aching as it tried to make room to grow even fuller.
All of them titled simply the date they were taken, and all of them exactly three months apart. Sherlock could see, easily, the progress of how the man’s capacity had grown over the last three years, from the first video where his belly looked simply round after a full meal, to this last one, where he looked overly pregnant and struggling to remain standing.
Suddenly Sherlock came up behind him and wrapped his arms around John’s middle. They stood there for a minute with Sherlock’s cheek against John’s hair. Then slowly Sherlock’s hands shifted to underneath John’s jumper, and John leaned back against him, giving a silent ok.
He looked at his stuffed belly, his huge and heavy body. “Look what you did to yourself. . .” he moaned again, rubbing the top and sides. “Ruined yourself. . .your body –”
It had taken Sherlock almost a full twenty seconds to realize that the man in the video – his now confirmed killer – was rubbing an enormous belly with both of his hands while he loudly moaned, leaning back in the chair so his full skin stretched round and tight.
Desperate, Sherlock licked his own palm then rubbed it down along his cock, closing his eyes at the warmth thrumming along his erection. He wondered what it would feel like to press his cock against the man’s belly. If it would be hard and swollen enough for him to rut and rock against it until he came. If his semen would drip down the sides of the huge curve, making the taut skin glisten. If he could come right against the man’s sensitive navel while he clutched his belly and moaned for more – to be filled, and stretched, and heavy, and huge –
Sherlock’s mouse had been hovering over the ‘x’ to close the window when the soft sounds of the man’s pained breathing, followed by a long groan, had oozed through his earbuds. And then he’d frozen.
He grabbed the leftover packets of mentos and went straight for the fridge, where a liter of cola he’d been saving for three months from then beckoned to him now, calling to be gulped down and inhaled so he could be filled. He idly rubbed his tummy with one hand, soothing the skin, as he made his way into his tiny bedroom, containing nothing but a plain bed and a full length mirror.
“Shit,” he breathed. He rubbed the aching skin, wincing at the pain, then brought the bottle back to his lips. He felt like he would burst, like his body had grown and grown until there wasn’t any more room, any capacity.
Sherlock looked back at him waiting, one hand holding his and the other arm balancing a full plate of leftovers and a liter of soda water. John held a hand to his belly, feeling the solid, warm skin, and watched in the mirror as his fingers stretched around the new curve of his stomach. His heart beat madly in his chest, and he squeezed Sherlock’s hand.
Even an hour later, it was still swollen and hard, aching where the skin stretched along his sides to accommodate how much he’d grown while he swallowed down all the liquid he could physically hold.
“Oh,” Sherlock heard himself moan. He sat up quickly, then remembered he was completely alone. The man was over halfway finished with this second gallon, and he was starting to grunt under his breath as he rubbed his belly and scratched the stretching skin. He paused for a minute and pressed his palm right over his navel, where his belly stuck out the most. The muscles in his biceps flexed as he pressed, and Sherlock heard himself moan again when he saw that the skin of the man’s stomach had no give. That he was completely filled and stretched tight – unable to suck it in.
The man reached forward to set the empty jug down and looked down at his own bloated stomach. The longer he stood there, the rounder it got, as the liquid slowly filled out the bottom of his gut. He placed both of his hands on the bottom part of his belly, holding it gently between his palms before he started to rub along the exposed skin, stretching from his sides and out to the roundest curve of his filling belly. He stroked himself, looking down at his hands on his body, and Sherlock shivered at the quiet rasp of his palms across the skin.
He chewed the last few bites extra slowly, waiting for each bite to settle so his belly had time to pack more into its solid mass. By the time Sherlock placed the last piece of pasta between his lips, John audibly moaned as he swallowed. He leaned forward, cupping his belly gently with both hands as it ached, creaking and packed tight with liquid and food.
John’s skin was tingling with pleasure. He waddled to turn around and face Sherlock, clutching at his belly as he moved, and then brought Sherlock’s face down to kiss him hungrily, pressing his giant mass of a belly up against the flat plane of Sherlock’s stomach. He kissed him for a long time, feeling their bodies and skin brush up against one another.
“I’m too full,” he moaned, catching his breath as Sherlock thumbed across his dripping slit. “I’m massive. Too fucking huge.” John ran his hands along the full curve of his belly, starting from his chest, and whimpered at how far out his belly pushed. “My belly. . .” he moaned. “This belly. . . too full. . . Can’t move –”
Now, standing alone in the dim light of their bedroom, all John felt was fat and pudgy and completely unattractive. His belly which had been so beautifully round and taut the night before now hung out in front of him in a jiggling, heavy mass.
He could hear himself moaning at the ache, his palm rubbing his tight skin. Looking down in between his swallows, all he could see was a gigantic belly pushing out round from his chest, swelling into the room, and he had to reach forward just to touch the tip of it with his hand. He held it up, shivering at the dense weight of what he was doing to his body.
His belly – that small, soft stomach that had looked so flat and ordinary before – it started to balloon out from his body and into his waiting hand. By the time the man was nearly two-thirds through the jug, his chest was heaving with breaths, and his hand was slowly starting to rub along the strip of exposed skin that was peeking out from under his riding-up shirt.
Sherlock took another puff from his cigarette, clearly thinking hard about the answer to the question. “I suppose it was almost ten years ago.”
“I was never exclusive; never had a long-term partner. People are idiots and, even then, I didn’t care to waste my time with most of them. While many of my experiences were satisfactory, there are some I’d like to forget. I’m extremely fortunate that protection was always used – I’m clean – however, it wasn’t always nice and there were times that my consent was questionable, at best. Some of the men were rough with me, but I suppose I’ve always been one to push my limits.”
from his landlady. Mrs. Hudson is already dressed in her festive outfit and pats Sherlock on the shoulder. “Go on and get yourself ready. I’ll fix you a nice cuppa.”
We felt that having Sherlock and John write journal entries for this chapter was nice because it gives us their POV on the same situation which is hard to do as a writer most times. We hope you feel the same way we do!
There it was. Such a perfect smile, full of contentment, love, bliss. Sherlock set his hands on his lap, away from John’s sight; he mustn’t see him fight the temptation of touching him. What Sherlock would not give to hold John’s cheek in his, to be able to feel the smooth skin against his own. He grimaced, such improper, degrading thoughts swimming through his head. He managed to suppress them, after that day with Mycroft, but they were slowly returning despite his efforts to keep them away. He pushed them far back into his mind, to where he could not access them. He had been fine for the past few years, not one lustful thought found its way into Sherlock’s mind. He was too busy, too smart, for them.
“I am sorry, Sherlock. You’ll pardon me, I suppose this whole ordeal does not sit well with me. I do not wish to speak on this anymore for fear I will cause a disagreement between us both. I do not wish for there to be any bad blood between us, I think we have had our fair share of it.”
With a surge of anger that Sebastian did not see, Sherlock gently pushed the sleeve down and placed a hand on his shoulder. “Go to the inn, I will see to Moriarty and then we shall take leave of this place. You, John, and I. Do you understand?”
Sherlock seemed relieved at her answer. To return to the manor, only to find that his brother’s belongings had been meddled with would have been distressing indeed. Sherlock had missed the way Mrs. Hudson stared at him.
Thank you for all the kudos, thank you for all the comments, the bookmarks, the subscriptions, and thank you for all the reblogs on tumblr too! I think I speak for the both of us when we say that we did have a lot of fun writing this  and we are so happy and thrilled that you all enjoyed our twist on Frankenstein and Sherlock!
The man moved his head in a mirrored way, clearly mimicking John. With slow and careful steps, Sherlock approached the man and took his hand. Instantly the man resisted and John stepped in between the two of them. He took over Sherlock’s task and grabbed the man’s hand, to which there was no resistance. Sherlock noticed the change in behavior once John made contact. The three of them walked down the stairs and into the living room. John was the one who settled the man down on the sofa and stepped back to stand alongside Sherlock.
She smiled, but Sherlock saw the wariness in her eyes. She suspected John of being like Sherlock, of being...being a homosexual. It wasn’t his fault, John only knew him, he did not have the chance to meet others. She was wrong about John, she was wrong about Sherlock.
“In all the time that we have spent in this bath, you have not once made any indication to want...more.”
Sherlock laughed, but he could not stop the tears at this point. He wished John would let him retire to his room, at least until he was able to compose himself.
His voice trailed off after the words left his mouth. Mycroft was not able to finish his letter to Sherlock, this, the last thing that would ever be written to him by his brother was incomplete. He could imagine what more Mycroft had wanted to say to him. He had already advised him from being with another man, he told him that he was mean because he loved him, and apologized many times over for not being there for Sherlock when he began his drug usage. He nestled his face into the crook of John’s arm and sighed.
"Research?" John grumbled.  "You can't research something that isn't real, Sherlock."   But he dutifully typed.   "Clinical lycanthropy  is the diagnosis of people who have delusions of being a werewolf."
John would be more comforted by Mycroft’s reaction if his preferred drink weren’t waiting for him without him saying a thing to the bartender.
With Sherlock’s head thrown back, his throat was a perfect stretch of bare skin upon which John pressed his lips. He licked and nibbled, sucked to leave beautiful blooms of red behind. His lips trailed downwards through the soft hairs that dusted across Sherlock’s chest. He rubbed at one nipple between his fingers, watching Sherlock keen into the touch, and decided it would be valuable knowledge to see how the bundle of tissue felt under his tongue.
John smirked and took his seat next to Sherlock on the couch. Sherlock turned around to face the kitchen and saw the sink, humming once he saw that it was empty. The dishes looked cleaner than he’d ever seen, almost as if Mrs. Hudson had magically appeared to clean Sherlock’s mess. He would not put it past her if she had done something like that.
“The poor thing was absolutely drained when he came up here.” Sherlock commented. Sebastian followed Mrs. Hudson up and she sang the boy’s praises before leaving the three of them alone. His makeshift was already on the floor and he sank down, barely muttering a goodnight to the two.
John did not move. Of course, the bedroom held unpleasant memories for him. It was the very room where he was attacked by Sherlock.
Lestrade did not look the least bit interested in hearing of this man’s monetary loss, but one look at the man told him that the issue would not be so easily swept aside. He quirked a brow for him for continue.
Sherlock sighed and grabbed John’s hand. He nearly sobbed when he felt John’s hand squeeze his own. “The very same reason you have just told me, my John...my dear John, love of my life....you will aid me without a doubt and that will result in your demise. My brother died protecting me and I will be damned if you will go down in the same fashion. I will not have your blood on my hands, John...I cannot. Moriarty is not your enemy.”
“Why. Are. We. Here. Sherlock?” John’s voice was grave and his face became completely devoid of emotion. Sherlock cursed himself. He had not planned on Sebastian turning up and ruining everything, but John would have become wise eventually. That was the thing about his John, he was pretty damn smart.
“We must find you a suitable name, I think it only proper,” Sherlock piped in. He walked over to the bookshelf and grabbed the first book he saw; a book on important figures in Christianity. He had found John’s name from the Bible and there seemed no easier method. He flipped the book open and made his way back to the two. He crouched down with John and read from the pages of it, fighting every impulse in his body not to grin when he felt John’s hand rest on his thigh.
Sherlock hesitated but accepted that he would only make the situation worse by withholding the information from John.
Moriarty snarled and shoved Sherlock. “I would have had you years ago. Your brother thwarted my plans and had me contained. He released me some time ago and I have spent every second of my freedom finding a way to stop you. To hurt you as you have hurt me.”
Sherlock nearly laughed at John’s sheer excitement to see what Sherlock had gotten him. He lifted his coat up and handed him the mistreated box. John’s face dropped slightly at the sight, causing Sherlock to worry deeply.
“You came to kill me? That is rich, just rich indeed Mr. Holmes. My, you sound like your brother. I wonder what he would think of it all. You and I, standing here, dangerously close to the edge, talking about plans of death.”
He didn’t bother to wipe the tears away, there were too many at this point. He released a soft whimper.
John moved to the coat rack and spoke with fervor. “Sebastian, you must take me to them, I must help him, safety be damned!”
John sighed, whenever they come to the subject of John’s creation, or the night of his “birth” the air around them became awkward and tense, and it was situations like this that made John wish that he had been made normally, that he wouldn’t have to make Sherlock or himself so uncomfortable. There was little they could do now for this was the life he was thrust into and the life he would live.
John’s gentle hand rose to cup Sherlock’s cheek, a steady but soft gaze meeting his own of sadness and insecurity. “Oh, my dear Holmes. You do not see yourself as I see you. It is true I have not experienced much of this world but this feeling I cannot doubt. It is singular and frightening - I would be terrified to think any other could make me feel the same. I love you to a degree that I can barely contain. I cannot even imagine a life without you and that short moment when I thought I might have to live one as such at the falls, was devastating. You created me and your love sustains me. You, Sherlock. Only, and ever, you.”
. John has looked at Sherlock’s mouth at least two hundred and fifty-seven times throughout the course of the evening at an average of over two times per minute. That must be a record. Definitely a personal record. Maybe an all-time record? Are there all-time records for the most someone has looked at another person’s lips for any given amount of time? Probably not. What about studies calculating how often is appropriate for strictly platonic friends to look at each other’s lips, are any of those out there? If not, there should be. This is all very confusing.
her sometimes. I never said I have sex with her. You drew your own conclusions, which were, as usual, wrong.”
Their working hours together are certainly different, these days. John hardly ever stays out late in the evening, making sure to get back home in time to tuck Rosie into bed. Sherlock would be lying if he said he didn’t miss the late nights running around London or watching crap telly together, but it is what it is. He will gladly take the daytime hours he gets with John if it means having John back in his life. Every so often, Molly goes over to John’s place to watch Rosie and put her to bed if they know that they will be out late for a case, but it is rare. Sherlock knows that John is disappointed in the way he handled the transition into single parenthood in the months following Mary’s death, and has been determined to step up and be the best father he can be, and if that means being home for dinner most nights, Sherlock will support him.
John laughed as Sherlock frantically pulled him into the room and they flopped onto the bed without even stopping to remove any clothes. John took off his beret and set it next to the bed, smiling to himself as he imagined what Sherlock might do if he puts it on again in the morning. Despite the full evening he’s had, John realizes once he’s laid down how extremely tired he is. Thankfully he shouldn’t have a hard time getting a few hours of sleep in before the morning comes.
.” Jesus, no wonder they get along so well. They’re like the same person. At least she hasn’t started shooting holes in the wall.
Irene exhaled smoke from her lungs and sighed. “I don’t know, you should ask someone who’s slept with him.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “The answer to the question you’ve wanted to ask me since the moment we met. I pick truth.”
Mycroft is still an idiot and Sherlock feels slightly bitter about the manipulation Mycroft put him through over the years, but if he’s really being honest with himself, he knows that Mycroft was trying to protect him and their family. His brother went about it completely the wrong way, as ever, but what can you do.
Sherlock screwed the cap back on, smiling at Irene and looking rather pleased with himself. John couldn’t help but think that he’d love to have that mouth working his cock like he worked that bottle just now. The man was a menace.
John began moving again and found that his feet were carrying him faster than before, with a prickle of jealousy he would never admit to. Who the hell would Sherlock have over? His heart rate picked up at the thought, but he dismissed the worrying quickly. Must be someone they know. Molly? Mrs. Hudson?
“The years I spent being ‘dead’ made me think long and hard about intimacy and its role in my life. I was rather hoping things would be different when I returned home… Regardless, I’m learning to accept that sentiment isn’t the death of the mind. Not if I don’t want it to be. Which, as it turns out, I don’t.”
“I’m not making you a bloody timetable, Sherlock – I’ve wanted you for a long time. Now stop questioning me and give me some sort of indication of how you feel about all this!”
“When was the last time you ate?” The silence meant it had been too long. Great, now that he’s thinking about food, he realizes he’s got the munchies too. “Well, I dunno. Fuck! Now I’m hungry too.” Maybe they could get some food delivered?
Sherlock sighed and peeled one eye open. "John, I love you, but you must stop talking. I'm trying to sleep. We need to expedite the process of sobering up so I can make love to you as soon as possible.”
Sherlock takes a sip from the tea Mrs. Hudson has left out for him and then bends down to pick up Rosie, carrying her into the room near her father and asking about her day. As a rule of thumb, Sherlock doesn’t enjoy spending time with children, but Rosie is an exception to the rule. She is John’s child. What more needs to be said.
He rubbed his hands over his eyes and chuckled. “Christ, so we’ve both been in love with each other all this time?”
Sherlock’s feels the uncomfortable flutter in his belly that sometimes happens when texting with John, but quickly shakes it off, peeling himself from the bed and throwing on his blue dressing gown.
They stumble toward the bedroom, never breaking apart, and John nudges Sherlock down onto the bed. He climbs on top of Sherlock and pulls his shirt and vest off. Sherlock sighs at the sight of John’s naked chest, reaching out and letting his fingers roam up his stomach, brushing lightly over his scar, and stopping to caress his nipples. John moans and rolls his head back. After a moment, John closes the distance and moves his mouth across Sherlock’s jaw and down his throat as he begins unbuttoning Sherlock’s shirt. “You’re a menace, you know that?”
John decided this was the night to find out. He spent too many goddam years filled with regret over what could have been. Things were already so unstable between them that he figured it would be worth the risk.
The joint got passed around a few more times and John became more practiced with each turn. His body had started to tingle pleasantly and everything started getting a little hazy. He smoked just enough to get a nice high. Too much, and he knew from his days back in Uni that he would just fall asleep. No, he wanted to stay awake and at least somewhat alert to see where the night took them. He couldn’t help but watch each time Sherlock put the joint to his lips. It was a bit mesmerizing.
John headed upstairs in search of the beret, finding the box tucked far back in the closet. Jesus, he forgot how much stuff he had left in 221B. He brushed off some of the dust and quickly returned downstairs, wondering what Sherlock was going to have him do.
, John was squirming. His pants were becoming tighter by the second. He knew he could make things a lot easier by simply looking away, but there was no way in hell he was taking his eyes off this.
John adds a third finger and Sherlock collapses back onto the bed, covering his eyes with both hands. It’s amazing. Everything’s amazing. John’s amazing. “Now.”
“Once I began taking cases, the work became my top priority. The needs of my body became unimportant. I still have impulses, of course, I
, John thinks, when he realizes he’s been staring at Sherlock and the attention hasn’t gone unnoticed. Great. How is it that the most observant man in the world is the
A small smile played on Sherlock’s lips when he saw the beret in John’s hands. “Put it on and wear it for the remainder of the game, and John – I want you to pull rank anytime you feel it necessary. As often as possible.”
Sebastian was sitting on his bed, nursing his arm and trying his hardest not to let his tears fall. Moriarty was especially cruel to him today, and it was not the drink that spawned it. He was in a bad mood, Sebastian could already tell as much. If Moriarty’s mood was lighter, he would have let him pass without any argument seeing as how he seldom joined the two in the living room to smoke and drink. He remembered the last time he was forced to witness Moriarty’s black mood. It made him miss Sherlock’s sulks.
John hurried back with the good quilt that Mrs. Hudson had bought for Sherlock when he was younger. Sentimental reasons were why he had kept it for all this time. Sherlock urged Sebastian to lay down and he did so reluctantly. John spread the blanket over him and calmed the restless man.
John looked Sebastian up and down. He was going mad, surely he was. This was the guilt that he sought to repress, he should have known his mind would betray him and force him to see visions of Sebastian. He must return to the inn, he must see Sherlock and hug him and kiss him and remind himself that he was real and that Sebastian was gone from them forever. Moriarty had him and what were the chances of him whisking Sebastian and his crew to Switzerland as well?
John. Now, Sherlock’s relationship with John was by and far the most difficult to repair. They were on amiable terms, which in and of itself was a remarkable feat given the strain their friendship has suffered, but it was nowhere near back to the way it was. Sherlock supposes it will never be restored completely.
“Hm…” Sherlock steepled his hands under his chin and looked down at the floor for a minute, lost in thought. John could tell the moment he thought of his dare, because in a flash Sherlock’s eyes lit up and darted to John’s. “John,” he said slowly. “Is your army beret still in the closet upstairs?”
John eases in and out as he continues to stroke Sherlock slowly but firmly. “Beautiful. God, you’re beautiful.”
Sherlock couldn’t seem to get himself back up because he was laughing too hard, so he started crawling over to John on hands and knees. The sight forced another accidental lip lick. Sherlock stopped at John’s feet and looked up at him with glazed eyes. “John. Stay.”
All John could get out was a nervous laugh before he reached for his drink and drained its contents.
know John and has explicitly been told time and time again that John is not gay. No confirmed male-male relationships in his history. Nothing to back up that John may have bisexual tendencies.
“Not anymore, you’re not. In fact, I don’t suspect you’ll be stepping out of this flat for the next few days.”
Irene tapped on her phone for a moment then said, “Okay, two minutes on the clock.” Sherlock twisted the cap off the bottle. “In three, two, one, begin.”
When their giggles slowed, John realized how quiet it was in the flat. It seemed like each noise was amplified when he put his attention on it, and he suggested Sherlock play some of his violin. Irene started weakly clapping her hands and John shoved Sherlock off of the couch, playfully kicking his arse to get him to move. Sherlock stumbled over to the case and pulled out the violin, chuckling as he attempted to get ready to play. He began running his bow against the strings and when the sound filled the air, John felt like he could cry it sounded so beautiful. Sherlock only played for a few minutes before dropping his arms and flopping back onto the sofa.
“Oh no no, you didn’t let me finish. I want you to take a body shot.” She smiled sweetly. “From John.”
Sherlock had ripped out his earbuds and slammed his thumb down on the space bar to pause it. The video paused with the killer’s fingertip dipping into his stretched navel, right after he’d grabbed a handful of the skin and slapped it, hard.
Sherlock bit his lip and held in a desperate moan as the man stopped half-way through the soda and looked down at himself again. He rubbed his palm over his entire belly again, over the full bursting curve.
He’d never seen himself so round. So packed and tight – skin cresting in a perfectly full curve. He tilted his head back and sighed as Sherlock leaned down and kissed the tightest part of his stomach.
It was only just now starting to fade – the pressure and the pain. He could almost suck in his stomach halfway now, if he tried, but he would still keep his shirt off, just a few minutes longer, until he started to feel squishy and bloated instead of tight and round.
When John finally pulled back, Sherlock smiled down at him with such tenderness it made John’s chest ache. They both looked down at his stomach in between them. John cradled it with both hands, gently rubbing at his stretched skin, and Sherlock did the same, feeling the full curve of John’s belly from his navel down to his hips. It felt wonderful – enjoying the fulness of his belly together in their flat, right in the light of day like it wasn’t anything bad at all.
Sherlock rubbed underneath his jumper from his hips up to his chest. “Let it out,” he whispered. “Come on, let me see.”
Sherlock’s hands joined his on his tight middle, resting over the fullest part of his belly and dipping one of his thumbs into John’s sensitive navel. He pressed lightly, causing John to wince and the skin stretched over his belly to pull tighter. “You want to be fuller,” he said low. He held John’s gaze. “Let me fill you. Let me help you get so huge you can’t move. So perfectly round and filled.”
John realized, though, as his eyes skimmed the comments, that these ones were starting to look different – a little more . . .enthusiastic.
He groaned. He realized he’d never seen his belly this hard and swollen before. The skin was pale white, and was starting to itch where it stretched the most along his sides to accommodate the heavy weight of his growing belly.
Sherlock placed three huge mugs of warmed milk on the coffee table, then drew John down to sit resting back against him, between his legs. John realized with a shiver that they could perfectly see themselves in a mirror. Before Sherlock could hand him the first full mug John leaned forward and pulled off his shirts, shivering once as the cool air in the flat hit his bare skin. Sherlock did the same behind him, and when John leaned back he felt cocooned in Sherlock’s warmth. He willed himself to fully relax, and watched with lidded eyes as his belly stretched out before him, waiting to be filled.
Suddenly, the juxtaposition of his flat stomach on his laptop screen and the bursting curve of his belly sitting heavily on his thighs in real life sent a shiver of heat down John’s spine. He touched the bottom curve of his stomach, rubbing his hand between his belly and his thighs, and he moaned at the dense weight of it in his palm. He shivered again.
And for the first time in the entire silent video, he moaned. It was a soft, wonderful sound from the back of his throat – nothing like the theatrical sighs and grunts from the other video Sherlock had seen.
Lestrade nodded and the two sat in uncomfortable silence. Lestrade was the one to break the silence once more.
John ended up not getting any sleep because his worry for Sherlock outweighed his need for slumber but that did not bother him much since he was not tired in the first place. The sun was setting, and he decided that Sherlock should have something in his stomach. In slow, careful movements, he rose from the bed and tip-toed his way out of the room. Thankfully, Sherlock didn’t even stir. When John made his way downstairs, he checked the cupboards for anything that could be thrown together and cooked quickly so that he wouldn’t leave the man unattended for long. He used the very last bit of their ham and bread, making small portions of the meat on bread. It was nothing much, but paired with a cup of tea, it would do. He heard Sherlock groan from upstairs and immediately made his way up to their room and found Sherlock sitting up, coughing dryly and loud.
“Tell me how it was done.” His voice was harsh, cold, nothing at all like the voice Sherlock was accustomed to.
“Good morning!” Sherlock looked at the entrance of the kitchen and saw John standing there with a genial grin on his face. Sherlock let out a sigh of relief, what would he even tell Mrs. Hudson? True, it is not as if he had done anything inherently intimate with John. They had only kissed once and Sherlock made sure to stop it there. He shared a bed with John only a few times, that was not so terrible, all they did was sleep. He was not a bad person, he wasn’t.
John smirked and ruffled Sebastian’s hair. “You grow smarter each day and I must applaud you now on how well you handled his black moods. While we do not understand much more than him, he is rather inexperienced when it comes to emotions. I only wish you to know that he does hold affection in his heart, and that he did not truly hate you. Just the way he felt toward you.”
John nodded, going for Sherlock’s buttons now so he could finally get his hands on that pale skin. “We will learn together. You know I have never done this before either. I only know that I want you in the most intimate way possible.”
“Nothing has captured your eye since we have been together, so you might understand why I am so curious. You do not partake in smoking or drinking, not very English of you I might add. I ask myself, what is that has my dear Sebastian so occupied that he does not even stay at home? Then, I’ve come to a conclusion. Two conclusions.”
Sherlock sat up in his bed and shifted his position so that his feet touched the icy floor. The chill from the wood invigorated him. He sniffled as he stared at the photograph of Mycroft and himself. Sherlock wiped away the tear that fell from his eye.
“John, we have been in each other’s presence constantly for the past few days. Have you not gotten tired of looking at me?” Sherlock’s deep baritone broke the silence, eyes cracked open to look upon his flatmate. A corner of his lips was pulled up, accompanying the teasing tone of his voice.
“Where exactly were you this morning? It is unlike you to be away from the flat this early, save for when you go to the shops, but you’ve returned with naught but the morning paper. What is the matter?”
“Apologies, I had not noticed.” Sherlock would not have apologized had it been any other day, but he was in too joyous of a mood. He paid the driver and watched as the horse carted the cab away. With a wide smile on his face, he looked up at the window of his flat, John was not there. He started to walk over to the door when he was stopped by a, “Oi, freak!”
“Mr. Banville. You need only fill this report out and I shall do my best to recover your stolen funds.” Lestrade had hoped that Thomas did not hear the feigned note of his voice. It was not as if he was completely indifferent to the man’s plight, but he was quite sure that the victim would be able to regain the lost amount much faster than it would take Lestrade to find it. London had hundreds of children who pickpocketed the noble daily, but he could sympathize with them. He was sure the culprit used the money to buy themself food or feed their family.
John stepped out of the carriage with Sebastian and Sherlock. It had seemed like an eternity since he had been at the Holmes Manor. He wondered if Mrs. Hudson ever thought about writing them again. She had to miss Sherlock, regardless of how bad the terms his departure were. She raised him, that was practically his mother. Sherlock held John’s hand firmly and John smiled, pressing a kiss to his cheek.
The soft sound of Sherlock’s chuckle caught John’s attention. The way Sherlock seemed so calm, so relaxed around this woman, John decided that maybe he could come to feel the same way about her as well. He followed Sherlock up the stairs, leaving Mrs. Hudson behind with Sherlock’s coat draped over her arms.
Sherlock let out a sigh and nuzzled against John’s face. “You are so much more than I could have ever expected, John. I want you to know this for forever and a day.”
John shrugged and picked up the empty plate. As he turned to head into the kitchen, he said, “I’ll prepare your bath and then you will have a cup of tea.”
“How bothersome the rain is! I can scarcely finish this chapter. Come Sherlock, let us retire for the evening.”
Sherlock resolved to look away and focus on the task at hand. He was ashamed of himself to think of touching another man in such a ghastly way. If he had, he imagined the police swarming into the flat and whisking him away for gross indecency. Sherlock covered the lower body with a blanket. His urge remain as he worked but he focused his attention on the man’s face. The sight of which brought a soft smile to Sherlock’s lips.
He could cry if he wanted to. No one would notice. They would mistake it for the rain drops that were already sliding down his face. No one else could see his sadness. No one else cared. The other attendees were huddled together away from him. They stared at the black wood with straight faces but Sherlock knew better. They did not feel any sorrow towards his brother’s passing. They were all acquaintances that Mycroft had made in his line of work and nothing more. These people were here for the sake of propriety, not reasons to do with sentiment. Sherlock wanted them to leave but then he realized that if they did, there would only be him left there, and the last thing he needed was to be alone.
John’s eyes darted from side-to-side. Sherlock had not meant to put him on the spot but he grew nervous as the thought manifested. John wanted to lay in the bed with him. Yes, he did attempt to get John to do such a thing on the night he appeared in Sherlock’s room but they had come a long way since then. On the other hand he would feel positively dreadful if he sent John away. And did he not crave this as well? Did he not stare at the man in front of him with the hope that maybe he would be able to seek comfort in his embrace?
He spent hours bemoaning the loss of his brother. He was not sure when they ever made the trip but he found himself back in the manor with John’s arms still wrapped tightly around him, and said person fast asleep in Sherlock’s bed. The moon shone through the large window, illuminating everything in its presence. His eyes were sore from the amount of tears he had shed at the graveyard and he felt as if he could not possibly support the weight his body possessed. How did John get him back here? And how was it that he could recollect none of it?
There it was again. He would never understand how John was able to go from furious to tender when he talked to Sherlock. Once again, John was the one to save him from an attack. He was always the hero. Sherlock smiled and nodded.
Sherlock was silent and it was then he took a bite of the food. A mode of evasion, John realized. Even now, after all the time they spent together, Sherlock still thought that he had no one at his side, that he was still the lonely man before John. That was not the case, not while he was around.
Faster than they could have anticipated, a bolt of lightning shot into the attic. As Sherlock had planned, the rods absorbed the electricity which was lead directly to the body with copper wire. However Sherlock had underestimated the sheer magnitude and the light that was emitted from the impact was blinding. Sparks flew and soon Sherlock was pulled to the floor with John covering him, his heartbeat so loud in his ears that he heard nothing else.
Sherlock nodded and watched as John left the room. Sherlock brought his hand up toward his left cheek, seeing as how John spent the most time on that side of his face. It hurt, to say the least. John had created tiny strips from the bandages to place on Sherlock’s face. His cheek was swollen, and no doubt bruised. He tried not to think about the attack. Even though it had just happened, he did not want to dwell on it any longer than he had to. He should be accustomed to such treatment, if the children that lived near him had anything to say about it. At first, he tried to be nice, to smile at them, to laugh at their jests, to be normal just as they had been. Of course he had to ruin it by saying something odd or just simply...being himself. They ignored him at first whenever he said something they did not understand, or did not want to hear. Sherlock thought that meant that they were entertained by his conversations. He would talk to them about bees, or that he cut an earthworm’s head off once to test the regeneration claims. They recoiled in disgust. Soon after, they began to avoid Sherlock, especially after he had brought up several of the children’s personal lives (she should have known that her father was committing adultery). He, of course, did not understand what they were doing, that they did not like him, so he continued to pester them. He was cornered by a few of the boys that he followed around one day and, very much like today, they beat him and chanted that hideous word as they hurt him.
John could only make a noise of agreement, leaning forward to rest his forehead over Sherlock’s shoulder as he slid in and out of that luxurious heat. His knees were beginning to slip on the sheets so he pulled up closer, making Sherlock bend inwards more.
What use would the madman have for such a person? If John was anything to go by, then this creation would possibly be even gentler, more fragile, than John had been on the night of their meeting. Well, Sherlock did throw a vase at him, and it did little more than stun him. There was also the possibility that this one would not come to life, even John was nothing short of a miracle. He kissed the warm chest and rested a hand on John’s soft arm as he gently stroked the skin. John had been his rock during this process. Although it may have seemed like nothing to an outsider, they had made great progress in the time they had spent working on the project. It was John that would rouse Sherlock from his slumber in that uncomfortable chair in the laboratory. It was John that forced the breaks for food and baths where he would then do a remarkable job washing Sherlock’s hair. Today, however, it had been Sherlock who dragged John to their room because the poor man could not keep his eyes open for a moment longer. He placed a gentle kiss onto John’s lips and the man did not even stir.
Sherlock watched with wide eyes as the blood-curdling screams died down to whimpers. The man’s eyes darted around the lab and finally landed upon Sherlock. Sherlock rose to his feet, favouring his left wrist. It was not broken, as he was able to move it, but perhaps it was sprained, or bruised. He watched as John restrained the man, only letting go once he was sure that nothing else would happen.
Sebastian bit his lip. Moriarty was a cruel man, and he wanted to flee, to be rid of him forever, to go to John and Sherlock and leave with them.
Sherlock rolled over to find the sky a somber grey. This was the fourth consecutive day . The rows of buildings and flats within his view were blurred by the raindrops that had found their homes on his window. He watched as the they landed on the glass, sliding down ever so gently, absorbing and dividing. He had slept in again, a habit developed over the past two weeks, even prior to Mycroft’s funeral. He wondered what his brother would say regarding the foul weather.
John hopped out of the carriage, paid the driver and stood. It was not near the falls, though he could see it. If they made haste they would reach them in time. “Quickly, Sebastian!”
John rolled his eyes and said, “Do not listen to him, Sebastian. What he means to say is that she will get on with you splendidly.”
John’s arm tightened their hold around him and the small gesture brought him security and the very rare feeling of love. He was a fool to let this continue, but he could not bear to think of himself without it.
“You’ll forgive me, Sir Banville, but I must take my leave. The rain has let up and I would like to be home before it starts again.”
Sebastian nodded and turned toward the inn. Before he began walking, he said, “Moriarty is a wicked man, Sherlock. He will not stop, he will hound us and harass us at every corner. The only way to be free of him...is….”
And he was a fool to be so devoted to Sherlock. He could barely work up the nerve to even kiss him, let alone share a bed with him in the privacy of their home. Mycroft had never explained such things to him as a child. He did not understand why people fell in love, why they wanted to marry and start families. Sherlock did not understand what love was, and what it meant to be in love. Mycroft himself never married, hardly the scandal since most of the nobles knew of his surly demeanor and the fact that he was tasked with ensuring the wellbeing of Britain. Unlike himself, Mycroft had reasons for remaining unmarried. Sherlock had only one reason; he was simply not loved enough to be considered for marriage. Suppose he did marry, what would his wife think of him? Would she think him insane? Would she spend every waking moment reminding him that she did not love him, that he was not normal? Would she even want to be around him long enough for a child to be conceived? The answer was no, Sherlock would never find a soul in the world that loved him for him.
“I do hope we have made the right decision bringing him here. I should think he would want to be near us at all hours.”
Sherlock crossed his arms and gave John a skeptical glare. When would he ever release himself from his stubbornness? Sherlock had made a move to say something to John about the subject, but was wracked with drowsiness and decided to let it be.
John’s only response was to kiss Sherlock’s head and to let the man cry, as long as he needed to, upon his shoulder. With each sob, each sniffle, each time he felt a tear fall onto his skin, John cursed Moriarty a thousand times over. Sherlock was a good man and he deserved more than what he got. They only had a month and some weeks to complete this new Vitruvian Man, and seeing the state it had reduced Sherlock to, John would be by his side every step of the way.
There was a knock at the door, prompting Sherlock to answer it. It was a boy not more than twenty years of age with a bag of letters and items that needed to be delivered. Sherlock could scarcely believe it - there was a letter in the post for him. He thanked the young man and closed the door behind him. John had taken a seat upon the chesterfield and Sherlock took a seat beside him. He opened the letter without a word and read it. John waited patiently for Sherlock to relay to him what the letter said. Sherlock set the paper down next to him and stared blankly towards the fireplace.
John sounded absolutely devastated. Sherlock could not bring himself to tell him the truth. All he’d done over the course of the day was upset John. It began at breakfast when he had John believe that he was the cause for his sadness, and now, all he had done was run out to buy him clothes, but here they both were. Why didn’t John leave him? Why doesn’t John leave him now? He would not be surprised if he woke up the next morning to find the flat depressingly empty. Maybe there would be a note, if John’s writing skills were as good as Sherlock hoped, or there would be nothing at all. It would only be the feeling of abandonment and Sherlock would have to come to terms with it once again.
