Sherlock gives his head a quick shake to dispel the images forming in the John wing of his mind palace and slams the door shut before his cheeks are so pink John will think he has a fever. Shifting backwards a step and worrying his lips, he meets John ‘s eyes again. He suddenly feels ridiculous, like he is tucking John in for the night. Not trusting himself to speak, Sherlock turns and walks to the door. When he looks back at John, the man wears yet another unreadable expression. Sherlock shrugs toward the hall and smiles somewhat awkwardly.
What the hell does that mean? Surely not what he wants them to. Why is this man so damn murky in a world that is otherwise, clear as glass? Everything and everyone so obvious and Sherlock likes it that way, but John Watson is an anomaly, an enigma he cannot quite piece together. It is absolutely infuriating and yet, everything Sherlock has ever wanted.
“A full three years ahead of schedule,” she grins like any proud mother would. “Seems he has the same head for medicine that you have for observation.”
Back in the living room of his suite, Sherlock hangs his long coat and scarf in the closet by the door. He pulls off his suit coat as he goes to the kitchen, tossing it on the bar that separates the kitchenette from the rest of the room. He removes a small bottle of wine from the fridge and takes a glass from the cabinet. Sherlock likes a good white wine and only if it is colder than what most think is appropriate. This wine is acceptable, he concludes after a sip.
Sherlock looks past John for a moment, feeling himself being pulled down a rabbit hole to a place he would rather not go. He fixes his gaze on John once more, a more critical gaze this time.
Sherlock’s expression changes to one of hesitance, but he lifts his hand and places it on John’s where it rests in his lap. He wets his lips and picks up John’s hand with both of his, facing his palm out. The doctor’s arm is bent at the elbow and he watches as the detective presses their palms together. John slides his fingers in between Sherlock’s and clasps his larger hand. The man’s long fingers immediately fold over his friend’s.
I'm almost finished with the next chapter already, so it'll be up soon. Thank you all. You are shafts of gold when all around is dark.
After a few more minutes of indulgence, Sherlock releases John and sits again. The two of them talk easily and light-heartedly, giggling and laughing. Sherlock had almost forgotten how good it felt to do this. To just talk to John.
Hello, my friends! It’s been a whirlwind of a week. My days were all screwed up and everything went so quickly - meetings, cataloging and the lot. Even my daughter (7) has noticed how quickly time goes now. Friday was the last day of school and we are now in talks here because parental units want to see schoolwork and schedule continue while the childrens want them to end. They actually sat down together in a secret conference and wrote out their ”demands”. You say cute, I say eek!
Both men open their eyes half way to look at one another, searching, seeking permission. John slides his hand along Sherlock’s jawline, brushing a thumb across his lips. Sherlock nips at it, then tilts his head and swoops in. John’s mind goes blank but for the taste of Sherlock. His scent, the warmth of his lips.
I’ve been told that people aren’t receiving a notification that this chapter is up. I don’t know why that would happen, but I’m trying to repost it.
“We weren’t a wealthy family,” he begins, “but what my parents were rich in was connections. My mum’s best friend was a tutor, so she came to work with me in the evenings. When I was old enough, dad got me into an upscale public school. He coached the entire board at cricket in the summer. They even talked my way into uni and medical school. My marks and accomplishments helped too, but it was mostly them. They knew everyone and everyone thought the world of them.”
“Hey. Sorry I’m late. I was finishing up some notes,” he pauses to take in Sherlock’s appearance and tilts his head slightly. “You okay?”
John’s eyes widened slightly, intrigued with both the mystery and the man himself. John’s tongue darted over his bottom lip and he noticed Sherlock’s eyes flick to them momentarily before explaining his deductions.
John watches Sherlock for a moment with the same scrutiny that Sherlock studies him. John seems to consider something and then looks resigned, sighing heavily. He sits up and raises a hand to cup the back of his own neck.
John opens his mouth to speak, but the server is back with bread and olive oil. The young man makes lame conversation as he prepares the oil, mixing in fresh black pepper and parmesan. By the time he has finished and taken their orders, Sherlock is ready to tell him to piss off. John must sense the tension because he remains silent, merely studying Sherlock while he sips his wine as if he is giving Sherlock a chance to cool down.
“That’s going to help you relax?” John laughs. His flatmate does not respond, but gives him a look that says ‘I wouldn’t ask if it won’t help.’ John shakes his head and toes off his shoes. “Okay, okay. Don’t question the genius.”
Sherlock releases a harsh breath through his nose as he turns to the side and motions for a stretcher. Every skater in the stadium, on and off the track, is down on one knee in solidarity. Smacks is biting her lip hard enough to draw blood. She holds her breath and then inhales sharply as John continues examining her leg while he asks questions. She bites back a cry and squirms, which only seems to increase her pain.
They looked at one another in silence for a long moment, both gauging the other. Standing still in a sea of moving bodies.
“Seriously, Sherlock, you have to stop coming here every night,” Molly had chided. “I know you’re behind on all that extra work you do after hours. You’d have to be by now.”
5) Ultimately, what is going to happen next?!?! Moriarty could strike! It could be the team or John or Sherlock OH GOD, JANE! WHO?? WHAT??? HOW?? WHEN??? WHERE??? Hey, this is like grade school. Lol.
Roughly five minutes later, a nervous John Watson stands outside the door to Sherlock’s bedroom with a hand raised to knock. His body is still, unable to gather his courage. It isn’t as though he hasn’t had any experience with men. Everyone experiments at some point in life, after all. But he knows, without a doubt, that he has never before felt what he feels for Sherlock.
As always, feel free to drop a message. Let me know if you have any terminology questions or whatever. I'm always open to constructive comments and am more than happy to reply.
“He was a fool,” John all but whispers, shaking his head. His expression is soft and his eyes look almost sad. Sherlock’s stomach flips again and much more dramatically than usual. He only just hides his astonishment from the doctor. To that end, he rushes on before John has a chance to notice and before Sherlock can think much about what it could all mean.
I hope you aren't disappointed that I skipped over the actual watery rescue and flight off the island. It isn't as important to my way of thinking than John waking up, or he and Sherlock being reunited, for that matter. Reading through this for edits made my heart melt. The two of them finally meeting eyes, talking to one another... They had to kiss. They just had to. They are my two pieces who fit together perfectly and everything is falling into place again. I hope you all love this chapter as much as I do.
The warning was meant to help, but only succeeds in startling HardOn and increasing the effect of the hit. Her eyes wide in terror, HardOn flies right off her skates. It happens in a split-second, but the scene plays out in slow-motion for everyone in the stadium. HardOn hovers in mid-air with a curse on her lips before slamming right into Smacks, normal speed returning as 32 spirals into the mix. They skid out of bounds in a tangle of limbs and loud grunts, Smacks on the bottom and taking the full force of the other two skaters. Her scream echoes through the stadium at impact and she clutches at her calf as soon as they come to a stop.
What the fuck is he going to do now? It was one thing when it was just an attraction. He can live with suppressing an attraction, but love? With someone he works with and sees every day? Someone he is friends with? If he takes this chance as Molly suggested and it ends like Victor, he will have nothing to fall back on. Derby and skating, his very life blood, will remind him of John.
I connected it to the series, but is it a work that stands on its own. Please, if you like Part 1, go read Part 2 and see the story continue.
Now, back to the story. I love this case and invested a lot of time into letting it develop. The characters I created for it are some of my faves. I also had a lot of fun with the accent. I also wanted to use it to make my own personal statement about something, but you'll see that later.
John grumbled darkly to himself, heading for the bar and the club’s sole proprietor, Greg Lestrade. He and Greg had met some ten years ago and the club was a hotspot even then. Now it was one of the most well-known on this side of London, but still retained its own rustic-city style with brick walls and an antique, solid oak bar. So many others had strayed toward trendy and pretentious, which only made John love this place more.
1) Now that they know and Moriarty doesn't know they know, nor does Janine know that they know, but THEY know that they know - Who's on first again? What's on second and I don't know who's on third.😉 - what will they do next?
“Sherlock,” he takes a step and rests his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders, shaking his head. “This along with coaching and everything else you have on your plate? No. Besides, it’s too risky. We’ve both seen how dangerous this is. I have the bandages to prove it.”
“I want to stay, John,” Sherlock snaps in an angry and too loud voice. He glances toward the room’s other two occupants and they avert their eyes when he catches them staring. Sherlock shifts his body to look at John and effectively turns his back on them. When he faces him, John appears very unamused to say the least.
“Well, believe me, it isn’t. It’s bloody brilliant, that’s what it is,” John remarked as he changed their step slightly to fit with the new song. John took both of Sherlock’s hands in his and stepped back, putting more space between the two of them. Their arms outstretched, fingers laced together, they mirrored one another’s movements and smiles as a cheerful voice filled the club.
“What could she do? She thought it was unfair and hated seeing my dreams crushed. She was angry as hell, but she couldn’t change it. Neither could I.”
She pauses a little too long before continuing and John instantly begins to feel leery. This is not the first time she has flirted with him since they met. She takes a step closer and John wishes there was nothing at his back so he could inch away.
“How bad?” Sherlock can’t keep his voice from trembling, his genuine fear for Smacks threatening to surface.
“He’s your age, dear,” Mrs. Hudson ignores both men and what should be an insulting remark on her advanced age. Sherlock continues to frown.
Sherlock gives John directions as they go and before long, they are parked outside his building. He turns to face John, but doesn’t quite meet his eyes. Once again, it feels like the end of a date where neither party can decide if he should kiss the other. God, how Sherlock wants to this time. Just the thought makes his stomach flip. Again. It is really starting to piss him off and yet, he hopes the feeling never stops.
Both men reached their stride as the chorus and the fun continued. John popped his chest to the beat, moving his bent arms in counterpoint and shifting his weight with what the rhythm provided. Sherlock’s hips swayed with his dancing feet and he lifted his hands above his head.
“Well, we are delighted to hear that. Aren’t you delighted, Greg?” he answers sarcastically, finally glancing at the GM and ignoring his incredulous frown. “Has this man worked in derby before you so graciously added him to our ranks?”
“Make sure they’re all in their rooms by midnight. We have to be at the airport at nine tomorrow morning.”
“Oh, Sherlock, that hurts. It really does.” He presses the knife closer and leers. “Does John ever whisper that in the dark? Because I’m gonna make him say it.”
John stops chewing and locks eyes with him. For a moment, Sherlock is afraid he has overstepped and his heart stops as he waits for John’s expression to turn into a scowl. But John just starts chewing again and flashes that brilliant smile after he swallows.
“The one in pink with the dark hair and flashy belt,” Sherlock directed John’s eyes until his gaze settled on a middle-aged woman holding a martini. She was laughing at something the man with her, clad in a trendy-cut white suit, had said. He tapped his G & T against her glass in a toast.
John spent months denying it. Then a couple years. Everything was going well and then Sherlock met The Woman. John was jealous as hell, but tried not to show it. Poorly. Fortunately, the world’s only consulting detective never caught on. He really can be so dim sometimes. John kept dating a few months and then just gave up. He found himself comparing every woman he went out with to Sherlock, or he constantly thought about Sherlock when he was on a date. Or not on a date. Kind of all the time. And it didn’t bother him in the least. He loved thinking about his flatmate and looking at his flatmate and talking to his flatmate. That was when John realized…
I'd like to thank my always stylish and wonderful beta, MyBreadAndButter, who keeps me on my toes and sometimes adds to my stress. She's like Barbara Streisand... like buttah! Bwahahahaha! Okay, that's my worst joke so far. Sorry, sorry, I can't help myself. How does Deadpool feel about Barbara? I mean, we all know he loves Wham! *sigh* I think I'm going to crank up some streaming Wham! and give it a listen. So many "good" songs, and George Michael is haunting me. Don't ask.
“Look, I only know what I’ve been able to piece together when it comes to Victor Trevor,” he says and Sherlock visibly bristles at the name, “but I know a hell of a lot about John Watson. If you’re worried about him changing once you’re involved, don’t.”
Sherlock’s eyes widen and sparkle with intrigue. Neither Mrs. Hudson nor Greg has ever seen him so invested in a person who wasn’t on wheels. Mrs. Hudson snickers.
“Hey, no, no,” John grabbed Sherlock’s wrists so he could not disappear in the mass of people on the floor. John knew that Sherlock would make sure John never saw him again unless he wanted him to. Panic creeped into his voice as he continued. “It’s okay. I didn’t mean to… I just… Don’t go. Please.”
“I am,” Sherlock straightens, head held high. He keeps John steady by his side. He can feel John’s energy slowly seeping out of his body as the doctor clutches Sherlock’s side, willing himself to keep upright. Exhaustion and whatever wounds John might have are finally getting the better of him. Unacceptable.
Sherlock gives him a small smile and squeezes his hand. The corners of John’s mouth turn up. Sherlock feels… He feels happy and contented. His only source of disquiet is that John will not be with them on the plane. Janine may need him, but it still feels wrong. He does not want to leave John here.
“I… He...he threatened me and then he killed me.” Sherlock closes his eyes in anger. Why can’t he bring himself to tell John what is really bothering him? Where is the courage and confidence that defines him? Is this what being in a relationship does to people, to him?
Once again, What the fuck, Jane? You lead us down this path and then SCREECH! You put on the breaks! You are evil. EEEEEEVILLLLLLL. Hey, there's a song about that. Eeeeevil Womahn. Hahahaha!
“Do we?” Sherlock quirks a brow, looking back at John. If he is going for confusion, he isn’t pulling it off in the slightest. John can tell he knows exactly what he’s referring to.
Oh, just the idea that you’ll have all read it when you get to this is a relief. What did you think? Quite a different ending from the last two chapters, eh? Haha. Dear Jane took pity and didn’t leave you in the lurch this time. However, y’all need to brace yourselves. John was right when he said it’s going to be a long night. What? Is that foreshadowing, Jane? Da da DAAAAA! Damn you.
Sherlock was in the emergency room by the time John had entered the picture, stubbornly refusing to let anyone touch him. God, John had wanted to say something that day. He remembers how difficult it was to concentrate with miles of lean muscle, pale skin stretched over it elegantly. Sherlock was far too thin in those days.
“Caring is not an advantage?” John asks with a frown. Sherlock looks at him as he lets his head turn down, releasing a sad sigh. The detective takes a hand off one of John’s and tips the man’s chin up with two fingers, their eyes meeting in a moment of unguarded silence.
Oh my god. Action-packed (I hope all the derby action was understandable), another injury (the plot thickens), and then a tender moment for our leading men. Awwwww. I know what you’re saying: Jane, this fucking chapter has it all! What is in store for Rock City? (Defeat? Glory?) What is in store for our intrepid duo? (Danger? Romance?) Only time will tell, my friends. Oh, to know the inner workings of The Mind of Jane. ‘Tis a scary place.
“Greg,” John’s voice is sincere and full of emotion. Greg looks at him with wide, concerned eyes and John must admit that the edge in his tone surprises even him.
As you may have guessed, it's not over yet and persistence is still key. I love you all and hope you stick with me. We'll get through this together.
“What is it then?” John swallows hard, trying not get his hopes up. Sherlock takes a deep breath and moves closer. When he meets John’s eyes, their lips are dangerously close. John can feel the heat of Sherlock’s breath as they breathe the same air, sharing its life-giving power.
Without opening his eyes, John leans in and draws Sherlock near. They kiss. This time with a hunger, a need. Sherlock’s hands slide around to the small of John’s back, holding their bodies even closer. John tilts his head up further and sticks out his chin to get a different angle on the tall man in his arms. He pokes the tip of his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth and then retracts it, pulling his chin back as well.
“I should think not. I invented it,” Sherlock said haughtily, the pleasure obvious in his whole body. A sudden laugh burst from John’s lips, taking both men by surprise. Sherlock’s features were just beginning to harden when John caught his breath to speak.
“John is genuine,” Greg talks over him and, for once, the younger man bites his tongue. In fact, it may be the first time it has ever happened. “What you see is real, not a facade. John knows who he is and has no interest in pretending otherwise. Not for anything or anyone.”
“Yes,” John answers with a short laugh. Billy raises his brows. John presses his lips together and looks at the old man. He has an almost mischievous glint in his eye. Should John tell him what he really thinks?
Sherlock bursts out laughing, much to his own surprise. Not missing that fact, John starts in too and they both descend into quiet giggles when the receptionist gives them a stern look.
“Good, good,” some of the edge fades from Greg’s voice and he eyes the other two as he continues. “Why don’t we all have a seat, shall we? Talk like civilized adults. I’m sure Sherlock wants to know more about Dr. Watson as much as I do, if he can behave himself.”
“John,” he says gently. The doctor looks up at him in surprise, his eyes sparkling and wet. Sherlock furrows his brow. “John?”
Thank you for your undying support! I hope you're still all out there reading and loving it. I've been missing some of my old friends, but I know you'll be back commenting again soon. And for anyone who hasn't shared, but has thought about it, your thoughts are welcome. I love all the stuff people come up with. Quite often, deeper meanings and events or dialogue I hadn't even realized were so pivotal are pointed out to me. I love it!
“John,” Sherlock whispers. It is nearly inaudible, but John sighs his response and Sherlock knows he has heard. Sherlock wets his parted lips and gathers the courage to continue quietly, hesitantly. “John, I…thought I’d lose you.”
“Good work, Riley,” Budreau replies, nearly sounding sincere. “Everyone’s wrapping up here. Get ready to move out.”
“Oh god, John. Are you all right? When you went over the side…” Sherlock pulls back, his hands still on John’s cheeks and looking him straight in the eye. “Did they hurt you? Did they put their hands on you?” he wraps his arms around John and pulls him close. “God, I love you. I love you so much. If you ever leave my side again I’ll…”
“It’s human,” his voice is quiet and sympathetic. He strokes with his middle finger, trying to comfort the wonderous man before him. John still won’t look at him. “Bill?”
She can only nod a pained grimace and then let her mouth fall open in a silent scream as pain racks her body. At John’s advice, she tries to keep her body limp as he and the two men lift her onto the stretcher and strap her in. She still bites off moans with every movement and looks more than a little grateful once secure. John turns to Sherlock while she is being wheeled away.
“I did once,” John replies in a choked voice. He clears his throat and seems to collect himself. Watching the struggle to reign in his emotions, Sherlock desperately wants to take his hand or even take the man into his arms. His body aches with the urge to comfort John in any way he is capable.
“John, I wasn’t expecting…” Sherlock begins while opening the door. John pushes in, effectively shoving him out of the way and shuts the door quickly. He looks Sherlock over as though he is looking for...what? Then he scans as much of the condo as he can see from where they stand, going so far as to take a few swift steps in to peer down the hall suspiciously. Befuddled, Sherlock watches his movements closely and takes a quick step back when John suddenly advances on him.
I kind of want to do what they did at the beginning of Deadpool 2 - run the credits and start asking questions instead of using the real credits.
And now, because there has been banter and because the way this Part ends it could easily be the end.
I hope this chapter finds you all well and anxious for more. Honestly, I hope this provides a nice escape for you all. We are living in some crazy, crazy times. This has been a weird week with all the updates and changes. I hope everyone is okay.
Onward to the final chapter! There's so much to do, so much for John to remember. What, Jane, what will happen? I can already hear your questions, but... Instead of me asking them in true Deadpool fashion, why don't you ask them in your comments and propose answers? If you come up with something REALLY good maybe I'll tell you if you're right or not. Haha! And to think I didn't think I was in my usual playful mood tonight. Guess I was wrong.
“I want to finish the film,” Sherlock replied decisively and then with a wicked smile, the tip of his tongue sliding along his lips. “I want to rub your feet.”
Good god! A seemingly innocent character is introduced and turns out to be a psycho killer?? Jane, isn't this a bit old hat for you? LOL. I know you're thinking it, but we're talking about Sherlock and John here. Murder and mayhem are the spice of life. And sex. Really, really good sex. Hmm. A hint at what's to come??? Come. Bahahaha! Oh, I'm feeling sassy tonight and maybe a little naughty.
She nods and squeezes her eyes shut tightly. Sherlock fills the pitcher with water from the tub and pauses, holding it over her head.
Sherlock shuffles his feet as he thinks, visualizes each play and all possible outcomes. His feet slide back and forth easily on his quads. Sherlock often dons his own workout gear and black skates for practice. He prefers to skate with the ladies rather than lord over them from the sidelines, providing critiques like most coaches. But he has always been unconventional. His unusual ideas and knowledge of the sport factored heavily into the Rock City comeback after a 23 year slump. In the 49 years since the inception of the Detroit Rock City Rollers, there had never been such a coach and there is still no other coach like him in all of the league.
Sherlock pauses to sip from his wine glass. John is looking at him with rapt attention like he is the most interesting person on the planet. Sherlock tries not to dwell on this and also tries desperately to ignore the flip in his belly.
“Why not? You’re here already and you’re right about your state of dress, especially considering the blood. You can’t go anywhere looking like this.”
And then John realizes he has been staring at Sherlock for way too long. He blinks and looks away, puffs out a nervous breath.
“Doesn’t matter,” he slurs. The sound of sirens reaches their ears and Sherlock takes his eyes off the man to see a police boat heading toward them, along with three other boats that saw the flare. Moriarty’s next words recapture his attention with their unbridled cruelty. “You’re too late to save your precious John Watson. He’s dead at the bottom of the lake and you will
John laughed again at that and rested his hands on his hips. He looked at Sherlock with fond eyes, dancing inside that he had not bollocksed up the whole thing, and trying not to let his imagination run wild at where this might go.
I haven't changed the chapter count yet, but I'm certain it will be at least 11 now. I'll obviously let you all know if that changes.
He knows people with enemies who use others to get to them. What can I say? He's going to be kidnapped more than a few times throughout his life. Let's just hope he always comes out unscathed.
“I hope you know, John, that this is not going to be one-sided,” Sherlock told him sternly, ignoring the question. “I want to know everything about your cases as well.”
“What?!” Greg’s jaw drops. He doesn’t know what to say. He has absolutely no idea. John has not been with the organization long and is not acquainted with all… Forget it. They don’t have enemies, save the Demons, and they are just rivals, really. And murder? No, no, no. It can’t be something from John’s past. He is squeaky clean, perhaps the most likable person on the planet, which really just leaves one thought in Greg’s mind. “What the fuck is going on?”
“Has he?” Sherlock asks with a lopsided smile. John gives him that cheeky grin and they descend into laughter. Sherlock leans back on the couch, rests his hand on his belly and looks at John. The doctor wears an almost wistful expression. A slow smile creeps onto Sherlock’s face, but doesn’t quite reach his eyes before his lips turn down into a frown. “Mike called you at midnight?”
With jaws dropped, all three sets of eyes sweep over to look at John and see him asleep on the bed. The covers are pulled up to his waist, his unharmed left arm laying over the blankets, his face peaceful in slumber. All in all, he also looks exactly the way he did before. All eyes return to Mycroft in question.
“It’s a big city,” Billy replies. “They are Rock City’s biggest rival. Bouts with them are always the worst and hardest hitting.”
“I did, yes,” he straightens to his full height, which with the skates is impressive, “until you hired someone to replace him on a whim.”
“But they’re blindsided, Sherlock,” John ventured. “I’m asking and I think it’s fantastic. I do. It’s amazing.”
Meanwhile, our poor detective still wars with himself on his role in Rosie's life as well. Is he her father? One minute his mind says yes and the next no. John is back and HE is Rosie's father, so where does that leave Sherlock?
I think I'm going to try and post chapters every few days instead of waiting a whole week. I can't help myself.
“John,” Sherlock whispers urgently and John knows. He tilts his head in acquiescence, allowing Sherlock to push the blanket off of his right shoulder. The doctor takes a long pull from the teacup before giving it to Sherlock so he can place it on a nearby table. John sighs and raises his arms, angling his head down to look at Sherlock’s new discovery.
John cocks a brow and his blue eyes begin to cloud. He opens his mouth to protest, but Sherlock cuts him off.
“What the hell is wrong with you?” his deep baritone booms while not actually raising beyond normal volume.
Sherlock’s eyes widened and he blew out a quiet breath that drifted over John’s lips. He was so close. His face was almost touching Sherlock’s. His lips were
He pauses to run a hand through his hair and cover his mouth in thought. When he removes it, he also shuffles his feet closer to Sherlock’s, bringing them even closer.
I know, I know. First Sherlock has nightmares featuring Jim and now John too. Come up with something more original already! I would, friends, but night terrors and panic attacks can be a totally normal part of emotional trauma after rape, and they're what I've decided to do here. My poor John has so much to work through and thinks he needs to do it all alone. He is most definitely a strong man, but there is no weakness in asking a certain consulting detective help him. Greg is a good foil and friend to both men, but what a difficult position to be in, no?
“My god, I can’t believe this. This...this is amazing,” John mumbles and wets his lips. “Is this a dream?”
John rounds the doorway and steps inside the room to see his flatmate lying on the floor, blood oozing from a small hole in his chest. One side of his white button-down is already covered with wet crimson, making his already pale skin look sheet white. Quite a few items normally on shelves lay on the floor around him, no doubt pulled down with several attempts to pull himself up to stand or for a towel to stop the bleeding.
Sherlock places the instrument and bow back in the case and moves toward the door, but pauses mid-step when there is another soft knock. He rolls his eyes and places his hands on his hips. This has happened before. There’s only one person it could be and Sherlock is beyond ticked off. He stomps the last few steps, releases the deadbolt in one swift movement and jerks the door open.
“Sherlock,” she begins in a motherly, but stern tone, “surely you trust me to make sure nothing like Anderson ever happens again.”
Sherlock stands in his own spare bedroom, surveying everything to make sure he has not forgotten something. John is looking back at him and holding a dark blue t-shirt in his hands. Sherlock hopes it fits well enough. There is a pair of sweatpants in one of his drawers that is far too short for him, but he is quite certain it will fit John well enough. He just has to find them before they talk with the police in the morning. John does not know it yet, but Sherlock intends upon going with him to his apartment. He has already composed the all-team email stating he will not be in the stadium for morning workouts. He has also resolved to look over every inch of the apartment. Sherlock Holmes is no detective, but he will damn well solve this mystery so he can look the man who tried to murder John in the eye when he breaks his nose.
“No, of course they are important. I just feel… vulnerable.” Sherlock’s voice had gone very small, which didn’t sit well with John.
Mycroft rocked his head side to side, considering. “That could mean I’m unprepared. It also could mean I know exactly how this is going to play out.”
Sherlock jerked awake a few hours later. Cursing, he rubbed his face roughly before stilling. He could hear a faint whimpering coming from the guest bedroom.
“Alright, well I’m hungry, so let’s see what we can scrounge up.” Greg started moving into the house. “Kitchen is…?” He looked back at Mycroft. Silently, Mycroft pointed left. Greg followed his finger and wandered into a surprisingly modern kitchen.
“Are you going to go find your boyfriend?” Sherlock smirked as he watched Mycroft grin at his phone.
The two men got up and left, Sherlock quickly hailing them a cab and getting them efficiently back to Baker Street.
“I’ll text you and we can set up another date,” Mycroft murmured to Greg, taking both his hands and leaning in close. Gently he pressed their lips together, relishing in the feel of Greg melting against him and feeling Greg’s hands tightening in his own. “Goodnight,” Mycroft whispered against Greg’s lips when they pulled away.
“Fucking hell!” John shouted, looking after the cab. He lifted his arms and shook them slowly as he looked down his own body. He was soaked and filthy. A cab would never take him in this condition. He sighed and muttered angry curses as he touched his dripping shirt. His trousers were just as wet, and cold. Jesus, it was cold. It was going to be a long walk home.
“The two of us,” Sherlock repeats. His chest and cheeks feel warm as his feelings, so soundly stifled, bubble to the surface again. “Against the world.”
They spend another hour or so in easy conversation before bidding one another good night and going to their rooms.
* So now that Janine has come out of the woodwork, what if there's another Moriarty sibling? Hmmm? Wouldn't that just be a kick in the pants?
“Is nothing short of miraculous,” Sherlock ventures when John simply pauses. It sounds pompous, but it is exactly what John is thinking.
Mrs. Hudson and her husband founded the Detroit Rock City Rollers in 1970. By ‘78, the team was at the top of its game. Money was rolling in and Edward Hudson didn’t always use it for the best, or even legal, exploits. In spite of her own moral principles, Mrs. Hudson generally looked the other way because her focus was on the skaters. She made sure they had whatever they needed and even muscled men out of the organization if they proved to be disrespectful in any way. As it turned out, she should have extended the same treatment to her husband.
His eyes narrow as he considers his jammers to determine which ones fit with each strategy. He shuffles through individual tactics and assigns the ones that play directly to each woman’s strengths and personality. All of this is easy for him because he is a master at reading people and knowing what he shouldn’t know with only a look or two. He reads every strength and weakness after observing two trips around the track. He can see everything about one’s personal life as well, but turns that part of his brain off with the team so as to avoid invading their privacy. Mutual respect is also important in a successful team.
“Any. Thing,” Sherlock pins John with cold grey eyes. “He has no scruples. His moral compass is skewed. Classic personality trait.”
“Dance with me,” Sherlock said suddenly when the tempo of the music changed and echoed around them. John blinked at him, the words bringing him back from his thoughts. Sherlock was serious. He knew why John was at the club, who he was waiting for, and he was serious.
Sherlock rushes to the side of his boat with the intention of diving into the water to find John, but Moriarty hampers his plan. As The Crown pulls away, the man scrambles onto the built-in seats across the back of the deck and jumps into Sherlock’s boat with a loud scream. Sherlock sees him coming a fraction too late and has no time to react before their bodies collide. They fall to the floor together, Sherlock on his back and the smaller man on top of his lithe body. The back of his head hits the wood with a crack and his vision blacks out for what feels like a few seconds. When he opens his eyes, Moriarty’s hands are around his throat and precious little air moves through his windpipe. Sherlock grabs Moriarty’s wrists and pulls at them as hard as he can to no avail. The terrifying little man is possessed with fury and strength greater than his stature should allow. Sherlock tries to change his grip, but the angle of their bodies works against him and he cannot seem to free himself from Moriarty’s grasp no matter how hard he tries.
“In case what?” John’s hands are on his hips. Well, one is more on his waist. Sherlock says nothing. “In case he comes back?”
On another personal note, this chapter has really shaped up into one of my favorites. As special thank you to my beta, MyBreadAndButter for her fabulous guidance and patience. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I.
By the time the doctor is finished, Sherlock’s eyes are closed and his fingers steepled before his chin. He visualizes it all in his mind, trying to keep his emotions at a distance. He has not been to John’s apartment, but knows the building and general layout for a unit. He watches the man grab John from behind in the kitchen and the ensuing struggle. Sentiment momentarily gets the better of him and he physically flinches when the second bullet grazes John’s hip. He breathes deeply and follows John out the window and down the fire escape.
“My time is far too valuable to spend it with such frivolities and imbeciles,” the brunette continued with his nose wrinkled as though the steak and kidney pie had gone decidedly off.
“Yeah, about that. When I first got here I was really abrupt and a little…” he closes his mouth suddenly and stares. “Wait. You’re...you’re glad I came?”
“No,” Greg cut him off. The two men looked at each other, brows furrowed in mutual understanding. The muscles in John’s jaw flexed as he gnashed his teeth. Greg sighed next to him and John broke eye contact only to look over the floor again in another unsuccessful attempt to find the man he sought while trying with all his might to ignore everything unsaid between them.
“She lives outside of London and travels in more often than necessary for business, which she does actually do while here so she doesn’t feel as guilty, but she mostly comes to see him,” Sherlock explained in a confident tone. He sounded as if he was reading a book. It could not possibly be something he just made up on the fly and John was captivated. He watched Sherlock’s face as it flowed from one expression to another. “They favor this club because no one who knows them typically patronizes dance clubs. Not to mention the atmosphere lends itself well to a certain anonymity for all its patrons.”
I've had a suggestion for anyone having notification troubles. Apparently, you can subscribe to me as an author and you'll get notifications about any works I post without fail. If you have simply bookmarked my series or one of its Parts, you may not receive notice of new chapters if the system goes wonky. However, I'm assured that subscribing to me JaneOfCakes will result in notice of all postings. I hope it works for those who are interested and try it. Thank you for sharing your vast knowledge of AO3 with me, Pat.
Brushing the thoughts from his mind, he looks at John again and hopes he did not notice the hungry look in his eyes, but knows he must have. He watches for any trace of reaction on the doctor’s face, but there is none. John opens his mouth to speak and his words are not at all what Sherlock expects.
It’s a low blow and John knows it. Sherlock hasn’t used in over a year. He bristles and glares down at John.
Sherlock’s face sours immediately, the mood completely shattered. He sneers and untangles himself from their embrace, pushing passed John.
4. Why is Sherlock being so moody around John and avoiding him so much? (I think we all know that answer to that one. wink wink nudge nudge say no more)
I'm sure some, maybe many, are disappointed that John did not kick the shit out of Jim before his demise, and that neither John nor Sherlock actually killed him. I just couldn't figure how Sherlock would have a gun and be able to use it without getting in trouble. Sure, he could have grabbed John's before he left the flat. Hell, he probably did, but it is an illegal firearm after all. It's not like Greg could just say he shot him, having never fired his weapon. I mean, they could've fired his gun too, but that would've ended with a massive cover-up I just didn't want to get into and we've seen already that Greg is one who wants to follow the rules of the law. Granted, he is to the point where he would do just about anything for John and Sherlock out of friendship and brotherly love, but they wouldn't want to compromise him by asking.
Aahhhhh. I'm shivering now, are you? Yikes! Needless to say, the next chapter is going to be rough. I'll try not to be late with it, but I can't promise to go easy on you. I have a reputation to uphold. Heh heh heh.
I hope you all enjoyed that. I certainly enjoyed adding in the comments that are supposed to be all of you asking me questions in return. :D I hope you all enjoyed the chapter and keep on coming back for the rest. I love you all and thank you for you support from the bottom of my heart. You help make my soul happy.
“Sherlock Holmes, their coach,” Riley gestures to Sherlock and John, standing over them now. “The new Dr. Watson and I believe that is James Moriarty, the coach for the Demons.”
“You don’t have to call us father if you don’t want to, Sherlock and John are fine,” Sherlock said, seeming to sense Liz’s dilemma.
“Thank you,” Mycroft said, crossing to him and putting his hand on Greg’s shoulder. “It means a lot how understanding you’re being.”
“Much.” Greg laid a soft kiss on Mycroft’s cheek. Mycroft shifted his head so that he could line his lips up with Greg’s. Gently he kissed Greg, moving his lips sweetly and softly. After a moment, they pulled away.
Sherlock stood facing the mirror by the front door, adjusting his tie. With the blessing of both their parents and the experiment leaders, the brothers had moved into their own flat as soon as Sherlock turned eighteen. Although they still used their parent’s driver and housekeeper, they were functionally independent, living off their inheritance and Mycroft’s paycheck.
“Sure,” Greg said, shifting until he was under the blankets, facing Mycroft and Jackie. Jackie looked over to see what all the commotion was about, watching Greg settle in. Greg put his hand on Jackie’s tummy. “Hi, gorgeous,” he said gently. She cooed gently back at him, reaching her hand towards him and opening and closing her fist. Mycroft put his hand over Greg’s, closing his eyes and falling asleep.
“Sore,” Sherlock mumbled. John could tell it was still a little swollen, and Sherlock would have spectacular bruising around it the next day, but he figured he was alright leaving it for the night. Placing the ice pack on the bedside table, John spooned up next to Sherlock and wrapped his arms around him, holding him close and carding his hand through Sherlock’s curls as he fell asleep.
“Some people move quickly,” Sherlock commented, grimacing at the thought of meeting someone once and dedicating oneself to them for the rest of their lives. Mycroft didn’t comment, opting to look at his phone instead.
“He is training to be a police officer at New Scotland Yard,” Mycroft said. “He comes from a family of French bakers. His favorite color is green.”
“Yeah,” John answered, picking up Liz and carrying her out the door. Although she had started to put on weight, she was still the size of a large toddler, and was barely a strain on John. Sherlock followed slowly behind, eyes glued to the wizards who were wiping the Muggles memories.
“Make sure he’s looked after. He’s not as strong as he thinks he is.” Sherlock’s eyes shifted to his police car.
Sherlock chuckled softly as he took another mouthful of cocoa, letting a marshmallow bump gently against his lips.
“Yes,” Mycroft contemplated his scotch for a moment before knocking it back and getting up to pour himself another. “More?”
“Sure,” Greg knocked his back, watching Mycroft bring the whole bottle over and place it between them.
“There we go, that’s a good girl,” John murmured as he shone the light in her mouth. Gently he ran his finger over her gums. She already had her four front teeth. “Gums look good, it doesn’t look like any other teeth are coming in yet but you should be expecting them shortly.” Handing Sherlock’s penlight back to him, John put his hands on Jackie’s head. She whimpered quietly but let him. “All looks good. Can you lay her on the table for me?” Mycroft did quickly as asked, holding her hand with his and keeping his other hand on her head. John quickly ran his hands over her stomach and legs, moving her legs around and checking her joints. Opening her onesie, he pulled it up and opened her diaper, checking for rashes or infection. He quickly fastened the diaper back on her, snapping the onesie back up. “All seems well here, I noticed she’s got a bit of a runny nose?” John asked, motioning that Mycroft could pick her back up. Doing so, Mycroft cradled her securely to his chest.
“Of course, my apologies.” Mycroft moved into the kitchen, Greg behind him; Mycroft removed a teabag from a mug that had been steeping on the counter.
“I won’t in public, but I can when we get home,” Mycroft offered ominously. Sherlock grumbled but didn’t make another comment.
Sherlock picks up the violin case, the wine glass in his other hand, and goes into the living room. He sets both items down on the coffee table and looks out the large window for a moment before closing the curtains. Finally, he bends down and lifts the beloved violin from its case, plucking up the bow as he does. After a moment of preparation, he begins to play. He closes his eyes reverently and sways ever so slightly. He plays and plays, careful not to be too loud in the quiet hotel. So consumed by his playing is he that Sherlock almost misses the gentle knocks on his door.
John did not have much time to feel sorry for himself. As he stood there staring at a sizable puddle at the edge of the street, a fast-moving cab splashed through it and sent a wave of dirty water over the front of his body. His eyes flew shut in the onslaught and he gasped out an “Oi” that the buildings around him swallowed whole.
Hello, my friends! I hope you are all having/had a lovely Sunday. I apologize for being late with this chapter. I decided to try out a beta and it is definitely a learning process. I hadn’t anticipated the extra time editing would take, or wanting so many “final” read-throughs. Mind you, I truly believe the chapter is better for it and thank her from the bottom of my heart. However....for whatever reason, I’m more freaked out about putting this chapter out there than any other so far. Haha. Whatever the case with me, I hope you all enjoy it.
“Oh, Sherlock, I know he hurt you. I’ll never forgive him for that, but you shouldn’t give up that part of yourself,” Molly touched his arm, putting her own Chubby Hubby pint in her lap. “You shouldn’t deny yourself the chance to be happy.”
“What do people usually say?” John wondered, trying to divert attention from his pink cheeks. Too quickly, but Sherlock made no sign that he had noticed.
“Merry Christmas, John.” Sherlock’s mouth turns upward at the corners as he looks over John’s face. The silence stretches into a minute, approaching awkward, especially since Sherlock’s smile has faltered and he now wears an expression of unease. “John, there’s something I need to tell you too.”
“Who shot at you, John?” Sherlock asks without preamble. He pins the doctor with such an intense glower that John cannot possibly look away or avoid the question. His smile fades.
Sherlock finds himself smiling back. Neither one says a word. The two men simply face one another, smiles inexplicably growing into grins. Sherlock could stay this way all night and all day tomorrow too. He would love nothing more than to have John as a house guest for any length of time, sharing stories and jokes.
“Well, I can’t wait to hear this,” Greg crosses his arms over his chest. John hesitates. “Oh, come on. You can’t say that and not tell me.”
“Homes,” John says unexpectedly and Sherlock’s heart stops. His silver grey eyes widen and his lips turn up into a smile. It is possibly the biggest smile Sherlock has even worn. John remembers him. John Watson knows him on sight, in spite of everything. Sherlock’s heart swells to two hundred times its original size and the yes flows past his lips in a voice so quiet and happy it scarcely sounds like his.
What? What? Jane, how can you give us such awesome things like John and Rosie hugging and John grabbing Sherlock's hand to invite him to stay, and then taking it right back with Sherlock crying tears that are not out of joy?? Why, Jane? Why????
How'd you like this chapter, friends? I love it. As well as the next few chaps. They remind me of my honeymoon in Cornwall. It was gorgeous and so much fun. A friend of my husband's was there with us. I know, I know, odd for a honeymoon, but it was brilliant. He grew up in Cornwall and took us all around. His family still lives there and we met up with all of them every night for dinner. He even gifted us his sister's cottage that she rents out. If you ever have the chance to go there, GO.
On that note, I expect I'll release the last chapter tomorrow or the next day. Work on Part 3 is about to begin! I'll get it up as soon as I'm able.
They made their way to the checkout, Mycroft quickly unloading his cart and watching the salesperson ring it through. He sent off a quick text to his driver, requesting he come in and help bring out his purchases. Jackie was starting to get fussy now, kicking her small legs and narrowly missing Mycroft’s crotch. She was also pursing her lips and wrinkling her nose.
“Have you talked about those feelings? It is kind of important that John be there when you need him, is it not?” Evan asked.
“Sounds good,” John answered, turning to the racks of robes. Hermione and Ron slid past them and to the children’s section. “Oh, Sherlock, look! You and Liz could match!” he said, pulling out a pair of dark purple robes.
“I know. I do,” Sherlock insisted when John looked at him in disbelief. “It’s just- I don’t attach myself to people easily,” he said stiffly. “And when I do, I do it fully. Irrevocably. With all of my being.” His injured fist clenched momentarily and then sprung open again. “I don’t think I’ve ever been this worried,” Sherlock admitted. “Except maybe at the pool, when you had that bomb strapped to your chest.” Sherlock met John’s eyes and John could see all the hurt and worry that Sherlock tried to keep hidden bubbling to the surface. Sherlock’s lips tipped downwards momentarily and it was all John needed to surge forward, arms like a vice around Sherlock’s torso as Sherlock’s knees went weak.
“Yes, now put your shirt back on, let’s go!” Sherlock scooped up John’s jumper that had been discarded earlier and shoved it at John’s chest.
“It’s not a waist trainer, since that is a soft limit for you,” Mycroft started. “And of course it’s only our first one. I thought I would go simple since you weren’t there to pick it out. There are thousands of styles, Gregory, you wouldn’t believe. There are ones that look like vests, and ones with shoulder straps and overbust ones. They also come in a variety of colours and fabrics. There’s really no limit.” Mycroft realized he was babbling and stopped talking, waiting for Greg to say something.
“Please,” John said. Sherlock disappeared into the kitchen and John looked down, watching Liz’s face. In sleep, she seemed so much more peaceful and John felt sorrow over the stress that someone so young had already endured. He gently brushed back hair from her forehead, looking up when Sherlock re-entered the living room. He took his mug with a grateful smile, taking a sip before leaning forward and putting his mug on the coffee table. They sat in silence, Sherlock retreating into his mind palace and John enjoying the peace and quiet.
When he next looked up, Liz’s plate was clean and Sherlock’s was half gone. John smiled softly and finished off his own toast.
“That was very generous of you,” Mrs. Hudson answered. “You’re in good hands,” she said, turning her attention to Liz. “Can I bring you boys up some biscuits?”
I wish I wasn’t a submissive, Sherlock thought desperately, closing his eyes and blowing out the candles as hard as possible. The cake was quickly cut after that, and eaten efficiently. Sherlock soon went to bed, barring the door behind him.
Mycroft looked at her for a moment. “No, it will be quicker if I go and do it myself.” He was in a “if you want it done right, do it yourself,’ state of mind.
“I’m curious,” Sherlock shrugged. “And bored. We both know that I enjoy pain to a certain extent, that’s evident from my reactions to any corporeal punishment I’ve experienced. I’d like to experiment and see how much and what kind I enjoy.”
“Of course,” Mycroft chuckled. He plucked them off the table and passed them to their respective child.
“Oh,” he said, patting the hand that was at his navel. Liz unsnaked her arms after a moment and Mycroft turned to see her properly. “Take care of your fathers, alright?”
John gently took the phone from Sherlock’s hand and put it on speaker phone, putting it down on the table. He spread his kit out on the table as well, pulling out a pair of tweezers and getting to work.
“I must get inside. Have a good evening John, Sherlock.” With that, Mycroft stalked past them and into the house, bypassing the crime scene tape and the constable stationed there.
“Did you just admit that you made a mistake?” Sherlock asked incredulously from the doorway, Jackie held on his hip.
The silence was broken when Sherlock’s phone pinged with an incoming message. He took his phone out of his pocket and glanced at it, noticing it was eleven thirty.
“Good boy,” John praised, running a hand through Sherlock’s hair. “Now, I think we’ll start with a spanking, how does that sound?”
They spent most of the morning like this, Jackie occasionally making a break for it and Mycroft quickly catching her before she crawled too far. It was around lunch that their day changed.
“Older brother, who is the dominant of the pair, is embarrassing himself somewhere on the dance floor,” Sherlock finished.
“Oh, Liz,” John sighed, giving up for the moment. He reached forward and cradled her to his chest, sitting so that she was curled up in his lap. “It was a tough morning, I know.”
“Here love,” he said, gently pulling Sherlock’s thumb out of his mouth and replacing it with the pacifier. “Now you’ll have both hands available to clean faster,” John grinned at his unimpressed expression and kissed him on the forehead. He went back over to the changing table, picking up the last of the supplies and putting them in their rightful place. Thankfully, none of the cream or powder had spilled, so it was a rather quick clean up.
“Hello.” Sherlock let the deductions fly through his brain fast and furious as they shook hands, and could discern nothing wrong with this sub.
“That does sound pretty funny,” Greg agreed, smiling at Alice as she appeared at the front entrance. “Hi, love,” he said.
“Liz, why don’t you and I go talk to Maisie, and John will stay in here with Dr. Witter for a few minutes. Does that sound okay?”
“Because this is a medical check up between doctor and patient. Now get out.” John slapped Sherlock lightly on the bum. “And take Jackie with you.”
“The more you know,” Greg said as they entered the store, the smell of baby powder and lightly scented products thick in the air.
“I think that would be best, for right now,” John answered. “As long as you don’t mind having her in the flat?”
"Anthea, we have a situation. Three guards are en route my way and I have a child with me. Ready the evac team. I will get the information and work my way out of here."
“Good,” Mycroft sighed, squeezing the back of Sherlock’s neck once before bringing his other arm around Sherlock, drawing him in for a hug.
Instead of making Mycroft feel better, that only seemed to make him feel worse. His face crumpled anew as he quietly started sobbing.
“Perfect.” John worked in silence for a while, puttering away in the kitchen. He made sure to keep his wand put away; although Liz was beginning to be comfortable around magic, he didn’t want to spook her any more than she already had been. “Do you want to help me?”
Their mother squealed. “Oh my goodness,” she cried, clasping her hands to her chest. “You’re going to move in together! Oh Mikey, that’s wonderful!”
“Well I can’t say much more than a botched mission,” Mycroft admitted, picking her up and propping her on his shoulder after grabbing a nearby muslin.
“Wow, that looks like fun,” John said from behind them, laying a hand on Liz’s shoulder. “But, I think we’re about ready to go home. Maybe we’ll stop at Florean’s on our way out.”
It took Liz another week to stop jumping at every small noise or movements. During that time, John and Sherlock talked to both Dr. Witter and Hermione about socializing Liz in other ways. With Dr. Witter’s approval, they had set up a date to meet Ron, Hermione and Rose in Diagon Alley for an afternoon.
"Well then she's in good hands." Marcia started packing up her equipment as Mycroft smiled goofily down at the baby in front of him, cooling compress still pressed gently to her forehead.
‘Yes, thank you.” Turning down the hall, Mycroft found the right door and pushed it open. He was met with the sight of John pacing the length of the room, Lestrade sitting on a chair with his head hanging, hands clasped between his knees. When the door opened, John stopped and spun towards it and Greg’s head shot up.
There was a loud clanking as they reached the lifts and a golden grille slid back, allowing them to enter. They got into the lift with three other witches and wizards and a handful of flying memos. Anthea pressed the button for the first floor.
A loud whoosh interrupted them and a bright flash came from the fireplace. Liz scrambled off the sofa and ran to the opposite corner of the room. Sherlock stood slowly, watching as a woman stepped from the fireplace. He moved so that he was between Liz and the fireplace.
The police force had had to deal with an armed robbery that went sour and, although he was only a lowly constable, Greg still felt responsible. The perp that they had tried to detain at the small shop had opened fire, mildly injuring some and severely injuring one other. Word was that the woman had been shot in the spine and would be permanently paralyzed for the rest of her life. Greg couldn’t help but think that if he had gotten onto the scene a second sooner, or if he had been the one talking to the perp, maybe he would have been able to talk them down. The rational part of Greg’s mind knew that it wasn’t his fault and there was really nothing he could have done, but yet he felt guilty and anxious.
“All of the above,” Sherlock said simply and John laughed heartily, his head ducking in even closer to Sherlock’s.
Sherlock’s brows furrow over narrowed eyes. His mind instantly begins testing and weighing every possible scenario.
“Thanks,” John says, his thumb lightly feathering up and down over Sherlock’s thumb to the back of his hand. “I know that wasn’t easy to say. Certainly not what I thought we’d be talking about when I walked here.”
John puts his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders and pushes him back until he bumps into the door to his condo. Sherlock looks at him with an expression of annoyance and he hopes
They stare at one another. Sherlock sees both fear and desire in John’s eyes? It is only then that he begins to notice other tells that he should have seen long ago. An elevated heart rate, flush blooming up John’s neck and onto his cheeks, and his pupils have grown tenfold. Sherlock is shocked to the core and his breath hitches again when he sees those gorgeous, perfect eyes with only a sliver of blue left flick down to his own lips. In fact, his whole brain screeches to a halt in stunning realization.
“She always takes turns tightly and comes in on the left,” Sherlock tells her. “Visibly brace yourself for the hit she wants you to expect and then make her miss. Hella and Smacks will pick her up. Groot, work on their blockers so The Woman can get through.” He looks around the circle at the face of each skater, the calm that only a plan can bring in his eyes. Each of their expressions changes in turn to reflect steady certainty where there had been chaos.
“That’s enough!” Greg slams his fist on the desk. The room is silent, all attention on him. “Why do I always find myself reminding you that, while your input is very important, Mrs. Hudson owns this team. She does
“Honestly?” John sighs when the man nods. “I don’t know what to think. He’s so easy to talk to and it makes me feel like I’ve known him my whole life. Then he’s cold and distant and would rather do anything but talk to me. He avoids me at practices and basically ignores me at meetings. He’s a fantastic coach though and boy, can he skate. He’s amazing.”
John bites his lower lip and shakes away those thoughts. This is no time to get distracted by desire, especially when John is this confused. What he feels, what he wants is so much more than the physical. John wants Sherlock’s mind and soul. He wants to know everything, feel everything. He wants to share Sherlock’s life. John can already feel Sherlock with him, even when he is nowhere near, like he is a part of him. John feels him down into his bones. It’s like nothing he has ever felt before and it is breath-taking.
John nearly face palmed. So much for not slamming all of his cards down on the table without even bluffing. Fortunately, Sherlock was not bothered by his enthusiasm in the slightest. He flashed a brilliant smile and gestured ahead. The two men began walking and talking, occasionally brushing hands as they went. By the time Sherlock opened the door to 221B on Baker Street, John knew this would be the relationship to end them all and he would forever be at the side of Sherlock Holmes.
Suddenly the lights went up and a new song filled the club. Sherlock turned his head toward John and he felt the puff of Sherlock’s hot breath on his neck. A shiver traveled down the length of his spine and he hoped Sherlock had not noticed, but was quite certain he had. To John’s great delight, Sherlock seemed genuinely pleased with what he saw.
John turns his back on the smug bastard and stomps toward the door, only to stop and spin around to face him again when he hears the man’s reply.
Moran twists in surprise, trying to avoid the flare. He needn’t have bothered because Sherlock is nothing if not accurate. He did, of course, want Moran to believe he had aimed at him so the man would play right into his hands. Moran’s sudden jump to avoid it rams his body into the side of the boat, doubling him over and right into the water after John. He splutters after resurfacing, blinking his eyes rapidly in lieu of rubbing them.
Greg teases and grins at Sherlock’s irritation, even as he pretends to ignore him. He watches the man he has worked with so long and has come to call a friend, trying not to chuckle at his grumblings. And then, quickly dropping all pretense and fixing Sherlock with a serious gaze, he goes for the jugular.
“I’ve given it all up,” Sherlock says fiercely, but his voice trembles. “Love, relationships. I let myself fall in love and it nearly broke me. I can’t let myself be hurt like that again. I threw myself into derby and never looked back.”
The grin broadens as she takes John’s hand in her smaller one and guides him to the table. Sliding a piece of toast buried under globs of jam across to the nearest chair, Rosie drops his hand and nods toward it.
“He’s not my date,” Sherlock says quickly in a clipped tone, feeling his cheeks growing hot and hoping they aren’t as pink as they feel.
“I was born here,” he says simply. “In a suburb. Our house was on a cul de sac. It was one of those storybook neighborhoods. Everyone knew each other, the schools were close, we skated to the playground.”
Well, now what shall we do now? Perhaps a little Q & A? Or just the Q, as it were because I'm not giving you any hints as to what happens next. Mwahaha.
“What’s stopping you?” Sherlock thrusts his face close to Moriarty’s and scowls, staring him down. Moriarty grins back and twists their legs together. Bending both of his own, he forces one of Sherlock’s knees to hyperextend. The detective grunts in pain and Moriarty seizes the opportunity to shove him off. He lunges to attack, but Sherlock recovers quickly and holds him at bay. The two men wrestle around violently, each landing solid shots to the other’s face until Moriarty pushes away just enough to slash Sherlock’s wrist. He lets out a pained shout.
“Nothing. It’s just… You’re usually so polite and charming, but now…” Sherlock looks away coyly, but then snaps his gaze back to John and continues in a firm tone because he was absolutely
“Extra blankets are on a shelf in the closet,” he explains. John’s gaze follows his hand and then Sherlock as he turns to walk toward another door. “This is the bathroom. Go ahead and use the towels and washcloth hanging on the rack.”
keeping secrets from him. This is his team and these two idiots are part of it. He cannot manage shit if he doesn’t have all the facts.
John chuckled at his own quirkiness and somehow knew Sherlock would understand his sense of humor perfectly. Sure enough, the man’s mouth curled into a knowing smile and he cocked a brow. The expression made John think of Loki, God of Mischief himself. His chest gave into a tingling squeeze and he delighted in the pleasurable shivers rushing over his head and back.
Under the slight delay of paying for the cab ride, John walks into the flat in question and finds the detective at a table with his back to the door.
John makes a suggestion and it doesn't go exactly as planned, but the intrepid duo still get up to a little sumpin', sumpin'.
Sherlock bites his lip and ghosts his hand over John’s hip and thigh without touching the fabric of his boxers. He looks at the doctor with great unease. There is definitely more blood on the boxers than there was on John’s tee and it looks fresher. He wets his lips, unable to believe he is about to make his next suggestion.
“Yeah? Well, you could’ve told me. Given me a little warning maybe,” John ‘s voice is rising in volume even as his mind says
Will Mrs. Hudson be planning wedding things on her own while her boys are away? And what will John, and especially Sherlock, think of those plans?
“No, it’s…” he looks back at Sherlock with honest embarrassment.  He bites his lip and it is absolutely adorable. Sherlock almost flinches when his stomach flips this time. “Actually, yeah. I’d feel better about it.”
Oh, jeez. I have been a little vicious with those questions, now haven't I? Must be feelin' a little edgy. But...I do not apologize. 😈 Really I'm just in an odd mood this evening. Odd? Now? Go figure. Given that, I believe I'll leave you all with some my favorite DP words:
John stares Sherlock down for a few seconds, but not with piercing eyes or an angry expression. The paramedic gives a reluctant nod of concession and then Sherlock turns all of his attention to John. They gaze at one another for what seems like a long time until John sighs, shoulders relaxing a fraction.
Mycroft walked to his bedroom, picking up his cellphone and choosing Gregory in his contacts. Bringing the phone up to his ear, Mycroft listened to the phone ring twice.
“Fine, let go, I’ll tell you,” she said finally. She gasped out an address as Mycroft let go of her shoulder. “It’s an abandoned flat that we were using,” she said as he let go, slumping in the ropes binding her to the chair.
Getting into the flat, Greg turned on the light and took off his coat, hanging it absently on the hooks by the door. He was the first one home but he hadn’t gotten a text from Mycroft, which meant he should be home shortly.
John, who had been standing on the other side of the room examining the body, had started making his way to Sherlock when he had started his tantrum. He reached Sherlock and crossed his arms, a mirror image of the D.I.
“I’m happy he’s got something to occupy his time, although I am worried about him when I can’t come on cases.”
“Great, back to bed we go,” Greg answered, turning and slowly directing Mycroft back to the bed. When Mycroft was tucked under the covers, Greg stood back. “I’m going to make us something to eat,” he said. “I’m not sure exactly what time it is, but we should both eat, that’s what I know. Any requests?”
“I thought it was going to be Jackie first,” Greg groaned as he rolled out of bed. Glancing at the clock, he noted it was shortly past seven in the morning.
Greg could feel his resolve weakening at Mycroft’s sincere demeanor. “I’ll be contributing in part to the rent every month,” he insisted after a moment of contemplation. “And I’ll do more of the cooking.”
“Okay then, what’s your favourite restaurant in genral?” Greg asked, ignoring Mycroft’s embarrassment.
John glanced around the room, taking in the nappy paraphernalia scattered around the base of the changing table, and the toy box in the opposite corner that had been over turned, belching out it’s contents.
“I’m sorry Liz,” Sherlock said softly, putting his hand on her back. “I should have warned you. That was my fault.”
“You don’t fool me, Mycroft Holmes, I know you don’t sleep nearly as much as you should. But I’ll let you boys go early just this once. Take some cake for the drive home,” she instructed.
“Holmes,” Sherlock answered the phone. He listened for a minute. “Where? We’ll be right there.” He looked at John, a spark of excitement in his eye. “A case, John!”
“Can you watch her for a moment?” Mycroft asked, dumping Jackie in Greg’s lap without waiting for an answer and briskly walking to the front door.
“So, what do you have to say for yourself?” John asked as he removed his jacket, hung it and moved to the bathroom to get their first-aid kit.
Finally, Charlie and Alice had found all the eggs and sat on the floor, adding them up and evening out their piles. It was a tradition that they had had for as long as they could remember; they could race to see who found the most eggs, but at the end they would split the eggs evenly to be fair. When they were done that, Alice’s head popped up.
“Time to change her,” Greg said with a chuckle. Huffing, Mycroft got a changing pad out of the diaper bag, quickly picked Jackie up and laid her on her back on the pad, pulling down the tiny jeans and unbuttoning the onesie. He took off the soiled diaper, pausing only for a moment to check its contents before folding it up and putting it beside her on the mat. He finished up efficiently, getting her back in her clothes and throwing the diaper out in the small garbage in the room. He folded the mat back up and put it back in the diaper bag after sitting Jackie back on the bed.
Mycroft was seated in his plush leather chair, Greg knelt at his feet. They were in their apartment, Mycroft with Greg’s copy of the limit list in one hand and his copy balanced on his lap. His other hand was resting gently on the back of Greg’s neck. Their therapist had told them that they would have to write up a contract and file it with her at their next session. They had scened a few times previously, discussing what they were going to do before they did it. With a contract, that need for discussion would be lessened and would allow Mycroft to plan in advance. He had had Greg fill out the list and he filled out his own copy and then they had swapped, and they were taking the time now to go over them. Mycroft had asked Greg if he would rather sit on the couch, putting them on even ground, but Greg had insisted they do it with him kneeling at Mycroft’s feet- he claimed it grounded him.
“Unfortunately, yes,” Mycroft admitted somewhat reluctantly. “Does she need a change?” he asked, switching the subject.
“Whatever is fine,” Sherlock called back, stretching himself more comfortably on the sofa. “I don’t really ever cook or make tea. One more reason why I’m not a good submissive, I suppose.”
“I’ll see what I can do,” John left them to it, moving into the kitchen to the sound of Sherlock murmuring quietly to Liz. He waved his wand, summoning three mugs and spooning cocoa mix into them. He poured milk into all three mugs and waved his wand over them, bringing the mugs gently to a boil. He dropped three marshmallows into each mug. Then, he levitated the mugs and directed them into the sitting room. Liz eyed them warily when they floated into the room, but accepted the one that stopped directly in front of her.
They drank their tea and chatted easily as Greg bounced Jackie on his knee, and when he was done he handed her back to Mycroft and made his way towards the door. “You be good for daddy now,” he said as he exited. “Don’t give him too much trouble.” Then he smiled at Mycroft. “I’ll see you soon.”
“It’s not surgery, Sherlock, no need to look so scared,” John said with a smile. “Hold her head up a little more.” Sherlock adjusted accordingly. He couldn’t take his eyes off of her as she greedily sucked the bottle back, hands resting on either side of the bottle. John smiled at the sight of them completely enraptured in one another. When Rosie started pulling air, she popped the nipple out of her mouth and whined. Silently, Mrs. Hudson slid over the applesauce she had pulled out of the fridge.
“Well, we’re pretending to be a couple. We need to have a story. Are we married? Engaged? Just partners? How did we meet? Where’s our favourite place to go on dates? Whose is she?” Greg continued, pointing at Jackie, “Do we raise her together? When did we get her? Or was she yours and now we’re in a relationship and maybe I’ll help raise her one day but for now we’re seeing where it will take us?” That last scenario hit Greg too close to home. He could easily see himself integrating himself into Mycroft’s life and eventually raise Jackie alongside him.
“Yes, one moment.” Sherlock flounced to the coat stand and slung his Belstaff onto his shoulders, his blue scarf wrapping around his neck. “Alright, let’s go.”
Sherlock considered the blonde for a moment. “Will you be trying to dominate me while we acquire said drink?”
“I’ll do that,” Greg said, also moving towards the coffee maker. “You take this,” he handed Jackie over to Mycroft, “have a bit of a cuddle since I got to first, and I’ll finish making breakfast.”
"No," Mycroft responded sternly. "I will take care of her. For now at least." An inexplicable sense of protectiveness washed over him and he looked down at the little girl sleeping peacefully in his arms. Silently, he promised never to let her go.
“Charms of living in a small town, I suppose. Also happy babies tend to make happy adults,” Greg shrugged. An older woman at the next table over leaned over.
“About half an hour. They collected evidence around the room but no one has approached the body yet.”
“You weren’t there.” He glared at Sherlock for a moment. “She broke a mirror with her voice. She also threw toys and paints. From across the room.” He pointed to the far wall where smears of paint were slowly dripping down it. There was a small pile of toys where wall met floor.
“It also says she hasn’t gotten her pokes yet,” John said, closing the folder and handing it back to Anthea. “We’ll need to do that pretty quickly.”
“I will, in fact,” Greg said. “And I won’t stand any more arguing about it. Just because I said I love you doesn’t mean I’m not still angry at you,” Greg said, giving him a pointed look.
“You were in London on business and we met when you were taking Jackie to the same park I took my kids to. You and I hit it off from there.”
The meal passed quickly, conversation flowing as food disappeared. Dessert followed, Sherlock making minimal remarks about Mycroft’s weight. Jackie was allowed a sliver and gleefully spread the chocolate over her face, arms, the tray of her high chair, and anyone within reach of her sticky fingers, including both Mycroft and Sherlock.
“I think that went well,” he said as he curled up against Sherlock, leaning his head on his shoulder.
“As I was saying,” his mother continued drily with a raised eyebrow “there is an important matter we must discuss with you.” Mummy took a fortifying breath.
“Sounds great. That’s where we’ll say we had our first date, then,” Greg said. “And if we get asked anything that didn’t come up, leave the answers to me?”
Sherlock looked abashed. “No, and I truly am sorry for that.” He ducked his head, tapping his forehead gently against John’s. John could see there was true shame in Sherlock’s eyes.
Sherlock, caked from the knees down in mud, stomped over to the stairs. “No!” he shouted back petulantly.
“I have an announcement to make, actually,” Mycroft said, absentmindedly forking a piece of roast onto his plate. Putting down his fork, he straightened and re-straightened the napkin in his lap. “Gregory and I are moving in together,” he said, glancing up.
"Stay" he told her firmly, positioning his gun in his hands and leaning around the corner, taking aim and firing at the guard. He watched as his bullet passed unerringly through the guard’s heart, a searing pain lancing his side as he watched the guard fall. Belatedly, he realized the guard had also fired and, lifting his arm, Mycroft noticed a graze along his ribs that was starting to bleed freely. "Great," he muttered, switching his gun to his injured side as he bent down and scooped up the child, propping her on his uninsured hip. The baby had not stopped crying but had tucked her thumb in her mouth and went with Mycroft without resistance.
John led him to the bathroom, sitting him on the toilet seat while he turned to start the bath running. When he had set it to the right temperature, John turned back to Sherlock, stripping him out of his dress shirt but leaving him in his nappy for the time being.
John walked over to the edge of the bed and picked up the flogger, running the leather straps against his hand before looking up at Sherlock.
John sighed. “No, of course not Sherlock. You’re right, as always.” John didn’t sound particularly happy about it. “I want everything, too. But that means changing nappies in the middle of the night, giving me space when I need it and comforting me when I need it. It means sleepless nights of worrying and early mornings of fevers and colds and work. Are you really ready to sign up for all of that?”
“That’s natural in any big change in one’s life,” Dr. Witter agreed readily. “But you’ve got a great support system in place, and I’m only an owl or phone call away.”
The press of bodies was excruciating. One hundred dominants and one hundred submissives, all of whom had been successfully coded to crave one another. This was the first gathering of all of them at one time. There had been smaller focus groups and endless meetings with doctors to monitor his hormone levels, as well as meetings with therapists to discuss how to deal with things unique to the situation, such as subdrop and subspace, but never a large gathering.
“Nope, you don’t. Now, I’ll go grab a pair of your spare pajamas and we can get you settled. I can take the sofa if you want?”
“You had it, you just needed someone to tell you that you had it,” Greg said, bouncing Jackie on his knee as he handed her the bear and took a sip of his drink.
Without any further prompting Greg dug his fingers into the folds in the paper, gracelessly ripping the paper off and discarding it. Opening the box, Greg’s breath caught in his throat as he pulled out the male corset nestled in the box. It was a simple black affair, made of thick rich fabric and delicate whale boning, gold buckles running in a line down the front. It was an underbust, the kind that followed the line of his pectorals.
“It’s not that hard to believe,” John answered, pulling away so that he could look at Sherlock fully. “I mean, you helped that D.I. without asking for anything in return.”
“Level one, Minister for Magic offices,” a cool voice announced from overhead. Anthea led the way out of the lift and now it was John who was trying not to gawp, head craning around. He had never met or even been near a Minister of Magic before.
“You could, but you won’t. You know why?” Greg asked in a false cheery tone, intent on keeping Jackie quiet. “Because Mycroft’s got more of an influence in this town, hell in this country, than you and whoever you work for do. And you know that if you scream, sure you may be uncuffed for now, but more likely you’ll just be brought into custody where you will rot. And even if you are set free, there’s no way you’ll escape for long. Mycroft has people. Mycroft’s people have people. You will not win.” Greg shot a shark-like grin at the woman, who looked away from him.
John looked at him for a moment, already feeling the pull to his bed. “If you insist,” he relented after a moment.
They went down the list of services, Sherlock rating them steadily. Once they were done, they went back to where they had left off in the list and went down from there.
When she saw she had both their attention, Liz untangled her hands from Sherlock and John’s, wrapping one around the locket and the other in the hem of her shirt.
“M’kay,” Greg heaved a deep-belly sigh. Slowly rousing himself, he put his hand on Mycroft’s thigh and rubbed his face into Mycroft’s knee lie a kitten reluctant to wake from a nap, whining a little bit in his throat.
“I was just stopping by on my way to work to drop off the saline and bulb syringe,” he answered, brandishing a small plastic bag.
“Fantastic,” the woman said, voice slightly awed. “Before that booster, that cold would have killed her,” she told Mycroft. “I’ve got all the files on the booster right here,” she said, pointing at the papers spread out in front of her.
“Thank you?” John said, accepting the garment bag and draping it on his chair. Carefully he pulled the zip down, revealing two sets of casual robes, one in black and the other significantly smaller in periwinkle blue. “Oh, thank you!” he said more enthusiastically, grinning over at Sherlock and Liz. “But how did you know we were going to Diagon Alley?”
“It has relevance because I need to know you are going to come home to this little girl and that you are going to come home okay and frankly, she’s too young to worry so that comes down to me so now I’m worrying for the both of us and I care about you!” he practically shouted. He paused, catching his breath and controlling his voice. “You are such a great father, and you need to make sure that you come home alive for her and for… me.” Greg stood there and glared at Mycroft for a moment before turning and heading to the kitchen, Jackie still on his hip.
“Of course,” Mycroft sighed, resigning himself to being wrapped around the combined finger of Greg and Jackie. “There’s a restaurant a few doors down. We will drop the groceries at the car and eat there.”
“Oh boys!” she cried when she opened the door, still in her robe. “Rosie has missed you dearly, John,” she said as she opened her door wider, letting them in.
“My favourite animal is a tiger.” He smiled once more at Sherlock.“Are you thirsty? I could really go for some tea right now.”
Sherlock grumbled but didn’t put up a fuss when John pulled the plug in the bath, slowly draining the water. John gave Sherlock his hand and helped him up and out of the bath. He wrapped a big fluffy towel around him, rubbing his down until he was completely dry. Then, he got him to lie down on the floor while he put on his new nappy and his pajamas.
“I do, I do. Come get me if there’s anything at all, alright?” John kissed Sherlock on the top of the head.
“Yes sir,” the driver answered. They pulled away from the curb and into the light traffic. It was before rush hour so the roads were relatively clear. In no time they pulled up to a plain brownstone building.
“And I am so lucky that you agreed to give this relationship lark a try with me. I love you so much.” John was gently carding his hand through Sherlock’s curls. “I’m going to give you a massage, okay?” Sherlock hummed his assent, already slipping into a non-verbal state. John slid behind Sherlock on the sofa, gently running his hands down his neck before digging his thumbs into the meaty part right below it. He made a slow progress down Sherlock’s back, careful to touch every inch of t and to make sure very knot in Sherlock’s back got proper attention. While he was doing that, he was murmuring constant praise and affection into Sherlock’s ear, reminding him how special and loved he was.
“We won’t hurt you.” He reached out a hand but stopped when the girl whimpered again. He withdrew his hand. “It’s okay.” He sat for another moment. “Will you come out from there? We won’t hurt you, I promise.”
“Mummy hit me.” She placed a hand flat on her ribs. “It hurt a lot. I screamed. And then she was in the air.”
“You are most welcome,” Mycroft said stiffly, leaning over to pick up his copy of the adoption forms. He turned to fetch his umbrella from beside the door and, as he picked it up, he felt a pair of small arms wrap firmly around his waist.
"Copy that, sir." Huffing in frustration at the mission gone awry, Mycroft tucked his gun away and hurried over to the filing cabinet he had spotted by the workbench and opened the middle drawer, having deduced where the information he sought was located. Quickly pulling it out, he folded it and tucked it into its designated pocket on the outside of his upper right forearm. Turning back to the door, he caught sight of the baby on the workbench, face red as her body wracked with sobs.
“Apparently you made an impression on her last night and, by extension, I did too.” Sherlock shrugged. “I have a sneaking suspicion ours is one of the few kindnesses she’s seen in her young life.”
“ You’re okay.” John, throwing all caution to the wind, reached forward and effortlessly pulled Liz into his arms. As he did, he heard a loud thud behind him.
“Right,” Mycroft said, coming back into the sitting room as Greg finished wrapping the last present.
“Sherlock, leave her alone.” Greg walked over and pulled on Sherlock’s shoulder, prompting him to stand and take a few steps back. Greg took his place, kneeling in front of the girl but leaving a gap between them. “Can you tell us your name?”
“Sure,” Greg said, taking the glass. “You cuddle with your baby, I’ll be right back with tea for us. No getting out of bed, okay?” Greg’s tone left no room for argument.
Greg smiled as he complied, putting all the requested items on the bed as well as a couple of books. “Anything else?”
Turning back into his flat, Mycroft looked down as Jackie’s stomach grumbled. “Still hungry?” he asked. “Well, I suppose we were going to try solids today, weren’t we? Alright, let’s see what we’ve got here.” Mycroft moved into the kitchen once more and took stock. Reaching into one of the bags he had yet to unpack, Mycroft pulled out a small container of pureed bananas and a baby spoon.
“-seems she may have Apparated in her nervousness. I’ve got staff scanning CCTV as we speak.” Mycroft’s voice sounded tinny through the phone.
Greg cleared his throat. “Yeah.” He turned away from Mycroft and walked to the front door. “Who’s driving?”
John thought about how Sherlock going to the upstairs-bedroom-come-nursery gave a hint as to his headspace. If Sherlock was bypassing the usual dithering that came before he slipped into his little headspace, that meant he was already slipping down.
“Doesn’t look like poison,” Sherlock rattled off absently, not hearing John. “I don’t see any signs of contusions or injury of any kind. Have Molly send me the tox screen A.S.A.P. John, ready to go?”
Mycroft hung up his phone. “My staff have not spotted her on any CCTV yet, but they will continue looking.”
“It’s my pleasure, of course,” she said, leaning in and kissing him on the cheek. John stood and motioned for Sherlock to bring Rosie with him. He grabbed the nappy bag and their coats and exited the building. Sherlock followed after giving Mrs. Hudson one last kiss on the cheek, Rosie balanced on one hip.
“Mycroft, can you turn towards me please?” Greg asked softly, but with authority. Mycroft rolled over so that he was facing Greg, curled in the fetal positing with one hand tucked under his cheek. Greg reached for the other hand, cradling it in one of his own.
“If we feel ourselves nearing that point, or if we notice it in the other, we make time to take care of each other,” Mycroft answered, Greg nodding along with him.
"I believe that's my line," Mycroft drawled, an eyebrow raising elegantly as he thumbed the safety on the gun. The woman’s eyes darted quickly between the gun, Mycroft's face, the child and the workbench.
“I’m pretty sure he has, actually,” John answered thoughtfully. “I seem to recall seeing him use his cell at the Ministry a number of times. Why would he withhold that information?”
“Play nice, both of you. You’re setting a bad example for the children. Alice, give Jackie to Sherlock, she seems to cheer him up.”
“Very.” They left it at that as John finished unwrapping the bandage and took a look at the stitches.
“In a moment, love. I’m just going to put some cream on you.” He grabbed a dollop of cream and smeared it along Sherlock’s back, making sure to work it into every inch. Then, he slid Sherlock’s pants down and rubbed cream into his red cheeks. Sherlock shivered at the cold cream but otherwise stayed still. When he was done, John put the cream on the bedside table and slid down so that Sherlock was laying half on top of him, arms snaked around his chest.
Thanks for reading, kudos and comment as you see fit :) I'll probably be slowing down on posts as life picks up speed, but worry not; this fic will not be forgotten.
When John got in the bathroom he opened the medicine cabinet to pull out his kit. As he did, he noticed Liz’s small toothbrush sitting patiently beside his and Sherlock’s and he felt his heart clench. He took a shaky breath and pulled out the kit, closing the cabinet resolutely and stalking back out to the kitchen.
“It’s me,” John called through the door as Mycroft’s screen came to life, showing that it was indeed John. Opening the door, Mycroft greeted him with a tired smile.
“Yes, he’s in his vest and pants. Hopefully I won’t see you too soon, there’s only so many times he can stand to injure himself,” Marcia said, letting herself out of the bedroom and out of the house.
“What has gotten into you?” John asked, stepping away from the bed and crossing arms. “Sherlock, this behavior is unacceptable. Now, do as your told and stand.”
Liz’s eyes widened and she dropped the crayon she was holding, reaching out to grab both John and Sherlock.
“Why?” Although they had done impact play, it had only ever been as punishment and only as a secondary to lectures and other non-violent punishments.
“Part-time. St. Mungo’s, the wizarding hospital, is attached to Bart’s. When I graduated, I went to Muggle University, but I also took Healer classes, sort of a combined program. It allows me to work at both Bart’s and Mungo’s. I end up splitting my shifts about 50/50.”
“It’s not whether it’s hard or not, it’s just the fact that we should both be contributing equally to this relationship.”
“It’s not for your sake that I’m asking you to leave the room. Now go. Please.” Sherlock narrowed his eyes but didn’t argue as he swept to the table, scooped up John’s bag and swanned out the door. “Alright, here’s the deal,” John said over Jackie’s distress. She had stopped pushing at Mycroft and was now sobbing into his chest. “You do not go Iceman on this baby, alright? She is depending on you for emotional support and you need to teach her how to express those emotions in a healthy way and I have no doubt that you will be able to do it and do it well but you can’t go cold on her, got it?” John now had his finger about an inch from Mycroft’s face.
“Well work faster,” Sherlock snapped as John tilted his hand, deciding whether it needed stitches or not. Sherlock ended the call, slamming his phone onto the table. “Fat load of good that did,” he groused, slouching in his chair as John pulled out butterfly bandages.
“Other test subjects,” his father replied, nodding. “And the leaders of the groups were scientists that were monitoring your progress.”
Sherlock sighed and sat up. “Yes, but that was as punishment. When you do it as punishment, it’s got more… emotion to it? I’m not sure I’m explaining this well. Do you get what I’m saying?”
John hummed in agreement. ”Well, as I’m sure Marica told you, no weight on the leg for at least a week, especially since we only did superficial stitches. She said nothing internal was hit but better to be too cautious than not cautious enough. Lots of rest and relaxation, fluids and nourishment, the usual. She left you a bottle of pain relievers there, let me know if you need the prescription refilled.”
“What was that?” a voice sounded from Sherlock’s side. Sherlock ran his eyes up and down the new-comer, soaking in all the information found on the blond-haired boy.
“I know you have a premature ejaculation problem,” Sherlock started. “And that you cry every time your mother leaves the house for an extended period of time. Also your taste in beer is atrocious,” Sherlock nodded to the offending beer in the other man’s hand.
They had indeed pulled up to the front of the house. As Sherlock was exiting the car, he got one more text.
“Okay, just give me a second,” Greg said, crawling over the bed and sitting himself beside Mycroft. “Put your arm around my shoulder.”
“That’s good, Sherlock, very smart.” John reached forward and ran his hands through Sherlock’s hair gently. “Now, I’m not really angry with you anymore, and although I should punish you, I think being punched is the nose is probably enough this time. Now, I’m going to put you into ‘space because you are getting dangerously close to drop and don’t tell me otherwise. I am sorry about not noticing sooner, love.”
“Yes, well that’s part of the reason we infiltrated it,” Mycroft answered. “This is of the highest security, and I would thank you not to go repeating what you hear in this room, Detective Inspector.”
Mycroft thought of the deaths he had seen, and the nausea that he felt earlier came roiling back full force as he bit back a gag.
“Ah constables, welcome to the crime scene. Could one of you please escort Mr. Horath off of the crime scene please?”
“Please Sherlock, Mummy and Daddy are worried. It’s been two hours and you haven’t been responding to them.”
“It’ll only be for two hours,” John said soothingly, looking down at Liz. “Sherlock and I will be right around the corner. If you need us, we won’t be far, alright?”
“Yeah, this is nothing to worry about,” Greg confirmed as Mycroft set the mug of tea before him. Handing the nappy back to Mycroft he continued, “has she eaten anything like beets, cranberries, tomatoes, anything like that?”
“Yes sir,” she said, pulling smoothly into traffic. She weaved the car deftly between the others, getting them out of London in record time. Greg and Mycroft rode in silence as they watched the city peter out around them, Greg quietly handing over Jackie to Mycroft once they both had settled.
“Well, I mean technically we can’t arrest her,” Sherlock mumbled under his breath, smiling disconcertingly at the passerby who had stopped to stare. “But here comes the man who can,” he said a little louder, nodding at the huffing D.I. “The wife, as predicted,” he said, gesturing to the woman and John, both struggling for dominance.
Settling himself on the sofa, Sherlock sat with his legs crossed, hands steepled under his chin. He would go into his mind palace to start sorting through the events of the day, but would stay on the surface so that he would hear if John needed his help.
“As I said, D.I. Nolan, a robbery gone wrong,” Sherlock said after a moment, stalking back towards John and the D.I. with Greg trailing behind him. “You’ll find the robber’s hair on the victim’s shoulder, and a piece of the attacker’s skin on his sleeve. He was wearing gloves when he came in, which is why there are no defensive marks on his hands. The robber tidied up after robbing the place, but there are scuffs in the dust marks where he put the frame back in place. I don’t think I’m needed here anymore.”
“Sherlock, don’t be mean,” Violet chided her son as she pecked him on the cheek. “We’ll see you next week.” Their father waved at them from behind their mother.
“Yes, we found some very nice robes for Liz,” Sherlock said, brandishing the robes draped over his arm.
“There’s nothing to apologize for,” Sherlock said, rubbing her back. “Accidents happen. You’re back with us now, that’s all that matters.”
They were just getting back from a case, one that had ended with Sherlock diving into a muck-filled river after a criminal. Despite his heroic act, he had missed the criminal and Lestrade’s crew had picked her up on the other side of the river. That left John to fish Sherlock out and drag him back home; the cab ride had been a silent one. John was unimpressed with Sherlock’s lack of self-preservation as well as his current attitude.
“Whom exactly would you want to have for company?” he asked, narrowing his eyes and trying to read Mycroft’s mind. His imagination immediately jumped to Mycroft having secret lovers that he wanted to have over, and Greg’s stomach curdled uncomfortably.
“Forced nudity around others, one. I would do it in front of Greg and Mycroft, but only if you really wanted it. I would not do it around anyone else, and it is not something that I find attractive or arousing.”
When they arrived, Sherlock flounced into the building and left John to follow. He held the door open for John at the top of the stairs, which earned him a quick word of thanks, followed by a brisk shove up against the wall and John’s lips crashing onto his. John made quick work of shedding both their coats and scarves, never breaking their kiss.
Thank you all so much for reading. I think this will be the last chapter, but as you can see this is now part of a series that will expand! Also, my keyboard has been a bit not good and sometimes keys don't work when I hit them so I tried to catch all of them, but there may be some missing letters. Again,if there's anything you want to see, please let me know. Special shout out to Lily, who gave me the idea for this chapter.
Sherlock was still sobbing quietly as John led him back over to the bed. John sat down, pulling Sherlock over his lap.
“Of course,” Mycroft said, putting his plate in the sink and whisking himself and Jackie out towards their room.
Sherlock’s arms wrapped around John’s shoulders and his face landed on top of John’s head. He curled as close to John as he could and just breathed, a long shaky sigh puffing over John’s hair.
"Not too soon, I hope. Bye, sir. Good luck." With a wave, Mycroft jogged to the waiting car and climbed in, letting his head fall against the headrest.
“We’ve already looked there-“ Greg started but was cut short when Sherlock flung the door open triumphantly. His face fell when he revealed nothing but an empty closet.
“I didn’t believe it at first,” Sherlock answered, still focused on his own paper. “I mean, magic, really? But then I saw Mycroft do a little bit and I realized it must be true. Then I was, I hate to admit, a little jealous. But I got over that, especially when I saw how his magic could help me,” Sherlock smirked.
“Sherlock, do you feel you’ve talked adequately about those feelings?” Evan at up in hi seat, eyes growing more intense.
“Of course,” he said, clearing his throat and pretending his eyes weren’t getting damp as he leaned down to kiss the top of her head. He wrapped an arm around her and Sherlock wrapped his other arm around her, and they stayed wrapped up tight until Liz fell asleep, a small smile playing on her lips.
“This is pointless,” Sherlock grumbled, crossing his arms. His long lanky form was folded into a plastic chair, and he was sat beside John. They were in the waiting room for their experiment-appointed therapist.
“M hm.” Sherlock rested his head once more on John’s shoulder, throwing his arm around John’s waist.
“Let me tell you how it will go, then,” she said. “We already know where you are hiding the child. After I take you out tonight, we will move out tomorrow and gather the child.”
Sherlock staggered forward a few feet once he had solid land under him again. He braced himself again the back of John’s chair for a moment before running into the bathroom. John could hear him being sick as he lay Liz down on the sofa, tucking an afghan around her. She stirred as she was shuffled.
Sherlock sat on Liz’s other side. As he did, a young woman came around from behind the bar and approached. “Hello, what can I get you?”
“Yes well, I figure it’s best not to lie. If you found out, you would punish me and since we are literally discussing, among other things, ways for you to punish me, I thought that honesty would be the best policy.”
“Ready for your robes?” John asked, standing from his chair. She nodded, holding her arms out behind her and letting John slide the robes on. He quickly fastened the clasp, stepping back and smiling. He could feel a warm glow emanating from his chest, and he looked away before he got too emotional.
“They hoped to create two types of people- those who were dominant and those who were submissive. In creating these two distinct types of people, they hoped that the population would be genetically predisposed to working together more amicably.” Sherlock felt his stomach sinking to his knees.

you do last night?” Greg jokes. Sherlock’s eyes go wide and he does not answer. Greg’s voice comes over the line again, his tone suspicious. “Sherlock…”
I think I can hear you all yelling one by one somewhere in the distance as you reach the end of the chapter. Needless to say, Sherlock is in quite a pickle this time. What's Giles going to do when he realizes he's taken someone who looks like Ben, but isn't him? Does not look good for Sherlock. Nope, not at all.
“If he’s so forthright, why has he given not even an inkling of his feelings on the matter?” Sherlock sniffs haughtily to hide his frustration.
“I’m flattered,” she laughed and then took on a more serious tone. “There’s nothing wrong with letting someone else in, you know.”
“Like what?” Sherlock raises an eyebrow curiously. John furrows his brow, crinkling his forehead and looking adorable.
