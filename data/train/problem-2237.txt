Hot water stings at the backs of my eyes, and I blink hard and look up towards the boundless sky, hand gripping tightly at my cane.
But then he catches sight of his gigantic, flushed face on the screen, awkwardly stuttering for words, and he pulls himself together, standing up straight like he once did for inspection and ignoring the pain in his shoulder.
Sam’s voice, as we cut to the interior of the helicopter in the pilot seat, looking out over the controls and the view: “You know, sometimes, when the weather is clear, and the wind is smooth, flying over these mountains feels like the best job in the universe. It makes you feel like you are the most lucky bastard on earth.”
He gazes up at it, still breathing hard, then tears his eyes away and frantically looks around the base. He turns to the cameraman.
John takes Greg’s hand, hidden from view by their bodies, and holds it tightly. Greg’s fingers are frozen.
To John’s horror, the giant screen suddenly changes, putting two videos side-by-side. On the left is Sherlock’s run, where he rounds the fourth and fifth gates successfully to a cheer of relief from the crowd, his lead over the Gold medal time now up to a few tenths of a second.
But John can’t let himself go down that particular rabbit hole right now. Not here. Not ever, if he’s honest with himself. He stares down at the way his right foot is twisting oddly to one side, tries to fix it without anyone noticing, and—
Holmes, to Watson: “Good Christ, now you’ve come to babysit us? Here I was thinking you trusted Gerold and Patrick, but no, you need to come along to make sure we don’t leave anyone for dead in the mountains.”
She pauses so long I think the call dropped. When she finally speaks it sounds like she’s readin’ from a script. Her voice is flat and hollow like cardboard.
John Watson is breathtaking when he wakes up in the late morning. I’d never tell him that, not in a million years, but he’s like the first warm breeze of spring rushing through the frozen canyons, brushing away the top layer of frost from the pines like a puff of breath.
I know what she’s seeing. My little girl’s standing in a dark farmhouse hallway seein’ one big bed, and two nightstands – one covered in books, one with a little framed, faded out picture of Sherlock taken from the stands at a rodeo ridin’ a roping horse full speed through the dirt. Two different size pairs of boots sittin’ outside the little closet, and a coat that ain’t mine layin’ across the quilt.
The thought of it still gives me shivers deep along my spine. I see Sherlock’s eyes in the wooden front door, and his curls in the tall grass, and his hands, his long fingers, in the spokes of freshly whitewashed fence.
When he turns back to the table, his smile is genuine. He joins the conversation as Sam relays the results of their controlled avalanche survey that morning.
And as Sherlock rolls his eyes at him in protein-bar-flavor scorn, and casually turns back to whatever skiing-related video he’s watching on his screen, for the first time since the tester put his fingertips on the bare skin of John’s thigh that morning, John’s lungs finally take in a full breath of air.
The city is entirely different in the daytime. Gone are the fog-choked alleyways and glittering crowds. The metal doors vibrating from blood pumping music, and the lines of shimmering cars waiting for sprinting girls in high heels.
She sighs and reaches behind me to adjust the pillows along my back, pausing to smooth down the collar of my suit jacket. I’m sitting in the chair beside Sherlock’s bed. They’ve said that I can still hold his hand.
“I’m here,” John says again. Sherlock releases all the air in his lungs, stepping back further from the men kneeling in the sand and taking a stumbling step towards John. He lets his arms fall to his sides and leans his weight against John’s shoulder.
Sherlock hums. John thinks he’s going to go on with the story of the tattoo. Instead, Sherlock says, simply, “You’re gay too.”
Sherlock can see John eyeing Greg’s pink, swollen knee with concern, but then John just covers Greg’s leg with the blanket once Sherlock goes to throw out the ice, and Greg takes John’s hands in his own, blowing on them to get them warm.
And honestly, I still don’t think I’d ever really truly want any of that. It’s not in my nature to want all the traditional trappings of a pregnancy. It’s claustrophobic to me, the same way a suburb and a 9-5 and a cubicle and a minivan feel. But there’s a shared happiness that I’d been subconsciously envying, like the poor kid in a Dickens novel staring through the glass of the sweets factory, his little clammy palms pressed tightly to the glass as if he could someday reach through and touch the confections with his own fingertips. Not even eat them, just touch and feel and own.
John pokes his head out of their tiny London bathroom, his towel around his waist, toothbrush hanging out of his mouth. He gets no response, so he tries again over the upstairs racket of Sherlock trying on every single outfit he owns in the extra closet reserved just for him. “Sherlock!”
Greg runs a hand over his face and groans, and he hears John take in a carefully controlled breath next to him.
Somehow, even with the patient sprawled out in the snow, and the onlookers’ nervous faces, all of the danger from the disastrous mission in the crevasse has evaporated. It seems as if their missions could never go wrong. As if the mountain would never hurt them, and the weather will always stay clear, and the air will be smooth.
Greg swallows hard. He hates himself for not standing up and hugging John that morning, crowded athletes’ dining hall or no. Hates himself for not texting John every second of the day that he is loved, no matter how he does today, that they are proud—
I notice now that the dress fabric perfectly matches my tie. Something tells me that dress hadn’t ever been on sale.
“That’s real rich comin’ from you lecturing me on not wantin’ things,” I say. My voice is shaking as I stalk towards him. “You been happy as a clam all week now that you got yourself a real job, and it only took you twenty goddamn years to finally follow my advice and use your brains for more than just a dumb trick to scare off strangers.”
Sherlock turns onto his side and pulls John gently into his arms, feeling a warm ache in his chest when John throws himself limply into the embrace, letting Sherlock pull him close and hold him. They come down slowly together, panting breaths slowly evening out, sweating skin starting to cool in the breeze, heartbeats fading back to normal. Sherlock buries his nose in John’s hair and inhales over and over, memorizing the combined scent of them. John’s penis is warm and soft pressed into his thigh, the space between his thighs still dripping.
The Russian grins. “I thought you were . . .” He claps his hands together. “Poof! Gone! You are getting old that you cannot see, eh?”
Tension continues to melt from the table. John rolls his neck to stretch his shoulder, Sherlock creates Rice Mountain again before turning it into a volcano with a piece of steamed broccoli, and Greg finally pulls the bag out of his disgustingly black tea. Then Greg nods at John. “How was your first time on the snow this afternoon?”
It’s a command. Sherlock’s jaw slams shut, and only then does John rush forward on two unsteady steps, release the air in his lungs, and crush Sherlock into his arms. He presses his cheek into Sherlock’s curls and closes his eyes, and Sherlock slowly unfolds his body and wraps his hands around John’s back, pulling them flush.
John feels Sherlock swallow hard beneath him, and Sherlock holds him tightly enough that John can barely draw in a full breath. “Thank you for texting me,” Sherlock whispers back.
John groans under his breath as a woman decked head-to-toe in Team USA gear jogs towards them, slipping once on the ice as the man beside her catches her elbow, rolling his eyes. The couple approach them, their attention fixed on John. The woman grabs his hand.
He sees Sherlock on the gigantic screen, shying away from the cameras with a slight frown, glancing at the spot where Greg had been standing with a look of quiet concern.
“We’re just about ready to start here, folks. Holmes, any last thoughts on your underdog choice today?”
John feels his throat close up, and he looks away embarrassed as he blinks the moisture out of his eyes. Greg’s never said anything like this before, never acknowledged out loud the secret past that John keeps hidden from him, from everyone. He’s seen the scar, of course. And the limp he gets when his body hasn’t fully woken up yet. Seen them both hundreds of times in pre-dawn light as they perch side by side on their boards and wait for the next quiet set.
I’m just stalling now, for what, I don’t know. I clear my throat and pick up my bag to swing it onto the passenger seat of the Ford. I look just over his left shoulder, missing his eyes.
Sherlock’s lost in his head. He realizes too late that he’s gone entirely stiff. John notices the tension in his body and sucks in a breath.
Sherlock wonders why his cheek feels wet, then realizes it’s from the tears spilling over in his eyes. He runs his forearm quickly across his face, grateful everyone’s too focused on John to be looking at him. He watches from a distance as every surfer on the beach sprints towards John where he stands, half-kneeling, in the shallows, board still floating and bumping into his ankles with the tide.
Sherlock whips back around, eyes fierce. “Don’t what? Don’t look out the window of my own house? Don’t help you by getting what you want? Don’t breathe?”
. And at the bottom, in the trees . . . I tried to tell him how I felt. That I wanted him. That I liked—”
Sherlock fiddles with his motel room key as he waits at the edges of the dirt parking lot, staring down at his flip flops.
Greg lifts his hand to kiss it. They lie together in the comfortable silence. Greg’s touch trails down Sherlock’s stomach to his thighs, between his legs, as if he’s admiring every part of him. Delighting in it.
. Going over the schedules and the rules again, as if I have not already read the one thousand emails.”
And John’s erection is pressed into his hip, his wet lips in his ear. Hot, obscene words sending fire through his body. “That’s right . . . fucking lie there . . . take it . . . watch him . . . You think you’re the only gold medalist here? We’ll fucking show you—”
“And so at this point,” Rick interrupts, either oblivious to John’s change in mood or quite good at pretending not to see it. “Will you settle for the Bronze? Would that still be a cause for celebration?”
Sherlock tries not to let his chest puff up too obviously with pride. Who feels proud of themselves after simply suggesting somebody else eat lunch? He passes a hand over his mouth, hating that what he’s about to say will wipe the easy smile from John’s face.
He meets my gaze, and my mouth runs dry. His eyes are glittering stars in the dark. “The Work is all I have,” he says again.
Greg had known even back in London, standing at the top of the stairs. He had known when John stepped into the medical room and immediately took Sherlock into his arms, and not Greg. Had known when the two of them showed up in his room in the middle of the night, breathless from sprinting across the Village from security and kissing in the snow.
“You’d hold your own cock in your hand, wouldn’t you? Look down at how thick it is. Think about how you’re gonna shove it inside of me, wouldn’t you? How it’ll stretch me open--”
John leans forward, heart oddly pounding, until his palm slips off the plastic grip of his crutch, and he has to slam his other hand into the metal wall of lockers to keep himself from falling. The clang echoes through the room. The stranger doesn’t even gasp in surprise. John grips the corner, braces himself for whatever poor soul is about to see him half-naked, hopping on one foot and clearly in the middle of an emotional crisis. He steps out into the next row with his head held high, failing at appearing casual.
John immediately lurches forward to take it from him, nearly toppling over on Greg while trying to juggle the crutch on his arm. “Jesus, don’t just wave around thousands of pounds in the air like that! My heart can’t take it today.”
Out of all the snippets of yesterday playing on an endless loop in his mind – Johnny’s surprised, soft eyes when Sherlock started telling him about the ocean, Johnny’s quietly indrawn breath when their shins brushed against each other underneath the water, his gritted-teeth determination as he tirelessly surfed wave after wave, his fierce look of burning resentment that he lobbed at Sherlock as he finally walked away – one thought rises above the rest.
Lahela’s eyes widen, and she reaches out her hand to shake his. “You’re as good as my Scotty then,” she says, eyes sparkling.
People get to share when they’re going to have a kid normally. They get to happily exclaim it to the barista at the coffee shop, and the guy fixing your car, and the little old lady next to you on the bench. They get to show friends the ultrasound photos, and shop for nursery furniture together in the store, and have a shower where everyone buys them little baby clothes and an expensive pram.
John runs his hand through Sherlock’s curls, and Sherlock lets himself arch into the touch, eyes gently closed. John’s thumb runs along the thin skin under his eye.
Watson is just about to climb into the co-pilot seat when we see Holmes step onto the helipad, watching Watson leave from where he’d been discussing his week’s schedule with Gerold. The other members of the team not called to this mission are all still milling around in the hangar, casually watching their colleagues take off in the helicopter for the first call of the day.
,” he responds, voice hard. It’s a pointed dig at Johnny’s earlier recollections of his pre-heat talk with his friends, and they both know it.
are not enough? You—the sole reason that we’re all here? Babe, you think you’re the only one of us who has ridiculous fears that keep you up at night?” John gestures at Sherlock, too. “I wonder every single day of my life if the two of you regret letting me in, and wish I would just leave. If you wish you could speak in French all the time, and feel like your life is dumbed down for my benefit. If you’ve lost interest now that I . . . I don’t need as much of your help anymore—to fix me up and give me a life again. If you even still want me if I’m not some project.”
Then Sherlock looks to John. He sees no one else—everything but the three of them a forgettable blur. “John?”
“That la-la paradise land is my actual life – and in case you forgot, it really isn’t such a paradise at all, even with the fucking palm trees.”
“He’s already up to his neck in sponsorships and gear deals in the past thirty-six hours, what makes you think an interview with Queen Sonya Westley or whoever else you’ll have babbling behind the microphone, with me sitting there like a mannequin, would be more than what he’s already—?”
“You’re here for Holmes?” says the man in his ear over the noise of the crowd. The first skier’s run has just completed, his time flashing up on the screen.
Cut to Greg flying a helicopter, soaring it in a drastic, steep turn over the tops of the peaks. We watch him as he surveys the thick clouds of incoming turbulence and fog.
The calm voice breaks him from his trance and he opens his eyes to see Scotty looking up at him, worry in his eyes. John can barely look down over the ledge. He can’t form a reply. Hot embarrassment creeps up the backs of his legs, rooting him firmly in place.
He tosses what Sherlock belatedly realizes was his own shirt back onto the floor, then crawls back over John and Sherlock to his side, taking special care not to step on John, and taking extra special care to knee Sherlock in the hip.
If anyone is looking for a new song to add to your Johnlock playlist . . . this one is it. It oozes 'Sherlock after John starts dating Mary' energy. Or 'Holmes after Watson moves out' energy. Or 'Watson after Holmes' death' energy. Or 'Watson watching Holmes continue to use drugs' energy.
Sherlock internally curses Greg to hell and back for going to sleep at such an ungodly hour as 10 pm, or else he would have tried calling him already to just bloody come down and vouch for them at the desk for this insufferable, rule-following, paper-pusher. But alas.
Barrel = When a big wave rolls over, enclosing a temporary horizontal tunnel of air with the surfer inside.
But he stops talking as Greg effortlessly slides the sock over his skin, rolling it with seemingly practiced hands, and then he completes every step of John’s routine in perfect order, no hesitations, without even pausing to think.
John dips his head. “Whatever magic overtook me will be gone by tomorrow, don’t worry.” Then he looks up at a loud whistle—sees the rest of the skiers all piled into the shuttle, waiting.
Sherlock’s breathing like he’s just sprinted. Greg angles his body so Sherlock can fall into his arms, like he expects him to. Sherlock will turn to him for comfort now, humiliated and afraid, and Greg will hold back his own emotions and comfort him, like he’s done so many times before. Anything to keep Sherlock safe. Anything to help him feel strong, even when Greg has just watched his other love ski away, off the edge of the earth.
“Please don’t be angry with him,” John says, hating that he sounds like he’s begging. “I should have stopped him, but I didn’t. He wasn’t trying to hurt you. He would never do that.”
It was a zoo. A rolling stretch of beach covered in G.I.’s, with a hand built driftwood lifeguard tower covered in graffiti paint jobs and a line of shirtless soldiers all along the shore watching two men surf out in the waves.
As Holmes speaks, we watch a quick montage of Watson making contact with the patient, quickly assessing her fingers before getting her outfitted in the harness and ropes. Greg flies the helicopter back over the hut site and deploys the winch. Holmes is still standing out on the landing skid to guide the rope as Watson hooks up both himself and the patient, then the camera pans back, in awe, as the two people are gracefully lifted into the air, soaring up through the clouds towards the steady beat of the helicopter blades.
John swallows over a dry throat as he calmly tracks Sherlock down the rest of the mountain, wrapping his arms around his stomach so he doesn’t hold them behind his back in some parody of parade rest. He prickles at the back of his neck at the familiar-but-hated sensation of every pair of eyes around him being trained on Sherlock too, as if John is owed some sort of dibs over him before everyone else, like some possessive creep.
,” Greg whispers, to nobody in particular. Then he tips over the edge, smiling at the blast of wind in his face. And he skis between two sets of fresh tracks, carved just for him.
John heaves himself along, stroke by stroke, his arms flying up with his poles, slamming down into the earth and pulling him forward with a gasping grunt for each stride. His gun slaps against his spine in a steady rhythm to his breathing.
When Sherlock eventually does look up, Greg watches his eyes quickly scan John’s body. Something softens in his gaze, then. His mouth sags with guilt. Sherlock licks his lips and opens his mouth to speak, but John holds up a hand, his spine terrifyingly straight.
,” Greg finally answers. It doesn’t sound accusing. It doesn’t even sound sad. “There are always things to be missing about the past.”
I don’t see him the rest of the morning. I spend the time doing chores round the house and clearing away everything outta sight that makes it seem there’s more than just me livin’ there.
The crowd is nearly silent after the initial cheer following the first two surfers’ paddle out towards the breaking point. Everyone is holding their breath, eyes never straying from the two little back dots bobbing and weaving through the swells. The surfers paddle out to the side, just off where the waves are fully breaking, and pull up next to each other on their boards, talking through which sets to go for, what routes to take.
“Let me get this straight,” Sherlock says, fingers pressed to his mouth. He closes his eyes. “You, John Watson, are
“Molls, you’re an angel!” he calls over his shoulder as he sprints through the crowds to his board, a chorus of “good luck, you’ll need it’s” hitting his back. The sand falls off the legs of his wetsuit in clumps, and he fruitlessly runs a hand through his fringe to try and get out the crunchy tangles. He really needs to wax his board a second time. To stretch and condition a little bit, go for a jog or drink a huge bottle of water or find some damn sunscreen or just sit down and breathe. But instead he’s just sat and listened to everyone tell him all the ways Scotty fucking Holmes is going to demolish him without doing anything to even try to set himself up for a chance at success.
The exclamation sounds a lot like a question. Greg doesn’t miss the way her eyes are glancing between them skeptically, probably wondering how on earth the polite, good-natured ex-skier sitting calmly on the couch—the one hoping he doesn’t look massive next to Sherlock’s lean frame—even puts up with Sherlock’s sharp-tongued mouth and restless energy.
Cut immediately to the inside of one of the lesser-used offices. The shot feels oddly unproduced. The lighting has not been altered, and the background noise and odd echoes of the room haven’t been properly mixed for sound.
Sherlock groans and runs his hands over his face, gripping tight enough to sting at his hair. He feels like a mess. He can’t even decide what to do with his goddamn day without thinking of John fucking Watson, and he’s been deciding what to do with his days just fine for over seven fucking years. He sucks in a frustrated breath and gets quickly to his feet, still gripping the screwdriver tight in his fist and hoping that his feet will somehow carry him on to the next activity for the day. The next thing to fill the time. The meaningless series of steps and movements and thoughts that will carry him successfully through hour one hundred and forty-five so he doesn’t go and do something pathetic like stand lonely on a windswept and rocky shore with his curls blowing into his face again.
Sherlock groans into his mouth, licking and sucking at his lips. John’s muscles are warm and solid beneath his body, rolling up into Sherlock’s touch, legs entwined at the thigh. Sherlock wants to press himself so solidly into John Watson that they become inseparable.
“Even though I unfairly snapped at you for waving?” Sherlock asks, a slight wobble coming through in his voice.
A burst of animated heart-eye emojis suddenly flood the screen behind them, followed by another slow-motion replay of their damned kiss. He feels John relax though, just slightly, beside him, and Sonya looks like she’s about to weep from journalistic happiness.
We cut to a wide shot, tracking the helicopter as it soars down the face of the mountain towards the hospital in Visp, framed by the storming sun peeking through the grey clouds. Along the distant slopes, ski lifts and skiers travel across the mountain like tiny ants.
We watch Watson pull back and gaze up, and Holmes gently cups his cheek. He runs his thumb across the stubble. The camera half-hides behind the doorway wall.
He’s shivering, so I drape it around his thin shoulders. We stand in the silence just watching the waves, and I suddenly feel that I’ve gone back in time. That it’s my nurse beside me, and that these waves are in the World, and that I’ve just come away from watching Sherlock Holmes die. It makes me feel utterly alone by his side.
And impossibly—because he has won Olympic medals, experienced far greater emotions than this—Greg’s eyes cover over with water.
Her brown eyes sparkle as I grip the cane, and I nod at her that she can move away before I try to stand. I don’t need her staring at me struggle. Not now. Not with the dull ache of a bullet graze panging hot on my forehead. Not with the warm ghost of his lips against my own. Almost touching. Almost.
The kiss is perfect. Warm. Overflowing with honeyed joy and soft velvet comfort and home. John feels the last remaining tendrils of fear from his nightmare wisp away gently from his body. Feels the line of his shoulders soften, and a bit of the churning anxiety deep in his gut slow to a calm. Sherlock pulls back after one final press of his lips to John’s mouth and heaves a great sigh, thumping back onto the pillow with his curls fanned out around his head and staring up at John with a bleary-eyed smile.
Just a reminder to please heed the tags! This chapter *does* contain major character death. This fic has a happy ending, I promise, but you have been warned! Also, this fic now has 4 chapters, so we still have one more to go after this. Enjoy, and practice self care <3
“I told my Ron,” the woman says, “I told him, ‘Ronnie, we gotta be there a whole hour early to get a good spot. An hour!’ And my Ronnie got here right at ten and you know what? Stands already half full. We’re lucky we even got these seats.”
It’s the silent communication we’ve somehow gone and mastered over twenty years, even with a hell of a lot of that time spent aching miles apart. The eyes and the mouths. Lookin’ at each other through the thick, dusty light of our farmhouse, across the front seat of my old truck, over a campfire high up in the clouds. Through the mists on Baker.
John laughs. “Nice try playing the sympathy card, but you can’t deny you have a talent for it. You’re doing it again right now.”
No, the error I made was this: I honestly, truly, with the entire depth of my conscious mind, forgot that Sherlock has a womb and a vagina.
“Well,” Sonya says after a brief pause, hoping for elaboration, “it looks like we’re out of time here in the studio. Sincere thanks to you both for taking time away from the slopes to chat with us.”
John’s panting. His jaw is so tight it looks ready to pop. Rick and Sonya have their mouths hanging half-open, frantically looking to their off-camera producers for help.
The rest of the group nods, suddenly solemn. They all turn to look back out at the waves, snarling against the shore and slamming into the barrier of reef and rocks, hurling up streaming spray into the sky.
shirtless. And yet here in this poorly lit, muddy, chlorine scented beach shower, in front of a man who’s already even seen his tattoo up close and gasped at it in wonder, Sherlock feel nerves roiling through his gut. His fingers tremble as he goes for the far right shower head, and his stomach sinks down into his toes when he realizes it’s broken.
John learned it all later, when he was laid up in a hospital bed near base camp under crisp white sheets. How Keith Hartman had come running out of the jungle, vomiting with exhaustion from carrying Jack’s corpse on his back, and seen John’s body floating face up in the shallows, sinking into deep red water, rising and falling in the blood-soaked foam.
“Well which fight are you in the mood for?” Sherlock asks, because Sherlock wants to fight. He wants Greg to get riled up and exasperated and gorgeous and incensed. He wants to hear his Coach commanding him what to do and where to be, so something in his life will finally feel normal and not permanently obliterated.
he’s so well-rested, after everything that happened yesterday. Shouldn’t he have had a sleepless night? Didn’t he miss John at all? Isn’t he anxious over Sherlock’s race?
The taxi driver doesn’t ask any questions. He drops John off near Mokuleia forty-five minutes later, along the Northshore of the island. It’s a small little town. Dirt roads and somewhat ramshackle houses strewn about like they were tossed down in a handful from the sky.
John howls, leaning over his board to try and catch his breath from laughing. “Oh my god,” he pants. “You’re insane.”
Greg blinks. Three entire seconds have passed on the shining red clock since he trailed off from his last sentence. Sherlock’s knee bumps against his own as he fake-fidgets on the couch.
Sherlock very much wants John to say it again, but he also wants to feel the heavy weight of John’s cock on his tongue more than anything on earth, so he takes in a breath, licks his dry lips, and leans in.
-I don't think there's any surfing terms or slang in this chapter, but if you'd like anything defined please let me know!
“Sorry about Kip, man, he was just scared,” he says. Sherlock huffs and experimentally flexes his jaw, then winces at the shooting pain.
Sherlock slides on behind him, gripping John’s shoulders as they both fight to steady themselves and keep balance. The board sinks down into the cool, clear water, bringing it up past their waists. Suddenly Sherlock’s hands are wrapped around John, sliding slowly up his stomach and chest. John can feel Sherlock’s chest pressed smoothly against his back. Can feel his hard penis pressed into the low of his spine, warm and thick between his hips just under the water’s surface.
And John’s thick cock is heavy and dripping in Greg’s hand, and the mattress is shaking with the force of Sherlock’s deep, rolling thrusts against John’s thigh, and in that exact moment, John curses under his breath, throws back his sweat-shining head onto the pillow, and comes in Greg’s eager hand in a groaning, hot stream. And Greg idly thinks that it might be the most beautiful cum he’s ever seen as he bends his head to lick it up from John’s belly and thighs, and as Sherlock crawls right under him where he kneels on his knees and sucks Greg’s bobbing cock straight into his mouth, strong fingers gripping the back of Greg’s thighs as he swallows.
He looks out over the fields, over our land, and I imagine I can see flames from a campfire reflectin’ in his eyes, soothed by a mountain spring.
The camera view switches to an angle outside the helicopter, attached near the whirring blades. Wind blows fog and snow dramatically against the lens, and the visibility is almost too little to clearly see the outline of the peaks.
“We’re giving you something for the pain,” I hear her say. “It’s kicking in. Dr. Watson, do you think you can look up at me?”
On Day One of his new life John woke up in the back of the station wagon, which Uncle Ron had left him after he and Auntie Cath assured he was still alive and breathing and then packed up and moved to Sacramento. Better house prices up there, they said. Less traffic. John brushed his teeth over the gutter, buttoned up a shirt and walked into the work office for the Long Beach dockyard.
Cut to Sam sitting in the pilot seat back at the hangar for his interview. His eyes are bright as he gazes out through the windshield, imagining the endless snow-capped peaks.
John reluctantly holds up his hands to applaud along with everyone else, suddenly more conscious than he’s ever been in his life over how enthusiastically he’s cheering—whether it’s in line with everyone else’s, or too much. Whether it’s too little.
They both jump apart and turn towards the sound of the voice, and Sherlock feels his stomach turn into lead. It’s the policeman.
But all John sees now as he looks down at the bullet casing is the brilliant smile that had swept across Sherlock’s face right at the moment John had emerged victorious from the Wild Card heat. Sees the color of Sherlock’s half-lidded eyes as he’d let his head fall back gently into the sand.
Sherlock doesn’t register the punch in time to duck. The man’s fist slams into his cheek, throwing him down into the rocky sand. He cradles his face in his hand and yells out, blinding white pain shooting through his skull. He comes to in time to look up from the wet sand and sees Greg brushing the hair back from John’s face softly, whispering to him and holding his hand. He sees John’s eyes open and blinking. Sees his chest rising and falling. He stumbles to his feet as one of the guys sprints past him to the road, presumably to find a call box for an ambulance. He stands back gasping and helpless, still clutching his throbbing face as the rest of the men kneel around John in the tide pool. He hears John’s voice rise above the murmurs, and wants to weep at the sound.
, love,” Greg says with a relaxed sigh. “But three years and eight months ago is when you started texting me at all the hours of the night. Was I drinking enough of the liquids? Was I doing my recovery stretches? Was I taking the post-op medications? Was I eating? When would I be back? Why couldn’t you come over in the middle of the night? When would my knee hurry up and be better so you could ski? Couldn’t I just coach you standing on one leg? Couldn’t I coach you over the phone? That was the last time I got a full night of sleep. Right before that month.”
Then John turns to Greg. “Now you can tell him about how he needs to fucking walk in the fucking Opening Ceremony all the fuck you want.”
John feels the air turning tense, feels Scotty closing off from him bit by bit the longer he holds the photograph. With one last glance he sets it down on the table, matching up the angle with how it was before. He’s overflowing with questions, exploding with curiosity in his mind. He knows there’s only one thing he can ask, though.
“Remember the plan,” he breathes. Then he’s gone, slinking away into the shadows like a vapor, disappearing in seconds into the thick blackness of the house.
And John sits there and nods dumbly as they go over the final points of his classification, approving his adapted prosthesis with some reluctance (
They all freeze as John turns and ignores the daggers in his back to walk to Sherlock and Greg, who are hesitantly walking forward to meet him.
The last gate, and Sherlock is 1.98 seconds ahead of Greg’s time, two-hundredths of a second away from securing the Gold. He squats for the finish.
Sherlock melts around John’s body. Places his cheek down in his hair and rubs his face against the soft strands, brushes his lips again and again across John’s scalp, clean and warmed by the sun. He breathes in the scent of his skin, feeling it spread through his veins like a salve. John smells like the seats in the plane, and floral Hawaiian mud, and sweat and salt and musky men’s shampoo.
“Christ,” John breathes, as the crowd swells, and the stadium announces Sherlock’s name. And in the same moment, Greg suddenly holds out his hand. “Your phone.”
Christ, I wish I hadn’t done that. It wasn’t a gasp of “oh, how beautiful.” He heard it for what it was – I was honestly startled. He still said good morning to me, and handed me my tea, but his eyes were flat, and I watched as he drew his dressing gown tighter around himself while he made his way down the hall to the bathroom, walking slowly and carefully so that his full hips wouldn’t sway and waddle under his weight.
“Exactly – you just won a pro competition, something you’ve been wanting to do for years, and you haven’t said a single word about it.”
“Er, well, we actually just gave an interview and talked about that. . . I’m sure you’ll see it . . .” John stammers.
John closes his eyes again and sees Sherlock from the night before. How he’d covered him with his body and thrusted his penis into him again and again while John lay panting and arched on his back, fingernails leaving red trails along the skin of Sherlock’s shoulders. How Sherlock had held John’s face in his hands and kissed his bearded cheeks, his eyelids, across his forehead, just the barest hints of panted kisses brushed against his mouth. He thinks of how Sherlock had pulled out all the way then knelt up to watch himself disappear into John’s body in one long, slow, glide, both of them moaning at the wet slap of skin against skin, deafening in the silence of the room.
Sherlock chuckles. “Oh right. Well that first night on my own I slept on the beach – didn’t have anywhere else to go. Just had the clothes I was wearing and my bag of stuff and my surfboard. Woke up in the morning and I was mad as hell. I’d never been so pissed off in my life. I went down to the water and the only thing I could think to do was yell ‘fuck you’ as loud as I could at my father. Well, at the waves. And then this jellyfish suddenly swam right up next to me where I was standing in the water. It just hovered there by my leg and I watched it. And for whatever goddamn reason, looking at that thing, I suddenly wasn’t mad anymore. Completely gone. So I saved up money fixing shit and found out about an artist over on the Big Island that would tattoo a kid my age. Flew down and got this the first chance I could. Never been mad about any of it again since. Stupid, but, that’s the story.”
They fly through the empty Village, whipping around dark, abandoned corners and courtyards flooded with eerie yellow light. Sherlock looks back once at the guards and catches one of them slip and fall right on their face. The others stop to help him up for a brief moment, and Sherlock immediately sees his chance, and takes it.
All those times, it is so shockingly easy for John to forget that he is dating a celebrity. That he’s dating
Greg, switching between English and French: “Sad about that? Seems to me Watson should be jumping for joy.” He glances at Watson: “The way you and Holmes go at it, you’d think your families have been at war for generations.”
Greg huffs, warmth thrumming through his body even as he tries to look annoyed. He settles into a squat. Sees Sherlock pull up his bandana and do the same. John plants his poles.
But Sherlock paddles out, Don on his heels. John tracks Sherlock’s soaked white t-shirt through the rises and falls of the battling swells, wheezing breath out through his mouth and trying not to sink to his knees in the sand. The crowd has moved closer to the shoreline. Two men – lifeguards, John hopes - stand ready with a thrown together first-aid kit. Nobody makes a sound.
“You surfed like hell, John Watson,” he’d said, and John had only had the strength to barely whisper “I promise” before he’d torn his gaze away from those pale eyes and practically ran into the terminal, leaving Sherlock alone and untouched on the sidewalk, looking like he’d just said goodbye.
“Jesus, stop licking your skin, Johnny, you crusty old shrimp,” his mom said to him, warm smile on her lips where she stood with one hip propped against the metal doorframe of their little red and white seaside mobile home. She had cotton balls stuck between her freshly painted coral toenails, hairnet over curlers and a languishing Lucky Strike perched between her fingers.
Sherlock stirs, shifting in his sleep behind John and burrowing his face deeper into the pillow, rousing John from his sleepy thoughts. John tears his gaze away from the fading photograph and turns onto his other side to face him, grinning silently as Sherlock huffs a lazy breath to blow the long curls off his forehead, nose twitching, then falls immediately back to a deep and heavy sleep. John throws an arm over Sherlock’s bare back, gently running his fingers up Sherlock’s spine and watching transfixed as his breath falters in his sleep at the touch of John’s palm.
Sherlock hums and throws back the seeds into his mouth, almost knocking the sunglasses off the top of his head.
Holmes: “Yes. Obviously. That comes with the territory in case you haven’t noticed. Didn’t you film them finding a body only yesterday?”
Sherlock nods, then goes on, glancing down nervously at the water and chewing his lip as he spits out the words as fast as he possibly can, as if he’s afraid John will try to cut him off if he doesn’t.
“And the government didn’t offer me any money, in case you were wondering,” he calls back to me in the sand.
Greg stares at him. Sherlock’s head is high, looking thoroughly unaffected by his own little speech, but Greg knows better. He knows that Sherlock now looks even smaller than he did the night Greg came in to find him asleep on the couch, lines of white powder sitting untouched on the table in front of him, his clothes drenched with sweat. Greg has never wanted to protect anything more in his life. Because it’s true that Greg would sell every one of his possessions in a heartbeat, but he would be miserable if he traveled the world without Sherlock Holmes. He would lose a piece of himself if he couldn’t touch his hair, or sigh exasperatedly at his antics, or plead with him to eat food.
And the look on John’s face now is the very same look which Sherlock had fiercely asserted he never wanted to see in John’s eyes ever again as Greg held him in the dark, right before Greg finally opened his mouth to try and say that he found himself in the terrifying predicament of loving two people at once, wondering how many seconds would pass before Sherlock leapt up from the bed and left him for good. If he would send someone else to collect all his stuff in the morning, or if he would cut his losses.
“Got us a ranch, John,” he says. “Little place way out in Dayton over the other side of Bighorn. Way back in the trees, ain’t nobody to bother us. I paid the whole thing in cash. Can get us some animals or crops or whatever you want and be left well enough alone.” He coughs and looks strange at the ground for a beat. “Now that everyone thinks I’m dead anyways – be just like you’re up there runnin’ the place on your own. No one’ll know.”
Sherlock doesn’t meet his eyes and shrugs. “Can’t force me to give away all my secrets, can you? Anyways we’re wasting time. You have the day off today, judging by the general lack of ‘dead man walking’ about you this morning, but you’re still hoping to spend the afternoon with him after he gets off his early shift and I’m hoping we can fit in the whole run before we bake in the sun and smog. So, ready?”
And Greg can almost fool himself into believing that everything is about to go back to normal—whatever normal even means for three Olympic skiers. Well,
Watson: “Your first question, though. Fuck if I can give a single answer to that. I mean, I’m in the most gorgeous place on earth, with the very best team. Flying over the fucking Alps every day, right? Taking the training I’ve done my whole life to help people. I don’t call it saving lives, but . . . yeah. To help people. To do something about it.”
He sees Sherlock from earlier in the day in his memory - standing apart from the crowd on the beach looking radiant and beautiful and
No threats of bodily harm if Sherlock had disobeyed. No gloating that he himself just won his own damnable Gold Medal. Not even a promise of sexual reward if Sherlock eats all his breakfasts.
The first day of the Billabong Masters is never quite as insane as the finals on Day 2. Sherlock restrains himself from immediately searching for John in the smaller crowd once his feet finally reach the sand and he kicks his sandals off, leaving them in the middle of the pathway. The WSL guys are running cables to set up for the announcers’ table, and the judges are starting to arrive. Sherlock wonders how far word’s spread that he isn’t going to be surfing. If it hasn’t, there’s going to be a stupid high-school gossip mill exploding in about two hours once everyone figures out he doesn’t have a board with him. It if has, that same high-school gossip mill is currently tearing itself to shreds wondering whether he injured himself, or had a mental breakdown, or is playing some big trick on everyone, or finally got arrested for one of the ridiculous activities he supposedly does when he’s not just being a stuck-up asshole. Oahu’s a small island, and surfing’s a small world. Sherlock’s learned not to kid himself by pretending he isn’t a topic of conversation, and a favorite one, at that.
As much as I love (read: hate) playing “my pregnant spouse is missing and not answering phone calls” for two hours, I could have done
Watson, sighing and looking back down at the town: “There’s so . . . there’s so much history here, isn’t there? Generations of families living here off the mountain, surviving on it, dying on it. The other guys at the base . . . I guess I’m sort of the outsider.”
Sherlock smiles back, thanks his mom’s God who separated the sky from the sea, thanks the ocean for carrying him safely to shore, and then leaps off his board into the shallows, feeling the cool water like a kiss against his aching skin.
We realize he is staring at the helicopter from earlier – the one carrying Greg, Simon, Dom, and Holmes to investigate the crevasse at Simplon Pass. They have just taken off moments ago.
He takes a too-large bite of banana to fill the silence. He wants to slap himself in the face. Two minutes in to his last ever morning with John and he’s already gone and said something stupid – reminded them both of the fact that he’s ten fucking years younger than the man smoothly navigating a stick shift down PCH, and now revealing that he apparently did something so absolutely horrible that his own family didn’t even want to see him through until he turned eighteen.
“I know that you’re considering taking this little swell that’s coming towards us as your first wave in a last ditch attempt to end this horrible conversation – which, incidentally, was your idea in the first place -  and I know that when I tell you that that wave’s gonna be closed out because of a rip current and isn’t even worth paddling out for, you’re going to look at me and go ahead and do it anyway just to spite me and admit to yourself that you don’t have to try and be civil to me anymore because I’ve now proven myself as a verified asshole. And also tough luck about your alarm clock battery.”
John shakes his head as they start to drive down the dark streets, navigating through the traffic around the rink where the Para Ice Hockey Finals are taking place. He closes his eyes and sits back, letting the wind rustle his hair, the cool air soothing his sore muscles.
Then he walks forward, as calmly as possible, closing the gap between them step-by-step, until he joins Greg by the barricade. The mass of bodies on either side of them, oblivious to their reunion, crush them together, and John can feel Greg’s heat all up his right side, the imaginary sensation of pins and needles like fire up his prosthetic. Greg’s face hasn’t changed. He doesn’t look nervous or relieved. He just waits, his bare hands probably turning to icicles where they rest on the metal gate.
But they both jump when a plate nearby smashes to the ground. Sherlock looks back to where John just walked away, the moment apparently already forgotten. “He’s
John rolls his eyes and the tension breaks, giving way to calm breathing as John starts walking down the path besides Molly with Greg and Sherlock starting out ahead of them, slowly pulling away as they all eventually make their way back down along the stretch of beach. Molly walks beside him in easy silence, one hand playing in the tips of her hair over her shoulder. When Greg and Sherlock are too far ahead to hear John sticks his hands in his pockets and breathes in the scent of the sea.
Sherlock’s heart thuds so hard he wonders how he can’t hear it. He waits for the inevitable wash of jealousy or betrayal, imagining Greg’s hands where only Sherlock’s have been, but it doesn’t come. “I didn’t know,” he manages.
When we finally approach the crevasse, Dom is waiting off to the side, and beckons for the camera to join him. He crosses his arms over his chest to wait, and we stay back and allow Simon and Holmes to cautiously approach the gaping edge.
I can feel the anger flare up inside me. I don’t even know what I’m angry at. I’m angry at the mountain beneath us for tapering off the lower down the trail we get, and I’m angry at the sky for lookin’ different up here than it does down in the little hopeless towns we both came from, and I’m angry as hell that my friend’s been lyin’ his face off to me all summer. That he’s had his tongue in my mouth and not thought I needed to even know his real name in return, “everybody calls me Scott,” be damned.
John hums and keeps staring out the window. When Sherlock waits and doesn’t answer, he slowly meets his gaze. His eyes are churning storms.
The Russian has already made one shot and missed another by the time Vanko has his gun set up on the stabilizing stand. The rest of the skiers follow him in fading waves, standing or lying firm in the snow as they line up their shots, and the gun range fills with the crisp, beeping sounds of electronic fire.
Sherlock’s jaw tightens. Greg admires the sharp line of it for half-a-second before quickly looking away, staring at the Ancient Korean Ikea Vase.
I don’t know how to tell him that he’s not in my hair at all. He don’t really sound like he means it anyways. I tell him one last time that he’ll freeze outside the tent before stepping inside and zipping it up, shoving my body down under the sleeping bag and shuddering my bones as hard as I can to try and make some heat. I’m asleep before I can finish trying to picture Scott ridin’ a bull for the perfect eight seconds.
here has ears? That one fucking twenty-something with one fucking mobile could catch you calling a fucking random male athlete ‘marvelous, glorious, beautiful’ and give you
-Terry Russell is in honor of Rory Russell from the UK, who won the actual 1976 Billabong Pipeline Masters (he also won it in 1977). As a reminder, 1971 was the inaugural year of this competition, since the late 60's and early 70's were when the first organized large-scale surf competitions were organized.
“For once?” John laughs. “After your midnight golf-cart stunt?” Then he bites his lip. “No, you’ll overwork yourself. It isn’t worth it. And sure there’ll be time after. We could always—”
John takes a deep breath and starts walking beside Sherlock, both of them trailing behind Chris as they walk along their stretch of beach just like they’ve done hundreds of times. Only this time John feels each grain of sand against his bare feet as he takes step after step, tickling against his toes and gently pushing him forward across the shore towards the place where he’ll take Sherlock’s hand in his and be expected to say words that will actually somehow mean something. Words that could somehow convey even half of what he feels as he listens to Sherlock’s steps gently swish beside him in the sand, echoing back and forth with his own.
Out of nowhere, a sudden rage boils up in John’s chest—a rage which has absolutely nothing to do with three snowboarding teenage boys, and everything to do with the pale hand still pushing him back, shielding him from view.
“Sherlock,” Sonya says, laughing, “That might be the biggest reaction we’ve ever seen from you ever, even after a competition win!”
Sherlock’s mouth crumples, and he smiles with wet eyes and nods. “I will, John,” he whispers. “I will.”
Sherlock chokes on his swallow of tea as Greg slaps a hand down on his back. “But of course,” Greg says, loud enough for all around to hear. “This is indeed Sherlock Holmes. He would be happy to take the photo with you as well.”
Interviewer: “It is a maneuver that requires a lot of trust, does it not? Among the members of the team?”
We sharply cut away from Watson kneeling on the asphalt and instead see him sitting with his elbows on his knees in the hangar. His hair is damp with sweat, and the top of his uniform jumpsuit is unzipped. It is clear he has recently finished performing the CPR, but whether or not the patient survived it completely unknown. We cannot see any clues in his expression.
Rick and Sonya laugh in chittering unison, and Greg fights his own smile when Sherlock shoots him a confused frown, utterly unaware that he just told a dry joke. Greg gives him an encouraging nod, and his chest briefly burns when the lines of Sherlock’s tense shoulders immediately relax.
Before we dive in, keep in mind that I’m not exactly losing sleep over trying to make this as realistic as possible. The rescue efforts and survival chances in this chapter are roughly based off scenarios in the show, but more crafted around plot and yummy emotional impact :)
“So which one’s your son? When’s he up?” She grins conspiratorially. “We gotta know so we can cheer extra for him!”
Sherlock feels embarrassment flare up across his cheeks. Everything is quiet. Silent save for the gentle lapping of the water against the undersides of their boards in tandem with both of their breaths.
Finally Sherlock watches as John reaches down and cups a handful of water in his palms, bringing the water close to his bent over chest, and Sherlock gasps as he realizes what John’s doing.
Holmes’ voice, dramatically: “Don’t touch anything, move anything, smudge my maps, or otherwise leave a trace of your presence.”
He’d pulled the film from the camera and waved it in the air to develop, smirking at Sherlock’s shocked expression as his hands flew up to grab in his hair.
“I was an idiot. I kept it in my notebook – this one I used for my notes I took reading other textbooks after school. Didn’t want my brother to find it because we shared a room. But then that notebook got taken from me – was only about two fucking weeks after I bought it. The wrong kid saw the photo and . . .Oahu’s a small island.”
He sits there and he looks at Greg. He sees his best friend. The man who’d walked up to him in the sand and asked him if he surfed. Who’d met up with him nearly every morning for two years without ever knowing where or who he’d been in all the years before. Who’d brushed the soaked hair back from his wet face in the shallows, and sat by his hospital bed telling him too many details about the latest episodes of MASH.
If I never have to hear Sherlock Holmes vomit ever again it will still be too soon. Christ, he’s gone through a lot. I can complain as much as I want about having to listen to it at all hours of the day and night but. . . this man I love is a gladiator.
Greg licks his own lips, as if he could taste their color. Sherlock’s curls are freshly washed from a warm shower, and he looks loose and relaxed, his cheeks flushed, the tiny freckles on the tip of his nose catching the sun’s weak light. He looks like he’s just crawled out of bed on a day off from training, in a way that makes Greg’s heart thud, one deep pulse of
When John doesn’t answer, not quite able to meet Walter’s gaze, Walter gives him a smug grin, understanding flashing across his face.
Christ, he’s alive. He can walk. He can race towards the booming stadium, the pop music and the announcements and the cheers, the row of Olympic and Korean flags piercing the sky, the center of excitement and life itself.
They always make him think about a ripped off leg spurting blood into the black sand. The famous photo accompanying that news article of the sunrise over the dunes from the rescue helicopter cockpit, looking down at the still-smoking wreckage of an RAF helicopter with a little black speck beside it in the sand—the speck named Group Captain John H. Watson, barely alive and holding on to what they all at first thought was just another piece of wreckage. A fuel pipe or an engine blade. Certainly not a
John’s roused from his doze by a cheer rippling across the warm beach. He flings open his eyes and desperately, before his brain can even realize why, searches out Sherlock in the crowd. His heart hammers in his chest, adrenaline pumping through his veins. He frantically scans the beach, the shoreline. Checks the two little specks of surfers already paddling out into the menacing waves to see whether either of them has a head of dark curls.
He looks up at us and blinks, then rises to his feet. He adjusts the fingers of one of his gloves with his teeth.
. Maybe John’s been massaging Greg’s knee. Maybe they’ve been eating breakfasts and lunches and dinners together in Greg’s sheets in between rounds of riotous sex, their knees bumping together, quietly laughing—
Sherlock bites his lip and looks down quickly at the sand, and suddenly a spark of something lights up in the back of John’s mind, burning hesitant and bright. “Hold on, wait a second. Why the fuck do you look so suspicious right now?”
“I was the one nervous,” Greg is murmuring into John’s skin, into his cheek and his jaw and his neck and his wet nipple. “You were
Greg threads his fingers through locks of tangled curls, even as warm water builds in the corners of his eyes. He can feel John’s gentle palm rubbing his ribs and side.
I expect her to be shocked or disbelieving. Instead she chuckles. “So the rumor is true, then,” she says.
this amount of emotional strain, let alone do extraneous things like speak, or grab onto the edge of Sherlock’s sleeve, or read words on a screen. His skin shivers as a wave of thick, icy cold spreads over his body, swiftly replacing the stifling heat he’s been feeling all afternoon, and his ribs struggle to expand.
Hintley snarls at me, and suddenly I realize what the stranger is trying to do. Draw Hintley towards me so he can sneak around behind him and do whatever the hell he means to do with the gleaming black stick in his hands.
He jumps in surprise when his phone vibrates with a received text after it turns on. He shuts his eyes before looking down at it, expecting a text from Sherlock from the ski lift that Greg is an ignorant moron for holding him back from his ideal plans for the course, and that Sherlock knows what he’s doing, and that it’s a miracle Greg ever even set an Olympic Record without taking Sherlock-Holmes-approved angles on every gate.
“Well, how’d I do?” John says, stepping into the room. He opens his arms and looks down at himself, double-checking his fly isn’t open, feeling a wash of embarrassment at wearing such fine, tailored clothes. When he looks back up, Sherlock’s head is tilted, deep in thought, his lips in a pout. And Greg looks like he wants to tear John’s clothes right off his body, making John flush.
He wants to take Sherlock’s hand and lead him to literally any other beach along the North Shore, or in Hawaii, or in the entire world. Say,
John sniffs, suddenly unable to tell whether the snot in his nose is from the sharp cold or something different, something else entirely.
He turns towards the ocean, letting the salt spray fan out across his skin, covering him in goosebumps and settling deep in his groin with a thud. He takes two steps out into the foam, wanting to run forward and laugh up towards the sky that he is at home, with John Watson, and that he will wake up tomorrow morning, with John Watson.
But I can’t. I just can’t. He’s the strongest person I know, and the most capable. He had to be his own strength all alone for so many years, and I can’t just swoop in and declare him suddenly incapable of carrying himself through the world just because of our daughters. (Christ,
John stares at him, and he takes in a deep breath of salty flowers and sleep soft skin, and a warm smile curls at the corners of his mouth. Fresh, tingling relief courses through his body. He doesn’t have to crawl out of the water and throw on a hard hat and go to work today. He doesn’t have to spend the entire day waiting to go home to an empty apartment.
John closes his eye to aim, shutting out the chaos surrounding him. The camera zooms even closer, revealing every one of his eyelashes, snowflakes clinging to the tips.
John sighs as he pushes back up Hermosa Avenue on his skateboard, tightening his grip on his surfboard under his arm. He already knows, without a shadow of a doubt, what he’s going to do tomorrow morning.
They surf for almost three hours. By the last wave John is aching and sore, arms trembling with exhaustion as he paddles after the largest wave of the set.
Interviewer: “We approached him earlier today, before he left with Robbie for the detonations. We . . . well, before we could say anything, he said that he figured we had caught some ‘particularly incriminating pieces of film,’ and that he refused to say anything until we had spoken to you.” She pauses, then: “And also, he said to say ‘I told you so’.”
We zoom around just in time to watch Gerold’s helicopter descend as close as it can go to the uneven ground, even battling through mist and the storming fog.
I near trip over Sherlock as he reaches forward and wordlessly places a pack of Marlboro’s on the kitchen table. I’m scared Alma might faint onto the linoleum as she stares down at the cigarettes. We’re down the stairs and in his truck in less than half a minute, speedin’ down the main street of town at twice the speed limit going who knows where.
And John laughs again, free and open into the clean air. The sound of it fills Sherlock with a tingling warmth. It settles deep in his gut, right in the center of his chest, up the muscles surrounding his spine. He finds himself chuckling along too, cheeks fighting against his grin as he gazes out at the distant blue horizon. He feels like an imposter of himself sitting inches from John Watson’s warm thigh as they zoom down the empty highway – like Scotty Holmes has a secret twin brother who laughs and surfs with other people and has someone coming to pick him up to intentionally spend time with him like that’s nothing special at all. Like it isn’t revolutionary.
“Yes. We . . . we love each other.” The words tumble out of his mouth. “I love them both. It’s been two years. I live with them. And Greg—he was the first man I was ever with. We were teens, right before I enlisted. I thought I’d never see him again. And now we’re all together. Like that.”
In a flash the gun is raised and pointed straight at my chest. Hintley sneers one last time and dramatically pulls the trigger. My heart stops.
But Sherlock would absolutely hate that. Isn’t that why Greg’s down here and not up at the starting gate, too? It’s a normal race.
It’s the most erotic thing John’s ever seen, Sherlock’s marked skin slowly undulating underneath his palms, rocking to the rhythm of his touch, seeking more pressure between his fingers and the sand. John doesn’t even think as he lifts a leg to straddle over Sherlock’s hips, sinking down onto the solid warmth of his body beneath him. Sherlock shivers as John lightens the touch of his fingers and picks up the trail of one of the tentacles etched into his back, following it slowly down across his trembling skin.
Renewed in this gut feeling, that not all hope is lost, John stands just close enough to Greg that their arms touch. It feels just like any other Super-G race, where everything is safe, and comfortable, and almost boringly normal. He feels at ease. There is a nostalgic comfort in the way he’s standing close to Greg, but not too close, aware of the eyes on them, their secret like a burst of warmth in the freezing cold. Their minds and hearts in tune. And soon, as selfish as John feels for thinking this, this will all be over, and their real lives will resume. Sherlock will race as well as he can, maybe even get a burst of adrenaline from this new challenge to beat the clock. And then it will be over. And they’ll be together.
The next morning he’d risen before the sun like normal and brushed his teeth from bottled water over the gutter on the side of the Pacific Coast Highway. The seagulls cawed down to him. Mocked his uncertainty. He made his way on shaky legs down to the shore with his board tucked under his arm and a bulky sweatshirt thrown over his thin frame. And he’d watched as Greg jogged down to him from where he parked his beat up Chevy with a smile on his face in the cool grey sand, and taken his hand and thumped him on the back like usual. And then John had forced himself not to vomit as he pulled the sweatshirt up over his head and left himself bare chested in the slowly warming virgin air, waiting to hear the gasp he knew would come from Greg’s lips.
Sherlock swallows down the nausea in his gut as he turns to see a group of four more guys make their way to them across the sand, roughhousing with each other and cracking more jokes as they jog, startling a group of nearby seagulls into flight.
Watson, strained: “Do you think I’m insane? I mean, we’re all a bit insane, to do this job, but. . .”
Just up ahead the road cuts closer to the water, revealing a strip of bars and surf shops. The sound of laughing and self-important talking gradually gets louder as Sherlock approaches. Even if he was back at his home in Oahu, he knows he has absolutely no business at a crowded, popular surf bar the night after a major competition. He’s the absolute last person anyone would want to see during their social hour. Still his feet drag him closer, drawn towards the light like a moth. He sits in the shadows down by the water, half hidden by a craggy outcrop of rocks, and listens to the hum of people talking over too-loud music.
Sherlock’s eyes narrow. “You live off-season in the same neighborhood and we ran into you on our way to the airport. I had to be back in London to resolve a passport issue and dragged my coach along, because I’m a high-maintenance snob. Athletes all over the world are traveling today; I doubt we’ll even be the only ones at Heathrow this afternoon. You somehow know Greg from old skiing stuff and Greg forced me to go along and be sociable and let you share our cab. I think you have the capacity to make it up from there.”
His bare feet are cold and stiff in the sand, buried almost up to the ankle. The wind slices through his sweatpants and grabs a hold of his legs, sending shivers up his skin. He hunches his shoulders and tips his head down so that his nose is buried in the neck of the soft sweatshirt covering his thin frame. He hesitates, letting the fabric cast a calm, guarded warmth over the skin of his lips and chin. Then he shuts his eyes tight, shakes his head helplessly at himself, and inhales.
John stretches his legs out, resting his feet on the banister of the porch, and cradles his icy bottle in his lap.
But here, now, in front of roughly a thousand people and at least thirteen official cameras, the thought of having to ruck up his pantleg to prove his accessible-seating deservability is just too much.
We tear at each other kneeling in the dirt, both breathing hard and fast. I can feel him overpowering me. I struggle against his grip and reach out to grab and yank his hair. When I feel the curls against my fingertips I let out a cry I didn’t know was there and sink forward onto him. I hide my face in his chest against the shame of cryin’ in his arms. He grips me so tight against him I think my bones will crack open and bleed.
Interviewer: “And then, that day of his accident. Did you . . . were you aware that his go-pro was still turned on?”
That night I wrote about last time – the night in the bathroom – it changed everything for us. Even in the best times during this pregnancy, even in Spain, neither of us were truly just being ourselves, just John or just Sherlock. We were always pretending. Playacting at the giddy soon-to-be-fathers gay couple, or the over the moon pregnant couple, or the world’s greatest consulting detective and his assistant, or the doctor at the local clinic with a “wife” at home, or the great Sherlock Holmes whose belly wasn’t heavy and full, ready to burst from under the extra large t-shirt.
He slowly, achingly lets his hand slip down between his legs for the first time in years, ears tingling at the unexpected moan that escapes his salty lips. Sherlock sighs as he feels himself harden in his hand, hips moving slowly in a pool of warmth that spreads down his legs to his toes. His breath stutters in his chest as he pumps his long, smooth fingers over his cock, cradling himself in the palm of his hand and trembling at the coiling tension in his groin. His body feels oversensitive. Exposed like the skin’s been peeled back from his bones, revealing his veins to the air. He remembers the way Johnny Watson practically growled as he hunkered down and paddled with all his might, chasing after a wave. He hears the memory of that deep, quiet grunt echo softly in his ears.  When he finally lets go and comes he sees Johnny’s face, fierce and set and determined as they waited for the air horn for their heat, a soldier preparing for battle. And he lies there in the silent, dark aftermath feeling slow and dirty and utterly, ridiculously dull.
and the poor nurse who got stuck with the earliest classification test shift tries to hide his deep yawn behind his arm.
You asked him, I heard you say it, if he feels bad for letting me down. If he regrets that he let me live alone. Why he left me.
Something yanks him so hard to the right he slams face-down in the snow. Noise explodes above him—yelling and the clack of skis, a harsh grunt.
Slowly, his hand reaches up to rub the back of his neck, just beneath his jacket collar. A flash of silver chain.
And Greg can almost fool himself into believing that he won’t be on the sidelines for the first time in his life. That he won’t be growing soft around his middle beneath the puffy layers of his coach’s jacket, and awkwardly waving at old fans mixed with people who have absolutely no idea who he is, and popping Tylenol for his screaming knee. That he won’t be secretly wishing, fiercely, madly,
Sherlock holds up a hand, and John gives Hank a nod as he heads off towards his board, still shaking the muscles in his arms and shoulders loose.
Greg nearly bites his own tongue when the precious word escapes Sherlock’s lips, the one Greg’s only heard a treasured handful of times since that one fateful practice, that night that started it all . . .
The thought of even lookin’ Kurt in the eye fills me with a wild, hidden fear. I wonder if Alma can see, if she could sense, if she somehow knew.
She gives me a look that tells me I done messed up. “It’s the middle of summer, daddy. Got no school for another month.”
Thank you so much for reading about these two surfer dudes, and I sincerely hope you enjoyed their story!
Your granddaddy fought in the war, you know. I know he ain’t told you much about those days—the years he spent in Vietnam when he was young. Your momma, though, she knows. She used to keep your granddaddy company in the kitchen of the little house your momma grew up in for a time back in Signal. It was the nights he couldn’t sleep. He’d wake up afraid. She’d crawl out of bed and join him.
But Greg’s just gone off-script. He can’t bring himself to stick to it. If he does, he might say the wrong thing, push it too far or too fast, and then Sherlock will sneer at him. Repeat the things he said to him in the medical building a week ago: “
It’s adorable, and, since I’m an emotional mess these days, it makes me tear up as I’m writing this. It’s also been really fucking hard. Sleep is nonexistent, inexplicable crying takes up about 60% of each day, Elinor hates every type of formula and milk we’ve ever put in her mouth, and, horror of horrors, Gwen for some reason cries and then spits up whenever Sherlock tries to get them to play with the toy stuffed bacteria dolls he had specially made. It’s exhausting, and frustrating, and infuriating. It’s caused some harsh words between us in the middle of the night when someone has to get up and figure out who’s crying and why (and, I’m sorry Sherlock, but there is NO WAY that you can magically tell by the notes they’re crying what exactly they want and need. Nice try getting me to believe that, love.).
I don’t blame her as I lay down on top of her on the little rickety mattress. I wouldn’t want to see a scar like that either if I were a primped up little girl on my wedding night. All at once my skin remembers the touch of Sherlock’s lips on the gnarled flesh of my chest, the puffs of warm air comin’ from his mouth as he whispered “thank God, thank God,” in the dim firelight of the tent.
The camera pans through the doorways into the rope storage, the mechanics’ supplies, and another hallway before finally peeking through the doorway of the paramedics’ room.
“Aw, fuck you,” John groans. He splashes Sherlock with a handful of water, who gets a mischievous glimmer in his eyes right before leaning across and grabbing John’s shoulders and shoving him clear off his board into the waves.
Watson and Dom both have shovels in their grips, ones which Patrick had leaped down from the helicopter with on his back, and they balance precariously on the new edges of the crevasse as they quickly shovel out snow from within.
Enjoy the final chapter :) Once again, I promise a happy ending. Just a kind heads up that this chapter does contain major character death, as well as brief references to the death of a child.
The line is silent for a long time. So silent John thinks that maybe the call has dropped. His hand shakes, and he’s just about to look down at the screen to see if he’s been talking to a piece of metal and plastic in his palm for the last thirty seconds when James releases an odd shaky breath through the phone.
I can feel Sherlock tense up next to me. Alma’s eyes are wide with fear, lookin’ at him like he’s the devil come walking into her kitchen, all his black magic in tow. He’s scrambling for what to say back when Alma Jr. laughs from the girls’ room.
I sat and waited inside my own personal mini hell, where I was trapped in a block of ice and had jackhammers going off inside my stomach. I’m fairly certain a full minute went by, with Greg barely breaking my gaze.
Sherlock leans down and kisses the side of John’s head once more, like he can’t get enough of the feeling of him against his lips, and John feels warmth spread through a part of himself he never even knew existed when Sherlock whispers into his hair, “you surfed like hell, John Watson.”
I stroked the line of his eyebrow with my thumb, and he hummed in that way he does when he’s coming up for air after a deep sleep.
Now, twenty minutes later, John follows along in Chris’s footsteps in the sand, Sherlock’s presence next to him flowing out to cover every inch of his skin. John can smell him in the air, feel ghosts of his warm touch still hovering on his face and hands, taste the words from his lips on the thin ocean breeze, mixed with a frothing layer of salt.
“Just this,” Sherlock whispers, even though he’s still a little hard under the sheets, and there’s still that little flickering pulse of want between his hips.
“Nothing to be sorry for. Nothing happened. Just a shower,” Johnny says. His voice is calm, but Sherlock can hear the sharpness concealed beneath it. Sherlock nods dumbly and finally runs the towel over himself, the shock from earlier having thoroughly and mercifully killed his erection.
John tears his eyes away from Sherlock and looks out over the empty stretch of beach, endless pools of soft white sand surrounded by rolling hills of craggy green and fluttering flowers. He frowns. “There’s nobody here, though.”
” his look says, so soft I can nearly taste the fresh mountain grass, and I tear my eyes away before I get too lost in the sight.
Greg melts forward into Sherlock’s ready arms, pressing his face into Sherlock’s warm neck. He realizes Sherlock’s already changed into his practice gear, fully ready to burst out on the slopes except for his skis.
-A new surfing term mentioned in this chapter is a double hold-down. This is when a surfer has wiped out and is kept under the water for the period of two full waves. Surfing is insanely dangerous - it will come up more later once Sherlock takes on Waimea. It's like a badge of honor to survive a double hold-down without drowning. Even Kelly Slater famously knocked out by smacking his head against his board and almost drowned fairly recently, and he's considered the world's top surfer alive.
That Ford truck was waiting for me when I came home from ‘Nam. It was covered in near three year’s worth of leaves and dirt, parked next to the little hole in the ground where I guess a neighbor or someone must’ve buried Harry after he put a hole in his own head. The keys were in the glove box, and a can of old gasoline was hidin’ in the weeds. I’d been hitchhiking home all day, from the airport to the bus station to the endless trail of little identical towns that look like a string of beads done broke off a necklace chain that your ma’s had round her neck since before you were born and scattered in a perfect line across the Wyoming horizon.
John hasn’t replied to any of them. Especially not since he turned his mobile off yesterday afternoon, halfway through his walk back to the Village after haphazardly ripping off his skis and slinging his gear bag over his shoulder. He’d been sick to his stomach thinking that Sherlock and Greg would catch up to him in the cart, passing him as he trudged pathetically through the slush, splashing him with mud, begging him to let them drive him back.
John and Greg are both naked, which Sherlock wouldn’t think was necessarily odd for the end of the day if the two of them weren’t just standing there, facing mostly away from him towards the closed blinds. Sherlock squints through the darkness of the room, illuminated only by the sliver of light seeping out from under the bathroom door and the faint glow of the Village lights still on outside. Greg is holding John from behind, his arms wrapped around his chest, and neither of them say anything as Greg buries his face in John’s neck. Sherlock tries to make out what John is doing around the lines of Greg’s body, trying to trace the hints of his arms, the tip of his head over Greg’s shoulder, his elbow—
Greg chuckles through his nose, a small sad smile on his lips. “I do know you, Johnny. So that’s why I want you to tell me why you just had the best week of your life, minus the almost drowning part, but you look even sadder than you did that first day I met you.”
“I remember she fell. My dad screamed at me and Mikey to get her back home and he stormed off. But Mikey followed him, and everyone else just stood there staring. So I had to try and help her up by myself. And as I was trying to help her up she just kept telling me she was ok and that I should go and play with my friends. Except I didn’t have a single goddamn friend there.”
As if he’s bumped into an octopus, Sherlock is immediately enfolded in strong arms, stretching the breadth of his back. Any lingering doubt that he wouldn’t be welcome here is chased from his mind. He doesn’t even need a blanket. He is entirely warm. Safe. He lets out all the air in his lungs, possibly for the first time since John stepped up to the starting line. Since Sherlock realized he was about to fall. Since they all boarded the plane here.
Cut to Greg back at the base, leaning hard against the side of one of the helicopters. His short brown hair is drenched with sweat, and he rubs once over his face with his palms. We have never seen him so un-composed. We have zero clues, from the look on his face, what was the outcome of the mission.
that these two men let Sherlock so much as flutter around in their orbit. That they give him precious inches, incomprehensible seconds of their touch and warmth, when the two of them should instead be each tightly bound to the other, permanently balanced in their own capable, solid world. From the beginning to the end. Steady, without some . . . some
Watson: “He just doesn’t want you to think he’s too much of a softie now that you know he bakes cakes for fun.”
I can feel the sweat prickling under my arms as I slip it into the mailbox and shuffle out the door, convincin’ myself that every cowboy and housewife around me out in the street don’t know the truth of who I was just correspondin’ with while Sherlock’s postcard burns a hole in my front shirt pocket. Danger zips up my spine like a lick of flame, and I want to whistle as loud as I can so even the sky up over Baker can hear me.
