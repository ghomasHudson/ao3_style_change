SHERLOCK: I’M SORRY?
John watches him pick away at the singular sprout with his fork, with an increasingly deep frown on his square jaw. Eventually he takes Sherlock’s fork, spirals a wad of noodles onto it, and shoves it in his mouth. Mary pretends not to laugh.
"I don't know what else to teach you," John looks up and sees that Sherlock is looking down at him with those “only-for-John” eyes he doesn’t realise he’s doing. John can only hope he’s not doing the same back, but in vain.
What can it mean— it’s a stupid question. It can only mean there is something even closer: what lies in wait on the other side his pupils, where the light scatters across the back of his eyes, where the fibers combine into the ocular nerve and the wires cross in front of his brain, traversing to the back of his head. It’s not the kind of closer that naturally occurs to those who favor themselves fully intact and in one piece.
Careful to avoid his injured wrist, he reaches for him, managing to get him to turn, if only a little. Sherlock looks at him funny in a way he doesn't quite understand– as if mortally wounded, yet graceful in defeat, resigned to some invisible fatal weakness, some unspoken Achilles’ heel.
One of the residents comes out to inform them of the status. The expression on his face isn’t reassuring.
“Not a trick, John.”
Where is he?” John demands, standing and throwing the magazine back on the tabletop, “I want to see him right now-"
“Sir, are you alright?” John asks, kneeling down to take his pulse. He appears to be a few years past middle-aged with whitening hair, but otherwise in seemingly healthy condition.
that had happened, is something he will never fathom. And before anyone asks, the reason that his body had turned hot, trembling head to foot with rage like a six-foot totem pole of jealous envy, was
"I..." He's commanding his body to answer back, but when it doesn't cooperate, he mentally curses himself.
“You did not,” he confirms with his genial smile, offering no explanation.
“Because I’m.. I’m sick,” he naturally struggles to admit to him, the very opposite, a paragon of rationality.
Obviously dissatisfied with Sherlock’s assessment, Mary reverts back to John’s peacefully slumbering form with a ‘hmph’, arms crossed. Undeterred, she glares at him with narrow eyes as if he might be feigning his unconsciousness, and without a second thought, stands to full height on the seat cushion, steps over him up onto the sofa arm, and balances herself on the backboard, where she intends to springboard off and land on John.
"You’ll have to excuse me-" Mycroft had said, "I’ve an urgent matter to attend to." And Mycroft had walked off to worry about whatever global crises he was juggling, and John had watched, and Sherlock had watched him watch. It took Mycroft all of 5.6 seconds to slow his steps and deduce something was indeed wrong, stopping in his tracks beneath the Duke of York column.
Mary looks up at him seriously, with a set of ultramarine irises that look just like John’s and and have a profound effect on Sherlock.
“It’s the bottom one.”
“As I said, John is out of service,” Sherlock replies civilly.
“It was uh.. nevermind. At what time was it?” she asks, checking the clipboard on the wall.
"It was just a joke," Anderson says in his defense. Needless to say, crime scene humor often is in poor taste.
in jail right now," he taunts him in a voice that makes Sherlock shiver, pulling Sherlock back by the upper arm so that he can talk directly into his ear.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Please stop this," John says, knowing the way his voice sounds and not caring, "You don't have to do this. There are other ways-"
His hand curls on his gloves, making them crunch with disapproval. She's making fun of him.

“Nope.” John says, perfectly content with that answer.
, you said. Your words, not mine," she says in her defense, absolving herself of any culpability in the matter.
"The only way he doesn't is if he isn't a sociopath, which I know for a fact he is. Trust me, I’ve got two murders and one psychotic homicidal sister to prove it."
"That's not it-"
“I fail to see how that is any of my concern,” he says, not ungluing his eyes from the array of disorganized boxes. Surely there must be a method to this madness.
could have."
It’s a remarkably peaceful morning in 221B with the dull ambient noise of traffic outside and a weak breeze drafting from the window, wafting in the vanilla curtains. John reposes on his armchair with lukewarm mug of tea on the coffee table, reading the morning standard when
“This isn’t funny, John,” she’s quite visibly upset, John is impressed by the theatrics.
A far cry from relenting however, Sherlock seems to have decided on being vindictive about it, refusing to yield to John's intimidation tactics. "I would treat you no differently than I would her. If you were a criminal, I would see to it that you were locked up in kind, ideally as cellmates," he states. It's all John can do to not accidentally break his arm. Logic over emotion. Always. It was insufferable. If there were any exceptions to that steadfast rule, John wasn't one of them.
Just when he feels as though he can’t handle it anymore, it withdraws, for some reason deterred.
does, nor a
John looks so seamless, so perfectly in his element, while Sherlock looks like a deer caught in the headlights, or a cat caught in the engine, as is probably the more accurate visual. The brunet stares, pupils gaping burrows in the translucence of his irises, neck, angle of his head, and gaze all fixed attentively on the medic. John stands several paces away, far enough for Mary not to notice him over her shoulder, but close enough to be well within hearing range.
He comes to the surface half-alive, but is soon gasping for breath rapidly and anxiously, not knowing whether to cry with relief or misery that he lives to die another moment. His heart leaps in his chest when his eyes catch the rock he’d been in the midst of a journey toward earlier. He tears after it, his muscles protesting the abuse, but operational under the fuel of adrenaline.
“We’ll have to think on this,” he decides.
“Why can’t other people know?” Mary’s voice contends for John’s focus, traveling down the confines of the cloister and its pilastered walls as the passage redirects to the mainroom. Slender windows that run along the corridor cast cold light against the canopy overhead. The ethereal, dissipating light filters down only halfway, creating a dim, haunted effect in contrast with the warm lighting emanating from cathedral centre.
Another pause, perhaps the voice has finally relented and he can get on with the sidewalk spatter.
“At the crime scene. There was a body next to the pool,” he insists, but Greg still seems to have no idea what he’s talking about, “He was
Interrupt what? he thinks, haplessly. Interrupting would imply some level of interaction, which is largely limited at this point.
Sherlock tries to pull himself together in the fogginess, but can’t shake the lurid, dreamlike quality of it all in the chaos of blaring alarms and stobing lights.
"Sir, I'm sorry to inform you Sherlock Holmes didn't make it."
“Sherlock…”
"Did you get cut?" Rose is asking, although he dosn't entirely hear her.
Ignored.
? Certainly nothing legal.
“I’m merely offering an impartial perspective,” he says, stepping over the kitchenette tiles, still drying his hands, before discarding the towel on the counter and entering the living room, “On your competing affections for the two characters represented in the video.”
“There is no seven-eight-three-five.”
13. DO YOU TELL LIES OR SAY INSINCERE THINGS?
“What? Hey, come back—” Mary laughs at his ridiculously abrupt and nonsensical mood swing, but feels obliged to call after him anyway. Despite her efforts to make amends, he continues several more paces toward the parking lot, acting miffed. “Are you serious?” she implores, stuck behind the fence.
Panting from exhaustion, his bandages torn and lying around here and there, eventually Sherlock stops trying twist his way out of John's hold, which is an impossible feat anyway. John can feel him shudder at the sensation of John's nose against his hair, frightened stiff. John's hand slides down Sherlock's sleeve in a fond, gentle caress to reassure him, but the gesture elicits a jolt instead, just a touch of the fingers on fabric enough to make him nearly jump out of his own skin, apparently. Did John really terrify him so much?
“Well, your mail is everywhere! You’ve been putting it off for too long. Really, you ought to get a handle on your domestic life, you two. I know you’re busy but figure it out. I’m not your housekeeper.”
John wakes up grouchy seeing that the beacon has expended its supply of firewood and, as apparent from the deserted horizon line, succeeded in garnering no one’s attention whatsoever. What remains of the smoke signal is distorted by the sweep of oceanic wind.
John grits his teeth. Try as he may, to make peace with Sherlock's pettiness, he's not a saint. And that's what it is- pettiness, not 'a sense of justice'. Please. The only issue here is if John were to kill her, he'd ruin the sport of it, and they couldn't have that, could they?
“Mr. Watson! L-ovely day for the wedding, isn’t it?” Nigel beams at him. John looks vaguely amused.
?!" he yells.
"Over my dead body," he says, his voice suddenly turning hard, making clear there was no compromise to be made here. Sherlock scowls when he realizes he's having him on and goes for the door.
," she says, setting the record straight in case there was any doubt left in his head, for every discrete little microphone listening to hear.
"But I do. I understand perfectly," he feels Sherlock's low voice rumble in his chest, sounding almost amused to John's dismay. There's something worrisome in his voice that John doesn't even recognize at first. He must've misheard- it's couldn't be hatred?
your violin?"
“Isn’t your dad Dr. Watson?” Nigel asks Mary. Mary doesn’t say anything, arms crossed, chewing on her tongue.
Sherlock interrupts her remorselessly executed descent, catching her in midair. “Now, now, you mustn’t do that,” he chides her, setting a very disgruntled seven-year old on the carpet, “You’ll interrupt his beautiful dreams.”
“Please,” he breathes in a soft, pleading tone, leaning an elbow onto the table and raking his fingers into his long hair. Is so sweet he can’t even bring himself to say something that sounds more like refusal.
Sherlock darts to the sink in the WC, feeling sick. The Diogenes' lavatory, like all of its rooms, is repulsively elegant and dully lit, with granite countertops the colour of envy and beveled obsidian walls. The whole complex reeks of all things evil, from the villainous wallpaper closing in from all sides to the aristocratic stuffiness that's thick enough to choke on. It's all rather befitting of his brother's lair, where untold crimes against humanity have no doubt been conceived.
“No its-” John jumps in and waves him off distractedly without looking up.

“Where the hell is—“
"Your decisions are your own, John. I fail to see how I can be held responsible for them. After all, this was your brilliant idea, was it not? Solving everything with your fists is your specialty not mine and
“What is this place?” John asks, noticing the strange temperature drop as they enter. Craning his neck he can see multiple stories above, seperated by glass floors, and a high-rise ceiling. Access is restricted on all floors and the place is crawlng with security. It appears to be a covert, converted medical facility.
Nigel plants his face in his able hand. John’s cellular begins chiming, and Nigel gradually removes his face from his hand, looking at Johns lab coat pocket.
“What the hell did she do to your hands?”
“That being said, if you are in fact, someone’s father, it counts for very little. It just means— what? That they supplied you with half your non-mitochondrial DNA?” Sherlock laughs, “It doesn’t imply a relationship, nor an obligation to one thereof, it just means that you have fulfilled your basic purpose of reproducing and congratulations is in order.”
The human looks peaceful in death, with long, silky waves of greyish, sunlight-coloured hair that drift above his forehead. He has a guarded, reserved face—a square, set jaw that doesn’t give beneath the merperson’s touch, and trim lips that are flush with dusky pink colour, set against his overall deathly pallor.
“What? No, no, wait—” John gasps with an airy, nervous laugh. Tilted back in Sherlock’s hands, he’s hanging onto him for what seems like dear life, ribcage compressed against Sherlock’s, pattering and threatening to explode. His eyes are in deadlock with Sherlock’s, flashing a caged animal look—a pristine rendition of a deer in the headlights, wild wide-eyed and vivid, lit-up blue. Though the amused smile tugging tenuously at the corners his parted lips suggests he’s laughing a little at himself.
The spatula clatters on the counter top. John’s mind hitches, unable to locate the words, formulate basic English. It just starts unwinding reels and reels of nonsensical gibberish, spinning out of control.
“Know what?”
have to hazard guesses whether you could even stand it if you knew what she did," he says, annoyed, "I'm constantly grasping at straws as to whether you could even love someone who surrendered to the likes of her, who fell to her feet in disgrace, and played right into her hands just as easily as the rest of her victims, like the
“You lucky devil,” he smiles ruefully, his expression one of blatant adoration, and Sherlock reflects back immaculately, a splitting image of requital, what looks damn-near like weakness, mortal weakness, flickering faintly in the far reaches of those dark spheres. But that’s something sociopaths do isn’t it— feigning mutuality with mimicry.
“Really is a mystery..!” he returns, his annoyance apparent.
"He is," he acknowledges, running his fingers over the red stain she's left on his bottom lip, and then looks up in dark triumph, "and so are you."
“Why does he think about
Before he can parse out her intentions or worry about what dosage she's given him, he swoons, collapsing on the table.
Equally frightened by the alarming sounds coming from that direction, the soldier glances up to find a man approaching them, clad in a dark cape. Two infantrymen open fire on him but he disappears, reappearing behind them like a fleeting, unnatural shadow. Before they know it, he's torn his hand straight through the ribcages with his bare hands and left them crippled on the floor, leaving only two remaining survivors that are holding the soldier captive.
SHERLOCK: CRUEL TO ANIMALS? WHAT KIND OF SICK, TWISTED- I MEAN, YES.
"Alright," John says numbly, as they make their way back to the entry room. He doesn’t mean to sound ungrateful, just that its more of a consolation prize than anything else. John takes one last look at Sherlock as they leave. Mycroft parts ways with him at the front gate to be escorted out by security personnel.
—” He tries a random book off the shelf beneath the bison skull, but realizes he has it memorized verbatim, and pauses awkwardly on the first page. These are the pitfalls of photographic memory.
"It's not about you, it's about the cases," John says, frankly surprised he doesn't appreciate the distinction.
“Look, the way I see it, we’re both covered,” Mary says, placing a spoon in her mouth while she momentarily reaches up to get sugar from the cabinet, “You killed him, what’s he gonna do? Kill you back?”
Foolhardy.
"Sherlock-" Lestrade tries to say, but Sherlock doesn't hear it because he's already out the door.
“Is it not? I find it hysterical- Mrs. Davenport was the only one who noticed.” Observing the two elder Davenports across the hall, he smirks at what must be an inside joke only he gets, as John isn't likewise amused. John’s breathing slows with building rage, and he clenches his left hand resolutely.
"You write a blog about me."
“You look very handsome John,” Sherlock says.
”Yes, fine.”
“What time is it?” John asks, sitting up and Sherlock backs off of him as naturally as possible. Thankfully John is fantastic at asking all the wrong questions.
“This is the
“Shit. There really is charcoal in you hair.” Sherlock raises his eyebrows against soft, half-lidded eyes in an expression of scintillating integrity,
“You’re.. immaculate.”
Of course.
The regularly oiled handgun in combination with the twin-strapped shoulder holsters he has been in the habit of slipping under a jacket suggests something along the lines of a government agent or freelance assassin. Judging by the current state of affairs, Sherlock is more inclined toward the latter.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Chick bait?” Sherlock demands, taken aback, although he has no idea what that means. He looks to Mary for a translation, but she shrugs helplessly, shaking her head at the nonsense. Apparently the boy doesn’t make any sense to her either.
John takes his leave to join Mrs. Davenport by the proximate refreshment table, and as he brushes by Sherlock's shoulder he says in a low voice, “You put her in Mary’s dress. That’s nice touch.”
"The case files, it's always about the case files," he replies.
"So the moment she gets the upper hand, you lose faith in me is that it?" Sherlock demands suddenly. John is completely floored by the accusation- the thought- the
"Stop it, just stop it, Sherlock. Please," he says, his voice strained and high-pitched. And they're at it again. Part of John knows it's no use trying to stop him. Sherlock would never give up on this because it's not in his nature, in the same way it's not in John's nature to stop protecting him. It was like one of those pesky equations with no solutions. He shakes his head, water clouding his vision. "You don't know how much I hate this."
They're at a standstill, neither one breaking eye contact. John feels like he's on the verge of being torn in half, trying to compartmentalize all the conflicting emotions in his head, screaming

SHERLOCK: PEOPLE THINK I’M ASEXUAL.
“Come with me. I’ll take a look at you,” John beams, setting off down the corridor.
“How do you calculate that?” she asks in dismay, “He won’t even talk to me. I’m resigned to say he just hates me.”
His part-coy-part-not stare runs over its lioness pose, with arms beneath its torso, all white skin. Its lower body rests against the rock the way a woman might sit on a picnic blanket, legs bent aside, flank tilted up against the press of cement so that the curve of hipbone becomes pronounced. And somehow, despite the distance he has put between them, John can see its supernatural green eyes leering at him, varying in intensity like starlight. The creature is terrifying, granted, but also extremely beautiful. Realizing that he’s having difficulty breathing, John looks away and closes his mouth.
Sherlock frowns. John's facultative problems were clearly more severe than he'd originally thought.
"You're not concerned? He took two bullets protecting you and barely made it to the hospital."
Once sensation returns to his fingertips, he gropes around on the floor for his phone, which has coincidentally fallen on the floor just out of reach. His fingers meet the familiar feel of his iPhone, he picks it up and speed dials Greg. The tone on the other end indicates the line is busy. He raps his fingers on the floor and dials again, glowering at the ceiling. He gets the answering machine, which suggests he leave a message. He hangs up and redials until Greg is forced to either take his call or endure the continuous assault on his eardrums as the phone rings in the background with the persistence of a debt collection agency.
Sherlock gives him a withering look, his patience worn thin. "I'm a graduate chemist."
, John."
"So then it's fine, for anyone to shag you, so long as it helps you solve a case?" John says pointedly, blood surging through his veins.
The creature presides over John’s activity from the remote recesses of his stone fortress, intrigued and very much engaged in its efforts but keeping a distance so as to allow its labours to proceed uninterrupted. The human seems to be amassing an obscene amount of wood, for what purpose the sea creature can only fathom a guess. There is no rhyme or reason to the structure, it’s perfectly chaotic, and yet despite the lack of form, it must certainly have a function, he has no doubt of that.
“I’m not going to vanish into thin air,” he responds tiredly, eyes much softer now in response to the gentleness of John's hand.
“Sherlock, I didn’t..“
Oh right, about that.. perhaps he should explain. It's not exactly one of his proudest moments. Around the seventeenth time Sherlock had wound up in the ICU, it had gone something like...
It starts with the little things. A missing file, a mislabeled corpse. Trifles, little details apparently no one cares about but that are actually everything.
, although it backfires constantly, as in this present example, by suggesting he's married to him.
"You don't look at me the same," he says, finally addressing him, "Now all you look at me with is pity. Like I'm broken." His voice- the way he hesitates finishing that sentence- it turns the world to static and free-falling ash, the idea itself so foreign to John he can't even believe the words he's hearing. He sees his lips moving but the words don't make any sense.
Right?
Undeterred, she draws out a chair and takes a seat at the game board. “I'll tell you what, if you win I will walk over to Scotland Yard right now and turn myself in,” she says brazen-faced, twirling a dark pawn in her fingers. A stroke of inspiration glints in her eyes and her smile curves steadily upward. “Or better yet, I'll tell you how I did it."
“Anytime you want to calm down…”
John smiles in amusement and a pleasant sense of vindication, leaning forward to steal a glance at that unremarkable, unreadable face. It’s worthy of a headline, the scandalous Sherlock Holmes and his scathingly sharp tongue with nothing clever or stupefying to say. On the contrary, he’s intriguingly quiet, ‘being weird’ so to speak (atypically weird), which John almost finds cute, until he realises why he sees it that way; the numb, carefully blank line of mouth, the subtle elusion of eyes that won’t meet his, vaguely reminds him of some poor, dour schoolboy detained after-hours in the classroom, harbouring a borderline-painful crush on his teacher but unable to muster the courage to voice a confession that is, in any case, hopeless. John momentarily wonders why he made that association, or what that makes him in the analogy, but ultimately he feels a twinge of remorse for evoking that expression. Perhaps he’s crossed some sort of line there?
Sherlock shakes his head and rolls his eyes, head leaning on his hand. Portrait of a man resigned to his inevitable fate- boredom. He reaches for his phone to curb his symptoms.
“I didn’t kill him,” Sherlock grumbles like a chastised child, “Check his pulse if you don’t believe me.”
“Then what does?!”
There’s a shot from behind, unremarkable in every way, excluding the fact it’s the last one he hears. And then there’s the nerve endings, exploding like fireworks. The sound of them snapping.
!” John cries, his spacial memory apparently not as immediate as Sherlock's deductions.
“You could do what he did.”
"I don't think that would fix the problem," he replies. She smiles at that, amused at how he always goes through the pains of maintaining that proper and aloof facade.
.” it says finally, catching John’s ear, “
illicit lover dumped you last night, Sally," Sherlock offers his condolences, puncturing the inflated ballon that was her ego. John is semi-uncomfortable with the unspoken implication that has yet to be negated, seeing that his retort was more of a confirmation than a denial. "But then again, he was something of a prat."
“'I know?' What do you mean
Nigel laughs. “Hopefully it’ll clear up.”
"I'll leave you to weather his rage," she says gesturing at John, not that Sherlock fully takes her meaning. Then he sees the way John is looking at him and stops short, locking eyes.
He stands up, nearly knocking over the table in the process. The game pieces topple to the floor and he watches them roll on the ground, feeling light-headed. Amid his blaring senses, a pulse that won't stop hammering in his ears, skin that won't stop burning, he detects a faint laugh.
But John is much too distracted by something else to be particularly concerned with Sherlock’s metaphorical little trip-up. While everyone else carries on naturally, John is, in effect, swept sideways by the phenomenon of the two of them dancing. He's completely floored by what he’s seeing namely because he’s seen it before. John can remember so vividly the same steps being taught to him for his wedding that sometimes he sees Sherlock dancing with Mary and other times he sees Sherlock dancing with himself, at their flat, behind closed doors and drawn curtains.
about your sister’s phone? (mostly, anyway),”
, Sherlock lost his basic human rights and became a non- consensual parent.
"After all this time, after everything we've been through together, is that really what you think I want? How can a someone as brilliant as you be so daft?"
“We’ll have to ask John when he wakes,” he resolves and sets the violin in its velvet-lined case, sliding the bow into position above it.
"John, she's getting away-" he hisses in annoyance but John's grip only tightens on his wrists, locking him in against the wall. John looks at him meaningfully. For the life of him, Sherlock can't understand why John is looking at him that way, earnest and pleading.
“No?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“No I’m not,” he articulates, “See— no I’m not. You remember the wedding videos?”
Sherlock has taken his queue to run over to the medical examiner’s office, only to discover he’s too late. There’s no record of Ajay’s body anywhere. After searching the coroner’s records to no avail, he takes the elevator down to the morgue and starts unzipping the body bags of all the latest arrivals at random, including one that was in the delicate process of being identified, causing the family of the deceased a premature shock. Eventually Molly gets called down because of complaints that Sherlock is wreaking havoc.
Late October 1915
“If that doesn’t work then, the only recourse would be to kiss him.”
The merperson drags the body up the shore until the sand is dry and scalding white. Encroaching waves only reach to the base of his trunk, circling about his tailfin, and the nuisance shark could only reach them if it wanted to beach itself. The sun is blinding and disdainfully harsh on his fair skin.
"Alright," John gives, trying to repress the edge in his voice. It was a bit much to fret over his friend's romantic interests like this, and maybe even a tad pathetic. If John was gay that would be one thing, but he was just a lonely, straight forty-three year old who was in dire need of a life.
The lights go on.
"It was unprofessional," John says looking at the ME's report, "I should have done something."
They make no motion to attack, daunted by the sudden, single-handed slaughter of the rest of their troop, right in the middle of the supposed safety of their camp, no less. When they train on him, the soldier realizes he recognizes those silver eyes from that night at the tavern and a tremor of dread runs through him. The soldier takes in the destruction he's wrecked and the shell casings of all of the bullets that should have riddled him. His breath quickens at the thought of his impending death at the hands of this immortalized apparition, more monster than man.
“How many times I’ve imagined you were there when you weren’t—“ John goes off, then stops sharply. He can't believe it's arguing with him about this, after acknowledging the fourth wall and that its not real.
He stares up at that redoubtable, escalating tower with a slight pit in his stomach, a gnawing, quietly thundering sensation of de ja vu, so deeply stirring, speaking in volumes, all from so simple an action as a dance that, from a passing glance might not appear particularly remarkable at all— in fact, it
John covers his face in his hands, his shoulders sagging. "I did."
“Thank you,” Mary manages, trying not to crack her teeth.
—” he tries to explain, then trails off, leaving the pair hanging in suspense. Sherlock blinks and Mary scowls, confused by the non-sequitur.
And then something wakes up inside him, paralyzing and short circuiting his movements, running cold through his veins down to every digit in his right hand and he feels emboldened with calm, sudden conviction. Change of plans.

Sherlock can't win this, I really wish he'd stop trying.
Sherlock is being stupid. Meanwhile, John is trying to replace him with tea.
John: What are you two doing?
"What am I supposed to do? Run and cower behind a girl?" Sherlock asks, not liking this at all.
Sherlock takes a sip of his tea, which has long grown cold. "What time is it?"
He rolls his eyes. Why did he even ask?
"Yes!" he says exasperatedly, but this does not seem to appease John. In fact, it does the opposite.
“Ever wonder why that is?”
it deplores, and John grins back at him wickedly with mischievousness more befitting a schoolboy than an adult.
12. DO YOU HAVE "SHALLOW AFFECT"?
"You really like your profession don't you?" she asks, returning to casual conversation like she didn't just confess to one of the worst killing sprees of the newly-minted millennium, "These images don't bother you?"
Sherlock is gazing down at him with eyes that strangely seem to know more than they are letting on, holding back something he cannot say. "
“Sherlock,” John chides him.
A/N So, many of you said you wanted angst and not fluff... which was the wrong answer, guys, idk why you do this to yourselves. Also, many of you wanted more dominant John Watson, which is also a not a good idea... because then this happens. I have so many regrets right now.
“Never better.”
SHERLOCK: THAT IS DIRECTLY CORRELATED TO THE NUMBER OF PATCHES ON MY FOREARM.
Ridiculous?
“John, it..“ Sherlock is speechless.
He’s unable to unravel what it is. It’s too far gone, a key tossed away into the depths of the subconscious where everything is in disarray. When he finally lies down after pacing a half marathon, it plagues him endlessly, a gnawing feeling in the back of his mind, flitting around the edges of his conscious thoughts.
He's heart broken! John thinks this is about the time he should start laughing, but it's something in those eternally serious eyes, that commands him not to. He knows him. He recognizes him, that severe unrelenting stare.
“You can’t keep pacing around ignoring me. This has to stop-“
"Yes it is," Sherlock insists. Watching John's expression is almost better than watching the television itself. Sherlock can practically piece together what's playing on the screen from just his face alone. John looks at him like he's wondering why Sherlock is enjoying this and not horrified.
Sherlock suddenly seems remarkably disinterested in John’s proposal, eyes shifting down, relegating to the floor in distaste. John is puzzled by the sudden withdrawal, but as his eyes run over his flatmate, the slight downturned frown on that noble face, the disengaged aversion of his eyes, the sea-green, lacklustre irises thrown dejected upon the burgundy expanse carpet, he recognizes the defeated expression as one he’s seen on rare occasion, the one he’s dubbed as
toast.”
"If I have to marry you so that you can never again give me crap about standing down when your life is at stake, then so help me I will," John said, no less content about their current predicament than the last sixteen iterations of this happening.
“Miami.”
Sherlock: I mean I could, I could print it out for you, if you wanted.
“Jump him
"Did you do this in that kitchen of yours you call a lab? It's not admissible," Anderson says, tossing the photocopy back onto the desk, into the metaphorical reject pile.
John sighs. He couldn't keep indulging in this make-believe fantasy world where supposedly nothing happened, where everything was perfectly fine, content to let everything go unacknowledged and ignored. Leaving Sherlock on his own with this was not helping anyway, if the nighttime tea parties were any indication.
“God forbid he doesn’t return my feelings. I don’t know if I can take that kind of rejection.” he says sadly, with a a set of unconsolable eyes. He’s very good at acting, which naturally, sociopaths are. Mary looks exasperated beyond repair.
“What, do you expect me to remember every single John Doe?” Greg laughs dryly, but then stills when he sees the humorless look on Sherlock’s face.
“It wakes people up.”
“What d’you mean, why do we share a flat?" John replies monotonously, pouring the cereal into the bowl, "We’ve always shared a flat. It’s Sherlock. That’s what we do. We share a flat with him.”
without crime-solving?”
“Gabriel?” he had said. There was something about the way he had recognized the interloper, as if in awe. Like he was a dead man walking, the specter of a friend he used to know.
"John-!" Sherlock grabs his arm in alarm, preventing him from moving further. The enemy seizes the moment of vulnerability to attack, dislodging John's gun, but not before John eliminates his accomplices with two rounds.
"I meant it- what I said," John offers softly, not exactly proud of it, but part of him wants to say it out loud anyway, feeling warmth rise on his cheeks at the acknowledgement.  "You must know it, too. I think you enjoy it, how I-" He loses his voice for a moment and clears his throat, "I think of you
He didn’t feel the need to leap to his feet and watch John cross the street from his balcony window.
"I'd thought of you as a friend!" he rants against the hardwood, sounding so betrayed John falters. It's as if Sherlock had physically injected his hand with a stapler gun. When Sherlock falls forward with an unpleasant thud he feels as if something other than his own grip just broke. His heart lying in shambles like the glass littered all over the carpet, he can't even manage a 'Sherlock, you're being crazy' or a 'news flash, I'm not a rapist and if I was I think you'd know about it'. He reaches a hand out to comfort him, but Sherlock cringes from him. John's nails claw into the flesh of his palm, wanting to touch him so badly.
he seizes some obscure off-beat moment to admit, after the somewhat awkward pause. All of his movements are perfectly synchronized due to a superior sense of rhythm, yet somehow this singular response manages to evade all that powerful machinery and emerge disjointed.
“Yes!” it avows proudly.
“Well, we’ll just have to stay and make sure he does,” Mary smiles down at him, and Sherlock blinks at her.
“Uh th-that’s not necessary,” the adolescent stammers out hastily.
JOHN: WHAT HE SAID.
“No.”
"So, what's the thinking here? You think you're going to casually visit this woman who low-key probably fantasizes about running your body through with some sort of antediluvian pendulum from the Spanish Inquisition or whatever the hell she did to those bodies, and the plan is to what, emerge miraculously unharmed?"
“Didn’t do what right?” is a response he wasn’t quite anticipating.
"Please," he whispers, stifling his anger and trying a softer approach, "Do this for me, at least. I can't do go on like this knowing what she did- " Sherlock is tense, his back turned, concealing his expression. John reaches for his hand, holding it tenuously in his fingers.
“I must have deleted..” Sherlock mutters, putting a hand to his forehead.
"I think that that decapitated head in the garden terrace should be sufficiently decayed by now," he muses absent-mindedly, no doubt thinking, with his somewhat incongruous sense of aesthetic, that the idea of decaying human remains suits late-romantic era music perfectly. These sorts of things really don't help when John is trying to explain to normal people that he's not a psychopath.
They enter the second to last room on the left of the hallway, where John heads to the counter where he retrieves a spare manila file. Nigel files in behind him.
Sorry we still haven't gotten to the real angsty part yet. i want to get that part in next... although there's a fluffy filler section that goes in around here too which might provide some respite from all the drama. Decisions decisions
Sherlock takes up his violin as he walks over to the window sill, where he plays an eerie triplet of sharps on the upbow, then halts full stop. Slowly the bow travels back down again as he stares at the drab world through the sifting curtains, old buildings and rainy weather.
.. really?” John asks, pleasantly surprised. He laughs weakly, realizing “come to bed” meant “I’m dragging you to bed”.
Lestrade blinks at the weapon as if he hadn't noticed it before, considering that John is perhaps right.
John creases his eyebrows, and shakes his head minutely. “What are you getting at?”
“What are you doing?!” John demands in outrage.
, but it doesn't hurt any less when Sherlock throws the fact at him like a bloody boomerang.
“John…” he says in a deep, threatening, deeply discontented voice.
She has her fingers twisted in his lapel, tracing over the petals of the rose in his chest pocket. She's drawn out the pretty thing and started pestering it, absently torturing the pale pink petals with her fingers. John flexes his jaw at the sight. It's extremely vexing to watch her defile his appearance like that for no decent reason.
The gesture is all in good fun, perfectly harmless, but when John retracts a final few inches, his mind freezes. Then his eyes widen with the pain of a sudden and invisible stab wound, and out of no-where, water runs from his eyes, spilling out in glowing streams of refracted light.
” he says just softly enough to miss. It comes across distracted, as some off-beat, stray thought that Mary barely manages to catch. While Mary struggles to discern whether she heard him right, Sherlock redirects his attention to her, returning with improved clarity and diction.
“It’s a full-on break, Nigel,” John states clean and simple, rising to his feet, “They’re going to find out.”
John narrows his gaze at the wool material which boasts a partial tear and remnants of deteriorated insulator rubber. Yes, John is green with envy.
“Around 2AM this morning.”
8. DO YOU DISREGARD THE SAFETY OF YOURSELF AND OTHERS?
“Don’t be sassy,” she says. Sherlock abides and mends his ways.
"He was a cold case I cracked," he feels obliged to explain when John looks skeptical. "Well, almost cracked. We tried to lock him up but there were issues with the evidence. It had a tendency to disappear."
The breeze is stronger on the rooftop, coursing through his hair. He breathes in through his nose.
"Oh. Okay. I see how it is,” Sherlock says playfully, then haughtily plods off from whence he came.
"It stresses me out," Sherlock hisses in the manhole-spotted darkness, "What if you run out of ammo?"
"If you thought that you wouldn't be seeking Mycroft's help!" Sherlock thunders with a flare of temper and violent throw of his hand. He turns away after issuing his condemnation, presumably go lick his wounds and sulk, but instead John grips his shirt to keep him there, willing him to understand, wanting to hammer it into his staggeringly idiotic, ingenious mind.
JOHN: VEGETARIAN.
"What?" John breathes a shallow, tenuous, glassy breath he didn't realize he was holding. Sherlock's comment leaves him confused but hesitant to question it, like he's walking on eggshells.
John and Sherlock are coasting together in a cab, sitting across from each other as the streets of London blend in the window. “You alright?” John asks, giving his raven-haired companion a once-over. He looks a touch disheveled, shirt rustled, hair wind-swept, but very satisfied.
“Good,” the man says, gazing down at him with piqued interest, “I couldn’t help but overhear— You mentioned Rose?” he asks in a generic dialect.
Sherlock looks at him undeferentially. "You can't," he says, watching that knowledge sink in, confirming itself in John's eyes.
Sherlock shakes his head in confusion. Something about the man doesn’t add up. He must be at least some kind of double agent, seeing that his accent is British but his gun is government-issued American. Although the way he speaks is almost unnaturally perfect, giving the impression that it was learned— that English is a second language. And that makes him what? Triple?
Sherlock looks dumbstruck at first, but then he swallows and his lips reform that atrocious smile. Now he’s playing with the fork in his mouth, biting his lip. He looks like lust, his shirt’s falling off one shoulder, peeling off gleaming white skin. His knee takes to nudging against John’s incessantly, and eventually John just grips it. Sherlock’s all over the place, boneless, out of control, but it’s all perfectly intentional. It’s always perfectly calculated with Sherlock, even when he goes off the bend. John knows he’s laughing internally, teasing, being intentionally torturous, because he knows John won’t touch him.
“It’s a facile enough definition but there is no leeway in what it is. There is no separate, softer definition to accommodate soppy sentimental ideas like adoptive parents, same-sex parents, or anything of the like,” he rambles, his voice becoming derisively maudlin and trite. John swallows painfully, listening.
“You messed up,” she realizes, the novelty of an epiphany resonating in her voice.
“That was the one test I could never pass,” he states it blandly, a true lost cause.
"I don't cave to temptation-" he huffs in defiance, the idea itself contemptible.
He sets about making tea as an excuse to occupy his hands, not that he wants any. He nearly pours two mugs out of habit before stopping himself. He's put an excessive amount of honey in one and it irks him. He turns off the stove and plants both hands on the counter. Tea is usually his cure-all for even the most hardfast of problems, but here it's done him no favors.
“You think?” Sherlock pretends to be self-conscious, taking a graceful side-step into fourth position so that they swerve around, “that’s kind of embarrassing. I didn’t realize Rowen and I were so alike.” Sarcasm. Sarcasm. Sarcasm. Mary rolls her eyes, needing a break from all the sarcasm, and frankly wishes she could face-palm right now.
“That’s fine Sherlock,” John snips, writing him off, “but Mary, as you will inevitability observe— I don’t love him and I never will love him like I loved your mother,” he declares, then done with his rant, turns on his heel and takes his exit.
"Did she turn you against me? Did she manipulate you into doing this?" he asks, and John might actually laugh if he wasn't so out-of-the-ballpark furious right now, "I don't have to guess how, since you're generally quite desperate to sleep with any member of the opposite sex that's willing."
," John says, keeping his eyes trained on the enemy. He steps forward, in front of Sherlock, upping the tension.
John looks away anxiously, brows knitted together, all his reservations playing on his face. “What if she hurts you again?”
SHERLOCK: IT DOESN’T.
SHERLOCK: WHY SHOULD I FEEL GUILTY OR REMORSEFUL IF IVE DONE NOTHING WRONG?
The look in his eye is unmistakable in its murderous intent and it dawns on him that he's contending for his life.
SHERLOCK: WHILE I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE ARROGANT SEEING THAT I AM ALWAYS RIGHT AND EVERYONE ELSE IS QUITE PREDICTABLY WRONG, I AM NOT IN FACT ARROGANT AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT.  ISN'T IT SO, JOHN?
“Sherlock every one of those men who saw her ended up
, John- When have I needed to distort the data to impress anyone? You’re the one
, the sullen, irked voice in John's head protests,
Suddenly, out of no-where, it grips him and tugs him down. His arms flash out reflexively in alarm, bringing him back his former position, head above water.
“Why would you change the show? The original won more BAFTA’s than we could show up for. ”
"Which is why I apparently don't have any of my own." and why he had to journey up to John's room to get one, it seems.
Mary doesn’t know to what ‘painful history’ he’s referring, or why he should choose to say he’s indebted to John. “I don’t understand.”
"Oh really. So you'd give her preferential treatment over me? Because she's killed a lot of people, and I don't see
“Maybe you have to kiss him,” she concedes, noting the lack of any response or improvement whatsoever.
He was too perfect. He was too gifted, too talented- and the list went on and on, didn't it? Too principled, uncompromising, fearless, and heaven forbid, brilliant-- far, far too brilliant for his own good. They were all strikes against him, and they added up.
"Lies. Excuses. Rationalizations to justify what you know you're doing is wrong," Sherlock says mercilessly, cutting everything into black and white with a bloody excato-knife the way he does. "Absolve yourself of any wrong doing- blame everyone else- it's the sort of twisted logic any perp would use, John. It's all so stereotypical it's yawn worthy-"
The suspense is starting to become more real now, as he approaches the roof access. He feels the nerves, just barely manageable, dampened down by a clear and set mind. He rests his forehead against the cool metal of the door with the detached alarm and electrocution warnings, and shudders, shivers, at the thought of what he’s going to do. He stares at the handle, traces his finger around it. He presses down and the thrill of it giving way..
"Right," John states, eyes fixed on Sherlock's lifeless form. He’s still in shock. It doesn’t feel quite real.
Sherlock is gazing deep into John’s eyes when he makes the startling confession "I don't think this is waltz," confiding in his partner yet another spectacular deduction.
"No-" his voice breaks despite his best efforts. The distance between them suddenly seems so vast, too vast, and as he feels himself falling to his knees he reaches out for him. It's all wrong, so horribly wrong but he can't think of what to say to undo it.
When he'd said he was meeting the woman, John had not approved. At all.
Two songs in this chapter if you are curious:
“You think, the three of us, are a family,” he concludes, with deliberate slowness.
“Then you eat it,” she suggests, directing him to the plate. Sherlock opens his mouth with a comeback, but realizes doesn’t have a comeback for that. He looks at the toast blandly, then looks at Mary, then back at the toast, which hasn’t moved an inch.
He rolls up his sleeves and decides to set to work on the driftwood several yards downwind on the shore, which he hopes isn’t shipwreck, for the unnerving message that sends anyway.
Sherlock is cracking up, not lifting his face from John’s jumper.
Only when John had said "Yes," back, mistaking his taunt for a real answer, had the smugness been wiped off his face. They both had suffered mild panic attacks after the fact. But all for naught apparently, since other than that he now enjoys some authority over what suicidal maneuvers Sherlock conducts with his life (kind of), and despite him having some difficulty explaining to women how he accidentally married his flatmate, marriage didn't exactly change much.. or anything, really. He supposes if anyone could turn marriage to a sexless, non-committal, virtually nonexistent thing, then it's the irreverent Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock: Just Altoids or the Icebreakers as well?
"What exactly are you trying to prove? The DNA indicated the attacker was male. It was a match for Sorace."
As John journeys back and forth, doing his work, their back-and-forth grows increasingly more frequent, and John supposes it’s not exactly unexpected that the more he looks at the figment of his insanity, the more insane he feels. Contrastingly, he becomes less and less aware of the chaos gradually brewing inside his head at its command, under the orchestration of its glare- that deeply aggravating and transfixing glare, that glare that makes his stomach turn and evokes something craving and possessive in him. It’s beautiful, horribly beautiful. Even the word beautiful doesn’t seem to suffice, it’s more like seductive. Perhaps not in the same way he might consider a human seductive, but that might be because he’s never encountered and human quite so seductive, or possibly even because he didn’t know what seductive
When she finally catches up with him, she processes what he'd said aloud. "So if I understand you right," she muses, parsing everything out slowly, "You think
Sherlock restlessly watches him like that, being insufferable, and can’t stand the thought that it’s his fault. He rakes a hand through his hair, then stands up hastily. He places a hand on the settee, and bends foot beneath him, taking a seat beside his distracted companion.
He starts gleaning through the nearby flora, composed namely of out-fanning palm trees and dense shrubbery. He garners several dead and dormant shrubs, a bundle of shattered bark planks, and a few splinters. He treads back and forth between the shore and the forested terrain until, having expended most of the nearby material, he returns to the beach.
16. IS YOU SEX LIFE IMPERSONAL, TRIVIAL, OR POORLY INTEGRATED?
JOHN: OF COURSE I DO. WHAT EXACTLY IS IT THAT YOU’RE ACCUSING ME OF?
“Where?”
John advances until he meets a final corner that redirects him toward the ballroom again. As he rounds the bend, he can see glimpses Sherlock and Mary through a doorframe several paces ahead, dancing together at the far periphery of the crowd. Sherlock’s broad-shouldered, open-chested posture is prideful and robust, accentuated by the lines of his suit. His long strides span the floor in graceful, deft motion, with a swiftness that ostentatiously brandishes the meticulousness and acuity of mind behind it. His feet take on various, fine-tuned, outcast angles as he steps, glossy, black dress shoes on mahogany. The synchrony is unerringly beautiful-- it's art. He’s completely absorbed by his daughter, whose satin gown whirls at his guidance, spiraling as he turns them round. And then they stumble.
JOHN: COULD BE, IF MY SEX LIFE WERE ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.
Just as he's leaving the club to rejoin his uncouth counterpart at the flat however, he hears the iconic chime of Sherlock's Blackberry and stalls midway in the hall. Then he hears his voice coming from the lavatory. Puzzled, John props open the door to the Men's and discovers him by the wash basin across the room.
The way she usurps space until he's positively trapped with no where else to turn- admittedly, it's a little... overwhelming. Her body language is more forceful than words, domineering and possessive. Every outlandish, overbearing gesture of hers lays claim to him, seeming to mark invisible lines of ownership and possession onto his skin.
John sighs and stands from where he's knelt on the chaotic carpet, approaching to check his injuries, but in the heat of the moment, Sherlock grabs the mail opener next to the upended coffee table and John stills.
rational.
John studies Sherlock's filed fingernails, the way they curl around his glass and the still, placid surface of his tea. Beneath his robe he's dressed in a vest and slacks, day clothes, with no intention of returning to sleep. Lately John hasn't seen him in anything casual or even sleepwear- his appearance was neat, fastidious, in order, all the time.
As he strides barefoot on wet, compacted sand and lapping water, he perhaps irrationally maintains an almost careful distance from greater depths. He sets down beside the debris and collects a suitable armful to carry. He rises to his feet, and takes a few steps before he halts in his tracks. His skin crawls with the feeling that he’s being watched, so he tenuously looks up, trained eyes running over the mountain range of searock.
“I think I’d prefer to choke to death,” Sherlock drawls lamely at the broccoli, fork distrustfully nudging it away, “Think you could help a fellow out?” Sherlock asks John playfully, employing kinky sexual innuendo tactics now, it seems.
"No, no, but if we did, we wouldn't tell you."
“Of course you do. You’ve seen pictures.”
Mary slowly spins around, centrifugal force infusing her wispy layers of gown and with a slight drag, as she gradually reconciles with the reality of her current situation. She has found herself stranded in a positive nightmare.
"This goes beyond anything she could possibly have on you-" he checks himself, realizing that was something of an unwarranted outburst.
Without any warning, Mary kisses his girlfriend in front of him for a seasonable length of time, then leaves the pair of them aghast and wide-eyed as she walks off.
John can't prevent a grateful smile from spreading across his face. "Sherlock-" he says, rising to his feet and feeling like he wants to hug him, despite how he's probably made of thorns and razor blades and bear traps and liquid nitrogen and other sharp, pointy things..
It's a warehouse sized room, however this one is mostly empty. Seems like a waste of energy to keep it refrigerated like this. At the back end he notices one solitary clinic bed accompanied by various medical apparatuses.
Its hand clamps around his ankle and tugs so he falls backwards onto his side, elbow digging into the sand. The fall seems to snap him out of whatever trance he was feeling, and his heart begins to pound in panic. He tries to pull himself further up the beach, straining for purchase, but he's pulled downward into the water, the soil spilling through his grasp. Dark water rushes around him, in his ears, his mouth. Underwater, he claws at the ground as he's dragged deeper, but the sand dissolves in his fingers.
"Oh," is all John can say, not expecting that, of all things, to be the title. It's almost too much of a coincidence to be incidental. Who, in real life, actually wakes up to the cliche of someone playing things like
“What I do know is that you ate eggs for breakfast, washed your mouth with fluoride twice today and-” John rolls his eyes at Sherlock’s mild obsession with his Listerine usage but Sherlock grabs his wrist meaningfully, and John’s attention swivels back to him, “Look!”
“How does that work?” John says, Sherlock’s non-tie introducing itself to John’s crew-neck as his starchy dress-shirt smoothes against John's corded jumper. John’s breathing in blood and formaldehyde masked by disinfectant, and Sherlock’s breathing in disinfectant and latex masked by bleach. John feels the square of nicotine gum lining Sherlock’s breast pocket and the prominence of his ribcage filling out and in, whereas Sherlock feels the buttons of John’s collar shirt beneath the layer of his jumper, lining down to the rectangular sharpness of his belt clasp.
His spine rests ramrod straight against the backboard of the pew, his shoulders squared to a tee, and arms barred standoffishly, rigid in every respect with the exception of the delicacy with which he holds his glass. Now that he’s seated, one trouser leg draped over the other, the seam of his jacket is parted under strain so that a sliver of the oxblood interior lining is visible. Combined with his burgundy vest, tie, and pocketed handkerchief, the whole attire bleeds with hidden red, and seems to betray his true colours.
“I’m not going to leave you," Sherlock silences him, his voice vibrating against John's ear, "I’m not letting you out of arms reach for a good measure, you can be sure of that.”
“That you are to John Watson as John Watson is to jam,” she says, because there’s no plainer way to say it. She walks a few paces from the sofa to his music stand near the window still, glowing silver on their silhouettes.
John knows you're not supposed to blame the victim. But Sherlock is not like most victims. He goes out, actively looking to get assaulted. No matter how he turns it around in his mind it makes no bloody sense.
Though it's been an accident, Sherlock seizes the opportunity to make his escape, but in scrambling to his feet he trips backward on sloughs of carpet.
, he thinks. He shoves the voice of protest to the back of his mind, willing it to behave itself.
The screen flashes, displaying a restricted number.
“Oh.”
“Janine was for a case John.”
“It’s fine. It’s fine.” John assures him, preoccupied, too spread thin to put much effort into making it sound convincing and unhurried.
“That’s so stupid,” she resigns, thudding her temple against his chest.
She guides him to a back door entrance, entering a key code into the security pad to disengage the lock.
He leaves him to retrieve the nearest horse standing by, which belonged to one of the carrying messengers he summarily executed, now lying deceased on the shrapnel-covered floor.
“Be in denial.”
“No he’s not!” John renounces, half laughing at the absurdity.
Mary: Does he even know Wallace?
“Gotten himself a new girlfriend, as it turns out,” he remarks disinterestedly, outstretching his hands with a shrug. He flops down on the shuffled sofa cushions and picks up John’s newspaper, reads the introduction upside-down, then throws it over his head on the vacant portion of the settee, for what little the hell being raised about taxes is worth to him. His legs are tangled over the green, leather curve of sofa arm, and he stares idly at the ceiling, curls a jumble on the leather.
"All their blood work is coming back clean. Get us something else to work with," Lestrade demands, and plods off toward forensics to give them the go.
“Sherlock, I think, I think we should reconsider how we’re going about this,” John is saying, running a hand through his cropped, dark blond hair, “I don’t think that we’re--” He looks up to Sherlock, who is poised silently in his chair, looking straight ahead at the wall.
“That would be too cruel a joke, even for me,” Sherlock says coyly with a self-satisfied smirk, stepping forward, Mary stepping back. A smile betrays her and the purportedly serious topic of conversation, flickering at the edges of her mouth.
has any power over Sherlock, when so rarely does he feel like he has any at all. (How could he, when he can hardly get him to do simple things like eating or sleeping or acting decent or getting him to stop confiscating John's unsuspecting jumpers for the unthinkable, i.e. flammability experiments) But looking at the conviction in his eyes there can be no mistake in what he said.
Sherlock's hand has been left resting on middle C for a fraction of a minute too long, the note hovering in midair, unanswered. There's still something odd in the way Sherlock is looking at him, but Sherlock's eyes slide back to the piano before John can comment, rescuing the hanging note. If it was anyone, anyone but Sherlock, it would've been too weird to write off as normal, but it was Sherlock, and he was... really, really weird.
“Why is it so difficult to imagine, compared to all the crazy ideas in your head?” Sherlock demands rhetorical and aloof and a touch patronizing. His icy blue eyes are scathing and penetrative as ever. It's so vivid.
in a royal flush."
Romantic?
“You don’t know!” John rallies, throwing out a hand, “So for all we know he could be in this room with us right now and we’d be none the wiser!”
“I’m afraid so," John says, finishing a line, "How’s the pain?”
It’s a beautiful day, despite the noise and congestion. It’s been a while since he looked up and saw the sun, not artificial LED lights.
“Is that code for sex?” Mary smirks.
He’d wanted to say.
SHERLOCK: IF I SEEM THAT WAY, ITS ONLY BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THINGS THAT SIMPLY AREN'T THERE.
“That is to imply that I’m not breathing. Which I am, John, I am breathing.”
Their movements are aimless, there’s no organization to it, it’s just purely, incandescently… “Kind of..”
John.”
“Heaven without you wouldn’t be heaven,” John beams, reaching for him, “would it?” Sherlock snatches his hand, keeping it locked almost forcefully. His face is dangerous. Temper, temper.
"There is also the small matter of everywhere he went, bodies started dropping," he says, staying on track, "As you know, he died last Sunday. Heart attack. Then the bodies stopped dropping."
Sherlock doesn’t quite follow.
Once he was himself again, the man had vanished, like something he had imagined. Lestrade had been telling him maybe he should see a doctor, but his first instinct was to tell him he didn’t want John anywhere near this. His next thought was that was a spectacularly odd reaction to have, given he didn't have the faintest idea what John or Mary, for that matter, had to do with any of this. He was hardly sure witch way was up and wich was down at that point.
Sherlock is thinking, calculating, pressing his thin fingers against his temple. Then finally, after a solid minute of John sitting on the edge of his seat, he finally responds.
It’s really starting to come off like a prank call, but it is his voice, the voice John used to play on repeat at odd hours of the night, “
It rings true in the pin-drop silence.
“I’m sorry-“
“Sherlock, you didn’t eat anything,” Mary says puzzled, but Sherlock doesn’t respond as he’s making a beeline to his bedroom in long, brisk strides.
“It does, doesn’t it?” Sherlock mutters, head propped against the arm of the sofa and arms extending forward, tilting his head and the photograph at various angles thoughtfully.
He can’t imagine how he must look with the hideous, longing expression on his face. He glances over his shoulder, confirming Mary is not likely to return for now. Suffices to say that was the last straw.
“John?” Sherlock asks again, touching his face briefly before it twists away, his cheek falling against the leather. He huffs at John’s lack of cooperation.
Upon entering the lobby, he discovers the facility is completely deserted and the power is out. "Brilliant," he says aloud, just what he'd been looking forward to- venturing unarmed into the unsurveilled depths of a creepy, abandoned mental hospital. He hears Mycroft in the back of his head, having warned him against this several times.
"Sixty four," Sherlock corrects, at which Anderson snorts, not subtly stifling a laugh in a weak attempt to act professional. "Sorace is currently wanted on over five dozen international charges, all of which can be attributed to her."
"I should have known," he sighs tiredly, like this whole ordeal was nothing more than a nuisance, an exasperation, a colossal waste of time. "I should have known. It's so obvious now. I was a fool to think of you as anything otherwise."
of it not on the bottom.
Sherlock saunters off toward the back of the room, and crashes on the couch beneath a window of venetian blinds, leaving the adults to exchange pleasantries while he recovers from his latest excursion. His hair flops listlessly over his nose, and his long limbs extend languidly against the leather.
"I suppose, this sort of thing is unbecoming on a man," he mutters.
“Well, we might as well head in, shall we?”
"You really want to know?" He could scream right now. Yes, he really wants to know. He would have thought that much was obvious.
A knock sounds on their living room door, and John discards his paper, hauling himself up to get it. Mary is standing in the threshold, now in slacks instead of a dress as per her usual preference, and a green trench coat. “Oh thank god,” he sighs with relief, “She’s back.”
“Either, you’re the voice in my head that doesn’t want me to die—” John says slowly, so that the words come across frighteningly articulate.
“Sixty.”
“Yes, you,” she says impatiently, drawing his attention back to the conversation.
” the speaker’s voice continues, “
"Captain," he echoes.
“No I..." John starts, then conceeds, his shoulders slumping, "Well, yes."
John has to wonder why Sherlock is being such a prat this morning, considering he just got laid. Not all of London is so fortunate.
"Well I could try to fix him I suppose. But he wouldn't be the same. So I don't see the point," she muses, stroking his hair, taken a seat at the head of his bed. He wishes she wouldn't do that. It's horribly distracting. It feels like she's grinding the shattered remains of what used to be his heart into smaller, splinter-sized pieces with a rusty metal cheese grater.
When John opens his eyes Sherlock is above him, looking quite shaken.
"Give me the Briton," he says in German, "give him to me and I will spare both of you." Knowing his life is at stake, the soldier's brain whirrs to life when he talks, piecing together his meaning from what little German he knows.
“Look, I know that we’ve had a bit of a falling out but you can’t just…”
, but Sherlock proves unfit to balance himself and crumples onto the floor beside him in a giggle fit. John blinks at him in sheer disbelief, until his gaze sours into a petty, jaded glare, unsurprised but not unexasperated. The idiot really got a kick out of that, didn’t he, screwing around with some damaged person’s psychological trauma. Must be like the sociopath equivalent of playing pool.
"I wouldn't put it past them."
“Why would you say that?” she retorts, taking offense, “Of course he’s my father. Always has been.”
"You want me in the same way."
John clambers up the stairs with Sherlock in tow, until they hit the second floor, which forms an outdoor quadrangle of flats that all look the same.
