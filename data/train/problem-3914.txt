He could do it like those people in the movies did. Just lie down in the bathtub and slit his wrists. It wouldn’t take long. Alastair would be out for a few hours, probably out at the shooting range half an hour away to vent his anger. He wouldn’t be back until it would be too late.
They leisurely walked back home and Castiel shivered as he turned up the collar of his trenchcoat. Although the sun was blazing from the sky, its friendliness almost brazenly taunting in answer to Castiel’s sour mood, it was quite chilly. He had started turning on the heat a few days ago. Soon enough he would have to stock up on timber so that he could light a fire in the fireplace in his living room regularly.
“You should tell everyone to bring something to eat.”
Dean let out a shaky sigh, as he sat down on the steps a little off to the side from the entrance, trying to quell the fresh fear wanting to collect in the pit of his stomach again. Alastair was coming. That was good. That was what he had wanted.
Before he could crumple to the ground, Alastair had him by the collar of his jumpsuit against the wall, effectively pinning him there with his taller body. Dean’s eyes widened in fear as Alastair got right into his face, snarling viciously.
An awkward silence followed and Castiel cleared his throat to speak again but Alastair anticipated him smoothly.
“Well, “he answered slowly, and he tried to not let panic seep through his voice, tried to keep the terror at bay. “He’s our neighbour, isn’t he? He introduced himself to us, a few months ago, I think.”
He sighed and closed his eyes, relishing the feeling of frost settling down on his cheeks. As if on cue, it started to snow and he tilted his head back into his neck, letting the snowflakes fall into his face and melt on his skin. A smile appeared on his face as he contemplated how the sky looked very beautiful with the small dots of white falling out of it.
But it didn’t matter at all because at the same time relief flooded through him, so much that he let out the breath he had been holding in one shaky, loud exhale which caused the woman next to him to look at him as if he was crazy.
“You really think so?” Dean asked doubtfully.
Then he remembered. He was at Castiel’s house. In Castiel’s bed.
When they parted again, both of them trying to catch their breath, Castiel’s lips felt tender and swollen. He saw with one glance that Dean’s lips looked just like his felt - pink and moist and thoroughly kissed, and he swallowed at the incredibly erotic view.
“Let me think about it, okay?” she said softly. “I can’t promise anything, but I’d like to think about it for a while. For now, you should just concentrate on diverting yourself. Work some overtime, do some stuff in your garden, something like that. You can come over for a few drinks with Jo and me or we could do movie nights. Whatever you fancy, I’m here for ya, Castiel.”
“But if I could really choose a race, I would go with a Bernese mountain dog. They are just beautiful with the log fur and their colour and they are very friendly too. Our neighbours next door, back in Salem, had one named King Louis and he was simply the best. We used to play and wrestle in our backyard when I was still a kid, I really thought of him as my friend.”
He realized a few seconds had passed in silence again and he shifted to stand up straight, clearing his voice.
“Why?” Dean was dumbstruck.
Suddenly, there were long thin fingers coated in something slick, probing at his entrance.
Castiel gazed up at the tall man who had pulled Dean back a little with what seemed a little too much strength and he felt coldness creep into his heart.
“Of course.”
When it came, it took him by surprise nevertheless. Suddenly, Alastair was right in his face, snarling at him with unconcealed hostility.
The woman’s smile brightened a lot. “Well, why didn’t you say so in the first place? Come in, dear cookie bringer.” And she pulled him inside the house.
A thought entered his mind and his heart started pounding in his chest when he realized that he needed to act quickly. In his desperation, he threw himself over his desk, grabbed a pencil and a piece of paper, and scribbled something on it as quickly as he could. Then he stumbled out of the door, and ran down the corridor, past his startled co-workers, almost slipping on the floor in his haste to get to Dean in time.
“It was my pleasure as well, “Castiel replied sincerely. “Do you want to do this again sometime soon?”
Castiel really tried.
Hence, he usually bit down on his tongue and let Alastair do to him what he wanted to. It usually hurt, his body protesting against the physical strain after having been objected to the beating before. But at the same time, Alastair usually managed to make him feel good. He was intent on making it pleasurable for Dean too, kissing and licking him everywhere, taking control over his body the way he liked to, and Dean let him.
He waited for another short nod of confirmation from Dean before he got off the couch and headed for his downstairs bathroom where he kept his first aid kit. Quickly, almost clumsy in his haste to get back to Dean as quickly as possible, he snatched the kit from a small cupboard. He also washed his hands in the sink, filled a small plastic bowl with tepid water, and grabbed a blister of ibuprofen and a washcloth from his bathroom cabinet.
He heard Alastair grunt behind him, zipping up his jeans which he hadn’t even pulled down in his haste to take his husband.
“Charlie ….” He groaned in exasperation.
Dean nodded quickly and picked up his fork at once. He started to eat, uncomfortably aware that Alastair was still observing him quietly, until he finally reached out for his own fork. He then started their stereo with the remote on the table and at once, the room was filled with the wistful sounds of Bach’s Violin Sonata No. 1, one of Alastair’s all-time favourites.
“Pink Lady, with a little extra sugar and a little extra gin, “Gabriel replied with an exaggerated wink. “Makes the alcohol reach your bloodstream even faster.”
They kissed and kissed and kissed. Time seemed to stop. It was only them, the two of them alone, wrapped around each other, and Castiel was sure had never felt happier in his entire life.
Castiel tried to interrupt him but Dean just glared at him, having worked himself up into a steadily increasing state of agitation.
She smiled as if really happy that he was willing to put his trust in her and she grabbed his arm eagerly.
The corners of his mouth curled up in a fake smile. “I’m calm, “he said in a low voice. “Now talk.”
Silently, Dean berated himself but forced his face to stay still as well. After a quick automatic turn of his head towards his husband he turned it back straight forward and waited.
“There’s nothing to be ashamed of, alright, Dean? I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable. Please, if it’s not too much...would you lie down on the bed for me? I would like to take a look at your ribs now if you don’t mind.”
“So, “he said, and he cleared his voice. “Next Tuesday?”
“Right, “Castiel said with a small voice.
He cried and cried and some voice in the back of his mind told him this was embarrassing, that he should pull himself together. But another voice told him this felt right, he needed to let it all out because it was weighing heavily on his heart and talking about it, crying about it, made it feel a little better somehow.
Dean’s head whipped up with fresh fear and Castiel’s panic level kicked up a notch. Shoshanna whined from her position at Dean's feet.
“I’m glad that you came to me, Dean. So unbelievably glad. You did the right thing. I’m proud of you.”
It was almost poetic.
“You tell me what you want. I can still go. Or we could talk. Which I would really like but I don’t want to pressure you. Please, you just say what happens next.” Castiel looked at Dean with open sincerity and he was indeed determined to leave the second Dean told him to.
But just as soon as he had taken that first cautious sip, there was a knock on his door. Irritated, he glanced at the large clock on the wall.
There was no way of knowing, and Castiel gripped the sink hard, steadying himself, the torment of ignorance tearing him up inside. It was almost too much to bear and he was seconds away from calling the police despite the fact that Alastair was the Chief of Police in Medford. Maybe he could find another high-ranking officer who would believe him. Maybe he could persuade them that their colleague was a foul, despicable human being who beat his own husband on a regular basis and who needed to get arrested by them immediately.
He opened his laptop on the coffee table in front of him and opened Google. He typed “Dean Christensen Medford” and looked at the results. As he had hoped he found the website of the local music school which had listed a Dean Christensen as one of their employees. Guitar, bass and singing were listed as Dean’s subjects.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh? Okay? Did she tell you her name?” Amanda shook her head apologetically and Dean was a little confused. Who wanted to speak to him so badly? But then he realized the answer was probably very easy. It could only be a mother of one of his students, maybe to talk about the upcoming concert.
He settled his head upon his arm drawn up on the pillow behind him and found himself staring at the ceiling once again. It seemed this was his destined position for the next few weeks to come. Staring at the ceiling. Lost in thought, always thinking of the same damn thing. The same …. person.
“I know I shouldn’t.” Castiel sighed again. “I know if a friend of mine would ask my advice on this kind of situation I would tell him or her to stay the heck out of it. To just let it be.” He stopped and smiled when he saw Charlie nodding dramatically to his words.
“I know you feel it, too, Dean. You know there’s a connection between us.”
Google maps told him the way to the next store and, after whistling loudly for Shoshanna, Castiel jumped into his car and drove there straight.
But he knew that wasn’t true. Dean was gone and that was the horrible truth.
“Well, what was I supposed to do? I don’t know what flavour’s your favourite and you shouldn’t eat anything but your favourite kind of ice cream when you’re feeling down. So I brought everything I had in my freezer which was quite a lot, lucky you. I also don’t know the extent of your feeing low so it’s better to be safe than sorry, right? Nice PJ’s by the way.”
“Dean.” Alastair looked down at him with a chilling, admonishing smile. “Hush, dear. Do you want the neighbours to think we’re quarrelling at the doorstep? Come in.”
Impatiently he waited for her reply, suppressing a shiver as the rain drizzled into his neck. After a few minutes, she still hadn’t replied, and he noticed in frustration that she hadn’t even read his text. That was very unusual, usually, she replied within seconds. Of all the days for her to stray off course …
“Gay, too. Yes, Dean.”
He turned to Gus, who was waiting for his diagnosis and instruction as to how to proceed.
The wind howled through the trees and Castiel realized suddenly that it was getting cold. It was getting late, too, Dean should better go home soon, he realised with sudden worry.
“Okay, they all seem nice from what you describe, “he said eventually, “is there anyone I should avoid? You know witchy old ladies who’ll throw their cats at me or something like that?”
He made a step forward and extended his hand to Dean who hesitated only a second, then shook Castiel’s hand.
“I ended my shift earlier today. Thought I’d surprise you, “Alastair’s voice remarked casually. “I guess the surprise is on me.”
Dean simply shrugged and hung his head. Castiel shifted a little and placed his hand over Dean’s very softly. The other man flinched ever so slightly but he didn’t take his hand away.
“Hey, Castiel, it’s really no problem, I’m not made from sugar, so don’t worry about it, “he said and shrugged.
“Hey, “Castiel muttered softly, as he braced himself on the edge of the bed and cupped Dean’s face, gently forcing him to move it, so that he would look at him.
“Can I ask just one question, though?” Castiel piped up again and Dean’s shoulders tensed once more. “Why did you not want to have coffee together in town? You said you wanted to explain that to me…?”
He opened his backpack and piece by piece retrieved quite a lot of food or containers with food. Dean’s eyes widened as he saw how much Castiel had brought: fresh bread, already cut, as well as three different kinds of cheese and ham. Tomatoes, olives, cucumber, salt and pepper. One box contained a generous portion of Castiel’s home made fruit salad, another contained his favourite kind of espresso brownies, also homemade. He had also brought a few pieces of his blue cheese quiche, leftovers from his lunch yesterday, as well as water and coffee in two separate thermos flasks.
Just then, Dean stumbled around the corner, hurrying to where Castiel was with a panicked look on his face.
He actually had a little bounce in his step as he entered the practice’s staff room. Alex sat at the table with her sandwich half-eaten and she glanced at him with surprise.
Dean blushed with the praise. “I’m glad you like it. I’ll do it like this every time then, alright?”
“Do you and Castiel Novak know each other?”
He continued to study Dean in silence, desperately trying not to stare, as he struggled to find the right words to say. If he said the wrong thing now, he could ruin it all, and in consequence, hate himself for the rest of his life.
Overcome with sudden red-hot rage he threw the phone across the room where it landed against the wall, shattering into several pieces. His hands clenched into fists at his side and the muscles in his jaw twitched angrily as he paced his living room, drawing a trembling hand roughly through his hair.
They sat in silence for a few minutes. Charlie kept throwing the ball for an excited Shoshanna who didn’t seem to tire at all. Castiel closed his eyes and tried to enjoy the sunshine on his face, to just forget about everything for a few seconds to enjoy the moment. It was summer, he had a wonderful job, it was great here. He had a good life.
His day at work didn’t get better. His growling stomach gave Meg and even Garth reason enough to tease him even more than usual and he snapped at them until Meg had mercy and gave him one of her chocolate granola bars to appease his desperate stomach. The patients were moody, Alex was snippy because he had barked at her right after his first patient and he even managed to get himself peed on by a terrified Siamese cat named Fred after lunch time.
For a moment, Castiel panicked when he realized he had neither showered nor bothered to dress himself. Instead he was still in his shirt and pyjamas and his hair was a total mess. He rushed into the bathroom to at least brush his teeth and he had just finished when the doorbell rang.
He swallowed, wishing he could say what he really felt but he was afraid that this would be too much for the younger man right now. That they would do more harm instead of something good. So he pressed his lips together and kept quiet.
Dean obeyed and he drew in a sharp breath as Castiel’s hand carefully wandered along his side to the angry red bruise in the form of a footprint on his back, just over his left kidney.
He looked up to look at her in disbelief. “Yeah, of course. Why wouldn’t I be?”
Startled, Castiel looked up and was surprised to see Dean standing in the doorway. He was dressed in a simple white shirt and a jeans, and he held a bottle of white wine in his hands. He looked at Castiel with a shy smile while his whole body betrayed his nervousness. For a second, Castiel’s heart stopped. Again.
Ahhhh....
It was over. For now.
Before he realized what he was doing, Castiel grabbed Dean’s arm and spun him around, effectively stopping him from leaving through the door.
So he simply said, “I understand, Dean.” Dean smiled back at him in obvious relief.
“Okay. Is there anything else you need right now?”
Dean stared a little at him then seemed to realize he had made a joke and he chuckled nervously. “Oh well, I think that was a wise choice”, he said.
She gestured with her hand impatiently. “Yes? Go on.”
Castiel nodded as he shifted his gaze from Alastair to Dean who had fallen silent since Alastair showed up.
‘Say yes to the dress’ started and Castiel felt a lot better than he had at the beginning of the day, even though the dull ache in the pit of his stomach remained as steady as the rays of the sun kept shining through the windows of his house.
Dean blushed again and Castiel restrained himself from sighing in happiness. He could watch Dean blushing forever and not get tired of it. He shook his head to clear it and clapped his hands together.
“Yes, but he didn’t. And after a couple of days, I couldn’t take it anymore, I texted him, asking him to meet me. But he texted back, saying we couldn’t see each other anymore. I was so shocked, I just got in the car and drove to the music school where he works. I had to see him and ask him what was wrong.”
“Yeah, I’m on my lunch break, you see, and I was quite in a hurry because I wanted to spend it with my new partner, Dr. Alex Lindt, I think I’ve told you about her? Well, I forgot my lunch on my very first day, so she suggested I come here and buy something real quick so that’s what I did but I really wanted to hurry so my lunch break wasn’t over when I was back so that’s why I turned that corner so quickly….”
The man belonging to the hand stepped out of the clouds.
He opened his eyes again. “N-no, we haven’t talked, Alastair. You’re right, he seemed nice.”
His husband was sitting in the big armchair in the corner and Dean tried not to think about the creepiness of him sitting here in the dark because the light was indeed turned off. The moon was shining through the window behind Alastair, drawing a large shadow in front of him, which only increased the creepiness of it all.
“Hello, Dean.”
Dean tried to protest again but he was unable to speak as the fingers now squeezed with full force. His eyes widened as he realized that he couldn’t breathe at all and, breaking into a full-blown panic attack, Dean began to struggle desperately. His hands clawed at Alastair’s hand around his throat, but he couldn’t even move it an inch, and his chest jerked violently, as he tried to squirm out of his husband’s brutal grip. Naked fear washed over him like a tidal wave. He didn’t want to die. This couldn’t be the end.
Dean shuddered, then he winced as the third digit entered him and he reminded himself to relax. It would hurt a lot more if he didn’t. He had done this so many times, he could do this.
He stopped in front of Castiel, trying to catch his breath. On instinct, Castiel reached out and placed his hand on Dean’s shoulder, trying to soothe him.
“Oh, but you did, “Alastair said with a huge mocking smile plastered on his face. “I have a device in my car which always tells me when someone exceeds the speed limits. It never lies. You were speeding, Mr. Novak.”
A knot of suppressed pain twisted inside him and he winced as he tried to shove the growing feeling of uneasiness away. What good was it to think about Castiel? It was absolutely stupid to do so, they would never ever talk again but still his brain kept reminding him of the man whose ‘friendship’ he would have given anything for. They had never gotten their chance at anything, and he couldn’t help the despair welling up inside him once again. It happened frequently, every day, and he was sick of it, he really needed to distract himself, do something useful with his time.
He sighed and ran a hand through his damp hair. What a pathetic sight he was, wandering around in the fields outside just because he didn’t have anything interesting going on at home.
“You got it.”
Here he was now, two and a half hours later and his stomach suddenly made itself known, growling loudly in the silence of the garage. Chuckling to himself, he rolled up from under the car and looked at the clock hanging at the wall of the garage: it was half past six.
“Don’t let me catch you speeding again Mr. Novak.”
“I’m sorry, “they both said simultaneously, then they laughed.
He winced a little as his back grazed the railing as he turned but he bit down on his lip.
He hesitated. He didn’t know her apart from that one time and it seemed a bit much to confess the reason for his melancholy to her.
“You really don’t need to do that!” he almost yelled as he turned back toward her, and she flinched in surprise.
He really didn’t. Even though it was getting cold and wet, he dreaded going home. He would be lonely and without anything interesting to do. He had already done all the reports for work that needed to be done, he had also taken care of the weekly shopping the day before. There was no basketball tonight and Garth was out on a date this evening, so he was unavailable for a round of squash.
“Right. I’ll just get myself ready, give me one minute.”
Castiel tried to clean the cut amidst the darkly bruised area, but judging from the sharp hiss and the way Dean’s face contorted it was very obvious his touch was causing Dean too much pain.
It was bound to result in another disaster. He should have known but it was as if he was the most stupid person on the planet. He had experienced this many many times but every time he thought it would be different and he had thought it would be different this time too.
Dean nodded. “Yes, I work part-time as a music teacher at the local music school. It doesn’t pay very well, but I love working with children and teenagers. I love showing them how to develop their talents, showing them how to elicit the most beautiful sounds from this beautiful instrument they hold in their hands.”
Castiel didn’t reply, the words stuck in his throat. He was so angry, he could barely control himself. He almost jumped when Alastair suddenly barked at him.
Pure, uninhibited joy.
“I’m sorry! Oh God, Dean, I’m sorry!”
Castiel’s hands instantly clenched into fists and he hastily hid them underneath his thighs.
He added that last part nervously, it sounded a little strange, but he didn’t want to suggest Dean spend time with him if his husband was home, that could be awkward.
“That’s great, “Dean said at once, and now he was looking up, a hesitant smile curling around his lips, causing Castiel’s heart to flutter uncertainly. “So he’ll be okay?”
He opened his eyes and there was so much anguish in them that Castiel almost acted without thinking, just holding himself back from pulling the other man into his arms, because he needed to do something to wipe the unhappiness from this sad, beautiful face.
By the time his meal was ready, he was already feeling better and was starving for some hot comfort food and some nice cocoa, maybe a good read afterward. He shouldn’t condemn himself to spend his evenings in misery, at least not all of them.
Alastair stilled beneath him, then he pulled Dean down against his chest. Once again, his mouth covered Dean’s, this time without any involvement of tongues, as his lips brushed over Dean’s tenderly, teasingly.
Tony certainly was cute and Castiel tried to imagine him writhing underneath him, eagerly arching up into Castiel’s mouth …. exchanging hot wet kisses as their bodies aligned and rubbed against each other with intimate passion and an effortlessness that left them both breathless and moaning with need.
His eyes went wide with horror when Dean started sobbing uncontrollably, his face buried in Castiel’s shoulder, and for a moment he was at a loss at what to do. But then he caught himself and he started speaking to Dean in a soft, comforting tone, stroking his shaking back soothingly.
“Dean, please listen to me, “Castiel said quickly, “I assure you. Nothing has changed. I like you and I want to get to know you better. What has just happened hasn’t changed anything. I’m just worried about you. I just wish I knew why you were so upset so suddenly.” He tried to make eye contact with Dean again, but Dean avoided his gaze.
“I-I’m ready, “he groaned, and Alastair hummed in appreciation.
There was no answer and the silence was deafening to Castiel’s ears.
After gulping down the air greedily, Dean settled back into Alastair’s lap, forcing his breathing to slow down. His heart continued to pound frantically inside his chest. Dean’s hand was clinging to his husband’s knee, he then realized, his fingers gripping into his trousers almost violently and he quickly relaxed them lest he get punished for that unconscious motion as well.
“Good?” she asked, smirking as she studied his face.
“Can I help you with that?” a quiet voice next to him asked.
She nuzzled against him in reply and he chuckled softly. “You’re such a good girl, “he said, and he stroked her face gently.
And suddenly, he couldn’t hold himself back anymore. It was all too much, the connection between them too fragile. It could be over any second now, but Castiel needed something to make this real for him, something to make Dean see the truth. Everything he was feeling for him.
Dean didn’t say anything, he was just too exhausted and worn out. He felt Alastair slip out of him and he winced at the uncomfortable feeling.
“Please, Castiel.” Dean was looking at him in earnest now and there was a desperateness in his tone that made Castiel’s hair on his neck rise up. “If I mean something to you, even a little bit, you will respect my wish. It’s only for your own safety that you do. Please, will you promise me not to contact me again? To stay out of my way?”
He gently brushed his thumb over the darkening bruise on Dean’s cheekbone, grimacing when Dean once again winced underneath his touch.
“So, “Castiel said, to get their attention again, “are the other neighbours around here just as nice as you two?”
“Thanks very much.” Castiel smiled again and she left.
Dean tried to take a step back but realized he couldn’t as his back hit the wall behind him. Cain’s arm sneaked upward, steadying him against the wall, as he leaned into Dean.
They stood in front of each other, both a little embarrassed und uncertain about how to proceed. But then the woman regained her composure and she grinned at him sheepishly.
He shook his head in angry frustration and bit down on the nail of his thumb to distract himself.
“Anything.”
The wind blew cold into his face and he wrapped his arms around himself, shivering in the darkness.
Suddenly, it was eerily quiet in the house.
“Hmm.”
Instead of sitting back into the chair he leaned forward and got something out of the big drawer at the side. Dean saw it and swallowed despite himself.
So he decided to stop fretting and just cut the cord. He would cherish the memory of Castiel forever in his heart, the short times they had spent together. But he would stick to his decision and try to avoid meeting the other man. He would turn the other way if he happened to stumble into him in the supermarket or anywhere else. It wouldn’t be easy because Medford wasn’t that big of a town, but it wasn’t exactly tiny either, so there were ways to avoid each other.
“Wait, we just have to find a way to incriminate Alastair, right?” She looked at him in sudden excitement.
All he knew was he was hurting inside, hurting bad, and he didn’t know how to bear the pain any longer.
“What’s wrong with you, Clarence?” Meg asked him in the middle of their shift on the third day of his bad mood. “Did someone dump your pretty ass? Has your boy toy not been nice to you?”
Just a few hours ago, Dean would have said no. He would have embraced the possibility of death, of his life being over. He was intelligent enough to see that he was in constant danger of being hurt physically up to the point where it was not improbable that he would one day be beaten to death. Or strangled. There were other possibilities but he couldn’t think of them now. The fact was that he was playing with fire by being with Alastair. It had shaken him, realizing this a few months after the wedding. He had been in denial, told himself that Alastair would change, that he would try to be better. That’s what he always promised, didn’t he? But at some point, he had resigned himself to the bruises and the broken arms and the welts on his back. Alastair still loved him and that had been all that had mattered in the end.
That’s when the door suddenly opened. In sudden panic, Castiel decided to hide in the tiny space behind the now completely opened door and he held his breath as he heard Dean speak.
Instead, Dean kissed Castiel.
He got Dean his cup of tea and Dean sipped it gratefully. The shivering had stopped, and the timid anxiousness from before had vanished. In its place, fatigue was making itself known, the exhaustion practically seeping out of his beaten body.
Dean calmly put the phone down on the sheets, resting his head on the pillow.
Dean was looking right at him. He was just as shocked as Castiel, it seemed. Their eyes met from one end of the large room to the other and for one second, time seemed to stand still. Castiel couldn’t breathe, couldn’t tear his eyes away from that man who must have bewitched him somehow because how could someone he barely even knew have such power over him?
“There’s just no way, it can’t be done.”
“Thanks, Alex. I really owe you one. Sorry for the inconvenience.”
But then, out of nowhere, he heard a small whine. He froze and turned his head to the right to where he thought the sound had come from. He heard nothing then and he wondered if he was hallucinating already. Maybe hypothermia was already starting to take its toll?
“Thank you, Castiel, “Dean eventually whispered with closed eyes, his voice hoarse and on the edge of breaking. “Thanks for saving me tonight.”
Cain’s lips opened slightly, and he nibbled at Dean’s hand teasingly. “Come on, sweetheart. Let me take you out. I promise I’ll make it worth your while…”
Castiel closed his eyes, trying to shut Dean’s voice out because he didn’t want to hear it. He didn’t want to lose Dean, he didn’t want them to stop seeing each other. He had barely managed to get by on the days that he didn’t have contact with him. How was he supposed to cut him out of his life know, knowing what he felt for him? There had to be another way, there had to be a solution for this.
Then Alastair kneeled in front of him and gently cupped his face with his hand, ignoring the way Dean flinched away a little on instinct.
“I’m sorry, baby. I’m sorry this happened to you. My temper may have gotten the best of me. But you know how you always trigger me. You know that darling, don’t you?”
“Hey there, little lady! How are you, beautiful?” He crouched down and petted the happy dog with obvious enthusiasm, a huge grin on his face. He petted and cooed and pressed his face against Shoshanna’s snout and it was such an adorable sight that Castiel caught himself staring at them with an open mouth. Dean was beautiful and intriguing and he obviously loved dogs – could he be even more perfect?
“But you know it’s not that easy, Castiel, “he continued slowly, and all thoughts of butterflies evaporated from Castiel’s thoughts. Dean gazed at him with an expression of utter sadness. “I’m married, you know that. I can’t just ignore that.”
“Hang on, buddy, “Dean said, swallowing down the unbidden lump in his throat, determination making him grip the wheel hard as he started the car. “I’ll get you to safety and you’ll be just fine, I promise.”
“W-well, I don’t know, “Dean eventually stuttered, suddenly nervous again, “I was always that way, a little shy, a little awkward, I – I guess it didn’t go away when I got older. I’m sorry.” He put his glass on the table a little too abruptly and a few drops of wine spilled on the table. Dean jumped out of his chair at once. “Oh God, I’m so sorry!”
“You’ll be alright, sweetheart, “he said quietly. “I know you will.”
The expression on Dean’s face was soft and sincere as he looked at him. A lump in Castiel’s throat suddenly made it hard to breathe and he tried to steer his gaze away from the wide, glistening eyes focussed on him but found himself unable to. They ended up staring at each other in the heavy silence of the room and suddenly Castiel’s heart was beating in his throat, tiny beads of sweat collecting in the back of his neck when he saw a flush spreading on Dean’s cheeks and throat, but still, he just couldn’t look away. Dean swallowed and Castiel’s eyes were immediately drawn to his throat, the bobbing of his Adam’s Apple, the exposed skin of his beautiful pale throat.
She handed him his spoon with raised eyebrows, and he took it, firmly deciding not to think about Dean at least for a little while.
“And this?”
“Ouw!” His hand flew to his throat and he was relieved to find no blood there. That would be difficult to conceal – wearing a scarf with 100 degrees outside would raise a lot of unnecessary questions.
“Nah, “Castiel replied. “Some peace and quiet will do me good for now. But I promise, as soon as you two are gone, I’ll take a tour and introduce myself to the neighbours, get to know the people here. I’m sure I’ll find some new friends here.”
They packed the leftover food into the containers and into the backpack again. As he folded his blanket Castiel felt sad that their time together was almost over again. It seemed time had just flown by, he could have sat here with Dean all evening without noticing the moon appearing in the sky.
And Dean turned, opened the door once more, and left without another word. Castiel looked after him, his mouth hanging open as he frantically searched for something he could do short of tackling Dean to the ground there and then and forcing him to stay.
“Haven’t you been reading that for almost ten days now?” Alastair asked with a raised eyebrow. “It’s not very good then?”
“Has Alastair been violent before that incident?”
“Oh, s-so you’re…”
“Are you sure?” Alastair asked calmly as Dean’s legs twitched on the sofa, beginning to fight against the lack of oxygen in his blood. “I’d understand the temptation. Marriage gets boring after a while, doesn’t it? It’s nice to get some attention from the outside. From someone nice, like that Castiel. Wouldn’t it, Dean?”
“Dean?”
He suddenly felt empty inside.
Dean would have loved to have Charlie over, but in the end, he claimed their house was not tidy enough because he wasn’t able to do any cleaning with a sprained wrist. It was a ridiculous excuse and Charlie kept pestering him for days until she eventually gave up. Her texts still came in, but she had a job too and in the end, he was as hopelessly alone and depressed as before.
If he continued like this, he would maybe need a shrink soon.
The whine came again, a little louder this time, and now Dean was sure that it belonged to a dog. It sounded as if it was hurt, crying out in pain and all thoughts of his own misery vanished instantly.
“Yes, you’re lucky you’re allowed to bring your dog to work.” Gabriel said.
“Yeah, I am.” Cas sighed. “Hopefully not for too long, I’m just not the type who likes to be alone a lot.”
He kept petting the dog with one hand while he systematically checked its body for injuries: flanks, back, paws, neck, head. There was an open, nasty-looking wound on the dog’s right flank, but luckily, no artery had been hit - if it had, the dog would have bled out on the spot.
It was all too good to be true and Dean should have known that it wouldn’t last forever.
Immediately, a wave of pleasure rolled over his body and Dean moaned obscenely, completely overwhelmed by this unexpected feeling.
Dean was ranting again but Castiel didn’t care. He was still shaking Dean’s hand and enjoying every second of it. His skin felt so soft and warm and he wanted to pull Dean into his arms and touch his face to see if the skin there was as soft. He heard Dean talking but he could hardly concentrate on the words as he was mesmerized once again by the green in Dean’s eyes, clouded over by emotions he could not read. Was it fear? Embarrassment?
He smiled shyly at her. “That’s nice.”
She nodded in relief. “Great, okay. Let me just find Jo and we can leave.”
“Well, see you Thursday, Jonathan, take care, “Dean said, his voice deep and friendly.
“Okay, I’ll hurry, “he told her and true to his word he hurried outside, Shoshanna following him as usual.
“How does next Wednesday sound for you? “she asked.
“Gabriel. He wants to meet up at a club.” He sent his last message and tucked his phone into the pocket of his pants.
“Ohh, that’s so sweet.” Charlie said. “You will find that special someone, for sure. I’ve never thought I would find someone special until I suddenly did, and it hit me out of nowhere.” Jo turned to her and they exchanged a short but affectionate kiss.
“You know, ‘bro’, “he shouted into his brother’s ear, “just because I’m gay doesn’t mean I drink gay drinks. A beer would have been fine.”
, he thought.
When he looked back up though, Dean wasn’t alone anymore. Alastair was with him, his long arms snaked around Dean’s back as he held him close.
“I’m ready, Sir.”
“Alastair, “he almost sobbed, “please ...”
Castiel stared at him, for a moment absolutely speechless. He resisted the urge to raise his hand to Dean’s face to stroke his cheek in comfort.
“I’m sorry, I couldn’t help myself. I had to contact you, I wanted to spend time with you so badly.”
“Good to know!” Castiel said with an eye roll but soon enough it was replaced with a stupid smile as indeed the alcohol was slowly getting to him, a buzz slowly spreading through his body, making him feel loose and relaxed. It was nice and he quickly drained the rest of his glass. He gestured for Gabriel to follow him to the dancefloor and together they started to dance to the rhythm of the music.
“So you haven’t really talked to each other? Gotten to know each other, on your way to work maybe? He seemed a nice enough guy when he showed up at our doorstep, with his self-made cookies and everything. That’s not something everybody does.”
“Alright. I’d like to check nevertheless, okay?”
Good. It seemed they could finally leave.
A glimmer of hope sparked within his chest when the disbelief in those dark-green eyes gave way to something akin to joy.
He couldn’t help himself, he buried his face in his hands as if to shut the world outside for a few moments, to be alone in his frustration. Shoshanna jumped unto the couch next to him and laid her head on his knee to show him her compassion.
“Charlie …. What …. How …. who’s supposed to eat all that?” He gestured at the ice cream helplessly, looking at her as if she had gone mad.
Castiel decided he would get to know the Christensen’s better. Although they were a couple he felt as if something wasn’t right between them. And even if he wasn’t right – he still wanted to get to know Dean. Dean himself had seen interested in him although of course he was quite shy. Well, he would make it his goal to lure Dean out of his shell, territorial husband be damned.
“I told them I was mugged, “Dean said quickly and Alastair’s eyes flashed with relief. “That I was out on a late-night stroll and didn’t notice where I was going. That I ended up in a bad end of town where I was mugged and beaten. They believed me.”
That thought stung, although Castiel theoretically knew that he hadn’t done anything to make Dean fear him. But Dean wasn’t able to think rationally right now and who could blame him, after what he had gone through, apparently? Castiel needed to show him that he had nothing to be afraid of and that he had made the right decision by coming here.
“I said leave me alone!” Dean repeated, although Cain had stepped away from him. He was shaking all over, heat creeping up inside him, and he hated himself for his weakness, on display for this handsy stranger. Even though Alastair wasn’t here, he felt his presence right here with them. He almost couldn’t get himself to breathe, and he knew he had to get away from here.
There were several new messages. From Alastair of course.
“Good morning, I’m Doctor Novak, “he said as he entered, his eyes still glued to the report he was scribbling on. “I treated the dog you brought in. It was a good thing you found him, you probably saved his….”
Listen to Simon & Garfunkel's beautiful "Bridge over Troubled Waters" to know what it's all about, preferably the album version from 1970, sung by Garfunkel. There are jazzier, more recent versions, sung by Simon, but I wanted the original piano version for this scene. I don't know if Dean (=Jensen) would be able to sing this, but he seems to have an incredible range so I just hope it fits :) He's such a great singer and this needed to be included into the story.
“But …. Dean, you cannot simply end it like this!” Castiel was scared now, he didn’t want this to happen, but he didn’t know how to stop it. He was on the verge of stepping forward to shake the insanity out of Dean, but he held himself back, as he realized that would probably be more counterproductive than helpful.
“Now, you’re intention was good at least, so you’ll get some bonus points for that, I guess.” Alastair turned back and now his eyes were looking at Dean coldly.
“I’m sorry, Shosh, “he murmured, and he patted her head affectionately as they slowly walked down the huge meadow in front of the roads leading up to the suburban area he lived at. “I simply don’t feel like going home just yet.”
He waited patiently and Dean finally nodded. When he moved to pull the jacket from his shoulder he winced and grimaced in pain. Castiel longed to do it for him, but he didn’t dare touch him yet. Dean looked like a deer caught in the headlights, any loud sound or quick movement would scare him away, and Castiel could not let that happen.
“Dean, “he said, desperate to make his voice sound calm as he stayed where he was, conveying to Dean that he was no threat. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have done that. It just …. makes me so angry that he’s hurting you. I-I would never hurt you, Dean. Okay? Do you believe me? I would never be able to hurt you, I’d hurt myself before I would hurt you.”
The song ended and the audience burst into applause. Castiel realized he had tears in his eyes and he hastily wiped them away with the back of his hand. Dean was smiling self-consciously, and he quickly waved Kyle forward to receive his applause. A huge smile spread on Castiel’s face and he jumped up from his chair to with everyone else, clapping his hands like a madman. The audience was cheering and crying for an encore, but Dean just shook his head with a small smile as he clapped a hand on Kyle’s shoulder, pushing him forward with clear intent. Kyle beamed and bowed until the disembodied voice spoke up again and announced the next performer. Dean and Kyle left, everybody sat back down, and Castiel found himself staring after them, wishing he could just run after him, talk to him, past agreements be damned.
It was easy to lose himself in the beat and for once his head was filled with sweet nothingness. He didn’t care for anything but being in this moment, having fun, letting himself go. He swayed back and forth and startled to giggle when he saw his brother making some absolutely ridiculous weird dance moves, an obvious ploy to make him laugh and sure enough, it worked like a charm.
“You’ll have to hire a gardener for all these flowers and trees, bro. “
Sadness took a hold of him at that thought. He liked Charlie and he had enjoyed their weekly sessions very much. She was carefree, she was fun to be around and he could forget the sorrow that was his life when he was with her. Just like he could with Castiel, but with her he thought it would be okay. Because she was just a friend, nothing else. No danger.
„Wake up, sweetheart. “
During the past beatings he had received Dean had tried to think of nice memories. Of a long-lost mother that had died when he was four years old. Of a younger brother that occasionally like to spend time with him, although they weren’t really close anymore. Of the first few months with Alastair when everything had been perfect, when Alastair had been incredibly gentle with him, he would have snatched the moon from the sky if Dean had asked for it.
“Hm?” Castiel raised an eyebrow, startled out of his thoughts, but he quickly regained his composure.
“He’s a police officer, Cas!” Dean persisted, looking at him with an expression of incredulous disbelief. “He will kill us and no one will ever suspect him. There is no way I can just leave him, don’t you get it?”
Dean’s mouth was pressed into a tight line as he looked at the washcloth first, then Castiel. Something like acceptance flashed in his forest-green eyes and he gave one single nod of permission.
“Well, nobody’s as nice as us, “Jo said with a wink, “but most of them are quite cool, yes. There’s grumpy old Bobby Singer across from us, he always frowns but he has a soft heart, the sucker.”
“This, “Dean whispered, and he brought Castiel’s hand to his lips, pressing a soft little kiss to his knuckles, “this meant so much to me. Thank you, Castiel.”
“Come on, Dean, “Alastair growled as he bit at the base of Dean’s throat, “make it good for me, come on.”
He smiled and kissed her cheek. “Yes, mom, I promise.”
Then he remembered that Alastair wasn’t home, and he almost doubled over in relief. Alastair would almost certainly freak out to see him standing so close to this stranger, getting his hand kissed by him.
There seemed to be no new visible injury on him anywhere and that at least was a relief. Maybe Alastair had not noticed that Dean had left. It was possible. It would mean that Dean had escaped another harsh punishment and Castiel rejoiced silently because who knew what that sick man would have done to Dean if he had realized where Dean had gone? There was no knowing, but Castiel had looked into Alastair’s eyes - he had seen the crazed, almost lunatic glimmer in his cold blue eyes, and he had realized there and then that there seemed to be no bounds to that man’s cruel violence.
“Shhh … I know, honey. I know, “she soothed as she held him in her arms, stroking his back, as he quietly cried into her shoulder. “Let it all out.”
At once, he shook his head involuntarily, which must have looked hilarious to onlooking people if there had been any.
Since that afternoon where he had been threatened by Alastair, Castiel felt like he was constantly walking on the edge of his own sanity. He felt constantly at the end of his tether, annoyed by trifles and getting irritated by everyone and everything around him. Without really knowing why he perpetually found himself yelling at his co-workers and snapping at his patients. Even Shoshanna ended up being the target of his constant scowling and griping, just because she was taking too long to find the right tree to pee on.
His brow furrowed as his thoughts travelled to Alastair, the man Dean apparently was married to.
Castiel eventually squatted down in an effort to calm Dean down. “Please, I’m not taking one more step. Calm down.”
Castiel glared at her pointedly. “You were the one keeping me waiting.”
An angry growl emerged from deep within his throat as he pushed himself against the wall, pressing his head against it with sudden surprising force. He wanted to punch the wall. He wanted to punch someone until they bled. He wanted to smash Alastair’s face in until it was just a bloody pulp, until he was nothing anymore, nothing that could hurt or harm the beautiful person that was Dean. At the image of a crying, desperate Dean scrambling away from him with panic in his eyes, Castiel smashed his fist into the wall with a furious snarl. He punched and it felt good. Once, twice, thrice. Pain flared up in his hand and Castiel relished the feeling. He longed for the feeling, he wanted to drown in it, so he punched into the wall once again and this time it hurt so much, he gasped in surprise.
He could reach it with his arm. Looking at Castiel’s arm wrapped around his waist, Dean shifted cautiously, trying not to wake the other man. He reached for the phone and managed to grab it without startling the man behind him.
. Dean should not be treated like a punching bag on account of
With his help, Dean changed into the clean shirt Castiel had given him and then crawled underneath the sheets, wincing in pain as his body wearily protested against the bending and stretching of battered limbs.
Another kick landed in his abdomen. And another, this time aimed at his kidney. Dean winced in pain, but he bit his lips to avoid making any more sounds, trying to protect his inner organs with his arms as best as he could.
He grinded his teeth angrily and his pace quickened as they entered the street they lived in.
He was useless.
“Dean, what’s going on? You’re freaking me out a little here.”
Dean obeyed and thankfully, his pupils reacted as they should. One pupil was a little bigger than the other though.
Castiel nodded and he took another step towards Dean. “I know, Dean. I know you’re married and when I met you, I swore to myself that I’d never push myself between you and your husband. But I have to admit, it’s been …. difficult.”
Then he stood up and started to walk downstairs. She stood up in her bed, tilting her head to the side, looking at him with her big brown eyes.
Dean was down to the black shirt he had worn underneath the jumpsuit, and the slacks. His face was beet-red, and his head was turned sideways as if he couldn’t face looking at Castiel right now.
Please take note that this is one of the darker chapters! We'll get our first real glimpse at Dean and Alastair's marriage and it's not exactly pleasant.
Castiel just glared at him and Alastair grinned as if he wanted to mock Castiel openly. “Are you aware that you were speeding, Mr. Novak?” he asked casually.
“So, you already acquainted yourself with the area?” he asked as they settled down in the grass on a blanket Castiel had brought with him, at the foot of the willow. “Although you haven’t been living here much longer than I am.”
“Well, Shosh, “Castiel said as he grabbed his keys, “I have to see him, before I change my mind." Reluctantly, he decided not to take Shoshanna with him, he wanted them to talk in peace and didn't want to risk Dean getting riled up by his dog. It could get loud and that would upset Shoshanna too.
“Because I like you, “Charlie sad quietly, “I want to be your friend, Dean. And as your friend, I worry about you.”
Dean smiled at him shyly one last time, said his goodbyes (also one last affectionate cuddle with Shoshanna) and then hurried down the street, not looking back. Castiel was sad they didn’t embrace or at least shake hands and he was sad that their “date” was over.
“Shhhhhh….” Alastair placed a soft kiss on the top of Dean’s head and cradled him in his arms. Dean let himself be held like a small child desperately seeking comfort. Strangely enough, being here in Alastair’s arms really did give him comfort. Having these strong, warm arms wrapped around him gave him a strange sense of security even if these were the arms of the man who had just beaten him bloody. He knew Alastair really loved him and he only wanted to help him be a good person. He knew he was sorry for having to hurt him and he always forgave him for what he did. Dean was simply a person who made so many mistakes, it wasn’t Alastair’s fault. Dean was thankful Alastair was making the effort of caring for him at all.
Somehow, Castiel had managed to get home. He didn’t exactly remember how he had left the woods, reached his car and driven home but apparently, he had because now he found himself lying on his back on his couch, staring at the ceiling. Utter loneliness and despair were lurking somewhere in the pit of his stomach and he was probably on the verge of breaking down, but he felt numb somehow, too, as if his mind still couldn’t completely grasp what had happened today.
Dean was deeply engrossed in his memories now. His eyes glazed over, lost in nowhere as he recalled a friendship that had obviously meant a lot to him. Although it was a long time ago and they had only been friends, or so Dean said, Castiel felt a pang of jealousy for which he immediately scolded himself internally.
It was just one of the many reasons he had fallen in love with that house when he had first looked at it. The fireplace reminded him of home, meaning the magnificent 19th-century Victorian building he had grown up in as a child. He had spent countless hours in front of the gigantic fireplace, losing himself in Tolkien, Jack London, and Stephen King in the luminous shadows of the crackling fire. Later, as a teenager, he had continued to take advantage of the quiet solitude when everyone else in the house was already asleep – meaning his parents and Anna, his older brothers having already moved out. He would love to just lay down on his back in front of the fire and listen to some music on his iPod. On rare occasions, he would even take a boy – or the occasional girl, there and make out with them, enjoying the heat warming his side as he and his partner exchanged passionate touches and kisses. Once or twice, he had been caught red-handed by his father, who had not approved of his juvenile fooling-around at all. He would punish him harshly with house arrest or the removal of his mobile phone for a few days, even though he had been doing nothing unusual as a 16-year old boy in the midst of exploring his own identity, dealing with raging hormones, and confusing feelings.
Dean was exhausted. It had been a long day for him. He had spent the morning doing the shopping, working on his car – his beloved Impala which he had inherited from his father but very rarely drove because Alastair didn’t want him to – and decluttering their attic which had been long overdue. Then he had sped off to work to give lessons – more than usually because they had a little concert coming up and he wanted his students to feel prepared and thus confident.
Dean looked up and saw Castiel’s eyes bore into his with an intensity that seemed to make the other man shiver. But Dean also seemed to realize that Castiel really meant it, so after a he stared at him for a few seconds, his shoulders trembling ever so slightly, he finally took a deep breath and looked at the ground again.
“Ceeeelia, you’re breaking my heart, you’re shaking my confidence daily. Oh, Ceciliaaa, I’m down on my knees, I’m begging you please to come home.”
They talked for an hour or so as they sipped at their coffee. Because Dean asked Castiel told him the story of how he decided to become a vet and how he decided to move to Medford. He didn’t go into many details about his father, just mentioned that they had had “a falling out” and Dean just nodded without inquiring further. Castiel told him about his brothers and sister and about his time at college, about his coming out.
“I saw you, Dean. I looked out the window and I saw you smile at him. You encouraged him. Why would he just touch you like that?” Alastair leaned down and he grabbed Dean’s jumpsuit again, pulling him up right into his face. “So tell me! What did you say?”
He cleared his throat, a little embarrassed. “Uh, I’m sorry, ma’am. D-do we know each other?”
“I mean, “he hastened to say, “would you sleep next to me? I … I don’t think I could sleep alone right now.”
Dean enjoyed the fruit salad and the brownies as well although he admitted to Castiel that his most favourite dessert in the whole world was pie. Castiel resolved he would bake Dean a whole pie just for himself someday and it would be the best pie he had ever made.
Castiel raised an eyebrow at the huge cocktail glass Gabriel was just pushing into his hand. It was filled with a light pink liquid and a small paper flamingo squashed onto the edge.
So I said that this chapter would be from Castiel's POV, obviously, there was a change of plans. But the next one will definitely be Castiel's.
Charlie barely managed to keep him inside the house, pulling at his sleeves, trying to block the door with her small frame, begging him to keep cool until he finally saw reason and dropped down to the floor, burying his head in his lap in defeat.
But as the days went on, he became more and more restless. He was bored out of his mind, sick of watching Netflix or trying to read and his mind automatically returned to the one thing he couldn’t seem to keep away from: Castiel. More specifically, Castiel’s smile. His warm eyes. His soft hands and the way they had felt when they had gently held the cold compress to his battered face or when they had wrapped around him in a soft embrace. The way they had held him from behind, the most perfect thing he had ever felt. His lips. The hitch in his breath when Dean had kissed him unexpectedly.
, he wanted to cry out, but couldn’t because he was sobbing too hard.
“Turn and present yourself to me.”
“Come on, let’s sit down, “she gestured for him to follow her into an old-fashioned but cozy living room with a huge brown couch, huge shelves full of books and shaggy white carpets on the floor.
He left the highway and drove into the city. But just as he reached the end of the first three-laned road, intending to turn right at the crossroad, he suddenly heard a siren go off behind him, startling him out of his self-pitying thoughts.
“I was asking you a question, sweetheart.”
Alastair’s hand reached out once more, and he softly stroked down the side of Dean’s face. He brushed against his cheekbone, and then continued to the soft curve of his lower lip, causing his lips to part slightly. Something flashed in those pale blue eyes as the long fingers circled upwards again to wipe away the tear in the corner of Dean’s left eye.
“Dean, I need you.”
He forced his hand down with his other hand to stop himself from doing it again, as the rage inside him slowly retreated and he began to come back to himself. He let his head drop down between his arms and against the wall, closed his eyes and focussed on just breathing. His chest was heaving with receding anger and exertion of his punches and he forced himself to breathe in and out slow and steady, to completely fill his lungs with oxygen and then let it out slowly, letting it leave his mouth in concentrated, steady exhales.
He walked up the path of his direct neighbour’s house, took a deep breath and knocked. He was dressed in his favourite pair of blue jeans and a simple brown sweater – he hoped he wasn’t underdressed, but he felt like himself in this outfit and he didn’t want to look to formal on his first visit with the neighbours.
They made plans to shop together for meat and beer next Friday, then Castiel said his goodbye. They hugged and Castiel felt he had already formed a bond with her. He expressed his gratitude towards her, but she just shrugged and said “Happy to help. If there’s anything, gimme a text or call, okay?”
After that it all became a bit blurry. Dean was dimly aware of the physical agony and he sensed his body wincing in pain every now and then. Tears were welling up behind his eyes and forced their way out, he couldn’t stop them from rolling down his cheeks, but he still stayed upright. His back was an indistinct mass of pain and blood and he forced himself to think of something different. That was something his brother Sam had told him once, he had learned it in one of his few psychology classes: the best way to endure physical pain or torture in general was to remove the mind from the immediate perception of pain and conjure up the most beautiful memories of your life instead. Let the mind remember something that truly made you happy and the pain would only be half as bad. You could train this method even, the more you did it the better you became.
Surprise and panic spread across Dean’s face and Castiel hated himself for being the cause for that but he just couldn’t think of another way of stopping the other man from leaving. He
“Do you accept your punishment?” Alastair asked.
They broke apart again, trying to catch their breath, their foreheads brushing against each other.
Castiel smiled. “Yes, of course they are homemade, I wouldn’t dare show up at my new neighbours’ doors with cookies from the store. Here, try one.” And he offered his basket to the blonde woman. She eyed him suspiciously as if she couldn’t believe a stranger would offer her homemade cookies without them being poisoned but then she took one of the cookies and bit into it hesitantly. After swallowing her first bite she closed her eyes, sighed with what seemed utmost content and said “Okay, Charles, these ones are the real deal. Test passed.”
“No. Sleep naked tonight, darling, you know how I love to feel you up in the morning when I wake up.”
“Yes, yes, I like it, “Dean whimpered, although the angle was making it hard to keep standing and his head was hurting where Alastair was holding him by the hair.
The drizzle intensified a little and Castiel sighed again at the sight of an unhappy Shoshanna. She looked at him accusingly, clearly wanting to go home. He ignored her and pulled his phone out of his pocket. Somehow, he was being stubborn about this, he didn’t want to go home, and he really needed something to distract him.
“Okay…”
His mouth thinned into a hard line and his resolve strengthened anew as they stepped up to their house. He smiled when Alastair looked at him as he opened the door. He ignored the pang of pain in his chest at the thought of letting Castiel go once again, but he quickly chased the feeling away.
“Castiel, I …. “Dean seemed as unsure and overwhelmed with the situation as he was. “I- I don’t know what I want to do. I didn’t even know I wanted to come here until I suddenly found myself in front of your door. I…I hope it's okay that I went here….”
He stepped behind his house into the backyard. Just like the house itself it was perfect. It was huge: there was a patio at the back of the house with a large wooden table and chairs for people to sit outside – just perfect to enjoy a glass of wine and read a good novel on mild summer evenings. He could also, of course, invite people there for a barbecue – he would just have to find some people he could do that with. There was also a porch swing he just had to get when he saw it on Ebay. And of course, there were loads of potted flowers and vases as well as a space he had already set up for vegetables to grow at. Just like having his own garden he had always wanted to grow his own tomatoes – and now he would.
Dean’s answer came at once.
For a moment Castiel was dumbstruck. He stared at the guy who was, as he then realized, quite attractive: disheveled dark hair, with a stubble, bright blue eyes and a seemingly fit, slim body hidden underneath tight shirt and jeans clinging to him. It was frightening how much he reminded him of a certain somebody, could almost be his twin brother if it weren’t for the much smaller mouth, the wrong eye color and the much broader chest on this guy.
Castiel grinned.
“Snap out of it!” Charlie said jovially as she fell onto the couch next to him. “I think ‘Say yes to the dress’ is on in a few minutes and I’d really like to watch that although it’s the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen, to be honest. You can tell me which wedding dress would suit me the most. Not that I’d be interested in marrying but it would be fun, right?”
How could he go back now that he knew what the alternative could be?
He was shoved back roughly to the ground. Nothing else happened for a few seconds. He just lay there, breathing heavily, blood flowing from his split lip, his eyes almost closed, waiting for the assault to continue. He knew moving now would only bring him more pain.
In front of him stood a slender young woman with brilliant long red hair and an incredibly cheerful expression on her face. She laughed at him as if she were incredibly happy to see him and she held the door open for him in open invitation.
Castiel opened his mouth to ask another question when suddenly Dean was pulled back inside the house a little by someone stepping next to him.
He quickly recovered and straightened himself up. “Alastair, I’m sorry I’m late! I can explain everything to you, please let me ...”
“I’m sorry, “he blurted out. “I don’t know what got into me, but…I swear, I mean it. Everything I said. I…”
Dean’s eyes were shining with bashful hopefulness as he allowed himself to think of the possibility of staying here, then he frowned and shook his head.
“Dean, “he said with a small sigh. “I know this is hard, but...I understand why you went back to him, really, I do. And I swear that I don’t resent you for it. But you cannot go back there again. Please, Dean, you need to understand that...”
“Thanks, you’re making a lifelong dream come true, “she said with a happy grin.
She held his gaze and he almost faltered under the piercing look of her bright green eyes. “You tell me.”
His charming smile vanished as soon as he turned his back on them and his lips pressed into a tight line as he walked up to the exit and, after taking one more single deep breath, opened the door.
Charlie prompted: “He’s a cop.”
“Hey, “he called out loudly, “where are you?”
But he knew she owed him some answers and he would not be kept waiting again like a fool.
“I’ve inherited this house from my grandma when she died.” Charlie explained his unspoken question with a shrug. “It’s old-fashioned I know but we kinda like it so we kept it like that.”
It seemed a good plan. Well, it seemed risky and stupid and far-fetched, but it was a plan and Castiel was eternally grateful that Charlie had taken it upon herself to make this plan. That she would go to such lengths for him – and for Dean – to invest so much of her own free time, to put herself in harm’s way – because who knew how Alastair would react if he ever caught her stealing from him? - it truly touched him. She did it because she was a good person and because she didn’t want Castiel to suffer anymore. This was her way of proving her friendship to him.
Dean continued to stare at all the food in silent wonder so Castiel cleared his voice to get his attention again. “Do you like blue cheese? I know it has a very special flavour and not many people like it…”
“I think you’re right about the sprain. Here, let me put some ice on it, it’s already swollen a little.”
How he would love some peace and quiet right now.
As he approached the beginning of the path where they had agreed to meet, he noticed his heart beating faster again and his mouth felt a little dry. Dean was nowhere to be seen though. He looked at his watch and realized he was a little bit early. He sat down on a big stone, Shoshanna lying down next to him, and began to wait.
“Lilith Cross. She’s my neighbor, she watches my cats when we’re away and she told me about you when I mentioned I would like to learn how to play. She’s one of your students, isn’t she?”
“This is not the biggest town, you know, “Dean began eventually. “If you and I met alone in public people could talk about us and well you know, there could be gossip.” He blushed again. Castiel thought that he probably also didn’t want Alastair to hear about said “gossip”, but he didn’t voice that. It seemed clear to him that Dean was interested in getting to know him, but he was afraid to make an open commitment. He had probably not told his husband that he was meeting Castiel today. He didn’t ask about that either. He didn’t want t frighten Dean away with too many questions, especially if the answers to those questions would seemingly reveal a lot of stuff Dean wasn’t ready to tell him yet.
“Okay, I want you to close your eyes and breathe with me, “he said as he looked at Dean seriously. “Can you do that?”
Castiel was left behind in the silence. The night air was cold and moist, foreshadowing a rainy Sunday morning and overly careful drivers on the streets, should he decide to venture outside.
He hadn’t been mad at Charlie. Not really. Not when she explained to him why she had decided to hire Dean as her guitar teacher. It was her plan to get to know him so she could wriggle her way into Dean and Alastair’s phones and maybe even into their house. They needed information, they needed proof for the domestic abuse and Dean wouldn’t give it to them of his own free will. So Charlie intended to earn his trust and then steal his phone any time convenient and get all the information from it as quickly as possible.
Dean stopped pacing and ran a hand over his mouth, exasperated. “Castiel …. I guess I have to explain something to you.”
The seconds ticked by until Alastair spoke up again. “Do you think he maybe likes you?”
He just couldn’t believe that Castiel would be that selfish. Every action, every touch, every word that had left his mouth since Dean had met him, had been full of kindness and sincerity and compassion.
But then Dean began to sing and everyone and everything around them seemed to fade away. Nothing else mattered, only Dean in front of him on the stage. He hit the notes perfectly and although he had seemed so shy just moments before he seemed confident now, drawing strength from the song he was singing, his back pushed back into a straight line, his posture more confident, his expression determined but still soft. His voice was like velvet, strong with emotion but tender and sweet when it was needed and Castiel felt himself melt away as the song’s chorus sounded for the first time. Dean’s voice rose with the song’s crescendo and Dean’s gaze wandered from right to left as he sang as if he wanted to tell everyone the message of his song, as if he was inviting them to share this beautiful moment with him.
Dean knew a little about dogs as he loved them so much, despite never being allowed to have one himself. He knew how to read a dog’s body language and he could see that this dog was scared, but it wasn’t aggressive. It wouldn’t bite him. When Dean sat down beside him it even wagged its tail a little and when Dean’s hand hovered above his head, it nuzzled into him, seeking his touch. It’s pitiful whimpering almost broke Dean’s heart.
It turned out, it could.
“I-I really don’t … I….” Dean was overwhelmed with this unexpected proposal and didn’t know what to say but that woman apparently wasn’t dissuaded so easily.
“Hm.” Castiel tried to wrap his thoughts around her idea. “But how will we make him ‘lose his face in public’?” Then he realized something. “You don’t plan on making him beat Dean in bright daylight in front of everybody, are you? Because there’s no way I am going to allow that to happen!”
He waved a few more times until Gabriel and Irina disappeared around the corner with their passports in their hands. He sighed and turned around towards the airport’s exit. So this was it. No turning back now.
“Come, sweetheart, “Alistair said softly as he pulled Dean up with him, “lie down on the bed, I will clean your wounds.”
Alastair’s hands were a soft breeze against the hot flush of his skin.
Dean sighed, dormant feelings regret and hurt churning in the pit of his stomach and he swallowed heavily, willing them away. He let his eyes wander some more on the wall of photos to distract himself. At last, it settled on one picture he remembered very well.
“Yes, I know, Shosh, it’s late. I’m coming to bed now.”
Although Alastair had smiled at him and given him a kiss on the forehead, Dean had immediately known that he was on an unspoken time limit, so he made quick work of the few things he needed to get done while trying not to appear too hectic so as not to attract any unwanted attention. He even managed to smile at Kyle on his way out, clasp his proud parent’s hands, congratulate them on the unique talent their son represented.
They reached their destination after only ten minutes of walking. The practice itself was a beautiful white building with a marble stairway and apple trees in the front garden. A large sign with his and Dr. Lindt’s names on them proclaimed the practice’s opening hours.
After breakfast they took off. Because his practice was only a few blocks away they could just walk down there. It was a sunny warm day and Castiel enjoyed the sunshine in his face and the sweet smell coming from the cherry blossom trees all around him. The birds were chirping, and he actually felt the need to whistle as he and Shoshanna made their way down the street. He felt free.
It was driving Castiel mad and he wanted to shake Dean, to make him understand that he was being insane. But he could see that Dean was slipping away from him and he still hadn’t achieved anything by way of getting him away from Alastair. He needed to do something!
Dean was running.
“You really think so?” she asked excitedly as she put down the guitar she had been holding. “I admit, I have been practising so hard and I was getting so frustrated because I kept mixing up the chords!”
Castiel didn’t know what to say to that. It was obvious that there was more to that story, but Dean clearly didn’t want to elaborate and Castiel didn’t want to pressure him too much, lest he scared the other man away again. He discreetly let his eyes rake over Dean’s rigid form, trying to gain additional information from his appearance. Apart from the paleness, Dean did seem relatively fine. There was a faint shadow of an old bruise on his left cheek - it was the one he had shown up with at Castiel’s house all those weeks ago. His lip was fully healed as were his sprained wrist. Even his ribs seemed fine as there was no indication that there had been something wrong with them from the way Dean held himself now.
His eyes flew open at the familiar voice.
Dean smiled as he relieved that memory. He would always remember that evening, he had been so happy then.
He had been very lucky and had not run into the man despite the fact that they lived only a few minutes apart. Maybe Dean was going out of his way to avoid him, maybe it was just fate that they weren’t supposed to see each other anymore. Either way, he was glad. It would have been hell, seeing him, so recent after their ‘falling-out’. The wound was still fresh and after what had happened in Phoenix, Castiel knew that he was still very sensitive about the subject, no matter how ridiculous it all was.
Back in his days at university he would have dragged this man into his bed without asking questions. Although he had always preferred the more stable parameters of a relationship, he occasionally enjoyed the uncomplicated advantages of sharing a passionate one-night-stand with a stranger. Especially if he had gone without sex for a couple of months, he felt himself getting restless and this was an easy way of taking off the edge. Of course, it was extremely important to stay safe and only choose partners that were as reasonable and responsible as him. He had immensely enjoyed being conquered or doing his own conquering, it was fun, and it was easy-going – purely physical pleasures without the emotional complications of jealousy or responsibility.
“Jesus, Gabriel, what is this?! It’s so sweet I swear I’ll get diabetes!”
When he gave her one last pet, nuzzling his face into her furry back, he felt a tiny bit better. Her innocent cheerfulness made him feel as if there was no need to worry, as if he would be just fine. It was a nice thought to have, it somehow lessened his burdened conscience, even if it was only a little bit.
He stayed silent.
“It’s really not necessary.”
“Thanks, Castiel, “Dean whispered and his Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed heavily. His eyes darted over Castiel’s face as if he was searching for something.
As he walked down the street towards his house, his guitar strapped over his shoulder, he couldn’t help but worry about what Charlie had meant when she talked about him seeming sad. All of a sudden out of the blue. Almost as if she had prepared a little speech or something. Very strange indeed.
Their lips met once again and their hands intertwined at their sides as they shared another long deep kiss. It was the sweetest thing Castiel had ever tasted and he was already addicted to it, barely able to control himself from completely losing himself in the sensation that was Dean.
He wasn’t able to help Dean at all.
, he realized with sudden clearness.
A few tiny pearls of sweat rolled down Castiel’s neck as their eyes met and for a second, he thought it was over. Alastair knew everything, knew they had met and that he had declared his love for his husband. He would punish Dean for it, he was sure.
He sighed, rolling his eyes, too. “Seriously. It’s just a little lovesickness, that’s all.”
Just as Dean’s body resigned itself to its fate, just as his vision threatened to fall completely dark, the fingers around his throat disappeared.
“Dean…” he began anew and he tried to ignore the way Dean’s hand tensed in his own.
Dean swallowed heavily but he obeyed at once. He quickly got rid of his shoes and jacket and stepped into the guest bathroom to wash his hands, as were the rules in this house. Alastair walked past him.
Alastair’s voice was a soft breeze against the side of his face, a hot puff of air, a low soothing tone that betrayed the menacing smile on his husband’s cruel lips. Dean couldn’t see it but he knew it was there.
