It's heartbreaking how fast alarm ratchets up on Tony's face. Steve lets him go, raising his hands in a show of good faith.
"Very sexy," Steve adds, sliding his hands down to grab Tony's ass.
"Oh, nice!" Lilly says, climbing on her.
Slamming the arc reactor in Steve's hand. No trust, liar.
"Anything big happen?"
"It's fine, leave the shield," Tony says. They seem to have avoided a direct confrontation, but it doesn't mean their respective problems have disappeared. "What was that about, about five other super soldiers and a shrink?"
Then one year in, give or take, Washington and finding out that Hydra was weaved throughout SHIELD happened. Tony noticed Steve wasn't quite the same after that, which he put on the trauma of making SHIELD fall and being faced by an enemy he had died to vanquish. Steve held him a little tighter when they were together, kissed him with surprising urgency, but he took his distances too. He'd go on unscheduled missions about Hydra something or other on the drop of a hat, always Hydra, alone or with his new friend Sam Wilson. He always came back agitated and reluctant to accept comfort, even if he said that the mission went fine. Tony did his best to help; he also put JARVIS on the case to find anything that could assist, which somehow made Steve twitchy instead of grateful.
"God, Steve, they're just babies. Who throws kittens in the trash?" Tony asks angrily.
It sobers Steve up, who goes back to intensely earnest. Now that Tony dares to look for it, adoration is all over his face. "Yes, yes, of course. I love you. I've been in love with you for so long. Before we got together, even. One of my biggest regrets was that I never told you."
"I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't want to believe it either, but he did. Well, Hydra forced him to do it, it wasn't Bucky's choice—"
the sheriff, and
"Come on, Daddy, hurry!" she demands as Tony and Rhodes huff and puff to get to the top at their turn.
That's interesting. It means that Bucky knows that him and Steve used to be a thing.
He's lost his smile, and Tony immediately knows it's serious.
Thor points enthusiastically. “Exactly.”
"I had my eyes opened." Memory-Tony stands up and moves behind the podium. He has an arm in a sling, and it is clear he was roughed up recently. "I came to realize that I have more to offer this world than just making things that blow up. And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark International—" the journalists stand up, shouting questions all over each other, flashes going off. A tall bald man in a gray suit and yellow tie grabs Memory-Tony's shoulders, as if to calm things down, then pushes him away from the stage as he continues to talk, "—until such a time as I can decide what the future of the company will be. What direction it should take, one that I'm comfortable with and is consistent with the highest good for this country, as well."
"I'd never hurt you. You have to know that."
As she grew up, Callie's fur has turned into a mid-long coat of very fine hair that puffs her up. It makes the joke and the contrast with her black – and very sleek – sister who sports the name Snowball even funnier in retrospect.
Lo and behold, the nanites pour out to cover Steve's hand until the reactor itself has disappeared and changed into a functional gauntlet, repulsor included.
He's trying to pull off Tony's clothes too, which is frankly unnecessary. Because it's not clothes Tony is wearing; it's his armor. He'd been so overwhelmed by the memories coming back when lying in his room that he completely forgot to change. A mental command is all that’s needed for the nanites to return to the reactor affixed to his chest.
"You know, all three of us have been able to start over, at one point or another. The circumstances have been different… but there's one thing that's the same. None of us did it on our own."
A man in the front of the press corp in a dark suit is raising his pen, eager. Memory-Tony knows him, he's usually fair.
"Sure," Tony says, transferring the cat and towel bundle to Thor’s arms. Snowball looks even tinier in the huge arms of a clearly smitten Thor. "You watch the hooligans for me, alright?" Tony tells Steve.
"Right?" Tony crows, proud of himself.
“I figure this will do?” he says with a wink.
Thor winks. "Only lovers touch each other's daemons."
Steve gleefully slides the ring on Tony's finger, a plain gold band that is hard to look away from.
"Sure," Steve says, mollified.
“Boars symbolize strength, fertility, abundance, generosity, courage, and power,” he lists with a deep voice. Said like that, the match with the Queen of Asgard seems spot on.
"Once Carol brought back Thanos's coordinates, we went to him. It was a desperate move, and we caught him off guard—probably because five years had passed. He must have thought we'd accepted our fate."
No doubt, this is going to be great.
"No one wants to see that," he says as he opens up the armor and steps out. If he has to get to Zemo by force, he's stronger with his powers. In the control room, Zemo's eyes are wide in shock at his nefarious plan being derailed. Barnes also looks shaken, and Tony frowns. "Are you okay?"
"As if it's the last time. Very intense."
"It wasn't him," Steve says, keeping his voice measured and low.
"Hey, hey, no, it's all right," Tony says, catching one of Steve's wrists. He's petting Steve's nape again, soothing the earlier sting.
Steve shivers, because that's not something he's used to. Sex's always been fast and secret while barely undressed, which was exciting in its own right. But Tony seeing all of him, and even better enjoying all of Tony, will be a luxury. While Tony takes care of the lamp, Steve gets rid of his clothes, including the undergarments. The hungry gaze he gets when Tony turns around and finds him naked makes Steve's stomach somersault. The slow up and down lingers on Steve's hard cock for several seconds, Tony even wetting his lip.
, Tony."
"Oh boy." Rhodey shakes his head, but he's repressing a smile. "You two can play in the lab later. For now, we have to plan on how to convince Cap and friends."
"Yeah? That's great, that's awesome."
There's a soft happy smile on WIM-Tony's face and then he's holding back sobs, not letting go.
Callie isn't interested by the pool at all, no matter what Sam does to entice her. Steve is thirsty and eventually gives his girl to Wanda before seeking a drink in the compound. He can't help but stop and smile at Thor, who's cradling a sleeping Snowball – surely she's exhausted by all the excitement.
Now that he's not flying anymore and the adrenaline is crashing, Tony is freezing out on the window sill. Thankfully, a bit of warmth from Steve's bedroom wafts outside, but the unattainable soft glow a few inches away is torture. If he could enter, Tony would fly to the bed and bury under what looks like soft blankets. It would smell like heaven, he's certain of it.
Does it mean what Steve thinks? That Tony believes Steve caught him having… desires, and he tried to get away from the situation? Because Steve might react badly if he knew? The first part is promising, but the second depressing.
"—and I'm horny as hell. Come on, I want to join the Mile High Club. It's an attainable goal, if we just commit to it."
"Privacy settings scrambled parts of the footage of the cargo bay by default, unless otherwise instructed."
"No. I just cannot pinpoint Loki's magic; it's very frustrating."
"Sure you don't," Steve says fondly. "I'll heat the milk."
"I was told you wished for water?"
"Wait, you mean not everyone gets to be Captain America? Are you sure? We've had a least six of them…" Mechanic-Tony replies.
"Huh. You're Tony Stark," the young man says.
"Yeah, he came over two days ago. The babies were due for deworming meds, and he said he was happy to do a home visit, being almost next door anyway. They're in perfect health," Tony says with pride.
Tony huffs. "Oh, your dick seems pretty certain. But you've been drinking and you never do."
"Excellent."
The End.
"You're gorgeous, too," Steve says. And looks perfect just where he is, in Steve's sheets.
It brought more tears to Steve's eyes instead of making him feel better.
"Yeah. She sacrificed herself for everyone else."
"Come on, guys!" Cora says, startling them both. Their daemons are side by side on a dresser, watching them as if at a live play.
"Give her a minute," Steve said. If he wasn't about ten feet away because of the ridiculously large bed, he would probably have scooped up his daemon protectively.
"Come here," Steve demands, and Tony happily obliges.
He extends it to Reed, who acts cool to cover how he wishes to snatch it out of his hand.
"Yeah, so you two," Jim says, pointing at Tony and Steve, "would have a better chance against Morgan and Pete."
"That's my line! Oh, yeah, yeah, that's what I'm talking about! I love your fingers."
"I think so." Tony's heart rate is coming down, so there's that. He's still slightly out of breath, but the stabbing feeling in his gut is definitely gone.
Steve kisses him deeply again and there's a shift from emotional to hungry as desire ratchets up. Skin on skin, their hands roam to explore and feel as they both longed for. Tony lets himself fall backward on Steve's bed and Steve takes a moment to look his fill.
"Yeah. How long?"
"I can work with that." Tony surveys the various levels shown on the HUD. "Hey, take this," he tells Steve once the shield looks like red and gold metal. Tony could have shrunk it and replicated the standard Cap shield, but he likes that this shield is large enough to protect all of Steve's body for once and made in Tony's colors.
"Bring him to the plane, we'll wrap things up here," Steve says.
"I think so. If not, I'm pretty sure we need to wake them," Steve says, rolling a chair next to Tony's to gaze at the babies too.
"Oh," Tony says, trying not to cry. Shit. JARVIS was as close as he'd ever have to a child, and he had grown up to become such a fantastic being. No diss to FRIDAY, whom Tony doesn't know yet, but he's going to miss JARVIS so much.
"Look at you," Tony croons, pumping him a few times but letting his other hand roam over defined abs and bulging pectorals. "You're gorgeous
"Good," Tony says, touched by how determined Steve sounds and looks. "For that we all need to be together, yeah? No going rogue bullshit."
It takes a ton of weight off Steve's shoulders. At twelve weeks old, they could have found forever homes for the kittens already. But Steve couldn't imagine letting go of the kittens, even to a nice family. And frankly? He's suspected for months that Tony would prefer to keep them; he's way too attached.
"You'll make me come," Steve says, as if it's a bad thing.
Steve grimaces. "Exploded the planet. Part of the population fled, but they lost a lot of people. The refugees relocated to Earth."
"I'm glad we all could come out of this fine," he says.
Reintegrating into public life is a pain in the ass though. There's way too much attention on him whenever he goes out, ten times worse than in the past. Or maybe it's that he's more aware of it because he'd been almost anonymous on Hala. On the upside, hopefully it will help to lure Kree.
Tony can't swear that he remembers everything in perfect clarity, but a lot has come back. The memory of the Avengers—the Battle of New York, the skirmish with AIM, Thor's run in with Malekith—insisted on playing behind Tony's eyes as he lay in the quarters Talos gave him. How the Avengers gradually went from coworker to teammates, and, in the two years between forming the band and the accident on Asgard, what Tony thought of as his slightly dysfunctional family. Not to dismiss his friendship with Bruce, Nat, Thor, and Clint, but that particular series of flashbacks also meant remembering Steve.
"Did you get one too?" Rhodes asks.
"I figure it's too late to pretend that I wasn't here at all, right?" the man in the red and black uniform who popped up earlier asks.
"Sometimes." Often with Tony, in fact, but that's because Steve loves having an excuse to take care of him.
"Does anyone have questions?"
With whiskey now coursing through his veins, Steve is finding it harder and harder to resist leaning just a little forward, to get closer. He already stretched a leg below the table and didn't move his foot when Tony bumped into it. Not that Tony broke that contact either, if he even noticed it happened, and Steve's enjoying the connection. But being tipsy on his way to drunk also makes Steve bolder, and when Tony looks up and finds him staring, Steve doesn't look away.
"Ah! Yes, yes, that's it. I'm right there!"
"Tony. I love sex, especially with you, but—"
"Your friend said that you are the foremost expert in green energy on your world?"
Tony is so thirsty, he doesn't care. He leans forward and starts licking the water on Steve's finger. Not the way he thought he'd put his tongue on the man for the first time, but he's thankful nonetheless. There isn't a lot to lap up, just a couple of drops, so Steve wets his fingers every few seconds.
On the small stage, Thor is beaming at the crowd. For an instant Tony thinks he's the one getting married, until he realizes he must be officiating, and that it's actually Steve who's the groom. He's fully costumed in the Captain America uniform, with Barnes by his side in black and dark blue leather, metal arm on display. Witnessing that Steve is marrying Bucky is a punch directly to Tony's gut, though not a surprise.
"We all need some R&R. If I put Nat on this now, she'll dive right in."
"I feel like a traitor to my religion," Tony says. "But remind me to try it anyway."
"Oh my God!" Tony exclaims, nose to nose with his own. He sounds excited though, a smile splitting his face, and not alarmed at all. How can he be so cute?
"Thank God." It's like a thousand tons have left Tony's shoulders. "I just want you to be happy, even if it's not with me. Because I love you too. And I should have said it, because it would have cleared up a few things."
"Yeah. Mostly," Steve confirms, while not looking that thrilled about it. It's surprising to Tony; with how close they've become, Tony imagined he'd be more… creative. "But you haven't called me Capsicle in years, no."
"I told you," Tony crows.
Peter's eyes widen and Tony stretches to put a hand over Steve's ear and whisper. "Psychological warfare, nice!"
A bruised ego, but thankfully that's about it. It takes a back seat compared to the comfort of Steve's big hands which are so hot, it's absolutely wonderful. Tony nods to reassure Steve, and then goes limp, basking in the glorious warmth.
Steve relaxes. "I'm glad to hear it. Promise me you'll be careful?"
"Thank you so much," Tony says as they gather everything they need to leave with the kittens. Steve's not surprised that he immediately goes for the box.
Anthony doesn't even have time to turn around. There's a sharp blow to the back of his head and the world goes dark.
"Where are my pants? Move back a little, there. Ugh, okay."
"All right."
"You believe Captain America is in the camp right now?"
The doctor shows Tony and Steve how to wash her little face with a wet wipe, and then how to stimulate for ejections. It's not complicated, but Steve wouldn't have known how to do it on his own. By the time the vet has gathered the supplies needed, including the heating pad in a box, Tony has finished feeding and cleaning up the black kitten. She's finally calm and drowsy.
"Where is he?"
"Yeah," Clint adds. "No one touches one of our own."
Curious, Tony opens the various doors in the room. He finds two linen cabinets, one luxurious bathroom, a separate toilet, and the last door is locked. It must lead to the adjoining bedroom, but the people who prepared their quarters forgot to unlock it. It's not a problem; they'll ask at dinner, so it's opened before coming to bed. Tony isn't sure that he could find Thor, and he doesn't want to get lost. As he's actually tired, Tony elects to go stretch out on the bed. He toes off his shoes as he reaches its edge.
"Sure, why not!"
gratifying too.
"Can I give this shield to Steve? Will it keep up?"
The only reassurance that he takes from the news is that Steve went from Nat to JARVIS, so he presumes that everyone else is fine. Steve would have said something happened to Rhodey, Pepper, or Happy, so Tony doesn't ask.
Tony lets his fingers trail down Steve's neck. He can feel his pulse, fast but strong, and he's never wanted to bite someone this much.
"Okay, let's get on it," Tony says, returning to his armor.
Which Steve did, while staying mostly on topic for whatever Tony was curious about.
Tony is stunned, unable to believe it. He was so sure that Natasha would survive them all.
Thor grabs the belt on the front of Yon-Rogg's uniform, which makes the man's eyes go round in surprise.
Drunk on sex, love, and maybe still a bit of whiskey, Steve resolutely chases his—and Tony's—happy ending.
"Of course," Steve says. He gets up, stiff as a board. "If you have any questions, I'll try to answer. The best I can."
And to think Tony believed he'd gotten close to Steve. He had it all wrong. All the nice things Steve said, they were said out of pity for him and because he feels guilty for the lies. Okay, sure, maybe he has a bit of a crush: Steve kissed him back earlier with enthusiasm, after all. But they were never best friends. Tony feels so stupid.
"You could have died, and I'd... I would have been too late, again—"
"Come on, come on!" Tony bunched Steve's T-shirt up under his arms, but now it’s infuriatingly stuck.
Tony sighs; he should have called, if only to explain what was happening. Rhodey has always been great at distracting him from heartbreak until it's manageable. "I know, honey bear."
Steve's lips rise in a smirk. "And I thought I was getting better at my craft. But that sounds like a believable alternate explanation."
After another long look over her shoulder at Rumlow on first, Natasha winds up and throws a good curveball. Unfortunately, Ward connects hard, turning it into a line drive heading straight between second and third. Steve judges the angle and starts running at a gallop, in hope to limit the damages. He curses inwardly because this is bad, very bad. Hopefully they can keep Rumlow from reaching third base or score.
It feels good, that's the thing. As far as Tony knows, Steve doesn't have a lot of experience at relationships. He would probably be a fun and attentive partner, too, and of course he's gorgeous. So even though Tony doesn't pursue Steve, he does nothing to close the door either, which is admittedly selfish. There is a nebulous possibility that is not unpleasant to toy with, and Tony just can’t bring himself to put an end to it entirely.
During the conversation – that Tony tried and failed to look uninterested in – Snowball has joined her sister in the incubator, now full and cleaned up. "I'm sorry—" Steve starts.
"You did not prepare them?" Heimdall is unimpressed and clearly judging Thor.
“Hey!” Lilly protests. “Crows are so intelligent! And they fly, like you!”
It goes on for a maybe a minute or two until Tony's thirst is quenched. When he's had enough, he leans back instead of forward and Steve immediately gets the message.
"It's fine," Not-Chewie says after shaking his gigantic head. He has a big, booming voice instead of a shrill Wookiee chant. Disappointing, if Tony is honest, but it may be because of the universal translator they had implanted. "You're not here to cause trouble, are you, Captain?"
"You fucking bet I am!" Vers exclaims, not ashamed at all. "The Krees kidnapped me on Earth, turned me into a human-Kree hybrid with Yon-Rogg's blood, and convinced me the Skrulls killed my family to fight an unjust war. Sound familiar?"
"Okay."
Tony's orgasm unfolds so forcefully that he spasms and shakes as it rips through him and makes his entire body sing. Even better, when he opens his eyes, he does so in time to see release hit Steve just as strongly. Even his "O" face is beautiful. That's how gorgeous Steve is. He fucks in a couple more times, chasing the aftershocks, but soon he lowers himself to lie on top of Tony, without his full weight as he's balancing on forearms planted by Tony's head. He's still holding Tony's right hand, but when he's wiped his other hand on the sheets, Tony’s free to trace up and down Steve's spine with his left hand.
"That's a personal pet project, and Earth has nothing to do with it. I don't know if trying to reason with this asshole makes any difference, Tony. He didn't understand the first time around. Maybe we should kill him."
"Because you have powers too now?" Rhodey asks.
"Sure it can. I must have a brain implant to control it by thought alone, but hold it in your hand and ask for something. I bet it’ll work."
"Hey, hey!" Tony protests, knocking on the window plane as hard as he can. "No, don't go! Please!"
Thor shrugs. "I wanted it to be a surprise."
Steve shakes his head. "No. He wasn't on Earth when the Avengers split. Neither was Thor. They came back at the same time as Thanos."
"Breathe. Calm down," Steve says several times in a row. He puts a big, warm hand in the middle of Tony's back, just resting there. It helps. "Everything is okay. They removed the shrapnel; you're in no danger."
"Jesus. You'll be quiet?"
"Hello, gentleman," he greets them. "What do we have here?"
Steve sits by Tony's side again, hands clammy with nerves now that he made up his mind.
"You've got this, Steve," Lilly adds.
It makes Tony's heart swell with love.
Tony belatedly wonders if she's self-conscious about the mechanical parts that make up her body. "Do
Eyes round, Steve nods. He looks scared and it's so baffling.
Frigga seems pleased by the answer too.
"Because it's Bucky!" Steve had cried out. He seemed to have surprised himself with that, and then had immediately lowered his tone as he repeated himself. "It's Bucky, Tony."
"I wish," Steve says, looking at Tony's arm. It's true that he might have healed. "I'm sorry you got hurt."
"DUM-E can do that," Tony says. The robot beeps in agreement.
"American?" Tony guesses, as much by the accent as the fact that Steve knows of Marvels magazine.
"Let go; we'll jump off," Steve says when they're a few feet away. Which they do when Tony unlocks the armor’s arms, as graceful as cats.
It makes Tony laugh. "I don’t think he’s that young, but yeah, still a baby. I was never interested. He hit on
Not caring which direction he's going—distance is key at the moment, not destination—Tony walks as fast as can. He hopes it's not providing an irresistible lure for a predator, though. The eyes were front facing and way too high off of the ground, hinting at something huge and dangerous. Certainly not a deer. It might be paranoia, but Tony feels as if he's being followed, even if he can't hear or see anything new every time he checks behind him.
Tony pulls back with a smile. "Of course not. And I'll have you know that I'm even harder to kill now!"
"Do you prefer a side?" Tony says, making a straight line for the bed.
"Let's start with a first date, maybe?"
"Like who?" Steve has the gall to argue, hooking a foot around one leg of the console to anchor himself and not slide closer. But even with all of Steve's strength, Tony is still being dragged in inch by inch. "The Fantastic Four vanished, that's why we're here!"
"Yep. I'm Cora. I'd wished for a smoother introduction, but it is what it is."
"I suppose I didn't take the news well," Tony finally says. He's afraid he might shake apart.
"He told you how it came to be?" she asks with interest, cocking her head.
"How fascinating," he says, as if he can't be bothered by what is happening right now. One of the biggest lies of his life. "I have the remote, can you get us home?"
? With Pepper? What the hell was she thinking? He's not father material. Heck, he was sure he and Pepper were finished, though he had hoped for a reconciliation.
"Please. They're all smitten already." The team will spoil the sisters rotten, he's convinced of it.
Steve rubs his neck. "Well, yes. You've met FRIDAY."
Tony cranes his neck back, and sees Steve hovering in between the kitchen and the lounge, eyes glued to the TV. He's probably on his way to the gym.
"If you don't want me to come in your mouth, pull off now because I'm close," Tony warns. His balls are tightening, and his voice is low.
"Powers." Steve is clearly curious, but also hard in his pants, and he groans when Tony, admittedly unfairly, grinds the heel of his hand on his erection. "Okay, we'll talk later."
"And if they don't think we're a threat?" Tony asked.
"As soon as you take your pants off and give me the lube, sweetheart."
Tony's fangs are completely out and he drags the sharp point of one over the artery. Hell, he wants this so much that Tony has to be careful not to drool all over Steve's neck.
"See? It works out perfectly."
"I think that’s a stupid way to go about it," Tony says anyway.
It's not that training is totally unpleasant, and Anthony particularly loves it when they allow him to fly. But if he has to meditate to control his transformation towards binary mode by increments—without even being allowed to photon blast a few targets—for hours at a time again, he's going to hurl.
"What a good baby!" Tony says, bringing her back close to his chest. "So precocious."
"You can come whenever you want."
"I just got out of a relationship," he says, as gently as he can.
"And you think I don't want that?"
"As I said, we won a big battle. A lot because of you. It had an impact all over the universe, and several worlds, some who had never heard of Earth before, want to meet us. Carol convinced Fury it was a convenient way to build good credibility if we ever need help in the future."
Tony's eyes widen in surprise as Jim laughs. Steve can't break eye contact though, nervousness knotting his stomach. But then Tony starts smiling. The relief that follows is staggering and Steve helplessly smiles back. Oh God. His not-so-well-kept secret, except to Tony, is out in the open. And he's not being immediately turned down.
"Wait!" Steve somehow catches Tony's wrist before he's too far.
obvious?
Tony was holding her loosely, so Lilly could easily have gotten away. Instead, she kept wiggling while he poked her some more, and she attacked his fingers in return, all the while not hurting him at all, just tiny scratches and nibbles, as predicted.
"New boot?" It's gray, but Steve hopes that Tony just hasn’t gotten around to painting it red yet.
Exactly. That's his girl. Tony nods his agreement.
"Says the guy who came already," Tony replies with a breathless laugh.
"Huh. Okay, so hopefully they won't try that again."
"No, I didn't," Steve says with a crooked smile. "I'm very much single and not looking to meet new people. Especially not in space."
"I'm Will. I didn't know 'bout the cats, Captain. Honest," he says. Steve believes him; he seemed just as surprised as Tony when Steve fished the bag out. "There are a lot of strays around here."
A woman enters the room and she strikes Tony speechless. She's a cute brunette with blue eyes and a friendly demeanor, dressed all in white too, but her skin is magenta. A deep, beautiful color, really, but Tony is freaking out. Something’s very wrong.
Upon hearing Tony, Snowball leaves her noodle and swims back towards him. She even manages to meow doing so, which is hilarious.
"Sassy. But back to the initial question: do you have the last configuration of the armor stored in memory?"
He focuses and hears it again, and he can tell by how high pitched it is that it must be a kitten. Maybe it got trapped?
"See?" Tony winks at Steve. "Time flies when you're having fun."
"Was it necessary to show off like that?" Steve asks.
"True, I can see it."
To be honest, Tony doesn't want to go either. Not when there's a kindle between them that is so close to catching fire.
The lovely Dina comes back with equipment that looks like it came right out of Star Trek for thankfully non-invasive tests. When Tony focuses on the shiny new tech, it helps him not spiral into panic again.
"That's good. I encourage you to persevere," Chancellor Almar says, amused.
Spotting no visible furballs, he crouches near their box and opens up the lid. Snowball has flopped right on top of Callie, but they are both fast asleep. Steve takes a picture to add to his growing collection, and closes the lid.
"I can stay with you if you want," Nebula adds.
"Understood, Sir." The armor closes up, and it strides to the first super soldier pod, stops, before walking to the next to repeat its scans. "Of note, as is protocol when the suit is deployed, I have recorded everything from the moment we left Avengers Tower. Including Helmut Zemo's earlier indirect insinuation that he was responsible for Vienna and Berlin in a ploy to ultimately bring you here."
"Quiet day?" Steve asks. There's not a hint of judgment in his tone, just honest curiosity.
"I did," a proud Peter says, rocking back on his heels.
Steve clearly interprets his reply as Tony saying he'd not miss him, with the way his smile drops. It makes Tony realize that their falling out must still feel raw to Steve, too. Maybe Tony wasn't the only one hurt by the whole mess, which makes him pause.
"Did we lose people?" he asks instead.
"I gave you two a good three seconds!" Peter protests, pushing the tube on the ice to come back.
Tony doesn't mind at all. He's safe now, and he's certain Steve will succeed. He can't believe Victor caught him unprepared like an amateur. Tony walked right into Victor's trap, disguised in a request for a formal non-aggression treaty. Underhanded, and Tony will make ensure the story is heard all over the world and ruins the little reputation Victor Von Doom still has left.
"What I won, is it void now?"
Tony tilts his head, considering, but not speaking out, as if waiting for Steve's input.
Steve isn't surprised at the news and sighs. "Of course he didn't. Do you know where he is?"
"I'm not a soldier," Tony protests. "And certainly not a tool to further the Kree agenda."
Mr Adrenaline Junkie frankly deserves the unspoken call-out.
"Of course. But Tony, I really think we should go back to our seats and wait—"
"Do you still have clothes over here?" Rhodes asks. "If not, I have a few spare bathing suits."
They've earned it.
"No," Tony declares. The compliment almost makes Steve blush until Tony adds, "Annoying, isn't it?"
"Yeah. We left for Sovereign, but that's when we got caught in a skirmish with the Krees."
Carol laughs. "Good try, hot shot."
"There are lots of reasons to refuse a pet to a four-year-old kid. But that it will distract him from his work isn't one of them," Steve argues. "Did he hire you at Stark Industries when you turned five?"
He guides them to his bed by walking backwards to it and pulling Tony along. When Steve reaches his destination and sits down on the cot, Tony continues with his forward movement to crawl right onto his lap. He doesn't stop until he's plastered to Steve's chest with both arms looped around his neck, which is a marvelous place to be. Especially with Steve's head tilted back to look up at him, adoration written all over his face. Tony must look just as sappy; he certainly feels like it.
"Hi, Cap," Rhodes says. He pauses his conversation with Sam and tilts his head to the side upon noticing the bag. "Going somewhere?"
“Got it. Pre-Rebirth. It explains why you don’t have a lion of your own.”
It's none other than Dugan who appears first, a frown marring his face. "Why didn't you come back to camp, Cap? Are you okay?"
Snowball?" she asks, eyebrows rising as she pets the kitten.
"And yet, you're smiling!"
High Priestess Ayesha inclines her head very slightly, almost dismissively, and Tony hopes that everyone keeps their cool and bites their tongue. Hopefully Carol and Steve understand that Tony wants them to look borderline incompetent. No one wants those assholes to come and poke at Earth.
'"Hey, I'm just the messenger," Att-Lass says, interrupting Anthony's existential musing.
Anthony is trying to shake off the memories, or at least open his eyes to see who's analyzing them in real time, but he's too weak. Power dampeners, he realizes, different from the implant in his back. He'll need a minute. Especially since the images he sees are moving as if someone is prompting his mind to go faster, to something significant. Memory-Anthony is now working on a device, the core for an exquisite and advanced light-speed engine, and checking out plans and a notebook. There's also a screen that is split in two, one half in Kree and the other in another language.
"Oh geez."
He's home (Steve. Steve is home), and he's safe. It's the best thing in the world to tip his head up and meet Steve for a kiss, affirming and sure.
DUM-E chirps and gets carefully in position to focus his camera on the sleeping newborns.
It disarms Tony, the way he can’t bear to see Steve like this even if a part of him insists that Steve
"I'm not going anywhere," Steve says, extending a hand to invite Tony to come closer. "There will be other times. For now, I want to help you as much as I can."
"They won't. And they need the Quinjet, anyway. If they dare try to steal it from me, they're in for a surprise."
"I see her," Steve says reassuringly. "She's flying right back to you."
"Admit it once and for all. That's my ultimate purpose," Anthony replies. "To defeat Vers."
"Yeah, so to minimize the changes, we went back in time again after we were done and replaced the stones at the same moment we took it."
Tony tilts his head, zoning on the slip. Of course. "And not—? You've got your sights on someone, my dear Captain? Tell me more."
Steve huffs in amusement. "Pretty cool, but I'd prefer seeing as little as possible of this new green blood."
"He made a mock-up Super Serum. And Hydra wanted more soldiers like Bucky, so they stole it."
"You've enjoyed your evening?" Almar asks. Tony resists draining the glass in one go like Nebula, clinging to an appearance of composure.
It seems to be going well so far. In fact, the greetings and visits soon turn into a dinner party. Tony doesn't know what’s in that orange fruity drink they keep serving, but he hasn't felt this mellow in years. He can't say that he minds. Plus it works for everyone: he caught Nebula laughing earlier, which was amazing. The two captains also have reddened cheeks and are loose-limbed, so it affects superpowered beings too. Good, they all deserve a bit of fun.
"I'll allow one more time."
"I think so too, maybe friends and family," Steve says. Some rogues didn't wear their old uniforms without patches, and since they looked like any other citizen, it made it even harder to ferret them out.
"Steve would love to take you out, what do you say?"
"No, no, I'm game. Just surprised?"
He whines when Tony pushes him back a few inches, intentionally catching Steve's eyes to gauge his reaction.
"Please, Tony, I just... we thought—" Steve wrings his hands, distressed. "There’s so much you need to know. Let me—"
"Why are you here, Tony?"
Steve rises to his feet to help tidy up.
Steve's untouched dick jumps at that, totally on board with the idea. He's careful not to knee Tony anywhere by accident as he moves up his body, but is soon in position. He helps Tony prop his head and shoulders up a bit with his pillow and is still unprepared when Tony grabs his cock. Steve moans at the touch, stuttering forward to seek more friction. God, Tony's hand is perfect, the callouses the exact amount of rough to make pleasure spike.
He's reversing their positions so that Steve's leaning against the counter now. With his index finger, Tony scoops up some of the come on Steve's face and feeds it to him. He's avoiding touching anywhere else, though, and it's a torture of its own.
They all chuckle and Steve reaches for her in comfort. "Just a second, don't worry." Tony and the doctor focus on feeding the black kitten
"Too much?"
"Yeah, I don't think so," Steve says, petting her in reassurance.
But now it's showtime, and they've always worked well together, even when they butted heads at the start of the Avengers. No matter what happens, Tony trusts Steve to have his back in a fight.
“Chaotic?” Steve is keeping a hand perched on his thigh, the little stoat huddled under his palm and peeking out from between his fingers. “Thor said that everyone in the universe has a daemon?”
"After defeating Thanos?"
"Boss, there are ten more on foot outside too and rapidly incoming," FRIDAY says, tagging them on a map on the HUD. They'll join them in the back lot in a few seconds.
"It is," Steve agrees warmly.
"Better, I'd say. Colonel Rhodes' visit helped." Jim spent a long weekend at the tower two weeks ago, but understandably didn't tell the team a lot about Tony's state of mind. "Boss is working a lot and not sleeping enough."
"Fine. I'll feed them this time, but set the timer and Sandra will have to do it next, if they aren't gone by then."
"Haven't you heard? We need to move the project." Yon-Rogg is smiling. "A better room, and more protection now that you're almost done."
"Frigging Electro," Johnny says, pointing over his shoulder. Strips of his own uniform binds and gags Dillon. He looks disgruntled, but who knows how long ago they have tied him up.
The voices are distracting Tony from the visions. He's not only lived through them, a while ago, he's also seen fragments of them through flashes in his nightmares in the last few years. With more, always more, including diverting a nuclear warhead through a wormhole and an alien army waiting in space to annihilate them all.
"That's... shit!" Tony said, aghast. "Don't worry, we'll find him and give him all the treatment he needs."
. "Easy, the both of you."
He puts the sleeping kitten next to her sister in the third incubator, which they built in between feedings. It has the heartbeat noise, precisely heated water circulation, an extra soft lining, and Steve even has an app to see the kittens' live cam on his phone. It looks very comfortable. Steve has seen Tony do manual work often, it's what he does, but it's the first time that Steve has been so involved in a project. As a sounding board, yes, but they made the hotbed together, and he's very proud of the result. Steve wouldn't be surprised if Tony already has ideas to improve it, though.
That's another frustration in Anthony's life; they limit his powers with a controller implanted directly into his spine. It's between his shoulder blades, so he can't take it out alone, and it is supposedly for his own protection and everyone else's. He's been patient, but if they don't set him free sometime soon, Anthony is this close to disabling it himself. He remembers nothing from before the attack, but they said that his life had been a series of errors and fuck-ups, which is why they can't fully trust him. Unfortunately, unlike many things that he's been told about his life from before, this one rings true to what Anthony feels in his guts.
Dismissing him for now, Tony stops on pictures of War Machine and someone in a smaller armor, blue and gold and a lot sleeker. Nanotech, like his own, and Tony wonders who the hell he gave a suit to. That’s huge. He almost drops his phone when there's a shot of the open visor and it's
"He's great with them," Steve says, reluctantly passing the phone to Vision.
"DUM-E!" Tony snaps. "What did I say?"
"Ready to go in?"
"I haven't thought about it," Tony says, leaning in to watch the kittens in the box. "Not really. Do you have any suggestions?"
There's no tsunami of memories. But if Tony thinks of Morgan, it's like an explosion of love goes off in his chest, a thousand times brighter than what he felt looking at the photos on his phone. He remembers vividly the feel of her tiny arms locked tight around his neck when they said goodbye before the trip, and it's as wonderful as it's bittersweet.
"Excellent plan."
Tony had shared pictures of the sisters with Steve here and there since he left, but it's always just the cats. He'd love to have the one with Tony. And for all that Rhodes has been Tony's best friend for decades, Steve is a little jealous that the kittens aren't a Steve-and-Tony thing only, which he realizes is stupid. Steve checks his own phone and sees that Tony sent him a new picture too: Calliope is on top of Snowball, who seems to be crying out in distress. No Tony in the photo at all, though, which is a bummer.
Steve's heart is racing as he goes for it; his hands are so sweaty he wipes them on his thighs. After a fortifying breath, he takes the plunge.
"Yeah," Steve breathes out.
The doctor, regular-toned this time, tells Tony that it's uncertain that he'll get all of his memories back. Even advanced alien races find the consequences of traumatic brain injury strange and unpredictable. They treated the neuron and mild axonal damage, plus the bruising of his brain, and mitigated possible secondary symptoms such as headaches, nausea, fatigue, concentration issues, irritability, depression, and the like. But everything about how Tony's brain manages the information, old and new, is out of their hands. The doctor advises him not to force himself to remember as it's too early. Tony's brain needs rest, and the best strategy is to let memories come back to him a bit at a time. Getting told stories and looking at images is alright, but he has to stop if his head hurts. Tony's sure that the hole in his memories is going to drive him crazy, to be honest.
"The whole building, but lots of it is for the company. Who's home, J?"
"Give your boss what's needed to patch up the place, understood? We Avengers don't like having debts. If there's money left, keep a twenty-five percent tip and give the rest to Tal."
It's with reluctance that he finally drops Steve's wrist. It’s strange how he's still angry and hurt but nonetheless found comfort in the contact. Without daring to check Steve's face, because he can’t deal with Steve's feelings on top of his own right now, Tony moves towards the edge of the bed.
First thing first, he hopes that he has the energy to reach Steve's small townhome. Tony's been flying for hours, and he's so tired he could cry. Just another effort: he's passed JFK Airport, there are about five miles to go.
"That's quite the story." Rhodey pulls Tony in a little tighter, even kisses his temple. "Thanks for bringing my favorite idiot back, Carol."
"Yeah, but this one is Snowball," Rhodey says, lowering the black kitten onto Wanda's lap, much to her delight.
After he hangs up, the doctor turns back to them. He inclines his head with a smile.
Tony is too banged up to start a long trek in the woods where he's still lost. He should rest too, as it should be easier to find his way back in the light of day. Eventually, Tony gets up and drags the bodies of the soldiers away from the campfire, adds wood to the latter, then installs a bedroll by the sleeping wolf. It's too big to drag into a tent, and who knows how disoriented it will be when it wakes up. Tony wouldn't want for it to feel trapped and lash out at the closest perceived enemy. An appropriated blanket around his shoulders, Tony tries to keep watch, wary of Hydra returning and the fact that he shouldn't sleep after such a hard blow to the head. The regular sounds of a forest are back, which is slightly comforting, but also acts as a lull. Tony starts nodding off as the night stretches on.
"Surrender now!" Vers cries out.
"Callie it is!" Tony smiles back. He then snaps his fingers. "Oh, got it!"
At last, Tony puts his precious cargo on the table. The black kitten immediately starts meowing again.
She's not wrong, and he's definitely getting old for this. Plus they don’t have Helen Cho's cradle or that alien hospital's tech around to smooth the consequences.
"It's true, they grow like weeds," Steve says. He's vindicated when Callie looks up at his voice and makes a beeline towards him.  Heck, his cheeks might crack, he's smiling so widely. "Hey there, baby girl."
Tony squeezes Steve tightly and lets himself relax into the comfort of their embrace. It feels so good. He remembers Natasha Stark's vows: your heart is my home and your arms my shelter, and it resonates as exactly right.
"Cap, I'm going up!"
Tony isn't sure if he can survive being waterboarded one more time, not with the battery-
Steve shakes his head no. So whoever their travel companions are, it's not anyone that Tony remembers.
"Hm…" Mechanic-Tony says. "I do like fireworks…"
"Yeah," Tony says. "I've always known that Fury's secrets had secrets."
"Of course not! Steve Rogers, love of my life, I am so crazy about you that the thought of… of not having your glorious penis in me is intolerable. Please, please, have mercy."
"By being a big damn hero, how else?" Steve says with a soft smile.
"As fascinating as this is, and best of luck to alternate me in tapping that," Tony says, inclining his head towards everything that is well and good in Sheriff-Steve, "I hope this remote works or else we're screwed."
"Not my fault you are so touchable!"
"Yeah, I saw the pictures."
"It's the name of the planet and its people. They're a highly advanced civilization and respected as such. They also take themselves very seriously," Carol says. "As an advance notice, every one of them is the color gold. Maybe they let that get to their heads."
"Lies." That's what he saw earlier, it must be.
Steve looks so sad, and his apology makes no sense.
"Fucking me?" Tony interrupts with an eyebrow raise. "Yes, and it's been fantastic. I'm pretty sure you're a born Service Top. Meaning you'd be happy to do whatever I ask you to do, including fucking me through the mattress," Tony adds, tightening his hold in Steve's hair sharply.
And that's another thing. Steve is furious that Howard used him, and the whole Captain America schtick, to bring down a young Tony. He hates it more than pretty much anything else in the world.
"Thank you. Rhodey told me you don't agree with the Accords, but we'll have a serious conversation about them, at the very least."
"She, they're both girls," Tony says. "And yeah, she's Snowball."
"—but it's very unfair that you have to relive this twice."
"Sandra's not back yet?" Doctor Martin asks.
"Do you want something from the inside?" Steve asks.
"Come on," he says when he releases Tony, though he keeps an arm around his shoulders. Now that he's got permission to touch, Steve plans on taking advantage of it every moment he can. "Let's go see how the children are doing."
The situation is indeed different, and Tony nods.
Steve is breathing faster than normal, and he finally looks Tony in the eyes again, still holding onto his hand. "I won't let them."
"And you were right."
"Probably not. I haven't been there in 21 years, and just a bit at that." She pauses, scrutinizing his face. "But then again, maybe. The Krees really did a number on my head. You do look familiar."
They came to Knowhere, and this casino in particular, to pick a fight and cause a big splash. The story of Tony pulling off the best hand possible at Navive to everyone's surprise? It’ll make the rounds. Gossips will speculate about if it was or wasn't Tony's first time playing, for one. If he’s a newbie, heck, even a more experienced player, it shows he's smart and cunning. Many people, like Kol, will accuse Tony of cheating. That's a no-go for many, at least getting caught doing it. But what Tony is doing right now? Talking to Kol as if he's a child and offering a little fortune as if it's nothing to him? That’ll piss off so many people in a world like this. It works with Kol, whose eyes are now bugging out of his skull. He's so enraged that he's vibrating.
The film—no, the memory's Anthony raises his head and frowns.
"I'm sorry you had to see that," Steve says with a sigh.
In reality, in this timeline the stones don't exist anymore since Steve took them back to the past where they belonged. None of them miss the stones. They were nothing but trouble. Magic is a pain in the ass like that.
Having amnesia sucks. That's another thing for which Anthony resents Vers. Not only did she kill his family in that terrorist attack with the Skrulls, Anthony has no points of reference for his life from before. Which means he doesn't even know who the guy that appears for him as the Supreme Intelligence actually is.
"Yeah. Also, don't freak out if I bleed green, it's the new normal." Tony places a kiss under Steve's jaw and rejoices when he feels Steve have a full body shudder in reaction. Yeah, he's still got it, and remembers just how to make Steve's body sing.
There's a sour taste in Tony's mouth. Everyone leaves him in the end. Family, lovers, spouse, friends, coworkers, they never stay. Except Rhodey. More than ever, he misses Rhodey fiercely and wishes he were here.
He gestures, and a white string comes out of a little device on Peter's forearms and wraps around Tony's wrists. When he tries to separate his arms, the bond is very strong. Enough that Tony needs to use his super strength and heat to break it. He can't wait to look at what it's made of.
"Hungry little thing!" the vet says, smiling back. "Easy, girl, you don't want to choke."
It sounds so right that Steve nods enthusiastically. "Yes, that's perfect. Callie for short."
"She's a Krylorian," Steve says, looking at him strangely like Tony’s the one not making sense instead of the other way around.
What a wretched lover he makes, taking his pleasure without making sure that Tony was comfortable! He should have been more careful.
Tony cannot promise that, because it's prime teasing material. On the other hand, there's also a familiar grimoire and he taps on it.
"And there are five more super soldiers just like him. I can't let the doctor find them first, Rhodes. I can't."
"Still, it really looked that way. No one wanted to accept it, but Thor took us all to the scene… and shit, man, I don't know how you survived that blast. It destroyed the lab completely, especially where the experiment had been."
"I can give you a long list of people who genuinely believe I'm nothing but a nuisance, including Colonel Phillips."
Around them the lights come on, and the yellow glow in the capsules shows that they indeed hold five bodies. The unexpected thing is that they each have a bullet in the head.
"Well, no," Tony replies. "If Steve has his girl here, why would he?"
"I'm not so bad," Anthony says as he pulls Yon-Rogg upright.
God, he's close friends with Captain America, who thinks the world of him. It's hard to believe, but it sure feels wonderful.
"No, but I can’t cash it in for you right this moment," Jarons says, deadpan.
Tony grins. "Definitely likes you back, dear heart. More than you realize. But as much as I'd love to stay to recite the sonnets I composed in your honor, I have to take care of a problem."
"It's close?" Tony asks. Maybe the suit is in sentry mode in the corridor or just outside.
"Guilty."
Steve stretches his neck and shoulders until a vertebra pops and then lets his head fall back. He's still tired too, even after a full night of sleep.
Steve had enthusiastically kissed Tony again, wrapping him in his arms, and it had been amazing.
"I believe he is, Boss," FRIDAY says, lowering the volume.
"That's it?"
"Got it Boss."
"FRIDAY, you hear me?" Tony asks, without even taking out his phone.
Something touches Tony's leg and he startles, eyes wide open and heart racing. It's the wolf, who has started to stir and bumped Tony's thigh with a front paw. The night is ending, the full moon setting while the first rays of light of the day are surely only minutes away as the sky is already lightening. Tony dares to pet the wolf again, but flinches and brings his hand back when there is weird movement under his fingers.
"Yeah, it is. See you in three minutes, honey."
"Thank you, by the way," Tony says, "For rescuing them. I still cannot believe someone threw these precious babies in the trash."
To Tony's horror, Steve is close to tears, distressed. Tony doesn’t want anyone to look at him like that and definitely not when he's just kissed them. Especially not Steve. Tony's stomach drops. Clearly the break in the texting is because of something huge. But Steve said they’re good now; he doesn't understand.
"I agree. He prefers cheeseburgers, no pickles."
Tony is no doubt about to argue when a man with a lab coat joins them from a second door that leads to the interior of the clinic. His nametag confirms that this is indeed Doctor Martin.
“He’s an invaluable part of the team,” Tony adds, and Thor lights up with joy.
"It's not too much!" Steve assures. "I love getting them, I swear. You could send some every day and I wouldn't grow tired."
"Boss has a mild concussion," the AI rats him out.
The hurt of his parent's death had never healed; something so big can only be managed, but to learn that it was a murder? Tony had rubbed at his sternum in self comfort and couldn't help but flinch when Steve tried to touch him.
"I'm certain many people are armed all the same," Nebula says as Big Purple passes a detector up and down her body. He gestures at her to go through and starts on Steve next. Tony's been focusing on Nama, but the purple bouncer is so tall and large, Steve almost looks like a child in comparison.
It makes Steve turn serious once more. "You're feeling better, though, right? It helped?"
"What is this?"
"Your judgment is askew," Rhodey says. "Your old war buddy killed innocent people yesterday."
Tony's never seen Steve like this, speaking fast and halted, almost babbling. It's painful, and Tony takes a deep breath to slow his racing heart. He tries to sound calm and collected.
"See? You two would get along great, I know it."
It's apparent right away that Kol is trying to collect a blue series, that the silent man next to him is completely disorganized, and so on. The croupier and other players definitely don’t consider Tony a threat, and he does his best to comfort them with that idea by hesitating from time to time before he chooses a tile.
He's nervous, Tony realizes. Ah, shit, did he notice that every version of Tony Stark out there was gone on his Steve? It was glaringly obvious, after all. He crosses his arms over his chest, bracing for a probable soft rejection (he's sorry he's a dude right now, too).
"Dad, my feet are cold."
It takes a dozen strokes and Tony starts coming. Immediately Steve pulls off so that the jizz covers his face, keeping his mouth open and tongue out. It's gratifying that Tony curses loudly.
"I need to tell you something."
Tony went to the parley in good faith, but also alone, a mistake born of overconfidence and pride. He was forcefully turned into his bat form as soon as he crossed the threshold of the rendezvous point. An excellent move that ensured that Tony couldn't use his super strength or his own magic against Victor in retaliation. A younger or inexperienced vampire might have been too disoriented by the change to react. Fortunately, Tony had immediately realized how screwed he was and escaped before the door closed and trapped him in.
"What the hell?" he says. "You're confused, little bat. There's nothing for you in here."
Steve hears the other side of the conversation, due to his enhanced hearing. A woman; Viv from the reception, if Steve's not mistaken.
, Caparoni. You know how it is. Had to admire his game, though."
"I'm fine, honest," Tony pats Steve's arm in reassurance. He's so hot to the touch, even through his shirt. "I was a fool and walked into a trap."
"What are you?" Tony murmurs. Hydra didn't even shoot once at it with a real gun; they wanted to capture it, not kill it.
"Unfortunately not. At least not right now," Tony teases. Steve grins again and leans into another kiss. He seems determined to keep Tony as close as possible while he still can.
Doctor Martin shakes his head. "We don't have the staff to care for them around the clock, and they'll be better with a foster family, anyway. They might even have a nursing mother at the shelter."
There it is. As far as Tony can detect, Steve's offer comes from a genuine desire to help, and not only because he seeks the high of a vampire bite. He might be curious about that, too, judging by his reaction to the fangs. Tony has taken too long to reply and Steve is now beet red and trying to backtrack.
There's a deliberate enunciation with Tony's speech, obviously the result of too much alcohol. Steve's stomach drops; he thought Tony had finally made progress with that demon. He seemed better, tinkering in his smithy rather than spending his time at the casino's bar, and Steve was thrilled about it. Tony was like a new man since Steve's return, smiling instead of brooding and every inch the brilliant inventor he'd always boasted to be.
Science fairs are the best.
"My pleasure. Boss is in the workshop."
"Philadelphia, you said?"
"Yeah, and you have Captain America in your garbage. I'm just as surprised by that as you are."
"So it's a promo tour."
Right about now, Steve wants a bunch. "Yes, one day."
"What?" Tony blinks at Steve as if surprised, but then shrugs. "Oh, thanks. The trick is to be gentle. And to pay attention to them, that's all. Do you want to hold him?" He asks while extending the baby towards Steve, who shakes his head no.
Steve looks crestfallen. "No, not that first time. I was a fugitive, with my half of the Avengers."
"True, I'm tired. But I'm still strong enough to take on Victor with a few friends, and I need an experienced crew on this." He sees that Steve is about to protest—of course—and adds. "I'm not against you getting involved in the future once you've trained with us. But not today."
Okay, so Steve's smart, so smart, but also a little dumb. Tony raises a wing and, slowly and pointedly, hits the magical barrier that prevents him from going in. Steve flushes red.
He presses on the wall for his own bedside drawer and takes out what looks like a brand new bottle of slick. Steve said he'd wished the trip would bring them closer, and Tony wonders if he packed the lube, hoping to get him in bed. Probably, and Tony likes that idea. He enjoys even more how Steve doesn't waste any time in wetting his fingers and caressing Tony's hole, a tease more than anything. It feels nice, but he wants to get it on already.
Surely it's not that bad? Callie probably just needs some reassurance. Steve crouches down and puts his hand under her belly so she's up on her paws once more. He then gently pulls on the leash again so that she can feel the tug, and moves her with it. She lets her legs drag without even trying to stand on her own.
"I'm conducting a study on the variables that influenced the Superhero Registration program. The Civil War event, as it's called in many universes," Richard says.
"Of course!" Tony says. "Can't have them loose if there's no one to hold them." He wouldn't put the kittens’ safety in jeopardy, as careless as he often is with himself.
That frankly throws Tony off balance. Yes, he was pissed, and he thinks it was rightly so. But he'd thought a lot about the situation on Asgard before the accident, and since getting his memories back with a new perspective of having been brainwashed, he'd come to realize that Steve had not been in the best headspace at the time. With Hydra rearing up, Bucky reappearing, the guilt at knowing his BFF suffered for years, plus learning about Tony's parents… (Howard was Steve's friend, after all). It was a lot. Tony believes Steve wanted to spare him some pain, as misguided as it was. To see him so torn up about it hurts Tony too.
"And we worked together again." After five more years of not talking, it seems.
The tip of Steve's ears go pink as he looks at the floor. He always gets flustered when Tony shamelessly flirts, it's adorable.
"Rooms?" Carol asks, tilting her head.
Unfortunately, reality rudely intrudes by a voice speaking up, closer than Tony expected someone to be. "Steve? Where the hell are you?"
the female voice exclaims.
"Holy shit, oh my God," Tony says, throat tight as he fights with his white shirt. The damn garment isn’t a traditional hospital gown; it has snaps in the front that Tony opens until he can see his chest. The arc reactor
"It was. But come on, you
The exit leads them to a large outdoor space littered with metal containers. Unfortunately, there’s also a small aircraft hovering in the air, waiting for them. It's locked and loaded, and the firing starts as soon as they get out.
The story they spun for the press was truthful, even if incomplete. An accident on Asgard, a long period where he remembered nothing, and another shock that made him regain his memory a week ago. Fortunately, he'd had help to return to Earth, and so here he was, safe and sound and ready to take back the Iron Man mantle. He kept mum on his new powers, the Kree, Carol, and the Skrulls though.
"That's an excellent idea, whoever you are, thanks." Bucky then hurries to lock himself in the front of the plane.
"Is that the man who dared take you from Asgard?"
"Attagirl." Tony raises his hand at Carol for a high five which she returns.
"Agreed." Steve steps out of his pants—revealing no underwear. Also that he's hung, holy shit.
When Fury asked them to investigate the F4's mysterious disappearance, Tony couldn't resist Steve's puppy eyes to search the Baxter Building. Tony had held on to his resentment about Steve's secrets and the fight in Siberia for eighteen long months, but it's hard to sustain when faced with Steve's earnest apologies and desire to be forgiven.
Steve’s eyes snap up to Tony's. He looks weirdly surprised by the question. "No, it's yours."
He doesn't need it, apart from the link to JARVIS, but it might become useful if sharing a plane with the super soldiers becomes too much (either to shut himself in it or fly it to their eventual destination).
But now… it's a totally different ball game. Tony's single, mostly retired, and Steve is definitely not straight and interested right back. God, that kiss on Iantus had been perfect, until it ended abruptly. And most important of all: they might not have interacted much, but Morgan warmed up to Steve fast. She's Tony's priority now and probably forever, and Steve would be good with her—he's certain.
Nebula lands the Blaze on a rundown platform that already hosts a dozen ships that vary from shiny and new to the alien equivalent of being held together by duct tape and a prayer. There's curiosity from the few onlookers on the docks when they unboard, but Carol pays no mind to the staring and strolls confidently to what seems to be an airport hanger. Two huge bouncers are flanking the door: one is purple and the other honestly looks like Chewbacca. Tony is trying very hard not to stare and geek out.
"Look at you," Tony says. He's definitely pleased by what he sees, which makes Steve proud. "You'll see, baby, I'm going to take good care of you."
Tony turns to him with wide eyes. "Ah, shoot, sorry. Naps fu- huh, mess me up."
"Because Tony is ridiculous and should never be in charge of naming anything," Rhodey says.
"Huh, so it wasn't a joke," Viv blurts out, before putting her hand in front of her mouth and blushing.
At this moment in time, Tony feels as if all that he can offer is a one-night stand, and he can’t offer that to Steve. So he will take Cherie to a chic hotel, or maybe to her place, and have fun with no promises or expectations on either side. No messing his own bed or the bed of someone he cares about.
"He looks healthy. Maybe his parents were in danger and sent him here to protect him." Steve is grasping at straws. He has no idea what happened either.
That makes Tony perk up. "Rhodey? How is he doing?"
He might have holes in his memories, but Tony's confident that his core traits haven't changed. Protecting people, especially the ones he cares about, is what he strives to do. It wouldn't make any sense to build technology so advanced and versatile that’s coded to him only.
"What?"
The first thing that Tony does when he gets up is seek out Steve. He finds him exercising in the cargo section. Normally he would take a second to admire the flawless push-ups, but he's not in that kind of mood. Anyhow, Steve hears him enter the room, and he jumps to his feet and stands almost at parade rest, looking at Tony with concern. He looks so genuinely guilty that Tony's anger abates a little. When Tony speaks, it's a lot softer than he thought he'd be.
"Ha!" Tony crows. "You've got that right, honey! Still, I should have installed a T-bar."
"I know, I know," Steve replies, raising his hands. "Can't blame a guy for hoping."
"You should hang up, baby," Steve says softly.
"I'm sorry," Tony says. "Of course. I just feel like everyone keeps pushing the past in your face, as if the only thing interesting about you is your glory days in World War 2."
"Yes, you can. Don't tease, you've got me all wound up, sweetheart."
Steve's determined expression confirms the hopelessness of any escape attempts as he all but snarls and grabs Tony's forearm too in order to pull back harder. "No."
The well-deserved compliment and gratitude make Steve happy and he breaks out in a beaming smile.
"Oh, all right," she says, getting up. "I am sorry, Mister Stark. I didn't see the time pass."
"I'm happy for you guys," she says. "It's important that we stay together now."
"Well done, everyone!" Steve shouts. He's damn proud to be the captain of this exceptional group of players he's lucky to call friends. Family, even. "Good game!"
"Thanks," Steve says, throwing an apologetic look Sam's way. He shouldn't have snapped. "You guys rest, alright? It's been a rough two weeks."
"Come on babe," Tony says, undoing his earlier steps. "Let's go check the control room and see if Zemo brought anything. I'll prod the consoles too." He didn't even think to grab Zemo's phone.
He looks just about ready to cry and that's unacceptable, even if it would be from happiness. Tony leans down to kiss his fiancé—he's engaged!—and it's soon not enough. He needs to be closer, he's missed Steve so much. Tony slides down to straddle Steve's thighs, then doesn't stop there. He puts a hand behind Steve's head and uses the other to gently but firmly push Steve down until he's lying on his back. Tony's using some of his Kree-acquired super strength and Steve visibly notices, as his eyes widen.
Tony had been certain Steve was going to bench him. He'd gestured to his screen.
"That sounds fun!"
"You take it so well."
Jim is probably not even out of the kitchen when Steve reaches for Tony's hand, thrilled when he interlocks their fingers. Steve's heart is racing and fluttering in his chest.
he needs to relax into it. He'll get there.
"Thank you." Somehow, Tony interrupting him seems to have made Steve relax a bit. "It struck me that in four of the five different realities, if we don't count the Old West, I made it to the future. Even the one universe where we didn't see me, Reed said that I was there at one point."
Instead of grabbing a water bottle and slipping out, Steve strides into the kitchen as if he's not been eavesdropping for the last five minutes. Tony now has Jim's black swim trunks on with no shirt, and he looks downright fantastic. Steve longs to one day be allowed to reach and touch him, and not just steal a few glances.
"Someone will be here soon," Steve says, keeping his voice low. It hurts to see how Tony slumps, mouth down-turned.
"Anthony, we need to follow the plan!"
Tony and JARVIS sent the information on the now-dead super soldiers and Zemo to Rhodey and Pepper on their way back. Hopefully there's enough to smooth things out with the UN and the lesser-Ross.
"Not a problem."
"Shut up," Tony grumbles.
"It will be all right, honey," Tony says, kneading Steve's shoulders and neck. He's been hyper-focused from the moment Carol warned them of the Kree's imminent arrival.
"It's fine. I'm glad you'll be with me from now on. With us, where you belong, even without Iron Man. I've missed you. We all did."
"Agreed," Reed says. "It was a very close call."
"You're just a mother hen," Tony says, finishing his fries.
Mora leads them to a small house in the garden, set up to host dignitaries.
Like most of the team, Tony plays in Half State on defense, humanoid but for his short spotted fur, little round ears and tail. He and the other cats have incredible reflexes, and SHIELD is renowned as having one of the best defenses in the league. But where Tony shines the most is when he runs the bases. He obviously has to bat in Half State. But as soon as he makes contact, he leaps and transforms in a second to hit the ground running on four legs in order to speed towards first base. And, well, often to second, third or more if the ball breaches the infield. In twenty games so far, Tony has stolen twenty five bases and managed a whooping ten inside-the-park home runs. He also got caught a few times because he went too fast and got himself stuck behind a teammate that doesn't round the bases as fast as he does. He's learning though, and getting better every game. It's no surprise that Tony amassed quite a crowd of rabid fans- Steve included.
Tony wets his lower lips and Steve's blue eyes follow the movement, making desire flare up in Tony's gut. Steve looks like a man parched and in reach of an oasis, or maybe more appropriately like a wolf ready to pounce on a prey. Tony still voices a warning, just in case.
"Navive?"
Steve blinks and lets go of Tony's arm with one hand to take out his phone, but the fool doesn't let go with the other. It's infuriating. And even though Tony is doing his best to pull back from the portal too, the endgame feels inevitable: he's going in. Meanwhile, it's like being in a tug-o-war between two immense forces, and the strain on his shoulder is excruciating. He never should have stepped out of the armor to investigate the console; now there's only his squishy human body taking all of this pressure and being almost quartered.
He looks so fond, loving even, and it opens a pit of yearning in Tony's gut. God, he wants Steve so much, and it far exceeds physical attraction. At this moment, his soul longs for Steve's quiet strength, big heart, and everything else that makes this stubborn man exceptional. The way he's looking right back at Tony as if he's the best thing he's ever seen is a snare impossible to resist. It's the most natural thing in the world for Tony to lean in and gently kiss Steve.
"That's fine with you?"
"But have I?" he asks instead.
Once they have immobilized and disarmed the spaceships, Carol and Tony start flying through them, not unlike hot knives through butter, making them explode. Thankfully, they're distant enough from Earth that the debris shouldn't fall through the atmosphere and cause problems. Tony does mentally apologize to astronomers everywhere though, who will have garbage in the way of their observations. On the other hand, he plans to salvage a lot of the material; the Krees use a metal that has no equivalent on Earth. But that's a job for future Tony. Right now he's pure destruction, though they let the manned space pods get away. They'll report to the Supreme Intelligence; hopefully the warning not to mess with Earth is clear.
"You're gorgeous," Tony marvels.
"Got to, ah! Fuck, yes, more. Got to stay interesting for a young stud like you! Hey. Why'd you stop?"
"I'm very happy you came to visit tonight, truly."
"How's business going?" Steve asks in hope for the conversation to take off.
"Callie, come on," Steve says, pulling a bit harder on the leash – which only drags the kitten along the floor about an inch.
"Okay okay, I hear you. Look, if you're genuinely uncomfortable, it's fine. We don't have to, okay? I just thought it would be fun, that's all."
"Okay then," Tony says when they separate. He slides a hand up to cup Steve's cheek, and is endeared when he turns into it to kiss Tony's wrist. "Maybe I'm less jealous of myself now."
"You knew someone killed my mom, both my parents—" Tony says, tone rising. He suddenly pauses as a few details click together. It unfortunately makes a perverse sort of sense. "It was Barnes, wasn't it? Who murdered them."
So Tony's in a hospital after all, or a clinic. The nurse, or maybe she’s a doctor, peers into his eyes with a little instrument that he's never seen before. The exam is a good idea because they aren't working right.
"As in the Addams Family?" Steve asks.
Now that the fog is dissipating, Tony approaches too and yes, that's not quite his Steve but it's close enough. Very handsome, of course. WIM-Tony runs to the unconscious Steve but doesn't seem to know what to do, gauntleted hands hovering. "Please be alive." He finally touches Steve's cheek, then his chest, so very carefully.
"If you think they're cute in pictures, you won’t believe how hard it is to resist them in person," Steve says.
Before Tony can react, Steve leans down and touches their lips together in a careful kiss. It's very sweet, and Steve's face is cautiously hopeful when he pulls back to scan Tony's expression.
"Yeah, minor setback. Now, where were we?"
"Probably because she noticed my mooning over you. She told me you might be single, but she'd always be in your life, and close at that. If I couldn't accept that, then I should forget even making my interest known."
Their precome makes the glide easier and Tony's just so, so close.
"Maybe later," Nat says. Steve's never seen her disclose a vulnerability this clearly before.
"Tony?" Steve asks at some point.
Steve nods. "Okay. Do you think you could let me know, if it drags on? I'll worry."
"See? Not only brawn but brains, so sexy of you," Tony says, grinning.
"Oh," Tony says. "Big battle, I suppose."
"When are we due for the other planet?" he asks instead.
"Yeah. Still flushed. Lips swollen from the kisses and when you bit them, trying not to cry out. Hair a mess. And you reek of sex, even with a wipe down. When you get out of here, everyone who looks at you will know that you've just been fucked."
"That's it, come on," Steve encourages, fucking in with strong but shallow thrusts. "Please, Tony, please, let go for me."
The sun is up now, and Tony hears movement in the kitchen. The girls are up. They're expected for breakfast with the Iantusians, so Tony will have to deal with his emotions later. For the moment, he’ll stuff everything into a neat little mental box and do what has to be done.
"He convinced the girl and her brother Pietro, a speedster, that Hydra had lied to them. That the Avengers really meant to do good in the world. Speaking of Clint, we learned he has a wife and three kids on a farm in Missouri."
"Sure you don't."
"Yes, that's it!" Vers, on the contrary, is smiling and excited. "Exactly it. What's your name?"
"Yes!" Tony raises his left hand—the one Steve is still holding, in fact. "We're engaged!"
Tony looks their way and immediately scowls, and that's when Steve sees that Snowball is in the pool. His own reaction is immediate protectiveness and anger too. How dare they put her in the water?
"Yeah?" Steve feels like preening.
"Thank God. You have- Thank God. Steve—" Tony's voice cracks. There's anguish in his tone and Steve's heart squeezes to hear it.
That's nice, and Steve is very pleased. There's a slight problem, though, that he voices out loud.
"Why is this the first time I’m hearing this?" Anthony asks.
The Krees had to be expecting the Avengers to be present. But it's Avengers and friends today, and it's beautiful to see.
"But you didn't," Tony says, snidely because he's hurt and angry that Steve is sorry in retrospect.
Steve snorts in amusement. "Tell me about it, that last Steve is one lucky bastard. Plus I wanted to wallop that idiot me who was in the machine so bad for being mean to you. And punch Bucky in the face."
"So, I noticed that you didn't mention Asgard on the tour list," Tony says, peeling off the wrapper of his oat, nuts, and apple bar. "I suppose Thor is taking care of it?"
As planned, Nat and Clint engage the Starforce, but let a few go through. Tony expects that in a few minutes a second team will attack. For now, though, three Krees have reached the door. The camera in the corridor shows them as they stop, confirm that what they want is through the war room, and place a small explosive charge on the lock.
"Nice fireworks, guys!" Rhodey says.
"What is it?" Nat asks.
"How many?" Steve asks.
"Understood. Thank you, Captain." She sounds approving, and it comforts Steve in his decision.
He's just gotten to his knees, reluctantly throwing the pistol a few feet forward—hopefully close enough to dive on it if needed—when the growl rises again. It's now five times louder than before and absolutely terrifying. In response, the Hydra soldiers lose interest in Tony and all point their rifles towards the sound… that is moving, circling the camp.
Yes, there was bad blood between them and loads of hurt. But he remembers processing that hurt over time, moving past it, forgiving. And now there’s so much good. Limitless potential for more.
"Then we better make a good impression," Steve said.
"Yeah?" The words suffuse a soft glow in Steve's chest. "I'll do whatever you want," he promises. He trusts Tony to make it good.
"Glad of it," Tony says. He lets his smile sharpen. "Thanos had it coming when he messed with us."
"See? It's fine. Are you his bodyguard or what?" he asks.
"You what now?" Kol asks.
Steve's eyes are sparkling with mischief as he shrugs off his harness, and wiggles out of the top of his uniform before attacking the fastening of his pants.
"I disagree," Steve chimes in. "You rotate between Marvel, The Marvel, emphasis on 'The,' or Captain. But never Cap."
He can't wait to see him fall apart.
Steve shakes his head. "I think… They appear to be a bit translucent to me."
"You're going to be the death of me!' Tony says once he's painted Steve's tongue and cheeks with his release. Hell, Steve nearly got some in an eye, it's caught in his eyelashes. "Such a good boy, you're perfect."
"He looks happy," Natasha remarks.
"We do, to my surprise," Nebula says with a huff. "And now that we’ve exchanged platitudes, you should rest." She grabs Tony's upper arm and tugs. "Come, I'll guide you to your quarters."
That fills Anthony with pride; he longs for the Supreme Intelligence's approval so badly.
Tony frowns. "Of course not. I wouldn't do that! And that's at a minimum twelve weeks from now. Are you going on a long mission?"
Steve's grinning, though, as he squirts a big dollop of lube directly onto his own cock. He quickly spreads it and can't seem to resist fucking his own fist a few times. He's been focusing on Tony for a long time, after all.
"I've been trying to find the nerves to ask you out for months," Steve says with a half-smile. "Intimate works for me."
He gathers all of his strength to burn the hottest he can manage as he takes flight, going straight towards Vers. Anthony only has one shot, and he knows it. Focusing all of his power, he fires a photo beam at center mass. Unfortunately, Vers sees him coming at the last second and evades. But the beam connects anyway. Vers' eyes go wide as her energy is extinguished and she drops to the ground into one of the craters that dot the planet Xoria.
He looks as if he means it. But as much as Steve hated the distance of the last few months, he knows that it's best that Tony took some time for himself. Now that he's closed the door on Pepper, has processed the tragedy with his parents – though eventually they'll find Bucky, and that won't be easy – and he got some rest away from Iron Man. Better to jump back in, hopefully, but Steve can wait until Tony's ready.
"Good question." Tony is visibly dealing with the same conundrum.
"Huh," Tony says, looking down at the reactor. He feels
"Do you think he realizes how he's crushing on Tony? Badly?" Sam asks.
"You okay?" Tony asks.
"Like the Muses or the Graces?" Tony cocks his head, considering. Steve doesn't know why he's constantly surprised when Tony shows him that he's knowledgeable in subjects other than science and pop culture.
"I'll go choose a movie now!"
“I’m fierce!” Lilly protests, making Tony chuckle.
"Yeah?" Steve asks.
"One! Two!"
"Thanks." Steve says, almost guiltily. Is he invading Tony's privacy? Surely FRIDAY would object if he was. Or tell Tony, which makes Steve squirm in embarrassment. But she stays quiet as Tony continues his work.
"It's me." Steve relaxes, recognizing the voice. "Tony Stark."
As he won't be able to avoid a conversation forever, Tony gets out of the suit once he’s in the plane and starts preparing it for take off. This plan might not be fully thought out, but it's the best he has. He opens the hangar doors and rolls the Quinjet out, its back hatch lowered for his travel companions. It doesn't take very long before they board the aircraft. Maybe they talked strategy on the way over, because Barnes stays in the cargo bay as Steve slowly approaches the cockpit.
"Tony, please," Steve says, leaning down for a filthy kiss again.
"Really? That's what you're going with?"
"Yeah! It's not the end of the evening I hoped for, but that's life for you," he says with a mock pout, clearly taking it in stride.
"They must have had help," Tony says.
He finally pushes in his finger to the first knuckle and yeah, that's more like it. Tony is ready to plead again—he needs more—but Steve kisses down his body, intent clear.
Now it's Steve who's lost. "What? How old were you?"
Clearly Steve has come to the same conclusion, and after chewing on his bottom lip he speaks up. "We should get going?"
"Did you experience unsatisfied urges lately, Mister Rogers?" Tony teases, leaning down for a closed-mouthed peck.
"Is that dancing I see over there?' Tony says, craning his neck.
"Tony..." When Steve reached for his hand again, Tony had stepped away, crossing his arms.
"Move over, blue jay," Tony tells Nebula, nudging her with his shoulder.
"I think he got it," Steve says, seeing how DUM-E is all but vibrating in place, more restrained than he's ever seen him when he’s doing something. "What about having FRIDAY project images of the kittens on a screen he can watch?"
"Hi." Tony shakes his head in amusement. "Unbelievable. Are all werewolves this polite?"
"Shit, oh my God. Okay, okay." Steve puts a hand over his mouth for a moment, eyes scanning Tony. "I suppose something happened and you're stuck like this."
"I'm imagining a mechanical horse," Steve says. "A fancy automaton."
"Sure, do you have one in mind?"
"Yeah?" He hadn't dared to ask.
"I wondered if the Supreme Intelligence would allow you to come, Yon-Rogg," Tony says. Beside him Steve stills, focusing on the man.
"You're saying that if Lilly dies, I die?" Steve asks, appalled. The stoat makes a distressed sound and runs back to him.
"Shut up. But back in New York, I didn't want to take the chance of facing Steve either, so I went to see Fury. I asked him if he had a mission for me, as making stuff blow up would have been a fantastic way to pass my excess aggression."
"Steve found these kittens," Tony says. "Just babies. Is there a vet close by?"
Fair enough; dealing with Fury is a pain even on good days. Steve has to bite his tongue not to reply:
"Rogers, that I've heard," Carol says.
"Ohhh!" Peter exclaims. "Another one in the bug family! Black Widow, Spider-Man, now Ant-Man—"
," he promises fervently.
Tony turns wide brown eyes to him, an eyebrow raising in surprise. "Really?"
Tony grins. That's when he knows he's made an actual friend: when they’re not just tolerating his shit but also actively enjoying the ride and everything that he is.
to be her. Also, Anthony can't seem to muster nearly as much vindictive energy for his father, which clearly makes him a terrible son.
"When did you learn about it?" Tony asked.
"Sounds ominous."
He's trying to exercise restraint right now. As tempting as it is to sit Tony on the counter, slide between his knees and go to town on him, Steve wants to pace himself. Add a little romance and show Tony that not only does he absolutely adore his bubble butt, but that he wants to spoil him too.
Tony looks up to see Steve holding the ring up with a small smile and understanding eyes. It's a reminder of everything happy and good that is to come, and how the past is just that, the past, and it can't hurt Tony anymore that it already did. God, Tony loves Steve so much.
This seems like a vigil, but they aren’t in a hospital. There's no equipment, no medicine—no hospital smells and sounds either—and Tony feels perfectly fine, without even a headache. Is it a hotel? It makes no sense that Steve would watch over him while he sleeps. But then again, Tony doesn't recall how he got here at all. The last thing he remembers is how he worked on the armor after a board meeting—always a good way to vent his frustrations— and then went to bed. At a reasonable hour too.
The statement rubs Steve the wrong way. Of course he'd adopt one if Tony wanted to keep only half of the pair. He'd protest out loud, but then Rhodes adds: "He wouldn't have a ready excuse to go to the Tower anymore."
"I am hurt that you miss me so little, you do not even speak of me to your friends," the winged lioness tells Thor. Because of course she talks too.
"There's no rush," Steve murmurs, kissing Tony's cheek, then his neck.
"It was amazing," he stammers out. "Beautiful."
"Yes," Carol says. "And I have suggestions. Shall we begin the meeting?"
Well, the asshole is welcome to try again, because Tony is convinced of one thing. With him and Steve united and backed by their friends like today? They can do anything. They'll be ready.
It pleases the lady greatly. "As I told Mister Stark, I am very glad to hear it. And you are welcome to dance until morning if you wish to do so!"
"What the hell? You find this funny?"
The plan was for JARVIS to run all of his armors, but maybe that's not how it turned out. Tony's gut warns him not to ask too many questions, especially with the worry on Steve's face at the moment. Something happened to JARVIS, most likely. It's best that he doesn't learn about it right this second to avoid another anxiety attack. Tony will pretend, for now, that JARVIS just isn’t in this suit but is safely back on Earth.
His prayers are answered when Steve turns to look in his direction with a frown. Encouraged, Tony increases his efforts and cheers as Steve finally gets out of bed to investigate.
"How did they do in the car?" Steve asks.
"I'm Lilly," the little stoat says. "I'm Steve's."
Tony chuckles. "Oh shit."
Cherie is forward in a way Tony has always appreciated. Clear signals, fun banter, light touches but not too aggressive. She's a marketing director with tons of entertaining stories, brilliant, and a gorgeous dark-eyed blonde. She's recently separated too and looking for a distraction that Tony is very happy to provide.
"Demons?" Steve's eyes are wide.
"Lower the lights," the woman demands. "Hi there. You're restrained, and we blocked your powers for the moment, which sucks, I know. But we need to talk whenever you're ready."
Steve frowns, confused by the abrupt change in topic. "A few hours?"
"Sure," Tony says, still grinning. "Can't wait! We can talk about my list of names. I have opinions."
With a contented warmth suffusing his chest, Tony lets his eyes slip shut. He just needs to rest for a few minutes.
Tony's lucky that it was Steve holding vigil because waking up as an amnesiac on an alien planet without an arc reactor and surrounded by only strangers would have been terrifying. A shiver of unease travels down his spine just thinking about it.
After a last squeeze, Steve had stepped back, then pulled Tony to the workshop's couch where they sat side by side. His face was puffy and red, but at least he'd stopped crying.
Tony doesn't have time to follow that conversation. Instead, he points at the shield still on the ground as he takes flight and hovers for a second.
The goal is to catch the Kree force in a pincer movement. At the front is Nat, Clint, Steve, and Tony, but also Ant Man, who suddenly turns gigantic. Tony knows that the Wasp is there too, but too small for him to see. On the sides are T'Challa with his warriors and the Dora Milaje, plus Spider-Man, who swings through the canyon webbing Kree after Kree. The kid is gifted, for sure. Two platoons of Asgardians warriors who came with Thor are also very enthusiastically kicking ass. Barnes is on the other side of the battle with Pietro, and the both of them are without a doubt thorns in the Kree's backside at the moment.
"Yeah." Steve admits. What is making Steve's heart beat faster is how good Tony is with the boy. He did not know that seeing Tony with kids would make him all flustered. To be fair, Tony does that to him with almost anything. "Adorable."
"Everyone in the universe has one," Thor says.
"Got it," Steve says. He's sure he has the right bag, the tiny sound clear this time when it's jostled.
But it's not only the kittens. Steve spends the weekend hanging out with Tony, and they have a fantastic time. Before Steve is entirely ready for it, three days have passed and work calls. It's with a heavy heart that he packs his bag and goes for a last visit to the workshop.
"Thanks."
Tony finally caves and dancing and having a few—okay a lot—of drinks do seem to make things easier, for a moment. But then all he can see are the happy couples around him, and his heart hurts again.
"Yes, and everyone's fine," Tony says, trying to avoid too many questions.
"If you're certain?"
"All set!"
"Happily." Steve looks very pleased at that, which is great, but Tony is careful to relativize his expectations (he's learned a thing or two from previous experiences). "I'll return as soon as I can, but it might take a few days, especially if Victor is smart enough to hide."
Carol nods, approving. "Full bird?" Tony grins proudly, and she smiles back. "Good for him. You mean a suit like that little red and gold number I saw?"
By now, preparing the syringes and the milk is almost automatic, having done it five times before going to bed. Feeding the two babies one after the other is different, but it goes very well. Being left hungry and alone in the incubator outrages the black kitten, and she meows until it's her turn.
"Sam is Captain America," Steve breathes out, voicing Tony's very thought.
There was no mistaking it; the brazen little hussy was showing off. Not that Tony blamed her; he'd love to capture Steve's attention like that. And it was almost as if he could feel Steve's gentle fingers on his own skin as he caressed Cora's primary feathers, and it felt wonderful.
"Gotta say, that sounds pretty badass."
Curious, Tony seeks out texts with the other Avengers. His last exchange with Bruce is close to the top and has notes about tissue regeneration. He swallows with difficulty when he opens Natasha's conversation and sees that her second-to-last bubble says, "It's going to work, Shellhead" to which he replied, "Of course, what do you take me for?". She then ended the conversation and the thread itself with an emoji blowing a kiss. It's from nine weeks ago. He scrolls back to see they've had sporadic contact in the last five years, polite but with barely any banter. At least it got better in the last few weeks before her death. Something about that makes Tony uneasy, but then again he had retired and was busy raising a kid, so that might be it.
"You keep making no sense. Why would you be sorry?"
"I am aware, Cap, thank you," Tony says. "No, Tal, we're leaving. Take care."
Which is true: adding romance to his relationship with Pepper had been a complication, as much as Tony longed for them to work. He isn’t even shocked that she'd moved on rapidly and is happy for her since Pepper deserves the best.
That makes Steve bristle as he observes Zemo through the reinforced window. "You killed innocent people in Vienna just to bring us here?"
"Come up here then," Tony says, tapping his breastbone. "I want to suck you."
Tony smiles at him. "That's better. You didn't smell like roses for a while there."
Steve, more beautiful than ever, is holding a bouquet of sunflowers, a backpack at his feet.
"Ah!" Tony exclaims, but then has to smile at how proud of itself the wolf is looking, eyes bright and tail still thumping on the ground. Gingerly, Tony sits up, annoyed at his head that is throbbing and the nausea that immediately hits. "I hope that was not just to sample how I taste."
"Plus I grew up here," Bucky says, smiling at Mechanic-Tony.
Fine, Tony should have had the "actually, I'm a vampire" conversation with Steve months ago, before he found himself stuck in bat form like this. But it had been fun to play the slow reveal with the seduction game. Tony hasn't been this attracted to anyone since the sixties, and he wanted to savor it. But he now needs Steve's help, and there's no more time for obfuscation or being mysterious.
"Thank you for this gift," Tony says. "You're amazing."
"I love it here. It's amazing. Too bad the commute is so long. Also, I have people back home."
"I like Bella," Steve says. Tony had crooned at the babies in Italian a few days before, and the endearment had struck a chord in Steve's enamored heart. "But since you mentioned the Muses, it got me thinking and I keep coming back to Calliope." She held the highest rank, and sometimes the white kitten acts as if she's the most important being in the room. "Would you like that, Princess?" Steve asks the kitten, who's already finished with her two syringes of milk and is in a total food coma. "Calliope?"
Tony hums. "That's an important decision."
As for the notes and blueprints… Well, they lost those in the explosion. But Tony has an excellent memory, especially if it's something he's built once. Combine that with Talos' machine, and Tony recreated the plans for the core of the light-speed engine pretty easily. It's meant as bait for the Kree, but it's also just as fascinating and a game changer as it was two years ago. Tony has to restrain himself sometimes not to fall into the rabbit hole of concentrating on that project alone.
"Don't mention it. Oh, and after, I'm taking you out. There's a nice little Greek place on 7th Street, you'll love their Pastitsio."
Anthony shrugs at the dig. "I guess so."
"In real life? Yes, absolutely. You're a control freak. But sometimes very commanding people want a break, where they relinquish that authority to someone else. To clear their mind, because they don't have to think anymore. I believe you'd like that a lot."
Tony lets his eyebrows rise; not to toot his own horn, but that's pretty impressive. Fucking time travel. "Well, would you look at that?"
It's true that he's not sober, but it just gave him the courage to act on his desires. "I know what I want, Tony. Trust me."
"Yeah!" Peter beams at him. "Like this."
"I don't think so. We put Earth on the map and they're curious already. If we play this right, they'll at least be cautious," Carol says. "A little fight where we kick ass is all it takes."
"That's anticlimactic," Clint says as a joke. For certain everyone has relaxed.
Tony waits as he chews his power bar. They do taste good.
"From the Guardians," Steve explains, noticing Tony’s confusion.
Steve hasn't texted in forever, not even after Tony left him a worried voicemail three hours ago. Thankfully Natasha just sent a message: Steve broke his phone and is getting a new one.
"Thanks," Tony says when he finishes it. "Haven't eaten a burger in a while."
"I think we'd need different zip codes," Tony says.
"No mention of them. Thor was inconsolable, blamed himself, said you should have had aids—"
His fur is so soft! Taken by surprise, Steve freezes. He doesn't react in time to catch Tony in a hug and too soon he's bounding away, leaping on Rhodes next.
Steve grins when there's immediate meowing from the box. He's absolutely certain that it's Snowball, even if it's a lot louder and affirmative than the last time Steve heard her. And lo and behold, after a few seconds, a small black head with round blue eyes pops out of the house, yelling still.
"I love you," he says back—or anew, it's not important—and it's likely a good start because Steve looks soft, loved and content.
It's simple: Tony needs to get in, and he wants Steve to turn him back to his human—or rather vampire—form. But Tony cannot enter Steve's home because he was never invited explicitly, and how can Steve fix him if he doesn't know Tony's in trouble in the first place? It's so, so frustrating, and Tony starts hitting his head against the window frame.
Grinding his hips against Tony, making his eyes roll back in pleasure, is a good way to answer in Steve's opinion. "Do I look unsure?"
"Nice to see you, Cap," Rhodes replies as they shake gloved hands.
"I promise," Tony says solemnly. "He won't catch me unaware again, and he doesn't stand a chance against my friends and I."
She doesn't look enthused.
"I enjoy some of it, but I don't need it to be happy in a relationship," Tony says.
Could it be? God. So much is happening, and Anthony's usual coping mechanisms rear up. With no control over the situation, he reverts to humor.
“I’m sorry, friends, I did not know.” Thor looks surprised.
"I don't know what that is!" Anthony complains.
The entire team whoops in delight when the ref shouts that Rumlow is out, and the SHIELD fans in the stands go wild. Hell, Steve imagines his mother is freaking out right now, she's always been a very vocal supporter. It always feels extra good to beat Hydra, and this is a beautiful ending to a harshly disputed game. Steve trots to the infield where his teammates are celebrating, ruffling Bucky's hair as soon as he's in range.
It's a video that was shot in a lab, judging by the workstations and various holograms. There are several people in the periphery including Rhodey—it's immensely reassuring to see him—but what Steve focused on while filming is Tony arguing with… is that a dressed-up racoon? That talks?
Since the early 1800s, every ten or twenty years Victor leaves the Old Countries for a gander at taking control of the Eastern Seaboard's magic users and supernatural creatures. Until now his efforts were systematically crushed by Tony and his allies, and he'd retreated to Latveria. After twenty-five years without a peep, he'd written to Tony to formally request a treaty. But you can't teach an old dog new tricks: it wasn't a peaceful overture at all.
"Bullshit," Steve protests with a scoff. "You know how to navigate those people with your eyes closed."
"In Washington, there was a special Hydra operative. Well trained, very tough, gave us a hard time. They call him the Winter Soldier. And it's Bucky. Bucky Barnes." Steve was searching his face, wondering if the name meant something to Tony.
"Nah," Tony says, just as Nebula replies with a resounding "No."
. Now that he breathes in slowly, Tony realizes that he can distinguish that memory from the present.
"It's an order," Steve says, then raises his voice and as he touches his ear piece again. "Back here, NOW."
The almost soundless detonation makes the door open, revealing the Krees. Steve is standing in front of Tony and then Wanda, shield raised protectively.
"I'm sure it will be." Tony hopes his smile looks confident.
"That's an excellent suggestion, thank you," Steve says.
"Yes," Tony says, caressing his face and marveling that he can have this. Heck, a love declaration is the first thing Steve says in the morning. "I love you too."
"No one asked you," Tal replies with an eye roll.
Again, Tony is blown away and has to rethink everything when the wolf very clearly shakes its head no, going left and right several times. It also stays flat on the ground, as if to look less menacing for Tony, even though it's so huge the top of its back is as high as Tony sitting up.
"You are welcome. We are grateful that order was restored, and if we can be of assistance…" The delivery lacks conviction, but it’s a definite win nonetheless. The Sovereign are so prideful, they wouldn't go back on their word, once given, without losing face.
"Ah, no, I'm sorry honey, I'll tell you. It's just embarrassing. I'm blaming the whole mix up on my post-nap daze, okay?"
"I am Iron Man," he says, giving a command to the nanites forming his clothes to change shape.
He's not sure he'd be able to trust Steve with his heart, after learning all of this. He should take comfort in knowing they made up, but emotions don't listen to logic. He really needs to process it all.
"I'm so confused." Other-Steve looks like it too, poor thing.
"I'd like to put a hold on those answers, if you don't mind. Tomorrow?"
"And then we didn't talk for two years," Steve says. "Until Thanos, when he was collecting the stones."
"What the hell is going on?" Tony exclaims.
"It's so good, I won't last," Steve admits.
It had made Tony cry, and it still does sometimes when he re-reads them. Fine, he cries almost every time he rereads them, and that's how he starts and ends each day, even though he'd memorized the texts by the time he'd reached his rented room.
"When you clearly knew the answer," Tony snaps, going towards the coffee maker.
The sudden pain, added to the desire in Tony's eyes and the confidence he projects, sends a bolt of lust to Steve's core. He moans as he realizes that yes, this works. This works so much, Steve craves to do whatever Tony wants.
"Finally!" Nat says as it connects. She sounds exasperated, and Steve knows there will be hell to pay for dodging her for the last hour. Irresponsible, maybe, but he knew this was coming, and he wanted at a few precious last minutes with the kittens. And Tony.
"I decide when you're ready."
"Good move," Memory-Anthony says with approval.
"Whoa, alright," Tony says when they have to break the kiss in need of oxygen. Desire has blown his pupils wide open, making his eyes darker than usual and even more mesmerizing. "I would have moved back months ago if I'd known this was on offer!"
"So that's not bad, right?" Tony can't help but say, playing innocent.
Steve steps in to pull Tony into his arms and they hug for a long minute. Tony relishes how solid Steve is, how tall, strong, and protective. It's done now. The Krees tried to take him again but failed, because Tony had his team, his friends, at his back. For the first time since he returned to Earth four weeks ago, Tony allows himself to relax.
Tony freezes, slowly leaning up to look at Steve as he’s certain a smile takes over his entire face. "Yes, just like Spock! I can't believe I didn't realize it until you said it. How cool is that?"
"It's nothing," Steve says.
Howard got his mother killed for this shit. The pendulum of emotions is exhausting.
The End
"Sure," Tony says, casual as anything while Steve is on the verge of a heart attack. Tony, who was rubbing his nose on the baby's cheek, then stills and looks up at Steve with widened eyes. "Wait a second; take me out? As in a date?"
'How many times have I told you that you're ridiculous today?"
"I will," Tony says.
"Thank you. But my question is, do you understand this message?" Tony asks, with a large gesture meant to encompass the battle around them and above. "Earth is off limits, is that clear? All we want is for you to leave us alone."
Tony laughs. "I know, right?"
For a second he worries that Steve will suggest some activity or other, since they've already watched this movie together a few months back. Perhaps he'll want to train, or go out to eat instead of re-watching The Return of the King.
"Fine." She huffs, then immediately perks up. "Hey, Lilly, I have an idea! Why don't you hop on my back?"
Gosh, it takes a second, but it comes to him. "Pretty great. The Air Force has recently promoted him to colonel. He pilots the War Machine armor I made for him."
"Great. See you then," Maria says before hanging up.
Steve’s eyes linger a second on Tony's hair. Tony pats it down and realizes it's all over the place.
Fine. Tony walks towards the fields and forest just outside of the village on purpose. If a certain unit decided to camp by themselves, it would make sense they'd go there. Hopefully.
As fantastic as the armor is, it can't protect his squishy brain from bouncing against his own skull. The next thing he's aware of, Tony is flat on his back and blinking to get the world— currently pretty blurry—back in focus. Shit, his ears are even ringing.
Tony realizes with a jolt that he hasn’t seen any kids since they arrived. They've been on official visits and then a diplomatic banquet and party, but there weren’t any children in the streets either. Not even teenagers. Suddenly Tony feels a lot more sober. Maybe Almar reads the discomfort on his face because her expression turns wry.
Steve laughs at his misery, too. This is one of the most humiliating moments of Tony's very, very long life. At least he'll go after having made this beautiful man happy, even for a moment.
"You did it, Boss, nothing left on the urgent list."
"Thanks," Tony says.
There's way too much text blacked out for a soldier simply writing to his friend. Tony is certain that it has to do with Captain America and a secret mission.
Steve whips off his t-shirt, then sits down on his heels and looks up at Tony, wondering what he'll ask for now.
There's a defiant light in Steve's eyes, as if he's daring Tony to acknowledge why they both stayed silent.
"Of course. We had a skirmish with a group of Krees, another race of aliens. Let's just say our friends Carol and Nebula, the ones we're traveling with, aren’t fans and the feeling is mutual. During the fight, you received an energy blast to the head while protecting Nebula. You're lucky the armor took the hit and that it didn't kill you on the spot."
Steve giggles and blushes, which is so adorable that Tony can't resist one more second. He grabs Steve's upper arm to halt him, then steps close, chest to chest, only to raise his other hand to cup Steve's cheek. He can feel the werewolf's pulse racing under his pinkie finger.
He'll give everything he's got and show them again how powerful he is; the champion the Krees need.
Rhodey frowns. "That doesn't make sense. Why would they not stay here with the troops?"
"That do?" It's clean and soft, better than Steve expected.
"And I cloak it, I know," she says. "They won't get to it."
"You feel so, so good. So tight and hot." Seve kisses him then, soft at first and then more forcefully when Tony opens up for him. There's a tinge of bitterness on Steve's tongue that Tony recognizes as his precome and it's incredibly erotic.
Dammit.
"Good," Steve says. He has a feeling that he won't relinquish all control willingly, if that's even what Tony wants. It's true they should talk about it, but he really, really wants Tony right now. "Can I suck your dick now? You're hard. We've done that before. I want it. No need to make it complicated."
Anthony does his best to cling to the conversation, to keep a grasp on consciousness, but the sounds ebb in and out. There's a sharp pain in his head that ends up throbbing below his temples, and a sudden image of a golden city takes over his mind. It's beautiful.
And that's a relief. He’s determined to get his memories back, but it would be terrible to have forgotten a significant other (though mainly for that person). Tony is glad he won't hurt someone like that.
Tony frowns, confused, just as the band plays Wagner's "Here Comes the Bride". He twists to see Iron Man walking down the aisle, holding Rhodey's arm. He's in full armor, though the visor is opened… and that's when Tony spots the glaring difference between him and this Tony. It's him, but also not at all since the person being given away by Rhodey as Steve's bride is a woman. She put a little veil on the helmet which looks slightly silly, but also cheeky and like something he'd do as a joke too.
"No, you're perfect. So good, so good."
Steve welcomes them with a smile, and a wave of love and fondness washes over Tony. Upon touching ground by his side, Tony squeezes Steve's arm, who bends in for a quick kiss.
But then he has an idea that makes him perk up. He turns towards T'Challa.
"Holy shit! You son of a bitch!" Rhodey says, before pushing him back to look at Tony's face, who blinks back his excess emotions and can't stop grinning in return. God, he missed him.
"Yeah, I've got it. I'll leave you the Krees inside." Carol says while rising up in the air.
Tony snorts. "I was just being nice."
"Yes! But you thanked me for a good time and left, so I thought… The sex was great, and you came back, so I was sure that was it for you."
He goes to his room, sits on his bed, but knows that even if he lay down, he wouldn’t get any sleep. Not keyed up like this. Tony reasons that he'll take a walk, and god willing, drain the energy and frustration out of his system.
"Pepper told me.”
"Yes, as a date. I like you a lot." Goodness, Steve has rarely felt this nervous.
Tony then scoops the cat out and puts her on the workshop floor, out of the kitten's enclosure. Snowball then proceeds to crawl towards DUM-E, who is hovering close by. The robot looks thrilled, lowering its head closer to the floor so the kitten can investigate.
Truly at peace and happy at last. Together.
"Oh," Tony says, looking pensive.
Then it's showtime, as he scoots forward and lines up, guiding his dick with one hand and gently petting Tony's leg, now hooked around his waist, with the other. Tony thought he was ready, and he is because Steve did a thorough job with the prepping, but taking his cock is still a
Tony's not sure if it's sarcasm or honest admiration—maybe a little of both—and he finds he likes it.
"Yours is eating fast," Tony says, peering at how quickly the syringe is emptying.
"Well, I'll be damned," Everett Ross mutters. Fury's supposed death was still on, then.
"Come on baby, come for me."
Jarons is the first to catch on and he whistles.
Att-Lass and the other scouts are shifting slowly towards a fighting position, and Tony knows the foreplay is almost over.
"That’s stupid. It's not your fault.”
"Yeah, yeah. I do what I can, I can't be everywhere at once," Carol replies with an eye roll.
Cora preens, and it makes something go sweet in Tony’s chest to see them like this.
"Great job, Warbird," Tony says.
"Just wait a second there, Tones, not too fast. What the hell happened for you to drop everything and go to Asgard, anyway?"
"Of course he is, idiot," he grumbles.
He smiles, more than ready for this new adventure.
"All set!"
God, Tony loves this man so much, and it's such a shame that they lost two years because of the stupid Krees. It makes him look down at Yon-Rogg with resentment.
The porch that wraps around the house makes it easy to reach the side that faces the lake. There's a small slope towards its iced surface, not very steep but angled enough to allow sliding down. That's where he finds Morgan, Peter, Rhodes and Tony, busy playing together. They're all bundled up in ski suits, hats, scarfs and mittens, and even from afar Steve can see their reddened cheeks.
"He looks up to you a lot," Steve continues. "You've been mentoring him. I think he's the reason you helped us figure out time travel, to get him back."
The first coherent thought Tony forms when he opens his eyes and glances around is that there sure is a lot of white. Ceiling, walls, floor, furniture, the bed he's lying in, the sheets, and his own shirt… all of it is white as snow. The only color at all, except for Tony's own skin, is Steve sitting in the chair beside the bed in jeans and a black T-shirt, his whole person popping out in the otherwise monochrome room. Cap is fast asleep, head bowed with his chin resting against his chest, massive arms crossed, and Tony takes a moment to observe him. He looks good, even had his hair cut. Steve should dress casually more often instead of wearing his old man clothes; it suits him.
"Stark?" Wilson asks, EXO-7 wings only then folding in on his back. By his side, Barnes looks nervous, glancing between all of Rhodey's crew, but mainly towards T'Challa.
"I'm sorry, but I'm old and feeble in comparison." He could push Steve around a bit, sure, but only if Steve wants to move. Which admittedly can be fun too.
Dina smiles reassuringly. "I believe you. We'll do more tests," she promises before leaving the room.
Okay, so they're doing this. Tony takes a deep breath. He’s aware that he might never walk away, and could change everything just to keep Steve close.
"Or we were," he amends, thinking out loud. "I mean, we had given up on finding that secret Hydra bunker, concluding we had bad intel. But clearly they're nearby."
"Okay, agreed," Jim admits a few seconds later. "Good kinetic energy and well-aimed water direction."
"What?" Wanda stares at Steve in surprise.
"You totally want babies with me, now," Tony crows.
No movement at all, save for her tail moving in soft swishes. As for Snowball, she has reached the helper bot and is rearing up, trying to catch the camera with a small paw. For the moment, she seems to have forgotten about being constricted.
"I think I found something," Tony says, pulling up a sheet from the pile.
"What are you sorry for?" Tony's voice is rough as he wipes come and spit from the corner of his mouth with the back of his hand.
T'Challa perks up and seems ready to sprint away, but Rhodey lifts his gauntlet, asking him to stay. There's a tense pause, and Tony wonders if their reunion will end up in an actual fist fight after all. But, without looking away from Tony, Steve puts a hand to his comm link.
"You did great, Tony," Steve says, snatching the glass of water from Carol and bringing it over.
"That would be really, really great," Steve says fervently.
Tony's not convinced fate is a thing, not to meet someone and fall for them. But he believes that Steve and him have a spark, and probably always do if they cross paths, whatever comes out of it. Steve's declaration gives very little space for a misunderstanding about his current feelings.
Tony's eyes are dark and burning, and a shiver goes down Steve's spine.
"That would be good, right?" Steve says, trying to cheer him up. "A new mom, new siblings."
"You've seen me cook before," Steve says. "I should manage Bruce's ginger chicken recipe just fine."
Switzerland is a beautiful country, and Geneva a pretty great city.
Steve is about to answer when Wilson and Barnes exit the terminal and walk in their direction.
"Yeah, that's new. Hands on your neck and get up. As I said, you're coming with us."
"You're stuck with me now, honey." Tony raises his left hand to show off his ring. That's still quite a thrill, and Steve's smile is beautiful.
"I am very sorry to interrupt Chancellor, Mister Stark. The council is waiting for you, madame."
Most of the nanites have been used to form Tony's street clothes: a zipped, lightly weaved red sweater under a black leather jacket, jeans, and boots. He left enough in the reactor to make it glow blue, though.
"Incoming," Steve relays on the comm link as Tony gets off his lap. "Seventeen for now. Hold your positions, follow the plan. Comms off unless emergency. Rogers, over."
"Tony? What's wrong?"
"You're welcome."
"Speaking of your girls," Steve says, “I'll have to tap out after the next feeding, but I'll come back at five."
Distantly Steve knows that Tony's right. On the other hand, he's incredulous. "You want to talk
"You're insatiable."
"There you go, buddy. Thank you."
"Oh, thank God. Thanks for coming!" Tony says.
"Tony, please," he says, catching her hand and tucking it in his elbow as they fall in step.
When Tony left, Steve tried to be as supportive of his choice as possible. He understood that Tony was tired, overworked and overstressed, especially with the guilt that came with Ultron's havoc. Steve hadn’t helped at all with his quick judgment and constant accusations at the time. But when everything’s said and done, all that Steve wants is for Tony to be happy. If Tony believes that he needs a break from the superhero life, so be it.
The frown on Steve's face abates a bit. "Still, they kept you against your will. They didn't hurt you?"
Pain explodes in his skull as Tony falls to the ground, bowled over by the blow. He's disoriented, but it's impossible to miss how a moment later all hell breaks loose. The monster that had been following Tony jumps into the camp with a vicious snarl, attacking the man who just hurt Tony by biting him in the neck. The soldier yells in terror, or at least he tries to before it cuts short and the others start shooting at the beast.
"I'm constantly watching them, Captain Rogers," FRIDAY confirms.
"Oh, no, please continue," Nebula says, tone dry. "I've never seen a chancellor this smitten."
"No! I won't let go!"
"So from that standpoint, working from Indiana makes sense," Sharon says.
"How old are they?" Sam asks. He's still in the water, forearms crossed on the cement ledge as he examines the babies.
Steve is pinking up, but he nods, seeming convinced. "I bought the ring a month in." He makes an amused but self-deprecating smile when Tony can only blink, shocked. "Even I know that's too quick. But I just want you to understand that I've always been serious about us."
"Show of strength and manhandling as a turn on. Check," Tony says.
The entire scene is vivid in Tony's head now, talking with Thor and Frigga about how touching a daemon only feels good when it's a lover. For sure there wasn't one contact between him and Lilly or Steve and Cora that felt repulsive in the slightest. Right at this moment, Lilly being against his thigh is a balm.
He suffered through all of this meditation, strict discipline, and training exercises for nothing?
It's very flattering. "Thanks. I just heard that Iron Man will be helpful."
"Showtime," Tony says.
Wow. Holy shit, that's monumental and Tony really, really wants to explore that idea in the future.
Tony feels stupid for not taking the chance. "I didn't want to look too clingy, if all you wanted was a fuckbuddy."
The moment ends when Tony turns to look at the kids that are arguing.
"Come on now," Tony says instead of replying, pushing into the portal.
It's Tony, he's sure, and Steve raises his head so fast he almost gives himself whiplash. Tony is indeed here, in a black tank-top-and-shorts duo, always such a fantastic look on him. The nice arms on display distract Steve before he remembers that he shouldn't be staring.
"I don't know," Steve says.
Or, to be honest, Tony thought he was the expert, but he just learned about Wakanda yesterday. He hopes to visit soon; it sounds amazing.
And he finds it funny.
"Four in total, actually," Tony interrupts. That dreaded 616 came up twice.
She's totally unimpressed, and as soon as Steve lets her go, Callie flops down once more, tail swishing in anger. It makes Steve chuckle.
"Our girls, you mean," Tony says, stretching to peer inside the box. The declaration makes Steve's heart soar. He thinks of the cats as Tony's, he's so protective of them, and so being included is a big deal.
Ah, shit. Anthony forgot about that.
"No, no, my fault Steve. The faucet poked me, that's all. I'm fine."
He wants Tony. Has for a long time. It is complicated to prefer men, especially with his previous and probably future position as sheriff. Steve's supposed to be one upholding the Law, and many people would probably want him kicked out of town if not worse upon learning about his affections. Before, in the Army, finding a partner wasn't hard, even if most men would swear up and down that the sex was simple stress relief, that they had a sweetheart or wife at home. It might even have been true for many. But it's deeper than that for Steve, it's how he's made. He accepted it ages ago, with the conviction he'd end his days as a bachelor.
"I'll be good. Please let me suck you? We can talk later."
Steve goes straight to bed when he reaches his floor, but then spends several long minutes staring at his ceiling. He
"I have nothing to do with that," Tony says, crossing his heart over his black t-shirt. It's a nice one, looking new, and fitted just right to showcase Tony's shoulders and arms. "They're decent people, deserving of funding for their good deeds."
"That makes for a change. Ready?" Tony asks, extending his arm. Steve gives him a grateful smile as he takes his hand. It's very cute, Tony won't lie.
"No thanks to you," Grimm says, dragging Electro towards the door. "I'll bring him down."
"Will do." Steve shakes his now empty wrapper. "Hungry?"
Clearly, it makes Steve and company weary. Knowing it's not ideal as a reveal situation, but having nothing else to work with, Tony opens up Iron Man and steps out.
"And then we pulled it off."
"On it," Carol says as she leaves for the cockpit.
"Hey guys," Tony says with a wave. "It's more like I ran straight into their camp because I thought your friend here was out to get me. It turns out he ate them instead. Well most of them."
“Majesty,” the crow immediately says, inclining her head. “It’s an honor.”
Steve is in full uniform, and with his shield on his arm now. Tony helps him put on his cowl, and he rubs down his arms.
"Holy shit!" Tony says, his heart breaking for Bruce. Worst nightmare indeed. "Did you stop her?"
"It is kind of funny," Sam says. Snowball has wiggled away and now wants to examine the pool. Tony gives the end of the leash to Wanda, who grins at him in thanks.
"Please, they both have marshmallow centers," Nat says.
"Um. I feel fine, but you might have to look again," he says, gesturing to his eyes, "because there's something wrong with my color perception."
"Yes, but I was just leaving for the Compound. Why?"
"That's cute, I like it," Tony says. "She could have a longer title, too. Princess Bella Calliope, first of her name."
"Same," Tony says. "When we're done with those stupid super soldiers, and hopefully the Krees, we're taking a week off, just for us."
Grief over his mother again. The horror of seeing her being choked to death on the tape, and the red mist that took over when Steve confessed that
Tony is on his side on the ground, still reeling from what is certainly a severe concussion. He watches in dismay as the wolf—massive and with golden fur—leaves one Hydra soldier to jump towards a second, and then a third. The men are shooting the wolf with darts, not bullets. Whatever sedative they contain is not working at all, as the wolf continues to attack, incapacitating the soldiers. It's not paying Tony any mind, for which he's eternally grateful. In fact… it has firmly planted itself between the remaining Hydra men and Tony, and is baring extra long teeth as if daring them to approach.
The beast doesn't immediately come over to rip up Tony's throat. Hell, it shows no signs of aggression right now. After it breaks the prolonged eye contact, the wolf instead starts pulling out the darts jabbed into its body, dropping them on the ground. It blows Tony's mind. The animal knows what it's doing and why, a clear sign of intelligence.
Wilson has the usual wings, but his uniform is in the red, white and blue color scheme, with the star on his chest. It's unmistakable, especially since he also has Cap's round shield.
"I do." Tony sighs. "You're a good man, Steve."
Steve knows taking Tony is what he's supposed to want, as a man. He has no doubt that it will be amazing, too. But he's always carried within him the desire of trying it the other way around, to experiment letting go completely and give himself away. Having Tony so comfortable expressing his wish to get fucked gives Steve the courage to ask for the same.
In and out of his relationship with Pepper, especially once it was over for good, Tony was perfectly content to nurse a silent crush on Steve that he assumed was one-sided. After an incident involving an EMP that had Iron Man drop a few stories to the ground during a battle, Steve had appeared in his workshop with a determined expression and a purposeful stride.
It reeks of magic and fairy tales. Tony doesn't say it out loud—there are massive animals present that could certainly kill him—but he hates this. Cora has stopped snuggling with Steve's daemon and hops until she's near the armor's boots, looking up at Tony.
A voice on speaker startles them. "If it's any comfort, they died in their sleep. Did you really think I wanted more of you?"
Barnes slightly raises his chin, and his shoulders have relaxed a bit. Good. "Lots of assholes looking for weapons?"
Meanwhile Steve has extended his arm, and Cora transfers from the armor’s shoulder to his wrist.
"No, it's fine. I'd love to," he hurries to add when Steve looks disappointed. "But it's better that I don't, if I'm to fight. I need to keep the energy."
"Wouldn't it be best to stay put? Make it easier for Richards to find us?"
Twenty minutes is a long time, and they stay silent for it. Flying like this isn't conducive to small talk, anyway. Frankly, Tony can't stop thinking about the universes they had a glance at. He's not surprised that Steve was part of his life in many of them. And he's still insanely envious of Natasha Stark, that's for certain. In an effort to stop playing those vows and the kiss in a loop, Tony checks his emails, answers a few, and discards the others. It's not good enough. No, he needs a real distraction, physical exertion to clear his head. A good session on his wooden Wing Chun dummy should help. He's planning the rest of his day—go change, drink a Gatorade, the gym, shower, maybe a few hours on the new armor—when the compound appears into view.
"Fine, as long as you want." It won't be a hardship or anything.
Tony snorts. "She's small. Kids don't grasp subtleties."
"I think so," the Supreme Intelligence finally says. "Are you ready to avenge your parents?"
He's about to put his phone away when a pop-up alert comes on. It's a message that asks Steve if he wants to accept a shared picture from James Rhodes. He hurries to accept, and it's the earlier one, with Tony and the kittens.

Nebula follows Tony to the edge of the table where he sets out to observe first. It's a game played with metal tiles about as big as dominos. The engraved symbols on one side of the tiles aren't familiar to Tony, unsurprisingly, and there are at least six colors he can see right now. At first glance, the game looks similar to poker.
