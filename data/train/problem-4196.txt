“Is that the squirt?” Claire asks. Dean nods, opening his mouth to reply, and Jack choses that moment to turn his face into Dean’s neck and puke, letting out a small wail in surprise.
“I’m scared of fucking this up,” Dean can hear his voice break, and he squeezes his eyes closed tighter. “I’m scared I’m not going to be there enough for him, I have no one to follow, no guidance-” Dean’s eyes flicker open as Cas tilts his head, meeting his gaze once again. It’s the same look. The one that says, so clearly, how much Cas- Dean cuts that thought off, unwilling to even imagine it right now.
He doesn't bother with the wrap that he had snuck into his bag before they left, it wasn't worth it to put it on when Jack would hopefully fall asleep during his feeding. Then, Dean could get a drink and maybe try to sleep a couple hours.
Dean watches Cas pause. He looks between Dean and Jack and the door with a furrow in his brow. Dean doesn't have much time to wonder about his sudden reluctance before Cas grabs the bottle and quickly disappears through the door.
Dean would give a lot to make sure she never had to go through any of this, but what's done was done.
That isn't abnormal, even throughout the day he had been in and out of his room, catching Cas in there more than once. It was where all of Jack’s necessities were.
“I don't need a break, I'm doing fine.” Dean lets out a sigh as Jack's eyes finally fall shut and quickly shushes Sam when he attempts to talk again. Dean has been spending the last two weeks trying to train Jack to sleep in a playpen during naptime. It seems he is less reluctant if the playpen is in the same room as Dean but still, the effort is clearly taking a toll on him.
It's dangerous to love a Winchester and it’s even more dangerous to admit that love. To have it out in the open where anyone can take it and use it for their own gain, for their own means. To have that love twisted and warped by the people who observe it. It’s not just dangerous, its down right stupid.
There's unsurprisingly no old baby things lying around, not that Dean would trust whatever things were lying around the bunker. Knowing his luck he would find a crib and it would be haunted by some baby eating demon. He is better off just buying a new crib.
“Pack.” Dean stated, finally turning to look at Sam. He was staring back at Dean with something close to fear in his eyes, but an order was an order. In some part of his mind, Dean is disgusted with himself. The tone sending him spiraling back to everytime they had to move as a kid. Every harsh word his dad said to him in his grief. But a bigger part still burns with that feeling of helplessness, with grief so absolute he can't find it in himself to care.
It's unfair for Dean to keep this to himself. It’s selfish that Dean wants to accept and bask in Cas’s love for him without having to make himself vulnerable in turn.
Dean lets out a sharp breath through his nose and takes another step closer to Cas. “Why would I lie about this? None of this is your fault.”
because of them. He can't risk revealing his feelings and then losing this. He can't love Cas and fight with him, he can't see him walk away, can't see him get hurt.
He’s able to keep his own head up for a little bit, and his bright blue eyes have retained their unnervingly intelligent look. It’s made even more obvious when they glow golden in Cas’s presence as if reacting to his grace. His hair is sticking up randomly, resistant to Deans attempts to brush it with the tiny soft brush he had bought.
They head to the kitchen anyway to make a bottle before going to the library, landing heavily on the couch with a muffled sigh. Dean hands Cas the bottle and watches as he feeds Jack.
But in those memories, Cas will inevitably turn to Dean, a curious look on his face and it all comes rushing back.
Cas had looked him in the eye, placed his hand over the handprint, covered as it was by layers of fabric and told him that he loved him. He
“You have a piece of Castiel’s grace!” Dean’s mind grinds to a halt, the words echoing in his mind dangerously. A piece of his grace. A piece of his
Jack’s first night on earth leaves him distraught and more than once there's a banging on the walls when Jack's squalling reaches its peak. Sam has curled up with his head under his pillow, but Dean knows from experience just how little that helps.
Dean can’t find it in himself to care at the moment, more focused on calming a screaming Jack. He had to fight back the feeling of nostalgia. He remembers waiting with Sam clutched in his tiny arms or clinging to his hand as his dad got them a room. Dean remembers the line of clerks who gave him that same annoyed look, though filled with more pity. Babies were never good for the hotel business.
“Here, how about we go sit in the kitchen and I’ll explain.” Sam says, snapping his laptop closed and moving to stand.
It doesn’t help that the longer he’s stuck at home the more his frustration grows. He doesn’t want to be trapped in the bunker. It leaves too much time for him to think.
He was already nothing more than a corpse and a charred imprint on the ground when Mary fell through the portal. How would he know that she wasn’t here anymore?
“Dean, if I was given the chance, I would never leave your side again.” It isn't said like a secret, there's nothing hushed or quiet about Cas’s voice. He says it like a fact, like it's something Dean should already know. Just another one of the million facts of life.
He wants to be able to come home and see everyone he loves. He wants to be able to hand Jack off to his mom and know that he can take a break. He wants to look at his brother and know he didn't fail spectacularly at raising him. He wants to be able to argue with Cas over what color to paint the nursery and what formula they should be buying and what diapers are best and….
“Dude, a bank robbery by Dave Mathers.” Dean whispers showing the computer to Cas excitedly. “He’s been dead for like a hundred years!” Cas gives the computer a withering look and instead turns back to Jack who is gumming at his hand without a care in the world.
Dean knuckles go white on the steering wheel whenever his mind is inevitably drawn to Crowley, or Mom, or Kelly or… and he’s forced to shake himself out of it, turn the music louder, push the gas pedal a little harder, but there's no running away from your feelings. The only thing he can do is shove them in a box and drink them away later.
Since that night by the Lake house, more often than not, Dean woke up screaming or, god forbid, on some nights crying. No one needed to see that. Every night Dean had to live with the shame and the grief and the pain and that pit in his chest that threatens to swallow him whole. That wasn’t going to go away just because Cas was back, no matter how much he wished that was true.
He pulls away from Cas, who, for a moment, refuses to get go of his hand. Dean smiles back at him and pats him on the shoulder before half jogging back to the impala. The burn of his gaze follows Dean all the way to the impala. It brands the back of his neck and begs him to look back.
“Bedtime for the twerp.” Dean announces. He leans back so that Cas can get a clear view of how to take Jack out the car seat, one hand tucked underneath his neck and the other hefting the baby out and onto his shoulder. “Jack, too, I guess, he needs just as much beauty rest as Sam.”
For a heartstopping moment he thinks he's still dreaming, but then Cas reaches out a hand and lets it rest on Dean’s cheek. Dean leans into it, brings his own hand up to keep it there, turns just enough that he can feel the flutter of Cas’s pulse against his lips.
The drive is hazy, unmemorable, his eyes not quite focusing on the road, his hands shaking where they’re white knuckling the steering wheel. Jack is oddly silent in the back, Sam sitting up straight next to the carrier as if he had forgotten how to relax in the week that he was gone. There are no coos or cries that Dean has gotten so used to over the nearly two months that Jack has been with him.
He sees Cas’s mouth fall open a little as Dean pulls the trench coat out of the folds of the couch with a sheepish grin. It looks nearly the same as it did the night it all happened. Dean had managed to get most of the blood out, but the stain was still there. He didn’t dare throw it in the wash, worried whatever was left of Cas would fade away like everything else.
No matter how much he braces himself it still hurts like a punch to the gut. Dean turns sharply, heading towards the nursery to get clothes and a washcloth for the baby’s first bath.
He can still see his nose crunching under Dean’s fist, the burn of the mark on his forearm as anger thrummed through his veins like a drug. Dean can imagine his hand curling against Cas’s throat, the burn of stubble under his palm, the crack of his cheekbone. The warmth of his blood on Dean’s knuckles, lingering until he could finally bring himself to wash it off.
Dean said yes to save his family. To save Jack and Sam and Cas, to make sure they were safe. And if he has to live the rest of his life trapped away? He was willing to pay the price.
“God, I need a drink.” Dean freezes as the words leave his mouth. Sam looks stunned and takes a staggered step back.
The weeks it took them to get a spell strong enough to guide him here it had sat on that chair mocking Dean for his loss. Sam had seen it once, had given Dean a sad understanding look before leaving him to his grief. Day after day he would fall asleep with his hand pressed to the scar on his shoulder, hoping it’ll bring him some comfort, that wherever Cas was it would comfort him as well. A connection even in death, to the person he loved.
“Okay, Cas,” Dean announces, ignoring how the sight of him with Jack gave him the same feeling racing down the open road. “Ready to learn how to give the kid a bath?”
Dean didn't have to imagine the anger at feeling replaced, he wasn't exactly the kindest person to Adam.
A part of him that he doesn’t want to examine too closely, while not glad about what happened to her, is almost content with how things are at the moment. It's a selfish, childish part of Dean that likes this domestic bubble he has made for himself.
Or maybe this feeling stems from the way Cas is acting. Distant, unapproachable, in a way he’s never been before.
responsibility and he just left him. He is obviously upset by Dean’s actions. He is probably tuned into Dean’s emotions somehow, whether it was because of some freaky baby angel magic or something else.
It’s Dean’s turn to let out a stunned “What” his eyes narrowing. Sam is standing at the foot of the couch arms crossed and shoulders tense.
But Jack is in his arms, so instead he turns around, leans against the counter, and starts to feed Jack before he begins crying again. The silence echoes around them, nearly suffocating this time. Cas is a growing line of tension along his side.
“The cold makes them pee, so if you open the diaper it's gonna get on you, me, and the bed.” He explains. Cas nods and follows his instructions as Dean leans forward to press a kiss to Jack’s forehead, trying to smooth down his hair. He knew it was useless, just another thing that made Jack look so much like Cas that it hurt.
For a moment, Dean wants nothing more than to leave. He wants to run away, leave the baby to its fate. Let the angels or demons have the damn thing because he wants nothing to do with it.
“Don't worry, he won’t wake up from us talking, I think he finds it calming.” Dean can't help himself from smiling down at the baby. He was growing quickly, seemingly at the same rate as any other baby according to the websites he had read, but it still felt far too fast.
Dean lines his fingers up along the handprint, worms his way under his sleeve until it’s just skin on skin. He hopes it’ll help, that it’ll make him forget the emptiness when that thing had touched him.
There’s no panic on the face of the man in the mirror. His green eyes just look confused, something like concern hidden deep.
Sam comes stumbling down the stairs and Dean yanks his hand away as if it burned him, turning instead to face his brother and the millions of questions he didn’t want to answer.
Sam has long since gone to bed and still, Jack presses close to Dean’s side, as close as Dean will let him.
“I should take it away.” The words settle in the air around him, sending a bolt of fear down his spine. He had always known it was important, it was something of Cas’s left on him, but through the years it had become one of the only things that was purely his. Something he didn't have to share with anyone else.
Dean had to be a mother and a father to Sam, and he would never be able to leave that headspace. Sam will always be Dean’s kid and Dean will always worry about him.
Dean prowls the bunker like the predator, the monster, he is. He hunts down his brother like an animal, because he will do
“My name is Dean Win—” Already his last name has slipped through his grasp. He looks curiously at himself in the mirror. There was something else he was supposed to remember. He can hear voices behind the door, rising into a crescendo. What was the room he was in?
“Yeah he’s grown quite a bit.” Dean looks back up at Cas. “Like a weed….” His voice trails off at Cas’s steady gaze. He’s looking at Dean with open affection and it's enough to make him blush to the roots of his hair, and he quickly pulls away to finish breakfast.
He wants to poke and prod at Sam until he snaps. Until some of that tightly wound anger escapes him. But he doesn’t.
He sits there for far too long. Long enough that he knows Sam will be looking for him. An ache has settled in his hand and he focuses on a single drop of blood sliding down his arm as he drags himself off the floor. It stains the bandages wrapped around his burns.
Cas freezes for a beat, before lighting up like Dean had never seen. One of the lamps bursts, sending a shower of broken glass onto the desk in the corner, but Dean still can't look away.
Dean sits down hard on the seat across from him and rubs a hand across his face. His stubble was getting too long.
Dean breaks away from the bacon to get a closer look at Jack, taking in all the ways he’s changed over the two months. He had filled out a lot, cheeks growing just a little bit chubbier, his hair just a tiny bit longer. He had never really looked squished like newborns normally looked, but his head was no longer weirdly shaped.
“He’s beautiful.” The woman had paused where she was looking at the car seats, and is now turned towards Dean and Jack. “A little late to be crib shopping though, where's your wife?.” She smiles and it grates on Dean’s nerves.
Dean was willing to fight god to get Cas back, something like the empty isn't going to stop him either.
“Oh you wish? Wishing doesn't do shit, Sammy. It’s the same as praying in my book.” Dean can feel the anger growing like a fire in his chest. It’s too easy for him to just give in. To feel
Jack took to it like he does everything else, with a curious glance filled with far more intelligence than a two month old should have. He still cried and fussed like any normal baby when he was hungry or uncomfortable, but things like changing and baths didn't startle him the way it probably should have.
“Makes sense. He did sleep on top of me most of the time you were….” The words get stuck in his throat.
The sun is rising as they finally throw the match down. There's no body to burn but Dean can feel his mothers absence like a missing limb. He watches the flames grow higher and mourns everything he wanted. A life with Cas, a life with his family, at least what left of it, together and happy.
The only reason Dean doesn't bolt up and storm off is the baby peacefully asleep on his knees. Jack glues him to his spot on the couch, but anger sits at the back of his throat and nearly chokes him.
“Why not?” His voice is sharp, but Dean just runs the fingers of his free hand through Jack’s feathers, reaching up to smooth back his hair.
Dean lays Jack down in the open bed, pulls the blankets up so that he’ll be warm and barely manages to make it back to the couch before he collapses, head in his hands.
The pain grounds him in a way, keeps him from going insane. It distracts him from the temptation of violence. It keeps Dean from rising to the bait, calms him when the taste of blood in the water calls to him like a siren. The pain is Dean’s last handhold as he slips and slides deeper into the darkness threatening to eat him whole.
Dean notices the trench coat at the foot of the bed, right where it had been the night before. He drags it closer.
“Why are we going to your room?” Cas asks as Dean pushes open the door. “Does Jack not have a nursery?”
Cas is still staring at Dean as if Dean will suddenly disappear if he looks away for too long. Dean finds himself glancing over more than he would like to admit, checking to see he’s still there, that, after nearly two months of grief and rage that sat at the back of his throat like bile, this wasn't a dream. Their hands are intertwined on the seat between them, Dean running his thumb along Cas’s knuckles when he can't look away from the road.
Or maybe Dean is just trying to find an excuse as to why he wants to be so close to Cas, why he always wants to push in closer, the never ending need to just be near him. If it was the handprint then it wasn't his fault, he couldn’t stop it, it wasn't something he would have to get over. He wouldn't have to move on. Blaming it on the handprint was easier than admitting that he wanted something he couldn't have, something that Cas couldn't give him.
Dean could reliably tell Jack’s cries apart at this point, the sharp wail at night that seems specifically designed to wake him up, the low whimpers of hunger that echoed through the bunker. But this? This was the unmistakable cry of a baby that was extremely uncomfortable.
Dean lets his eyes fall shut. For all his bravo, he finds that he can't look Cas in the eye, not while he admits how weak he is.
Jack isn't small, but when he presses his face closer to Dean’s chest and snuffles gently, Dean can almost pretend that he’s as young as he’s supposed to be. Dean can imagine the baby he would be, all blue eyes and chubby cheeks. He thinks maybe it would be easier to accept him then, when he looked the part of the innocent child.
Dean has been stumbling around on eggshells that he himself had placed, desperately clung to rules of his own making, terrified of giving Jack the same childhood he and Sam had. Scared of turning into the type of father that made his kid call him ‘Sir’.
Dean’s footsteps don't echo when he walks, the only thing he can hear is the muted thud of his boots on a ground he can’t see. It sets his teeth on edge, something just unusual enough for him to notice but so subtle that he almost didn't. It’s so quiet that his ears ring in the absence of sound, years of too loud music and gunfire taking its toll on him.
“Well, the silver lining about being cursed? I’ll finally get some face time with Daisy Duke.” The joke falls flat, Sam just raising an eyebrow at him. It’s more worried than it had any right to be.
“We should probably hurry, he is getting hungry.” Cas says, dipping his hand back in the water to make sure it was still the proper temperature. Dean squints at him and Jack both, looking for the normal signs that Jack was going to start crying soon. He would usually start to clench his fists, turn his mouth towards the things near him, or chew on his own hands, but none of that was happening now.
He had looked at Dean with so much fear; he had to leave the room when it came down to it. The disappointment, the betrayal, that laced his tone, soured his expression.
Who knew how close the angels were, or if they were even following them in the first place. No doubt the demons already know and without Crowley keeping them in line…. Their only saving grace is that Lucifer is gone as well; the demons will be in disarray until they find a new leader.
Or maybe it’s just because he’s paying more attention to Cas. He hasn’t really been able to look away from him since he got back, too scared of looking back only to find that he’s gone.
Cas nods along. Suddenly, Dean pulled his free hand into the water, palm upwards so he could test the water. It makes Cas close enough that his hip taps into Dean’s, a comfortable pillar of warmth by his side, turning his cheeks a shade of pink.
“Well at least you have this little one.” She reaches towards Jack who is currently fascinated with the mitten on his hand, alternating between gumming at it and waving it around. Dean has to resist the urge to smack her hand away. “A part of her will always live on through him.”
“Missouri Mosley has, what she assumes to be, a wraith attacking psychics, so I have Jody on the case.” Dean once again raises his eyebrow as his brother continues to pack.
“Do not make light of this.” Cas interrupts his voice cold enough to stop Dean in his tracks. “This is not a chick flick moment, these are my feelings and I’d like you to respect that.” Dean shuts his mouth, snapping his eyes back to meet Cas’s and he’s captivated once again.
Eventually, Jack’s weight grows heavy enough on Dean’s shoulder that he knows he’s asleep. He scoops him up like the child he is, an arm supporting his neck and another under his knees.
“I’m going to go make dinner since we missed lunch.” Dean doesn't wait for Cas’s answer. He doesn't want to look at his face and see that openness turn to disappointment when he realizes that Dean isn't going to talk about it. The conversation they should be having hovers between them, making it hard to breathe if Dean thinks about it for too long.
Their second kiss is just as good as the first, if not better, Cas leaning into it with a sigh. His free hand is threading through the hair on the back of Dean’s neck in a way that makes his heart somehow beat faster, makes it feel like it’s gonna come right out of his chest.
The joke falls on deaf ears, Sam already wandering away with one last harsh pat on Cas’s shoulder and Cas making the cosmic entity equivalent to grabby hands at the gurgling baby.
Something that looked like Dean, that sounded like him, mocking Cas. Leading him on, letting him think he had escaped, that Dean had finally come for him. Taunting him with his love, convincing him that this time,
Cas is still standing awkwardly and Sam is looking away as if he'd rather be anywhere but there because Dean is still close enough to Cas to lean over and….
It’s wrong in every way and when Dean opens his eyes the qareen’s are just as empty. They’re the right shade of blue but they’re not right and Dean turns away, let’s the wrongness settle like a lead weight in his gut. He leans nearer, until Dean can feel the brush of his lips against his cheek, until he can just see the rise of his fist in his peripheral.
Dean has always known that Cas was attractive, he was constantly caught halfway between laughter and jealousy whenever anyone brought it up. Even his true form, what momentary glimpses Dean caught as a demon, were stunning. Interconnecting rings spiraling around his human vessel like a piece of art, six wings, iridescently beautiful even in their tattered state, trailing behind him. What Dean would have given to be able to run his hands through them. To be able to touch
Dean didn't blame Sam for getting fed up with the baby. Jack’s cries, despite not being supersonic anymore, were still piercing.
Sam hands him the phone filled with faces he already can’t remember. But Cas sits at the forefront. His eyes
“I’m me.” Dean’s voice is like gravel, tears springing unbidden into his eyes. “How can I prove it's me?” Cas doesn't say anything, just continues to search Dean’s face. Dean can taste his blood on his tongue.
When he thinks of a perfect life its Cas, and Sam and this makeshift, ragtag family that they’ve put together. It’s everyone happy and safe and settled in some nowhere town where their kids and their kids kids could play and be away from whatever shitty sham of a life they're living right now.
It’s the man who pops in and out of Dean’s mind, hovers on the edges of his memory even when everything else leaves.
Sam eventually comes to a stop in front of Dean and Jack, the baby's neck craning as far as it could to try to look at Sam. Dean sighs and pushes himself into a sitting position, scooping Jack up so he wouldn’t hurt himself trying to look that high.
“You do realize Jack is only two months old right?” Sam raises his eyebrow with a know-it-all smirk but Dean can still see the smile in his eyes. That almost makes all of this worth it. He hasn't seen Sam smile like that in a long time. Since Eileen probably. “But sure he’s the one that needs to go sightseeing.”
“Maybe, though no one knows where he died and was buried.” Sam cuts in pushing his laptop in front of her. “There have been more than a handful of grave robberies too.”
Dean opens his mouth and nothing comes out. He swallows harshly and decides, for the first time possibly ever, there was no way out of this besides honesty, to make Cas see just how stupid it was to love him.
and he couldn’t do anything to stop it. Couldn't save the day. Couldn't bring him back. Lost his mom and another friend in the process.
Dean only regrets not trusting Cas sooner. Lucifer couldn't enter the bunker, everyone would have been safe, alive. They might have even found a way to save Kelly.
“Does she know that….” Dean trails off nodding back to where Cas was no doubt still sitting at the table with Jack.
Dean let’s his eyes fall shut, he wants to touch the handprint himself, to get rid of the feeling of Michael touching it. But, the darkness just closes around him once more.
“I'm amazed you got him to fall back asleep without this.” Dean remarks. He places the jacket close enough for Jack to grab at and the lapel immediately goes towards his mouth.
Not that he wants to be far away. Cas is first and foremost his best friend before anything else and Dean has been away from him for two months. He honestly just missed him. Missed being in his presence, missed laughing with him and cracking jokes about different movies and tv shows that Cas only half understood.
It's not until Dean finally lays on the bed with him, Jack curled up on his chest, that his cries finally cease.
“It was never meant to be. He was never meant to put a claim on you.” His voice turns soft, cajoling. “You weren’t his to claim.”
Dean fights his way to the surface. Bit by bit, he drags his way through the inky blackness of his mind.
“I don't care.” Dean’s eyes snap to Cas’s in shock. “Why would I care about you messing up? You said yourself, yesterday, we’ve both made mistakes. I don't love you any less for your mistakes just like you don't love me any less for mine.” It's said with so much confidence that Dean’s heart leaps into his throat. “That’s not going to change just because we’ve admitted our love out loud.”
Dean has always wanted a family. Wanted someone who would stay with him, someone to take care of, someone who would take care of him in turn and he has that now. He’s made himself a little family with Sam and Jody and Donna and Alex, and now with Jack and Cas and even Claire herself. Most of it wouldn’t have happened if Cas hadn’t decided to come down to earth one September day and promptly destroy the life of Jimmy Novak.
It wasn’t somewhere he wanted to go again. The air down there was thick, heavy with the smell of blood and burning flesh. He can still hear the distant screams, the pain of thousands, millions,
Cas is leaning against the counter with an expression Dean can’t even begin to process on his face. He’s looking at Dean the same way Dean was looking at
Dean hears Sam walking up the steps and turns to look up at him. He looks like he’s deep in thought and the hairs on the back of Dean’s neck stand on end. He’s nearly too tired to care, exhaustion dragging him down like a lead weight. He couldn't tell you the last time he got a full night's sleep.
“I love you too, Dean.” The smile doesn't fade but he does grow more serious, catching Dean’s gaze and holding it. “I know you're never going to stop worrying about the future and I won't either, but we’ll get through it together,” Cas pauses before his smile becomes crooked, blue eyes lighting up with mischief. “Buddy.”
He didn't sign up for this. He didn’t want to be a dad. Not now, when they barely have a handle on their own lives. Dean couldn't imagine bringing a new life into a world like theirs. Everything about this world is dangerous. Maybe not psycho apocalyptic world dangerous, but still dangerous. How is he supposed to keep Jack safe when every force in the world was coming after him?
“Yes, you're very funny, Dean.” Dean glares down at Cas, but only for a second. The slight upturn of his mouth makes keeping a straight face nearly impossible.
It hangs off her frame, obviously too big for her, big enough to fit her hoodie on underneath so she wouldn’t get cold. He never pointed out the theft, just happy that the leather would keep her safer from claws and fangs and knives than the thin zip up she had been wearing before.
It isn't long after that Dean sees Cas feeding Jack, kissing his hand every time he dozed off so that he would sleepily blink awake again. Dean watches it become a game to them, Jack’s eyes fluttering closed only to open back up as Cas leans down for a kiss. It's definitely not normal behavior for a two month old, but who is Dean to question the dynamics of a nephilim, no one had really been through something like this before.
It isn't until he opens his bag that he remembers what he had placed in there before they left. The sight of it makes him suck in a sharp breath, eyes closing as if it would change the image when he opens his eyes.
“Cas…” Dean's voice is thick, choking past the lump in his throat as Cas reaches up to grab his hand. Not moving it, just simply covering it with his own.
For the first time since the gas station, Dean walks away from Jack, leaves him with Sam. He storms into the nearly complete nursery and, for a moment, pauses.
He wasn't a stranger to pain. It comes with the life they live, gunshots, and stab wounds and claws tearing so deep into your flesh that you dread the moment the adrenaline fades. When all of that pain comes welling to the surface.
“Jack might want it back at some point.” Dean admits, taking in the picture before him. His hands itch to actually capture the image on film, print it out, keep in tucked in his pocket with the other one. “It’s been his security blanket, pretty sure it’s ‘cause it smells like you.” Dean pointedly doesn't mention why he knows this. Doesn’t mention that the trench coat was as much of a comfort to him as it was to Jack, that when the two of them slept it was almost always tucked next to them or on top of them.
Six hours. Honestly he applauds himself for even getting that far. Cas hadn't changed the way he was acting, not really, but Dean couldn't help but focus on him even more now.
Jack starts crying and they both reach for him simultaneously, hands brushing against each other. It makes Dean flinch back, eyes bulging slightly. Cas lets Dean have him, his brow furrowed.
Even now, when he’s sitting on the couch, Jack needs to be perched on his thighs, angled so that Jack’s feet kick Dean’s sternum every time he shifts or relaxes in his arms or over his shoulder. Jack takes most of his naps laying across Dean's chest, or in the wrap that Sammy has consistently made fun of him for.
Dean can’t toss up his hands because Jack is currently in them, so he settles for marching back to his dresser and pulling out two shirts and pairs of sweats. He tosses one set at Cas before setting Jack in his bassinet.
Dean can see Cas’s eyes go wide as she stomps closer and closer, until she digs her finger into his chest.
Dean had to stop himself from buying those childproof handles for every door in the bunker. Jack was only two months old, dude couldn't even hold his head up by himself yet, let alone walk.
“I didn't mean what I said,” Dean needs to say this, needs Jack to know, even if he didn't quite understand it yet. “I don't wish you were never born, Sam was right I just wish that Cas could be here, with us.” Dean meets Jack’s glowing eyes and watches them fade back to a familiar blue.
The tone takes him by surprise. Just how many times has he made it out? How many times had he clawed his way to the surface only to be pushed back down?
Cas looks at Dean as if the answer should be obvious. Dean looks back stubbornly, his brain refusing to connect the dots even if there is just one obvious choice.
Dean is overwhelmed by a feeling he can't describe. Like walking into a cool room when it's sweltering outside, like the warmth of a person pressed into your side when it's cold, the comfort of a hand in yours when you're scared. It's finally coming home after a long road trip, sinking into your bed after a long day.
Still, he leans in again. This kiss is nothing more than a peck. A reminder that they are both there, that this is real.
“I'm never going to force you into this, Dean.” Cas says, it's quiet enough that Dean has to strain around the sound of Jack's wails. “You knowing that I love you is more than enough for me, this doesn’t change anything.”
There was no one to guide Dean, besides his own memories. No Mom to teach him how to properly heat a bottle, no Crowley to snark about how exactly not to raise kids. No Cas….
It was one of the first things that he had read on those mommy blogs, after it had finally settled in that this was all real, that he was going to raise this kid. Always try to sleep when the baby does. For the first couple of months at the very least, when the baby is liable to wake up every two hours at night.
Instead he wanders around his room, hums to the baby in his arms and tries to breathe through the pain in his chest.
“Where is the man with the blue eyes?” He asks, turning away from the tv. He’s already forgotten what was playing. His voice is unfamiliar in his own ears. It almost startled him, octaves deeper than he expected. He looks at his own hands and sees freckles. Did he have freckles on his face?
Dean can't breathe. He takes shuttering, gulping breaths as he kneels besides Cas’s body, but his head still swims and hands still shake as they reach toward his face. It's still warm, his stubble bristling against Dean's fingers and for a moment Dean pretends.
The thought of him leaves an ache in his shoulder and a lump at the back of his throat. He doesn't need to remember him to know that he was important. Even now, his name has already faded from his mind, but the feeling stays trapped in his chest.
Cas reaches a hand up, letting his fingers brush Dean’s cheekbone, barely skimming the surface until Dean leans into it fully, resting his cheek in Cas’s hand. He turns his face until his lips brush a still bloody palm. He wants to lean in and kiss him properly, but there'll be time for that later when they're home safe and sound in the bunker.
But Dean will never feel right again. Right is dead and gone, right is ash and bone on a beach twelve hours away, right is wherever angels go when they die. Right has gone somewhere Dean can’t follow and he can feel its absence in his chest, in his soul.
sitting criss cross on his side, Jack laying out in front of him in just a diaper. He has a small pile of baby clothes next to him and there’s a dirty bottle on the bedside table. Cas is looking between the clothes with a sigh, continuing to shush a babbling Jack.
Dean doesn’t completely let go of Cas. He lets his hands slip down to the small of his back to guide him through the doorway and into the kitchen.
He pulls out all the fixings for a full breakfast, setting them on the counter closest to Cas and Jack.
He reaches up and lets his fingers brush against Cas’s cheek, watches as Cas leans into the motion, eyes fluttering shut.
Claire didn't get to have much of a childhood. It's hard to forget when he’s one of the reasons it happened, but she lost her dad at 11, lost her mom before she was a teenager. And to see your own father-who’s not
Dean finally falls asleep curled around Jack and the trenchcoat, his own hand covering Jacks where it was connected to the coat.
His wings were already folded back into whatever space they occupied when they weren't here and he was obviously already half asleep, blinking slowly against Cas’s shoulder.
Dean clears his throat and shifts uncomfortably. “Cas, I really don't want this to become another chick flick moment I think we’ve had enough of those the-”
So he lets Jack lean on him as he finally grows tired. Dean feels him slump over, soft hair skimming against Dean’s collar, his cheek brushing against his shoulder and it’s not right. It's a flush of grace that is too warm, too bright, too strong. It’s not evil, if anything it is calm, reassuring, like standing just a moment too long in the sun, but it's not
“You didn't tell me you two were connected.” Cas moves closer to Dean, cautious. He doesn't look angry anymore at least.
He snatches the baby carrier from the floor and is quick to buckle in Jack, the baby grumbling as he's moved from his comfortable spot in Dean's arms.
The pain has lessened since Cas had returned. Even with the few hours that it had been, the looming pit of emptiness has started to heal, but it still stung. To see the two of them together, looking like a real family, made Dean ache in an entirely new way.
They still need to find a way to get Mary back, and the weight of the angels and demons no doubt coming after Jack still sits heavy on the back of his mind, but they have Cas. He is a solid presence in the Impala, a line of heat along his side as they finally pull into the garage, and soft hands and shuffling feet as Dean pulls Jack’s carrier out of the backseat.
“Jack.” Cas is looking at the baby with soft eyes to contrast his stiff body. Jack is still smiling, cooing up at Cas and reaching out to tug on his tie, and something in Dean settles.
His name is Dean. The tall one is Sam, his brother apparently. The woman is Rowena, Sam spits out her name like a curse.
understand, he knows exactly what he's chasing. He knows what that handprint means, but he’ll never admit it, not even to himself. He knows why it burns, something so pure was never meant to touch the rotted, hallowed out thing that his soul is becoming.)
Finally, Sam wanders in, his hair pulled into that dumbass little bun that makes Dean want to take a pair of clippers to it and a towel slung around his shoulders. He places his laptop on the table next to Cas, leaning down to give Jack a kiss on the forehead.
Even the normal things that seem to take Dean’s breath away, watching Cas wander around the bunker, looking for a specific book. Peering over his shoulder as he watches a video on the importance of a species of bee.
For a moment, Dean sits on the chair and watches the baby. He squirms on the bed, hands grasping the air and making that strange cooing noise that Dean assumes means he’s content.
Something’s lost, broken, missing, he just doesn’t know, but it gets under his skin, sets him on edge in a way he doesn’t like to think about for long. He feels hollow. Dean hasn’t been able to settle since they returned.
“Come on, Buddy, let’s get the kid ready for bed.” Cas nods along to his words but doesn’t move, doesn’t open his eyes. His free hand grips Dean’s flannel, twines around it until his knuckles brush Dean’s hip through too many layers.
He destroys the room, tearing down the pictures, throwing the chair against the wall, knocking over the dresser, perfectly folded baby clothes scattering across the room.
Dean pulls Cas’s hand away from his mouth, guides it down to his shoulder, thankful that he had nothing more than a t-shirt on. It's a last effort, a plea, a prayer that he can't voice out loud, too scared that his voice will crack with emotion.
“I feel like you should be more worried about doing our fucking job, than about me destroying another nursery.” He spat out. “I'm dealing with it just fine.”
Dean finishes up surrounded by a comfortable silence, broken only by Cas shushing Jack’s babbling whenever he begins to whine.
When it’s Sam's turn in the backseat, he doesn't touch Jack. Dean knows it's because he's scared he’ll hurt him. Sam is convinced that whatever he touches dies. Dean can see the way he already cares for the kid, but he won’t touch him. Instead he sleeps with his head pressed against the window, as far away from the baby as possible.
“And the jackets.” Cas just narrows his eyes at him instead and curls his fingers into the edge of the trench coat.
Cas is like a tsunami. His anger is quiet, unassuming at first. Your first sign is him retreating. He closes in on himself, pulls away before returning in all his glorious anger. Overwhelming. Unyielding.
Dean watches as Michael lifts his hand, reaching out slowly until his fingertip brushes along the fabric of his sleeve. Until the dread in Dean’s gut grows to a crescendo, until the thought of the handprint being gone overwhelms him and he lets out a gasp of air that is far closer to a sob than he would ever admit.
The emptiness that had nearly consumed him for the past month was fading even as he looked on at Cas and Jack together. Finally together like they should have been from the start. The emptiness is filled with happiness and fondness and so much relief that it crawls up his throat and bubbles past his lip as a laugh.
in that picture that’s burning a hole in his pocket. Like he would rather be here than anywhere else in the world, like he would trade anything to be able to stay in that moment permanently.
“Cas? Are you talking about Cas?” The man in front of him asks. He looks almost excited, hands pushing his hair back. Who let his hair get that long anyway? His eyes were red rimmed. He wondered why he was upset.
“I'm guessing you changed him during the night while I was asleep.” Dean pushed himself up and mirrored Cas’s position, their knees knocking together. After their talk last night (which Dean couldn’t even start to think about without blushing like a teenage girl), Dean hadn't woken up again, which meant that Cas had taken care of all of Jack's needs through the night.
Jack progresses so quickly it almost hurts to see. He can lift his head slightly, has been more “talkative” seeming to coo back at Dean when he sings.
All at once, Dean can see himself and his own father, mirror images of grief and anger 30 years apart. The drinking. The silence.
Jack is still staring at the two of them with his little brows furrowed, hands clenching and unclenching around Cas’s where it holds the bottle. It’s almost comical, how much he looks like Cas with that expression. Dean sort of wanted to find a trench coat small enough for him, maybe a little suit too. It would be funny, they could take a picture together.
But still the mistrust lingers, because this isn’t his baby brother. He didn’t have 22 years to watch him grow into the man he was before he was faced with the idea of him being inhuman. Dean doesn’t have the concrete trust in Jack, built over decades like he did with Sam.
Dean watched the blade come down in slow motion, could barely control it’s path as Cas pleaded with him. His hand was a brand on Dean's wrist, his own personal prayer and yet Dean could still only narrowly tamp down the fury in his bones.
Dean chants in his mind, clinging to any sense or normality he could get, and trying to calm himself. This isn't how he wanted this to go. He doesn't want to fight anymore. He doesn't want to talk about it. He doesn't want to have all these emotions hanging in the air between them like a cloud of poison.
“I'm going to meet her out there for backup, should be about three days, four if it gets too late.” Sam continues oblivious to Dean's inner turmoil.
Normal or not it still makes Dean close his eyes against the rush of emotion. He just can't seem to get a grip, every movement of Cas’s drawing his eye. Every feeling amplified in his presence.
Dean kisses Melissa as a last resort, a quick brush of lips that has his gut rolling. It’s wrong in a way that Dean can’t describe. His hand curls around her waist, and it’s too soft, not soft enough. Her hair is too long, too straight, too light. The two images war in his mind, what he wants and what his soul is telling him to want overlapping until he can’t bear it.
What if this was all just a dream? If Cas was never back in the first place and Dean was just losing his mind? Imagining things that aren't actually there? Without Cas next to him, in his line of sight, in grabbing distance, it all seems to grow hazy as if it was never real to begin with.
“I'll let her speak for herself. Remember, two hours.” And then he continues walking down the hall as if he wasn't going to leave Dean at the mercy of a twenty year old with a bigger sense of vengeance than goddamn Batman.
have a serious talk at some point of another. Not if you wanted to continue to kiss that person, and holy fuck did Dean want to kiss Cas again, maybe even without Jack being there this time.
They cross the threshold of the house. Bitterness creeps through him, mixing with the stale blood on his tongue. This is just a cruel parody of everything he ever wanted.
So yes, if Dean could spare Claire the pain of losing her family he would, but he doesn't know if he would have the strength to risk the family that he has made now.
“Okay, Chuck…” He has to clear his throat, choking on the feeling that sits heavy in his chest. “or God, or whatever. I need your help.” He takes a great shuddering breath. “See, you– you left us. You left us. You went off. You said the earth would be fine because it had me and Sam, but it's not, and we're not.” He pauses waiting for something, some sign that he is listening, that this wasn't just Dean choking and stuttering on his own words in some back alley.
He doesn't remember his own name, his hair color, his eye color, he can’t pick himself out of a lineup. But he can picture dark hair and tan skin, a long coat covering a dark suit. It’s not him, but whoever they are they’re important to him.
Dean is a rope worn thin. The feeling in his gut threatens to overwhelm him, the ache in his shoulder, in his chest, tries to keep him sane. Both sides are pulling at him and he’s one big tug away from snapping completely, and who knows where the pieces will lie when it’s all over.
Dean would never admit it, to himself or anyone else, but the thought of an apple pie life with some stranger, or even Lisa, didn't cut it anymore.
He’s alive and in Dean’s room, in Dean’s clothes, close enough that Dean can feel him radiating warmth like a furnace. Dean sways forward until his forehead lands on Cas’s shoulder, eyes falling shut as Cas threads his fingers through the hair on the back of his neck.
Dean huffs out a laugh and pulls her hair back, tucking it into the collar of her leather jacket. The same leather jacket she had liberated from Dean’s closet five months earlier.
For one, unlike Sam or Bobby John, he very quickly falls asleep once he has the bottle in his mouth. Dean lets his fingers graze the baby's cheek and the hand that wraps around his own in an effort to keep him awake. He has to make sure to burp him afterwards and more often than not he would end up with baby puke on some part of him.
Dean has been fighting her since he met her, a figure in the middle of a tornado of darkness. He’s been fighting against the pull of her, fighting against the ache in his chest.
Claire finally reaches out and traces a single finger down the back of Jack’s hand. Dean can see how much she's holding herself back, from anger or grief or some other sadness he’s not sure. But, he's seen that look in her eyes before, sees it every time he looks in the mirror.
Dean wants to hate him, he does hate him in some way. He can feel it, hidden under the sorrow and guilt and mistrust. It’s misguided anger of course, Dean knows that, he
Life on the road with a baby was hard, more than once Dean was forced to feed Sam in the backseat of the Impala, his dad slaving over that fucking journal. Sam's body was nearly half the size of his own. He used gentle hands to burp him when he needed to, frantically cleaned the seats as he inevitably puked. Dad hated when the Impala was dirty.
“You left me alone,” he sobs into the fabric and curls tighter around it. “How could you leave me?” He doesn't know who he's talking to. Cas is gone. Not coming back.
to. He wants to remember him, he wants to see him, he wants to hear his voice, to feel the warmth of his hands, he is sure they'd be warm. He misses something he can’t even remember, and it sends a spiral of terror down his spine.
“I figured out he’s most comfortable if you burp him while he’s sitting, plus there’s almost no chance of getting puke on your clothes.” Dean grabs a burping rag from the side table and delicately places Jack in a sitting position. His chest is leaning on Dean's palm, his fingers curving around either side of the baby’s face to support Jack’s head, the burping rag covered his hand to catch anything that came back up. “It’s scary at first but you get used to it.”
Dean plucks Jack out of his car seat, carefully cradling his head and neck with his fingers. His diaper was dry, he was fed and burped, but still he cried no matter what. The only thing that seems to calm him is Dean himself, pulling him close and humming gently.
“Okay, hand him over.” Claire states mimicking the position of Cas’s arms to the best of her ability. Dean leans over and adjusts them slightly before Cas carefully slides Jack into Claire’s grip.
Sam has slowly become more comfortable with the baby, even holds him every once in a while. But still, he has mostly kept his distance, kept to his search for a way to bring mom home. Which is why Dean is so taken aback when Sam finally speaks.
Dean leaves him alone with Jack once, claiming he needs to use the bathroom but instead circles to the back of the gas station. He hasn’t done this is a while. Not since god had abandoned them to run off with his sister. He turns to face the sky, bright blue reminding him far too much of Cas’s eyes and his throat burns.
“You're staying?” Dean’s voice is incredulous in his own ears, far too close to breaking for his liking.
Dean finds himself wandering into Cas’s room, unable to control himself as he pushes the door open. If Dean thought the nursery was bad, this is like a hit to the chest. Cas is in every inch of this room. From the rumpled bed, to the phone on the bedside table, to the single picture frame on the desk and something in Deans chest burns. He aches and hurts.
“So he’s small enough that he needs to use a baby bathtub for now,” Dean explains turning on the shower with the handheld spout. “I try to put the tub high enough that it won't hurt my back.”
They're all gathered in the War room when Claire finally arrives, flinging open the door and stomping her way down the stairs.  It reminds Dean far too much of himself where he’s perched in one of the chairs, Jack half asleep on his shoulder, seemingly unbothered by the noise.
He should have known he wasn't in the headspace to talk to Sam, especially after the various fights they have had over every small thing. Sam refuses to leave the bunker either, possibly thinking he’s helping Dean or maybe just trying to get on his nerves.
Dean from that far away, let alone focus on him. He sets his bag next to the baby and watches as is his hand flail and grasp at the straps. He looks so tiny on that bed, dwarfed by everything around him, vulnerable in a way that makes Dean’s chest tight.
“So a ghoul then, or a particularly fucked up shapeshifter.” The two of them were completely ignoring Dean’s sputtering now. He looks back at Cas for backup, only to see him smiling softly at Claire.
“And Cast—Cas is my best friend.” Dean stutters over the words. They’re not right. Sit completely wrong on his tongue.
This baby couldn't be evil, nothing this innocent was ever truly evil, but he would need guidance, protection. And, somehow, that responsibility fell to Dean. To Dean. Dean who shouldn't be trusted with a dog, let alone a baby, let alone one of the most powerful beings in existence.
They fall back into a comfortable silence, Sam periodically reaching over to brush a hand through Jack’s hair. It makes Jack glance around, arms waving and hands grasping. Sam doesn't talk about the overly clean bunker, or the trench coat tucked next to Jack or any of the other odds and ends that made it clear that Dean wasn't doing as well as he wanted to seem.
Even as they were falling asleep, Cas dressed down again and sitting next to Dean on the bed, he could feel his unwavering gaze. It was almost a comfort, as he fell asleep.
“I keep waiting for it to get better, having Sam and you should be enough but it's like a part of me died with him.” Dean finally sobs. “I just want him back,” He pauses trying to drag a breath into his aching lungs, eyes falling shut.
Rings spinning along intertwining, melding, cracking apart. Wings ever moving, arching away from Cas, curling into Dean, shimmering like oil on asphalt in the light of his grace. Dean is struck with the sudden urge to touch. He wants to run his finger through feathers, feel the rings shift and move under his palm, know the familiar touch of Cas’s grace when he can see it as well.
What breaks Dean is when the baby’s eyes lock onto Dean and it lets out a whimper, eyes fading, turning a stunning shade of blue that Dean had only seen on one other person. Dean lets his eyes fall shut, something halfway between a laugh and a sob caught in his throat because the kid wasn't even Cas’s, why does he have his eyes?
Dean spent thirty years on the rack, he knows pain, he knows about your soul being flayed open, put back together only to be torn apart in some horrifyingly new way.
Jack's wings come in and out as they please, they have since they had settled into the bunker. It's one of the reasons he and Jack didn't really leave unless absolutely necessary. Not quite there in any solid way, but much more than just a shadowy image on the wall.
Claire looks up with wide eyes, unable to move her hair when she was holding Jack with both hands and too unsure of herself to move her arm even an inch out of the place Dean had put them.
“It's okay,” Sam sounds nervous, his voice barely more than a whisper. Dean knows that he's the one that caused it and feels like a piece of shit. “I know you're trying to deal with this in your own time. I'm happy to help where I can.” His voice is so sincere it hurts.
He was Lucifer’s kid, he had somehow convinced Kelly and Cas that he should live before he was even born. They couldn’t trust him, not right away, not in their line of work.
“A case.” Dean replies, raising an eyebrow at Sam’s confused look. “A ghost, I think. A man was killed by his dead wife according to neighbors.”
