“Oh fuck…fuck…fuuuuck!”  Tony shot his load up his ass as Clint came at the same time.  Tony stumbled away from Steve and flopped down next to Bucky.  “Best fuck ever, right?”  He smirked at his fellow Avenger.
“Fuck…”  Tony moaned out as he palmed his rising cock.  “I have to ask…and we are all thinking it…will you allow us to partake?”
“No…”  She said as gazed down at her bandaged wrists.  She tore at her dressings and cried out when she saw there was no scar…as if it never happened.  She huddled closely to the headboard when she saw the five men walk in.  She could barely contain her emotions at seeing her nightmares saunter in.  She looked down as she shook her head in despair.  She was trapped…there was no escape.  She could not even be granted death.  Hate encompassed her as she gazed up at the men.  She could not even control her fate.
“You are dirty, honey.  We are so disappointed.  We’ve been so good to you.” Tony added.  “I don’t think you deserve our cocks anymore.”
Finna gave Steve a few minutes and then released her bonds and reattached her leash.  She was led to a smaller chamber where there were three training slaves restrained on similar beds.
Natasha smiled sadly, having to hold back her tears.  She brought Steve to her and enveloped her in a hug, whispering soothing words as she cried.  Sam placed a comforting hand on Steve’s back, and they stayed that way for some time.
“The Man of Iron requests if there is a less conspicuous way to return.  He does not want to alert a Nick Fury of your arrival with the slave.”
“Ah…ah…AHHHH!”  Tony came for the second time, followed closely by Thanos.  The warm fluid flooded his insides.  He could feel the large amount oozing out of his ass.  Thanos lowered him and he was still fully seated inside Tony.  Tony had no energy left and found himself flopping down against the Mad Titan’s chest.  Thanos rubbed his back and Tony hated that it felt good.
“Daddy?  Aren’t they beautiful?”  Steve added.  Thanos joined his boys as they gazed upon their new treasures.
“Really?”  He smirked.  “You think you can stop me?”  Tony stood there defiantly.  Thanos raised the gauntlet and suddenly, Tony started screaming as he fell to the ground.  He writhed in pain as Thanos twisted his hand around.
Thanos turned to Captain America.  “And you.  You have great heart.  Your strength is admirable as well.”
When they were finished, they dressed and made their way back to the large common area.  Steve was not sure what clothes to wear so he started placing the shirt and skirt back on when Bucky stopped him.  “No, sweetheart.  You don’t need clothes.”
“Yes, Daddy.”  She shook her head in disbelief.  She was already in so much pain, she could not believe she had to do more.  “Please…”
Loki continued.  “Perhaps, you can provide some instruction and she will require punishment as well.  We have borne witness to her discipline on Midgard and perhaps their ways are lax.  I believe she needs to see a form of Asgardian punishment and perhaps that will be a true deterrent to her bad behavior.”
“No, thank you.”  Steve answered politely as she kept her distance from the stranger.  There was awkward silence for a time before she continued.  “Why am I here?”
Finna hooked the leash to her collar and forced her to crawl on her hands and knees on the irregular hard stone floor.  It felt like an eternity until they stopped.  They were in a room with a single gurney like structure.  The walls were adorned with many objects like chains, cuffs, whips.  Stevie did not have a chance to take in all the inventory.  She was lifted by one of the guards and placed on her back.  Her wrists were cuffed above her head and her legs were spread opened and secured to the end of the table.
Shaking his head violently, Hawkeye busied himself with making sure the heads of all of his arrows were on snug, face flushing. He could blame the heat. It was hot and it was making his face flush! That was all!
"I-I was just gonna put Dr. Banner's fishing stuff in there! But I had the trunk open and shoved the box in, and then you sorta...swerved?" He illustrated a sharp left turn with one hand, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly with the other. "And, wow this's embarrassing, but I sorta had my hand stuck to the tackle box so it didn't open or anything, annnd went into the trunk head-first. And then it slammed shut. With me in there. Sorry?"
Clint stared up at him, tucking his nose under the covers as he stuck a hand out to point across the room.
Arriving at the break in the trees that led to the lake, he relented and let go of Tony’s hand. The billionaire seemed distracted by his phone anyway.
"Thanks," Peter told him, spitting out a bit of seaweed with a grimace. "Um...do you surf, is that why you're dressed like that?"
“Yeah, Cap, it’s fine,” Wade said coolly, brushing Matt’s hand off of his shoulder. “Matt here was just being a tool.”
“I’ll bet Clint would be good at this,” he remarked, tossing it idly in the air instead of throwing it. “He never seems to miss things, even when he’s just throwing something.”
Plunking back into his seat hard enough that the kayak bobbed, Steve started paddling again, turning their boat out to sea. The long lumpy sand bar was dead ahead.
"Thanks, Cap," Peter said with relief. "That means a lot. Don't worry, I've been in over my head plenty of times as Spider-Man and I always figure things out. " He laughed nervously and waved a hand. "I-I mean, in the past! Now I've got you and the other Avengers if I really need help." He glanced off in the direction Tony and Wade had gone, adding more quietly, "You know Tony was asking if he should act like me and Wade were a couple earlier, right? Not you and him."
Deadpool looked up from his TV, tucking whatever he had been eating back into a random pouch on his belt.
At the risk of invading personal space, Bruce placed a hand on the archer's back and rubbed it lightly. That usually made people feel warmer...not to mention it was comforting.
“Oh man! That beach is CLEAN,” Wade announced, slipping past Tony to drop what looked like an umbrella handle into the fire. Pretending to wipe sweat from his forehead, Deadpool looked around at the three of them and grinned. “Something smells awesome!” He sniffed and looked at Tony. “Oh.”
"Is who scary?" Pepper sighed, only half-listening. She was bothered by how Bruce had said that Tony "fixed the power and had to stay there." What had he done?
“Hey, sorry to bother you,” Peter began, stepping inside quickly and tugging Matt along with him. Standing there dripping all over the entryway to the cabin, he instantly felt awkward. It sure looked like the King of Wakanda had been enjoying a leisurely day on vacation, the way a normal person would instead of spending it matchmaking your super-powered parental units…
"In the middle of the night? Are you two, you know. Like," Johnny waggled an eyebrow at him suggestively and tilted his head, "You know. Gettin’ jiggy?"
“Ta…talk to me?” Clint asked, dumbly. “Why me? I’m the least helpful guy around here. Go bother T’Challa.”
“—Ate the whole thing! No swallowing!” Wade explained in disbelief. “Like, Matt’s mouth is bigger than I thought! I told him that and he punched me. Pft. What’s his problem? I eat hot dogs whole ALL THE TIME. My mouth is like a snake's, dude! I told Matt I could dislocate my jaw and he looked at me like I was a moldy burrito…not that moldy burritos are bad. They’re an acquired taste, like Limburger cheese.”
As soon as Tony followed after him, he spotted Clint on the larger couch. After all his whining in the car about being bored and hating the idea of a vacation—the archer was out cold, bruised arms hugged over his stomach as he was snoring.
All of this went through his head fast, or so it felt. He realized he'd stopped laughing a minute ago, though, and was just standing there dumbly still holding Steve's hand, looking out into the ocean where the shark had been. The waves were whipping into little peaks, the wind gusting thick and humid and tossing their hair in the air.
"Agreed," Tony said, raking damp hair back from his forehead. Now that the concern for Peter had calmed down again for the moment, the fact that Cap had pretty much avoided him since they got out of the car returned, and he sighed. "Look, it's late. Let's just...turn in, save any more thinking for tomorrow, huh?"
“You two are playing a really dangerous game,” Tony told them, looking from one face to the other. Hawkeye’s head was tipped as he was trying to read the article around Tony’s hand. “Hulk could KILL you by accident.”
Peter was starting to get a headache. The whole weekends alone thing had been his idea—this thing he read about in a polyamory dating book, a way to get closer to each of his boyfriends one-on-one. He’d bought books about this, why was he still so BAD at it?
"I-I just can't relate to most things on TV, I guess. I haven't really even tried watching it in years..." Bruce shivered. It was weird how warm things could make you shiver if you were cold enough.
“I apologize,” Steve told them both sincerely, all of his sternness melting away. “I know this is very unprofessional and--and it really isn’t any of my business. I’m sorry, you’re right. Of course you’re being careful,” Cap added to Bruce, shoulders slumping. “You have every right to be here and enjoy your vacation. I’m..sorry I bothered you.”
Once they were close enough that the waves washing on the shore hushed out the voices over by the bonfire, Bruce started walking slowly along the edge of the beach, falling into step beside Steve.
Deciding to save Tony, Steve stepped up beside him and turned a couple of pages of the paper to the article about Hulk and Hawkeye—instead of the one about Steve and Tony kissing.
Just then, the doorbell rang, though. Peter web-slung his way toward the front entrance hall in a split-second, shoving his mask back on with the other hand as he went.
"C'mon, Deadpool, Spider-Man might be here too." Probably not, but maybe she didn't want to walk into the basement alone...maaaybe.
Tony had come THIS close to blurting out how he really felt, and suddenly he was grateful for Wade's tendency to interrupt them in the middle of a sentence. Thank GOD he wasn't having to backpedal right now and downplay his own feelings while Steve was all apologetic that he didn't feel that way, himself. Just the thought was mortifying.
Tony winced and doubled forward somewhat, still holding his chest. He wanted to hold up a hand to reassure Thor, but couldn't quite muster the strength to.
Thor, meanwhile, was eating popcorn and looking disturbed about the whole subject matter (but unable to look away, Bruce noted.)
Which was going to happen anyway, if he was ever dating Peter. Though it might be mixed with implied threats, now that Cap knew exactly who he was dealing with.
Pulling on a casual and somewhat sleepy appearance, Clint wandered in past them into the hallway. The moment he was out of sight, he darted all the way down the hall to he and Bruce’s room, which was at the back across from the Team parents’ room. Hopefully they didn’t have to listen to any more of Steve and Tony’s ‘differences of opinion’, as Cap put it, while on vacation.
“Um,” Cap mumbled, clearing his throat. “He’s not, actually. He wanted to grab Wade and head out this morning but I, well I…I asked him to stay.”
Now that HAD to be code for something. Who put spaghetti in a sandwich? Bruce fidgeted nervously as the lights in the shop dimmed down, shadowing both of their faces dramatically.
“Alright,” Matt said quietly, perched on the branch above Peter. “I can hear him talking to himself.”
"We j-just found him wandering around outside." He sucked in a rough breath. "He said he had been l-locked up in a w-warehouse for a few days.
Hugging around his neck with one arm, Tony tried not to be distracted by the gorgeous blond being pressed against him.
It was so unexpected that Peter accepted the hand before it really registered that it was even being offered. He could have easily flipped onto the roof, or crawled up, or web-slung up, and he and Wade both knew it. Deadpool was just weird enough to be unpredictable.
Why, oh why, did this have to be about his dating life so much? Peter hardly had a dating life. He was usually too busy chasing bad guys who dressed like escaped zoo animals and trying to hide his identity.
"We will," Thor said confidently. "Tell me, would he keep moving or stay if he transformed back to Banner?"
"If I get hot dogs with you, then will ya leave me alone?" Peter sighed. He WAS kind of hungry...and now distracted by wondering where Iron Man was off to in such a hurry. He hadn't done a barrel roll to show off or anything—seemed weird.
"...What?" Bruce's eyes were half-lidded, still very near sleep again. Abruptly, he realized that he and Clint were huddled as close as they were, the vest draped over them like a private little tent, and the archer's amused blue eyes were looking right into his.
Steve nodded slowly before pointing to the counter. “I hope you don’t mind, but I put in an order for you…I just got what you usually ask for…” he laughed nervously, “unless it’s different now, of course.
“I kind of feel stupid saying this out loud, but remember when I told you I’ve never had a serious relationship before Peggy? And I’m not that great when it comes to dating, so…needless to say I mixed up signals between Bucky and I…” Steve inhaled deeply.
“Tony…to be honest, I’m really embarrassed…” Steve thought back to the dream he had about Tony before waking up in his bed. He took a deep breath, before looking upward to face Tony who looked sullen. Steve had never seen him look so sad before.
Tony looked over at Steve again as the latter’s eyes grew with terror, indicating that he knew Bruce was referring either to himself, Shuri, or Tony, but also knew Tony would volunteer to go back down to the island.
Tony barely looked at him before looking around hurriedly, but Steve hugged him tighter. The four of them chatted for a bit before Steve and Tony were left alone.
He peered through his fingers to see that the sudden change in topic threw his friend off. “Um, I think so? I’ll have to check my calendar.” Bruce answered, awkwardly.
And it was obvious that Tony had struck a cord with Steve; the object of Tony’s ire/affection was now cycling through a variety of expressions before settling on one that looked remorseful.
Fury chuckled which animated his entire body. “When I said this could be a ‘mentoring opportunity’ I didn’t mean
Tony laughed. “Did Rogers tell you about the device we’re working on? Obviously, I can’t get into specifics, but your roommate here is quite the tech nerd. Although he doesn’t like to admit it.” Tony motioned toward Steve with his fork.
“J.A.R.V.I.S.” Tony’s voice cracked as he called for the computer, “send an email to Banner and Shuri. Have them meet me in the lab tomorrow.”
Tony shook his head again, now trying to get Steve to calm down. “Steve, it’s okay. No one else was hurt…and Strange said you can leave any time soon now…” He attempted to smile but he could tell that Steve was upset.
Bucky looked at Tony. “Before I moved back to the states, Steve and I used to talk every week…but ever since he started working at Stark Industries…I barely see him…”
Obadiah sighed as he spun around to face Fury. “Can’t you override the system?” His voice raised a little, but he still managed to sound unflustered, although a tad exasperated.
Natasha smiled to herself although she was exhausted from worrying about Clint all night. She took her time turning to open the door to the room. As soon as she opened the door, Laura saw her almost immediately, waving for her to come inside, rising from her chair near Clint’s bed to give her a hug.
“I’m not completely sure, actually. I haven’t come across any red flags yet, though.” Steve took a sip out of his beer as he noticed that Bucky was practically glaring at him.
Steve wondered to himself, as he lingered a bit before turning over on his side to face away from Tony.
“Open brackets: delta, epsilon, sigma, aleph, closed brackets. Open brackets: 1456 divided by 356, beth, closed brackets.” Tony began rattling off the solutions to input into the device. Steve worked as quickly as possible; he was still learning which keys on the device created which functions.
“Hey!” Steve and Tony turned around to see that Bucky was back out on top of the airstairs, waving at them to get their attention.
Steve nodded slowly as he leaned forward in his chair. “Of course, Tony. I would have done that for you even if…we…weren’t dating…”
He couldn’t look back at Steve; he knew if he had he would have probably changed his mind and ruined their relationship.
Steve turned his head to see that Tony was trying to keep a straight face but ultimately broke it with another fit of laughter, making Steve groan. Tony was laughing so much as this point that the bed shook from how outrageously loud his laugh was.
Steve could tell the situation was becoming tense from the way Tony had inched closer toward him as Obadiah approached. Tony placed a hand on his back as Obadiah finally reached them; something about it felt unnerving.
As soon as Steve finally met Tony, he reached out his hands, rubbing Tony’s arms as tenderly as possible. Tony choked on the sob he tried to will away before letting Steve pull him into a hug.
Besides Steve had sensed the same change in Tony’s demeanor when he talked about his son that resembled his discomfort whenever Howard Stark was mentioned. Steve put the pieces together and figured that Tony’s father must have been a major source of stress for him and that he was possibly struggling himself with parenting.
“So,” Loki began with a shrug, “can I safely assume that I could receive some sort of immunity for helping you all? I’m putting my life on the line here.”
Bucky had just flown into the city and would be staying for a couple weeks before shipping out abroad for the rest of the year. After that, Bucky would have the choice to continue his service in the states and the three friends were hoping to get a bigger place together in the future.
Tony then groaned as he rested his elbows on top of the table to place his head into his hands. “I have no idea what he wants…” he repeated, “then yesterday he told me he just wanted to be friends and that us sleeping together was a mistake. Like, who does that?”
Tony clenched the pillow underneath him, writhing in his sleep. He tossed and turned in the bed as his recurring nightmare about the night his parents died haunted his half sleep. He finally wrenched himself from the nightmare, sitting up in the bed, covered in sweat.
“Steve, I don’t think I made this clear before,” Steve felt Tony move the hand behind his ear down to rub his waist, “but I don’t care. And honestly, you don’t seem that awkward…well with me anyway.”
"Boytoy then, it doesn't matter," Obadiah interjected, "the thing that does matter is the solvency of this company and Stark Industries can't survive if its namesake is out gallivanting with whomever so happens to be sleeping in your bed at the moment."
Tony nodded, still looking away from Steve. Steve rubbed Tony’s back one last time before taking his time rising from the bed, finding his phone in his pants that had been draped along a chair. He looked once more at Tony before walking to the door, taking his time shutting it close behind him.
Suddenly, Peter broke out into a sprint toward his bedroom, nearly knocking into Steve. Steve watched him scurry away before looking over at Tony.
Tony laughed to himself, although his tone was worn. He placed his hand on his hips. “Well you know how I usually operate when I have something on my mind.” He attempted to joke.
Tony considered Steve’s position; he appreciated his unflinching doggedness, but Tony feared that there could be more danger ahead if they advanced the project. Besides, this was his dad’s legacy, not his. He had no obligation to finish it, even if Tony had figured out how to get the device to work.
Tony clapped his hands together, grabbing his work bag before sprinting out of the lab, now focused on the tasks he needed to complete for the day. He pulled out his phone as he jogged, scrolling through his calendar to look at any important upcoming dates.
Tony had dropped Peter off at school in the morning before visiting Steve before work, but he still wasn’t allowed to see him until the team visited him that late afternoon. May was more than fine with picking up Peter after school so Tony could stay with Steve for a few hours after work before going home to have dinner with Peter. It helped developing some sort of routine but seeing Steve for the first time since the explosion was becoming too much for Tony to bear.
mentor. You’re aware of my past relationship with the tabloids, right?” Tony tried to free himself from Fury’s grasp, but it proved to be too much of an effort. He settled on leaning into it, just enough to maybe make Fury feel a little uncomfortable.
Tony took a bit longer to hand Steve his, smiling in such a way that evoked that arresting magnetism.
“I’ll send out a memo that I’m attending a tech conference thing and I thought bringing you along would be good for team morale, or whatever.” Tony waved himself off as he came up with the elaborate lie.
Steve sighed as he stopped struggling. He looked away from Bucky, knowing he needed to be honest. “Okay, you’re right…” he looked back at Bucky, “I would like to get close to Tony again, but I don’t think he’s willing to start up anything serious again…we haven’t even talked about the break up…”
“Are you all right?” Steve asked quietly. He was leaning forward a bit, hands placed delicately in his lap.
Steve spun around to face Tony. “But, uh…Sam and Bucky are sharing a suite before the wedding.” He tried to reason out loud.
Tony turned to look at the rest of the group behind him before stepping closer toward Steve and Thor. “We have that board event coming up this weekend, so we should act as if business is usual, okay?”
Steve chuckled before Tony continued. “Also…I wanted to thank you again for coming out to the Hamptons with me…that really meant a lot…”
Obadiah laughed quietly as he looked downward. He had twisted his body to the side so that his forearm was on the back of the chair.
As the record spun around, Tony stood next to the player, tapping on it a few times with one finger, appearing to be thinking deeply. Steve continued to watch him before rising from the floor. He walked over to Tony, placing both hands on his waist.
“You know,” Tony could hear Steve begin, “despite how shady everything was, at least you managed to get some info—”
Steve opened his eyes, now staring back at the door. After what felt like an eternity, Steve knew he couldn’t let Tony get away this time.
The officer back away immediately, whipping out her communicator again. “All units stand down. Repeat, all units stand down.”
Steve laughed, feeling as if a huge weight had been lifted. “Well, the bridal party thing is still at T’Challa’s private resort on Long Island. He’s airlifting us in with private planes.”
Everyone chatted for a bit before the group began heading out. Tony lingered, staying behind with Bruce and Natasha. He watched Natasha and Bruce walk toward the exit together; Bruce noticed before nearly jumping out of the way.
“Nice to meet you.” Loki responded with a sly smile. Something about it felt strange, but Steve couldn’t quite place it.
Before reaching his lab, however, a shadowy thin figure moving around in one of the labs with frosted glass captured his peripheral vision. Steve stopped for a second to see what was going on; something about the figure made him feel uneasy. He stood still for a second or two longer before deciding that whatever the figure was up to wasn’t any of his concern, so he continued onward toward his lab.
“I’m sorry,” Tony couldn’t stop laughing, “I forgot to put J.A.R.V.I.S. on mute last night. I usually do when you stay over.”
“We’ll have to run a security background check on you, you know for safety purposes. But yeah, let me know when you want to come over.” Tony beamed at Sam before sipping out of his beer.
Steve slowly nodded, trying to process the events from the night before until that morning. The night before, Tony seemed willing to start over, but something about him suggesting they just have sex bothered Steve.
Instead of taking his hand, the officer gave him the once over. “Yeah, I know who you are, but like I told your boss—”
Steve and Tony were standing near the bar counter alone while the rest of their party chatted in dispersed groups.
They stayed looking at the other liked this for a few more seconds, almost a minute. Tony was still bobbing up and down on Steve’s lap and Steve was tightening his grip on Tony’s waist. Tony then moved inward slowly for another kiss. Steve traced one of his hands up along Tony’s body, meeting his neck to massage before leaning to the side, turning Tony over onto his back so that they were both lying flat on the bed. Tony hugged his legs up against Steve’s sides as Steve let his hands roam.
Tony kept his eyes trained on Steve as he heard Bucky grumble to Sam before the two of them shuffled outside of the room.
Steve looked upward at Tony as the latter straddled his body again. Tony gripped Steve’s cock, rubbing him for a bit before grabbing the tube of lube. He leaned forward to kiss Steve as he continued to rub, rocking his hips forward.
“Yeah, I figured. It could have been a lot worse. But Steve seems like the type who’ll adjust to anything.”
Steve closed his eyes shut, reminding himself to relax. He felt Tony feel from the outside before slowly pushing inward, prompting Steve to moan right on cue.
Tony watched Riri wave at him again from outside the lab as she sprinted down the corridor. He then turned around to place the chip in a small carrying case before placing it into his work bag.
“Hello, everyone, I’m sure you’re excited to hear some great news today…” He paused before shuffling around some papers.
“Fuck, Steve.” Tony let Steve flip them around so that Steve was now on top, holding back Tony’s legs as he fucked him.
Steve backed up against the edge before sitting down. Tony then gently pushed him further onto the bed so that Steve was now lying down. Tony laid down on top of Steve as he kissed him.
troubled at the same time?” Tony asked rhetorically before returning to the photos. Pepper groaned as she watched him.
“Yes, Mr. Stane. Tony’s put on a great event.” Steve looked over at Tony who was grinning at Obadiah as he if were being confronted with a few hundred journalists and their cameras.
Steve nodded back before he turned around to walk to a console, but he still felt sick to his stomach and wanted to avoid looking dejected in front of Bruce.
Tony straightened back up again, grinning at Steve as he squeezed his waist with both hands, taking a moment before reaching over toward his bedside table. He let go of Steve to lean over some more, before losing his balance as he tried to open the drawer, but Steve caught him by the arm.
Steve blushed, but before the conversation could go any further, Clint was in the front of the den at the karaoke machine. He had begun singing the first lines to The Rolling Stone’s “Wild Horses”. Natasha smiled at Steve before she motioned for him to join everyone as they sang along with Clint. Steve settled next to Sam who had been talking to Thor, spotting Tony hanging onto Bruce, both singing along way too loudly. Natasha walked over to stand next Bruce; they looked at each other, both half-smiling at the other before focusing on Clint’s passionate performance.
Steve waited for an answer before getting out of the bed, hurrying out of the bedroom. As he entered the hallway, a strong breakfast scent greeted him at the entrance, leading him through the dining room then the kitchen to find Tony cooking at the stove.
Bruce sighed, bowing his head a little more. He must have been really out of it for leaning on Clint's shoulder to look this appealing.
"I-I know," Bruce said, trying to be dismissive. He didn't manage to keep the glumness out of his voice, though. "It was just to get the Hulk to come out. Well, you win..." He blinked and looked around at the mess his office had become. "...My papers..."
"Don't...don't hurt them," he told the archer, still doing his best to shield both of the other Clints behind him. Realistically, stretching his arms out to the sides didn't cover much of them, but he had to try.
And every time they talked, it turned into a fight lately. Great, Tony thought wearily, sniffling and swiping at his stinging eyes with the back of one hand. That damn onion had been like a pressured gas grenade, he swore. Wade and Peter had beaten a quick retreat as soon as the meat balls were finished, both with tears streaming down their faces. Tony wouldn't be chased out of the kitchen by some vegetable, though. He'd told Steve he had the situation handled, and he was too stubborn not to see it through.
Wade slapped a hand onto the meat blob, sinking his fingers in and ripping the plastic off. He picked a piece of plastic off the top of the handful of raw hamburger he had before he started smashing it into a ball shape.
Steve’s smile faded as he wondered if Loki would try and take revenge on the campers instead of him.
"The residue trail I scanned went from the Baxter Building to the Hudson. I think somebody got on a boat or something after that. The trail goes cold here."
"Yeah, it's nice to relax and watch some FAKE peril for once," Peter joked, sitting cross-legged and leaning back against the side of the couch.
The big power button was the obvious answer to the metal detector dilemma, but that would mean he had to let go of Bruce’s hand to turn it on.
The Avengers were undoubtedly more interesting than clearing up traffic jams from the power outage, so Peter started for their mansion. Hey, maybe Deadpool actually wouldn't be able to bust his way in there...
Peter shook his head. He figured it was none of his business if Loki and Thor were sneak-dating under the rest of the Avengers’ noses, but it was still kinda weird. They sure seemed sincere, though. That was weird, too, when one of them was a literal super villain. Whatever. Even super villains needed vacations and romance, apparently.
"You sure you're okay?" Your face is all red..." Loki persisted, leaning to press a cool palm to Bruce's forehead.
Taking note of the fun reaction that he could get from the actual Hawkeye, Loki smiled at Bruce sweetly.
"Oh ho." The blond wrapped his arm around Bruce's shoulders. "I'm way beyond bath. I'm thinking a bodybag might be in order." He laughed, trying not to shiver visibly.
“You being old doesn’t make me a kid, you know. I’m 18,” he said, crossing his arms. Wade seemed to have completely forgotten the whole ‘pretend we’re just friends when around other people’ plan in the heat of the moment. Great.
Tony sat up in the hammock, sighing and running his fingers through his mussed hair. First a lot of rain and then rolling around in bed meant that it was kind of a curly mess. Whatever.
So, he was supposed to act like he had a crush on Tony? No wait. Cap wasn’t jealous. So, he was supposed to act like he had a crush on Bruce? He actually did, so that would be easy. Not that he was some damn high school kid or something.
"I kissed you too, but you told me not to!" Clint followed him. He took a breath. "Okay. Calm down." Bruce wasn't sure if Clint was actually talking to him, or to himself. The blond continued more softly, "You told me that you couldn't have that kind of relationship. I respected that. But clone or robot—or whatever, I really like you, Bruce." The archer groaned, rubbing his forehead. "I just...don't know what to do about it."
"DROP THE OLD MAN AND BACK AWAY SLOWLY!" The voice was so loud and annoying that it made Steve jump. Standing between them and the way back around the front of the mansion was a dark figure, clad in red and black with twin swords in hand.
“No, Tony,” Cap breathed, settling them both down into the water up to their chests again. A wave washed past them as the First Avenger made sure that the others were still playing frisbee, then he turned anxiously back to Tony. “Peter’s dating someone a-and I guess he’s qu--gay. Please don’t tell anyone, though. He was really worried about his aunt finding out.”
Bruce, who had looked up quickly when Clint fell back, blinked at the fish hook. Softly, he started to laugh. And kept laughing, wrapping an arm around his middle.
“The couch is fine,” he quickly assured Peter. If Peter slept out in the kitchenette area, that left Cap in Tony’s room. Well, their room technically. After all the confusing thoughts last night, sharing a room was bound to be awkward.
"Let's get you to the couch." Ms. Marvel opened the door for them, beckoning to Steve. She had to come over and help him along.
“Isn’t it obvious?” Tony grumbled. “Thor doesn’t want to fight with him. He doesn’t seem to think the civilians in the camp are in danger, either.”
Since the cabin was currently full of people, he made a U-turn and went right outside--and instantly got soaked, since it was still dumping rain out there. Dark, too, but the Arc reactor was like a built in headlight, so whatever. Maybe a little night walk would do him good.
He was doing his best to look on the bright side, but oof, the Spidey tendency to angst was a powerful one. Somewhere in the back of his mind was a little voice freaking out about how Wade was too jealous for this group thing, how Matt felt left-out, how Cap and Tony were somehow gonna arrest both of them and haul them off to villain super-prison…
A familiar flock of giggles sounded behind Peter and he saw a little girl with brown pigtails rushing to join a boy and girl. All were armed with squirt guns.
Peter hadn’t realized he’d been looking glum until he got called on it. Now he shifted in his seat uncomfortably and took an extra long drink of coffee to avoid answering. He couldn’t just out Matt as Daredevil without his permission. Heck, Cap and Tony were probably being so nice to him because they didn’t know about the whole ‘blind Catholic ninja vigilante boxer’ side…
Tony patted Steve on the shoulder. “This particular creation has been giving us trouble lately, but Peter managed to figure out how to get it to move. It’s science, Rogers!”
Peter giggled as Tony said goodnight. After closing the door to Peter’s room, Tony dragged his feet to his bedroom, now feeling woozy from Peter picking up on his feelings toward Steve.
Tony looked at Steve who still looked confused by the situation. “How do you feel?” Tony asked quietly.
Obadiah was back once again in Thanos’s office, but this time the scientist’s unusually small office space was cramped with two other people.
. Steve’s…” He waved a hand around a few times as if that explained who Sharon was while laying heavy emphasis on her name as if it hurt to say it out loud.
Tony spun around quickly to walk up to the counter, swearing to himself. As soon as he paid for their coffees and turned toward their table, he could see Steve walking up to the counter.
Tony shook his head. He wanted Steve and here was the object of his affection practically confirming his feelings.
Tony peeked upward at Steve, trying not to look too shook by Steve basically telling him he would like to see his vacation house someday.
“There’s an ongoing investigation, but that’s all I can say since this is connected to the government.” Tony answered.
“I need Romanov and Barton at S.H.I.E.L.D.,” Fury turned to face the group as they entered the hallway, “the rest of the team I need you all at the medical clinic.” Natasha and Clint followed Fury into an elevator as Tony turned to face the rest of the team.
Steve nodded as he approached Tony again. “Let me know how I can help, okay?” This time Steve kept his hands to himself, probably sensing that he was making Tony uncomfortable.
Steve winced as he tried to hide the bag more behind his back, but he was sure Bucky had already seen what he was hiding.
“I-I uh, well…” Obadiah looked down at the schematics, “I really can’t do much if my hands are tied.”
Tony leaned back on the stool. He posed thoughtfully again as he stared Peter down. Peter managed to keep a straight face as Tony took his time answering.
“J.A.R.V.I.S., can you please prepare the newest private jet for departure.” Tony turned toward Steve.
Tony humped Steve’s body slowly, inhaling deeply before leaning forward to kiss Steve. Steve let go of himself to hold Tony against his body, turning his head to kiss him. They kissed each other for a second before Tony flipped over onto his back, panting heavily.
Steve stopped moving, lying back down on his back to stare up at the ceiling. “I’m trying to read the instructions…” He answered with a frustrated sigh.
Bruce and Steve were standing in the former’s lab one afternoon. Earlier that morning, Bruce had sent Steve an email to meet with him to discuss picking up his tasks with Thor and Shuri as Bruce would be out of town that weekend. Steve also hadn’t seen Tony at all that morning, but he had figured that Tony was busy with administrative-related tasks.
The thought of sleeping with Tony wasn’t itself terrible. Actually, the more Steve thought about it, the more he was into it—But that wasn’t the point; it was the idea that everyone else thought they were sleeping together which bothered Steve. What if people believed he was only accepted into the Synergy program because he was romantically involved with one of its main creators?
“Yeah, I can be pleasant sometimes, Rogers.” He turned his head somewhat to address Steve with a grin before Steve caught up with him.
Tony smiled timidly, but then he shrugged to seem cool about it. “It was fine, I think.” Well, it was more than fine, obviously. Tony appreciated getting to know Steve more which included seeing his place and meeting a close friend of his. He hoped the dinner had improved his chances of getting that date in the future.
He leaned forward, drawing his knees up to his chest, crying to himself as the memories continued to torture him. The whole night had been a complete disaster.
Thor pointed to the back of the space. Steve nodded as he continued to follow him. They passed the main space before entering another small hallway lined with some people leaning against the walls and chatting. Steve and Thor continued until they found an unmarked door at the very end of the hallway, hearing voices on the other side.
Tony tried to move, but a wave of pain shot throughout his body as he realized that his right arm had been mangled from the blast.
Tony yelped out loud, realizing that he had lost track of time. He whipped out his phone, tapping on his security app, seeing that Steve was indeed in the lobby. Tony pressed the button that allowed visitors to access the private express elevator before backing up against the kitchen island.
“You are so fucking sexy, baby…” Tony whispered as Steve began grinding faster and harder against his body.
Steve shook his head as best as he could considering that he was lying face down. His breath hitched as he felt Tony grab his ass again before squeezing it. He heard Tony squirt more lube into his hand. He felt Tony rub his body a few times before he felt a hand drawing nearer. Steve squeezed his eyes shut as he felt Tony rub him a little with the tip of his finger.
Steve nodded slowly as he rose from the table. Bucky sighed, but then started teasing Steve to get him to lighten up. Soon after, they left the apartment to grab dinner at their favorite diner from across the street before heading to the local movie theater.
He braced himself with both hands before pushing himself away from the bed. At first, everything appeared fine as he stood up; Steve grinned, fully thinking that his strength was finally back. He took one step forward, falling forward as his legs gave out underneath him. He hit the floor face first, taking the bedside table down with him as his arms flung about trying to grab hold of something. The incident caused the noisiest crash as Steve laid stretched out on the floor, struggling to get up.
Bucky eyed Tony, clearly assessing whether he was serious. Tony knew he would have to play along; being close with Steve meant having some sort of relationship with his friends and making sure he was on their good side, especially with Steve’s best friend.
“Really?” Steve gawked at his friends, “of all the times when the two of you should be clamoring to offer your opinions?”
Sam laughed. “Yeah, okay, Steve.” He chugged the rest of his beer before tossing the bottle toward their recycling bin. It bounced off the edge. Sam groaned as he walked over to pick up his discarded bottle.
“…but would you like to stay the night? I know this sounds selfish, but I don’t want you to leave just yet… whenever I talk about the night my parents died…I—have nightmares. I don’t like waking up alone after one…” He voice was low and steady. Steve had never heard him like this before.
“Fuck. I need to pick him up. I forgot to schedule a pickup with Happy. But yeah sure.” Tony sighed with so much anguish in his voice that it caused Rhodey to look up from Steve’s file, startled.
Tony knew Clint’s assault had something to do with the device. His attack didn’t make much sense without considering that crucial factor. He knew there were people out there, beyond Obadiah, who wanted to get their hands on the device, but Tony never thought the project would become this dangerous.
“Yeah, that sounds good. I’ll send you a text when we get in.” Tony said goodbye to Rhodey before hanging up. He took another deep breath, trying to remember his breathing exercises from one of his therapy sessions before turning around to reenter the lab. Steve was still busying himself at his console.
“Besides…there might be something that you thought you enjoyed that you probably aren’t into anymore…” Tony took a deep breath before continuing. He reached out a hand to rub Steve’s waist, pulling him close, slipping a thumb underneath the band of his briefs.
Tony stared at the closed door. He knew Rhodey was referring to their last conversation in which Tony had given Rhodey the full rundown on his first impressions of Steve Rogers. Was he that obvious? He must have been if Rhodey had felt the need to show him support, or a sly warning of sorts?
“Fortunately, my dearest Jane managed to find me. I don’t know where I would be without her. She had our compass!” Thor gave Steve the heartiest laugh from his otherwise banal story. He then slapped Steve on the shoulder.
Tony nodded sternly thinking back to Loki admitting to the team that Thanos was using Selvig to build a super weapon.
Tony waved his hand. “Yeah, yeah sure. Now get back to work.” Steve watched the three leave before turning to face an image of the Synergy device Tony was playing around with.
. Tony felt like leaving. What was the use? Steve seemed willing then would always pull back. Maybe he shouldn’t have touched him, but it felt like he could. Tony beat himself up over reading too much into things then sighed thinking that he definitely blew his chance with Steve.
Bruce shook his head. “I don’t know, but we can use the device to generate some equipment to find it. Natasha has the equations for trackers S.H.I.E.L.D. uses.”
Steve laughed at the suggestive tone in Tony’s voice. He opened his eyes again to see that Tony was sitting on the edge of the tub.
Tony continued in and out of him, groaning with every movement. Steve moaned as he felt his body push into the mattress; he could feel himself coming near the edge, and the feeling was unbelievable. Steve gasped and moaned, losing himself as Tony fucked him. He reached downward to feel himself, but then stopped. He then felt a hand on his cock as Tony stroked him and fucked him at the same time.
remembered Steve Rogers. The day of the law student’s final interview, Tony hadn’t planned on joining the rest, but decided that he should see the last pool of applicants just in case he needed to make an executive decision. That day, however, had been a total nightmare. There had been multiple deadlines looming in the air that had nothing to do with Synergy and Tony had been awake for days prior to the interview.
“Wow…you are such an ass.  You’re only thinking about the uses he has for your team.  You ever think how hard this is on Steve?  You’re heartless.”
She looked to Bucky for approval.  He nodded as he caressed her cheek.  “Thank you, Daddy.”  She stood up and limped into the house.  She had taken all three men in her pussy multiple times that day and she was sore.
“What’s going on with everybody?!”  Peter said as he looked around.  “They’re back!  That’s what we all wanted!”
In the morning, Steve was the first to rise.  He felt such warmness encompassing him.  He was so grateful that Tony was here with him.  He did not want to move, but unfortunately nature called.  He slowly extricated himself from Tony and walked to the room to relieve himself.  When he returned, Tony was up and also took care of his business.
“Good.  Now it is time for your next lesson.”  Finna attached her leash again and called for an attendant.  They traveled to another part of the stable.  Stevie was secured again to a table.  Her legs were placed in stirrups leaving her legs splayed open and her core front and center.
“Yes, Daddy.”  She replied quietly as she tried to force down the growing anxiety within her.  She did not want to incur their wrath.  Their recent punishments had been so horrific and painful, she promised herself she was going to be on her best behavior.  Steve hated that they had this control over her, but she couldn’t handle so much pain.  She vowed to try her hardest to be good…she knew everything they did to her hurt; but if she gave her best, maybe they would be gentler.
She stood awaiting their instruction.  “Go lay on the bed.  Thor and I have ached for your pussy for many weeks.”
Thanos leaned down and placed his big thick hand on Tony’s head and caressed his hair.  “Oh, Anthony.  One day you will not think so.”  He raised the gauntlet and Tony could not even cry out as the light took him as well.
“I feel you through her, beloved.”  Thor gasped as he punched up as much as he could.  Sweat trickled from Loki’s brow as he thrust in and out of Stevie.  He leaned over his shoulder to kiss his older brother, both enjoying the tight holes but reveling in the fact they could feel each other’s cocks through the body between them.  Steve’s sobs were muffled between the large men.
“Of course I know, Buck.  You are important to me too.”  He said, as oblivious as ever to Bucky’s underlying meaning.
“You are needed in New York.  There have been a few threats since you and the boys decided to take a god damn vacation without informing me.”
“I’m about to get her.”  Bucky said as he tightened the strap on his robe and sauntered towards the bedroom.  He had left Stevie restrained by cuffs onto the bed after he had forced him to shower and cleanse himself after sharing him with Tony that morning.  Hopefully Steve was well rested.
“When my brother uses his Seidr for life saving purposes, it is a significant drain.  He shall recover by morning.  Is there a room I can lay him down?”
“Y-Yes, Daddy…I understand.”  Steve added, fearful that he would be electrocuted if he did not comply.  He forced his shaky legs to return to Thor’s side.
“Shh…Stevie…look at me.”  He smiled at him.  “Good…now it might hurt for a second but I promise you I’ll make you feel so good, baby…okay?”
Steve started crying hysterically as she crawled closer to Sif’s core.  She shook as she opened her mouth to use her tongue on the area.  Sif was inpatient and only after a minute or two, she shoved Steve away from her.
“Damn, Stark.  I must admit…this is fucking beautiful.”  Bucky nodded as he gazed upon the large Olympic sized infinity edged pool and beyond that the expansive ocean and beach.
“Oh, Steve…you are doing so well…”  Tony tried his best not to choke him or go faster than he could accommodate.  He was moved back and forth inside the warm heat.  “Oh…Oh…I’m going to cum…”  Tony moaned as he started to withdraw from the welcoming mouth.  It was embarrassing how soon he needed to climax.
“I seem to recall telling you boys I do not intend to repeat myself.”  He stared at Steve.  “Get. On. The Bed, Little One.”
“Bucky…”  Steve extricated himself from Bucky and tumbled onto the floor.  He pushed himself up and ran towards the elevator.
When Finna returned, Steve was practically blue in color from the cold.  She was so little; she had no insulation to even attempt to keep warm.  A guard dragged her out and brought her to another chamber and she was wrapped in an animal pelt.  She was placed on the floor and Finna walked in and sat on a comfortable chaise.
“Get the fuck away from us, Grimace.”  Tony spat out, hoping he’d leave them alone for a time.  Steve was in no shape to do anything else at this point.
“You know what is amazing?”  He started as he ran his hand gently over Steve’s shoulders.  “That you never noticed how
Tony lifted her off and placed her on the bed.  He grabbed the remote and pressed the button, causing a shock to flow through her.  Steve screamed in pain as she writhed on the bed.  He released the button and looked down at the whimpering girl.  He picked her up and brought her over to the kitchen where the others were.
Bruce stepped up; he was the only one not holding a gun.  He had a tablet.  “It’s interesting what you can learn if you access JARVIS’ database.”  He said in an eerie, calm voice but his eyes flashed green.  “Fury contacted me…he thought it was odd the way you acted every time he asked about Steve.”
“I see.”  Strange responded as he stepped closer to her.  “May I?”  He asked permission.  “I do not need to touch you.”
The trial was not held in a traditional court of law.  The case was presided over by the World Security Council at the Raft, where Stark, Barnes and Barton had been held since their arrest.
Tony was feeling tipsy as he continued to imbibe in his drink.  “Instead of sitting up there all mopey and shit, we could show Steve a good time.”
“Not gonna lie…”  Tony said as he gathered his stuff up and they all began to walk back into the mansion, “I’m a bit jealous you get to take her there.”
“Daddy.”  She lowered her head as she said it.  Bucky grasped her chin and lifted her head so she could look in his eyes.  “I want you to apologize to Tony and the others for being such a bad girl.  It hurts their feelings.  They are just as important as Daddy.  In fact, since they help me keep you in line, I think they deserve to be called Daddy as well.”  He tilted his head at the shocked look on her face.  He lifted her off and placed her on her knees on the floor.  “Crawl to your Daddy Tony and apologize.”
The younger brother smirked as he lifted the golden rope and followed Thor.  They reached their destination after some time.  Two royal guards were posted on each side of the entrance to the room.  They bowed to the princes and opened the door.  The ancient entryway was over 30 feet tall.  The brothers stepped inside, and Steve had no choice to follow.  In the distance sat King Odin on his gigantic golden throne.  He was an intimidating figure as they approached.  The walkway was lined with Imperial soldiers guarding their King.  There were at least fifty of them.  They all bowed in succession as the brothers passed.
Steve tried so hard not to cry.  His whole body hurt, he was humiliated time and time again by the man he thought was his best friend.  He thought they were with each other ‘til the end of the line.  He did not even know his best friend anymore…the monster he had morphed into.  Steve knew there was no escape from him…from Tony…from any of them.  He slowly lowered himself to his hands and knees and traversed the short distance to Bucky.  Cum was oozing from his torn anus.
“Yes, Daddy.”  She answered and pushed herself up, ignoring the pain in her groin and lowered herself onto the waiting, leaking dick.  Thor grasped her petite hips hard as he lifted her up and down on his straining cock.  “Fuck…so good…”  He groaned.  “So tight…best pussy out there…”  He moved her up and down.  Despite Loki’s lube slicking her channel, there was a considerable amount of pain.
Loki grabbed her hand as they made their way to the pool deck.  Thor placed her other hand in his large one.  Steve was dwarfed between the two Asgardians.  To an outside observer, the two tall men flanking her appeared to be in a protective stance, but Steve knew better.  She tried to keep from crying and shaking in fear as Thor looked up at the heavens and announced calmly, “Heimdall.”
Tony tried not to react at Thanos mentioning his dad.  He knew the gauntlet allowed him to see these things, but he did not need to bring it up.
“Yes, Mr. Stark.  Absolutely.” The man nodded as he looked down at the petite woman in front of him.
Tony’s tightened his grip in her hair and brought her closer, burying her face in his wiry pubic hair.  She struggled for a moment and then he let up.  “Suck.  Make me cum.”  He commanded and Steve proceeded to work hard to obey.  He groaned as she expertly sucked him off and yelled out in pleasure as he ejaculated down her spasming throat.  “Damn…so fucking good.”  He said as he pulled off and stood on shaky legs to grab another cup of coffee.
Bucky sighed as he grasped his face.  “Enough of that.”  He warned.  “You have a pussy and tits.  You are my sweet little girl.  Do you understand, honey?”  His eyes narrowed as he started to fondle his breasts.  “Say it, Stevie.”
He turned his gaze to Stark.  “You hated me all along.  Probably from some shit Howard did or said.  You never even tried to get to know me.”  He chuckled bitterly.  “The funny thing is, Howard and I weren’t even friends.”  He shook his head.  “Nothing to say, huh?  Hmm…probably don’t want to incriminate yourselves further. I get it.”  He took a deep breath and stood.  “I could kill you both with my bare hands and not even break a sweat.”  Both men sat up a little straighter but still said nothing. “But…I’m better than you both.  I wouldn’t do that.  You are broken people and nothing can change that.”  Steve turned and left.
“Sweetheart,” Bucky started, “come over to Daddy, honey.”  He watched Steve struggle to slide down the bench and walk over.  “No, baby.  Crawl to Daddy.”
Lady Sif moaned as her hands grabbed onto Stevie’s long locks.  She started pushing her pussy into the eager mouth.  Sif arched and groaned in pleasure.  Her juices started flowing as Stevie tried her best.  She slipped a finger in like she was taught and hit the right spot, because suddenly Lady Sif screamed out as her release hit her hard.  She was convulsing in pleasure as she pulled on Steve’s hair so tight that it felt as if it would rip out.  She collapsed back against the chaise as she breathed heavily with exertion.
“Those will remove your super human strength for now, Steven.  It would not be fair to your brother for you to be stronger at this time.”
Neither of them answered, because Thanos already knew the response.  If given the choice, they would not return to earth.  They could not freely admit it, but that was the case.  However, Thanos admired their selflessness.  He knew once this was done, his boys would be truly his.  They would erase at least one of their greatest failures.  They could clear their conscience and truly move on as the Children of Thanos.
She took a few deep breaths.  “I’m n-not special…I’m j-just a kid from B-Brooklyn…”  Her lips trembled as tears fell.
Natasha gazed at Steve.  “How did you get away from Thanos?”  She paused.  “How did you get off of Titan?”  She asked Tony.
“To pick up a few things.”  Tony responded with a smirk.  He bent down slightly and gestured with his hands in an upward motion and suddenly roots from the Earth emerged and surrounded Natasha, Sam, Bruce, T’Challa, Clint, and the Dora Milaje.  As they attempted to break free from the confines, Tony turned to Bucky and Peter and the roots wrapped around their middle as he made a circular motion with his hands.  He made a forward motion and Bucky and Peter began floating towards the ship.  A glowing light came from the ship rendering the two unconscious as they disappeared towards Thanos.
“Right…and you’ve been so kind yourself.  Pretty sure my dad didn’t practice incest, so he has one up on you.  Tell me…did you get off fucking the Maw, ‘cause I have to say, he wouldn’t have done it for me.”  Tony should have expected the slap across his face, but it still hurt like a mother fucker.  He cried out as he fell to the ground.  Steve struggled out of bed to help him up.
“You told me on the fucking phone before we came out here that you weren’t ready to be in a relationship,” Tony threw some clothes around without really picking anything to wear, “yet, we fucked last night and then you follow me into the shower. What the
“Rogers.” Tony placed the device down on a table before rounding it to walk over toward Steve. He stopped a few feet in front of him.
“Okay, I’m heading home, Cap.” Sam drained his beer before getting up to retrieve his jacket. Steve made a move to join him.
handled.” Thanos grinned slightly, emphasizing the word “handled” for effect. The grin was marred by a wicked scar on his chin. Obadiah flashed back the most PR looking smile he could muster, without cringing.
As Steve’s fingers finally made contact with Tony’s face, prompting an “oh” from the latter, the jet shook somewhat from turbulence, launching Steve’s body forward into Tony’s lap. Tony laughed as he caught him.
Peter and Ned high fived each other before Tony handed Peter the tablet they used to control the robot. Everyone took a step back as Peter tapped a few times on the tablet. It took a second or two before the reactor in the middle of the robot’s chest lit up. The robot’s body dipped up and down, swerving side to side.
Tony squinted at whatever Steve was referring to, recognizing the file immediately. “Ah, you found my birthday database.” He winked at Steve.
Tony moaned as he continued to come, hugging Steve’s neck, tighter than usual from the feeling. Steve finished before lying next to Tony who was a mess from the both of them coming on his stomach.
Steve sighed as he shook his head. “No…well…it’s just…it’s…” He tried to get the words out, but everything about the situation with Tony and Synergy was strangling his thought process.
Steve shrugged. “It’s probably a power move.” He answered casually, sipping out of his water glass as he watched a few couples dance.
As soon as Steve opened the door to the apartment, Sam was in the middle of making coffee for himself in the kitchen. He turned around to face Steve, snickering as he cooled down his coffee.
Tony rolled his eyes. “The charge on the new Stark X is terrible. I need to hang out at Steve’s a bit longer then I’ll probably call a car.”
“And like I said, you can talk to me about it whenever you’re ready. I know since taking Peter in you’ve been getting better, but I also know it still helps to talk...”
Tony shrugged; he didn’t want Steve to think he was pulling away. He was mostly concerned that he would turn into an emotional wreck in front of him.
He pointed to the other side of the bed where there was a bedside table. Tony took his time before walking toward the table, reminding himself not to be weird, play cool, don’t say something stupid or do anything stupid.
Tony chuckled as he walked further into the bathroom to lean up against a counter. “I’m supporting you, Rogers. Glad to know that those therapy sessions are paying off.”
Thanos stopped in his tracks causing Obadiah to almost run into him from behind. “If I don’t go further, I won’t achieve my goals which is what this entire process has been about.”
Tony frantically chopped an onion into perfectly sliced rings before throwing it onto a serving plate.
“Steve, you should call him…” Bucky paused, “…when have I ever steered you wrong? I’m with you till the very end…even when you’re too busy to hang out.” He teased.
As he took his time reacting, Steve’s expression began to change slightly, now expressing concern that Tony hadn’t reciprocated.
Tony hugged his body as he felt his eyes well up. He knew he wouldn’t be able to compose himself in front of Steve. There was another long distressing pause as Steve stayed behind Tony and Tony tried to stop himself from crying.
“Oh, my roommate will be there. Just to let you know.” Steve quickly added, squashing that dream. He wanted to spend more time with Tony, but he also didn’t want it to seem like it was a date, you know, in case Tony wasn’t actually interested in him.
“…has created its newest tech, the Synergy device.” Tony then motioned behind himself as a holographic image of the device appeared above the stage. He walked around it as he continued to speak, and the device spun around and pulled apart in unison.
Rhodey nodded slowly, making it clear that he wanted to give Tony a moment. However, Tony ignored Rhodey before switching the conversation back to Synergy as best as he could, but now all he could think about was seeing his family’s house out in the Hamptons for the first time in the longest time.
“Jutenheim has an excellent kitchen! You should try it next time you crash a party here!” He shouted with glee before running into something that felt like a solid brick wall. Loki bounced off the obstacle, falling backward onto his backside. He sat up, rubbing the back of his head, looking upward to see that Thor had blocked his path.
Steve nearly choked from the slap, but he couldn’t help but laugh with Thor. “I’m glad she found you.”
Pepper motioned with her hands for Tony to keep his voice down. “Everything Obadiah said about the termination and the arrest checked out. Loki’s lab hadn’t been producing anything substantial, and he stole some equipment…that’s why Obadiah had him arrested…”
Steve remained still, hoping Dr. Selvig hadn’t noticed him spying through the glass. He watched the scientist stride quickly down the corridor.
Tony smiled as he moved inward to kiss Steve. Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s body, pulling him close to his body. Tony kissed Steve as he rubbed his body with both hands.
Steve smiled as he looked downward at Tony. “Of course, Tony. I completely understand. I can make you dinner.”
The staffer nodded empathically. “We set Mr. Stane up in one of the nicer conference rooms, but we haven’t seen him since yesterday…”
Tony made a face, mostly at learning that Bucky and Sam might have been trying to inadvertently cockblock him.
Steve laughed before kissing Tony again, taking his hand as he walked toward the entrance of the balcony. They walked back into the loft, saying goodbye to everyone before waiting for Happy to drive them back to the Tower.
“It’s strange that Obie would be in contact with low-level buyers. He would have to prove to the board that he has a big enough client base to redirect the company…” Tony grappled with himself but deliberated aloud for Steve.
better stories to be told. No one is ever going to forget Howard Stark.” He then walked briskly toward the house.
Their waiter appeared again with their food saving Tony from any further embarrassment. The two remained quiet for some time, eating in silence save for a few non-related remarks.
“Sam’s in his room on the phone with T’Challa talking about some last-minute ceremony things.” Bucky explained as he sat down at the table.
Steve leaned forward in his seat. “How did you manage to track him down, Fury?” He was sitting next to Natasha, Clint, and Shuri who had cut her honeymoon short to fly back into the city after the team found out about Thanos.
Shuri turned around to point at the section of the device she was referring to. Both Tony and Bruce nodded timidly as they approached the table to get a better look.
He turned away from Natasha as he leaned up against a table. “…I didn’t know how dangerous this was going to become…,” he inhaled before continuing, “…I was trying to go about this as safely as possible…”
Sam rose from the table, rapping on it lightly with his knuckles. “Nothing’s going to be solved tonight. Let’s get dinner then see a movie.”
Everyone settled before they began to eat. Tony asked Peter about his day, prompting Peter to give both Tony and Steve a lengthy rundown that involved him and his best friend, Ned, discovering that there was something amiss about the latter’s cat.
Obadiah crossed his arms as he watched Loki reach the door to exit the office. “Anthony should be in Dr. Banner’s lab and Mr. Rogers is out to lunch…”
“We also managed to steal Dr. Blake away from an astrophysics lab in New Mexico.” Fury explained, refusing to use Thor’s nickname.
Tony cocked his head to the side, smiling as he leaned up against the wall behind him. Steve could feel himself losing control over his emotions, which was rare for him. He realized that he and Tony were trying to work through some things but thought Tony would have put aside the argument over the diary to talk about Synergy.
“Hey, Tony…” Steve waved at Tony before quickly shoving both hands into the front pockets of his pants as he walked into the foyer.
Bruce backed away to look at the projection from another angle. Tony walked away from the console, stopping at a table to cross his arms.
“Uh, what?” Tony turned his body to face Rhodey after having been too caught up in snooping on Bruce and Natasha.
Tony sighed before slowly getting out of the bed. He nearly dropped his phone as he reached to check it.
Tony grinned as he removed his hand from Steve’s thigh. “Okay, well then I think after the day we had, maybe we could start over?”
“My best friend told me recently that you should just go for something if you want it. What do you have to lose?” The words felt surreal as soon as he uttered them.
“I know you wouldn’t, Tony…” He responded quietly, placing both hands on Tony’s face before kissing him.
Instead of responding right away, Thanos laughed. Tony sighed, looking over at Steve before slamming his fists on the table.
The door narrowly propped open; Steve’s head poked into the room. He looked concerned. Tony exhaled to himself as he realized it was only Steve.
Tony nodded as he listened, feeling his body ease a bit. However, it was still too difficult to talk about his relationship with his dad. Tony mentally cycled through his memories of his dad, eventually landing on the last time they spoke to one another: the evening both his parents died.
Steve nodded once more. “Would you like for me to stay? I just need to get some case files from the office.”
Before their argument, Tony had made plans to see Steve that night, but he figured those plans had been ruined by his rampant paranoia. During the work week, Tony had managed to avoid Steve by either working in his office or scheduling as many meetings as possible, yet Steve never made a move to reach out to Tony which was making him feel just as horrible as he did the last time he saw him.
Suddenly, the live band’s singer paused before singing a rendition of Billie Holiday’s “I’ll Be Seeing You.” Tony gulped as he quickly looked over in Steve’s direction, remembering that that had been the song playing while he and Steve kissed for the second time after their argument over the failsafe.
“So, what happens next?” Steve interjected, “will Peter need to take this class over?” He had placed a hand over Tony’s who grasped it tightly from his brief heated moment with Mr. Beck.
Tony shuffled before looking away. He slowly turned his head to look at Steve again. “…because it was with me, right?” He asked.
Bruce shook his head. “Loki, you have no idea about the amount of damage you’ve already caused so I would cool it with the assumptions.”
“Sam? Are you serious? Tony? And me? Sleeping together?” Steve pointed to himself before uncrossing his arms. He huffed a little as he pushed himself away from the counter before settling again.
Tony laughed again but it was more subdued this time. He pulled Steve closer toward his body before gently caressing his face.
proud, Mr. Barnes.” She offered, making it obvious that she wasn’t aware of Tony disclosing his relationship with Steve.
“I don’t think we can apologize enough for what happened,” Steve quickly dashed Tony’s daydreaming, “but Tony, we could probably do something for the school.” Steve looked at Tony before nodding in the direction of the principal. Tony looked back and forth between Steve and the principal, but he wasn’t entirely sure what Steve was getting at.
Tony stood off to the side to let everyone greet Steve. He scanned the loft, realizing that the board had invited every single one of Stark Industries’ investors and some potential investors. As his eyes wandered, he spotted Obadiah making his way over to the group, grinning eagerly.
Tony kept his back facing him; he could hear small sniffling noises which prompted tears to slide down his own face.
Rhodey sighed before answering. “Fine, Tony. Just do what you need to do to keep everyone safe and the project running. Although, and it pains me to say this, I have no doubt you will.”
Bruce nodded slowly. “…I’m really sorry, Tony. But maybe you and Steve should talk first before doing something drastic…” He offered quietly.
Tony laughed heartily before taking Steve’s hand, leading him toward the kitchen. “Peter and I don’t usually cook, but we thought it would be nice to make something special for dinner that was more than two ingredients and not breakfast related.”
As the song wound down, Tony stood up and bowed theatrically. He motioned toward the band before walking toward Steve.
Tony swallowed a lump in his throat before straightening himself out. He took a moment, walking as calmly as possible to the elevator.
Tony turned his head again to stare at Rhodey. That could have been the case; Steve wasn’t really himself after he drank a few glasses of Thor’s Jörmungandr—actually, Tony remembered that Steve hadn’t appeared drunk until after glass four or five, while everyone else had been hammered after the second or third. But Tony was fixated on his own actions. He had come to accept that if he had cut them off in the elevator, Steve would have stayed. Now Steve probably thought that all Tony wanted from him was just sex.
“What’s Dr. Banner talking about, Tony?” The words sounded so stern that Tony couldn’t even look Steve directly in the eye.
The security officer nodded a few times before motioning for his subordinates to receive instructions. After a moment, Obadiah was left nearly alone in the lobby. He turned to watch the guards hand Loki off to some police officers who then shoved him into an unmarked police car. Obadiah grinned to himself before whipping out his phone to place a call.
Obie, wasn’t it?” He finally broke away from Steve, marching up to Loki, “he was the one who let you into the building and the lab, didn’t he?”
“You’ll be fine. Also don’t talk about work. It’s cute sometimes, but not all the time.” Tony wagged a finger at his friend before turning to face a console.
Tony continued to stare at Steve, clearly ruminating over his comment. He laughed to himself before slowly approaching Steve.
Steve could feel his face turn red as he rested his hands on his hips. “I think they might be a little too flashy.”
Steve chuckled as he awkwardly got back onto the bed and handed Tony the lube and the condom. Tony pulled Steve downward and kissed him before turning him back onto his side. Steve heard Tony open the tube and his breath hitched as he felt Tony squeeze his body again; he could feel his body reacting with anticipation as Tony took his time feeling him before entering a finger.
Both Steve and Bucky glanced at the other, signaling to each other that they knew the board member assumed they were dating. Steve smiled as he crossed his arms while looking downward and Bucky let out a hearty laugh.
During the final round of interviews, Steve had finally met Tony Stark, the man in charge of Project Synergy. Meeting Tony Stark had never been a life goal of Steve’s, but the idea was cool, nevertheless. Well to his friends at the very least. Sam and Bucky Barnes (Steve’s oldest friend from childhood) were completely obsessed with their more reserved friend’s chance to work with a celebrity. They had seemed more excited for him than he had been for himself.
Thankfully, the conversation eventually morphed into something less tensed. They chatted a while until the waiter came by to take their orders.
“Tony, this is Bucky. Steve’s friend from when they were kids.” Sam motioned toward Bucky with his hand still on Tony’s back. Tony grinned, reaching out his hand to shake Bucky’s, but Bucky appeared hesitant.
Bruce sighed again; he shuffled around, trying to look away from Tony. “…I told Steve about the trip…I also lied about mixing the dates up so you would ask him to go with you…”
“Okay, maybe you were a little, right.” Tony teased as he looked downward at Peter who was smiling back up at him.
“Oh, nice. Would love to meet a friend of yours.” Tony lied, his teeth practically gritting against one another.
“You’re becoming quite the crowd favorite around here, Rogers.” Tony grinned as he climbed into bed next to Steve after taking his usual shower.
Bruce swiveled his head back and forth, now embarrassed that Tony had overheard him asking Natasha out for drinks.
“Uh, I think it’s time for me to take my leave.” He said to himself, jumping up from behind the table, first trying to walk past the fight, but then breaking out into a run to get away as quickly as possible.
“Hey, Tony, sorry we couldn’t make it to your party over the weekend. Family members are starting to arrive in town for the wedding.” She rolled her eyes.
“…Ned and me are going to enter the robot in the science competition.” Peter explained. He was sitting close to Tony at the table in the kitchen.
Tony nodded again as he talked Steve through manually setting up the detonator. They worked quickly and efficiently together, almost as if they were working in the lab during a normal working day back before they lost control over Project Synergy. Steve pressed the last few buttons as the detonator automatically set up the original countdown before the Synergy device set off the reactionary blast.
“Indeed, and while the device has done some good in the past, most significantly stopping a virus from spreading widely, it’s difficult seeing this project moving forward after this…”
Steve smiled as he awkwardly hugged her. Natasha eyed them both, making Steve feel incredibly anxious. But instead of saying anything Natasha smiled at them before making a move to walk away.
Tony cringed as soon as he spotted his pseudo business rival, Justin Hammer, greet him with open arms. Hammer was standing at the table he had reserved for them at an overly priced restaurant in midtown. Tony lingered a few feet away from the table, glaring at Hammer. Hammer stuck out his hand for Tony to shake who ignored it before sitting down at the table.
Fury chuckled before clasping Steve’s shoulder again. He gestured toward the door. Steve exhaled deeply before nodding his head. He took one more deep breath as he let Fury brush past him to open the door into the conference room. Steve hesitated as Fury continued into the room, walking past a few people as he made his way to the front of the table.
“Dr. Banner, who works here at Stark Industries. One of their best scientists.” Fury pointed to the anxious looking man next to Natasha.
“I don’t know if this is out of line, which it probably is because I’m kind of known for that…” Tony began, still smiling, but Steve had noticed that his expression appeared reserved, commenting to himself that this was a first. Steve turned slightly to intently watch Tony finish his statement.
Steve nodded before following Bucky out into the living room, but the latter motioned for him to stand further away out of ear shot of Tony and Peter.
“Make the world a magical fairytale with lollipops and rainbows, right? Or have the plans changed on me once again?”
Bruce waited a second before going back to describing his lab work to Steve, but Steve could hardly pay attention as he thought about Tony closing off to him.
“I’m just being realistic, Tony—” But before Bruce could finish his thought, Tony shouted “Rhodes!” as Van Morrison sang again “…I shall reveal you.”
“How’s everything? Seeing anyone new?” Strange crossed his arms as he studied Tony, backing away slightly to look at him more directly.
The three of them worked quickly to disassemble the robot before wheeling it to the entrance of the gymnasium. As soon as they entered, they found the auditorium teeming with busy students, their parents, and the teachers. The group found a space for the robot in an unoccupied corner. Peter and Ned worked to reassemble their robot as Steve and Tony watched from the side.
He was suffering from lack of sleep and had almost called in sick at the public defender's office. As his mind raced since Tony left last night, Steve came to the realization that he had gotten too close to Tony since they started spending more time together, too close to the point that for a brief moment when they were on the couch, Steve had considered accepting Tony’s advances.
“There are a few people I would like to introduce you to, Mr. Rogers.” Obadiah wrenched Steve away from Tony, nearly dragging him toward a group of people on the other side of the loft, “you’ll recognize some of our board members and some of Stark Industries longest standing investors, but we thought it would be good to have you talk with a few potential ones…”
“Look, Steve. You would tell me if you were, right?” Sam tried to regain some control over his facial expressions. He looked sternly at Steve.
Tony shook his head. “No. It says in the file they’re based internationally, but I’m sorely aware of most if not
Steve listened to Tony ramble on about the suits as he smiled to himself. The past week, he felt himself becoming more comfortable being with Tony which meant he found himself becoming more comfortable with Tony’s sense of humor, especially when it verged on the sexual side.
Tony sat hunched over a table in the lab, pretending to do work, but really thinking about Steve. Occasionally, his mind would slip back to the present, realizing that he had been so consumed with thinking about Steve all morning that he hadn’t turned on any music which was usually a part of his morning routine.
Tony nodded as he swallowed a lump that had formed in his throat from his emotions wreaking havoc on his psyche.
“I got you something, too, but I knew you were going to whine the whole trip.” Tony waved around a smaller square box.
Tony proudly explained Steve’s recent contribution as everyone else around the room looked very impressed. Steve’s whole body flushed, but the coloration in his face was now mostly due to Tony still holding on to him as he continued to speak. At one point, before letting go, Steve was sure he felt Tony rub his shoulder with his thumb.
As Steve and Tony came upon the stand, Steve slid across the floor and Tony tried to do the same, but almost fell over. Steve managed to pull him to safety before the robot flung some lab tubes in their direction.
There had to be something going on and now Tony was sure of it. He just wished Steve would be honest with him.
“Oh my god, you feel so good, Tony.” Steve breathed, pushing into Tony even harder and faster than before.
Rhodey smiled at him before getting up. He straightened out his military uniform before heading for the door.
Steve reached out a hand to rub the back of Tony’s neck. “Tony, you’re absolutely amazing…” He whispered.
Steve watched Tony slowly turn around. He looked surprised, as if no one had ever offered to share a meal with him before.
Tony shook his head as he walked away from the console again, pointing behind himself at the projection.
Suddenly, the door to the school’s main building burst open and a herd of children came piling out. Steve looked around, spotting Peter jogging out with one of his friends, engaged in what appeared to be the most liveliest of conversations.
“So,” Bruce started, wringing his hands together,” I really hate to do this, Tony…but I mixed up the dates for this trip…”
The guard nodded before reaching out for the package, but the carrier refused to hand it over. “Uh, better let me take it up to him,” the carrier explained, “it’s
After a moment, their waitress come up to their table with their food orders. Rhodey and Tony then chatted for a while as they ate. After discussing some surface level business as it related to Synergy, Rhodey leaned forward during a pause, hanging his head low.
“Mr. Rogers, we have the pleasure to inform you…” As Sam began reading the letter out loud, Steve lost himself within his thoughts; his mind drifted back to that final interview with Tony.
Before Bruce could answer him, Tony dragged him through the balcony and inside the penthouse to one of the guest rooms. Bruce barely struggled as he was disoriented from being pulled from a conversation so quickly.
“Oh wow, first time in a long time.” Steve chuckled, alluding to past events in which others had also wondered about his relationship with Bucky.
Natasha grinned before crossing her arms. She looked across the room to where most people were congregated. Steve followed her gaze, noticing immediately that she was looking in Bruce’s direction.
“Of course, but you’re already being helpful by being an effective teammate.” Tony answered with a smile.
Tony scrunched up his face; he had no idea why his relationship with Pepper had anything to do with Steve attending the event with him. He was now becoming more uncomfortable; something about the question felt like it was leading toward a conversation he wasn't calm enough to have.
Absolute silence fell between the two before Steve joined Tony at the balcony. He kept his distance, but he was close enough to Tony to keep his voice low.
Tony laughed, but he grimaced before reaching over to hug her again. “Okay, so let’s get this meeting out of the way.” Tony pulled away from Pepper before walking down the hallway to prepare for the board meeting.
Tony grabbed Loki by the collar. “What the fuck is he trying to do?!” He exclaimed almost choking Loki. Natasha patted him on the arm a few times before gently pulling him off Loki.
Tony moved his head slightly away to address Steve. “You wanna go to bed now?” He asked, although he didn’t sound as confident as he typically did.
Tony laughed as he slung his work bag over his shoulder. “Of course, that’s all I can think about. You’re becoming quite the distraction, Rogers.” He motioned for Steve to follow him out of the conference room.
Tony inhaled then exhaled, finally realizing the gravity of his decision. Was it weird to ask your ex to watch your kid so you could ogle someone you’re not even sure is into you? Tony considered it, but he really wanted to spend more time with Steve.
But before Hammer could confirm, Tony had jumped up from the table, whipping out his phone from his pocket as he headed toward the exit.
“So how do you feel about Synergy? It’s great isn’t it?” Bruce barely looked back at Steve as he continued to whirl around, checking a tablet as he studied each console.
As he closed his eyes, he thought about Project Synergy, the team, and working with Tony Stark. Steve had heard stories about Tony, but the man he met today didn’t appear all that horrible. Besides a few snide comments and moments of awkward staring, Tony seemed like someone Steve could grow to respect. He had worked with difficult people before and this wouldn’t be any different.
“Tony! I thought we agreed that you weren’t going to do work in the bed.” Steve glared as he rested his hands on his hips.
Tony groaned as he turned to face a console. He didn’t need the unsolicited dating advice right now.
Peter sighed again as he jerked the car out of the parking spot, which was more than enough space for him to parallel park.
Tony couldn’t believe that he had managed to convince Steve to rejoin Synergy. His mind swirled with varying degrees of emotions the entire ride back to Stark Tower.
Steve smiled at him, but then turned around to face the stove. He heard Tony shuffle around the kitchen before settling at the island.
Obadiah walked to the middle of the office, declining to take a seat. “Despite this unfortunate accident—” Tony groaned as Obadiah ignored him, “and even though the board is pushing to dismantle Synergy—”
She smiled back at him as she walked ahead. “Thank you, Bruce.” She answered in a low voice. Bruce could barely respond he was so entranced.
Shuri nodded slowly as she looked at the screen. “I emailed Bruce about this…we can finish the first round of safeguards here at the resort, but it won’t be a hundred percent complete.”
Tony sighed as he looked around himself, tapping his phone a few times in the palm of his hand before he decided on his next move. He took a deep breath as he pulled up May’s contact profile before pressing the call button.
They shuffled around a bit, both trying to get a hold of the other from how ravenous the kiss between them had become. As Steve massaged Tony’s back, Tony remembered they were still in the employee express elevator. He reluctantly pushed away from Steve but was still holding on to him, prompting a whiny noise from Steve.
“No.” Steve suddenly interrupted, somewhat surprising himself. And the room grew quiet as Tony took his time acknowledging Steve, yet he refrained from reacting right away.
“Okay, I just need a final head count before sending the guest list to T’Challa for the bridal party thing…”
Steve whimpered as he pushed upward sharply into Tony. Tony pushed back, both rocking into the other as their paces quickened.
“We’ll get through this, Tony…” Steve continued, reaching out to pat Tony on the shoulder much like he had earlier that day and many times before. This time Tony didn’t hesitate, in fact he leaned in toward Steve.
Tony could feel Steve smiling as they kissed. Steve broke away from him, but his face was still close.
,” he first corrected with a wink, “they have an age restriction at Peter’s school for this competition, but this thing the boys managed to put together is better than what I’ve seen the older kids do.”
Steve’s expression hardened as Tony pushed himself to continue. “Peter was at one of those sleepaway camps I usually send him to during the summer…so I was totally alone which made the obvious depression I was suffering through so much worse…”
As he approached the stairs to the basement, Tony looked around cautiously before producing two neatly folded head flashlights from his pocket for himself and Steve. He waved behind him for Steve to follow as they slowly descended the stairs, single file.
Tony shook his head. “No, I messed up, Steve. I got scared and ran away. I left you…you would never do that to me…”
Tony laughed. “I’m not the one we should be worried about.” It started out lighthearted but ended on a sour note as Tony thought about what Obadiah was capable of in possibly sabotaging Project Synergy.
“But it’s totally okay if you splooge right away. Practicing is just one of the fun parts.” Tony smiled at Steve who made a face at the word “splooge”. Tony leaned inward to kiss him on the cheek before climbing on top of him to straddle his legs.
“Colonel Rhodes?” Obadiah had turned to look directly at Rhodey who was sitting next to Pepper and Bruce at the table, “you can’t possible think that the government will sign off on this.”
Tony then drew Steve nearer to kiss him, a kiss that moved quite slowly between them as Tony used his thumb to stroke Steve’s neck. Steve rested his hands on Tony’s waist and squeezed. Both men breathed deeply into the kiss before Tony broke away.
“Take a seat, Stark. Or would you like to finish the presentation?” Fury crossed his arms as Tony waved his arms about before sitting down in a chair next to Thor.
Both Steve and the principal frowned at Tony. “Actually…” the principal began after a second, “there’s something you can do, Mr. Stark and Mr. Rogers…”
“Oh, and Steve.” Sam started, his face returning to that goofy grin from before. “Tony’s great.” He only added to avoid embarrassing Steve any longer. Steve nodded timidly, grateful that his friend was nice about his developing crush.
“Tony,” Tiberius inched closer toward him as he lowered his voice, “I really do wish I could hear from you more often…”
The robot screeched again causing both Tony and Peter to screech back. Tony quickly ran over to another table to retrieve the failsafe device to the robot, nearly dropping it as he rushed to turn the robot off. Peter backed behind him again as they tried to get away from the robot before it caused any damage. Finally, after a few more seconds of Tony quickly working through the controls on the tablet, the robot finally powered down.
Tony turned to face Steve, grinning more so than usual in order to mask his weird feeling. “That’s a secret, but I’ve been inspired by that time we played spy husbands, Rogers.”
Steve nodded as he looked away from Tony, sighing. “I’m only about to agree with you because it hurts to do anything else.”
“Do you know where they made the first robot?” Peter read carefully before looking up at Tony again.
“Hey, you’re the one who agreed to continue your dad’s legacy project.” Rhodey huffed as he picked up another file, this time he looked more intrigued than he had been with the previous file. Tony took notice.
“Morning, Steve!” Peter hugged him back before breaking out into a run to jump onto the bed with Tony, jumping so hard that it nearly bounced Tony off the bed.
"Yeah, good idea. Be honest, you think Thor's messing with the weather?" It had been SO nice just a few minutes ago. Then again, it had been gorgeous out recently and started to pour rain in the middle of their frisbee game, and Thor had insisted he didn’t cause it…
“I’m sure you can relate, Peter. Fighting crime doesn’t leave a lot of time for romance,” Cap told him, patting his shoulder and opening the cabin door for him.
Letting go of his bow, Clint crossed his arms. It wasn’t his place to tell Peter he was dating an idiot or that cheating was the worst. He’d leave that to Cap and Tony.
“It did and I couldn’t put it down. Such a nice story. It would surely make Bragi himself proud,” Loki said nicely, beckoning Peter after him as he went to sit by the camp fire. “I’m surprised that you liked it so much. I doubt that such a romantic tale is popular among young men.”
“Yeah, um, hi, hello,” he said, smiling nervously at the various Avengers in front of them. “What’re you guys doing here?”
Just then, Clint and the Hulk arrived. For some reason the big green Avenger looked grumpier than usual—maybe he was still thinking about Amora.
Captain America was surprised that Doctor Doom barely knew anything about Loki. With both being villains, Cap had assumed that Doom had worked with Loki at some point.
Peter squinted at the beauty, letting the information sink in. This was Loki? Like Thor’s stepbrother Loki, God of Mischief, that Loki? And Thor knew it?
“So he’s comfortable enough to let you listen in on his phone calls with me…and has never said a word about you or dating you to us,” he assessed, frowning. “Well that stings a bit. I guess I can see why he’d want to hide Wade from us, but you don’t seem so bad besides being too old for him.”
“I’m tired and I hate board events.” Tony let out as he walked away from Steve, but was truly bothered by his interaction with Tiberius.
Steve pushed downward as his hands traveled up Tony’s torso then his chest, rubbing both of his nipples. Steve kissed Tony deeply before moving his head to lick one of Tony’s nipples. Tony couldn’t help himself as he moaned even louder, feeling Steve’s tongue swirl around slowly against his skin.
Tony sighed as he continued walking, sensing that Bruce wasn’t tolerating his defeatist attitude again.
“Yep. Same time tomorrow. Also, if you happen to arrive early, feel free to observe some of my other projects.” Tony grinned. He had noticed that Steve was watching him when he arrived that morning but didn’t want to make a big deal out of it, especially since he figured Steve hadn’t appreciated how reckless he was being. It was his lab and he could do what he wanted, but Tony also didn’t want to cause friction with his lab partner.
“That’s okay, Rogers. Maybe next time.” Tony mentally scolded himself for being so open with his last statement, but Steve continued to smile at him.
Pepper conveyed that she understood Tony’s apprehension as she looked directly at him. “Then trust him when he says there’s nothing going on with his best friend.”
“We know your CFO, Mr. Stane, is supposed to give the presentation for the converter…” the staffer motioned for the group to follow her inside, “but it would be so awesome if you could do it instead, Mr. Stark.”
Clint squeezed his eyes shut as he appeared to try to recount the night. “…it was super late, so most of the labs were empty, but…” He trailed off before continuing, “…I remember seeing someone in the lab next door…I didn’t recognize him though…”
Obadiah rocked back and forth on his heels as Thanos returned to his work. He waited patiently for the scientist to address him any further.
Tony inhaled deeply as he knocked on the door to Steve's apartment. He waited a minute before the door opened to reveal Steve.
Tony laughed, although for some reason, it hurt to laugh; his chest was feeling weird again. He shook his head as he turned to face Steve.
“Were you thinking about him just now when you were all over me?” Tony pointed to the bed, referring to Steve trying to initiate sex before calling it a night.
Obadiah eyed Tony as if to call him out on his bullshit. Tony wasn’t lying about the Synergy device, though; it still needed to be tested a few more times which meant that they weren’t sure of its full capabilities.
“It’s funny that we both work here, but I’ve yet to see you in person.” Loki joked with his hand out for Steve to shake.
The elevator reached another floor before it opened its doors again. The employee smiled cheerfully before exiting.
Steve tapped his phone in the palm of his hand before rising from the bed. As he got ready for dinner, Steve told himself that he’ll just give Tony some space to figure things out, knowing he shouldn’t pressure him.
Hearing the jovial tone in Steve’s voice eased Tony about the meeting. He slid a hand around Steve's neck to caress him.
Later that evening, the three of them cleaned up the kitchen together. Peter had begged Tony to play music while they cleaned which delayed cleaning by quite a bit as they danced and sang to one of Tony’s frequently played playlist. Peter had found Robyn’s “Get Myself Together” the most enjoyable, nearly breaking a dish as he tried to pass it to Steve who washed with Tony drying.
Steve smiled at the two of them, signaling that he knew Tony was just giving him a hard time, before setting off to find Peter, leaving Tony and Sharon alone. Tony looked around, trying to escape but Sharon kept smiling at him.
Peter nodded before patting Ned on the shoulder who was still cowering. He made sure his friend was more or less okay from the commotion before tapping on his tablet.
He continued with some more lines about cherishing Shuri and being there for her during the rough times. As Sam concluded, Tony accidentally looked over at Steve.
Tony smiled has he reached over to half hug Steve. “Rogers is definitely holding this whole thing together.”
Tony stared at Steve before looking away again, feeling his eyes well up with tears. “I couldn’t, Steve…”
Tony pursed his lips together before laughing. “Now? I guess it’s late…you’re not hungry or anything?”
Steve held onto Tony tightly as he let the latter rub his hands all over the top half of his body. Steve then put a hand on Tony’s chest.
Tony laughed quietly as he continued to push backward into Steve. “I suppose that’s fine…” He teased.
Tony bolted out of the elevator as soon as it opened its doors. Steve took his time exiting as he recognized that they had arrived at one of the mezzanine levels, semi outside the tower. He watched Tony hustle over toward a helicopter on a landing pad that extended far outward on a cantilever.
As he walked slowly to his apartment, Steve contemplated cancelling on Tony; he didn’t understand why they were drifting apart and why it was so difficult to discuss it.
Tony turned to stare at Bruce, now panicking because he had forgotten that he might be paired up with Steve again.
Steve continued to stare intently at Bucky, indicating that he was still very much concerned with his friend’s change in demeanor.
After work, Tony settled on riding the subway with Steve. He was thinking about having Happy drive them or ordering a car, but he didn’t want to look spoiled. He thought about driving, but he knew he would need a cocktail or two to loosen up his nerves. Therefore, the subway seemed to be his best bet; he wanted to convey to Steve that he wasn’t some rich brat who spent money on frivolous things. If they ever started dating, however, Tony would
“…but the first person I was ever with…our families were close. It was really fucked up though because he’s an asshole and we never said anything nice to each other…”
Steve let Tony’s cock slide out of his mouth before he laid on top of Tony, unzipping his pants, pulling down his briefs to grind his exposed hard cock against Tony’s. Steve pushed downward into Tony who pushed upward, his hands clenching at Steve’s backside before grabbing his ass.
As Fury concluded, Agent Hill reappeared, walking ahead before stepping to the side to reveal a person most of the group didn’t recognize, except for Steve and Tony.
He turned to face Loki, who was standing in the threshold of the entrance to his lab. His expression was marked by an unsettling grin which Steve found extremely unnerving.
Tony nodded slowly; he did want Steve around. Tony wanted to be with Steve; it had always been more than just sex with him, but Tony had trouble letting go of some of things he had said to Steve while they were together and after they broke up. Afterall, he was the reason why they didn’t speak for a year. Steve deserved better than constantly going back and forth over their relationship.
Through the kiss, Steve could feel Tony holding back, so he restrained himself from pushing back. But before anything could go anywhere, Tony straightened up and away from Steve to flop onto his back. He groaned loudly, slamming the palms of his hands to his forehead. Steve shuffled so he could look more directly at Tony.
As Steve’s body began grinding against his, Tony couldn’t stop his thoughts from racing. He could just say out loud that he loved Steve. He, Steve, and Peter could officially become the family they’ve been acting like up until that point. Everything would finally make sense and Tony would finally be with the right person.
Steve nodded again, closing his eyes as he felt Tony gradually push downward into his body. As Tony kept rocking forward, Steve closed his eyes as the feeling between them escalated. Steve felt like he could feel every bit of Tony; he tried to restrain himself, but his body was overreacting from Tony’s movements.
Tony shook her hand as he shook his head. “Just Tony. This is Steve Rogers, one of Synergy’s finest.” Tony motioned toward Steve who meekly shook the doctor’s hand.
Tony glanced around the room quickly before taking a seat next to Steve who looked just as grave as everyone else. Natasha was standing near Thor on the opposite side of the table and Fury was perched at the front with his arms crossed. Tony took a moment before settling, lingering as he looked directly at Steve before acknowledging everyone else once more, noticing that Clint was missing. Bruce took a seat at the opposite head of the table. He looked just as confused by the subdued atmosphere as Tony was.
Tony smiled wildly, feeling the warmest feeling inside. He typed back a reply before turning the screen off. He then turned over onto his back, trying to fall asleep, but all he could think about was Steve. He glanced at his phone before grabbing it again, tapping a few times until the message from Steve appeared. Tony stared at the message before hugging his phone to his chest before placing it back down on the table. He then turned back over on his side to face Steve’s usual side of the bed, still smiling.
Steve smiled as he turned to kiss him. Tony let Steve kiss him a few times before kissing him back. They both then turned onto their backs to stare up at the ceiling.
“Oh,” Steve appeared suddenly in the kitchen, “I’m sorry for interrupting…” He waved his hands around before turning to exit the space.
“Would you like for me to stop updating you on Mr. Parker’s expected arrival?” J.A.R.V.I.S. coolly asked.
“Anthony, I need to speak with you.” Obadiah walked into the room and took a seat in front of Tony’s desk. He undid the button to his suit jacket before settling down, looking around as he investigated Tony’s office.
Steve sighed as he realized that he couldn’t back out of the trip. He told himself that maybe he might be able to get some alone time with Tony on the yacht.
Peter sighed as he jumped off the bed to head toward his bathroom. Tony sat up more in the bed, closing his eyes, thinking about the trip. He smiled thinking about being with Steve and Peter, and how good it felt finally having the family he always deserved.
“When do you need us to leave, Fury?” Tony now had his hand on the back of Steve’s chair. Steve had to prevent himself from leaning backward; he tried to keep a straight face as he listened to Fury and Tony, but he was sure his facial expression betrayed his discomfort.
The board member looked back and forth between Rhodey and Tony before cracking a slight smile. He then began to laugh hysterically.
Tony sat up straight at the word “romantic”, almost knocking himself off the table. The rubber ball flew past his head.
The crashing sound from the waves woke Tony up instantly. He tried sitting up straight but then realized that he was tangled up with Steve on the latter’s bed in their hotel room. Terrified, Tony tried to pull himself free as his companion slept but began jerking around too much. He yanked on a blanket that had been wrapped around his leg and Steve’s body, but the force of the pull and his increasing panic propelled him off the side of the bed.
Steve nodded; he waited a moment before responding. “I can get him for you if you want, Tony. I can borrow Bucky’s car.”
“Does this feel all right?” Tony whispered, hugging Steve again, “just in case you roll over some more…”
Peter and Tony looked at each other slowly before looking over at Steve who appeared the most angry they have ever seen him.
Steve rolled his eyes as Sam and Bucky remained silent. “All right,” he sat back into his chair, “just say it.”
“I made out with Steve when we got back to my place after the party…” Tony let the words drag out as he continued pouting at the desk.
If Steve hadn’t already been embarrassed, he definitely felt like crawling in a hole for the rest of his life now. Sam slumped down next to his friend, handing him the coffee mug, laughing lightly as he leaned against the couch. Steve looked at his friend; he could tell Sam was just kidding, but he was still mortified.
The two men lingered before Tony kissed Steve one last time. Steve fumbled as he tried to unbuckle himself, eventually needing assistance from Tony to get out of the car without looking too awkward. Steve closed the door and waved before turning around to walk toward his apartment. Tony waved back as he watched Steve walk away.
Tony was in his work office, packing his work bag to get ready to see Steve at Mount Liberty. As he packed away a few folders containing some documents he needed to review, there was a hard knock at his door.
Tony laughed. He was at war with himself over whether to bring up the morning after the party but decided not to; he didn’t want to ruin the moment.
“Now, remember Steve’s accident,” Tony pulled into the private residence garage of the tower with Peter bouncing around in the passenger seat, “he’s not feeling well so he might not be able to do much for a while.”
Both Tony and the intern were laughing loudly at whatever Tony was joking about. Steve took a moment before approaching them; he could feel the palm of his hands sweating and his cheeks becoming flush. He watched Tony glance over in his general direction, smiling widely as he finished his sentence. Steve could feel his patience rapidly fall to an all-time low, however, all those times fantasizing about what he would say to Tony when they finally saw each other again were forgotten in the moment.
Obadiah nodded quickly again as he watched Gamora follow Nebula. Gamora closed the door to the penthouse, waiting a moment before joining her sister. She then pulled out her phone before looking through her sent messages, finding the list of sequences she had sent Tony a while back.
He hung his head before looking around back at the kitchen, hearing Tony and Peter laughing together. He looked back at Bucky’s bedroom door, debating with himself whether he should further explain his intentions with Tony to Bucky, but he knew his best friend would see right through that.
Steve yawned as soon as he opened his eyes. He was lying on his back with his arm outstretched on the side of the bed Tony had slept. He blinked a few times, realizing that Tony was gone already. He sat up straight, looking around; Tony’s bedroom looked different from last night. Steve wasn’t sure if it was due to the time of night or night’s somber atmosphere. He looked around the room once more before his eyes landed on the bedside table. There, a folded note with his name on it caught his eye. Steve took his time reaching over to read it. He glanced around the room again, as if searching for the person who had left the note before flipping it open:
“Wait, Tony.” Steve interrupted, “…I shouldn’t have read the diary…I really thought I could help somehow…but I should have listened to you…”
Steve nodded and thanked the guard before heading over to the security check point before the elevator bank. He obediently followed directions as the guards scanned him. Once in the elevator, Steve took another deep breath before pressing the button to the seventieth floor.
Tony shook his head. “The device, it reproduced something from that equation set, but I’m not entirely sure what I’m looking at…”
Steve stayed on the sidewalk as he watched Happy pull away, continuing to watch the car drive down the street. As he lingered, Steve began to feel the way he felt the first time he realized he was attracted to Tony. Something about it kept the smile on Steve’s face as he took his time walking back into the building, thinking about Synergy and Tony.
“What?” Tony frowned at Bruce, “did you call him?” He asked as the elevator stopped at their destination. Clint was infamous for his sometimes-careless behavior, but he never dropped the ball quite like this before.
…Tony sighed in his head as he rested his hands on his hips, hanging his head low. He felt an urge to run over to Steve to hug him, but he fought against it.
Tony sighed to himself as he ruminated over the possibility, forcing himself to finally get some work done.
Shuri smiled before rounded the table again to pack up her things. Bruce looked over at Tony, nodding vigorously in Shuri’s direction.
Tony nodded. “I think that’s a risk we’re going to have to take if Thanos is on the move. Banner, could you bring the team’s safety uniforms to the resort in case?”
“Well then. It sounds like everything is running smoothly. Keep me updated.” He jumped out of his chair before briskly walking to exit the office.
Rhodey chuckled, yet his tried tolerance for patience was palpable. “The device has access to a wide database of a near infinite number of items. The possibility is extremely rare. Right, Tone?”
Fury uncrossed his arms to rest his hands on his hips. Tony turned slightly to watch Steve lean forward to rest his elbows on the table.
The team had gathered in one of the medium-sized conference rooms in Stark Tower, worn from the day’s events. Fury was planted firmly in the front of the room, fuming at both Tony and Bruce. He had his hands on his hips, raising his voice with every syllable.
Loki appeared to sense Steve’s confusion. “My brother sent me a text as soon as he heard.” He clarified.
“Stark.” Natasha’s voiced appeared in Tony’s earpiece, “we’re close to getting people off the island. Some people are refusing to leave, but we’re just about done.”
“So, I just wanted to say that I feel dumb that I didn’t know who you were the first time we met…” The comment earned laughter from the guests.
Peter gave Tony a thumbs up before tapping on the tablet again. The main component of the robot flashed a light before blinking steadily. It lifted itself up slightly before slowly roving toward Steve.
Steve let Tony turn him over. He felt his body rock downward into the mattress as he felt Tony caress his backside.
Thanos motioned for Nebula to untie Obadiah. He tried to sit up, but she held him down with one hand, standing behind the chair.
“I’ve never slept with Bucky, okay?” Steve shook his head a few times, confused by the argument they were having, “I don’t know why you’re so upset about something that never and won’t happen.”
Tony turned his head to look at Steve who was expressing his sincerest concern. That was something about Steve that Tony had always appreciated: Steve was aware of his issues but chose to stick around anyway.
“Steve…” Tony tried to push away from Steve, but Steve wouldn’t let go of his face. Steve pulled him closer again, nipping at Tony’s bottom lip.
Steve nodded again as he pushed back into Tony’s hard cock. Tony smacked his ass and Steve heard the tube of lube snap open again.
The security guard sitting at the desk glanced upward to see a mail carrier holding out a giant package over the counter.
Tony nodded. “He’s fine. And it’s not Synergy-related either.” He quickly added. That seemed to convey to Steve that Tony didn’t want to address the issue any further.
“Clint. Switch places with Shuri on those tapes,” Bruce pointed at Clint before addressing Shuri, “Shuri, I need you back in the lab. Let’s look through what we have so far on Thanos’s weapon. In the meantime, let’s all stay on the low as the dust settles…”
Tony waved a hand around “Not too long. But if I had to give you a concrete answer, it depends on what’s being replicated.” He answered with ease.
Shuri watched Steve leave before turning toward Tony. “I’m sure everyone’s been giving you their own opinion about this, Tony, but I just wanted to let you know that I’m pulling for you and Steve. I really hope everything works out.”
Tony took another deep breath as he attempted to reorganize his thoughts. “Steve. I don’t think we should see each other anymore. I’m sorry.” He squeezed his eyes shut as soon as he finished his statement, afraid to look Steve in the eye.
Tony attempted to stop him from getting away by reaching an outstretched arm but then he quickly pulled it back.
Steve lingered before approaching. Quickly, he thought it would be better to just leave and send Tony a text later, but he didn’t want Tony to take any offense to him leaving without saying goodbye. Steve scrunched up his face before crouching down near the couch. He hesitated before tapping Tony on the shoulder.
Later that night, Tony went to bed earlier than usual to catch up on sleep. He sat on the edge of the bed, thinking about Steve and Peter. He fished out Steve’s letter from the beside table and read it again.
“I’m getting everyone outside away from the building before this thing blows. How much time do we have?” Steve answered coldly, never looking back at Tony.
Steve stopped and peered as best as he could through the glass to see two figures standing in the lab. One figure was quite animated with their gestures while the other stood somewhat still. Steve looked back and forth down the hallway before inching closer toward the glass.
Steve, holding Loki with one hand while the rest of his body was outside of the car, glared at Thor.
I meant?” Bucky laughed as he slapped Steve on the arm a few times. Sam laughed also, but Steve only glared.
“Wait, time out,” Tony physically crossed his hands to mime a time-out sign as he interrupted Steve, “you think it’s because I’m
It was the middle of another workday at Stark Industries. Both Tony and Steve were hanging out in their lab; Pink Floyd’s “Brain Damage” was playing in the background on low volume from a playlist Tony had created in college.
Loki shook his head as he bumped into the console behind him. “I’m not…he cut ties with me a long time ago…but it wasn’t just me with the lab explosion…”
Tony shook his head, not really sure where to start. “I don’t know what he wants…we, uh,” he paused, rolling his eyes, “we…uh…slept together the other night…”
Riri turned the chip around and around in the palm of her hand. “Uh, it’s like a key, isn’t it?” She looked up at Tony, inquisitively.
The guard nodded, motioning for another guard to come over to the desk. “Can you take this package up to Mr. Stane’s office right away, please?” He said to the second guard.
Obadiah, appearing a little taken aback, adjusted his jacket again, but he kept his hand on the microphone, grinning.
Tony shrugged once more; he wasn’t sure what to say right away. He was just feeling weird about Steve moving in with Bucky, but Steve was okay with him seeing his ex? It didn’t make any sense.
“How long do we got, doc?” Tony asked, peering down at his wristwatch as the group rushed down a corridor.
Tony nodded wordlessly, too stunned to really respond as he let Steve kiss him again. They kissed each other for a moment or so before Steve gently pushed Tony onto the bed. Tony held onto Steve as he scooted them both up the bed to meet the headboard.
Tony heard Bruce groan loudly. “I know you’re making a joke as a way to alleviate the serious conversation we just had so I’m going to let that one slide.”
Tony nodded as he leaned into Steve’s hand. He placed a hand on Steve’s cheek before pulling him close.
know you guys fucked last night. You guys left the party together and didn’t say goodbye to anyone.”
Tony sighed loud enough for Obadiah to get the point, looking directly at him before resuming packing.
“Oh, yeah. First day jitters are a bitch.” Tony added as he walked back over to the console that had been on fire.
Steve took his time turning around from his station to face Tony. He looked downward before glancing upward slightly.
Tony pulled a clicker out of the inner pocket of his blazer. He smirked in Fury’s direction who only crossed his arms as he rolled his eyes.
Tony walked over to Steve after finishing his conversation. He placed a hand on his arm, squeezing it gently.
Loki turned slightly to face the group, but he didn’t respond right away. Everyone looked back and forth amongst themselves then back at Loki, waiting for anything.
Steve’s eyes widened with fear, terror, horror, dread, practically any synonym one could possibly think of as soon as he recognized J.A.R.V.I.S.’s voice.
Obadiah barely budged. "Please, Anthony, calm yourself. Everyone else may think you and your little boyfriend are cute, but I know you and what you're capable of. Or
, Steve. Maybe you got into the program because they wanted to observe how an eighty-year-old possessed the body of a thirty-year-old.” Sam groaned through a toothy smile. Often, Steve’s friends pointed out that he was horribly old-fashioned, which was both irritating at times as it was adorable. Steve still carried around a flip phone and refused to upgrade to the newest smart phone.
Tony let out a painful groan as he let his body slide forward so that his top half was lying in the seat of his chair. Bruce walked over to pat him awkwardly on the shoulder. Tony sank lower into the chair, staring up at the trusses in the ceiling.
Thor noticed Steve’s apprehension and chuckled. “When we were children, everyone referred to us as Thor and Loki. My brother is quite the trickster!” Thor slapped his brother’s shoulder once more before Loki finally reached out his hand to greet Steve.
“Mr. Rogers? Here are your discharge papers.” The nurse walked up to the bed as Steve and Tony pulled apart from one another. The nurse waited patiently for Steve to sign the papers, but he was struggling to do so because his muscles were fatigued.
Steve nodded quickly again before rushing out of the space and the building. He stopped short before mounting his bike, trying to calm down before he rode back to his office. For the first time in a long time, Steve could feel his emotions gaining the best of him and he struggled to think clearly. Eventually after some time, Steve managed to calm himself down enough to drive back to his office before going home later that afternoon.
Strange pointed to a few items. “As you can see, we’re running low on supplies.” He then called for an intern and a nurse before studying some information on a tablet.
Tony hummed to himself as he filed through his emails, deleting spam and flagging what seemed to be the most important to read later. He read along the list until he found what looked to be early morning spam; the message contained an interesting, yet incomprehensible subject line.
Tony tapped on his phone a few times, reworking the message until he finally settled on one that wasn’t impersonal but conveyed professionalism. Well, he thought so anyway.
Steve crouched down in front of Tony, trying to hold him still as Tony shuffled about, trying to get his wits about him, but he was in severe pain.
As Steve looked Tony in the eye while shaking hands, he was surprisingly met with a similar intense gaze. They shook hands and traded pleasantries before Steve left the office. He was told during the interview that he would only really work with Tony toward the end of the project when it came time to present the final product to the board. Steve figured that was probably for the best; he couldn’t stand the thought of working daily with someone who seemingly cared less about his team members.
“It would be best to commit those to memory, and only use the chip in dire situations, but let’s not hope it comes to that.”
“You know…,” Tony gently took Steve’s hand, “this looks really good on you, especially when we’re fucking.” He smirked, turning Steve’s hand on his chest to show that he was talking about the ring.
“Sir, I’m going to need you to step to the side.” The officer shooed Tony away as she returned to her communicator.
T’Challa clapped his hands together. “There will be a dinner for everyone to meet later this evening, but feel free to explore the resort before then.”
They moved in time with each other, both breathing deeply as they kissed each other, feeling each other as if they hadn’t missed a beat since they were last together. Tony could feel himself nearing the edge as he felt Steve’s body tense the way it usually did when he was close.
Steve nodded as he sat down in his chair before explaining to Tony what happened at Roosevelt Island.
Steve stopped moving, letting one arm hang off the side of the bed. “I’m…just trying to get comfortable…”
He took a moment to see where Steve had gone off to, seeing Steve standing next to Bucky on the other end of the near empty space. Steve was in the middle of a huddle flanked by Bucky and Sam’s in-laws. Tony waved at him and Steve waved back before turning to listen to Bucky. Tony then shifted in his chair to watch the firework show from afar.
Needless to say, neither Steve nor Tony were on their A-game. They landed on a helicopter pad at a nearby building before hustling to the precinct. As they approached the building, the rest of the team was busying themselves with moving bystanders out of the way.
As soon as he drew nearer, one of the figures marched out of the space, brushing past him, revealing one of Stark Industries’ higher-level scientists, Dr. Erik Selvig, as he headed in the opposite direction of Steve’s lab.
“J.A.R.V.I.S., how great would it be if we tested out some of the mechanics to this suit on Peter’s robot?”
“I’m sorry that you won’t get a good night’s sleep, Rogers.” Tony joked, trying to turn his head so he could look at Steve.
Tony frowned as he glanced back at Steve again. He really didn’t need this bullshit on top of everything else.
Both Steve and Tony jerked awake from the sound of Peter’s voice coupled with insistent knocking at their bedroom door.
On top on bearing witness to Steve freaking out that Sam had caught them in bed, he had been beating himself up all weekend over falling asleep at Steve’s. Rhodey had been more than okay with staying late with Peter, but Tony was fearful of turning into his father. There had been countless times in his childhood where he had been left alone with a nanny when he should have been spending his formative years with his father.
Steve stared at Sam before slowly turning to face Bucky. Part of him wanted to call Bucky out for talking to Sharon behind his back, but he was also mindful of the fact that Bucky had probably done so to look out for everyone’s best interests. Also, Steve knew his closest friend would come to him eventually, and that Bucky was right to sense that Steve’s intentions with Tony were probably beyond a friendship.
Steve smiled; he looked downward before looking directly at Tony. “Okay, but I’ll hang out in the kitchen for moral support.”
“You know, Tony. You should really relax. I’m better with kids than you think.” Tony appreciated Rhodey’s levity, but he could also feel his chest constricting with panic.
Rhodey nodded. “Well the lab explosion didn’t help when it came to final decision time, but as long as it stays in house and you and your team make Synergy safer from it, it’s a done deal.”
“…I really was a mess after she left…” Tony sighed again, “…which is why I’m trying my best to do things differently now…so I guess this is a long way of me saying that you don’t really have anything to worry about when it comes to past relationships, Steve. No one’s
Loki panicked, gaping at Thor who only shook his head. Natasha nodded at Tony sternly before taking a firm hold of Loki’s arm.
“Oh my god, I love you so much, Steve.” Tony breathed as he squeezed Steve’s body, lifting his head to kiss him.
Steve looked down and away from Tony, taking in a deep breath before looking up. “…are you doing this because…I told you that I love you?” He asked quietly.
“Rogers?” He called. Steve stood firmly in place, too ashamed to face Tony. He heard Tony shuffle around a bit.
“Uh, but I thought I was working with Dr. Banner?” The statement morphed into a question as Steve looked at Bruce with a confused look on his face. Bruce just shrugged.
“Not to sound overly intrusive, but he did spend the night here last night, right? Why would he do that if he weren’t interested in you?”
Steve retained a soft expression toward Peter before returning to his food. As they continued to eat, Steve felt a hand slide across his leg. He glanced over at Tony, trying not to turn pink from the intimate contact in front of Peter. However, Tony didn’t make a big deal about it; in fact, the longer he kept his hand on Steve’s leg, the more Steve was beginning to feel more comfortable being so close to Tony.
Usually whenever Rhodey was in town, he would take turns with Peter’s aunt in watching Peter when the nine-year old wasn’t busy with school or any extracurricular activities. Although Tony really appreciated the commitment his friends put in to helping him raise Peter, he noticed that sometimes he would venture into helicopter-parent territory if he hadn’t received an update in a while. The feeling had grown significantly worse after the reappearance of his nightmare. It wasn’t as if he didn’t trust his friends, quite the contrary; he just didn’t know what he would do if he ever lost Peter. His own life was chaotic, but at least he could start over with Peter.
“Steve, listen…” Tony interjected as he uncrossed his legs to lean forward in his chair, “Synergy needs you for this to work. The team needs you…I need you…” Tony was staring intently at Steve much like he had the first day the team had gathered for orientation at Stark Industries.
Sam continued to look up at Steve, slowing his chewing to a painful crawl. He delicately placed his sandwich on its wrap before crossing his hands on his lap. Steve waited for him to respond, but his friend remained silent.
“No,” Thanos started, grinning widely which accentuated the scar on his chin, “I have a better job for you.”
Usually more perceptive, Sam missed the entire exchange between Tony and Bucky as he whipped out the graduation program to study.
“Well that makes you a better person than the rest of us, Cap.” Steve could always count on Sam to lighten the mood, especially when Bucky spiraled into one of his overly protective stints.
“Hey!” Tony caught the pillow with a laugh before grabbing Steve at the waist. Steve let Tony drag his body to his side of the bed, but then turned around to pin Tony down. They wrestled around with each other before their playful back and forth turning into heavy making out, with Steve on top of Tony, grinding against his body.
Tony held up his hands to get Steve to calm down. He was still unsure of the explosive’s sensitivity.
Steve lingered before finally taking the hint that sticking around could possibly lead to more yelling. He nodded slowly, turning around to exit the office, slowly closing the door behind him, and as soon as the door closed, Tony groaned loudly, shoving a folder full of documents off his desk.
Steve took a moment before following, making it obvious that he did not appreciate how bizarre their brief meeting with the buyers turned out to be. Tony waited for him at the threshold of the door, looping his arm around Steve’s almost immediately.
Neither one really addressed the other until it was time to leave. But both kept overthinking dinner.
Steve turned to face Tony, and Tony could tell that Steve was trying to remain as calm as possible in front of their kid and his best friend, but his true feelings broke through the façade.
spoil Steve, but he wanted to make sure Steve got to know him before being showered mercilessly with gifts.
“Loki, why would you do this?” Thor’s expression softened as he tried to understand his brother’s actions.
“What? Are you paying for dinner, Parker?” Tony interjected, but it was clear he was teasing. Steve nudged him in the arm to get him to relax.
“This chip has the failsafe codes embedded in it. I want you to be in charge of it.” Tony explained quietly.
Tony nodded thoughtfully as he poured more spices into their concoction. “I can also see why you would say that, but I would have said soupy if I meant soupy.” Tony ruffled up Peter’s hair which prompted him to let out a groan.
Tony came up from behind, wrapping his hands around Steve’s waist, pulling him in close to his body. They stayed liked this for some time before Steve turned around to face Tony, placing his hands on his face, leaning downward slightly to kiss him. Tony closed his eyes as he kissed Steve back.
The memory made Steve laugh again, louder than he had expected. “Uh, yes, of course. Besides that incident, that was such a good day…” He then grew quiet as he found himself wanting to also add that he missed those days.
Tony nodded as he looked back at Steve. Even though the statement appeared innocent enough, Tony couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed by it considering that every single stress in his life was coming to a head nowadays, including worrying that he might have pissed off Steve beyond repair.
Steve sighed to himself again, thinking that his assistant was referring to Bucky who usually took some of the interns out to lunch whenever he visited the office. They were on a deadline for a major case and Steve needed everyone to work through lunch to prep.
“Steve, I really don’t want to talk about you and Sharon, okay?” Tony groaned loudly before Steve could punctuate the end of his sentence. He spun around to look over the railing again.
“Stane,” Fury motioned with one hand toward Obadiah, “there’s no need for any of that, okay? We’re all on the same team.” He curtly added, now pointing defiantly at Obadiah who only crossed his arms.
Tony waited. “Okay, give me a second and I’ll figure it out.” He tapped on his tablet a few times, sighing loudly to himself before letting out an “ah ha!”.
“See you in a bit, Sam.” Steve mumbled as he let Tony out before basically slamming the door behind them. He could hear Sam roaring with laughter.
“…because I do…” Steve took a step toward Tony who instinctively took a step backward away from him, “…I love you and I love Peter…I really think we could be a family—”
“I think you’re right that we should go about this as if we’re unaware…” Steve said quietly, inching closer to Tony while keeping his hand on his shoulder, “…at least we won’t be far away from the city for the wedding…”
Bucky rolled his eyes dramatically as he rested his hands on his hips. He looked downward before looking up as his friend.
“Rogers, is it fair for me to assume that you’re lame as well?” He sneered at Steve before turning to pour two shots.
Bucky huffed loudly, but Steve ignored him as he took his time looking around the lounge before spotting Tony talking with Rhodey. He motioned for Bucky to follow him who went along reluctantly. As soon as Steve reached Tony, he noticed immediately that something was off; Tony appeared despondent.
Tony looked away again before facing Pepper. Her expression was soft, and he could feel that she was doing her best to sympathize with his worries. He breathed deeply before peeking at his phone to see if he had received any messages from Steve. And of course, there was nothing.
He felt Steve nestle his neck with the tip of his nose. Steve then pushed upward into his body and Tony wanted desperately to push back, feeling himself give in. Would it be so bad if they ended up sleeping together that night? When they had started making out, it seemed like more than a good idea, but then unfortunately, the cons of such a decision began to weigh heavily as Steve’s petting neared the point of no return.
The following morning, both Tony and Steve were on their way to the west coast in Tony’s private jet. The jet, which Tony explained to an especially skeptical Steve as soon as they took off, was piloted by a computer, allowing Tony to focus on his amateur spying skills. Both men were in the main cabin, strategizing about the event. The main cabin was divided into two symmetrical areas divided along the long axis of the plane: each side had two seats surrounding a table. The back of the cabin contained a mini bar packed with some pre-prepared meals. Steve had flown first class once before but flying in a private jet alone with Tony was on another level he still had trouble fully comprehending.
He felt Steve nod his head once more before pulling him close again. Tony let Steve hug him as they laid in silence.
Tony turned slightly to nod back at Steve. “Well that sounds great.” He then turned to face the stove again, “let’s eat then check out what else is going on at this place. I need to send more pictures to Peter before relaxing.”
Tony had held up a hand, shaking his head. “It’s okay.” He turned around quickly to walk toward a heap of a ruined console to avoid having Steve see that he was becoming upset.
“Stark Industries,” Tony started, but was immediately interrupted by more cheering and clapping. Images of various types of catastrophes slid around the walls of the auditorium.
Later that evening, they picked up Peter and Steve stayed for dinner before going home. Since calling it a night once he got home, Steve couldn’t sleep. At one point, after one more toss and turn, Steve turned over onto his side to look at his overnight bag he hadn’t unfinished unpacking, staring at a corner of the diary poking out from underneath his clothes.
He slid his phone into pants’ pocket before plopping down into his desk chair. He finally decided that he would ask Peter if they could have dinner with Steve.
After a few minutes, the elevator chimed with arrival, causing Tony to yelp again. He then commanded himself to chill out, running a hand through his hair a few times before standing right in front of the elevator. The doors opened, revealing Steve who was smiling, but Tony could tell that he was also nervous.
Bruce marched to Loki’s chair, wedging himself into Loki’s personal space. “Oh, you won’t like me when I get angry.” He slowly responded, never breaking eye contact with Loki.
“…I don’t really talk about my dad with anyone except the one or two times with a therapist I saw once…”
Steve turned his head a bit. “Tony, I know that. I want to help out and I would like to get to know Peter better…but if you don’t want me to—”
Tony clapped his hands together. “Okay thanks.” He started gathering his things along with placing the Synergy device into its carrying bag. Before exiting the lab, Tony stopped short to address J.A.R.V.I.S. once more.
Given the tense situation, Steve couldn’t help but laugh; something about Tony’s personality shone through the uneasiness in their relationship.
“But alas, I think I’ve been talking for too long…” Tony joked as he motioned at the crowd, wrenching his eyes away from Steve, “please enjoy yourselves the rest of the night.”
Obadiah held his hand out for Steve to take which Steve accepted. “Thanks, Mr. Stane. I think you and the board will be impressed after seeing what the device can do.”
Peter was in the back with May, bouncing along to the music, too excited for his aunt to get him to settle down, so she just let him enjoy himself before leaving the party. Fury was standing off to the side with his wife, just bobbing his head to the music, sipping out of his margarita with a long straw. And Thor was singing along as well, clapping joyously as he got caught up in everyone enjoying Tony’s performance.
Tony nodded as he sat up more in the bed. “Yeah,” he smiled a little, “he also said he wouldn’t mind having you over for breakfast, so it might be easier for you to just stay…”
After a minute or so, Tony finally found them. He was carrying two cocktails and wearing the hugest grin. Steve had never seen him so animated, which instantly made something inside of Steve tingle with anticipation.
Steve let out a groan as Tony’s comment made him panic even more. He turned to walk toward to the bedroom door.
“…and I know there’s no competition between the two of you, but Tony didn’t even talk about his family with Pepper. Not the way he has with you…he told me.” Bruce finished, trying to smile at Steve who was sure he looked miserable.
Tony wedged himself into Steve’s personal space. “Egg shells? You’re the one playing games, Rogers.”
Both Clint and Thor looked crestfallen over not being able to interrogate Dr. Selvig and Loki further.
“Tony. I’m not a parent, but I understand that you have responsibilities…I’m sorry for asking you to come over…that overstepped boundaries…”
Steve shrugged. “I stumbled across it, but Tony was the one to point it out. It was more a team effort than anything else.”
Steve handed Tony his phone back before heading toward the kitchen. He moved a few things around before he found the charger. He turned around and smiled.
Steve nodded as he watched Tony climb into the bed, taking a moment before sliding back to his side. Tony turned onto his side away from Steve, trying to settle. He felt Steve wrap a hand around his waist to draw him close against his body. Tony counted to himself to calm down, fearing that Steve would say something. Instead, Steve remained silent as he held Tony against his body.
Tony clapped his hands. “Radio!” He then turned around to face Bruce to continue their conversation. Bruce looked even more sad and confused than Tony had left him.
And suddenly, through his continuing misery and self-doubt, Tony remembered that he had stashed his father’s diary in his desk in his home office.
Tony entered the code as delicately as possible before sprinting out of the basement then the building to help the rest of the team clear the area for the blast radius.
“How was the rest of your weekend after the party?” Steve asked before drinking out of his water glass.
“…but it’s probably nothing.” Tony waved his statement off. He looked down at his half-empty drink, moping over his feelings for Steve. He sighed before switching the conversation to recent lab experiments.
Despite Synergy’s lingering safety concerns, having been an active participant in the program led to a few great opportunities for Steve. He accepted a position with New York City’s public defender’s office that had an outpost in Brooklyn. That position was soon followed by a teaching opportunity at Columbia University after one of Steve’s former law school professors reached out to him once the project ended.
“…I thought it would be cool to get it framed. You both look kind of awkward, but I thought it was cute.” Peter continued, unaware of the magnitude his gift had on both Tony and Steve.
Steve shuffled around a bit. “Didn’t realize I was that easy to read.” He was smiling, suggesting he hadn’t taken any offence to Tony’s assertion.
“This is Rhodey, short for Colonel James Rhodes.” Tony clapped Rhodey on the back as he pointed toward Rhodey before pointing toward Steve.
Tony laughed again as he shuffled around. “Rogers, you really need to stop doing that…” He teased before turning his head somewhat to face Steve.
Although everyone was concerned about Clint’s wellbeing, they all nodded or murmured in some form of agreement with Fury’s statement.
“Don’t do that, Tony. Please don’t talk about yourself like that…especially when we’re like this…you told me you wouldn’t…”
Tony laughed as he leaned forward to kiss Steve. “It’s fine. I haven’t done this in a while so we should take it easy for a bit as we get use to each other.”
Tony waited anxiously for Steve to arrive. He thought about ordering something for dinner, but then decided to wait on Steve. As soon as J.A.R.V.I.S. informed him that Steve was in the lobby, Tony sprinted from his home office to the foyer to greet Steve at the elevator, only to realize that he was more nervous about seeing him than he had ever been since they met. It felt as if the elevator ride up was taking longer than normal, but then Tony told himself to appreciate the extra time before facing Steve in person again.
“Tony…” Steve whispered, feeling the tension between them finally let go. He placed a hand on Tony’s face and the other on his hip, massaging gently as he pushed Tony up against the back of the sofa.
Steve chuckled as he placed two coffee mugs on the table in front of them. “That’s okay if you do, Tony. You’ll also have some time to relax a bit at the resort when we arrive.”
“Okay, this is too cool.” Rhodey cooed. Everyone around him, except for Obadiah, nodded and murmured in agreement.
Steve held onto one of Tony’s legs as he held it against his body, using his other hand to feel the rest of Tony’s body.
"Am I late? I thought this meeting didn't start until 12:30?" Pepper asked as she sat down at the table next to Tony, not only confused by the time of the meeting but also by Tony and Obadiah glaring at each other.
Steve considered it as he waved back at Bruce. What was the worst that could happen? He might end up feeling miserable in the morning, but maybe it would do him some good to let loose once in a while. Although he was sure Tony was only joking, he knew his lab mate would ensure that he would indeed get home in one piece.
“So,” Pepper began as soon as Tony finished his last thought, “are you ready for later tonight? Finally figured out what you’re planning to say?”
Steve took in another short inhale of breath as Tony used his hand to stroke down and up the shaft, taking his time as he used his other hand to massage Steve’s waist. Steve shifted again, his body relaxing as he let Tony feel him. He moaned as Tony squeezed him a little; he then tilted upward to kiss Steve before bending downward again. Tony moved his hand further down Steve’s cock, engulfing Steve with his mouth. The move drew a sharp moan from Steve who instinctively bucked his hips upward into Tony’s mouth.
Tony waited before tapping on May’s number in Steve’s phone. “I think it’ll be okay to see him here…it’s been a while, hasn’t it?”
But before Steve could finish his question, Sam broke out in a fit of laughter, slapping a hand on the table.
“Is that it? Jesus, I thought you were going to tell me someone died.” Tony picked up the device again before spinning around to face one of the consoles. He chuckled a bit more before sighing to himself from laughing so hard.
Rhodes, I have no clue what’s going on with Steve. We slept together last night, like in the same bed. Help?
Sam nodded as he descended the airstairs to greet T’Challa. He held out a hand, but T’Challa pulled him into a hug instead.
Thor straightened up in his chair as he decided on his next move. Ever since the lab explosion, Thor had an inkling that maybe Loki had something to do with it. Although he hadn’t heard from Loki in a while, ever since the team had received the list of mysterious numbers and figured out a possible connection to Thanos’s weapon, Thor knew he needed to try a different tactic with Loki to get him to talk. He knew he had been too harsh with him in the past.
“No.” Tony also looked down at the letter before tossing it into a drawer in a table next to the bed.
Obadiah turned toward an officer. “Scour the lab and the surrounding areas. I don’t want this getting back to the board.”
Tony groaned as he turned over. He stayed facing downward in a pillow but turned his head slightly to address Peter.
Peter looked past Tony to see Steve standing nearby. Steve waved shyly, unsure if Peter would even care.
After the meeting, Tony drove himself to his newly formed Stark Enterprises in Queens to meet Bruce who was secretly working on the new Synergy device.
Tony chuckled with relief as he saw that Steve had accidentally sent him the same message twice. He typed back a cute response—well he thought so anyway—before turning his phone off again. He resumed looking up at the ceiling with a silly smile on his face as he drifted off to sleep thinking about Steve.
All Tony could do physically at this point was stare at Pepper, completely speechless. The words hit him hard, making him feel suddenly sick to the stomach. He would have excused himself if he weren’t afraid of ruining things further with Pepper. They both stared at each other for a moment or two longer as Tony tried to mentally connect the dots.
“Doesn’t look good?” Obadiah interrupted, “Dr. Banner, please, I’ve never pegged you to be the one peddling false hopes.”
Suddenly, Tony leaned sideways across Steve to grab a tablet from another nearby console, but in doing so, he brushed slightly against Steve’s hand. Steve didn’t physically react, of course, but the act felt more intimate than an accident. Or maybe he was reading into it too much.
“Hey, Tone.” Rhodey patted Tony on the back as he handed him a new drink. Tony grimaced as he tried smiling again to acknowledge his friend, but it was beginning to hurt trying to convince himself that he could make things work with Steve.
Steve looked to be considering it, but before their shameless flirty could go any further, Tony heard Bucky call for Steve.
Tony had been more than annoyed that he had to let Dr. Selvig go; the scientist had been one of his best, but Tony couldn’t allow him to work at Stark Industries after possibly putting innocents in danger when he tampered with the device. Tony had hoped that questioning Dr. Selvig had led to incriminating Obadiah somehow, but any evidence of Obadiah’s involvement was barely circumstantial. Besides what Pepper had managed to find out about the buyers and Loki’s termination, Tony still didn’t have enough proof to fire his former mentor.
Loki sat back in his chair, tapping on the table as he pondered the idea. Some minutes passed as Thor waited calmly for Loki and Loki fought with himself internally.
Steve nodded as he laughed. Tony was also laughing as he pretended to struggle with Peter bouncing around.
Silence hung in the air as Steve tried to figure out how to respond. He looked around, anywhere really except at Tony who was now fidgeting. He wasn’t sure why he suddenly felt nervous; while with Bruce he felt at ease, but now with Tony, he could feel obvious tension between the two.
“Okay, so Strange emailed me a few instructions for your new recovery plan…” Tony glanced over at Steve who was lying flat on his back, already expressing his annoyance with the situation. Tony ignored him as he reached for his eyeglasses sitting on top of the table next to the bed.
The group chatted for a bit longer with mostly Obadiah musing about the external possibilities of Synergy. After discussing the agenda for an upcoming meeting, everyone took their time exiting the room until Tony and Obadiah were left alone.
Although being with Steve had managed to stave off any recurring nightmare about the night his parents died, Tony was still worried that he would end up having a nightmare soon while sleeping with Steve. Tony dreaded the thought; although Steve seemed willing to take him as he was and he did tell him some personal things about his dad, although not all of it, Tony was concerned that Steve would actually leave him if he knew everything.
The space fell silent as the three contemplated the possibility. After a moment Tony clapped his hands together.
Tony chatted a bit longer before saying goodbye. He turned around to walk back toward Steve. “Okay, we’re good to go! Thanks a million, Cap.” He winked at Steve.
“Showtime.” Tony jogged over to the table where Steve was working with the Synergy device and picked it up before exiting the lab. Steve followed closely behind him.
Steve sat down in the chair next to Tony before kissing him on the cheek. Tony tried to kiss him back, but he was too weirded out about Mr. Beck’s demeanor.
“Uh, not too sure what your schedule is like, but…” Tony had heard Bruce begin, addressing Natasha; Tony was becoming mentally exhausted with how formal his friend was acting.
“What about that time I needed you to go with me to the west coast for that tech conference and you stayed out late with Happy and Rhodey the night before we were supposed to leave? You ended up missing the flight by an hour and I had to spend the weekend by myself because you decided to work in the lab rather than catch another flight.”
Bruce took a second, sighing with a nod, finally letting go of Steve’s arm. Steve inched closer toward the opening of the helicopter, motioning for Natasha to lower back toward the island. She finally nodded back, lowering the helicopter, and as soon as the helicopter was about a foot or so above the landing pad, Steve jumped out, landing solidly on both feet before running into the main building. Everyone watched him enter as Natasha pulled up on the controls.
From the sound in Bucky’s voice, Tony could tell that he was being straightforward, although he was still irritated by their earlier exchange. Tony glanced at Steve before answering Bucky; he knew Steve would want him to be civil.
Steve nodded, approaching Tony slowly. “I know how important this is to you, Tony, so I’ll do whatever you need me to do…I care about you.” He offered quietly, finally meeting Tony.
Tony wouldn’t give Tiberius the satisfaction of visibly acknowledging Steve. “He already knows about you so you can cool it with the dramatics.”
Steve glared at Tony but then his face relaxed somewhat as Tony reached over to rub his chest. “How else are you supposed to ask then?” Steve added, waving both hands around.
Tony’s body went rigid as he pushed himself up and away from Steve, practically jumping off the bed.
Under each printed name was a very distinct signature. Steve stared the longest at Tony’s, wondering to himself what the tech giant was
All those years standing and smiling in front of cameras finally paid off because Tony managed not to look completely horrified as Mr. Beck described what sounded like the night he had made out with Steve on the way to his penthouse after Thor’s party.
Tony looked down at Obadiah’s hand on his arm. He yanked it away as he straightened himself out before pointing in Obadiah’s face with one finger.
figured out how to get the device up and running? And, no one got hurt.” Tony pointed to himself as he glared at Steve.
Tony took another deep breath. “It’s funny…” he looked at Steve before looking down at the box in his hand, “…when I saw you try this on when we went out to my folks’ house in the Hamptons, I knew immediately I needed to get it resized…I wanted to get it fixed after we got back…” he looked up at Steve again who was listening, but his expression had changed; Tony knew he knew that he was referring to the fight they had over his dad’s diary, “and I know I already apologized about this, but I’m so sorry about the diary, Steve…I know you were trying to help…”
Synergy, Barton.” Tony jumped up to the front of the room before Fury could answer him. “You know, the wave of the future, blah, blah, blah.” Clint looked even more confused than before.
Bucky nodded as he directed Steve to sit with him on one of the sofa sections in the lobby. Steve told Bucky what had happened between him and Tony. After listening for some time, Bucky sighed.
“I can’t believe you’re worse than me and my failure to properly court Captain Rogers!” Both Bruce and Tony made a face at one another before making sure Steve was out of ear shot. They peered over the couch to see that he was still talking to Rhodey before settling.
The other end of the receiver went completely silent, so silent that Tony feared that Steve had hung up on him.
“…what the hell is this?” Tony squinted his eyes as he tried to make sense of the subject line that was merely a string of words scrambled together.
After some moments of silent hyperventilating, Tony took his time rising to his feet. He slowly walked back to the bathroom door, slowly opening it to see Steve sitting on the edge of the bed, leaning forward on his thighs with his hands clasped together.
“Awesome!” Peter high fived Tony before running over to the robot to tinker some more with its wiring.
Steve sighed as he hung his head, still mounted on his bike. He had to finally admit that he had been sitting on his emotions for too long, pushing them down, lying to himself that he was trying to repair a friendship with Tony for Peter’s sake. When in reality, he missed Tony, too.
escort Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.’s headquarters. Fury will know what to do with him in the interim.” He ended with his tone sounding especially irritated.
“My bed’s been screaming for your ass, so I have motivation to get back in one piece.” Tony offered casually.
When the kittens stopped whining, he knew that they’d just about had it. He understood wanting to get them as far away from the cliff as possible, just as he had wanted to get the men of the 107
Steve barked out something that was obviously not complimentary, paced a series of quick circles in the grass, and then sat down. He sulked, his ears turning outwards and going down, tail thumping hard against the ground.
Tony growled low in his throat and darted forward to swipe at Steve’s face. The armor plates around his tail expanded outwards, and puffs of fluffy gray fur showed between the plates. Steve backed away from the snarling cat, lifting his muzzle up to keep it out of reach.
Steve laid down as soon as the last of the kittens had been dug out from their secure hammock of the underside of his shirt. The rest of the kittens were gathered off his back, but Steve stayed on his belly for a while. He set his head between his paws and just watched the commotion as kittens were loaded into the kangaroo’s pouch, carried by the scruff, or urged onto the backs of dogs of all shapes and sizes. Above them, birds cawed what sounded like encouragement.
The radio broadcast caught his attention again, and he realized that it wasn’t just déjà vu. The broadcast was familiar because he’d been at that game. Ignoring the girl and her stammering platitudes, he examined the room again – everything was fake, every bit of it staged. Over the thunder of his pulse and the aching absence of his soulbonds, he could hear other noises beyond the walls. They had the echoing quality of being in a very large space with very high ceilings. The walls were obviously thin – he could see where they’d been joined together like the plywood panels of a stage set.
“You don’t say,” Steve muttered, trying and failing to pull his eyes away from the hypnotic darkness.
Tony left the suit half undone, trapping Steve’s arms against his sides. He bit into the swell of Steve’s left pectoral, and sucked hard at the skin until he tasted the tinge of blood. Steve held his breath through it, though Tony could feel him shaking under the strain, and wondered what it felt like to be that sensitive. As soon as Tony let him go, he gasped in a breath and struggled against the hold of his uniform. Tony reached down to grab him again, and grinned at how hard he was. Steve’s chest blushed a brilliant red.
Steve didn’t react to the outburst and Tony panted through a dozen breaths that whistled through his throat like swallowing chips of ice. He turned a frustrated circle and came to rest with his back to the hospital bed. The heart monitor became slowly audible under the cadence of his breath.
Tony stuffed a forkful of mashed potatoes into his mouth to stop the frustrated scream clawing at his throat. “Right, sorry. Yes, I would like to go.”
.” When Steve froze like a cornered rabbit, Tony just examined him. The resemblance was eerily close. In the darkness, the differences would be unnoticeable. “Seems like we have a similar itch, and maybe a mutual way to scratch it.”
Questioning his own perception of reality was probably a good way to make himself go crazy, so he would just need to accept that he was a cat, on an alien planet that had two moons, and find Steve so they could figure out a way to get home. As soon as he did get home, he was going to open up Loki’s stomach and eat his entrails.
The rat had lead them quite neatly into some kind of giant chamber lit with floating golden lights. Rats lined long stone tables, and the biggest rat of them all sat up on the dais, all staring at them in stunned silence.
Tony made a put-upon noise and heard himself babbling, reading through the pages even though they were meaningless and he wanted to
, and he stepped around Tony until he stood in front of him. He was dressed in a dark blue knit top and pleated khaki pants (who under the age of 70 wore pleated pants unironically? Steve, that’s who. And he looked damn good in them.) Tony felt his lips pulling up at the corners.
. Jarvis had rearranged his entire schedule to accommodate it. Tony stood in the entryway of the commons room and glared down at the cluster of couches and cushions surrounding the TV. Chinese takeout boxes were spread out over the coffee table and the kitchen counter. There was a plate of fresh-baked cookies on the end table. Bowls of popcorn were on the floor in strategic places. His team was stuffed into couches and chairs, Clint was spread out on the floor with Natasha. The only seat left available was the loveseat. With Steve. They were all staring at him. Except Steve.
“Now, Mr. Stark… Pull the trigger.” Tony’s body rang with tension but his hand held steady, removing the variable of a wild gun. Steve could
Head bowed, Tony stepped down from the doorway and onto a patch of scraggly shore grass that had clawed through the sand. He leaned back to look up at the fight going on far above his head. Iron Man and War Machine were bare specs against the gray clouds, but he knew the shape of their fingers, the curve of War Machine’s neck as he angled upward, the vibration of the suit’s thrusters pushing him higher and higher.
