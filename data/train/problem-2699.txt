They said their goodbyes and made their way to the door. Anna was halfway to her car and Cas had just stepped out of the building when Dean stopped him.
“The stimulation is supposed to be pretty awesome. We will keep it on the lowest setting for now and work up. If it ever gets to be too much and you want to stop, just tell me,” Dean whispered. Dean switched on the plug, causing it to hum quietly, and repeated his pattern, lightly running it over Cas’ instep, up behind his knee and along his inner thigh. Cas kept his mouth shut, but whimpered quietly, his face half hidden in the pillow, eyes shut. “I need to hear you, Angel. I need to hear you say you’ll tell me if you want to stop.”
“Yeah, I’m fine. Just wanted to go down and find some coffee and breakfast. Didn’t want to wake you.” Dean stood and grabbed his phone and a room key off the desk. He still wouldn’t look at Cas.
“Give me your hands, Angel,” Dean said. Cas held both hands out in front of him as Dean cuffed each wrist.
) ran his tongue over his bottom lip. It was probably only a few seconds, but it felt like time came to a halt. Castiel was afraid to move. He was sure if he did, Dean would disappear and the spell would be broken.
“Well if that isn’t the sexiest fucking sight I’ve ever seen,” Dean said, his eyes dark with lust. “I will take care of that for you. I promise, Angel. But first, turn over” Dean ordered as he again grabbed the back of Cas’ knees and flipped him.
“Well? What do you think so far,” Charlie whispered, leaning towards him as the dancers made their way back to the wall.
“Ouch, that stings bro. But your reluctance tells me there’s more to the story and I’m guessing it means you and Romeo did a little dirty dancing between the sheets. Which, congrats, it’s about time Stella got her groove back. Makes me wonder, though, why you both look so miserable about it. Was it that bad?”
Castiel furrowed his brow in confusion but did as Dean asked, coming to stand directly in front of him.
“Yes, I remember Anna. Actually Dean here gave me his card for the shop he works at and suggested we get the car towed there tomorrow,” he said, gesturing towards Dean.
They were already four beads in at this point, and Cas had been so patient while Dean played and opened him up.
The other man, Castiel noticed, was barefoot, and in a simple white t-shirt and jeans. Although the room was dim, it was clear that he had a strong jawline and broad shoulders that led to narrow hips and slightly bowed legs. He had shorter, dirty blonde hair and full lips. But what caught Castiel’s attention the most was his laugh. Whatever had been said caused his entire body to respond, sending his torso backward; his head was thrown back, eyes closed and ending with the most beautiful smile Castiel had ever seen.
The water has turned lukewarm overhead, but Dean and Cas stand under the spray together, exchanging playful looks and quickly washing away any residual mess. They both freeze when there is a knock at the door. “Dean! What the hell are you doing in there, man? What’s taking so long?” Sam yells from outside the bathroom. Dean laughs and shouts back, “Sorry Sammy, be out in a minute. There’s really great water pressure in here!” Dean can almost hear Sam rolling his eyes. “That’s great, Dean. But, uh, try to save some hot water for the rest of the building, okay?”
“Oh,” Dean said, suddenly switching gears. “Well, that’s awfully nice of you to wait on her. Did she have the car taken anywhere yet?”
“I’ll be back in a bit. Don’t go anywhere, baby,” he said with a devilish laugh. Cas’ eyes went wide and his mouth dropped as he watched Dean turn and walk out of the room.
Dean couldn’t help his disappointment in having to say goodbye. Of course, he didn’t dislike Anna. She seemed to be a perfectly nice girl. It’s just that she kept showing up and taking Cas away from him.
Dean said nothing, eyes bouncing back and forth from Castiel to Charlie, his mouth parted slightly in a frown. The tension was broken by the privacy room door swinging open. Pam strode confidently up to them and wasted no time.
“I’ll try anyway. It’s the thought that counts. Just let me say this once and I’ll let it go if that’s what you really want. There is the potential for something really great here. But if you don’t try and fix your mistakes about how you acted, then you will lose it. And that one will be your fault.”
“Of course that’s possible,” Sam replied, nodding his head. “There’s always a risk. But. On the other side of that coin is you getting everything you’ve ever wanted? And if I were a betting man, I’d take those odds.”
“Been a busy week, but I had to come by and see my new best friend,” Charlie said, wrapping her arms around Castiel for a quick hug.
Dean stood watching the doors close in front of him. His stomach twisted painfully, until he could taste bile in the back of his throat. Castiel had pushed him away last night only to end up spending the night with a near stranger. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to have sex last night. He just didn’t want
Again, he helped Cas flip onto his back. All the while, the toy stayed nestled inside him.  Once Dean ensured he was as comfortable as he could be, he sat back to gaze down at his angel. Cas’s hard cock stood away from his body and bounced gently, dripping precome onto his belly. He ran his tongue over his lips and inhaled deeply, quietly watching Dean. While he appeared calm, Dean’s heart fluttered as he  recognized the fire in his blue eyes.
Dean closed his eyes and bit the inside of his cheek to fight against the swelling of his cock which had perked up like a damned teenager.  He was suddenly grateful he chose these particularly loose fitting yoga pants.
From where they sat on the floor, neither Dean or Cas looked up in response. “Sure,” Dean uttered. “Why not?”
“Apparently I’m not everyone,” Cas replied defensively. “My sister teases me about it. She says I wasn’t born with any kind of natural rhythm.”
Castiel nods and walks toward the door, waiting for Dean, who turns and gives the bar tender a big toothy smile and waves good night. “You stay safe out there, and thanks again for the drink and chat. Guess I needed that,” Dean adds as he starts for the door.
Castiel’s soft smile reached his eyes, looking at Dean like he was something special. It made him squirm under that kind of spotlight.
Caught off guard by the sudden subject change, Castiel stammered, “Oh! Uhm, Goblet of Fire. I just got past the dance.”
They stood there, alone in the corner of the poetry section, refusing to look away. And dammit, Dean could feel it. That pull. That stupid itch that made him want to push Cas against the stack of books, tangle his hands in his hair and stick his tongue down the guy’s throat.
Cas blinked and looked down. “Um, maybe this is a really bad time to mention this, but I don’t really know how to dance.”
“Yeah she does that,” he huffed. “How do you think I ended up doing physical therapy at a pole dance studio,” Dean asked, waving his hands around the dance space.
“Hmmm? Oh, yeah,” she continued. “All the way from regionals to international levels even. Obviously most people just do pole for fun, or as a cool workout. But for those who compete, it’s a big deal. Plus, there’s a pretty nice check waiting for the first place winner at nationals.”
Dean gently tucked Cas’ softening cock back inside his shorts. While Dean’s dick was still rock hard and aching for release, a part of him was also perfectly happy to just sit here holding Cas while he came down from his orgasm. Cas finally opened his glossy blue eyes and looked up at Dean with a soft, satisfied grin.
Castiel smiled as he quickly sorted through the tapes in front of him before selecting Led Zeppelin IV and gently pushing it into the tape deck. He wasn’t sure if that had been a test or not, but Dean’s smile and approving nod made him feel like he got it right anyway.
By noon they were inside the convention center and checked in with the registration table. Since Dean was also signed up in the solo category, he would be competing today. The duo routines were judged on day two. While Dean went backstage to get ready for his routine, everyone else claimed an area together in the audience.
“I just,” he stammered. “Whatever happens out there, thanks. I wouldn’t be here at all if it weren’t for you so just, thanks.”
“Well, you could always just strip down to your skivvies.” Dean couldn’t help his stupid mouth, but when Cas’ eyes shot up in shock, he just gave his most charming smile and hoped he hadn’t already scared the guy off. “Just kidding. Running shorts are fine for now,” he added.
He was saved by the dramatic swoosh of the curtain. Pam stepped out to greet them with a smirk, decked out in her signature black yoga pants and cropped Motley Crue t-shirt.
“I think it’s best if I go back to my room. We both need to get some sleep and be ready for tomorrow.” Castiel looked down, a heaviness in his shoulders. “I think we really have a shot at this. I just don’t want tonight to be the thing that messes it all up,” Cas said quietly, his eyes sad. Dean couldn’t help but feel like he wasn’t talking about the competition at all. “Let’s see where we are this time tomorrow okay? Get some rest and I’ll see you in the morning.” Cas leaned forward on his knees to place a soft kiss on Dean’s forehead.
“Get on with it,” Cas said, his voice laced with desperation. “I can take more, Dean. You don’t have to go so slowly.”
Dean takes a long breath and slowly exhales through his lips. “You know, I don’t have a lot of memories of my mother. She was taken from us when I was only four. But one thing I can recall is my mom telling me angels were watching over me. And now, wouldn’t you know it, one actually does. One stubborn, overly protective, self-sacrificing warrior of God was chosen to save me. One angel literally pulled me out of Hell and told me I was worth saving. And then he rebelled against Heaven to fight beside me and my brother to save the world.” Dean looks up with a proud grin on his face and a slight blush in his cheeks.
“Thank you, Dean. I appreciate that. But Saturday night wasn’t just your responsibility. I was a willing participant too.” “Very willing,” he added, his voice dropping lower. “And for what it’s worth? I don’t regret it.”
“You love this song. You said Swayze always gets a pass. And it was your idea to play Rock, Paper Scissors to help us decide,” Cas whispered back. “Although, I do have a confession. Sam let it slip that you always throw scissors during that game, so I knew I had an advantage,” he said in a rush.
“Dean. I was fully on board last night. You didn’t take advantage of anything I wasn’t willing to give. I don’t want you feeling like that. We agreed last night we were just getting it out of our system. Just blowing off steam. And that’s okay. It doesn’t need to complicate things.”
“Barely,” Cas answered after a ragged breath. “I’m doing what I can to keep myself from getting too overwhelmed and coming too soon, as you requested. But it’s not without difficulty.”
Castiel looked up at him in surprise, with that adorable head tilt he did when he didn’t understand something. “You really like them?”
Cas slowly removes both fingers, forcing Dean to whine at the loss. Cas stands, his eyes closed, breathing hard. “Cas. That was. Wow,” Dean whispers. He looks down to see that Cas is clearly uncomfortable; his own cock, achingly hard, hasn’t even been touched. “Fuck, Cas, let me take care of you now. My turn okay?” Dean goes to move his hand over Cas, but Cas pushes him away. He opens his eyes to look directly at Dean and shakes his head. “I want to be inside you, Dean. Please. I don’t think I’ll last long at this rate, but please. Please turn around,” he pleads with desperation. Dean steals a kiss and smiles before spinning around and placing his hands on the wall to brace himself. The anticipation has reignited his excitement, his cock somehow already half hard again. Castiel spits in his hand and spreads it over the length of his cock and once again to massage around Dean’s tight hole. Cas lines himself up and pushes slowly past the tight muscle until he is fully inside Dean. He pauses for a moment, allowing both of them to adapt to the intensity. Using his right hand, Cas grasps Dean by the back of his head, pulling at his short hair, and forces him to look up and arch his back. His left hand has a grip around Dean’s hip so tight, Dean knows there will be bruises later. Cas pulls out almost completely, before ramming back into Dean with a growl. This time, he does not stop, setting a brutal pace that has Dean seeing stars. It takes everything Dean has not scream as Cas pounds faster and harder, hitting his prostate over and over again. “Umph, mmm, Cas, baby. You’re gonna make me come again. Please, baby, come with me. I want to feel you come with me.” Dean repeats the last sentence over and over, like a breathless prayer. Dean comes for the second time, spilling across the tile wall. Castiel thrusts three more times deep inside of Dean and stills, finding his release, his mouth open and eyes twisted shut. He relaxes his grip on Dean and slowly pulls out, both of them wimpering from overstimulation.
“Um, not so good, actually. I just got some pretty bad news today, so things could definitely be better,” Dean said, his prior mood threatening to darken this brief moment of peace.
Before Dean could follow after them, he caught Charlie side eyeing him with a weird look on her face.
The bar tender shrugs her shoulders and gives Dean a sympathetic look. “Yeah, that sounds like family, alright. We fight with the ones we care the most about.” Again, realizing the conversation has become serious, she eases the tension. “So Cas has been with you and Sam for years now? Has he gotten to have any fun on Earth, or is it all monsters and devastation?”
As soon as the last of the ice cube melted inside his mouth, he grazed over Castiel’s fluttering hole with the cold tip of his tongue. Castiel immediately bucked against it, crying out in a combination of Dean’s name, a few swears, and several words in Enochian Dean didn’t recognize.
“Yeah,” Dean forced out. The air felt different all of a sudden. Thicker. Dean’s hands grazed over Castiel’s heated skin, along his side. His eyes flicked down to Castiel’s mouth, now mere inches away from his. This wasn’t the first time he had a desire to find out what Cas’ lips tasted like. He looked back up to find Cas’ gaze also directed toward his mouth.
Dean watched them pull out of the little parking lot, turned on his heels and headed for the studio next door, his head and his heart feeling just a little lighter. An hour on the pole would make him feel even better. It felt like a Metallica night.
Dean handed over a ten and stuffed the change into the tip jar, then went to stare out of the large front window while Alfie made his drinks. It wasn’t late by any standard, but January meant long nights; it felt like the sun barely made an appearance today. Maybe Mother Nature was sympathetic; she knew better than to offer a beautiful sunny day while he sat in the emergency room with Lisa. Dean could feel himself being pulled down into his misery again when-
“Um, you’re welcome I guess,” he said, unsure of himself. “I mean, I don’t really know what I did to help. I just sat and listened. Dean told me about Lisa and about how you got him into dancing after his accident and about his plans for the garage and that everything is kind of on hold now.”
Cas grunted and pushed Dean’s legs up toward his torso, stretching his hips even wider. He slowed his pace to grind into Dean even deeper, making little figure eights with his hips. He leaned forward to grab Dean’s hands and bring them down under Dean’s knees.
“Yeah. We didn’t. For a long time,” he said with a bitter half smile. “Then one night, we got a call from him. Said he was in town and wanted to meet with us for dinner. Dean was against it at first, but I finally got him to agree to it. So, we picked Dad up at his hotel and we all went out. Dad told us he’d been sober for two years, and even had talked to a therapist a few times. He apologized for all the shit he did when we were kids. All the stuff he said before we left. Told us he was proud of us; that he wanted us to be a family again. I still remember the look on Dean’s face,” Sam said, a far away look in his eyes.
Summer moved along. For Castiel that meant a slightly slower pace at the bookstore since the college crowd was gone for the season. He didn’t mind it. Especially when Dean started dropping by every other morning hoping to score one of Gabriel’s hand pies for breakfast. After the third visit, Castiel had begged Gabriel to always have a fresh batch of them ready in the pastry case.
Of course, there was a chance that Dean would laugh in his face. His sensible side told him that wasn’t likely, but fear does funny things.
Dean tried to hide the flush he felt in his cheeks. He knew he basically just asked Cas if he wanted to Netflix and chill. With pie. But honestly, the implications of that offer hadn’t crossed his mind until it was too late to backtrack without sounding like a dumbass or like a downright asshole. So he just did himself a favor for once and kept his big ol’ mouth shut.. He really just wanted to spend more time with Cas.
They’d been at it for a couple of hours when Pam announced she was officially done for the night. She disappeared to her back office for a few minutes and returned with her bag and a silver key that she pressed into Dean’s palm.
His phone buzzed with a message from Anna letting him know the shop had called. Her car was all done and ready for pick up.  Anxiety twisted Castiel’s stomach. If he had to drop Anna off to get her car, he would probably see Dean. As much as that thought excited him, the auto shop probably wasn’t the best place for the conversation Castiel wanted to have. His phone buzzed again, this time Anna letting him know that she was getting a ride with a coworker named Jeannine who worked in the photography department. He blew a chest full of air out of his mouth and forced his nerves to calm down. This gave him a little more time to figure out exactly what he was going to say when he did see Dean. And if Charlie was right about Dean’s practice schedule, he knew exactly where and when to find him.
While he told Kevin he’d be in the closet-office working on this week’s payroll, he had immediately pulled up a search engine. He spent the better part of two hours immersed in videos, reading pages upon pages of rules and regulations, and going to war with his own imagination. It was a crazy idea. One that was definitely out of his comfort zone. But perhaps that’s exactly what he needed. Anna was right. All he did anymore was go to work and come home to an empty apartment, eat the same dinner and reread the same books every night before dragging himself to bed, just to do it all again the next day. He’d spent so long wrapped up in his own little cocoon, hiding away from life and it’s possibilities.
Castiel tilted his head and squinted at him. “Alright.” He spun on his heels and headed for the aisles, which were empty now. A moment later, Dean found themselves in a secluded corner of the store, away from any prying eyes and ears of well meaning brothers. Cas straightened his back and crossed his arms in front of him, waiting, expresion guardaded and flat.
Castiel blushed. He had never considered himself to be an influential person. He stared at the neat stack of novels in front of him, his hands picking at them until they were completely aligned.
He didn’t wait long before he heard the first notes of a familiar tune. It was the classic sultry rhythm of Santa Baby. Dean entered the room slowly, popping his hips to the music. Castiel’s eyes nearly fell out of his head and he couldn’t contain the giggle that escaped his mouth at the sight of his husband. Dean was barefoot and dressed in low slung red pants, a red velvet Santa jacket trimmed in white fur, tied with a red sash, and a classic Santa hat laying lop-sided on his head.
Dean’s own erection was becoming almost painful inside his underwear. It was time to move on to the next part of his plan. He turned the plug off again and let Castiel catch his breath.
“Dean, if you start drooling, I’m never gonna let you hear the end of it,” Sam said with a teasing grin.
“Okay, I’m going to stop you right there. You’re not a dumbass because you guys had sex. I think that part was inevitable.”
“Oh my fucking god, Cas, do that again! Do that again, please, please,” Dean begged. “You’re gonna make me come, I’m so fucking close!”
“Interesting,” she said, crossing her arms and tapping a finger against her chin. “I know we won’t get into choreography for a while, but do you think you’d be able to teach Dean a few floor moves?”
“Happy to help. And I’m glad you had a good class. I’ll give your review to Pam; I’m sure she’ll like to hear it.”
Castiel rolled his eyes to himself. He should have known Dean would be uncomfortable accepting all of the money if they won. With a sigh, he smiled up at the ceiling. “Okay Dean. Fifty-fifty. You have yourself a deal.”
“I told you. Without my powers, I lost control over my vessel. I usually keep them hidden, but...I couldn’t help it. I’m sorry, Dean. As soon as you release the handcuffs, I’ll be able to put them away. We probably shouldn’t use the cuffs anymore to prevent it from happening again.”
Dean laughed at Gabriel’s big brother threat, but his smile quickly fell when Gabriel only looked back with not an ounce of humor in his eyes. Being a big brother himself, he knew Gabriel was serious. He was annoying and a little intrusive, but he clearly had his brother’s best interest in mind, and Dean couldn’t help but respect that.
He knew he should be excited. They had done it. They actually fucking won and were heading to nationals in San Diego. But every other minute he was awake he was reminded of those blue eyes staring back at him, clouded in a thinly veiled sadness ever since they woke up and Dean opened his stupid mouth yesterday morning. So if he could escape his traitorous memory by sleeping the day away, that’s what he was gonna do.
Dean slowly lowered his body down until he could drop and land softly on the wood floor. The music came to an end and without warning, the curtain was pulled open dramatically to announce their presence.
Castiel steadied his nerves as he walked into the front room of the studio and immediately made eye contact with Charlie, who had the biggest, most self-satisfied smile he’d ever seen on anyone who wasn’t Gabriel.
Well, guys and gals, I have completed my first Supernatural fan fiction. And this last chapter just went and dove into the deep end. I'm really happy with it, and I hope you like it too! Thanks for reading!
While Dean was asleep in minutes, Castiel lay there studying the freckles sprinkled over Dean’s nose, spreading over his cheek in an untraceable pattern. He couldn’t explain the weird feeling in his chest. They’d just had sex. Amazing, dirty sex. The kind you think about later when you’re all alone with just your hand and your imagination. All of the filthy words and the mind blowing orgasm. But this. Laying together, falling asleep on the same pillow, feet tangled up in the sheets. Dean's hand resting over Cas’ hip. This felt so much more intimate.
Dean struggled to take in a breath while watching Cas swirl his tongue around the head. Cas lifted his face to look up at Dean, leaving behind a little string of saliva on his cock.
“Wow. I’m impressed,” Castiel said with certainty. “Really sounds like you’ve come a long way and worked really hard to get here. You should be proud of that. And Lisa seems like a really great partner. Are you two, you know…,” he questioned awkwardly, his voice wavering a little.
“I thought we “got it out of our system” when we did it the first time.” Cas paused where he stood over Dean, his eyes roaming up and down Dean’s body. “However, you do make a compelling argument.”
Castiel looked up at Dean with wide eyes and flushed cheeks, more than the champagne could be responsible for.
Castiel dared himself to look back up at Dean. For a whole minute, neither of them moved, eyes fixed on each other as if they were trying to finish the conversation without words. Dean swiped his tongue along his bottom lip, shifted on his feet, and stood up straighter. He cleared his throat and crossed his arms . “Give me twenty-four hours to think about it? I’m not saying no. I just need a day.”
Looking around, Castiel watched as the rows filled up with family and friends, most of whom he didn’t recognize. He nodded his head and smiled at Alfie, the kid who ran the Last Drop who picked a spot about midway on the opposite side. He turned back around to look down at the people sitting next to him. Sam and Jess were to his right, followed by Pam. To his left, the empty seat reserved for Dean. For a brief moment, he choked back the emotion he felt, sitting here at the front to support Charlie, who had included him to help represent her family.
“Yep, that’s my place. My brother Gabriel is the coffee and pastry guy. I’m just the quiet, unassuming bookworm. All I ever do is read, so the idea of owning a bookstore just made sense to me. That’s why Anna made me come with her tonight. Apparently, re-reading Harry Potter wasn't exciting to her. To be honest, this isn’t really my thing,” he said apologetically, hoping he hadn't just lost a frequent customer. He also wondered why the hell he just explained all of that to her.
“Shut up, Sam,” Dean grunted, rolling his eyes and looking away to slyly wipe his mouth with the back of his hand, just in case.
“Okay, okay, be like that. We’ll go with that then. For now,” Gabriel snorted and started sipping on Castiel's coffee, humming and closing his eyes dramatically at the taste. Castiel rolled his eyes and grabbed the cup while his brother was caught up in his own theatrics. Gabriel just laughed and allowed him to leave with his coffee, even though they both knew he wouldn’t let it go. He never did.
Of course, Gabriel followed him, casually leaning against one side of the desk. “One. My name’s not Elsa; it’s like you don’t even know me. And two, it kinda sounds like you did something new, and that not a Cassie thing to do.”  "Or maybe you did
Castiel stood against the opposite wall, looking down at his phone. He peered up at Dean with a shy smile. He didn’t seem to be panicking as much as Dean was. Or maybe he was good at hiding it. They stood facing each other in a heavy silence.
And fuck him he did. Cas started slow, pulling almost all the way out to pull at Dean’s rim before thrusting forward in one swift movement. As their pace increased, Dean wrapped his legs around Cas’ waist and let his hands roam over the muscles in Cas’ back. Cas found a spot of salty skin on Dean’s neck that he latched onto with eagerness.
), he had switched out the tiny black shorts for a pair of black knee-length yoga pants. Not much better considering he was still shirtless, but Castiel had wondered if he’d be able to present his idea and not be a bumbling mess if Dean was nearly naked while he did it.
“I was planning to surprise you tonight, but the pole makes it even better. Merry Christmas baby,” Dean said with a wink.
The hip huggers were tight and low across his belly, showing off the outline of Cas’ cock perfectly. The fabric was a stark contrast against Cas’ tan hips and Dean had to fight the urge to drop to his knees and run his tongue along the line where skin met  lace.
“Ahh, fuck Cas! You’re killing me, sweetheart. I'm already kind of on the edge here and I’m gonna come right here right now if you keep that up,” Dean warned, squeezing his eyes shut, trying with everything he had to keep his body under his control.
Castiel woke the next morning warm and surprisingly energized, considering the activities of the previous night. His mind was immediately flooded with the memory of warm skin, lips that begged to be kissed, and sounds he would remember forever. Castiel couldn’t remember the last time he felt so confident during sex. He and Ishim had been together for years and Castiel rarely took charge in bed and Ishim rarely showed much enthusiasm when he did. Clearly something was missing between them considering how it ended. Castiel realized he was alone in bed since he could hear the shower running in the bathroom. He rolled onto his back and pulled his body into a long slow stretch. A few minutes later, he hadn’t moved when Dean came out of the bathroom fully dressed. Cas sat up and Dean froze. Dean’s eyes quickly dropped to the floor as he muttered, “Uh, hey.” Dean made his way to the little sofa to pull his shoes on. He seemed to be making it a point to avoid eye contact.
Dean stared down at a spot in the sand and chewed on his lip. By the tone of Sam’s voice, he knew it wasn’t really a question.
Hours later, Castiel and Dean stood against opposing walls in the small space set aside for performers backstage. They mirrored each other, eyes cast down and arms crossed in front of them. They were next to perform and Castiel was panicking inside his head. What was he thinking? Agreeing to go out on stage in nothing but these tiny shorts and try to not make a fool out of himself. What if he fell on his ass? What if he humiliated Dean and he never wanted to see him again and all of this was over in the next five minutes.
In no time at all, the reception was in full swing. The buffet had been cleared. The cake had been cut. More than a few glasses of champagne had been consumed. Everyone had converged onto the dance floor. Their little motley crue all danced together as a unit rather than pairing off like others did. The good mood was infectious and Castiel couldn’t remember having fun like this in a long time.
Cas pulled his mouth away from Dean’s neck, skimming over his jawline, before finally finding Dean’s waiting lips. With so much sensation pushing him closer to the edge, Dean let a moan escape as their tongues played against each other. Then, breaking the kiss, Cas looked down over him with a smile.
“Maybe?” Teasingly, Cas looked over his shoulder with a kittenish smile and  lowered his black trousers to reveal soft dark blue lace panties hugging the curves of his ass.
“Ah, fuck! Hold on, Dean, we gotta take a break,” he grumbled. “My back is killing me,” he said, hunched over and attempting to rub at a sore spot with the back of his hand while holding on to the pole for support. Without thinking, Dean immediately stepped up behind Cas and laid a gentle hand on his warm skin, about mid way down his back and to the right of his spine.
He was brought back to the present, and possibly given a small heart attack when a husky voice approached him from behind.
“Oh, man. Cas? Where do I even start?” Dean shakes his head and laughs. “I mean, this guy walks into my life, literally with sparks flying, looks me dead in the eye and tells me he’s an angel of the Lord. This nerdy dude in an oversized trench coat with impossibly messy hair, who doesn’t understand any of my awesome jokes, was chosen by God himself to watch over me. And as crazy as I thought the situation was, now I can’t imagine my life without him. And there have been a few times where I thought I would have to. But every time he has been taken from us, somehow we always find our way back to each other. Cas is our family.”
“Anyway, we should get going,” Anna suggested. “I’ve got a staff meeting at 8 tomorrow morning, and I want to organize my notes for the article.”
“Much better, thank you,” he huffed. “I’d really like to repay you for your kindness, if that’s okay.”
Castiel huffed in laughter as he placed Charlie’s selections in a thin canvas tote bag and handed it to her, along with her change.
Knowing they were about to fall over the edge of what promised to be a very powerful orgasm, Dean managed to feel around and find the remote attached to the plug still nestled deep inside Cas. “Get ready baby,” Dean warned. With one last evil grin, he pushed the button to trigger the strongest vibration setting.
“Don’t you think I’ve thought about it? But the way my life works, anytime I think I might have a shot at something good, it gets dragged away from me. I’m still waiting for all this to come crashing down,” Dean said, gesturing around him. “I mean, Sammy, let’s say I actually do it. What if I put myself out there and he walks away?  What if everything goes wrong and I end up losing everything? Again.”
Dean leaned down in between them to haul up a worn cardboard box full of cassette tapes and dropped it right in Cas’s lap. “And for being awesome, you get to choose our driving music.”
So, this is my first crack at fan fiction after years of a creative writing hiatus. And, of course, it's Destiel. The first half is ultra fluffy, but I made up for it in the end. Yep, that's right kids-smut! Hope you like it!
They’d been working on a particularly difficult move when Cas came down from a spin and gasped in pain.
“Not tonight. You see, earlier this evening, I took the liberty...of prepping myself,” Dean explained as he turned away from Cas and wiggled his ass, showing off the shiny glass base of his own plug. “Just in case.”
“Well, when an angel of the lord tells me he wants to be tied up and controlled in bed, that makes me wonder exactly how much he can take. Call it an experiment, if you will,” Dean said with a cocky grin while he stood up and finally tucked his thumbs inside the elastic waistband of his boxers and pulled them down until they fell at his feet.
“You know what,” Dean said, turning back around to look Castiel in the eye. “You’re on. Let me run this over to Charlie and I’ll be back in a minute.” After setting his to go cup on the small table Cas occupied, Dean swiftly carried the now warm latte next door. As expected, Charlie was waiting for him, leaning on the front desk with her head in her hands and a knowing smile on her face.
He left the bookstore and made it back to the safety of the Impala. He said what he needed to say and Castiel forgave him. They agreed to act like adults and move past everything that, at one point, threatened to destroy all they had already accomplished. Dean should feel better. So why didn’t he? Why was his fear replaced by a sense of loss. The feeling that he lost something before he ever really had it. He rubbed his hands over his face, rough from two days of stubble. Gritting his teeth, he cranked the engine and pulled away, ready to be back in his bed.
“Castiel,” Dean repeated slowly, testing each syllable like he was swirling the word around in his mouth to get a taste for it. It made Castiel shiver. “Pretty unique name. How did you get that one but your sister’s just Anna?” Dean asked with a raised brow.
After a quick clean up, Castiel got them settled under the sheets facing each other. Dean burrowed in closer, tangling their legs around each other.
“Well, I’ve been thinking. I like the idea of being tied up. Not anything crazy of course. I just like the thought of what might happen, knowing I didn't have complete control over my vessel. Couldn’t touch you, even if I wanted to.” Cas paused for a moment. “What do you think, Dean?” Cas looked up to find Dean frozen, staring back at him.
He didn’t know how long he stood there staring at the door, chewing on his bottom lip and dissecting pieces of their conversation. Charlie was a smart girl, but she was not very subtle. It was clear she came here with an ulterior motive. He didn't really pay much mind to that though, for his brain had just come up with an incredibly intriguing idea.
Castiel pushed away the familiar emotions of rejection, desperate to fix this. Slowly, Castiel pulled the sheets away from him and stood up. He didn’t like having to have this conversation in only his underwear, but he wasn’t about to ask Dean to wait until he got dressed. He kept his voice steady.
“Oh my god, Charlie, that’s amazing! Congratulations! Oh, I’m so happy for you,” he said, stepping forward to wrap his arms around her in a quick hug.
That’s when Castiel noticed that Lisa’s injuries had healed. She wasn’t wearing the sling over her arm like she had been when she stopped by the studio a few times to chat with Pam. Her accident was months ago, so she would probably be released to start training again soon. And that’s when it hit Cas like a punch to the gut. Once she could practice again, Dean wouldn’t need him anymore.
“Keep your hands up where they are. There should be plenty of give in the fabric to turn you around just like this.”
Once again, Sam, Jess, and Pam traveled with them. The newlyweds, Charlie and Dorothy, would be meeting up with them this afternoon at their hotel. This time around, their supporters also included Gabriel and his girlfriend Kali, as well as Bobby and his wife Ellen. Everyone important in Dean’s life was here as a reminder that his family had his back.
“Oh. No, that’s…that's okay. I mean Pam is beautiful. But, um. She’s not exactly my type, if you get what I mean,” Castiel whispered.
The man closed the back of the case and studied Dean for a moment with a neutral expression before his mouth pulled up into a lopsided grin.
“But I’m only in if we split any prize money fifty-fifty. That’s how Lisa and I were going to do it and I don’t think that should change. With as much time and effort that you’ll be putting into this, there’s no way I’ll agree to keeping all of it if we win.”
Wide eyed, Dean glanced around to make sure his little brother was nowhere within earshot. Sam had been reorganizing the library for two days, only showing up at random times for food. When he was sure they were still alone, Dean looked back to Cas, a small but wicked grin forming on his lips. “Um,” he paused to clear his throat. “Yeah. Yep. That, uh,  sounds good to me, Cas. Let’s do that.” Suddenly, the cherry pie in front of him wasn’t the most delicious thing in that kitchen.
“And you? What was Dean going to do with his winnings?” Cas took a sip from his mug and urged Dean to continue.
Dean laughs and nods. He certainly wasn’t prepared to discuss this new discovery, especially not this soon. And certainly not with Cas. But he should have known Cas would be near, waiting in the sidelines should Dean need him. So, it would seem now is as good a time as any to figure this out. Thanks to the liquid courage, Dean concludes that he might as well just go for it. He is Dean Freaking Winchester. He saved the world. He killed Hitler. He got drunk with God. How bad could this go?
Struggling to keep air in his lungs, he frantically pushed the call button to take him back down to his room. By the time he stepped out onto his floor, there was only one priority left in his mind. He listened to his heart and did the only thing he could think of. He ran.
“Cassie! Guess what? I’m going to sign up for the beginner’s class!” Anna bounced up and down excitedly.
“Remember, Cas. If you want to stop, just say it, and I’ll unlock them,’ Dean warned as he bent down to pick up Cas’s discarded tie on the floor.
How had he already mastered the sad puppy look that Dean could never resist? Up until now, it only ever worked when Sam or, on occasion, Charlie did it.
It had been two days since Dean agreed to take on Castiel as a partner. Tonight marked their first official rehearsal. Rehearsal was a loose term here, since he and Pam would be putting Cas through a crash course on Pole 101 as quickly and as safely possible. They budgeted at least a few weeks to bring Cas up to speed and let him gain the necessary strength and skill to actually start practicing choreography. Pam’s Intro to Pole class was an eight week course. They were hoping to cut that in half for Castiel.
“Fffuck,” Cas whined, his eyes shut tight and lips parted. Dean ran his thumb along Cas’s rim where it clenched and fluttered around the toy.
Sam closed his laptop. “You heard anything from Cas since lunch? He said he was gonna go look for the ingredients we need for that spell. Kinda thought he’d be back by now,” he asked with a concerned look.
“Very funny, Charles. Sorry it took a minute. Actually I just came to drop it off. I think I’m gonna head back over and hang out for a little while. Pam still has a few minutes left ‘til the space is clear anyway,” Dean said, casually checking his watch as he backed out of the studio.
. You’re perfect. I know you said it’s been a while, but I didn’t think you meant that long. How is that possible?”
“Yes. No. I don’t know,” Castiel stuttered. “Do it again,” he pleaded, making Dean huff a quiet laugh. He settled himself down on his belly in between Castiel’s legs and swept over Castiel’s exposed hole with his flat tongue, over and over again, until Castiel became a whiney, writhing mess. He pointed his tongue and flicked it over the sensitive skin, gradually pushing in and working him open. Dean covered his index finger in spit and worked it gently into him. When Cas quietly begged for more, Dean added his middle finger and continued to stretch him open. When Castiel began rolling his hips, simultaneously humping the mattress and fucking himself back on Dean’s fingers, Dean scraped his teeth over the flesh of Castiel’s ass and bit down in a warning. He kissed the same spot and slowly removed his fingers, despite Castiel’s protesting.
“Nah, I’m sure it won’t be as bad as you think. I promise to give this a shot if you do. But same goes for you, buddy. If you hate it and want to back out, no hurt feelings on my end,” Dean replied, trying to sound as optimistic as possible. He offered his hand out to Cas.
A few minutes later Castiel found himself sitting on the aged hardwood floor with his back against an exposed brick wall. The room was on the narrow side but felt bigger due to a mirror running the entire length of the wall opposite him. Heavy fabric draped along the other two walls in shades of dark red, likely to aid in the acoustics of the open space. A plain door interrupted one of those walls, adorned with a simple sign requesting “Privacy Please”. The lights were dim and candlelight danced in the mirror, showing off the small table covered in wine bottles and snacks a few feet down from where Castiel sat. Incense was burning somewhere, a warm, woodsy scent filling the room, but not overpowering it. And of course, there were the poles. Eight shiny poles, evenly spaced, rising up from the floor all the way to the ceiling. Castiel had to admit, the room's atmosphere was warm. Inviting. Luxurious.
Castiel’s not sure how long he actually stood there, getting his first look at Dean from only a few feet away. Now that the main overhead lights were on in the building, he could see details that were previously hidden in the dimness. Specifically, mossy green eyes and a galaxy of freckles sprinkled across Dean’s nose and along his cheekbones. His mouth pulled up on one side in a charming grin that showed off full pouty lips. Luckily for Castiel’s sanity, he was dressed again, back in the low slung ratty jeans and a white t-shirt. He was still delectable, but at least he wasn’t nearly naked. A few seconds (or hours, he really couldn’t be sure) later, his brain kindly reminded him that he had been asked a question.
“Oh! Well...great! I think that sounds like a fun idea!” Castiel tried to sound sincere. He knew his sister. She would go to two classes. Maybe three, before losing interest.
Dean turned and took a seat in the arm chair along the wall. “Good. Now, Cas. You said you want me to take control. So. Strip. Slowly.”
“I can’t even imagine how much strength it takes to come back from something like that. It’s...I don’t know...inspirational,” Cas said.
“Alright, then. I think it’s time for some tunes.” Dean turned on his heel, trying to break the tension, and walked straight to the stereo system. Cranking up Led Zeppelin always helped get him in the zone during practice. He bopped his head along with the beat and turned around to find Castiel staring at him with a curious look. “What’s wrong?”
Dean wiped a hand across his face and bit the inside of his cheek. “Um, about six years now. I was in a really bad car accident before that. And, uh, once I was cleared to start physical therapy, it was actually Charlie’s idea to try pole for strength training instead of going to a regular gym. Pamela worked with me one on one and slowly it evolved. Once I was strong enough, I started playing around with different moves and tricks. And I realized I could use the music I grew up listening to. So I started choreographing routines to Led Zeppelin and AC/DC and Metallica. Just kinda made it mine, ya know? Lisa had just started taking classes about that time too. We just kinda clicked and started working together.” Dean paused, choosing to focus on picking at his nails while he told his sad story. “Then, last year, Pam suggested we try competing. That we were ready. We both needed the money anyway, and it’s good publicity for the studio if we win. Nothing to lose by trying right? So, we went to regionals together in Dallas. Didn’t win obviously, but still did pretty well considering it was our first shot at it. I was really hoping this year would be our time, ya know?”
“Dean,” Cas growled. “Dean, stop. It’s getting late. We shouldn’t do this tonight,” Cas whispered in between kisses.
“It’s good to see you happy, man,” Sam said, still not looking at him. “You deserve it. I’m proud of you. We all are. No matter what happens tomorrow, we'll still be proud.”
“Five. There’s Anna and me, and our brothers, Gabriel, Michael, and of course, Lucifer. He really got the short straw on that one,” Castiel said with a straight face.
Nodding his head, Gabriel twisted his mouth to one side and inhaled deeply through his nose. “Well Cassie, the way I see it, you’ve got two options. Option one, keep doing what you’re doing. You both keep dancing around each other, literally and figuratively. You don’t say a word, stay “just friends” and stay miserable about it.”
“Wait, what?” Dean asked, clearly taken aback. “Then why would you want to do this? Huh? Why would you want to help me?” Dean asked suspiciously.
“I’ve had to watch you strut around here, swinging around on a goddamned stripper pole, nearly naked and completely perfect. It’s been torture,” he rumbled, before finally sweeping his hot flat tongue up Dean’s length from root to tip like he was licking an ice cream cone.
“So, I’ll see you tomorrow,” Castiel said as they walked to where their cars were parked next to one another.
Working for Bobby meant it wasn’t too hard to call and explain why he wouldn’t make it to the shop today. Bobby always said family came first. Even if they aren’t blood.
“Well not everything. Cas filled me in on what happened when I dropped him off last night. I didn’t ask for all the dirty details. But I know enough. And I wish I was here to celebrate my BFF finally breaking his vow of celibacy. But I’m not. I’m here because you are officially a dumbass. When you didn’t answer any of my messages, I called the shop and Bobby said you stayed home today, so I knew where to find you.”
“Please. You’re as subtle as the tornado in The Wizard of Oz,” Gabriel teased as he pretended to examine the cup of coffee in his hands, easily dodging Castiel's half hearted attempts to grab it. . “So, tell me, Tin Man, what’s put the extra oomph in your step today?”
“And don’t worry about disappointing him. I don’t think you could,” Sam continued. “To be fair, the only person Dean ever blames for anything is himself. That’s just how he is. So, if things don’t go well tomorrow, just be ready for that.”
“Dean. You have these amazing plans for your future. You know what you want and you’re so close to making it happen. And if winning this can help you get closer to that, then I’d like to help. Plus, I just…,” Cas stopped mid-sentence, searching Dean’s eyes for any signs of judgment. He looked down at the floor and spoke again. “The thing is, I don’t have plans for the future. I used to. Or at least I think I did. But for a really long time now, all of my days are exactly the same. I’m just going through the motions, but not really living, you know? I just...I need something life-affirming. So, I’m doing this for me as much as I’m doing it for you.”
After what seems like a perfect eternity, Dean reluctantly breaks the kiss, but doesn’t back away from Cas. He can’t. Cas has a feirce grip on either side of Dean’s leather jacket, holding him in place.
Dean quickly strips and steps into the shower. For a minute he stands still, letting the hot water pour over him. Dean pours a small amount of wash into his hands and inhales. “Coconut. Nice,” he comments to himself. He works it into a lather and within minutes is covered in a slippery layer of bubbles. One hand slips lower to wrap around his half hard cock which has been neglected since he awoke. Dean decides to let himself enjoy his morning shower; they aren’t in any hurry today, right? He leans back onto to the cool tile of the shower wall and closes his eyes. As his hand moves and twists around his cock, last night comes flooding back again. “Mmm, Cas,” he whispers.
“As tempting as it is, I don’t want to come like that right now.” Castiel gathered the hem of Dean’s t-shirt and pulled it up over his head. “Scoot back,” Cas ordered, gently pushing Dean away until he complied, crawling backward and laying his head on the down pillow. Castiel pulled his shirt up over his head and followed after him on his hands and knees until Dean was boxed in. Hovering over him, Cas leaned down to kiss Dean, before continuing along his jawline, brushing his lips slowly down Dean’s neck where he placed another kiss just under his ear.
A few hours later Castiel and the rest of Dean’s cheering squad whooped and hollered as Dean was announced as the first place winner in the men’s solo category. Of course Castiel was biased, but there was no doubt Dean was the best in the group. The other routines were good of course. But they were also a little boring. Their music selection was bland and their performance was basic. Watching Dean up on stage, under the lights with the wailing rhythms of Led Zeppelin was hypnotizing. Dean was unforgettable.
Castiel huffed a laugh. “Figures you’d be a bossy bottom.” He pulled out, causing a whimper from Dean. Without another word, he stood up and walked around to the foot of the bed, grabbed Dean by his calves, and yanked him down until his ass was just at the edge of the mattress. He threw both of Dean’s legs up on his shoulders, and, using his tight grip on his thighs as leverage, Castiel slammed back into him.
“Dude, calm down. No one actually watches this show for the medical accuracy. People watch for the drama and the good looking cast. I mean, Dr. Sexy is named that for a reason.”
Four group routines later, Castiel had to admit the whole thing was pretty cool. There was a lot of work and physical demand that went into this kind of activity, which obviously increased with the higher-level classes. It was definitely sexy, and somehow, even with the stripper heels, classy...graceful. Each routine was split between different tricks and spins on the pole as well as floor work. The one thought that stayed in Castiel’s mind was that it looked...fun.
With his back still turned, Dean bit down on his bottom lip to fight the smirk on his face. “Eh, you know Cas. He probably just got tied up somewhere. I’m sure he’s fine.” He turned and headed back out of the kitchen towards his room. “‘Night Sammy.”
Castiel’s face filled with concern. “Oh, I’m sorry to hear that,” he offered, looking down at his open book. “Well, the offer still stands, if you’d like to join me. I’ve been told I’m an excellent listener if you need someone to talk to.”
“A few minutes, actually,” Charlie replied, not looking up from her phone. “It’s okay. You seemed…distracted,” she added with a smirk. “Is it cool if I sit with you for the show? It's just about to start.”
“Shh, I’ve got you, Angel,” Dean whispered back, as he worked his hand over Cas’ length, gradually picking up speed. His thumb played at the slit, spreading precome over the head, making it easier for Cas to fuck his fist. He mouthed along Cas’ neck, until his lips latched on to a patch of skin with a sudden possessive desire to leave a mark on Cas’ body.
“Gabriel, believe it or not, I don’t have to explain every detail of my life to you. I said I’ve had a good morning. If and when you need to know anything else, you will,” Castiel argued, backing away and hoping Gabriel wouldn’t comment on the blush in Castiel’s cheeks.
They stood on opposite sides of the pastry counter, sizing each other up for a moment, before a shrill giggle pulled their focus. Dean’s eye found Cas kneeling on the wood floor in front of the register. A little girl stood in front of him; she couldn’t have been older than five. From where they stood, he couldn’t hear what Cas was saying, but it had her laughing hysterically, her brown pigtail braids bouncing off her shoulders and her big brown eyes lit up in joy.
He was almost out the door this morning, throwing some leftovers in abag and filling his thermos with black coffee when he got a panicked text from Ben asking him to come over and drive his mom to the emergency room. Lisa had slipped in the shower and unable to catch herself correctly, landed hard on the side of the tub.
It didn’t help that every rehearsal ended the same, with Castiel in his arms, their bodies wrapped around each other, clinging to the same pole, as the music came to an end. Every day, Dean memorized each dip and slope of Castiel’s body, his eyes drinking in their fill and his hands studying the muscle carved under warm, tan skin.
For the next three hours, the flat landscape soared past them as they cruised down I-35. Castiel watched it go by, replaying the events of the weekend in his mind. He didn’t say much and he was grateful that Charlie had picked up on his need for space, only glancing back at him a few times from the rear view mirror with a barely there sympathetic smile.
“Mornin’ sunshine! You ready to show ‘em what we got?” Dean’s excitement was palpable as he bounced out of the car to open the trunk for Castiel’s duffle bag.
Dean uncrossed his legs and pressed his palm over the taut fabric of his jeans in an effort to control his quickening erection. “Well aren’t you full of surprises?”
They settled on their sides facing one another, letting their legs get tangled up and wrapping their arms around each other. As Dean’s eyes grew heavy, he felt a press against his lips and opened his eyes again to find Cas holding two fingers to his mouth while he mojo’d away their mess. He kissed Castiel’s fingertips and closed his eyes again while his fingers gently combed through the soft feathers, lulling him to sleep.
Dean, quite familiar with that little flutter, squints his eyes and smirks at her. “He’s right behind me, isn’t he?”
“Other people can see you making that face, you know,” Gabriel said, startling Dean from only a few inches away now. How long had that shifty little fucker been standing next to him?
Long after the sun went down, Dean found himself alone in his room, digging through his bag for his phone charger and coming up empty handed. Looking at his phone screen again, he cursed himself for forgetting it. With only eleven percent battery life left, it wouldn’t last much longer.
Castiel’s skill grew exponentially each week. Every time he mastered a new move, his face lit up with enthusiastic pride. The day he mastered his first inversion, he wrapped his arms around Dean and squeezed him tight, before quickly pulling away again. It did funny things to Dean’s insides.
“So, after that, Sammy suggested I come down here with him. It’s always just been the two of us anyway really. So, Sammy went to school and I went to work.”
“If anyone cares about my opinion, I think it’s a good idea,” she declared with a hand on her hip. “A male duo team is pretty rare at these things, so you’ll stand out to the judges. As long as you’re both ready, willing, and able, I’m in to help. You can use the space to practice every night if you want. I’ll even give you a key to lock up when you’re done.”
“Cool,” Charlie said as she put her phone in her pocket and looked up. “You were zoning out pretty hard there with Pam and the guys a minute ago.” Charlie turned her head towards him and lowered her voice. “Just a heads up though, Pam is super hot, but she doesn’t really do the whole dating thing. She’s basically married to this place anyway.”
“I just put together an assortment of pastries from the store that we can eat on the road. I’ve got banana nut muffins for Sam, some chocolate Danish for Jess, and of course some hand pies that you should be able to eat while driving.”
But he didn’t. As much as he wanted to, he kept his distance, staring at each other until a kid running past them made them jump. With the moment officially broken, Dean found he could breathe once again.
Turning his glare back towards Castiel, Dean couldn’t help but ask, “This was Charlie’s idea wasn’t it?”
“Well, welcome,” Castiel answered, gesturing widely toward the rest of the store. “To what do we owe the visit? You looking for anything in particular?”
Castiel stood in the middle of the room in his boxers as the door shut behind Dean, leaving him alone. He knew he was lying to Dean. And to himself. Of course things were complicated. And it wasn’t Dean’s fault. He’d been clear about not wanting any kind of a relationship with anyone. That didn’t keep memories of two years ago from flooding his mind. Ishim had called their entire relationship a mistake before he walked out. And they had been together for years. They were planning a wedding and a life. Hearing Dean repeat those words hurt just as much. That realization terrified him. This was why he had refused to get close to anyone in the last two years. He had successfully built up a wall to protect himself from getting hurt again and Dean had slowly started dismantling it. The problem was that Dean, it seemed, also hid behind his own protective stone wall. Castiel thought back to what Sam had told him the day before. Dean was always waiting for the shoe to drop, to lose the thing he cared about. He was scared.
“He looks at you the way I look at Jess. So, if you like him too, the way I think you do, just be patient with him. Because he’s probably scared shitless.”
Castiel swallowed hard and dropped his gaze back to Dean’s mouth. Emboldened by the alcohol running through his veins, he knocked back the whisky he’d been nursing. Keeping his voice low enough for only Dean to hear, he replied, “As much fun as I’m having here, I do think we should get to bed soon. Wouldn’t you agree?” Castiel hoped Dean picked up on the hint. Fortunately, he did. A minute later they excused themselves from the group, claiming they needed a full night’s rest for the next day.
). Dean and Lisa’s movements told a story as they orbited around each other on the floor and then as they spun together on a shared pole. It was clear that Lisa was meant to be the main focus, with Dean helping to show off his partner. Their training was apparent; they worked together beautifully.
Castiel, being the tease that he was, lowered his body just enough to grind hard and slow against Dean. “Be patient.”
Cas stood over him, his face flushed and his mouth open panting as he worked Dean over. Then Cas brought one of Dean’s legs up to his mouth, and bit down on the inner side of his ankle. Dean screamed out at the sensation and Cas felt him tighten even more around his cock. He knew he wouldn’t last much longer.
The next morning, Dean was already wide awake, having choked down the bitter coffee supplied in his room. He was showered and dressed as he stepped into the elevator and hit the button for the floor above his. He buried the anxiety of today’s events in the back of his mind. He had higher priorities right now. He had to talk to Cas. He had to know they were still okay. He stepped off the elevator and was rounding the corner when he caught sight of Balthazar standing in Cas’ doorway. He froze on the spot, watching Balthazar give Cas a quick hug, before backing away with a nod of his head as Cas quietly shut his door. He turned and walked up the hall toward Dean, who had no means of escape before being seen.
Dean’s only response was to spread his legs to allow Cas to get even closer and to raise his hand in the three finger Scout salute. Seconds later, he lowered his index and ring finger until he was left giving Castiel the middle finger and a shit eating grin. Before he could lower his hand however, Cas grabbed his wrist. Without breaking eye contact, he ducked his head and took Dean’s middle finger into his mouth and sucked hard, slowly releasing him until his teeth grazed over the tip.
He had spoken on the phone a couple of hours ago to a grizzly voiced Bobby Singer, who mumbled something about expecting his call and how Dean already put it in the books and made it a priority for the day. Castiel’s chest fluttered a bit more that was probably necessary at hearing this.
The car was silent, save for the noise Cas made buckling his seat belt. When he looked up, Dean was looking back at him with a soft smile and pink cheeks.
“Ahhh, Dean!” Castiel shouted at the initial contact of the cold, wet silicone, squirming and pulling at the cuffs.
The way Cas looked at him made Dean’s heart jump into his throat. It might have been minutes or hours that they sat there frozen, eyes on each other, with Dean’s thumb still gently smoothing over the soft plushness of Cas’ mouth.
Dean’s self control was definitely being tested. Castiel had a voice made for sex, and here he was moaning in his ear while Dean had his hands on him. He forced his body under control before it could betray him with an inappropriately timed erection.
Dean stepped out of the dark and into the embracing warmth and light of the little coffee shop. He filled his lungs with sweet-scented air and painted on a smile when Alfie greeted him from behind the counter.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about Gabriel,” Castiel replied, rolling his eyes. “And if something happened this weekend, you’d be the last person I’d tell.”
As Dean’s consciousness slipped to that place between sleep and awake, he could feel the warm, plush softness enveloping them, holding them together. Dean felt safer than he ever had before, wrapped in the wings of his angel.
“Ahem,” Sam interrupted, clearing his throat and reaching forward to grab the bag. “Thanks Castiel! This is awesome!” He rummaged around for a moment before pulling out treats for Jess and himself and returning the bag to the front seat.
Cas’ breathing is erratic and his eyes are closed tight as Dean increases speed in his strokes, the friction becoming more and more intoxicating. “Open your eyes, Cas. Look at me,” Dean commands. Cas forces his eyes open, desperately meeting Dean’s, their lips brushing against each other. Cas wraps one hand around Dean’s neck and pulls him in for another kiss while his other hand snakes between them to join Dean’s. Dean’s lips travel down, giving quick kisses along Cas’ jawline. Castiel tilts his head, giving Dean easy access to his neck where Dean rewards him with nips and bites, leaving a trail of red marks. With hands surrounding both cocks together, they are able to thrust up in unison to meet each stroke more effectively. Feeling the pressure build in his lower stomach, Dean pulls his mouth away from Cas. It’s becoming difficult to control his breathing. “I’m not. Gonna. Last. Much longer Cas. I feel like. I’m Gonna Explode. I just. Had to. Get my. Hands on you,” he manages to stammer out. Recognizing his own impending orgasm, Cas pleads, his blue eyes full of desperation. “I’m close, Dean. Please don’t stop. Please,” he whimpers. “Come for me Cas. I want to see you. Come with me, baby,” Dean commands, their hands moving frantically around their joined cocks as they chase their release together. Cas bites down on his bottom lip as his entire body stiffens. “Oh fuck I’m coming! Dean! Ffffuck!” Feeling Cas’ warm release covering his hand, Dean comes hard seconds after, making a mess between them. Their bodies continue to spasm as their hands slowly come to a stop. Neither man makes a move, both foreheads touching, catching their breaths while they come down from their high.
“I was hoping you’d say that. Um, I have a condom in my bag if you want it. I’m clean just so you know, though. I haven’t actually been with anyone else since the accident,” Dean said, looking down at the patterned bedspread.
Castiel gripped the wooden headboard above him. “Dean,” he choked out. “I don’t know how much longer I can last. I feel...I feel like...without my powers I don’t have control over my vessel.”
“Yeah,” Castiel replied. “But, I say we don’t overthink this. We’ve been working really closely together almost everyday for months. Maybe it was bound to happen at some point, you know? And now, we got it out of our systems, so we can get back on focus. No harm, no foul.”
Without warning, Cas screamed out, his head thrown back against Dean’s shoulder as he spilled himself all over Dean’s hand, arching his back even more as he came, rutting even harder against Dean’s painfully hard dick. Dean held him tight and peppered his neck with kisses while he continued to spasm, until his entire body sagged against Dean’s chest.
“I didn’t mean to take advantage of you. I take responsibility for Saturday night, what I said the next morning was wrong. I didn’t mean it when I said it was a mistake. But I was scared. Scared that I was getting too comfortable and letting you get too close. Because when anything good comes my way, I find a way to fuck it up. And you’ve become one of my best friends in all this, and I don’t want to lose that. So I pushed you away. Now, I just realize I was an asshole.”
Dean had been coming into the Last Drop for the better part of six years and never ordered anything different. Alfie always asked anyway.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Dean argued, quickly shifting his face into a neutral expression, but unable to hide the traitorous flush in his cheeks from being caught staring.
“I can’t believe you’re making me listen to this song again. In my car. After we got each other off in the back seat like teenagers,” Dean complained. Although, the fire behind that complaint was masked by the happy, satisfied sigh that followed it. Cas often compared him to a grumpy sleepy kitten and Dean couldn’t find himself to be mad about it.
Today was no exception. Castiel said his normal hello's and good mornings to Kevin, a college student who worked part-time manning the register and helping with inventory when he wasn’t in class. As per usual, he went straight back to the cafe, where his brother always had his favorite double shot latte, sweetened and flavored with vanilla and cinnamon ready for him.
They finally looked away from each other when the officiant spoke. While Charlie recited her vows, Castiel glanced at Dean when he reached up to wipe away a rogue tear from his cheek and lay his hand back in his lap. He felt a little guilty, but he ended up paying more attention to watching Dean than to the actual ceremony in front of him.
“Hell, no, little bro! Bout time the Tin Man got back out there to get himself a heart, among other important organs if you catch my drift.” Castiel rolled his eyes and Gabriel laughed, popping the candy back into his mouth and left Castiel alone to work.
He made Dean laugh. Castiel could feel his brain filing this memory away as one of the proudest moments of his life. He briefly wondered how quickly he could pull his phone out to record it. In slow motion. He studied Dean with wide eyes before he started giggling as well; Dean’s laugh was contagious.
Dean looked up when he felt Cas nudge the side of his leg with his bare foot. Cas stood over him, looking down with a smirk.
“Pull your knees up for me angel. Let me see that pretty ass on display,” Dean commanded. Without hesitation, Cas worked his legs up underneath him while keeping his head down on the pillow.
Dean took another ice cube into his mouth and deposited his glass on the side table. Standing at the foot of the bed, he grabbed Cas by the ankles and pulled forcefully, leaving Cas gasping and completely stretched out on the bed. Dean bit down on his bottom lip and took a steadying breath when he noticed his manhandling had caused the head of Cas’s swollen cock to peek out through the top of his blue panties.
Dean and Castiel watched as Charlie and Pam made their way back to the front, the heavy curtain closing with a swoosh. There was no mistaking that they were still listening on the other side.
Charlie stood on the other side of the counter watching him with a blank expression on her face. But because she’s still Charlie and Dean’s best friend, she fixed his coffee for him just the way he prefers and set it in front of him, before pinning him with a stare that suggested he better pay attention.
“We...I- something might have happened a couple of months ago. One night at the studio. Please don’t tell Pam. It wasn’t a big deal. And we agreed that it was a one time thing and we were cool. And we were. Until this weekend. And I knew it was a bad idea for us to share a room. I knew that. I should have gotten my own room. I should have kept my hands to myself, but I didn’t because I’m a dumbass with a crush.”
“First of all, Cassie, please stop with the air quotes. I’ve told you, for what seems like a million times, it's unnecessary. Not to mention weird,” Anna spat. “Second, I asked you to come with me because you need a night out. You're at that bookstore all day with no one to talk to except Gabriel. After you're done you go home, eat dinner alone, and read until you fall asleep. It’s about time you change it up a little.” “Also,” she added after a beat, “that was a very sexist remark about the pole studio being a girl’s night out activity. So, please, for just one night, relax a bit and have fun.”
Cas swirled his tongue around the overly sensitive nub before looking up. “I’ll have to remember that,” mumbled with a smirk. He moved down Dean’s body, placing kisses over his rib cage, dipping his tongue into his navel, and nipping at his hips. He tugged Dean’s black shorts down, tucking the front of them under his balls.
The man smirked confidently back at Dean, clearly appraising him from head to toe. “Yes, Castiel here was telling me it’s your first time making it to the big stage. I was just suggesting you and he come out with me tonight. The other dancers always reserve a space somewhere for a party to blow off steam. Should be a good time. You should join us,” he said with an oily British accent.
Dean wrapped his free arm around Cas’ waist to keep him as close as possible while he worked to get Cas off. His legs hugged Cas’ sides tight as Cas gently rocked his ass back and forth against Dean’s cock with the deliciously right amount of pressure.
It didn’t hurt that Dean was an extremely flirty drunk. He kept finding reasons to touch him. Like reaching up to tug on his hair when he teased about how unruly it was. He brushed his thumb over Cas’ chin and with a wink suggested he not shave before the competition because the scruff was sexy. Before long, their faces were barely inches apart, giggling over stupid jokes and paying no attention to their friends. Castiel really did his best to look Dean in the eye and not at his tempting mouth. He must not have been doing a very good job. Eventually, Dean leaned over, lips ghosting over the shell of his ear to whisper.
After a few seconds, that curtain was pulled open with a flourish by a petite but energetic redhead in a Star Wars T-shirt, jeans and red Converse.
“Fuck, fuck, fuck!. Cas! Cas touch me! I need your hands on me! Please, baby, make me come,” Dean begged.
“You realize you’re Jennifer Grey in this situation. Which of course makes me Patrick Swayze,” he replied proudly.
There’s a pause before Sam continues, “Hey we haven’t heard from Cas in a couple days. Why don’t we call him and see if he wants to meet us at the diner.” Dean fights to control his laughter and buries his face into Cas’ neck. After Cas nods his head, Dean answers, “Yeah, that is a great idea Sammy. I’ll give him a call as soon as I get out, okay?” There’s another pause before, “It’s cool, I’ll just call him right now.” “Wait, Sa-“ Before Dean could finish his protest, the familiar ring of Cas’ cell phone fills the bathroom from inside his coat pocket. Dean and Cas stand frozen as the ringtone comes to a stop. From outside the bathroom, they hear, “Um, Cas? Are you in there?” “Good morning, Sam,” Cas answers from inside the shower.  Dean shrugs his shoulders and grins at his angel, refusing to let his brother ruin his post sex euphoria. Multiple orgasms are worth having to deal with Sam’s bitch face.
Something in the back of Dean’s mind whispered that sitting here staring at Cas all night wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing. But the guy did offer to listen to his problems. He took a deep breath and let out an obnoxiously loud sigh.
“Sorry, dude. Didn't mean to startle you,” Dean offered with a smile. “Um, I was wondering if Cas was here. I kinda need to talk to him about something.”
It was the truth. He loved Cas. He couldn’t pinpoint exactly when it happened. More like it was such a gradual, organic thing that sprouted and grew and lived inside him now.
Bobby would probably give him shit tomorrow for offering free work, but he didn’t care. Not when Castiel stared at the card between his fingers before looking back up at Dean with a big gummy smile.
“Well, you are in luck, my friend,” Dean said, already pulling a card out of his wallet. “Take this, call that number in the morning if she still won’t start, and we’ll come get it,” he continued, handing the business card to Castiel. “That’s my shop. Well, technically it’s Bobby Singer’s, hence the Singer Garage, but if you call in the morning and tell Bobby you’re a friend of mine, Anna will get a pretty good deal on whatever needs to be fixed. Or,” Dean swallowed loudly, “that’s my cell number at the bottom if you prefer to just text me instead and I’ll take care of it.”
Looking around, he had to admit that Anna was right. It wasn’t just a girl’s night out event. There were a few other men here tonight. Most of them were scattered along the wall, having quiet conversations with those around them. Castiel couldn’t help but notice two men standing near the “privacy” door talking with a barefoot woman with wild jet black hair, black yoga pants, and what was at some point an intact vintage ACDC t-shirt. Now it was sleeveless, low-cut, and cropped. One of the two men towered over his companions. He was dressed in normal street clothes and sipped red wine, occasionally bringing a hand up to bring a strand of his long hair back behind his ears.
“Oh fuck Cas! Cas, please don’t stop! Please, please, please,” Dean begged incoherently. “Oh fuck, I’m coming, Cas! Please don’t stop!” Dean screamed as his orgasm shot through him, hot ropes landing on his chest, one after the other, until he was completely spent.
There was a lull in the conversation. But it wasn’t awkward. With the way their eyes traveled, stopping to memorize the shape of Dean’s bottom lip, or the dip of Castiel’s clavicle where it peaked out from under his button-up, it seemed like words were being spoken without having to say them out loud.
“Cas. I….,” was all Dean could manage. His hungry eyes swept along every inch of Cas’ body on display in front of him. His breath caught in his throat when his green eyes met blue. As Dean continued to stare at his angel, his eyes softened and a soft smile spread across his lips. “I love them, Cas. They’re beautiful.” Dean took a deep breath to settle his pulse. Wow, Dean thought to himself. This relationship really was changing him.
He did it. His chest still heaving to catch his breath, he took a quick bow in the center of the stage and nodded to the judges table in front of him. He wouldn’t know the results for a few hours, but he knew he had nailed his routine.  He felt like a million bucks listening to the crowd cheer for him, easily piecing out the voices of his family.
Dean felt himself flush from the praise. He ducked his head down and wiped his hands over his face in embarrassment. “I don’t know if I’d call it that.”
He had one foot on the pavement when his phone buzzed and looking at it he realized he’d missed a few texts from Charlie.
As they came down the aisle, Dean’s eye caught his. His big proud smile transformed into something different. Something softer. Something only meant for Castiel. He winked at Castiel as they passed the front row. Once they reached Dorothy and the officiant, Dean kissed Charlie on her cheek and squeezed her hand before turning to find his seat next to Castiel. He let out a deep breath and gave Cas a lopsided smile.
“Oh, hey Lisa. I didn’t know you were coming today. Yeah, here you go,” Castiel replied, handing her a bottle before reaching back in for another.
It had been a long time since Dean had called in sick. Years, in fact. Yes, he felt guilty for leaving Bobby short for the day, even though he knew they didn’t have a lot on the books. But damn it he’d surely earned one day to play hooky. Bobby agreed and told him to get back to bed and enjoy his time off, and that he wanted to hear details about the weekend in Dallas when he got in the next day. Dean only grunted his thanks and rolled back over, pulling the sheets up over his head to block out the unwelcome light.
“Ah, fuck!” Dean screamed, his head thrown back in a swirl of pleasure and just the right amount of pain. “Oh, god, that’s it, Angel. Fuck me just like that!”
“Um, guys? I’m still here,” the bar tender interrupts. “Sorry to break this up, but I think I’m gonna close up early since no one else is here.”
“Castiel, ” the bar tender echoes  with a kind smile. “That’s an interesting name. Tell me more about Castiel.” She suspects Dean has plenty to say about his angel. She can tell.
Without warning, Dean grabs Castiel’s blue tie and tugs, dragging Castiel into the shower. Dean’s mouth finds Castiel’s, while his hands pull at the hem of his white dress shirt, already getting soaked through. “We don’t have long, Cas. And we can’t be too loud. Sam’s just outside,” Dean warns between kisses, pulling the tie loose and bringing it over Cas’ head. He drops it and hurriedly starts unbuttoning the shirt. After it hits the tub floor with a splash, Dean makes quick work of Cas’ belt buckle. Dean lowers to his knees to peel Cas’ dress pants and underwear off his tanned skin. Castiel stands over him, naked and waiting, while Dean looks up at his angel. Watching the hot water hit Cas’ shoulders, each drop making its own path down his lean torso, Dean is momentarily hypnotized.
“Just because it hasn’t happened doesn’t mean I’m not prepared for it just in case, Cas,” Dean said with a smirk.
. Of course, it had only been about half an hour since he last checked. But no one needed to know that.
Dean came to stand in front of Castiel. With so much exposed skin before him, Castiel could feel his mind wiping out any sensible explanation for his presence, much like he feared. It was Charlie clearing her throat obnoxiously that brought him back. He looked to her where she nodded encouragingly. Instead of stalling and beating around the bush, perhaps it was just best to rip off the bandaid and see what happened.
Smiling, Cas held his plate out for Dean to scoop a spoonful of vanilla ice cream. In return, he offered his pie to Cas, knowing there were only so many people in this world he’d share a slice of apple pie with. Cas was probably at the top of that short list.
Dean had practiced in his head what he would say to Cas when he found him, but now the words escaped him. He was frozen looking back, his mouth hanging open and blinking rapidly like an idiot. He took a deep breath and hoped for the best.
Castiel looked up at Dean but didn’t say a word. They had barely spoken since that morning. Whatever words they shared had been short and concise. Dean didn’t look at him. Focusing on the ground, Dean spoke quietly.
Dean turned his back to him, swaying his ass from side to side. He turned around, sliding the red sash around his slim waist until it came off in his hand. Slowly, he walked toward Castiel and wrapped the soft fabric around his neck. Grinning like the lovestruck fool he was, Castiel was already hard in his pajama pants when Dean blew him a kiss and popped the Santa hat on top of his head. It was silly and sexy and perfect. Dean backed away, letting the velvet jacket slip off his bare shoulders and tossing it to the side. He stepped up to the shiny new pole in the corner and reached high to grip and pull himself into an inversion, his bowlegs forming a “v” above his head. From there Dean did a few simple spins, before sliding down to the hardwood floor. He crawled forward, looking up at Castiel through thick lashes. Once he reached his target, he gripped Castiel by his thighs to help pull him back to his feet. Standing over him, he tucked his thumbs into the hem of his pants. Dean pulled them down slowly, revealing a pair of deliciously red satin panties with lace trim and a tiny white bow. Silver cursive lettering covered the front that said “Open Me”.
Gabriel took one look at him and -holding his coffee hostage- narrowed his eyes. "Spill. What’s got you buzzing in here like a bumblebee in paradise?” Gabriel’s wide smile and bouncing eyebrows already had Castiel rolling his eyes.
“Pam took off with a few instructors she knows. And Charlie texted me to let us know she and Dorothy just got here. She was wondering if you wanted to join them for dinner. Apparently there’s a really good burger place down the street from here. You hungry?”
Once outside, Dean and Cas walk side by side toward the Implala, parked a few blocks down the street. The street is dark and deserted at this hour. Neither one speaks as they each steal glances toward the other, each look filled with meaning only they understand. They’ve shared these silent exchanges so many times, words are no longer necessary.
“Well, I’m definitely gonna look around, but I mostly just wanted to come and say thank you. I don’t know exactly what you said to Dean last night, but the Dean I saw sitting in his car looking like he was two seconds away from bursting into tears and the Dean who came into the studio an hour later were two different Deans. It’s been a while since I saw him practice with that much...determination. I mean he walked in with his chest kinda puffed out and this...spark in his eyes that I really didn’t expect considering the circumstances with Lisa. So, whatever you did or said last night at the coffee shop, I thank you.”
The bedroom door clicked shut and Cas turned to see Dean walking to his dresser, sipping from a rocks glass. Dean watched him, his eyes hungry as he mouthed a piece of ice, working it over with his tongue.
Cas smiled against Dean’s bare chest at the reminder of their first rehearsal together. “Yes, I do. As it happens, I can relate. I do believe I’ve had the time of my life since meeting you,” Castiel said, looking up. “I can’t believe it’s already been a year and a half since this crazy idea got started.”
He barely noticed the little bell above the door as it opened and brought in a chill. But a moment later, they were greeted by Anna as she bounced in with a smile and landed at their table, in sweats and clutching a canvas tote bag.
“Perfect! Thanks, Cassie!” Anna started rifling through her purse, likely looking for her notebook and a pen to prepare for her impromptu interview.
Dean’s mug was almost to his lips for his first sip of caffeine when he froze. He set the mug back down with a thunk.
When the song came to an end, the crowd whooped and cheered. Dean and Lisa gave an appreciative little bow together. As Lisa started walking off, Dean’s eyes searched the crowd before landing on Castiel. Dean’s mouth barely hinted at a smile as he held his gaze and absentmindedly (
“Good. Now that we have all that out of the way,” Charlie paused, bouncing her eyebrows excitedly. “How was it? Like I said, I don’t need all the dirty details, but it is a big deal and I’m excited for you.”
The golden California sunset found Dean with his ass in the sand feeling better than he had in years. Even though he wouldn’t be bringing home any prize money from the solo category, he knew third place was still something to be proud of, so he couldn’t find himself to be too upset. Everyone he cared about was here with him, enjoying the day. After the day’s results were announced, they all left the hotel and spent a few hours exploring the San Diego Zoo. Dean laughed to himself, remembering Cas running up to him in the gift shop holding up a T-shirt with two cartoon koalas clinging to a tree branch together, insisting they each get one. Dean had rolled his eyes in false irritation at the cheesy souvenir, before pulling out his wallet and paying for them both. A shriek caused him to look up to find Charlie and Jess ganging up on Cas and dunking him under the waves. Cas came up spitting out salt water and shaking his head before chasing them through the surf.
Upon hearing that, Castiel leaned forward on his elbows, pursed his lips and arched his right eyebrow. “Let me be the judge of that,” he urged gently.
Dean only had a second to glare at him. They were still wrapped around each other on the static pole. He couldn’t help but burst into laughter. He felt euphoric. Their routine had been flawless. They had even nailed the lift.
With a lop-sided grin, Dean leaned forward, flattened his tongue and gave a long, slow lick along the underside of his shaft. He swiped his tongue back and forth over the tip and closed his lips around it, sucking gently.
“I’m sorry Dean. I didn’t mean to slow us down tonight,” Cas answered in between deep breaths and gravelly moans.
“You want the Cliff’s Notes of it? I had no idea such an awkward dude with no natural rhythm could turn into a feral sex god in the sack. I mean, it was just supposed to be quick drunk fuck, not the best fucking sex of my life.”
“Well, that’s too bad. But as amusing as that is to imagine, I’m sure you’ll be just as lovely escorting Ms. Bradbury down the aisle.”
Dean’s trance is broken when he feels Castiel’s hand on his shoulder, covering the same skin where Cas first touched him in Hell those years ago. Cas pulls Dean to his feet and pushes him flat against the tile. Hands roam over bare skin. Mouths meet again, lips parting to allow tongues to taste and explore. Castiel rolls his hips, his hard cock brushing Dean’s, causing a quieted moan out of each of them. “I want to try something, Dean,” Cas whispers between kisses. “Whatever you want Cas, it’s yours,” Dean replies breathlessly.
Castiel looked down at him, feeling something he didn’t want to give a name to. “So, no condom then? It’ll be messier that way, you know,” he suggested with a lop-sided smile.
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean growled against his ear. “Do you have any idea how bad I want you? Do you have any idea what you do to me? How many times I’ve laid in bed at night thinking about touching you like this? How many times I’ve come thinking about you?”
“Um, I figured we were probably done with practice for tonight. I hope you don’t mind,” Cas said, looking down at his feet.
“Since I saw you three days ago,” Charlie giggled, coming around the front desk to stand in front of him. “Great, actually! I used that Carrie Fisher book I got from you to devise a scavenger hunt for my girlfriend, Dorothy. The whole thing ended with me proposing and her saying yes! So...I’m engaged!”
“Charlie, tell me this idea isn’t completely crazy,” Dean asked, staring out of the windows to the dark parking lot.
Dean also realized he was enjoying his time at the studio more than he usually did. He was sleeping well every night, falling into bed physically exhausted but feeling more and more satisfied with their progress. Even Bobby had mentioned how “chipper” he was at the shop.
“Yeah, well. Maybe that’s because he wouldn’t stop talking about you,” she said with an arched brow and a grin before walking away to join their friends around Bobby’s fire pit.
Twenty minutes later he stepped back out to the main floor of the ballroom back in his jeans and black t-shirt adorned with the Lazarus Rising logo across his chest. The competition schedule allowed for multiple breaks in the programming, so most of the crowd was out in the hall or loitering in the ballroom talking with others. Dean scanned over the area where their group has been sitting, only finding Bobby and Ellen still in their seats, studying the paper program together. Not wanting to interrupt them, he turned for the door, figuring he’d find more of his people outside in the vendor’s area. Castiel was by the door, unaware that Dean was frozen where he stood. An attractive blonde man that Dean recognized from backstage currently had his hand on Cas’ shoulder. From where he stood, he watched as Cas smiled back at his new acquaintance and ducked his head, his face pink with blush. Something deep inside Dean’s chest burned and he forced himself to unclench his fists.
Once again, I want to thank everyone who have been supporting me and encouraging me to get this done.
“Thanks,” Dean said, smiling back at him. “And don’t forget to call the shop tomorrow about Anna’s car. Or if you have any questions about it, just text me,” Dean continued, surprised by his own eagerness to hear from Cas again. It had been quite a long time since he had an actual crush on anyone but he could still remember what it felt like.s.
“So...angels.  What are they like? Harps? Halos? Words of wisdom and guidance,” she inquires. Dean huffs as he swirls his glass and tosses back the amber liquor all at once. “Well, sorry to break it to you, sweetheart, but they’re mostly dicks.” The bar tender stares at Dean with a questioning look on her face, unsure of how to respond. A few seconds later, “Dicks. That’s all you’ve got to say on the subject? Angels are dicks.” Not breaking eye contact, Dean slowly slides his empty glass towards her. As she pours him a double this time, he answers her. “I know that’s not what you want to hear, but it’s the truth. Most of them are either power hungry egomaniacs trying to take over the universe or obedient soldiers who never question their mission, no matter how many people get hurt along the way.” The bar tender stares at Dean with guilt in her eyes. The tone of their conversation has taken a nose dive and Dean looks depressed all of a sudden.
“Cassie! Oh my god, that was the funnest class ever! Pam is such a cool teacher, and I even landed a couple of tricks already! Good workout too. I know I’ll be sore tomorrow, but it’s so worth it. You ready to go? Remember we have to go get my car in the morning.”
Dean’s eyes widened as he held on for dear life as Cas fucked him hard and fast. His fingers wrapped around Dean’s cock where it bounced on his belly, rock hard, and jerked him at a pace that matched his thrusts.
“Yeah,” Dean said, clearing his throat. “Yeah, you’re...you’re right. That’s what’s important.” Dean’s hands fidgeted by his sides, restless for some reason. He ducked his head down, unable to look Cas in the eye anymore. “Thanks Cas.” He looked around behind him awkwardly. “I guess I should go and let you get back to work. I’ll see you in practice.”
“Sure, whatever. Look, I’m all for this whole dance thing if that’s what you came in here for. Cassie needed something to light a fire under his ass. But if anything else is going on,” he said, tilting his head down a bit, but maintaining eye contact. “Just be careful with him. He’s been hurt before. He’s been lead on and lied to, and it really messed him up. He built up walls around him to keep from getting close to people. So, if you have any other intentions, other than dancing together, which I’m guessing you might from the heart eyes I just saw, just be careful with him. Oh! And if you hurt him, I’ll kill you.”
Once Castiel was completely free to move around, Dean helped him sit up. He quickly shook his wings out to smooth a few of the impressive iridescent feathers from where he’d been laying on them.
“After Dean finally woke up, of course he blamed himself for the whole thing. He thinks his life is cursed or something. Every time he gets close to having something good, it gets taken away. We lost our mom when we were kids. Dean had to take care of me after that since Dad kinda checked out. So he never got to be a kid. He’s used to losing things he cares about. So, I’m begging you, Castiel. Don’t be something else he has to lose.”
“Hello, Dean.” Dean’s eyes pop open. He barely heard Cas’ low voice over the sound of the shower. Dean pulls the shower curtain back before remembering he is naked, covered in bubbles with an errection now at full attention. Castiel is standing just outside the shower, fully dressed, trench coat and all. His lips part and his eyes move down Dean’s body. His gaze lingers a bit before slowy making its way back up to make eye contact with Dean. “Cas, what are you doing here? I thought you said it was a bad idea for you to be here,” Dean whispers, aware that his baby brother is still sitting on the other side of the bathroom door. “Last night, it was a bad idea. But I told you I would see you soon, Dean,” Cas answers in a hushed raspy voice, his mouth forming a lop-sided grin. His curiousity peaked, Dean asks “So what did you end up doing last night after you disappeared on me?” Castiel’s eyes move down again when he answers, “Research.” He shrugs the trench coat off his shoulders, letting it fall behind him. Despite the hot water, a shiver runs down Dean’s body. That familiar electric charge fills the space around them. “Research? What kind of research, Cas?” Dean asks quietly, bringing his hand back up to continue stroking himself, teasing Cas. “Different ways to love you Dean. Physically,” Cas says straightfaced. Dean swallows hard. “Cas, by research, do you mean…porn? Did you spend all night watching porn?” Cas simply nods and kicks off his dress shoes, followed by his socks. Dean blows out the breath he had been holding and closes his eyes. “Fuck,” Dean utters.
“Hello Dean. I guess I’m as ready as I’ll ever be.” Castiel leaned down into the open window. “Good morning Sam. Jess,” he answered, giving a little awkward wave to the couple in the back seat. He slid onto the leather seat and set down a small paper gift bag from his store next to him. When Dean took his place in the driver’s seat he looked over curiously at the bag.
“Um, hello. I have eyes,” she answered pointing to her own face. “You started texting me for info as soon as I sat next to him at the showcase. The crush is nothing new. I’m talking about what happened after the sex. Your little pillow talk confession where you told him it would be easy to fall for him, followed by your big panic the next morning where you called the entire thing a big mistake, and basically giving him the silent treatment for the rest of the weekend. Kind of a dick move. Especially considering all the shit his ex put him through.”
Dean lifted his hips where he lay and shimmied out of his pants and boxers, leaving them both completely bare to each other.
“Move, will ya? I’ve got to wipe this floor down or I’ll never be able to look at Pam again. Her eyes would probably burn right out of her head if she found cum on the floor. When she gave you that key, she told us to behave ourselves and I’m pretty sure this is the exact opposite of what she meant,” he said with a giggle. That’s when Dean noticed the rag in his hand that reeked of Clorox.
“I must warn you, he doesn’t seem to be much of a morning person.” Balthazar pushed the call button for the elevator, which opened for him almost immediately.  “Although he was quite good company last night. Quite an interesting one, that Mr. Novak,” he said with a smirk. “Good luck today, Dean,” he added, stepping onto the elevator.
“Oh nothing. Just wondering if you’re gonna be able to help me pay for my insulin shots when I eventually get diabetes from you guys,” she teased.
Wide eyed, Castiel lifted his head to stare at the gleaming solid piece while Dean reached around himself to twist and turn the plug in his ass, still slick with lube. “Dean. Wha-. I. Oh,” Castiel uttered.
Castiel chewed on his bottom lip, and nodded at him. The coldness in his eyes melted away a little bit.
After dropping Anna off and waiting with her while the tow truck carried off her car, he sent a simple text to Dean’s number thanking him for his help. Castiel chewed his bottom lip and tossed his phone on the desk, scoffing internally at himself for acting like a teenager with a silly crush. It wasn’t like he really expected Dean to reply back immediately, especially if he was at work. He finished his latte while quickly checking the store’s email account, before returning to the front to help Kevin with the shipment of new paperbacks they received yesterday.
Dean opened his mouth but couldn’t find any words. Castiel didn’t want him. Even though what he was saying was reasonable, logical even, the sting of rejection hurt nonetheless. And now he felt like a fool.
One night in March, much like every other night, they had the space to themselves. Pam and Charlie usually took off while they were still working and let Dean lock up when they were done. Much like their first night, they had dimmed the lights and turned up the music.
“Stay as long as you want. You know how this place works. Lock up when you’re done. Behave yourselves. Lose this key and I’ll kill you. Any questions?”
A few minutes later, the door swung open and a gust of wind blew through the front room. Castiel walked in right on time, his dark hair a mess and bulky trench coat pulled open from the wind, making him look wild and disheveled. Dean quickly schooled his face so he wasn’t caught gawking at the guy. He couldn’t help but notice how nervous Cas looked, his movements stilted and jittery as he approached them at the front desk, slinging a duffle bag over his shoulder. He also noticed that Cas was still dressed in his work clothes. His crisp white shirt was still tucked neatly into fitted dress pants, which hugged his body just right, suggesting that Cas was all muscle underneath. The only thing out of place was the blue tie, already pulled loose from his neck and laying wrong side up. Dean ran his eyes down Cas’ body and immediately felt like a perv for imagining what he looked like without all those layers. Some part of his brain obviously wasn’t working because his fingers itched to reach up and fix Cas’ tie until it laid flat against his chest. Luckily, he kept his hands to himself.
“Dean, that’s... so... generous of you. Thank you, I know Anna will be relieved as well,” Castiel said, carefully tucking the business card in his shirt pocket. He let out a deep breath and sat back in his chair. “What about you? How have you been? Are you heading next door or would you like to sit and join me for a bit?,” he offered, gesturing to the chair in front of him.
“Anna is short for Anael. We were all named for angels,” Castiel replied, pausing for a moment before explaining. “Our parents were very religious.”
There were a few friendly whistles and catcalls coming from the couple he now knew were Dean’s family. Dean shook his head as he waited for the music to start, keeping his eyes cast downward, but smiling almost shyly at the attention.
That night found them all scrunched together in a large booth at a bar a few blocks from the hotel. A few greasy appetizers were being shared and the beer flowed easily. Castiel could barely move where he sat squished between Dean and the wall, but he couldn’t find himself to care. It had been years since he could remember having this much fun with friends. He and Ishim certainly had never had nights out like this.
“You know, it really pisses me off to hear you say things like about yourself. I mean, I get that it's scary to put yourself out there like that. But, Dean. You're the best person I know. You’re strong. You’re a fighter.  You’ve always put others ahead of your own happiness, and now you’ve got it basically right in front of you, but you won’t try and fight for it. I honestly think you might be surprised what happens if you actually talk to him about how you feel.”
The fucker not only swallowed again, but he did it over and over again, milking Dean’s cock until the dam burst and Dean was spilling down his throat. He tried pulling Cas off as soon as it started, but Castiel gripped his hips and kept his mouth sealed over Dean's cock, swallowing everything. His vision whited out and his entire body seized up. He could feel fireworks in his toes, and he thought for a quick second, this might be the thing that finally kills him. But what a way to go.
“I’m not quite a hundred percent yet, but I’m starting back slow with training. Maybe I’ll be able to come with you guys for next year’s regionals.”
“Oh my god, you own Angel’s Books? I love that place! You’ve got a great YA section, and that guy running the cafe who thinks he’s really funny makes one hell of a honey latte,” she said with a smile.
“Is that so?” Dean began lazily rocking back and forth on Castiel’s lap. Smiling, he leaned down to pepper Cas with kisses. “Well, in that case, do you have any plans for tomorrow night,” he asked, playfully nibbling on Cas’s bottom lip.
Cas settled on his belly down between Dean’s legs like he was sitting down to dinner. Over the next hour, he drove Dean further and further to the point of madness. In reality it may have only been a few minutes, but Dean had turned into a whimpering mess in front of him and he really couldn’t be sure he hadn’t died at some point and this was his Heaven.
“Alright then boys, you have fun tonight. And good luck tomorrow, hmm,” Balthazar said, backing away to go join his people out in the hallway.
“Thanks. Anyway, uh, when Sammy graduated high school, he ended up with a full ride to the University of Texas down here. He was always the brains of the family, so I wasn’t surprised. He had planned to come down here by himself. But one night, Dad and I got into a huge fight when I told him I was bisexual. He said a lot of not very nice things. That 'no son of mine would live like that' kinda bullshit.” He paused and looked up briefly at Castiel only to be met with the sad version of Puppy Eyes. He cleared his throat, “Sorry, that got kinda heavy for a second,” Dean said looking away with an awkward chuckle. His eyes snapped up as Castiel leaned forward and touched Dean's hand, sending tingles up and down his arm and creating what appeared to be a butterfly rave in his stomach.
“Yeah. Yeah, I remember,” Dean said softly, walking over to stand next to the little table Castiel was occupying. “What are you doing here?” he asked, attempting to hide his sudden nervousness.
“Well, you look like you’re healing up well. I’ve seen you come into the studio a few times already. All back to normal?”
Dean takes a sip from his glass, a lop-sided grin still on his face. The bar tender eyes him perceptively. “Family? Wow. So you guys have gotten really close, then?”
“Cas,” Dean whispered. He ran his hands over Cas’s back and held his hips still. “It’s time for you to roll over, angel. Straighten your legs back down for me.”
That uncomfortable feeling in his chest disappeared completely. “Okay Cas. Just checking. Don’t you worry, then, I’ll make sure you see the giraffes and the Pacific sunset.”
With an offer like that, Castiel kissed him hard, gripped him under his thighs, stood them up together, and carried his husband to their bed to continue unwrapping his gift.
Castiel looked up at his brother, expecting to find him teasing, but instead was met with sympathetic eyes.
Castiel watched through his passenger side window as Anna’s car navigated through the trendy East side of Austin, knowing too well that he wasn't cool enough for this neighborhood. It was a nice clear night to be out anyway; the air cold and fresh, but not too chilly. Despite only being one week into the new year, he hoped it meant a mild winter.
“And I was informing him that we already had plans for the rest of the afternoon,” Cas interjected with a nod towards Dean.
Pam dropped where she was and crossed her legs in front of her. Dean and Castiel copied her. Dean already knew all the ins and outs of the competition weekend, but he listened anyway.
Dean smiled and swirled the toy around Cas’ rim a few times, smearing the lube in its path. “Do you want more,” Dean asked, as he peppered Cas’s ass with feather light kisses.
enthusiastic woman named Becky, Dean took a moment to peek into the ballroom. The massive space was set up with a stage on one end and filled with rows of chairs, which began with a long table clearly meant for the judges. Dean took a deep breath as butterflies fluttered around in his stomach. They were finally here.
“Dean, you know the only thing that can restrain me properly are the Enochian handcuffs. Do you have any idea where they are? I took the liberty of searching the weapons room, and even in the Impala’s trunk, but I couldn’t locate them.”
The small part of his brain that was still functioning properly was aware of the flickering light and the slight shift in the air around them. It wasn’t until a minute later when he lifted his head and forced his eyes open that he realized what had caused it. Castiel remained underneath him, solid as ever, hands still tied to the bed, and body seized up from overstimulation due to the plug which still buzzed inside him. He stared up at Dean with wide, scared eyes. Because underneath Castiel were two massive pearly black wings spanning six feet out in either direction.
“So, the regional level is in Dallas this year on the first weekend in June. That gives us just four and half months to get you ready.” Pam’s mouth was pulled tight. “Most dancers practice for a couple of years before competing. So we’ve got our work cut out for us. There’s a list of rules and regulations. Castiel, I’ll give you a copy before you leave tonight so you can go over it. The short version is this. Each routine may be no longer than three minutes. The stage is set up with two poles, one spinning pole and the other locked as a static pole. Both must be utilized during your routine as well as floor moves. There are four judges scoring on quality of execution, difficulty of moves and combinations, stage presence and uniqueness of the performance. Now I’ve been doing this for a very long time. So I know how rare it is for a doubles team with two men. I think this is where we can have the advantage. We can make you stand out to the judges and make it impossible to forget you. Like I said the other day, I’ll give Dean a key so you two can practice after classes are done for the day. I recommend taking at least two days off a week to let yourself rest. Other than that, I’ll let you two figure out a schedule that works for you. Just keep me updated, okay?”
This was met with enthusiastic cheers from the small audience. Pam waited for a beat and then continued.
“Wha- how? I- he-“ Dean stumbled and then pouted as Charlie just laughed at him. She shooed him towards the door and Dean took the dignity he had left and walked away, cheeks flaming and mumbling under his breath about tricky redhead masterminds.
“Uh, Yeah. I think I saw you guys in there,” Castiel replied nonchalantly. “I was on my way in for practice. I don’t know what you were talking about but Dean looked really excited about something.”
Several hours later, Dean stood under the spray of an almost scalding shower, letting the water pressure ease the muscles in his back after such a long day. Dinner had been a fun evening. A fun, confusing evening. Dean and Cas sat on one side of a large booth, while Charlie and Dorothy sat across them, recounting their honeymoon week. Comic Con had been a wild time apparently, resulting in matching Princess Leia tattoos for the couple. Dean simply leaned back, full and content, listening to details of their road trip and looking through Charlie’s camera roll. Picture after picture of them wearing matching ears at Disneyland, posing in front of the Golden Gate bridge, and standing over a sprawling view of a Sonoma vineyard.
“If my powers weren’t held back by the Enochian handcuffs, I could use my grace on you during sex,” Castiel rumbled, his voice rough and strained. “I haven’t yet because giving you pleasure is too enjoyable to rush through it with my powers. But I could bring you to orgasm without even laying a hand on you. Of course, there isn’t a universe in existence where I wouldn’t want to touch you. I could keep you hard for as long as I wanted and deny you release. I could make you come over and over and over again until you were the one begging me to stop.”
“Good.” Dean reached up to run his palm over the bulge in Cas’ jeans. “I’d rather feel you. All of you,” Dean answered, his voice rougher than it was only a moment ago. He popped open the button and slowly lowered the zipper down, running his tongue over his bottom lip. He looked back up at Cas before reaching inside his boxers, pulling him out, and skimming his thumb over the head.
Dean thought about it. Castiel didn’t even know him. Why would he care to hear about Dean’s problems? He looked back to the counter where his coffee and Charlie’s sugary concoction waited for him. She’d probably bitch about it not being hot anymore.
Clearing his throat, Castiel picked his bag up and gestured toward Charlie’s Beetle. “Hey Charlie, why don’t I ride back with you guys this time?”
Finally inside his office-closet, he closed the door, hung up his old trench coat, and flopped into his squeaky desk chair. Away from the knowing and overly suspicious eyes of his brother, he allowed himself to check his phone for any new messages while the computer booted up.
Dean was the first person who knew about the engagement. He’d known about it for weeks actually, since he helped Charlie plan the whole thing. And his happiness for her still hadn’t dwindled one bit. When he was still recovering from his accident, Charlie sat with him in his hospital room almost as much as Sam. She snuck him junk food and made him laugh when he was truly at his lowest. When traditional physical therapy only frustrated him to the point of madness, it was her idea to visit the studio. Suggested that Pam work with him slowly and patiently with different exercises using the pole and his own body weight to rebuild muscle and strength. Neither Pam or Charlie took any bullshit and they didn’t patronize him like the physical therapists did. He owed so much to both of them. But especially Charlie. Charlie was his sister in every way but blood.
“Ummm,” he stammered again. “It was pretty cool. Not quite what I expected,” Castiel said, trying to sound casual.
Suddenly needing to be kissed, he crawled up Cas’s naked body, stopping to place gentle kisses along his way. He hovered over Cas and lowered himself until they were finally skin to skin, save for his boxers. They traded sloppy kisses, sucking on tongues, and nibbling on bottom lips. Dean got so lost in it that soon they were rutting against each other, using the thin damp fabric between them for added friction.
Cas continued, stepping out of his shoes and turning around to bend down and peel off his socks. Cas casually stood up again, still with his back to Dean and pulled his belt loose from his pants, letting it drop next to his crumpled shirt. Next, the only sound in the room was the recognizable clink of a zipper. Castiel seemed to be good at this strip tease game. “Cas. Have you been watching more, uh…research?”
“You know, I haven’t seen Dean this excited about something in a long time. It’s nice to see. Thank you. For getting him here.”
“Yeah. I’m sure,” Cas replied shrugging his shoulders. “I rode up with you guys. Figure I’ll go back with the girls. And now you’ll have more space for the trophy,” he added, trying to keep his face from betraying him. “I’ll see you in a few days Dean.”
Castiel’s mouth twitched in a smile after he blew out the breath he’d been holding. He had no idea that three little words could be so exciting and so terrifying at the same time.
“Fuck, Cas, you’re killing me here,” Dean whined. “There’s lube in my bag. In the side pocket where the condoms are. I’m gonna need us to move things along if you’re gonna keep talking like that, or else I’m gonna come in my pants,” he added with a hint of desperation.
He really was a dumbass. And an asshole. No wonder Cas couldn’t stand to ride in the same car with him last night. He wouldn’t have blamed Cas for blowing the entire competition. But he hadn’t. Even after all the hurtful shit Dean said, Cas still gave everything he had on that stage and got them the win. He was definitely a better person than Dean. The longer he sat, watching his coffee grow cold, the more convinced he became that Castiel was someone he always wanted by his side, in whatever capacity Cas would allow. Of course, that’s when that little nagging voice in his head whispered,
Castiel remained quiet, but took a deep breath and closed his eyes. After counting to ten, he looked up at his brother. “And would it be so bad if I did?”
Dean straddled him and dribbled lube over his swollen cock, coating it liberally with a few firm strokes. Castiel groaned at the contact and pulled against the tie holding him to the bed. After assuring he was well prepped with a couple of slick fingers, he finally fit the head of Cas’s cock against his hole and began to lower himself. Barely a minute later, he was fully seated with Cas’s cock filling him perfectly. He remained still for a moment, letting himself acclimate to the stretch.
Two hours later, Dean was fed, showered, and dressed as he stepped through the door of Angel’s Books for the first time. The warm lighting mixed with the scent of coffee, ink, and worn in leather furniture. It was inviting, comforting, and somehow invigorating at the same time.
They just got each other off. On the floor, in the middle of the pole studio. And now what? Were they supposed to cuddle or something? Would Cas expect some kind of freaking relationship now? Dean didn’t do relationships. Hell, he barely managed to keep his own head above water most days. And why did he have to go and admit that he thought about Cas when he jerked off at home? His stupid sex-brain clearly wasn’t getting enough oxygen at the time, resulting in word vomit.
“Castiel,” he reminded him, his smile dropping a bit, probably assuming Dean had forgotten. He hadn’t.
“Ungh, fuck I can feel you squeezing me! Oh my fucking god, you feel so good! You’re so fucking tight!” Castiel growled, his eyes rolling back in pleasure. Finding his last bit of strength, Cas fucked him even harder as he chased his own release. Suddenly, his pace stammered. Cas bent forward, and ran his tongue over Dean’s torso, lapping up Dean’s fresh cum while emptying himself inside him.
As the minutes ticked by, the more he reminded himself what a selfish asshole he was being. Here he was, feeling sorry for himself when Lisa was the one who got hurt.
With the tip of the toy resting over Cas’s entrance, Dean switched it back on, enjoying himself while Cas squirmed below him.
Dean knows thier time alone is limited. As soon as they reach the motel, they will have Sam to deal with. As they cross a small alley way, Dean instinctively grabs Cas by the hand and pulls him into the dark space. “I can’t wait anymore,” Dean pleads and pushes Cas against the brick. Not wanting to be overly agressive, Dean holds back his overwhelming desire to claim Cas as his right there in the street. Instead, he steadies himself with a deep breath and reaches both hands up to Cas’s face. He takes a step closer to Cas as their lips finally make contact for the first time. It’s slow and gentle, but Dean has never poured more of himself into a kiss before this one. This one kiss that changes everything. Because best friends don’t kiss like this.
The response to the first chapter was so encouraging (thank you!), so I'm going to keep this thing going for a bit. This chapter is pretty short and still ultra fluffy. Smut to follow. Hope you like it.
Never breaking eye contact, Dean slowly lowered his hand, his fingers skimming over Castiel’s body, until they found the hem of his shorts. He dipped a finger below the fabric, but didn’t go any further, giving Castiel the chance to pull away if he wanted. Castiel only continued to look up at him through dark lashes until he slowly nodded his head, urging Dean to press on. When Dean finally wrapped his fingers around his cock, Cas let out a loud sigh, threw his head back against Dean’s shoulder, his mouth open and eyes closed.
