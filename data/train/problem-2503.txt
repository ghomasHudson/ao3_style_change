Stiles tried not to let it affect him. He kept going to parties with Sam, sometimes Sam and Jess, and sometimes just Jess, flirting with mostly anyone who gave him a second glance. It was fun, getting to go out and actually act like a normal eighteen-year-old for once.
“This is not awesome. This is the exact opposite of awesome. Horrible. The worst. Hate it.” Stiles babbled, groaning unhappily from where he was slumped on the floor. The sound of the door opening and thudding against the wall made him whine more, “Who the hell invited bigfoot to the party?”
he’d be back in May, have a depressing mother’s day with his dad, try and get dad to celebrate father’s day by drinking a beer together (it hadn’t worked for the past two years but Stiles was sure third times the charm), and spend the summer howling at the moon with his best friend.
“Hey, man, I know fucking around helps you guys cool off after a show, and I love you both, I do, but that is not—”
As they drove through Grand Rapids, Stiles sketched out mini replications of the books currently sitting in his backpack. Sam laughed when he looked over and saw the images before turning his eyes back to the road, driving the jeep after Stiles’ six-hour turn had ended. “You serious?”
By the time the first book was typed up and he was starting on the second of the three Derek had shipped him, Stiles’ hair had faded from the bright orange he started the summer with to a pale yellow. He had just sent Derek the file for the first book when he was out picking up another color—banana yellow—when his phone dinged in response.
No response from Derek, but Stiles remembered it had only been a couple hours. He had a message from Scott, surprisingly, asking what he was up to. Stiles figured, hey, the guy asked, so might as well be honest, before sending back:
“Unless you expect me to mash a pot and pan together for an hour straight, I don’t know why you’re calling me for help.” Sam sighed, rolling his eyes at his brother’s melodrama when he caught Stiles’ eyes from across the room.
"What if something happened somewhere else and its affecting you two?" Both Dean and Cas stare at him blankly, not really sure what to say. It just doesn't seem realistic. "Oh, for fucks sake. Guys, its easy to understand. Think about it. Dean can't say something he's always been able to say just out of the blue. What if something happened in the scripts? They changed something."
“Dean, please. I don’t know what’s wrong. I love you too much to see you like this.” Cas whispers, fear and worry clouding the bliss he feels to hold the man he loves.
"Wait, Dean. There," he points at a video. "Let me see that." Dean does as he asks and plays the video. It looks exactly like what happened all those years ago. The deal with the Empty. It's not a very good angle and it looks like it's a behind the scenes video. That's when a thought occurs to Castiel "This looks like something you'd see in bloopers."
“-But with the protection Rowena has on us, that’s very unlikely,” Cas finishes. Not long ago, they had a very special encounter with witches that gave them all a big scare. They ended up asking Rowena if there was a spell to keep them protected at least when they are inside the bunker. To their luck, there was. “Research?” Dean groans and flops back on the bed. Cas chuckles at his hatred for research.
It took quite a bit of convincing but Cas finally got Dean out of bed. They walked into the library, both looking troubled considering there isn’t exactly a place to start. Dean picked out two books for himself and three for Cas. He huffs and Dean looks towards him. “What?”
Dean pays the crew no mind as continues to argue with whoever he's talking to on the phone. "I have more power than you, buddy. You see, Jensen has this thing. It's pretty cool. I'm sure you've heard of it, a Twitter and Instagram following. If you don't do something about this now, I swear to you, every Dean and Castiel admirer will learn the truth my way." The call goes on for way more than Castiel thought it would. Dean and whoever he called argue for a long time. When he finally ends it, he does not look like he just one a battle. He continues to look through the phone, desperate for anything that might help their situation. He looks through text messages, social media, google, even notes. He eventually goes through the actors camera roll when Castiel sees something that catches his eye.
"Yes. I just couldn't understand why it was in Spanish and why it was a big deal if a few scripts have changed. I mean, they surely wouldn't have let an old script get leaked. So, I started thinking. Why would a show, that's in English, have Spanish involved? Which is when I realized this show is probably in other languages. So, Spanish Dub. I knew it had something to do with Spanish dubs but I was stumped on what it could be." Sam pauses for a moment, as if he's waiting for them to comment. So they do.
"Okay, lets say this thing turns out to be true? Hm? What are we gonna do about it?" Sam doesn't have an answer right away and Dean doesn't wait. "Nothing. There's nothing we can do." Dean's getting upset and he's getting upset quickly. "I-I can't go the rest of my life not saying it. I c-can't. If what you say is true then I don't think I-" Dean is crying now. And he is crying 𝘩𝘢𝘳𝘥. Castiel is up and out of his seat in a heartbeat. He hugs Dean tightly, cradling his head into his chest. "I can't do it. I-" He doesn't get the rest out.
"What are you guys doing here? Show's over pal." Dean, losing his temper, whips out his phone - or the phone of the actor he's impersonating. He looks into the camera of the phone and it unlocks for him. He clicks on the Call app and starts to scroll through his contact list. Castiel doesn't recognize the name Dean clicks on but Dean seems confident about it. The line rings through twice before a voice on the other end greets him.
He thinks back on their conversation. Dean had told Miracle that he loved them. Was that what he was trying to say? No. It translated to ‘don’t do this Cas’ not ‘I love you, Cas’. He sighs, closing his eyes only to see green eyes, lost and empty. Dean looked at his phone and when he hit translate, he broke. Castiel wishes to unsee everything from this. He opens his eyes, not being able to stand it any longer. He pushes his hand through Dean’s hair, it usually calms him down. It’s keeping him comfort but he feels anything but calm. Dean’s body goes completely limp and this time it’s Castiel who trembles.
"I don't think I would be able to go this long. It would be very difficult. I'm not sure how you're doing it." Dean stiffens, meeting Cas's gaze. His eyes are hard. "I'm not trying to make you feel bad, Dean. Don't look at me like that. I'm just trying to talk to you."
"I'm getting there. I'm getting there." Sam interrupts. "We worked on that show....uh, 'Supernatural' I think. Anyways, I had to get interviewed on it and the interviewer had mentioned how we didn't have that big of a fandom but we had a passionate one. So passionate that they would get pretty angry when something didn't go their way. Well, when the network had done something shitty and pissed them off."
"Dean, are you not understanding? This will have everything. We've already watched ten minutes of a crew and cast give directions and lines. If Sam was right, and something was cut, this will have it. You need to post this. Now."
Cas grabs Dean’s phone, only to see what Dean translated. It’s Spanish to English and it’s translated to “Don’t do this, Cas.” Why would he be saying ‘don’t do this Cas’?
“Gave me more than you,” He opens his book and and starts scanning through the pages. “I mean I know you hate research but don’t drag me down with you.” He says, clearly joking. Dean didn’t seem to get that.
Dean stands up quickly, "I need to speak to someone with authority. Who's that?" He asks, voice hard. Several people exchange glances, looking utterly lost. "I don't have time for this. Who's in charge here?"
"I think so. Something must've happened in the scripts. Dean can't say 'I love you' to Cas and only Cas. I think that's what happened in the show. Whatever was happening in that scene had Cas saying 'I love you' and Dean saying 'Don't do this, Cas' because that's what Dean's been saying in Spanish. So again, something must've happened. My theory is that the scripts originally had Dean saying 'I love you, too' or something and those scripts had been accidentally sent out to the translating business. Then, the English version aired, showing the whole scene with the new lines. Then, the Spanish one airs and its different. I'm assuming the fans who ship you guys together found out pretty quickly. The network, not being able to handle the commotion, probably had it changed to 'Don't do this, Cas'  or 'No lo hagas, Cas'. There's absolutely no way that sat well with the fans. I think the impact was so hard it ended up messing up our world. You." Sam stops talking, looking a bit relieved and proud. He has to admit, Sam does have a point.
Castiel has been watching Dean pace for over an hour and a half. Ever since they got home, Dean's been worried that it still won't work. That he won't be able to say it. "Dean, if you can't do it then we find something else. However, we're not going to find out if you don't say it at all."
“Fine.” Dean angrily walks over, grabs a book from Cas’s short stack and adds it to his own. Cas looks at him with wide eyes. “What? You gonna get mad at me for stealing your books now too?”
His thoughts get interrupted when Sam comes bursting through the door with a proud smile hanging on his face. Cas tries to shove down the hope that's bubbling inside him but he just can't help it. "Please tell me who have some good news behind that smile." Cas says, optimistically. Sam just smiles and turns around leaving the room again. Castiel has no time to be shock because next thing he knows, Sam has returned with Dean trailing behind him. "Sam? What's this all about?" He asks.
Castiel awakes to the sound of knocking at the door. Dean shifts a little, wrapping his arm more firmly against Cas's chest. He rolls his eyes and tries to climb out of bed but Dean only tightens his grip. Once again the sound of knocking fills the room. Knowing Dean won't let go, he sighs exasperated and calls from where he is, "Come in."
"Dean," Cas whispers softly, carding his fingers through Dean's hair. He looks beautiful with the ray of of sun beaming in and highlighting all of the hunter's features. "You want to go eat?" To Castiel's surprise, Dean shakes his head slowly. Cas chuckles and taps lightly on Dean's shoulder. Dean looks at him curiously. "You haven't talked to me about all of this. How are you feeling?"
"Dean." Castiel grumbles, not in the mood for his husband's behavior. Deans already out the door, not staying long enough to listen to what he has to say. Castiel reluctantly follows him.
"It's pretty easy, Dean. We are just going to throw you two into that universe just as Balthazar did." For the first time in a week, Dean looks hopeful.
“It’s nice to know you miss me,” Stiles mused. “Too bad you didn’t let me blow you before you dropped me off last night,” Stiles hummed over the line, “Could’ve at least left you with
Crowley had already started walking away, huffing about Stiles’ lack of social media presence and the opportunity being
He was leaning against the wall outside their room, thumbing through the comments on the band’s Instagram, when the sound of the police cruiser pulling in caught his attention. He shot a quick message off to Cas:
“I am ready to fuck shit up, Stilinski,” Erica smirked, pounding her fist against her palm for emphasis. Boyd mirrored a similar expression on his face, standing coolly beside her. Stiles was impressed, actually, that she and Lydia had skipped the heels and worn harder boots. Maybe it was from years of getting clips of Stiles whining about bruised and broken toes after tussling in pits harder than he thought possible. Maybe they actually cared about the scene.
“It seems everyone knows this bartender far better than I do,” he grinned, “Looks like I’m in need of more whiskey.”
“You can come down and visit! We’ll be piecing things together the first couple of months probably but it’s nice. We each have our own room, and I have a feeling Jess might end up staying here too if her house with the girls on her floor falls through, and then at least the rent would be cheaper, and—”
Stiles muttered, “Dishonor on your cow, dishonor on your family,” words coming out jumbled as he rested his head on the cold metal of the door.
been doing that if someone hadn’t kept a huge stick up his ass for damn near a decade. Besides, Stiles wasn’t the only one working nonstop. Derek was apparently the head bartender at Jungle and only got the one night off because he all-but-forced another guy to switch with him. Stiles had tried to see if Derek would be interested in seeing them in the Portland scene, but was quickly shot down when Derek explained he had to be there for Friday
He should’ve expected nothing less when Derek decided to rear his too-fucking-handsome head into the mix and drag Stiles’ metaphorical ass back into Beacon Hills (and yes, Jess, it was a handsome face, and no, there are no photos, because the man is a damn
It didn’t become a thing, but Stiles continued to take the offered hits from Cas and Dean after shows. The guys had rolled him a couple joints to keep on him after he returned to Palo Alto and they got back on the road, but the semester had been in full swing nearly a month and he hadn’t touched them. He wasn’t some afterschool special about gateway drugs, and he really liked using it to calm down when his brain wouldn’t stop. When Sam saw them sitting on his desk, he barely paid him any mind about it, mentioning if he ran out he was pretty sure Gabe had a hook up he could connect them with.
Stiles rolled his eyes – this was old news. Not only did they regularly play Halloween / Rocky Horror inspired gigs in the fall, with or without Stiles, but there was almost a straight year where Castiel wore predominantly skirts instead of pants. Dean made his joyous opinion of the change happily known, every day.
In retrospect, he really hadn’t been gone long, so Stiles shouldn’t have been surprised to see that the house had barely changed. From what he could gather, it was only Derek living there, although Erica had mentioned Isaac was thinking about moving out of the loft and into one of the room’s that had pretty much become his own. She had grinned at the thought, looking up at Stiles with a new wave of excitement clear in her expression. Stiles made a joke about hiring wedding bands, to which she playfully shoved him nearly off of the couch, laughing as he struggled to get back up without smudging the still-wet nail polish.
The person standing behind the bar leaned against the counter lining the wall, arms crossed in front of his fitted black shirt. An eyebrow raised as Stiles jumped down from the stage and headed his way.
“I still want to do the socials and the marketing,” Stiles quickly added, “but I think taking time out like I did back in school might be good.”
He ended the call with his dad as he stood up, surveying the backyard. He could make out Allison and Scott laying on some deflated pool rafts on the grass, Erica curled up into Boyd. Isaac was seated in a chair across from Stiles at the table. He grabbed a bottle of water from one of the coolers that were left out from the party, walking into the home where he saw Lydia disappear to hours earlier, poking his head around. He took a seat at the island, scrolling through his phone briefly.
“Interrupted by who, Crowley, or Lydia?” Stiles watched Castiel cautiously, staring at the sharp grin that graced his features.
He knocked that omega’s head in with a wolfsbane dipped baseball bat before collapsing from shock, the pack finishing the job and getting him to the hospital before he bled out (which, according to Melissa, was apparently a risk).
Stiles wondered sometimes if his dad’s issue with the band life was because he was a man of the law and didn’t want Stiles falling into some rock-and-roll cliché. It’s not like they were shooting up drugs and fucking through groupies after shows. He’s pretty sure Dean and Cas would probably still get into their sexualized performance without the benefit of weed loosening them up, because that’s just how they were, but he doubted his dad would get it. Hell, no one he knew smoked. His friends weren’t exactly
“Well isn’t that nice,” Crowley grinned, pulling out his phone and scrolling, updating his social media story with the latest news.
Still, they had enough meetings with family leaders or local hunters that when Chris Argent came knocking on their motel door, Stiles rolled his eyes before backing into the room to let the guy in. Crowley had been sitting on the bed he shared with Stiles, having joined them back at the makeshift living arrangements after leaving the warehouse, tugging his pants on when Stiles got up to answer the door. Dean and Cas were tumbling out of the bathroom.
Apparently, the guys had started to notice, and Dean and Cas pulled him over to their side of the room, stopping him from curling up with one of the texts after they had gotten back to their current motel room. “Kid, sit down.”
Compared to the first meal they shared, and the dozens of phone calls over the years, Stiles actually felt like this was the first time they sat and talked, no cut off arguments about what Stiles was doing with his life because for once neither of them brought it up. John mentioned how, at the weekly Rotary Club meeting, the local business owners were talking about the recent uptick in business. Stiles grinned, his dad finally starting to see how what they did was about more than just
Stiles had snapped a photo of his face, joint tucked into the corner of his mouth as he took the second drag, eyes already half lidded. He typed out the caption:
“Wow, someone is putting their college fun on hold to spent time with their family?” John spoke with sarcasm clear in his voice, “Wish that could be said for more of you punks.”
He had gotten his lobes pierced after a girl at one of Lydia’s parties said her cousin taught her how, during junior year of high school, and his dad had squinted at him funny but didn’t say a word. Huffed that it was better than a tattoo.
Stiles was used to afterparties, getting to unwind and ride out the adrenaline high he always got, maybe find someone to sneak off into a bathroom with, but it was never broadcasted the way Dean and Cas moved their bodies. And never in a party where he intricately knew most of the other people attending. He leaned back against the brick wall near the door, pulling out a small cigarette wallet he kept extra joints in. This felt like one hell of an emergency if he’d ever seen one. Just as he took the first hit, he scanned the room to take a look at everyone there.
Stiles drew the pillow back, holding Erica’s in a firm look, “No, Erica, he did not kiss me, he did not show any reciprocation of my feelings, and pulled me out the house before shutting the door in my face.”
“Not my fault.” John shrugged, letting go of Stiles so he could climb into the police cruiser. He took one last look at his jeep, sighing, before turning back to his dad. He could survive an hour with his dad, one of the most popular and identifiable members of the Beacon Hills community, no combustion side effects. Totally.
“Well damn,” Stiles muttered, pocketing his phone so he could go pay for the hair color. While camped out in the motel’s bathroom, hair processing, Stiles pulled his phone out again, ready to send a snap of the process to Erica and Lydia, already planning his debate about blondes having more fun, when he saw the notification from Derek still sitting, unopened.
“Probably, yeah.” Stiles confirmed. He pocketed his phone after the beep sounded, signaling the call was ended. He closed up the wooden box on his desk, tucking it back into the drawer he’d pulled it from.
“What are you even trying to get out of this, now, anyway?” Stiles questioned. At the look Derek gave him, he rolled his eyes. “Please, it doesn’t take being a wolf to know you think I’m hot and have jealousy issues.” Before Derek could answer, Stiles continued, “I’m not settling down. I like being on the road, getting to be this nameless drummer who floats from city to city. It’s the best adrenaline high since running from wolves in the woods with you guys, and it’s a helluva lot safer, too.”
people competent in Latin in a pack, and I am not going to put my pursuit of higher-level education on hold just to be on his beck and call to read through any old book he sends my way.” She lifted her chin as she grinned. “I told him I would happily review your work when you were done, but he had to send it to you first.”
“Glad to see you boys fully clothed.” John huffed, looking at the two for a longer second than necessary.
Dean grinned, “Fuck yeah it was.” Castiel caught his eye and he sat up, “Man, I don’t want to wreck the fun, but seriously, when’s the last time you slept?”
“If this is what you’ve been doing instead of coming home, I can’t say I blame you.” Erica grinned, “That crowd is addicting.”
“Hell, Crowley made it over before you guys,” Stiles rolled his eyes, “Don’t look now, but you might actually be getting some competition.”
“Totally, dad, we even put all of our keys in a fishbowl and locked it under a cabinet.” Stiles grinned, “Nah, it was nice to just get to have some fun with everyone.”
“Please, like you didn’t know,” Stiles rolled his eyes, “Mr. All Hearing, All Knowing didn’t catch the part where Lydia cockblocked me?” At Derek’s frown, he glared. “Last I checked, it was none of your business who I kissed anyway.” He looked up at the ceiling before muttering, “You made that clear years ago.”
He sat there, tapping the bottom of the shot glass from where he had flipped it over, leg bouncing from where it set resting on the edge of the bar stool. Derek watched the fidgeting hand movements before glancing up at Stiles. Before Stiles could say anything else, Dean was yelling at him to
Stiles groaned before thumbing through his screen. He was still getting notifications from the band’s account, but he went past all of them to find a message from Jess. She had been watching Isaac’s posts as they came out and freaking
Thankfully, Gabriel had handed him a baggie when they met up earlier in the day and Stiles already had papers tucked into his duffel, so the only thing on his agenda for their day off was to replenish his supplies and actually look into buying his own pen.
or if it was because he spent less time sleeping, the amped up shows leaving adrenaline pumping through his body hours after they were done, which led to him fidgeting relentlessly when everyone tried to catch some sleep before they hit the road again. Unlike high school, he couldn’t blame being wired on his Adderall either—he hadn’t refilled that prescription in months, coping well enough with some more
Their music was more loose this night compared to the last, letting the energy of the crowd guide them as they lengthened one song and shortened another. Crowley and Cas had their own fight of guitars, ripping chords out of their instruments while Crowley stood atop of his amp case. Cas stayed with his feet firmly planted, front of his foot easily switching between the effect pedals he had at his disposal.
“Remind me to get you one of your own,” Castiel nodded, turning back to the face the front, grinning as he watched Dean practice moving around the stage again.
John stared at Stiles for a moment before answering, “We both remember what happened last time I came to one of your shows, Stiles.”
“I figured you could take over most of the social media work, though, and the local contacts,” Jess said, looking up at Stiles. “We can map it out more later, if you want.”
He never quite figured out how Castiel and Gabriel fit into the Winchester family, but the pair were so ingrained Stiles couldn’t imagine a story about Sam that didn’t feature either of them.
,” Stiles grumbled, shoving a hand through his aquamarine-tinted hair, throwing the book on an end table while he went back to bring his bags in from the jeep. Him, and Sam and Jess, had spent the last three weeks traveling across the southern border, and he was happily still riding the high of actually being a drummer in a band, and then Derek, King of Dicks, reared his ugly head?
They were packing up for a second summer on the road when two more books arrived. Almost as if their mystery sender knew Stiles was about to be gone and if they wanted work done, they had to ship it before their mail got put on hold.
“I guess so. You don’t hunt mine, I don’t hunt yours. You speak Latin, I don’t. Sounds like a good friendship to me.” Stiles grinned. “Can you please explain the salt obsession you’ve got going on, because I had a dozen theories but they all seem
“Right.” Derek looked away, not saying what Lydia’s price was. Which meant it had to have been good. A loud yell from the crowd across the room caught both of their attentions, causing the corresponding shouts from others to grow even louder in response. Derek frowned. “Is there anywhere we can—”
She flipped her hair over her shoulder with a shrug, “Some people were born to kick ass. I was trained for it.” Erica winked at Stiles.
“You focus on your classes when you get down there, don’t stress out about being back here until Thanksgiving.” John grinned. “You forget anything and I can always ship it down.”
Isaac grinned wide, clearly thriving under the praise. Stiles gripped his shoulder before turning back towards the room. Just as he turned, Dean grabbed him from around the shoulders and hollered in greeting. “Why the
“See if I ever fucking help that guy out again,” Stiles yelled as he sat heavily down on the couch beside Sam. He looked up from the book he was reading, looking at Stiles cautiously. Stiles rolled his eyes, “We translate two tomes from him, and what does he say in return? Do we get a thank you? I appreciate you taking the time to learn Latin on top of all your other school work? Hell no, Sam. We get
Stiles walked out, leaning against the cruiser in the parking lot while he waited for his dad to wrap up and join him. He really should’ve fought to drive his car, but they both knew he would’ve driven in the opposite direction the second they were both behind the wheel. Stiles huffed, glaring in the sun as he looked through the windows of the diner to see what his dad was doing, when the sound of a throat clearing caught his attention. Stiles turned, glare falling away as he stared wide.
“I know, I know, saved by the bell,” Stiles mumbled, wincing as he pulled up his sleeve to look at his arm. He had finally gotten the two books translated with Sam, and in celebration added the badge of the books with the Latin banner to his arm. He had just sent the saved files to Lydia that morning with an attached photo of his arm from the shop, before they wrapped it up, the solid lines of the piece standing apart from his older ink.
Stiles leveled a glare at Dean just as Cas came around the other side, first acknowledging the sound set up before directing his attention to the guys. “Sorry we took so long.”
“Dad’s always been more of a hunter.” Sam leaned back on his hands from where he sat on his bed. “Dean, too, but he sticks to ghosts and ghouls.”
Jess was right, as Stiles came to expect her to always be, and their band was a growing buzz amongst the punk scene, with more and more shows selling out. They needed larger venue space, and being there for the first gig of its type, Stiles was enthralled. He had been around for some doozy shows, with less than ten people present, but this one had
Without a word, Sam quickly redressed Stiles, pushing his shoes and jeans off his bottoms before throwing the comforter over him. He rolled Stiles to his side, trash bin within spitting distance. He sat heavily down on his bed next to Jess, hands resting on his knees. “Fuck.”
Sometimes the towns they went through had a local pack or supernatural presence and the guys were used to being stopped by local representatives telling them to back out, leave, because they were causing too much of a disturbance to the peace with their shenanigans.
It wasn’t until Stiles’ had dried his hair with Erica’s help, the violet tones bright against his fair skin, their nails dry and reaching the tail end of another movie, did he realize she was shooting sideways glances to Boyd. He waited several more minutes, waiting to see if they’d relent, but as the tension grew increasingly obvious, Stiles groaned, “What are you two trying to say without me hearing?”
“They planned this,” Stiles argued, standing up and walking out onto the porch. Derek followed behind him, closing the door softly behind them.
“Thanks guys,” Stiles grinned. “I’ll call Jess so we can plan it out. Between Meg and Benny, we should be able to work it out so you don’t miss out on any of the gigs.” He pulled out his phone, pressing on Jess’s name to make the call.
Stiles looked up when Sam pushed the bathroom door open, standing up from where he had been sitting on the edge of the tub, smiling wide when he realized who it was. “You made it!” Stiles yelled.
Realization hit Stiles as he swirled one drumstick in his hand before punching out a tight, hard beat. Shows had a tendency of either going really fucking good or becoming a shitstorm disaster, especially if playing in a new place that didn’t know their shtick, but crowds loved Crowley almost as much as they loved Dean and Castiel. They always got calls back to the venues where they hit the stage together, doors to the backstage crowded as people tried to make their way back to join them, or invite them to some other house party happening after. Sometimes they went, sometimes they stayed, and sometimes Stiles stayed and waited for Dean and Castiel to finish fucking before going.
Dean didn’t respond besides liking his message. Cas sent him a separate message, wishing him luck. Stiles grinned down at his phone, happily reminded yet again why he loved doing the shit they did together.
Huh. “Well I’ll be damned.” Stiles breathed aloud, taking the note and pinning it to the refrigerator. At Sam’s questioning look Stiles grinned, “It’s the Alpha’s first letter, it’s about as monumental as a baby’s first words or a kid’s first A+ on his spelling homework.” Sam laughed in response, watching as Stiles took a photo of the note on his fridge and captioned it with the very same sentence before firing it off to Erica and Lydia.
By their fourth night in Beacon Hills, Stiles agreed to go back to the house with Derek for the second time, but only under the condition that he’d drop him back off before they fell asleep. They had just finished their Wednesday night set and had three shows lined up in Portland before they’d come back Sunday afternoon. Derek complained they were running around like kids in high school, to which Stiles fired back that they
Stiles worked with Jess to make note of which towns, or venues, they played in that elicited increased social media traffic and positive impacts, with Jess mapping out their next summer tour schedule when the current one had just barely finished. She continued to book gigs for the guys to do while they were in school, and Dean and Cas continued to experience their routine basement gigs, but they hadn’t had one like the bar in San Fran until they returned during winter. Stiles knew their likelihood of drawing a larger crowd was pretty decent when they were in cities or close enough to universities, but they weren’t always guaranteed. Their winter show in Phoenix, Arizona was their regular platform stage, but the owner commented to Dean and Jess that he wanted to talk about contracting them for his second property, which, if Stiles overheard correctly, could fit three times the number of patrons.
He thumbed through to his saved stories and silently watched the looping clip that was timestamped with 2:29am, where he was apparently licking and lapping at both Erica and Lydia’s stomachs before retrieving the sliced fruit from their mouths.
Dean barked out a laugh in response. Castiel stood, grabbing one of their bags and retrieved a small case. Dean took out his zippo, flicking the lid open and shut while Castiel finished pulling out one of the joints they had rolled before Stile got into town. Dean lit the end for Castiel, grinning when he shared the first pull by shotgunning with Dean. They grinning loosely at each other before Castiel turned towards Stiles, letting him take a couple deep hits before returning.
“Lookin hot, man,” Dean’s voice rang out in the motel room, grinning from behind Castiel’s shoulder when Stiles emerged from the bathroom. He had grabbed some bleach and developer at the beauty store, lightening the ends of his hair before adding the magenta. The color was vibrant as all hell, a stark contrast against his brown roots and fair skin. Stiles grinned at the appraisal, turning to the mirror and picking up his phone. He fired a photo off to Erica and Lydia, adding Scott at the last second, line of text written on top of the image:
“Yeah, doesn’t mean they wouldn’t make for a cool coffee table book.” Sam’s eyes looked to where the other original-texts sat on their bookcase in the corner of the room. Stiles had to admit the guy had a point – people usually asked about the books, not believing when either of them said they were in old Latin, laughing at the absurdity of two guys having books that people couldn’t actually read on display.
“About that—” Stiles pulled some other clothes out of his bag, kicking off his shoes, “Dad’s going to be in the crowd tonight.”
“Why do you need to know Latin, Stiles?” Sam asked cautiously. It was true, one time he walked in while Stiles was muttering to himself in the dead language, and Sam had caught enough of a snippet that he repeated it in English, much to Stiles’ surprise. It was something they hadn’t brought up again, though.
Stiles adjusted the mic stand that tilted to the side of the drum set before standing up to assess the placement. He moved around, sitting in his chair and banging out a couple beats. “Who did you guys get to play rhythm?”
Stiles looked up after pocketing his phone, realizing Erica and Boyd had fallen asleep against each other, with Scott and Allison in a similar situation. Stiles remembered Lydia had left at the end of the first movie, which was around the same time Isaac had wandered upstairs, probably to go find an actual bed.
“I do take breaks! Besides, I never thought you’d be mad I got my work ethic from you.” Stiles added.
They would end the month in Portland, with Stiles knowing he’d have to travel back down to Palo Alto to finish moving out of the house. He brought the subject up to Sam, who shrugged him off. Him and Jess had already moved half of their things into their new apartment and told Stiles’ they’d store his boxes until he had his next steps figured out. Sam said to let him know if he wanted them to grab any boxes to keep with him before they came up north, but Stiles was sure he had everything he needed. They didn’t have any solid shows squared away for June and the start of July, when they would need to start making their way east, but watching the way their social media was booming made Stiles confident their calendar wasn’t going to stay open for long and he wanted to be there for every performance this time around.
“Who is your friend?” Crowley asked, having stepped down the stage and joined Stiles at the bar. He grinned, leaning back with his hands tipped into his pockets. “And would he mind pouring some shots, on the house of course, to help get the star performers ready?”
“Where you coming from?” Stiles asked, sitting on his bed. He had started unpacking his things, having already made the bed with the extra set of sheets he had at home.
“Melissa asked about you when I told her I was driving down.” Stiles wondered if his dad learned how to imply a thousand words in one sentence from years of being a parent—
when he was hanging out with his friends. Besides, Jess had messaged him saying they were less than an hour out.
“No buts.” Sam grinned. “C’mon, we need to find someone to take a photo of all of us. We’ll frame it to remember freshman year.”
Erica rolled her eyes, “If I didn’t have a shop to run I would almost consider chasing you guys cross-country.”
It was safe to say with all of the work Stiles was doing with Jess in managing the band and their public image, and maintaining his stellar GPA, Stiles had forgotten about the pack.
For whatever game Lydia was trying to play at, it didn’t help much, anyway. It took him a couple months to get through the book with Sam’s help, and by the time he had, Scott had started distancing himself from Stiles, too, and Derek never mentioned the deal Lydia had struck with him.
Turns out that Beacon Hills was just far enough south of Portland and Seattle, and far enough north of any major city in California, that there were a lot of punk fans spread out between the two, itching for a place to go that wouldn’t cost them a day in travel. Jungle’s social media was blowing up, which led to the band’s Instagram blowing up, and Jess was messaging Stiles about their traffic increase while he walked the aisles of the local beauty store. She had a big family function starting soon and wanted him to take over their account, and asked if one of his
“In case you forgot,” Stiles continued, “I’m not exactly pack. I barely talk to any of you. Excuse me if I find that hard to fucking believe.”
In Stiles’ defense, soon is not easy to operationally define. Time was just a theoretic construct built by humankind, and he figured he’d be back in Beacon Hills sooner, than, say, turning eighty.
He was updating his resume, adding the internship with the band to his most recent work experience, and wondered if all of this free labor he gave Derek could count, too. He’d never be able to use the guy as a reference, but he had done hours of unpaid work for the guy, and if that didn’t shout
“Obviously, not when you’re a kid and trying to figure out your identity and shit.” Stiles shook his head, “But when it’s because you chose it, and are in pursuit of what
Stiles pulled the door of the building open harder than he probably needed to, frowning when he looked at the person manning the front desk. He had no idea who they were. Stiles frowned harder, trying to remember a time when he
Sure, there was always a chance they’d see a show up in Portland, travel, and find out Stiles wasn’t the drummer for the night, but they could’ve still taken the risk. Stiles liked that about the way Jess ran their social media and did their marketing – their faces were rarely used, and if they were in a photo, it was usually heavily edited to make him indistinguishable from the other drummers they used. Dean and Castiel were the only ones recognizable across flyers and posters, but that was strategic—you remembered them after you saw a gig. You didn’t usually remember who was playing the bass line, or hitting cymbals in the back. On the rare chance the boys traveled to the Midwest, they’d grab a guy who played keyboard and did some stellar programming, and with just the three of them they’d have all of the sounds of a full band, with the rhythm and crash hits playing when the keyboardist pressed the right keys.
He wrestles the box in past the doorway, and sets it down heavily on the kitchen counter. “Jesus,” he mutters, “I gotta start lifting weights or something.”
“Will you just—” Dean grins as Sam shakes his head, rueful, and tosses the piece of paper onto Dean’s desk. “Anyway. Just read it.”
He sighs. “What can I say? It’s— maybe it’s just broken in me. The piece that— I wish I could give it to you easy, Cas. More’n anything, I wish that.” He swallows. If only— if he were a real person, the kind of person who knew how to do this, then he could make Cas happy.
“There’s— trouble in Heaven,” he says, stalking out of the kitchen. Sam follows him, matching his pace easy. “I don’t understand— I’m not sure why the angels have told me about it. Invited me.”
“Yeah, I get it,” Dean says quietly. Sam grins, and Dean smiles back, helpless to it, to the joy on Sam’s face that he hasn’t seen for years and years and years. “Good for you, man.”
But Cas, above all else, gives as good as he gets. Dean watches the curve of his mouth as he snipes, “What, Dean? Do you want me to say that I love you? Is that what you want from me?”
Dean looks at his hands on the steering wheel. A decade without Cas, if that happens. “I’m,” he says, and it’s too close. “Not really ready to think about that.”
,” Dean snarls, and Sam stands up and walks away. By like, six feet, so it’s not exactly privacy, but it’s not like Dean gives a shit anyway, since he can barely control what comes out of his mouth. “What,” he hisses, looking at how fucking angry Cas is, Christ, he almost died, “should I say I love you too? Would that make a difference?”
“I didn’t want you shooting in that firing range because I didn’t wanna love you there,” Dean croaks out, his face hot. It’s the truth of it, though. “I didn’t wanna look at you— I didn’t wanna look at you and think, he’s beautiful. Not there. Not surrounded by guns, not firing a hole in a piece of paper made to look like a person, not—” Cas’s hand comes up to grip his and Dean shakes. “Cas, I didn’t want—”
. “No,” Dean had said on instinct. And then he’d walked it back, said, “I mean, you can. You can go anywhere you want. But, uh, the bunker is.” Dean remembers that the road had been so dark, and he recalls the unadulterated panic in his chest at the thought of Cas leaving, so soon after they’d got him back. “S’your home, if you want it. It’s.”
“I can guess,” Dean says, because his voice is wrecked. And normally around now he’d be asking for Cas’s dick as impolitely as he can manage, but something about this — about Cas, and about thanking him for hitting him — makes him more willing to see where Cas is going. He spreads his legs, and Cas presses in further, and it’s— Dean’s breath catches abruptly.
“Every drop of rain,” Dean says, like it’s something nice and not something that’ll always be broken inside him, the way things went with Jack at the end. His kid. And the way he treated him— it was like he didn’t know himself.
The end!!! Waooow. Thank you so much for coming on this journey with me. I'm so grateful to everybody who gave me such wonderful feedback on this work & others, which absolutely motivated me to finish this fic. I said I was going to leave more complete notes here, but I realize I don't have much to say. If you're coming back to this after reading this when it was originally posted, please don't forget to read chapter 7 (which I posted yesterday)!
Mom barrels out the door with her enormous bag of takeout, presumably because she must’ve actually ordered seventeen tacos like she swore she would after the fight. “Chimichangas for everybody,” she says, eyes wide at the stars above them. Sam thinks: you’re on your way out already, and you just haven’t figured it out yet.
“Shut up,” Dean mutters, but he can’t help smiling. Yeah. He has a— he has a crush. A goddamn crush. A goddamn crush on his gay— his gay
Cas’s hand slides up to the back of his neck, thumb soothing gently over his shoulder blade. Dean turns to look at him. I want to be yours, he thinks. I want to give you everything. Maybe that’s what gives Dean the gas to let it out, the way he’s never done before in his life, the way he’s never thought about it. He says, “I hate lookin’ at myself.”
“I think you were happy there,” Sam whispers, and he buries his face in his hands. In that universe, Jess works at a law firm and has regular dinners with her mother-in-law. In this universe, she was butchered at 23. Christ. What did she think was happening? Did she think it was Brady, just— that he was that kind of scumbag, did she.
, at home and in the car and anywhere else too — but he can’t. He isn’t built for it. He’s got no clue what’s real and what’s an act and what he’s doing just to keep Cas around and what he’s doing just for fun and none of it is what Cas deserves, not really.
“I’ll… I’ll check her schedule,” the person says hesitantly, and then Dean waits through two minutes of pleasant but grief-appropriate hold music, and then Mia picks up.
“Jack,” Castiel says. He steps forward. Oh, Jack— look at you. Your smile, and the tip of your nose. Your shoulders. You have the same eyes as your mother, you know. One day Castiel will tell him that.
Dean exhales. His chest feels like it’s caved in. He ruined it. He had it so good — had it better than he deserved, better than anything, best he ever had and he— he ruined it. “For what it’s worth,” he says, “I liked it. Everything we— I liked it all, I just—”
‘Cause Dean— all time has proven is that Dean is a man barely hanging onto decency by the skin of his teeth. He hasn’t got it in him. He just hasn’t got it in him to let Cas go.
Cas looks like a dream. That’s what Dean thinks — that Cas looks unreal, like something out of his imagination. He picks his way across the field in his practical boots and his comfortable sweatpants and his shirt busting at the seams ‘cause he still steals Dean’s clothes even though Dean’s about half the size he is, maybe ‘cause it makes Dean’s breath catch in his throat when he does. Dean wouldn’t know. Cas makes his way to a tree: a cottonwood sprouting up out of the empty grass, greener than all the rest of it. He stands and looks at it, and some bird — Dean wouldn’t know, he lives in a fucking bunker — cries out sharp and sweet, and the sun comes out from behind the leaves, rising in the east over the creek. Dean shoves his hands in his pockets and feels incredibly human.
“The only people who knew me before was Rufus and Karen,” Bobby continues. “Don’t think anybody but them knows I wasn’t born a man.”
“Get outta here, Brian,” Dean mutters, and thank Christ, he does it. Brian holds a hand out for the whiskey, and he strokes his fingers against Dean’s when he takes the bottle, and Dean— Dean flushes, red and bright and obvious under the parking lot fluorescents, and Brian pushes past John Winchester looking like he doesn’t have a care in the goddamn world.
He looks at the page, his handwriting awkward and cramped. He thinks about high school English teachers asking
Cas shifts back. “What?” His eyebrows draw together in confusion as he takes his hand off the table, puts it in his pocket, goes back to standing upright. “You’re not going to…?”
“That’s all right.” Mary stands there, at the kitchen island for a moment. When it seems like Dean has at least recovered enough to handle movement in his general vicinity, she pulls three cushions out of her couch. She puts two of them on the floor next to Dean, and sort of shoves him at them until he gets the idea and sits, leaning against the cushion propped up against the wall. She hopes he’s more comfortable.
“You look just like him,” she says, barely conscious of it, and then sees Dean flinch. “Oh, no, Dean—”
“Ask you to wait,” Dean says hoarsely. “Ask you to wait for me to have that piece. After all these years— when I shoulda figured it out from the start.”
“I know. I was there.” Claire blinks furiously at the gravel beyond their feet, and Dean shrinks, cowed. Easy for him to forget what happened to Claire’s family. What they did to Claire’s family.
“You’d think she’d realize we’re supposed to be the ones giving her advice,” Dean says, relaxing unaccountably in Cas’s presence. And then tensing, because he— he shouldn’t get to have this. Cas, looking at him like that, easy and generous, and Dean’s own hoarding, his own restlessness vying with his greed. He just wants Cas to look at him, and to stay.
“Happy coming out day, babe,” Dean says, hysterical but mostly fine, mostly okay with it, and he kisses Cas again just to prove it, before kicking back onto the road, ten miles from the bunker but already at home.
“I found this only a few weeks ago. This is the only gravesite I’ve found,” Cas says. He blows out a breath. “I don’t know why I come here. I can’t— it’s strange to remember a time when Hephael was close to me. When we were one. Hephael would have destroyed me for what I am today, although I… I’m glad of where I am, now.”
“That’s different,” Dean mutters. Maybe they’ll always be like this— at cross-purposes, simply because they’re so desperate to keep each other safe. Castiel looks at the curve of Dean’s spine and realizes that if Jack Kline is a threat, he— he doesn’t know what he’ll do.
Dean opens his mouth and there they go, kissing open-mouthed on the couch like a couple of teenagers, and Dean can hear Cas’s hand clench in the couch behind him as he moans, stifled, just once, just quietly, in the back of his throat. Fuck.
“Not when I’m pulling a literal angel who’s miles outta my league,” Dean says, because he can’t think of anything else. The problem isn’t the queer thing, or at least, Dean doesn’t think so. The problem is that the whole thing is a fucking charade that Dean— that Dean’s holding because he— or it isn’t, maybe he is in love with the guy, maybe this is just what it feels like. Maybe Dean just isn’t built to feel it right, because right now, it feels like he’s faking it.
, he remembers, incongruously, and almost laughs— the idea that Cas, Castiel, an angel of God, let Dean put a plastic dollar store cowboy hat on him. That Cas let Dean put him through a Western marathon on Dean’s memory foam mattress, squinting at Dean’s too-small laptop screen, eating day-old pizza out of the box.
Stiles was leaning against the back of the spiral staircase, head tilted against the wall as the guy (Josh or Justin or something) bit along his neck, proving every bit of what Crowley had promised him. Their hands were firm on each other’s waists, and Stiles was all too happy to stay in this moment for as long as he could, when a voice clearing interrupted them. Stiles blinked his eyes open, catching Lydia watching him before turning towards the kitchen. Stiles groaned, pushing off the wall and out of JoshJustinsomething’s hands.
By the time Boyd had returned home, finishing his own work day after five, Erica and Stiles had been camped out on the couch for a solid two hours. They made their way through one pint of ice cream, marathoning their favorite horror flicks from back in high school. Before Erica would let them pull out the second ice cream, though, she demanded they start on his hair. Stiles reluctantly agreed, which is how Boyd found him sitting with a plastic bag wrapped around his head, hints of purple clear through the cloudy plastic. He eyed them both for a moment before muttering, “You better not stain the tub with that,” before hanging up his bag and keys, grabbing his own bottle of water from the kitchen.
“Can’t,” Stiles rattled off without pause, “We’ve been going six days straight. I’m crashing hard when we get back tonight.”
“Whatever,” Stiles mumbled, unzipping the cases his drum set was packaged away into, kicking out his stands to hold the snares. If this had happened in any other town, he’d probably be just as proud and excited, but he was still reminded that this was the town he grew up in, that he left and stayed out of only to come back and have one of their biggest stints of success be so closely tied to a place he was itching to get out of.
John paused, ruminating over the comment. John had made similar sacrifices in his years leading up to becoming elected Sheriff, missing several holidays and celebrations for the job, giving everything he did his uninterrupted attention.
Stiles and Crowley had done this before, jamming together while the other two came back from the last one. The crowd seemed caught between bouncing to the harsh rhythm and heavy beat they were laying down and watching Dean and Cas. Dean had crawled over Cas, grinning when the crowd yelled louder. A quick whistle from the sides caught their attention through the haze of the performance, and Dean laughed louder. “Sorry, Sheriff,” he spoke lowly into the mic before digging his palm into Cas’s crotch and getting back to his feet. He helped pull Castiel up beside him, grabbing his ass when Cas turned back to his pedal board with a sharp wink.
by regular alcohol or weed, and being the Sheriff’s kid meant everyone thought he was a narc in high school.
“Obviously.” Stiles could imagine his dad was rolling his eyes at the comment. “We got one week left before we drive down to Palo Alto, try to make it home in time for us to have dinner together, you got it?”
Derek had opened the message, but it took a couple more minutes before he replied, a photo of his reflection from the mirrors behind the bar at Jungle. No caption, but Stiles felt his body grow warm at the sight of Derek in his tight fitted clothes. For all he said about Stiles thrashing around on stage, stripping out of his clothes as needed, he sure had room to talk. Stiles wasn’t complaining, though; he enjoyed the view.
“You ready to head to Lydia’s soon?” John questioned. Lydia was leaving for school before Stiles, and wanted to throw one last pool party before they parted ways. The entire pack, some kids from school that Stiles barely recognized when Lydia listed their names, and their parents were all coming together.
Besides Erica, and eventually Scott, no one knew the reason for the sudden shift between Derek and Stiles, and no one questioned it, but it was getting on Stiles’ very last nerves.
But then Scott messaged him asking what the section on mermaids said in one of the texts and Stiles realized, well, fuck, guess they still needed him to work for them after all.
“No!” Stiles yelled, “No, no, we talked about this.” He pulled the front door open, calling out to the delivery guy, arm waving the packaged book in the air.
These ladies were drinking steamy hot vaginas and Stiles screenshotted every single one sent his way.
“Hot shot future-lawyer can’t hang,” Gabriel shook his head forlornly while Dean pulled his brother in a hug.
Stiles shouldn’t have been surprised to find out that Derek wasn’t tending the bar that night, but he still looked over at the nameless guy preparing drink mixes while they punched their way through soundcheck. Any other day, he would have been happy that his phone had remained blissfully silent but the lack of messages from Erica made something in him twist uncomfortably. For the second time that day, as he felt the unease settling, he took a hit off the vape pen he had tucked into his back pocket.
”), so Stiles was meeting up with the boys on his own. He knew he was headed north, but didn’t realize where exactly until he finally plugged the address Dean sent him into his maps app.
“I did not think I’d be excited.” Stiles admitted, running a hand through his dried hair. They had enough time to get ready and head over to finish setting up at the club, having already dropped off their gear. He yanked open his duffel, pulling out the bag of stage supplies he kept separate for gigs. He started to drag gel through his hair, ends sticking up. “I thought you guys would’ve had to find a new drummer because I’d be passed out on the side of the road or some shit.”
“Sammy!” Dean’s voice boomed, grabbing his brother up and out of his chair and into a tight hug. “Shit, kid, you actually look like a real grown up.”
Stiles pulled up to the warehouse in a cab with Crowley, Dean and Cas. After packing up their gear, they had piled everything back into a locked closet the manager had showed them previously, where they could store everything so they wouldn’t need to drive back to the motel to unload before going back out. Stiles could hear the pounding bass playing in the abandoned building from outside, shoving his hands into his pockets when he got the urge to dive headfirst into the throng of people he could see through the open door. Crowley’s hand on his wrist kept him from walking in right away, stopping to look back at the smirk Crowley had directed at him.
“Really?” Derek asked, sitting up. “That’s a lot of time to be off.” He wasn’t saying it was a bad thing, Stiles could tell he was excited, but they both knew how much being on the road meant to Stiles—they fought about it enough.
“I know weed’s been legal for a couple years, but you don’t have to smell like the damn plant yourself,” John grumbled, turning onto the highway to head closer into town again. Stiles didn’t comment, leaning back in his seat and tapping his fingers together.
Stiles couldn’t wait for Monday, to get to sleep in before their next six-day block. After their second show in a dive bar where they’d frequented in the past, Stiles went back with Crowley into the motel room he had gotten for himself, all too eager and happy to hook up with the guy, riding the high of adrenaline until they were both blissfully fucked out.
Crowley turned around to fiddle with the dial on the amp, catching Stiles’ eye again, “Relax. Derek told me no. I took out the barback.” Stiles let out a breath he hadn’t realized he had been holding.
By the end of the show, Isaac and Scott ended up joining Erica and Boyd down in the pit, making Stiles wonder if Scott’s wolfsbane booze blend was put into their drinks that they had been ordering all night. It would make sense; Derek becoming a local bartender, local pack finally getting a way to take part in normal behavior like getting intoxicated out in bars. If he really thought about it, he might actually say the idea was near genius.
So, I've really started to notice how short the chapters are. Like really notice. So, here's a longer-ish chapter.
"I'm getting there," Sam promises. "When you said that it kinda sent me down memory lane. It was....8-9 years ago maybe but Dean, do remember when we got thrown into that weird reality where we were both both actors? Cas too."
They share a quiet meal together. By lunchtime, their little argument has been forgotten. They're seated at the map table looking over some newly discovered books when Sam comes out of the whole he crawled in since breakfast. "Oh thank god," He says, looking knowingly at the two of them. Sam had to witness the very awkward silence of their meal. This silence isn't awkward. "I don't think I can handle anymore angry glances."
“Five more minutes.” Dean mumbles, face full of pillow which only makes Castiel laugh out right. He positions himself so that he’s spooning Dean. Dean, the badass hunter who kills monsters for a living just can’t help but love being the little spoon. It brings a smile to Cas’s face.
He looks down at the man on his chest and his heart fills. What a journey their lives have been. It was quite difficult getting Dean to fess up about his love for Cas with everything John did to him. He and Sam both thought it would be best to let Dean figure it out on his own but it turned out he already knew. He'd known for years. Telling Cas in his own special ways. Of course Cas never caught on to those, but they were still there. It'd taken over three months before Dean looked Cas in the eyes and told him how he felt about him. How he loved him. How he tried not to. How his father had left wounds open that he didn't think he could close. How he closed them for Cas. How he spent nights lying in bed thinking of them as a couple. How he would look at Sam and Eileen and wish he could have something like that with Cas. How he was too surprised by Cas's confession to even speak. How when they got Cas out of the empty all he wanted was to kiss him but couldn't because of his father's cruel words. How he would tear himself apart when he thought of all the times he'd hurt Cas. How he avoided Cas after he got back so he could think of the right things to say.
Dean shivers and mumbles something Castiel can’t make out but assumes is what he’s been saying for a while now. He keeps clawing at Castiel as if he can pull him out of this. “No lo hagas cas.”
“It’s confusing. I can’t say it to you. Not even if it’s not meant for you. So the only way for you to know is if I say it to someone else,” Dean looks towards Miracle and repeats what he said last night. “I love you, Miracle.”
Sam walks in and smirks at the sight of Dean holding on so tightly to Cas. "Hey, I made breakfast," He begins. "Although, by the looks of it you might not be getting it for a while."
Dean looks at Cas's unoccupied hand and stares. He does this for what feels like thirty minutes before he swallows thickly. "I'm not happy." Castiel's eyebrows slope as he looks at Dean. This entire thing has really taken a toll on him. Dean, not being brave enough to say it for all those years and then his ability to say it altogether gets taken away.
“What can’t you say?” As far as Castiel knows, Dean doesn’t usually go around speaking Spanish. Let alone saying things like ‘Don’t do this, Cas.’

Cas sits up, a mixture of confusion and worry in his eyes. “Are you alright, Dean?” Cas asks his husband of six years.
"I do, although, I'm having a bit of trouble trying to figure out why that's important." Castiel states.
That's exactly what Dean does. He posts it on everything that will allow him to post a video that long. It immediately gains attention. Enough attention to the point where Dean and Cas decide that it would be a good time to go home.

Okay, lemme give you guys some background info cause I realized I didn’t do that before. The C*W recently decided to change the Spanish Dub from “Y yo a ti, Cas.” to “No lo hagas, Cas.” so I went ahead and made this. Basically, Dean can’t say it anymore because the C*W changed the scripts and it is affecting this version of Cas and Dean.
After a while, Cas had finally fallen asleep. When he wakes, it’s to the sound of low humming. He recognizes the song. Dean must’ve played it for him before.
After getting all the supplies needed for the spell and another goodnight's rest, they're ready to go. Dean is practically bouncing off the walls in excitement. He's constantly checking his bag or looking at the bowl in which all their ingredients for the spell are. Sam scolds him as he almost knocks over the bowl but Dean just smirks and glances up at Cas, "Ready?" He says with a big, toothy smile. Castiel nods in return. Sam starts to draw the symbol on the window of an abandoned gas market near the bunker. Once all is said and done, Cas grabs Dean's hands and starts to run towards the window. The jump out the window and come crashing down on a black mat.
It has been a week since Dean started speaking Spanish that one night. One week of Castiel not getting to hear the words he so desperately aches for. Its been hard. For the both of them. Piles and piles of books now covering their table, each having been read through front to cover. Dean has been very diligent with his reading, making sure he doesn't miss a single word. He also hadn't been getting any sleep. This worries Castiel. Deans never been much a sleeper, even if napping is one of his favorite things to do. At first it was one night, Cas had let it slide just because he knows how upset Dean is, but it was the next night too. 𝘐'𝘮 𝘧𝘪𝘯𝘦, 𝘊𝘢𝘴. 𝘐 𝘴𝘭𝘦𝘱𝘵 𝘢 𝘸𝘩𝘪𝘭𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘯𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵 𝘢𝘯𝘺𝘸𝘢𝘺𝘴. His argument was weak and Castiel could've had him in bed if it weren't for his damn stubbornness.
This is the end though. This was very fun for a first fic. I enjoyed it a lot. I probably am not sounding enthusiastic (how enthusiastic can you even sound like this) but it was. If there are any spelling errors, feel free to let me know. Hope you enjoyed <3
Dean is cuddled tightly into his side. Too tightly. That’s when he remembers last night. “Dean?” Cas asks, eager to see if he’s alright now. The humming says otherwise but Cas is praying he just has ‘Nothing Else Matters’ stuck in his head.
“Cas, baby, no lo hagas. Why can’t I say it? Please, I need to say it.” Dean cries and cries and cries. They stay like that. Cas holding his trembling husband and Dean mumbling ‘no lo hagas Cas’. Castiel has no idea how much time had passed but Dean finally goes still. He quiets down and stops gripping Cas as if he’s the only thing keeping him on this earth. Castiel’s head starts to turn. What was he doing? Why was he so scared? Castiel has only seen Dean Winchester cry a few times and it’s only for a good reason when he does.
“I have a feeling I already know the answer but are you okay now?” Cas asks. Dean shakes his head in response. “Okay, can you tell me what’s wrong?” Dean sighs and sits up. His eyes are red and puffy.
Sam had gotten back home three days after the mess had started. Both Dean and Cas had been too busy to text him. Sam wasn't the happiest camper about their secrecy but he was quick to jump on the fact that they needed help with research.  Last Castiel saw him was yesterday, at noon. His exit had set Cas's hopes high for the time being but he fears its being lost every second Sam remains in his room.
Dean cuddles into him and even with Cas’s foul mood, he can’t help but smile at him. He continues with his reading, a few things catching his eye but never anything that could possibly help them with their situation. He looks over at Dean again and whispers, “We’ll figure it out. I promise.”
“Dean, what are you doing?” That’s just before Cas sees tears swimming in Dean’s eyes. “Dean, what’s wrong? Why are you crying?”
"Well, I'll leave you to that." With that, Sam leaves. He shuts the door quietly, probably to make it harder for Cas to wake Dean up.
Now that that is cleared up, thank you all so much for the kudos and hits. It really means a lot. Okay, okay,,, continue reading :)
"He hasn't slept in three days, at least. I want to let him sleep more but I'm afraid my stomach has different plans." Being human truly does suck. The only reason he doesn't complain about it more is because of the emotions he gets to feel, especially towards Dean.
"Shhhh. Shhhh, I know, baby. I know." He sure as hell knows. He knows all too well that he may never get to hear 'I love you' come out of Dean's mouth again and its shattering his heart. Dean crying makes it pretty easy to lead him towards their bedroom. If anything can come of this, it could be a goodnights rest for Dean. For him too. He finds it very hard to sleep without the hunter by his side. He helps Dean get situated comfortably, then climbs in himself. He doesn't need to pull Dean into his chest because he's already there. His face is the crook of his neck, breathing shakily. Cas combs is his fingers gently through Dean's hair as he waits for his breathing to even out. It does, and so does his.
