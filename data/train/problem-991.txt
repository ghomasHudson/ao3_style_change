“Very well.” Sherlock subsided.
Sherlock took his time, exploring every inch, every vein. John felt the tide of his pleasure rise at the slightest of movements. His hips were rocking up, and Sherlock began to bob his head.
"Sherlock," he yelled, and this time, blessedly, Sherlock listened. "Run!"
"I regret, Dr. Watson, that I
"It's rare for someone to be so angry about an oversight. One sees it sometimes--it becomes monomania, but again, not Sally. I don't
“Such as it is.”
They say goodbye and neither one of them cries. Guglielmo flies back to England with a circle of teeth marks on his neck and tears in his eyes.
“We’d better be getting on with it,” he said, “if you’re going to make it home before dark.”
He wrote until his eyes were scratchy and his mind was quiet. His subject had barely moved, though the port and chocolate were gone.
"You don't? And yet you're a man of considerable intellectual power." Sherlock's eyes narrowed. "So you sublimate your intelligence. Why?"
A bake kettle is essentially a large Dutch oven, cast iron with legs and a tight-fitting lid, that could be hung over a fire or buried in coals to function as a pot or as an oven. This link provides a pretty neat example: https://hearttohearthcookery.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/img_8839-001.jpg
"I have some experiments I'd like to complete."
“I can’t have simple reasons to do something?”
“Bear.”
"If I'd known all I needed to do to get some tea was to seduce you, I'd have done it much earlier." John said.
“And when would that be?” John shook his empty lemonade bottle (“You can’t have water; it’s out of character”) and ran his tongue over his teeth. They were furry from the sugar, and he was parched.
“I didn’t want you here but now that you are you might as well be well. And I don’t want to lose my farm. Lettuce?” John asked, hopefully. Not terribly nutritious but it did contain vitamins.
They sat for several agonized minutes, waiting for the smell to get stronger or for the animal to burst from the trees, but nothing happened. Instead, the woods got quieter and quieter. Even the usually garrulous chickadees stopped “chee-chee”ing amongst themselves. John pressed his lips together; Sherlock became so still as to seem almost inhuman.  The woods were waiting for something.
“Fine. I was assigned to a regiment near Agra. I had expected the army to be hard work, but it wasn’t, and I didn’t know what to do with myself. I had learned during my training that I could not permit myself to gamble; and whoring was largely out of the question.”
“Your turn,” he said, trying but failing to give “smug” a wide berth. Sherlock took out a pocket knife and checked his.
Another example of Lestrade’s understanding. For the first time, John wondered how the more traditional Dimmocks and Barrymores would react if Sherlock helped with the food rather than the barn. He was less worried about Lyons, given what Dimmock had let slip once about his frequent visits to Lestrade.
John stepped over and locked it. He was going to end this now.
Uncle Gregory discovers John's trove of writing, with near-disastrous consequences, and John makes a solemn vow.
“He is. Or she. I can check, if you like.”
John himself lingered behind the barn on pretext of tying Harry up safely—a necessity—but also to regain his own composure. Watching Sherlock’s face as Frank penetrated first Clara, then Harry had been a special sort of torture. The dawning awareness on his face, the flush on his cheeks, and the tension in his trousers all pointed to one thing.
It took two whiskies and half a bowl of Angelo's delicious stew before he felt even a little himself again. Angelo, too, had been unusually silent. Suspiciously silent, even.
Knowing that it would be a dead giveaway to look at Sherlock’s trousers himself, John looked Sherlock in the eye. Sherlock looked at the ground.
John frowned. Sherlock’s face had taken on an innocent expression that he was learning to distrust, but he decided that he had better let the conversation move away from sensitive subjects like his own marriage.
The sun dropped out of the sky as he left Lestrade's, and he struggled to keep Arthur on the road. Thankfully it hadn't snowed, but by the time he got home he was chilled. The house was icy, too; he stoked up the fire and went to the warm barn. Harry was yelling her head off, of course, but food, water, and a chuck on her chin calmed her down, and him, too, really.  Maybe Harry would scare Sherlock off. Maybe, at the very least, she'd eat his undoubtedly extravagant clothes.
Sherlock laughed, and the air lightened.
John shook his head.
“To friendship!” Sarah exclaimed, once he had fetched it, and everyone raised their glass. Sherlock began to play an infectious tune, and it wasn’t long before they were all dancing, despite their heavy supper.
"Oh, I won't.
“You can tell me,” Sherlock said, barely daring to breathe. He could almost hear John deciding whether or not to reveal this secret.
As far as he knew, Stamford lived alone. How very interesting.
That Sherlock had left in a hurry seemed clear; the door had not been completely shut, and a layer of notebooks had been blown to the ground by a quick exit. Where could he have gone? John doubted that he was at the outhouse; he would have seen him, or hailed him. There were no animals in the barn to attract him, and the garden was empty as well.
John cursed. Just as awful as he thought. An odd, surly-or-talkative city boy. He wished Mycroft Holmes to the bottom of the Saint Lawrence River.
"Oh. I see," he said. His breath seemed to be coming short. "This is rather... stimulating."
“Such as?”
"Dearer still. Mrs. Hudson has promised me a pair from her new litter, but those are not yet ready. So beware of mice," John said, "Although if you want to experiment on those, we have them in quantity."
“Would that make good honey?” John rarely tasted honey; Mrs. Hudson did not keep bees, nor did Stamford or Lestrade.
“But do not agree with,”
“So?” Sherlock said, holding out his cup. He’d won potato wedges.
Damn it. The toilets.
“I haven’t seen it.” John admitted, “But I’ve been busy.”
Douglas Watson woke not long after, and as soon as he saw his son’s face he simply took him in his arms.
“This one is.”
“Jesus,” John said, and the wheezing began again. “Of course he wouldn’t like it, the fastidious bastard.”
“And you think I can’t manage them.”
Sherlock’s face was blank for a moment, then a soft smile transformed his face.
“It’s called ‘idiom’.”
“A romantic who likes to be comfortable.”
When John came back from the barn the few dishes were done, and Sherlock was on the settle writing in a leatherbound notebook. Sheaves of paper lay on the floor beside him. John thought he saw a picture of a fiddlehead on one of the pages.
“There’s no denying it,” Douglas said, shaking his head, “but you must persist. Show them your true heart.”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock said.
, that he
John snorted.
At this provocative statement, John’s cheek twitched, but otherwise he held his calm. Sherlock grinned inwardly. A shot in the dark, that had been, but a good one.  One of those lovers in India had been a man: Sholto? Possibly. Might be Mary’s maiden name, too.
I love Mike Stamford SO FUCKING MUCH I cannot even.
Sherlock, in response, ruffled his hair with both hands before flopping like a limp carrot on to the settle. His head was down, and one long leg draped over the back. He let out an enormous gust of a sigh.
For now, though, he would exercise his own rational will and extinguish the buzz of physical need that was affecting him. He looked intently at the salt pork as he cut it, concentrating on the jiggle of fat under his right hand and the sharp smell of brine in his nostrils.
“Never mind. ‘Romantic entanglement’ will do,” John said, very softly.
“A…” John snorted, a welcome sound in the still of the night.
“Self-preservation,” said Sherlock. “If I ignore her she’ll dump me off.”
John, still too muzzy-headed to do anything else, groaned. “You’re such an asshole,” he said, affectionately.
He did not wait for Sherlock; instead, in a hurry to de-manure himself, he quickly stripped, dumped his soiled clothes beside the large granite boulder that served him as a washing rock, and waded in. The water was pleasant to the touch, and he sank with delight under the surface. Clouds of filth came off him.
Sherlock tossed the paper into the garbage can with a flourish and brushed crumbs from his mouth.
"I like it," Sherlock insisted.
"No, now," he said, pulling away. He decided to lean on the pig's rail instead; he didn't need his shirt eaten while he was trying to perform a medical experiment.
He knew—knew as sure as he knew the sun would rise and set—that Sherlock would be pliant and warm under his hands. He knew that there was no debauchery he could perpetrate that Sherlock would not joyfully accept. He knew, too, that if there were not the double spectre of loss hanging over him, that he would spread those delicious arse cheeks and ready Sherlock with his fingers, and then his tongue. He shivered.
“Doubtful,” Sherlock said, feeling in the grass at the base. He stood up, and started pacing out ten paces in every direction around the tree. He took out a roll of string and measured the distance between the fallen tree and each tree next to it. Then, he noted each species present within that circle. But as for clues? Nothing.
John flinched. “I suppose.”
New about John’s past, that is. He could rely on his own observations for the present.
The rejected chapter title for this chapter is “Sherlock Is Bad at Riding. Also, Grouse Are Sneaky”.
"Unnerving, isn't it?" Sherlock said, when he’d returned and closed the cabin door behind him.
Sherlock tried not to shiver. The rain had not let up, and though much of their walk had been through the forest, his coat was wet and his trousers stuck to his legs. He wished he had worn his union suit.
“It will, for the fish that we’ll cook. We’ll save the larger fish for home.”
"You used your military voice on purpose," Sherlock said. "All's fair in love and war, is it not?"
(See the end of the chapter for
“If you must.”
I’m not sorry about the Lestrade/Lyons tension. NOT SORRY. And I don’t know why I never thought of shipping Sarah and Soo-Lin before. They are GREAT together. Please take it as read that Sally and Stamford eventually hook up, too.
"All right then. Can you tell me what you want, now?"
, that he had taken on certain daily duties that were, at times, onerous, and yet he maintained them,
“You are deliberately trying to provoke me.” John’s hands clenched, and Sherlock shivered again. The memory of those hands on him was enough to shorten his breathing and make him half-hard. He shifted, letting John see.
John Watson has made a life for himself in the backwoods of Canada. He’s alone, and it’s a hard life, but it’s his life, and it’s quiet. Then, in the middle of a blizzard, he receives an imperious letter asking him to take in a young botanist by the name of Sherlock Holmes. John refuses, initially, but dark circumstances force him to change his mind.
“Let me guess: you made many tutors quit.”
“John,” he said, as calmly as he could manage, “you are dreaming.”
“You do?”
His breath hitched and his grip on Sherlock’s hand tightened. Sherlock squeezed back, and John was relieved that he wasn’t hallucinating, at least.
“And be deafened? No.” Sherlock was as out of temper as John had ever seen him. He looked oddly ungraceful, folded up into an angular ball on the settle, his long pale feet sticking out towards the fire.
“Fire away,” John said, taking a sip of his beer.
"Dimmock! Come in right away, lad! Is your horse in?" Dimmock shook his head, numb; John sent him inside.
He was in foul mood by the time he passed, Mrs. Hudson's. Higgins gave his usual loud welcome, both olfactory and auditory, but John didn't stop to greet him. He pressed on to Lestrade's. The moment he pulled up, the door swung open before he could knock.
“I cannot offer you anything but my medical expertise, Sherlock… and my friendship, if you’ll have it.”
“No. I have the appropriate tool, however.”
“We’ll keep them out,” John said. Sherlock felt his own grip relax fractionally.
“I stand by my statement.”
“So you have an interest in…me? Sexually?” Sherlock persisted. His face was wearing its most alert expression; John, despite his flustered state, could not help but recognize it as Sherlock on the trail of an absorbing mystery.
"Rules!" Sherlock snorted. "You have got to be joking."
The bear—for a bear it was—moved closer. Sherlock buttoned his trousers as swiftly as he could and stood. He would leave, as quietly as possible, and he would walk to the cabin and ask John for treatment. If he did not, he risked greater things than Mycroft’s smugness: his mind and perhaps his life.
“I am an excellent judge of character.” Sherlock allowed his pride to show through his voice, and was rewarded with John’s small huff of laughter.
“I think it was terrible. Un
“No more.” He said. “Look to your mould collection instead. At least that doesn’t smell appalling.”
“I’m working towards a larger sample size.”
“Me? You’re the one that fires guns and stabs mantels when things don’t go your way. I remember what you were like before we started having sex.”
"A parcel? Tell me it's food."
"Good afternoon, Dr. Watson," came an unfamiliar voice.
The tea was ready. John ladled it into the cups, the heat of the fire delicious against his nearly-bare skin. Setting aside his own to cool, he took Sherlock’s over to the bed and attempted to rouse him.
“Sherlock?” John was holding out a cup of tea and a piece of toast, slathered with butter and Mrs. Hudson’s chokecherry jelly. Sherlock took it gratefully.
“Transport. My body is just transport.”
“I’m going to bend you over that settle again. Get the blanket,” John said against his mouth. Sherlock obeyed, his movements swift but a little disorganized. John found himself watching more closely than he had intended, savouring the submission, however small.
“I can. Lock the door.”
“That was worse.”
It was time, then. He laid down his axe, and went to the outhouse to fetch the massager.
“There are squirrel vertebrae in this bear scat,” he said, by way of thanks—and distraction.
No response. It was clear that John was irretrievably sunk into a brown study. He tried again.
“Sure. I’ll call in. It’ll be fun, a road trip.”
“Hello, Mrs. Hudson. How are you?”
“He can’t be wearing that cheap suit in Blair Water,” he said. “You’ll get what’s necessary to outfit him decently now, Martha, and stuff to make up the rest once we’ve arrived.”
"Be my guest," John said. "And, as for the geese, you may not kill or maim them."
“My answer is verbal: my brother can keep his great nose out of my business. Tell his courier that.”
He licked his lips, wanting to take it in his mouth but not wanting to push Sherlock beyond his limits. He wanted to see Sherlock spend, too, to watch the creamy jet of spunk shoot out onto his pale belly.
John's breath caught.
The next day, John is marginally more cheerful and Guglielmo is wearing different jeans. John inquires about Guglielmo's age. Guglielmo does extra work, all in sight of the farmhouse. The landlady watches. She sees Guglielmo strip his shirt off in the full sun. She sees John lick his lips and swallow down the last of a glass of limoncello and meditatively tongue an ice cube.
“But do tell me, Sherlock, exactly how I have lost my wager.”
“You are an idiot.”
There, a dark red bush. There, a crow’s nest. There, a dark stump like a moose. There, broken grass. Then, a chattering squirrel. Then, a flash of light where no flash should be—but no, it was only the sun falling low. He shook himself.
“She’s a friend of my mother’s,” Sherlock said to John, apologetically. “They were at school together.”
"Can I kiss you?"
“It’s good for you to have company.”
It is not a farm animal that we love.
“Don’t make that innocent face with me. You know full well there’s food in this wagon for you.”
“Thank you. I will.”
“Perfect. Now stand like you did before, and try not to shout.”
Relief enveloped him. His body had not betrayed him, it had saved him. There had been some slight delay due to new stimuli, perhaps, but that was understandable.
“Goodnight.” Sherlock replied, but John had already gone outside to relieve himself. He shivered a little as he came back in.
Many thanks to tiltedsyllogism for the perspicacious and useful beta read. Any remaining errors are my own darn fault.
I think that’s it! Let me know if you have any questions or comments, or if you see any typos. Come and visit me on tumblr, where I’m redscudery, or Twitter, where I go by @scudery. Thanks for reading!
“Do you believe in windigos?” he finally asked, after several miles. There was, after all, a great deal to be gained by asking questions to which one already knew the answer.
Sherlock squinted over at him thoughtfully.
“You will return to the home quarter. You will stay there, unless you have my permission to leave. Is that understood?”
“Had what?”
What John needed to do, he supposed, was to try it on himself. He thought of the birchbark pot of beaver grease that Mezenee had brought him. It was sitting in the open cupboard, and John stared at it, meditatively. He would try the procedure on himself, first, for lack of any other subject. It would put him at ease while performing it, and first-hand data was something Sherlock understood. He would do it tomorrow…no, tonight. Sherlock wouldn’t stir from the house, he had no doubt, and he could say he was checking on the goats.
"It is," John said.
The rejected title for this chapter was “Squirrel Guts and Disobedient Subs.”
“Let me check you anyhow. Can you stand?”
"A letter?" he asked, when Dimmock's teeth finally stopped chattering. "Why in heaven's name would you come out today? I'm surprised Lestrade allowed you to come."
When he came back in, Sherlock was sitting up on his pallet, hair mad and face creased with sleep. John felt heartened.
“It’s all right, dear. It sometimes catches people this way. Why don’t you go inside and make some tea?”
“Keep it quiet, mainly,” John said. He felt the urgency in Sherlock’s voice and marvelled at it. A brief moment, a tiny creature, and Sherlock was already deeply concerned with its well-being. John opened his mouth to tell him that the thing wouldn’t live, but closed it again. Sherlock would see soon enough.
If you skipped the panic attack, what you need to know is that Sholto had a kind of mental breakdown after Agra and sort of reverted to an animal state, gibbering and eating raw meat, etc. John had to smuggle him out of the barracks to save his life.
“My mouth is not just for decoration,” Sherlock said, and licked his lips.
“Dog hair, to be precise.”
me? Like a schoolboy?”
“Past trauma or present enemies?”
Sherlock was curled up on the settle under two blankets. His face was paler than usual under his flush, and his hands shook.
John had all he could do not to reach out to Sherlock then and there. He looked wrecked and vulnerable already, in the aftermath of their fright and their long, long day. Had it really been only that morning that they had arrived at Lestrade's, bread and axe in hand? John could feel fatigue in his own limbs as well, but he pushed it away.
Sherlock’s feet hit the floor, and shuffled towards him.
I went ahead and named the bull Byron because this is the internet in the 2010s and Byron can take it.
“All right, Sherlock?” There it was. Sherlock met John’s eyes—dark blue, so dark that they looked brown in some lights.
“I don’t think I can promise that,” he said, thoughtfully.
“Danger,” John said. “We’re always in bloody danger—or you are. No, wait,” he said, putting his hand over Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock licked it, partly petulantly, partly to feel the texture of John’s skin. John drew his hand away and used it to pin Sherlock’s shoulder to the ground.
“They were already rotten,” Sherlock had shot back, hoping for a smile. He’d gotten one too, a quick grin that showed John’s dour mood melting at the edges.
"Sherlock!" John practically flung his rifle to the ground and ran to him and pulled him close. "What in the almighty hell did you just do?"
, John,” Sherlock said, mock-haughtily, “Do keep up.”
“Delightful. See if I ever feed you again.”
"It's perfect," he said, and nudged Sherlock's mouth so he could bite that lip instead, worrying it until Sherlock had to laugh into his mouth. Then, John surged up, straddling Sherlock and pinning him to the bed.
“Finally,” John said. “I didn’t fancy that much, let me tell you.” He turned to Sherlock; though his hair was plastered over his face by the rain, his cheeks were pink and his face open. Clearly, he was not in the same danger of being overcome by the cold as Sherlock was.
It was, thus, all the more startling when a being dropped out of a tree before him. John had a vague impression of curls and long limbs and raggedy trousers before the boy--was it a boy? It must be--opened his mouth and spoke.
“Major,” Lyons said.  “John! How’s your city botanist?”
I actually forgot all about milking Isadora until I had finished chapter 12, which means I had left out approximately 120 gallons of milk from the story. I mean, I genuinely forgot, but also, for a farmer without a wife or partner to do the dairying, that much milk is really inconvenient. Nobody can drink that much, and it takes a significant amount of labour to process it. It needs to be strained (run through cloth to remove sticks and dirt and whatever), then left to sit so the cream rises to the top. Then it needs to be skimmed (have all or part of the cream removed) and the cream needs to be churned for butter. Hand churning is no joke. Then you’re also left with milk, which can be drunk or made into cheese or used in baking.
“I’ve never seen him since. He and his family moved to Ottawa not long after,” Sherlock said. “I didn’t miss him.”
“I don’t
Sherlock paused.
“Mike!” John stood to shake his hand.
“Poor babies. Destined to be raised by an imbecilic mother.”
“Sherlock!” John’s voice was sharp. Sherlock knew he’d have no peace until he’d answer the damn thing, but he’d be damned if the answer were anything more than “sod off”.
They stood like that for a while, despite the clear danger, until John felt he could pull back.
“My study was controlled.”
“I saw,” Sherlock said. “I started a mold experiment.”
“Nice...well, it’s home. But despite being a well-run farm, young lad, there are hundreds of magic places, where if you turn, just right, you can still see fairies.”
“I’m glad you think so.”
John snorted.
There were clear skies the next day, and the day after that, and the day after that. After what seemed like an age of wet clothes and of wrestling with wet wood and slippery axe handles, it was delicious to go outdoors and feel warm and dry.
“Privacy is boring.”
Sherlock did not kiss John anywhere for those three minutes. Rather, he made John stand, then drew his shirt over his head with inestimable tenderness, stroking his chest, neck, and shoulders, with his large warm hands until John was shivering and achingly hard. When the timer beeped, it was all John could do not to throw himself into Sherlock’s arms and drag him to bed, but he held firm. Very firm.
“I’m not! I am informing you, at this very moment, that I am not having it!”
Mike takes him to meet Sherlock Holmes in a morgue. It’s not cold any more; the sun is shining.
“You were a great mover yourself, Cyrus,” Lestrade said, his smile wide…too wide, John thought. He looked for Sherlock as though to confirm his thoughts, but Sherlock was nowhere to be seen.
“You may well be but I’m still not going to allow it.”
“As if I couldn’t tell sand from peat mud.” Sherlock took a deep breath, puffing out his cheeks absurdly, and submerged himself. John watched him swim slowly underwater—unnecessarily so.
John opened his mouth to protest.
What guaranteed their safety, there? A bear was one thing, but a person—a person with a bear, no less—quite another.
"I will not. Bacon and cheese sandwiches for supper, then, with green beans?"
“We spirited him out, finally. An orderly helped us—though God knows we didn’t deserve it—and I hid him in a shanty up in the jungle. I visited him when I could. I brought him food. But his humanity…”
He sanded it, sealed it with his seal and tucked it into Dimmock's drying coat.
“Not yet. Only if we have to. Best to keep it to ourselves just now, in case we can get other information.” John nodded, and they continued on.
“You’re an arsehole.”
“Indeed, despite both Mycroft and I demonstrating—with significant scientific evidence—that it was not worth their money. Their reasons were ‘other children’ and ‘social obligations’—terrible.” Sherlock shook his head.
“That’s a pretty significant increase in degree of difficulty.”
Sherlock stood still, smelling the air. The sound of an angry squirrel broke the silence.
“Time” Sherlock gasped, and John pulled away. He looked regretfully at the other nipple, but abided by their agreement. He kissed Sherlock’s mouth, softly.
“Maybe I do.”
The rejected title for this chapter is “Hypothermia is Hot (Boners Taken as Read Okay?)”
“Go,” Sherlock said. He already had his hands on the tree, pulling it out of the fire. John sprinted around the back of the fire, but could see and hear nothing unusual. He sniffed the air, on a whim, but no bear scent hung in the air either. It was too dark to see much of anything, and far too late to begin a search.
“I will, with pleasure.” John seized Sherlock’s upper arms and kissed him, hard. “I thought I could avoid it. But if I’ve been fool enough to put you in direct danger of a bear attack, how can bedding you be worse?”
The actual theme song of this chapter is “Common Disaster” by the Cowboy Junkies. The Easter egg is really the lyrics of the song itself; they’re a HUGE HONKIN HINT about how everything is going to go down.
“Proving a point.” Sherlock cut his cup.
"Look, stay away from him. Don't get entangled. He's not right, and he could hurt you. They…His family could hurt you." There was genuine pain in her voice.
“I should have realized the sack wouldn’t work. Maybe if I tied a string to their legs and made them fly…” He trailed off, his gaze now directed more intensely towards the geese.
Why could he not put her in her proper place? He remembered most people, and yet her exact place in his own past was unclear in his mind, hovering just beyond reach. He slapped the wall in frustration.
John rolled his eyes.
John Watson sat up. The brilliant blue sky and hot, fragrant air of Agra faded to the diffuse, chill light of a Canadian April, but Mary's face, half-obscured as it had been then, still floated before his eyes.
"Absolutely. It is impossible to mistake her utter commitment to medicine. That is where her considerable energy and devotion go. She has no motive, certainly, but more importantly she has no time for us."
“More than betrayal?”
John shook his head.
“I had to go,” John said, emboldened by Sherlock’s silence.
Sherlock had been on alert from the time they’d turned on to Scotch Bush Road. His ears were constantly straining for any unusual sound. He’d tasted the air every twenty metres, and halted their ride twice to look at the grass on the side of the track. The smooth grey light of the cloudy day was perfect for observation, at least.
“There doesn’t need to be a place to hide, John.”
"The lo….. No. I don't want to, and that's reason enough. Good day." John nodded to the young woman and turned on his heel.
“And, given your scruples, you are comfortable with this procedure?” Sherlock’s voice carried concern. About him. About John Watson. John steeled himself.
That was unlike him—a lisp. Indicated uncertainty. John wondered if he had been going to say “Never.”
“Certainly, Dr. Stamford,” Molly said. The boy nodded, smoothing his hair back. Something about his movement caught Sherlock’s attention; he felt as though he had seen that gesture before, often.  He looked again, but the boy had risen and his back was to Sherlock.
"Don't tell me you're going to be a pedant."
“Come with me,” Sherlock said, and something in his face overcame John’s reluctance.
"No distress?"
John turned his attention to his horse, Arthur, and the oxen, Jack and Hamish. At least
John was about to bite Sherlock’s lower lip again (honestly, that lip should be bitten at every opportunity) when the hairs on the back of his neck stood up. His spine prickled with the certainty that he was being watched.
All was not completely rosy, however. John had sometimes had cause to remonstrate with Sherlock. Though he cooked, he didn’t eat enough, for a start. He did not sleep adequately, either, and the scientific experiments he engaged in (often while he should have been sleeping) were often messy and incommodating. John had had to draw the line at dissecting animal scat indoors—especially on his few dishes—and insist that all experiments involving fire be conducted during daylight hours.  (Once, while attempting to compose a phlegm-inducing draught, Sherlock had become temporarily blinded and knocked a bread sponge into the fire, making the house quite uninhabitable for the better part of the night. They had slept on pallets of hay in the shanty and been chilled all night.)
They set out up the north line, John carrying their lunch, since Sherlock was burdened with collecting bags. Though the rain never stopped, their pleasure increased rather than decreased as John surveyed his land with satisfaction end Sherlock gathered new specimens. Their intercourse was characterized by an unusual comfort, involving though it did bickering, insults, and inattentiveness.
“Let me get you what you need, John: flour, yes, oatmeal, yes, and sugar, I know. More salt pork?”
Stephen Rinella’s hunting ethic is one of the least problematic out there: he believes in hunting for meat only and he’s careful about how he goes about it (on foot, knowing the area, etc).
“Thanks very much, Sherlock,” Lestrade said, sitting down rather heavily beside him. “Wouldn’t have been the same without you.”
Tags are now updated through Chapter 9.
Finally, John set off the double-seated buggy with its fringed canopy, Uncle Greg and Cousin Mike in the front and John tucked in with Great-Aunt Martha and Eva, in her basket, in the back, shrieking ominously. He turned around to watch the little, old, brown house in the hollow; it looked empty and brokenhearted, and a dangerous lump appeared in his throat. He stared forward, determined to maintain the Watson standard, but this was almost undone by Great-Aunt Martha’s warm squeeze of his hand. He smiled at her, wanly, and kept looking forward.
“It’s not that much scarier--!”
to finish getting ready, muffin, or we’ll be late and I’ll be the one in big, big trouble. Turn around.”
Bucky heard Steve opening the flaps of the box, and then pull something out of it.
Steve pouted at her behind his pacifier and gave her his best puppy-dog eyes.
Dwalin nodded; “Aye. ALRIGHT, LET’S KEEP MOVING!!!” he barked to the rest of the dwarves; now, instead of being surrounded by silent, sullen men trodding along monotonously, the group snapped out of their own thoughts and were back in full alert. Each member picked up the pace and passed by Thorin, who purposely slowed and fell back behind them. No one gave their King a second glance, save for Balin and Bofur, who both traded him knowing looks between him and Bilbo, then marching on without a word.
Stephen felt his heart break. Even the Cloak seemed to feel badly, as they gently swung Tony back and forth and brushed his cheeks with their soft fabric ‘hands’.
There, sparkling in the velvet lining of the box, was a crystal necklace in the shape of a snowflake. And in the center, there held tiny blue, purple, and pink stones in the shape of symbols from the second movie.
Molly hesitated. She didn’t want to let go of her new friend for an instant, but…
Right now, however...My’coff was very much Not Daddy. And that was why, even though My’coff was smiling at him and giving him very good cuddles, Jawn felt his chin start to wobble and his his face back in the crook of Mycroft’s neck as he began to cry all over again.
“When we’re drunk? You are,” Sherlock said, smirking as he watched Greg choke and sputter on a mouthful of bubbly and then shoot Mycroft a very dangerous look, his cheeks flushing.
Oh, Sherlock.
A quiet, stammered whisper floated up to Mycroft’s ear; “M-My’coff? Where’sh G’eg?” Sherlock asked, squeezing his arm.
Sherlock heaved a dramatic sigh; “Nooooo, My’coff, I–!”
“I wan’ My’coff.”
Jawn only shrugged again, and Mycroft couldn’t help but feel a bit disappointed...he happened to enjoy feeding the ducks as well, if anyone cared to know. So much for his winning streak.
"Ah, true,” Thor conceded, and placed a soft kiss on Tony’s clammy forehead. “Is there anything we can do to aid in his healing?”
So, here they were, with Sherlock strapped into his booster seat (to keep from having a repeat case of the Missing Detective) and fighting sleep with every fiber of his cantankerous being while John sat at the kitchen table, defeated, with his elbow propping his chin up and a dummy hooked over one finger.
It seems that he’d been outnumbered. “...Alright,” Mycroft said as he dragged his wig off, eliciting squeals from the little ones’ and a goofy, giant grin from his boyfriend. “ONE movie,” he said, raising his voice over the cheers and holding up one finger with a sense of finality. He then turned to Greg; “Get them settled in the sitting room,” he added. “I
“It does look warm…I may borrow it sometime,” Severus teased, his smile growing broader as Harry giggled at the thought of his Daddy trying on his bunny jumper.
Harry dove under the kitchen table and hugged himself to Arthur’s legs while he caught his breath.
Tony mewled, and snuggled closer.
“Then it’s a plan. But first–” Thor took Steve and held him out at arms’ length and narrowed his eyes; “–I believe I can kick your nappied butt all over Yggdrasil’s Altar.”
“I bet it can; it’s a good place to keep them safe.” Steve bent down and kissed his belly, making Bucky scrunch and yank his shirt back down. “St’aaaaahb,” he giggled.
...this had gone over about as well as a root canal. “Didn’t think it was that bad,” he muttered--they’d been asking for a scare, in fact...quite literally! That’s the main reason Sherlock loved Halloween so much! ‘
“Brat.”
“Y’ah!” Jawn agreed, and started to drag his bag of sugary-laden treats into the sitting room. “I’ds Ha’yyoween...it’s go’dda be sca’wy!”
Last bag. Okay. Dried pasta. Lentils. Box of cereal. Smaller box of…
hurt and no amount of “You’re okay, muffin!” could change the inevitable.
“You did–?” Steve started to ask, and then stopped when he noticed that, uh, Bucky’s pull-up was more than a little saggy. And yellow, where it used to be white.
“Aw, such good manners! Yes, that’s how we ask for things!” John stepped back over and let Sherlock watch him dip the dummy back into the mix, and then held it out. Better to let him come for it on his own terms instead of forcing it and starting back at square-fucking-one.
was tiny, so there might possibly maybe, be the smallest amount of one-upmanship at play.
Now, to let him air dry for a few moments. Thorin sat back on his heels and popped the cork on the tiny bottle of skin oil. “…Why do you fight it so?” he asked, since Bilbo seemed to be in a chatty mood and he could think of no better way to pass the time.
“No, I don’t need to.”
“Good, good, alright boys, inside!” Mycroft hurriedly ushered both boys inside, with Sherlock still protesting in garbled (yet indignant) words. “Before your bums freeze off!”
“Happy New Year, brother mine,” Sherlock held it out with two fingers at arms’ length.
Thorin chuckled to himself; stuffy little shit, always insisting that they had to be somewhere far away and private, even though everyone here’s seen everyone else’s bits from every which way imaginable…and some that you didn’t
“Let’s go find Daddy, hm?” Mycroft kissed the side of Sherlock’s head as he carried him out of the room. “You and Daddy can play while I make sure our Gregory gets all the rest he needs, yes…!”
It was Greg’s turn to smirk, as he was sure the gleam in Jawn’s eye wasn’t just the reflection from the sudden explosions on TV. He leaned over, bending close to Mycrofts' ear...close enough to smell the cinnamon-scented French soap he loved so much; “See, it’ll be alright,” he whispered, his breath warm against Mycrofts' neck.
...Wait. No, yeah, wait a minute.
Mycroft ignored him in favour of the baby. “Chewing your dummy again, you silly thing,” he playfully admonished, leaning in close to nuzzle Sherlock behind the ear with his nose. “You know better, but Gregory should have been nicer than that, shouldn’t he?”
, there you were!” Thor pantomimed the act of holding an infants head in his hands and sticking it to his chest, making a loud
But, no. None of those things. He was no where in sight.
true,” Mycroft told them, and swatted at their backsides. “Bathroom, now. And Gregory?”
“You heard me. Spank my hand.” Greg nodded towards it. “S’the least I deserve for hurting my muffin.”
“Just a little accident!” Greg called back over Sherlock’s cries. “It’s all right!” He rubbed what he hoped was a comforting hand up and down the little one’s heaving back, hoping that John would take that at face value and let Greg handle it, at least before--
Maybe it would help if he sat down.
“I did NOT punch you in the face…!”
Steve stood up, and squished Bucky’s cheeks in his hands. “Good job, baby!” he said, and landed a big, congratulatory kiss on the forehead.
,’ Greg thought. He didn’t think Mycroft was done...oh no, he would be a fool, with the jingly-belled hat and everything, if he thought it was over. No, this was a ‘to-be-continued’ argument, and those are the ones that he hates the most. He rubbed his face with his hands, held them there for a moment, and then sighed before walking into the sitting room and turning on the light.
Alfred continued; “…I can’t leave the room, sir.”
“He-ey, you’re getting good at those!”
“Here,” he said, and offered the baby his hand. “Spank my hand.”
There was another guttural, phlegmy growl but this time, the wolf’s head lunged at them and it took every bit of strength Mycroft had to keep Sherlock and Jawn from bolting from the kitchen as they screamed again and even though the room was still blacker than pitch, his entire field of vision went red…
Buck tilted his head as he regarded it…between Steve calling him in here and the look on his face, it was pretty obvious that whatever was in the box, was meant for him. And Steve was excited about it.
Every. Single. Time.
Jawn took the cup without a word, his eyes wide as he watched the vampire on screen pulling up the gas lines to the main characters house...and then setting them on fire.
Mycroft glared after him. “Here,” he said, plopping a very bewildered Sherlock back into an equally bewildered Gregs’ lap without tearing his gaze away from the office door. “Sort this out yourselves while I deal with the other one.” Mycroft straightened his back and, eyes still locked on target in the chilling way that a predator locks onto its prey, began to make his way to the stairs to follow John. “But the early bedtime stands as is!”
Mycroft  glared at him, his head shaking with disapproval. “Up all night,” he said again, and turned away from Greg to go join the boys in the sitting room.
“Because you don’t,” John repeated. “Because big boys don’t need naps, huh?”
Bucky sucked on his thumb as he considered the set up. “…I don’ w’ike i’d,” he said finally.
Tony went still; “A’w d’un…?”
Her response was to reach through the bars. “Sha’-sha’!” she pleaded, her tiny fingers grasping the air.
“Bubbles don’t count–!” Ron tried to ague, but Hermione interrupted him; “They do when they’re Drungus Umongus’s Unpoppable Bubbables!”
John huffed a laugh…of course he would. He handed it over anyway; “Just hold it where I can see it, too.”
He felt the beginnings of tears starting to prickle his eyes, and he sniffled. “Da’?...” he tried. His own voice sounded deafening after sitting in the silence of their bedroom.
“Shuuuut uuuuup.” John held out his hand. “If she’s not drinking it, give it to me. I’m not even close to properly pissed yet.”
Whoops.
“You want pizza? For dinner, you mean?”
wanted, darling,” he said with a pout, then reached out for Greg’s hand, and placed a chaste kiss on his knuckles. “Hurry back for a snuggle, my dearest.”
“Nooooo My’coff!” Sherlock begged, clasping his hands in front of his face. “C’n we s’day u’b??? Jus’d a y’ittle bi’d…?!”
“I’m telling,” Sherlock sniffed, but opened the door anyway.
“Your candy isn’t going anywhere, baby. Gregory will scoop it up and you’ll still have piles and piles of it tomorrow.”
-”Fi’ss!”-
Yet, it was cuter than anything ever ought to be, even if it did make Greg a little sad that his muffin was still upset with him. “Aw, why not?” he asked, turning on his own pout and batting his lashes at the baby.
It had easy to see that the soldier was struggling
“Hey, Tones,” Bruce cooed as he tucked Tony into the crook of his arm. “Yeah, I know, you don’t feel good at all, huh.” He leaned over and snagged one of the blankets draped over the couch and wrapped it around the little guy. “Well, we’re gonna fix that, yeah? Just as soon as Thor brings us a bottle, yes!”
Greg sighed. He’d been hoping they’d pick something a bit more slash-ery, personally--along the lines of Jason or Freddy, maybe even a bit of good old classic ‘Halloween’ Michael Myers--but he just couldn’t find it in his heart to tell Sherlock ‘no’ and dash that excited little face of his. “...New or old, love?” he asked, with the tiniest bit of hope for--
“Alright, baby, you wanna try out your new potty–?” he asked as he pocketed his phone and turned back to the room…just in time to see Bucky stand up and ‘flush’.
When he popped up, Sherlock was standing over him—how, John had no idea—his hands splayed out and a nonchalant look on his face. Before John could twist away he felt himself grasped by one arm (the undamaged one) and one leg. He twisted in vain for a moment; Sherlock’s large hands were very strong, and he could see that he was about to be hurled away into the peat bottom. Then, his training came back to him and he remembered something he had seen in hand-to-hand combat training. It would have to be modified for water, but it could be done.
, Sherlock.”
“I won’t. John,” Sherlock said, then hesitated.
“You like Lestrade,” Sherlock said musingly.
John couldn’t help but laugh.
"But only one room."
John could deny himself no more. He snapped the buttons on his jeans, freeing his cock to the cool, semen-scented air. He stroked once, then placed his hand on the wall for support, but before he could continue, Sherlock turned and took him in his mouth. Then, it was only a brief minute before John’s orgasm hit him, and Sherlock clung to him as he shuddered.
The sound of his name in Sherlock's mouth was very sweet indeed, and for a moment their mutual pleasure in the day and each other's company seemed to fill the dark pine woods through which they were riding. Then Sherlock saw some unusual mushrooms and leaped from his horse, causing Arthur to stop stock-still in the path, blocking John's way.
“Is… that… usual?” Sherlock could feel the unnatural tone of his voice, but was unable to articulate clearly.
"John!" Lestrade opened the door as soon as he pulled into the yard. "How late you are! I'd ask you to stop for a bite, but you'll be wanting to get home to the animals. If I'd known you'd be so late I'd have sent Dimmock over to do your animals."
As it turned out, he could not have been more wrong.
“You never know.” John turned and faced Sherlock head-on. “Now,” he said, eyes steely, “Get yourself clean and get into the cabin.”
“That’s…normal. It’s normal. It makes draining the prostate slightly more laborious, but it is normal.” John was glad when he closed his mouth. If he’d said “normal” again he would have had to slap himself.
“If you lose, you’re going to shovel the fucking steps for the rest of the winter. As soon as it snows.”
John was nearly shaking in anticipation. He closed his eyes against the sight, letting the sensation speak for itself. Sherlock's lips were on his navel—and then his tongue. John yelped.
“She’s better than most people.”
"No, this is the last. Given ten worms of between two and five inches, and given one inch per baiting, we have between ten and twenty-five worm units, which is sufficient to catch all the fish we can eat for a while."
He had known Sherlock experienced sexual response. It had been foolish to swim together; it had been worse than foolish to precipitate a wrestling match. He should have known that it would be unnecessarily stimulating when Sherlock could not, or would not, relieve his own urges.
Joe glanced at his father, dumbstruck. “And if I don’t like it?”
"Your coyote hybrid, I suppose... no. See here. The rules are simple and you will listen to them. The first: do not get killed or seriously injured. The second: do not make more work for me. I've got enough to do. Break these," John fixed Sherlock with the glare that had made many subalterns wish they were somewhere else, "and I ship you back to where you will have many more rules than this."
“I hardly think this courtship is concluded,” John replied dryly. “But, if you like… I could kiss you?”
“How many women within a day’s ride? We need to see their boots.”
"Nah, it's a living parcel. I left it sulking on the last ridge, but it should be along soon; it appears to be mortally afraid of bears--at least, it went white as a sheet when I mentioned the high bear population up at the caves.”
Idiot Horse snorted, as if in agreement. John shook his head—Sherlock coming to Idiot Horse’s defense was a new development, and it gave him a warm feeling in the pit of his belly—and dismounted. “Where are you?”
“Maaaaaaa.”
John stared at the four even slashes at the top of the tree.
John reached for his own cup, and Sherlock drained that, too.
Sherlock is also afraid of bears, for some reason. He is not, however, afraid of moose, and frankly, if you had to run away from one non-human entity in the Canadian woods, you should run away from moose first about 90% of the time.
“Excuse me, John Watson, but let me tell you that I have a right to read your books.  I am responsible for you now.  I am not going to have anything hidden or underhanded or immoral, understand that.  You have evidently something there that you are ashamed to have seen and I mean to see it.  Give me that book.”
“Bloody Christ!” John roared, his desire to laugh erased. Without a word, he seized Sherlock’s arm and helped him to the cabin.
Sherlock could have howled in frustration. He reached for John’s hand and held it. Then, when John was looking at him again, he bit his lip. John flushed red, looking suddenly uncertain.
For one suspended moment, he was aware of the ridiculousness of his situation: sitting on a log, his trousers around his hips, and his swollen generative organ in his hand. Then, another crash in the woods made him aware of the danger. His need had made him unobservant to such an extent that he was not even certain where he was—at the edge of a ravine, yes, but in the dark. A destructive, dangerous force, this chemistry.
“I am,” Sherlock approached him, expression honest and hand extended, “I am grateful, more than I can say, for you saving my life.”
“Don’t blame her. She was startled.”
The song for this chapter, as you may have already guessed, is “Hallelujah” (the Pentatonix version, which, Virginia, is NOT a Christmas carol), and do not @ me because I know and honour Leonard Cohen okay but for THIS fic Cohen isn’t the right version largely due to that particular song being insufficiently gay.
"I know there's more. Just..."
, John thought, listening to Harry’s desperate baa-ing.
The next morning, John woke alone; when he went downstairs, showered and ready for work, he found Sherlock asleep on the chesterfield, chest littered with cups. The knife, thankfully, was nowhere near him. John shook his head, kissed Sherlock’s cheek, and, after a brief look at the wasteland that was their kitchen, decided he’d get breakfast at Tim’s on the way. Grocery shopping could wait until tonight.
He took his first good look at the squirrel. It was a young one—very young, and small, though fully developed. It shook on the ground, and as he picked it up he saw that it had a bloody nose—not a good sign, but he said nothing. It bit at him, but its jaws could not close.
John begins school in Blair Water, and makes a friend...or maybe two.
“Oh.” John seemed a little taken aback at such frankness, but the tension in his shoulders eased a fraction, Sherlock noted, pressing on.
“What do you know about my ancestors?”
John had not been able to wait. His mouth was irresistibly drawn to Sherlock’s body, and he was reveling in it. Even after the swim, there was the sharp taste of sweat in the crease of Sherlock’s thigh. It tasted like bravery and fear at once on his tongue, and it drove John wild.
“You do love sweets,” John said.
"I am the last thing from pedantic."
“She almost never startles. That is the point of her, or so I was given to understand.”
It was one of the most intimate things John had ever done, under the most dangerous circumstances. With Sherlock there, stock-still in the middle of the room, with God knew what lurking in the woods, John unbuttoned his trousers and slid them over his hips. They fell to the floor. His cock, now only restrained by his drawers, bobbed up, already hard. Sherlock bit his lip.
“Let’s bring cheese to toast; I wager you’ve never had that before.”
“You are awfully concerned about my physical well-being, even though I’m an imposition and an inconvenience.” Sherlock looked at John sceptically. There was something there, but he couldn’t quite grasp it. Unusual…and frustrating.
He almost changed his mind when he got into the woods at the correct coordinates and realized that there was still a significant layer of snow upon the ground: rotten snow, which did not hold his weight, but made him flounder ungracefully and painfully. Despite his soaked trousers, however, he was unwillingnto return to the farm clearing; instead, he persevered, slowly, noting humps that could be stone ridges and depressions that could be swamps.
“My foot’s still stuck.” Sherlock said, not turning his face towards John.
“Yes, you have an interest in me?”
“On foot,” John said, “Though you do realize it means carrying our lunch.”
Sherlock looked at him with narrowed eyes.
“Where did you go to school?”
The gust of delighted laughter that escaped John at that moment surprised even him, but he let it come, bubbling up, until it was cut off by the receipt of a faceful of peat mud. He struggled, silently, for a moment, before ducking under the water to rinse his face.
John’s hands tingled.
Dr. Red’s First Aid Tips: DO NOT GIVE ALCOHOL TO PEOPLE WITH HYPOTHERMIA. OR CAFFEINE. THIS IS THE 19th CENTURY. THEY BELIEVE IN TESTICULAR CONGESTION AND PELVIC MASSAGE. DO NOT IMITATE THEM. (disclaimer: I’m not that kind of doctor but JFC even people with literature Ph.Ds, however sketchy, know stuff like this)
“It’s my aristocratic heritage.”
Eventually, Sherlock came back to where John was standing, hair disheveled and face irritated.
“It’s likely to drop more by the time the sun’s all the way down,” John said. “We’ll be lucky if it doesn’t freeze.”
“I want to really see you,” he said, and Sherlock nodded.
“Sorry,” John said. There was no help for it; he was going to have to take Sherlock by the very seat of the trousers. He seized the fabric.
John opened his satchel and pushed the tea and sugar inside. He looked around for somewhere to put the pamphlet, but decided the probability of it being discovered on the ground was worse than carrying it, at least for now. He shoved it into his pockets and headed for Angelo’s store, quite discomfited.
“More tea now,” John said, and Sherlock propped himself up on his elbows again. “How are you?”
“Smelled it, more like, but it was in the ravine off my south line last night.”
Still, John was reluctant to leave again. He put his rifle away and went back to hoeing potatoes without giving Sherlock another look. Sherlock, subdued, went into the cabin presumably to clean up the results of the morning’s experiment. He emerged some time later, smelling of soap and bearing bread and cheese for them both. John took his share and ate it gratefully; the sun was quite high in the sky by then, and though he had forgotten meals, his stomach certainly hadn’t.
“I suppose,” John grumbled, and drew himself onto the track behind her.
John laughed.
“Eat, John. The afternoon always feels longer than the morning.”
“I know. I do,” Sherlock said, and swung up on Idiot Horse, more or less gracefully. John mounted Arthur, more gracefully, and they set off.
“In heat. She needs to be bred.”
“And a dangerous threat to solve. Yet here we are,” Sherlock tugged at John’s hand. “Let’s sit,” Sherlock said. “Just for a minute.”
John took a long sip of his tea.
They sat in the back of the stands and watched a team called the Timber Wolves beat another team called the Timber Wolves.
“Sherlock, stand up.”
“Why would I?” The rub of the blankets against his cock had, Sherlock supposed, been pleasant. More than pleasant. His cock twitched.
“I bloody well am, and I’m bloody well going to do my job. You’ll stay here until we can both go.”
“Don’t be sorry,” John sighed. He looked Sherlock in the eye. “We both do. I just… I can’t.”
“I will,” he said, “if you promise never to run after a bear again.”
“Horrible man.” Sherlock’s voice was muffled by blankets.
It was so much worse than John had expected – and so much better. He coughed.
“One didn’t believe in circulation of the blood. Didn’t
“Oh, no, dear, he is quite unsuited to you. He’s utterly disinterested in our sex.”
"Do you know that your pa has only a week or two more to live?"
John paused.
John took a cold shower before going out into the -20 morning. He was glad he had, because somehow, in addition to his mysterious Tim Horton’s find, Sherlock had located a local pancake breakfast. Yesterday’s maple syrup had clearly given him the taste for more, and they paid their $10, collected their loaded plates, and sat down in the corner. Then the local Lions Club came by and handed out coffee. In Tim Horton’s cups. John glared at Sherlock, who was dipping bacon in maple syrup with the most innocent face in the world.
John felt himself flush. He nearly groaned. How had he thought that Sherlock's attention could not get more arousing? He would be diamond-hard before they even touched if this continued.
There wasn’t a single Tim Horton’s on the road between their last motel and the arena where the tournament was taking place, to John’s delight. There were no visible sources of those damned cups either, so he relaxed, marginally, and let himself soak up the atmosphere. Arenas hadn’t changed much since he was a kid, and neither had hockey tournaments. The noise level was utterly amazing, and the mingled smell of fried onions and hockey equipment pervaded the place. Groups of players, in identical coats and hats, roamed the halls and stands, and parents stood in clumps, chatting.
“I suppose,” Sherlock sighed.
Damn Mycroft Holmes, damn medicine, and especially damn his own useless self for being unable to draw a line between the personal and professional. Would he never be done giving himself trouble? He slammed his fist into the wall of the shanty, which lightened the load for a moment. Then, with bruised knuckles and an angry ache in his belly, John returned to the north field.
“I don’t like it,” Sherlock muttered. John rolled his eyes, but a small stab of concern shot through him nonetheless. Sherlock’s feelings were not to be disregarded.
“I did,” Sherlock’s eyes flashed in delight, “But that was during an experiment.”
“We can’t. And that’s final. It’ll have to wait.”
"You don't need to know." John licked Sherlock's ear. "It just is, sometimes. Does your thirst for scientific inquiry never stop?"
“There.” John had looked back, and as he did, he saw the faint outline of a bear. It was right beside the human figure. Right beside it.
“It’s thicker than my finger. Tell me if there’s too much stretch.”
“I was married. My wife died. I have no interest in marrying again.”
Sherlock smiled at him, still fiddling madly. Mrs. Hudson moved through the dance like quicksilver with Sarah; Lyons and young Joe, the latter blushing madly, followed. Molly, light as could be, promenaded with Stamford, who, though a heavy man, was an excellent dancer. Sally and Soo-Lin completed the set, laughing.
“Fucking NSY,” John muttered, pushing his damp hair out of his face for the hundredth time. “Couldn’t they have sprung for the deluxe accommodations?” The caravan window slammed shut on his hands for the fourth time.
"Carleton is barely a city, but, yes. And Sherlock knows all the local doctors on sight; he won't stand to be examined by them. But he lives for science, and since I know you have several unusual botanical specimens in this area, I thought perhaps he might be convinced to travel."
“Go to bed,” Sherlock said, and John started. He rubbed his eyes, and for a moment, in the dim light, he looked very young. Sherlock wondered whether he had smiled more before India.
They were definitely not alone. He could not have said what alerted him—certainly it was not a noise of any kind—but his eyes were drawn to a slender tree to his left. Behind that tree was a person. A small, slender person.
“Is it fine?” Sherlock asked. He was standing on the edge of the water, unbuttoning his shirt.
“I won’t joke,” Sherlock said fiercely, his cheeks even pinker. “I want us to be lovers. So do you. It is foolish to pretend otherwise.”
“Are you certain?” John asked, when his cock was slicked and aligned with Sherlock’s hole. “Tell me to stop if you need to.”
John let go of Sherlock, who straightened up and brushed his hands against his trousers.
Dimmock senior shook his head. “Must get back to the livestock. But we wouldn’t say no to a bit of a basket. Mother suffers from lumbago in her wrists and her pie crust isn’t what it once was.”
“Experiences.”
“The floss,” Sherlock said. “That may help. And how many makes of boot buttons can there be? I need data. Information.”
“I don’t know if you can. I don’t know if
“Please,” Sherlock heard himself say.
As you all may suspect, repeated nocturnal emissions will not damage one’s nervous system.
John trudged along the east line of his property, parallel to the track. He shivered. He’d been searching for Sherlock since Sherlock had fled the barn, but dark had fallen so quickly that tracking was almost an impossibility. The soft leaf-mould and emerging grass hid his trail, even with a lantern and John’s excellent ability.
“No.”
John doesn’t know how he lived. He’s more lonely than he ever was. He sits in his bedsit and fondles his gun.
“Very well,” Sherlock made a mock huff, and John laughed.
Then, Arthur reared. Swearing, John tried to control him.  Sherlock, startled, swung round in his saddle. Idiot Horse tried to compensate for his swift movement, but it was too late; Sherlock was already sliding from the slick leather.
"I am Mycroft Holmes."
“Sherlock’s all right, Soo,” Sarah said, already at Soo-Lin’s side. “He’s living with John.”
How did normal people live like this? Of the dozens of people his age in Carleton—encountering them had been unavoidable—most of them were married now, although not always to the people they had preferred. Had they gone through these same desires, the same uncertainty? The messiness and the loose ends were unbearable.
Again with the fresh fiddleheads! Okay, so there’s this south-facing slope near the barn by the lake and it warms up much faster than everywhere else. That’s where those are coming from. /foraging nerdery
Rejected title for this chapter was “I Just Happen To Have This Hand-Carved Prostate Massager Right Here.”
“Come on. Mycroft has important work to do.”
“I don’t think we’re in danger,” Sherlock said, “But the squirrel is definitely part of this equation, somehow.”
“Very,” John said. He rummaged in his trunk for his other set of clothes. “Just going to dress; turn around.”
Sherlock swallowed. John could see a glistening in the corner of his eyes but said nothing further, waiting for Sherlock to speak.
And waited.
“Flattery will get you nowhere, young man,” she said with a wink.
to make, a pun?”
It wasn't until he had gone outside that John's happiness was diluted by unease. Last night's encounter was the most frightening yet, and there was no guarantee of safety. He suddenly regretted being outdoors naked. He hurried from the outhouse to the lake and made quick work of his swim.
“All right?” came John’s voice, stead as it had been the first time.
John put his head in his hands. He ached—he did, he ached to touch Sherlock and yet he must not. He knew he could bring him relief, clear his head, restore his equilibrium! And yet,  he would not, because he knew it to be wrong.
“Alone, or with others?”
“Fine,” Sherlock said. John both heard and felt that word, and it traveled up through his body like a shock.
“Thirty minutes.”
“I’m glad you’re here with me, John.”
John glanced down but did not retreat. He moved into Sherlock’s personal space, challenging him.
“You will not. You will study the damn plants you came for and let me run my farm!”
John made no move.
"I'm really not," John said, standing up.
“Sho—Sherlock.” John pulled his hand back under the covers. His pulse still beat erratically. He shook his head.
“I brought lunch,” he said. His face was arranged in the type of pleasant mask that made John step back and analyze what he had in his hands before kissing him. It seemed to be only food, though; John set it on the table and wrapped his arms around Sherlock. He tilted his face up and kissed Sherlock’s long neck, then buried his face in Sherlock’s cold coat. Sherlock kissed the top of his head and hugged him back, a fierce yet distracted embrace.
“There’s always decaf.” Sherlock said, shuddering delicately.
“Fine,” Sherlock said with a sigh that threatened to shake the rafters of the cabin, and laid down his pen and accompanied John to the barn. As John took down the harness, Sherlock bypassed all the other animals, and came up short before the fowl pen.
“Like that?” John growled, grinding their cocks together.
“Don’t have enough data to say. Lestrade’s property, eh? Could he, or that boy…Donaldson? Davidson?”
Sherlock raised his eyebrow.
"There's no rush, John," Sherlock said, and seized his hip with one big hand. "I want to touch you."
“Very well.
"You are so beautiful," Sherlock said, then.
But would Sherlock? John felt an additional pang of guilt.
The first time he had rimmed Sherlock, John was sure he had been going to lose an eye, or a tooth. At the first touch of John’s tongue, Sherlock had bucked back towards the slick, wet pressure with such speed and enthusiasm that John had been caught off guard. This time, though, he was prepared. His tongue was sharp and pointed, and as Sherlock heaved back towards him, John let him sink back, for one brief and delicious moment impaled on John’s body. Sherlock cried out.
“John!” exclaimed Cyrus.
Re: smoking gross things you dry in the woods—what, you’ve never done that? I don’t even smoke and I used to try and make tobacco with all sorts of weird forest greenery.
He climbed back in, his own skin warmed by fire. He slid one arm under Sherlock’s neck, wrapped the other over his torso, and strategically tangled his legs into Sherlock’s long, cold ones.
“Of course not, Uncle Gregory,” he said, but there was an edge to his voice that made Greg sure that John would be kissing that cat just out of his range of sight for the next six months. He supposed it could have been worse, but wished his hastiness at the bottom of the well.
” Sherlock breathed. “Christ …
“Okay!” Mary held her hands up in surrender, her eyebrows raised. “Sorry, love, I’ll be serious from now on.”
, John knew it was the right decision to come. He looked up at John and smiled lightly, his green eyes melting at the sight of him as John ran his hands through his hair awkwardly. Sherlock looked just as beautiful as ever: this time his hair was coifed into casual curls, some falling forward to graze his forehead. He was wearing a pair of thick rimmed glasses which made him look charming and youthful. A white collared shirt was peeking out underneath a soft, tan jumper that was tucked into a pair of casual black trousers. He looked breathtakingly handsome and once again, John was lost for words at the sight.
“Mmm,” Sherlock was humming again, his lips vibrating against John’s skin. “You would?”
“Now?” John urged.
An announcement rung out over the speakers and suddenly everything was
John nodded, put on his coat, and made his way across the studio to the door and opened it to leave. He stopped when he heard Sherlock rushing over to where he was.
“Can … can I?” Sherlock was lost. He was lost to everything except the need for release, and John held that in his hand, literally.
“I …” John fumbled with his words. What could he even say to her that would make her understand?
“So that’s it then? You’re going to be one of those husbands who lie to their wife for their entire marriage? That’s not how these things work, John.” Harriet was unfazed by his outburst of aggression; instead, she continued goading him. “You’re a selfish bloody prick.”
John moved back and looked up at the window and still the dark eyes were watching John from above, impassable and scrutinising. John opened his arms wide, almost challenging Sherlock to come down as he took a few steps back to look up to where Sherlock was.
?” Harriet couldn’t stop her grin and she leaned forward gleefully, her hands spreading out on the counter. “Oh man, just wait till Dad finds out he has
And as Sherlock moved his hands to the base of John’s cock and moved his mouth over the head, John felt shuddering waves of
“Oh don’t worry about that, dear. It’s just a bit of water,” she said, turning to boil the kettle for a cup of tea. “You gave me a start standing out there in the rain. I was just about to watch a bit of Countdown, so I’m glad for the company. Do you take sugar, love?”
He was only just in time. The bear wheeled around on his hind legs, spotted the retreating body, and began to move.
“All right then,” John said. “What’s up?”
The moonlight glinted on John’s hair as he made his way down to the pond, and suddenly Sherlock’s breath was short from something other than nerves.
"So it is."
“He was worth caring for.”
“He was. So I had to come home.”
The door banged.
The next step, then. Replacing his hand on Sherlock’s lower back, John crooked his finger down and located the prostate.
“Transport.” Sherlock said, after a while.
. It’s just… you’re sensitive, and that’s fine.” John did not add that he had never seen a man come to crisis from prostate stimulation alone. He also did not add that it was one of the most erotic sights he had ever seen.
“Indeed,” Sherlock replied. His face was deceptively nonchalant and John could see that he had seized another ball of mud. He dove just in time to avoid it; the splash reached his ears as he propelled himself towards another area where the bottom was muddy.
The danger of love prowled about him, making its presence known.
"I'm really not. And why have you come so far? Surely there are city doctors that would do a better job." Mycroft's eyebrows rose at the word 'city'.
Sherlock looked at John’s face closely, checking for hints of concealed disdain or mockery, but there were none. There was only frankness, tinged with sympathy for what must seem, to a man used to the woods, foolishness.
Idiot Horse nudged him with her face.
“Good night, John.”
“Indeed.”
Eva was there that night, and though the Widow Turner sniffed at her she didn’t shoo her out. John fed her bits of soggy toast and underdone egg whenever she patted his leg with an almost human touch, her stripey face reproachful if he neglected her. She was an unbeautiful little thing, skinny and with crooked whiskers, but John loved her. She was a redoubtable
"If you are Sherlock Holmes I am." John said gruffly, conscious of a smirk on Mike's face that he did not quite like, "This is the place your brother meant to send you. Whether it's the right place is up to you."
John wished again that Sherlock was one of those men—those people—that did not wish for physical love. It would have made this whole situation much simpler. But no, Sherlock did desire, and they were in this situation because of it, and because John was honourable, dammit. He pressed his face into the pillow and tried to sleep.
“It would be very subtle. Perhaps a little perfumed. But it would be caloric, which you need during the winter.”
Not again. He could not reveal himself to John, and he would not lay himself out to be vulnerable.  He could trust his body to bail him out
By the time he got there, it was all over. Sherlock had the arsonist on the ground—he wasn’t short, John was pleased to notice—and the police were on their way. There was a pile of shredded newspapers and paraffin in the corner.
There was no-one there. Instead, a mummified dog, reddish-brown under a film of tan-coloured sand, lay on the doorstep. Around its neck was a tag that read, in a large, clear hand, “Redbeard.”
“As you say, Captain Watson,” Sherlock replied. The sound of those words in that voice was arresting, but John bit down any desire. He ladled hot water into the dishpan and washed his hands well, then emptied it out the door. Refilling the pan, he dropped the folded towel into the water and went for the beaver grease.
He had very nearly dug down to the clay holding the plough fast when Harry and Clara began to bleat. When Arthur began to whinny, and even patient Hamish looked up, he knew he had a visitor. Throwing his shovel down, he looked up to see Mike Stamford, the doctor from the bridge, coming down Scotch Bush road on his large, placid horse, Fiona.
“Please, John.” Sherlock reached out and covered John’s hand with his.
“Ungh!” Sherlock bucked forward and John lost contact with it.
“Sorry, sorry,” John said, and extricated himself from the pile in the only way he could—by rolling. Springing up the moment he reached solid ground, he extended his hand to Sherlock, but Sherlock had seen the sense of the rolling plan and was nearly out himself. John stood, to get out of his way.
John glanced up and wished he hadn’t. Sherlock’s face was soft, in a way John had rarely seen, and was all the more beautiful because of it.
The dreams began earlier than he had expected. Absorbed in sketching the sundew, Sherlock was startled when he heard John’s low groan, as if in pain.
“Very well. Idiot.” Sherlock’s mouth quirked, just a little, and John could not help but respond. He nodded sharply, almost militarily.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Don't touch it!" she said, pushing his hand away. "Your hair's fine, John."
John pushed through the exit and came to a standstill out in the snow, allowing the cold to filter into his skin. He flexed his hands automatically, trying to calm himself down and figure out what to do now – there were no more trains that would take him back home until the next morning, so instead he decided to call a cab to pick him up and take him back to his hotel for the night.
It had been a couple of weeks since he had seen or spoken to Sherlock, yet he still felt that deep sadness in his chest when he thought about him and sometimes, at night, he would call Sherlock’s phone, just to listen to it ring for what felt like years and end in Sherlock’s voicemail, his honeyed tones settling in John’s mind and infiltrating his dreams. He would always hang up before the beep, not really having anything to say anymore; all he needed was to hear Sherlock’s voice. He was confused because he knew he needed to move on from him and with his marriage approaching fast, he realised that he needed to figure out how to do it soon.
Harriet’s hard expression faltered and suddenly turned into resignation. “Listen, I’m sorry for blowing up at you. It’s just hard because the last time we spoke was when Dad was in hospital and now you’re suddenly here in front of me and … it’s all just too real.”
So I have to let you guys know, this was a big struggle for me to finish this and the following chapters. I've just become really ill and it as been affecting my concentration and ability to comprehend words, meaning writing has been very difficult for me.
John woke on the day of his wedding with a knot in his stomach. He was lying in his bed alone with Mary staying at a friend's house so the next time he saw her she would be walking down the aisle, glowing in her wedding dress. Everything had been leading up to this moment and yet, even hours before their wedding, John still felt trepidations about it.
As ever, let me know what you think <3
“I taught him to dance for his wedding – a surprise for his wife. He has a sturdy memory, Angelo – holds onto things – hence his friendship with me.” Sherlock answered, eyes moving over to where Angelo was serving another table. “He’s a good man.”
Sherlock eyed John for a beat, noting the light sheen of sweat across his lip and the jittering movements – he seemed a lot more uptight compared to when they were talking inside. Perhaps he was nervous about them having dinner together, Sherlock surmised with a small smile.
That was when he looked up and came face to face with her.
John couldn’t read whether Sherlock was happy to see him or just plain annoyed, but the fact that he hadn’t told him to sod off immediately was a relatively positive sign.
John turned and marched out into the car park, brushing unshed tears from his eyes. He wanted to turn around and tell Sherlock he still loved him, but he couldn’t. He needed to move on in his life and if that meant being with Mary, then so be it.
Once he was finished, he moved silently back into the bedroom and his eyes fell on Sherlock’s long feet poking out the end of the bed. He remembered the moment weeks ago, when he had removed Sherlock’s shoes, and the feeling he had felt when he imagined kissing them, loving them for their perfection and beauty. Unable to help himself, John perched himself at the end of the bed and slowly started to place soft, gentle kisses on the arch of Sherlock’s left foot, his hand massaging the other. He kissed along the arch, moving up so he could place singular, loving kisses on each perfect toe, and then moved up to Sherlock’s ankle. By this stage, Sherlock was stirring, a sleepy moan escaping his throat. John continued, his hands holding the blanket up so he could slowly make his way underneath, continuing his kisses up his legs, until he reach Sherlock’s exposed shaft, which was already somewhat erect.
Except then he heard his sister’s voice, breaking through his reverie, and her hand was on his shoulder, leading him to a seat out the front of the building, forcing him to sit.
was beyond John, but somehow Sherlock achieved that. John couldn’t help but imagine doing the worst things to Sherlock right there in the restaurant across the table, thinking about Sherlock crying his name.
John stayed silent, glancing at Mary out of the corner of his eye: her face had softened slightly, but he knew she was still slightly annoyed with him by the slight crease in her brow.
“Wow, tell us what you really feel, love,” John said with a small smile. He had called Sherlock ‘love’ before realising it was coming out of his mouth and he was worried Sherlock would feel uncomfortable with the term, however he seemed relaxed, watching John coolly as he drank his tea.
“Would you like a cup of tea?” Sherlock asked after a moment.
She peered at him over her glasses, raising her eyebrows at his soggy appearance.
Rain was showering down over London and it quickly dampened his clothes, creating a light dusting of moisture through his hair. He ran his hands through his it, not really knowing what he was doing. People around him were walking, hunched under umbrellas or sheltering under hoods as the rain started pelting down harder; many of them were hailing cabs to take them to their destination under the shelter of a car roof. John, however, just started walking, not really knowing where his feet were taking him, just following the footpath in front of him, and allowing the rain to soak him through.
He could picture Sherlock in his head, the way he looked when John had reached into his pants and stroked down his length. The soft pouting of his pink lips as he gasped out John’s name. The desperate trill in his voice as John caressed him, eliciting small whines from his mouth.
“So you’re going to tell Mary. When?” Mrs. Hudson raised her eyebrows at John.
John turned Sherlock around and pushed him to he was leaning over the piano, his arms stretched out in front of him. Grabbing Sherlock’s hips, John grinded into his clothed erection into Sherlock’s ass, relishing the sight of Sherlock’s prone form, his shirt riding up slightly to reveal the creamy skin of the small of his back. John leaned forward, pushing up Sherlock’s shirt further, and started to place wet kisses all over the exposed area, alternating between kisses and light nibbles with his teeth. All the while, the woman crooning out her lamentation of
"Shut up," she pushed the back of his head. "Finished. Go take a look."
“Excuse me, dear.”
That evening, over their dinner, Mary sucked in a breath, before reaching out and covering John’s hand with her own. He looked up at her from his food and felt his stomach flip at the sight of her serious expression.
“Okay, I’m going to—“ Sherlock’s grip on John’s hair tightened. “
“Well, I’m finished up for the evening and I know a place a block or so over that makes a delicious spaghetti meatball … if you are interested, that is?” Sherlock’s heart was in his throat.
"You're getting soft in your old age, mate." John said jokingly.
His whole body seemed to be numb; he realised he had been walking and was now a good few miles from his original location. He spotted a cab and, stumbling forward, flapped one arm out to flag it down. John jumped inside and vaguely heard himself mumble out the address of Harriet’s hotel.
As Charlotte continued babbling at John, his eyes travelled past her to a dark corner of the chapel where a figure, shrouded in shadow, was standing watching John's interaction. Suddenly, John felt goose bumps erupt all over his body and his hearing faded as he realised Sherlock Holmes was standing in his presence, here to see John leap into wedded bliss with Mary.
Sherlock’s voice sounded forlorn and small, and the way he was looking at him made John feel like his breath had escaped him. Sherlock was falling for him. It was so obvious. He felt as if he were watching a car crash in slow motion – unable to stop it and unable to look away.
John hadn’t thought about his life turning out this way, but somehow, with sleep dragging him under, and the soft in between lull coaxing him, he was glad it did.
“Can I kiss you?” John asked, his voice low and crackled with sleep.
“Well I’m sure with all of our lessons you’ll get used to me wearing them, Mr. Holmes,” John quipped, smiling back impishly.
“Can I see you before we leave? Tomorrow?” Sherlock asked. “I still need to take you shoe shopping because god knows I can’t be seen with you if you’ll be wearing those
The admission of love she held for John was uncommon and it made John shift uncomfortably in his spot on the floor. She was wrong, he thought. If there was anyone he wanted to avoid emulating regarding relationships, it was his parents. Both Harriet and John had seen the stunted marriage between their parents flounder as they were growing up, and they had also seen what can happen when a relationship like that is left to its own devices instead of being terminated once and for all.
Justifying his affair with Sherlock was becoming easier as time went on and the guilt was starting to lessen. He found it easy to tell Mary a lie wrapped in half a truth and allow it to spill from his lips like silk.  The only time he truly felt sick was when he thought about what Sherlock would think if he ever found out – he knew it would be over if he ever did, and John felt terrified at the thought, his stomach in knots whenever he allowed himself to think about the problem he had started too deeply. He knew, from last night, that Sherlock suffered from nightmares and he was afraid that if he ever found out about John’s engagement to another person that Sherlock would forever be tormented by trust issues which would prompt even more nightmares to surface.
“Even if it means Sussex?” Sherlock asked timidly.
Sherlock’s eyes fell on John, a depth of emeralds and oceans and pearlescent blue; somehow John was forever discovering new shades throughout them and at this moment, he was enthralled.
“Wh-what are you doing here?” John asked, suddenly very aware of the fact that Sherlock Holmes
’. The meaning was absolutely clear but it didn’t make John feel any better.
John stared out into the darkness, not able to find the words to even begin to explain what was wrong. How could he ever tell her?
John had left early the next day, a thick stack of invitations tucked inside his jacket safely. He was planning on heading to the shopping centre and posting out the invitations before he met with Sherlock for a coffee and (in Sherlock’s words) an upgrade in shoe attire. John still didn’t understand what the problem was with his shoes, but somehow, out of guilt, they were now stored safely at the back of his closet. John was unable to wear them without hearing Sherlock’s theatrical laments over how simply
. So don’t you dare tell me I’ve never experienced heartbreak when I’ve been battling with it my entire goddamn life!”
Sherlock didn’t react at that and merely looked at John, “What are you feeling like eating?” he queried.
“You think so?” Sherlock asked, almost shy as he grabbed a few sheets of paper and came over to John, gracefully sitting down in front of him, cross legged.
Next chapter includes copious amounts of sexual frustration and (because I'm a sucker for awkwardness) a sad wank. ;)
“Sit,” he pointed to the back wall, gesturing to the floor. “I’m going to show you a piece that you’re going to learn over the next few weeks. I’ve been working on this over the weekend and really feel it works for you. I’ve used movements that will allow you to have a solid grasp on several concepts that you can incorporate into other songs and dances, including freeform, which we used last week. This can be danced either by yourself, or with a partner.”
Sherlock’s response came through only seconds after John had sent his. His response made John smile, deep in his heart.
John Watson had always been miserable at dancing, especially when compared to Mary who looked positively perfect as she wove her way naturally across the dancefloor, allowing the music to guide her. In the beginning, she had begged John to come out dancing however after the embarrassment of the first few times, it seemed they had given up his attempts in favour of watching his soon to be wife shake her hips while he absentmindedly tapped his feet under the table and nursed a few pints. Now, however, what with their wedding fast approaching in the upcoming months, John had been overcome with the feeling of complete dread at the thought of having to dance in front of all of his friends without any previous practice. Which is why, after much deliberation, John had decided upon a private dance instructor (god forbid if he had to do public dancing lessons in front of others) and had finally gotten round to telling Mary.
“Sure,” Sherlock retorted, feigning sarcasm. “We can talk. You have—“ he glanced at the clock on the far wall, “—seven minutes. And then I’m getting on that train. Without you.”
John watched Sherlock grow smaller as the cab crawled away, merging into busy traffic. He mumbled his address to the driver, staring absentmindedly out the car window at the passing lights. It had started to rain, so the lights were slightly blurred and every so often, when the light hit him the right way, he saw his reflection staring back at him. He felt very nearly close to being drunk.
John attempted to suck air into his lungs, but he felt like he couldn’t get enough. He was suddenly overwhelmed and part of him wanted to say
John having dancing lessons with a man? Just make sure he buys you a drink after, love!”
Four weeks. That’s all that was left until John was going to get married to Mary. That’s all that was left before he had to decide whether to continue the farce that was his relationship with both Mary and Sherlock, or tell the truth to both of them and face the consequences. Four weeks. He told himself he would have decided by then what to do, when really he was nowhere near figuring it out. It felt good to pretend, however.
When John returned home, Mary was engrossed in an episode of her favourite cooking show, watching it on her tablet in the kitchen, flour dusting her cheeks as she followed the directions from the chef on screen. She looked as beautiful as ever, a deep frown gracing her forehead as she concentrated on the screen. Pausing the programme when John entered, she gleefully held up her mixing bowl, sending flour flying.
Also: Benjamin Britten who I referenced in the story was a well known 19th century gay composer who has a really interesting story, including his love letters that have since been released that he sent to his lover and partner of 35 year, Peter Pears. If you guys get a chance,
“Oh …” Sherlock wouldn’t stop looking John up and down, as if he couldn’t quite believe his eyes. “You … you followed me here to tell me that?”
“Right …” John frowned.
“Oh my god, Sherlock,” John breathed, his hand still on Sherlock’s cock. “You have no idea how much I want you. What I have thought about doing to you.
John stood in his doorway watching Sherlock go – he felt terrible and slightly dejected. John had told Sherlock he would love to show him where he worked, but that was not how he wanted it to go. Looking over at Marlene, she was regarding John with raised eyebrows.

, I’m going to come, John.”
“Do you?”
. He couldn’t stop his name from being repeated over and over in his head. He was better than cocaine and heroin. He was more addictive and he needed him more than he had ever needed anything in his life.
“Cake?” John quipped, unable to take his eyes off Sherlock as he sat up completely.
open to me.”
“Hard day, love?” Mary queried in regards to his need for hard liquor.
“Woah, woah, slow down. I have no idea what you just said.”
Marlene took the form and raised her hands in surrender, scoffing under her breath. “Alright! No need to get grumpy at me as well,” she said.
Sherlock sighed, his eyes closing. “Please … just kiss me.”
, but he was so desperate that he was shaking. Instead, he moved his hand back into John’s and gently turned his palm upward focusing on the lines on his palms which were slightly calloused.
, no … oomph.” He answered, moving over to the stereo and pressing a button on the front to switch to another CD that was inside. “We’re going to do an exercise that should help you understand the difference between what
“I know who this is!” Mrs. Hudson exclaimed gleefully, flapping her gloves at John.
John let out a hollow laugh. “It’s too late,” he answered. “It’s already over. Sherlock knows.”
John suddenly didn’t know what to say – he didn’t know what he could do that would change things. He could tell Sherlock he didn’t love Mary. That he would leave her. That he would do anything for Sherlock to at least give him one more chance. Deep down he knew all of those excuses wouldn’t be enough to fix what he had done.
A sigh from Mary. “I know it’s been a long day, but the least you could have done is acted like you actually
Mary was lying in bed asleep, her arm sprawled out onto John’s side of the bed with her book lying open, inches from her fingers. John undressed quickly and slipped quietly into bed next to her, switching off the light. He had attempted not to disturb her, but with the wine making him fumble awkwardly, she woke immediately, eyes opening and falling on John who was now lying in bed.
Pulling into the wrought iron gates of a large, stately private school, the driver slowed to a crawl, making his way through rows of parked cars and crossing people, all dressed in stylish woollen coats and hats, until he reached a taxi bay where he pulled over to let John out. John handed the driver his money before leaving the vehicle, immediately feeling the cold seep through his thick winter coat. Snow dusted his hair and eyelashes, melting upon contact.
Teaching Sherlock to make his bed was not something John was expecting to do on his first night with him, but it certainly made an interesting turn of events. Eventually, after multiple dramatic outbursts, John had banished Sherlock to the hall, while he made the bed himself.
Sherlock didn’t miss a beat and narrowed his eyes with a hint of suspicion at the odd request for Sherlock to leave. “You’d rather I wait out in the cold, John?”
Once both men were clean, they stepped out of the shower and wrapped themselves in fluffy towels Sherlock provided, padding with dripping hair and feet back down to the bedroom and collapsing on the bed, side by side. John took Sherlock’s hand as they lay together and Sherlock couldn’t stop the smile from appearing on his face.
, he told himself, running his fingertips over the cut on his lip.
Although John knew she was telling the truth somewhat, he still couldn’t help but feel defensive: he wasn’t
He didn’t remember Sherlock slipping into bed beside him; he only remembered sudden warmth and his arms wrapping silently around Sherlock’s waist, with soft sleepy kisses being pulled from his lips and placed on the back of Sherlock’s neck.
John was conflicted – of course he loved Mary, that much was certain. However, he had always been of the opinion that if someone cheated on their partner, then obviously they couldn’t have loved that deeply after all.
John allowed his eyes to close, enveloping himself in the feeling of Sherlock’s things, allowing the whispers of Sherlock’s essence to become entrenched in his mind. He wasn’t sure when he would ever be able to smell or feel him again and he wanted to hold onto this forever.
John rolled onto his side silently, placing one hand in front on the couch in front of him and without thinking, Sherlock delicately used his left had to intertwine their fingertips. Watching John’s face slowly begin to smooth out, he used butterfly soft movements to map out the shape of his hands and fingers. They had held hands before, of course, but for some reason, in this moment of complete vulnerability, Sherlock felt as if his heart were going to burst from his chest from how much he loved the man in front of him. Sherlock knew him doing this was a slight violation of privacy, that John hadn’t given Sherlock permission to be this close and to hold him like he was, but at this moment in time, all he could feel was John’s warm hand in his and his heart beating in his chest.
a big girl! decided that she wanted the breast…she really
John finally met his gaze, his eyes widening in feigned surprise. “Oh? You, you wan’ sh’ome?” He popped the dummy out of his mouth, and held the bag up to show him; “You want some of this?”
He stepped towards the edge of the bed and patted his chest with both hands. “Here, little fawn, come see Daddy…did you know I missed you very much?”
Well, that, as well as Jawns’ nappy...that had been changed. Twice. And Mycroft had been unable to wrangle the phone from him either time.
"Baby Steve being babysat by Thor and being upset because he wants Daddy Bucky???"
“…Fair ‘nough,” he grunted, and let his pack fall to the ground.
Severus chuckled…clever little shit. “It’s already tomorrow, pet.”
Sherlock snorted; “By putting you in a nappy first, duh.”
Mycroft rolled his eyes at the two of them; good Lord, he hated it when they started sniping at each other. It was cute when the boys were Little, with their baby banter, but when either of them were Big...it was just obnoxious. He continued on...
When his little Natasha, who would always insist that she was
John only laughed harder, though he should have told the baby not to shout. “So, you like it?”
She was sat on the back of it, as if it were a
Harry may have been put off when his fun was spoiled, but he could never resist Daddy-cuddles! He toddled over on his knees and fell against Severus with a small ‘oof’ from the man. “You mi’sh me?” he asked, propping his chin on Severus’s sternum as he blinked up at him.
“One bundle left from the elves,” Dwalin replied. “Top of the pack. We’ll have to find some place for a wash when we stop for the night.”
“Hey, punkface! C'mere for a second!"
brat. And, he was an admittedly adorable one.
“Keep everyone moving forward,” he said as he retied Dwalin’s pack. “We’ll catch up.”
Greg moved his hands and sat up; “I didn’t mean to! Not that hard!” he said. “He was chewing his dummy again, like you didn’t want him to, and I was just gonna, y’know, just tap him on the nose, all teasin’ like, and it slippedandhithimharderthanImeanttoandI’msosorrymuffin,” Greg finished in one winded breath, his shoulders slumping as he looked up at everyone pleadingly.
“He’s right, darling.” Mycroft was sat at the end of their bed, enjoying a nice glass of wine as he watched his boyfriend playing a game of dress-up with his baby brother.
I’ve loved every second of this past month, from gaining new followers and interacting with them more (both new and old), and writing new fandoms and characters that I’ve never written before, and not only starting a story but FINISHING it within 24 hours!
The bedroom door opened unexpectedly, and Jawns’ cry was cut off as he blinked at the sudden flood of light hitting him directly in the face. He pulled his fingers out of his mouth to cover his eyes with his hand, and peeked out from between them at the tall, slender figure who was silhouetted in the doorway.
“Sherlock Holmes? Your dance instructor?” A light tittering laugh was forced from her lips. “So you’re gay now?”
“So do you,” he replied.
“John?” Sherlock whispered, quickly doing up his pants and coming over to John, who was trying to compose himself. Sherlock placed a hand on John’s shoulder. “
Sherlock helped him, ripping his coat off in a flurry and discarding it on the floor beside them so John could resume his ministrations, his hands grazing down Sherlock’s back. Sherlock’s eyes closed as he felt John’s fingernails, a loud moan escaping his lips.
John knew this. Of course he knew it. Mary was like a shining beacon of light, perfect and enlightening in every way. Of course she didn’t deserve this, but she had been
John covertly glanced around the room, weighing up the possibility of someone he knew seeing them, before deciding.
“You’re a bloody idiot, John Watson.” Mrs. Hudson was stern, but beneath that hardness, she also sounded incredibly sad. “How could you do this to Sherlock? You saw how much he loves you. He wouldn’t stop dancing around his flat when he came home from seeing you; it made a right bloody noise above my tele.”
“Sherlock!” he rumbled, grasping onto Sherlock’s shoulder firmly and smiling at him. “It’s been so long, my friend! Anything on the menu, whatever you want – free.”
“Thanks,” John took his coat. “You can actually just call me John.”
Sherlock’s voice was shaky and underneath the low tone, John heard the sound of rattling and he knew it was too late – the bullet had gone through to his lung, puncturing it fatally. His jacket was already soaked with warm blood and when John pulled away the fabric to examine the wound, he let out a choking sob, seeing the blood continuing to spill out of Sherlock’s chest.
“Well that’s the first thing on your list. You need a hard lesson in honesty, mister.” Mrs. Hudson’s demeanour was harsh, her eyes suddenly boring into John’s intensely. For such a small, kind woman, she was suddenly intimidating and demanding.
John sighed, looking up at his wife with a frown of disbelief which prompted Mary to burst into a fit of giggles. The thought of John taking dancing lessons seemed to be too much for Mary to imagine.
As soon as Mary took in John’s dishevelled appearance and grave expression, she knew something was off.
“Oi mate,” the cabbie said impatiently.
gay child. This is so good—“
“Uh – sorry,” he took a deep breath, trying to quell his wild thoughts so he could coherently form sentences together and pay the driver.
“What do you mean?” Harriet urged, her hands coming to rest on John’s knees.
“No …
Eventually, John turned a corner and saw the entrance to the large auditorium. A banner with lights hanging over the top of the open door read:
Sherlock was blushing profusely, his cheeks growing a tinge of pink, and John couldn’t help but reach out and place his hand on Sherlock’s cheek, grazing his thumb over his hard cheekbone, feeling the soft, plush skin underneath his fingers. Sherlock let a small smile grace his lips and John’s heart fluttered at the sight. Suddenly, the café seemed to be deathly silent, all except for John’s beating heart and Sherlock’s shaky breath.
“I guess … when I see her tonight?” John didn’t really believe the words coming out of his mouth and he was afraid now that he had said them to someone else, they were now set in stone. It was all so much so soon.
“You nervous?” John asked kindly. He wanted Sherlock to know he was here for him. He wanted him to open up instead of closing himself off like he was doing now.
John felt Sherlock’s cock tighten and soon enough, hot semen was spilling into his mouth. Not wanting to disappoint, John drank it down greedily, sucking until Sherlock was flinching away from him, suddenly too sensitive to allow John to touch him any longer.
Mary flung herself back on the bed in mock dramatics, her arms lying out sideways so she was taking up the entire bed. “
John felt Sherlock clenching around cock and he bit his lip.
Slowly, Sherlock started to move, using John as leverage as he moved himself up and down guiding John inside of him. John groaned into Sherlock’s skin, slowly moving with him, feeling the deep pull inside his stomach that told him he was
“That’s it,” Sherlock breathed, pulling him closer as they moved to and fro with the piano. It was a relatively easy song to dance to – Dustin O’Halloran regularly composed music that would relax his clients and allow them to move with ease without any complicated noises invading their space. Sherlock didn’t like to admit it, but he was quite enjoying having a male client for once, especially one that looked as good as John Watson and who could dance as naturally as he did. “And we’re turning – yes, left leg back – you’re doing wonderfully … a natural, John.”
John was pulled up to his feet by Sherlock, watching in confusion as Sherlock pulled out his phone and pressed a button – a familiar song flowed out of the speakers, filling the room with its lamentations. John recognised it immediately.
“A … a friend,” John corrected himself.
with the need to kiss him, but having to hold himself back because he wasn’t a free man. Well, he was free now to kiss Sherlock as much as his heart desired, and as he watched a strand of hair fall in front of Sherlock’s eyes as he concentrated on removing John’s second shoe, puffing out his breath to get it out of the way, John felt like he could spend the rest of his days kissing Sherlock.
“Well, I was thinking, since it’s Friday, we could do fish and chips for dinner and cake to finish,” Mary gestured to her baking again. “That should make things a little brighter, yeah?”
John quickly glanced around to look out for the people talking and when he saw Sherlock accompanied by a tall, blond man heading straight for him he felt like he were going to throw up. Sherlock was engrossed in the conversation, so he didn’t see when John dashed behind a car to avoid him.
Before John got to the top of the stairs, he could hear the sound of soft classical music coming from behind it and although John could not name the piece, or the composer, it stirred some resemblance in his mind. John glanced at his watch again: 4:32pm
“Listen,” she cut in, still waiting in the doorway. “I’ve known Sherlock for many years and I’ve never seen him as happy as he has been when he’s with you. But the thing you need to know about Sherlock is when he allows himself to be, he is as loyal and trusting as anything. And if you do something to break that and hurt him, mark my words, John: it will be the biggest mistake of your life.”

“Mrs. Hudson!” Sherlock’s voice was raised and he stood from his seat. “If you have nothing better to do than stand there and comment on your perception of my personality traits which are
