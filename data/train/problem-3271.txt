Jask nodded, kissing him gently. “You’re right. You’re stuck with me for a while, and hell. Overstaying my welcome is kind of a specialty of mine, so I can’t even say for sure I’ll leave when the month is up. D might have to come drag me out by the hair.”
Jask clinked his bottle against Dean’s and chuckled. “Best friends, best sex, and a hall pass that never expires. Not to mention the financial benefits and the fact that I don’t have to tell you I love you. Yeah... we got it made.” He drank, letting out a satisfied ‘ahh’ as he set the beer back down.
“Seriously? Is it like... bad dreams?” Dean met his gaze again. “As long as you don’t jump on my bed and wake me up that way, we’re good. He used to yell it right by my bed just to fuck with me.”
and cleared her throat. “There are more coming in every day, though he’s finally getting some support. Sonny’s still cataloguing everything that even remotely
“Oh. Heard his name a few times. Why’s he called that?”
Sleeping still wasn’t an option.
“I wuv you like you wuv hugs, D.” Jask chuckled, reaching forward to turn the television off. “Let’s go, I’ll at least rub your back for you. Be a good little kept whore.”
Ares grinned and handed Cas the phone. He took it, holding it up to his ear and blushing. “Hello?”
“I dunno. I mean, he acts like he can’t breathe around me sometimes, and others he won’t even look me in the eye. I think he feels guilty for wanting me, but he doesn't have to. I mean, they both signed up for this too, and J is probably fucking his boyfriend already.”
Dean smiled, wanting another hug.
“I can tell. Honestly, I was expecting Dean to have something of a breakdown when he realized he was quite literally running for his life, but he seems… happy here. This is the most relaxed I’ve ever seen him, and next month it’ll be five years since I was placed in his employment.” Cas finished off his coffee and took his mug to the sink to wash it out, not wanting to be a pain. “When he wakes up, will you tell him I’ll be back?”
Jask shrugged, playing it off. “I’ll wear one for you whenever you want, but yeah. Boss says he found me a couple of jobs around here. They pay pretty damn well, so I don’t work every day, but usually two or three days a week.”
“Pshh,” he scoffed, turning back to his girlfriend. “He's right about the marshmallow thing… get me all hot and bothered and I get all creamy inside.”
Two fingers press up behind his balls as his cock disappears completely into that tight throat, and Dean loses the battle. He comes with a growl, emptying into Cas and humping his face through the aftershocks.
have a reputation to uphold, after all. He pulled up his photos and scrolled through, showing her the hundreds of bulldog puppy photoshoots. “Isn’t he the best?”
job while you were behind bars?”
“I didn’t— gross, never mind.” Dean finishes his beer and goes to grab another. “You guys get caught doin’ the doo in your office yet, Ares?”
“Answer it,” Cas said with a half-smile. He missed Dean already, and he was a little jealous Ares had been the one to get the call, but he understood.
His conversation with Sonny was short. They had a different relationship than the rest of the bodyguards on Dean’s payroll. They both had strong military backgrounds and understood each other on a deeper level because of it. Sonny didn’t question him when he’d suggested being the one to stay with Dean on every overnight beyond a cursory, ‘you’d be giving up what little life you
When Cas pulls back, his shirt and bare thighs are covered in come, and he's got that gorgeous smile plastered on his face. “You taste exactly as good as I hoped you would.” He leans back in to bury his face there, licking Dean’s balls and softening cock.
Relieved they were getting to the point quickly, Cas sat down and gestured for them to do the same. Ares complied, but Jask’s stance was defensive. “Please have a seat, Mr. Morningstar. No one is in trouble here, provided you’re capable of having a conversation about it. I have no more interest in involving Ms. MacLeod than you do.”
go with her, but he decided he to sit back and watch. He didn’t actually
Objectively, he knew they were right. His body was just about at the end of its rope, he’d been going nonstop for months and it had only gotten worse when he moved in. Cas licked his lip slowly and nodded, the reminder that he’d be of more use if he was well-rested was the only thing that stopped him from fighting it. “Fine.” He took one last look at Dean and turned on his heel, shrugging off his jacket and turning back to his room.
Dean didn’t realize he had zoned out until Jody cleared her throat. “Oh, hey there, what’s your name?” He asked the next fan.
Dean watches them, biting back a grin. When they first got back together, Dean was sad every time he saw them being cute, but now, he’s just happy for them.
“Good. I hope you feel me every single day, sweetheart.” Cas grabbed the lube from his hand and slicked a finger, sliding it inside Dean’s welcoming hole. “Mmm... still tight.”
fine.
Cas grimaced, turning to fully face him so his back was to the rest of the room. “Sonny replaced my phone. I didn’t get any of them... I’m sorry, Dean. I assumed you were going to blame me for this.”
“Sometimes, yes. But not in the way I should.” He frowned, like he felt guilty.
Something about the news that the most attractive man on planet Earth thought he was hot seemed to short out his brain, and Cas froze with the fork about an inch from his open mouth. Blinking, he realized he probably looked like a dumbass and finished the movement. “Sometimes I think I’m secretly crazy, I’m not sure if that counts or not.”
It doesn't take much to find Dean — he’s decked out in a light grey suit with fucking sunglasses on.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I have this
Cas was unusually quiet the rest of class, and when everyone gathered their things to leave, he stayed seated. He didn’t talk right away even once they were alone, but eventually, he sat up at his desk. “I didn’t mean to say they weren’t heroes. I wasn’t trying to be disrespectful toward them. Sometimes I just... talk.”
“Yes, but only for a minute.” Ares grinned and pulled it out, gripping the base while watching Jask’s reaction. His pupils blew and he let out a little grunt, his shoulders tensing.
He waited until Dean got situated under the water and admired the way it cascaded down the lines of his body, then climbed in after him. Dean hadn’t been kidding; it was a tight squeeze, but Cas managed to kneel down and lick up some of the liquid running down his thigh. It was too uncomfortable to waste time, so he dove right in, sucking quickly as he stroked himself and played with Dean’s balls.
The thought came to him like it had been the most obvious thing in the world.
Dean grunts as he lands, crawling away from Cain slowly. He can see Cas through the blood running down his face and he worries for him, not knowing how strong he is — but those wings spread wide and his eyes flash, and Dean gets the idea pretty quick that Cas isn't someone to fuck with.
“Fuck yeah, I do.” Dean nipped his ass and stood up, rutting his boner against him. “Let me blow you first.”
Cas turned just before he was about to round the corner out of the gym. “Yes,
Dean’s smile could light up the entire building if it wanted to, but when he realized Cas was inviting him on stage, he froze. Those beautiful green eyes widened and he looked around, blushing at the attention. “I uh... yeah.” He walked over slowly, waving awkwardly at the crowd.
“Cas.. fuck me. M’already prepped.” He wiggled underneath Cas’ weight and smiled as he watched Cas’ pupils dilate in pleasure. His growl spoke volumes as he rutted his bare cock into Dean’s. “Lube is right there babe. I need you.”
“Good to know.” It seems like a kind of stupid line to draw to Dean, but he respects the guy for sticking to his guns. He's just about to tell him as much when Azrian comes around the corner looking wet and delicious, and Dean forces himself to push his irritation at Frenchie and lust for the untouchable guard down to focus on what’s real and right in front of him.
“She is huh? Built ‘er from the ground up. How about we go for a drive first?” Dean waked them around and opened up Cas’ door, waving for him to climb inside.
He nodded a little, licking his lip as he kept working. “Yeah, I’d say so, his damn eyes turn hot fuckin’ pink every time he so much as looks at me. It’s kinda hot.”
“Of course I know. I’m the damn quarterback.” The indignation in his voice was clear as he turned to glare right back at Ares. “Quarterbacks aren’t gay.”
“Think so? Sounds kinky. Don’t go gettin my hopes up now,” Dean says with a wink.
Jask reached down to stroke him, biting and sucking on the back of his neck. Ares flattened out against the counter for support and rocked back as Jask owned him completely. “Mine,” he said, teeth grazing down his spine.
Dean chuckles as he carefully takes a small stack of them. They're heavy, like each one might be multiple pages long — and suddenly… he can't wait to dive in. “Am I allowed to open them?” he asks.
His hips rolled and he braced his hands on Jask’s knees, staying close enough to feel Jask’s knuckles furiously brushing against the fabric of his panties. “Fuck... I want this beautiful cock so bad.”
“Okay.” Cas reached around to squeeze his ass and then walked towards his desk. No one was inside yet, but Cas raised his hand. “Mr. Winchester, Sir. I’d like to fuck you on your desk.”
“Interesting,” Cas muses as he follows. “We have a human child, a… canine child, and a...
I trust them with my life.” They walked towards the set slowly and Dean turned to jog over to Benny. “Look... sorry about that. Hire who you need, okay?”
“We do, actually. Hold on.” Cas disappears, coming back out with an Ovation. “Will this work?”
is what he rebelled for. He lifts Dean up by his thighs and shoves him against the wall where the rebar used to be, sliding his tongue in his mouth. With two gentle glides of his hands, they’re completely undressed.
Jimmy retorts. "You're getting flabby."
therapist,
It felt so fucking good to use his actual name he didn’t wait for an answer. Dean sucked a mark on his hip and kissed his way to his cock. He could still smell Cas’ come from round one and drooled as he slid him into his mouth.
Cas frowns, but slides the wings into his pocket. “I made extra pie. Come on.”
“Holy shit. Marry me, Cas. I don’t care that we’ve already done it twice.” Dean grinned, kissing him again and then stood up gingerly. “Fuck. Note to self, I’m too goddamn old to wear a plug for that many hours.”
“Do I want to know?” he asks skeptically, but follows Dean out to the garage. When he sees the sleek black car, his grin nearly matches Dean’s. “Oh. This is Baby?”
“Your brother Sam?” Cas reaches up and gently touches Dean’s face. “I hardly think being drunk is an excuse for this. Come on, we need to clean up some of these cuts and then I'll make you breakfast.” He tugs Dean to the bathroom and pushes him down onto the closed toilet seat, then begins searching the cupboards for a first-aid kit.
Dean wrapped his arm around Cas, watching Jask and Ares apprehensively, but he didn’t look too worried.
And right now, he's thinking maybe it is.
“What do you
“Will you read it to me?”
Dean palmed himself involuntarily and bit his lip. “Fucking hell, that’s so hot. You’re fucking beautiful Cas... all of you.”
were ready to tumble right out of Cas’ mouth, but he was saved by a sudden jerk of the car as Dean hit the brakes. Cas sat bolt upright and glanced around in time to see a rabbit hopping off to the other side of the road.
He was in Dean’s lap in an instant, pushing him back against the couch. “Good. I was worried suggesting we throw the rule out the window wasn’t going to go over well, but this is one time I’m happy to be wrong.” Cas slid his hand down Dean’s chest but stopped. “We’re two consenting adults. None of this has to change anything. We’re just… two adults - best friends, actually - fake dating and having very
“Of course. Maybe not the way you or I do, but they absolutely communicate. One day they bumped into each other when they were fighting, I was tempted to separate them and teach them a communication game.”
The guard mutters something under his breath as his cock pulses and he fills up Dean's ass, humping him until he finally empties. He pulls out with a growl and squeezes Dean's ass, then smacks it hard enough to make the skin jump. “That's more like it.”
Ares did exactly that, sucking and moaning around his fingers so loudly that they didn’t even need the radio to entertain them. By the time they pulled in, Jask’s hand was soaked and he didn’t know if he’d even be able to make it inside. He shut the car off quickly and pulled Ares to him by the shirt, kissing him hard. “Fuck,” he muttered, breaking the kiss. “Okay. Go into H&M. Grab two shirts and head for the dressing rooms, leave your door cracked.”
“Who are you picking up?”
but when their bodies line up, Cas loses the ability to reason.
Relief and happiness coursed through Cas’ veins until he thought he’d float with it. They slid the rings on each other’s fingers and Cas kissed him fully, stopping only to laugh as the people around them cheered. “I don’t think I could love you more if I tried.”
Ares met his eyes, a small smile on his face and then he looked away. “When did you know? Is it something you always know?”
The Trickster comes up between them and wraps his arms over their shoulders. “Ohh, you don't wanna hear that. Sounds like a buncha cats tryna claw an old lady to death. However, if you're lookin’ for a way to occupy his mouth…” He points up above their heads to a cluster of mistletoe that definitely wasn't there two minutes ago.
One hand flew to the garage wall behind him in a vain attempt to find something else to hold onto. The fact that Dean was strong enough to hold him like that had Cas leaking so much his boxers were already damp. He rocked down, trying to be careful not to jerk too much as Dean pulled their bodies together. “Dean, that feels so -”
Ares cleared his throat and grabbed the remote, handing it to Jask. “Here, you get to pick. Normally we watch the news, but I’m open to anything.”
Jask snapped out of it and got dressed, then grabbed his iPod. “Ready?”
Cas rolled his eyes, but remembered he’d been in Dean’s position not that long ago and didn’t have room to judge. “You had better not be hungover for our date tomorrow.”
Nodding, Dean dropped his forehead to Cas’ shoulder. “Sure did, and now I’m sleepy. Think everyone will get pissy if we steal the pies and run?”
“The last — and arguably most important piece of Sternberg’s triangle — is commitment. Now, some of you might be sitting there thinking this will be easy. That commitment means marriage, or not engaging with outside individuals. You’re wrong.”
“I know. I might have made it up.” Dean leans against the bars once it’s closed. “Actually no, I’m sure I’ve heard it somewhere. How’s Mrs. Tate doing?”
“Yeah, I worked that out. But it's still true, wanna see?” Dean pulls out his phone and pulls up Facebook messenger. “I should be embarrassed by this, but I’m not. I had no clue you didn’t know how to use friggin Facebook. Here.” He leans in when he clicks on Cas’ thread and scrolls up to the same year he moved away, right when all contact with Cas ended.
first, then go on the date?”
Dean dove in hungrily, his hands running up into Cas’ already fucked hair. He could feel how much Cas wanted this too, and he was fucking
The office is actually kind of cozy. It's definitely more welcoming than the warden’s office was, at any rate, despite the walls being bare. Thursday sits down behind his desk and gestures to the couch perpendicular to it. “Make yourself comfortable. Do you need anything before we get started?”
Smiling, Dean grips the back of his chair and slides it over to lean against the bars with his guitar. The songs he plays this time are slower, lulling the blue-eyed man to sleep and when he finally succeeds, Dean takes a few moments to admire him.
He scooped up Havoc and made his way to the front room. “Yes, Your Highness?”
“Hah!” Jask said, triumphantly. “We were wondering what your shrug meant… I don’t think I should say what I thought it was.” He looked a little sheepish suddenly, and cleared his throat. “Sorry, though. If you were mine, I’d… well fuck, I probably should say that, either.”
decided to have mercy on ourselves. I don’t know how much longer I’d have survived it otherwise.”
Dean nods until his lips slowly form a smile. “Free... well damn, Angel. When you put it that way... I think we’re friggin’ entitled to some damn fun.”
Dean’s face was buried in the mattress, but it didn’t matter. Dean practically screamed, “Fuck! Yeah, please... fuck, fill me up, Cas. Come in me, fill me -”
When he opened his eyes, the well deserved hangover had him praying to the porcelain god and promising he’d never drink alone again. Dean would have never let him get so out of hand.
The name instantly brought to mind Dean Moriarity, one of his all-time favorite literary characters. He chuckled quietly, stepping aside to let Cain in. “Believe it or not, I just bought a fresh bottle. Come in, I’ll grab it for you.” He made his way to his bare kitchen and fetched the bottle, handing it to Cain with a friendly smile. “As far as my attendance goes… I’m probably going to pass. Crowds aren’t really my thing, and as you can see, I’m still settling in.”
“Probably not as many as I did.” Cas grinned sheepishly and took Dean’s hand, staring down at it. “I wondered if your hands would feel like Woody’s… I guess
Knowing the only name he’d remember in that bunch was Dean’s, Cas nodded like he’d committed all of those to memory. “My name is Castiel, and thank you. Maybe I’ll join a little later.”
If Lee’s right and this isn't just some kind of sick, cosmic joke, then it may end up being the best thing that's ever happened to him.
wanted to get to know him, and the tiny flutter in his chest was easily pushed aside for logic and reason… for now.
The second he looks over at Cas, all his doubts fade away. The Novaks have always loved him, why would it be any different now?
Dean rolled his eyes and opened the door. “Wait, how’d I get stuck with the hairy one?” He teased as Jask pulled him out the door.  “What are we gonna do, anyway? Get drunk? Cause I could seriously use a drink.” Dean kicked a rock as they walked over to Jask and Ares’ house. It had been a while since he’d been there, but when they walked inside, it looked the same.
He wasn’t ready to let go now that he had him, so he pulled their bodies together and smiled down at him, waiting for him to open his eyes. “I got you, Ares. Not gonna let you fall.”
knows Vonnegut.” After another chuckle he holds up a hand. “I should explain, he isn’t his boyfriend, I just call him that because they’re annoyingly inseparable seven days a week.
Everyone got quiet and looked around the room. “Not yet.” Sonny pulled out his cellphone and checked his messages. “Alistair said he is still in bed. Looks like Havoc bit his pants.” He chuckled slightly. “Damned dog. To answer your question, Castiel… no, he has no say. He would never choose what is best for him. Have you seen the videos of him and Jo at that party last night? He doesn’t make good decisions. He will be informed when he comes in today. I will tell him myself.”
“No, I don't. I was away on business, not personal matters.” Cas glances up at him and then to the others. “Does anyone else have a question like that, or can we move on?”
“Yeah, if he wanted me to.” Dean typed in his number and saved it, handing it back with a smile. “Wait, are you askin’ if I ever got laid on lunch? Cause nah, J didn’t like me dirty.”
“No, it isn’t. If they’re on your mind while another man is fuckin’ you, they’re there for a reason. Who is it?” Benny asked curiously while taking back the joint.
The moment the bedroom door closes, Cas pulls Dean in and licks into his mouth, instantly working on Dean’s jeans. He asks between heated kisses, “You brought your things, right? You're staying here once we kick them out?”
“Ah, fuck!” Dean gripped the bed happily. “Fuck yeah, Cas. Don’t stop. M’close.”
But doing anything sexual with Dean would mean pulling his attention away from keeping him safe, and that wasn’t an option. “You’re truly incredible, Dean. Every inch of you.”
Cas chuckled and pulled up some dental treats. “Here, this will help keep his teeth clean.” Starting Baby sent a chill up his spine, and nothing could wipe the smile from his face.
“It can't,” he says quietly, then gently repositions Dean so his legs are together. “But unless you have something that can, we have to improvise this time. Do you trust me?”
“Of course, Dean. Do you happen to know the recipe for this offhand?”
The bedrooms were all gorgeous with huge tapestries and four-poster beds, and after dropping off his luggage in the largest room, he decided to brave the stone stairs and see what was hidden underground before it got too dark outside. He walked slowly, refusing to acknowledge the rapid beating of his heart or the way the hair on the back of his neck stood on end as he hit the ground.
Satisfied that no one was creeping up on them, Cas took a seat at the small desk and grabbed his phone.
No job in the world was worth not giving Dean what he needed. Cas moaned quietly and took a step back, stripping quickly. “Did you bring supplies? I’m incredibly understocked here, given the fact that I don’t want anyone but you.”
Cas jotted down some notes and let his mind wander.
“You lost, buddy. I kicked your ass.” Dean forgot where they were and faced him with a wide grin. “We can come up with new bets.”
Huffing a laugh and licking his lips, Dean reaches out to slide his fingers through it. “That's friggin soft, Cas.”
how you always know what to say to make me feel better.”
"Well... baby steps, I suppose." He bit his lip too, and then seemed to realize what he was doing. "Sorry, I shouldn't flirt. Are you hungry?"
Dean shook his head rapidly and fished his phone out of his pocket, muttering, “Shut up.” He texted Cas, annoyed with himself at how needy he knew he sounded.
They made their way back to the car, and on the drive home Cas looked over at Dean. “We really didn’t watch much of the movie, did we.”
been kidding, but one look at Jask’s mouth had him shrugging almost involuntarily. “Hell yeah, right now. Fuck.” He palmed himself, then tossed his empty bottle into the fire. Chances were good he’d live to regret letting this happen since he had no interest in Jask beyond occasionally wanting to fuck him, but if he was gonna survive a year having someone as inticing as Cas dangled in front of his face… he’d take what he could get. “Let’s see if we can make your eyes pinker than Cas’, huh?”
before pressing their lips together.
“Yeah, I know a rhetorical question when I hear it, dipshit. Why don’t you just ask him?”
“I was making you wait, but you’re being so good.” He slid up Dean’s thighs and wrapped his left hand around his gorgeous length, stroking slowly and swiping his thumb over the tip. “You feel amazing, Dean.”
“I didn’t think people from Kansans
been. “This was a good choice.”
older brother, however…” He trailed off, pleased he finally found a way to tell Ares he was gay without crossing too many lines. He’d long suspected Ares was in the closet and desperately looking for someone to help him, but all of his attempts to broach the subject had fallen flat.
“Oh, sh— Cas...” Dean grips Cas’ old sheets and plants his feet, loving every second of his prostate’s assault. He tries to speak, but all that comes out is a muffled, “Uggnh.”
Dean walked inside the house, smiling when he could smell dinner was probably already done, and then kicked off his boots. “Smells amazing, Cas. What’d you make?”
“This is easily the best fucking birthday I’ve ever had.” Dean dropped to his knees, tonguing over every inch of his skin that he could reach. “Did you prep for me, sweetheart?”
His mind was still trying to cover from that ridiculous joke - he genuinely couldn’t decide if he loved it or hated it.
“What does that even mean, ‘not a good time’? You leave a note that says ‘I love you’ and then disappear without a word. Look, just tell me you’re comin’ back.”
Dean chuckled, imagining Cas stopping a fight so he could wash his giant, sexy hands — not that Dean’s noticed. “Dude was tryna cop a feel, huh? Asshat. All he had to do was ask.”
“Fuck... take it out, Frenchie. C’mon.” Dean kisses him again as Frenchie fumbles with his belt, and his radio pops off and clatters to the ground. He ignores it, ignores everything but the way their cocks feel when they're finally fisted in Frenchie’s hand.
Dean snorted, glad he wasn’t the only one already thinking that far ahead. “Nope, it’s
“That depends, I guess. How big is your elephant?” Jask grinned, heading over to lay back on the couch he missed so much. “Fuck, it’s kinda good to be back.”
“Yeah, right back at ya, gorgeous.” Dean slapped his ass playfully and wrapped his strong arm forward around Cas’ chest to pull them flush.
is right there in the room. You got your ‘one that got away’ back… both of you. Mine never will. He’s been in a different relationship for like a billion years now and he probably doesn’t even remember me the same anymore. So, why try? Just because I’ve given up on love doesn’t mean I can’t get laid.”
“We gotta get her home first, big guy.” He helped her walk to the car — hardly balancing himself — and when the car was moving, he pulled out his phone, not caring anymore. “Remember, life’s a bitch, bitch.”
“Yeah?” Dean bit his lip and tried to push into Cas’ finger. “Gonna have to stick somethin’ in there if you wanna hear me moan, baby.”
“Have you thought about why you care so much?”
A low growl rumbled through Cas as he nodded. “I haven’t been able to get them out of my head since the first time you touched my thighs.”
“You’re right, this way.” Dean interlocked their fingers for the first time and led him down a hallway towards a buffet. “Tada.” He waved a hand welcomingly.
Dean scoffed, looking down at the purple and silver streamers. “Those really aren’t my colors, Charles. And no, I think I’m good here.” He planted a kiss to Cas’ forehead, but Cas pulled back and tore some of the streamers to get free.
“We should get together... maybe play some pool.” He grinned to himself, hoping Cas got what he really meant.
“Dean! C’mere, boy.” Bobby pulls him into a hug and claps his back, laughing as he pulls back. “Ain't you a sight for sore eyes?”
in there.” Dean pulls Cas back up and sits him down, then climbs onto his lap facing the front of the car and lines him up. “Do that mojo thing, Cas.”
do we have things to talk about.”
He would have kept going, but he actually was tired so he only played the one and then set it aside. “Night, Trenton.” Dean made his way to his room and collapsed onto the bed.
“Prude.” Dean chuckled and darted upstairs, taking a quick but thorough shower before walking back down completely naked. “Come hither, Jaskier. My... what did they used to call dicks? Whatever, my dick awaits.”
Whatever she tried to say to defend herself was absolutely lost to her sobs as one of the cops handcuffed her. He looked at Dean and nodded toward the window. “She do this?”
a man upstairs and he fucking hates me.”
“Forty-seven is a little too old, but okay.” Cas grabbed his book and flipped it open with a smug grin.
He stayed on Jask’s lap long after their boners went down, and they enjoyed being close until way past when they should have gone to bed. Ares couldn’t bring himself to move, fearing that the separation would bring doubts, and that was the last thing he wanted either of them to feel.
Jask answered, giggling like a little kid. “Shit, sorry… your damn puppy likes to lick.”
Amara nodded to the stove. “Spaghetti and meatballs, so I suppose you’ll have to make do.” Dean walked over to help her dish it up, getting a little too close to her for comfort. She made some stupid joke under her breath Cas couldn’t quite hear, and Dean’s laughter filled the room.
“I like blue eyes. Maybe I’ll try and get on his good side instead.” He sits back with a groan and leans his head back. “That shit doesn’t work either, though. Nothin’ works in prison. It’s just friggin purgatory.”
“Of course. I believe he’d love that,” she nodded, stepping back from the booth so he could get out. Cas tensed in his seat, but also didn’t stop him.
Jask didn’t answer right away, he pulled Dean in and kissed him deeply as Havoc jumped all over Cas’ feet, growling playfully.
“Woah! What happened?” Ares frowned at his hand in concern.
for you.” He grinned that wide, innocent grin. “Get it?”
“What? Breakin’ up? Yeah. We’ll be fine, though. We went into this knowing where we stood, y’know? Even if he and Ares are just friends, we both deserve more than we can give each other. I imagine it’ll just be two days of catchin’ up, whiskey and bad tacos.”
“While I’m flattered, I think we both know I’m Velma.” Cas rolled his eyes with a smile and sat back, licking his lips in concentration. “I have… absolutely no idea how to go about this. Do you think we can just rent out one of those places? Like an escape room or something?”
“Yeah, he does have a car. And I’ve only spent a few weeks with the guy but if anyone could keep you off Abaddon’s radar, it’s him.” Ashton shuddered like he’s learned the hard way what Cas was capable of. “But I’m tellin’ you, you’ve gotta go
“How did you even know I’d be back?” he asked her, his brows furrowed.
“All mine. Only mine.” Cas reached around to stroke Dean while his cock perfectly rubbed his prostate. “Every inch of you is mine.”
“Awesome,” Ares said. “So we’re dealing with a monster. Let’s go see what room number two has to offer.”
When the sun started peeking through the crack in the curtains, Cas began making coffee. The machine was old and louder than the last, but he managed to get the first few sips into his system and Dean’s cup mostly brewed by the time he heard movement from the bed.
Cas grinned and started grabbing everything else to take it back inside. After a couple of trips, the grill was clean, so Dean followed him back inside. Cas shut the dishwasher and nodded toward the pie. “We better hurry.”
Dean would smile if he could, he loved feeling his partners come apart just from his mouth. He still wanted to bend P over and show him his true calling, but maybe next time. He slid him down and then pulled off with a pop, gripping his own leaking length tightly, but not stroking. He released a
Ares laughed and spoke a little louder for the others to hear. “Dean had to wait even longer. Ain’t that right, Dean?”
Dean collapsed onto the bed, running his hands gently along every piece of skin he could reach until his mouth was moving without catching it. “Wanna see you... need to see you, P.”
“Bu—”
some damn release.
“No.” And yet, another one landed in his mouth, anyway. Cas never could deny him.
Max knees him in the gut in an attempt to push him off and spits on him. “Fuck you, Winchester, get offa me!”
Dean’s always loved edging. Pushing yourself to the brink of release and then having the willpower to stop, it’s exhilarating, even if it’s really fucking hard sometimes. This time proves to be harder than some, and he stops all contact with a whimper as he teeters the edge. “Ima good boy. Ima good boy. Fuck, fuck!”
“I’ll cancel. I don’t care.” Dean huffed a laugh. “Fuck all these people.” Cas’ phone started ringing and Dean frowned. “That asshat?”
Cas didn’t look at them. “It was nice, I suppose. What sort of party did you two attend this time?”
Cole had Dean bent over the back of the couch in about three seconds, but somehow hadn’t hurt him at all. “You’re right,
Thanks for reading. Let's hope the finale of SPN is even better. 😉
The photo attached was of someone in a low-rent Batman costume facing a sunset with a guitar slung over his back. Cas’ heartbeat sped up as he stared at it, memories flashing through his mind of all the times Dean had said that exact, stupid phrase to him — and the more he thought about it, the more plausible it seemed that the picture came from a pilot Dean had shot as Batman that never made the air.
Turning around, he shook his head to spray Cas and smiled from ear to ear. "Thanks, I feel the same about you." Dean pulled his lips between his teeth adorably and put his hands behind his back. "See... paws off. I can be good."
Dean pointed at the office door. “When I graduated, I didn’t think I’d ever get called to the principal’s office again.” He shook his head and eyed the silver name plaque. “Thank God I got over that principal kink, huh? Rowena isn’t my type.”
“Just… come lay with me,” Cas said softly, holding out his arms. “We just have to make it a little bit longer.”
He tilted his head against the back of Dean’s so his nose was grazing Dean’s hair, and it struck him in that moment that he’d never realized how good he smelled. “I don’t think even
Cas tipped his head back as he rubbed his thumb over Woody’s tip and felt the wetness there. That video yet again played in his mind, and the thought of that delicious, hot come coating his fingers soon had him moving even faster.
That night, Dean couldn’t sleep if the Sandman paid him.
Dean shifted as Cas bent his legs and let them drop to the sides, fully exposing himself. He was thrusting up, but barely, seeming content to let Dean do whatever the hell he wanted.
He regarded her with all the skepticism their storied friendship called for, but ultimately decided to trust her when his stomach growled audibly enough that she pointed at it. “Fine, fine. But if you so much as mention the name ‘Dean’ I’m running away.”
“Dean!” Cas ran up and stopped in front of him. “You’re all wet.”
The truth of it rings through his bones and he moves as much as he can without hurting either one of them, chasing both feelings. He comes with his alpha's name on his tongue and paints the table in front of him, even as the mix of come and slick starts to make him dizzy.
Adam grimaced and Cas acted like he couldn’t hear him.
Jask leaned over his shoulder to read with him. “You do need to learn to appreciate me more. I wake you up with bacon and blowjobs at least twice a week, and you repay me by being an asshole. Think we should try it?”
There was no telling what happened in that room before Cas had come in, but he could make an educated guess based on the angry crowd and the bodyguards trying to keep them at bay.
Dean doesn’t know how to feel, and honestly, he just wants to leave. “Okay, so say you
Being virtually all muscle, that was also something Cas hadn’t heard often. He chuckled quietly and then realized he left his gun on the desk. “I appreciate that, but I need to go get my gun.”
“Fuck…” He slows, drawing back and easing in until he's completely empty, then reaches around to stroke Dean twice. “Soon. You did so good, Dean.”
He only gets through one Zeppelin track before he falls asleep, and as usual, his dreams are filled with bright blue eyes and messy, black hair.
“Ah fuck... Castiel!” Dean whimpers as he comes, the long drawn-out groan afterward further proving he was edging before this. The thought of Dean giving it up to a stranger after all of that… to
Anger pulsed in his veins and it took every ounce of training he’d ever received not to beat the guy to death in the middle of the hallway. “Fun’s over, get the hell out before I do something you’ll regret.”
too well.” Cas closed his eyes and let Dean take care of him, feeling spoiled. “I’ve never showered with someone before.”
Cas took a deep breath and let it out slowly, focusing on relaxing each of the muscles in his body. He was still so wound up with need and lust he could barely focus, but Dean’s finger buried itself in him to the hilt. “I’m sorry, I… I don’t know if I’ve ever wanted anyone or anything this badly.”
Castiel was jolted awake by his favorite obnoxious redhead - or used to be favorite. Right now, not so much. “Cas! We have to get back to packing. You napped for two hours.” She looked at his face and sat up straighter. “Was it him again?”
“Ask myself the same thing, Cas. Every day.” He pulls him in for a kiss just as it begins to spill from his ass.
Cas should’ve been prepared for the sight of Dean half naked with sleep-tousled hair and a grumpy expression, but it didn’t matter how many years he’d been around... that wasn’t a sight someone just ‘got used to.’ He walked over, pulling the covers off of Dean. “Wheels up in thirty. If you want to get coffee first, we need to leave now.”
He was beat by lunchtime, but the moment he saw Cas, he smiled.
“I gotta be honest, my dick is complainin’.” Dean chuckled and kissed down Cas’ neck so softly, he couldn’t believe it was the same man that was just consuming him with that desperate kiss. “He wants you... all of you, sweetheart.”
Dean walked over by the trunk and leaned against it. “Heard you have a lotta tattoos… gonna share with the class, Betty?” He was still doing his adorable grin he knew people couldn't resist… well other people, apparently not Cas.
Dean grunted and gripped the sheets below him. “Ah fuck! Goddammit!” He growled and pushed back, taking the challenge.
“We could. And he has a projector... I think it would work well against the back of the garage. Should be dark enough we could watch a movie.” Cas read over it again. “It says we need decorative lights or candles... and blankets.”
One of his other students bombarded him with questions about her project the moment the bell rang, and Dean blinked at her for several seconds while she forced the whole thing out in one breath. “Breathe, Ms. Harvelle. Breathe. It was open ended for a reason. You can pick any topic as long as it’s related to American history, and you can use any medium you want. Powerpoint, an essay, a model. As long as you teach us something about whatever topic you chose, it’s alright with me.”
Cas groans, reluctantly pulling his fingers out and sucking in air. “This is the last time we hang out with them for like a solid month,” he says.
morning.” Dean grinned and rolled Cas onto his back, kissing the taste out of his mouth. “My turn.” He teased Cas’ nipple with his tongue and kissed his way down his body, giving his other hip a matching hickey and then wrapping his eager lips around Cas’ cock.
elderly conquests.”
He sighed at the sound of the front door closing and eyed the little dog as he came pattering into the room. “Well, Havoc… I guess we’re left behind.”
A huge, stone hand was wrapped around the base of his cock, and his mouth was slack like he’d been close to the edge when the sculpture decided to capture him. It was one of the most erotic things he’d ever seen, and his mouth watered slightly at the sight.
Dean chuckled and licked his lips. “They might be for kids... I just wanted to come home.”
“I’m not the right person to ask about that, Dean. I have no idea how these things work.” He stepped forward, stopping right in front of Dean. “But you should know, that no matter what happens... you still have my protection. Whether or not you’re famous. If you choose to give it up, I will do everything I can to continue to keep you safe.”
Dean tells himself as he walks back to the bar parking lot for his car. A woman walks out of her home in a pantsuit and eyes him like he’s diseased or something, making him look down at his shoes.
The whine was past Cas’ lips before he could stop it. He set the last dish down to dry and ignored how badly his hands — and whole body, for that matter — were shaking, and tried to keep his movements fluid as he finally glanced at Dean. “I promise you, neither you or your subconscious has anything to apologize for.”
Benny leaned over the bar until his face was close enough that Cas could smell the booze on his breath. “Kiss me then, if I’ve gotta babysit you all night and won’t even be able to get my pretty mouth around your pretty cock.”
“I feel the same about you.”
“I don’t think I’ll need to take it that far, but… we’ll see how I feel after ten minutes with David Yeager,” Cas joked. “We better get some sleep, then.”
“Whatever man, you coming to work tomorrow? Or gonna lie again?”
A quick search for Dean’s name on Twitter had his stomach rolling uncomfortably.
Alistair didn’t waste time, and he was a way crazier driver than Cas was. They pulled up to Sonny’s office way friggin quicker than they should have, and the douchebag got out, not bothering to open Dean’s door.
Today was no exception as he leaned up against the wall while Dean and Jo ran through a sex scene for what felt like the twelfth time. Each take had him a little more uneasy and a lot more jealous. Logically, he knew that Dean’s marriage to Jo would be a publicity stunt at best, and the scene they were currently acting out would never be real, but it still made his stomach churn in protest.
He was just taking off his suit jacket when someone knocked on his office door, and he sighed heavily. “Come in!”
For a moment, Jask considered arguing with him after the insults, but one look at Dean’s naked body had him nodding like an idiot and dropping to his knees in front of him. However, he did have one little punishment at his disposal. “Surprise, you get to use your own hands. My face will be here for the cleanup.” He smiled cheekily, sitting back on his heels and getting comfortable.
Dean bites his lip and turns as he unbuttons his pants, slowly exposing that gorgeous ass that already haunts Cas’ dreams.
Cas squeezed him, trying to embrace him in a way that would somehow shield him from the world, even though Cas had already proven time and time again that he couldn’t.
“I love when you have jelly legs, sweetheart... almost as much as I love being the cause.” Cas chuckled and laced their fingers together. “How’s Jaskier? I think he might have stopped hating me.... maybe.”
“It shouldn’t be this hard to get laid, Cas. Jask hasn’t even called in weeks.” Dean walked over and plopped next to him, as if there weren’t at least ten other places he could have sat.
His eyes widened. “What? You were… young.” Cas blushed again, then dropped his eyes. “I was just out of high school.”
Abaddon looked like she was about to cry for the first time in his entire friendship with her, then yanked her arm back and stormed off toward her locker. Nick chuckled, draining his milk jug and standing up. “I don’t know about you guys, but I’d love to get that impending meltdown on tape.” He dashed after her, leaving Cas alone with Jimmy.
“Thanks for helpin’ them. I tried but I don’t think I had the right delivery.” Dean took a bite and sat back.
Once the show is queued, Dean goes back to his cell phone, this time ordering them food before returning to his Dom search.
“Yeah...” Dean reached down and squeezed Cas’ ass, spreading his cheeks apart. “Can I have you?” he asked, rutting his crotch into Cas’.
His eyes flicked toward Dean and he pinched his brows together. “I don’t eat while on duty. You know this.”
real... but there was no way - cursed or not - that someone like Dean would be that interested in him.
“You fucked Ares?” Dean slapped his hand away playfully. “I didn’t fuck him actually. Not yet, he wouldn’t until he spoke to Ares.”
“Um… Dean?”
The rest of the night was a blur, just like Cas had hoped it would be, and he hardly left his bed on Sunday thanks to the epic hangover.
“So,” Cas said between heavy breaths. “Was that better or worse than your fantasy?”
"Um..." She definitely noticed Cas' eyes, because she also kicked him under the table. "With great difficulty, as you can see. Castiel, do you need to be excused?"
He flinches at the slap and forces a laugh, rinsing everything off and grabbing a towel to dry off before someone else can sneak up on him. He rushes back to his cell and stares at the bare walls with a sigh. “Home sweet home.” He lays down, eyes glued on the door.
ready for this!”
He looked past Cas and frowned, faking a nervous look and the second Cas turned to check it out, Dean ducked into the crowd.
“You’re just as clingy as he is, don’t even try to deny it.” Cas raised an eyebrow and tried to wrap his lips around the neck of the bottle, but the angle was weird and some spilled out. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. “What’s she like?”
“You know you’re makin’ me want to more, right?” Dean admits and then holds up his hands. “Alright, alright. I won’t beat her off.”
It sounds like a better plan than any Cas could've come up with, so he follows without a complaint and loads the groceries into the trunk of the Impala as his cock hardens in anticipation. “Lead the way.”
For a moment he stilled, then dropped forward to kiss Dean again before rolling off him with a satisfied huff. “Incredible.”
“Perimeter’s all clear. Am I interrupting?” Cole wiggled his eyebrows.
Dean scoffed and grabbed his phone to put it away. “Princess. If I was a princess, I wouldn’t have to settle for shitty plane coffee. And I know I can trust
Cas smiled softly at his phone and tried not to think too much about how the nickname and goodnight text made his stomach flip like a teenager.
Azrian greets him like he was expecting him. “Hey, come on back. Most of the work is already done, and I'm guessing you won't be with me full time, but I'll show you the ovens and stuff anyway. I’m Azrian, by the way.”
his own brother was aboard that ship, and still caused so much damage the damn thing caught on fire.”
“Look,” Cas started, his voice strained. “I get it. I’m sorry. I normally have time to put pants on before you come home, I thought I had more time. It won’t happen again.” He still avoided meeting Dean’s gaze and reached for the bag. “Let’s just eat, if you still have an appetite. I understand it’s not for everyone.”
Jack nodded and raced off to the locker room, and it wasn’t until he was making his way back over that Cas finally caught sight of Dean. He was busy talking to Jaskier, but looked over and smiled softly when he saw Cas.
He hesitated but listened, turning to lean against the pool table with a grin. “Fine, don’t forget the tongue ring.”
Jo jumped up and went to sit in his lap. “Show me him! I can’t wait to meet him.”
quote that never really made sense to him in that moment.
It's an information overload, but suddenly, everything makes sense. “Fine. Where’s my payment then?” He’s still shaking slightly from anger, but the more he thinks about it, the better that job offer is sounding.
Cas shrugs, pulling out some of the things he'll need. "If there are hungry people in this house and he doesn't mind me using his ingredients, then why not? I love to cook, that's why I do it for a living."
The guy behind the counter is tall, dark, and delicious — but Dean didn't come to flirt, he came for pie. Removing his hat, Dean walks over and looks in at all the empty pans with a look of mock betrayal. “Where’s the loot, buddy?!”
Biting his lip, Dean finally glanced over at Cas. “I probably won’t either, to be honest. Been a long time.” They pulled into the driveway and Dean threw the car in park, shutting it off quickly.
of our functions just to piss you off."
Cas’ watch started chirping incessantly, but it took him a long moment to look away. He pressed the button, annoyed, and turned his back to Dean. “Yes, Ma’am?” His earpiece was in, so Dean didn’t have a damn clue what was going on, but the conversation was short. He turned, suddenly looking skeptical. “I now feel obligated to tell you... that you have another interview scheduled, courtesy of Abaddon. She said it’s a present for your cooperation. It’s a Batman film.”
At least now, Cas could be relatively sure Woody wasn’t a serial killer or a sex fiend, but that only meant he wanted to skip straight to the home run.
“Can't it be both?” Benny ruts against him and brings a hand up to Dean's neck to squeeze, then huffs a quiet laugh as he pulls back and smacks Dean's ass on his way out. “Welcome home, chere. Enjoy your evening.”
have to admit he’s gorgeous.”
All that realization does is solidify that Cas
"Yeah."
A yelled “hurry up in there!” from the living room snaps him out of it, and in less than a minute, he's climbing on the bed with his pants undone and straddling the back of Dean’s thighs, lube in hand. He lightly smacks his round, perky ass then grabs fistfuls of it, opening him up as he spits on that perfect, tight hole. He slides his hard cock over it and shudders knowing he still has to wait. “This is going to be torture—” he starts, releasing him to bring two fingers to Dean’s mouth — “suck, baby. Get my fingers nice and wet. Suck them like you suck my cock.”
Jask attempted to morph his features into something angry or scary, but all it did was make Ares laugh. “Stoppit!” he said with a blush, but smiled all the same. “I was trying to be intimidating, it’s just hard when all I want to do is kiss you.” He leaned in to do exactly that, slotting himself between Ares’ spread legs and owning him fully.
Dean slid up his boxers and then used the towel to dry his hair better as he walked back by his phone. “I got three houses to hit and then I’ll come home for lunch. Probably before noon, but it depends on how long it takes to fix the last house's gutter. Then I’ll hit the last two houses and be home. It’s hard to say an exact hour, some days are shorter than others. Want me to bring us dinner tonight so we don’t gotta cook?”
hate him now… but he was free.
before you announce that bullshit engagement and the press crawls so far up your ass there won’t be
The second he was out of sight, Cas ran back into the room with his heart pounding in his throat. “Dean? Are you okay?”
“Hey, sweetheart.”
They changed quickly, not hiding anything from each other, and then crawled into bed. Jask’s dimples stood out as he smiled and opened his arms, and when Ares rolled against him, Jask wrapped him up. “I’m actually a little offended that you fit so well.”
“Uh... Castiel Novak. My sweetheart. The love of my life. I don’t ever want to spend a minute without you. You’re my favorite part of waking up... Will you do one more crazy thing with me and, uh... marry me? Please? Unless you think we shouldn’t, or if you think you can find someone with a better ass than me. Which would be surprising, I have a very nice a—”
Muffled voices drifted through the crack under the door, and Cas sighed when he realized that meant they weren’t alone. Every inch of him was craving Dean, to have him in ways he hadn’t yet, but he knew he’d have to wait a little longer.
“Cas... fuck... so good. Mine...” he nips along Cas’ jaw and starts sucking marks on his neck. Cas moves faster, whining and hanging on tighter as his cock thickens again between their heated bodies. He's shaking now, all crabby, bratty pretense long forgotten.
Cole shrugged, sitting in the recliner to his right. “It’s going, Jody’s being picky as hell. She thinks she found one, it’s a... young kid named Jack. He’s still gotta get past me and Cas though, so don’t get your hopes up too much.”
Sam laughed. “Course, but you didn’t. You said
“If this is yoga, I shoulda started a long time ago.” Jask wiggled back, turning his head to meet Ares in a kiss. “Okay, okay… seriously, show me. I’ll try to behave.”
Cas slid his hand up under Dean’s shirt and pressed his palm flat against his abs, holding him impossibly close. He breathed in Dean’s scent and nearly lost his mind, still not over the shock that Dean actually wanted him, too. Another handful of thrusts into that gorgeous, tight ass had Cas emptying with a grunt that echoed through the trees.
Dean walked over and grabbed the menu, picking out his dinner. “What you wanna eat?”
“Why are you so grouchy? Aren’t you happy to see me?” He donned that annoying, innocent grin that always got Cas to melt.
Dean looked around for an escape and then locked eyes with Cas again.
know?”
They barely made it through the sliding glass door before Dean was laying Cas back onto the dining room table and kissing him deeply. Cas moaned, thrusting up into the air and trying to push Dean back. “No, bed. This table isn’t strong enough… we…” he pulled him back in and tugged up until the table really was groaning under the weight of them both.
“I told you a long time ago I'm impossible to please,” Cas says teasingly. “I guess that means I just require really
“I think everyone is lonely. Some people just find someone to be lonely with.” Ares played with his lip ring before speaking again. “You know that old song that says, ‘It’s a thin line, between love and hate’? Is that true?”
Jimmy looked up from his seat and chuckled at Cas' outfit. "Nice PJ's, bro."
Dean had a moment where he almost called it all off. He could just get fucked and forget about Cas for a bit. But he also knew that wasn’t possible. He paced his room until he heard Havoc go crazy when Jask walked in the house.
Cas pointedly looked away when Jask let out a whimper and wrapped his arms around Ares, letting them carry on for a moment before quietly clearing his throat. “I think we’re done here, and I would appreciate it if you two saved what comes next for the privacy of your own homes, not my office… or the dugouts. And not that I’d ever condone the two of you - or any students for that matter - having sexual relations, but if you’re going to insist on doing it… there is a basket of condoms in the top drawer of the filing cabinet.”
“No, my treat. I make more than you.” Ares snatched her card and pulled out his own.
“Yes. Always. I only tease because I want you so fucking bad.” Cas squirmed against the desk. “If you told me to drop to my knees in the middle of class, I would.”
smelling my breath right now.” He winks at Dean and heads out of the room to find some mouthwash, and Dean ends up hanging back in the hallway for him.
“Maybe... keep suckin’ baby.” Dean watched Cas with his bottom lip between his teeth. His cock was already twitching in his pants as Cas moaned and took the whole damn thing in his mouth, his lips closing around the stick.
“Nah, but I’m pretty sure this is the angriest my dick has ever been at me.” He laughed like he wasn’t mad about it and bit his lip. “Not often I get him all worked up to deny him, but I’m not in a hurry.”
Dean shivers, his legs shaking around Cas as he bares his neck. “M’sorry, Angel. Take me... Feelin’
He immediately stiffened, but his shoulders relaxed quickly. “I suppose I’m not your bodyguard anymore. Well, I
He was surprisingly less nervous than he anticipated as he pulled into Dean’s driveway. Things with him just seemed
With shallow breaths, Cas nodded. “Not our last time.” They stayed there for a moment, both trying to believe the words. After a while, Ares moved off of him to let him up, and Cas stood. “I should shower before I hit the road… showing up smelling like sex probably wouldn’t be a good first impression. I know you just took one, but… do you want to join me?”
Dean chuckled and shook his head. “You think I deserve kids? They’d probably kick me out the building if I tried to adopt.”
Cas jerked one shoulder up and put his legs back in Dean’s lap. “I don’t know yet. It just depends, I think, on what Jask is doing. If he’ll be around, Ares will probably just come here for a couple of hours.”
He didn’t have the luxury of hiding his blush that time. He nodded, licking his bottom lip slowly. “Yes, I did. After what I assume was a pang of jealousy toward the girl in your bed, I nearly tripped over my own feet trying to get to the bathroom. It was… still shiny. I… came all over the back of the toilet thinking about you buried inside of me and not someone else.”
A growl rips through Dean’s chest as fury makes him see red. He can handle a lot of shit — but not that. He punches Max repeatedly until two sets of hands drag Dean backward and he slides across the floor, flailing and trying to get up. He gets tossed out in the hallway outside of the cafeteria as Kimiko runs back inside with her baton out, and Frenchie hauls Dean to his feet with a strength that surprises him. He shoves Dean’s chest and points to one of the vacant recreation rooms. “In,
Cas’ softening cock slid out of him and he groaned in protest, kissing over Dean’s jaw and down his neck. “Good. Now drink some water and go to sleep.”
“I’m in the kitchen!” Cas yelled, and as Dean rounded the corner, Cas turned to him. “I wasn’t sure if you’d have time for an actual hot lunch or not, so I just made you a BLT. Extra bacon.” He slid the plate forward. “You… strike me as the type,” he added, smiling sheepishly.
“I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised, no one knows how to be happy with what they have, anymore. You can’t trade
There was a brief moment when Cas regretted his little show. Dean had no idea about any of it and he preferred to keep it that way… but chances were good Dean wouldn’t believe Jaskier anyway. “My job isn’t to be
“I was plannin’ on it being your ‘five years as my bodyguard’ gift, but now I think we should go for ten.” He grinned, knowing exactly how to get under Cas’ skin.
She stared open mouthed at him like he’d just told her she’d have to pick a certain kind of pie to eat for the rest of her life, but nodded once and turned on her heel. Dean took a steady sip of his coffee and shook his head a little, wondering what she’d been doing for the last few days that she didn’t already know that. His mind wandered, and he started contemplating what kind of project Cas would end up doing.
and take turns reenacting the scene. Help your partner create something of your choosing.” Cas blushed furiously thinking about the details of that scene, and looked up at Dean. “It’s a good thing we’ve crossed that particular line already, hm?”
The memories of his entire stay threaten to drown him. It takes pretty much all he's got to stay awake and alert and
There would be nothing in the world that could save Cas if he had to listen to Dean Winchester coming by someone else’s ministrations. He nearly screamed the end of the creed in his mind and would’ve covered his own ears if he wasn’t so serious about keeping Dean safe.
“Yeah? So I was... good?” Dean leaned back to see Cas’ face and bit his lip.
“I dunno. Maybe cause you can’t lift me up, I know you used to love that shit before me.” Dean moved to cuddle Jask, knowing it wouldn’t last long but that wasn’t the point. “Wanna be the big spoon, handsome?”
“Fuck,” he whispers with a shudder, then enjoys that tight ass for one more moment before letting himself slip out. He ceases contact, taking an unsteady step back.
Dean pulled out and rolled Cas over, sliding him down his throat and shoving three fingers inside his abused hole, humming around his leaking cock.
“Bout a year and a half, give or take. But that's good news for me, means I'm out soon.” He grins, but then winces and picks at one of his wounds. “Tell ya what, I won't ask you what you did if you don't ask me.”
“Does it bother you that I’m here?” Jask challenged with a smirk. “I’m with Havoc. He likes me more than you.”
Gabe pulled out a bunch of candy he stole from the vending machine and Cas stole his only sucker. “Hey! That wasn’t supposed to be in the pile. I bought that one.”
“Think we can get away with dancing later on? I think I like this.”
If Dean thought Cas would stop the conversation, he was wrong. “Who?” Dean looks over, completely confused, but the word “giant” makes it click. “Oh, him? Nah. Not him. Don’t be nosey and try to guess. It’s
“Driver picks the music, shotgun shuts his cake hole.” He winked at Cas and slid in a tape.
He stopped and was happy to see Jask comply without a fight. “Am I in trouble?”
or will
He figured this experiment would help them, and maybe Ares could even get some topping tips from Jask, but even as he thought it, he didn’t want it. He didn’t want tips from Jask, he wanted to experience him.
The groan was
“Alright.” Dean’s still frowning, a little annoyed that arrangement didn’t work out how he hoped. But he isn’t about to give up yet — someone will take that deal eventually, and in the meantime, he’s got a little fight on his hands. “These guys threaten you daily, too?”
“Yeah, I’m sure. This has
“Funny,” Ishim laughed as he stood. “What would poor, innocent little Jo say if she knew her boyfriend liked to get fucked in that tight little ass of his by complete strangers?”
“Next time I come, I’ll bring you a pie.” Cas stood, grabbing a blanket for him and spreading it over his legs. “Get some rest, I’ll go talk to the nurse and I’ll be back in a couple of days, okay?”
A few minutes later, Cas came out with plates to help him out. “You can knock that table all you want, but next time… you’re doing it. You’re the big, tough, construction worker, after all.
Nothing about his brother’s smug expression changed. “Have you kissed him yet?”
“Mind? That’s my favorite position.” Winking, Jask pulled him toward the bathroom and started the water. “Did uh… you and Cas do this a lot?”
Ares chuckled from their side. “Good thing we ate without waiting, let’s go Jask. I think they need some privacy.”
“I see you, Dean,” Victor growls out. “Yeah, I had a feeling you'd like this, getting stuffed with your own come and fucked like a whore. Surprised I didn't get you on that too, honestly.” He changes the angle, hitting Dean's sweet spot over and over again. “Gonna come for me again, pretty boy?”
“Well... I’d have to kill him if he reacted badly, so... let’s hope he doesn’t.” Gave meets his eyes, showing him he isn’t joking.
It took every ounce of willpower he had to break the kiss, but he did. He’d hoped it would be something short and sweet, just something to take the edge off and ease him in, but instead… it was anything but. Cas knew if he didn’t pull back now, he wouldn’t pull back at all. “Dean…”
Cas barely flinched. “Slugs, Dean. We’re the Banana Sl— nevermind.” He sighed, finally looking up from his screen. “And yes, it starts in a couple of weeks. A few of my professors have already put the syllabuses up.”
Dean's smile faded and he nodded toward the hallway. “Yeah, we do. But... you won't be comfy in there. It's kinda our workout room. I made space for you in my room... I thought this was supposed to be like a relationship. I was gonna stick to my own side."
Dean got up and rolled his eyes as he walked to the door to yank it open. “Don’t you asshats have a key by now?”
Now that he’d found the damn profile, he didn’t know what to do with it. He chuckled to himself at how silly it had been to even look for it, and swiped right just because he could. He pocketed his phone just as Dean finally slid off the bed with that ridiculous modesty pouch and high-fived one of the cameramen.
Cas squeezed the sides of his throat harder, slowing his thrusts and flicking the ball of his tongue ring over Dean’s earlobe. “Because I was trying not to do exactly this.” He dropped his hands and bent Dean over again, barreling into him and digging his fingertips into Dean’s sides hard enough to bruise.
Cas stared at his phone after the message flipped to ‘delivered’ and waited, barely breathing, hoping Woody didn’t find his forwardness to be inappropriate. The thought itself was almost laughable thanks to their arrangement, but it didn’t change the knot of tension in his gut that didn’t loosen until he got a response.
He smiled and stood up, walking over with his damn rebel swagger and sex hair. “You would? Would you give me after school specials?”
“For... being you.” He held out his hand for Cas’.
It seemed overly formal, even for them, but Cas simply stepped back politely. “Interesting, to say the least. How was yours?”
"See now you're just trying to get in my pants." Ares laughed at his joke and turned off the water. "Fine, but if they're still there after my shower I'll end up doing them. Dishes in the sink is a pet peeve."
After a soft hum, Dean kissed across his jaw and flicked his tongue over the marks he’d left that morning. “Mine.”
“Jask,” Dean laughed, “you can’t tell me you’re down to fuck and then immediately ask me to look at pictures of your crush.” He shook his head with an amused smile and took a sip of his beer. “And no, quit being a creep. I’ll see if I can find him in person Monday.”
But P leaned back until he was upside down on all fours like a friggin crab and dropped his ass down, rendering Dean to be incapable of rational thoughts. He couldn’t really reach P’s cock anymore, especially without lights, but he could hear it smacking wetly off P’s abs every time he slammed himself down and lifted back up.
“I’ve been here a few days and I’m dying. Guess I need too much attention for the hole.” Dean chuckles at how true that really is, then tries to find a way to keep Cole talking for that exact reason. “You get people to talk to here often or do they just get kinda quiet after a while?”
After double checking his work, Dean closed the hood. “Yep, should run good as new.” He wiped his hands on his jeans and finished his drink, handing Sam the empty bottle. “You’re right though, I might not’ve grown out of it… But at least I’ve learned to control it.”
Instantly opening, Ares moaned into his mouth, all doubt slipping away.
“Ouch, which side?”
The hopefulness in Dean’s voice broke Cas’ heart in all the best ways. He nodded, dropping his hand down to grasp Dean’s. “Yes, you are. And no matter what happens… I’m yours, in whatever capacity you’ll have me. Bodyguard or otherwise.”
When he came back down in his comfy sweats, Cas was waiting, looking just as nervous as Ares was feeling and he sat close, draping his legs over his lap. “Hi.”
he tugged on Jask’s messy hair and kissed back down to his neck, sucking another mark on the other side.
Dean walked over, his hand on his cheek. “I never cheated! It was fucking acting! Cas... get me outta here, please.”
Cas moved slightly, wishing he could hold Dean in his arms. “Thank you. I... know you didn’t want to take me for granted, Dean. I know things changed, but I know you never meant to hurt me... And I never meant to hurt you, but me just leaving? That hurt you. And I’m sorry.”
extra kisses later, Dean’s making his way back out onto the street to meet the others.
A deeply rooted sense of duty was the only thing that stopped him from immediately putting in his notice.
Dean frowns a little because he did want to see Sam, but the fact that he isn’t dead anymore has a lot of other emotions running through his mind. “Holy shit... not dead? What friggin’ year is it?” he asks quickly, pointing at some holographic ad on the side of the road.
“Leave? You never leave. Where?” Gabe asks with a worried expression. “What happened? You were just all smiley and crap.”
Bracing himself on the counter, Ares fought every urge to run to Jask or jack off in the kitchen. He wanted him, no, needed him. Needed to feel his strength and more importantly, that cock.
He paces in his office and then hides the whiskey and the glasses before calling Gabriel back in. “I need to leave.”
this too. “I’m right here, Cas.” He rutted against him harder.
“It’s okay not to know yet, Dean. I imagine the way the world reacts to your admission will play a big part, but it’s still something you’re going to need to decide for yourself in the end.” Cas’ watch chirped and he glanced down at it, his face paling quickly.
By the smirk that briefly appeared on his face, he did. Cas leaned a little to the side, closer to Dean. “I wouldn’t mind winning again, that’s for sure.”
She chuckled, using her key fob to unlock her car. “Have a nice summer, gentlemen.” Before either of them could say anything else, she drove off. Dean turned to stare at Cas open mouthed.
Dean buried his face in Cas’ neck and planted a kiss there, sliding both of his arms underneath Cas so he was suctioned to him like a damn starfish. He loosen his grip after Cas had calmed down, but Dean stayed where he was.
Dean jumps back, falling over his side table and knocking down a few papers. “Holy fuck! Cas... Cas I—” He rushes out of the room but he doesn’t leave, just paces back and forth for a while.
“Mmm.” Dean nuzzled in close, his arms wrapping around Cas. “Yer comfy.”
Dean bit his lip and thought back to the day he met Cas and huffed a laugh. “You first.”
“Yeah, sure... but it isn’t a lie for me. I do love you, J. Told you, you’re almost my favorite person ever.” Dean chuckled and bit his lip back. “But sure, let’s get all chick-flicky for a sec.” He cleared his throat. “Jaskier, I will be lost without you. The world will be gray and I refuse to enjoy color without those green eyes to brighten my world.” He spoke in a fake English accent, and was tempted to keep going, but Jask’s unamused face made him stop to laugh.
Cas moaned again, much louder this time, and when his legs began to shake he knew he was close. “Dean, I’m gonna come...” he whispered, seconds before spilling through his fingers and down his hand.
face first thing in the morning.”
“Grace, Dean. That's me.” He does it again, urging him faster with his other hand, then moves suddenly, flipping them and laying Dean down with one of his wings tucked under him for comfort. He thrusts hard, leaning down to kiss him, and Dean’s a goner.
He graduated high school.
"You didn't deserve this. I hope you find the one, April. I'm so sorry it wasn't me." He stopped at the door and didn't follow her out. She had every right to be angry.
“The PE instructor?” Cas flushed, he hadn’t been prepared to explain to her who her own faculty was.
Grinning at the praise, Dean kissed him with both hands on Cas’ face and slowly rocked down, fucking himself on that finger until Cas offered him a second. Dean really was still open enough from their fun during breakfast, so Cas didn’t go past two. He lifted to pull his sweats down and lube up his cock, waving for Dean to slide on. “Come here, baby. God, you’re absolutely stunning.”
“You do, but it’s different, we don’t really talk much outside of fucking, let’s be real.” He took another bite. “You know how to make me come, I’ll give you that.”
Cas pocketed his phone again and sat beck in his chair to think.
“Wake up,” he said softly, wiggling down under the covers. Dean actually wasn’t hard yet, which Cas was glad for… he wanted to feel it happen on his tongue.
Dean had already stored the blade in his jeans and shrugged when they all looked at him. “What? I’m not givin’ it up. Any of you fuckers could be the monster.”
“So, it’s safe to say he’s never given you a reason to believe he’d be open to something else, then. No… friends he’s a little too chummy with? Strangers he looks a little too closely at?”
Anyway, they started dating right after high school. It was a disaster, and like most relationships, they broke up soon after. But neither seemed to be able to move on. One of them even moved away, but thanks to an amazing job opportunity, he moved back. And it didn’t take long to reconnect. Once they were able to work through all of those bad things, they were able to finally bury all animosity and move forward — together.” Ares smiles down at the ring on his finger but it’s gone as quickly as it began. “All I’m saying is... don’t count your story out just yet. Things change, and even if this guy
Dean spread P’s legs further and sat up higher, as good as the frotting felt, he
and let out a sigh. “We’re fine, Drake and I decided not to keep our relationship a secret anymore. If you had the guts to come out, so did we. It’s been rocky and the paparazzi hasn’t left us alone for a second, but I’m proud of him. He’s handling it better than I thought he would. How’s your
Dean, but he couldn’t pretend he didn’t understand.
Madison came back a moment later with their drinks and one of those children’s menus you can color on, but it was already filled in. She smiled warmly at him and pointed to what appeared to be a young boy sitting with his mom… a young boy wearing a dress. “He said ‘if Dean Winchester can be himself, so can I’. He wanted you to have this.”
Yet, even Jask has told Dean to cool it a few times, especially when it comes to Cas. Whatever Dean sees in him, Jask sees too — minus the sex appeal. Cas is special. He’s someone you work to be better for, someone who deserves all the good things in the world, even if he’s the sassiest person Dean’s ever met. But maybe that’s part of it. The sass was what Dean liked about him that day they met, and he’s only grown to like it more.
He drained the flask, figuring he’d just tell the kid he dumped it out and to be smarter about it next time. How none of them had worked out the whole vodka-in-a-water-bottle trick was beyond him, but it made his job about a hundred times easier.
Mornings were just better. Better for cuddles and kisses, but more importantly, for words. “Morning, sleepy.” Dean kissed his head and kept his eyes closed.
He holds Dean’s hand in that handshake a little too long, so Dean breaks it with an awkward chuckle. Becky throws herself at him in an even
“Yup. Too bad Ares is taken, maybe we’d both get laid.” Dean plopped on the couch and started flipping the channels.
His hands shake slightly as he tears the packet open, but he slicks himself and nudges two lubed fingers inside of Dean, spreading it around and then pulls back, his breathing ragged. “Hands against the wall.”
More than once, Dean found himself right on the edge but unable to tip over. Having to stop over and over again to replay the video wasn’t helping, and he wished he knew a way to put the damn thing on a loop so he wouldn’t have to.
While his hand twisted and tugged, Jask sucked on the side of his throat. Ares knew those marks wouldn’t go away anytime soon, which meant Cas would see them in a couple of days — and Jask didn’t seem to care. He was doing it on purpose; marking him on purpose.
it will be the best sex of my life. Kissing him is...” Dean made a
and light erupts around Gad. He screams, his back arching until he falls to the ground, and all Dean can see through the smoke is an imprint of angel wings surrounding him.
Cas frowned, letting out a measured breath. “I’m probably overreacting, anyway. I’m sure Dean and Jask are happy with each other, there’s no reason to think anything would happen in the first place. But you’re right, I should talk to him before I leave.”
“Probably getting drunk or doing push-ups. I don’t know, they get weird when they’re together.” He laughed and got comfy on the couch after they ate. “How is the project going?”
Dean chuckled. “Get one. How are things with Drake? He still okay with… this?” He motioned to her on his lap.
The process was much quicker than anticipated, and soon, they were making their way back to the Impala with their fat little pup. “See, he recognized you instantly.”
“I don’t see you that way. Do you just see me as the type to stick his dick through a mysterious hole because he’s that desperate?” Dean lifted his face up by his chin. “Open your beautiful eyes for me, Cas. We found each other for a reason. Couldn’t you feel
It took him a while, but he finally found a decent one less than an hour out. “Think we can make it another 40 minutes before we call it a night?”
“Don’t downplay this. It’s friggin heaven in between two slices of bread.” Dean paused, wondering if that made sense, but shrugged and took another bite.
with you?” The anger builds in his chest until Cas is walking forward and shoving Dean backward. “I'm going to lose my job because of this! And for what, so your pathetic ass could get in a couple of laughs?”
“That would be swell. I have some cash in the mattress.” She pushes the sandwich into his hands and then shuffles to her bedroom. When she comes back out, she sets the money on the table and starts making them some tea. “Don’t forget my chocolates, Charles. You know they’re my guilty pleasure.”
Ares licked and slurped like he couldn’t get enough and when he finally slid off, he smiled up at Jask’s face. A split second later, Jask pushed him back onto the floor and chased his own taste as he pinned him to the carpet. “My turn,” he said low, using one hand to push Ares’ pants down as his other kept him caged. Jask brought Ares’ hard length against his saliva and come coated spent cock, jerking them together until he was twitching from overstimulation. When he finally couldn’t take it anymore, he kissed and bit down Ares’ body until he was nearly choking on that cock.
Cas pulled what was left of the banana into his mouth and finally bit some off. “Another thing I’ll keep in mind.”
Cas smirked a little, pausing as he picked up his fork. “It was… good, honestly. Very thorough.”
In the end, the judge takes pity on Dean and only gives him ten years — which, for four counts of grave desecration, two counts of identity theft and two counts of felony credit card fraud, he got off damn lucky. He’d been looking at the death penalty when that murder charge was brought up.
“Sit back in your chair.” Cas turned to push him back into it and faced away before sinking down. He bottomed out and rolled his hips, stroking himself as he started bouncing. Dean watched the muscles in his back flex as he moved and he gripped Cas’ waist, guiding him and biting his lip.
Jask scoffed with a playful smile. “This month is gonna get real awkward if you don’t even flirt. That’s roughly 96% of my personality.” He folded his suits over the back of the couch and nodded. “Hungry though, yeah. Always. I’m kind of a bottomless pit.”
His breathing immediately caught in his throat and those baby blues got a helluva lot darker as he inched his way in, making Dean’s eyes flutter closed as Cas gripped both of his hips and lifted his ass off the bed.
“I get it, really. But I swear you guys have some kind of connection. Is it really purely platonic? Have you ever been... curious? And I’m sorry for the 20 questions, I’ve been wanting to ask and I’ve bit my tongue for months. I can’t help it.” He took a drink and met Cas’ eyes. “It’s okay, I won’t even tell Jask anything.”
It sounds so good in here.”
Cas stared at that little black ball for a moment and stepped closer to Dean. “Oh? Why’s that?”
“I mean, who knows what the future holds. This show keeps me on my toes, so it’s hard to find time to do other projects. But, I don’t mind.”
“Fuck… okay,” Jask whispered, digging his ass into the mattress as if he were trying to create some distance between their lengths. He flipped them a moment later, sucking on Ares’ collarbone and pinning him to the bed. “I’ll just make the top half of you mine, then.”
Of all people, Cas raised his hand. “I will. Do I get to choose my branch?”
Jask fell silent with an eye roll, but started laughing at something halfway through. It was times like these that Dean remembered how damn simple everything was for them. All his friends had relationship problems but not them, it just worked. He’d truly never felt more comfortable.
Dean rolled his beautiful bratty eyes and walked to the bar. “So, you won’t have a drink with me then, huh?”
Both boys rolled their eyes, but since Dean was standing behind them, he didn’t see it, and Cas let out an exasperated but near silent sigh.
absolutely doesn’t go to our school — and then before I could walk up and make fun of you, he walked out with the same damn ‘holy shit, I just got laid at school’ look. I just put it all together. You were never this into Benny. You were never actually happy with him, you were content. This is different. You’re in love.”
“Hey man, I offered you a hand and gave much more. Paws off now, it’s too damn hot for that shit.” Dean pushed his heavy ass arm off with a grin. “Feelin’ chick-flicky, J?”
Dean flashed him a cheeky grin that he hoped would show the boy he wasn’t going to be easily pushed around. “I was making a general statement, not my fault it was applicable. Now, if you’ll open your books, we’re gonna jump right into the Civil War.”
know — that they won't let anything tear them apart again, and that kiss goes quickly from soft and sweet to deeper and all-consuming.
Cas stroked them lazily, his fist loose and teasing as they softened, gasping at the aftershocks.
Dean rolls his eyes and finishes his food just as a woman walks in the kitchen with a towel over her shoulder. “Hey, Missouri. This is Cas. Cas, this is Missouri.” He slides his plate at her with an annoying smirk and she shuffles over to slap him upside the head.
“Yeah,” he said, then took a drink. “Yeah, he’s worth it. Isn’t it obvious? Have you ever seen me like this?”
That weekend, Dean was a jittery, adorable ball of nervousness. He pulled Cas to him and kissed him quickly. “You’re really sure you wanna do this? You’re okay with this?”
Cas was unusually quiet, which had Dean both nervous and relaxing. Dean spent his time flipping through Tinder, trying to keep himself awake and at the same time potentially find a hookup for the weekend. He needed a real ass wrapped around his cock, not just his hand.
A laugh escaped him as he pictured the faceless stranger struggling for words, and he knew he did his job well. He was only a few minutes from home, so he refrained from responding until he was safely back inside and had a chance to clean up a little better.
Ares laughed and sat up, letting his eyes rake Jask’s body. “I don’t know about you, but I’m starving. I’ll make us breakfast and then wake you from your nap.” He leaned over to kiss his lips and got out of bed to stretch.
“Don't apologize. It's okay… I'm okay. Or, I am now, anyway. Just promise me you won't leave again.” His chest tightens with fear and he refuses to make eye contact. This is the very thing he's been so afraid of — if Dean doesn't want to stay, it'll break him.
He cleared his throat quietly and closed the book, reciting from memory. “‘We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be’. It’s not necessarily personal, but I suppose it’s not…
They stood together like that for practically the rest of the dance, smiling at Jask and Ares being adorable, and trying to keep their hands off each other… which
Dean couldn’t understand why Cas didn’t like Jask. He was pretty obnoxious, but he’d never been rude to any of Dean’s bodyguards.
“Nah. All the guards have nicknames around here. We call him Butcher because he used to be one, but apparently got tired of beating up dead animals and came here to pick on live humans, instead.”
Dean smiled and slid out painfully slow, then slammed back in, just to hear him gasp. He stared down at his silhouette, able to make out the outline of a man below him but he couldn’t see any details. Not one feature could be pointed out and Dean wished he cheated, wished he’d let in one streak of light through the bathroom or something to see... anything.
"You got it, bossy." Dean spreads his legs and also his cheeks with his palms, showing Cas that sinful hole he's about to wreck.
Dean slid his hand under the desk and palmed himself, letting out a slow breath and making sure no one was looking at him.
Dean smiled and sat back comfortably, his arm going behind Cas’ back as he searched for the news. “Do I smell better now?”
Cole raised his eyebrows and pointed a finger gun at Dean. “Ask the Princess.”
By lunchtime, he was done with school.
He was annoyed at her for opening her mouth, knowing it would just hurt Dean to hear her, and also annoyed that he had to repeat himself. “As I stated, Dean. This isn’t a good time, I’ll call you later.”
The blanket nearly tripped him as he scrambled out of his bed to find a plug, grateful beyond belief that he’d already
He doesn't see Cas again until his next SAA meeting, and by this point, he's antsy as hell about it. Cas sits down to start and looks around, jotting down the attendance. “I'm sorry to those of you who have tried to reach out to me recently, I've been away.”
When Ares first agreed to the “swap”, he truly hoped he was making the best decision. He had hoped with every fiber of his being that he was, and everything about Jask
You’re lucky my job is to protect you.” And just like that, Cas clasped his hands together in front of him and resumed that stupid wall-decoration pose.
The smell of baked ziti wafted through the house and reached Ares’ nose. He still felt groggy, but he washed up and made his way downstairs, pulling Cas in for a hug and gently rubbing his shoulders. “Morning... ish.”
“All of you,” he admitted. “And I haven’t even truly had you yet.” Jask dragged his nails slowly down Ares’ back and then glanced down, leaning in to bite the fabric of Ares’ shirt. “Off?”
Cas pulls back just enough to use Dean’s come to jack himself off, letting the tip of his cock rub against his ass each time. “You're beautiful, Dean. Beautiful and —
They finished their breakfast and made their way to the couch, both of their faces glued to screens. It took a while, but Dean came across an old bank that sounded exactly like what they were looking for. “Check this out. You can solve mysteries to make it to different vaults in this creepy old bank.” He handed Cas the phone.
Jask bit his lip as he ran his hands up and down Ares’ body. “I’m torn. Part of me what’s to spend all day fucking you into this mattress, and part of me what’s to take you on a date. Decisions, decisions.”
Cas noticed, he sat up and tilted his head, amusement on his face as he lubed up his dick absentmindedly.
Actually leaving turned out to be another thing entirely. He sat in the driveway for what felt like hours, but couldn’t have been more than maybe thirty minutes. He agonized over his decision to go without saying more. He gripped the stationary wheel and clenched his jaw, forehead tipped against the cool leather.
Vibrations nearly send him over as Cas moans and swallows him whole. He holds there, face buried against Dean’s crotch and fist working furiously until Dean can’t take it anymore and he comes with a growl down Cas’ throat.
“Yeah, but you had to see it.” He laughed again. “Worse than an unsolicited dick pic.”
wasn’t one of ‘em.” Dean grins, his cheeks flushed from his orgasm and he leans in to kiss Cas, then collapses back down. “Alright, let’s grenade-launch this shithole. Smells like rancid nuts in here.”
Last chapter goes up on Thursday 😉
He moved his hand slowly, dragging it over the length of Dean’s jaw. “The threat is gone, we can move.” Without another moment’s hesitation, Cas backed off, grateful for the smallness of the moon — maybe by the time his shorts were visible again, his damn bulge would be gone.
Knowing he would regret it when they had to walk out of there, Cas reached and gripped Dean’s short hair, pulling him back for a kiss as he shoved his cock back inside with one quick, rough thrust. “Why are you sore, Dean? Who’s cock splits you open?”
Dean huffed a laugh. “I couldn’t even look at that spot without getting hard. Matt was convinced someone broke in, but since nothing was missing he dropped his dumb quest pretty quick. Sam saw my neck and already knew.” Sam knew Dean did
Dean gripped the waistband of Cas’ pants and pulled them down, biting all along his thighs to tease. He could see Cas was already at full mast, but he wanted to torture him a little.
She smirked, flicking his ear. “You wanna share with the class what you were daydreaming about? I’m sure Luce here wants in on it.” Abaddon abruptly ducked out of the way of a swinging fist, the boy attached to it scowling.
Cain chuckled. “When can you start? I’m overwhelmed as it is and need the help, but it’s hard finding other people that share the passion I do.”
“Yes.”
“Fuck yes.” Ares straddled his lap and nipped his lip, rolling his hips. “My turn to show you what I can do.”
Any fears he had that Dean would change his mind once Cas was actually driving disappeared as they got on the road - Dean hardly seemed to notice they were even moving in the first place. Havoc eventually settled down on his lap, and only then did Dean look over at him. “He’s gonna pee in my car, isn’t he.”
Dean took his time moving, giving him the smallest amount of space possible. “What’s wrong with close? You need the warmth, remember?” He winked and finally backed off.
“Where are you right now? Whydya need a day off to fuck an aardvark when you coulda just fucked me again? Or— or did you regret it?”
25th season. I’ll get you the passcode once you’re there, but there’s a box inside that I need. And anything you can bring from Dean’s would be helpful… clothes, things he was fond of…”
"Fuck... I'm so fucking hooked on you, Cas." Dean's body shivers, his forehead dropping forward against the wall as he plants his feet.
His mind wandered to Arthur and the litany of texts and calls Cas had ignored recently. Maybe it wouldn’t be such a terrible idea, and hell... Duma was right, he needed it. “We’ll see. Talk soon, Duma. Over and out.”
He grinned when Ares caught up and turned a corner, intentionally falling back a couple of paces to stare at Ares’ ass. If possible, it looked even better when he was running. “Where do you usually run?”
Cas blinked, but it was the closest to a flinch Dean had ever seen from him. “Right. I’ll make the arrangements. Do you have a preference who takes my place?”
Jask fished his phone out of his pocket and stepped back to let Dean actually walk inside. “We got matched. For the partner swap thing.”
Dean fumbled for the lube that was still sitting on the table from that morning and shimmied off Cas’ lap to ditch his pants. “Bet I’m still kinda open. I can still feel you.”
When his hands were free, he took the tie out of his mouth and moved to kiss Cas as he tugged lightly on his hair.
“I know. Thanks, Cas.” Dean kissed his lips softly. “I’ve honestly never wanted anything more. I know it’s only been like less than a day, but I already feel happy here. This was always my happy place and now I get to be here with you.”
That is, until Charlie yells at him before he’s out of earshot: “Stay away from the damn bakery, Dean! You better interrogate some people!”
Cas studied him for a moment with a strange look on his face. “Probably who’s house we’re keeping when we move in together, because at this rate… that not only seems inevitable, but we seem to be compatible in just about every way.”
Like every time he got anywhere near Cas, Dean’s patience flew out the window. He lifted one of Cas’ legs, squeezing the fabric of his jeans and grinding against him faster, sliding his tongue into Cas’ mouth.
on guard now that Cole had joined them again. He could still feel the lingering touch on his shoulder where Dean’s hand had been; hell… he’d probably feel it for days.
“Ouch. He at least bat for the right team?”
to go, needs to talk to someone that can help him sort things out before he spends the rest of his life repeating the same cruel cycle — but the thought of having to explain what's in his heart is making him dizzy. And that's just it… this time, the thing he needs to overcome isn't in his head.
After becoming reasonably sure he wouldn’t be late due to getting lost, he stopped at the grocery store in town and made his way back home. It looked like some of his new neighbors were already setting up for the block party, which meant he’d gone on his little excursion just in time - he definitely didn’t want to get
“Hey, first of all, fuck normal. Second of all, you’re just jealous our sex is so good it’s
He slid out and pushed back in, finding a pace while still holding P close.
Cas shifted to try and steal a peek into the backseat. “I think it came with some? There was a box back there, see if you can find it. I have no idea what’s in there but if you don’t like any of it, I’m sure there’s a record store somewhere that might have some.”
“Dean, I hear you and Jo are engaged! Please tell us it’s true!” A fan called out when there was only four people left in line.
It wasn’t a question after that. Cas nodded quickly, dropping down to his knees to meet Dean and pulling him into a frantic, consuming kiss. “Yes! Holy shit, yes!” The second Dean wrapped his arms around him, Cas pushed forward, tackling Dean onto the bank’s floor, kissing all over his face. “Let’s go right now,” he hurried out between frenzied pecks, “before you change your mind.”
By the time the bell rang and Kevin dashed out to head to class, Cas was ready for the day to be over.
Cas hummed appreciatively and a wet spot formed on Dean’s stomach as Cas gently took his hands and tied them together. He moved slowly, giving Dean every opportunity to change his mind as Cas brought his hands above his head and secured them to the bed frame. “Are you okay? Again, just nod or shake your head.”
It's starting to seem like more than just his surroundings changed when Dean made the transfer to Absolution Row, and honestly… he's really not sure how he feels about that.
Dean came out with his hair wet and pink skin, almost like he tried to burn the guy off of him with scorching water. “Let’s go home.” He pulled up his jeans and glanced at Ishim’s pile of clothes with a frown. “He really left naked?”
He had actually hoped they’d get married before Dean and Cas, but even
“Been with a woman? Yeah, I wasn’t with a dude until right after high school. I was also drunk which is why I didn’t get the butterflies. Cause I was definitely nervous.” Dean finished eating and took his plate to the sink.
real, stretching his lips and forcing his jaw open, and certainly
Cas offers him an equally cheeky smile. “Since the two of you effectively left those kids to die last time, I took the liberty of already extracting them. They're safe, but the… mimes aren't happy. Shall we?” He gestures toward the barn door and draws his angel blade.
you.”
Cas reached out, touching the corner of Dean’s apron near the top. “Snug. Either you got these out of the children’s section, or construction has been better to you than I thought.”
“Not if you don’t want to. I... guess I was just curious. I mean it seems to help people appreciate what they have at home and honestly, I need to appreciate you more. Everyone knows you deserve much more than this.” Ares set his phone aside and held eye contact, hoping this conversation wouldn’t hurt Cas.
“You guys…” Gabe does an obscene hand movement and then tries to give him a high five. “Come on, bro. Live a little.”
on board, too.
“I don’t have words, Dean. What you just did for that boy… you’re truly everything I always believed you were.
Cas huffed and quirked an eyebrow. “Don’t offer if you’re not willing to follow through.” He laughed at his own joke, turning on his heel. “Do you want your light on or off?”
A short laugh escaped him. “I’m not entirely thrilled he told you about that, but... it is what it is.” He moved the camera away from his face as he walked over to get the Pathokinesis book.
“Uh huh,” he said with a nod, barely audible. “Sure does.” Slowly, Jask tilted his head down, wanting to make damn sure Ares knew he could move if he didn’t want it. But
He pushes his way through the few people back there and out the door to the alley behind the diner. The second the cool air hits him, he rips off his hairnet and throws it on the ground, then starts to pace with his hands tugging his hair.
“Pulling your leg. If anyone’s getting pulled around here, it’s me.” Ben’s the only one that misses the accidental innuendo behind that and all three men bust out laughing at the same time.
Cas grabbed a couple of coffee mugs and poured one for Dean, sliding it over and holding his hand in place long enough for Dean’s fingers to brush against it.
Her eyes widened. “So, wait… now? Here?” She squeezed his wrist and huffed a nervous laugh. “Man, I bet this convention goes down in the record books.”
Chuckling, Cas nips Dean’s bottom lip. “I know. I won't comment on the fact that it's the same term of endearment you use on weapons.” He wraps his arms around him but keeps their eyes locked. “I love you, Dean.”
“Long ass, hot ass week. How are things with you, you still workin’ security?”
Dean’s entire body was shaking under him, fighting off that free fall just a little longer until he couldn’t take it anymore. “Ahh... fuuck!” He groaned so loud Cas was sure the neighbors heard as he emptied inside of Cas’ tight throat.
"Jaskier!" Ares growled and tried to move under Jask's iron-like grip, but he could hardly move an inch. "Please!"
Cas had no knowledge of that one way or the other, but judging by Dean’s general personality... he highly doubted it. “If he’s enjoying himself at all, then no. He won’t just lay there, although he does appreciate getting told what to do.” Cas smirked to himself, knowing damn well that Dean was a brat and probably wouldn’t enjoy a stranger bossing him around at all, unless the man in the back seat was a very specific kind of dom. Maybe this was Cas’ silent little attempt to protest the entire endeavor, or maybe he just wanted to see exactly how bratty Dean truly was... either way, the minute the words were out, Cas regretted them.
