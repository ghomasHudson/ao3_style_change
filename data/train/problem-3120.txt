“I have to do it alone and it has to be done, Cas. You know this.”
Castiel whines, pushing in rhythm with her shallow breathing. She screams as she pushes as hard as she can, a child's head popping out from its womb. One cry turns to two and then Castiel is left with blotches of black dots blurring her vision. She hazily watches as a tall figure wraps her child in a blanket, his back to her. Frantic panic grips at her heart and Castiel launches forward.
Castiel’s heart swells, the tension easing in her shoulders. The pain washes away, the fatigue dissipates. Love blooms in her chest, it overflows the blood in her veins. Castiel chokes on a wistful laugh, her lips forming a smile. Behind her, Dean kisses the crook of Castiel’s neck, rubbing the angel's sides. Sam’s careful as he hands the beautiful boy with dark brown hair to the rightful parents. Castiel gasps, Dean stifling a chuckle. Castiel cradles her son in her arms, unable to look away from the greatest gift she has ever been given. Dean’s hand gently strokes their son's head of hair.
“Dean…” his voice teeters, arms shaking.
Castiel swallows as much air as she possibly can, screwing her eyes shut as tears threaten to spill from them. Dean must blame her now, afterall, Castiel has left him in the dark for so long.
“I will.” Castiel looks fondly at the people that surround her, thankful to be in their care.
So all Castiel can do is wait with her hands folded, the sound of the generators providing her only comfort. She stares at the oak wood table, not a thing on her mind. Every piece of Castiel is empty, shallow. Her stomach churns.
Her wiggling around stirs Dean awake. “Wh-What’s happening?”
Castiel can’t be sure whether this is the wrong choice or not, but in her heart, it feels right. The child feels right, her bond with Dean has always been right. A smile spreads upon Castiel’s lips as she kisses the palm of her hand then lays it upon the bump of her stomach. Castiel lays to her side, watching Dean inhale and exhale. She traces the length of his chin with her finger, thinking of all the ways that she loves him. Of how she already loves the child she will birth with him.
“Love you too.” Dean embraces Castiel and Jack in his arms, meeting the angels lips halfway.
She sniffles and the one that mimics Dean holds her tighter. “No one’s taking him away, Castiel.”
“No one asked you.” Dean glares at the witch, his hand shielding Jack's head from Rowena’s viewpoint.
Castiel leaves the bunker that night, a day or two before Dean and Sam are due to return from chasing a Djinn. She doesn’t bother to leave a note or message for them either. She is gone in the wind, a duffle full of clothes and baby books packed away in the minivan she found herself recently accustomed to. Dean laughed when he spotted it in the bunkers’ garage for the first time, making fun of her for having a soccer mom’s vehicle. Little did he know the reason why she was so drawn to it was that it seemed much safer than to put a carseat in the back of Dean’s Baby or the front bench of a truck. Many articles have told Castiel not to do so as well as the stickers most vehicles have attached to the sun visor. Castiel will not be putting her child in a death trap, thank you very much.
“Dean!” Sam yells, falling to his knees before them. “Dean!”
Castiel finds herself smiling so much more having known what's to come. It’s contagious. Dean isn’t known for the crinkle in his eyes nor the gaps in his teeth but when he’s with Castiel, content in the time they share, Castiel swoons at Dean's smile. Sam smiles as well, poking jokes at the two sneaking off to locked off rooms and whispering an exchange of giggles. The younger of the brothers was never so dull as to miss how close the other two have become. Castiel knows he is happy for them in the way that Sam pats their shoulders with a comforting squeeze.
She doesn’t feel well either. If not for the body holding her upright, Castiel would surely collapse onto the bed. Not the best position to be in when in the throes of giving birth but fatigue overpowers her. Castiel bellows a scream, her back arching, knees buckling. The bed shakes with each of Castiel’s shrieks, the floorboards creaking.
Dean looks suspiciously at Castiel, rolling over to face her. Dean starts to pull Castiel lower onto the bed with him. “Come here.”
“Ah, ah-ah.” Dean rolls over top Castiel, dislodging their limbs from one another and causing the angel to let out an undignified whine. “None of that. Not now.”
Castiel sighs, dog-earing the page on the book she has then setting it aside. She lays on her side facing Dean, tracing a handprint along Dean’s shoulder with her finger. When Dean snorts, Castiel shushes him with a thumb. Watching Dean as he sleeps, her mind wanders to the night her and Dean shared before the sun had been saved. She thinks about Dean’s hands gliding over her smooth sides, caressing the curve of her breast. Castiel mewled, smacking her lips.
The changes don’t stop there.
Castiel bemoans herself as she rubs sleep out of her eyes. Currently, Castiel resides in a rental property as her due date nears, comfortable in a bed unlike the times she’s slept in her car. Castiel fumbles in the sheets, seeking out her phone. She continues to listen to Dean’s rambles at 2:13 in the morning. Castiel scrolls through her contacts, thumb pausing on Dean's name. Perhaps she should call him, explain the details of her predicament. Dean’s next words stop her in her track...
“All’s fair,” the doctor's wrinkled face stretches into a gentle smile. “There doesn’t seem to be any abnormalities. Despite the gallons of peanut butter you eat, your child is in good health.”
“I’m not a man,” Castiel carefully chooses which parts of Sam’s statement to ignore and which not to. “Not a woman either.”
But she will not budge and tell the truth. “Yes.”
It does not help that she finds her body aching as the weight builds around her hips. Sometimes Dean pinches Castiel's thighs when he lays his head in her lap, laughing at the way that she squeals. No matter the number of times Castiel slaps his hand for doing so, he does it time and time again. Instead of respecting her personal space, Dean would smile at her cheekily, lightly tapping his fingers on her belly. He will say something snarky and good natured. Dean once called her glowing and Castiel could not keep the faint blush off her cheeks.
“Peanut Butter Pickles.” Castiel answers with her mouth full, “And sprinkles.”
Much to Castiel’s dismay, the world doesn't end which could only mean that Dean had succeeded in defeating the Darkness. The sun had begun to brighten the Earth as it always did during midday - that is more than a blessing. This time when the light dims, it is because the night is upon them - not destruction. The danger of before has been dealt with, leaving those who witnessed the anomaly to move on.
She gave her heart, her soul and her body to Dean Winchester. All in one night before the end of the world to be consumed by darkness. Castiel gave herself willingly to Dean's expert hands. To hear his smooth voice and feel his chapped lips drag kisses along her body. The intimate moment wasn't something Amara could take away: still the Darkness could steal away Dean's life from Castiel.
Tongues tangled, sharing a breath. Sucking one’s soul from the other to become their own. Castiel giggles. Then there is the lovemaking of it all. The way their bodies molded together, moved in synchronization. Castiel hummed, shutting her eyes. She can feel tiredness overtake her, lulling her into a blissed sleep.
The child is Dean’s, there is no denying that. Dean is the only human, or otherwise, that Castiel has shared carnal relations with. He is the only one she has and ever will love.
She watches Dean say his last goodbyes to Sam and to the demon and the witch. Giving away farewells to people that didn't care for him. Did not know Dean the way Sam and she knew him. He said his goodbyes to say hello to Amara. Castiel clenches her fist and grits her teeth. She feels jealous rage.
“Wait, you don’t need a body when you fall.  You have your own.  Why would he offer it to you?”
The hunter remained quiet while he paged through the catalog of Cas’s eccentricities, expressions, smells, sounds, tastes, shapes.  Nothing helpful crossed his radar as he shuffled through.  Recounting the specific endearing details of his personality only served to magnify his worry and consternation.
Sam looked pensively towards the hallway and back at the pile he started sorting.  Most of the piles didn’t have any connection, but alphabetizing them to make them easier to return to their storage boxes gave him a minute to decide how much to tell Dean about Cas’ recent even stranger behavior.  He was sure his would win the odds that Dean hadn’t noticed anything different in the angel’s antics, but he concluded any push was a push in the right direction.  “Hey, Dean,” he recognized the inbound vulnerable moment in his own tone so the guarded bewilderment on his brother’s face was no real surprise.  “Have you noticed anything different about Cas lately?” He watched as his brother’s eyebrows went up and stopped a tired quip from attempting to exit his mouth, “I mean, weird for the past couple of weeks – like since we got back from Red Hook?”
A sliver of blue escaped from between his eyelids and he scowled slightly.  He opened his drooping eyes halfway and grabbed at the hand caressing his hair.  The agent let him pull it down to his chest and play with his fingers absently.  The pull of his cerulean blues felt like the heart of a whirlpool, pulling him closer despite knowing the danger.  He couldn’t help but close his eyes and blindly send his boat adrift.  The fingers around his gripped tighter as his lips fell to the dusty peach of Cas’s.   A surreal yet natural feeling of coming home enveloped them.  He inhaled Cas’s breath, tasted the cinnamon on his lips, drank in the hot waves of want crashing over him, but knew it was happening too fast.  Somehow, he felt Cas’s hesitation to deepen the kiss in the perimeter of their link.  There was something else to it he couldn’t name, but they remained still for a few moments, neither one wanted to end the delicious connection.  The agent stood up a bit to gaze into his eyes, maybe draw the source of hesitation from his close features.  Elated when hesitance fled from his face entirely, he dove in for a brief peck immediately after with a grin.  Cas’s hands still tightly gripped Dean’s, keeping him close with unspoken want that blared as loudly as a tinny overworked amp.  Cas leaned up for a small final peck and loosened of his hold slowly.  Dean pulled the blanket up over him again with an unending smile.  “Night, Cas.”
Just as he had done thousands of times in his younger days, he climbed up the maroon carpeted staircase bordering the foyer up to the second floor.  At its summit, a large painting of the family’s founding members hung as testament to ideals he once held dear.  Sauntering past it, he couldn’t help but shake his duffle up further onto his shoulder, smiling inwardly.  Spitting in the face of those who once kept a firm foot on his neck wasn’t the best idea at that very moment; he was outnumbered and comparatively inexperienced being out of the inner circle for so long.  He followed a priceless runner rug to the intricately carved set of office doors, the handles resembling the shape of some extinct winged creature he had long since forgotten the name of.
He rolled his eyes at his adolescent prying.  “My neighbor Moira and I are out by quarter to seven most mornings.”
He threw his hands up as if Sam set his computer on fire at the center of the desk.  “Woah woah woah, drugs, Sam?  Why would you think I’m taking mommy’s little helpers when one) we get drug tested at random and two) I’ve never needed help performing my duties before and three) visiting the pharmacy in the middle of a date to buy boner pills never sweetens the deal for any party involved.  Why are you going all after-school-special on me?”
He snickered finally glancing towards the hallway, his heated cheeks on full display. “A’right, so are we watching this fine family programming or what?”
Dean snuck a solitary nervous laugh between the kinetic dismay working its way out of his vocal chords.  “We’ll get you that Thai peanut pizza after we finish this.  I promise I won’t eat any.  After all I have that ‘sausage chaser’ pizza waiting for me.” He wiggled his eyebrows to yank a laugh out of his brother.
Dean watches Cas crash land.
“So?  I would have come running no matter how scruffy you were!”  He sat ramrod straight, staring his whirling orbs of hurt right into his soul.
The hunters nodded in agreement, but Sam harbored questions that itched at him.  “So Cas, why did you even suspect they were here?  Like, how did you even suspect a demi-god was tracking us out of Easton?”
“We should have enough of the Pinchflat Special to last the weekend and Seth filled up a few extra tallboys if you want to share the wealth,” he offered.
The praise following dinner the next evening left him quite chuffed.  He imagined Dean had never enjoyed the taste of crow so much as he beamed over his Cas’s newfound mastery of what was previously his domain in the Bunker.  Jokes passed over the table that Dean’s nesting days hovering over the immaculately clean prep table were numbered.  His brother cackled when he offered to be Cas’s prep cook whenever he wanted help making more complicated recipes.  Sam insisted they go pick out a movie to digest to while he cleaned up, but Cas insisted on at least drying the dishes to speed along the process.  Once they were alone, his secret plan was to thank Sam for well, everything without Dean’s embarrassed interference.  Not only did he keep Dean’s head above water when he was away, he worked with Dean to tackle getting him home the way they had many times before, but he ensured Dean had support every step of the way.  In the end the plan was foiled though, as Dean had other ideas.  He yanked him out of the kitchen and practically nipped at his heels herding him down to the cave.
“Can you think of any other explanation?” he asked incredulously.
Dean rested his forearms on the island and tossed his head at Castiel, “His name is Castiel, by the way.  James is just the body he chose, or chose him, or some mix of the two.”
Rending his eyes from the nourishing visage of his remarkably knackered friend, he congratulated his efforts, “Good job finding whatever this thing is.  I assume this is the baddy that gave us the paparazzi treatment while we were hauling ass out of Easton?”
“There’s zero chance you’re gonna pick up any chicks in that abomination.  Nothing turns a girl’s crank like a breadbox on wheels big enough to cart half of a soccer team.”
“Ah, so they aren’t keeping you very warm,” his eyes drew slowly up along his tan leg to his upper thigh where his boxers scrunched up.  Way to be a creeper, he reprimanded himself and sat up straight to clear his throat.  Their eyes met for a moment and the stranger threw his blanket back over his leg with a nervous smirk.  Perhaps he was just hogging the jacket to keep warm.  He did seem to run cold, he figured.  The dark mop tilted down toward the jacket and he dug through the pockets as he listened.
Cas touches a finger to his own temple. “Yes. Angel radio. The telepathic bond with the Host starts at creation, though his range is currently limited.” He raises his eyes to the ceiling, considering. “More like...angel walkie-talkie.”
“Is this good?” Jack asks Cas, who has his back turned while he pre-heats one of the ovens.
How could you
Before Cas can say anything else, the sound of a car horn honking fills the air, spoiling the moment. The sickly splutter of an engine in need of maintenance can be heard coming from the other side of the house.
The deep ache in his chest became a pounding in his head like a reaper at the door. But there wouldn't be an easy way out for Dean Winchester. Never was.
The rest of the afternoon goes about as one might expect. Pizza is ordered, delivered, and consumed. Birthday candles are lit and blown out to the tune of the Happy Birthday song. Cake is served (Dean abstains in favor of another slice of pizza, the only pie-based option available).
The closed door is not helping to curb his urges.
“Damn,” he mutters, squinting a bit as he tries to keep sight of the road. “Where did this come from?”
Still riding the adrenaline, Dean calls the police. While he waits, a buzzing in his hand reminds him of Cas’s unanswered text. He hurries to type a response so Cas knows he’s not in a ditch, not really stopping to consider that his ambiguousness is only going to lead to more questions.
really. Gabe looks positively
Dean stares out at the receding tail lights, lost in thought again.
He stumbles out of his own bedroom to the living room and collapses onto the couch. His head hits something hard, making him groan. Dean reaches around and blindly feels for whatever smacked him, and makes contact with something small and thin and expensive. Dean latches onto the phone and brings it above his face.
“For those of you who’ve been here before, you know the drill. But, I see a few newcomers out here, so I’ll go over how it all works,” Gabriel says, gaze shifting to Dean mischievously. “This box here…” He holds up a small cardboard box. “...has a list of activities for us to perform. It might be a game, a song, a dance, or who knows what! I’ll draw from it at random, then call people up to the stage and explain the rules of the particular exercise.”
As Dean finishes the last of his burger, Gabriel stands up and brings the microphone to his mouth. “Hello everyone and welcome to improv night!”
” Jack chimes in.
Just as Dean’s sight started to return, a flash of light enveloped the room, forcing the brothers to shield their eyes.
“Heaven knows that ball of energy doesn’t need any more sugar so close to his birthday, but I’ll bring it home anyway. I swear his first tooth was his sweet tooth.” Cas grins. “That part he definitely gets from Gabe.”
“After all was said and done, we took Claire out to some schmancy shopping mall as a treat for a job well done. I can’t remember the last time I went to a mall, but it was depressing as all get-out. Hardly anyone shops in person anymore, and that just made the Christmas decorations seem spooky. It looked like a very clean apocalypse.”
From the deep-set medicine cabinet, Dean withdraws a first-aid kit and a stashed bottle of whisky, setting them both on the counter. Ignoring the world-class stinkeye in response to his preferred therapeutic treatment, he hugs the bottle to his chest and opens it with his free hand. Two disposable mouthwash cups are pulled from the dispenser beside his toothbrush and he fills them like shot glasses, downing one on the spot. The other he holds out to Cas who takes it only to set it aside, reaching instead to grip Dean’s hand and unwrap the makeshift bandage.
A flash of warmth spreads up the back of Dean’s neck at the praise but he ignores it, burying his doubts.
“Are you
A laugh huffs out of Cas. “Until he acquires a true human vessel, his speech would likely shatter your eardrums. I’m sure you’d prefer to avoid a recreation of the first time I tried to communicate with you.”
A painful twinge in his heart reminded Dean of something else Castiel had said.
“Dean, don’t!” Castiel hisses.
Fetching his phone from his pocket, he checks the time. Still nearly an hour before sunrise. Plenty of time for what he wants to accomplish. Toeing on his shoes, he carefully makes his way downstairs, attempting to remain as soundless as possible as he begins poking around the shop with just the light from his phone.
Dean cocks his head to look down at the man holding the ladder steady as if his own life depends on it. “I’m fine, Cas. You can go inside and start up the espresso machine if watching me work is making you nervous.” He turns back and sinks another screw.
He leaned over and draped himself over the dog who only wagged harder and wiggled around to lick Dean’s face.
like to date you, Dean.”
It was the love that made the memories.
“As a little brother who will
Hearing the distinctive crunch of gravel displaced by tires, Dean watches from the window as Cas pulls up to the bakery in a late-eighties Ford pickup. The truck rumbles to a stop beside the Impala as Cas puts it in park and kills the engine. He hops out of the driver’s seat wearing a pair of clean brown boots, form-flattering jeans, and a gray V-neck sweater pulled over a white button-up.
“The plan is to take a piece of human soul and temporarily bind it with what is left of Castiel’s grace. Once that happens, the Empty will only sense Cas as a misplaced soul and reject him, returning him to where he last was on Earth,” Jack explained.
comes, that means he’ll probably bring Jo, and then I can maybe, actually… you know. Make some headway there.”
The sunlight filtering through Cas’s netted headpiece reflects such stunning pools of ice blue that Dean is frozen in place. “I was just thinking.”
Castiel closes up the Impala and matches step with Dean as they start to walk to the house. “Thank you for coming out here, Dean. It’s good to see you.” Having someone other than his brother visit is something Castiel hasn’t done in quite some time.
sound like that!”
“It can go on the farm with the cows.”
“Oh fuck yeah, give it all to me.” Cas’s warmth coating his hand and the blissed-out smile lighting up his lover’s face send Dean chasing Cas over the edge.
Dean groans and slides his face away to bury it in Cas’s neck. “If you keep it up with the Spanish, we’re never gonna get
He’s not sure if he’s more intimidated or turned on.
By the time Castiel gets home, it’s well past 10 p.m. He navigates the pickup down the well-tread dirt drive and parks it beside the large maple tree in front of the squat, single-story farmhouse. Twirling his keyring around one finger, Castiel hums the chorus of the song that had just been playing on the truck’s radio as he makes his way to the front door. With a metal-on-metal click, he unlocks the deadbolt and pushes his way inside where warm kitchen lights greet his entry. He finds Gabriel sitting with his legs propped on the quaint dining table, flipping through one of Castiel’s old home decor magazines, Jack having long since been put to bed.
The crowd applauds and a few people cheer.
With another nod, hair falling almost in his eyes, Jack runs off—Dean makes a mental note to bust Cas’s chops about getting the kid to a barbershop soon. He gets up and watches as Jack practically tackles Cas in a bear cub hug, then tugs on his sleeve. “What was that all about?” Cas asks, laughing. He bends down so Jack can put both of his little hands around his ear to relay the message from Dean.
“Well, not for the purposes of securing a mate, if that’s what you mean.”
Dr. Novak.”
“It’s no big deal.”
“I apologize if I overstepped. You just really looked like you could use a hug.” Cas moves to open the door.
Castiel shrugs. “Um, yes. This is the bird professor.”
Dean blinks, mouth apt to catch flies. “
“Mhm. My bees help pollinate many of the local crops.”
Castiel jolted as if he’d only just dozed off. “Dean,” he said softly, leaning forward to rest his forearms on his knees. “How are you feeling?” The hard lines under his eyes appeared even more sunken than before, somehow. (Hadn’t he been asleep for the past six months?) In the dim light of the bedside lamp, Dean could make out a bloodshot canvas behind those beautiful irises, the skin around Castiel’s eyes puffy and red.
Dean leans forward, hands on his knees. “What do you think, Jack? Do you feel like a spaceman in that suit?”
Sitting beside the motel room door on a battered bench with chipped white paint, Dean studies the dark screen on his phone as if it holds the answers to how the hell he’s going to make this thing work. He’d been putting on his game face for Cas, but now that he’s stopped moving, reality starts to settle in.
The bench skit ends. Four new performers are chosen and are split into two teams. On each team, one person is the ‘action figure’ and the other person is responsible for moving the action figure’s arms, legs, and head to act out a scene. While the two action figures are maneuvered into human-shaped motorcycles, shopping carts, and more, Dean finds himself laughing so hard that tears dew the crinkles of his eyes. Once he can breathe again, he wipes his eyes and finishes his drink, sitting back with a contented sigh.
After another moment of hesitation, Castiel nods. “Thank you, Gabriel. I owe you one.”
knew, didn’t you? You had to know how I felt. You used to be able to read minds, for Christ’s sake. And goodness knows you could always see clear through me.”
“You sure can, buddy,” Dean replies, hoisting Jack onto one hip. “Sam, this is Jack, Cas’s nephew. And his brother Gabriel.”
“That ain’t true, Chuck!” he calls, jogging after her so that they both reach Baby at the same time. She shoots him a dry look over the top of the car, a bitch face to rival the best of Sam’s, one eyebrow cocked in disbelief. He grins at her, letting his dimples out in full force. “Why’re you asking me to come with you if I’m so lame, huh?”
sound. Dean fakes a gag and pushes her back across the seat, then wipes at his cheek quickly, trying to rub away the spot where her lips touched. Charlie smacks his arm. “Just drive, asshole. Time for drinks!”
As the credits roll, Cas scowls. “Wait, why doesn’t Chewie get a medal? Is it because he’s not human?”
The crackling between bones flooded up into his shoulders and down through his ribs by the time the last dregs of inspiration escaped through dry tender fingertips.  In his periphery, he spotted the persistent flashing once more.  Coming back out of his hermetically sealed tiny bubble of the universe, he invited the rest of existence in now that he deemed the writing beast slain for the time being.  Fully intending on napping beneath the cool wisps of air swirling down from ceiling fan in the next room, he instead switched off the floor lamp and tossed himself onto the nearby office couch.   Reclaiming his root power napping surface of choice, the top of his summer quilt was cool from his long absence.  He felt around his nightstand in the dark until his palm landed on the cold neglected device.  Mental exhaustion from such a long stretch made him forget why he had grabbed the nagging phone all together and he let it rest against his sternum.  When learning the reason for the repeated disturbances strictly by skin to plastic contact failed, he squinted at the retina bleaching bright light of the screen and tapped the flashing messages.
Naked feet dragged him into the backyard to surrender the short lived heat passed from the agent’s amorous affections to the moonlit sky.  Under the stars, he imagined waking the next morning to expertly brewed coffee, the next week’s run around the neighborhood in the agent’s oversized hoodie, that weekend’s binge watching marathon, the love they would make under the scrutiny of well-lit faces on the flat screen, and the trees they would plant the following season.  The moon’s gravity on the planet buzzed in his celestially blessed ears for the first time in weeks, a singular sensation of oneness with his father’s creation.  Instantly he wanted to give it back, deafen himself to its lulling hymn.  He didn’t need it.  All he needed were the warm pops of the agent’s records in his ears, his sighs as he slept, the baritone vibrations of him singing along to an old record with intertwined fingers as they grew too fragile to stand up from their perch on the bare floor without creaks of their own.  He turned his head up to feel the call of moonlight on his face, sense its chill through his eyelids and breathe in the cold night air.  So quickly after his Grace’s assimilation, his skin blocked the uncomfortable sensation.  Pretending the small hairs on his skin shifting provided any information other than the direction of air currents around him was forced like trying to drive a nail into a wall with a stick of butter.  The chafing anger, useless as it was defeating, crawled under his scalp.  The molten power of his Grace synthesizing under the ethereal light did little to sooth him as natural as it felt.
“This goes both ways, Dean.  You can ask me anything,” he simpered.
He sent a contemplative look at the floor, not daring to let his little brother’s big browns dissuade him from putting up an epic fight to keep pouting until he was good and ready to let it go.  “Why doesn’t he just whoosh all the lights back on?”
“I’m aware of that,” he said, drawing him out.  His tone and body language reclined into careful observation.
The angel wrenched up Sam’s layers of shirts exposing his tensing core.  His adrenaline soaked breath forced its way out through questioning stammers.  A firm hand pushed against his flexing stomach and he let out a short yelp in surprise.  Thirty seconds of prodding and searching later, Cas turned his head to Dean and nodded.  A fraction of disappointment played off of his features as he removed his hands and walked away, turning his back to his dumbfounded friend.
Months after Mick gave himself up battered and bloodied he was still nowhere to be found.  Between bouts with strong painkillers, he provided verbal testimony of his misdeeds ranging back long before Sam first winked at him across his cluttered office desk.  Sam asked all the right people, turned up every stone within reach, but resorted to tapping Charlie against his better judgment.  It wasn’t her personality or work ethic in question; still the Mick/Dean debacle left a terrible taste in his mouth.  She just happened to be the sour fruit laid at the plate’s rim, reminding him of the foul ingredients that resulted in his boyfriend’s fall.
“Shh, shh.” The voice that befalls her ears is familiar but it can’t be who she thinks it is.
“Oh, he’s not a fan of ‘rabbit food’. Dean would be more likely to bring me home steak and burgers.” Castiel forgets to mention that she has no home to relax in and that she hasn’t seen or spoken to her so-called ‘man’ in months. She is too afraid to return back to the bunker, worried that going there will lead her brothers back to the Winchesters.
“Stubborn one,” Rowena scoffs, dabbing Castiel’s heated skin with cool touches of wet hands. “It won’t be much longer, my dear. Only a matter of hours.”
Looking down at him now, Castiel wonders if what they are doing now counts as a relationship. Dean does sleep in her bed but he still keeps his clothing and other belongings in his own room. Castiel keeps very little in her room, maybe she should move into his instead. The idea brings a smile back to Castiel’s lips. Dean is accommodating to her, overtly caring in his own ways. If Castiel’s stomach rumbles, Dean is quick to ask what she wants for dinner, making it seem as if he is the one that was hungry so as to not overwhelm her. Castiel hopes that when she becomes human, Dean will be as considerate as he is now. She knows that she won’t be of as much help without her powers but still Castiel doesn't want to be useless to the Winchesters.
“An-and sprinkles? Cas,” Sam shakes his head. “I know you can’t taste flavors but, man, that is worse than pregnancy food.”
“I know.” Calloused fingers knead plush thighs. Pointed nails dig into her hips, forcefully rocking them back and forth. “I know,” he says.
Dean returns home rather late in the night, his feet sore and soaked in sweat. He does not expect for anyone to occupy the entry rooms as he steps down the stairs. He imagines Sam would be sleeping the stress of the day off, their angel friend keeping a close eye on him. But instead Dean finds Castiel crouched in on herself, hands clasped to her forehead as if she were praying. It seems silly now that they know who God really is, how he has been watching them for years. Lying to them for years. Yet here Castiel was praying to a God that would not listen.
Castiel slowly separates herself from the older Winchester, allowing space for Sam’s searching hands to pat Dean’s face. Dean groans, his head lulling to the side. Both Castiels and Sam’s eyes water, overwhelmed with emotion. Dean’s closed lids twitch before they blink awake.
Sam’s muscles visibly relax, “Cas. Oh God, I thought…”
Not once has she ever fallen for a being so quickly but this child has stolen what was left of the heart she hadn’t given away to Dean. He bore her heart to hold and keep as she has beared the infant's body for months to keep him safe. Castiel truly has fallen in every way imaginable and all of it was worth this one moment caught staring into the mismatched eyes of her child.
Castiel stands on sore legs and Dean meets her halfway, catching her before she falls. Castiel’s hands fist in the back of his shirt, her cheek pressing tight to his chest as she whispers “Dean” to deaf ears. Encircling his arms around her, Dean combs his fingers through her tangled hair. He shuts his eyes, reminiscing a memory of the ‘last night on Earth’ he spent with her.
“Hours? I can’t - I won’t…” Castiel struggles to breathe pass her words. It’s becoming difficult for her to think of anything other than the pain that she feels. With her next scream, the trees rattle. She shakes wayward on the bed, tossing her head back and forth. There’s fear that she feels, worry filling her. Castiel is scared and all that she has is a witch she can barely trust watching over her. She could die and Dean would never know that Castiel loved him. All he would think is that Rowena had taken their child because who else could care for them if it was only the two of them locked in this cabin.
“I love him,” Castiel doubtlessly confesses.
“Zues is the king among greek Gods,” Castiel adds to the debate. “But he is not my son.”
What they have now, is a simple life. It’s something Castiel did not have before, a small family one of her own that she could get used to. They have a steady routine that’s come to grow around their environment.
Castiel knows that he would be a good father. She has seen it before when Dean had lived a year with Lisa and her son. She see’s how fatherly he acts with Claire Novak and how he treats young victims they encounter. Maybe… it would not be so bad to bear his child. Even if that meant that Castiel would not be there to watch that child grow.
She does her best to stand tall, to hold the quiver she feels watching Dean and his brother touching their hands to their mothers’ grave. Castiel watches the man she loves say goodbye to his mother, to his brother, to the demon and the witch that they have found themselves tied to. Castiel can hardly bear it; the walls of a soldier falling at the altar of God himself.
. It’s been drilled into her head for ages that a Nephilim must never be brought into existence. Castiel's heart twists.
“Oh, Jack is a marvelous name!” Rowena chimes in, “Simple and gracious.”
’, the
Castiel sits at the bunker's library, waiting with her hands folded for a hopeless wish to not be filled. After all, Dean Winchester must have died. If he hadn't sacrificed himself in a stupidly heroic way, existence would be no more. Castiel's chest aches at the thought, unable to imagine what her life could be without Dean.
Castiel screams a heart wrenching scream, shattering glass from the mirrors to the windows. If where she chose to live and give birth to her child were not closed off to private grounds deep in the woods, Castiel would worry that her neighbors would call the sheriff. Even now, Castiel isn’t certain whether she is safe from spying eyes as many like to hike nearby and her screams reach much further than those of a normal human. Castiel’s fingers tether in the sheets, her eyes clenched tightly shut. Sweat beads down her flushed cheeks as Castiel withers in pain.
“Guys!” Dean. The voice sounds like Dean, the body pressed behind her feels like Dean. Castiel cries out as her contractions come back to haunt her. She pushes involuntarily, second nature in the act. A second push comes and she’s squeezing the make believe Dean's hand like a vice.
Sam laughs, drawers slamming shut as he scrummages through the pantries. Instantaneously, the two separate into their own little worlds, preoccupied with thoughts that don’t pertain to the other. Castiel nibbles on her peanut butter pickle, glaring down at a speck of crumbs on the table. She thought about what Sam said about her snack - was it really an odd choice? Castiel did not think so, in fact she has been craving it all day, waiting just for one moment of peace where she could unravel. It was a little strange though, if Castiel were becoming more human, then she would be able to taste the differing flavors in this snack would not she? Shrugging, Castiel taking another bite of the pickle.
The hunter does not reach under the pillow like he usually would - it does not matter because there is no gun there - but he does wind his arm behind his back, blindly searching for Castiel. Finally, his fingers reach her hand clutching the sheets, soothing it with his thumb.
“Come on, baby. Just a little more.” Dean whispers in her ear, maybe nothing more than a fond memory.
The doctor's bouts of laughter continue to ring through the air. “My, my! He really does spoil you! In that case then, please be sure to cook homemade nutritious food more often. Slow down on the pickles, we wouldn’t want to upset your tummy anymore than it already is.”
Stifling a frown, Castiel nods her head. She knows.
“D-Don’t take him away… Please…” Castiel begs on her last breath, “Not while I’m still alive…”
“Well, I didn’t know it was a bug at first!” Castiel blubbers to defend herself, “I just saw a blur of something! I-I didn’t know what it was!”
Castiel knows now that she is home. That wherever Dean is is her home.
She cannot possibly bear a little body with a little heart inside her stomach. It is unheard of; not in thousands of years. Nephelim tend to be birthed by female humans, not by angels. Yet she could feel a new grace inside her, a child of her own. Castiel worries. She worries for Dean. She worries for herself. In situations where a human becomes pregnant with a nephilim they die giving birth. For an angel, she is not sure what the outcome would be. Would Castiel meet the same fate and if Castiel died, what would Dean do? Would he accept it? Could he move on from her death?
“Guys,” the voice repeats. ”Cas ain’t looking so good.”
Some much slower than others.
Castiel's borrowed heart quickly thumps in her chest. Her breath wrecked, limbs faintly numb. Castiel feels at peace for the first time in a long time. She keeps warm with her nose burrowed in the curve of another body’s neck, their arms loosely wrapped around her. If Castiel closed her eyes, just for a moment, she could dream that the world was not ending. That the time she spent sprawled out in this bed with Dean would not be their last. Castiel breathes a sigh of relief as Dean presses their bodies flush together, his palm rubbing soothing circles along the small of her back.
Their child bores their eyes into the two of them - gazes at the soul of his mother and father.
Dean does not buy a word Castiel is saying and she knows he knows. “You saw a bug?”
Castiel follows his lead, the same way she would follow him to Lucifer. She lets herself be handled like fine china because now, having realised what that shock was, Castiel feels vulnerable. Dean’s arms come to wrap around Castiel’s shoulders, pulling her flush to his chest. Her ear rests just above Dean’s heart and she lets the rhythmic beats calm her. Less than a minute later, Dean’s heavy arms hold her down and he starts to snore. Castiel does not have the same luxury. She starts to count Dean's heartbeats, restarting every one hundredth beat. By now Castiel is at eight hundred and sixty two, and still her eyes are manic. Castiel shuts her eyes, shuttering a shaky breath. She cannot be. Castiel’s palm presses to her stomach.
One morning, Castiel is digging through the high pantries. The counter pokes her stomach as she reaches for the jar of peanut she hides from the boys. Her pants fit a little tighter around her waist but gaining a little weight whilst eating as much as she does is expected. Though Castiel isn’t sure why her grace struggles to maintain Jacklyn's body like it had before. Castiel’s fingers glimpse just past the jar she is looking for, nudging it closer to the edge until it falls into the palm of her hand. Grinning with pride, Castiel sits at the kitchen table, opening her jar of peanut butter. Reaching into her trench coat, Castiel pulls out a new bottle of sprinkles. She dumps the sprinkles into the half empty jar of peanut butter, then picks up a pickle to dunk into the new mixture.
“And that… freaked you out?” Dean raises his eyebrow at her.
Castiel uses the references she found on Pinterest as the backbone to her work. Dean and Castiel paint the walls a sky blue when Jack sleeps, allowing the many new lamps to reflect enough light to brighten the room. Castiel insists they add a rainbow with fluffy white clouds and butterfly stickers to the wall. Just below the ceiling is a cardstock lining of the alphabet in big bold letters for when Jack is ready to learn his first words. The dresser becomes a proper dresser, carrying stuffed animals and a basket of toddler toys on top and clothes inside. Castiel makes for a bossy mother she learns as she gets what she wants, which in this case is a new baby changing station from Babies R’ Us, her new favorite store.
Words fail the law school dropout, a frog or something stuck in his throat. Sam’s eyes widen after he turns, gaze captured on the two sprawled out on the floor. On Dean breathing in the bunker.
For now, Castiel is content to keep the nephilim's creation a secret.
She swallows down three pills, the number more than necessary. Castiel haphazardly pulls the covers underneath her chin, arm resting protectively over her stomach. She wills her eyes close, biting on her bottom lip. Already, the sleep aids kick in, doing their job to make Castiel drowsy.
The days have passed them by in a blur since Dean’s return back to the bunker. As of yet, neither brother has gone out to hunt, the two of them settling down for the time being to refocus themselves. Though Castiel overhears Sam when he is on the phone with other hunters, rambling on about the monster of the week that he hopes they will take care of for them. Sam does not tell Dean about these calls and neither does Castiel. She tells herself it is for his own protection, that if Dean goes out now then maybe he would be too distracted to come back.
“Dean…” The name escapes her parted lips a second before the world goes black.
That is all and if Castiel falls - if she becomes human once again - she wouldn’t mind.
Her arms come to wrap around her slightly rounded belly, rubbing soothing circles around the supple skin poking out from under her shirt. Castiel's brows furrow, her gaze locked onto her midriff. Grace sparks an electric shock into her belly again, a wisp of a beating heart. Castiel shuts her eyes, a silent tear slipping down her cheek. No… Stuttering a breath, Castiel reaches for her pelvis bone. A sting of her own grace carves within her, etching sigils of protection. A enochian spell that hides the body growing inside Castiel from other angels – similar to the sigils she once carved into both Dean and Sam’s rib cages.
Castiel sits at the head of her bed, a book in hand. Beside her the dim light illuminates Dean’s figure, his arms bent in awkward angles, one leg hanging off the bed. Castiel smiles as she cards her fingers through Dean’s ruffled hair. They have not talked about what happened between them yet but Dean has been spending more time beside her when his occupation allows it. He has been doing well considering how two months ago Dean was ready to face his own death, having no hope to come back home. Color drains from Castiel’s face, her stomach knotting the same way that it does daily. There is a fear that comes with letting Dean leave for a hunt, especially when the two brothers say it is not necessary for Castiel to come with. She should be use to staying home, finding a chore for her to do elsewhere, whether that is lazing around or out searching for a weapon to defeat the next big bad. But with every new day, Castiel’s anxiety rises. That unease in her belly grows.
. On the site, Castiel can simply type “baby clothes” into the search engine and dozens of ‘mood boards’ would pop up of cute outfit schemes and ladybug pjs. Whether Dean likes them or her child is born a male or female, Castiel is certain to find the perfect clothes just for them. She spends mindless hours where she is not preoccupied with monsters and ghouls simply scrolling through the site to find adorable little bows and fedoras. She looks up “nursery rooms” hoping for inspiration on how to set up the room beside hers once the baby is here.
“Sam?” His voice is rough with gravel; Dean rubs the sleep dust out of the corner of his eye.
“Jack, really? He should have a fierce name - like Zues.” Dean proudly puffs out his chest, raising his chin.
Some nights though… Some nights worry her because as the minutes pass, Castiel finds her own eyes drooping with fatigue. She tires and falls asleep beside the human, opening her eyes hours later to Dean brushing hair out of her face. It takes a fight for her not to jump out of bed in the morning to rush to the bathroom, her stomach feeling queasy. Mayhaps it is an after effect to falling, that sleeping with Dean in a carnal way has impacted the process. That feeling in her stomach that tickles at her throat couldn’t be anything more than nerves. She remembers that anxiety quite well the last time she was human. Castiel is nervous; happy as she snuggles closer to Dean, mumbling a “good morning”.
Despite the flood of hormones racing through his system and the high they brought with them from touching his silent friend, after the credits rolled, he had to get to bed.  Contemplating the consequences of being late to another team briefing constricted said hormones’ effects on him.  They were still pulsating through him, but it helped him get a reign on his machinations.  Hopefully he wouldn’t wake Cas in the morning while preparing for work, but if experience with the pseudo angel taught him anything, it was that he was not a morning person.  Maybe he would offer him the bed after he arose.  Simple small rubs up and down his back rustled Cas out of his embrace.  Sleep pulled at his eyelids and he leaned towards him adorably still needing his warmth.  He lilted his head and yawned.
As the smell of rosemary and garden fresh crushed tomatoes suffused the room, peace expanded inside his chest like the first deep breath of warm sun on a summer morning.  Dean placed the mixing spoon on the rest beside the stove and caught Castiel’s stare.  His call for direct focus softened as he watched the agent lightly scratch at the back of his neck.  In that very moment, he wondered when his tell became so obvious.  That self-aware moment sent his thoughts dribbling from his mouth.  “Before I met you I imagined I had seen everything the world could throw at me.  I understood what I had been trained for and prepared for situations regardless if I had all the pertinent information or not.  I knew when to ask for help and when not to offer my hand.  Now, I tally up all the questions I have each day, especially about you, but each night the number only gets larger and larger.  There are things I know you won’t tell me, can’t tell me for whatever reason.  We all have our secrets, but could we do that mind meld thing again?  When you are ready, of course.”
“I believe in us, Sam.  It’s just… I know Ketch is becoming dangerously unstable: backed into a corner with the walls closing in.  It’s more likely he will get sloppy, out himself before long anyway...  Does his partner know anything?  Have you said anything to him?”
“It’s the right thing to do.  You’ll come to believe it as well.”
“It all makes sense…  You got laid,” he smiled bouncing his fingertips against each other like a scheming younger sibling across a shared kitchen table.
“Let me help, alright?” he urged.
“It would appear so,” he took up the broom for emphasis.
, he disrupted Dean assertively, almost annoyed at the suggestion.
The concern dripping from Missouri and Pamela’s faces came into focus as Claire babbled about each color crayon she used to layer shapes onto each other.  Every night they parked on a gravel driveway that ended on the far side of the brewery building.  It was closest to the bunker entrance and he didn’t want small feet to trek near the big machines on the entrance side.  To the unfamiliar observer, that particular entryway looked exactly like what one would conjure up when imagining a covert entrance to a super villain’s lair: a thick brown doorway dug several feet into the side of a hill at basement level, common brick work the only accent surrounding it, industrial pipe hand rails, and not a window in sight.  Through that lens, he was surprised that Claire hadn’t drawn a spandex suited minion dragging a suspiciously large blood soaked duffle bag up the stairs.  For all intents and purposes they did live in a basement, he’d grant them that.  It just happened to be the most awesome basement ever.  There was zero chance he would unpack any of that to Missouri, though.  His daughter’s rendition of their front door contained all the correct components, but the night time theme she drew them in made it look like a man scientist’s laboratory service door it very well may have been at some point.
“Sorry, it’s just so… awesome.  Will you do another one like this?”  He tore his eyes from overhead to the man across from him.
He smiled in kind and savored one last kiss to his cheek, sorting his favorite elements of it from one-of-a-kind to best.  In turn, Dean gripped his jacket even tighter and sucked deep drags of him in.
Their business expense card had very few charges on it, but he couldn’t help but lift up his menu to obscure how violently his eyed bugged out reading the prices for each entrée.
His lower eyelid twitched as a nebulous agitation galloped back and forth across his fatigued but no less noble features.  Standing up straighter seemed to expand his presence twice as tall.  Swallowing indecision down, he tossed his head at the open living room.  “Follow me,” he commanded like a decapitating argument.
James stared at him clearly chilled.  He looked more like he was formulating a plan to burn a misshapen cloud from the sky than meeting a friendly stranger.  He stood taller and extended an arm, never budging from his position on the wall.
“You know what I mean,” he blushed.
“We need an angel,” he affirmed into the silence of the library.
He pulled his hand out of reach and looked away.  “I was out of my head worrying if you’d ever come back to me.  I couldn’t sleep or eat, fuckin’ terrified you left me forever, again.  And you go fall in love with some guy whose name you can’t even say of in front of me!”
Immediately energized by one last shot, he grabbed his phone and stared at the search bar blankly.
“Just up and left one day?”
Pink and orange pastels lined the horizon past his steering wheel as he headed westward.  Time seemed to slow as long as he kept his foot on the gas, like it would take generations for the sunlight make way for night.  He leisurely pointed Baby’s fender towards the only swatch of red in the distance.  Names of the towns he knew fell behind him as he headed south until he could pick one out again.  His stomach rumbled but his churning thoughts kept him sated, if a bit listless.  By the time the softly tinted clouds dropped their hues to reflect nothing but the darkness overhead, he turned back northeast to where the towns he could name crept up like semi-trucks whizzing past his ears.  Street lamps were stamped closer and closer together when Baby begged for a refuel.  Gas was a full ten cents more per gallon where he stopped than back home, but as she chugged it down none the wiser it gave him an opportunity to make a call he was dreading.
“Qatar?” he suggested, clearly uneasy if he could even point it out on a map.
“Wait, wait.  Don’t move,” he replied, his voice so far beneath him it sounded like he was calling out to him from the bottom an ostentatiously large private pool.
“You had your reasons,” he said solemnly.  “Although in the future I prefer we speak candidly about any conflicts that arise instead.”
During his drive down long stretches of county highway connecting to rural roads and back again, he attempted to digest all Anna conveyed to him.  Her assertions made his mind itch at a disparate irritation.  With how little he knew about his siblings’ recent past he still couldn’t scratch it into submission.  If his failure to conform that day made as big of a ripple as she said, maybe he made the world a better place in some respects.  But Balthazar had taken just as large of a risk, tossing all their effort to make their way in the real world into the incinerator once he returned.  If this new status quo was real, maybe the truths he told his psychiatrist in the months after his ex-communication were just a self-soothing narrative of his own design.  Staring into the dashing yellow lines in front of him didn’t hold the answers he sought either, so he swept the unknowable into the recesses of his mind and made his way back to Lebanon feeling lighter and heavier all at the same time.
He shook his head and let the coffee warm his hands for a moment before taking the first tentative sip.  “Thank you.  This guy has been sleeping since I got here at two.”  He looked at his watch and bared his teeth realizing something urgent.  “You mind if I…?” his thumb pointed at the stairwell leading out of the building, pleading with his eyes.
Dean lifted a finger up into the air, and then grabbed an arm crossed over Castiel’s warm chest to drag him out of the room.  The other agent’s eyes covertly followed them as they passed into the living room and behind the dividing wall kitty corner to the kitchen.  Once out of view, Dean realized he couldn’t initiate their ‘conversations’.  Their tactile bond was entirely within Castiel’s power.  Could he even speak to him without manually speaking like normal humans?  He had to try if he wanted to secure Castiel’s trust.  With a grand inhale, he grabbed both of his hands, drilling a purposeful stare into his steely contumacious glare.  All of his focus drew into those perfect orbs.
His tan hand patted the mattress and reclaimed space around the lid of the container.  There he waited for Dean to settle down prone on the bare mattress.  Feeling exposed but faking preparedness the best he could, he pulled the bottom hem of his shirt up just enough to give Cas the clearance he needed.  A rigid huff cascaded down his belly and he nodded resolutely.
“You okay, Sammy?” Dean dashed to his side helping him stand up from the table.  The tape recorder sparked and popped, suffering the fit of a cranky raijyu mildly disturbed from slumber, hurling it onto the wooden floor.
They exchanged their own farewells and Dean ripped himself from the battered office chair.
A couple miles outside of town, Claire’s black hole stare in the rearview mirror nudged him into awareness.  “What’s up, lil’ pup?  You excited about having dinner with the Mills boys?”
Love brighter than fireworks flared at the enveloping blanket the agent tried tossing over his anguish.
The stranger turned his head and half smiled at him.  An extended sigh broke free from him as he gripped the jacket a bit tighter.
“Not likely.  Assuming no one knows about the bunker’s connection to the Men of Letters aside from the three of us.”
His eyes strained against the field a few feet above him where the rigid outline of a man firmly shouted at him.  The voice he knew in his bones, but the words cramped in on each other in hollering octaves.  Deciphering it felt like he was trying to taste Latin.  Grim confusion gripped him the more he was shouted at.  Gradually this man’s tone calmed and Cas’s vision clarified.  This man had a clear shot directly at his head.  Past the still barrel of his gun arched the arms of a sternly defensive green eyed man.  His strong jaw uttered concerned words one after the other in his direction as he ducked into the grassy mutilated knoll and withdrew his gun back into his jacket.  With his final step forward his vexed but assertive face snapped into focus.  Wait…
“You can leave it to me.  You haven’t made any progress with the case since you ate Dean’s first attempt at preparing Pad Thai.  I think you are suffering from gastric distress.  You hit the – go to bed, and I’ll make sure it’s taken care of,” he dismissed Sam’s efforts and overly cautious tone.
He could feel the eyelashes fluttering up and down, the hand on his chest lightly clenching and unclenching between inhales cut lengthwise.  “Hm?”
He crossed his arms as he recounted his interactions with the calm but quiet man.  “Then it’s something psychological keeping our fighter pilot from speaking.  Did the first test results pull anything up interesting?”
“Hello, Dean,” he half smiled.  It wasn’t a full gummy grin, but that was never in the angel’s repertoire.  Maybe someday he could find a way to stir it out of him.
“How did you get the Impala back up here?  I thought were still low on juice?”  A ticklish curiosity needed to be sated despite the comfortable embrace he had no inclination to pull away from.
The rich laughter that erupted from Dean turned the bubbling heat in Castiel’s belly to a delightful simmer.
Cas could have fed off of those little whines of want for days, but he had to get him out of his clothes as soon as possible.  Imagining his hunter indulging in his desire for him set his focus on the mystery of the wandering tattoos up to eleven.  To his surprise Dean pulled his fingers out of his mouth and launched his lips towards his, gliding them against his insistent on gaining entry.  He obliged but quickly ripped his thick jacket off of his shoulders, making fast work of pulling at the bottom of his t-shirt.  They separated for just long enough to toss the printed black shirt off into the emptiness of the dark room.  Tongues found each other between slick pink lips, wandering past teasing into urgent swipes.  He heard himself groan back as Dean reached up to unto his tie, but the Angel halted Dean’s urgent pursuit.  Cas stopped his disrobing, but Dean chased his mouth as he withdrew lips.
Lastly Garth reviewed inventory and delivery responsibilities and how the pieces all fell together.  Not one of them stepped on the brewmaster’s toes.  No one touched the brew once it left the Lauter tun except Benny.  Measurements and timekeeping were up to Benny and Dean alone.  No one seemed bothered by the sidelining, but it placed Castiel in a peculiar position.  The Winchesters insisted he learn the craft hands on.  As an industry and social outsider, he was entrusted with something very precious.

“When you were with ‘the agent’,” he found the vernacular uncomfortable, but far less unwieldy than ‘the other me’.  “You said he gave you everything.  I’m gonna need a track list.” His eyebrows wiggled obnoxiously even though his tone was clearheaded.
The lingual calculation tallied into understanding with an endearing squint Dean came to enjoy.
“I… I don’t know.  Like you said, there’s a lot about this we don’t know.  For what it’s worth, I don’t think Cas would do anything to hurt us… any of us.  And you said yourself, Cas escaped the Malkuth.  If anything, that would be a great reason to stay away from them at all costs.”
The hilltop winds battered the shabby trees and season worn fence outside of the model home.  Restlessly bouncing a leg under the steering wheel, Sam felt like he had been sitting shiva on a broken tailbone mulling over all of Mick’s objectively questionable antics.  He parked behind Mick’s car on the cul-de-sac to survey the house from a distance.  No other cars were parked near the desolate micro neighborhood let alone within a mile of his destination.  Only the faint glow of the moon above illuminated the sparsely decorated rooms inside.  If it wasn’t Mick who beckoned him here, we would have considered this place perfect for an ambush.  Even still, he thought bitterly.
“It’s not that,” he started walking back towards the production floor.  “Just his communication style isn’t for everyone.”
Dean let his back fall against the opposite wall, mirroring the reclined position his person of interest was in.  His breath caught in his throat staring at the face he fought so hard to memorize.  Fuck, in person he had a completely feeling about him.  It wasn’t spring-loaded snarky disregard, but inert with time weary focus on his surroundings, like he was waiting for the inevitable second shoe to drop.  The short sleeved button down he wore had the top two buttons pulled open, like the swampy air in the small gallery grew too thick as the night wore on.  His hair had more product than in his online photo, but looked disheveled; maybe the last touches before the show opened were all overhead.  Work-worn dark jeans clung to his thighs and calves, but were rolled up over his black work toe scuffed boots. He was put together in a way that screamed scrappy experience complimented by small crow’s feet that only appeared when he blinked.
“I wasn’t…” he mumbled into submission. Truth was he rated his hands right up there with his ass as one of his most compelling features, but voicing such a point was potentially more embarrassing than outright ogling him.  Those wide palms and talented digits scored a solid 9.5, the .5 only being subtracted presently because they weren’t making his skin sing with the barest touch.  His clear pacific blue eyes though could start wars, stop hurricanes, and halt a grizzly in its tracks.  No rating system could define them.  The pills found their way into his mouth ahead of a gulp of still a bit too hot coffee in the congested silence.
“How often are you pumping out books, then?”
Dean shuffled all of his brother’s displeased expressions and landed on his favorite configuration to toss in his direction.  “Don’t do that.  We’ve been combing through the few books we have over and over and I caught something you missed.  Don’t be a bitch about it,” he leaned over and pointed at the image on the following page.  A hunched over angel pressing a hand to a gold-leaf inlayed feather lying at his feet at was printed at the center of the page.   “All we need is an angel feather.”
A day-in-the-life of an agent interlude.
A proud huff finally sabotaged his earnest attempt to stare right into his soul.  “When’s the last time that happened?”
About eleven thirty, he made his way back to the kitchen to return a dirty glass to the sink after the first movie in the series ended.  He didn’t even bother turning on the light as he could see well enough not to wreck any glasses in the sink using the residual light from the hallway lights.  The second he lifted his hand back out of the nearly empty sink, a thick static filled the air and the smell of an incoming storm swirled around him.  He brushed it off and turned back to the hallway to make his way back to his room to start the second movie when the lights flickered and sputtered off and on.  If he stood still enough, he wouldn’t have to think about why this way happening.  Nope, not my problem, he affirmed.  The light jittered back on fully and he let out an even though elongated exhale.   His naked feet padded back towards his room purposefully.  His ears isolated the end credit music of his first film above everything else until he stood right in front of the wall lamp by his room.  The wave of electricity between the filaments rippled, lit up brilliantly with a loud hum.  No no no no no, he grimaced as he careened into his room. If he didn’t see it, it couldn’t hurt him, he shouted at himself, unconsciously grabbing at his still achy belly.  Just as the door shut he saw the lamp’s bulb opposite of his closing door fizzle and violently pop into darkness.  All of the light bulbs in every fixture in room sizzled and flared out the instant after.  The only light left in his room was the scrolling credits on his laptop’s LCD screen.  The only other noise he could make out apart from the last tone of the credits was his own annoyed sigh.  This time replacing all the broken bulbs with the mountain of replacements in the basement it would be Dean’s job.
“The part of his book after Balthazar leaves and he struggles with his new life apart from everyone he knew.  If it weren’t for that free counselling at the night school he might never have graduated or been brave enough to pursue writing at all.”
A potently sad song reverberated in the headphones just as his spirits rose.  He moved to skip to another less harrowing one when he felt the slight vacuum waft air from under his door.  Two dull knocks sounded and his muffled groan permitted him entry.  He steeled himself at the sight of windblown hair complimented by a pair of nocturnal blue eyes that curved around the door.  A slightly down turned face found his eyes and wrinkled into a meek smile.  Dean’s heart began to pound much harder than anticipated despite the usually calming quality of their locked stares.  The usual coat was replaced by one of his Cas-me-down shirts and new pair of jeans he forced into his hands after the last secondhand pair saw one tear too many.  The sight of Cas in his hand-me-downs still triggered a deep baritone thumping in his chest.  In order to spare himself from the blood that darted too far south for his comfort when he saw Cas wrapped in his dark blue button downs, he dragged him to a store to supplement his meager assemblage of clothing.  The memory of their trip out brought with it an effortless smile.  His complaints about the unnecessary energy they expelled on his behalf were thoroughly rebuked.  He threw pair after pair of jeans over the changing room door and threatened him with tiny rings of holy oil until he broke down and settled on a couple.  His preferences did smack familiar of their own, but pops of color he would not have picked for himself squeaked their way into Cas’s selections.  There the object of such attention stood at the corner of his bed, eyes suddenly drifted down towards his socked feet.  His head canted lightly as his ever-observant eyes squinted, begging a question he cared not lend voice to.   Dean looked down to feel the sudden flow of air past his belly button and obvious rise of his shirt’s hem. Self-consciously he lifted his headphones off of his head, sat up against his pillows, and pulled his shirt down.  “Hey, Cas.”
“Sure thing, Dean,” he answered with a hard won smile.
He folded his arms over the edge of the table.  “I just assumed it was our sparks, but Cas did seem more suspicious of the electromagnetic interference.  That had to be his ‘Grace fluctuations’, right?  He never made it seem like a big deal, never acted like it put him in any pain, though.  You think he could have been hiding it from us?”
(See the end of the chapter for
An unexpected shiver spread over his skin.
“But, Cas, this was because of me!  It was my fault!”
He dug in his front pocket for his keys to let them into the windowless office space.  Why Ketch got a window and he didn’t he’ll never understand.  So what if he had a few more years’ experience and a few big cases under his belt.  Surely being the one making those connections that helped solve those cases was worth a tiny postage stamp of a window, right?  He flipped the light on and settled in while the other agent closed the door and plopped down on the only available chair.  Once his phone was on the desk and he turned his monitor on, he turned to her awaiting smile.  Hanscum was friendly, but he had never spoken to her outside of the conference room or her office as a matter of course.  There had to be a reason for her impromptu visit.  She pulled her phone out from her pocket and rested in on the desk pointedly.  She wanted him to know this conversation was being recorded, that she was in control even though it was his workspace they chatted in.
He assured himself that he understood.  He really did.  Breakups were exhaustive amorphous endeavors.  Even though he aimed to never break his own heart by affording himself a serious relationship again, in the handful of occasions he fell out of someone’s heart, he found the way back to the normalcy through someone else’s bedding.  It wasn’t fair to begrudge Cas his own methods, even if the distance chafed him.  “A’right.  Come to bed whenever you want,” he offered.
Ketch and Cas's first meeting.
“Let’s skip the part where you attempt to make my distance a defect of my character and get to business shall we?”  His tired sigh was cut short by another barb pressing into his ribs.
He followed his simple directions, which strangely headed onto a very familiar road not even a full mile from the Mill’s home.  The brick façade of the brewery came into view under his headlights and he was instructed to park on the opposite side of the building from where he normally parked.  Confusion and foreboding volleyed about as he heard himself speak, “Why are we back at the brewery?  Did you forget something?”
“Wait, you guys came up with this for me?” he asked, not sure how to parse the information.
An beguiled blush stretched from one ear to the other, filling his features with an adorable vibrancy Cas felt the overwhelming need to touch.  Dean looked away and pursed his lips until Cas’s hand found his warming jaw.  He stood taller, leaning closer into Cas, his eyes fixed on his lips.  Giddy desire clouded over his senses and he pushed forward, but the angel dodged his advance to whisper in his ear.  “Meet me outside of the armory in five minutes.”
“Oh, you need my notepad?  Sorry, I didn’t come in my work gear.  I’ll go find a pen and paper.”  He tried to stand, but the stranger grabbed his wrist to stop him faster than he thought possible and pulled it down to make him sit again.  His gaze was far off in the distance again, but he returned it to Dean with deliberate concentration.  Unlike at the bureau, he didn’t question the directive, even in his head.  He didn’t defend or negotiate or talk his way out of whatever was happening to him.  It felt like the sudden demand could be that small detail he needed. “Alright,” he lifted the empty hand that wasn’t in the stranger’s grasp.  “I’m not going anywhere.  I’m listening.”
Satisfied with his diagnoses, Dean let him go and backed off.  At least a few seconds were granted to Sam’s revolving reactions to the neigh assault before diving back into interrogation mode.  “Who did you let touch you without protection, Sam?”
“None of the previous owner’s notes are that distracting,” he affirmed.  “I was once ordered to sit with a devout Sicilian woman at her deathbed.  Her name was Franscesca.  The rest of her family perished in the war years before so she devoted herself to the word of God, looking for meaning in all of her loss.  With no one to be with her in her last moments, she read her leather bound bible, letting her fingers caress the pages of her favorite passages.  The thin paper made her copious notes bleed – she even made notes between lines like ‘Oh, see his mercy’.  At the time I had no doubt she meant every shred of reverence on every page that wore a scribble.  After watching over humanity for so long, it only occurred to me much later that some of those notes were sarcastic,” he squinted, holding his chin.  “I sensed no similar sentiments here.”
Cas rolled his eyes and chewed on a loaded chip.
“Hush, now. The wee angel did call me to assist her after all.” Rowena then turns her head toward Sam, arching her brow. “Then
With shaking hands, Castiel drops her phone. The realization comes that somehow Dean is well aware of the nephilim that will soon come to life. It should not surprise her and yet it terrifies her.
Dean’s forest green eyes bore deeply into Castiel’s own ocean blue orbs. His gaze holds resilience, a determination that Castiel understands all too well. She knows as she lowers her gaze that she cannot change his mind. The plan is set and Dean is more than ready to risk it all.
,” Cas corrects. “And I didn’t name him. He told me. He has reclaimed the name from one of the Fallen, the angel of clouds and weather. I’d say it suits him.”
“Jack?” Sam called, just as confused. Okay, so this was either shared hysteria or actually happening.
Laid bare in more than just the physical sense, Dean blushes furiously from chest to scalp. He bites his lip, entranced, watching Cas step out of his pants. Unsurprisingly, the sight of Cas thick and glistening before him only amplifies his arousal.
left on the floor around the table, and Gabe cackles.
From the kitchen, Dean hears the sounds of some sort of food being prepared and his mouth waters in anticipation of breakfast. But as he rounds the corner, he’s both surprised and enamored by what he sees.
Eventually, as his eyes begin to half-moon, Cas coaxes him into letting his wings fade between the dimensions, petting them and singing something soothing in Enochian all the while. The soft chant finally lulls the fledgling to sleep again.
Jack gives a gap-toothed grin, strawberry juice coating his teeth.
Dean takes his place and taps his feet ahead of the music, wishing for a pair of cowboy boots. Cas, the poor guy, seems fit to take flight. Dean gives him two thumbs up for motivation.
“It’s fine, man. Scared the hell out of me and I’ll probably have a bit of a bruise, but it’s not a problem.”
“If you show up at noon, that should be plenty of time. I’ll text you the address when I get home. Text me something now so I don’t forget?”
“Hello again, Dean. How can I help you today?” Castiel manages, the fluster on his face absent from his voice.
“I love you too, Cas. So much it hurts.”
Brains
Even Sam had gone off to spend time with Eileen after she rematerialized. And he’d agreed to bring Miracle along, at Dean’s insistence.
Dean’s eyes widened in panic as he glanced between the angel and the full voicemail box he’d completely forgotten to wipe before the ritual. Cas had heard it. He’d heard it all. Every curse and avowal. Every mournful cry.
He isn’t ready to have the talk he knows Sam will insist on having when Dean tells him what is really going on. Easier to
A good few moments of hysterical laughter pass before she says more clearly into her end of the line, “I am SO sorry. Please forgive my friend. It’s my fault he’s in this state. Have a good night!”
Perceiving the change, Cas pulls off to look up at Dean. “Something wrong?”
“I used to tell him that he was never alone as long as he could find the stars. Y’know, ‘cause we’re all made of stardust or whatever.” Dean laughs without amusement, flapping the cracked phone around as he gesticulates. “Learned it in astronomy class. Thought I was being poetic or some shit.”
what part of him you were referring to with
, damn it.
“Dean?”
“Hey, you silly bumblers! What’d I say about running around?” Castiel admonishes, but not without a hint of laughter seeping into his tone.
“Don’t be afraid, Dean.” Cas reaches out and pulls the orb against his chest, golden light streaking into his skin and dimming the object’s glow. At the same time, Dean is awed to once again see the shadow of Castiel’s brilliant wings flare out to either side of his trench coat, stretching well past Baby’s trunk and hood.
His breath catches in his throat.
Dean fiddled with the hem of his henley. They’d just gotten back from their trip across the world and, while he wasn’t a fan of the seasickness—or the land sickness that had followed, Dean knew he’d go anywhere with Castiel if given the chance.
,” Dean says, looking entirely too proud of himself.
If diapers and potty training are going to be involved, that’s on Cas.
Dean lines himself up along a storefront’s brick wall and peers into the alley.
“My apologies. Let me make it up to you,” Cas says and turns to the bartender. “Hey, Simon. Can I get two, please?”
telling Claire that if she was struggling, he was there to help and he would never turn any student away from his door. And when Claire had fully broken down and admitted her real issue wasn’t about engineering at all, Dean invited her to the Pride meeting he was planning on attending that afternoon, and encouraged her to bring this girl, Kaia, too.
He reloaded the file. He restarted the computer. Nothing helped.
“Castiel Novak,” He says, pitching his voice octaves lower, “May I ask who is speaking?”
At the foot of the stairs, he notices he’s not alone after all.
Healthy coping mechanisms be damned, he needs a drink. The guilt of having left the door unlocked bears down onto Dean’s shoulders and his father’s voice echoes in his mind, dredging up the memory of a time when Sam had run away on Dean’s watch.
“Thanks, dude,” Dean says, then steps away, swiping the back of one wrist under his nose. “Alright, enough of the chick flick stuff. Who wants to try some deserts?”
“Oh…?” Cas prompts, and his smug smile is back before he can stop it.
Gabriel holds the box in the crook of his elbow and rubs his hands together eagerly. “Okay! Who’s ready to roll?”
on those lips. They’re like— like clouds. Pink, puffy love couches...”
Sam, to his credit, stows any surprise he might be harboring and flashes a blinding smile. Dean lets out the tension he didn’t realize he’d been holding as Sam extends a hand. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Castiel.”
“Hey! I forgot to take my allergy pill that day, remember? And Nougat was all up in my face.” So what if he’d basically used the cat as a Kleenex during Ellie’s death scene? Cas just snorts, taking the defensiveness as confirmation, and Dean gives meaning to the term ‘throw pillow’ by tossing one at his boyfriend’s head.
“Well, yeah. I
In the phone’s reflection, he spots the moon and looks up, remembering all the times he wondered the exact same thing sitting outside motel rooms exactly like this while Sammy slept, their father who-knew-where for who-knew-how-long.
“Dean Winchester, that’s enough with the self-flagellation. Here’s what’s going to happen. You’re going to show me where you keep your medical supplies so I can take care of whatever you’ve got going on with your hand. And then we are going to talk about this determination of yours to let the weight of the world drag you down.”
“Sure, Cas. Happy to be here.” Dean’s head swivels to the right and left as he observes the farm. He takes in the half-dozen planters lining the path to the house and notices a few bees zipping amongst the late-blooming flowers. “The bees must love your little garden.”
“I heard something about puffy love couches, but I don’t even want to
Castiel nods and opens the fridge, shoving containers of leftovers and other snacks aside to make room. After Dean slides the box inside, Castiel takes a peek at the design. Unsurprisingly, Dean has gone above and beyond. The cake is frosted in chocolate, with cookie pieces sprinkled on top to resemble a road. A foodsafe toy car sits at one end of the road, posed as if running from the dinosaurs chasing close behind. He wouldn’t be admitting it to Gabriel anytime soon, but Castiel thinks it’s pretty obvious who Dean made the cake for, and it isn’t a child he’s just met. The implication of that thought sends a thrill sparking through Castiel’s bones. He shivers as he closes the refrigerator, using it as a convenient excuse for the goosebumps pebbling both arms.
Standing at the wall where Castiel had been taken, Dean finished painting an intricate symbol and turned away. With a pang of nervousness coiled in his gut, he moved to watch as Sam added their hard-earned ingredients to a bowl and ground them together with a pestle. They had one shot at this and there were no guarantees that the spell would work. Everything had to be perfect.
A truck with a picture of a large cheeseburger wearing a cowboy hat draws Dean’s attention and his stomach gurgles. Seeing as how he’s early, he figures it can’t hurt to grab a bite to eat. Over the loudspeakers, a voice encourages everyone to pick up a cold drink before the show and Dean eyes a mobile bar counter set up beside the burger truck.
“That sentiment really is quite profound, Dean,” Castiel asserts then. “No matter where Sam is, I’m willing to bet he thinks of you when he sees those patterns in the sky. That’s not a connection easily severed.”
to a level of sincerity that is probably
A couple moments later, he hears a thump from the bedroom and then a very long, low groan. Then Charlie is crawling into the living room with Dean’s comforter bundled around her. She collapses on the carpet and glares up at him from the opening in her cocoon.
Every time he considered just sending a text or stopping by after office hours, he always managed to talk himself out of it. Like the day when, a few weeks after Dean started, Cas walked by his office and witnessed him comforting a crying Claire Collins, a student he’d had in one of his own classes the year before. Dean’s tone had been so
” he practically screams, ignoring the twinge it causes in his head in favor of the rising panic he feels in his throat. At least it’s not vomit. “Red, get your ass in here right now!”
How Dean and Cas walked around on eggshells around each other wasn’t word for word history repeating, but it was beginning to rhyme.  His brother would offer to do various tasks well within Cas’s power just to be in his company.  Even with his miniscule amount of Grace, his friend would offer to do too much, just to have something else to focus on.  The living room and den couches hardly got a break with how common mid-afternoon naps had become.  Dean’s pining wasn’t hampered by emotional constipation this time around, but he was less likely to ask his brother for a hand.  Mirroring their history though, Sam couldn’t fight the urge to poke his nose in the beehive.  He knocked on Dean’s doorframe and waved his arms to get his attention.
“Why would you get nervous during the…” Sam sorted out the steps of the rite in his head and clarity sprawled across his face, “Oh.”
A smile brighter than any he had seen before lit up his face.  He buried his gaze down into his knees and nodded with all the uncontainable joy of a wily teenager.
He puffed out his chest proud that he could still impress Cas with the breathe of his arcane knowledge.  “Men of Letters left more books than an anything else in the bunker.  Damn near a book on everything.  Don’t remember seeing one quite like this though.  What’cha warding against?  Reapers? Leviathan? Or just your garden variety demon?”
For the second time his attention wavered in favor of sneaking peeks at Dean’s exposed skin.
He turned tail to more clearly hear Dean clomp down the stairs in his direction.  “What’s up?”
Light jazz snuck between beats of moderate chatter in the scantly lit bar.  Wooden panels painted like Damascus wood lined the walls and amber pool hall lighting made the facial features of the smatterings of people around the place challenging to discern.  It was a weeknight after all, so a packed bar would have been unexpected.  He glared at the clock on his phone then searched for a message from Mick.  The clock struck seven but he had no messages, so his paramour was obviously still at the office.
“What’cha got there?”  He heaved her up onto his hip.  She wrapped her legs around his middle, all the while squeezing the sea creature with all her might.  She leaned backwards to Charlie with shining reverence.  Who was this person who could make fantastical creatures appear from thin air?
“He’s affecting you.  You’ve gotten very close to him very fast.  Please tell me you see it, too.”
“I figured you would remember when I said that the last time.  When all was said and done, I met you for a couple of beers here about nine.”  Once Sam’s meandering search ended in spotting Castiel leaning against the kitchen counter, his face settled into a put upon frown.  “What about bringing James here seemed like a good idea?”
His effort to subdue his concern fell flat as it still gathered on his knitted brow.  “Once you were out of the hospital, did it just take that long to gather enough mojo to come back?”
“It sounds like you were a great older brother,” he said pulling onto the gravel lot at the backside of the brewery.  “It’s our job to keep them safe and healthy, not color coordinated.”
He squinted into the open sky, shaking at the tether to gauge its orientation.  Locating him felt like trying to find a keyhole in the dark.  There was no way to know what reckless use of his Grace in this world could do now, so he concentrated on terminus of the tether above all else.  No light, no sound, no warmth, no other being than this Dean.  An overture passed and still he was no closer, fumbling in that abyss.  Red splashes of immediate danger spilled down the link only to dry up again, but it served as an echo location for that minute, letting him feel the edges of the keyhole as he fumbled.  Once more, the slough of peril spiraled right at him and the key clicked into place.  Joyous relief overcame him as it turned clockwise.  His core echoed with the resolve.  Saving Dean was all that mattered.
“Guys,” the voice that reverberates from the man behind her is deeply smooth, much like...
” Castiel growls at the witch. “You touch even a hair and I’ll - I’ll aaaaaaughh!!”
The voice of a different man asks, “How much longer?”
Castiel is in her fifth month of pregnancy when she walks into the clinic for an ultrasound. She can't help but fidget as the doctor asks her intruding questions about her partner: Who the father is? Where he is? He asks about her eating habits and how she sleeps at night, scolding her when the answers seem less than satisfying to him. As Dean has said before, all you truly need is a good four hours every night. And no matter what anyone says, there is nothing wrong with living off of peanut butter pickles and root beer cherry slushies. What the doctor doesn't understand is that she's an angel who does not function by human logistics. What she eats and how long she sleeps don’t normally matter. The instances are different here, Castiel can allow the doctor to give her a few more helpful articles and prescribe her a sleep aid under the name Jacklyn Novak. She supposes she may need a few extra doses for it to kick in but she greatly accepts them.
Castiel finds herself spending more time exchanging her mythology fiction for books on child care and expecting a baby. She’s content to do research on the internet, searching for tips and tricks that may come in handy during her pregnancy. One day, Castiel stumbled upon a website called
Castiel's eyes glisten with tears, her arms falling limp at her side. Dean turns his back on her almost like what they had done together did not happen. That sex with her was meaningless. To the angel it wasn't. It was all Castiel's being, all her trust. She showed him vulnerability. A side to her no one had ever seen before, shedding away the cloak of her human vessel. Castiel gave herself to Dean.
Stepping tentatively on the tile floor, Dean ventures closer. “Cas..?”
“No… NO!” Castiel yells, fighting against the person holding her back. “NO! Let him go! No! Don’t!”
“Mhm…” Castiel shakes her head. She curls in on Dean, resting her hand above her heart.
Castiel twists her head, staring into Dean's eyes. Her Dean, not a figment of her imagination nor was he a creature Rowena had welcomed into the cabin that should have been secluded.
