"I would have thought that as His partner, you would have made me official too Mycroft. Sally Donovan seems to think I am completely incompetent by myself, and is unsure I am up to the task."
"You say just a suicide John, but as always, you never, never observe! Wheres the note?? Theres always a suicide note!"
"Vomit on bathroom floor, with water. And a blood clot in the toilet with evidence of a bleeding nose as well..."
Sherlock woke to his violin gone, presumably back in its case on his desk, a still steaming cup of tea on his bed side table, and a rustling of papers. He shot up and stared at John who sat beside him, reading Ashley's file, a frown etched on his brow as he read, which disappeared when he saw Sherlock was awake, straightening the ruffled curls and handing over the file.
The rest in the bag was mundane, books she was reading, and snack rubbish. Ignoring the other bodies, which was clearly collateral, donning a protective overall, just in case, he peered into the pod, reeling back and gagging at the sight and smell of all the blood. Ordinarily he prided himself on an iron stomach, but this was different, he accepted a mask and peered back in, he focused on her face first, and noticed something, off about her mouth, he held his hand out and asked for a pair of tweezers, using them to pull something out of her mouth. Pulling it out and coming out to look at it in the light, he smiled, finally, a worthy lead.
"Sherlock... its Molly. She said the last victim, Ashley was raped, likely before she died. She found traces of tearing, and a used condom, with no DNA found, but she is looking."
The ex-soldier nodded, shoulders tense, and stumbled down the stairs, yawning, making the tea as the two sat down and stared at each other. John clearly fighting sleep and darting his eyes back up to the room, before his eyes drifted shut again. Mycroft took the opportunity to truly look at him,
"I'm fine, just coming down with something I think, I might just go home now, I may not make it in tomorrow."
John clenched his fist at his side, shooting a glare towards Donovan as he walked past her, before running into Sherlock's tense back, with a grumble he moved to beside him and looked at the scene before him, a gasp escaping his mouth. Before them lay a woman, still so young, her blond hair splayed out behind her head, a pool of blood lay below her, evident by large slashes down her arms that still oozed blood at a slower wait. When Sherlock didn't immediately start examining the body like he normally does, John glanced at him, alarmed to see the normally unemotional Sherlock Holmes, the one who refuted emotions claiming they were illogical, completely shut down, looking like a statue, with his eyes flicking over the body.
Before Mycroft could reply John flinched in his sleep, crying out in pain, and clutching Sherlock tightly, whimpering, everyones eyes drawn to him, until with a final twitch he settled again into Sherlock's embrace. Mycroft took the opportunity to sit down and tell Sherlock, and by extension Greg, exactly everything he had found at the crime scene, Greg watching in amusement as the two brothers bounced ideas off each other, curling up and hugging his partners arm.
"Well we are definitely looking at a serial killer. Judging by the amount of blood that keeps growing, someone who has an obsession with blood, a hemophiliac to give it the proper terminology. He will keep killing and cutting and slicing until he is caught. There will be a note somewhere, just like last time, as he does want each kill to seem like a suicide. And just like last time there will be evidence of rape on her. The amount of psychiatric medications are likely how he targets them, there is a common denominator there, he is a middle man somewhere in the process. The fact that he picks self-harmers is on purpose. It helps with the illusion it is a suicide, rather than a murder, and they are also more vulnerable than any other possible victims. Anything else? Or may I leave?"
John took the lead, spinning a lie of him being his half brother, unaware of Anthea pulling Sherlock to the side. Alone, John entered the room, stopping at the sight of Greg, lying in bed, a fresh bandage wrapped around his arm, and a blood transfusion happening in the other. Colour slowly returning to his face, John turned to the doctor as he started to explain that it was very lucky Mycroft found Gregory when he did, and even luckier the ambulance got there so fast, any longer and it was likely he wouldn't be here. He also explained because the nature of the wound was self inflicted, they were going to hold him on a 72 hour psychiatric hold when he woke up, as they still believed him to be a danger to himself. With a nod of understanding, the doctor left, and John sat beside the bed, hand only resting on Gregs unbandaged arm, sighing.
and if they did, they don't interfere. It disgusted him. Society's reaction, or lack thereof sickened him. So, he took matters into his own hands.
"Nope. I'm not telling you anything. Mycroft's orders, I'd rather not know how Mycroft would punish me if he knew I told you. He's too protective of his loved ones." John had paled at the questions, before regaining himself, playfully nudging Greg with his shoulder and holding the door open as they left, in pursuit of a nearby cafe.
She opened her mouth once more, for what reason was anyone's guess, regardless, John didn't give her the chance to get a syllable out, to the joy of the few officers watching, and John's Driver who was discretely filming the entire thing, under order of one Mycroft Holmes, who had used his power to get eyes within the station.
A sharp look answered him, and he shrank down. Together they arrived at A&E and left the car, which parked in a spot reserved for the most esteemed guests. They sat in the waiting room while Anthea got them the necessary room number, just in time for, "Family of Gregory Lestrade?"
Mycroft entered his house, sighing as he did so, he'd just dropped off Gregory and Doctor Watson at home and then finally gathered the groceries he had wanted to hours before hand. He stripped off his clothes and put them into his washing machine along with his similar suits and turned them on, then headed to the shower to wash the tension off his shoulders, turning it on as hot as he can handle and sighing at the pressure. His hands ran over his scars inflicted by his sister, the gnawing hole where the rats had eaten through to his organs, the plus shaped incision where she opened his chest, he could still remember her words, "
"You are staring brother mine. I was under the impression you found my body, its shape, revolting. You certainly reminded me many times over the years how big I am."
Mycroft inwardly smiled at the reaction of his and his brothers name, and with a few base tests, he carried Sherlock down to the waiting stretcher, just in time for another coughing fit to occur, and a wheeze was heard when it was over, a frown adorned his face as he watched them slide a oxygen mask over his face, and he was given an iv with saline to start. Before he could enter the ambulance with them, Anthea stopped him and handed over one of his anxiety medications with a bottle of water and a frown that said he wouldn't get out of it, with a resigned sigh, he took it, and rode to the hospital, leaving Anthea and the car behind.
Before he could continue, the leader spoke up, "I'm sorry Will, i should have said, we don't go into graphic detail in here, we're all recovering in some way, and detail could cause relapses."
"Okay dear Brother, I can do that for you. Okay, lets see, oh, I know where to start, that Nurse who fetched me that water, this is only the second time of her ever dealing with us, she's young still, and almost as naive as Molly was when she first saw me. Easily scared though, so of course she must be very silent and submissive to all around her, she likely gets the worst jobs here, something she is used to despite her short time on Earth... "
She checks in order from most to least, just in order to possibly alleviate any worries they may have for her.
A sick feeling rolled through him, halted only by his thick iceman mask. He gave it to Anderson with strict instructions to give it to him after it had been catalogued, and he made a mental note to freshen up his handwriting analysis.
Greg sat on the couch while he waited, before getting back up and cleaning some of the mess, needing to do something, only looking up when John wandered back in with a strange look on his face, a mix of worry, suppressed rage and confusion.
The further they got from the cafe and crowds, the more Greg loosened back up, though he kept looking around everywhere, as if expecting something to happen, or someone to pop up. They kept walking until John found a nice secluded place for them to sit down and have their coffee and eat their pastries, John groaned and muttered under his breath when he spotted the car again.
When Sherlock dove back to the present with more ideas on the killer, he smiled at the sight of John, carrying him up to his own bed, he gulped the water down and got more, grimacing at the sight of the cake, reminding himself to teasingly probe Mycroft later. He heard a cry of fear travel down from Johns room and deduced he was having a nightmare, so he grabbed his violin and played a calming tune, knowing it would carry up to him, when he settled Sherlock returned to his latest experiment, going to his own room for privacy, he pulled out the notebook, the blade and first aid kit.
"I'm fine Molly, you know how it is looking after Sherlock, and this new case isn't exactly easy, you don't need to worry."
Breakfast, or the pathetic attempt at it, was cleared up not long after, leftovers put in the fridge for later. Gregory was set up in the Library, which had a tv wheeled into it, with a pile of dvds, and a pile of boos that Mycroft put beside Gregs favourite chair, he tucked him in with his comfort blanket and a jug of juice on the table next to him, kissing his forehead softly and gently caressing his cheek, as if afraid he may shatter, frown turning to concern as he glanced towards where the bandage was hidden.
"Not if the person killing themselves feels they truly are alone and that no one would notice or care they are gone," John spoke up quietly, and in the silence that followed, Sherlock remembered one of the deductions he had first made about his roommate when they first met.
"Sherlock Holmes, tolerable? Now that I have to see, but yes, decent coffee sounds heavenly, maybe after we visit your sick Holmes, we could go back and taste some of my Holmes art." His smile grows a bit, a spark appearing in his eye and his whole demeanour changed slightly. "Now, tell me about the case. Any new developments? Has the-"
"Where'd you disappear to? We need to get you back to bed, before the nurses notice and get huffy. Just, behave, alright?"
With a frown, Mycroft pocketed the phone, and started remaking the bed, pulling back the covers to flatten out the bottom sheet, stopping in his tracks. Where Gregory usually lies, was a large stain of still wet blood, the size of which surprised him. He froze before bolting to the library, hitting a silent alarm button that would send an ambulance directly to his residence no questions asked.
When he arrived at the flat and let himself in, he wasn't entirely surprised to see Sherlocks bed empty, and instead made his way up to Johns room, knocking, just in case before entering. On the bed was his Gregory, fast asleep, looking peaceful and relaxed. Satisfied, his gaze switched to Doctor Watson, at least 5 caffeine patches on his bare arm, which clearly wasn't enough, as he was fitfully sleeping, a deep frown etched in his face, as Mycroft watched, John started twitching and muttering in his sleep, before he got too loud, he strode over and placed a hand on the distressed mans shoulder, jolting him awake with a gasp.
"Sherlock, do shut up. I simply felt the desire to do such a thing and thought I would bring you one. Though I did have a suspicion you knew her, your behaviour has confirmed it for me. Are you any closer to discovering her killer?"
He stares in awe at the nose, before shaking his head to clear it, "No, I haven't, but I can tell cause of death, and I do recognise wounds.
"I took the liberty of looking up the girl of your latest case as i knew neither of us would sleep when you returned. Her name is Ashley Ryader, her father was never in the picture, and her mother and her younger brother died in a car crash when she was 6. From then she lived with her grandparents, she has a history of sexual abuse, a close family friend took child pornagraphic images of her, when she was 8, he was arrested on charges of multiple child pornagraphic charges. When she developed breasts, her grandfather would grope her breasts from behind when she sat on his lap, later on, at the age of 16 he indecently exposed himself to her, telling her 'this is a mans penis.' She ran away not long after that, finding her way to London and living on the streets, she was admitted to A&E on multiple occasions, most were for various attempts, and others were for alcohol poisoning. After many months she cleaned up, found a flat and was studying Psychology, she was raped just a few months ago in an alley after a late study session. I do believe for a while she may have been a part of my dear brother's Homeless network, but I am unsure of that."
One must observe and see of course. They show no hesitation whatsoever, and look at the depth of the cuts between the ulnar and radius, no one could do that to themselves, no matter what state they were in. Some innate instinct would stop them.
Sherlock looked up suddenly, jolting back to the present as he hears a soft coo coming from Rosie's playpen, and in a daze he stumbled over to it, reading a note that John had left pinned to it: '
Eventually Greg calmed and stood upright, pulling out a pack of tissues and blowing his nose and offering a watery smile.
With a fire burning in his eyes, John got up and stormed down the stairs, Greg quickly stood and followed after him, getting in the car first, and flinching when John slammed the door, telling Mycroft's driver in a clipped tone to drive to the hospital. Greg slid to the furthermost from John, hunching in on himself, breathing shallowly as he fights the flashbacks,
She stared blankly at him, blinking, before weakly pulling herself together. "I, I'm too close to this victim. I, I knew her, spoke, texted her only hours before hand." She held out the phone on the screen of texts, which he took and read over, as she seemed to snap more out of it, "I'm sorry, who are you? I haven't seen you before I don't think..."
First taking notes of his current mood before hand, going so far as to describe the case that provoked the experiment. When he made the initial notes, he disinfected the arm and made new slices, larger than yesterdays one, with varying degrees of depth, he was finishing a fourth when the screams indicating Rosie was up sounded, and his hand jerked in surprise, cursing he cleaned up fast, running into the living room to look after Rosie, as it was his night to watch her, after determining she was fine, he played the violin for her, smiling softly for the first time in a while when she fell back asleep, before he escaped back to his experiment, writing the findings afterwards, including noting how it calmed down his mind so he could process better.
Having enough of watching his friend torture himself, Greg strode forward and pounced, pinning down his distressed friend. He instantly regretted it. John went haywire. His military training kicked in and he bucked Gregory off, reaching for his gun, blinking awake as he did, freezing and looking around his surroundings, confused, and panicked.
When he was alone he rubbed at his burning scars, lighting up a cigarette that didn't last long at all to soothe his shot nerves, feeling the tension ebb out of him, putting the butt out on his arm, next to a collection of similar scars, he drove home. Arriving he got out and sat on the porch, not yet wanting to go inside, despite seeing the light on in his kitchen, instead shakily lighting his second cigarette, savouring this one more, ripping off the nicotine patch he had on, and stubbing out the butt on his arm again, carefully rolling down his sleeve and heading in, towards the kitchen.
"Alright, cause of death was a mix of blood loss, and of an overdose-" a muffled curse coming from Sherlock caused John to glance up, with a wave of his hand, he continued, "an overdose, likely a mix of painkillers and her antidepressants. She had a history of self harm, which is evident on the scars below the main cut, I'd say this is just a suicide."
"Hi, Will was it? I'm Aria, not sure if you remember? I've been coming to this group for a few years now, and I like to help newbies like you, I couldn't help but notice earlier, you're bandages are bleeding through, is it okay if I just, help replace them? maybe clean and look at the cuts?"
Instead of answering, Mycroft simply sighed and finished a slice of cake, and immediately grabbed another, ignoring the raised eyebrow from his brother, returning one of his own when Sherlock put down half of the cake and drew his knees up to his chest, grabbing the files and flicking through them again, finally looking at the crime scene photos Lestrade sent him. A small frown creased his brow, and he took the offered lit cigarette as he inspected it, something didn't feel right to him, but he wasn't sure what it was. Something clicked and he muttered something about needing to see the body, putting on his coat and scarf and leapt down the stairs, bounding into his brothers car, calling up to the flat, "Come on Mycroft!" The smallest of smiles ordained Mycroft's face as with practiced manners he pulled on his own coat and grabbed his umbrella, getting in the care and telling his driver to take them to St Barts hospital.
The silver haired man sits back and pants, catching his breath as it keeps hitching, watching Sherlock take everything in and slide his hand under John's shirt and sweater, telling exactly when he feels each scar, giving a small smile as he encloses the smaller man in his arms. Bowing his head in apology and placing a gentle kiss on his relaxed form.
Sherlock escaped into his mind palace, drawing on the memory of Ashley, and looking her over as he'd last seen her, looking over everything, until,
Mycroft watches as his brothers eyes slide over him finally, first stopping on where his scars are, inclining his head in a small nod of confirmation.
Finally he sat beside him and kept an eye on him, replacing cigarettes as needed, taking each butt and stubbing it out in the ash tray, wincing as he missed one and watching as his boyfriend made a new mark on his arm. When he finally came out of it, he crumpled into Myc's waiting arms, allowing him to feed each pill to him with whiskey, before Myc carried him up to bed, waiting as the sleeping pill kicked in, before staying up to protect him from any nightmares.
She padded out to the bathrooms, and upon her return rubbed her eyes, looking at the other pods briefly, seeing nothing out of the ordinary, before entering hers again. Repacking her bag with read books, she put it at her feet, near the blind and checked her phone again, smiling at the reassuring texts from her friends. She'd just started drifting off when she saw her curtain twitch open, and saw an unfamiliar figure that set her whole body on edge, firing every alarm at once, hastily, she grabbed her phone and sent a single message.
Well of course they were still begging for help, just a lot more desperately, after all, no matter what people say they don't really want to die, we all deep down want someone to save us.
At 221b Baker Street, John yelled at Sherlock for once again leaving him behind at a crime scene without warning, without waiting for him, until he yawned too many times, and went up to his own room, warning the detective to sleep in his own bed tonight, greatful that Mrs Hudson was looking after Rosie.
He prowled the aisles of the pharmacy, casually glancing at exposed forearms, staring at covered ones, as he eavesdropped on conversations at the counter, carefully putting up a pretence of being nervous and playing with his sleeves as he placed down gauze, plasters, tape and antiseptic on the counter, knowing to anyone normal it'll seem like a normal purchase, but to his, choice, it'd resonate with them. Getting no bites, he took his leave with his purchase.
Messages checked and read, she smiled, seeing her friends worried, helped elevate her own worry, except maybe Amy. Maybe when this was all over she'd treat Mark, Don and Sally to a nice meal as a thank you. She settled with a new book and read for hours, until she fell asleep, head resting on the book, the empty bottle of vodka beside her with the empty packets of chocolate surrounding her. A few times she stirred at a few odd noises, giggling, some music, a few thuds and scraping sounds, until she woke a few hours later, the toilet beckoning once more.
Swooping on the body, Sherlock quickly his investigation, pulling out his magnifying glass, and running through his findings.
He looked around the room, satisfied for the looks of discomfort, and the looks of longing. He could tell from a look which of them were longer into their recovery, and from that, he started scoping out his next victim. With a nod of apology, he remained silent, listening to everyone elses stories.
A week later found Gregory in his first appointment with a new psychiatrist, while Mycroft waited for him at home, baking up a storm, making full use of their 4 separate ovens. Each was a different flavour. He had a zesty lemon flavoured one in an oval tin with a few minutes remaining, an apple and cinnamon cooling on a rack, a chocolate and orange cake just put in and was finishing mixing up a berry cake with a mix of various berries. After pouring in the mix into a new tin and popping it into the oven, he gave the bowl a test lick with his finger, before putting the mixing bowls into the sink and running water over them, before putting the majority of the ingredients away except for those that'd be used as decoration, checking his pantry to see he had everything, despite knowing some of his supplies were low, and he made a mental list as he washed the bowls and dried them, just as he was finishing up his phone went off, alerting him to a new text.
She got handed paper, and with a shaky hand she wrote a small message on the paper, adding what he told her to at the end, and he took it, pulling out finally and placing the note just outside. Before crawling back over her, from the light in the pod, she saw the sadistic smile that adorned his face. Leaning over her face so he could see the reaction, he grabbed his knife once more, and sliced down her arms deeply, enjoying the scream that tore from her, before letting out a yell of her own, as in the split moment he closed his eyes, she bit a chunk off his nose and held it in her mouth. In a fit of rage he pinned her arms to the bed with two knifes and shoved his usual one up her freshly raped hole, watching the pain in her eyes, as the energy to scream had left her. His knife danced along her torso, between her ribs, and punctured her breasts, before slicing her organs to shreds.
With a final glance, he dictated his findings to an available officer, removed the outer wear, and left the scene, heading to Baker Street to inform John on the updated case. Hoping he was in a better mood after some sleep.
The figure crawled over her and grabbed the phone, tossing it and the bag out into the room, before quickly removing her clothes with a knife, with gentle precision, tossing the ruined garments out as well, pinning down her shoulders hard enough to leave a bruise, he, for she was sure it was male by now, forced open her legs and with one thrust entered her. Her scream echoed around the pod, which, to her shock caused her assailant to let out a moan of pleasure, his thrusting became more animalistic and rough and she could feel bruises forming, with a final grunt, he finished into the condom he wore. Holding a knife to her throat, in a calm voice, he spoke.
They arrived at the Hospital, and Gregory was immediately rushed to a bed in resus. It took a great deal of effort for Mycroft to stand and follow them, ignoring the darkness creeping into his vision, still too shocked to breathe. He stood on the top step of the Ambulance, and swayed, once, twice, and on the third sway fell onto the cruel concrete below, giving into the darkness and thankfully passing out.
"John!" A hand reaches out and grabs John's arm, and he jolts awake, bolting upright, and looking over the room, with the empty bed, panicked filled eyes meeting Molly's, asking a silent question.
He stands up, looking a bit unsteady as he does so, Molly takes a step forth to steady him, but a look from him and she stops, blinking a few times, he runs his hand through his hair and walks towards her, yawning and taking the coffee she offered. Together the two walked towards the morgue, worry radiating off John as they did.
"Oh John, I thought I heard you. Sherlock was taken to hospital, in an ambulance, I saw his brother carry him onto the stretcher..."
he bunched his hoodie up in his hands as his chest felt tighter and the panic rose in torrential waves. He was aware he was hyperventilating now, and he looked at what he realised was John's face, who looked guilty rather than angry, and through a buzz he could vaguely hear what he was saying.
Mycroft entered the room, in his hands a coffee cake decorated in icing. His umbrella swinging, as the two stared at each other, the tension rising between them. With a sigh, John strode forth and took the cake, carrying it into the kitchen and shutting the door, grumbling at the mess littering the table as he puts the kettle on.
"Indeed. Oh, how is, Lestrade? I noticed you have his brand of cigarettes again, I also see it is a new box, and yet several are already missing, did he have a bad night?"
Meanwhile, the two brothers sit opposite each other in silence, each looking over them, finally Sherlock pulled out his bottle of whiskey and two glasses while Mycroft at the same time pulled out a packet of cigarettes, offering one to Sherlock, who noticed the amount in the packet and the brand, which wasn't his brothers usual brand, the got lit and the two inhaled deeply. As he exhaled, Mycroft looked around the room, eyes focusing on the file and violin, before taking another look over his younger brother, keeping a guarded mask up. Before either of them could start speaking, John walked in, carrying a tray with two cups, a kettle full of tea, a sugar bowl and milk, as well as a couple of slices of cake on a plate, he set it down on the table between the two, sighing and holding the ash tray under both of their cigarettes just before ash fell onto the table, and placing it down.
With effort he made it down to the bathroom, shivering as the fever alternated between sending waves of heat and chills across his body, by the time he'd shut the bathroom door he'd worked up a whole new layer of sweat. He started filling the bathtub with cool water, and while he waited, he took his temperature, automatically writing it down on the notebook he kept in the bathroom, peeling off his boxers, grabbing a fresh flannel and sliding into the now full bathtub, turning off the tap and sighing at the coolness. Removing the bandage he slid the healing scabs into the water and gently washed them off, smiling in satisfaction as no bleeding occurred. Wetting the flannel he places it on his face, letting out a sigh of relief as he soaks in the water.
Greg merely chuckled, and finished off his own coffee and pastry, tossing the rubbish into the bin before curling up on the bench and cuddling into John again, putting his hood up and sighing as he inhaled John's calming scent.
John shuddered and fought his restraints at the sound of her detached voice. She traced her knife along the lines where autopsy incisions are made, making them almost as deep, if not as deep, John wasn't sure, he was too busy biting his lip, struggling not to scream, she watched the blood bead up with a hint of interest, and cut extra, before peeling one half back. John couldn't hold back, he screamed loudly, enough for Sherlock to somehow hear him.
"I was? I don't remember it, thank god for that, huh? Why were you up though, and dont try tell me you weren't, you forget who I live with."
"Sergeant Donovan. I have no need for official status as a detective to prove that I am intelligent. Last I checked, the fact that I am a doctor who served as Captain of 5th Northumberland in Afghanistan, and the partner of Sherlock Holmes, and as I know how to learn and not just belittle people who I do not understand by calling them 'Freak,' I do believe that makes me more than qualified to look upon this scene and make deductions to assess what happened at this scene."
"Look, how about this, just until you feel better, you stay with me, sound good? I'm clean, nothing too dangerous, I can keep an eye on you, and I can help change you're bandages, not to mention, you can talk to me if you feel the urge."
Molly shook her head, while Sherlock stood there, transfixed, staring at his John. Eyes sparkling as he stares at him, mouth dropped open, shaking his head slowly. Striding across the room, he hugged John as hard as he could, whispering in his ear, "Brilliant, fantastic." Sending shivers down his spine, backing away.
John sighed, standing and offering a hand to help Greg up, he looked drained, and colourless, "Sure, better than being alone at Baker place, can we visit Sherlock for now though?"
"All available units to St Christopher's Inn. I repeat all available units to St Christopher's Inn!"
a hand came down on on his shoulder and he flinched jumping hard. His breath came faster, as his eyes widened
Standing out of the way of the forensic photographer, he checked the locker mentioned, pulling out the bag and pulled out the contents, including the phone, which he scrolled through, before tossing it to Anderson, who only had a job again because of him. It was bagged with a scowl, which was ignored, as he pulled out the shredded clothes, putting them also into a bag after examining the cut marks, a note in the bag caused him to pause.
"You're on. He won't do that, he knows that you're my best mate, Sherlock doesn't count, he's a pain in my ass sometimes, no offence."
"My apologies, regardless, she was making progress, she was on a new prescription, she was seeing a therapist, she was getting better, someone getting better wouldn't commit, wouldn't do this, Gerome, I know there is more to this case."
He leaned forward onto her, exhausted and boneless. Grunting in surprise, she held him as he unexpectedly starts crying on her shoulder, she spotted Greg's face in the glass of the door to the morgue, and she realised he must have had the nurses sedate Sherlock, as she sent him a silent '
"Johnnnnn, I am quite capable of looking after myselfffff." Sherlock whined, fighting to sit up with a groan, holding his now throbbing head, not protesting when John pushed him back down.
The door burst open, with Sherlock clutching his IV stand, his oxygen mask hanging around his neck, Lestrade following close after him. "It may be slim, but its still something, what have you two got for me?"
John waited, rather impatiently in the aptly named waiting room at Greg's therapist's office, his leg bouncing with a mind of its own, bored out of his mind as he got a taste of the boredom Sherlock must feel daily. Just for something to do, he re-watches the video of Captain Watson scolding, or rather, lecturing Sally Donovan, fascinated by how in charge he feels, a grin breaking out as he hears the echoes of Mycroft's chuckle when he showed the footage. His head shot up when footsteps sounded softly on the carpet, and he offered a small smile to Greg, who hunched his way into the room, looking much smaller than he usually did, in a hoodie 3 times too big for him and sweatpants, his face showing just how shattered he was as he shuffled his way over to John, who actually felt taller than him for once. John didn't even have a chance to offer a greeting when Greg leaned into his chest, shoulders shaking from pent-up emotion, and as he hugged him, John realised just how much this case had shaken the inspector, and they stood in silence for a few minutes, the shorter man simply offering comfort.
"Yes Myc. Thank you for your consideration, and for your tender care, I'm sorry for putting you through this. I love you my little Olaf." Greg summoned up a cheeky grin, glad he had forced the elder Holmes to watch Frozen with him, he had giggled, feeling the snowman related to his boyfriend.
"None taken, he's a pain in my ass too." John paused, before giggling at the double meaning, giggling more at Greg's look of horror and disgust. "Speaking of, how about I introduce you to sick Sherlock?"
"You have before, on one separate occasion. I am Mycroft Holmes," he paused at the flicker of registration, and saw her start to whisper 'freak', "Yes, brother of Sherlock, and partner to your boss, neither of which is your concern, however, I am here on behalf of both of them, as well as Doctor Watson who has more pressing matters. Don't worry, I shall see myself in."
"Relax John. The inspector will pull through this, though, I do wonder if it is linked with this case? Maybe he's on the same sort of medications as them, do you think he'd let me ask him?"
An eyebrow raised while he waited for John to continue, five minutes passed before he realised the doctor needed prompting.
Lestrade awaited for him when he got out of the taxi, John beside him, after warning the two this one was worse, he lead them up, past Anderson and Donovan who couldn't resist a "Hi Freak!" When they reached the room, they received another warning, and entered, followed soon after by Anderson and Donovan. This time, the victim was male, shakily written on one of the white walls was 'I can't take this anymore' in blood, it was clearly written by their victim, as his fingers were covered, and a hand print matched his hand. Like Ashley, his wrists were sliced, this time multiple times, and like her, they were sliced all the way through, in addition, his head had been shot, judging by the spray it was shot from a .45 caliber, the same one that was dropped in a pool of the blood. With care, Sherlock got closer to examine the spray, noting the span of it, before spotting the bullet lodged in the wall opposite the note. It seemed staged, Sherlocks phone alerted him to a text, and he handed it to John to read as he carefully pulled out the bullet out of the wall, and dropped it into a evidence bag that Anderson hesitantly held out, before going into the hole and pulling out a rolled up wrapper, unraveling it at the same time John spoke up.
"Oh are you 'fine' John? Because I believe I just woke you from the starts of a nightmare. But, I am here because a new victim has been found."
Together the two walked into the Hospital and straight to the room that was always booked for the Holmes brothers, Gregory entering first, neither of them showing surprise at Mycroft or Anthea, Greg headed straight for the unconscious Sherlock, focused on him. John meanwhile stalked toward the Elder Holmes and grabbed him by the jacket, dragging him out into the waiting room and down to an empty corridor, where he shoved him away, giving the man just enough time to adjust his suit before he started.
John cast his eye over the man, who seemed to have shrunk since witnessing John's flashback, and hefted a heavy sigh.
"Yes, he had a nightmare, I can tell that's where you're heading. He woke me with anguished screams, begging someone to stop, he called your name, and Sherlock's, and begged Mary to stop too. I tried waking him not long after, he fought, then came to, he denied remembering the nightmare, and then offered to stay up, I was too tired to try argue."
John frowned at Anthea, or whatever she called herself currently, "So, what you're telling me is, Greg is possibly bleeding to death from a maybe self inflicted wound, but exact specifics can not be told, only that he is on his way to St Barts and would I like to go see him?" He folded his arms in front of him in disbelief, before a sigh escaped him and he nodded.
"No, and I am not currently at liberty to say why Doctor Wilson, as it is quite frankly none of your business, just look after him."
When they got there, she offered gloves, which he took, and with a nod of readiness, she took off the sheet, watching him stumble back at the viciousness of the wounds. Giving him time to breath, she pulled him over to what she'd been testing since she got it.
With a small nod, John got as close as he could examining the body as close as he could, without touching the blood, standing once he was finished.
There was something about John that changed when he threw around his reminder that he was once Captain of 5th Northumberland. He grew taller and more confident, and according to Sherlock in private, the orders he threw around were 'breathtaking', the very air around him changed, commanding respect.
"Watson, its Donovan here, we just got a new body, the killer if you are sure its that struck again, I've sent an officer to pick you and the freak up to see the new body."
Anthea showed Mycroft the list of Sherlock's temperature and symptoms throughout the days and he briefly bit his lip, before remembering he was Mycroft Holmes, and he doesn't worry, much, unless it was his brother, his younger brother, who was currently coughing on his lap, and had almost drowned in the bath if he hadn't gotten there in time. His brother, whose temperature was starting to reach needing doctor levels, and, was apparently falling back to some old habits... who was only sick because Mycroft couldn't even keep a proper eye on his partner, his baby brother, who couldn't keep down soup, or medicine, his younger brother who looked after him last week.
Lestrade nodded with a sigh, running his hands through his ever graying hair, he looked like he had aged 20 years since they entered, ready to close the case, until Sherlock jumped in.
"He left about 5 minutes ago, he tried speaking to you but you seemed too deep in thought. Are you okay? I've never seen you be so, gentle with a corpse before."
"You don't need to thank me for either of those Mycroft, I'd do both again in a heartbeat. As for Greg, all he needs is comfort, and reassurance you are there for him, hugs and all. However, that won't happen if you don't take care of yourself. So, for tonight Greg will stay with me at Baker street, and you look after yourself, okay? Doctor's orders. Have Anthea on stand by if necessary, or your other staff, and just, don't fight too hard on any flashbacks or panic attacks, that won't help either of you if you are carrying so much stress it leaks into your relationship."
"He took a lot of the injuries, every time it looked like she was going to kill me, he called her back to him. I, I own my life to him Greg."
The Holmes' they'd be the death of John, he swears. He knew Mycroft would not respond but would do as requested, if for no other reason than to check to see if Sherlock was truly sick. Speaking of, he sent a photo of him to Greg, in hopes of getting a laugh from his friend, he'd just sent it when a reply came through that got him scowling again.
With an hour till the meeting, or at least till he should move there, he sat at a local popular cafe, and ordered a drink and a slice of brownie, setting up the pretence of reading, while he people watched. He multi-tasked, reading his book, while flicking his eyes through the crowd, eyes darting to primarily the forearms. Where every
Mycroft finished flipping the pancakes and plating them, slathering them in syrup, something he hadn't done since The Fall. Silence sat heavily between them as they ate, Mycroft devouring his in a way that made him hungry for more as he complied, getting up and making a new batch, focused on making each individual one perfectly round. Gregory watched with wide silent eyes, seeming to shrink in on himself, waiting for the axe that hung above his head to drop, flinching when Mycroft slid a small plateful over to him, on the top one, written in syrup already running, read one word. '
"Sally called. Another body has been found, she's sent an officer to come pick us up. Yes, she, Lestrade was taken off, remember? at Mycroft's insistence. Unfortunately, you will not be joining me as she would not appreciate you contaminating the crime scene with, that. So I will go in your stead- oh shut up, I know what to look for, I've seen you going through everything enough times and heard you talking to my daughter, who Molly is currently looking after until you are better. So mister, you will shut up and lie there and focus on getting well, and eat the soup Mrs Hudson will bring you, and take the medicine, and-"
"Mycroft. I see you have gone back to baking, who would have thought this case would affect you so? Is it because you knew she was close to me? Or something else?"
"I do, I have a flat, but, it has many knives, and, right now I might use them..." He pouted and looked down, working on making himself look pathetic.
"As My brother has constantly told me, you like telling people you are a captain, so use that as your officiality, and remind Ms Donovan that the only reason she is in charge of the case is because Detective Inspector Lestrade is indisposed and you have express permission from the higher up in charge of the Yard, superintendent included to be there. If that does not work, then simply inform me and I shall make arrangements. Good day Doctor."
Mycroft smiled, he had something to do, finally, a distraction. He donned his finest suit, grabbed his umbrella and headed to his car, directing his driver to the address.
A single text alert rang across the otherwise silent room. An answering groan came after it, along with a sniff at an attempt to clear a heavily congested nose, shortly after a tuft of scruffy hair as Sherlock poked his head out from his cocoon, blearily staring at his phone on top of his dresser. He untangled his legs and stood, grabbing his phone and sitting back down heavily on his bed, groaning as a wave of dizziness hit him, once it passed he unlocked his phone and opened the new message from his brother. It was a video link, he opened it and hit play, the sound of his Captain Watson echoed throughout the room, putting a smile on his face and helping him feel better, pride swelled in his chest at the sight of him, sending a shiver not relating to his fever echoing down his spine. He didn't bother with a response back, there was no need, instead he shed his sheet completely and focused on standing, leaning heavily against the wall and letting out a second groan,
Sherlock turned to look at his brother, frowning when he noticed him gone, and he turned to Molly inquisitively, noticing her face change from an expression he couldn't recognise to professional.
"It, it was hell Mol, I found myself wishing I was back at Afghanistan... We got there after finding out, Eurus Holmes, yes, Sherlock's sister, had been getting out with help from the staff, she, played us from the start. She was in control the whole time, I said that we were soldiers, but really, we were prisoners of war, her war. We got tested, with small simple cases, the call to you, the one where you had to say, those words, then she feigned giving a choice to Sherlock, Mycroft or me, he had to shoot one of us, instead, we all got knocked out, gassed.
With that Greg all but dragged Sherlock out of the morgue, who was looking at John with a puzzled, deducting face, a flash of concern darting across just before his face disappears from view. John made to leave after them, feeling Molly's eyes on him.
He took a photo on the phone he found of the sickly pile of sheets and bones, and shut the door, just in time to hear a
He lays there for several minutes, feeling the water slowly heat up as it leeches out his fever, before a sudden harsh wave of nausea hits him, and he bolts upright, clutching his suddenly aching head, as he leans over the side of the tub and brings up the soup Mrs Hudson had been nice enough to feed to him, groaning as he also sees his half digested medication. Slowly lying back down, he closed his eyes for a second, rubbing at where he can feel congestion settling in his lungs, before hoarsely calling out, "Mrs Hudson!"
Mycroft stepped out of his car at exactly 4.45am, only 15 minutes after the report of the latest body had been found. He stared over the building, questioning the change in locations. He walked over to the scene, and walked under the tape, stopping at the peculiar sight of Sergeant Donovan, sitting on the steps of the paramedics, with a shock blanket over her, looking dazed.
Sherlock entered the room, to see his brother rapidly disrobing and changing back into a new suit, his bloodied one in a bag behind him. A startled sound alerted Mycroft to his brother, and whirled around, both fear and shame flickered across his face, chased by anger, before settling on his neutral face, watching the show upon Sherlock's face, as fear, relief, concern, confusion and anger dance across his. Finally the two stared at each other, Mycroft dressed in just his boxers and an open shirt, heart monitor electrodes still littering his chest, as well as some dried blood on his stomach and covering his arms and hands, along with some smeared across his face, which was also littered with various scrapes and forming bruises. Realising Sherlock was staring, Mycroft gave a thin tight-lipped smile and tried maintaining his dignity, straightening up, shaking hands grabbing wipes and trying to scrub off the blood, which he realised was also on his legs.
"Please. Don't insult my intelligence. There was no note for starters, and apart from the assault on her a few months ago, she was doing well."
John had settled down while Greg had been thinking, and was busy wiping his face, muttering apologies to Greg and Molly for his behaviour.
"Look, I wouldn't even let you near the scene if it weren't on orders from higher up. So suck it up, and tell the damn
did I have to find out Sherlock was in hospital, from Mrs Hudson? Why didn't you at least text me? I would have thought after fucking Sherrinford that you'd at least trust me more? Given the fucking circumstances we found us in? Instead, I have to find from my landlady where Sherlock was, information that you kept away from me, which caused me to get angry in front of your partner which then led to me accidentally triggering him. Did you think any of that would happen?" John paused, looking Mycroft up and down, giving the man the uneasy feeling of being deduced himself, feeling his walls being stripped down as he stared the doctor down. "No, I can see you didn't. In fact, you didn't even expect us to be back that early. The only reason we even were back early was because I wanted Greg to see a sick Sherlock, show him a new side to him, see if it helped cheer him up, because the man is a wreck, your man is a wreck, you should look after him more. Yes I know I'm one to talk, seeing as Sherlock is lying in a bed, when I should have seen the signs, known he was getting worse, as a doctor i should have recognised the worsening symptoms."
"Ask me yourself, or deduce yourself." Yawned Greg, walking down the stairs, raising an eyebrow when he saw the patches on John's arm, turning his gaze questioningly to Mycroft, who simply sent a 'I'll explain later.'
Panting, he stood over her shallowly breathing body, mentally taking a photo of her and the surrounding bodies in each pod, before leaving, pinning the message to the front of her pod, cleaning up, and leaving.
He rolled his eyes and growled low. "Yes. Write. Your. Suicide. Note. Don't mention anything. Just a short message."
The two paused, Mycroft to pour the tea and dish out sugar, Sherlock to take a bite of the cake, smiling at the taste in spite of him not usually eating as it slows down his thinking. After another bite he continued.
John? John! You're having a nightmare! Wake up!" Greg hesitantly walked towards John's now thrashing form, not wishing to get too close.
Sherlock shook his head, reading over the file, inwardly smirking when he saw that all of Mycroft's intelligence never picked up the time he had spent with Ashley during his stint on the streets. He drank his tea, ignoring his phone when it went off, setting the files across his desk, he brought up last nights crime scene and grabbed his violin, playing as he thought it over, unaware of John watching the detective with amusement, his phone went off again, but he was too deep in thought to notice. The only thing that stopped him was when he smelt something, and he and John ended up speaking at the same time.
She puts her hands on his shoulders, and sits him down on a chair, rubbing his shoulders comfortingly. "John, it'll help. Please, for me."
The timer for his last cake went off and he set it on a final cooling rack, covering each one up, before heading out, alerting his driver on where to take him, holding his umbrella tightly.
sneezed into them, before groaning and coughing, which revealed he was wearing just a loose pair of boxers under the sheet, covered in a sheen of sweat, with a sigh, John fetched the thermometer he kept up in his room, and took Sherlock's temperature. Another sigh escaped him when he saw how high it was and he grabbed out his phone to take a photo of proof of the miserable detective, cursing and throwing the broken phone after fetching out the sim card, searching for one of Sherlock's spare phones.
With his own nod, John started taking deep exaggerated breathing, using his hand to show more. His other hand imitating the breathing, with some effort and concentration, and much much hyperventilating, Greg was able to follow along, and he was able to calm, as he did he noticed Johns firm grasp on his wrist to check his pulse, he also realised they'd been at the hospital for sometime. The driver, noticing the hyperventilating was over, handed a handkerchief back, and John accepted it, wiping the tears off his face, before hugging him, the two sitting like that for a while, before Gregory nodded and pulled back, opening the door and sliding out, bracing himself against the car as a wave of dizziness slid over him, and if John noticed him leaning on him he said nothing.
He stood for five minutes, not quite seeing them, before in an uncharacteristic move, he smashed them in a fit of rage, no cake was spared. By the time he was finished, he was panting, standing over the crumbs, a wave of emotion shook him, and he burst into tears, picking the crumbs up and eating them, before brushing them into a bin, and pulling out a cake he'd made two days ago, slicing a thick slice, covering it in cream and eating it in the living room, taking the cake with him. Staring into nothing, he made quick work of the first slice, then the second, and the third, until the cake was gone, with rising horror, he realised what he'd done. He stood and quickly washed the dishes with shame, heading to his exercise room and setting the equipment on high, working out to work the cake off, turning up the treadmill more to try, futilely, out run his thoughts, he detested when his own thoughts got to him, and he knew from experience that his Mind Palace would do the opposite of help, instead escalating everything.
And then of course we have the fact both of them were sexually assaulted, likely before, as there is no indication from the pools of blood there was disturbance. So, maybe a sexual sadist? One who does not wish to be identified, or perhaps one that is too well recognised. He is someone insecure with his own sexuality, yet confident enough to lure two different but similar victims.
"I should not need to remind you that you are only in charge of this case due to circumstances that have caused Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade to be unable to investigate this case any further, and you are only in said position of leading officer because of express permission from the utmost highest up, whose name is above your paygrade, but certainly not above mine. Do I make myself clear? Never assume I am not up to the task of investigating a scene because I am not Sherlock Holmes. And certainly
As such, as he marched towards Sally, she knew she had said the wrong thing, and she opened her mouth to apologise, but it was far too late, Captain Watson was out now, and he didn't take nonsense from anyone.
Gregory opened his mouth to protest that John needed more sleep, but he yawned, and fell asleep instead, John keeping vigil for hours, putting on caffeine patches from a hiding hole of his, needing to stay awake for his friend. Who didn't need to know he may or may not have remembered the nightmare after all, Greg was the one who was in need currently, not John. Just like when John eases Sherlock's new nightmares that rose since Sherrinford, Sherlock was important then, John comes second. He'll be fine, of course he will. He always is. He always is... He has to be. If he isn't, who will be? Who will be the rock for everyone if he isn't? Sherlock and Mycroft are too stubborn and emotionally stunted, Greg needs a rock the most. John will live with being it, he doesn't need fine. He was fine. John was just fine, right...?
"Uh, you were having a nightmare i guess? Thrashing and screaming and the like. I didn't know what to do."
She nods, turning her lips to one side to think it over, moving to one side as John breezed past her.
He cursed under his breath. He now had a new Crime scene for the case, Sally Donovan as the leading detective, a now likely broken phone, and to top it off, a sick Sherlock from the amount of time he spent in the hospital visiting Greg and Mycroft. Picking up the phone and shoving it in his pocket, he stalked towards the consulting detectives room and threw open the door, stopping at the pitiful sight. Sherlock was hunched under his sheet with just his face poking out, his eyes and nose were a bright red and he squinted up at John, tissues littered the floor. As John stood there, Sherlock brought out a tissue bunch and with a mighty
There was a moments hesitation, the nurse Sherlock address scarpered out, the rest remained, curiosity getting the better of them. Until Sherlock whirled around, gathering information and putting on his deduction face, drawing breath to speak, and they all rapidly bolted, nearly running over the one who returned and left with a curtsy. Sherlock smirked after them all and with a bow of his head, shut the door.
When she finished the first book, she stretched and checked the time, surprised that it was only 8.30pm, before realising that her room was once again quiet, peeking her head out, she saw all but 2 or three had left the room, she smiled in relief, seeing the also shut curtains, feeling the call of nature, she left and relieved herself, quickly returning to her pod, stumbling slightly as she finally feels the effects of her Vodka. Getting back, she checked the replies.
"You know best Sherlock, when its bagged I'll send you the laptop and phone, so you may do your thing with those."
She nodded, frowning when he gave her a list of things to check in both the blood and stomach contents before looking over the body once more. He stood there staring for over 20 minutes, until she nudged him and informed him his phone went off.
He looked down at the not-quite-a-toddler-yet-not-a-baby with a confused frown, flinching back as she giggled and reached out for his nose, it was then that he noticed the baby monitor behind her and saw the flashing light indicating it was on, and uncharacteristically cursed himself, knowing John was going to kill him when he got back. But at least for now he was off the hook, he grabbed his phone and sent out a flurry of texts to various people.
Mycroft nodded. Sighing and taking deep breaths, his mask crumpling  as he realised it truly was just the two of them in the room, squeezing his hand every so often.
She grabbed his shoulder, causing him to flinch, and turned him back to face her, tugging him away from the door, getting a proper look at him.
Only a soft thump from his book falling showed any sign what happened, while beads of sweat appeared, and his breathing slowed down, along with his heart beat. He writhed under the blanket, eyes flicking weakly beneath his lids, as if watching a rapidly occurring movie. His memories flashing just under the surface, tormenting him as his blood slowly emptied more into his bandage and black long sleeve top. Muffled groans barely escaping his parted lips.
"I apologise for my actions. I see dear brother you went to the latest crime scene? What was different this time? Oh, a lead? Did you find a lead?"
"Sherlock... Fine, the arms seem to be the initial cuts, which is rapidly becoming his signature. After that, it appears is when she bit his nose off, as that's when the rest of these appeared, Molly has confirmed her, vagina was indeed next, before he moved onto the torso. This time it is inconclusive whether rape occurred," John paused, as out of the corner of his eye, he caught Lestrade flinch hard, taking a breath a continuing with his Doctor Watson mask. "From the torso it is hard to tell where he started first, but its clear it was less thought through, done with a lot of rage and aggression not seen in his other victims, each other one was clearly thought out. Dani ruined whatever plan he had by first off, alerting her friends to the thought of being followed, secondly by checking into St Christopher, which of course caused the quick deaths of all those also checked in, and thirdly, by attacking back, biting his nose clear off. He'll likely strike again soon, since his initial plan was disrupted. Considering how organised he seems to be, he won't yet go for the three he targeted, Sally, Mark and Don, going by how he has been so far, he'll likely wait till Dani isn't as fresh before slowly picking them off. Tox screens and stomach contents indicate she had been drinking all night, likely purchased when she discovered she was being followed.
Calling to her created a whole new bunch of problems as he promptly had a coughing fit which appeared so suddenly he didn't have a chance to brace himself against the end of the bath. As the coughing got harsher he slid further down, each cough bringing a new wave of water towards him, until the force of the coughs got him choking on water as he fought to sit up. However the coughing and flu had left him weaker than usual, with a final spluttering cough he choked and sunk below the water, eyes half open, the splashing barely calming when with a crash the door was forced open, and Mycroft burst in, lifting his younger brothers body out of the tub and onto the floor, tutting at the vomit as he started compression's immediately, and was rewarded with a stream of water flowing out of Sherlock's mouth, helping him roll on his side as he kept coughing.
Molly... I can't sleep, I dream about it all the time... I'm just, so tired, but Sherlock is struggling, and Greg needs help, and Mycroft hasn't accepted Sherrinford either, I have to be there for them..."
"How many times do I have to tell you, it's John, and stop, reading me, deducing me, 'm fine. Why're you here?"
Everyone looked to the condom wrapper in Sherlock's hands, before he dropped it into a new evidence bag. Attention was drawn back to the body, the same thought on everyone's mind.
Mycroft knew when Greg got home, just like he knew he had smoked, twice before arriving home, and finally, he knew that tomorrow might or might not cost him a chat about his eating habits. In front of him sat a generous slice of cake with a helping of ice cream covered in syrup, with a full glass of whiskey which he sipped. He happily leaned back into his partner, inhaling the scent of smoke, along with an underlining of blood, and the ever sharp scent of cinnamon, offering up a second hug, and a glass of whiskey. The two sat in a tense silence for a while as Mycroft finished off his snack, and having half his whiskey, before sighing and opening his mouth.
"You are right John, my apologies. I should indeed have informed you of Sherlock's condition, I can see how you seeing he was gone and the state of the bathroom would have caused you to panic. You are also right about how especially after, after Sherrinford," Mycroft paused, paling further, absently rubbing his own scars, "I do trust you after that event. How could I not? If not for you, things may have gone worse for me... However this is not the time for additional thank you's in that regard. You not seeing my brother's worsening condition is not on you. I thank you for looking after both him and my Gregory, I know he is a wreck, but, I, I don't know how to help him..."
"Nd I'd do it again..." A mumbled voice interrupted them. John blearily staring at them. Heaving himself out of the chair and stumbling for the coffee, applying fresh patches as he does, ignored the barely veiled concern following him.
He grinned smugly to himself as he went down to the waiting car, telling the officer it was just him. He was proud of himself for that, he knew that she hadn't visited Lestrade once when he was in the hospital, he knew she was celebrating to herself about the news, but sensed she'd object to it being just him, awaiting a reply.
"Well for starters, you just flinched at a slight touch. And frankly, Greg is right, you look awful, you have since, well, since you, Sherlock and Mycroft returned from that awful, awful place. John, what happened? No one ever told me, could you, please?"
Perfect. She was just what he was looking for, she'd be much better than his last one. Maybe he'd have a little more fun before he finished with her.
Okay, so, there is gonna be a tad more detail in terms of the victim, and a hell of a lot of detail into sexual abuse towards the end in this chapter, keep yourself safe, i warned you.
John cleaned up the mess of the cake and cups left over from the discussion the brothers had, looking at Sherlock who was currently thinking lying down on the couch, fingers steepled in his thinking pose. He helped himself to a slice of cake and placed a glass of water next to his detective, he found the cake a little too sweet, but otherwise surprisingly good, hours passed and he fell asleep in his chair while waiting.
Greg woke to the sound of a scream. Well, woke isn't the right word, that would imply he had fallen asleep, he hadn't. He couldn't. He refused. Too scared of what sleep may bring him, but he had found himself dozing, not quite asleep, and not quite awake, which is what alerted him to the scream. Still, it took him a while to orientate himself, and realise where he was. It took another pain filled, terrified, no, terrified doesn't cover it, petrifying scream to snap him into action and bolt down the stairs from John's room to Sherlocks and burst through the door, which he could neither confirm nor deny was now smashed off his hinges.
After hiding the notebook again he went out to the living room to play the violin in a trance, at this rate they were going to have a serial killer on their hands, and he was excited.
Sherlock breezed in, stopping when he saw Ashley's face, before recovering his composure. He stepped closer to the body, pulling the sheet down, and looking over the various scars that littered her body, without a thought he took the gloves Molly offered and pulled them on, unaware of her offering the same to Mycroft, as the two examined the body silently.
Sherlock waved his hand dismissively in her direction, already seeing the scenes laid out again in perfect detail, walking himself around it.
"Uh, hi, I'm Will. I uh, actually had an accident that lead to coming to today..." He rolled up his sleeve, showing the bandages, inwardly smirking when he saw the previous cuts had bled through, his smirk intensifying as a few occupants shifted in their seats, some of them subconsciously rubbing or scratching their locations of choice. Satisfied he rolled it back down, "Uh, sorry. I just, need to stop, i know i do, but everything just gets so much, you know? Everything built up, and before I knew it, I had grabbed the blade and cut. The feel of the blade slicing through my skin, and the blood bleeding out, it just felt so good. I watched for a while, before the guilt sat in and I took care of it. It took a while, I kept just watching the blood, as if in a trance. It made me want to slice more, you know?"
"Yes, well, some people are worth melting for." With a light blush dusting his cheeks, Mycroft beat a hasty retreat, leaving a giggling Greg behind.
He looked up at him, with a small frown, surprised he hadn't even touched his food, and he began nibbling, more playing with his food, cutting it up into small bite sized pieces, jumping when he heard his partner clear his throat, staring at his food that was looking more and more nauseating by the second. Fighting the urge to push the plate away, he instead took another bite, stilling as he saw his medication piling up, most of which had to be taken with a meal, with the tiniest of nods, he swallowed his pills with a cold coffee.
Eventually it was time for him to move on. Clinging to the book like it was a lifeline, and hunching up to get into character, he walked to the meeting. He knew by now. People don't care. They see, but they don't truly
Mycroft and I, we woke on operating tables, still in the prison, she did this on both Mycroft and I, different incisions of course, more than once I had to save Mycroft, she got close to killing him twice. While that happened, Sherlock had to follow clues, to find us. You, you can't, you can't imagine the pain Mols... I've never heard Mycroft scream like that. I, I was forced to watch as she tortured him, and vice versa... She tied us down, and gave us no painkillers, no numbing things... I can still feel the blades, her hands on my organs, my lungs. She punctured my spleen Molly... And, and, she, hid us so well, it took Sherlock a few days to find us, days, within the prison, because the other prisoners were out, and she had him dosed with some chemical that limited his brain power for 24 hours, I don't even know how we survived...
He frowned. It took the killer this long to kill again? Early pattern had suggested this killer had severe blood lust with a huge sadistic streak, requiring a kill a day to be satisfied, what took them so long? Realising he had spent several minutes standing there thinking he sent a reply.
"Okay, so both have been presented as suicides. Both have a history of mental illness in at least one form, that much is clear by the amount of psychiatric medications both took. They also both used Self harm as a coping mechanism, yet however scars tell us that they were not suicidal.
John opens the door and goes in first, turning to see Greg's face at the silence, smirking and continuing, jogging to his and Sherlock's room, not noticing the open bathroom door. He skidded at the sight of just the sheet on the floor, and back tracked to the bathroom door which he just registered was opened, he saw the puddle of drying vomit, and not yet dried up water, grabbing some paper towels, he started mopping up the vomit, freezing when he saw the blood in the toilet, his mind racing with possibilities, while simultaneously beating himself up for leaving Sherlock when he was sick.
As soon as Mycroft was out of sight Greg tried settling down to read, hissing as once again the bandages tugged along his cuts, and he scrunched up his nose, struggling to find a good position where it wouldn't hurt. Finally he found a position, before groaning, reaching for the juice, blinking back spots of dizziness, shaking it clear and drinking from it, before shakily putting it back, leaning his head on the back of the couch, promptly passing out, paler than his books, a stark contrast to the red steadily bleeding through his bandages.
That was two hours ago. She cursed to herself and turned on her lamp, stumbling to the light switch and getting dressed with one hand, making a phone call with the other.
"Greg, mate. You are truly an idiot, what the hell could have made you do this?" He paused, recalling the other day at the crime scene, and he remembered the look in the Detective Inspectors eyes. "Oh Greg, this cases is close to you, isn't it? You moron, you shouldn't have taken it..."
"Okay. My office is not far from here, if you need me simply call out. I am tempted to call Doctor Watson to look after your, wounds, as well. However, I know you would object considerably. So instead I will change your bandage when lunchtime comes around, you just sit, and relax my dear, do not worry about work or your cases, our best man is on it after all."
"Hey, you're awake, I'm sorry about last night, I know how you get about these cases. So, did you know her? Was she, part of your homeless network?"
Turning on the lights of her unmarked car, she sped all the way to the inn, showing her badge to the bored receptionist, she unlocked the door to the room and froze at the scene. Only one word described what awaited her. Bloodbath. She stumbled outside and managed to send one text before emptying the contents of her stomach.
He sat himself on Mycrofts lap and kissed him softly, snuggling into his chest, before stealing a sip of Mycroft's tea, raising an eyebrow at the lack of response from John, and together they looked over, at the once again prone, sleeping body. Mycroft moved them both to the sofa so they could keep an eye on him and quietly converse.
and looking up the topic first off, noting down everything, including the chemicals released, before with a clean blade, made a small incision on his arm, grinning at the adrenaline that rushed through his veins, letting it bleed for a while while he wrote down his findings on it, even noting the size of the incision, and the length of time it bled.
The music that had been helping John fall asleep had stopped, and over the fading echos of the final notes, he heard murmers, before he got gently shaken awake. Blinking awake, he focused blurry eyed on the figure of his best friend and room mate, Sherlock. He rubbed his eyes hard and focused on the clock behind him, groaning and closing his eyes again.
He drained his glass and refilled it, rearranging his mask upon his face, and looking at his silent lover, freezing as it shatters at the sight of a hyperventilating Greg, struggling desperately to light a cigarette. It didn't take long for Mycroft to snap into battle stations, first off lighting the cigarette for him and placing it in his mouth, being careful not to touch him much, before quickly grabbing his safety blanket and soft toy, wrapping the blanket around Greg and handing him the toy, finally lining up his cocktail of medications, watching his eyes dart about and move as if watching a scene only he could see.
"Right then dear brother. Lets get you cleaned up." Mycroft sat up, starting to remove the mask to protest, sliding a somewhat broken mask over the panic, before Sherlock pushed him back down and replaced the mask, after peeling off the top, "No, stay down, it is my turn to look after you. You are in no state to look after yourself, consider it a thank you for all the times you cared after me. And don't tell me 'caring is not an advantage,' We are siblings, Holmes, we must stick together, we two are all the other has. John and Gav-Greg aside of course."
"Fresh, yes I know, I know. Because you are a genius who gets bored." Kissing him on the forehead. "And you dont eat on a case because it 'slows you down' despite how many times I have tried convincing you that it is not possible. But you don't let your body rest when you are sick, and you know you need to, I know you do, because you are smart. So, shut up, lie down, and rest. And for heavens sakes don't sulk, I'll check on you when I return."
He got a pout in return as well as puppy eyes, laughing and shaking his head at the detective, as they both blatantly ignored the black sedan following them. They joked and laughed the whole way to the cafe, John secretly pleased with himself getting Greg to brighten up so easily. That was, until they entered the Cafe, which was too crowded for Greg's liking, and instead fell silent, hunching into John instead. With a nod, he changed plans, ordered food and coffee for them both to go, and once it was ready they collected it and left.
He glanced at the file sent, before pushing it aside, grabbing a new clean notebook, he had a new experiment to run. He opened the notebook to the first page, labelling it '
He browsed the streets, continuing his checking, while he looked up the time of the next support group, smiling inwardly when he saw he had two hours till it, just enough time for bait. He shoved his hands into his hoodie, fiddling with his purchase, grinning as he ran his thumb along his blade. As he was making his way to a nearby public toilet, he sneezed, suddenly and painfully, groaning and clutching his nose, gingerly feeling the gauze on its tip, sighing in relief as there was no blood bleeding through.
"No you are not. You eat sporadically, there are times you smoke like a chimney, you do dangerous things when bored, you often forget even simple things."
"Nonsense mate. Happens to us all, we're here for you, don't forget that. Why don't tonight, you sleep over at my place?"
Easy. No scars go over any veins or arteries, well, at least not deep enough for death, not until they died. Many of their scars also show the slightest hints of hesitation, almost like they were begging for someone to come stop them.
With the agility of Sherlock and the haste of a dog on a trail he looked around each spot, scanning before spotting a phone buried in the sheets, and he dove at it, smiling triumphantly when it wasn't even locked. He took an offered pair of new gloves and scanned through it, looking at past google searches, nodding to himself, looking through a few more things before putting it into an evidence bag offered, removing his gloves and strolling back to the initial crime scene.
John felt a slap across his face and a shaking, and with a blink he saw Mycroft crouched before him, paler than before, he was aware he was hyperventilating, and muttering loudly, about what he'd just remembered, he doubled over and vomited on the floor, as phantom pain flooded through him, shooting along the scars. He knelt on his hands and knees, heaving and coughing, eventually accepting Mycroft's help up, and they moved away from it, Mycroft waiting till John was calmer, and had no signs of another flashback.
Entering the toilets, he checked every stall, before entering the one for disabled people or parents, carefully removing his hoodie and placing it on the changing table, getting out his instruments. Grabbing his sharp blade, he rested it on his forearm, closing his eyes, and drawing it across the skin, hissing softly as relief and numbness floods his system, before flexing his arm, pleased he still had full function, drawing two more cuts along the first, checking they were deep enough so they could bleed two hours later still, with a nod, he let it bleed. For good measure, he methodically drew lines across his ribs, and then on his thigh, covering all the bases, he let them all bleed for a while, before dressing each one, starting with his thigh, and finally his arm. Checking each one once they were covered, smiling when they were. Perfect. Cleaning his blade, and flushing all evidence away, he ruffled his hair pulling on the hoodie, shrinking in it, he pulled the hoodie up around him and checked his reflection in the mirror. Perfect. He looked the part.
Greg awoke the next morning to the smell of bacon and eggs, and something else. Dragging himself out of bed, hissing in pain as his arms pulled and his bandages rubbed, feeling the scabs lift and start to bleed once more. After taking care of his morning business, he headed out to the kitchen, his stuffed dragon in one hand, a soft smile spreading across his face at the sight of his lover in the kitchen with an apron on, covering his dress shirt and trousers the most casual he normally goes. He sat at the counter, grunting his thanks as Mycroft slid over a cup of hot coffee without looking up, watching over the eggs, bacon and stack of pancakes. Without a word, simply a small frown, he dished up the bacon and eggs, flipping a stack of pancakes onto a plate and pouring in the next batch, sliding Greg's meds, including an iron vitamin to rebuild it back up, and breakfast over to him. Except for the clattering of dishes the kitchen, it was silent, causing Greg to shift in his seat and grunt as he moved the wounds once more, the concerned look he got from Mycroft was the biggest emotional response he'd gotten in a day.
The nurses gave them looks as they walked to Sherlock's room, but otherwise paid them no mind. Gregory opened the door, just in time to see Sherlock trying to pull his IV out and remove his oxygen, freezing when the door opened. His eyes went first to Greg, reading and deducing him easy as anything, a small frown adorning his face as he finished, before glancing over to Mycroft, doing a double take when he noticed John, half getting out of bed to go to him before a coughing fit over took him, causing him to collapse into Gregs open arms, and getting helped back into bed, being moved over to make room for John, who Sherlock watched get laid down.
John nodded, and led him back upstairs into his bed. "Right, then I'll watch you, wake you if you appear to be in distress."
Once he was done, he hid the notebook in a hiding spot that hadn't yet been found in drug raids, and dressed the wound, lying in bed as thoughts of the crime scene floated in his head. Playing his violin until he fell asleep.
Once again, John found himself being hung up on, just in time for him to pull up to the crime, taking a moment to find his, 'Captain persona' as Sherlock loved calling it, he strode out of the car towards Sally, the officer who drove him chuckled, and rushed after him, he wanted to see how that would go on.
They walked back over to the body, and looked over the injuries together. With gloved hands, as careful as possible, his hands darted over the skin, brushing the gashes, Molly watched his gentle nature for a second, before moving onto the more private area, taking swabs of it. The two worked in silence, looking over every slice, every puncture, until the machine that was running DNA let out a noise, indicating it was finished, which Molly ran over to and checked it, scrunching her nose in irritation.
Dani's night had been normal enough. She had gone to her group therapy, her prescription had been renewed, all her scars were just that, scars. For once, in a long time, she felt happy. So why did she get a sense of foreboding? The feeling of being followed crawled over her skin, burrowing deep, she turned at every slight sound, every sudden movement. After jumping for the 50th time, she made a decision. She texted some friends from the group that she didn't feel safe, and to check in on her in the morning, then she went to buy several books, a charger and a change of clothes, and caught a cab to St Christophers Inn, where she checked in to a pod.
The last of his words echoed across the car park. Silence following them, before a round of applause from the officers watching. Sally nodded, stirring something more in Captain Watson.
A groan answered him, as well as a loosening off his grip, it was a start at least. Gently as he was able, he starting untangling Greg, frowning at the long sleeve before rolling it down, resting he head in his arm at the sight of the bandage. He lifted him and carried the sleeping DI to bed, curling around him so he felt safe, resolving to get the case solved fast.
Once he reached the bathroom he locked the door, removing a loose tile he pulled out a little 'ptsd kit' that he was proud of for hiding from Mycroft for this reason. He pulled out his emergency cigarettes, as well as a lighter, a sharp blade, gauze and medical tape. It took a few minutes to light the cigarette, but once he had it only took a few drags on it to get down to the filter, he lit a new one and puffed on it, as he rolled up his sleeves and tossed his pants to the side, sitting on the floor, he grabbed the blade and took a huge breath, trying to convince himself he didn't need it. All attempts vanished as another memory slammed into him, and he lost any control he had over his body as it washed over him.
"You are correct, I have been myself to investigate, I thought you and Greg needed the sleep, I'm telling you though, because the newest victim has bitten off the nose of her assailant, and also, because she was a friend of Sergeant Donovan. And he threatened her life, as well as a few others. In a few hours I'd like you to go to St Barts and help Ms Hooper examine the body. For now, how is Greg?"
With a nod, he left, leaving the Holmes brothers staring at each other until they stubbed out their butts in the tray.
