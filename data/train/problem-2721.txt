Mycroft gave her a sceptical look before giving in. "Fine." Pause. "But what do you have in mind?"
"Sort of. My mum isn't super musical but from what I know my father wasn't."
"No," She whimpered.
As soon as the door clicked, Sherlock's whole body began to shake with ragged breaths and huge sobs. The family room being filled with the sounds of pain.
"No. There's been nobody."
"Alex."
"Felt like exploring the American civil war." Atlas explained, laughing slightly as she looked at him.
"I'm so tired." Atlas whimpered, her head running at ten times the speed it normally would.
"Hey," Sherlock said with a smile. "Did I say that?"
"Sherlock, the college has rung." John said, it sounded like he was packing up his things in his office.
Greg sighed as the lift went down the last few floors, and opened into the small reception of the low budget hotel. Exiting they made their way to where Molly had parked her car in the car park, hopping in.
"You can use it in the chorus." She smiled, her top teeth sucking her bottom lip in habit.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"Okay, I've got you, I've got you," John said as the seizure continued. Just as he was beginning to feel hopeless Sammy appeared and handed him an injection of lorazepam to stop the seizure. Injected into her bottom through her tights, they waited. "Okay, I've got you. I'm here. Papa's here. I'm here my darling. I'm here. I've got you."
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"Hmm, well," Mycroft said with a smile before Atlas got up and hugged his shoulders. "Thank you."
"Alright. If it's what you want." Leanne said, leaning back in her chair.
"Because your old. Your both
After some time had passed Rosie woke up, still inside Sherlock's jacket.
"We'll do it how you want." John said kindly. "To be honest with you, I wouldn't be surprised if we wanted the same thing."
"I'm afraid so." The doctor smiled sadly. "We've got quite a few more of these uphill battles to go."
"My man likes it," John smiled before Sherlock put his hand to John's chin and stroked it, a blush spreading across his cheek.
"Don't be too loud dad, papa." Rosie said quietly. "We'll wake Atlas up." Then they all sat on her bed and began the story. Sherlock doing the voice of the Caterpillar making Rosie giggle quietly, John had taken on the voice of the rabbit and was now completing one of the lines. Sherlock was holding Jeff and was pretending that he was playing another character sending Rosie into another fit of quiet laughter.
"Nice to meet you properly." Atlas said to Eurus before giving Mycroft a hug. Four and a half genius minds, knew that there need not be any explanation for Atlas' speech. And they relished the moment.
"Sammy." Atlas whispered. "I'm going to fight this."
"I think I will." Atlas replied smiling before dressing herself in a hat, jacket and scarf.
"Yeah?" John asked quietly.
"Jacket." Sherlock warned and she collected it, pulling on her wellies on her way. She took Wanda's hand and they began walking along a path. Sherlock had his jacket on and took the dog, Rosie getting excited.
On one side of the room there was a full wall length one way mirror. And on the other side the remainder of Atlas' family watched, Sherlock keeping Rosie's eyes covered. Mr and Mrs Peterson
"I'm excited to start school." Rosie said as she held Atlas' hand. They had let the dog off the lead a few moments earlier. Redbeard was very well behaved like that; staying close and not moving too far away from them; good when Rosie held his lead - although everyone was pretty sure Red's favourite person was the four-now-five year old. Or five by midnight.
Sherlock shivered at the cheekiness. At the casualty of John’s words, knowing his patient had sat in agony for hours, fantasizing about all the ways he wanted to be taken.
Callum’s eyes widened. “Maybe a week ago. Why? What’s happened?”
“You said you needed a good night’s sleep.”
“Gaza Barracks, in Catterick. I’m serving my internship there.”

“Can’t believe you just said that.”
Sherlock raised a tentative eyebrow, obviously confused. “You… have children?”
“Next Thursday.”
MEET THE CHARACTERS:
“Thank you, sir.” With that, Watson stepped from his post and unbuckled the chin strap of his helmet, disgusted at the amount of dirt and sweat that had collected there. He made his way back inside the compound.

“Night, Sherlock.”
"It shouldn't have been either of you." A tear broke free and rolled down the bridge of Sherlock's nose. "I'm so sorry, John. I am so sorry."
*bboy is interchangeable with beat boy. It's basically breakdancing. Thanks, mollyloo, for that little tidbit and gorgeous idea
That’s all he did, was want.
He felt a firm hand on his shoulder. Callum. “Alright there, John?”
John rested his hand on the table as discreetly as possible. He actually needed support to stand. This was fucking ridiculous. Had anyone… Had he ever… Had sex ever even… Shit. Fucking shit.
is exactly what I want to hear. Is he a good kisser?”
“I would surely hope you’d invite me in after driving me all this way.” He gave Sherlock a firm pat on the arse as if to shoo him along. “Go on, then. After you.” John snagged the bags and followed Sherlock through the front door.
“Yes, all right, Jacob, thank you. Excuse me, guys. Keep working and please, god, don’t get crafty with those blades.”
“Tito, will you take a photo for me?” Sherlock turned to look at him, eyes curious and brow furrowed.
"Atlas." Wanda added, smiling slowly to herself. "If it's not out of place to say this and I firmly believe it is not. Then I believe you should adopt her. Sherlock has already adopted Rosie as far as I know."
"My darling," Sherlock whispered. "Stop beating yourself up over it."
"That would be nice, yeah," Sherlock smiled. "Atlas!"
"Preach," Harry smiled. "Mum, you don't happen to know how Atlas has been do you?"
"Hello!" Jo said cuddling her close, adorning her temple with littered kisses.
"Alright, Atlas, I'm going to wipe at the cut to clean it, okay?" Damien said with a smile as Atlas nodded weakly.
from years ago that I can't explain!" Atlas said before she looked at him.
"Of course you can come with us, Rosie," May smiled at her. Atlas pulling Rosie into her side as the young girl nodded.
"You need to get out and see people." John said to her, putting a hand on her knee.
JOHN was set for release later that evening, the doctor's claiming it to be anemia. Nothing that iron tablets couldn't fix. They claimed the long lapse of unconsciousness was down to behind hit in the head when he hit the ground. He did hit the table on his way down.
"Now, Atlas," Sherlock smiled. "On our way home we got some houmous, carrot sticks, fruit and..." Sherlock said, tilting his head and fumbling in the bag for something. "Walnuts!" He exclaimed brandishing the bad and handing them over to her.
SHERLOCK and Rosie entered into a concrete room and stopped. Something wasn't right but before they could turn around the door shut behind them. He lifted Rosie to his side and held her near his chest, his heart beat steady in the young girls ears.
"John." Sherlock said, knowing that the four years older man did those movements when it was aching. Slowly, he finished the chapter and put down the book before hilariously bum shuffling his way over to where John was sat. Gentle fingers rubbed the ache beneath the t-shirt, Sherlock massaging it gently. He placed a gentle kiss to his shoulder before moving his hands again.
"They are his parents." Sherlock said. "If, if we get married, we will look at it. Okay?"
"My nose is cold." Atlas said after some time.
"I'm not angry or mad or sad or any of those things-" John started.
"This is the life I never thought I'd be able to achieve," John said as he looked up at his husband with a gentle smile.
"Dad." Rosie said quietly. "Huggles." Sherlock sighed and leaned down giving her a hug. Then she clung to him like a monkey, him standing up and hugging her close.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
Atlas scowled.
brought an absent Atlas, Greg and Sally as they attended school and work, however Molly stayed. Said she wanted to, or rather she needed to. Sherlock hadn't asked about her being pregnant, but she wanted to tell him just in case he hadn't deduced it yet - particularly as she was planning on stopping by at 221B to tell Mrs Hudson, Rosie and John. The day was worked away at, third coats on the walls in rooms that needed it and the hanging of the curtains and blinds. Downstairs, the bathroom was being meticulously fitted whilst the upstairs one was scheduled to be done the next day. Rosie's room was nearly finished by the end of Monday, with Sherlock just waiting to add in all her personal items from 221B. He'd placed the small bed, a new small bookcase, curtains patterned with coloured feathers and a table with various craft items on it for her creative side. The things she would take from 221B were everything to go inside these things and the pretty oak chest of drawers that her mother picked out for her when she was newborn. He could picture her playing in here and prancing around, stealing glances out the window into the garden below - her bedroom was at the back of the house so to speak. He could see Rosie happy in the room.
"That's good." Atlas said to Rosie who was clinging onto her hand tightly. She began to swing it as they walked along.
parents."
"Yep, well remembered," Sherlock smiled at her as they pulled into the driveway, Atlas spotting the for sale sign. "Hello!" He exclaimed to a lady as he hopped out.
"And I'll facetime Atlas. And could you maybe send through the things the doctors say. And then keep me updated on how you all are and obviously on she is." Sammy said, all his words running out in one go.
"Papa." Atlas said.
"Nothing," Wanda said with a smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Its alright. I'm a primary school teacher. I saw my class list for next term and I saw a Rosie Watson. I'll make sure it gets changed to Watson-Holmes, provide it's her. Reception?" Leanne asked, her cup now half full.
The pattern changed and so did the lyrics and key.
"Making dad and papa pancakes for breakfast," Atlas smiled.
"When the hallucinations come. Don't leave me, yeah?" Atlas asked quietly.
"Thank you." Sherlock said as he looked up at Atlas, Mycroft and Rosie. The dog he never had was now infront of him.
"I'm concerned about why we're doing this." Sherlock mumbled so Rosie didn't panic, but of course she heard it. Glue was dropped almost immediately after and Sherlock assembled it on the back of a piece of paper.
XERXES appeared at the doorstep that afternoon with May. Beckoned in, he entered before Sherlock pointed up the stairs and they went, finding Atlas' room where Sammy and her were sitting on the bed. He knocked before entering with a smile, Atlas' eyes lighting up before she slung her arms around Xerxes' shoulders.
"We'll go shop for what we need this afternoon." Wanda explained, Rosie bouncing excitedly in Sherlock's lap.
John just smiled at him before they looked down at Atlas with frowns.
"I should get, John," Sherlock said quietly. "He'll be able to sort the cut on her head."
"I love you too," John said into her hair. "You smell nice, love. Like fresh air. Did you enjoy your walk?"
"She will be ok," Mycroft said as he folded up the tissue and put it on to the table. Wanda came back up the stairs and sat on the sofa by Sammy, Rosie creeping up and standing next to Mycroft with a tear-stained face. Timothy appearing a moment or so later.
"I was bullied," John whispered as Sherlock kissed his head and then his cheek on top.
"Goodmorning, Atlas," Harry chirped as she appeared and took a seat next to her. "Alright today?"
"Well I need to change and get my phone. We could go with each other or split up?" Atlas asked, tilting her head at him.
"Ew, what even is that?"
John's eyes kept looking at the pan before he finally looked up.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes." Sherlock replied shortly into the phone. "I'll see you soon. Send my love to Rosie and Atlas. I miss them. I miss you. I miss Redbeard."
"Alright," Ruth said pulling a business card out her pocket. "This has my number on it, put it in your phone and send me photos of your work and I'll put some in my shop."
"She'll probably grow out of them fast, but the house came with the painted walls so I thought we might as well utilize them." Sherlock smiled as Atlas looked around the sizable room and out the window.
"Not even that. I'm worried," John said quietly, reaching a hand out to tuck a piece of hair behind her left ear.
"An army medic who has encountered the common side effects of severe pain," Dr Aduba said with kind eyes before John nodded.
"Yeah." John said putting a hand to her shoulder comfortingly. She looked like she was going to cry when Sherlock came in, assessing the situation.
John was sitting at the table watching his sister and mother when his mother's phone rang. As she went to pick it up, John suggested she put it on speaker considering it was his father.
"If anything I'm grateful. When we do get married. A wedding band will be enough." John stated looking at Sherlock, who smiled knowingly in return.
"Sorry if I overstepped." Sherlock said into his tea, disconnected from the outside world. And it was now, John noticed how incredibly worn Sherlock looked. The conversation clearly not having been as easy for him as John had thought. Suddenly Sherlock added rising to his feet and pacing. "I didn't want her to be upset when another kid asks her about why she doesn't have a mummy or a mama or a mum. Because Rosie being Rosie will say that she has a mother. I don't want her thinking that she needs a mum or a mummy or a whatever because she has two dads, one of which is incredibly loving, brave, kind and the loyalist man I ever knew. I didn't call Mary mummy, because Mary is not here. She's not going to be super important in her life because she is not here to share it with her. And I know, its still sort of my fault even if you think it's not, but John. Mary will be nothing more than a photo. And I know it hurts and it's going to hurt. And it hurts me too but Rosie needs to know that it doesn't matter. Because she has two dads here waiting for her when she gets home from school, wakes up or gets hurt." There was a pause. "Mary was my friend too."
"Yeahhh," Sherlock sighed as he put his arm around her shoulder. She leaned against him and sighed as he rested his cheek on the crown of her head. "Your not so little anymore."
"I was thinking."
"No." Sherlock said bluntly. "Why would I remember her?"
ATLAS was throwing up at 3:30am, her stomach kept twisting and contracting at an uncomfortable pace. Her face went bright red and flushed whilst her body shook. A vice gripped her brain and squeezed it tightly as she threw up another round. All guests had previously departed and now Atlas found herself vomiting again.
Sherlock heaved a sigh, retracted his hand and got to his feet. Slowly, he leaned down and pecked a kiss on her forehead before resting his nose against it and slowly getting to his feet. Moving away he watched as John did the same before joining him, flicking the switch and shutting the door.
"Your okay, Ida," Someone was muttering, rubbing her shoulders. "Your okay."
"Atlas. I want to go sit with Atlas." Sammy said quickly whilst John gave a quick nod.
THE first visitor of the day was a very tired and angry Mrs Hudson. She bustled in with Rosie who eagerly reached out for John when the lady entered the room.
"No, I think we're all good here," Sherlock smiled.
"William Watson-Holmes," Atlas smiled before Sherlock glared.
"No, no," Atlas said furtively. "It'll be fine. Just leave it."
"Where's Rosie?" Mycroft asked, sighing as he collected his papers together and filed them away.
THE following morning, John whistled his way around the house, out his room and then stopped. Coming from the music landing, the sounds of two cellists and two violinists playing an original quartet creation of 'Scilienne'. Sammy appeared behind him, messy haired and yawning before Rosie did too. Together, the three of them walked to the music landing to see, running clockwise, Eurus, Atlas, Sherlock and Mycroft, the latter man's back to the trio, cello in hand.
"What?!" Atlas exclaimed, putting her book down. "No papa! I haven't!"
"No," Atlas replied quickly. "I don't like anyone. I don't even know if I were to like them, who they'd be. I think I'm bisexual but I don't know if I am. And I know that I've never liked anyone like that. My dad's the same. He's gay and has only ever loved someone who he made a strong emotional bond with and he's sitting right next to me."
"What happened to your hands?" Sherlock asked looking at Rosie's hands, and feeling her knee. "And your knee."
"Uncle Mycroft." Atlas nodded as she poked her head out from the kitchen. John looking out at the same time before they disappeared into the kitchen again to continue what they were doing.
"Okay, okay," John whispered, a cheek to his head. "We'll go tomorrow morning. There isn't going to be any outgoing flights tonight."
"Yeah! He had the same name as you papi!" Rosie exclaimed as she finished her eggs.
"Really? I'm the best? There are a lot of great men in the world."
"So he died?" Rosie asked quietly.
"Wait here. I'll get them and then
One more, one more, one-
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"It's alright love. Your home." John said, his throat closing up. "Your not Missing In Action. Your alive. Your here." His eyes spilled over helplessly in tears as he looked at his husband. His mouth contorted in an attempt to stop them but in the end he resolved to dropping his forehead onto Sherlock's shoulder and letting out a quiet sob. There was a deep breath as his body shuddered, his chest lying on top of Sherlock's.
(I prevent myself from interrupting, it seems Atlas has been holding a lot of this emotion back.)
"You can't, there's only one of them," Mycroft said with a nod. "No-one can ever care about something as much as my brother does."
"I don't want to, I don't want this," Atlas repeated, arms crossed over her chest pouting.
"I'm assuming we don't yet have the full details on where the poison came fr-" Mycroft started.
"Does Sarah have a cat?" Atlas asked, tilting her head.
"I just don't like them." Rosie said quietly. "They don't like you and Atlas and so therefore I don't." She pouted.
I'm not a doctor and my writing is rubbish do I'll take this moment to remind you all that I am using this as a place to store my fanfiction and it is brilliant if you love it!
"But I don't want them to start happening, I don't want them to," Atlas whispered beginning to hyperventilate.
"Yeah, look at us. With children and pets and it's all so great..." Sherlock was grinning and bright eyed before his face all fell and he suddenly looked deep in thought.
"Yes. And I haven't told you guys for the fact that I am certain you will blame yourselves and that I think you'll both be mad at me. And I don't...I really don't want that." Atlas sighed, looking to the ceiling, tears in her eyes.
"Think fast." Sherlock said as he came back into the room, throwing the pillow at her. Only she didn't catch it and stood frowning at it with a crinkled nose.
"Yes?" Eurus asked quickly and quietly.
EACH paint tin was in the appropriate rooms as everyone got their painting overalls on - well that group literally consisted of Sally, Atlas, Molly and Greg whilst Sherlock said that he would just do it in what he was wearing. He didn't seem to care.
"Yep. Oh, by the way, your appointment at the hospital has moved to tomorrow morning. I've set Rosie up to go see Molly because she's available to look after her with Andrew. We'll pick Sammy up on our way home, I've already arranged it with Leanne and I left Sherlock a voicemail." John smiled.
"Atlas," John said poking his head in before he saw them. "Aren't you supposed to be sleeping?" He smirked as he came into the room.
"And salmon pate." Atlas murmured.
Shs smirked. "Finally."
Enjoy!

shape and he nodded once. "They're coming on Saturday so they might look in but I've made plans on Sunday to go out to lunch with them. Your pa has said that from now on, Sunday's have to remain clear so they can be
"Okay." Eurus whispered before she departed to find two chairs.
"You have to go," Atlas warned swiping the blankets off of her legs and standing up. "It's not...your not...your not supposed to be here. They'll kill you. All of them. They'll...they'll kill you. You have to go. Leave. You have to..."
"Grey hair? Where? Have I got another one?" Sherlock asked frantically pulling at his hair to try and see it infront of his eyes.
"Left about ten minutes ago. She's been violently throwing up and it doesn't show any signs of slowing. She's upset and keeps asking for you both." Doctor Aduba informed and John looked back to the woman.
"You know I can't promise you anything. We just have to wait it out and see what happens." Sherlock said. "Do you think you can do that?"
"Does Jeff like it up there?" Sherlock asked as Rosie nodded giggling as she buried herself in his chest, Jeff eventually falling off his head.
"What?" John choked out past his confusion and surprise.
"Shit," John said his face falling as he scrambled to his feet. "Eurus?" He turned it onto speaker as Eurus spoke into the phone.
"I just...it should have been me. People shouldn't go after our kids. I want them to go after me." Sherlock sobbed as he looked and picked at a piece of thread coming out his trousers. "It didn't feel like this when she was shot. It didn't hurt. I want her back. It's only been about eighteen hours and I want her to come back. What if she doesn't? She could die. I don't think I could handle that. I've only just got her back." Sherlock rambled, clearly admitting everything to his siblings. His breathing was speeding up and his hands shaking as they lay dormant in his lap.
"Who is she, Atlas?" Sherlock asked staying at where he was and looking at a stunned Mrs Pertwee.
"I'm still listening, love," John said loudly, his face pointed to the door of the bathroom where he could just about see Sherlock in the mirror.
Sherlock brushed the unruly blonde from John’s forehead, and watched as his eyes grew heavy. He felt his hand slow, heard John’s breathing settle, felt a warm hand on his hip, and then there was nothing.
?” He stared at Molly incredulously. She would never create something so absurd, but would Sherlock?
“Did you…?” John managed between the strong claps of his calloused hands.
cleanses himself
Callum trotted up the stairs, resting his freshly-shaven chin on Molly’s shoulder. “Yes, we are, in fact. Particularly me!”
“Don’t apologize. You have nothing to apologize for. Maybe we can reschedule?” John knew his voice was far too hopeful, but he couldn’t help himself. This man had possessed far too many of his spare thoughts, and he would be damned if he didn’t at least try to address it.
“You’ve always had a way with words, John. Your suit is hanging in your closet. The service starts at four.”
“You wash, I’ll rinse? I'll be on my best behavior, I promise.” John nodded and began scrubbing, passing the sudsy dishes off to Jane. They were dried and stacked in a neat pile next to her side of the sink. John wiped down the counters and stove and dropped the sponge in the sink.
“Sherlock just gave me some of the compositions, and I was wondering if you’d mind if I ran through them a few times.”
Enjoy the proper meeting of our two favorite men. <3
“I know, Jane. I know.” He didn’t know what exactly, but it didn’t matter. Horrible things happen to great people, and his life was a fucking shining example.
I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
“Still planning to take me home?”
“To my best mate, my idol, and my captain. John Watson, in case you haven’t met him. S’good to have you back.” The glasses clunked clumsily together and the boys downed the beer in one, solid go. John wiped his mouth on his sleeve and laughed.
get bookwork tomorrow. That’s a promise, Alex. Yes, I mean you.”
"Dull."
She nodded enthusiastically, her long, brown hair tied up in a messy knot on the top of her head. She felt it bob as she moved, and giggled. Callum stood behind her, chest against her back, and she tried her best to ignore the warmth between his legs. Her face flushed, relishing his taut arms reaching over her shoulders to flip through the photographs. He hummed, and Molly felt it where his sternum met her spine. She closed her eyes and breathed him in: sweat and sunscreen and earth. The boy smelled like fresh rain and clover no matter when he went, and she loved it. She let her head fall back into the curve of his shoulder.
Only, the ladder was still inside the treehouse after Atlas had been up the previous day. Rosie scowled before looking over to where Atlas was lying in the hammock with Sammy lying in the other direction. Foot to face.
"Okay," Rosie squeaked with a nod for Xerxes, before she hopped into Atlas' lap, leaning against her.
"Come on," Mycroft said, gathering her to his chest as she cried. Behind her back he sent a quick text to his brother.
"Sorry." Sammy said pulling away from John and looking around the table.
"I miss Mrs Hudson. A lot." Atlas smiled.
"Im coming Atlas." Sammy promised, before the janitor holding him back let him through and he kneeled by her side. "They called your dad, he's coming by soon."
"Dad," Atlas said as he turned before dropping onto the bed beside her.
"What the hell have you done to yourself now?" Jo asked as she caught sight of his arm.
"Would you like tea?" Kirsty repeated.
"Papa what?" Atlas asked putting an arm around his back and leaning her temple against his shoulder.
"Jesus christ." John sighed. "I get a pack of lies from my daughter and my family. Brilliant! Just bloody brilliant." There was a quiet pause.
"I know," Mycroft whispered as Atlas let out a little sob. "Oh, Ida, I know." Before opening his arms and letting her in for a hug. "Oh, Ida."
"Ah-ah." John scolded as he closed the laptop lid back down. "No more homework this morning young lady."
"She's slowing," John said as her body began to slow before she stopped, her eyes opening after a moment. And then her eyes went wide in horror and she looked at Sherlock.
"Come and be sociable, love," He held her shoulder as she shook her head. "They're not scary." He ended up sitting down next to her on the floor as she could hear laughter erupting next door, Sherlock's laugh and Rosie's giggle. Sammy however, appeared into the living room and sat down by Peter.
Upon arrival, he signed in, had a few congratulations from colleagues who must have finally found out that he had married Sherlock and continued into his office. Flopping into his office chair, he removed his blazer and pulled out his phone. Finding Sherlock's number and his finger hovered over call, before finally landing. There was a total of four rings and just when John was sure Sherlock wasn't going to pick up, he did.
"Did she rape you, Sherlock?" John asked quietly and Sherlock just nodded before he sobbed and John held his husband against him. "Oh Sherlock."
"You two are amazing when you work together," Sherlock smiled as he unhooked it. "Would you be alright if I hung it up on the wall on the music landing above the sofa, under the fairy lights?"
"This way first." Sherlock said, taking John's hand and leading him into the big room.
"Dad's," Atlas began, looking up. "What have you done?"
"But it is what it is." John said Sherlock's crumbling face turning to look at him as he recounted what he had said to his friend some three years ago now. Instead of John being the one pushing for the hug, Sherlock went in for one, catching his best friend off guard.
"Thank you pa." Atlas chirped as she sat in the front seat and looked out the window.
"What about her friends?" Sherlock asked as he and John got to their feet.
"Now," John said entering into the lobby. "I have been informed by Atlas I have to ask you. Would you like to sleep on a spare bed in Atlas' room? Or would you like the spare bedroom?"
"Atlas." Sherlock said sternly, the young girl looking at him sideways before returning her eyes to the ceiling.
John just gave a smile in return before Atlas, opening her eyes fully, noted he had a beginning of a beard - and it suited him. He held up her fluffy socks and favourite jumper, along with Whisper, her phone and earphones, some books amongst other things. Atlas noted that he had also brought a razor. He placed all items on a bedside table.
And then Mycroft joined in. His singing voice better than anyone else ever anticipated. Shutting his eyes, he blocked out the looks he anticipated he would receive.
"I wish you could too. She was pretty amazing." Sherlock said. "I'm such a softie."
"Yes." Atlas scowled before Sherlock rubbed her shoulder.
"Of course you bloody can." Sherlock managed before standing to his feet. He initiated a quiet hug with John, who accepted it. "I don't even know why I'm crying, I feel happy."
"Eh, why?" John asked before Atlas looked at Sammy gently.
"Of course I will." Atlas somewhat complained before going back to her book forcing John and Sherlock to exchange a look between them as they continued to do what they were doing. "Did the melody I compose work out on the violin?" Atlas questioned after some time, the thought coming briefly into his head.
"Course I can, sweetheart," Sherlock said before returning to her room and in about two seconds flat deduced where she kept her sanitary products and collected one, placing it on top of her clothing. "It's just outside the door."
"Petit." Sammy frowned. "I think I'm gonna drive you home."
"Okay." Rosie smiled before herself and John began leading everyone up the stairs and onto the music landing.
"I know I am," John smiled at her before frowning as she looked away. "Alright?"
"I think I'll sit in here for a while," Atlas said to him as everyone went back into the kitchen.
The second was a scientist, the third a nun, the fourth a psychologist and the fifth a cosplayer. It was at this point Atlas stopped counting and continued reading her book. When all of the days cases had gone through before 4pm Lestrade promptly appeared on the doorstep.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"I'm really sorry, dad," Atlas whispered before he went over to her.
"WHAT are we looking at Mycroft?" Eurus asked her brother who was stood next to her.
John looked at Sherlock in wonder as her breaths evened out and her chest began to fall into a steady rhythm.
"There isn't a threat! And stop shouting at Mycroft." Atlas said as she stood next to her uncle defensively. "It's not his fault. Eurus, Mycroft, Sherlock and I specifically calculated the risk of each spot. This is an unpredictability and we did not expect it."
"Alright sweetheart." Sherlock said kissing her forehead, the young girl giggling.
"Yes. But I was gifted him." Sherlock said. "A friend donated him to me as a present. Something about me liking biology."
"Your not going to die." John replied holding her hands in his as the clock reached four minutes until the bomb went off.
"What are you proposing?"
"Papa and you always ask people about a motif." She said.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"How was the music shop then?" Jo asked Atlas quietly who looked up to meet the eyes of the people round the table.
"I love you, Myc," Atlas whispered looking at him as he nodded.
"Yes, yes like that." Eurus praised as Rosie sloshed a purple streak behind the treehouse with pink and yellow. It appeared that the treehouse was shining in all sorts of colours as figures of soldiers, knights, princesses and Hobbits were drawn on in tiny illustration. "Very good."
feel."
"Oh!" Isla exclaimed. "Harry, you know the rooms their in?"
"I do not understand how you enjoy that stuff," Sherlock huffed as he slid the door open and exited. "Man, it's raining!" He exclaimed. "John Hamish Watson-Holmes, it's a good job I love you so much." He paused as he emerged, just a little soaked. "And a good job I love our daughter so much to be polite to her friends parents."
"Thank you," John whispered as he looked at Atlas giggling with the dog.
"Any questions?" She asked.
"Isla, do you have plasters and antiseptic wipes?" Sherlock asked, the occupants of the room turning to look at him. "Atlas is having a seizure." John looked at him before leaving the room urgently. "Wipes?"
"My little girl. My little girl. My little girl." Sherlock recited over and over and over until John just pulled him into a hug and let him cry into his shoulder. Sammy made his way over to Atlas with Rosie.
"You've been here before. We had a holiday in a little lodge not far from here," Sherlock grinned before he pulled into the driveway of said lodge, going up.
"I love you too." Sherlock smiled goofily rubbing her arm. "And the stars are smiling on us."
"You are so."
"Sherlock, you really are starting to care." Mycroft laughed, his nose pointing in snide.
"I'll stay, if that's okay?" Mycroft asked, looking at Atlas who nodded.
"Surgery?" Sherlock asked immediately, as his eyes found John's face.
"Oh yes, I wanted to ask you something," Sherlock smiled. "Xerxes, is he completely deaf or?"
"I don't know. This is the first one of them I've read." Atlas said before Sherlock being the person he was, picked up the puffet and moved it to sit opposite her. The laptop still with John who was standing.
"All done." Sherlock said as she turned to look at him. She gave him a hug.
"Sherlock." John sighed as he placed a hand over his mouth and listened.
"We know, Sam," John smiled into his cheek before planting a kiss against his temple.
"You live further from the centre than I do." Atlas remarked before she smirked at him. They stood outside the coffee shop before collecting themselves and falling into step with each other. Atlas said that she could pay for a cab but he insisted that from where they were it wasn't far.
"Look at me, Sherlock." John said, blue eyes looking up into his own. His hands held either side of the mans face. "Of course I'll bloody marry you."
"Oh," Sammy said quietly. "Is that because of her seizures?"
"Thank you for not being too mad at me," Sammy said quietly, the sound slightly muffled.
"Your never too old for hugs," John said as he put his hands either side of her face and kissed her forehead. "Now go give your younger old man a hug aswell."
"I couldn't look after her. Well I could, but it became unsafe for me to do so. I was running a particularly dangerous case and it was better I had no child that they could use against me for leverage," Sherlock said quietly. "Not when that child was everything to me and didn't deserve anything that could happen to her. And it wasn't easy. She was the only thing I had, the only person who was mine. The only thing that kept me alive."
"Yep," Sherlock smiled, his face gentle. "Come on, I'll grab your weighted blanket." He lifted it up and then went to the door. "I love you." He said to Atlas who was hot on his heels.
"I'm not su-" Atlas tried to intervene.
"He's from me, Rosie and Mycroft." Atlas said as she gave Rosie a side hug. Rosie just smiled before running forward and hugging the dog.
Jemma prodded the boy next to her before saying. "Xerxes."
"Your room next."
"Is she? Have you?" Jo asked, looking at John cautiously.
"He's not dead." Atlas concluded for them as John was about to take his pulse. It was now that Atlas' stomach churned. Weeks ago she was sat in the window. One of the nights Sherlock had lost his memory, and he was one of the men in pursuit of a younger woman. She'd thought nothing of it - until now. He had a recognisable moustache, not a common thing among men, and a balding head. Atlas' eyes kept looking over to the dead body, tears spilling in her eyes.
"Mr Holmes! Miss Holmes! What do you say to these claims?" The man said running over to them again and standing in their way.
Bruh, I ain't no psychologist.
"Cash," Sammy rasped as he looked at the drink again.
"Papa," Atlas said and she sounded like she was going to cry.
"I'm scared," She admitted, looking at Sherlock with serious side eye.
"Am I missing something?" Sherlock asked nochantly before John sniggered. Sherlock did in fact know, he wasn't stupid. For God's sake the last time he was with her she was seven.
- and Atlas and Sammy had been chatting in her room. The clock was approaching 7 and Rosie would soon be being chased off to bed.
"I'm packed, she's not. We were just chatting and then she just sorta lay back in the middle of conversation, still chatting and promptly fell asleep," Sammy giggled from where he was huddled under a blanket. "Thought I'd leave her to it since she and Sherlock never do sleep enough."
"The one with the little girl and dad found dead from poison. The son punched you in the face and the mother was arres-" Sammy said and he turned his head to look at Mrs Pertwee who suddenly got to her feet and tried to exit only to be caught by Sherlock, pinned against the wall and handcuffed.
"Come on," John whispered. "It's alright. It's okay, Atlas."
"This afternoon, she had a seizure and didn't regain any consciousness" Mycroft informed quickly as she continued to seize. His fingers folded over his mouth as he watched her fingers opening and shutting, her neck stretched and tensed.
"Just proud of you, sweetheart," John smiled as his hand creeped around her shoulder and squeezed it.  She rested her temple against his.
"Yeah?" John asked as he pulled away to look at him.
The door creaked open around about ten minutes later and they could hear both men laughing.
Sherlock rolled over to his side and assumed his normal sleeping position: one knee up, one leg extended, one arm tucked under his pillow and the other curled underneath him. John mirrored him, lacing one leg around Sherlock’s elongated one, returning a hand to Sherlock’s bony hip, and tucking his chin near Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock fell asleep savoring the warm huffs of John’s breath on his neck.
“Nice to have people on our team.” Sherlock turned to face John on the couch. John shot him a curious look before Sherlock moved closer, earl grey tinted breath gusting warmly across John’s nose and cheeks.
Sherlock’s chest was heaving, and John bit at the bones exposed from the sternum.
John wasn’t sure what he had expected. He hadn’t expected anything, to be honest; he wasn’t informed they were going to be coming here. A comforting feeling sank into his skin at the realization. He knew something in Sherlock had shifted and clicked into a new position in order to bring John to his home.
John slid to the edge of the bed, erection sore and throbbing, and spread his legs. Taking Sherlock’s hand, he guided him between his beat-up knees. Then he placed his hands behind his back. “Pleasure me,” John commanded. He was less careful of his tone this time around, momentarily overwhelmed by undeniable want. All he could think about was Sherlock’s cock down his throat, flipping that perfect creature onto the bed and pulling him apart piece by piece, christening this bedroom with Sherlock’s pleasure, knowing now that no one else had been given the honor. He wanted Sherlock to feel him every time he set foot in this space, to picture them like this each time he happened to glance in the mirror.
"Wait! Sir! Your... receipt."
“I love you, Sherlock.”
Sherlock drown himself in everything he could. He had selected Soo Lin as the newest addition to his company; she was kind and gracious and talented. Molly adored her, and the two fell together in synchronization like it was nothing unusual at all. The calls to the other candidates went as expected, apart from Moriarty’s, which, Sherlock admitted,
The oak door pulled open and a stunning brunette held her own in the frame. She was taller this evening, wearing a moderate heel, her hair pulled up in a tumbling mass of curls. She had gentle, brown eyes and thin lips pulled into a warm smile.
Please don't hate me for leaving this where I did! If I continued, it'd surely be a 12,000 word chapter, and I want to be consistent with length! Fear not, I will pick up EXACTLY where I left off...
Heavy breathing fell over his other half, his better half, and as Sherlock slept, John silently wiped away the rivers pouring from his eyes.
my birth,
actions? That you just show up and put some ridiculous love potion in my tea and oh no, you’re feeling guilty and responsible?” Sherlock’s voice was biting and cruel. “ ‘I can’t love Sherlock because poor him, he’ll be here all alone and he’ll be miserable and god forbid that happen.’ That didn't stop you from leaving the first time, did it, John?” John’s eyes were huge and tears accumulated in their corners. “Give me some fucking
Sherlock felt his breath freeze in his lungs. John Watson had seen him perform?
“I mean, I suppose it is. I’ve met the Detective Inspector. Lestrade is his name. Greg Lestrade.” Callum shot her a look. “He only came by to pick up a case file from Sherlock. It’s sort of amazing, really, to listen to the two of them talk. It’s like another language. Well. At least when Sherlock talks.”
“I’m fine, Molly. Just warm. Excuse me.”
Watson stood at the end of the bed and laced his hands under the bend of Sherlock’s knees, and with one good yank, the detective was nearly aligned with the edge of the mattress. The detective's trousers hit his ankles and John hit his knees. He kissed the insides of this gorgeous man's pale thighs. “I have a case to solve.” John murmured against the soft, unseen skin. He breathed in; musk, cinammon, and laundry detergent.
“It has not been home since the day you left.”
“Fantastic. It’s about seven blocks from here.”
I was curious if you guys would be interested in two things:
you don’t mind.” Sherlock knitted his eyebrows in false offense and John gave him a solid punch in the arm. “Sit! And while I’m shouting at you, why did you place the order under John Holmes?” John turned over his shoulder as Sherlock plopped back onto the couch. He raised an eyebrow, waiting for a response. Sherlock only smirked.
John and Jane got up from the couch and headed back into the kitchen so Molly and Callum could hash out an obviously much needed conversation. Jane pulled herself up to sit on the counter. John put the clean dishes away. He leaned against the sink and looked up to Jane, who was still working on her orange soda.
“Welcome to my home, John.”
“Once a week he came here, gave me an update on how you were doing. Told me how conditions near your base were, how they were expected to shift, whether or not it was a risk night for you. I feigned disinterest, but I spent the entire week waiting to hear how you were…”
“You do far more to me than I let on.”
John turned and winked from the bathroom door.
John was beaming up at him, thrilled at the excitement plastered on Sherlock’s face. Had he never ridden a motorbike before?
“I remind you of Daniel Craig?”
Sherlock smiled and ducked his head as he plugged in his information. He handed the phone back to John.
He covered John in the blanket and pulled the man into his side. "I know, John. I know."
“I don’t want to leave this, Sherlock. I’m afraid every day that when I wake up, I’ll roll over and find myself in a cave somewhere, and this will have all been a dream.”
“Thank you so much.” She took a sip and let her head rest against the cabinets. He watched the tension melt from her shoulders. He smiled.
“Mols, it smells amazing in here. Christ.” Callum appeared in kitchen, covered in dirt, grass and sweat. He smelled of earth and boy, and Molly, despite her previous irritation of him being an hour and a half late,
“And? Wouldn’t be the first time, would it?”
be a man of extraordinary character? Just for, say, three minutes?”
“Don’t be nervous, John. You’ll be perfect.”
- Dashboard Confessional
The room burst into applause, laughter, and whistles. John grinned at Jane. All the boys gave him a thumbs up. He found Sherlock towards the back of the crowd. If John wasn’t mistaken, he could swear the man appeared flustered. Jane’s plan entirely. He winked at the wonderful girl as she got up from his lap, grabbed his hand, and offered a deep curtsy.
“Make me a stronger drink?” Callum offered. Molly turned to look at him, and he wilted under her eyes.
Sherlock stood and walked around, picking John’s plate up from the table. He walked to the sink without a word. John felt his stomach nose dive, likely straight out of his arse. He followed Sherlock into the kitchen.
Thank you for last night. Dinner was lovely. As was your company.
“Eleven forty-seven. Plenty of places still open. What would you like?”
Surely the man knew John was smitten – with his dancing, with his voice, with his appearance, but mostly with that insufferably unpredictable way he is the opposite of
. John found that every time Sherlock’s body touched his, a tiny flame lit there, burning out until his flesh was nothing but smoldering embers. Sherlock’s hand laced around John’s neck, fingers carding through the silvery blonde at the base of his neck; they swayed side to side, rocking on their feet. John stepped to the side and laughed aloud, in pure awe of Sherlock’s ability to predict his every movement. They faced opposite walls, and for every swing of a leg or folding of an arm, the other had a counter gesture that balanced it perfectly. John felt something break free in his chest; a bubble of elation, at the discovery of this man, the pulse of this fantastic song, knowing they had onlookers, being associated with him: Sherlock and Shezza alike, the look on Sherlock’s face in response to John feigning ignorance in the center of the dance circle, at his ability to let the fuck go and just
John waited, buried as far into his corner as he could. Fuck this. Fucking fuck this. He wasn’t an Army Doctor to get abducted, tortured and pissed on. He felt inclined to bitch that this was not, in fact, in the job description; he felt sick knowing Sherlock had lost sleep at night envisioning something like this.
Holmes rested his head against the window and closed his eyes. “How far?”
John hummed in agreement. “She is an incredible woman.”
“Oy, you! If you’re gonna insist on being sick, drag your sorry ass to the toilets! I just scrubbed this floor last night.” John followed her eyes to the poor sod sitting across the bar, head lolling around on his neck as though it were only attached by a ball and socket joint. He chuckled, breathing in the familiar smell of stale beer and cigarettes, and Collective Soul coming through the speakers. A calm settled into his bones and for the first time in nearly a month, he felt as though he had finally pulled his spirit back inside his body whilst simultaneously telling his mind to
“Why didn’t you say anything?! Molly! Take a picture! I’m twinning with John Watson. Literally. Like in every way. That is so weird, holy shit!” She gave John another thorough look, from top to bottom, and grinned.
I am wandering
Love at first sight was ridiculous. A childish concept and a shallow excuse for those who lust far more than they could ever love. But as John sat in that velvet lined seat, chin perched on his folded arms, tear tracks evident on his cheeks, he thought surely, though it was ridiculous and impossible, this was the closest he would ever come to it.
come home
“There’s something you all don’t know about Callum. Before Molly, there was someone else. A first wife, if you will.” The room was flooded with whispers and raised eyebrows, and Jane swatted him hard on the leg. Callum was covering his mouth, in a horrible attempt to stifle laughter and Molly looked appalled. “Don’t fret, really, the first wife was hardly worth mentioning; he reminds me of it all the time. Turns out the first wife just didn’t cut it: Something about being too childish, never being able to clean up their own messes, and never remembering to switch the towels over. Nothing worse than soured towels. Am I right?” Everyone stared wide-eyed and John chuckled to himself. “Before Molly came along, Callum was stuck with me, the first wife.” Fits of laughter erupted throughout the room, Jane’s eyes were wet with mirth, Molly’s father finally relaxed and Sherlock’s mouth was twisted into a quirk of a smile. “Apparently I make a shoddy companion; ladies, you have been warned. Callum Everett…” John plucked up the courage to look to his best mate, sitting at his left. Callum was beaming up at him, clearly already pleased. “You have saved my life, figuratively and literally, nearly a hundred times over.” He paused to still his raging heartbeat. “We have known each other our entire lives. We have overcome the most ridiculous of scrums, on the pitch and off, we have dated some truly atrocious women, we have developed bad habits and broken bad habits. We have cultivated an amazing team of men, we have pushed our way to victory at an International Cup, we have danced and drank far too much and we can barely remember the time when we were able to share our wardrobes. We have laughed, we have cried, we have fought, and we have endured a hell other people can only imagine in their dreams.” The room was silent now, and John was speaking directly to Callum. “I don’t deserve a best mate like you. In fact, I deserve little in comparison to the spectacular character you possess. You and I both know I would not be standing next to you, witnessing this incredible union, rambling like an idiot if it were not for your kindness, understanding, and unwavering loyalty.” John swallowed the lump of emotion lodged in his throat.
“Okay. That was intense.” Her eyes were huge as she looked to Sherlock across the table.

“He covered dinner. And opened the car door for me. And paid for my ticket. And bought me a large popcorn though I only wanted a medium. He also got me toffee apple stickers, which are my favorite. I don’t know if I’d mentioned that to him or not. And he’s so funny, John. Clever. Ian took movies so seriously; I could never ask him anything in the midst of one or he would get frustrated and mouthy.”
I love you, John, but I don’t think you have chewed all that through for yourself. So go ahead, use the desert as your excuse again. Climb back onto the fucking plane. Deny that this relationship we have created can actually exist. Walk away from the all the things normal people must endure, and leave others here to suffer on their own. Harriet, your father, me. The great, kind, generous, self-sacrificing John. 'Everyone is better off without me. I’m too ordinary and sensible to be worth anyone’s time.' More like too fucking thick to see what’s right in front of him.” Sherlock stepped down from the stage and headed to the door. Standing inside the frame, he turned to look at John, eyes broken and fierce. “You are so afraid. You are so afraid to love me. Christ, man the fuck up, Watson.”
John gasped, desperately trying to suck in air. Sherlock released John’s hand and lifted both of John’s arms up and back, wrapping them around Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock clutched at John’s forearms, his wrists, fingers moving against John’s sweating palms. Sherlock’s bowed lips, full and wet and hot, were kissing at the bones of his hand, his knuckles, tongue teasing between each pair of fingers. As the song’s intensity barely started to wane, Sherlock traced his hands down John’s arms, slowly, down his chest, teasing the waistband of his jeans, dipping, with terrifying intention, into the curve of each of John’s hipbones. John pressed the base of his skull deeper into Sherlock’s chest, trying to regain his composure, his breathing, anything to break the focus of Sherlock’s hands and their current location.
Sherlock remained silent, his heart moving the same as before, but John felt his hand press into his back, grounding him.
“Would you like me to attend the service with you?” It was a simple question, something several people might offer without actually intending to follow through. “Because you know I will.” Yes, she did know that.
“Yes, of course I thought there was a reason for it, John. One that was meant to deter me from seeing you in a condition you did not wish to be seen in. What you need to realize, and quickly, is that I am your ally, not your enemy. I am here to help you, not torment, judge, or criticize you.” Sherlock was brisk and sharp in delivery, no longer stammering or self-conscious. John nodded once in response, his lips pursed together in a thin line.
Sherlock gently toed off his trainers; his feet were hurting tonight…this morning? He glanced at his watch. 4:13 a.m. Holmes padded into the stainless, soulless, steel kitchen and put on a stainless, soulless kettle. While he waited for the water to boil, he stepped into the bathroom, just down the hall from the kitchen, running hot water out of the faucet. He sat on the edge, rolling up the ends of his tights, and dipped his toes into the hot, shallow water. They burned, blisters already forming on the balls of his feet. He grabbed a bar of soap and carefully washed. The kettle screamed as he was patting his feet dry.
"the detective must uncover the murderer by deduction from facts"
“No, no. Sherlock’s like this, insane creative genius. He owns the venue, but he also owns the dance company. And writes the music for every show.”
Sherlock stared and John cursed himself. Five drinks may have been too many for this early in the evening. The brunette’s lips parted, and then closed again. The air between them shifted and John could have sworn a magnetic field had developed, because hadn’t Sherlock just come closer?
“Search for Spock, huh? Didn’t take you as an Original Series fan. I thought Next Gen for certain, maybe Deep Space Nine.”
“No, this is not the building I normally spend my time in. The professors are idiotic enough to leave the doors unlocked. I come here after lecture to… vent, if you will.”
Sherlock woke in a cold sweat. He felt his eyes dilate to readjust to the darkness. That was one of his favorite uncontrollable responses to cocaine – feeling his eyes expand and soak up everything they could absorb. That’s what the drugs were for after all, another fine tune. One extra click, another measure, just one step above his typical genius. Once he had realized that was a possibility, to be even sharper than he is in a sober state, there was no going back. He was always on point; sometimes he just needed one tiny bump of help to stay there. Not to mention his career was so dull sometimes. Too easy, figuring out where the strangled woman in the hammock came from, why she’s dead. Criminal’s foxy wife, fooling around with men she ought not to. Hire an assassin, eliminate the loose ends, or hell, sometimes they’d kill them themselves. It was rare, in his line of work, for the criminals to stoop to the level of murder. Most of them detested getting their hands dirty. They didn’t make their money doing legwork. Neither did Mycroft. Sherlock scoffed. Precious, delicate, sentimental Mycroft.
“Are you two done now? I’m fuckin’ starved.” Callum whined from the living room.
have them.”
“Yes. Is that… is that not normal?”
. He looked up to find two parecetamol and a glass of water sitting on the bedside table. John stood, not trusting the medication as he knew he had been far too gone to even consider doing such a thing, and wobbled to the door.
It was damp and cold. Wind pushed through the broken panels of glass and brick, whistling and stirring rubbish across the floor. It felt like ages before John found Harry’s shoes with the flashlight. She was lying limp in the corner, wearing nothing but a tank top and jeans. “For fuck’s sake…” John lifted her face and her lips were too cool. Her color was off, her skin clammy to the touch. John took her pulse; it was running rampant. Watson tried to take a few steadying breaths to hold himself together, but it was proving to be difficult. Tears blurred his vision.
194 days.
God fucking damnit, Watson.
And then the song was over. John didn’t want to leave the curve of the inside of Sherlock’s hips, didn’t want to release the curls tightly wound in his short, callused fingers, didn’t want to watch that mouth walk out the door. The next bass-filled top hit came on, and John turned, giving Sherlock a strong push towards the toilets. The brunette smirked and John gave a devilish grin. John pushed him through the bathroom door and against the wall. Watson yanked at the man’s belt, and pressed into him, biting at his neck. He kissed Sherlock’s ear and breathed “John.” He watched with satisfaction as gooseflesh broke out across the taut skin of his arms. Someone pushed at the door, but didn’t linger long after understanding where this freight train was headed. Sherlock shoved John’s hands away and cornered him into a stall, slamming the flimsy door behind him. His hand was cradling the back of John’s head, and then his lips were burning fire into John’s. His tongue found entrance to John’s mouth and was tracing his lips, exploring the roof of his mouth… John gasped. Hands were under shirts and pulling at the buttons and zips of their trousers. John teased Sherlock through his pants, rubbing his hands across a magnificent erection. Watson felt his own pulse beneath the tension of his cotton pants. John watched in fascination as Sherlock fell to his knees and ran his tongue across John’s leaking hard on. “
“The flat.”
He slid his thumb underneath the seal of the white paper and pulled out a single sheet of stationery. The scrawl was nearly illegible, gorgeous, and totally unfamiliar.
Molly’s brown eyes rolled a bit and she let out a mildly frustrated laugh. “Is Katherine ready?” Her eyes were sparkling. John was always amazed by Molly Hooper, but tonight, by one thing in particular:  that Callum told Molly about every woman John dated and Molly remembered every single one, in spectacular detail. He supposed he could only blame her fantastic character. John realized he probably ought to take a few lessons from her. He could never remember who had a dog and who taught kindergarten. He mostly remembered their favorite recreational activities after sunset.
He just nodded, unable to bring himself to turn around and put those pale eyes to a gorgeous voice. He would be sick if it was who he believed it to be. But then again, why wouldn’t it be? Jane looked from him to the source of sound, and then back. Her eyes widened a fractional amount. “OH.”
“Mm?” The just-boiled water overflowed from the rim of the moose mug and gathered next to it on the counter. Sherlock walked into the kitchen and took the kettle from John’s hand, returning it to its eye. Immediately it whistled again. John hadn’t turned it off. Sherlock rubbed the back of his neck and narrowed his eyes.
“Yes, well…” he chuckled, “I suppose you’ve been a bit distracted.”
I am, too. SH
“Unbutton those. Don’t you dare take them off, just the button there.” The fastening was undone, and, by nature of the way Sherlock had his clothing tailored, it made no difference whatsoever in the positioning of the trousers.
As Sherlock started to stand, Jim jumped from the stage and leaned over the table, hovering over Sherlock. His head tilted to the side, and Sherlock was suddenly reminded of a snake, or a menacing arachnid, before devouring its prey. He stood, face close to Moriarty’s. Jim’s eyes were dead things, empty bundles of flesh inside their orbitals. Sherlock decided right then he hated him. John’s midnight eyes burned hot in sharp contrast on the back of Sherlock’s lids as he blinked, pushing in his chair.
“Yes, how are your kids?”
“Like we did for Harriet…”
“I know you meant it, John. I don’t think you’re trying to get me to bed.”
He grinned into the pillow, already keenly awaiting the image of Sherlock on stage. He had the entire day to wait, with no prior plans or engagements. John shoved down the covers and emerged from his nest of sheets and warm comforters. He ran a hand through his sleep mussed hair and went to the kettle, beaming every step of the way.
“I missed you as well, if we’re in the midst of making confessions.”
“Hmmm?”
“I’m sorry,” she murmured from underneath him, sprawled out on the sofa.
“There is nothing he isn’t good at, Jane. The man’s fucking lethal. Damn. He
“You tell me, Sherlock Holmes.”
John glanced at the card in his hand:
John wiped his brow, feeling them furrow deeper in frustration. The men waited, expectant, for John to make his next call. They were already an hour over designated end time, but the team knew better than to argue. A John this befuddled was a force to be reckoned with, and they wanted him at ease. Their match against the Broncos was only days away and something had to give; John had to loosen up or the boys needed to step up. They were willing do to their share if it meant John would just fucking relax.
SQUEEEEEE! I LOVE THIS CHAPTER!
“Would you like to know a secret of mine, John?” John was in love with the way Sherlock said his name so often, even in casual conversation.
Time passed, but the door finally opened. John knew only one man came to check on him at this time of night. He sat as still as he could. The filthy being approached, his eyes were dark and empty, and leaned close to John, running his fingers carefully down his back. He began to whisper in John’s ear; John never understood what he said, but this was the seventh evening this man had come to him and had John in some way or another. Watson focused on his breathing, trying not to react to the external stimuli. The fingers slipped under the waistband of John’s tattered pants, his hot, wretched breath poisoning his skin. John fought back the strong instinct to wretch. Finally, the opportunity arose. The man’s hand was reaching for John’s chin, to tilt him up and rape his mouth with his tongue. John, with the last, tiny bit of energy his body contained, crashed his skull against the other man’s head.
Sherlock stood at the end of the aisle, tall and dark and elegant. His neck was craned into the chin rest of his instrument, his wild curls more untamed than ever, a full-force grin taking his lips at the sight of John. Holmes suit was black, and around his neck was an eggplant bowtie. His eyes were a magnificent silver, sending out their own light source even from meters away. John clasped his hands in front of him and stared straight up, attempting his usual method of fighting off tears. He failed, and smiled at the insistent leaking of his eyes.
Not all who wander are lost
Molly climbed up onto the stage and sat next time him. “I’m here to listen, if you need someone to talk at.” She gingerly rested a hand on his shoulder. He leaned into her touch.
Sherlock swept two eggs onto a plate and looked at John. There was something new in his eyes that John couldn’t quite place. He couldn’t decide if it made him excited or nervous. Sherlock returned the pan to the stove and placed a hand on the side of John’s face, thumb stroking his stubble. “You’re gorgeous in the morning.”
“Everything alright there, Watson? You seem… tense. I know it’s been difficult, transitioning from Eccleston, but honestly, it’s just a show...”
Sherlock tried to ignore the nagging curiosity that was yanking unashamedly at his brain stem.
Callum weaseled in at the weakness. “Okay, let’s make a wager. London Broncos are playing against the Bulls this Saturday. If the Broncos win, you’re off. If Bradford wins, you have to come with us.”*
Sherlock’s eyes widened a bit, as if being caught in the act of doing something most people disapproved of. “I did.”
John nodded, chuckled and let the rowdy men inside. All the boys knocked the snow off their boots on the stairs, slid them off in a neat line by the door and carried their drinks into the kitchen. It was evenings like this one that John was amazed he could fit nearly twenty-four bodies in one place. He plugged up his iPod to the surround sound and let some early Radiohead float from the speakers. He needed to be centered for this, needed to be grounded.
She stepped away and took a sip of her wine, a shoulder facing him. A defense mechanism. B returned to the stove and checked the chicken, taste tested the green beans. He slid a loaf of French bread from its brown paper sleeve and took a serrated knife to it. Her voice barely rose above the crunching of the crust being sliced.
John grinned stupidly. “Yeah. Yeah, I guess I should.”
John’s eyebrows knitted together in confusion.
Sherlock gently placed his violin back into its case, clicking it shut away from the snow. He then tugged the collar of his Belstaff tighter around his scarf and suit, and turned his attention back to the ceremony.
“Okay. Don’t laugh. Just. Shut up and listen.”
“You… proposing…” John barely managed between gasps of air. “What would that… even be like?” Tears were rolling from his cheeks, his face completely pink, eyes squinting and happy.
“You will be the death of me, Sherlock. I swear to god. You can’t waltz around pretending you can escape everything!”
Sooooo, a LITTLE more John
“Irene Adler.” Molly whispered into his ear. He could hear the laughter Molly was biting back. She knew John found Irene attractive, but then, John thought, Molly probably knew quite a few, if not most people, found Irene Adler attractive. “She’s not the most humble of women.” John could tell. And he wouldn’t mind testing that hypothesis.
John shrugged and gave a quiet chuckle. “Of course. He may be my best mate, but we are competitive as hell. We both have to be just as good as the other at anything and everything.”
John woke with a start, a thin sheen of sweat on his forehead. He gazed around, confused at where he was. He was in a hospital, obviously, but it wasn’t his hospital on base. It looked so familiar… How did he…?
John leaned against the wooden frame of the bedroom door and admired him. It was early, eight something or other, and they had returned to the flat in the obscene hours of morning. Their cases had been consistent, demanding and quite a few of them incredibly dangerous. Last night, John had been certain they both were going up in an explosion of cement, fire and chlorine. It had been pure misery, watching Sherlock’s face twist in panic, watching him as he desperately tried to smother it with indifference. It was a dead giveaway to Moriarty: they were each others ultimate weakness. If either of them needed to be taken down, simply target the other and whatever you desire will become yours.
“That is what I said, John. Do pay closer attention. You know I hate having to repeat myself.”
Sherlock had woken with a start, hearing some talking coming from Rosie's room. Curiosity getting the better of him he made his way there, his footsteps only increasing in speed when he realised she was crying and screaming in her sleep. He opened her door to find her sleeping, but gripping at her bed sheets. The normally quiet child was screaming out for help, before she began to sob, choking on her tears. Atlas soon came in after hearing Sherlock moving.
"No your not," Sherlock reassured. "I promise you-" He paused. "Atlas, look at me." He clamped his hands either side of her face. "You are not her. Your my baby. My little girl and you are
She slept for ages, head back on the pillow. Doped up on a huge amount of pain medication, she was out to the world, her collar bone covered. Sherlock's hand brushed her temple gently, removing some stray hairs.
"Dad?" Atlas asked quietly as she lay down and he pulled the covers over her, tucked them over her shoulders and sat down on the bed.
"I miss her." John said into Sherlock's shoulder.
"Never," Sherlock smiled as she looked up at him before kissing his cheek and resting her head back down on his shoulder. "You know, your technically my miracle baby. One of the earliest born babies I have ever known. Maybe
Sammy looked at his lap as Sherlock removed his hands.
"Can we go to...um..." Atlas said. "Umm...the graveyard?"
"No," Sammy said quickly.
"Yeah. That's the biggest problem."
"Hello. Hello." Wanda said as she hustled down the path in the direction of Sherlock. She cupped her sons face as he tried to push her hands away, but she wouldn't take it. "Oh Sherlock you look tired."
"Yeah, well maybe there's a reason," Sherlock said, raising his voice a little bit.
"There," Rosie said pointing to Atlas' stomach. "There." She pointed to the back of her head, a hand around it. "I don't know any other except for...this one." Rosie said before clamping her hands around Atlas' waist and giving her a hug. "The big scary one on your back."
"How long till the electricity is back?" Atlas said quietly.
"Soon Atlas, but not yet. Your still unwell. Your temp keeps spiking and every three or so days you require an oxygen mask." Dr Aduba frowned, Atlas looked to her lap.
"Woah." Sammy said before Atlas saw her uncle coming out of the library and to the centre room.
"My sister," Sherlock smiled as he looked at John and back at the other side of the table.
"Just come to the roof with me." He said before taking her hand and leading her up some stone paths and wooden planks. She noticed how he knew which ones were the safe ones to tread upon as they made their way up through the building. It smelt old, dusty and worn as they made their way up. He led her through some doors and up onto the roof.
"You can tell John your staying over at mine or something." Hale offered before she looked around them. "It'll be nice, non-alcoholic."
Nearing the checkout, Atlas went through to fill up the bags as Rosie and John loaded up the conveyor. Atlas then began to pack so fast that the person working at the till had to work incredibly fast to get everything through. Atlas still had time I between to spare.
"Good, because you've promised to marry me." Sherlock smirked, before kissing John. It lasted a few seconds, a contempt moment of realisation and conversation that said
"Alright. Budge up. Both of you." John said and Sherlock helped Atlas move over. It was a squeeze, but thanks to two very tall, very skinny people the three of them fit onto the bed and Sherlock changed over to an episode of Doctor Who.
"And you must be the famous blogger, Dr Watson-Holmes, congratulations on the marriage by the way," Gordon smiled as he shook John's hand.
"Together."
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
NEW Year's Eve had been nice and peaceful, John and Sherlock had had an important chat and Mrs Hudson had joined them to count the New Year in.
"My secret," Sherlock whispered with a smile before kissing John's lips twice before lying down on his husband's stomach. "Promise no walking away?"
"You guys are like...the best." Atlas laughed as she looked at John. "I thought I was going to turn up and be turned away right there before I could cross the threshold." John sighed before they exchanged a proper hug. His grey hair was combed and gelled the way he liked it - or rather the way everyone else liked it.
"I've got you," John whispered. He knows she can't hear him but if anything he's the one who needs to hear it, to say it. He's terrified, in truth. He's absolutely shitting himself. This isn't a comfortable way to live, it's painful but she's his baby. "I've got you."
"Hmmm." John smiled as he came over. "Tonight is homemade pizza."
"Morning dad." Atlas said, her father turning round and looking at her then straight at the boy.
"The maximum we're allowed," John sighed rubbing his eyes.
"If I'm really, really lucky. But probably not." Sammy frowned before Rosie leant in for another hug.
"There you go!" Atlas exclaimed laughing before Mycroft got the hint and reluctantly pulled on his dark blue one. Then they started their food.
"I know this sounds like a stupid question." John said. "Are you alright? I'm not asking about physically, I'm talking about up here." He said tapping his temple with his index finger.
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
Once outside, his legs ran and ran and ran and ran until he felt like his lungs were about to burst. He ran until all he could hear in his ears was the rhythmic tap of his feet hitting the pavement. His heart rate was through the roof and he couldn't see for tears as he kept running and running and
•▪︎•▪︎•▪︎•
"Your name is actually William?" Atlas asked in disbelief, laughing as she thought about calling Sherlock, William instead. "Sherlock's a girl's name anyway."
It was all so real, except for that. She could hear John but he was...he shouldn't be there, he'll get hurt.
"But-"
"But I don't. I look like you. I looked like you when I was seven years old." Atlas announced her heart pounding loudly in her ears. Did this mean that Sherlock was admitting it? Saying it was true?
"Our children are all so brave," John said with a smile as Sammy looked over with a grin.
"I do," John nodded quietly as he looked at Dr Aduba.
"Thank you," Eurus smiled before she beckoned Mycroft over. "Can you look after it?"
"How the hell do you know that William Sherlock Scott Holmes?" Mycroft said using Sherlock's full name because he knew how much he hated it.
"I know. But whatever it is, we'll be here for you. And I'm speaking for Sherlock because he
"Oh, love," He whispered as he held her head still, unconcious. Tears in his eyes as he kissed her hair over and over again.
So was Sherlock though.
"No." He replied quietly. "Let her stay."
"Are your hands sore, Ida?" Mycroft asked as he worked on her palm.
"I love you." John repeated, but by then Atlas had already fallen asleep against his chest.
"It's fine, dad. Don't worry about not being there, please. I get it." Atlas said looking at him, before nodding in confirmation. "In all honesty, I just wanted to be with you." He looked at her kindly, as she smiled. "Although..." She began but slowly began to stop herself, he looked at her, his eyebrows furrowing further.
"That and the universities are unlikely to take you until your 18. Seeing as we managed to negotiate you getting into college a year earlier because of your previous attainments. So you'll most likely have a gap year." Sherlock said.
"White coat?"
- then we'll fail together. And then we'll fix it together." Sherlock said, continuing to rub John's chest. "Okay?"
"Okay," Sherlock said as he came and kneeled, Sammy turning up in the doorway.
Across from her Sherlock smirked, as John sighed and sat in the seat Atlas normally did.
Sherlock turned his face away. The brakes of the train squealed to a halt. John witnessed one, solitary tear fall to Sherlock’s cheek. Acting on instinct, he took his thumb and gently wiped it away. He then tucked two wild curls behind Sherlock’s ear. It felt like home, to touch him. “Sentiment. It’s a bitch, isn’t it?”
“Hullo, Sherlock! Glad you could make it out.” Mike grinned, and after finding his footing again, walked inside the pub.
“That, my darling, I will not argue with.” The glasses clinked together, and they drank.
Sherlock leaned back on his heels and wrapped a hand around his now mauve cock. His head fell back as the pleasure rippled through him. He whimpered, dangerously aroused at the thought of John watching so intently.
“We should not have made a booze run after dinner. We’re never going to get a damn thing done.”
“Quite nice is nothing. I know that much.” John took the first crunch of his sandwich. An oregano covered cucumber slipped from between the bread and plopped onto the wax paper. He raised his eyebrows at Jane expectantly.
“So nervous you wouldn’t-”
“Don’t make me into a hero, John.”
“Why aren’t you as happy as I am?” Sherlock slipped between the barstool and John’s thigh. “Hmmm?”
, the most important thing he would ever do, and he would be damned if tears would muck it up.
il·lu·mi·nate
Sherlock walked through the door, sliding a wet hand through his frizzed, curly hair. He headed toward the closet, unbuttoning his cuff sleeves when his eyes found John. His left eyebrow inched upwards, and a smirk spread across his clever, pouty mouth. John squared his shoulders from his sitting position on the bed and raised his chin a bit, and after blowing Sherlock a flirtatious and over-exaggerated kiss, moved his hands to rest behind his head. John watched as Sherlock’s eyes scanned his body until they came to rest between his legs. They were no strangers to admiring each other, from a distance or up close, and they had become fantastic at stripping one another down to the skin with their eyes alone. Sherlock continued to unbutton his sleeves, eyes unmoving from John’s, and once those were free, he’d turned his attention to the line of them running down his front. John gave a cheeky smile as Sherlock paused at the third button to come undone, fingers moving agonizingly slow. He instead turned his attention to the black leather belt laced through the loops of his trousers, unbuckling it slowly and smoothly. John caught on and sat up straighter against the pillows, his right hand now cupping the erection pressing against his green cotton pants. “Ah. Going to put on a performance for me, then?” he asked, his voice quiet and murky in the silence of the bedroom. The only other sound was Sherlock’s belt sliding out from under the restraint of each loop.
She rolled her eyes and smirked. “Yeah, I noticed.” B popped a fresh green bean in his mouth and she watched his jaw tighten as he poured the remainder of them into the pot on the stove. “I love that you cook,” she said quietly.
John erupted into another fit of laughter as he walked up and wrapped himself around Sherlock's waist, taking care to avoid the chunks of glass. The detective wilted at the touch.
"Hello," John said as he wrapped his arms tight around her shoulders. Jane laced her arms around his middle and held him there. They rocked back and forth in a long embrace. He let her go and cupped her face in his hands. John's eyes were already red rimmed, and a small, embarrassed smile took over his mouth. "I'm sorry," he murmured quietly in the crowd.
Sherlock smirked and removed the dark cherry violin from the crook between his chin and shoulder. “Yes. Most weeks. Five out of the seven we have known each other,” he offered casually.
“Those symptoms have faded significantly.”
“I’m enjoying you.” John hummed. Sherlock felt his face grow hot. John chuckled. “I love watching you blush. You always seem so surprised by it.”
“Will all your items fit cleanly in one bag?”
Molly grinned and nodded. “Yes, she’s quite lovely. Very kind, and an attentive listener. She isn’t as quick a learner as I would have hoped, but she is making up for it in effort.”
"they have done all they can to unearth the truth"
I am wandering.
A soft whimper left the back of John’s throat. Sherlock hummed in response, earning him the gorgeous sight of John opening his heavy eyes to look at him. He ran a hand through Sherlock’s drying hair, and Sherlock felt emotion, heavy and thick, fall like a blanket around them both. John blinked, appreciation and surprise swimming in his eyes.
“Thank you. I’m fine. John’s fine.”
“John! Hi! Please, come in!” She waved him into her classroom. Jane took off the lanyard of keys from her neck and gave him a squeeze.
“You could not have known, John, nor could you have prevented it. We were not firing on all pistons that evening, obviously. Don’t apologize. Miscommunication is a common issue amongst couples.”
“Starved. Aren’t you going to eat?”
John stirred under the covers and reached absently for Sherlock, only to find he was no longer there. John blinked, and then heard it.
No. Even doctors can be worthless fuck ups.
Jane unlaced her Chucks and curled up on the couch, pulling out her newest skein of yarn and a crochet hook. She heard Band of Horses come on through the soundbar and turned to find Molly standing in the kitchen, remote in hand. They were one of her favorite groups, especially when she was a bit down and out. Molly knew this, of course, because they were one of her favorites, too. Jane mentally noted she was the absolute luckiest, even after a shit day.  “Love you, Mols.”
John stood amongst a small crowd of people, chatting easily. Graham was a nice guy, and John found it amusing that Sherlock was not the only posh man to have such daring recreational activities. He took a sip of his stout and glanced around, soaking up the movement in the warehouse. There were about just as many women as men, and John had seen a few of them dance. They were good. Very good. The song changed and John felt someone at his right flank, chest pressing into his shoulder, a hand skimming the bicep of his left arm. He was gently being turned and John grinned up at Sherlock.
Callum put his feet back to the floor, slowly getting up from his seat and strolling toward the aisle. “That never gets old, by the way.”
“Just nice to not be the only observer in a room for once.”
He plucked a small snail from its home on the rock and held it in his palm. Sherlock watched the creature, waiting for the moment it was calm enough to move again.
John slipped his practice bag over his shoulder and arranged the strap across his chest. He made for the door, grabbing his helmet and keys on the way out. It was still the color of midnight on the steps of his apartment, the lampposts casting eerie shadows along the sidewalk. He mounted his Triumph, giving a strong kick to the start and buckled his helmet at the chin strap. The bike idled with a low growl before she roared to life as John gripped the accelerator. His chest dipped to meet the handle bars as he veered out into the street.
A Battement en Rond is one of the most difficult ballet moves to master. It's also completely gorgeous: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n7AaZhEOJSY
“Do you mind if I practice, too?” Irene asked. Molly’s eyebrows raised up on her forehead, confused. Did Irene ask anyone's permission for anything?
“I’m sorry. I had that dinner at the orphanage tonight. Remember?” A light wash of guilt flooded her, but not enough to steal away the bitterness.
“Yes, of course. Let me make sure she’s still decent.” Jane disappeared behind the door.
Sherlock stood in the living room of John’s flat, towel wrapped around his waist. Water was beading from his hair down his chest and he felt his skin break out in gooseflesh.
“Spoilers.” Sherlock winked. “Think the fortune means you?”
John rested his forehead against Sherlock’s thigh, steadying his breathing. He giggled after a moment, realizing the absolute absurdity of the situation. He looked up at Sherlock from his knees. The brunette’s eyes were glinting deviantly, the right side of his mouth pulled up at the corner.
"Do you think you could do me and your dad a big favour and take Red out?" John asked as he gave Rosie the bowl of fruit he had cut up. She thanked him before going over to Sherlock and crawling into his lap. It was a normal occurrence for the five year old to have a large helping of fruit, crawl into Sherlock's lap and force him to eat it too. That's why John always made sure to cut up a lot, to force his partner to eat.
A love between two fathers.
"When I was in Edinburgh I had a friend who had lived in Aberdeen who told me." Atlas explained.
She looked up, a lone tear falling from John's closed eyes.
"Alright?" John asked as Sherlock shook his head and looked back up at John with those eyes and they were all the older man needed. "Oh Sherlock."
Sherlock had had a nightmare and it had been rough. Really, really rough. John had led him down the stairs and sat him down on the sofa, Atlas still concealing the sounds she was making. When she saw him, she frowned, he hadn't seen her and he looked into the sink.
Sitting on the verge, Peter waited...and waited until in the distance he could see a black land rover. And it was slowing down.
IT was around 11:50am when the group arrived at Timothy and Wanda's beating Mycroft, Mrs Hudson and the dog. Sherlock smirked upon seeing that they were indeed first and when his laughing became rather hysterical everyone made it their cue to depart the car.
"I can't help it, I just don't understand," Sherlock said back.
"Go on."
"Atlas?" A voice asked and the teens head shot up unbelievably fast.
"Or it's just random but she could be about to head into a full seizure," John frowned. "Her body has been out through a lot today, not to mention her head. And she's obviously not slept, so tommorow could be another day of difficult. But we'll do it."
"Charming affection." The voice said. "Maybe I'll kill her so I can watch it again." There was a brief pause - most likely for dramatic affect but John just found it annoying. "Or maybe I'll wait and see if you can get to her in time." Just as the last words were released the wall slid to reveal what must be about a hundred fake graves. John sighed before kicking the wall to his left. Then he went in search of Atlas.
"I'm glad you think so, Dr Watson-Holmes," Sherlock said before they shared a kiss. "I love you."
"The car park at Frobishers," Atlas replied before they exchanged a goodbye and he hung up.
"Well, the chat we had was good and I think we've agreed...finally...that we love each other and that we forgive and...what was it she said?" Sherlock said between brushes of his teeth. "Oh yeah, forget. I don't know. Anyway...John? John!?"
"The police."
"I am." Atlas protested quietly. "I promise I am."
"We can't protect her." John sighed, a hand running over his mouth. "And that's the impossibly difficult fact."
"Come on. Let's put you back to bed." John smiled picking Rosie up and taking her to her bedroom. Lying her down on the bed she nestled in, looked at him expectantly before he tucked her in. "Go back to sleep Rosie. Grandma and Grandad should be here tommorow afternoon."
"Sammy?" John asked suddenly, the boy's head still peering over him.
Sherlock nodded to that.
"I don't have a daughter!" Sherlock shouted.
Sherlock assumed his position next to Atlas. "That has to be the fastest he has realised something." Atlas looked up at him smiling as he gave her a smirk in return. "I know what your doing by the way." Sherlock added causing Atlas to give him a quizzical look.
Atlas shook her head laughing. "No, I don't believe we are Papa. At least, I don't think we are. Imagine dad's his several time great grandson or something. That would be funny. A mass murderer and fighters of mass murderer's in the same family."
"I've been making...concoctions." Atlas admitted.
Nearing a tree Sherlock stopped, causing John to turn around and look at him.
DR FIONA HARPER:
"What have you done?" John said sighing as he looked directly at Sherlock.
"Are you okay?" Rosie asked quietly, scuffing her foot against the wooden floor.
"Yeah." Sherlock smiled before getting into his phone with a thumbprint before pulling up his games. However, he turned down the brightness and checked his volume was down. "You pick." He said, handing his phone over.
"Harry," John said suddenly. "Take Sherlock into the living room."
"Money. We're millionaires in Dubai, in fact we probably all are and work. My mum's PR work is pulling her over and my dad has found a position as a crisis doctor in Iraq and will split his time." Aba sighed.
"I don't know what your talking about." Sherlock said looking dead ahead, Atlas doing the same. Until, not even a moment later, Atlas looked to him and they began to snigger before it evolved into a laughter.
"I don't see why not," He smiled before putting a hand to her hair.
"I can lip read!" Rosie exclaimed her little face lighting up in excitement. "I've been practicing."
"You think?"
"I miss you guys," Atlas said with a frown. "Don't get me wrong, I like the people here and I like Jo and Harry and Isla and Peter but...there's not that ease. It's like they're treading on egg shells, like they're still trying to figure me and dad out and to a degree Sam and then even more, papa and Ro. Its not very comfortable."
"Atlas." Sherlock said just as Atlas was about to leave the big, open living area.
John let out a little sob.
"What are you up to?" John asked quizically as he tried his best to cast his mind back to anything Atlas may have mentioned.
Lestrade sighed. "We need Sherlock's help."
ATLAS looked in her schoolbag and frowned. She hadn't packed her lunch. Gently, Sammy nudged her and she looked up with wide eyes.
"I know," John said gently. "We'll sort it."
"Happy Birthday my dear Watson." Sherlock said as she let go of Atlas' legs and went into his embrace. Giggling as he lifted her up and she rested her head on his shoulder. John hugged Atlas into his side as she wrapped an arm around Sherlock's side. As they were stood in the window they appeared like silhouettes to the rest of the family who took photos. It was rather endearing.
"Can you promise not to do it again?" Rosie asked quietly, teeth sucking her bottom lip.
"I know. But when I woke up I remembered the bus driver I had at one of my Foster homes and then I remembered reading about him in the news last year and learning he was a rapist and my head did what it does best and it got carried away and I..."
please, can I be erased?
John hopped off the train, his eyes searching the flood of humans at the station. It took hardly any time at all to find him; that stupid coat was a dead giveaway. John grinned, hopped off the last stair of the car, and walked to him. His duffel was slung over his shoulder. He stood tall in his uniform. Sherlock’s mouth turned into a mocking smirk, and he clicked his heels and snapped a salute to his forehead. “Welcome home, Lieutenant Watson.” John punched him solidly in the left shoulder.
John was in a dark grey suit, nearly charcoal in color, with a pale blue button up underneath. It clung to him the same way Sherlock’s clothes did. He shuffled uncomfortably.
The tent rustled as a desert breeze pushed its way through. The nights were cold in Kandahar. He pulled his coat on, careful of the wrappings that covered the majority of both his arms, and stepped out barefoot into the sand. Soon they would be moved to a proper facility, but until then, it was tent living. Sherlock loathed it. He was not meant to crawl in and out of canvas, to sweat on a cot or drink unpurified water. But some nights, like this one, he didn’t mind it as much. He rolled up the hem of his slacks and buried his feet deep into the still warm sand. His hands found his pockets and he looked up. The clear nights in the Afghanistan desert were some of the most beautiful things he’d ever seen. He’d never admit that to another soul, that he found beauty in the nighttime. The moon was waning, still almost at the halfway mark. It had just begun to curve.
Jane laughed and set her can down on a coaster.
“Gladly.”
Because that’s what you do when you love someone. Right? You let everything in.
hamishh
“John. Don’t be like that.”
“I’m afraid, John. It’s been nearly four months. Is that enough time?”
During John and Jane's speeches:
“What… what is this? What is happening here, exactly?” He felt Sherlock pull closer to his side, squeeze a little tighter around his chest, and it was then he noticed irregularities in the breathing beside him. Sherlock was just as mucked up as he was. For some reason, this struck a chord with John. It reverberated, causing a rather bold feeling to surface. “I’m not saying I don’t like it. That would be the worst lie I’ve ever told…”
I am enough.
The beeping of life machines was a sick addition. John was dead and didn’t need God’s morbid sense of humor trying to convince him otherwise.
Mmm. That was an interesting thought. Sherlock considered this for a moment, knowing it was not what John was asking, but may indeed be a subconscious thought. “They’re fine, John, thank you. You’ve done a nice job keeping up with them.”
“I mean, I was Callum’s first wife. But let’s be honest, Molly’s so much better.” The group chuckled. John could feel Jane’s eyes studying the side of his face and tried to dismiss it.
“Four hours is manageable, I suppose. Have you seen the base yet?”
But what if I am lost?
“Okay. So what are your colors again?”
John looked up at Sherlock, a hurt expression in his eyes. Sherlock was grinning. He popped open a lager and handed it to John. “You make it through basic and within hours of arriving home, I wound you. Man up, Watson.”
Mother. Fucker.
“Alright, Everett. What is it?”
“Sherlock’s Night Out, a tale narrated by John Watson.” The blonde gave a gentle laugh and winked at the man across from him.
to the water that has seen it all
“Sorry, I’m a bit early, but I’ve brought sustenance.” He waved a bag of sub sandwiches awkwardly, and tossed her a cold, bottled coffee drink. Hazelnut.
“Sherlock?”
“The window.”
“Ms. Jesep, there’s someone at the door!”
XoX, hamishh
The man leaned close to Sherlock’s ear and began to whisper something into it, making Sherlock grin and duck his chin closer to his chest. John clenched and unclenched his left fist, prepared for the left hook, should the opportunity arise. They were on a case, after all, John justified.
signed his name, only his initials. Like a magnetic field, John felt himself suddenly being pulled to the sleeping man’s side. He knelt next to him and lifted one hand to brush the cropped curls from his brow.
freaks.
"It sure is," Sam smiled. "Its truly wonderful."
"Hello?" Atlas asked as the other side of the line was quiet.
"Ugh, Jem!" She scolded. "What have I told you?" She picked her up and flounced away as Sherlock pulled open the door with a smile.
"Sammy, you come and sit here next to Jo," Harry ordered. "I'll go get some blankets." She disappeared.
Redbeard wagged his tail as Rosie sat back down next to him to draw another picture. When she finished that one she gave it to John leaning against his knee, smiling up at him.
"Because I don't want them to think they have to sit with me. 'Cause I don't want them to." Atlas said. "I don't want them to waste their time on me."
"Can't what?" Sherlock asked.
Next chapter is last in this book.
"Where's papa?" She asked looking at him.
"In forty five minutes!" John shouted before Atlas flashed a smiled back at them. Before he looked back to where his youngest daughter was being lifted up by his fiance. Eurus was sat off to the side, pen in hand with a little notebook - from here he could tell she was sketching. Mycroft sat next to his mother on a bench near where John was sat with Timothy.
"No, well, yes, to an effect, but it's a flashback," John said before Dr Khris nodded and left.
Sherlock removed his coat and his blazer and put a shirted arm onto the pillow above Atlas' head as she turned onto her side. Then, with gentle fingers in her hair, she wriggled to the edge of the bed and reached out a hand to take John's.
"Was it okay?" Atlas asked John as she approached him.
Gunshot wounds.
There is an idea in here I got off Instagram so creds to whoever came up with it because I can't remember who.
I don't hate Mary. I really like her. It's just that I feel the marriage between John and Mary was sort of for all the wrong reasons.
"What?" Sherlock asked getting to his feet suddenly.
"That box is supposed to help you remember," Sherlock smiled as she came back over with a glass of water and stuck a tongue out at him.
"Have I...I don't understand...John...please, I don't understand." Sherlock said sitting on the end of the bed seat. Running his hands over his face and breathing into them.
"Atlas?" Greg questioned, weaving his way over to the police tape. Around her, people crowded, a mother screamed and Atlas looked over. A small human body lay, covered by a blue blanket, another larger one to the left. Child. Adult. Or near enough. "What're you doing here? I was just about to call your father and John."
"It's a seizure," John frowned.
"Yes. On the eve of one of our birthdays we sit together to...well..." John said as Atlas leaned against Sherlock's shoulder, looking at the photo he had just tried to show her. "Talk, mostly."
SATURDAY morning brought a similar set of a affairs as the previous two, with Atlas, Rosie, Sherlock and John sharing morning's with Harriet and Josephine. It was not bad, but it was not something they were becoming easily accustomed to. Harry, it turned out, had a sense of humour that neither Atlas nor Sherlock could understand but one that sent John into a fit of laughter before his face would fall. Neither Atlas nor Sherlock liked that. They didn't want John to feel bad about laughing, just because they couldn't understand why he was laughing to begin with.
"Ah, I saw that, plane crash," Damien said as Atlas mumbled a reply, closing her eyes against John.
"I can fix the cut," Damien said with a smile. "But she'll want her dads, both of them."
"Yep," Sherlock whispered, clutching John's arm harder.
form of school work." John said, closing it again and taking the laptop from her and putting it back over on the coffee table. "I'll help you with that essay you were doing on Pieper. I think I have a documentary on it with the original footage on it. We can look at it on the weekend?"
"Alright. I'll say my piece and then I'll get out." Atlas said rising to her feet, looking John dead in the eye. His face was frowning, but she could see that his eyes contained something akin to pride and happiness. "The appendix has been revealed in recent studies - as recent as 2017 - to have evolved over 30 separate times, over a variety of mammals. They also found it never disappears once it has appeared in a lineage. This particular study was carried out by Heather F. Smith Ph. D and she studied in depth a variety of variables that could contribute to the appearance of an appendix or without one. The results of this allowed them to disband previous hypotheses but it also brought them to some answers. They found that within species that contained an appendix there are higher concentrations of Lymphoid - also known as immune - tissue found within the cecum - the bit the appendix is actually attached to. This led them to believe it was a secondary immune organ and was important for housing beneficial gut bacteria like I said. Also different shapes of cecum has been found to partially contribute to whether an animal is found to have one. They suggest that the appendix does not evolve alone but instead with the cecum as a "cecoappendicular complex."" She took a breath, eyes watching her. Classmates watching her. John watching her.
