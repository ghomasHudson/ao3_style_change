Sherlock interrupts him. “There’s a decon shower next to Artefact Storage and a kitchenette in the lounge. Take this in case you need anything else,” and he tosses a bank card at John, who automatically catches it.
how long I’ve been looking for a chink in that bespoke armor? And then you just…fall from the bloody
"Er, hello," he says to the heavyset man sitting there. He suddenly realises he had no idea what to say next. “I’m…here to tell someone…something."
“Yes. It’s funny, when I think about it now, but I was so knackered at the time that my first thought after the initial shock wore off was that if everyone else had fucked off to Dimension X, I was going to have a bit of a lie-down.”
“No!” Sherlock blurts.
“I—” is Sherlock
“Her name was Irene,” the Spiral offers. “I suppose mine is too, in a way. You can call me that, if it’s easier for you.”
The man purses his jowls. "I'm sorry?"
"Well, she's nice and seems like a hard worker. And she fancies you, that's clear enough."
John had said he was going to pick up Indian. He still isn’t used to walking long distances, so he’d likely been headed that way at this point in his walk. Sherlock pulls out his phone, brings up a list of nearby restaurants.
He doesn’t know if wanting a sounding board
With an effort, he closes the channel of abundant and unbidden information. John had said

“You’re—you’re not wrong,” Sherlock says at last, a bit hoarsely. “And you notice more than I gave you credit for.”

John can feel his face grow warm and is grateful for the darkness. “I—you said you didn’t sleep, much. But you were there, in my dream. Does that mean—”
She lifts the desk phone and punched in a number. "Hi hi!" she says brightly. "It's Molly. I—yes. Yes, that's right. I'll bring him down."
“And you started out asking so nicely, too,” John sighs. “I’m fine for awhile yet, but did you say there was a kettle down here?”
The bars that had jumped in response to Molly's voice are still and flat as he speaks. When he pauses the recording and scrolls back to give it a listen, there’s nothing there but the sound of faint static.
“Probably not.”
It’s not the Stranger, he doesn’t think - he hasn’t seen another soul, human or not. But these empty streets aren’t the same as the Lonely's isolation, either. The empty military base he’d wandered through had been deserted but familiar. Not like this maze.

to be shared. But as long as it's inside of me, it can't hurt anyone else.” He huffs a humourless laugh. "A soldier until the very end, apparently."
His reserve cracks at last and now he does break into a run. The lights of evening traffic judder madly up and down before his eyes as he pounds down the street, tracing an ex-army doctor’s aimless meanderings.
"In fact,” he realises as a few more pieces fall into place, “I bet you go out of your way

This room is bigger than the statement room, and far stranger. There are the expected books and files, of course, but there are also several Petri dishes of mold in various stages of outgrowing their homes, and a cow skull on the wall, and a stack of envelopes tacked to a shelf with an ornate knife. Was that a real human skull next to it?
“Erm, yes? That’s…true?” John ignores Sherlock’s noise of derision. “Well, suit yourself. I’ll just run down to a cafe and grab something. Er, have you seen my wallet?”
He looks over on instinct, and there Sherlock stands in the shadow of a nearby building. His hands are in his coat pockets, his collar turned up. He looks unhappy. John starts towards him. “Sherlock, what the

This time, there are no dreams.
Sherlock, who’s nothing
He might not be able to See where John is now, but his basic understanding of the man and the blurred images that drip into his head like errant raindrops guide him along the path that John took earlier that evening. It’s full dark by now and the shadows between the streetlamps seem darker than usual.
A pretty brunette is sitting next to John with her arm casually draped over the back of the bench behind him. It's an intimate position and Sherlock feels a stab of jealous possessiveness that's only placated by John's obvious discomfort.

“You could have called. The Institute’s in the phone book.”
He’s uncomfortably close to Sherlock by now, deliberately invading his personal space. The height difference doesn’t seem to faze him at all. He looks up at Sherlock and smirks. “So, my clever friend, can you guess why you’re here? Why I’ve arranged this little

This, of course, is when another shop door opens and a wild-eyed Sherlock stumbles through. He looks around frantically and when he spots John, his face does something that makes John’s heart twist in his chest. He looks

about his body.
“—Isn’t the kind you’ve heard before." John looks to the window, to the rainy world beyond, tries once again to find the right words.

mad, and afraid, and
“Fine,” Sherlock spits with exasperation, but John thinks he secretly looks a bit pleased.
Sherlock glares down at the shorter man—Jim. He won’t give this madman the satisfaction of backing away. “You’re an agent of the Web,” he bites out. “Whatever you want, it’s important enough that you’ve enlisted the help of another entitity. From the look of this place, likely the Spiral.” He glances over to the woman sitting on the bench next to John. She wiggles the fingers of her free hand at him in a casual wave.
John smirks. “Exactly. And there’s that thing
John briefly conducts an internal inventory. “Well, when I was overseas, I always had patients to be getting back to. Not sure that’s what you’re looking for, though.” He pauses. “If I’m being honest with myself, it’s probably something like sheer bloodymindedness. Anything tries to drive me insane or get me to go gentle into that good night, I tell it to sod off.”

Shelock glances at the CCTV overhead. “Let’s head down to the Archive. More secure, more comfortable. Less Mycroft.” He heads towards the lift and John follows, reveling in the newfound ease of doing so.
“I’ll see if we have anything suitable in Artefact Storage.”
“I—” Sherlock looks satisfyingly like a landed fish at this point.

John can almost see Sherlock retreating back into his shell. “Of course,” he says stiffly. “This way.” He stands, neglecting to extend a helping hand this go round.
“Wasn’t planning on calling you anything,” John says shortly.
“Oh, take your timeline and piss off.” Sherlock looks past his brother’s shoulder, sees John standing in the storage room doorway. “You’re boring me, and John’s awake. See you never, hopefully.”
He strolls down the riverbank towards Vauxhall Bridge, pausing here and there to enjoy the view. He’s been underground for less than a day, but it feels like he can breathe easier up here. He remembers there's an Indian place he rather likes off Vauxhill Bridge Road and turns away from the river, heading west towards Regency Street. On a whim, he decides to take a detour through Bessborough Gardens.
There's a new door in Sherlock's mind palace.

“Yep,” John grins. “It was a good one, too. My bunkmates were champion snorers and with them gone, I slept better than I had in months. No nightmares, either.”
Sherlock waves his hand dismissively. “The paranormal rarely operates on a regular timetable, why should I?”
Not that he can blame her. Sherlock is actually quite fit, in a gangly, posh sort of way. His suit is clearly tailored to fit his long frame and his dark curls have that tousled look that appears effortless and (John knows from past experience with a particularly image-conscious flatmate) take quite a bit of time, effort, and product. His angular face isn’t conventionally handsome, but it’s

Jim spreads his hands in a pacifying gesture. “Just to talk. For now.”
“And how likely am I to find it, exactly?”
“It does feel that way, a bit. It’s killing me, all right." He unconsciously rolls his shoulder. "Finishing the job the bullet started."

John scrubs a hand over his face. “You pickpocketed me. And got my address from my wallet. And let yourself in with my keys.”
“There's a place here in London where people can go, er, make a statement about this sort of thing. I've had a couple of clients who told me it helped.”
“Sister,” John corrects, letting the rest go. For now.
The portcullis pauses its descent.
John stretches, hears a few things pop. His shoulder is sore—no surprise there—but his leg is mercifully quiet aside from the normal grumbling of overused muscles. He feels for his phone to check the time, but it’s not in his pocket. Neither is his wallet. Strange, that. He doesn’t remember taking them out before he collapsed last night. Perhaps he left them in Sherlock’s office. He extracts himself from the cot and pads to the door. Looks through the window.

John steps forward in a daze, anger forgotten, takes it from the smiling man. “Er, thank you.”
“Possibly, but…” Sherlock grins. “That’s Mycroft’s personal card. I’d put it to use before he notices it’s gone, if I were you.”
John takes a breath, gathers his nerve. “Would you—stay? I, I know this cot isn’t very big, but I think it might—help. I’ll try not to attack you in my sleep,” he offers, a weak attempt at humor.

quickly enough and they effortlessly slice through the fabric covering her thigh. She sees him looking and winks. He shudders.
Sherlock is surprised into a genuine laugh by this, not just his usual smirk or chuckle. It’s deep and almost soundless. He shakes his head, still laughing. “John. Bloody. Watson. You

Mycroft heaves a theatrical sigh and moves towards the exit. “Have it your way, brother mine. But don’t take too long. I’ll be in touch later to check on any…developments.”
“Here we are,” Molly chirps, interrupting this train of thought. She opens a door labeled “Statement Room” and brings him into a small room containing a desk and a chair. The desk has an elderly laptop on it, along with several sheets of paper and a couple of badly-chewed biros. Apparently all the Institute's money is allocated elsewhere. Maybe behind that steel blast door out in the hall.
He had bragged to Sherlock about his sheer stubborn bloodymindedness, hadn’t he?
She smiles—or rather, she moves all the muscles that would normally result in a smile, but it doesn't look quite right. “I said,” she repeats, “is that better?”
“And this evening? Has anything like that happened to you before?”

terrible. Getting shot hasn’t helped either, has it? His two-fingered typing is abysmally slow and even though Molly had told him to take his time, he isn't keen on getting shooed out at closing time. That left the recording option.
He’s back under the stars, in the desert. Nothing but sand and sky as far as he can see.

Sherlock looks more flummoxed than ever. “Not really. People tend to spend as little time with me as possible. Except for Mycroft, who I wish would spend less.” John can’t help but snort at this, and after a second Sherlock smiles at him tentatively. He's still miffed, but Sherlock has a way of short-circuiting his pique. It’s damned annoying.
Tea dispensed and Molly departed, John blurts, "You should be nicer to her."
She clicks the button and says, "See these bars here? They move when you talk so you know it's working. Every once in a while it gets a bit glitchy, so let me know if you run into any trouble." She pauses the recording and moves towards the door, tour over. "Take as long as you need and come find me when you've finished."

again, or something else equally tedious.”
There continues to be no response, and Sherlock is starting to wonder if something is wrong. They hadn’t parted on bad terms, had they? No, John had seemed in a decent mood. A bit antsy, but otherwise fine.
That’s not one John has ever suffered from. As far as he’s concerned, the dark is a blessing. He sleeps.

But that doesn’t matter, because John is sitting on a bench and looking at him with such shock and tentative hope that Sherlock wants to invent a time travel machine just so he can go back and punch every single person in John’s life that made him look that way now, like he’s flabbergasted that someone’s
He’s trying to focus on developing a theory about the emergence of a new power that seems to flit about in the corners of certain statements that aren’t easily attributed to any of the other entities. He wishes John were here so he could tell him about it and tolerate John’s stupid questions until one of them unlocked the next epiphany. He
, he thinks, and turns around.
John shakes his head. “I honestly don’t know. I guess that’s why I came to you.” He pauses, stares into his Scotch. “That’s not true, actually. There are lots of things that happen in wartime that you—you never really find out the reason for. I don’t think I expected an explanation. I just wanted to tell someone what happened. I thought, I don’t know, maybe it would make me feel better.”
“You remember Molly?” John nods. “She came in last year to give a statement, like you. She used to be an M.E. at Bart’s and some of the cadavers in the mortuary were…let’s say they were giving her some trouble. I offered her a bit of locum work here at the Archives, and as soon as she signed an employment contract…” he shrugged. “The situation resolved itself.”
“Right,” he says, and John can’t tell which of them he’s talking to. “So those four, and I suppose we can throw the Eye in there as well, since you’re staying here. Actually…” He wrinkles his nose in annoyance. “My stupid brother

And then Sherlock sees it. A door at the back, near the lavatories. An ordinary wooden door with a plain white sign on it that says “Storage Room.”
Sherlock goes very still.
“This is what I want, Sherlock. I want you to stop meddling in my…well,
“Perhaps I should have been scared. I don’t remember feeling much of anything, really. I sat there and I watched the stars turn overhead for I don’t know how long. Longer than the night should have lasted, I think, although I didn’t have any way of keeping track of time. Eventually, I fell asleep. When I woke up, the sun was just coming up and the base was a stone’s throw away. I got a right ear-bashing from my CO, and that was the end of my evening walks. The desert didn’t hold much draw for me after that night, anyway.”
So. A malevolent entity beyond human comprehension has decided to trap John in its maze and make his worst fears come true—or at least, make him

John steps out into the sunshine, or what passes for it on this overcast day. It’s still better than the unchanging light of the Archive basement. In his pocket is a key to the Institute and a folded copy of his “employment” contract, which Sherlock insisted he sign before leaving. His gun is tucked into the small of his back—also at Sherlock’s insistence. It’s a comforting weight, although he doesn’t like to admit it.

He swallows, comes back to himself. “You’re right. I…did not predict that possibility.”
"Statement taken direct from subject on 29th January. Statement begins." He looks at John again.

Sherlock glances over. The woman waves at them again with her free hand, the one that’s not behind John. Her fingers now resemble spindly knives: cruelly pointed and entirely inhuman.
Sherlock swings his legs around, arranges himself gingerly. John is on the inside, facing the wall, but it really isn’t a very large bed. “Can you—budge over?” Sherlock also rolls onto his side, facing out into the room. They lie there in the dark, back to back, and John is comforted by the other man’s warmth, his quiet breathing. He feels his own breath begin to soften and lets himself drift back to unconsciousness.
Sherlock looks puzzled. "Why?"
“So, you’re an avatar, then. Like—” he stops short.
Sherlock sighs. “That bloody umbrella, the stupid ‘keeping an eye on you’ jokes…he wants to rub it in your face that he thinks you’re too dim to catch on.”
“And the next thing I remember is a leftenant shaking me and asking me why the hell I was skiving off when I had a surgery to perform.”

It has a white printed sign on it that reads “Storage Room." It looks just like the one in the real Archive. When he finally grits his teeth and opens it, what he finds there is…distressing, for lack of a better word. Not because of the contents, but because of what they portend.
“Yes. I…yes. But that wasn’t…I don’t think it could be. The same man.”
Sherlock beams, oblivious to John’s irritation. “I thought you might want a few things, since it’s not safe to go back yet. Your gun’s in there as well.”
Before he can second-guess himself any further, John pushes open the door and approaches the reception desk.
Sherlock eyes widened.

Sherlock eyes glossed over as his hands move over John body catching two handful of said arse.
Sherlock rolled his eyes
Damn Sherlock for always being right.
“I want us to investigate first, before the police get involved.”
“So, this what you came up with?”
“What is your plan exactly? Knocking on his door?”
“Exactly!”
“Don’t be ridiculous Dr. Watson, I would never kill you despite you lack in judgment regarding boyfriends.”
Sherlock smirked,
“Don’t be ridiculous John. A life of a thief is ordinary and boring.”
“That would be me I suppose?”
John chocked on his champagne.
“Just stop arguing because it doesn’t matter what you say, I won’t have sex with you on this plane.”
They hailed a cap, Sherlock gave a piece of paper to the cabbie who nodded and took off. John stared at the window forcefully stopping himself from asking Sherlock about their destination. If Sherlock wanted it to be a surprise so be it.
“The great detective caught by a lowly guard, ironic isn’t it?”
“Please tell me you don’t have a secret life as a thief.”
Since finding the truth about the attempted murder was the quickest way to keep Sherlock safe, John nodded in agreement.
John looked at Sherlock as he thought of the best course of action. He was totally absorbed in thought that he didn’t notice Sherlock hand sneaking inside his trousers till it squeezed his dick.
“Then, what do you suggest?”
“I thought you wanted a normal date? People have sex when they come back home not
“That means your life is still in danger.”
He was wrong.
“Not that I’m complaining, but what brought this on?”
John hurriedly added before Sherlock could, frustratingly, argue some more.
John shook his head fondly.
“Anyway, have you called 999?”
“I know where we should go. John, follow me.”
They were up in the air for about an hour when Sherlock suddenly asked.
“Do you know the gravest mistake you made?”
“Bedroom! Now!” John growled into his ear and before Sherlock could reply, he was already being dragged towards the bedroom.
“Good! Go on.”
John was hoping that his presence would have faltered Gerald’s plan but it apparently wasn’t the case.
“Certainly. Now this other member’s name ...”
“Fine. I’ll be right there. But promise not to do anything stupid before I arrive.”
John grinned at Sherlock flushed face and irregular breathing.
“Yes. I found it as the best solution to enjoy your company without having to tolerate the idiocies of other people.”
Sherlock grinned widely at john then begin showering kisses all over his body. John moaned loudly when Sherlock started to alternate between kissing and nipping every inch of his skin.
“So, you haven’t actually
“Ahh that’s actually brilliant.”
“Why are you looking at me like that?”
“Nothing. You just like beautiful like this””
“When I find something I like”
“Are you actually asking this
“You have a point.”
“Ah! That’s a possibility but from the way he attacked me, he was an immature. And to be able to delude Mycroft secret agents, the ones he employ to keep an eye on our home, he needs to be a professional.”
John have got to hand it to Sherlock at the ingenuity of the plan. And it has one important merit; even if Lestrade wanted to consult Sherlock, he couldn’t reach him.
“Yeah right.”
“This is payback, isn’t it??”
“You don’t have to look so chipper about it.”
Breaking into the culprit’s apartment was also ridiculously easy. John decided to have a talk with Lestrade about increasing Police patrols in the streets at night. Or maybe even talk to Mycroft but the older Holmes was studiously avoiding him and Sherlock for the last few weeks to the amusement of Sherlock and the bewilderment of John.
“Well you are interesting all the time, why don’t you have a break and be boring for one day?”
. ‘His’ of course refers to you, the part guard is capitalized along with the letters A and G so it can be read as His Guard A.G, does that ring any bells?”
“You know any date with you would be more special and memorable than any other date I had before. You don’t need to do extra things.”
“Excuse me?”
“Was that on purpose? So he wouldn’t leave any clues?”
John kept throwing surreptitious glances at Sherlock who was staring intently at his laptop screen for the last three hours. Sherlock declared last week that since John didn’t realise that they were dating, they need to have a “normal first date”. He was doing research ever since and still didn’t come up with a satisfying idea; satisfying for him of course, for John said anything would be fine but Sherlock insisted it needed to be perfect.
“He is a member of your fan club.”
“But how? We’ve hardly been affectionate in public and our daily routines hasn’t really changed since we started ‘dating’.”
“And that…”
“I want to make sure you’ll have the normal experience, a date then sex. If it were for me I’d jump directly to sex, who needs these social etiquettes, people should do as they want...”
He trailed kisses along Sherlock chest then abdomen till he reached his pubic hair and he stopped. Sherlock breathing had become erratic waiting for John’s next move. John decided to torture him as a payback for all the grievances Sherlock had put him through. So, he bypassed his aching erection and kept trailing kisses on his inner thighs, nipping on the tender flesh. He moved up again till he reached Sherlock’s nipples. He laved them with his tongue then bit the hardened nubs gently.
“He would be on his guard, especially since accomplice didn’t report back. Breaking in might not be easy.”
“It was only to watch out for the crazy ones.”
“Exactly!! Alexander Gerald to be exact, I saw his name tag once, and I remembered few days ago I walked with you to the building and kissed you goodbye, he must have seen us then.”
“What is it?”
John thought about it for a moment.
“It’s the first date you always dreamed of, isn’t it?”
“For you obviously, you get really loud.”
John immensely enjoyed the look of astonishment on Sherlock’s face.
John instinctively got closer to Sherlock at hearing the last part trying to shield him and Gerald eyes narrowed at seeing that. Sherlock got in front of John directing the guard attention back to him.
They were silent for several minutes before John sighed.
Sherlock glared at him and John considered it victory since it took his eyes away from the screen for the first time in the last three hours.
“Are you okay?”
“So, how do you like it?”
It was really sad that John first reaction at seeing the gun was a resigned sigh because of course the night would end like this, it was the only logical conclusion of everything that happened today.
“… No”
“If anyone needs to be gagged, it’s you.”
John groaned as he ended the call and hurriedly got ready to go.
“Maybe.”
“I’m fine. He didn’t hurt me.”
“Why?”
Sherlock walked purposefully to a waiting jet. He climbed up expecting John to follow, which he did. John’s eyes widened at the luxury of the interior of the plane. Sherlock slouched on one of the seats and he dazedly sat opposite to him.
“It’s wonderful.”
John wanted to savour this moment; Sherlock naked, open, unguarded underneath him. But Sherlock had other ideas, his hand reached again to squeeze his dick making him gasp and glare at Sherlock who only smirked at him.
“Are we going to the morgue?”
Sherlock looked up sharply.
“You know there’s a way to ensure my silence without restoring to gags.” John grinned mischievously at him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“Should we tell them about the security cameras?”
can stay silent” John said as he lowered Sherlock’s zipper with his teeth.
“See??”
“Was that…”
“A plane?”
“Allergic to cats?”
“I’ll tell you in our way there. Now hurry up.”
“What?”
“What do you mean no? Why the hell not?”
Sherlock finally asked John on a first date. John was dying from curiosity wondering what he came up with. He tried to grill him for answers but Sherlock wouldn’t budge.
“Someone could argue that if I hadn’t dodge the hit the man wouldn’t have died.”
“Fine.”
“Aha! I knew it.”
“I’m having too much fun”
Sherlock had to be really upset by this turn of events for his remarks to lose its usual biting edge, John worriedly observed as he continued speaking,
It didn’t take them much time to reach the store and alarmingly it didn’t take Sherlock much time to pick up the lock.
“What about me? What is your excuse for killing me?” John tried to sound nonchalant as he asked.
“But if
“Have you ever done that before? With anyone else you dated?”
Sherlock was working alone in the lap when a masked man barged into the room and tried to strangle him. During the struggle the man lost his footing and slipped hitting his head hard against the counter and was killed instantly.
Despite the serious situation John found himself grinning.
“I thought you wanted the normal experience. People have dates then sex, don’t they?”
For the third time that day they were guilty of breaking and entering and like the first two times, they were in and out without any problems. It was becoming ridiculously easy that John feared Sherlock would make a habit of it in the future.
John laughed,
“Because I’m planning to make Mycroft Holmes see the video and then we’ll know once and for all if he is human or emotionless robot.”
the date.”
“You are getting better at this but of course it’s a long way to reach your master level.”
“‘Kill’ a verb that means causing someone to die by unnatural causes. Are you also losing your comprehension skills?”
“His username doesn’t ring any bells. He had to be an inactive member, only reading posts without commenting.”
Sherlock didn’t give John the opportunity to refute that claim by quickly adding.
“Yes you should have”
John let go and gazed at Sherlock breathing harshly,
“We will see.”
“Stop teasing”
Sherlock rolled his eyes,
‘Of course’ was Sherlock decisive answer.
John spluttered tea on the opened page in his lap.
“Don’t be stupid, that’s not what I meant”
John answered stopped kissing Sherlock neck to look at him in the eyes as he answered,
“I heard you fine the first time but what the hell? What do you mean you killed someone?”
this question?”
John stopped glaring and gazed fondly at Sherlock. He loved Sherlock laugh. It was a shame he didn’t laugh more often. He caressed his face gently and Sherlock stopped laughing to smile at him and John couldn’t think of a more perfect moment.
Three was a pause before Sherlock replied.
“Not actually stalling. I knew Mycroft men were right behind us. I wanted to hear his plan before they took him in.”
"Fine," Sherlock huffs. He raises his voice. "Let's get on with it then, Molly."
Sherlock’s mouth twists in reluctance, but he nods assent. “We may come across other entities you’ve encountered in time, but there’s one thing I haven’t been able to work out.” He looks frustrated. “It should be

“Then get up. It’s fine.” John doesn’t particularly feel like examining the relief that blooms inside him, warming his core, softening his clenched insides. He pulls his legs up onto the cot, makes to lie down. “But for now—c’mere?”
He raises an eyebrow at John."Shall we?" He glances at the old-fashioned tape recorder sitting on the table between them. Had it always been there? John can’t remember.
. He feels like a bug under a magnifying glass. Maybe that should bother him, but he had felt near-invisible since coming back to London. People either look right past him, or (like his therapist) ask him about things he doesn’t have words for. It’s strangely comforting to have his backstory read off without having to

He looks up from the paper. “Do you actually believe I could have had,” he grimaces, “a supernatural experience?”
. “I was going to get breakfast,” John remembers. Sherlock brightens, leans over, retrieves a takeaway cup and a paper bag from where they were hidden behind the front desk. “You can’t trust Mycroft around pastries,” he confides. He holds them out to John. A peace offering.
“It’s, don’t worry about it. Never mind,” John says hastily.
John grins back despite himself. “Lovely. I’ll buy a few dozen umbrellas, shall I? He’ll never notice.”

Your limp’s really bad when you walk but you don’t ask for a chair when you stand, like you’ve forgotten about it, so it’s at least partly psychosomatic.

perception.” He shakes his head.
John reaches for his tea. How long has he been talking? Time seems to move differently here. The tea is cold, but he sips it anyway.
John meets his eyes, his own face unreadable. He nods decisively, puts his hands on his knees, levers himself to his feet. He turns to the door that's appeared next to the bench, puts his hand on the knob. He looks back and meet Sherlock’s eyes with an expression Sherlock can only describe as determined tenderness, or maybe tender determination. It’s set and soft at the same time, and it breaks Sherlock’s heart a little. Then his face hardens so abruptly Sherlock wonders if he imagined it. He hopes not.

Sherlock rounds on John once they're inside. He had been silent on the ride to the Institute, evidently distracted with his own private thoughts. But now his considerable attention is back on John.

. But if John is going to continue his descent into paranoia and madness, he’s damn well going to enjoy the small pleasures he can along the way.

to be that person, though, as natural as it feels. That person is—well, he’s not the kind of chap you bring ‘round to meet your mum, is he?”
“All that stuff you knew about me. Does that…come with the job, or what?”
“Yep.” John forces himself to breathe more slowly.
of us. Rule one: Don’t invade my boundaries. Rule two: you’re splitting these pastries with me.”
“I’m not done,” John interrupts. “D’you have time for more?”
Tea in hand, John contemplates where to pick up the thread of his narrative. “It might be helpful…if you asked me what you want to know,” he admits to Sherlock. “There are bits that feel—I dunno,
“And if I don’t?” Sherlock asks, still watching John out of the corner of his eye. He's sitting unnaturally still and it bothers Sherlock. He’s hardly moved at all since Sherlock’s arrival. Something’s not right and Sherlock would bet his Belstaff that it has to do with the woman sitting next to him.
to go…watch telly?”
Jim smiles a predatory smile and Sherlock senses that he's been out-maneuvered.
“So I caught up with him one night, on his way to the fitness centre, and I asked if he was feeling all right. I didn’t say anything about his frame of mind, but I did say I was worried about overexertion and wanted to make sure he was feeling well. And he said…” John can feel the blood draining away from his face as the memory returns.
And then a sardonic Irish voice comes from behind him. “
“Probably not.” Sherlock leans forward. “Anyway. The Eye has its own agenda, as much as any of the other powers, but it’s not the worst patron by far. And if you work here, you fall under its protection.”
The air is cool on his face and he revels in the newfound ease of walking without pain, without that damn cane.
Did you get this from my flat?”
“Damn it, Sherlock, I’m a fucking
“The hard times were when nothing much was happening. Of course I didn’t
I thought.
Something sparks in the back of John's mind and just like that, the words are there.
he is! I was beginning to worry you wouldn’t make it, Sherlock. What would I do with your pet soldier then?”
“Johnny-boy!” he says with delight. “Glad you could make it.” He has a light Irish accent. Despite the smile, his eyes remain cold. Assessing. Shark eyes, to be sure.
He studies the red button on the screen.
“Good.”
Sherlock agreed heartily. They attacked each other clothes taking article after one till they were both naked pressed against each other.
“You mean this is the date. On the airplane?”
“I’m not being
Sherlock said without hesitation.
“I’m fine. I guess that what you were stalling for.”
. I got you where I want you, didn’t I?”
But Sherlock was already in his way out of the lab.
“No you won’t.”
When John arrived at the lab he found Sherlock leaning over the dead body on the floor with concentrated look on his face. He was wearing latex gloves and he had removed the mask off the man face.
“No they don’t when their lovers are obsessive perfectionist”
“Of course it is.”

“To where? … Sherlock! Wait!”
“At other times
“Ah, there is the Sherlock I know. I was getting worried.”
“Yes john that’s what I’m saying. Isn’t it pretty obvious? I mean...”
“And someone could
John looked at the dead body few feet away and back at Sherlock serious expression. Instead of getting up and leaving the place he cupped his lover’s face bringing their mouths together into a soft kiss.
“I’m sure you’re dying to tell me.” Gerald sarcastically asked confident in his bulletproof plan.
“Are you out of your bloody mind?”
They were silent after that. There were two glasses of champagne on the table between the seats. He gratefully grabbed one. He debated with himself if he should ask any more questions and decided against it. He would wait and be surprised like Sherlock intended him to be.
“I said I killed somebody; a man to be more specific. Should you go to the doctor? Are you losing your hearing?”
Sherlock snorted.
Sherlock huffed and looked away. John felt such a surge of emotion for his… what were the best words to describe Sherlock? Best friend, lover, roommate, bane of his existence, light of his life. Maybe all of them combined.
“Why do you care so much about this?”
“Your overconfidence in your abilities was your downfall. You didn’t think for a second that my user name was coined like that on purpose to lure you here where I can justifiably kill you.”
“Creative?”
Sherlock smiled back.
“Has a dog?”
"But he didn’t.”
“Gags??”
“My WHAT? I don’t have a fan club”
After a pregnant pause the co-pilot asked.
“Hello”
John interrupted with strangled voice,
This night was going to end  in a disaster. John just knew it.
John glared at Sherlock smug face.
John snorted and get closer to the body.
“It’s our first murder case since we officially started dating.”
I have doubts about you readiness for sex. I was waiting for you to make the first move. But
John growled into the phone.
The pilot and the co-pilot were startled by a loud noise.
“I’m not asking you to” he mimicked John voice,
They glared at each other before each one turned his head away.
Sherlock eyes narrowed dangerously.
“Are we going to a crime scene?”
“I am a member, of course.”
“You mean I usually look ugly?”
John gasped at the feel of Sherlock hands. He leaned down and start kissing Sherlock again.
John frowned surveying the small flat.
Sherlock exclamation pulled john out of his musings and made him turn towards what his roommate was looking at only to find himself uttering the same curse.
“You didn’t have time observe anything. How
Because when he climaxed thirty minutes later screaming Sherlock name, that was a bit more perfect.
John thought the question over.
“The photos are not hidden in a locked room that would imply he lived alone and didn’t have many visitors, if any.”
“And only sex in a private jet would make it that?”
“He could have.”
“Never mind. We can break into the department store and find out.”
Photos of John were plastered everywhere on the flat walls. Shots of him walking down the pavement, coming out of 221B Baker Street, shopping at multiple stores, and a lot more.
John smiled,
John. Now, to what you missed: some of the photos are quite old meaning he was stalking you for a long time, since we started living together. What did make him act now? Why did he suddenly find me a threat?”
After several minutes another sound was heard.
“You think yourself very clever, don’t you?” Sherlock didn’t seem concerned with the gun pointed at his face.
“Yes you do, your blog is very popular.”
John didn’t let go of Sherlock hand till they were inside the bedroom. He manoeuvred them towards the bed still kissing the day lights out of him. Sherlock said breathlessly as his back hit the mattress with John on top of him kissing his neck,
that’s complete bollocks.”
“Well, have you done that with anyone before?”
anyone but someone tried to kill
Since arguing with Sherlock was a futile endeavour John resignedly asked.
“Could you please close the door Dr. Watson.” Gerald calmly addressed him. John closed it without turning his back to the security guard but Gerald eyes were solely fixed on Sherlock.
To his astonishment the cap pulled at a private airport. Sherlock paid and left waiting impatiently for John to come out as well. John got out reluctantly wondering for the hundredth time what was Sherlock planning.
“Why?”
“And I know you didn’t believe me.”
“You created a situation where I’ll be the guilty party, I broke into your house after all.”
Sherlock’s face frowned in thought before it lighted up in recognition. He stood up and started walking out of the room.
John was shaken that he almost lost Sherlock twice in one day, that he had obsessive stalkers who he met on daily basis. But the important thing that they were both fine and they could get over anything together.
“Threatening John’s well-being. I would never forgive that.” In a quick move Sherlock brought john to the ground covering him with his body as a shot rang out in the house. Gerald dead body hit the floor with a thud.
who wanted to get rid of me and who had found the prefect scapegoat.”
“Precisely. People would think you finally lost it and tried to kill someone.”
Sherlock started explaining the moment John caught up to him.
John was feeling content as he sipped from his glass.
“Courtesy of Mycroft”
“What is this?”
John breathed harshly into the phone speaking in a tight voice.
“Bloody fucking hell!!”
John couldn’t change Sherlock mind about breaking into the department store but he tried to convince him to call Lestrade but Sherlock in turn convinced him to leave an anonymous tip instead so they wouldn’t have to deal with the inspector’s ire and john found himself agreeing with that logic.
“Not much, only that he works…”
John pinched the bridge of his nose.
“When I’ve ever done anything stupid?”
“We can what?!!... Sherlock!!”
“Because I wanted this date to be special, to be memorable.”
John was looking throw the drawers when Sherlock, who was checking the culprit’s laptop, exclaimed,
“Are we going to stop a crime from being committed?”
, but not during sex.”
“Not before we confront him.”
“I know him or more accurately I knew him. He works… well, worked for the department store I usually shop in. I talked to him few times and that’s why I know about his dog and allergy.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“What did you find out so far?
“Thank you.”
“So how do you like the idea of sex in the air?”
John face heated at the direct gaze, he blurted,
“It couldn’t be a coincidence that a man you knew tried to kill me. Do you know his address?”
“No.”
They got up as Mycroft men entered the room. Sherlock talked few words to them and then they left going back to Baker Street.
“Pretty much”
“Of course?!” John was incredulous
“Are you saying that the only reason we haven’t had sex yet is because we didn’t have a first date?”
“Another member sent him a message few days ago. He asked for a private meeting stating that they had an important thing to talk about regarding their idol. ”
“But that… and how do you know about it?”
“I have been dying to do this for the whole week, scratch that for months but I didn’t know it was an option till a week ago.”
John was confused for a second before his eyes widened in understanding.
people do.”
Sherlock calmly waited for John to catch his breath. After several minutes a red faced John glared at Sherlock.
, I’m being sensible.”
Sherlock collapsed on John, burying his face into his neck mumbling.
“What stopped me?” John asked incredulously.
“And give him a warning we’re coming? Certainly not.”
“Do I dare to suggest a restaurant then?”
“Why? WHY?? First of all the pilot is right over there” John pointed at the cockpit.”
“That’s ridiculous. We should enjoy our date not get mad at each other.”
John smiled fondly at Sherlock.
John frowned.
“When are you going to stop researching this?”
“Smart arse”
Although it was an obvious conclusion John found himself uttering.
“He could be spying on us?”
John ran his hand soothingly though dark curls.
“You are the one ruining the date.”
John sighed and looked at Sherlock who hasn’t moved in the last three hours and asked tiredly,
“No.”
“And how did you do that exactly?” John realized that Sherlock was stalling but for what?
Sherlock was interrupted again, this time by forceful lips pressing against his own.
John blinked.
Sherlock frowned harder.
Any fears John had about Sherlock inexperience in sexual matters evaporated by the confidence he was showing dealing with John. He decided to stop delaying and start acting.
“Don’t want to. I’m having so much fun”
John glared.
John felt stupid as his heart skipped a beat hearing that like a bloody teenager.
John let Sherlock stew for few more minutes before he took pity on him and said.
“Yes.”
“There’s no sign of the dog. He knew there was a chance he wouldn’t come back and left him somewhere.”
Sherlock frowned at him but suddenly he smiled mischievously and John knew he was in trouble. The world shifted for a second and John found himself lying on his back with Sherlock on top of him.
Sherlock found the address of the assailant slash shop assistant quickly enough and John was glad to leave the place undetected by anyone, at least he hoped so.
“Yes and he is ….”
“Sure thing.”
John gasped and focused his gaze on Sherlock smirking face. He retaliated by diving down and biting his neck. Sherlock groaned and tightened his hold on John’s dick.
“So, never?”
“Someone put him to it. Someone who w
John felt creeped out, first the shop assistant and now the security guard, both men part of his daily life not some strangers lurking in the dark, both looked and acted normal with no ominous attire or shifty eyes. He guessed it was too much to hope for loonies to look their part. Shaking the dark thoughts and focusing on the present moment, the tried again with Sherlock.
“Where do I even…Okay. Let’s get this straight. What you did…that was an

to stay angry, damn it, but he can feel his pique melting away. “You don’t know everything, smart-arse.”
“I don't suppose you could just—look at me and know what happened," John says with a sigh.
John shakes his head. “Not even a little bit,” he says. “I don’t believe I’m remotely suited or qualified for that work, and frankly the way you’re offering it gives me the creeps.”
in the desert in a while—when I did think of it, I chalked it up to falling asleep without realizing it and having a weird dream. But this felt…similar. Like I’d somehow stepped into a world next to this one and I was the only one there.
John awakens alone and disoriented in the dark, his body a mass of aching muscles. But he's not covered in sweat and his palms are free of the usual fingernail indentations. His jaw isn’t sore, for once, and neither is his throat. No clenching or screaming, then.
“Great. Brilliant. So you're what, king of the spiders?” As John watches, the creatures are busily filling in the space between armrest and seat with intricate patterns.
. “No,” he repeats, attempting a more level tone. “That won't be necessary. I'll leave you and your lot alone. I promise.”
.” These last words are delivered with chilling menace.
We both know it’s true, why bother pretending it’s not?”
It makes John’s brain hurt. He turns away, nauseated, and Sherlock is
“I don't understand. You've been touched by at least
“Y-yes. Yes, John. I understand.” And then, in a rush: “You think my cheekbones are
But as much as he tries to set it aside, the fact remains: John, in the space of a day, has become something of a necessity to Sherlock’s work. And by extension, to Sherlock.
"You could be right about that."
The door has a white printed sign on it that reads “Storage Room." It looks just like the one in the real Archive. When he finally grits his teeth and opens it, what he finds there is…distressing, for lack of a better word. Not because of the contents, but because of what they portend.

“That's about the shape of it,” John agrees. His mouth twists. “I’m aware it doesn't make a lot of sense. This thing...
He had been picturing a run-down storefront with crystals in the window. Instead, he's facing an elegant limestone edifice in Westminster. There's a bronze plaque near the door that reads
“We've become aware of a number of…entities who seem to be behind the more credible reports we get at the Archive. As far as we can tell, they are the physical manifestation of humanity’s most basic fears. Death. The dark.”
He ducks his head, looking surprised and pleased. "That's not what people usually say," he says.
Their eyes meet and John snorts. Sherlock smirks, the expression at home on his pale, sardonic face.
Just another night. He can do this. “You were a new addition, though.”
thinks John. He knows an office crush when he sees one.
“It’s basically a matter of…food,” Sherlock said with distaste. “The powers are fueled by a few things. Fear and sacrifice, mainly, and they don’t much care where it comes from. It’s…it’s like working at one restaurant and eating at another. As long as you’re paying, they don’t care where you got the money.”
, he thinks with venom.
“Harry’s short for Harriet.” He tries not to feel too gleeful at Sherlock’s crestfallen face.
Looking at it makes his head spin and he shuts his eyes. But not knowing where it is makes him nervous, so he opens them again. Settles for focusing on the ground at its feet.
“Anyway, I was a bit freaked to be sure, but soon enough I found myself accepting the situation. Maybe it’s because I grew up in a place where someone was always shouting, or the rules were always changing, but I’m usually pretty good at coming to terms with whatever’s happening at the moment. Maybe that’s why I was such a natural fit for the army.” He pauses and shakes his head. “Sorry, you’re not here for amateur psychoanalysis.”
“Starving.”
He repeats the words back to himself.
and easy to manipulate, after all. He gave me a challenge, seeing if I could avoid that Eye of his. But he got too good, and too close. And he keeps interfering.” John thinks he can detect real regret in the other man’s tone. “So. Playtime’s over.”
John smiles into the darkness. “That makes two of us, then. But maybe we can help each other figure it out. I suppose I can play lab rat a while longer.”
He takes a seat—at least the chair is comfortable—and contemplates his options. He doesn’t fit many doctor stereotypes, but his handwriting
“But it
He makes a scornful noise. “Nothing paranormal about that. I observe and make deductions based on my observations. Anyone could learn to do it, but no one bothers.”

It’s well past nightfall on this January evening. Unless John’s eaten anything since the chocolate biscuits he nicked from the lounge this afternoon, he’s probably hungry.
“Yep,” John grins. “It was a good one, too. My bunkmates were champion snorers and with them gone, I slept better than I had in months. No nightmares, either.”
Sherlock had looked around uneasily then. “I wouldn’t be quite so…upfront about my fears, if I were you. You may have had an unlikely amount of luck so far, but there’s no sense tempting fate.”

He reads the name off the paper. “The Magnus Institute? But that’s…”

I’m afraid of going mad. I have a psychosomatic limp—”
to one such as I?
That gets him a sharp look. "I... don't think you'd enjoy that," says Sherlock. "Most people don't." He pauses and John can’t tell if he’s joking. "You don't seem like most people, though." A sidelong glance.

“The next time something happened, I was prepping for an emergency appendectomy. I had my back to the room while I scrubbed in, and it was like…like someone had come and turned down the volume knob on the world.
"That was…amazing," John says, realising that the silence has stretched out and Sherlock is now looking at him warily.
“Well,” he says slowly, “you’ve only used it on me when there was something I
“Information, mostly.” Sherlock gestures at the tape recorder, humming away in its usual place. “It likes to know what’s going on. Like honeybees, we fly off and retrieve bits of information to bring back to the hive.”
I know. But I’d like to hear you say it.” He shivers, attempts to raise his eyes—and almost passes out from nausea and disorientation.

“I’d been abroad for about a year the first time something…weird happened. I was stationed in Kandahar, and the first few months were so chaotic it was all I could to to keep my head. Obviously I’d had training and pulled a few shifts in A&E, but nothing prepares you for the pressure of field surgery.
That dizziness, like standing on the edge of a precipice, swims over him again. It’s frightening and exhilarating, to have his history so effortlessly plucked out of him. And that it all made a strange kind of sense and was done without any psychic weirdness…
Sherlock looks down and away with studied nonchalance that John finds almost indescribably endearing. “I, er—I’ll be here. If that’s—I, I have some things to look into.”
Ugh, this chapter was a bear to write, but I think I know how things will go from here.

Sherlock turns away from his conspiracy wall, plops down on the sofa, pulls his legs up towards his chest. He looks very young like that. “Yes, but not the way you’re thinking,” he says to his knees. “I don’t belong to the Hunt.”
. The Web will continue to function regardless of your petty interference. I’m doing you a favor and giving you and Johnny-boy the chance to get out of the way before you get…snared…yourself.”
They sit side by side on the storage room cot in the dark. John is still shaking. Sherlock is silent, giving him time. He doesn't fuss, doesn't ask stupid questions. He just sits there, solid and comforting, which is exactly what John needs right now.
They don’t know how true that is.

I wondered if I’d been hit by a mine or a sniper and died without even knowing it. I wondered if this was the afterlife.

"Um, my time in Afghanistan."
Most of the files contain only a sheet or two. There’s really not much about people that’s worth remembering, when you get down to it. Details like birthdays and pet’s names only matter when you’re making small talk, and Sherlock abhors small talk.
“This is what I want, Sherlock. I want you to stop meddling in my…well,

“So, we’ve established that you’ve had first-degree contact with the Vast, the Lonely, and the Flesh.” Sherlock is standing on the sofa and busily taping various pieces of paper to the wall above it. “Let’s see who else you’ve been playing with. Ah yes, the Hunt.”
He walks inside.

He holds up a hand again to forestall any interjections. “And no, this isn’t about my ‘pedestrian conventions’, or whatever you’d call them. I’ve known you for less than twenty-four hours, Sherlock, and I can already tell that you’ll run roughshod over pretty much any boundary if you think it’s justified. And maybe you’re used to getting your way, with your stupid cheekbones and more-logical-than-thou attitude, but you’re going to be doing a few things

“Honestly, it’s like you’re not even

The laugh is infectious and John joins in. “I suppose I am, cheating all sorts of dread powers with nothing but stubbornness and a bad temper to back me up. Ought to give me a medal.”
But before “Irene” does anything, one of the nearby shop doors opens. It looks the same as all the others, but John suspects these doors only open if his captor is in the mood.
He trudges to a bench, half-collapsing onto it. His leg’s beginning to ache and he could scream from frustration.

“What. Do. You.
When Sherlock meets someone for the first time, he deduces their immediately relevant information and files it away in his own mental version of the Archive. Periodically, he culls any data that he isn’t likely to need again. He builds a giant bonfire near the front desk and spends a satisfying hour incinerating the useless trivia that seems to exist for the sole purpose of cluttering his brain.
“Well, it wasn’t the same, of course—I’ve never seen anything like
It’s not uncommon for people to say of Sherlock, “He read me like a book!”
“Please.”
“From you? Nothing. Just keep wiggling on that shiny hook of yours.” Jim drops the grin and the shark is back. “From him? To

way if you want my help.”
“And who the hell are you supposed to be?” John asks tiredly. He's had enough of dramatic entrances to last him the next few lifetimes.
The cot in the storage room isn’t luxurious, but John’s slept on worse, hasn’t he? After the day he’s had, he might not even dream, and wouldn’t that be a treat for once. “G’night, then,” he says to Sherlock’s lanky silhouette in the doorway. “I guess…I’ll see you tomorrow?”
“But it's hurting
The thing hums, idly scrapes a fingernail along the pavement, leaving behind a deep gash in the concrete. “Very well.
Jim cocks his head as if reading Sherlock’s thoughts. “Y’know what? I’m sensing some…inner conflict. Maybe Irene could do a little

“It took me a bit to find my feet and try not to botch any procedures or die myself. But it didn’t take as long as I thought it would and I found I actually quite liked the pressure. And the danger, if I’m honest. The more dangerous the situation, the quieter and calmer I became on the inside. I didn’t have to be anybody but the one fixing you up. I didn’t have to think about—I didn’t have to think.
“You help me out with investigations, follow up on statements. Stitch us up when things get messy, which happens occasionally.” Sherlock looks down at one of his hands, flexing it, and John senses a story there. “You can stay in the storage room for the time being until we straighten out your flat.”
John has been though a multitude of terrible and awe-inspiring and strange and (yes) spooky things in his almost 40 years on earth, and none of them make him feel the way he does while this man deduces his entire identity, from his relationship with Harry down to the damn psychosomatic limp.
But apparently, his efforts are enough to get the attention of
John thinks of Angelo’s and suppresses a shudder. “And I’ll be feeding the Eye…what?”
“Like what?”
“What—” John clears his throat, starts again. “What do you mean, stop?”
"My name is Dr. John Watson, formerly of the Fifth—hang on."

Before he can continue, a chime echoes through the marble entry hall. Sherlock sighs heavily and turns back to the front door. Angelo is standing on the front steps. “Sherlock texted me,” he says, and holds up John’s cane. “He said you forgot this.”
John opens his mouth, but nothing comes out. Try as he might, he still can’t find the words for what happened to him. All this time and effort, and it’s clear he’s wasted everyone’s time. He closes his eyes and clenches his fist in helpless frustration.

John pauses, lost in memories.

An hour later, John is more or less clean and in fresh clothes. The decon shower was far from luxurious, but the shampoo and conditioner he’d found there (Sherlock’s, he’s positive) made up for it. He keeps reaching up to touch the hair at the back of his neck, so much softer than usual.
He tries to remember what Sherlock had said about the others.
Mycroft hates this habit, especially since Sherlock always “forgets” to preserve the names and faces of major donors.  Sherlock takes a certain petty satisfaction in answering the occasional indignant, “Don’t you know who I

Sherlock makes a frustrated noise. “You don’t even…

The thing above him hums and its outline—at least the portion of it he can see from the corner of his eye—solidifies.

“I don’t know how long that will last. But I’ll explain as much as I can before Mycroft feels the need to interfere.”
“Oh, that’s just
Sherlock comes around to the front of his desk and reseats himself in a modern-looking armchair of tubular steel and black leather. He gestures to the chair opposite, an overstuffed red affair that seems made to support John perfectly. He lets out a small involuntary groan of comfort as he sinks into its welcoming cushions.
As he stands near the cot where he and John spent that first fretful night (and just

“Leaving you free to manipulate and snare whoever you please.”
They are back in their respective chairs, this time holding Scotch instead of tea. With no windows to tell the time of day, John feels a sense of unreality washing over him. Like no time has passed since this afternoon. Like that…thing at Angelo’s was just a trauma-fuelled hallucination. But his cane is nowhere in sight.
"All right then, let me just set these down." She puts the tea mugs on the front desk and leads him down a hall lined with several doors. Most of them are ordinary office doors that have signs like “Employee Lounge” or “Storage Room.”
John thinks giddily. He takes a deep breath and the next piece comes to him, this time without Sherlock’s prompting.

“Well, there's an idea,” Jim croons. “First sensible one you've had all night.” He snaps his fingers and Irene stretches languidly, removing her hand from behind John's back and placing it demurely in her lap in the process. Her razor-sharp fingertips don't change back
It’s a perfectly normal Indian restaurant—counter at the front for picking up takeaway, tables scattered around the room behind it. Tall vases of lotus pods lurk in the corners and brightly colored prints of Shiva and Durga and Kali gaze at him from burgundy walls.

The brass lift doors open onto an area that is...not quite as impressive as the entry hall. The main Archive is just as large, but significantly more worn-looking. Scuffed wooden floors instead of marble, painted walls instead of paneling. Shelves and cabinets stretch off into the distance, fairly reeking of academia and tight budgets. At a glance John can tell this is a place for Getting Things Done, not impressing visitors.
“You don’t?…No, of course not. You and Mycroft, you work for something that…knows things. Right?” Sherlock’s head snaps up, and John thinks that he easily could get addicted to surprising Sherlock, just to see that look on his face.

“So, whose face is this, then? Just someone you made up?”
“Where is everyone, then?” he asks Sherlock. John’s sitting on the edge of the cot, pulling on his socks. “I mean, Molly and whoever else works down here with you?”
Molly looks hurt, but quickly covers it with a pained smile. "You got it, boss," she says, and leaves them alone.
Another five minutes pass before John has to admit that the city noise isn’t getting any louder, staying just this side of audible no matter how far he walks. He’s even more turned around now. The street signs are all unfamiliar, the clouds make it hard to tell where the sun is, and he can’t see the water. He is, he acknowledges to himself, completely lost.

…well. Thank you. Sleep well.” The door closes softly and John is left in darkness.
“Hmm,” John says as though this makes any sort of sense. (It doesn’t.)

anything for once.
“You’d be surprised how often that’s the case.” Sherlock gets to his feet in a fluid motion that John envies and holds out a hand to help him up. “Hungry?”
John feels a white-hot urge to punch Sherlock’s name out of that smirking mouth. “What do you want?” he asks warily.
him. It had to be John too, because Sherlock trusted him. He'd never submit to a stranger. Ever. The idea excited John, in surprising and not so surprising ways. His cock was trying to perk up at the idea of Sherlock submitting to him, and a whole wide realm of possibilities played like a slide show through his mind tha- No. John shut that down. Assume control, go from there. Sound strategy, even if he'd be winging it. He was taking a gamble, certainly, but the payout would be worth it if he was right. Right.
“I understand... what.” John's tone was a little dangerous, and Sherlock turned back to him, taking in his bearing and damn the man was sexy, drawing on his soldier's nature. Sherlock hadn't been sure John would want the titles, but he supposed it made sense, helped him get and keep his mien for something that was mostly new to him.
“John! What happens if I don't?” Sherlock kept eye contact. Come on old boy, you know this. Think it through. John narrowed his eyes in thought, started to speak, stopped himself, then finally the proverbial light bulb.
Mrs. Hudson;
“You, Sir. I'm aroused by you.”
John was as lost and dazed as his boy. The pleasure hummed through him like a million volts from a live wire. He was overcome, the intoxicating rush of power and dominance over this man going straight to his head. The things he was saying, the things he wanted to do, seemed so out of character for him when he thought about it from a distance. It almost gave him pause, but his boy was starting to squirm again, and he decided he could think it through and fret over it all later. Now, his boy needed his Sir.
“Drop the pillow on the floor in front of you.” John's voice had gone a bit gravelly. Interesting.
“But...”
John moaned as he thrust hard once more, and Sherlock did his best to open his throat and control his breathing, swallowing around the cock in his throat to keep from gagging. Being completely, willingly subservient to another's whims like this was nothing like he'd expected. He felt freedom in being controlled, even though his hands were still on John's hips, they were only there for the tactile connection. He wasn't truly helpless, but he didn't need to be. Even if John stopped in this throat, closing off his airway, he'd still not push him away. God but it was heady. He groaned again around John's cock as he imagined the man controlling even his ability to draw breath.
“I'm going to come inside you, boy. Would you like that?” John ground his hips down, pressing his cock deeper, massaging his boy's prostate and feeling Sherlock's deep moan vibrate through his own chest and around his cock. “Would you like to feel your Sir's hot come deep in your arse? Dripping out of you?
“You dare to tell your Sir what he can and cannot do to his boy?” Sherlock's eyes widened. He hadn't meant to, but that's exactly what he'd done. John waited patiently while Sherlock worked through it in his head. He wanted it, John wanted it, but it couldn't come from Sherlock's desire for it. He wasn't the one in control. It had to be John's choice
followed by an address. The next one made him blanch.
“First question. What are your safe words?” Sherlock's forehead wrinkled as though his eyebrows had gone up in surprise, and John rolled his eyes. He wasn't

“You are

, arse in the air, back arched slightly, face angled so that his burning green eyes were on his Sir, had him damn close to losing his own control.
“Are you good, boy? Comfortable?” Sir asked roughly. Even as Sir battled his own need, he thought of his boy.
John grabbed the belt of his own bathrobe, thinking about all the things he could use to tie his boy up. Somewhere whilst fighting off his orgasm and suffering through the bit of vasocongestion he'd started truly thinking of Sherlock as his boy, even in his own mind; he'd have to be careful with that. Sherlock was only his for now, and he intended to make the most of it. He found a couple of his older, softer leather belts, and a couple neckties, just in case. This. This is where he would truly put Sherlock through his paces, and the thought of mounting him at the end of it like a prized stallion and riding the hell out of that gorgeous arse... John shuddered and tossed the extra bindings on the bed, turning just as his stallion walked a little dazedly into the room. His room was spartan, he knew that; didn't even have a rug for his boy to kneel on. Too bad. He wouldn't be down there long anyway.
“Sir? You said if I was good while you bound me you'd reward me.” It wasn't quite telling his Sir what to do, was it? Sir smiled.
“I'm here, John,” he murmured softly, “I'm here.” His eyes closed, his breathing evening out almost immediately as he started to drift off. John watched him for a moment before lying down beside him, pulling the man into his arms and resting with him. Sherlock's green eyes opened just for a moment, locking with John's, and he smiled softly. John closed his eyes, drifting off himself, and felt Sherlock press a kiss to his throat. “I'm here.”
“I suppose I can amuse myself by counting how many seconds constitutes 'not too long' for one John Hamish Watson.” Emphasizing. Every. Syllable. John ground his teeth, eyes narrowed and waited. “Fine, fine, I'll count in my head.” With a final, semi-dignified huff, he settled in to count in his head and John turned back and continued typing.
Keeping his tongue lapping at the head of John's cock, he raised his eyes to look at the other man's face. John's blue eyes burned, half lidded as they were, with desire and power, and Sherlock felt his skin rise into bumps all over again, felt his nipples tighten painfully at the magnitude of that look. All this, and he hadn't even truly begun. He held eye contact as he slowly took John's cock into his mouth, almost down his throat, and hollowed his cheeks as he rose back to the head, intensifying the suction. John moaned, long and loud, tossing his head back, and so Sherlock did it again, and again, slowly, never quickening, down and back up.
Aroused by John, by what John was saying and doing. His mind automatically wanted to ask questions. Was it just the domination that had him hard as a steel pole? Just the submission? Bloody hell. It was a Pandora's box he wasn't sure he wanted opened, but he had to know.
“That's it boy, take it! Let me hear you. Take every inch of my cock and give me all those lovely, filthy sounds.” John planted his fists in the mattress to either side of his boy's hips and rode him hard, just as he'd imagined, making skin slap against damp skin and forcing his cock as deep as his boy could take him. Even then, Sherlock lifted his arse higher, trying to take him deeper. John balanced on one arm, grabbing a fist full of his boys hair and pulling, forcing him to arch harder. He wrapped his other arm around his boy's chest, laying along his back and over his bound hands, using his whole body to fuck into him. John used his weight to press Sherlock into the mattress and change the angle of his thrusts until he felt his cock brush over the bump he was looking for. He nailed it again, and again, harder. His boy screamed out, inner muscles fluttering around his Sir's cock as he came dry for the fourth time.
“If you fail to follow any of my commands, we stop. Period. No punishments, no second chances. Understood?” More command, more relief. Oh, yes.
“You, Sir,” came the quiet answer. John's jaw dropped. But...
“Again!” John shouted, biting at his boy's back. “Let me hear how much you want it! Beg for it! Beg for your Sir to come inside you, to fill you up with it!”
John growled, the grip on Sherlock's hair tightened, and he thrust faster, harder. Deeper. Deep enough to make Sherlock gag and John pulled back and stopped immediately with the head of his cock just inside. Sherlock lifted his eyes dazedly, searching out John's and finding them holding a question;
“Yes, Sir,” Sherlock whimpered, “I'll be good. Sir's good boy.” Sir shuddered above him and bit down on the skin of his shoulderblade.
“Shut. Up. Sherlock.” There! There was the spine, there was the fire, and the command in John's tone and the way his grip had tightened around Sherlock's wrist sent a flood of cool relief and a thrill through him that almost took his breath away. Sherlock gave him an infinitesimal smile, and John returned an equally infinitesimal nod.
“Sherlock, tell me this means something. Really means something.” His voice was a rough, cracked whisper. “Not just Sir and boy, but... but John and Sherlock. Tell me...” John pressed his forehead between Sherlock's shoulder blades, panting, trembling, waiting for affirmation. Sherlock was at a loss.
“Sir, Sir please...” his voice was a broken whisper through clenched teeth as he tried to maintain control, and he felt Sir tense behind him. “Sir I'm going to come, don't let me come, please. I don't want to come yet and-” Suddenly Sir wrapped his arms around him and his balls were yanked down in a harsh pull that made him cry out as Sir's other hand clamped firmly around the base of his boys cock. It burned, to have been thwarted when he was so close, but the relief he felt rush through him brought tears to his eyes. He sagged back against Sir and felt the man's arms tighten around him, felt his lips brush the nape of his boy's neck.
“Yes, Sir.” Sherlock's voice had gone rough as he undid the button, and oh so carefully lowered the zip, pulling his trousers open wide and lowering his red briefs even more carefully to expose John's cock and heavy balls. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, just the visual of him exposed like this before Sherlock's pretty lips had his balls tingling.
“Yes, Sir. Amazing. Please, please don't stop. I want it to be as you said. Please?” He begged, because Sir had told him he liked that before. Sir shook his head and groaned.
“That's it! That's it, boy! Fly for me. Such a good boy. Good boy...Oh...
“That's what I thought.” John moved down his boy's body, kissing and rubbing and petting along the way, giving Sherlock a breather before he did what he'd fantasized about for ages. He paused, making his boy crane his neck to look at him, making dazed eye contact just before he licked his boy's straining cock from the cotton bandage tie around its base to the leaking, rosy tip. His boy gave him the most exquisite sounds, dulcet moans and breathy cries as John teased his cock, flicked his tongue across the head, licked up the precome from his slit then sucked him down. His boy groaned in agonized rapture, bucking hard, coming for him again, and goddamn that was an amazing thing to be the cause of. John humped his own leaking cock against Sherlock's legs, reveling in the feel of the soft hairs and hard bone against his aching prick and tight balls. He kissed and suckled around his boy's cock and hips, soaking up every sound his boy gave him.
All Sherlock felt was wonder. He stared at John's hand on his wrist and with that contact everything in Sherlock just... stopped. His mind was silenced. At
“Sherlock, I think I can help you.” John swallowed thickly, and Sherlock followed the movement of his throat before returning to his eyes to find more heat and slightly dilated pupils. “I think I know a way to calm your mind. Give you a... a break from it.” His voice was slightly rougher, but still soft like the blue of his eyes, almost hypnotic. Sherlock was fairly certain he knew where this conversation was going. There was a reason Irene Adler had piqued his interest, after all. Ironically enough, this man was the primary reason he hadn't genuinely pursued her.
” John groaned aloud, planted an open mouthed kiss against his skin, and with that, Sir split his boy's arse open and thrust his cock inside.
“John?”
“Yes, Sir? That's it? No questions, no objections, nothing, boy?”
“But... but Sir. I-”
“Yes, Sir. I won't come, I promise.” Sherlock felt a smile against his shoulder, and then Sir was back to work. He pulled the improvised rope tight enough to bind but not cut in, going around his waist and taking it wide down the side of his hip so that it wrapped again at upper thighs; leaving his cock, balls and arse completely open. Sherlock groaned at the realization, and he heard a dark chuckle from his feet where his Sir was looping the end of the robe belts around the center of the necktie that bound his ankles, tightening it, but also padding the bones as he tied it off. As Sir rose to his feet before him, holding his boy steady with both hands stroking lightly up his flanks then to his shoulders, Sherlock's eyes nearly teared up again at the passion and adoration he saw in his Sir's eyes.
would be true domination. His boy would be truly, genuinely helpless to his whim, and John knew he was winging it, but between his medical and military training he could recognize signs of stress versus true fear. Excitement versus panic. John stood there and appraised him a moment, just because he could. Not saying a word. Giving nothing away. Just stoically marveling over the other man's exquisite body. His boy started to fidget a little, and John decided he'd looked his fill.
“I'm going to flip you over now, boy, and take a taste of that gorgeous arse.” John growled the warning and gave his boy a moment to let that sink in, so he could safe word if necessary. All John heard was more whimpering, pleading moans, and so he carefully maneuvered Sherlock onto his belly. He pulled his pillow down from the head of bed and tapped his boy's hip. “Raise up a bit. I want that lovely arse in the air.” His boy moaned and did as he bade, flexing his body and raising his hips just enough for John to shove the pillow between his pelvis and the mattress, then helped Sherlock adjust so his cock was comfortably pressed into it. John had to grab his cock and mentally recite the names of all the bacterium he could remember. The sight of that pale, lanky body, his boy's body,
“You're such a good boy, so good.” Sherlock basked in the praise. Sir then took two thin neckties and bound his arms behind his back, forearms overlapping a bit and resting just above his arse; tight enough to bind, but not pull his shoulders too much. A third necktie bound his ankles together loosely and he looked at his Sir questioningly. Sir smirked. “Patience, boy. It's loose now, now but it won't be by the time I'm done.” Sir took such good care of his boy. Sir lifted his boy's face to peer into his eyes and Sherlock noticed again what a beautiful blue they were. “How are you, boy? So far so good?” Oh gods, it was so good. So much better than- “Answer up, boy,” Sir barked. He thought he had.
Murmuring praise, he let the shaking in both of them subside a bit before pushing himself up. Sherlock mewled as John's cock slipped from his body in a wet gush and John couldn't keep himself from spreading his boy's arse open just to watch the fluid trickle from his hole. It was depraved as hell, and felt so dirty but in the best way, and his boy just moaned and clenched, trying to keep that bit of his Sir in. John had the presence of mind, barely, to release the belt buckle on the back of Sherlock's left shoulder, slackening the entire restraint before pulling the tie at his arms off and leaning back to untie his boy's ankles, tossing the whole mess to the floor. He got up on shaking legs and got a wet cloth from the privy to clean his boy with, helping him turn over off of the soaked pillow, tossing that to the floor as well. He'd have to replace that, he thought with a slow grin. He stroked Sherlock's chest, pulling a sheet up over both of their cooling bodies.
“So tight, boy. So good.” He gave an involuntary shudder as his boy's muscles clenched around him at the words. “You like that don't you, boy? You like hearing how good you make your Sir feel. You're burning hot inside, and so tight around me I can almost feel your heartbeat all around my cock.” John rasped the words into the skin of his boy's back. “It feels like you were made just for this. Just for me.” His boy groaned and shuddered, reduced to mindless utterances and babble. John chuckled as he withdrew and Sherlock whined a bit at the loss, then cried out as his Sir thrust hard back inside, impaling him over and over.
“Yes I thin-” Sherlock cut him off.
“Sir, Sir I feel like...I'm going to come.” John shuddered as the pitch of his boy's cries escalated at the continued assault on his nipples and unrelenting grinding on his cock. “Sir... Si-
And Sherlock meant it, too. He'd trusted John Watson with his life. He trusted his Sir implicitly with everything else. That's what he was now, too. John Watson was not in this room. No, this was Sir. His Sir, and that thought warmed him from his core. He floated to his feet when ordered, positioned himself accordingly when ordered, stood perfectly still as his Sir's skilled, knowledgeable hands did exactly as promised. Sir started with two linked, butter-soft leather belts around his upper shoulders, tight enough to bind, and bite just enough to be delicious when he flexed to test it. Sir ensured the buckles were not placed where they would dig, a consideration Sherlock himself had not even thought of, and it made him smile, which in return made Sir smile.
“Right, then. Sit back on your heels. Shuck the robe, too. I want to see all that glorious skin.” Sherlock complied, eagerly almost, allowing the robe to pool around him on the floor like a slinky dress off a woman. This was much, much better though. John admired all that milk glass skin turned rosy with desire, the pebbled nipples, and the gooseflesh that burst forth all over his skin at John's obvious appraisal. It was warm enough in the flat, so he knew the reaction had nothing to do with the temperature of the room. After he'd looked his fill, he stepped forward, widening his stance to straddle the other man's knees a bit, and began unbuckling his belt, watching Sherlock's reaction carefully. The man licked his lips, and his eyes stayed on the bulge that was now just about mouth level. “You do the rest. Take my cock out, and if I feel even a hint of zipper, we're through.” God this was better than even the best fantasies he could come up with.
“Say something, Sherlock.” John's voice was barely more than a rough whisper. “Tell me what's going though your mind right now.” Sherlock nearly laughed at that, but levity had no place in a moment like this.
“I haven't got that far yet into punishm-”
“I did that. I commanded it out of you, took that control from you, too. Are you arguing with your Sir and what he wants from his boy?” John kept his tone low and harsh and he felt Sherlock tremble beneath him.
“We're not in our proper places are we?” John asked as he stood, forcing Sherlock to back further onto the rug. “Go grab the union jack pillow and bring it right back here.” Oh, oh God, it was even better than Sherlock had expected. That commanding tone in that familiar voice was like a live wire straight to his cock, and the pyjammas wouldn't be able to hide his reaction much longer.
“On your knees again, boy.” The sharp tone made Sherlock wince again, but he went to his knees with another wince, since this time there was no pillow. John waited a moment for him to settle, expecting a request for a pillow, or something to put between his knees and the hardwood floor, but none came. His boy knelt, head bowed as before, without complaint, and he did look amazing there; naked, waiting on his knees for his Sir's orders. “Pick your head up, face your Sir.” John didn't miss the jump of the other man's cock at the command as he looked up. “Good boy. I need to see your face for the things I'm about to explain, understand?”
John leaned down over his boy for another kiss, with a stern warning in his eyes before they closed and he pressed his lips softly against Sherlock's again, and when his boy's lips stayed shut, John thrust his tongue into his boy's mouth and plundered it heartily. This time he didn't back away when Sherlock took a little initiative and delved his own tongue into John's mouth. Instead, John sucked at it, and his boy gasped in a breath and exhaled a moan so sweet that John just had to keep at it. John kept kissing him breathless, twining their tongues... then pulled back so abruptly he got a good look at the pleasure he'd given his boy, before the shock at his departure took over and he nearly broke down laughing.
“Sherlock?” No immediate answer, footsteps still retreating across the flat. “Sherlock?” Slightly louder, but still with the pacing and muttering. Finally John turned in his chair. “Sherlock!” The man in question jumped as if he'd been startled. Of course he'd been startled. When he paced like this he was entirely self-focused. The rest of the world could implode around him and he'd still be pacing in the rubble and wondering where it came from.
Sherlock felt drunk and high and stoned all at once and all in the most delicious of ways. He was finally, finally free of his mind, and the relief brought tears to his eyes. As Sir got him laid out on the bed he noticed the tears and his eyebrows went up in surprise then furrowed in concern. His boy shook his head and smiled before Sir could worry. He never wanted Sir to worry about his boy. Then Sir disappeared for a moment, returning to kneel beside him on the bed. Sherlock felt his Sir wrap a thin strip of what felt like cotton cloth around the base of his cock and tie it. It was tight, but just on the edge of painful, and he knew Sir had done it purposefully. Sir knew his boy well.
“Explain. No lies or this ends now.” John barked a little sharper than he'd intended. Sherlock's head snapped up at his tone, eyes locking with his own. Bewildered, yes, but John saw nothing but naked honesty in the jade depths. Maybe Sherlock was banking something on John's answers as well.
“By me. By my domination over you? Or your submission in general? Or...” John cut himself off, not daring to voice his hope.
” John trembled as he felt his boy stiffen and buck beneath him, but he felt no wet heat against his abdomen as he kept up the pressure. He'd known Sherlock's mind was powerful enough for this. He looked up at the ecstasy and wide eyed confusion on his boy's face.
“Good boy, very good.” John purred, gut clenching at just the thought of his next command. “Now, suck me.”
“S-Sir!... Sir...
“Good boy, now grab the pillow and stand before me.” Normally being called 'good boy' would've been a burr to his pride, but the way John said it made it feel like the caress of a praising hand, and it made him shudder and hardened his cock further; definitely no hiding it now. He grabbed the pillow and then stood before John, as dictated. John just stood there, looking at him speculatively. What was he waiting for? As Sherlock looked him over, he noticed a pronounced bulge in the front of the man's trousers. Was that bulge from the domination, or Sherlock's submission, or was it for Sherlock himself? When he looked back up and made eye contact, Sherlock knew he'd been caught ogling, and for the first time in a long time he felt heat bloom in his cheeks.
John's body took over and he gave in to it. His whole body seized, pushing his pulsing cock deeper and deeper into his boy as his orgasm went on and on, wave after wave of mind numbing euphoria whiting out his senses until he was spent. Still his body rocked and thrust, unable and unwilling to stop as his boy whimpered and trembled, and
“Please! Please, Sir! Please come inside me? Please shoot your hot come deep in my arse?” His boy's cries intensified. “Please, fill me up, Sir? Please? Please!” Mindlessly begging now, just the way John wanted him. Keeping one hand in his boy's hair, his other hand worked its way between Sherlock's body and the pillow, tugging on the end of the quick release knot he'd used to secure the cotton strip around his boy's cock.
“I wont laugh.” John replied, resting his hand on his fist with his elbow on his knee, looking at the older boy intently.
“I am.” Sherlock smirked, typing his searches into google, a minor thing by any stretch of the imagination but if he was correct in his suspicion, it could be vital for one of the case files he’d stolen from Lestrade.
They were silent for the rest of the journey, Greg payed the cabbie when they arrived at the station. There was a pause and a held breath of apprehension before they went in.
“Doctor aren’t you?”
To say he was nervous was an understatement, he was worried about his parent’s opinions on Greg and Greg’s opinions on his parents, and all the possibilities were circulating in his head, churning like a tormented sea.
“Of course, darling.” Sherlock pressed a kiss to the nape of John’s neck, as the doctor leant back into him. His body was shaking slightly, he was crying, and Sherlock let him. One arm was around his waist, the palm of his hand under the hoodie, against the flat of John’s stomach, pressing warmth into it. His other hand was in John’s hair, drawing patterns into his scalp gently with his fingertips.
“Hm?”
“And that would be?”
pain.
“For the years that I’ve lived here, I’ve kept this part of me away from you. You saw me as John Watson, the army doctor. And now- after this- what will you see then? Abby Watson the tranny that can’t even do a shot by himself.”
Confusion and embarrassment flashed across Greg’s features before a forced smile followed them. “Okay…” He replied, and Mycroft felt him watching him as he walked away briskly.
If he could’ve just kept his cool.
"Hm?" Sherlock replied, the hum of his voice vibrating against John's neck.
“Wanker!”
It would be a lie to say he didn’t still want to be a doctor. But now he was in a wizarding school, free from biology and chemistry, so he couldn’t. There was no hope in hell of him being a healer, he was more likely to kill a patient than make them better when it came to magic.
“I’m surprised you’d know, you were barely human when I met you.” Sherlock rolled his eyes at that, knowing John didn’t mean it.
“I didn’t mean any of it. He’s my best friend, Mike. I was just upset.”
The room was completely dishevelled, even his bed, tipped on its side, pages torn from books and ink splattered on the walls. Sherlock was hunched into himself, back against the wall, his face pressed into his knees, hands stained black and covering his ears.
“Pain in the everywhere, last we spoke.” Sherlock remarked, smiling to himself as John chuckled. “You’ll get used to it again, if not there are more options, birth control, ovariohysterectomy.”
“How heartless would that make me? Off jamming to Weird Sisters when my best mate’s being sick in the Slytherin loo. I have to have heart for two around you, count.” He jabbed his fingers into Mycroft chest, and the prefect rolled his eyes.
He appreciated that Johns opinion of him had never faltered, not when he was accused, not when he had to protest, not when they locked him in solitude.
“Why’d you leave then?” He avoided Johns question, he didn’t know why he was so persistent on the matter, he’d figure that out later when he was sifting through his mind palace.
That term was rather new to Sherlock. He’d never had a best friend before John, he’d never had a
“Obviously.”
She pursed her lips in annoyance, before she gave up on her retort. “He will be alright Mr. Holmes.”
“John?” He was shaking now, quiet sobs falling from his lips, Sherlock pushed himself up and rushed over quickly. Sherlock took John by the shoulders, his grip firm yet not aggressive, he turned the other boy to face him. Tears were streaking down the Gryffindor’s face “John what is it?”
John felt his chest collapse in on itself, as Sherlock stood up, offering him a hand. He took it shakily, trying to come to terms with what was happening.
Sherlock Holmes wasn’t the type of person you’d expect to be cuddly. He was sharp in every place imaginable, face, shoulders, elbows, personality, cunning and wit.
He wouldn’t lie and say he hadn’t thought about talking to him before. Seeing him every day across the playground as he waited for his class to line up was tempting, it would be so easy for him to walk over and attempt to strike up a conversation. He always stood prim and proper, in suits that looked somewhat expensive, and he liked to watch, observe might be the word, everyone else in the playground.
Sherlock was nearly certain he didn’t like girls in general. There had been one in his transfiguration class who was quite pretty, though she was a lot older than him and infuriating in her attempts to be clever. He’d since written off any attraction he thought he may have felt to jealousy, she was fairly good at transfiguration after all.
