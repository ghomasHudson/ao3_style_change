John smiles softly. He straightens up and smooths out the creases on his sleeves. “Thank you, Sherlock. So do you, as always. Are you ready to go then?”
With a deep breath, he marches back through the door and back to the corner of the room to where John is hunched over his shrieking brother, broken glass and litter all around them. He crouches down beside John.
Mycroft dips his head and asks again with his eyes. Softly. Genuinely.
The conversation repeats itself several times over. Each call with a different agent, a different undercover organisation. It seems she has more friends in the field than she remembers. Slowly, she is able to tick off more and more locations from her list.
“Couldn’t sleep,” Mycroft says, wrinkles lining his temples as he gives one of his patronising smiles. “Although clearly, you two didn't have any trouble.”
"Go on." John prompted gently.
The voice echoes in his ears several times. Everything shakes. Trembles. He tries to open his eyes but when he does the world is sideways, an endless stretch of orange sand. There’s figures running in the distance. Blurred, wavering. Dressed in light camouflage gear. Sounds come rushing back to him quickly, much faster than his vision. Gunshots.
John takes a sharp step back, genuine shock and astonishment flaring in his eyes. He looks appalled. Devastated and impressed. All at the same time. Sherlock cocks an eyebrow.
This isn't a game anymore.
Sherlock is the first one to speak and break the stillness.
"Ah," Sherlock gags, instinctively crying out in English this time. "Please stop!"
And all of a sudden Mary can’t stand it any longer. The arguing, the waiting. Not
He hovers awkwardly for a moment before sitting back into one of the uncomfortable plastic chairs and pulling up his sleeve to check his watch. 4.49am. How long have they got? An hour? Maybe two if they’re lucky?
. So fast the driver must have floored the accelerator. It all happens so quick that she doesn’t even get the chance to see his face.
“You’re not mad…” he said in disbelief.
“You have my blanket permission to experiment on any of my jumpers,” John blurted out, thrusting his chin up and linking his hands behind his back in an ‘at ease’ stance.
More notes at the end of Chapter.
They finally settle into their relationship and John confronts Sherlock about the scars on his back.
For the second time that evening, Sherlock begins to hide behind an uncaring mask until John gently reaches out and grabs the detective’s wrist and quietly pleads, “No, please, Sherlock. Don’t do that. Don’t hide from me. I know that’s what you are doing. I understand now.” To John’s relief the mask slips away and John receives a brief look into what Sherlock is truly feeling. For a moment, John can see all the fear and sadness behind the cold exterior, the heart behind the machine. For once, Sherlock drops the act and looks utterly miserable.
The sleuth suddenly looks up from his laptop and loudly declares that he needs his cellphone. When Sherlock doesn't move to get it himself John takes the hint and stands to retrieve Sherlock's phone, which lay right in front of him, but not before muttering something along the lines of, "Lazy sod," and a few insults that were said mostly said in adoration and good humor. When the detective and phone are reunited, long violinist fingers scroll through his contacts before clicking on one and a message is sent.
Briefly, a surprised look crosses the detective’s face at the unexpected French terminology, but the expression quickly passes as Sherlock fondly rolls his eyes, grabs his coat and scarf, and follows the D.I. and his beautiful threadmate.
The case ends with a bullet piercing through glass then embedding into a decaying body, a whispered name, a dead cabbie, and giggles behind yellow police tape. They had a moment where both men looked at the other and all laughter had ceased. Sherlock cleared his throat and looked away. John felt his face heat up with the realization that he had began leaning forward. His entire body went rigid and the cold truth seeped into him when he realized that he was thoroughly enamored by this captivating man. '
Of course nothing can be hidden from Mycroft Holmes. He noticed instantly that something was amiss and whilst Sherlock was distracted, he had a member from the staff to go through Sherlock's things. They found the blades and brought them to Mycroft. When Mycroft had discovered what Sherlock had done, the resulting row was legendary. Mycroft threatened to have him servalenced for every hour on end, he berated Sherlock most of the time, and finally asked him, "What in the hell are you thinking?!" For the first time during the argument, Sherlock looks up at him. "I was thinking that I hate my life, I hate myself, and no one else likes me either. I'm tired of living this way." Mycroft looks at Sherlock with stunned silence and Sherlock walks away.
smoking gun. The only thing that would have made it any more obvious was if the suspect in question had worn a neon sign that flashed
And waited.
Once John had returned to full health, however, Sherlock resumed devising ways to get him dressed up. Having realised they didn't work, he stopped accepting invitations for client parties, and he couldn’t rely on another wedding invitation arriving. It was time to take matters into his own hands.
Harry was the first one to make a toast, followed by Greg and even Mycroft. When someone yelled ‘First dance!’, John and Sherlock stepped onto the wooden platform. After a long debate they’d had about a song for their first dance, it had occurred to John that Sherlock wasn’t keen on modern music, and despised songs that had little to no instruments in them. In frustration, John had yelled for Sherlock to compose something and as if a light bulb had switched on above Sherlock’s head, he had grabbed his violin and played for ten hours straight until he’d created the waltz they were now dancing to.
It’s time for John and Sherlock to stand in front of their friends and family to exchange vows.

“Ahhhh, Sherlock!” John’s shout drowned Sherlock’s words. He arched, thrusting one more time into Sherlock’s fist before he let the oncoming orgasm wash over him in a wave of heat. His grip on Sherlock became more erratic, his movements chaotic as he came on his own chest and abdomen, pistoning into his lover’s fist.
“I now pronounce you married!” Mike exclaimed, his cheeks pink, his eyes full of happiness. Cheers erupted and John cupped Sherlock’s face to plant a sweet, chaste kiss on his lips. As he was pulling away, Sherlock placed a hand on John’s back and head respectively, pulling him closer before dipping him back to deepen the kiss. John yelped but within a breath, melted into the kiss, letting himself be held, letting himself be kissed by…
“Sherlock?”
“I definitely am,” he said calmly, then closed his eyes and leant back in the chair as if getting lost in his Mind Palace or napping or just… whatever Sherlock did.
“Let’s eat!” Angelo yelled, turning attention away from all the Holmeses. Yes, John was a Holmes now too. The thought made him beam all the way to the table as Margaret directed the guests towards their seats.
As gasps, laughter and applause erupted, John swivelled on his heel to see Greg holding the flower.
“You reek!” John recoiled, scrunching his nose the moment Sherlock entered 221B.
Smiling with trembling lips, John slid the smaller ring on Sherlock’s slender finger and looked up through the haze of emotionally unstable salt in his eyes. He tried holding himself together, but when his eyes landed on Sherlock’s pink cheeks and fat tears streaming down them, he let his own tears fall.
Sherlock’s curls were damp, the droplets of water dripping over the collar of the dark blue dressing gown he wore, suggested he’d taken a shower. The stench was almost aired from the room thanks to the open windows and a scented candle on the coffee table. Sherlock could do amazing domestic things if he put his mind to it.
“You’re the reason why I’d never be lost. Not in my mind, not in the world — because you, my conductor of light, always show me the way. Now, in front of our family and other people who tolerate us for some reason, I vow to annoy you, infuriate you, and pester you till the end of my life.”
John swallowed hard as his cock twitched in reply to the words, his body tingled with readiness to turn over and devour Sherlock, to bring him pleasure by kissing him, teasing, touching… But that was not what Sherlock had asked for.
“We haven’t been out of the country for ages,” Anderson prattled on. “But the beaches alone make it impossible not to travel this —”
“Touch me,” Sherlock said, his voice low and husky, hitting John’s brain like champagne full of bubbles.
“You’re eating it as if you could lick it off —”
“Yes,” John laughed heartily, placing a chaste kiss on Sherlock’s cheek. “I know.”
“That’s what you gave me the ticket for.” The ‘duh, dummy’ was silent but clear in her tone.
They cleaned up fast and John headed straight into the kitchen to take out everything they had in the fridge. He arranged it on the kitchen counter and stood with his hands on his hips, examining the display. Between baking soda, olive oil, milk and eggs, there was not much to pick from.
“Seriously? You?” John scoffed, shoving the tickets back into the envelope and gently tossing them onto the coffee table.
“Mmmm now I know what to do to make you eat.” John nuzzled Sherlock's cheek playfully, his body and brain still in a happy bubble.
“Are you planning on going to this?” He asked John, who was sat in his chair, nursing a cup of tea. John looked up and squinted to read the invitation Sherlock was holding up.
Sherlock hoovered up the eggs in no time, then took the plain toast John had made to go with the eggs and started slathering honey on it.
“I’ll only end up redoing it.” Lestrade replied, practically shoving Sherlock out of the door.
He’d known for a while that he was interested in John, and the incident in court had only confirmed it. There was a part of him that was sure John felt a similar way, but there was too much conflicting evidence to be sure. Perhaps this event would be a good way to find out.
Mike was waiting for them under the arch in a sharp, white suit and a battered notebook in hand. Sherlock couldn’t seem to let go of John’s hand even after they reached the small podium and faced Mike, so John held on even tighter to assure Sherlock it was okay not to let go. To never let go, if that was what he wanted. They dictated the rules; it was their wedding after all. With a flourish, the music stopped and as Mycroft joined Sherlock’s side, Harry stood next to John, nodding once, wordlessly telling him that his big sister was there to support him.
John spread the lube with a languorous caress, his thumb circling the crown before he resumed a firmer grip and let his fist glide up and down. He twisted his wrist on the upstroke, the way he liked it himself, and noticed Sherlock was doing the same. He’d been mirroring John’s movements for the last several moments.
Fuck, he had fucked up.
With an air of mischief, he dipped a finger into the icing of the cake. The absolute horror that crossed Sherlock's face was so hilarious, it fueled John to act quickly. He booped Sherlock’s nose, leaving a smear of icing on it. Sherlock gasped audibly then his eyes bounced from John to the cake and back.
“Okay okay, Mr Sassy, I’ll make you tea. You’re shivering.”
“Out? Where?”
With a plate in one hand and tea in the other, John entered the room to see Sherlock splayed face-first on the sofa with one foot still on the floor — a picture of a man exhausted by his work. John sighed with relief at the sight. Food could wait. When it came to Sherlock, sleep took priority after days of little to no sleep.
Sherlock lifted his head in a sharp motion — clearly done with the laying down thing he disliked — looked down their bodies, and scrunched his nose.
“That might be nice.” Sherlock feigned indifference, but inside, his stomach was curling in on itself with anticipation. There was no way John could get away with not wearing a suit to a wedding.
John and Sherlock Watson-Holmes attend their first Pride Parade in London.
“What did you do, John?” Sherlock narrowed his eyes, surely observing every minute detail about John and deducing the life out of him. “Where’s my coat?”
“If you stand up carefully enough, you won’t stain the sheets,” Sherlock said, lifting his hand off John with the same air he would handle a rotten lab specimen.
“Hi, I need this coat cleaned by tomorrow,” he said, hoisting the bag onto the counter with a thump.
“Yes, John. Come with my hand on your cock and know that I will ask you for more. I’ll ask you to fuck me until I scre —”
“No, they shouldn’t.”
The sound of Sherlock's voice telling John how he wanted to be pleasured, combined with Sherlock’s grip, spiked John’s libido. He threw his head back, feeling heat coursing through him, the tiny tingles that indicated he was closer and closer, familiar, yet so much more intense when brought by Sherlock’s touch.
Unfortunately, the freshly caught criminal from their most recent case begged to differ. It was the most open and shut case Sherlock had seen in the past few years; It was hard to argue that you had nothing to do with a murder when all of the evidence said the contrary. There were two separate eyewitnesses, and a
“Yes, John, groceries. I’ll do some online shopping. Don’t get too excited.” Sherlock huffed, opening the can of tea.
With a soft snort, John turned the hob off and took a step towards his flatmate. His hand fit on Sherlock’s silk-clad hip as if it was meant to be there when he stood on tiptoes to place a soft kiss on Sherlock’s lips. The detective smiled with approval and a hint of smugness, then sat down to his food.

The following morning, he found Sherlock curled on his side on the sofa and still dead to the world. Smelling the fragrance of
As John and Sherlock are deep into planning their simple wedding, Sherlock takes John to his favourite tailor.
A different girl greeted him at the cleaners although she could have been her sister by the looks of her clothes and her jaw working some bubble gum.
“You? Get groceries?” John didn’t even attempt to hide his surprise.
This time, even John chuckled softly, then cleared his throat, which had a gigantic lump in it.
“Since when do we go to the ballet?”
“Then what are you waiting for,
“I’m hungry,” Sherlock said, somewhat surprised and John turned his head to see a frown on his face.
When they appeared in the wide-open doors to the garden, Sherlock nodded once to his brother, who nodded back, as if they were giving signals before a heist. Mycroft straightened his back, thrust his chin up and placed his hands on the ivory keys.
“Where are your shades?” John asked, seeing Sherlock squint against the early June sun.
“The ballet?”
He was smiling but it was the man next to him who blushed twelve shades of red. Mycroft’s gaze was blank, his eyes a bit too wide, but his shoulders relaxed the moment Greg touched his elbow and said something in a quiet tone meant for Mycroft only.
“Oh, I didn’t know that.”
“I’m sorry.” John replied quickly, but his voice seemed genuine. They’d never talked about their childhood’s much, both holding their own secrets close to their chests. Sherlock had deduced a lot about John’s family, and though he wasn’t an expert in human behaviour, he knew enough not to pry. Besides, there wasn’t anything else he needed to know. He knew this version of John, the one that solved crimes and lived at Baker Street, and that was the John Watson he loved. Whoever he was before was irrelevant.
Sherlock blew on the steam of his tea and met John’s gaze over the rim of his mug. The twinkle in his eye flickered for just a split second, and John caught it only because he knew Sherlock so well. Then it hit him.
“What? Why?” John asked with the eloquence of a drunk.
(See the end of the chapter for
Seeing that the conversation was over, John dropped the topic. Clearly, Sherlock didn’t care for his sheets as much as he’d let on if he’d genuinely consider playing with honey.
“Excellent deduction, John,” Sherlock said flatly, rolling his eyes.
The fic was inspired by this wonderful
The girl prodded it with a long, pink fingernail and pulled back with a grimace as the bag released a puff of foul odour at her touch.
He kicked the duvet to their ankles, popped the cap of the lube open, and poured a dollop on John’s left hand, then his right, his movements quick and efficient.
“Squeeze a little harder,” came Sherlock’s low growl. “Oh just like that… now slow down...that’s it.”
Chapter written by Enterthetadpole
“Yes, the ring was in the skip two streets away from the victim’s flat. I texted Lestrade and he called his dogs. My work is done.” A smug expression formed on his face as he smoothed the lapels of his coat, brushing off a piece of rotten lettuce that had been stuck to it.
After their intimate encounter while isolated at 221B, Sherlock proposes taking a bath together.
By the time they came up for air, the light had faded. Shadows from the street below painted themselves on the ceiling, and the faint orange glow of the streetlights had started to seep through the glass.
The wonderful NitaElwy created beautiful art for chapter one!
“Should have known you'd leave me behind.”
“Don’t be. It was a long time ago.”
“Oh God Sherlock,” John moaned, the picture Sherlock had painted becoming vivid in his mind — Sherlock splayed on the bed, letting John suck his cock while he worked his fingers to milk the gorgeous man until he’d cry his name. “You’re gonna make me…”
“You found it, then?” John had been in the shower when Sherlock had had an epiphany, yelling ‘He made a mistake!’, before his footsteps had sounded on the stairs as he’d left to follow a clue.
“Well, I’m not ecstatic that — judging by your cuffs — you ran off to the nearest dry cleaners, which are pretty awful, as you’re perfectly aware by now, and inadvertently caused my coat to shrink. But there is not much we can do about it now, is there?” Sherlock finished his speed-talking and steepled his fingers under his chin.
“No, I brought a coat, a long coat for a tall adult and this… this would fit a ten-year-old.”
After doing the dishes and getting the kitchen back in order, he noticed that Sherlock hadn’t moved a muscle. Had he fallen asleep at the kitchen table? The breakfast was hardly big enough to induce a food coma.
Sherlock still emanated, John was half-surprised flies weren’t circling above him like tiny vultures over a corpse. With a nod of approval at the sleeping state (the smell he would deal with later), John repositioned the blankets over Sherlock and headed to the dry cleaners.
“Nothing, just — I wouldn’t have pegged you for a dancer.” John’s eyes flicked to Sherlock’s back, lingering a little too long along the crisp lines of his suit. Sherlock could feel John’s gaze burning into his skin and he shivered, briefly letting himself imagine John running his fingertips along his back, gently turning him and unbuttoning his shirt—
“Are you fingering yourself?”
The knot slipped from his fingers again, although this time out of absentmindedness rather than self-sabotage.
“I uh—” Sherlock cleared his throat, “I danced, as a child. My mother used to teach me.”
John stifled a giggle, as, hands intertwined, they took the first step onto the grass aisle together.
Slowly but deliberately, Sherlock moved their hands and placed them over his groin.
The tension built again, Sherlock desperately trying to refrain himself from deducing John’s hidden meaning. Not that it would get him far -- as much as he liked to pretend he could read minds, the skill still escaped him. Had John been penalised for who he’d been involved with? Sherlock had long suspected that John was not entirely straight; his botched flirting attempt at Angelo’s had shown him as much, but whether John had accepted it was another question entirely. There was a frustrating lack of evidence to support either side — John had never brought men home, nor had he ever mentioned being anything other than heterosexual. Still, there had been the stolen looks across the room, stretching eternities of eye-sex that had Sherlock melting at the knees.
With a friendly smile, John placed his ticket on the counter. After a glance at the number, the girl reached for one of the transparent, plastic bags on hangers behind her, and handed it to John. A fresh-linen, lovely smell wafted off of it when he took it and an image of a smiling, thankful Sherlock, accepting the gift of a freshly-cleaned coat appeared in his head. Sherlock would be so happy.
“...shrunk.”
John smiled at the thought that he didn’t have to wonder whether Sherlock was naked underneath it anymore. He could just ask without the fear of upsetting him or setting their friendship on fire. Letting the air of mystery hang, he turned to his detective.
“No cold feet?” John asked his fiancé.
Thank you all who followed this fic as a WIP and to all who read it after. <3 <3 <3
“Yeah, of course.”
?” The cheeky grin on Sherlock’s face remained just for a few moments longer, then disappeared along with their clothes and turned into an expression of desire, with parted lips that chanted John’s name.
Their lips were swollen and their bodies hot when they finally pulled away. John had to admit that he hadn’t had such a long snogging session since his teenage years. Every nerve in his body was alive; It was glorious.
“You need a new wardrobe and you gave me a perfect excuse to bully you into a shopping spree. Don’t worry, Mycroft’s buying. I relieved him of his Mastercard Titanium Card when he visited yesterday.“
“Sure. I can see to it myself.” The words sounded rehearsed as if they meant nothing to her. She fiddled with her crop top, popped the gum and punched in a code on the machine in front of her that coughed up a ticket. John would have never expected to see the 80’s fashion coming back, but by the look of the teens of London, of whom this girl was a perfect example, that was the case. Suddenly, an image of Sherlock in a crop top filled his mind, the tiny fabric exposing his flat stomach, the high-rise denim shorts accentuating the shape of his hips.
“Oh… am I being too pushy?” There was confusion in Sherlock’s tone.
Nothing was there. No recollection of any occasion in all of the times he and John had gone anywhere that John had worn anything more formal than fitted trousers and a new shirt. Even during John’s more invested dates he hadn’t worn more than a nice jumper. Sherlock scoured through his mind palace again for missing data. John must have steered his way through to a funeral or tolerated an office dinner party where a proper suit would have been the most appropriate outfit.
During a dinner at Angelo’s, Sherlock reveals the wedding bands to John.
“I hope they don’t expect us to cut all the cake,” Sherlock said,  grimacing.
The cheering quieted as two types of guests were revealed: those who whistled and those who cleared their throats with pointed discomfort.
John pulled away slowly, placing one last delicate kiss on Sherlock’s lips as they untangled themselves from each other.
“Behind the dresser,” Sherlock whispered back, gracing John with a fond side-eye glare.
“Eggs sound good,” Sherlock replied, pouring water into the kettle, the movements of his hands and long fingers mesmerising during the mundane task. John had to force his eyes away and back to the food. He’d found Sherlock’s body beautiful before, but now, after experiencing Sherlock’s hands on him, he could see how much of his prowess Sherlock managed to hide under the guise of a cold genius in a suit. “I can get groceries today.”
hung around his neck.
When they finally broke apart, John felt drunk on the kiss and the vows, but he wasn’t crying anymore. His face was split by a grin so huge his cheeks hurt, and when he looked to the side, he could see even Sherlock couldn’t stifle a smile in all his multi-chin glory.
“What’s with you lately? You seem to have an obsession with dressing up, anyone would think you had a thing for suits.”
“There. All done.” John gave the knot one last pull and went to take a half-step back, but Sherlock’s hands flew up and grabbed his wrists before he could move. He wanted to apologise, to make some lame excuse about why he’d moved involuntarily, but instead he stayed silent, his eyes finally settling on John’s. The doctor stayed quiet, holding Sherlock’s gaze without question. There was a pause, a silent exchange of confirmation before John’s hands pushed through Sherlock’s loose grip and came to rest on Sherlock’s cheeks. Sherlock could swear his skin set on fire beneath the touch, and it’s all he could do to stay still, to not lunge forward and take what he wanted.
“Sure, yeah,” John chuckled, hardly believing that he was looking forward to it. Then again, he’d have an opportunity to watch Sherlock try on suits and coats… Yes, that wouldn’t be such a hardship.
“Never mind. Are you ready?” He squeezed Sherlock's hand in return.
“John?”
“Moral support?” John chuckled. “I think I’ll be fine on that front, but you can come with me if you want.”
“Would you do the honours?” John motioned to the long knife which lay on the tray next to the cake.
It's a privilege to present the lovely art NitaElwy made for chapter 1!
“I’m fine,” Sherlock said, way too high pitched to be believed, so he cleared his throat and said it again. “I’m fine, John. Just...the rampant stupidity of this entire set of circumstances was a bit overwhelming, is all.”

“I mean —” was all John managed to say before a large palm filled with icing and cake landed in the middle of his face.
The squeeze of Sherlock's hand in his prompted him to turn.
“You like it too,” Sherlock said, then bit into the toast with a blissful expression on his face that made the tips of John’s ears go pink with a flush.
Sherlock’s baritone murmuring “Yes John, yes!” motivated him to keep going until he heard only hiccuped high notes from the detective. John’s muscles trembled as he watched Sherlock’s body arch — white ribbons shooting a foot into the air as the rest spilt over John’s hand. The sight was so beautiful it seemed to happen in slow motion, John’s brain drunk on endorphins, barely believing it was real.
The moment was broken; all the sparking tension filling the air dissipated, replaced by a solemn melancholy. Sherlock mentally kicked himself, wishing he’d just stayed silent. They didn’t do this. They were never the type of friends to delve into their pasts any further than last week, and there was no reason to start now.
“Mmm, oh yes,” John murmured, already focused on slow, rhythmic pumping.
“Oh John, that’s ingenious of you!” Sherlock exclaimed, his face lighting up with the new idea like a Christmas tree.
“Shrunk,” Sherlock said in a neutral tone, smacked his lips and placed two mugs of brewing tea on the table. “Sit, John.” He flared the tails of his dressing-gown like Batman himself and took a seat opposite.
“You really like honey, don’t you?” John noted, watching Sherlock drown his toast in the gooey substance.
“Good.”
He waited for enough of the colour to drain out of Anderson’s face before he continued. “It’s clear you’ve started sleeping with each other again within the past couple of months, judging by your improved wardrobe. At least this time she’s showing her gratitude on slightly plusher carpeting, going by the state of her knees.”
The time was nigh to get out of the tub after their first time together, but the dread of what was next lingered in both John and Sherlock.
“Um, probably. Will be nice to see everyone again.”
John shot through the streets and, by the skin of his teeth, made it in time by bursting through the glass door minutes before closing.
A flame ignited in Sherlock’s stomach as their lips met, and every tension in his body melted away. His hands dropped to John’s waist and pulled him closer, their mouths quickly opening against each other. John took control of the kiss, and Sherlock submitted under his touch, his fingers grasping for purchase in John’s shirt. Sherlock ran his tongue along John’s bottom lip and bathed in the shiver it elicited from John, wishing he could live in that moment forever.
So, the very idea of a trial was pointless. A complete waste of time that Sherlock could be using to finally get around to that experiment on how human blood reacts to various temperature changes. He’d already bought the flasks and emptied out the freezer.
“Here, let me.” John walked towards the mirror, pausing at Sherlock’s back and lifting one hand towards his neck. Sherlock turned, sucking in a small breath and trying to look anywhere but John’s face. He wasn’t sure he could keep himself together if they made eye contact whilst in such close proximity.
“It’s quite convenient that my prominent hand is my right and yours is left,” Sherlock observed matter-of-factly.
“You’re not serious,” John countered, knowing damn well that once Sherlock came up with an idea, there was no way anyone could convince him not to try it.
However, Lestrade only had the patience to have his texts ignored for a finite amount of time before he took the much more personal approach of demanding both Sherlock and John’s courthouse participation. It involved quite a lot of shouting and a few well-placed threats to not let Sherlock near anything close to a level six case or above ever again if he didn’t concede.
The sensation of John going into doctor mode was everywhere at once. Steady fingers gripped at his forearms as John peered into his eyes to check his dilation.
He wore just his boxers and a t-shirt, his bare feet cold on the kitchen floor when Sherlock came in wearing a slick, flowy dressing gown.
Thank you for following this fic as I kept adding chapters spread months apart. For now this is it (I do have 2 more drafted but as we're all coming out of lockdown, idk if updating it makes sense). It was my comfort fic to write during these weird times and I appreciate all of your support as I did so. I hope your many lockdowns and the time of pandemic passed in peace and health.  <3
“Yup,” Sherlock said simply, the stifled grin visible in the crinkle of his eyes as they took the stairs down.
“Since the English National Ballet started their production of
“We can’t have that, not when you were so excited to go. I’ll get changed, then we can head out.” John let his hands drop down to his sides and turned to walk upstairs, giving a smug glance over his shoulder as he reached the door.
“John?” Sherlock’s voice broke John from his thoughts.
The day before the wedding, John and Sherlock take a moment to talk after a week of crazy preparations.
“Every palace needs a king, and you, John Hamish Watson, are the king of my Mind Palace. You’ve been ruling it for years and doing so quite wisely for a doctor and a soldier. Or maybe that’s why it worked.”
John’s hands worked slowly, pulling the silk fabric into a presentable knot. Sherlock’s skin throbbed against his neck, his stomach clenching with excitement each time John’s skin brushed his own. Sherlock’s thoughts began to unravel, questioning himself for the millionth time, wondering if he was alone in his increasing fluster.
“You found it,” John said when Sherlock’s teeth grazed the blue garter on John’s thigh when they finally made it to the bed.
Sherlock’s bowtie had fallen undone again, hanging loose around his neck, and John’s hair was dishevelled. Sherlock smirked at the sight, a flicker of pride in his heart that he’d been the one to cause the mess.
With everything else in his life, Sherlock was always 100% sure. He collected the evidence, built a theory, and knew with utmost certainty that he was right. With John, things were different. He had evidence that John was interested, that the relationship unfurling between them was a lot more than platonic, but his brain second-guessed itself at every turn. The moment he thought he was sure, it felt as if the rug was pulled from beneath him, and he was left questioning himself once again.
Sherlock reached for the larger sized one that would fit John’s finger, took both of John’s hands and looked at him as if only the two of them existed.
Sherlock had been straddling John, holding on with his thighs as if John was about to become a  wild horse and try to shake the detective off. Now, as they were laying back, Sherlock’s hand was seeking John’s under the cover with a tentative air to it, as if he was considering what they’d just done or was lost in his Mind Palace recording the details. John captured it and squeezed, intertwining their fingers as his lips curved into a smile. His erection throbbed, needing attention; the tiny movements Sherlock had made while straddling John had left their mark. But John was determined to follow the pace Sherlock set and refused to ask for something Sherlock was unwilling to give.
"What? What do you mean?"
John rolled his eyes and returned to the kitchen.
0000000
"How else am I going to deduce what's going on with you currently? You don't seem to be able to tell me, so I need to find out another way. What ever happened to 'ooh, your deductions are brilliant, Sherlock, tell me how you did that?'"
"Sometimes an outsider sees more than those up close."
Not going to eat them. – SH
Nowhere near a shop? – SH
"It's about time you brought your friend over," he said, wrapping one around John's shoulders and planting a kiss on his cheek that shocked the doctor more than if Sherlock had punched him. He stuck his hand out to Jeremy. "Sherlock Holmes, John's colleague, friend, and live-in. And you are?"
John laughed, but his mirth was short lived. A familiar, but oddly off, voice was hailing him from the street and quickly approaching.
"You told her what to expect."
John had had a very nice time with Jeremy. The matchmaker had been right – they had a lot in common and got on very well. He was also finding that holding hands and now kissing someone of the same gender was just as, if not more, comfortable for him than when he had been dating women.
"I didn't put any on."
"Seriously, Sherlock, your ability to see everything around you is incredible," John sighed, sitting in his chair across from Sherlock's, "but not when you're aiming that ability at me. I'm sure you can tell I'm better today, and yeah, I spent the time I was upstairs yesterday online, and yes I've learned to delete *everything.* I'm not ready to tell you what's going on in my head, but I will tell you. Eventually. Can you trust me? Please?"
Stuff from the story that didn't make the final cut.
Turning off phone now. Behave, Sherlock. – JW
"Really? I would have gone with love."
The End
Sherlock took the proffered bag into his gloved hand, stopping to catch John's hand and press a kiss to his palm. Lestrade and Donovan gaped.
"So, that's it then."
Sherlock nodded once and leaned into his partner, kissing him hard. John slid his hands around to the back of his head, tangling his fingers in his soft, curly hair, deepening the kiss, drinking in his taste. By the time they pulled apart, they were both breathing heavy. Sherlock rested his forehead against John's and pinned him with his stare.
Jeremy kissed him on the forehead, smiled sadly, and waved goodbye as he walked away, not looking back. John watched, the fury in him growing. He swung around and stomped up the stairs to find Sherlock slouched in his chair, fingers steepled before him, looking directly at John as he walked in.
"Yeah, it went quickly. Enough patients, but nothing too horrible. You got a new case?"
"He was never going to do that."
John laughed, kissing him on his bruising cheek.
So basically, Sherlock Holmes had ruined yet another relationship.
John deposited the tea on the floor by Sherlock's head and the phone into his hand. The other man finally sat up, picked up his mug, and looked at John for the first time since the doctor had walked through the door.
"I don't understand, John. Why are you putting yourself, and me, through all of this? It's rather dull watching you date. The solution to your issue is perfectly evident. If you want a romantic relationship with a man, what's wrong with me?"
John raised an eyebrow at the matter of fact way Sherlock said the last.
"You might regret that."
"Thank you. You know how I've always felt about him. But, maybe now, with you, he won't end up scattering bodies across London."
Sherlock had been examining him while he spoke, but he stopped and softened his gaze. He needed to trust John; he knew that, because he needed John to trust him. Not just with his life, either. He needed John to eventually trust him with everything. And wasn't that just fantastic? He had to give up his favorite hobby – Figuring Out Dr. John Watson – so he could eventually be trusted with the man's heart. And how was he going to win that heart if he didn't figure him out? He supposed that was part of this entire trusting thing.
Are you sure? I'll get take away. – Molly
"There's an odour," Sherlock drew out, not looking at anyone but at everything around them. He had a pensive look on his face as he stuffed his hands into the pockets of his long coat. "I see you have the murder weapon, Anderson."
"Yes," she confirmed, taking a sip of her drink. "You're not spending time with me because you're on call to Sherlock twenty-four seven."
"The number of walls is unimportant. You're not bored, then you're trying to figure something out. And considering your interest in what happened when I went out yesterday, I have a horrible feeling it's *me* you're trying to figure out…. Have you hacked my computer again?"
"I know, and that's why I'm not mad. The truth of the matter is, you're already in a relationship. There's no room for me."
He walked out of the hospital and waited. He knew it wouldn't take long, and sure enough, a large black car pulled up and the driver stepped out, holding the door open for John. John slid in across from Mycroft Holmes and the driver resumed his seat and started driving again.
"Is the wedding going to be rescheduled?"
"Well, any luck?" John asked Mrs Wilcox, the matchmaker he had found online.
Sherlock reached over and cupped one of John's hands.
"Sherlock? I'm going out."
The End
"A dog?"
They were back at Baker Street, sitting at the mostly cleared off kitchen table, tuxedo jackets thrown over the backs of their chairs. John wasn't looking at Sherlock. He had his face in his hands, elbows on his knees, just trying to breathe. Sherlock also wasn't looking at John. He had his head turned, looking out the window where the sky had blackened to night. Seeing as it was that morning they had put on their tuxes, Sherlock straightening John's collar because the other man's hands had been shaking too much to do it, it had been a very long day. And it had gone nothing like John had thought it would.
"Thank you so much for making me sound like a teenage girl, falsetto and all, which is very unbecoming in your voice, by the way. And I have said you were brilliant, but I've never said it like that."
"Was it the husband?" John asked, sure that's what Sherlock was thinking.
The look the detective was giving him made his stomach do an odd little flip he had never noticed before, but was sure he had felt around him. Unfortunately, he knew exactly what Sherlock meant, and it wasn't what he would have liked, but he had already made his peace with that. He hoped he had, anyhow. Wasn't he still under the illusion that he was a perfectly heterosexual male on his way to see his girlfriend just that morning? It seemed like weeks ago.
"I do not just lie around all day in my bath robe."
John wasn't used to hearing Sherlock babble, but since just that morning he thought he would never see him again, he just held on tight and let his silent tears soak into the front of his shirt.
Yeah, but still. – JW
"Well, I'm not really in favour of anything that will move you out of here. Or tie dye. Well, the list is rather long," Sherlock smirked.
His thanking John seemed to startle them even more. As Sherlock collected the evidence he needed to prove that the man in front of him had died at someone else's hands, Donovan pulled John aside, much to his annoyance.
"I think I'm ready for you to meet my flatmate, if you are," he suggested.
John groaned as he let a thought slide through his brain that he had worked long and hard to keep out. He hadn't even realized he *had* any thoughts like that, but he supposed it made sense. Sherlock had been everything to him for months now, and bloody hell he was in love with him.
He barely made it in time to crawl into the cab beside him. Sherlock was busy texting. John leaned in close to see what he was sending, and to whom. He nearly pulled back when he felt the other man's dark curls brush against his face. He quickly stifled that urge, knowing that reaction would attract more attention than just being close enough to smell his shampoo. It was a text to Lestrade, instructing him to arrest the husband. Sherlock turned to the doctor, entirely too close now that they were facing, but neither pulled back.
"Yes, John, one with ears, a wet nose and bad breath. You can even pick it out."
"Of course dear," Mrs Wilcox replied with a smile. "Doctor looking for a steady relationship – there's plenty of nice young men who would queue up to meet you. I've narrowed it down to five possibilities, with two who are your best matches. I just have a question or two and we can set up the meetings."
Sherlock graced him with his most winning scowl. It was the one he reserved for annoying flatmates.
"Why, Sherlock? Why did you have your phone on during the ceremony? Why did you check that damned text while standing up with me? Why did you start jumping around in that mad way that you do and announce, in the middle of the *church*, that there had been a murder? Why did you grab my arm and leave?"
"No, John, I can't do that."
"I am aware of what most people *think* is wrong with me. Most people are blithering idiots. I didn't mean that, and you know it. I want to know why you haven't simply asked me to be in a romantic relationship with you."
John had arrived home. And he had certainly been on a date. Yes, he was kissing said date good bye and laughing and smiling. It didn't happen very often, not to him, but Sherlock's stomach dropped. John had clearly come to grips with being attracted to men, and he hadn't felt comfortable telling Sherlock. It was a surprise that it actually upset him so much. Oh, he knew he was far more threatened by this blond statue kissing John than any of his female companions, but he knew he could handle the situation. It was John not talking to him about it, springing it on him like this, that was the problem.
"Mrs Hudson! Don't you ever knock?!"
Finding nothing useful there, and no other new files on the hard drive, he opened up the browser and … John had erased his browser history. Sherlock tried other tricks he knew to see where John had been online recently – checking his cookies, recovering his last session, typing every letter in the alphabet into a search engine just to see what would pop up in the drop down menu – but he got nowhere. Clearly John *had* finally learned how to keep Sherlock from finding out what he had been up to online. His continued use of a password to lock his computer must have just been to lull the other man. Interesting.
"Where's your little friend?" he asked, his voice back to its low, intense pitch.
000000
"You are clearly attracted to me," Sherlock continued. "You have been from the beginning. I just had to decide if I were attracted to you, which I am. I have to admit, it has been advantageous on occasion."
And Sherlock pranced up the stairs. Pranced. Live in? John wanted to cry. And scream. He thought he wanted to scream a whole lot more. Yes, he was going with scream.
"Don't get indignant." Sherlock's smile had taken on a decidedly mischievous tilt. "And you most certainly were, though I realized later that you didn't realize you were."
"I know you can't," John rounded on her, his eyes blazing and his mouth set in a cruel line. "You can't because there no longer *is* a body. I don't know how he did it, I *saw him jump*, but he's not dead. I know he's not dead. Where is he, Molly?"
"Hmmm," Sherlock acknowledged, not looking up from his microscope. The last case had been a decent distraction, but it had been a bit too obvious. Lestrade actually would have figured it out in a few days, likely after the forensics came back – he depended entirely too much on that and not enough on his own senses. Now the detective was just trying to preoccupy himself with some research so he wouldn't preoccupy himself with John's odd behaviour. Stupid promise.
“I know. It’s not something I tell people.” He paused, expecting John to ask more questions, but the man remained stubbornly silent, unashamedly staring at Sherlock’s reflection. Sherlock cleared his throat and let his bowtie fall loose in his fingers. “I got bullied for it; being the gay male ballet dancer. So I learnt to keep it quiet.”
“I’ve come up with a solution to help you rid yourself of the guilt that’s keeping your knuckles white.”
Mike led them into the house to sign the wedding register and John felt his chest expand three sizes as he watched Sherlock sign his name as ‘Holmes’ for the last time before he’d use ‘William Sherlock Scott Watson-Holmes’. Then a simple ‘Watson’ came out from under John’s pen before his signature would become ‘John Hamish Watson-Holmes’.
“Sherlock,” John finally choked out. “Before I met you, I thought my life was over…” John swallowed hard and was glad for Sherlock’s hands holding his, keeping him grounded. “I wasn’t broken, I was shattered. But you didn’t try to fix me or change me. Instead, you took one look at the battered pieces of an invalided doctor and accepted me with all my baggage. Your enthusiasm and energy brought me back to life. You infuriate me every day,” he smiled as a chorus of chuckles scattered among the guests. “But you also amaze me every day. You inspire me to be a better person, which doesn’t mean following the rules, but breaking the ones that were wrong, to begin with.
“There’s a Belstaff shop in Soho where I can purchase a new, nearly identical, coat. Actually, I should get two just in case…” He gave John a look of pure, wicked amusement. “They have jackets that are just the way you like yours and they do have jumpers…” He squinted his nose as if recalling John’s wardrobe. “In more earthy colours than your usual, but I think you’d like their style — the quiet, military flair. Then it’s just a short ride to Spencer Hart in Marylebone — I need a new suit. Hmm, maybe we can get you one... something casual. Oh, stop looking at me like that.”
Anderson took that exact moment to make the safer choice to converse with Detective Inspector Dimmock. Sherlock sighed once he was alone again, and secretly wished for a cigarette. That would at least give him something to focus on instead of all of the stupidity around him.
“Oh, that explains the… smell. You went skip-hopping.”
The decorated seats were full with the families and friends mixed on both sides, creating a visual representation of how closely Sherlock and John’s lives had intertwined and making John truly appreciate how his life had changed since meeting the man by his side. He suspected it must have been Sherlock's idea to seat them this way, knowing that John’s side would be filled with Harry as the sole family member.
“You’re impossible.” John shook his head, feeling the tension in him abate to make room for amusement.
“I hope you realise that exercising this poor attempt at a threat will make you just as tired and hungry as it would make me, if not more.”
I'd like to thank NitaElwy for inspiring me with her wonderful art to finally write the boys getting married and attending Pride Parade. Writing to her art is always a pleasure <3
“John,” Sherlock’s baritone sounded even deeper than usual and he paused, chewed on his bottom lip and took a deep breath before speaking again. “All my life, I refused to acknowledge that I could be one of those people who look for, and finally find their other half. I’ve always considered myself a complete person, therefore not needing anyone else. I wasn’t wrong.” There was a murmur of confusion amongst the gathered but they quieted quickly as Sherlock continued. “You have not become my half, you filled in the cracks of the broken me. I’ve always been a complete person, but only after meeting you have I become whole. With your praise, your kind gaze, and your touch, you understood all the pieces of me that I could never make sense of.”
She lifted her thick, perfectly shaped brows at him and shook her head. “Sorry,” she said, sounding like she almost meant it before the blow and pop of her gum erased that impression completely.
The glares from John didn’t help Sherlock  build up a strong argument in his favour. This must have been how Julius Caesar had felt when Brutus took his turn at the proverbial bat, and this betrayal was worth John taking his own bloody cab to the courthouse.
Sherlock’s voice trailed off and John forgot how to breathe. In a matter of seconds, with just a few words, Sherlock managed to make him feel as if he was worth more than his weight in gold. As if recalling and cataloguing every tiny fact about him, his looks and behaviour were really worth Sherlock’s time and the use of his brilliant mind.
As Sherlock was starting to get used to asking for what he really wants from John, his requests have them exploring new territories.
It was most likely that Sherlock would be lost in slumber for at least the entire night or even into the hours of tomorrow afternoon. In an effort to make him comfortable, John tugged the coat to take it off, unleashing the foul smell again that seemed to permeate the entire room now, John included.
“And I want, from the bottom of my heart, to do all that for the rest of my life.”
If they weren’t being invited to any black-tie events, he’d have to find his own. Sherlock placed the small envelope on the coffee table just as John’s footsteps began to ascend the stairs. He turned to face the mirror above the fireplace, making a big show of tying a brand new silk bowtie.
John’s eyes flickered over Sherlock’s face, finally coming to rest on his lips. The last shred of Sherlock’s resolve melted, and he leaned forward, hovering for a fraction of a second above John’s mouth, letting the anticipation course through his veins. Before he had a chance to ask if this was what the other man wanted, John leaned forward and closed the gap.
?” John took a deep, calming breath that didn’t actually calm him at all but helped him to stifle the wail of anger and disappointment that was bubbling inside him. “Can you fix this?” he whispered through clenched teeth.
Sherlock’s grip on John was relentless, slowly upping the rhythm as he twisted his wrist at just the perfect angle, at the precise moment John needed it. The twin sounds of slick movements rung obscene and erotic, mixed with low groans from them both. A music John would love to hear again, whenever Sherlock wanted…
Raising a glass of champagne, Greg turned towards the tables. “A toast for the happy couple!” Cheers erupted as everyone took to drinking. “Everyone is invited to cut the cake…”
Over the next few months, Sherlock found as many excuses as possible to get John into a suit. He even begged Lestrade to let them into court again, much to the DI’s confusion. It didn’t work, even when he offered to do all his own paperwork for a month.
“The game is on, you absolute co —” It was Sherlock's mouth that interrupted John the second time and he melted into the sweet taste of the cake spread into his mouth by Sherlock's tongue.
“Right,” John nodded once. “There isn’t.”
However, first there was the matter of getting through the day with most of his blood supply away from his loins. Eventually, John pulled him along into the courtroom by the arm and sat him in between himself and Lestrade. Sherlock spent most of the time sneaking furtive looks over to John, but after a hard elbow from the DI he turned his attention back to the trial at hand.
“I will forever strive to be worthy of your love, try to bring you carnal pleasure until you’re at a loss for breath, and cherish the heart you’ve given me; because trust me, mine has been yours since you forgot your cane and ran with me. And John...” Sherlock let go of one of John’s hands to lift John’s chin with his finger as if to make sure John’s gaze remained on his. “You have cheekily absconded with my heart and I don’t want it back.”
When everything snapped back to reality, they lay spent, unmoving, their ragged breaths slowing down to a regular rhythm. John’s hand still lay on Sherlock’s abdomen, unwilling to break the physical contact between them.
John’s musings of a proud flatmate were cut short when Sherlock’s piercing gaze landed on him.
It was only a matter of minutes before Sherlock regretted his decision to head out alone. John was always an excellent repellent for idiots invading Sherlock’s space. Idiots like Anderson, who strode over to Sherlock once he saw him trying, and failing, to hide in the shadows of the hallway right outside of the courtroom. The conversation about his wife and him going on holiday to Paris later that summer made Sherlock want to put his head through the nearest brick wall.
“Why’re you all dressed up?” He asked, scratching his chin.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
John was in a suit. And not just the type of suit Sherlock deduced that a man like John would have crumpled up and dusty in the back of his closet. The suit was fitted and styled with a razor edge that Sherlock recognised only belonged to a properly trained tailor. The crisp blueness of the color was the exact shade of John’s eyes when he called Sherlock brilliant, and what the hell was happening to Sherlock’s vision? It went momentarily fuzzy, and hues of rosy glow that made Sherlock sure that was the telltale signs of having a mental collapse.
John and Sherlock are enjoying their first bath together.
“Sod the cake,” John whispered, taking two plates and turning towards the crowd. He caught Greg's eye, who, a true DI, understood the entire message John communicated with his gaze and nodded.
He accessed sections and subsections of John’s outfits once more. Flashes of more warm jumpers and frustratingly comfortable shoes were everywhere. That one time John begrudgingly wore a jockey's uniform to assist Sherlock with a theory, but other than that, no other visual references within the index.
. Besides, I’ve always enjoyed ballet.”
“Berk,” John snickered but complied, trying to accept Sherlock’s bedroom quirks rather than understand them.
John’s voice sounded irritated in that way Sherlock secretly enjoyed. The exasperated tone tinged with barely contained curses was as cosy and inviting as warm cups of tea served to Sherlock at the beginning of a fog-filled morning. Sherlock glanced up to say something equal parts saltiness and snark, but found that words didn’t exist in the presence of what he was seeing in front of him.
like yourself so...I guess I shouldn’t worry too much. Let’s head in, yeah? The courtroom doors just opened and we need to get a seat close to Greg.”
Unfortunately, on the day of the wedding, John woke up coughing and shivering. A bug had been going around the surgery, and it seemed that John had finally caught it. Sherlock came downstairs to find John wrapped tightly in blankets and taking his temperature in the bathroom, still shivering despite the layers of fabric wrapped around his shoulders.
“No, absolutely not!” John turned his head to let Sherlock see that he was serious.
Lestrade was going to pay for this in the end, It was only a matter of to what degree. Sherlock hated court with a passion that should be illegal in itself. The stuffiness and grandiose pomposity of it rivaled the likes of Mycroft, and the dullness of legal proceedings was to be avoided as much as possible. Again, much like Mycroft.
Now, Mycroft was standing next to the magnificent instrument and shaking off his hands as Greg fixed his tie. The men hadn’t officially declared themselves a couple, but during the last several days, they had ceased hiding their tiny displays of affection in public.
When the sun had set, Angelo wheeled a simple, white cake with two figures eerily resembling them on top.
“Uhh,” John swallowed.
“I won’t.” The steps creaked as John ascended the stairs, a familiar sound that Sherlock had memorised. About halfway up, the creaks ceased, and Sherlock’s head automatically turned to face the door. “I’m still not wearing a suit!” John called back, and Sherlock chuckled.
“What did you want to ask then?”
John froze mid-cracking an egg over the pan and looked at Sherlock taking out mugs and neatly arranging everything to make the tea.
As they passed the threshold of the house outside, again holding their hands up as if they’d won a boxing match, the guests had petals ready and showered them with fistfuls while phones clicked to catch the moment.
For the weeks before the wedding, Sherlock’s heart would flutter with anticipation, imagining John coming down the stairs in his perfectly pressed bespoke suit.
Chapter written by WritingOutLoud
Sherlock’s smirk was replaced by an ‘oh’ when John reached for his erection again. If only he’d known sooner how to wipe that smirk off of the detective’s face…
“It’s your fault.” The tone was more playful than accusatory.
And waited.
“So we miss it. I’d rather be here, with you.”
Sherlock repositioned slightly, his legs falling open, his other hand reaching further under his sack. A tiny sound left John when he realised what Sherlock was doing.
When the Judge finally dismissed them at the end of the day, Lestrade thanked them both for coming and their assistance in the case. Sherlock barely listened to the DI and left John to do what he did best. Listen to all of the superlative information and then translate it into bite-sized amounts of information for Sherlock to swallow later. Much later in this specific instance because Sherlock needed to start to concentrate on a brand new objective.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was only when John’s name was called by the prosecution did Sherlock snap back into observation mode. John sat in the witness box and answered all of the questions with the medical knowledge and reliance that he wore just as well as that distractingly beautiful suit. His fierce determination to not let the defence trip him up during cross-examination was so tantamount to foreplay that Sherlock ended up feeling decided hot under the collar. Even Lestrade turned to look at him with slight concern.
“Yes, thanks.” John accepted the ticket offered, paid with his card, and went back home.
“I also vow to enjoy the breakfasts you make in the morning, the nagging you deliver when I haven’t slept in days, and the tiny sounds of snoring you make after you’ve had a pint.
John watched Sherlock cut another piece, the rainbow-coloured layers inside contrasting with the white plates. Warmth spread in John’s chest and a grin played on his face. He could either fall apart and cry or do just the opposite.
“It must have shrunk.” She shrugged, her face passive as if she couldn’t see the terror that was surely painted all over John’s face.
“We’re going out.” Sherlock announced, watching John’s movements from the corner of his eye.
After falling asleep in each other’s arms, John and Sherlock wake up to discover things they didn’t know about the other.
fics if you like the boys happy, smutty and in love.
“What is this?” he whispered in disbelief, his eyes darting from the coat to bubble gum girl #2 and back.
“You are aware that the rule you mentioned before about me telling you what I want and don’t want, and pushing our old boundaries when I feel like it — applies to you as well, correct?” Sherlock tilted his head, scrutinising John with his sharp gaze.
“You can be such an insufferable cock!” John gasped, half-offended, half-amused, suppressing a laugh.
At first, he started simple, accepting invitations to thank you parties from well-off clients, hoping John would take the opportunity to dress up. He didn’t. The best Sherlock saw was John dressed in a new shirt and jeans, and even then, Sherlock wasn’t sure John had made much of an effort. Not that he didn’t look good regardless — John always looked good — but there was part of him that craved to see him in the crisp lines of his bespoke suit again. Sherlock pushed as much as he dared, subtly questioning John’s outfits without giving his true intentions away. John brushed him off each time, ever confident in his appearance.
A loud goose-like honk startled them from the emotional moment and they turned to the guests to see that Angelo was blowing his nose in a large table napkin.
His need to watch Sherlock's hand at work was stronger though, and he breathed deeply before he lifted his head to look. His eyes locked on Sherlock’s hips and their erotic, fluid thrusts. He was cupping his own balls with his free hand, playing, squeezing, and John was trying to do a ‘Sherlock’ and remember it all to know what to do if he got the opportunity to touch Sherlock again.
John quirked an eyebrow, but nodded his head. “Well, you
The melody of Pachelbel's Canon in D Major filled the garden, floating delicately like petals in the wind, drifting through the air and reaching every guest. They all turned sideways to watch the couple soon to be married, and John could feel that their gazes were filled with love and acceptance, which was a lot more than John had ever gotten in any room full of people before in his life. John searched for any hesitation in himself before such a big moment and found none. He didn’t need the courage to do this. Agreeing to walk down the aisle with Sherlock had been the easiest decision he’d ever made. His eyes locked on the tall and handsome man by his side, his high cheekbones, and an expression of absolute ease on his face.
“So how does Donovan feel about you and your spouse galavanting off to one of the most romantic spots in the world?”
“Yes?”
The mugs clinked when John retrieved them from the cupboard, the hum of the kettle filling the space before it clicked. He poured water over the leaves and while the tea brewed, he put two slices of toast in the toaster and slathered them with butter and honey when they popped out. Sherlock would need sugar, and honey was his favourite kind.
“Oh really?” Sherlock lifted an eyebrow, his lips turning from open in shock to smiling with intent.
Several quiet chuckles were scattered amongst the guests, but John had eyes only for his future husband who seemed to ignore everything and everyone around, solely focused on John.
By the time Sherlock made his way to the stand, he was so flush in the cheeks that he might be better off to confess to the killing himself. Prison must be superior to a slow death by John-fueled stimulation. He was covertly relieved that John was out of his line of sight for the time on the stand. He yearned for a drink for the first time in a very long while, but to request a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon while giving expert testimony would in all probability be a bit not good.
“It's a tradition,” John explained as giggles bubbled out of him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Venturing to the kitchen, John couldn’t suppress the smile that took over his face as the soft shuffle of Sherlock settling himself on the sofa brought a sense of calm over him. The case was solved and Sherlock would have a day or even two of respite. If the work had drained him enough, he might even let himself sleep, or better yet, eat.
The fic was supposed to be finished at 2 chapters, but there will be at least 4 :)
“You owe me for destroying my coat, so if you agree to me buying you a jumper, or several, I’d consider the debt repaid,” Sherlock said with just a slight twitch of mischief to his lips as he wrapped a hand around his mug.
Sherlock sucked in a breath through his teeth and John stopped his movement immediately, alarm bells ringing in his head at the dread he’d done something wrong.
Sherlock gave a small cough and excused himself from the conversation, making something up about needing to check his blood temperature experiment.
John looked at his clasped hands and released the grip, feeling blood rush back to his fingers.
“Your morning breath is filed under ‘John and nasty things’. It's in a wicker chest which I placed far in the attic, so as not to stumble upon it too often.”
“Are scrambled eggs okay? We have nothing else, to be honest.”
“Is that a yes?” Sherlock smiled that genuine smile John adored, the one that made his eyes crinkle at the sides.
John sat, linked his hands over the table, straightened his back, and waited for the bollocking of his life.
“Sorry, Sherlock. I think I’m staying at home today.”
Sherlock, I promise to be by your side, wherever you want to go, wherever life takes us. I promise to take care of you even if you snap at me for it, and try to keep up with you and your insane ideas.
Minutes later, John was leaning against the counter to watch Sherlock eat with eagerness, his own plate in his hand, food growing cold. Only after Sherlock lifted his gaze to him and rolled his eyes did John sit to eat as well.
Before he could think twice, he unceremoniously shoved the coat into a trash bag and was on his way to get Sherlock’s coat cleaned, glad that Sherlock hadn’t seen the rough treatment of his precious garment. If he hurried, he could make it before closing time. He had no idea where Sherlock did his cleaning, but how could one dry cleaner differ from another? And there was one just around the corner.
“Yes…” Sherlock breathed, then released a lascivious groan that resonated deep in John, sending tingling pinpricks of heat through him. It was the most erotic thing he’d ever seen. “I’ve done it so many times imagining it were your fingers inside me, massaging my prostate with a doctor’s precision, making me come —” his breath hitched as his left hand worked faster inside him, his right speeding up on John’s cock as well.
“It um…”
“Do you want me to come with you? As moral support, or something?”
“That’s fine. Can it be done tomorrow by, say, eleven?” John asked with hope in his voice.
“Okay,” John chuckled, understanding that the dynamic in 221B might have changed in some aspects, but in others, it would stay the same. Feeling giddy, John almost kissed Sherlock's temple. Instead, he looked at the detective pouring tea and went back to scrambling the eggs.
Only Sherlock’s piercing gaze, as he opened his eyes and locked them on John, made him finally take a big gulp of air. Attempting to hide the effect the words had on him, he took a sip of the tea, letting the hot liquid slide down his throat.
“Oh, okay. Do I want to know what exactly you are cataloguing?” John asked, intrigued to find out if his performance had some Mind Palace rating or some such.
“I have drawn conclusions and constructed a rough list for the future. Next time, I want you to come in my mouth,” Sherlock said in a serious tone, making John sputter.
“I’m cataloguing the morning experience in my Mind Palace,” Sherlock spoke suddenly, as if knowing that John was staring at him. He probably did. X-ray vision or some other trick John had yet to learn about.
“Yeah, okay,” she drawled. “It will cost you extra for express.”
Despite not getting to see John in his finest outfit, Sherlock didn’t mind that they spent the day at home. He bundled John back into bed and set about making him endless cups of tea and slices of toast. At lunchtime, he popped out for more ibuprofen, meticulously writing the times of each dose in his phone. Towards the end of the day, John migrated to the sofa, and they spent the evening watching Bond films on telly. The disappointment Sherlock had felt at the beginning of the day had quickly faded, and he was almost glad they got to spend the time together at home.
Someone whistled, a few people clapped and there were more than several voices giggling. John felt his ears turn the colour of ripe tomatoes and despite his body calling to continue the kiss, he broke it, placing his hands on Sherlock's cheeks.
John reached for the small blue envelope and made short work of pulling the enclosed tickets out. There was a moment of silence as his eyes dashed once, then twice, over the pieces of card in his hand. Eventually, he looked up, turning to watch Sherlock’s reflection in the mirror.
“Still, no one should be made to feel bad about the things they like. Or who they like. I would know.”
(AKA pre-wedding fluff)
"I was not coming onto you."
No – JW
"You're a bit more rumpled than you should be by the break up. Your tone of voice when you told me about it, what little you said, was perfectly clear – it was expected and you weren't devastated. However, you look like you've been on a roller coaster, with the way your hair is sticking up, I imagine from you running your hands through it and tugging on it, as if to try to jump start you thinking process. Clearly, Dr. Watson, something far more interesting than a break up has just happened to you."
"Shouldn't you be affected more by this than you are?"
"Bolivia?"
"Ok. Fine. Let's get a dog."
-Astrild
"I'm fine, Mrs Hudson, just please leave."
"Don't care, take me to him."
"Bored," Sherlock muttered to himself.
"Tomorrow. Now, come on, let's go to bed."
"I am aware that this really doesn't solve anything, but what else are we going to do? We've never said it, we've never gone near it, really, but everyone else already knows. We are partners, John. I may not be able to give you those things a woman can, but what about everything else I give you? The things that no one else can?"
"Since when have you interfered in my work? And besides, we had known each other less than a day and I thought you were coming onto me. What was I supposed to say?"
"Well, as for Jeremy, no. He's made it clear that he, like most of London, thinks you and I are in a relationship already and so there is no room for him. I guess I have to start over."
John stopped himself from groaning. Just. Of course Sherlock could see that something was up, there was no point in lying to him, or trying to hide it. Which meant there was no way he was going to be able to keep him from figuring out how he felt. Hell, the man probably knew already, way before John did. He could only hope that Sherlock had made the decision not to point it out before because he wanted to keep the status quo, and that he would continue to do so and let them both go on blissfully as if nothing had changed. There was only one way to insure that – enough truth to satisfy the man's one hundred mile per hour brain.
"Well, I do need to think whether you think I do or not," he finally managed, gathering up their mugs and taking them to the kitchen before heading up to his room. "I'll be upstairs if you need me."
"Then stay out of the other half!"
John didn't know what to think. The minute he thought he had Sherlock mostly pegged (you couldn't entirely know his mind, that was impossible) the man would say something to completely throw him off. But he did know when he was being serious, and Sherlock seriously thought it was obvious that John should have approached him with this arrangement the minute he figured out how he felt.
"If it means anything, I didn't actually mean to chase him off."
Exactly. – JW
"Tea?"
"I did try," Mycroft announced after the door had been closed behind him.
"Wonderful. Grab my phone on the way by the desk, would you?"
"My home, so please, if you would," Mycroft smiled, in a very condescending way, motioning John to exit the vehicle.
He heard John sigh and realized that he may have been expected to look up and actually say something. John really should have known better. The door closed and he listened as the doctor made his way down the stairs and out the front door.
"I'm sorry, you're right. You had no right to put on that horrid show on the stoop, but you're right. I should have told you, I should have talked to you. This has just been the oddest week or so of my life and I didn't know what to say."
He came to a decision very quickly on how he was going to 'handle' the situation and John deserved every bit of it for not giving him some kind of warning.
"Don't you know me at all? I'm deeply affected by this. Honestly, I could use a cup of tea."
"Yes, I did, and she agreed that she wasn't going to change me running around solving crimes with you, that she wasn't going to interfere in our friendship. But I think it was perfectly reasonable for her to expect not to have her wedding ruined."
Busy doing what? – SH
As you two were! And I am happy for you, really. – Molly
"And how do I feel, Sherlock?" John hissed. He was finally pissed. "You know what I want. I want a wife, a house with a yard, *children.* You can't give me any of that!"
"No. We had a long talk on the mobile while you were interviewing the suspect. I'm to pick my things up from her place tomorrow, I'm to apologize to her parents at that point, and I'm being stuck with half the bill. Seeing as I left her at the altar, I'm lucky they're not threatening to sue me for the entire thing. Thank god she wanted a small affair."
"Distracted again. Perfect."
John started laughing. It was hysterical, and tears started streaming down his face. He was laughing so hard he had to hold his stomach and he nearly collapsed out of his chair. Sherlock jumped up and rounded the table to kneel next to him, wrapping his arms around him and pulling him out of his chair onto the floor with him, tucking John's head into his neck.
