“I told you, I want that connection back. This doesn’t have to be physical, Dean. It can be about respect and communication and understanding.”
drunken luck, because again, he had blackjack. When everyone else had stuck or gone bust, he laid his cards out with a flourish. He received more chips, and smirked at the good-looking stranger.
Dean’s mother shrugged.
“You’re adorable when you’re jealous,” he teased. Dean grunted, and passed him some roasted goat.
Alex put the book down on the table with deliberate movements, and then locked eyes with Claire before she could glance away. She felt her mouth go dry as Alex looked at her, her expression seemingly empty save for the heat in her eyes.
'She remembers us? How?'
“Me too,” Castiel was a little quieter than Dean. “I love you too, Dean.”
“Dancing with Patience,” Kaia nodded in their direction. “We’re worn out by all the dancing though. Want a drink too?”
“You are giving me so much dirt on my English teacher.”
Castiel felt hurt, by Dean’s bad joke and the fact that he wasn’t talking about what he had been doing. It was almost as though Dean was trying to push him away, trying to deal with his transformation on his own-
“Do you want them back?”
She closed her eyes, willing herself not to get upset again.
'I wish,' Faith rolled her eyes, and left the diner, striding around to the trash area. Dax and Ms Matthews followed, the elder lady's nose wrinkling as she looked at the area.
“Okay, so,” Castiel turned to Claire, pursing his lips for a moment. “Would it be too much for you if Dean stayed over occasionally?”
“So you’re not going to try to talk me out of it?”
“Okay. I remember being on a boat with you, I think? And some singing, and going for bacon double cheeseburgers.”
'And then Bear said she knew somewhere safe, and I had to go. And I said no, Daddy said stay here. And Bear said Daddy had said I needed to listen to Bear, Bear would take care of me. Bear kept saying I needed to come, Bear knew a great place to hide. Bear took me into the bathroom, and said we should hide in the vent. And then we should climb up the vent, and no one would find us. And then we got to the top, and we were outside, and there were all these angels looking scarier than Balthazar ever did. And they all had silver swords and they all came near me and I was scared and all the scared left in a big bang.'
“I didn’t say your name, you’re safe,” Benny replied a little louder. But then their footsteps started, and they left the room before Castiel turned, watching their retreating backs, the way Dean curled towards his friend to whisper in his ear, a hand on his shoulder. Benny’s body tensed, but he listened anyway, and Castiel focused back on the painting. He couldn’t enjoy it after Dean’s succinct evaluation. Or maybe it was after seeing their uneven relationship up close.
He walked out of the room, and Faith felt her heart sink. Why was family not as important to her brother as it was to her father and herself? She forced herself not to get upset over it. Yes, she would have loved to have that special bond with Ben, but there was so many other things to think about, that worrying over Ben's apathy would tip her over the balance and into a world of crazy. It was enough that she was pregnant - by two months, though her stomach was more like a seven-month pregnant lady's - and on the run from demons and antichrist, adjusting to the idea of being away from her mother after just finding him, working out her feelings about Dax and Junior without throwing another complication into the mix.
She stared ahead, wrapping her arms closer around herself. He heard her sniff, and looked again to see a tear roll down her cheek.
Claire sighed and looked away from this girl. She was so tired of talking about the whole thing.
“What are you doing here? She blurted, as Castiel finally reappeared. He gently moved her closer to them, then rang up the boys silently.
“He told you everything?”
“That was rotting when Sam ate it. He poisoned himself.”
Alex nodded, taking it in.
Castiel savoured the feel of Dean’s skin against his own, the tightness in his chest that came from Dean’s grasp, the way that he began kissing down Castiel’s neck in that familiar-yet-potent way. He fought the urge to groan loudly, unsure whether anyone except Dean would hear him, and arched his throat instead, allowing more room for those intoxicating kisses.
'Dean?'
“Yeah, well. Good to know what I’m up against.”
“No, Claire. I said I would respect that and I’m going to. This is something else.” He showed them the box in his hands, one that looked fairly heavy. “Come on.”
They got out of the car and Claire let them into the apartment, where Castiel was sitting on the sofa, reading a book and sipping from a glass of wine.
He gave a shaky smile, and kissed her forehead again.
“Right now, I’d say that was a good assessment. But it could change, Claire.”
Am I bothering you?
Alex looked at the floor, and Claire sat forward, hoping that her father wouldn’t hate her too much for this.
“I can’t believe my brother’s in love with the shortest man in Theban history.” Dean grinned. Sam shoved his shoulder, before pulling him into a hug.
Dean sucked in a slow breath. Here was where she was going to reveal why he lost her. He was anxious to know just what had happened.
She stood there, frustrated and angry, when she heard something, someone close by.
Dean stared at him for a moment, and then shrugged.
“Forget about it, Claire. You’ll give yourself nightmares. It used to spook Sam.”
“It’ll all work out, Cas. You’ll see.”
Dean chewed his donut thoughtfully for a moment.
“That’s it?” Dean checked. Castiel frowned.
It felt strange, to want something like that with someone, and to know you weren’t quite capable of doing it. Alex had clearly wanted something like that with her, and her dreams kept spinning a narrative that she could have the same connection with Jack, but neither of those situations were real. And she could tell that few people experienced love in the same way Castiel and Dean did. They had something rare, something like the poetry that the officiant was talking about. No wonder Castiel had been forcing himself to calm down.
Claire just tried to concentrate on the glimpse of a book she could see on the coffee table, though she was hyperaware of Alex shifting away from her slightly, putting the distance between them. She knew Alex was probably hurt, but how could she make her girlfriend feel better about the whole thing when she wasn’t even sure why she had reacted so badly? When she couldn’t even calm down enough to speak.
Castiel smiled despite himself. It was sweet, seeing her be so protective of Dean. And he got a little thrill, hearing her phrase it as taking Dean out, as though it were a real date. He wasn’t sure if Dean had told his sister anything about who he was, or what they were really doing, and his nerves still had the better of him.
'Faith,' he leaned against the closet door. 'Dean took years to come around to the truth about our connection. It's still tenuous-'
“I think that’s okay,” Gabriel told Castiel. “So, what do we do, on the foothills of Olympus, under Zeus’ all-seeing eye?”
“I’m sure I’ll find something in my price range.”
'Hey little one. I'm Dean.'
Castiel walked out of the room with the young man in tow, and turned to him as they walked along the hallway.
'So we're stopping here for a while?'
“His loss. When we’re married, I control your life.” Meg smirked. Castiel looked at her blankly. “Geez, I was kidding, Clarence.”
“For a stepdad, you’re not horrible.”
The amazing artwork is by Good Question and you can find her artwork at
“Yes, you are,” Jack murmured in her ear. It was cheesy and a little lame, but still somehow just what she would have expected from her cousin. She turned her head to look at him, and he leaned closer to her, that soft smile on his lips as they closed the distance to hers. And then they were kissing at the lake, surrounded by each other, absorbed in the connection between their bodies.
'Yeah, they were like, the nerds of the hunting world. They never did field work, but they knew everything there was to know about unnatural beings. Anything you wanna know is here. Almost everything.'
Dean chuckled again, and settled back on the bed, naked and glorious.
“Don’t be mean,” the little girl admonished. She blinked up at Castiel. “What would you like on your pizza?”
'Why does she even have to travel, anyway?' Dean breathed.
Faith nodded pitifully, as Sam traded a conspiratoral look with Dean, and Castiel finally placed his fingers on his daughter's forehead, and tried to work out how to help her.
They knocked back another. And another. There was a rushing sensation in Castiel’s head and his muscles felt both weighted and floating as the alcohol began to take effect. The lights seemed brighter around them, the colors of the decor and other patrons more vibrant, the music in the background flooded into his veins … this was why he always let Gabriel talk him into stuff like Jägerbombs; it felt good to be getting drunk.
Castiel looked like he was going to be sick, and Dean reached for his cell, swiping along until he could call up his videos. He pressed play, and handed it across to his new husband, so that he could watch their wedding. Castiel watched the video silently, and Dean watched him as he drank in the truth.
“Yes. One of the committee. Not caring what you were saying, just listening to your voice, trying to work out what there was between you.”
“I’ve apologised already. I know I shouldn’t have done it. But I do not regret it. You won’t make me say that.”
“Okay, okay, no more teasing?” Dean spoke softly, but then he was moving, pulling off his clothes, revealing a glorious expanse of tan skin before he tugged at Castiel’s shirt and pants, and pausing for a moment once they were both completely naked. “Mmmm, there’s nothing like a dark forest of chest hair, or olive skin in Maine, or-”
Castiel still said nothing.  There was nothing he wanted to say to Michael. He just wanted his brothers to drop it.
“Claire?” She sounded dazed.
“He might. If he gets death threats for hiring a gay man.”
'I don't know. Some Bible story. Why's it okay for you to go around with your werewolf face on all the time? Aren't you guys meant to look human sometimes?'
Castiel shrugged.
“And cheaters buy the shakes. Think both are on you.”
“Hey, sorry Claire, but I’ve got to go. Cheer practice.” Alex didn’t even look at her, just shoved a couple of books into her backpack and shut the door. Claire walked with her towards the gym.
“Fold,” Jack threw his cards onto the table, and stood up to get a drink. Claire gave her future stepfather her best poker face, and he gave her a smirk.
Christmas had been a modest affair in the Winchester household. Sam and Eileen were staying with Dean over the festive period, and they had brought their baby son, Bobby-John with them. He had spent most of his time trying to eat the wrapping paper and cooing at his doting uncle, showing off the small amount of baby signing he had learnt to communicate with his mother. Dean had barely seen his daughter, Emma, who had spent most of the evening of Christmas Eve out with friends and slept until Christmas dinner was served. She opened her gifts, spent a little time playing with Bobby-John and then disappeared with her cellphone, talking with her friends.
“I was coming to see you, didn’t think you’d beat me down here,” Alex gave a small sideways smirk. “How’re you holding up?”
Dean looked up from his sister’s pizza base and gave that adorable soft smile.
“Thanks Sammy.”
I love you too.
“I think … I think I want to just concentrate on you and me, and not worry about anyone else. Or whether they see us or not. If that’s okay with you?”
“Her name was Jess?”
“Yes.” Dean contributed. Claire rolled her eyes.
Time stopped having any meaning for Dean. He spent his time helping Castiel, and slowly meeting the other gods. He got along surprisingly well with Hera, and with Castiel’s aunt Artemis, he talked warfare with Athena and Ares, weaponry with Haephestus. And of course, there was the times when he and Castiel were alone, to connect on every level. Each kiss and touch and whisper still felt like the first.
“So you don’t have any angelic duties?”
“You are.”
“Please, don’t leave me.” Castiel managed to moan, standing his ground to stay in the exact same position. Even if his raw strength would be a giveaway to the Hunter.
'We're related. Great. He's an asshole.'
“That’s great, that’s so great! Thank you, Claire!”
“We can,” Castiel nodded, trying to react as Cas would, all suave and confident instead of full of crippling self-doubt. But both sides of him wanted that contact with Dean. “And anything you want to say to me, whisper it in my ear. Even if it’s just about the Mayor’s wife and her four chins. It’ll look more couple-y.”
“Jack Novak is here,” she hissed. “I knew Claire would be, she and Alex are always together, but I thought Jack was too cool for something like this. Do I look okay?”
Sam’s arms stopped swinging.
“I have, but I wanted your input. Sometimes those things can only tell me how well Claire has done, not any issues she might be dealing with. This is a free space, Mr Novak.” Mr Winchester reminded him. “I won’t be making life difficult for Claire, or singling her out. We try and have good communication between parents and faculty here.”
'Yeah, so says Faith. I can't hear anything when I touch the bump. She won't let anyone else near it, she doesn't like talking to it, she's treating Junior like crap again. This is the sort of thing I'm glad I missed out on.'
“No, he ordered bread.”
“That’s not what I meant. It’s fine because I’m not interested and that’s trash.”
“Sam said there was an issue at lunch too?”
“Reasonable? Dean, my daughter has broken bones! It’s the least confident I’ve seen her, the longest silent treatment she’s ever given me. I feel sick just thinking about what she might have been through. But how will that help her? How do you expect she’ll talk to us if we’re yelling about this? And you’re the principal, Dean, you’re meant to be impartial here.”
“I didn’t realize you were a dork until just now.”
Dax had settled in the meeting room with a huge stack of books and notes, going through the material as he chewed his way absent-mindedly through a huge bag of potato chips. Sam had left him to go get something from his room and Dax had embraced the silence, and the space, and more importantly, the knowledge he was going to gleam from these books. If he could learn more about Faith, about what she actually was, it might help him come to terms with the fact that the day before, they were running for their lives and now, she was calling their persuer 'Uncle' and spending most of her time with a raging alcoholic.
Claire sat back in her chair, and just hoped that Alex would back up her story. Alex’s gaze darted up to Ms Harvelle’s face.
“We’ll still have our Sundays,” Castiel promised. “Just you and me. Unless we agree to have other people with us.”
'Don't you dare, Faith! We're a team, right? A package deal? I'm staying, so you stay.'
'Faith's being trusted with a huge responsibility, Dax. I'm sure at the moment she's overwhelmed by everything. But it will get easier. Let her explain when she's ready.'
“Are you a prude or something?” Alex asked. Claire merely shrugged, and Alex put her face close. “I mean, you’ve never had a boyfriend. Never been on a date. You’re okay with your dad dating our principal but-”
“Yeah. And now you don’t need a stick up there, because you have Cas-”
Castiel knew he was in part to blame for that, by hardly being able to hold a conversation. Dean nodded, though he had never met Meg and didn’t know what she could be like. There was still a distance between them, and it made Castiel ache. He had been missing Dean so much, and even if he couldn’t really have the man, he still wanted to enjoy their time together. He reached across and took Dean’s hand in his own, feeling that almost static crackle between them even as his nerves calmed. He wanted that sensation all the time.
“Yeah.”
“Cool. So, we’re all a bunch of freaks,” Patience gave a shaky smile.
“Probably not.” Dean was unreadable, but Castiel could deal with a hangry person. Meg had given him plenty of experience.
Castiel was still staring at Sam, debating whether he had even noticed that his true face had been invisible in the past year that he had been without a Grace, but he heard the change in Dean's thoughts as his attention was grabbed by Becky.
'It's funny,' she sighed, tucking her wings in close, 'I thought if I ever finally met you, you've be this over-bearing guy who thought he was always right and wouldn't give a crap about me, really. But I think right now, I trust you better than anyone else.'
Claire came home from school on Tuesday and set up camp in the small family room, her feet up on the coffee table as she flicked through TV channels. She was enjoying the relative quiet of the apartment while her father was downstairs in the store, preparing to eat a massive bag of chips when she found something decent to watch. She found a rerun of Game of Thrones and settled in, ripping into the chips and leaning back, just as someone came running up the stairs. It didn’t sound like her father, who moved silently like a cat or a ninja or something. Nor did it sound like Charlie who tended to sing eighties power ballads as she skipped up the steps. And neither of them would pound the door the way this person was.
“Yeah, sure Garth gave you a pop quiz. Right. I’m not a rookie here.”
Claire curled her arms around his waist, and asked something that, until that point, she wouldn’t have felt comfortable with saying. But with what had just happened with Alex, and all the letters she had been reading through, and whatever complications were developing with Dean, it felt relevant.
“Everything okay?” He checked. Claire did an impression of his expression when typing, and he pretended to hide his face. “So embarrassing.”
The game ended, with their high school team narrowly winning the game. Several players ran off the pitch and straight into the arms of their cheerleader girlfriends. A few other girls drifted into the crowds, and Claire watched as Alex stepped back from the fray, clutching her elbow with one hand and watching the team celebrate. She looked to her dad, and Dean, who both seemed to understand what she was thinking, and stepped back to allow her out of the row, getting suckered into a conversation with some students behind them about some of the plays. And Claire walked self-consciously down the bleachers, feeling like she was having another out of body experience. The steps down seemed further away than normal and Claire had to make some deliberate steps to stop herself from tumbling. She reached the railings that separated the crowds from the players, and leaned across. Alex was maybe six feet in front of her. She made herself take a measured breath, and then spoke clearly.
“Dean, you’re already my other Dad. It’s just that you’re making it official and legal tomorrow. You’ve been my other Dad since forever, I swear. You don’t have to promise anything else.”
“Okay. So I have to win over Charlie as well as you.”
“Other teenagers don’t have an archangel checking up on them,” Junior pointed out. Gabriel winked.
'You sounded pretty scared of him.' Dean pointed out.
'You're not funny.' Dax groaned, folding his skinny arms across his chest as Faith navigated the van across potholes.
“What did you want to do today?” Castiel asked her stiffly.
“Jack,” Castiel began to argue, but Claire was grateful that Jack was adamant.
“I meant about us.”
“Hey, someone got rid of a tux jacket. Think there’s someone getting lucky in the bushes?”
“I liked Bones. But his owners posted flyers all over town looking for their beloved dog. I snuck him out when you were at school and took him home. And since Sammy wasn’t telling me he had smuggled a dog into the basement, I couldn’t tell him the dog was safely home.”
“You must be tired,” he muttered. She nodded, closing her eyes and breathing in his smell. Which yes, had a hint of dog, but was pleasant and earthy at the same time.
He slumped on the floor when it finally finished crawling in, making him consume every molecule. And then he could feel a sensation similar to pins and needles, working its way through every cell of his being, the sensation growing more and more intense until it made his vessel rigid, and a bright white-blue light shone from every orifice for a matter of moments. And then it was gone, and Castiel lay with his head buried in the thick red weave of the carpet, eyes closed as though he could shut out the obvious truth. As though he couldn’t sense Gabriel, still standing so close, trying to communicate with him without words. As though he couldn’t feel his wings wrapped around himself, soft and tender and a bittersweet comfort. Gabriel crouched down beside him on the floor, slipping a hand underneath a wing and squeezing his little brother’s shoulder.
“Yes, sorry, Alex.” She nodded at Claire’s girlfriend. “I also wanted to say that you have my support. Coming out in high school can’t be easy.”
“Cheesy.” Dean noted. “But you’re spending the whole night with me. I’m not letting anyone else think they can have you at midnight.”
“I’m on your side, Dad. And if you having Dean and me maybe having a girlfriend makes them act like that, then we don’t need them. It’s you and me, right? And Dean?”
He looked up and caught Castiel’s eye, before shrugging carelessly.
“I don’t know, Jody,” Donna said slowly. Dean sipped his coffee.
“Claire, what you said-“ Alex whispered in her ear. “About our friendship?”
“I wondered if you would read it.”
Claire ate her waffle thoughtfully.
“Jody is Alex’s stepmom, Alex is Claire’s new friend. And Dean is … Dean is …” Castiel cocked his head to one side, and Claire wondered why he was faltering. She didn’t imagine he would be so private about his sexuality with Charlie. “The guy.” He finished eventually. Claire didn’t understand, but Charlie evidently did. She punched his arm, beaming at Dean.
“Well, aren’t you just everything we’d heard and more?”
'Hoboken,' Dax nodded, squinting at the roadsigns ahead for the exits out of the city. 'No joking.'
“That’s not helpful, Daddy. If this baby is an angel, maybe it should be a name like theirs.”
"Because I'm part wolf. But it's interesting, right? When you're nephilim. Which one sees Heaven?"
It was a half-truth.
Dean nodded, and slowly told his story, beginning with Michael. He got to the siege, and Sam interrupted.
Claire could practically hear Dean’s shrug.
He walked along, and pushed open a door.
Now he just had to figure out how to cope with spending so much time with his crush.
Castiel was already panicking, trying to get out of the bed covers and away from Dean.
'Dean? Faith wants you. I won't cut it, apparently.'
Alex grinned at her, reaching up and giving her a kiss that tasted of coffee, and a hint of toothpaste. She pulled away and sipped her own drink as Alex placed a cautious hand on her thigh.
“Stop freaking out,” She whispered.
‘Shame. I liked the idea of keeping it in the family. You know, I’ve been watching you the last few days, with Dean. I liked the floor show just before Sam appeared with the wife, nicely done.’
Faith stepped cautiously down the thick concrete stairs into the men of letter's basement, picking her way carefully through so she didn't disturb Dean or Sam and have them force her out of the room. Every footfall seemed to echo around the dim room, even as she tried to tiptoe towards the sectioned off area that Faith knew Dax was sat behind. She peered around the door and saw him sitting in the chair, still heavily cuffed, his head drooping forward as though he were reading something. She assumed he was asleep, and crept into the room.
'Dean, I didn't know for sure. What I said last night, about the antichrists and her, that was true. There are four out there somewhere, who I now have to find and kill. Four other teenage girls, Dean, whose lives I've influenced as much as Faith's. What if I had "bonded" with all of them? How would I be able to do what I have to do now if I had? What if you had bonded with one of the other girls only to find out it was the wrong one, and you then had to either help me kill the child you'd raised or watch as I did it?'
“Why are you so jumpy?” Alex asked as Claire flinched against the lockers. It had been a couple of days since Dean had taken her to mini golf and she kept waiting for some stupid comment from the kids who had been there, more of the same from that night. But there had been nothing. Not at lunch, not in class, and not at moments like this, in the hallway, Alex dispensing her books in her locker before cheer practice.
'What about how absent you've been for the past decade, Cas? What about the night Faith shows up is the first time for a while that you even touched me?'
“Huh? Oh yeah, we figured. That’s not the pro … are you okay?” He was panting too. She looked at him in concern, as yet another cramping sensation hit, and she curled into a ball again. “It’s okay, Faith! It’s going to be okay. Breathe with me, okay? Deep breaths, in and out.”
“Or worse, make those awful jokes.”
“At least people want it. When was the last time you got some, hey Sammy?”
I was listening to the song listed as I wrote Dean and Castiel's first dance. It's so pretty, and I'm going to guess featured on Dean's mix tape in canon!
'Dean, Gabriel is an archangel, if he hasn't got a solution, I wouldn't be any better at answering it.'
“Castiel, I’ve been looking at your recent transactions, and I’m disturbed.” His accountant said the moment he sat down, after the pleasantries were exchanged. “You’ve always been so prudent with your money, and this recent splurging and transferring cash was already out of character. So I dug a little and,” he didn’t finish the sentence, but passed a wad of papers across his desk. Castiel peered at it, and then froze. He had spent out for the wedding, and obviously for Dean, but that would have made a small dent in his fortune. The numbers at the bottom of the paperwork his account was giving him was different. Millions had been spent, even more transferred to several ambiguous shell companies he had never heard of. He dropped the cluster of documents, feeling nauseated. He had never seen so few numbers associated with his name. He couldn’t see anything else, and the numbers were all blurring together and he couldn’t breath and he wasn’t sure where all the light in the room was going and-
And that hope plunged right back down. If Patience was too young for Jack, Claire definitely was.
'You're lucky you're still useful, Dexter.'
'So I'm meant to believe you're just a total bitch?' Junior asked, and walked off to his father, leaving Faith alone on the wall. Junior's words shouldn't have gotten to her the way they did, because on some level Faith knew she wasn't the nicest person in the world, and Junior certainly didn't mean as much to her as Dax did, but his words still hurt. Her pride wouldn't let her call after him, to explain that she didn't really know what he was asking about, she just had the vague answers from her parents to go on.
“Just like your personality.”
Cas hisses under his breath. "Ignore him, Dean."
in nearly a decade. “10 years ago, somebody broke into our house and took her life," he pauses, nails digging into the flesh of his palms. "My dad... He wasn’t himself after that. It's like something in him just snapped. Then one day, he was gone. No note, no nothing, just vanished. Sammy and I were on our own, and I knew I had to hold it together for him, keep our heads above water.”
“You wanna try that again?” Billie asks, cupping her ear.
Dean swivels in his chair, giddiness taking over as he looks out his office window.
Dean hangs up.
He shoots Victor an indignant text as soon as the video is over.
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean catches Victor signal the bartender to cut him off.
Cas rolls his eyes. “Shouldn't you be at a meeting right now?”
Cas's face falls a little. "I have to get to work."
“Whatever happened to ‘captivating’?” Dean asks, mock-offended.
"There's no one else for me either,” he tells him. “Just thought you should know.”
“A nude." He paces back and forth in an oversized t-shirt, a pint of Ben&Jerry's in hand. “I can't believe I accidentally sent you a
“C’mon, I need to unwind. Jo's pub, drinks on me?”
“I don't think you're a creep,” Castiel breathes against his lips.
“See what?”
"How?" he asks, barely above a whisper. "How could he possibly know, Sam?" His voice breaks around the question, everything he managed to keep at bay bubbling to the surface now that they’re back home. Back where Cas died. "I’ve said things to him that I—"
Dean squeezes his eyes shut, bracing for a smack across the face. It never comes.
"I’m afraid that’s not me, sir," Castiel says, eyes still fixed on him. Dean nearly chokes on his own spit. The driver nods, rolling his window back up. They step away in conspiratorial silence. "Tell me I didn’t just do that," Cas mutters.
"And we're gone," Sam said, cheeky amusement coloring his voice. Dean heard both his and Eileen's chairs scrape the floor as they left to give them some space.
The guy ignores the request completely, nose practically buried in his neck.
The perfect face in front of him melts just a little, full, pink lips curling up at the corners.
“Did you just...?”
Dean can’t help the dumb sense of pride he feels at that. “Sorry, not sorry," he quips. Castiel levels him with a confused look, hands stilling in the process of taming his hair. “Y-you said, you look…” he flounders.
“Pffft, like I’m letting you drive Baby.”
Riding in the car with Cas is... intense. Dean gives up on small talk about five minutes in, putting on some music instead. He doesn't miss the way Cas's lips move around the Zeppelin lyrics, head bobbing along.
"Duh, it’s not like I met you
Damn it. This is probably karmic retribution after all his years proclaiming to be the world’s smoothest flirt.
"I knew you wouldn’t believe me...” Dean slurs, downing what's probably his fourth shot. Or tenth.
"That'd be friggin' awesome," he says, killing the engine. “I'd show you around work too, but there's no beating space stuff with motor oil."
“Shit, Cas."
“Hello, Dean. I’m Castiel.” The unusual name sounds fitting in ways he can’t explain. “Your eyes look fine to me. Are you in pain?”
“Shit—” he hisses, slamming his laptop shut. He digs up pair of sweats, slipping them on before returning to his desk. “Cas, you still there?”
“It's forgotten.” Castiel studies him for a moment. "But I still want to know. What did you mean by that?”
Dean’s heart flutters when Castiel's status changes to online. God, he’s a fucking teenager.
"It was a—” He cuts himself off, clearing his throat. “Nevermind. You uh, want me to delete it?"
It’s not just Dean’s heart that jumps at the proposition. “Sure that’s a good idea?”
Before you start this chapter, I recommend reading about the mechanism of scent-marking under the VNO topic on the
. For some stupid reason it cracks me up whenever I watch it, it's legit one of my favorite comfort videos. I just needed something silly for that scene and immediately thought of it 😂
“What? Of course not.” Cas scowls, visibly uncomfortable. “Will you stop sniffing me?”
“Are you tearing up?”
“Wait—Naomi as in
“Well, don’t eat it if it moves. And tell the boogeyman I said hi.”
"Okay,” Dean pants, head spinning. “What the fuck.”
(Balthazar) "Relax, I won't say anything embarrassing."
“Name’s Castiel," Dean replies, smiling despite himself. Describing Cas takes a while - dude's like a jigsaw puzzle with all those weird, curvy edges, and whenever Dean thinks he's close to solving it, a dozen new pieces pop up. “He let me mark him, Sammy."
The phone slips through his fingers and hits the floor with a loud noise.
“Okay." Dean shakes his head, trying to physically sort out his thoughts. "Maybe it only happens when we get close. Like,
So yeah, that Dean is
toward him, running right across the couch to fall into his arms.
“I understand I'm at fault here, and I'll gladly pay for damages, but under no circumstance will I allow you to speak to me that way.”
Dean can't help the chuckle that spurts out of him. “Missed you...”
Benny snorts. "This cute brunette dropped his car off, but he just left."
“I sure do, you came jumping out after me.”
Dean's lips curl into a smirk. "So you
“And who the hell are you?” 'Randy' barks out. He looks like your typical gym rat, and while exceptionally broad and tall, Dean beats him both in size and stature. If it comes to it, he can easily rearrange his stupid face.
Dean feels himself blanch. “Awesome.”
“Aston, DB5. Why are you—” Whatever Benny says next is lost on him.
“You got me.”
"Dean, Cas knew.”
“Huh?”
Dean rushes outside, heart doing a backflip in his chest when he spots Castiel across the street.
Castiel rolls his eyes, but he's smiling as he stands on his tiptoes to capture his lips.
guy?” He jerks a thumb over his shoulder. The kid on the couch pays them no mind, fingers deftly moving over his video game controller. “Please, he’s in Fortnite world.”
“No, but that doesn’t mean I don’t know you, does it?” she replies matter-of-factly, turning to regard Cas. “See, you hardhead? I told you he’d come around.”
“That happens a lot, I'm guessing.”
"I’ll drive you then,” he offers reflexively. Castiel opens his mouth, but nothing comes out, something Dean can’t quite place clouding his eyes. He’s expecting to be let down gently when a black sedan pulls up to them, tinted window rolling down.
Dean should be happy. His friends are back. The love of his brother's life is back. There's no Chuck, no Amara, and gone with them is every last trace of the supernatural from the world. Balance.
“You know that’ll make you worse, right?”
“Wait—try tearing it instead,” he suggests.
After Mom died, his father was in no shape to run the family's auto repair shop. Dean had to stop out of school and take up the mantle as John deteriorated, a bottle of Jack never too far from wherever he'd pass out. Then one day, he went on a beer run and never came back. Part of Dean was actually thankful for that - at least he and Sam wouldn’t have to deal with the fighting anymore.
And because there's nothing Dean can't make worse, "I didn't mean to—" he floundered, awkwardly shifting his weight. "I didn't mean to say it." A dark, hurt look passed across Cas's face. Dean's heart sunk, brain scrambling to fix the misunderstanding, "No!
“Do it,” Castiel cuts in.
I apologize for taking a bit longer on this one, December was a pretty hectic month for me and I didn't want to post this chapter without properly revising it (I don't have a beta, I write poorly like men). Hope you enjoy & please don't forget to drop a comment before you leave, I desperately need that Motivation™.
"Fine, but you
Unspoken horror passes between them.
“He let you
Cas took a step forward, a hand coming up to frame his jaw. "It's okay. I don't care how you say it."
," Cas replies in a playful tone. Dean's whole face feels like it's about to catch on fire. “Who’s blushing now, big guy?”
“Yes, I do.”
Sam chuckles. "The internet isn't exactly reliable when it comes to stuff like this, but if you guys are up for some real digging, I have a whole collection of books on paranormal phenomena. Problem is, they’re all stashed back at the old house in Rochester."
Stupid of him to think Cas wouldn't have ordered a ride.
“Like the weather.”
NSFW-ish warning for the beginning of this chapter (there's a nude picture in the first texting panel, so proceed with caution).
It was
"You look... Well, how you look," Castiel sheepishly offers.
Dean finds himself behind the wheel before he can even process it.
“Dammit," he mutters, hanging his head in shame.
A whine drips from Cas's lips and he snaps, lifting him off his feet. Cas wraps his legs around him like he’s been doing it forever, like fitting so perfectly against Dean is in his DNA.
Dean drives to Manhattan after work. The original plan was to tell Sam about the condo on his graduation day, but now, Dean's not sure he can wait. He just had a feeling about the place ever since he first saw the listing for it. Doesn't hurt that it's also within walking distance of the law firm Sam's landed a job offer at and not far enough from Dean's New Jersey home to make visiting difficult.
“You got a better idea?”
“What?!” Castiel jumps to his feet, darting out of view.
- The whole popcorn bag shenanigan is something I got from this
"Yeah, I better get going. Thanks for watching Gabriel, by the way," he says, checking his wrist watch before turning a smirk back on Dean. "So nice meeting you. In fact, if things don't work out with Castiel, my number is—"
An impossible amount of it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So that happened,” he says, starting to turn around, but a bite of pain in his eyes stops him short.
“Absolutely—”  Castiel sneezes. “—not. I’m not letting you see this.”
“Understatement.”
“I’m still a mess about it, to be honest,” Dean confesses.
Dean scrambles to wrap his head around that information.
“I wouldn't say that. I love the smell of it, for one.”
An elegant figure stands out like a sore thumb down at the garage, gracefully making their way past burly techs and disassembled vehicles. Dean cranes his neck to get a better view, something familiar in the way they move. He shoots to his feet when he catches a glimpse of profile.
“Right!? I literally can't get this bag open, it’s driving me
," Cas cuts him off, playfully shoving him away. "Relatives," he sighs.
The words don't come out the way he expected them to. At
"Uber for Mr. Santos?" the driver asks.
it, he misses getting his hands dirty. All he needed was the right incentive. "Nobody touches that car but me.”
Dean's not kidding anybody - he’s freaking enamored. Besotted, even. Which is why calling Cas in the middle of the night after drinking through a six-pack is probably not a good idea. But hey, phone's in his hand already, and
Before his brain can catch up to what he's doing, Dean hunches down, nose brushing Cas’s temple. He’s so lost in the intoxicating electricity dancing between them he almost fails to notice two hands hovering his chest, ready to push him away.
“He’s gone forever, and I'll never get the chance to say it back.”
The science of mating is primitive and unclear, but thoroughly documented. Somehow, sharing a mutual heat is all it takes for two people to become tied on a biological level. Dean himself is a product of it. He witnessed firsthand just how in sync his parents operated, and that’s the catch - such a connection makes you extremely vulnerable to the curveballs fate might throw your way. That's something else Dean also witnessed.
He eventually gives up on sleep, reaching for his phone on the nightstand. No word from Sam yet. He actually hasn't heard from him in a couple of days, only now he knows better than to haul ass across the country just to find his brother passed out atop a pile of books, stinking of absolute death. After that first incident, they came up with a system - as long as Sam checks in with him every week, Dean stays out of his unnecessarily long hair.
Victor picks up after a few rings.
Dean's arm shoots out to hold the elevator door when it starts to close. “I’ll see you again, right?” he asks, breath caught in his throat.
Castiel scoffs, pushing the door open. “Take care of yourself,
A small smile tugs on Cas's lips. "We should probably stop finishing each other's sentences."
“Well, given we apparently just heard each other's thoughts, I have to speculate 'sense' has officially left the room," Cas argues, air-quotes and all. Dean raises his hands palms up. Castiel flops down on the couch, holding his knees against his chest.
“Wendy’s always gets a pass.” Dean eyes her for a moment. "You’re really doing this, huh?”
“No,” he blurts out. “I mean—yeah, I guess. Technically."
“C'mon, I need something to get my day going."
“Can I ask you something?”
Unfortunately, it doesn't
Castiel arches an eyebrow. “You want me to think
“So we don’t," Castiel says. Everything in Dean balks at the suggestion. “We probably need to find some help.”
"Not by far—I have a huge family. My mother alone has more siblings than she can accurately name."
"Sure you are."
“There’s something about you, I—” Castiel chews on his bottom lip, looking around. “I can’t do this here. Do you mind coming up to my unit?”
“You remember that day you fell outta my window?”
“Ugh.” His forehead bumps against the cool surface of the bar. “He’s so damn beautiful, Vic. You’ve gotta see him.”
"Yeah, it's getting creepy."
"Screw you, man." He scoffs, sipping on his beer. “Can’t believe you got me out of bed over bad fanfiction.”
“You think he might know what's going on with us?”
"I’ll work on it myself, so let the crew know," he says, feeling the sort of excitement to start a new project he hasn't had in years. Nowadays his job consists mostly of administrative pencil-pushing, and while he doesn't
“I need to show you something," he says, an edge of urgency in his voice. Dean perks up - this is gonna be good. “Have you heard about the Rosetta spacecraft?”
The words play over and over in a constant, maddening loop, impossibly worse than when he had an archangel banging in his head and never allowing him a moment of peace.
"Fuck off..." Cas laughs, moving to straddle his hips, and it's
Cas snorts, scooting back to the passenger seat. “God, I look fucked out…” he sighs, checking himself in the rearview mirror.
A sigh.
Dean rolls up his sleeves and whips up a batch of Mom’s magical recipe, pouring it into a thermos before ordering a ride. He tips the driver extra for his trouble. It's about an hour later that he gets a new text from Cas.
“Yeah, I—um." Castiel audibly swallows. "We're about 20 minutes to landing.”
“It’s fine, he was being insufferable. And you’re clearly not alright, let me see.”
“Incredible, dashing,
Dean sinks into this chair. "Can we not do this right now? I've got a killer headache.”
,” Charlie says, a spark in her eye. She and Jo have been married for years, but mating is a whole different ball game. Dean was shocked to learn about their plans – the idea didn’t quite go with the modern mindset they've always espoused.
Part of Dean expects the next moment to go like a Disney movie, with Castiel running into his arms as a 'Happily Ever After' card flashes across the screen. Reality, however, tends to be a bit more anticlimactic.
Before Dean knows it, he's got a lapful of pure hotness all but devouring his mouth, his hands somehow having found their way under Castiel's sweater dress. A growl rises in his throat when his fingers brush against lacy material of his underwear.
He doesn’t turn around. He stands still, head low, shoulders drawn up in a tense line. He doesn’t—
“Hey.” He grins, wide and giddy and dumb. “I’m Dean.”
One of his eyes pop open - did he hear that right?
In the span of a decade, he managed to grow the family business into a multistate operation, the country’s largest in high-end auto customs. It’s been more than enough to bankroll Sam’s college life in California, get a great home and attain the kind of financial stability most people only ever dream of.
“Watch your step, big boy!” He spins around at the voice, a short, curly-haired lady glaring up at him. He opens his mouth to apologize, but she beats him to it, breaking into a grin. “Oh, it’s
“Probably not.”
His brother pauses at that. “Dean, last I checked you never even
Dean flashes an understanding smile, stifling the irrational urge to just grab him and run.
, Dean. You can’t go around doing that to people for kicks.”
know,” he says, soul-crushing regret seeping through every word. He vaguely feels his brother’s hand on his left shoulder, and that almost makes it
“This isn't ice cream,” Cas deadpans, shamelessly slurping a spoonful.
you?”
“What car?”
“While you were sitting in the backseat with a bowl of ice cream you thought was gonna be your last—” A laugh bubbles out of Cas at his tweak in the lyrics, blue eyes glittering. Dean flubs a note. “—I was falling deep, deeply in love with you, and I never told you ‘til just now.”
"You can touch me, Cas,” he tells him. “You can do whatever you want.”
"Um. Thanks?" Dean says, exactly like the dipshit he is. Castiel scoffs. “So..." He nervously rubs the back of his head, a burning question in his mind. "Not to be nosy, but who did you think you were texting anyway?" he asks, trying to strike a casual tone. It fails, a detectable note of resentment in his voice.
“I live in Jersey, actually. Just closed on a unit for my brother here," he explains.
The living room is limned in a soft, mellow glow from the city lights outside the window, the air of intimacy it provides causing a flutter in the pit of his stomach.
"My little brother—he used to be into this weird, paranormal crap,” he explains, unpocketing his phone to shoot Sam a quick text. “I never took the stuff seriously, but now...”
Dean folds in on himself, mortified. “Crap, my blocker probably wore off. I got worked up back there and—”
“Cas, who's supposed to help us with something like—” he stops, an idea popping in his head. “Sammy."
“Hello, Dean.”
Dean snorts. "He your only cousin?"
As to his personal life, well. He has a small, tight circle of friends, and he doesn’t date much. Work, savings, investments, Sammy - that’s been his modus operandi for as long as he can remember. Now, at 30 years of age, he can’t help but wonder if this truly is all there is to his life.
“Less than 24 hours,” he deadpans, unlocking his office. Charlie freezes at the door, and he takes the opportunity to close it.
“So we had a few setbacks, big deal. Not like triggering this thing's easy, dude. We’ve been on Control since we were 16.”
Castiel is dry-witted, effortlessly funny and a total
. "Sup, Cas?"
He lets that to go unanswered, mind retreating to the ever-present, soothing buzz in the back of his head.
Castiel's lips curl up at the corners. “You’re very clever."
“This is Lilly," Castiel says, casually stroking the creature’s head with a fingertip. “She’s being clingy today.”
yeah.”
“I think you mean this is
Dean bolts out of his office and down the stairs, running into Benny at the bottom. “You see a guy down here just now?”
His phone buzzes a few hours after he starts working on the car. He pulls out one glove, using it to wipe sweat off his brow as his free hand reaches into his pocket.
“No?”
Castiel blanches, mouth hanging open as Dean approaches. "Hey, Cas." His eyes sweep over him appreciatively. "Lookin' good.”
Grinning through the ache in his joints, he said in a sleep-rough voice, "God, I love you so much."
Dean can swear he hears Cas's breath hitch in his throat, silence dragging on for a few seconds until he lets out a soft,
,” he retorts, hand dropping to his side. Dean immediately misses the touch. “I have no idea what this is," Castiel confesses, voice barely above a whisper.
“Dean, how did you find me?” he asks, nervously shifting on his feet.
"I'm not authorized to discuss that," Cas deadpans.
Dean’s out of the car before he even knows it.
“No, this is life, slowly vacating my body.”
it just feels right, and I really wanna get to know you better, if that’s something you—”
Surprisingly, Dean manages to be productive despite his hangover. He checks on suppliers, reviews spreadsheets and sends out important emails. Burying himself in work proves pointless after a while though, thoughts helplessly returning to Castiel. He finally caves when noon rolls around, grabbing his phone and typing up a text. He reads it over several times before hitting send.
Cas gives a knowing shake of his head. “Noah—my brother. He enjoys using me as a guinea pig for random stuff he finds online," he explains. Relief washes over Dean, soothing his rattled nerves. Part of him can't help but feel stupid for jumping to conclusions. “Dean..." Cas starts, worrying his bottom lip. "You should probably know there's no one else."
"More like you found
"That’s not what I said."
“I know, kiddo.”
He arches an eyebrow. "Meaning?"
“Hey, Cas." He smiles despite himself. “Did I wake you up?”
“Little lost here, Cas.” The nickname rolls off his tongue like it’s been sitting there forever.
He can almost hear Cas's impatient eyeroll through the phone.
"I mean, no. Not like that.”
“Oh." Cas's cheeks flush with color. "Didn't realize I said that out loud."
"God..." Castiel groans when their eyes meet across the room, burying his head back in his hands. "You’re still here."
“I’m officially out of good ideas,” Castiel confesses. That would make two of them. “Maybe we could just… do this?” he suggests, leaning in to brush their lips together.
“No," he deadpans. They share a commiserating chuckle.
"I mean there's nobody I'd send actual nudes to besides you," Castiel blurts out at once.
“Nah, it’s
"Are you wearing one of those tacky pheromone colognes?” he asks, leaning in to scent him.
There's a little bit of Portuguese in this chapter! If you hover over the text, you should see the English translation. That only works for desktop users, though. If you're on mobile, scroll to the end notes to see the translations & some trivia!
He pulls himself into a sitting position, yanking off a post-it note stuck to his forehead. “Dammit, Victor…” he groans, squinting to read what it says.
Castiel answers the FaceTime call after a couple of rings, phone mounted at an the angle that allows Dean a wide view of his living room.
, his finger just slipped.
Castiel holds up a hand to stop him. “No.”
“What didn't you tell me?”
“Shut up, bitch."
“What—” Dean gapes at the pitch-black, scaly thing wrapped around Cas’s arm. “—the hell is that.”
Dean's eyebrows pull together. “The hell?"
He swallows, heart rate picking up. “You sure?”
“Think you've found your mess yet?” Dean dares to ask, but never gets an answer.
Cas plays along with a roll of his eyes, “Alexander…”
“I can
It’s one in the morning and Dean only knows three things.
"I know what you mean. My mom, she...” Dean swallows. He hasn't talked about
“C’mon, blues...” Dean pleads with him. “I miss your face.”
Neither of them speak for an utterly confusing moment.
"I—you—" Castiel stutters, cheeks filling with color. "You know what, take it as you wish. I don't care."
“You didn’t answer my question."
Dean's not sure how long he stays pinned under Castiel's unimaginably vast gaze, but it feels like years. Decades, even. Despite his most basic instincts, he doesn't feel the need to hide here. He lets himself be seen - his fears, vulnerability, and the sinking feeling that if he lets whatever this is slip through his fingers now, he'll have a lifetime of regret.
The website automatically refreshes, NASA logo flashing as the livestream kicks off.
“Nah, personal stuff to handle," he says, a hand leaving the wheel to palm ‘personal stuff’ through his pants - a parting gift from his little make out session with Cas.
Dean should be happy, because for the first time, they finally have a real shot at normal. Except for him, normal is a black hole in his chest growing bigger every second as it feeds on his life force.
Castiel bobs his head. “I was going to watch the final approach with some popcorn and, well. Check this out,” he says, holding up a sealed popcorn bag. He proceeds to pull, twist and claw at it, but to no avail.
“Same difference.”
Dean waits until she's out of earshot to whisper, "The hell was that?"
true. Still, that's no excuse for being so nonchalant about it, especially since this was Cas's first time hearing the words from him. Shit—maybe his first time hearing the words
Dean sees red. He grabs the asshole by his jacket and slams him so hard against his truck the shock alarm goes off.
Dean immediately pulls back. "Fuck, I'm so sorry—"
“The hell took you so long to call?” Dean asks as his brother's face freezes idiotically on the screen. “I’ve been on red alert for
, he directs the thought at the growing pressure in his pants.
“Yeah, I saw it on the news. It’s supposed to land on a comet soon, right?”
Dean nearly falls out of his chair.
Dean chuckles. "Mom brought us to the planetarium a couple of times when we were kids. Sammy used to love it."
“Well, there’s something I never told you ‘bout that night.”
“Papers to Sammy’s new place."
” Cas’s lips press into a thin line - a silent confirmation. “Which makes your dad Chuck. Wow.”
Castiel worries his lips. “I just don’t want to give you the wrong idea.”
, Dean's mind supplies. “I have to go. Thanks again for the ride, Dean.”
Castiel elbows his side at that, typing in a hefty tip for the driver before cancelling the trip. "I could use that ride now."
"Then why’re you blushing?" Dean teases.
Castiel looks away, avoiding his gaze. "I thought you feel safe, for a stranger." Dean’s heart does a weird spinning jump in his chest. “Your turn.”
“Why are you being such a bitch about it?” he spits back defensively.
"Nah, just good at working with my hands.”
A quick look at the scene tells him the full story – white Lamborghini Truck backs out, blue DB5 hits it head-on. Somebody had been very distracted.
Dean growls when the elevator screeches at the obstruction, hands moving to hold Cas’s face until the doors physically force them to break the kiss. He catches a last glimpse of Castiel laughing into his hands, eyes sparkling with mirth.
Dean bites back a laugh. "Not much of a tech wiz, are ya?” He watches the image shake and flicker before refocusing on Cas's face, big blue eyes taking most of the screen. “Hey there. Lookin' good.”
“Scent-marking has a
He rolls his eyes. “It’s called taking a personal interest.”
He pauses at that, brows knitting together. "Cas, we’re facetiming."
“Alright, I'm nothing if not practical, so let's try this out." He walks over, crouching down to meet Cas at eye-level. “Think something, anything, and I'll try to catch it.”
He huffs, reaching out to fix the problem himself. He’s
She snorts, walking out the door. "You have to stop calling him that."
Even Dean's most debauched sexual experiences pale in comparison to the absolutely maddening thrill of Castiel on his lap, grinding down ever so slightly as he ravishes his mouth. It’s like High School all over again, when having clothes on can't stop you from getting off.
“Jerk.”
“She’s a very docile python." Cas seems to ponder something before adding, "Relatively.”
Sam looks pensive for a moment. “Alright, I think I've got enough info for now. I'll hit up the library tomorrow.”
“Oh, please. Spare me your rational lectures." She waves him off dismissively, starting toward the apartment. “He’s different, honey. You'll see."
“And you thought your head was gonna explode."
“Easy, pokeball,” he grouches.
"Dude, you're rambling," Sam chimed in.
“You’re ridiculous," Cas deadpans.
"Gee, Cas, happy to see you too," he quips, trying not to feel too hurt by his lackluster reaction.
“I just did.”
He awkwardly shuffles on his feet. “Um.”
Cas makes a little noise of protest, but pulls back anyway. His pupils are blown wide, lashes drooping low and lips obscenely kiss-swollen. Dean's eyes follow his pretty blush crawling all the way to his collarbone to find the strap of Cas's top slipped down his shoulder at some point, exposing a breast. It’s small and lovely, a pink nipple crowning the perky mound. His mouth waters, strained cock reflexively leaking in the confines of his jeans.
"Hey, pal!" Dean barks, giving his desk an audible slap. "He said no sniffing."
"Oh." Castiel looks almost embarrassed. "I'm sorry, I didn't know.”
, right?"
An odd giddiness takes over his senses as he steers through a sea of luxury vehicles. He finds the right parking space after what seems like forever, pulling into it before he kills the engine. He just sits in the car for a while, trying to will away the weird feeling of imminence that has the hair on his arms standing up.
“Awesome, I’m-a go grab a beer."
telling me everything over lunch. I'll order in.”
“Yeah, dunno why,” he says, holding out the pint of Ben&Jerry’s he got from the 7-Eleven a couple of blocks back. “Hope you like Pistachio.”
"Me too," he breathes against him, hands roaming his face, his hair, his chest, trying to make sure he’s really here, solid and real. "God, Cas, me too. I love you too,
"Say I'm the shit."
“Looks like your hair didn't get the memo."
send me nudes."
let himself hope. This wouldn’t be the first time his mind played tricks on him.
"You could say that." Dean leans back in his chair, processing.
“Yes. Would you like to watch it?”
Castiel cocks an amused eyebrow. “Do you take constructive criticism, Dean?”
closed.
They’ve been texting nonstop since the whole nude incident a few weeks ago. In hindsight, it sure made for a great icebreaker. Dean's caught himself smiling at his phone like a damn fool more times than he can count, and while he won't admit it to another soul, his new favorite pastime is listening to Cas's voice recordings, from short
He shrugs. Foreigner had its moments. “
Dean's back slides against the elevator wall until he's crouching down, feeling too giddy to stand on his feet. Yeah, something is definitely different now.
She headed over to the door, muttering under her breath,
“Cas? I’m not going to bone you drunk.”
“Hey,” she nodded. Alex gave her a cautious smile.
Kevin gave him a small smile, before they stepped back through the front door, Castiel guiding Kevin into the kitchen. Dean sorted Kevin’s beverage, and finally passed Castiel his beer bottle, though Castiel noticed he was cautious not to make contact with him. They made their way into the sitting room, where Charlie was sitting in the middle of a mass of fabrics, the game set up on their coffee table and the television screen dark. She watched them enter, and spoke to Dean, her voice oozing sarcasm.
'Cas? Cas? Are you with me?'
Dean made to slip back into his row, but one of the generals gestured him forward. He moved, Castiel in tow, and stood closer to the front than before. There were renewed mutters behind him, behind Castiel, but he refused to turn his head, refused to let the others soldier’s jealousy and egos take this moment from them.
He held out his pinkie, and she gave an exaggerated sigh.
“So did your dad,” Castiel said quietly, as Dean parked the car in a field near a copse of trees.
“Are you telling me you were holding back? You gave me a better fight than I’ve had in a long time.”
He said that before. Is that his happiness? Is this it? I have to make sure, as much as I don’t want to know. I want him to stop, I want time to stop, because if time stops, maybe I never lose him. I never want to lose him again.
“I’m so sick of this place.” She muttered.
Dean sat back in his seat and gestured at her.
“Did you really just come here to criticise my dad and play that card again? What’s the point?”
God, the sound of his voice right now. It’s like Cas is breaking in front of me. When we survive Billie – if we survive Billie – I’m kicking the Emtpy’s ass next.
“It’s worked.” Gabriel spoke quietly, nodding at the chair. Castiel turned, but Dean had left the seat. And the room. Castiel turned back, panicked.
Claire gave up fighting, and let Alex in, heading into the kitchen to grab a bowl for them to shared the chips. She came back to find Alex sprawled on the sofa, their assignment on the coffee table and the chips disappearing already. Claire grabbed the bag and poured it into the bowl, and sat the other end of the sofa, the bowl in between them. There was silence for the first segment of the show, and as soon as the commercials started, Alex began talking. Incessantly.
Claire looked down, away from the camera.
“They already think we’re weird. Because until about six years ago it was just Mom, Dad, Sam, Alfie, and me. Mom and Dad adopted Alf about ten years ago. And Dad was on a job - he was a truck driver - and he had a heart attack at the wheel. He died. Sam and me had already moved out by then but I moved back to help Mom, just temporarily, just for a while. But then Adam showed up. His mom had died and he’d come looking for his dad. It was … it was weird. This scrawny kid, giving us all the stink eye, demanding to see Dad, getting used to the idea his mom had been the other woman.”
"We started going out, about sixteen months ago. Got engaged a couple of weekss ago. And we want you at our wedding."
'So, have you talked to her, Cas?' Sam spoke up eventually.
Dax burst out laughing.
“Yeah. What about your folks? What happened with them?”
“Okay,” Dean unclasped his hands and began jotting something down on the top piece of paper in his pile. “Claire, you’ll be able to go to class today, because I don’t want you to fall behind, but you will have to check in with your teachers, and spend lunch break in your study hall classroom. I’ll make sure a teacher is there to watch out for you.”
“Ares would reject my offerings when I kill the children of his city,” Dean reminded him. “You know Thebans are all about Dionysus.”
Castiel smiled faintly.
Castiel cut his own pancake.
“Deal. And your number?”
“Fuck,” Castiel breathed, and pulled himself out of Dean’s reach, letting go of himself.
“You think I don’t respect you?” Dean snorted. Castiel merely gestured to his face, and Dean leaned forward, across the table. “You’re my best friend, Cas. Doesn’t mean I’m about to take your shit, but normally, you’re on my side.”
“Yeah, built on a healthy foundation of you being drunk out of your mind and me being allergic to your cat.”
“When did this become a group decision?” He muttered.
“No, no it was … good. You know, it was … okay, I can’t remember.”
'You're so corny,' she laughed, leaning forward and kissing him gently on his mouth. 'Come on, I want to go flying. Want to come with me?'
Sam considered that for a moment, before standing up and taking his dishes to the sink, patting his brother on the shoulder. Dean looked at him briefly, and then plated up what he was cooking, bringing a plate over to Castiel and sitting across the table from him.
“Of course I am.”
“Please, distract me from my homework.”
Also, I was kind of having fun with the whole renaming 80's classics but I don't know if they translate out of my head, so five extra fan points if you do know what movies Claire and Dean are referring to.
He wondered if Dean knew he was referring to Charlie only. Sam didn’t seem like a gossip, from their brief interactions.
“Don’t put that out there, please. It’s one thing wondering if I have a crush, it’s something else if he has one too.”
“A fresh, seared scallop with asparagus gel and a pancetta crumb.”
'They were dancing around it for years. I'll tell them both, but give me some time. I don't want to screw it up.'
She heard his voice in her head.
“Your angels?” She repeated dubiously. “What do you mean, your angels?”
Sam nodded, leaning against the doorframe.
Claire huffed a sigh.
“Kevin, pull over for a second, I’m not ready yet.”
“My point is, when we first met, I was an angel who took whatever command I was given. And you changed that, you made me think, you showed me the value in doing the right thing. That the right thing wasn’t turning a blind eye and hoping it would all go away, that you had to fight and get your hands dirty if you wanted to help more people. You’re my moral compass, Dean.”
“I see something.”
“So, you can see people’s souls, as well as my grace?”
“Claire, which one’s your bed? I’ll share with you. Makes it a little less weird for you and Alex,” Kaia said as she changed into her pyjamas.
“This is Castiel. My boyfriend, Claire’s father. For the record, it’s him I’ve been seeing the whole time. Not Claire, who’s a great kid but she’s still a kid. She’s still his kid. And maybe one day we’ll get serious enough that she’ll end up my kid too. Either you believe this or you don’t, and I know my job depends on that, but more than anything, I just want my family okay.”
“You really do get it.”
'Yeah, I know Becky,' Sam interrupted testily. 'Look-'
“Hey, are we okay? You over me, you know, doing my job?”
“My nose hurts. I think I want to nap.” She stuck her spoon in the ice cream and laid down, turning away from him. It took Jack a couple of minutes to realise she was serious, and leave the room.
She saw the apprehensive look they swapped, and fought the urge to roll her eyes.
Dax stared blankly through her, as though she wasn't there at all. Faith felt venom leaping up through her oesophegus like bile, and she wanted to hurt him as badly as he was hurting her with his lack of empathy.
“Good idea. I have his ring.”
There was silence for a moment, before Faith spoke again, her voice stronger than it had been all week.
Claire looked at him tiredly, but couldn’t resist the offer either.
“Dad, I,” Claire began, but Castiel waved it away.
“I’m sorry, Bear.”
“What do you think is going to happen? With the baby, and Stevie, and Dax?”
He wanted to talk, to say all the things he felt about Dean, but he was so scared that he would be coming on too strong, even after sleeping together. He wanted Dean to say something first, to know it was the right step forward, but Dean seemed happy to just toy with his fingers, to cuddle on the back seat, to have all these wordless sentiments said by other means.
Claire bit into his egg roll, enjoying how happy her father looked.
Castiel sighed, and rested his head against Dean's shoulder.
“You look crushed,” Kevin noted as he made his way back to the Novak’s mansion.
He came between them, with Castiel still riding him, his spunk heating his skin even more, causing a sticky friction between their torsos. And still Castiel was going, pumping hard into him, and Dean was lost in the ecstasy of their connection. Castiel felt right inside him, his girth just the right side of too big, his thrusts hitting that satisfactory spot inside him every time, his orgasm still coursing through his veins.
'I don't blame you.' He promised her. 'I've gotta ask though, why're you calling yourself Faith these days?'
'No. Sam can't hurt him. He ran away.'
“Claire,” he sighed, but squeezed her. “They’re your mother’s parents, whatever their faults, they should still mean a lot to you.”
'She's … well, we're bonding. She misses you. She remembered everything and she keeps talking about when she was a kid. Did you know she could walk for about a week before she actually took her first steps? She was waiting for us.'
Claire looked at Alex.
“I’ll manage. But you might get lucky and sell me a soldering iron for a five hundred per cent mark up.”
'Faith, say no. They can't possess you without your permission. Cas, I thought you knew better.'
“You do have the temperament.”
And it would buy Castiel the time to work out if Dean would ever actually be interested in him as a boyfriend. Dean didn’t argue.
“Okay.”
They stared at each other for a long moment, before Faith stepped closer, slipping her arm through her fathers.
“What would you suggest? Daddy-daughter tattoos?” Castiel rolled his eyes.
'Yes, pre-teen Faith sounded like a handful. Gabriel hated all the girls about five years ago.'
"I know. I've known Dean and Sam on and off my whole life, it was only when Dean called Dad and said you were home that he called you Faith."
“I’ll start cooking.”
“I know how important it is, for them to be together right now,” Dean’s voice was lower, like he didn’t want to admit to this truth. “I feel like I let them down, exposing them to this.”
“Cas, come on. Sam’s smart, he wouldn’t blab to the wrong person. Keep it PG and he’ll be fine.”
Dean and Castiel were trying their best to be respectful of Claire and her turmoil over this new fight with Alex. She could see how hard for them it was, however, when they had just reunited. So even if they weren’t hugging or kissing, there were still tender little gestures between them. Lingering hands on wrists, glances that turned into eternal stares, bodies that turned naturally towards each other. Castiel making breakfast and not asking how Dean wanting his eggs. Dean laying a paper in front of Castiel, turning the pages for him when he got to the end of an article, their heads together when Dean wanted to read something himself. Claire watched from across the table and wondered if they were even aware of the way they synched together. If they were girls, their cycles would match up.
They went quiet for a moment.
“Okay. So, after dinner last night, once we dropped you off, my dad was like, Bear, would it be okay if I asked Dean to move in with us? And I was like, Dad, keep up, Dean has moved in with us.”
“I should give you a tour of my house. Since you gave me one of yours.”
Dean kissed his forehead again, and started to snore lightly moments later. Castiel snuggled into his chest, and tried to stay awake, to enjoy the feel of Dean’s skin against his own once again.
'Ugh,' Faith grunted back.
Dean’s tone was a warning, and Castiel wanted to laugh. Unless Dean wanted blood for this thing, it was going to be his. He faced Dean instead, the sculpture fitting between them.
“I assure you that I’m not. Do you remember when the apocalypse seemed to be impending and you took me to a strip club?”
“It can’t happen.”
“Yeah, she said it was a wonderful ceremony. She hadn’t seen Uncle Cas looking so happy.”
“Hanging with you?” Claire guessed, and Alex laughed.
They had agreed early on in their newly-reinstated relationship that should Castiel feel an anxiety attack coming on he would give a simple signal and Dean would step in to help. It was something Castiel could do even as the panic took over, something Dean had noticed in the very early days of knowing each other. Castiel merely had to look at the floor, standing completely still, for a count of five and Dean would try to ease him out of the attack. Even if they were arguing, Dean had promised it would come first, though they were yet to have an argument since getting back together.
They heard the front door open and close, and the babble of Dean’s half-brothers and half-sisters as they entered the house.
“Don’t think any worse of either of us when you read them. Whatever was said was out of frustration and a shared love of our daughter.”
"Well, they’re very talented hands." Castiel freezes, eyes wide. "That didn't come out right, I meant—" he cuts himself off, reaching for the door handle as if to flee. "I should go. Thank you for the ride, Dean.”
“Lots of that going around, huh?” he remarks.
The distinctive voice sends a jolt of electricity shooting down Dean’s spine.
“Cas, I’m real." Dean leans back against the wall, his own panic swirling in the pit of his stomach.
“Is it kidnapping if I don’t complain?”
"You're lucky."
’s to minute-long rants about everyday predicaments that have him laughing like a kid again.
Castiel nods, delicate fingers running across Baby's dashboard. “This Chevy is quite impressive. '67 Impala, right?”
Dean leans forward, outstretched arms holding the doors open. “What, no goodbye kiss?”
“Listen to your head? Perhaps…”
That's what Dean gets for trying to keep up with Sam and Eileen's drinking. He can no longer hold his liquor like he did in his thirties, and it's taking him a while to accept that. So obviously he'd wake up majorly hungover and have no control over his tongue until at least 10 ounces of caffeine were running through his bloodstream. Which is exactly what Cas, being Cas, provided him with the moment he stepped down into the kitchen.
it yet.
“Great...” Dean mutters, signaling the bartender over. “Wouldn't be weirdest thing to happen tonight.”
," Charlie retorts, closing the door behind her.
“I kinda like the heat, to be honest.”
He reaches Castiel’s building in record time, pulling into the vacant parking spot that will one day house Sam's car. He paces around in the elevator, even jumps a couple of times to try and rein in his nerves, but he's still worked up as ever when the doors open up to Cas's apartment, breaths growing irregular with every step that takes him further inside.
“You're right, I should’ve listened," he teases, not meaning it for a second.
“You mean

. He didn't even think about it. The words just came tumbling out of his mouth like he'd been casually saying them for years, like it didn't change a thing, like it was a long-settled fact of the universe, nothing new or earth-shattering about it. And hey, maybe that was true. It sure
Castiel just stands there, regarding him with a piercing gaze. Probably trying to figure out what type of freak he is. It doesn't help Dean can’t seem to keep his eyes from darting to all the places they shouldn't, and God, he hasn’t even seen him from the back yet—
“How long have we been neighbors for? I don't remember ever seeing you around.”
“Alright, calm down," Sam says, holding up a placating hand. "You said Castiel is sterile, right? So it’s not like he's actually going into heat."

“What?!”
in love with Cas is an understatement. Obvious to anyone with a working set of eyes. He just hadn't gotten around to
“Unless both of us went cuckoo at the same time, I'd say it is," he reasons.
Dean's whole body relaxed at that, a breath he didn't know he was holding leaving his lungs. His lips curled into a sheepish smile, and he leaned in to rest their foreheads together.
“Wait, wait, wait—you're
“Back'atcha,
Dean perks up in his office chair. “Show me.”

“Thanks, boogeyman.”
Dean does a double take. "Really?"
go - he has to. He can't stick around and make everyone as miserable and hopeless as he feels. He can’t spoil his little brother's one chance at happiness.
"God, you’re like a war tank,” he blurts out, eyes playing over the wide breadth of his shoulders, gauging him.
“That’s rich coming from the guy who’d live in a Wendy’s if he could.”
“I’m an idiot,” Cas mutters.
“She was busted up when my dad passed her down to me,” he says, pride swelling in his chest. “Took a while, but I managed to put her back together.”
Cas laughs, shimmying free of his hold and stepping back into the hall. “Get out of here.”
…” Cas sings, failing miserably to stay on key.
Billie chuckles, checking her wrist watch. "I have to go. Date night—Victor's cooking.”
“Alright, we're done here,” Dean grouches, disabling the screen-sharing mode. Showing Cas embarrassing baby pictures of Sam backfired epically, his freckled 4-year-old self making quite a few guest appearances.
“You nabbed that fancy condo?!”
He spins around to find Cas standing across the room in short, silk pajamas. The sight makes his blood rush to all kinds of places it shouldn't.
“Like you were in some sort of trance," Castiel completes. "Me too. That's why I hit that car. And then I saw you—”
He swallows. "You mean…?"
"Shut up," he barked, leveling his eyes with Castiel's, desperately hoping he'd understand.
"I dunno, maybe he's one of those all-bark-no-bite types," he replies with a shrug. "The asshole had me seeing red, I'll tell you that.”
“Trust me, you would
It's not like they weren't implied. They were inextricably there, branded in each look, touch, lopsided smile and conversation they've had since Cas got back. Hell, it ain't like they haven't done all kinds of couple-y shit by now. They've shared everything from beds to clothes to shampoo to aftershaves, stolen food off each other's plates and fleeting kisses after that, laid their heads in each other's laps through Scooby-Doo marathons, fingers absently rubbing each other's scalps. Dean's hands have been places no "friend" would get unfettered access to - tangled in Cas's hair, dug into the flesh of his thighs, curved around the swell of his ass, tightly wrapped around his—
inaccurate—I’m a water Pokémon."
He can't help but smile at the sight of him. Cas looks like he left bed but bed hasn’t quite left him, hair wild and a baggy hoodie all but swallowing him whole. It’s a far cry from his usual porcelain doll look, and every bit as gorgeous.
“Yes?”
"Okay," Castiel finally says. Dean releases a breath he didn't know he'd been holding.
“I’m not calm—I’m

“Is Randy here giving you trouble, mister?" Dean interjects, stepping in between them.
Dean smacks down that train of thought, guilt stabbing him in the face. What would his mother say?

He scans the vast field where Chuck just met his end, a large patch of previously bright green grass now turned to embers. Like phoenixes, they all rise from his ashes, materializing just as easily as they had vanished.

dream place for Sam.”
“Yeah, just a little dust...” He winces, pushing the heels of his hands into his eyes. “Sorry, didn’t mean to make a scene there.”
“Well, you fell on the concrete, nearly broke your ass, you were bleeding all over the place and I rushed you out to the hospital, you ‘member that?”
Some trivia:
," he retorts.
"My parents' reputation precedes them."
close."
Suddenly, several bits of information collected over dozens of conversations line up in Dean's head - Castiel's last name, the fact he's half-Brazilian, 'Naomi'...
, seriously?!"
Dean can’t help checking Castiel out from behind as they walk to the elevator. His baggy sweater fails to conceal wide hips flaring out from a deliciously small waist, skinny leather pants hugging a shapely pair of legs and an ass to beg for. He stands at a solid 5’11’’ – average height, but substantially shorter than Dean. Towering at 6’8’’ comes with a fair share of nuisances, but the thought of dipping down or lifting Castiel for a kiss makes all that fade into insignificance.
Alex looked down at her tapping foot.
"So, is your real name Junior, or are you Garth the second?" She wanted to know. Junior chuckled.
“You owe me, Jones.”
"Yeah? I remember trying to get you to play catch with me, and you turned my softball into flower petals."
He stood and wiped his eyes with the tissue before he followed Kevin back into the house,  where they set about finding a way to carry his statue into his quarters. It was heavier than he had reckoned on, but as Kevin didn’t complain, he didn’t either. He put it in pride of place in his artwork room, and Kevin disappeared again before Castiel could engage. He sighed, and looked up at the face of his new artwork. Dean’s artwork. And an absurd thought came to mind. He was alone, and he had no one else to talk to. She was so lifelike, despite the medium, and she wouldn’t fill him with false hope.
“I’m not Manny,” Castiel reassured him. Sam put an arm around his shoulders.
They both looked at the gods, satyrs, naiads and dryads who were all celebrating the intangible thing that influenced so many of their actions through time, and then smiled back at each other.
“How do you stand it?” She mumbled.
'Yeah, I have to stay a virgin.'
“You’re just in a towel.”
“I think she will. Like Jack said, break ups are tough. Especially when you’re not the one deciding to break up.”
“Blue and green.” Castiel sounded confused. “Bear, you know it is.”
“I can’t believe I won’t see you for a week,” Castiel moaned. “I promise we’ll call.”
“Hey, I’m ready,” Dean spoke directly to him. He nodded to his friends. “See you later, kids. Don’t wait up.”
“We’ll take it slow with the angelic duty bit, obviously. I’m not going to be calling on the both of you to fight for Heaven or to worship me when you’re meant to be in Cancun on your honeymoon. I mean, there will be something, but I suppose you’d have to get used to all that power first. I think you could be an asset to Heaven, Dean.”
“Want me to tell anyone who’ll listen just what I think of your eyes?”
Back in camp, Dean and Castiel hurried to the bunks to get a secluded one for themselves. They undressed hurriedly, and came together almost violently, their chests slamming against each other, Castiel grabbing Dean’s head and pulling it right back, devouring his mouth with his own. Dean wrapped his legs around his lover, and they fell back onto the bed, almost thrashing against each other, lips exploring whichever bit of skin their could reach.
Once the girls had gone in the morning, and Claire was cleaning up the debris from their evening, Castiel joined her, straightening sofa cushions and looking very much like a man who wanted to have a Conversation.
“Meg, that ring is exquisite. Where did Castiel source it from?” Antonia gushed. Meg turned to her friend, and Castiel felt a hand around his other elbow, firm and forceful, leading him away from the women. He had no choice but to follow the pressure, to see what Dean wanted with him. Despite the contact, Castiel could feel the panic rising, and felt sick at the idea of looking at Dean, at seeing the man he was crazy about and picturing him the way he had looked the last time they had seen each other as Dean yelled at him or ordered him to leave.
“You do, but it’s fine. We all laughed. And my work is going to notice I’m not bringing so many bacon double cheeseburgers home.”
“I’m your employee, really.” Kevin pointed out. “But yeah, you’re my favourite Novak by miles.”
'Are you okay, kid?' Sam asked as Dax sucked in the air from the inhaler. Dax nodded, waiting for the air to kick in so he could reply. Sam and Krissy waited patiently for his breathing to slow down.
Claire nodded, and bent down, meeting Alex’s mouth with her own. She ran her fingers through Alex’s hair as her girlfriend put a tentative hand on her upper arm. This time, Claire didn’t freak out at all. Everything felt calm, even as Alex stepped closer. She was just feeling like she could handle it if things went further, when a yell cut through the moment.
The man dug his spear into the dry earth below their sandalled feet, turning the soil over pebbles and dust..
“Okay, would you’ve preferred it if I was like, Alex is my girlfriend, that’s why I spend so much time with her? Even though we agreed not to tell anyone yet because you didn’t want crap for it, even if it would have made it so much easier to protect Dean and Dad? I did the best I could, okay? Like I’m doing the best I can now.”
“I’m sorry your mom died.”
Sam chuckled quietly.
Dean pressed another tender kiss to his cheek.
“Uh, yeah,” he gave a small chuckle. “Pinky promising that if she woke up soon, I would buy her some Ben and Jerry’s and we’d eat our feelings over the game. I guess I was hoping she’d hear me.”
'Dad, I don't think it was Bear, the toy I knew would never lead me straight into danger like that. She must have been possessed or something, and I was too young to notice. I must have gotten rid of the angels somehow, I must have done something I wasn't aware of. Everything exploded, and the next thing I remember is walking around a town I'd never been in before, calling for you and Mom, until they took me to the police. I remembered enough at the time to remember when you and Uncle Sam came to get me when Mummy Cassandra died, I knew I couldn't say anything.'
Castiel nearly blacked out. Did Dean mean that, or was it a phrase he knew well?
“I kept waiting for one of you to show up. Or for Dean to see my last text and come and disrupt the wedding.” Castiel admitted.
Sam looked him dead in the eye, and Castiel was treated to the way Sam’s legal opponents must feel when they came up against him. He had a steely gaze and a set to his mouth that meant no nonsense. It appeared that Dean’s brother was very expressive. But he was also polite.
'I love you Cas.'
'I don't know, Faith. Cas thinks it's all going to work out. I'm trying to have his optimism.'
Faith shook her head, heaved another great sigh, and turned to face her father, not quite meeting his eye.
Alex had promised to work through things with her, she had said she would be so understanding of Claire’s limitations, and yet when she had needed her girlfriend the most, she hadn’t been there. Things had been awkward at school since then too. So many kids Claire had never spoken to before gathered around her, wanting the dirt on Dean and Castiel, on what their principal was like behind closed doors, apologising for how she was treated with fake promises that they had never believed it. Alex avoided Claire’s accidental new audience during the halls and at lunch break, and barely spoke in class except to answer direct questions from the teachers.
Gabriel just laughed, and took Dean's last position.
'I guess they were attached to the field. While it was left alone, there were no problems, but as soon as they started building on the land, they disturbed the bones, or disrupted a curse. It's going to take a lot of talking to convince them to remove the factory and leave the ground alone.'
She nodded, and rolled over, getting comfortable for some sleep. But she couldn’t shut out the sound of her parents talking, breathing the words to each other in the dark.
'Um, no thanks Dad.'
Both of Castiel’s brothers walked out again, and Castiel rested his chin on Dean’s shoulder.
“He persuaded me that it was better to marry Meg and let her take charge. That he knew my heart wasn’t in it but Meg had always been there for me and she was decisive. And when I spoke to her, she said it was a great idea, and she was surprised Luke came up with it.”
“I thought you were trying to make up with me?”
“I don’t know,” Castiel mused just as the doorbell rang. They both looked up at it as though they could instantly know who was on the other side of the door that way. Dean, who had been walking through from the bedroom, made his way to the door and did the sensible thing of opening it, going down the stairs to greet the person on the other side. “And that might be the reason why.”
Dean left the room, and Castiel tried to pull himself together. Dean seemed more reasonable than he had at the art show, or the barbecue. All he had to do was start talking, find out why Dean was no longer interested in him, maybe talk him around. This was his best shot at knowing. He watched as Dean came back in, and slowly unveiled the statue he had made. Again, Castiel was amazed by how Dean had somehow created details by using the air. He was so talented, so creative. But the moment she was unwrapped, Dean walked out of the open front door, taking the packaging with him. Castiel came out of the house, watching him secure the trailer and head towards the front of the car.
'Fine. One night. But I'm not going in naked, and we don't let whoever lives there give us any bullshit.'
Gabriel stopped pacing, and turned to smile at them both.
“Were you like this all night and I just didn’t realize?” Castiel grumbled.
Ben sighed, still looking at the floor, his hands now clutching his crutches where they rested in the corner of his chair.
It was too crazy to dwell on. And if she did, she’d end up thinking about Alex, and everything that hadn’t worked between the two of them, and how dating Jack wasn’t an option. They were related, and Claire wasn’t girlfriend material. She went into the bathroom with a book and some bubble bath, playing music on her phone and making herself focus on anything but her cousin.
“If you’re both sure, then okay.”
'Look, we landed in nerd heaven!'
'Dax? She said, her voice thick with sleep.
He walked through the bunker for ages. He kept thinking he was there, the music was getting louder, more instruments joining in. It was almost unbearably sweet. So sweet that it took all of Dean’s concentration, and he was somehow out of the bunker, walking up to Castiel and looking around at the new scene. Castiel was in his suit, but no trench coat. Dean looked down and realised he was in one of his fed suits.
“Cas?” Dean’s voice came from the doorway. Castiel could sense him coming into the room, his concern filtering through the air and being absorbed by Castiel’s Grace. All his senses, even his angelic ones, seemed heightened as he got used to the Grace again. “Cas, there was nothing on your face. I don’t get … are you okay?”
'Tell me about it.' Faith nodded back, flipping the pages again. 'I just hope I get something cool, like turning water into wine.'
“No. We’ll fit my stuff in, get settled, and then you can come bring the zoo.”
Dax nodded, feeling as though he'd been scalded by the elder hunter, and followed his girlfriend out of the motel room.
“Megan Masters, you
'I'm not upset, I just wanna go.'
Dean’s tone had gone bitter, and Castiel wished he knew what Dean was thinking. He decided to explain himself more, so that maybe Dean could understand his viewpoint. Maybe then Dean would start opening up again.
'I know that when God came along-'
“Good night Claire Bear.”
“I will always say Gabriel. But good effort by these guys.”
“What’s wrong?” Benny wanted to know.
Dean pressed a gentle kiss against his temple.
“By saying I get to spend time with you.”
Michael, to his credit, didn’t badmouth Meg, but turned to Raphael.
She continued to watch them, and Dean slowly slid his arm around Castiel's shoulders, holding him with a tight grip. And then Dean bit the bullet.
'Maybe we should seperate them?'
"I'm not sure why he did it, he didn't let me in that far."
“How honest can I be without embarrassing you?”
“Almost as hard as getting people’s names right,” Claire nodded. Patience frowned for a moment, before her expression cleared, and she gave a small smile.
“It sounds boring, where you guys are going to live.”
'You come first, Faith. Let him and me worry about the practicalities of something going wrong, okay?'
“Ben’s going back to Lisa soon. You don’t have to have him.”
Castiel wanted to believe him, but it would be so Michael to think up a cover story like that. And he didn’t want to be paranoid about Dean, he didn’t want Michael to sound so unsurprised that Castiel had bit the bullet and asked Dean out. He just wanted to enjoy the company of the man he was crazy about already. Dean was still talking.
“Or, she’ll realise that she needs to communicate with you properly, and you might end up with someone you care about. Give her the benefit of the doubt.”
“Apparently it’s best if they forewarn people about me, so I apologize that you weren’t given any information.”
Claire didn’t want to talk with someone who used the word ‘like’ every time they inhaled, and thank goodness, their teacher walked in before she had to. She got on with her work, even as classmates who barely gave her the time of day tried to slip her notes. Unfortunately, her teacher spotted the girl next to her trying to hand her one of them and swooped in, grabbing the note and unfolding it. And then, in a classic asshole-teacher move, read the damn thing out.
'What?'
“You’ve met Gabriel and still consider me to be fortunate?”
When their bodies had burned, and there was nothing but ash left; they dug a hole, and buried the remains of Sam and Gabriel together. Dean heaped the soil back over the ash, and Castiel laid a stone with their names over the mound. They stood together silently, looking at the overturned soil until it was time to return to Olympus.
Jack chuckled, and squeezed her in a one-arm hug before heading back to the car, and home.
Castiel nodded, and headed into the kitchen where Daphne was eating her meal. He scooped her up and she flopped in his arms, resigned to the journey even as she mewed loudly.
“I am too,” Claire assured her. The adults all ignored them to chatter amongst themselves, until Dean finally had the sense to introduce everyone.
“Are you okay, Dean?” He asked quietly.
“I’m going to bed, if Dean asks. Can’t believe I lost a game,” she shook her head in disappointment and stalked out of the room, muttering about how humiliating it was. Castiel watched her go, and looked at Kevin, who was curled up in the armchair, his eyes closed and face slackened with sleep. Castiel called his name tentatively, and he didn’t stir. He looked around the room, at all the paraphernalia that made up the Winchester’s downtime, and wondered whether it was wise to leave. Dean hadn’t wanted physical contact all evening, had cringed away from him constantly. Charlie still disliked him, and Kevin was either worn out or bored.
'Dean, it's going to be different.' Castiel promised. 'Michael and Lucifer, that was about the apocalypse. That was about destruction. But Father's behind this, how can it be anything but positive?'
They fell silent, and Claire peered over the back of the sofa, to see them kissing, Dean bracing a hand on her dad’s arm, though Castiel kept both arms down, hands fisted like he was trying not to grab Dean and pull him closer.
'Why do you think she has to go to Bethlehem? I mean, I don't know that Bible story too good, but didn't Mary and Joseph have to go for some census?'
“Are you okay?” Castiel checked.
Chuck hesitated beside Claire, looking to Michael, and Claire spoke up.
“Very funny,” Dean flicked a pea at his fiancé.
“My reputation precedes me?”
“If she wants,” Claire said as she turned on the sofa, watching Dean take food out of the grocery bags.
'No,' Dean breathed as he swallowed the last mouthful of beer. 'I think she's got used to it by now. It's not about getting to you Cas, she's known that name for a lot longer. And maybe there's a point to it, you know? And at least people can say this one. Even I struggled with it.'
“What about it?” This time, Dean sounded wary rather than disgruntled. Like he didn’t want to be asked about it. He also seemed somewhat distracted.
“Two weeks.”
Castiel pursed his lips together.
“I think this is why I was drawn to you. I know your emotions are going to be genuine. Which means we’ll look after each other properly. And I promise you, Dean, I will fight hard to keep you safe, whatever the cost.”
“So, Dean,” she spoke at a normal volume, ignoring Mary shushing her. “We’re so bad you’re moving out of state, huh?”
Dean was right, he was worth much more than fifty thousand for an evening.
'I don't think so, Faith. I'm sorry.'
“You wanted me to draw you?”
'Yeah, it tickles.'
“It’s almost like you’re my dad or something,” Claire teased.
“Maybe we should encourage Claire to make friends with the matheletes. This one’s bad news.”
He turned back to the stove again, as Faith gave his back a filthy look.
“Will you tell me as soon as you find out? Or get her to call me?”
Claire nodded, and watched as she was transformed into a girly girl. It was a strange sensation. After the hair, the assistant opened the door and she walked out. Dean and her father were standing close together, talking softly, but they both turned as she walked out, Castiel’s face softening into a soppy expression as he leaned against Dean. Even Dean looked like he was close to tears.
She rolled her eyes, and Mr Winchester fought a smile. The fact that he agreed with her father was worse than their eye fucking.
“You’re such a dork,” Sam muttered. But nevertheless, it had worked. Castiel appeared in front of them.
“Never you mind. Leave now.”
“No wild parties with Jack,” Dean tried to sound stern, though it was ruined by the smile on his face, the one that had been there since the morning before.
“That much is evident.”
Dean looked dazed, and Castiel manoeuvred himself around to rap his knuckles on the dividing screen, knowing Kevin would understand the gesture without having to wind the partition down. He watched as Dean slowly pulled himself into a sitting position, still on the floor. He couldn’t see Dean’s expression, but after that kiss, he didn’t need to. He couldn’t stop himself from reaching out and touching Dean, running a hand through his soft brown hair, trying to recreate that side parting. It sprang back into place, and Castiel couldn’t stop himself from doing it again and again. Obviously, Dean used some kind of styling wax to keep it in place.
Claire looked up as she walked out, and slumped sideways on the couch. Castiel was closing up the store that night, she had a couple of hours before he would come up. She looked up at the ceiling, and spoke softly.
Castiel was lost for words. He just nodded.
Sam and Dean exchanged another look, before Dean shoved a packet of beef jerky into a side pocket of his rucksack.
“Dean? What is this place?”
Ordinarily, the place was a giant play area for kids, but one Sunday a month they gave it over to teenagers and adults. There were swings and ball pits and huge slides and vinyl covered cushioning everywhere. They shut their jackets and shoes in a locker with Castiel’s wallet and car keys, and Claire went running, jumping straight into the ball pit and nearly landing on some college guy’s head. She turned and saw Castiel try to step carefully into the pit, only to sink comically, losing his balance. Claire barked out a laugh, and went wading away from him, the balls making that satisfying plastic clicking sound all around her as they moved out of her way.
Castiel took her to a restaurant on the outskirts of town for dinner that night, and he finally brought up the subject of Alex during their entrees.
She followed him back to her friends, where he took a spot beside Kaia and started talking to her right away about her vision. Patience was still on the sofa in her rigid position as though she was afraid of Dean judging them outside of school hours, and Alex slipped an arm around Claire’s waist, pecking her cheek and whispering in her ear.
Eventually, Jack leaned back against the tree and sighed, looking up at the apple blossom above them. Claire rested her head against his shoulder.
“We’re making progress, Cas,” Dean turned and looked at his boyfriend. “She didn’t say ew until I mentioned high school boys.”
Claire didn’t get any further before her grandmother seemed to faint, her grandfather barely supporting her. Dean took action straight away.
'I don't understand the reference,' Castiel frowned. 'I'm not a funeral plant?'
“Yes. Accidentally. And my mom died.”
Castiel just smiled mysteriously.
“She’s nice, you know.”
“Perhaps.” Emmanuel shrugged, focused on his origami napkin.
“Then yes, thank you. Yes!” He laughed as he stood up to hug Dean, and then Castiel. Claire caught her father’s eye, and gave him a small smile.
“It’s a surprise.”
That night, Faith had climbed into the bed, and waited for her father to come in, her thoughts tumbling between Junior and Dax. Truthfully, she hadn’t made her mind up about what to do. She wanted Junior, she knew that much, but Dax had been a big part of her life. And maybe, when she was pregnant at seventeen and under a chastity vow with God in order to have a shot of getting into Heaven when she finally died, she really shouldn’t be thinking about boyfriends.
“Sorry, it’s just … Dean.”
“Okay, Kaia, boys, come with me. Girls, did you want to make a complaint?”
'Okay.' Faith's voice was barely audible.
She was still so aware of every part of their bodies touching, of how their breasts latticed together, how their groins were close. Every shift of Alex’s shoulders or hips sent shockwaves through her. And yet … she was okay. This was okay. She took a shaking breath in, and parted Alex’s lips with her tongue, feeling Alex come up to meet her. It still felt weird, and slimy, but it wasn’t as unpleasant as last time. She could do this. She even felt bold enough to put a hand on Alex’s waist, feeling the way her girlfriend juddered under her, like Claire’s touch alone was intense. She teased her fingers along the hemline of Alex’s shirt, as Alex’s hand slid down, grazing the top of her ass.
“No,” the young boy cut his enthusiasm quickly. He spoke rapidly, anticipating Dean’s anger. “Sam was eromenos to a man named Gabriel. Recently it was noted that Sam was coming of age, that he must leave Gabriel and find his way in the world.”
“Nothing.” Castiel said quietly.
“It’s fine, Claire. I can close the store. Great job on the tops of the shelves.”
Dean stepped closer, but didn’t sit down. Instead, he slid his hands either side of Castiel’s face, cupping it gently, sending a tingling sensation all over his body. He loved the way Dean’s hands felt against his skin, rough and hard but tender too. He followed Dean’s touch as his head was lifted slightly, and then Dean’s mouth was on his, his lips warm and soft, with just the right amount of moisture. Castiel couldn’t help but reach out and touch Dean’s chest, his stomach, enjoying the taut skin and firm muscles through his thin shirt. He reached up and pushed Dean’s jacket off his shoulders, and Dean reciprocated faster than Castiel could have expected, sliding his hands down and shucking off Castiel’s jacket, flowing down his body and untucking his shirt. Castiel stopped kissing to pull off Dean’s tie, and then they were practically wrestling to undress each other, stealing kisses as they pulled at zips and tugged buttons roughly and touched skin as it was exposed. Castiel broke off quickly to dive into a hidden compartment, where he’d stored the condoms. Dean chuckled when he saw what was in Castiel’s hands.
“Thanks Dad. And hey,” she said as he began to walk away. “It’s all going to work out. One way or anything, we’ll make it happen. You won’t have to say goodbye to Dean.”
“Claire? That guy doesn’t seem like the type to give up. I’d rather get a new server than have the fall out over this.”
'And what's that?' Faith demanded. Gabriel shrugged, trying to cover himself.
“You said you were confused, that you didn’t even know if she had kissed you. And if it’s something you want, of course I’m going to support you. But do it for you, because you feel something for her. Not to score points off your grandparents, even if it’s in my honour.”
“I want to go see Alex,” Claire decided. “I need to make sure she’s okay after today.”
Faith felt her heart sink. Dax had been so interested in all the books and documents that were in the bunker, hadn't he? And Sam and Charlie had been so welcoming, so glad for another member of the dork squad that they'd let him right in. How had she not seen what Dax was, before? How had she never questioned any of his motives? Her mom was right. She was right. Just like Dean, she was easily manipulated. She was going to give it right back.
“You didn’t have to take them all in,” Dean said quietly.
'Siobhan Mary Winchester.'
“I will be. I didn’t know you worked here.”
“Sure. Got some place in mind?”
“I said shut
They stopped at an abandoned cabin, not far from their destination. Everyone was exhausted, and cranky, their feet were sore and all anyone wanted to do was eat and sleep. The only problem was, there was only one double bed in the cabin. Gabriel disappeared to get some food, and everyone tried to debate who would sleep in the bed, and who would sleep on the floor.
The hall was dark, the only source of light came through the cracks in the walls and ceiling where the street lamps shone through. Two figures clung to the wall as they stepped cautiously through the building, their shoes barely making a sound. They held their breath as the one in front stepped forward, easing open a door.
The scene went dark for a moment, and when she blinked her eyes open, she was laying across Dean's knees, and he was stroking her tiny torso gently, eyes focused on her as beside him, Castiel talked with Cassandra. He saw her eyes flutter open and smiled, reaching down to kiss her forehead gently and she surprised them all by calling him Daddy. Dean started laughing, making her repeat it for Castiel and Cassandra, propping her up on his lap as though that would help them hear better. They wanted to hear Faith say their names too, and she happily babbled them, Mommy and Cassandra. She didn't understand why Cassandra looked upset at that.
He returned her smile and walked down the hallway, and Claire made her way to her first class, passing a group of senior kids on the way which included Devon. He saw her as she noticed him, and she nodded her head away from his friends. Surprisingly, he came away easily, waiting for what Claire could possibly have to say. Maybe he had been expecting the apology. Unfortunately, his friends whooped and catcalled as they moved away.
Castiel continued staring at Dean's firm chest, his muscular arms. It was easier than meeting his eyes, easier than letting himself think all the things he wanted to think that he didn't want Dean reacting to. He pictured himself tucked in Dean's embrace, safely surrounded by those arms, fully loved by the man he adored. Dean chuckled.
“Congratulations,” Castiel smiled warmly, taking Dean’s hand. Dean squeezed his fingers hard.
'I don't know, Faith. I honestly don't. I'd love to know what happened that day. Don't blame yourself either.'
She snuggled further into Dax's arms, still crying hard.
So Claire told Jack, as he carried on touching them, separating the charms and looking at them closely as she spoke. Their heads were bent together and the whole thing felt intimate, Jack tracing a finger along the inside of her wrist. Did he have any idea how it made Claire’s whole system stutter when he did that? When he sat so close, his attention solely on her, talking as though everything they shared was a secret, it was so hard not to feel something for him, to lean that much closer, to smile at everything he said. It took a lot of effort to turn her attention on her dinner, even as Eileen looked at her and asked how she was feeling. She signed back clumsily, showing off the extra lessons she had been giving herself. Eileen signed back slowly so that Claire could keep up.
“It’s about as ready as it’s going to be.”
“I hope it’s okay we kept you off school today. I didn’t think you’d be up to it.”
Posting this at like, 5 in the morning because I can't sleep.
Claire didn’t react, didn’t speak. She took a seat and looked up at Alex’s adoptive mother, waiting. Jody shot Dean a look, but he soon sloped off to another room.
“You’d have to sleep on the couch. Mom has strict rules about what the others can see.”
“Claire. It’s Claire.”
“That doesn’t sound ominous at all.”
Gabriel shook his head.
“He got to the arena okay. He didn’t want me to wait.”
Devon rolled his eyes.
“No. Although, I was only going to kiss him.”
“I’ve always wondered about this place, who could possibly live in such a small building set in a hill. And you live with Emma in there?”
“Great.” Alex looked away from her phone for a moment, and then looked back. “I have to go, Jody needs some help with some kids that turned up last night. Enjoy Pontiac!”
“I miss you too,” Claire said. She had, to a lesser extent than she missed her mother, but as much as she had missed her friends and the familiarity of the town. “But at least this way you guys get to enjoy your retirement, and I get to know Dad again.”
Gabriel shot a look at Castiel, appealing for help.
Dean sounded so confident. And Castiel scrutinised the painting some more, realising how right Dean was. It was merely a combination of other, more cutting edge contemporary art that had come before. So he could add knowledgable to the meagre amount of information he had on Dean Winchester.
“Where are the kids?”
'So, where next?' Dax asked, hoping the subject change would deter Faith from turning moody.
Castiel reached across and held up Dean’s hand, the wedding ring glinting in the afternoon sun.
'My chest hurts,' Junior groaned, clutching at the site that Stevie had torn. Faith maneuvred herself around to face him, and knelt up, placing her hands over the area and concentrating. Maybe she couldn't stitch a wound up, but perhaps she had enough in her to ease the ache? Junior stopped writhing after a few moments, and calmed down enough to watch her progress. She turned to look at him eventually.
Mary tapped Dean’s cheek, trying to get his attention.
“We’re married. I should see you every day.”
The one small perk of being a billionaire with the connections that Meg and Castiel had was that they could breeze into the hotel and be directed to their room straight away, a bell boy taking care of their luggage and the chauffeur - not Kevin this time - having checked them in and sorted out paperwork. Though Castiel normally hated the trappings of their world, he was relieved to have this advantage for once, as it was less to deal with, and the wedding had been more than enough.
'After flying. My dad thinks it will help my wings ache less. Problem?'
Sam couldn’t answer that one.
“Yes.”
“Athens wants our help?” Another soldier snorted. “Maybe they should stop blaming us for their shortcomings.”
“I guess with some stuff. Would have been nice to know you were flying to Pontiac that time before you were at the airport. Stuff like that.”
He applauded with the other soldiers, and waited until the formal section of the ceremony was over, when the other erastes and eromenos were saying their farewells.
They embraced each other for a moment, before Sam went back for the other groceries, still in his car. Castiel started helping to put the food away, under Becky’s instructions, neither of them daring to discuss Mary Winchester while Sam was in ear shot. As soon as all the bags were in, Sam started helping Castiel.
'Dean'll come around, especially now she's back.'
“I can understand that. Not that … I’m straight.” Kevin coloured. “Sorry, I’m not trying to insult my boss.”
“Hey, fake Dad, I’m hungry!”
Meg is good company, but it wasn’t the same as you being here. I hope you had a good evening. See you soon.
“Okay. Let me know you got there safe.”
"It's really starting to get cold out there," she shivered for effect, and slipped into the seat beside Sam. "Hello Cas, where's Dean?"
He crept into Faith's room in the early morning, sitting on the stretch of mattress beside her head and watching as she slept, resisting the urge to stroke along her wings, and instead watching as she stirred in her sleep, her mouth slightly parted as she dozed. He fought the urge to lift the tendrils of hair from her face too, letting her enjoy the peace of her dreams before reality came by and slapped her in the face.
“I promise not to make any more inappropriate comments about how hard your dad gets me. But you’re doing well at school and you’ve taken to the homeschooling better than I thought you would. Take the break.”
Castiel clung to the blankets harder, burying his face in the pillow, wishing that he didn’t have Dean’s face at the forefront of his sight despite his position.  Had it really only been a few minutes? Had Gabriel’s interlude happened in a nanosecond of earth time? He felt Dean’s hand push against his bicep, trying to roll him over.
“Have a good night?” Kevin wanted to know.
Gabriel rolled his eyes and started scanning the local area.
“Gabriel’s keeping watch. Sam insisted Junior take the sofa, he and Garth are both on the floor. There doesn’t seem to be any sign of danger.”
“I’m good, you?”
'I'm supremely not worried about the Winchesters. But it's always good to have some kind of dirt on people, don't you think?'
“Sounds fun,” Dean deadpanned. Castiel smirked.
'Is that an angel blade?' A small, high voice asked from the other side of Sam. He turned, and saw the small girl standing close beside them, her bright blue eyes locked on the triangular dagger. 'Are you an angel?'
“You know, ever since we met, ever since I pulled you out of Hell, knowing you has changed me.”
Alex laughed again, and adjusted the little girl on her hip.
Dean didn't respond, and they soon realised he was already asleep. Garth flopped down nearby and curled around his own pack, and Junior sat down on a nearby stump, watching Faith as she stared up at her father.
“Where do you live again?”
“Sammy! Sam!” Dean continued trying to urge his brother’s lifeless form.
Jack bit into the pie, and groaned with a contented smile spreading across his face.
Of course Michael had bought a statue. That was almost irrelevant at this point. He had hoped for maybe a split second that Dean was there to beg him to be with him, to forget Meg. That Dean would promise he had no compulsion for Castiel’s money or last name. But no, this was not a social visit, this was a drop off. Apparently, Castiel was supposed to react with more than just a sound because Dean snapped.
“If they’re my friends, they’ll still be my friends when I go back, we’ll stay in touch.”
'I try. I can hang around, right? I love visiting you guys, this place will never stop being so damn cool. I wanna look at the computer room again.'
Blame where this chapter goes on MystikGenie who put this thought worm in my head and had me messaging Cliophilyra and Wayward_Mom asking for advice until it merged with all the other things I wanted to put in the narrative and buried itself in there good and proper. Thanks, MystikGenie!
“Do we all have to move out if we want to have sex?” Ben stuck in. “Sam moved out to have sex with Eileen.”
“Yes, but it’s me, and you’re the smartest person I know.”
Dean announced proudly, after once again spending time away from Castiel. He looked up from his cellphone reluctantly, to see his future husband standing in the entrance to the bunker, leaning against the wall and smirking proudly. It made his features seem boyish and mischievous and-
'Daddy?' Faith interrupted timidly. 'Don't get mad. Please. It's bad enough … please, Dad, I need you right now.'
from the burn of his whiskey. And then they went back to the wedding guests, ready to pose for pictures. There wasn’t an official photographer, but Dean and Castiel had wanted guests to take pictures instead. They began posing on their own, and Jack approached Claire to watch.
“So you don’t remember? I’m that bad at it, huh? I would’ve thought you would remember that.”
“Hey,” she looked at the camera.
'It's not the jump, it's that guy out there. Sam Winchester? I think he wants to hunt me.'
He looked down at the knees of his jeans rather than respond.
“Where’s Sam? You said he inherited this bunker too?”
“Aren’t you meant to be in class?” He asked. “Come on. I’m taking you to vice-principal Harvelle.”
'No, I didn't screw your daughter for this baby. God told me to go talk to her, and he would give her the baby in that conversation. Dean, I love Faith to bits, but I'm not a pervy old man.'
“Guys, stop!” Dean gestured at them all. “Geez, don’t get into the police force, you’d have criminals crying.”
“Maybe when we get back?” Dean leaned closer, and the tension seemed to ease between them. “So you’re not mad at me for kissing you?”
“So, let me get this right,” Dean said, opening the refrigerator and pulling out half the contents. “You have this epic bookstore, and you don’t sell comic books or even recognise the genre?”
“Dad gave me a whole box of these when I got home. Everything he and Mom said to each other when Mom was pretending Dad walked away without looking back.”
'Yeah, you should.'
Castiel beamed again, as Faith changed the subject.
“Actually, before the rehearsal dinner, there’s something I wanted to do,” Dean said. Eileen stepped back, away from Claire and back against Sam’s side, and Dean stepped forward, not towards Castiel, but towards Claire.
“Half an hour.” Castiel was just as cautious this time. Dean being here didn’t mean anything. It was
“It’s all in the wrist. Look,” he grabbed another pebble, and pressed it into Castiel’s hand. The contact drew his entire attention, the tingles along his skin were almost painful, his heart started beating in double time, and yet Dean didn’t let go. He was looking at their hands as he manipulated Castiel’s fingers around the pebble, his gaze was almost studious. Could he feel it too? Was he touching Castiel unnecessarily, just to have the contact? Was he afraid of what would happen if they did make eye contact then?
“Wonder how he’ll tackle the leaping guys.” Sam smirked. “Is your true love giving anything away?”
Jody looked behind her, as though she could see through her own front door, and then she looked at Claire with a fixed smile on her face.
Castiel had noticed, throughout the festivities, that there were a few people missing that should have been there. Regardless of what was going on with Dean, his brothers should have witnessed his wedding. And yet they hadn’t bothered, even in a show of Novak camaraderie that barely existed in real life. Even with everything Michael had said about expectations and Novak duties, the only brother to be at any of the wedding was Luke. It felt like the worst kind of hypocrisy, the biggest kind of betrayal. He knew that Dean had befriended them all, but for them to not witness any part of his wedding? Surely they had the duty to show up, pretend they were happy for Castiel and Meg, regardless of what they actually felt? That was the whole point of being a Novak.
“Oh, I’m sure. It must be a huge ego boost, being chased by a billionaire.”
“What did you pick out?” She smiled. The girl handed them over, and Claire looked at the covers. “Oh, these are great! My Daddy used to read me this one,” she put it on the top to show it. Castiel looked at the book and smiled.
Kevin grinned.
“Perfect,” Castiel sounded choked.
Alex disappeared at lunch break, leaving Claire to a barrage of questions from the other kids that had her clenching her fists tightly around her fork. Some people were just curious about how she and Alex got together, but most people were douches, making all kinds of comments about lesbians that left Claire with a pulsing tic under her eye. She barely saw Alex outside of class for the rest of the day, and knew she wouldn’t see her after school when she had cheer practice. Dean was due to give her another ride home, but he wasn’t able to right away, which left Claire with time to kill. She didn’t want to hang around the car again, in case Dean overreacted about her sitting on it, and she was banned from watching Alex in the gym with the other cheerleaders, so she took herself onto the outdoor bleachers above the track meet, and worked on Sam’s latest assignment, leaving an alert on her phone for when Dean promised he would be done. She breezed through the assignment, and had started on her Spanish homework when the alert sounded. She packed up, and headed out to the lot, but Dean was nowhere to be seen. Claire slumped onto the sidewalk to wait, and fired off a text to Alex.
They didn’t see either of Castiel’s father’s often. Apollo because he had other obligations, Aristaeus because he seemed to prefer his solitude. When Dean asked Castiel about their relationships, he had merely shrugged it off. The only thing he seemed certain of was the fact that they were close friends, but had never had a relationship. Castiel had been born by accident, after all.
'Dude, you're cuffed, you can't move, how about you realise there's no room for negotiation?' Sam sniggered briefly, humourlessly. 'And maybe take Faith's advice?'
“You need to get back over there,” Junior insisted. Castiel glared at him.
Dean felt Castiel kiss the top of his head just as the older Mary appeared in the doorway. Dean and Castiel stood up reluctantly, following her into the kitchen and sitting together at the table, facing her.
Sam tapped the table with his fingertips, a gesture that Castiel understood meant that Sam was thinking.
“Dean said I should get his cell number and email from you, so we can keep in contact about my piece.” Castiel told her. “I should also pay for my sculpture now.”
“But they all know. Garth, and Uncle Sam, and Gabe. They know. So what are you running from?”
“No, of course not, Dean.”
“Yes. Besides, invoking their names can be a bad idea anyway. I’ll just scream your name.”
Dean grinned at Claire, and she busied herself with her meal, hiding her answering smirk.
“Show me why you didn’t want to fight against me, even when you wanted me,” Dean teased back.
“Home movie,” Dean said over his shoulder. “He wanted me to keep it private.”
Castiel put his arm around her, and took a sip of his drink, waiting for Claire to start talking.
Alex shrugged, but didn’t stop undoing the braids.
“Like intuition?” Becky asked as a hand drifted down to her stomach. Sam carried on putting away groceries.
“Oh, no,” Junior breathed. She was in too much pain to ask what was wrong. But again, the agony was only temporary, and she sprawled out on the grass.
“What do you mean?”
The left headlight and side-view mirror are toast, which will definitely slow progress - original DB5 parts aren't easy to come by. If Dean places an order today, it can take up to a month for the pieces to ship from Europe. There's also some shallow denting and deep paint scratches across the left side. He finds himself grimacing at the overall damage - as far as fender benders go, this was a pretty nasty one.
Realization hits a cement truck. “Shit, I didn’t—
Castiel chuckles, a warmth to it that catches him off guard. “You’re captivating."
"No, that's Naomi for you."
He grins, quickly typing up a reply.
“Alright, I’m in,” he says, sitting back down. No response. “Cas, can you hear me?”
“Don’t forget to stock up on food for, y'know...” Dean trails off, hoping she gets the message without him having to spell it out. If everything works to plan, Charlie and Jo will be getting down to mating as soon as tomorrow, and if he knows one thing about heats is you better go into it with a packed fridge.
"She's a good friend—just a little off,” Cas explains. “She makes a habit of popping in unannounced, usually with stuff I need. Sometimes I feel like she’s in my head.”
“Well, it's coming this time, I can feel it. We almost got kicked out of Olive Garden yesterday.”
Dean smiles despite himself, cracking the lid of his laptop open.
"You're probably wondering how I managed to escape," Castiel finally says, and he couldn’t be more wrong. Dean’s not
“And you’re
him?”
He scrolls down his contacts, finger hovering Victor's name as he ponders how much of a dick move dragging him out of bed this late would be. He ultimately hits call - being a pain in the ass is kind of what the whole best friend contract is about, anyway.
Castiel musters a small smile. "They say twins do everything at the same pace, but it was never like that for us. I was younger by only two minutes, but it felt like two years. She was always one step ahead of me," he says. "I only ever had to be a big brother when she was gone. I don't know how to explain it, but being there for Noah is what got me through it. Between the funeral and our parents' divorce... There was barely any time to feel sorry for myself.”
"Hello, Dean."
Castiel bows his head. “I have baggage, Dean," he says, voice barely above a whisper. "I like you, and it does feel right. But I just can't do this with haste."
“You’re Alpha," Castiel says matter-of-factly. Dean opens his mouth, but nothing substantive comes out. “Pardon, would you like some ice cream?”
“I know. I drove you to get your first shots, remember?” Dean reminisces.
,” Cas retorts, but it falls flat. Dean bites the insides of his cheeks - maybe he’s coming on too strong. “You look good, too,” Castiel humors him, a playful spark in his eyes. “And huge.”
“So are we gonna stare or make out?" Dean goads after a moment, mirth dancing between them. "Kinda gettin' some mixed signals here."
He's working from home, meaning he's down to his underwear and one more espresso short of going nonverbal. But a call from Cas is a call from Cas, so he quickly throws on a shirt and hits accept.
"He didn't know, Sam—he
“How come I never heard of this guy before?" she presses on, tailing him up the stairs. "I mean, how long have you even
Translations of the Portuguese dialogue for those unable to view hover text:
“Okay." He leans in, pressing a chaste kiss to his cheek. “Not with haste.”
"There’s more. For as long as I can remember, I've had this thing, in my head. It’s hard to explain, but—”
Castiel’s baby had a real bad day.
Cas glances down at himself then back at him, unfazed. “It’s just a boob.”
His heart feels like it's being held in a tight grip when the elevator reaches the penthouse. He plays it off by lifting Castiel at the waist and backing up inside, “You're coming with me.”
“I’m the guy who’s gonna kick your ass unless you cool it, pronto.”
“You sure? ‘Cause last time...”
“Not sure where to judge you here—stinking up public places with your horny musk or going to Olive Garden.”
A man pops up from behind Cas's shoulder before he can protest.
Dean gives an impressed whistle when he's instructed to pull up to the Museum of Natural History. "You work here?”
“Dammit,” Dean grunts, parting their lips with a wet noise. “S'not fair, I can only hear you when you’re thinking
Castiel quirks a skeptical eyebrow, eyes shifting downward. Dean follows them to find his hands still all up his sweater dress, fingers digging into the supple flesh of his thighs like he
“Okay, before you make fun of me—"
, the notification reads. Heart skipping a beat, Dean taps on it to open up the chat.
Castiel scoffs, pulling away from his arms and tugging at his hand, urging him to follow him to the couch. He gives him a little push, which Dean gladly collapses under, then just stands there, watching him.
“I’m so sorry about your mother, Dean," Cas says, but it sounds nothing like the platitudes he's grown tired of hearing. There's a visceral sincerity to it - the kind you only get from someone who intimately knows that sort of pain.
“'Omegas like me', why would you say that?”
“How can we help?” Cas asks. "We tried researching online, but all Google turned up were these strange, psychedelic blogs."
Castiel beams as he listens to the recording, and Dean implodes a little. He places two fingers between his lips and whistles, blue eyes snapping in his direction.
Castiel's mild fever and Dean's exhaustion don't stop them from having their regular Skype call before bed. Cas drifts off first, leaving Dean to watch him for a couple more minutes before sleep takes over, thumb sliding across the screen as his eyes slip shut.
“Customer? What’d he look like?”
“I’ll go with you,” Castiel jumps in. Dean can barely contain this excitement.
Dean rolls his eyes, pocketing out his phone to shoot Cas a text. "I wanted to check on him anyways—he’s been down with a cold."
” Cas grumbles, switching to video. Dean's heart sinks at the miserable sight of him.
There he was. Hair messy, face soft and eyes bluer than Dean could fucking handle this early, holding out a mug of freshly brewed coffee - the fancy brand he knew Dean secretly loved.
, his mind supplies.
“Please tell me that ain't ice cream you're having.”
Something instantly shifted. The air around them felt thick. Cas took a small step back as if the words had physically struck him. Out of the corner of his eye, Dean could see Sam snicker into his own mug, Eileen softly elbowing his ribs.
She ignores his jab, nodding at the files on his desk. “What’s that?”
Dean slightly moves his collar to expose the blocker patches on either side of his neck. “Y'think I’m an idiot?”
He could call Cas, but given he just got left on read, chances are he won't pick up. Pretending this whole incident never happened by changing the subject would probably only make things more awkward. Castiel's silence is an obvious sign of embarrassment, so maybe if Dean embarrasses himself back he won't feel as helpless. It's flawed logic at best, but he decides to give it a go, using the front camera on his phone to snap his own glamour shot. He hesitates for a moment before hitting send.
Charlie teases.
Castiel looks him over, almost analytical. "You’re sweating."
?” Sam asks like that's somehow the most alarming thing he just said.
“Oh—didn’t think that was a question.” Castiel urges him to continue with a rushed motion. “Yeah, I’m Alpha.”
“Evidently,” Castiel quips, shooting a meaningful glance downward.
"I see..." Castiel says, sounding almost disappointed. Dean's keenly aware of his warmth radiating against his body, and whoa, when did they start standing this close in the first place?
"You're 6'8'', dude," she points out. "Gotta know my references."
Castiel rocks back slightly, as if caught off-guard. “What?”
One, he probably shouldn't have passed on a nightcap with the gang if he was gonna end up drinking at home anyway. Two, late-night TV sucks. And three, he can’t stop thinking about Cas.
“Hell to the
“My pleasure.” He smirks, playfully wiggling his eyebrows.
“I thought your pheromone levels were always higher than average.”
"I can wait," he tells him, unwavering and honest. Cas's eyes snap back to his with something like surprise. "I won't cross any lines, and if you want me gone, I'm gone. But I'll wait if you let me, Cas. As long as you need."
He nods, emptying his mind of everything but what he wants to communicate.
“Text me if y’all eat through everything. I’ll bring in more supplies.”
Five minutes later, Dean finds himself scowling in the passenger seat.
"Pretty sure it was, Cas."
“Shit—” He mumbles, sheepishly tugging the soft fabric back into place. "Sorry."
"Shit,” he curses, immediately picking it up, eyes wide as he stares at the now cracked screen. He blinks one, two, three times, and
Dean scoffs, looking over the papers. “Fuck him. Dude’s got four kids and still drives a sports car—he’s an asshole.”
Besides his day job at the museum, he writes a science column for the NYT and co-chairs the Institute for Strings, Cosmology and Astro-Particle Physics at Columbia. He's half-Brazilian and speaks fluent Portuguese, Spanish, French and German. Learning new things about the guy feels like a never-ending easter egg hunt, every piece of information blowing his mind in unexpected ways.
“Uh, are you sure you wanted to be here?” Dean asked. Castiel looked at him as the wind stirred the bristles of his hair.
Gabriel stopped for a moment, and looked at the front cover.
“It’s tonight.” Alex said over her shoulder, then aimed towards the gazebo where Claire had once cried until Sam had come to find her. It felt like a strange echo of the first time Alex had really spoken to her, and she wondered if somehow they were coming full circle. If they were ending where they began.
“Hugs are never against the rules.”
'You know, it's funny,' Gabriel mused, biting down on one of the liquorice strands. 'That your grandmother - your human one - had her namesake. And that it got passed on to you. I guess history repeats itself a lot.'
“Like him and Dean.”
She stepped back in the house and closed the door, leaving Claire outside. She walked back to her father’s car and climbed in, the normal fight missing. Castiel patted a hand gently, but again didn’t push for any answers. He drove back to the bookstore as Charlie finished locking up, waving at them as Castiel shut off the engine.
“Oh. Okay. Are you worried he’d want more than you can manage?”
“So, what happens now?” Becky interrupted quietly. Castiel wasn’t sure what could happen, he had no idea where Dean had gone. Sam sat up and looked at her, trying to smile, his eyes full of tenderness.
“Oh, are you going out?” Alex asked innocently.
“Do they think they’re Picasso?”
“That’s enough,” their mother warned.
Alex smiled.
“Those are some big words,” Meg patronised, and finally acknowledged Dean. “I hope you enjoy your sexless relationship with this one. He’s big on celibacy.”
“Can I kiss you?” Alex whispered. “Is it okay right now?”
“But you’re incredible, Dean, I keep telling you that. You don’t just capture form; you put life into your drawings. This one of Charlie looks like a photograph.”
It felt like a stab in the heart, and Castiel physically jerked in reaction. Was that Dean’s way of telling him to get lost? Or did he just not realise … Castiel laid it all bare.
Kevin nodded, and Castiel left him in the entrance hall to look for the keys to a car that perhaps wouldn’t be missed by his eldest siblings.
“Cool, cool. So why was Alex over here earlier, screaming at you, Claire?”
Claire gave a sheepish smile.
'Seriously, Uncle Sam, did that sentence sound normal to you?' Faith smirked. Sam grinned back.
He looked down at her, and she looked back steadily, and he was once again breathless over her mismatched eyes. He honestly would do anything for her, if he wasn’t so sure she would kick his ass when he tried.
Castiel could hear the tinny conversation on Sam’s end of the line.
“I’ll hit you with another pillow,” Castiel threatened him.
“It’s going in the show.”
Claire put her hand on her fathers where it still rested on her knee.
"Mm-hmm. You're getting on better with Junior."
“Sure thing. Did he tell you a price?”
Sam and Eileen traded a look, Eileen nudging Sam before he took a card out of his pocket and handed it over.
“You’re weird,” Claire blurted. Alex wound their arms together.
“Hey Claire. Is he ready?”
“You don’t have to do that, Michael.” Castiel decided. “Look.”
'Thanks, Uncle Sam. It means a lot.'
“Mm-hmm,” Dean nodded, and bent forward to kiss his husband. They shared a few happy moments together before Dean’s brothers and sisters returned from the bedrooms.
'I don't see the problem here, Faith. Remember when you cleared the Grand Canyon six months ago?'
“Well, thank you Claire, but we both agreed it was a good idea. You’ve made a big decision and even if you made it a few days ago, it’s not going to be over with straight away.”
This chapter isn't quite in the other version, since Dean didn't remember it. Also, I'm really sorry for butchering French. I used Google translate for what Castiel says, but the rest is pure me.
“Sam! SAM! She’s here, she’s in here!”
The boy slowly started putting the books back, half open and laid on top of each other. Claire cleared her throat a few times until Kieran put them back properly.
Gabriel peered through a broken window with interest.
Castiel forced a smile. That wasn’t the sober fun that Castiel wanted. He wanted their bond, the one he thought they had been forming, the one he’d been hoping for since he first made himself approach Dean.
“Dad, it’s okay to open yourself up to him. He loves you.”
Dean smiled with food in his mouth.
“It might surprise you, but being a principal comes with a lot of paperwork. And technically you’re not meant to see it so,” he shrugged, and clicked his pen a couple of times, before returning to the page in front of him. Claire chewed happily on her cereal for a few minutes, before Dean dragged her back into conversation. “You disappeared last night, everything okay?”
Castiel was fast on his feet, but he kept pace with Dean, running side-by-side across the freshly-ploughed field. They were some of the first to reach the fray, despite being somewhere in the middle of the pack. They worked well together, Castiel using his shield to protect Dean when he stabbed a man in the stomach with his spear, Dean jabbing his newly bloodied spear into a man’s eye when he came too close to Castiel, Castiel using his sword to cut a man’s head clean off his neck when he tried to come at them from behind. They worked back-to-back, cleaving their way through the Argolian ranks, leaving wounded and dying men in their wake. The rest of the band were faring nearly as well, though a couple of soldiers were sporting abrasions from near misses with spearheads before too long.
'I'm the rape child of a demon. I've spent my entire life in the care system. No one likes me at school, my grades suck, and when I can't keep my powers in, I get called a freak and punished for it. I'm sick of it. You're going to kill me anyway, what does it matter?'
“I agree, love isn’t necessarily a feeling. I think that’s lust, that feeling. But love is powerful, it makes you do things you might not normally do because it’s right for the other person. It’s providing a room you never know will be filled, it’s writing letters knowing they’re not being read, it’s giving someone a second chance when they walked out of your life and putting it behind you and just looking to the future.”
“This is just a small debriefing over what happened yesterday,” he promised. “A chance for Claire to explain herself calmly, and we can work out how to go forward.”
Claire sat back in her chair, and looked at the floor sullenly. It was hard not to tell the truth about the whole situation when she felt goaded. When she answered, her voice was clipped with her irritation.
But it wasn’t her father who greeted her in the entrance hall. Dean was looking around at Jody’s pictures. He straightened up when he heard them coming and smiled at Claire.
'Don't move.' He begged her, before running out of the room, hurrying to the kitchen and back as fast as he could. 'Okay, they weren't in there, but Charlie was, she's gone looking for them, they'll be here soon. You'll see, Faith, we're in the best place we can be.'
I dropped my phone. I can’t speak. I can’t do anything. Nothing except cry. Maybe somewhere in the empty, wherever Cas is, he can feel my heartbreak somehow and have the answer that he never let himself have.
Lucifer wasn’t done, of course. He was the one to encourage Castiel to go out and meet a guy and stop stalking Dean. Dating Dean wasn’t stalking him, was it? And yet, Lucifer didn’t appear appeased in the slightest as he continued his digs, giving Dean a very obvious look up-and-down. Twice.
'Flora.'
'Yeah, Mom showed me in here. Apparently I made Dad paint it this colour.'
Castiel hated himself for the words. He sounded so whiny. And there was no good apology that was ever followed by the word ‘but’.
Alex pushed her hair back from her face.
“It’s not about your capabilities,” Castiel spoke to the beer bottle. “I know what you can endure, Dean. I’ve been there for you and your brother enough times to see that, and to see those times you were going to break as well.”
“I think I knew for a while. I think that’s why I’d get mad when you warned me you couldn’t do something and I pushed for it anyway. Like when they did that stupid school council to see if Dean would get fired. I guess I just got so used to the way things were in my life before I found Jody, I expect it in my life constantly. Jody and I talk about it all the time, she’s been slowly getting me to see, it’s better to have you as a friend than not have you at all.”
“He’s been playing it all morning. He does it when he doesn’t want me in his head.”
“It’s okay. I didn’t know if it was normal for a job interview. I kind of needed the job though, I’m graduating in a year and my Mom doesn’t have enough money to send me to college.”
Sorry it took me ages and this is all there is. Been working on my DCBB, and I wasn't happy with where this was going the first time around. Hope it's okay!
“She’s old enough to decide.” Castiel put his foot down. There was the sound of the door opening and then closing.
Alfie opened his textbook dramatically, and rubbed the eraser end of his pencil across his eyebrow, before dropping his voice.
Sam straightened up, reached into his jacket pocket and passed Dean a few pieces of paper, folded roughly. Dean gave Sam an exasperated look before he began reading, the small smirk on his face dropping off as he got further and further into whatever it was Sam had dug up. Faith tried, and failed, to peer over her father's shoulder and read the pages herself.
'What's going on?' Dean whispered over Faith's head to Castiel. Castiel's response was to kiss Faith's hair again, his eyes locked on Dean's. 'Come on, man, you're both freaking the hell out of me.'
'Our camper broke down, we went to the first place we found, and it was theirs.'
“Right, yeah. I wasn’t trying to say … my mom could miss him, even if he was doing the right thing for him, right?”
There was a moment while Dean considered this, resting his head against Castiel’s stomach.
'Yeah, and it turns out, not for the first time. You've talked to him before yourself.' Dean grabbed a beer out of the burnt out fridge. 'I'm going to talk to Faith.'
“How awful! Oh, Claire, now I know why you’re so aimless!” Alex looked at her with wide eyes, and Claire tried hard not to roll her eyes. “Don’t worry, Mr Novak, I’ll watch out for her.”
“That might be good. Are you cool to go from here? I’m still trying to be careful, I mean,” Dean had that awkward expression on his face again, the one he wore when discussing sex earlier.
'Well, if it makes you feel better, a demon killed my mom when I was a baby. Took my dad twenty-three years later.'
Castiel couldn’t move out from under Gabriel’s weight. The barrage of questions was typical of them in everything but the tone they delivered it in. There was no humour, no laughs punctuating the words.
“Am I getting heavy?”
'We've been to Hell, we've taken on Lucifer. Death's a friend of mine.'
“Yeah,” Claire agreed, and then felt bad. After all, Jack lived with them, he was part of the family, in an unconventional way. No one had included him in the brief, unofficial ceremony. “They should have given something to you too.”
“It was only the one hug?” Chuck wanted to know.
“If you don’t know what to believe, then why did you come to me? Why are you putting me above your wife?”
“Mom, did you think this was going to happen?”
Castiel chuckled quietly, and Claire could hear the smacking sound of their kisses.
“I’m not really a person. I’m manifesting as a child at the moment so that we can have this conversation. I’m more of an essence than anything. And I have work to do. Gabriel, take me back.”
“But we’re not paired now.” Dean pointed out.
“No, because Dad’s still with Dean.”
he had informed Castiel smugly after smiting the moment they made contact with the demon. It had been posing as a postal worker, and hadn’t had the chance to do much more than stare in horror at Dean’s new angelic visage before Dean’s hand was on its forehead, and the demon got roasted.
"Wait!" Cas blurts out. Dean freezes halfway out of his chair. “You might want to put on some pants first."
An impatient sigh. “The other one, Dean.”
“Deano, what’s u—” He reels back, nostrils flaring. “Dude! You run out of blockers or something? This is Jersey, not Sweet Home Alabama.”
Cas talks him through setting up the livestream, but it won't stop buffering. Dean stands up, reaching for the internet cable and plugging it directly to his laptop. That's usually enough to boost the speed.
Cas nods, angling his head to expose his neck. Something about the gesture stirs something inside Dean as old as DNA. Instinct takes over. His lips trace a slow, careful line up Cas's throat, leaving wet kisses in their wake. He juts out his jaw when he finds his pulse point, flexing his tongue. Two jets of clear liquid stream out, and he uses his lips to coat as much skin in it as possible. Cas trembles against him, hand fisting in his hair as a string of whines get caught in his throat.
you.”
"Who’s that?"
"Cute," Sam teases.
“No,” Cas sniffles. Yep, he's definitely tearing up. “I just can’t believe you were ever that tiny.” A soft laugh. “I mean, what happened? Did oompa-loompas stick you in a taffy-pulling machine?”
"Cars never lie," he argues. "Besides, Judge Judy can find himself another fuck-pad. This is Sammy’s dream place.”
Dean reaches the Tribeca area in little over an hour. He pulls up to the building’s basement parking gate, punching the code into the keypad.
Dean hums, hand tracing the back of his neck, fingers carding through soft, raven hair. Cas leans into the caress, expression much like that of a happy drunk. Fondness blooms inside Dean, threatening to seep through his ribs and split his chest open. He just wants roll him up in bubble wrap and stick a ‘handle with care’ sign to his forehead, hell, even mark him with his scent to fend off any harm he may come across. It’s a preposterous thought, but true nonetheless.
"Beautiful,” he blurts out.
Parents hug their children. Friends laugh with each other. Sam holds Eileen's face in his hands, beaming like the freaking sun. Charlie clings to Stevie like her life depends on it, fingers curled in her shirt as if to keep her pinned to Earth by sheer power of will.
It’s disconcerting, and oddly cute. That seems to be the standard when it comes to Cas.
“Nope.”
He starts toward his car, no clear destination in mind - maybe a bar stool, maybe the bottom of a river. He doesn't care which.
“Okay?” Dean asks, so low and rough he almost doesn't recognize his own voice. Castiel nods in the crook of his neck, completely boneless against him. “C'mon, lemme look at ya.”
"Dean?" Sam's voice calling his name breaks his reverie.
"G-wagon dude that was accosting Cas the night you met. Any idea why he just ran off?”
“Missouri, that’s not—”
“That's gotta mean you get to meet the aliens, right?” he quips.
Dean frowns. “Should I be offended?”
He shakes his head. “Nada. What'd you think?”
Castiel nods. "I direct the department of astrophysics."
It’s crazy how fast suppressants like Control went from overregulated and unaffordable to highly accessible, over-the-counter drugs. These days even getting a job can hinge on whether you’re on them - most employers aren’t looking to hire people who’ll be out of commission for as long as a week every few months. Dean’s no such employer, but then, his business philosophy does fall outside the mainstream.
"Cas, wait—” He instinctively reaches out, stopping just short of touching his knee - with how wildly uncomfortable Cas looks, it's better not to push it. Then, Dean's rambling, "You’re probably freaking out about last night, God knows I am too, but there’s something about this,
So maybe his first time saying the words wasn't all that epic. Certainly nothing compared to Castiel's sacrifice-laced one. But hey, he's got all the time in the world to try again. And again, and again, and—
“Are you kidding? This is the only thing keeping me
“Hael used to say every person is just a walking mess waiting for a matching one to come along," Cas muses.
“You asking if I wanna see a robot land on a rock in space?
Dean scratches the back of his neck. “So... the landing still on?”
Dean chuckles at the pavement, feeling the tips of his ears burn. "You uh, wanna grab lunch or somethin'?"
Dean stops him, because he doesn't care. He doesn't care how, he doesn't care when, doesn't even care about all the people watching as he surges forward to shut the stupid son of a bitch up with his lips.
"Yeah?"
"Whatever you say,
"You have a gift,” Cas muses, looking over the interior with newfound wonder.
A drip of sweat runs down his temple. The last thing he wants to do is shove another foot in his mouth, but there’s simply no good way to say he’s just never seen anyone this—
“‘Relatively’?”
Dean tentatively reaches out, thumb tracing the slope of his cheekbone. “Does it matter?"
Sam turns confused eyes on Dean. "What?"
Their lips meet with unbridled urgency, but the kiss is gentle all the same, like a storm trekking slowly toward land. Dean groans into it, keenly aware of every second he spent dreaming about this - Cas's body pressed against his own, the sweet taste of him on his tongue as Dean's fingers knead the soft flesh of his thighs, just like they'd done in the car what feels like an eternity ago.
“Ugh,
Castiel stops on his tracks, spinning around to face him. “How are you so calm about this?!”
“Okay, back up a little," he says, straightening in his chair. "Who is this guy?”
Although he'd never admit it given the risk of sounding like a full-blown cornball, he wanted to make it special. Maybe drive Cas out to the countryside, set up a picnic under the stars, light some candles. But that's all shot to hell now, because there apparently is nothing Dean Winchester can't royally screw up.
Castiel sighs on the other end of the line.
“Um.” Dean scratches the back of his neck, inadvertently licking his lips as he gives his delectable frame a brazen once-over.
The kiss is as chaste as it is sensual. Castiel tastes like ambrosia, and Dean feels like he's sinking and soaring, choking and breathing, lost and found, all at once.
"Whatever happened to Eileen, at least she knew you loved her," he explains, taking a swig of his beer. "So yeah, you're lucky."
"Boo, you whore," Cas says, sticking out his tongue, and for a second Dean regrets picking out 'Mean Girls' to watch last night.
their companies merged to form the biggest aerospace empire in the world. That much money and power behind a family name brought along fame, and with fame, a fair share of media attention followed.
The apartment is ample and tastefully furnished - clean and classy, but not impersonal. The details make it feel lived-in, like the constellation blanket thrown across the couch and the shark mug abandoned on the ottoman.
Castiel's soft smile makes him weak in the knees. “Goodnight, Dean."
Cas sighs and fixes him with a flat stare. Several seconds go by. Dean hears nothing.
," he says, eyes flicking back to the screen. "You're all Castiel talks about lately. It's sad, really."
any of that stuff."
"Careful,” Castiel says, smiling wider and brighter than Dean’s ever seen him. “You shouldn’t make me too happy just yet.”
Just trying to make sense of things.”
Dean nods, rolling his eyes when her smile grows wicked. “No housewarming parties.”
Castiel's eyes dart between the ice cream and his face a couple of times, and then he just
Castiel's hand slides up from his shoulder to frame his jaw. “What?”
Dean watches Cas struggle for another minute before it finally hits him.
“One and the same,” he replies, breath warm against his lips. “Stay the night."
Maybe now, with Eileen back and nothing left to kill, Sam can finally follow through with his promise to let him go. And Dean
"What?"
“You know what, it doesn't matter. Just know that I'm sorry for…” He finishes that statement by gesturing at his general self.
The featherlike touch to his fingers runs through Dean’s body like a dynamite fuse. His eyes flutter open as his hands are gently pried off his face, and the first thing he registers is
Dean looks up to find Charlie in her after-work getup – checkerboard slip-ons, bright yellow jeans and a Pokémon tee.
He arches an eyebrow. "Monsters vs. Aliens, really?"
(Castiel) "Get out of here."
” she says, looking him up and down.
,” Castiel cuts in sharply. "Your child is sitting right there."
“How about you mind your own business? My car just left the dealership and this bitch went and—”
“I think… we should talk.”
As far as his knowledge on the subject goes, sterility exists on a spectrum, but broadly means not fully developing into your biotype. It’s rare and without a single cause, and while modern medicine debunked most misconceptions around the condition, a lot still isn't understood.
"I'm so sorry, Cas," Dean says, chest tight.
Dean leans back in his chair, tension rolling off his shoulders. It's been a long, nasty bidding war for one of the nicest condos in Lower Manhattan. He managed to weed out most of the competition in a couple of weeks - all except for Judge Dickhead. He sent Billie in for the kill today, and a kill it was. People don't call her Ice Queen for nothing.
"You didn’t just do that."
“Yo! Earth to
“Dean, will you come in?” he calls out from somewhere inside.
Dean vividly remembers Mom marking him and Sam as kids as a warn off to strangers. Then there was the side of it he’d only learn about in his early teens. He'd always assumed the occasional whiffs of his father's scent he would catch on Mom came from innocent, prolonged contact. He'd later walk in on a scene no kid should have to witness and find out just how little innocence there was to it.
“Ah.” Dean nodded. “I’ll be in the kitchen then, okay?”
Dean growled ineffectively, as Charlie hesitantly placed an arm around him and walked with him into the bunker.
“Me too,” Claire sobered up at the mention of Amelia.
It felt so good to express that. It was all so blatant to him, and he hated it. And he hated how Michael and Lucifer played into it. How Michael would smile and say that rather than buying castles, he had invested heavily in the National Trust and could therefore consider most properties of historical interest part of his portfolio. How Lucifer would laugh and inform them that castles were no longer in vogue and if you were going to throw money away, you might as well buy shares in Betamax.
He eyed a small group of Argive soldiers passing by them, and readjusted his grip on his bloody spear.
Claire forced herself to smile, but inside she had a gnawing feeling. How could it possibly be the best first date ever if she wasn’t on a date with Alex?
Dean nodded, smiling faintly.
“Did he get it right?”
“Ferris Bueller’s Mental Health Day.” Claire nodded.
'So what now?' Dean asked gently. 'Do you want us to go? Can we stay? What do you want, Ben?'
“I really don’t deserve you,” she sniffed. Junior grinned at her.
“You do that for me, Dad.”
The band was first formed in 371 BC by Gorgidas (according to most records, some claim Epaminondas formed the band) after they defeated Sparta at the battle of Leuctra. There are earlier records of similar Theban armies, but none titled the Sacred Band before this date.
'It's not the same. You know it's not the same.' She pushed past him, walking back the way she'd come.
Junior nodded, and scratched over the beanie on his head, climbing out of his sleeping back and rolling it up before sitting next to his dad, watching Faith across the flames. She looked up at him, and smiled shyly, before turning to Sam and passing him a mug. He pulled her into a hug, and she laughed, and they made a small joke about hamsters as Garth leaned in to Junior.
“Probably, but if Mom was still here, you wouldn’t be. And I love her, I will always love her, but that doesn’t mean she was always right. You’re not corrupting me, you’re helping me. I could have gone years not meeting anyone I cared about, having Mom talking about me settling down and getting married and why haven’t I found a guy yet?”
“So? What did I do?”
“I’m honored.”
“Why didn’t you tell me?” She asked softly. “You shouldn’t have had to face that alone.”
“Hey. So, Charlie couldn’t work tonight and Cas is staying at the store, and I thought maybe you and I could go hang out?”
Claire woke up with a start, feeling like someone had called her name.
“Oh.”
Dean and Jody swapped a look, and Dean caved.
A few moments passed, before there were footsteps, and the door opened and closed once again. It was silent then, except for the occasional creak of a book. Jack was obviously using the time to study. Claire blinked her eyes open and saw him in the chair by his bed, making notes from a textbook with a highlighter in his mouth. He didn’t look up, which Claire was grateful for, because she wanted the time to just watch someone being normal before she had to confront what had happened.
“I’ve missed you too,” Alex gave her a small side smirk back. “Okay, so we’re still working out our bugs.”
“Hey Claire, I was going to ask if you wanted to stay for dinner, but your ride just got here.”
Castiel nodded, and they headed up the island towards the giant park, following the pathway until Sam found a vendor to buy a hot dog and a soda from. They continued towards the carousel, and the Alice In Wonderland statues, where Castiel stopped dead. Sam took a few paces ahead of him before he realised that the angel was no longer with him, and then he doubled back to see what was going on.
She looked at her uncle like she had never seen him before. Although she cared about Sam, they had never really had a lot to do with each other. Sure, when she was tiny he had looked after her occasionally, and indulged her Disney cravings. And when they had met again, he had worked out quickly who she was meant to be, but then she had been so taken with getting to know her parents, dealing with her boyfriend troubles, bearing this mission from God … somehow her uncle had ended up a footnote to her. And she had never wanted that. He caught the expression on her face and misread it.
As the sobs began to subside, Claire could feel a well of shame growing in her gut. How embarrassing was it to fall apart like that anyway, but especially in front of her dad. And his date. Her principal. It was gross. But Castiel was still holding her close, stroking her hair softly, riding it out with her.
“And now?” She asked in a small voice.
“You were not raised to speak to me like that, Claire.”
'Okay, we'll work around that.' Dean sighed, and slipped the blade into one of the rucksacks, before gently taking her hand and looking it over. There was no outward signs of damage, though even his tenderest touch felt like blades slicing into her flesh. She bit back the need to shriek in pain as Dean looked over her skin.
“Uncle Cas looks so happy,” he noted. Claire nodded as she watched her dads.
'Do you mean, you having faith, or my favourite niece?'
'No.'
Becky looked down at the binder that was still in her arms, her expression crushed.
“Am I meant to say something about gambling?” Dean asked. “Like, parenting, blahblahblah addiction?”
She saw, in her peripheral vision, Dean turn to look at her, and she kept her focus on Chuck. She wondered if Dean was remembering the same thing she was, the last time he had been over and she had said the same thing about high school boys.
“Patience? Are you okay?” Alex asked cautiously. There wasn’t even a flicker of recognition. Together, Alex and Claire walked over to their new friends, Alex sitting beside her and Claire squatting down in front of her. There was still no movement from Patience. Claire was about to check that Patience was even still breathing when she gave a small gasp, and shook her head slightly, her eyes focusing once more. She took in Alex beside her, and Claire at her feet, and swallowed before forcing a smile.
“Dad,” Claire began, but Castiel was on a roll.
“Thanks, Faith, but it’s okay. And after you disappeared, Dean was destroyed. I love my brother more than anything, I had to be there for him, you know? If I could have brought you back, I would have. Maybe then I could have met someone who began to compare to Jess.”
Dean gestured behind him, and flapped his wings a couple of times.
'A lot, apparently. It's Dean and Cas' girl, Charlie.'
No more trees appeared in the kitchen. But one appeared in the bathroom, where the turtle doves accompanying it took roost in the trees, and the partridge that materialised with this tree seemed to fight regularly with the three French hens.
She looked up and saw him smiling.
They lapsed into silence, both sipping from their bottles slowly, Castiel finding it difficult to drink his around the dish towel.
Castiel nodded, grateful for Sam's support, and he relaxed enough to take a tentative sip of his own drink. He could actually taste the coffee, not the molecules, so at least Gabriel hadn't lied about that.
“Claire, where’s Alex?”
“I don’t know if you’re joking.”
Dean's eyes flickered over to their teenage daughter, and then back to Castiel. He nodded and pulled Castiel back out of the room, across the hallway into the bathroom. He locked the door and pushed Castiel up against it, kissing him passionately as he stripped quickly, desperate suddenly for his angel.
“Uh-huh. I made that.”
“I know she did. But I didn’t have an affair, didn’t move in with another man. I spent my time trying to live an honest life. I didn’t like the office work, so I bought the book store. I wanted to believe I hadn’t lost my daughter, so I made sure you had a space to come to when you visited me. I’ve been waiting for that rush of passion for as long as I’ve been without you, and it came back into my life around the time you did.”
“If you and your girlfriend were in it, that would help.”
'Does Mom know yet?'
“I don’t see Cas.”
Dean’s eyes flickered down to his mouth and back.
And then he stilled, as Castiel’s hands were coated in semen. He zapped himself clean, and skimmed his hands back along Dean’s hips, circling his arms around his lover’s waist as he snuggled into his wonderful chest.
“Dean,” he sighed, and melted into his husband’s arms. The world could have ended right then and Castiel wouldn’t even notice, because Dean’s embrace was his idea of Heaven. Fortunately, Dean didn’t seem to be in any hurry to end their embrace either, but he did start talking to Emmanuel.
“You’re the erastes, you’re meant to be inside me,” Castiel spoke softly. Dean turned his head and grinned.
“Oh, riiiiight, Dad didn’t want to say when we visited Pontiac. Dean’s my principal-”
'Yeah, a guy's my mom, good one! Dax is right, this whole thing is so messed up.'
'God.' Dean interrupted. Castiel nodded. 'But she's a nephilim, she can't get into Heaven. So can you please talk to him?'
'Okay, we'll do our best to get Flora and Stevie in that time. Sam says that Dax has been in contact, we're trying to lock down where he and Stevie are while we concentrate on Flora.'
He spoke tenderly as he caught her chin in his hand, and tilted her face gently so they were looking into each other's eyes.
He heard another hiss, and felt one of Dean’s hands rub against his head, near his ear. He nuzzled against it as he started caressing around Dean’s penis, his fingertips rubbing, his palm cupping briefly before he pulled his fingers tight, their path undefined until he hit one particularly thick vein, which he traced from base to head and back again. Dean tightened his grip on Castiel’s head and pushed his own hand in the way, gripping himself tightly in a way that Castiel could see would be too difficult to prise off. Dean’s knuckles were maybe an inch from his eyes before the hunter began kneading himself. Castiel wasn’t going to be beaten, even if he now had to rush. He kissed the head of Dean’s penis, and licked the tip slowly, his tongue barely grazing the swollen skin.
“Where’s Grace?” She repeated. “I know I didn’t have her for long, but I did think I was going to be having a baby.”
The only reason he was even still trying was because of the new batch of hunters who relied on Sam and himself the way the brothers had relied on Bobby. Hunters like Krissy, who called him her phone guy. But even she knew that Dean would never be in a fit state to go out on the field, even if he wanted to. One look at his sallow grey skin, permanently bloodshot eyes and the huge bags underneath them and everyone would know he was a complete drunk, not a high-standing member of the FBI. The only expectation ever placed on him these days were that he didn't start drinking before office hours closed, so he couldn't slur his words down the phone. Staying sober through the day was his biggest challenge, but he'd worked out a system. If he could be professional for one call, he drank beer until he reached his stupor. If he managed it for five, he got vodka. For ten, he got a decent enough bourbon to drown his sorrows, but the golden days he managed twenty or more, he rewarded his efforts by blanking out to single malt whiskey. Even the completely inebriated worked best to a reward system. Single malt was his gold star for a job well done. Beer was his participation trophy.
It didn’t take long before they came across the Argolis army. At least a thousand Argive soldiers stood across a field used for growing barley from them. They stopped together, and waited for the other soldiers to make the first move. Dean’s fingers flexed on his spear, and Castiel adjusted his grip on his shield. At the command, they brought their shields in front of them, their eyes the only vulnerable part of their bodies as they watched from above the top curve of their shields. Another command, and they shouldered their spears, feet planted in preparation for running or throwing. The Argives began to run towards them, and with a final command, they moved too.
Because of this, it is actually hard to find a lot of concrete evidence about the Sacred Band, and so beyond the basic facts I absorbed, I tried to piece together life from my experience in Athens, the histories and myths and legends I had known since I was taught in school as a kid, media accounts that are available and whatever other sources I could find including the Iliad and the Odyssey.
“Nope. We’re not going there.”
“So, bad meeting, huh?”
‘Please! You think Lucifer even thought he killed me? Besides, it was a good excuse for me to re-enter my personal protection program.’ Gabriel crossed the room and sat on the edge of a varnished desk, looking over his angelic brother. ‘At least, until I heard that it had been a few years and no one had got their ass into gear. And I bumped into the wrong sibling, who dragged me back to Heaven. I think she thought I was going to get mine, but instead well, charisma won. And that Vibeke chick is rotting in Heaven’s jail.’
