On those melancholy days, when Steve couldn’t work out
Being good for Tony…
he knew… but he knew. Like clicking into the right slot, that sudden feeling of rightness as he found that exact place-

“No, I’m sure” Steve cut in, his voice low and breathy and pleading “I want you. Now. I’m sure, please-”
The way every muscle tensed in perfect anticipation, pulling Steve into some ideal version of man. Like a renaissance sculpture of God.
But Jesus Christ it would be
After a moment, Tony worked up the strength to turn and face Steve. He looked
…Would he normally find it
And for a second Tony was so thoroughly overwhelmed by the bravery in Steve’s voice, so endeared by the earnestness of it and so moved by the vulnerability of it, that he didn’t hear the actual words.
But again, Tony didn’t drink. He pulled his teeth free and simply let the blood run freely over Steve’s legs, his fingers still twisting inside him. The pleasure of it rushed up against his limits, forced up hard against them – and fell away.
a sharp clench of anxiety, and an ordinary, everyday pang of hope, simply because Tony knew that he was putting himself out there with that statement-
But it was a different feeling. A good feeling.

face he pictured every night before he fell asleep - this younger face, with a different collection of tiny, silvery scars, and that slightly different energy in his eyes.
It took a good few minutes for his ears to stop ringing and his heart rate to return to normal. Eventually, Steve was able to take a few long, slow breaths without choking on them, and at last got to wiping his eyes – and only then discovered that he’d been crying.
“Good,” he purred against Tony’s throat - waiting until he felt Tony's arms fall heavily to his sides again, before he dug his fingertips hard into his thighs. “I
But Tony didn’t say it - in fact, he had just decided that there was no point saying anything else, when Pepper piped up,
And he began to recognise how
And then had come the truly novel experience of feeling better – because everything
just fell into place in his mind.
And, more to the point, it made total sense for him to have meant
And then Tony glanced up at him, that pretty smile still lingering on his lips-
don’t say you’re sorry, just for saying you’re good enough. Please don’t – please don’t think you can never lose your temper, or say something you don’t mean, or just rant that you

Then he put the Nano-Casing of the Quantum Suit down onto Other Steve’s chest, and hit the controls. Immediately it moulded to fit Others Steve’s body, the helmet obscuring his face. Something about that struck Steve as kind of a shame, silly though it was-

And the larger point was frightening and confusing and horrible.
Tony, without that veil of unspoken tension hanging over them
And then a sudden, intense bloom of heat, as Tony buried himself inside him, moaning Steve’s name as he came..
“It may be that you feel a little unsettled, for a few moments at a time. You may feel a bit more emotional, for short periods.” Dev conceded. “Or, that you’re aware of a lack of inhibition – you may find yourself feeling more relaxed, more open, you may find yourself talking more, or speaking more quickly… All of which is perfectly normal, and will pass.”
“... I’m going to go check on him,” Tony sighed.
“If… that’s okay,” Steve answered immediately, even as his heart leapt into his throat.
The pleasure of it flooded Tony’s body like liquid fire, almost unbearably intense after all that longing - and still not enough.
He wasn’t obliged to love someone in proportion to how much they had done for him, or how much they loved him. He wasn’t obliged to care for everyone as much as he did for Tony.

…He’d hit Steve
The heat under his skin pulled tighter as Tony fixed him with a teasing glare, and replied,

Because Steve was
, for just a second, that Steve looked disappointed
and a forced, buzzing silence in his mind…
“Hm?” He squeaked, painfully aware of how flustered he looked when he glanced up.
All at once, Steve felt terrible for the few minutes of mundane calm that he had managed. He felt short-sighted and selfish, ashamed to have missed so much of the big picture while he was staring at his own little part of it.

sort of report?” Nat enquired coolly, after the requisite respectful pause.
Even that horrible moment in Siberia, when Steve’s entire world came crashing down around him, when he was still reeling in shock and confusion and a lot of guilt, still, he’d tried to keep his wits about him. And yes, he had said some stupid things, and he would always wish he hadn’t frozen like that when Tony asked him if he knew - but he’d
Which was the thing that finally brought the spiral to a painful, screeching halt.
“Meh, I already know all about that project,” Tony waved the enquiry aside…

Steve remembered how
“I should be offended,” he replied. “Don’t I always look well?”
And then Tony leaned over and opened the door wide – and that caught Steve’s attention.

“JARVIS, can you bring up the Avengers –
Steve let go of a visceral scream as the next few waves of this crashed over him – they had sharp edges now, a burning need left in the echo of every thrust,

“So, uh, do we call the others now, or…?” He coughed, dropping his eyes.
But he knew all these revelations were real.
And then, over the top of all the noise in the room, Tony heard something terrifying.
, and thoroughly miserable-
And the fact that he could make whatever he wanted from them.
And, of course, Tony had no way of knowing what it was
Partly, it was just that Tony had become a symbol of Steve’s fresh start - because Steve knew that when he got to Tony again, it would mean that he was really
And for just a second, Tony could forget he’d ever hated himself.
What was very unfamiliar
Another giggle bubbled over Steve’s lips. Bucky grinned at him, somewhere between amused and smug. And then Bucky looked back at Tony, and Tony had that brief panic of what he was ‘supposed’ to do with his face…only to realise that he was already smiling.
And then at last there was that wave of pleasure that just carried on breaking, crashing through him, taking everything with it.
Bucky threw him a snide look. Steve could see him trying not to smile.
, like that. I mean, I know that doesn’t excuse the ‘rattling around the mansion’ line, or whatever it was – honestly, I wrote so many versions of that letter I can’t remember what stayed in-”
come up with a reasonable sounding excuse…
then anything he said would just be a joke…
. At least… it had stopped him being blinded by hurt for long enough to be a bit more rational, allowed him to take back the anger that shouldn’t have been there in the first place. It had helped him see things the way he always should have – which was that yeah, Steve had made mistakes and owed him an explanation and it was right that he dealt with the anger that he’d
And Tony just raised his eyebrows at him,
And then, before anything else came back to him, Steve suddenly remembered-
Whatever happened, this would be real. It would be the first meeting that Tony -
“Are you ready?” He whispered.
Steve, who had never felt any differently about Bucky even after everything that HYDRA did to him – Steve, who hated what had been done to Bucky, and still didn’t hate any part of him.
are you-” Tony stammered, already on his feet and striding over to the wide glass doors at the other end of the room. He caught the shape of Steve, concealed in the shadows and partly obscured by Tony’s own reflection… But still, Tony knew him at once. He gave a jagged wave of his hand and the door slid open… and there he was. Standing there in jeans and a short sleeved T-shirt, his jaw clenched against the cold, little flecks of icy rain sparking in his hair.

And with that came another wordless churning of guilt.
mean, if they were entirely without feeling, they’d have just had me drug you and take your blood at the first appointment. Surely you can-”
“Tonight’s is in… about an hour and a half” Tony informed him, squinting at the clock at the back of the room. “Assuming you want to go tonight. Or there’s a gangbang happening in The Blue Room. Those are our choices, apparently.”
As Steve struggled
Tony’s smile softened, into something almost sad.
It allowed the observation that he had been in pain himself - that it mattered.
what other issues there were. There weren’t other issues. Tony had forgotten the concept of issues. Everything had been boiled down to how good this felt and how physically he needed it and how perfectly obvious it was that he was supposed to do this.

“I’m really sorry,” Tony said with a sad smile. “This isn’t about me, and I’m being an ass about it, and I’m sorry. I just… I care about this, too.”
little pause before Steve hung up.
Maybe, if he could’ve introduced himself to Tony wearing ordinary, modern clothes, and addressed that team looking like a normal, human person…
And it felt so good not to have to find an answer. To be able to let Tony take him by the hand, and lead the way, and not have to scrabble to think of what to do next…
things he’d always have to be careful of, or compromise, or compensate for.
In the ten days since the invitation had arrived, Tony had only thought about that one very specific part of it-
“Don’t worry, I’m not going to hit you, or fuck you – even though I’ve had plenty of fantasies about both, over the years” Tony told him, his voice still rich and full and… him.
“Coming.” He called back, weakly – and then felt a deeply inappropriate regret over his choice of word.
And Steve just pulled Tony against his chest, and wrapped his arms around him. He couldn’t help it. He just had to
he whispered, as Tony moved back just slightly, one hand stroking Steve’s leg-

“Tony, it’s okay, it’s okay” Steve soothed. That protective instinct growing ever sharper, as Tony continued to break down-

And then she turned to face Coulson, the little grin breaking out into a full-on joyous welcome.
It was the way Steve reached up to touch him. The warm, easy way he wrapped his arms around him as he pressed his lips to Tony’s – the unhurried, carless way he kissed him, his lips soft and heavy and almost clumsy. It just felt so…
Or that restless, nagging feeling – and all the reasons behind it.
...But he couldn’t deny that there was a dark sort of pleasure in it.

Steve tried to flinch that one away – but he couldn’t. He tried to tell himself he was shocked at his behaviour, that he couldn’t believe he’d done it, that he completely and uncomplicatedly regretted it. He
Tony didn’t even have to
In a similar warning as I gave before chapters 10 and 11 - it's not that Tony (and Steve) don't say some real things here, that they genuinely mean... but please keep in mind that both parties are high, and that Tony's wording and emotional state are affected by that, and that he's focusing on very specific aspects when he has this breakdown. Much like Steve's earlier (drug assisted) apology, really... Its not that they don't mean any of this, its just that they might not otherwise have put it this way, and it isn't intended as a full and balanced view of things...
“...So, that’s good, right?” Nat asked, in the tone of someone who hadn’t been listening either.
“Sergeant Barnes’ baseline readings suggest he is in the process of waking up,” JARVIS explained. “I would estimate that he will be fully conscious within the hour.”
And then he felt Steve suck against his skin, the low growl rolling through Tony’s body along with everything else-
He recognises that he is awake, and therefore recognises that he
“Try to remember to
And then, without warning, Steve grabbed a hold of Tony and threw him onto his back. A little shout of surprise was immediately smothered when Steve kissed him again, an elated swoon rolling through Tony’s head as he felt the weight of Steve pressed against him. His hips arched up of their own accord, his cock weeping against his stomach. Panting now, Steve moved to kiss Tony’s throat, running the tip of his tongue over the vein in his neck before he nipped lightly at Tony’s earlobe. Tony let go of a high, pleading whine, fidgeting up against Steve as he peppered kisses over the line of Tony’s jaw, and then down along his neck again, and then over his shoulders…
There was an
And he and Tony shared a questioning look.
It was the one option that soothed both his fear of losing Steve and his fear of going ahead with it – a way of walking away without it hurting too much, or a way to keep that option open in his head… He didn’t even have to work out which it was, just yet. If he told himself it wasn’t
of chairs being moved, the gentle rain-like patter of fingers on keyboards. Steve repeatedly scanned the corridor, one end to the other, trying to think of what he would say if he were caught here like this… But then, at the fifth door, he got lucky. The sound of silence. And then, when he nudged the door open-
…Okay, he
“What? No – nothing like that. Nothing other than, just, what we’re working on?”
There was an immediate impulse to run. To simply tell JARVIS not to unlock the door, to not

And, okay, Steve could see just as clearly that Bucky wasn’t sober. He was probably more sober than
Even as he was slowing down he was yelling at himself to keep going, to keep his head down, to pretend he hadn’t seen Tony and hope Tony wouldn’t see him-
“Sort of,” Tony answered, dropping into the seat beside him, “I mean, I think I might’ve worked some things out.”

This was a really intense time to realise you were
And he noticed the fact that Tony was still sitting stiffly. That he was looking slightly downwards, only intermittently meeting his eye…
He couldn’t even be bothered to finish the thought, before he was scrabbling to his feet and bolting for the door.
“You know, when I fucked up as a kid, sometimes my dad would yell at me, ‘

just leave now. They had the information they’d gone undercover to find; they knew what The Facility was, now. They could just report this back – to the Avengers, to the global authorities, to a separate team like the one they had in Wakanda… any number of people who would help them bring this place down. At least if they did that, he and Steve would be at less risk. Arguably, a whole team or Avengers had more chance of stopping ‘Adam’ than just the two of them. And of course, there was the argument of transparency and accountability – their responsibility to follow the protocols, which almost certainly demanded they report something like this back…
And Tony actually sat up in the
And he couldn’t see how saying that he’d simply been selfish and callous and not thought about Tony at all would make Tony feel any better.
If he’d learned one thing from this whole debacle, it was that they both sucked at guessing what the other was thinking. That, whatever else happened, just saying it out loud was always a better answer.

than anything he’d ever felt before-
As Sam and Bucky’s bickering faded into the background, Tony felt his eyes being drawn into the middle distance, his body softening under the baking heat…
As soon as they reached the end of the bed, Steve instinctively went to put his arms around Tony-
, and… complicated, and
“You know this is exactly what I’m talking about, right?” Steve smiled, softly. And Tony closed his eyes, and pinched his lips, like he wasn’t sure whether he was biting back a smile or a sob. And Steve leant in just slightly, and put his hand to the side of Tony’s face – and Tony’s eyes flitted up to meet his for just longer than a second, like he’d really tried to hold Steve’s gaze, but it just burned too much. And Steve smiled, and shuffled forward, and gently guided Tony’s head to lie on his shoulder-
He held Steve firm, and made Steve meet his pace…
Rocking against him, dragging that friction from low in his hips,
That second of unbearable, static anticipation-

He felt the twist of hurt, and panic, and anger – the temptation to throw in a dig, the physical resistance to talking about it.
And then, before he could take another one, a blonde man appeared beside them with a tray.
…And speaking of which.
“You’re absolutely right,” Tony smiled. And then added, casually, “And it’s
Tony’s stomach knotted with guilt when Bucky said that - because, yeah, Rhodey probably thought that too.
He’d forgotten all about the wider context and the later repercussions and all the ways his words might be interpreted – all the things that had ever stopped him speaking, before.

The people who would plead that they were only thinking of what was best for him, that they were only trying to protect him… As they tried to change everything he was. The people who thought they

But Tony just softened, and smiled, and said, perfectly kindly,

He heard the scream get caught in Steve’s throat as a guttural choking sound. His entire body tensed up towards Tony’s lips, one hand clawing over the back of Tony’s head - like it was all he could do to keep from grabbing him by the hair and fucking his face.
His previous musings started up again, just to fill the space.
Because,

Also, just to reassure you, there is *certainly* an element of the unreliable narrator at work, when Steve is musing about why he and Bucky could never be a couple - obviously, these ideas develop and get rethought before too long, and there is a reason we start here. But it *is* a Stuckony Story, I swear to God 😂

“Hm… It’s listed in the medical notes as wiring,” Tony mused, like he was talking to himself. “Not sure that’s entirely accurate, as a categorisation…” And he pondered for half a minute longer, and then added, “Okay, this is potentially a little bit more complicated than I thought – but it’s fine, the principle is the same. I’m just going to have to be a bit more careful…. And do a few things first…” And he walked back over to his tray of tools, not even glancing up.
‘lucky’, even if it didn’t feel that way…
no. Tony was sure of that. Every cell in his body instinctively recoiled from this idea, every part of him knew it was wrong. He was terrified to even think about it.
Which wasn’t the same as wondering if this was ‘better’ - he still knew that it wasn’t. He knew that they
But it got them to talk –
His skin was sticky, and wet, and marked with deep purple bruises that he wished wouldn’t fade so quickly.
Leaping to the conclusion that scared him the most.
“...I don’t remember that,” Bucky replied, sincerely.
Until suit man was right in front of them, and Tony finally registered that he had to work right now.
“Because I’m not going to be relying on him to
So, at the very least, he wasn’t going to waste the time. He was going to double check his hunches, look for more details, plan for as many outcomes as possible.
He looked terrible. Almost pale enough to blend into his surroundings, save for the dark circles that Steve could see under his eyes, even from here. His hair hung limp and greasy around his face, and if it weren’t for the eerily metronomic tapping of his foot on the floor, Steve would’ve worried he was actually dead… And then his eyes caught a movement on the walkway just below Andrews cell.
have to mention them-
Steve lifted Tony into his chest, so that he could turn and lie him out on the couch behind him. Tony grabbed at him instantly, pulling Steve on top of him by the front of his shirt. And then, as soon as Steve kissed him again, Tony ran his hands up along his back, under his clothes, stroking the flats of his palms over Steve’s bare skin. Steve shivered, and immediately moved to shrug his t-shirt up over his shoulders, wanting to feel more of Tony pressed against him, not wanting anything in the way. Tony caught on quickly, snatching at the shirt and tugging it over Steve’s head. And then Tony’s hands were all over him, caressing desperately over Steve’s arms and shoulders and chest, his eyes wide and dark and his lips just slightly swollen…
“We know.” Steve sighed, sadly. “We’re from there, remember?”
sorry. Like you said that night you were drunk – you
Steve’s heart seized. And then a dreadful thought took form in his mind.
Now, Tony was being quickly flooded with the adrenaline of this, the pure, basic
Oh, there was just so much. Tony suddenly realised just how much he had to say to Steve – how much of it he still had to work out.
“Done really well,” Tony cut in to remind him, and Steve giggled.

obstacles, to even the most mundane or beneficial of projects,” and he even looked quite apologetic when he added, “I know everyone here would have preferred not to have to do things this way. We believe in our work, and if we could’ve gotten the information we needed any other way, we would have. But the fact that we’ve had to resort to… these extremes, doesn’t mean that our goals are sinister.”
“I don’t know, it’s only going to be half the story… I just, suddenly there are a lot of unknowns that probably

But it was more than that.
And Steve felt a hot rush along his spine
So, firstly, I am very sorry that this update comes two whole days later than promised - it ended up taking far longer than I was expecting to catch up on everything. However, I HAVE caught up, at long last - so the next update is still due on the 18th. Many thanks for your patience, and apologies again.
And whatever that meant, it couldn’t mean abandoning Bucky, or using Bucky, or always putting Bucky second.

“What? No,” Steve snapped back, motivated by a more present pang of temper that time.
But what they found immediately drew them closer. A basic instinct, like rubber necking at an accident. The wall at the back of the room was actually made up of hundreds of cells, which extended all four floors down or maybe even further, like this whole wing had been built onto the outside of The Facility. The drop below the railing overlooked a network of walkways, connecting the floors of cells to various landings, where computer screens and lab equipment were set up. Most of the cells looked to be empty… But, when Steve scanned from top to bottom, he caught the shape of a few people either lying on the mattresses within, or sitting on the floor, unmoving, their eyes fixed on the middle distance –
And now he thought of all those times they’d talked, back at The Tower. The times when Tony had felt brave enough to ask how Steve was feeling, and Steve had opened up a little, and Tony had felt so fucking optimistic…
The friction of denim on the inside of his thighs – the thrill of thinking that Steve hadn’t even finished getting undressed.
They all huffed together and set off towards the tower without another word.
over the constant onslaught of horrible thoughts, much less strategize.
“How?” Rhodey frowned, sceptically.
But now that the emblem of all Tony’s disappointment and bitterness had actually turned up, a real person with actual feelings and an unnervingly earnest smile… To say that he
“I’m glad you didn’t kill him,” Tony began, attempting a light tone of voice. Steve blinked in confusion, and Tony rushed to explain, “Bucky seemed to think you were going to murder him, the last time he was here...”
...She’d tell him he should go to bed.
“Yeah, I’ve missed you too,” he sighed. Tony glanced up at him, his expression soft and affectionate, a playful smile tugging at his lips.
And Steve stilled under his palm, just like Tony knew he would.
“Meaning?” Tony asked, just slightly irritably. Steve looked up, and blinked, liked he was surprised to realise he’d said that out loud… He frowned, and gave his head a dismissive little shake.
are you saying this? What purpose does it serve? And, yeah, if I thought the point I had to make was important, or I had to stand my ground, then I could say it – especially if it was a
…That blindsided Steve, somewhat.
...The prospect of walking for a mile in this weather - in these outfits - was not an appealing one. Just visualising it was enough to gather the sweat along Tony’s back.
The relief was so overwhelming that his grip slipped. And then Bucky jerked forward, and Steve snapped back into battle mode, pulling Bucky tighter against him.
As Tony considered the wisdom in that, a waiter appeared on the other side of the table, water jug in hand. Their eyes met, and then the waiter nodded politely towards Tony’s glass - and Tony was briefly amused to think that those gestures were so universal as to be recognised in an alien realm… By a waiter wearing a glittery waistcoat and… speedos...
Steve came so hard and so suddenly that it was actually painful, a blistering, visceral sensation that ripped right through the middle of him. He could hear himself screaming – and it was purely luck that it wasn’t Tony’s name.
Until eventually it eased into a dizzy, shimmering euphoria…

Steve felt the stirring of a different sort of discomfort, low down in his stomach. Already, he didn’t like where this was going…
Bruce was sitting in the middle of the table, staring happily into space, looking more sober than the rest of them - but Steve knew better. He’d already attempted to engage Bruce in a serious conversation, to ask him if his experience on Saakar could tell them anything about what was going on… Twenty minutes into an incredibly technical description of ‘the Devil's Anus’, Steve had been forced to accept that Bruce was as stoned as everyone else…
Also, Steve couldn’t –

And it had been such a regular, run of the mill dilemma – wanting to be thoughtful, and prepared, versus not wanting to come over as needy or a total hick. He’d decided against it, actually. At the last minute, he’d decided it was over the top.
He looked down again, more panicked now, almost expecting to have shrunk in the last few seconds. Surprised that he could still take a deep breath – like he couldn’t imagine this specific body without the asthma.
And he didn’t even look to see if Steve was following him.
...Bucky and Steve never argued
“I’m sorry, I don’t know why I said that,” he breathed, as Tony finally came to sit beside him on the bed, “I think I… was dreaming, or something, I don’t know… I’m not really awake…”

The way he parted his lips
Tony inched his way down the centre of Steve’s body, trailing slow, soft, kisses down towards his stomach. The pleading note in Steve’s breathing pulled into a high-pitched whine - and then snapped, setting free a wave of babbled desperation,

of that was shit. Usually, those thoughts ground through his head, heavy and weary and somehow still impossible to quiet. Hours lost in thoughts about how to limit the damage, how to make the most of the ruins, how to move past the pain.

Steve snapped to attention again as one of Rousseau’s finished talking. Kicking himself, he turned back to Tony - who was now frowning, thoughtfully.
And the only reason that wasn’t unbearable was that Tony was simply too blissed out to be beaten by anything, by then.
plan; for the fact that he might, hypothetically, have made better use of this afternoon, if he hadn’t been so caught up in this pointlessness…
The night they bumped into each other when Tony was on his way back in from a benefit… His hair all soft and messy, that careless smile on his face… He’d called Steve sweetheart that night. Ironically, of course - but not spitefully. Steve could still remember the exact tone of voice…

An apology that could’ve started with almost the exact same wording, actually… But he got the impression that Tony was trying to work something out here, that he was in the middle of finding the words for something. So, for a moment, he sat quietly and let him continue.
Tony had never really recognised that permanent grinding ache in his shoulders, until it went away…

Those reactions were practised, and innate… and meaningless now.
The wordless reverence that Steve had always commanded in Tony’s house, along with the terrible awareness that it must never be said out loud…
He needn’t have done it at all.

And that little kick of exhilaration at the bottom of his gut.

It was also the first chance he’d had to wonder what the hell had happened to the others today. He’d been in such a rush to get to the finals before Bruce performed - and then so overwhelmed by the shock, amusement and bewildered pride of watching Bruce perform - that everything else had been pushed down the agenda. Of course, now that Bruce’s turn was over, and Tony and Rhodey had finished exchanging ‘

sorry for that, Steve. So sorry. And I’m sorry I didn’t say it earlier. I’m sorry I didn’t call and say it, I’m sorry I didn’t say it at any point in the last six months – I’m sorry I thought I didn’t have to say that, just cos I was mad at you, when they were always different things. I’m sorry for…
And then he felt Steve’s fingertip, now wet with lube, press firm against his hole and push inside him - and everything sharpened again.
He walked over to the couch and deliberately resumed his earlier position, even going as far as to pick his drink up and rest it in the same place on his knee. He let his head fall back and waited for something to hit him, for one single thought or emotion to be the first to shout out of the overwhelmed, overtired numbness singing in his head…
“Hm?” Steve questioned, bringing his lips closer to Tony’s ear.
But then there was Steve. Soft and strong and safe, and right there, where Tony could so easily have reached out to him…
This time, at least, the elephant in the room hadn’t pushed them into doing something stupid…
And he looked at Tony, those big Bambi eyes so full of feeling, his lips
“Well, that’s fine, because I love being handed things,” Pepper sighed, plucking the card from Coulson's fingers-
And that meant whatever slim chance there was of Steve sympathising with him, or trying to help him, had just gone up in smoke.
All of their previous interactions were built on something that had never been real, motivated by all the impulses that Tony had vowed to give up. Tony had spent years trying to get Steve to notice him, trying to get Steve to like him, trying to be the one to make Steve happy… If he’d accepted that all those things were bad for both of them… What exactly did he do instead?
This was more basic than that. More

“Well, today, yes. And, honestly, most likely every day for another week. I’m following the instructions of the top experts in this stuff, and according to them, this is the best way to begin treatment… Which is the best way to make sure you recover quickest,” Tony explains, speaking slowly and carefully, his eyes softened with concern. “...But, if you really hate the idea, I can do a bit of reading up tonight, and speak to Steve, and we can talk about it again tomorrow, when everyone’s here…”
It wasn’t going away

about getting dressed.
So, in a fleeting moment of very poor judgement, Tony just stepped forward and threw the door open anyway.
“Oh fuck Tony you feel so good,” Steve growled, his restraint breaking down right before Tony’s eyes. Tony felt Steve’s hips stutter against him, so obviously trying to go slow, his brow creased in concentration, biting his bottom lip.
Steve threw a begrudging little wince in the direction of the Operation Rebirth files, feeling like a kid who’d come home from the fair and remembered that he still had homework to do…

When he looked up again, Tony had that same smile on his face, that moment of identity with another person… that was encouraging, at least.
That question that had been going around his head for the last few minutes.

Steve froze in the middle of the corridor, suddenly oblivious to the people still filing past him, and the details of their surroundings, and the context he’d so carefully tried to gather. He no longer knew where he was, or where they were going... only that Tony was talking to him in
It didn’t matter. He liked it.
“Me overreacting and being an idiot, probably,” he conceded, finally slowing his step. He glanced up at a worn, wooden bench a few feet away from them, and Steve decided to take the initiative on that one. He held Tony’s hand and led him to take a seat, trying not to sound too pushy when he asked again,
Hey all - I'm still unsure if this is the correct fandom etiquette (and do feel free to let me know, if that's the case) But I'm told that subscribers to this fic wouldn't necessarily get a notification if it became a series, and another fic was added...

Pure.
That realisation crawled over Steve’s skin like a film of dirt.
“So, we turn them over to the authorities here, if there are any…” Tony spoke like he was thinking aloud…
Some primal part of him recognised that he was on a bed, that Tony was climbing onto it with him, that this warranted a flush of heat over his skin and an immediate hardening of every muscle.
Well…
Steve made it over to the desk in two large strides, the Facehugger already poised between his thumb and forefinger. He glanced at it, and thought back to what Tony had said about how it worked…

“Like the woman you saw before?” Tony whispered. And Steve nodded.
“I love you Tony, I’ve always loved you, I’ve always wanted you,” Steve promised, accenting every statement with another kiss, his touches still eager and possessive. When Tony wriggled back against him there was a new kind of thrill, an unlimited delight in what was rather than an excited desperation for what could be. His body was still loose and soft and sensitive, completely open to the sensations that simply ran through him now. Revelling in the way Steve’s perfect muscles tensed under his hands, and the sound of his urgent panting, and the feeling of his cock pressed hard against Tony’s thigh, all without any urgency towards anything. Teasingly, he ran a fingertip over the curve of Steve’s waist, playfully tugging at the waistband of his underwear. A little rivet of exhilaration squirmed in Tony’s stomach when Steve’s breath hitched… He

Steve knew the second he opened the door-
“The central system used to be controlled from the top floor, and there’s no reason they’d have changed that,” Tony carried on talking to Natasha. “But they’re almost certainly holding Steve and Bucky in the basement, so, I’m going down to get them before I go up to let you in,” and Tony’s tone made clear that he wouldn’t be taking criticism on his plan.
Which wasn’t now. That little pang of shame was quickly overwhelmed by all of his previous anxieties, which were now moving even faster and louder and more frantically, after that brief reprieve-
Maybe because Tony annoyed the hell out of him.

Tony felt a genuine sadness well up in him, when he finally had to let go to open their door. A sweet sort of sadness, but still… he had a feeling that it was just going to keep on cooling into regular sadness, from here. But he managed a smile as he stood aside to let Steve through, and he vowed to wait until Steve was asleep before he did anything silly, like think about any of this. Or cry.

Instead, Steve sprinted through the Tower as quickly as he ever had on the battlefield, wilfully oblivious to the strange looks he was getting. He was in and out of his own room so fast that the door didn’t have time to close behind him - a pitstop he only bothered with because it was something that Tony had asked for. And then, at long last, he was on his way down to the workshop.
And Bucky pinched back a little smile, and shook his head,
And then he felt Tony press a tender kiss to the soft flesh just above his hipbone-

And I’m proud of it, and the experience we offer here… but it’s not quite the same, as being a Varian, on this planet. The peace they have is about much more than a freedom from material concern. They are free from shame.

We’ll find the right mix of components, we’ll perfect the education that will have to go along with it… We’re maybe two years away from Genesis Day – less, if we continue to appeal to such interesting research subjects as yourselves….”

Tony whimpered, rocking up to meet this new rhythm, one hand grabbing frantically at the sheets and the other clawing at the back of Steve’s head. He gasped for air, a pleading note in every breath, waves of pleasure crashing over the top of one another, pushing harder and harder against that limit. That frustration burned brighter with every sweep of Steve’s tongue, until eventually it consumed him, his every thought and feeling and impulse focused on this desperate pursuit for release-
himself… By then, the three of them had fallen into a comfortable sort of quiet – which Tony barely noticed. His work for today was delicate, and fiddly; tiny little amendments done with very fine movements and needle tipped tools. Tony was so focused on that one connection in Bucky’s arm, thinking so deep into the theory behind it, that he’d forgotten there were other people in the room-
“Sir, the telephone. I’m afraid my protocols are being overwritten.”
It might fill in

Instead of which, he found himself noting the way casual Tony had slipped that into the conversation…
Steve immediately hated him.

…Oh, that was going to be the sticking point, Tony just knew it.
“Right. Well. The radios work, if anything happens.” Tony went on, eventually, already edging his way toward the door “I’ll see you later”
He wanted to feel Tony’s body pressed against him.
“Yeah,” he answered on autopilot, before he finally gave into the temptation to look up.
Steve almost laughed. As though there was any sort of scale, at this point.
It was the best he could do, under the circumstances.
And, even without the question of anyone’s literal capacity, there was so much else to complicate this… Tony couldn’t be sure whether he was
So, instead, he had selected one of the more mundane ideas that had occurred to him, deliberately choosing somewhere that
“Zan?” Steve asked, his eyes dropping to the parcel. This was a larger, uglier envelope than the one that had been delivered last night – grey, and cheap, and bulging in the middle with something other than paper.
And then he heard the soft whir of Bucky flexing his metal arm.
And Steve was
But he didn’t.
Steve had to take a sharp breath, his whole body suddenly feeling so much lighter.
But he didn’t have time for any of that.
he was.
A wave of pleasure rolled through Steve’s body, hot and deep and needy. All the tension seemed to rush to his groin, his shoulders falling limp against the sun lounger as his hips braced up against Tony’s lips. He gasped, as Tony flicked the tip of his tongue over his slit, one hand grabbing mindlessly at Tony’s hair. Tony sucked against the head of Steve’s cock, before taking the length of him
And it turned out that two decades worth of self-loathing and self-preservation,
“So why-”
And then he tilted his head up and pressed a long, slow kiss to Steve’s lips, confident and possessive… but still soft. He stroked his hands up along Steve’s ribs, and over his back, caressing his palms into Steve’s muscles as he pulled himself into his chest.
Steve brought Tony close to his chest again as he made the call, his hand stroking affectionately though Tony’s hair as he relayed a brief synopsis to Natasha.

“So, who’s my SHIELD allocated love interest going to be?” Tony challenged with mock joviality, his eyes firmly locked on Nick. Steve cast a furtive glance in Natasha’s direction, an unclean feeling already gathering on his skin.
“Get rid of that.” Tony commented suddenly, and Steve had to look to realise that he’d pulled the sedative cloth out while he was searching.
“...Steve called me that,” he realises.
And then Steve got as far as remembering,

“But I can’t find any reference to her by name, so I suspect we won’t be able to answer that, from the files we have.” Tony sighed, waving the file reader again.
With them came the same flood of guilt and helpless anger.
He strode purposefully to the front door, his temper gathering in his shoulders again the moment he stopped trying to fight it. The memories creeping back to him, like snide whispers in his head,
And then Steve broke the kiss with a gasp. He ran his hands up along Tony’s back, rough and possessive, before he moved to cup Tony’s face between his palms. He looked at Tony with such intensity that it almost hurt to look back at him.
“But that means we could just go and get him, right now.”
drugs being delivered down there, and from the notes it looks like they
There had been a nagging temptation to look for Tony on his trip to Camp Lehigh, which Steve had just flat-out refused to think about. He suspected that there would be a similar stirring when it came time to replace the Soul Stone, and when he went back to 2012.
And he wanted Tony to feel wanted. He wanted Tony to feel loved, and needed, and beautiful. Steve wanted to take all that pain and doubt away from him, just for a minute. He wanted to be the thing that made Tony feel good.
” Tony barked, digging his fingers into Steve’s shoulder, burying his hips into him, his voice breaking down into an animal roar as he came.
If they’d uncovered these answers together…
So, the only way Steve could play this now was to do exactly that, and hope to God that it was the ‘right’ answer.
And he didn’t bother concealing any of this – from

but smile, even as he was trying to tell himself that this was really very bad…
But he forced himself to do a quick scan of the room – which was, as Zan had promised, very dark. It took his eyes a few seconds to adjust, enough to make out a large, rectangular room, with a grand marble bar running all the way around it. The staff behind it were all distorted into shadows by the very faint light that seemed to come from the floor beneath them. The rest of the room was dotted with various over-sized couches and semi-concealed booths, each with little side tables, on which a tiny lamp glowed very softly… and, in most cases, stacks of glasses stood next to a collection of sex toys, or tubes of lube…
“You know, when I first woke up in the 21
And then he cried.
A strange, cold feeling started rising up in Steve as he thought of Tony… Entirely unharmed, immediately recovered enough to resume his medical duties…
Which was probably also a bad thought, but it seemed easier to let that one drift through his head than to stop and examine it-
And, surely, if Tony could find a way to explain that to Steve, if he could figure out what this was
He simply stood there and let it tremble through him, feeling like this delighted, hiccupping rhythm would just never end.

remembered what he was talking about – what the ‘big project’ was. What the anxiety was. The thing he’d forgotten, the mistake he’d made, the thing he’d been fretting over when he finally crashed out last night. Maybe even the thing he’d been dreaming about. He still didn’t remember anything about it, but now that he thought of it… it just

It didn’t last though. Already there was a nagging voice,
effort to temper his hopes; to at least leave himself some room for denial, if he got anything other than the response he was hoping for…
“You…you, uh, just asked me a question, didn’t you?” He muttered, weakly.
And, when Steve finally broke, Tony could feel the release of it - a lofty, heady sort of euphoria that swamped him as Steve came inside him.
Well, he

And Tony had done so much of this for him, and helped him see so much of this for himself. The things he’d said and the way he’d made Steve feel and… all because Steve had let him… all because Steve had finally
Then Bucky grabbed Steve by the shoulder, pulling him up onto his knees, holding Steve’s back against his chest and pushing even deeper into him. A sharp, startled cry fell over Steve’s lips, his hands clawing fruitlessly for something to grab hold of.
He was still overwhelmed by the idea of having someone to wake up next to-
he couldn’t help but notice that he’d quite liked Tony’s reaction.
“I just… I don’t know, I think it got it into my head that he was a threat,” Steve shrugged. “I don’t know what I thought he was going to do… And… I was just so angry at him…”
paying attention to Steve… sitting there with his shirt hanging open and his hair all ruffled and that adorable little pout making his lips look even fuller-
So, he simply did what he’d been trained
And, God, if Steve had just taken every hope and happiness in his life and destroyed it in a single night-
“Yeah, send him up,” Tony cut in, turning his attention back to the door.
That made a huge difference, too.

Steve flinched when he realised what Tony was doing.
Because Tony
A little smile tingled on Steve’s lips.
He’d forgotten all about things like ‘breathing.’
“And if I ask you not to move your arms, you won’t,” he said, simply, waiting until he saw Steve’s eager little nod of agreement before he released his wrists.
He’d have to file that away for consideration later, though. Right now he had to focus on Tony, and what had happened – that was the bit he’d wish he’d thought about, once Tony woke up…
Tony laughed, softly.
“It’s okay, I know, I know…” Tony soothed…
now,” Steve announced, grabbing hold of Nat’s hand as he added, “nice to see you, bye.”
He found a guard cowering in the darkness, right in the middle of being shocked to her core by the sound Tony had just made. He saw the semi-professional marksman stance dissolve completely, as she registered that Tony was something
And that meant
“Okay, I see what you’re getting at,” Nick sighed - probably about to carry on, but Steve didn’t feel like relinquishing the floor.
“...It’s
? I mean, could it really make everything worse, if you got to enjoy someone’s company for a little while…?”
All those nights on the run… He’d relived that fight in the conference room as many times as he had that fight in the bunker - always trying to change the ending. Never being able to.
…But then he’d think of himself as a sexual abuser, giving that same justification. A teacher taking advantage of a pupil, or a prison warden sleeping with an inmate. Telling himself that he’d done this reckless and harmful thing – something that Steve couldn’t possibly have the capacity or the information to consent to – because Steve
Steve hadn’t paid much attention when Scaramouche came up to them at the bar.
Tony looked down at the dense mass of brightly coloured sequins in his hands, somewhere between disbelief and resignation. When he glanced up at the others, he could see them all thinking the same thing,
“You are just

And, sure enough, it was the familiar charcoal and red of the hotel uniform that Tony saw first-
If, maybe, this was just a simple case of him falling in love with someone that was out of his league.

that Steve must stand by his every action, that his every deed would perfectly reflect his views and his character and his feelings for Tony…
But, before Tony could consider it any further, his phone beeped.
Out of nowhere, he found himself wondering how that Steve’s life might be changed when he discovered that SHIELD had ‘lost’ his Captain America suit.
to be watching the news. He even knew that it was good for him in the long run, that he felt better for having some first-hand experience and opinions on the last seventy years, that it did help him to feel a part of the world…

Tony didn’t

And, God, Tony hated that it mattered.
And then Tony broke the kiss to bury his head in Steve’s neck, his breath hot against Steve’s skin as he whispered,
…Forcing himself to think carefully, Steve decided that maybe it would be better to loosen these ropes rather than break himself free of them. That, if they were being watched, it might be better not to draw attention or attract retaliation before he got his bearings-
So why did Tony suddenly have a bad taste in his mouth?
Steve sat up too sharply – he knew he had. He could feel the blank shock that his expression had fallen into. He was sure that Nat, at least, had noticed.
“Uh, well - he’s a great roommate, actually,” Steve remembered aloud. “Laid back and practically minded - never panicked when the pipes burst, always had an idea for how to fix it…”
He’d told Tony that he was in love with him, and that had

“But, to be honest, it was a pretty toxic chain of events that lead us there. How would be remember that, exactly? What would we think we were doing there, if we never remembered having that fight?” Tony carried on covering – while Steve did a detailed scan of the environment, and then locked his eyes on Adam, on the phone in his hand, committing every detail to memory-
And nodded.

My apologies that this update comes a little late in the day - the short explanation would be that rural broadband in the UK sucks. However, you do have a slightly longer update to compensate!
“You know…” he began, cautiously, not wanting to break the mood… But feeling like he should probably say it, “if you ever want to know anything about when I knew your dad, or anything… I’d be happy talking to you about anything…”
“I don’t really want to talk about this,” Steve winced. “I just can’t

Steve was right. There was no way they could do a worse job than these guys.
“I love you,” Tony told him, stroking a hand over the side of Steve’s face, urging Steve to look at him before he carried on. “This is all because I love you, because there is so much about you to love. That’s where all this comes from, it’s the basis of all of this, it’s all that matters – you know that?”

In fact, after a few stilted comments about the weather, things actually began to move quite fluidly. Tony heard himself telling Bucky where to sit and Steve where to stand, without panicking over every individual word. He wasn’t thinking a thousand different things, when he was gathering his tools and arranging his workspace. This part of things felt natural to him… and somehow, having other people here didn’t make it all completely different. Not this time.
And now he recognised that he didn’t want to. He knew he couldn’t tell Bucky that he
But… Oh, this was just something altogether
A physical wave of cold, vital power rushed over him as she scrambled off to look for help. His skin tingled in the aftermath of it, his heart thrumming against his ribs with a giddy sort of elation.

“Hey!” Tony called, from a few feet behind him… in a tone that immediately softened Steve’s legs.
Steve looked back at Tony again… Tony, looking up at him with expectation and… hm, Steve was clearly meant to say something now…

And, now that Tony really thought about it… He couldn’t exactly lock Steve in the bedroom, as soon as they got back to the suite. He would be in the same awkwardly-stuck-with-drunk-Steve situation in either place… actually, now that he was visualising the suite… that might even be worse.
“You put that idea in his head…” Steve murmured, stunned, not even talking to her.
Subtly flexing his hand, now hanging nervously at his side.
Steve set his glass down to the side of him carelessly, paying no attention to whether it toppled over – while Tony just let his fall to the ground, quite possibly cracking it. There was a sudden rush of excited pride, as Steve recognised how worked up Tony was getting. Even after all these months he was still overwhelmed by the discovery that Tony loved him, that he

about what tests he’d have to run – he was just thinking that he’d like to step out of this ever increasing clusterfuck, please. And then he realised that they were both still looking at him, expectantly.
“No, Tony-”
And Tony grinned.
Steve was - what this love was, what was the right thing to do about it. He still wasn’t sure whether it was selfish, or reckless, or wrong for some reason beyond his understanding… but he had at least worked out that he never could be. And Tony had come to think that ignoring his feelings for Steve would be as risky and heartless as following through with them-
“Oh, hello… this is an AI.” He looked up at Steve “A
And the second, eerie shock of sinking through it.
There was an angry shout, a spiteful collection of sounds that Steve couldn’t comprehend as words. And then, over the top of it, the very soft whisper in Tony’s voice.
...And he’d always known he couldn’t. He couldn’t remember why, now. But he’d always been so sure.
“Sit down,” Tony instructed, glancing at the bed. Steve felt strangely clumsy as he rushed to comply, all awkward excitement next to Tony’s smooth command of the situation… But he didn’t mind. He might even have liked the novelty of it, the feeling of being in a role he was never usually allowed to play…
“Tony, what’s going on?”
He liked the way Tony’s eyes widened at the sound of it.

and he wasn’t even kissing him-
A few hours later, and Steve and Tony were both still sitting awkwardly at either end of Tony’s enormous couch. Steve had his hands clasped firmly in his lap in a desperate attempt to keep them still, while Tony had his arms wrapped around his knees, his eyes slightly lowered, as though he was fighting the urge to curl up into a ball.
Steve broke into a grin. He was responding to everything on a very basic level, and he knew immediately that he liked that reaction very much-
Tony had just sat through four hours of the most pointless, tedious,
The almost hallucinations of earlier had worn off, and he’d somewhat settled back into the world around him - but the effects of the flowers still lingered, making everything seem floaty and distant and unreal…
“Oh, God, I want to touch you, please can I - please, I want-” Tony babbled, as that frustration sharpened to a breaking point…
“I like you like this,” Tony mused, tracing a fingertip along Steve’s throat. “I like the idea of you spread out on clean, soft sheets…comfortable… rested…” He watched the shivers run along Steve’s skin as he spoke, the way those impossible eyelashes fluttered…

Tony let his head fall back against the couch, his hips jerking involuntarily, his mind whiting out completely. A low, aching pleasure tightened deep inside him. A sharp heat pulsed in the tip of his cock as Steve drew back, slowly, the flat of his tongue pressed to Tony’s skin.
But that didn’t stop him
It was all he could do to keep from snapping and saying it outloud.

The smell of coffee wafted under his nose, jarring his train of thought. Tony did his best to shake himself to his senses, as he searched through the cabinet for his favourite mug, telling himself,
“Do you require some assistance, sir?” JARVIS enquired, coolly.
“We need to ask you some questions, and I know it’s not going to make any sense why we’re asking, but this is going to be quicker if you just answer – and we really need to be quick here, okay?” He explained.

In the end, he looks up at the man and simply asks,
And she’d gotten it so exactly right.
“Why, is there a crime in progress on social media?” Tony mocked, raising an eyebrow.
The times he could swear he’d seen Steve glance down at his wrist, or run his other hand over it, and wanted so much to ask him or reassure him or cover… but, obviously, that would’ve been suspicious.
Which was just so good-
? Just because you want to explain, because you want people to know how you saw it, or what really happened, or whatever…” He asked, and Tony nodded,
Steve smiled and squeezed Tony tighter, a different sort of relief melting through him.
But he definitely liked something about this.

that taste. That wonderful, unique taste, somehow even stronger as a trace on Steve’s skin than it had been when Tony was drinking it by the mouthful.
He was so overwhelmed that he forgot all about the poor hotel employee, still standing in polite silence, eyes lowered, awaiting some sort of instruction. Tony was too focused on the idea that, maybe, somehow, while on the run and off the grid, Steve had managed to send him flowers for his birthday…
Tony turned to Sam first to give a little nod of acknowledgement,

Also, just to be on the safe side, there are more details in the end notes - the only dub-con element of this whole thing is the fact that they're on drugs, but there is that, and there are some sub-dom themes explored.

Well. He wasn’t sure Steve would agree with that statement. At one point they’d walked past an ‘erotic theatre performance’ in which a woman was being (quite happily) fisted – and Steve had

That shadowy anxiety of this unknown
“Hey you,” Tony smiled, from somewhere to the left of him. Steve tensed his arms, thinking he would try to roll over and look at him – and quickly recognised how ridiculous that was.
Steve knew he wouldn’t be able to make his legs work fast enough, he could feel it – it would take him longer to take a single step than it would for Adam to wipe his eyes, and type that code, and take

to start. Immediately, his head was full of bright, high-definition memories.
“When’s the debrief?” He sighed, turning back to his punching bag.
Tony left a guilty little pleasure, knowing that, for once, he could just hand that off – at least for the next twenty-four hours or so.

wanted to tell Steve, and he wanted to tell him so very much, that he already had his phone in his hand.
Tony paused.
Steve’s cock throbbed as he dropped his arms, an audible gasp falling over his lips-
“He’s fine – he does that, just, goes off sometimes…” Tony muttered, pointedly turning towards the screen again. “It’s fine, I’ll catch him up. Carry on.”
And Tony soon worked out that, wherever this diary had been since 1992, it could stay there one more night-
“...And I kind of have the thought that, if I
“Yeah…” Steve nodded, edging nearer. “...And I think you’ve got a rash on your neck,” he squinted.

…He’d thought Tony was upset in
three seconds, before a man in a white suit appeared from the opposite corridor, smiling directly at Steve.
Tony shuddered under the power of that thought - and everything that came pouring out with it.
“Really, no one said that?” Steve frowned, so genuinely confused… Tony felt his heart swell.
And now it all seemed so obvious-
“It’s just… neither of us can know if I’m hurting you,” Tony sighed. “I can’t tell you what I’m doing to you – I don’t even know. I don’t know if this is going to… change you, or… You can’t know what you’re risking, and I can’t know what I’m asking you to risk…”
So, for the time being, he was being very careful not to think about that at all. Not to even look.
, let’s see what your deepest fear is, shall we?”
It was something that Steve couldn’t bear to accept, and couldn’t bear to decline…
“We got stuck in some political… project meeting…thing,” he explained, too irritated with it to think of the right words. “Some partnership the government is building with a communications company, or something – I don’t even know how they want us to be involved. They just came by to ‘introduce themselves’ and wouldn’t shut up.”
telling us the truth…” He trailed off into a shrug.
And Tony could see a thoughtful… growing more emotional… expression on Steve face – and Dear Lord he hoped that was good amazed and not what-the-fuck amazed…
“Son of a bitch,” Tony muttered, scrambling after him - catching up just as Bucky got a hand to the door.
When he didn’t even work for them - had directly declined the offer to work with them, in fact - when he’d never asked for their help.
“Because I’m scared of both of them,” Bucky answered candidly. Tony’s disbelieving grimace melted into a thoughtful frown.
And now, in an instant, he had no idea why. He had no idea what he was in the middle of saying, what was supposed to come next – what the fuck he was going on about.
“Well, I thought he might be good for you, obviously,” she began. “He seemed to understand the things that made you special, right off the bat. And the way he talked about Bucky, I just thought… that he clearly see’s the humanity in people first. So, yeah, I thought maybe he’d be good for you. But I’ve thought that about a few people, in the last ten years. I’ve met lots of people and thought they might be able to help you… But that’s no good, is it, if there’s nothing you can offer them.”
“Oh…” he exhaled softly, hiding his face against Tony’s shoulder. He felt Tony’s hand card roughly though his hair, his breathing still shallow when he asked,
to work off this excess adrenaline - that the real question was where it was all coming from.
I mean – do The Accords have anything about this? I don’t remember anything that would even remotely relate to this –
Which was generally how he behaved when he was twelve, but that was beside the point.
Which brought Steve back into the moment pretty dramatically.
“I honestly don’t know if that makes me feel better or worse” Steve exhaled. Then he looked at Tony’s screen. “What did you get.”
Tony dropped his head into his hands – fuck it, why not? Why bother pretending this was anything less than agonisingly,
Because, hey, they had to give this fictional warlord
“Colonel Rhodes is at the door, sir,” JARVIS clarified, patiently.
“It’s okay, you’re a terrible liar anyway,” Tony joked effortlessly, and Steve had to really concentrate to keep from choking on his food when he laughed.
“You get everything you came for?” Clint enquired, with a slight edge on his voice now.
Now Steve found himself looking back over the last year of his life and wondering what exactly he’d been so afraid of. That wordless anxiety about certain topics, that instinct to flinch away from certain questions… Always

There was some distant recollection of his usual responses, even if he hadn’t quite slipped into them yet…
“Oh, Jesus Christ, we
” Steve begged, bucking against him, a sharp edge of urgency on his voice.
, now that he thought about it… and every time, in the middle of a catastrophe. Every. Single. Time.
…And it definitely wasn’t fear.
Steve fell apart, broken into fragments by the strength of that feeling, trusting Tony to take his weight. Tony didn’t flinch. He just held Steve close, his teeth held firm in his flesh…
“Hey,” Steve said, letting his eyes fall shut again. “You going somewhere?”
Steve smiled at him, still blushing. It was pretty. Tony made the impulsive decision that ‘the moment’ didn’t actually have to end until they got back to their suite and reached down to take Steve’s hand –
There was an ear-splitting crash as Bucky tore free of his restraints with enough force to break the chair to pieces around him. Steve heard the wet crack of Bucky hitting Stape, and then the dull thud of Stape hitting the floor like a sandbag.
And when Tony looked at her…
, like he’d been liberated by the restraints. And Tony kissed him back just as hungrily, one hand curled under his head, the other still caressing Steve’s arm… down over his ribs… over the curve of his hips… Steve bucked up against him sharply, and a sudden, searing pleasure shot through Tony’s groin and up along his back, forcing him to break away to gasp for air. And Steve let his head fall back, baring his neck for Tony-
Whether he really ‘should’ feel more clear-headed than this, standing in ninety-degree heat on an alien planet after about three hours sleep… whilst wearing a chandelier. If that subtle dizziness only felt significant because he was thinking about it… If the heat and the sleep deprivation and general irritation with his situation
Of course, they both took the friendly hint, and went over to their now-familiar places by Tony’s examination table. And, by the time Tony had picked up his tools, Steve’s mind had drifted back to his now-familiar train of thought.
And then Tony broke away, and Steve found himself looking into those flawless dark eyes…
He exhaled, softly, thinking back to that day in the conference room – listening to Sam and Rhodey casually throw hypotheticals at each other, and thinking of a thousand answers of his own… and keeping his eyes fixed on the document in front of him. That sense of wordless longing that had filled him them, all the imperfect words that didn’t fit the thing he would’ve liked to say…
Tony knew that if he tried to talk to Steve calmly, and kindly, and if he led in with all those reassurances that he wasn’t mad, and Steve had done nothing wrong…
“Okay, deal.”
Whatever happened, however it had to look, Tony was entirely sure that he’d spent the rest of his life making sure that Steve was okay.
That was… exciting.
Tony suspected that her monologue had been crushed under the sheer weight of Steve’s withering look – and he was glad.
He really thought he’d accepted that.
Tony wasn’t able to cover his shock at that. His mouth literally fell open. And then he blinked a few times, and then screwed his face up and shook his head, before shooting Steve an outright accusatory glare and demanding,
Okay, he nodded.
And in those hot, painful moments, when Steve was so overcome with physical need that he couldn’t think straight – and he knew that Bucky wouldn’t ask any questions.

And then, like he was reaching for comfort, he thought of Tony leading him away from the hospital, the reassuring weight of his palm against the small of Steve’s back…

And Nat let go of a subtle little scoff, and raised her eyebrows,
“Remarkably quick for a woman being force fed sedatives, isn’t she?” Steve noted, sardonically. Tony huffed out a little laugh.
And it felt worse not to, somehow…

so much better than that - at least, they were for Steve. The future he looked forward to now was so happy and hopeful and vibrant, it made all versions of the old world look sad and shallow in comparison.

But that issue did seem so much more approachable than all the others. At least Steve had some idea what he was bracing for, with that one. And at least he knew that Bucky would help him out… Steve
“I understand,” Steve smiled. Hoping he didn’t sound as Dr Phil as he thought he did. “Maybe we should talk about this later. When you’ve had some time to think, I mean.” And Tony smiled – the first smile that had seemed genuine since he woke up – and nodded.

So, he dropped his head, and slid Tony’s cock into his mouth.
What started as a thick mental fog had quickly sharpened into a jittery anxiety… Probably triggered by Steve saying the words ‘Truth Serum’ - but certainly enhanced by the drugs. Tony knew anxiety well enough to know the difference. His walk to the hotel had been powered by that sharp-yet-poorly-defined-nervousness that came with too much caffeine, dialled up to eleven. To the point where everything was so overwhelming and in such high definition that he couldn’t take any of it in. At one point, he’d been genuinely concerned about the risk of a heart attack.

And then he felt Tony force one hand down between the two of them, stroking roughly over the outline of Steve’s cock as he scrabbled rather awkwardly for the button at the top of Steve’s jeans. And, for a second, Steve’s head was just swimming from the sudden contact, his whole being focused on getting at more of it, mindlessly writhing up against Tony’s hand-
… with rope…
And he realised…
He still didn’t know whether he really had to walk away from Steve forever.
And he put his hand to the side of Steve’s face, just
The Nat he was actually going to meet was far closer to the person who had betrayed Tony than the person who had taken on the challenge of global security after the snap...
“...In this timeline, yes,” Steve nodded. “In the first timeline, I didn’t find out about any of this until 2014, in DC - you know that Hydra Assassin I said tried to stop me on the helicarrier?”
Steve’s head started throbbing as the battery of camera flashes started up again, Tony standing like a barricade between them, like he was taking the blows. Tony waited patiently for a few seconds, not moving or posing, before he sighed and told the guy,

I’ve spent twenty years in this house… But, honestly, sometimes I think that even if I woke up human tomorrow… I still wouldn’t be able to leave the house without bumping into things, or know what anyone was talking about when I got there.”
The beginnings of various theories about what was really going on-
There were maybe fifteen people in the few feet around the couch, standing in little groups, sipping drinks and chatting amiably – Steve could make out little snippets of their conversation, as Tony rocked against him. There was an urgent instinct to cover himself, to hide that reaction-
And it didn’t even feel strange, in the moment.
, or whatever we were doing before” And Steve laughed gently, and nodded…
His instincts still nagged at him, of course. Instincts couldn’t understand context - they had no way of knowing when you’d gotten the message, and worked out what you had to do. But Tony could understand the context, now that he knew the instinct for what it was. He
Which, of course, is why he never saw it coming.
Steve could barely move, his limbs were so heavy, still so distant from him, but he did his best to help Tony position him. And then Tony moved to kneel between Steve’s legs, stroking a careful hand along the inside of his thigh. Steve let go of another trembling sigh, overwhelmed by the simple effort of keeping his head raised enough to look at Tony.
And Steve could just

Should he lie, and tell Tony whatever it was that would make this decision easier for him?
Tony let go of Jesse’s throat, and let him fall into a heap at his feet.
“…Is that the problem, then?” Bucky asked, more softly.
Tony gasped softly as everything fell into place. He
that particular point, how-
Steve snapped to attention and began scanning the crowd in all directions, trying to work out where Tony might have gone - but it was too late. Finally, in desperation, he looked to find Sam and Bucky, thinking he might at least be able to get a better idea of what the hell had gone on today-
...Not after he’d just spent three days torturing himself over whether he’d inadvertently hurt Tony already.
, which is… awful, anyway. And no matter how mad I…
“Yeah, I’ll sleep on it,” Tony glared back.
By the time he’d finished, Tony’s ears were ringing. Steve was looking back at him in abject shock – but, in complete fairness to him,
most adorable little double take, his initial shock blooming into a deeper, more astounded look of total disbelief…
By this time Jesse was openly sobbing, nodding hysterically, failing to stutter out the word
… this constant cycle of build and release…
And then he glanced back to the flyer still dangling from his fingertips. Checking it was okay, or instinctively looking to Steve’s handwriting as a means to comfort himself, or just needing to look away from Pepper for a moment-
He could feel Steve throwing him a look from across the table, and pointedly did not turn his head. Vanessa was oblivious.
Time stopped. The whole world faded into white, all around him, as his vision focused on the dead weight of Adam, sprawled on the floor. Steve floated on the ocean of adrenaline, his whole body numb until his whole body was shaking, his heart still beating hard against his ribs as he finally thought to wonder what the hell had just happened…
Tony returned with a tray, and six shot glasses.

And then he’d glanced at his own wrist, and it had just

This deep satisfaction.
“Actually, he’s probably the most human person that Bucky has spoken to since we started this whole thing. He’s the only person who bothered to ask what sort of treatment Bucky preferred – he’s the first person to ask Bucky what he thinks about anything at all, really. And he’s the first person who seems to really know what he’s talking about…” And, at last, Steve realised what he was doing – too late to have any chance of covering it up.
An elated voice piped up,
Obviously, he was.

There was a different smile for that.

Steve was gratified when Tony winced at that, glad that he seemed to have the same reaction to it as Steve had.

“Okay…?” Bucky repeated, sounding somewhat dazed.
And Steve would have so much liked to have stayed in that moment - at least for a little while longer.
“Well,

…And, okay.
, somehow-
“Okay,” Nat nodded, “But-”
Immediately, Tony wriggled up onto his knees, crawling closer to Steve – getting himself into position. Steve held his breath, as he stroked his hands over Tony’s ass, spreading him open-
He didn’t dislike Tony Stark. Of course he didn’t. Tony Stark had sacrificed his time, and stepped out of his comfort zone, just to help them. He

“So, what
“Um, well…” He managed. “I, uh… I owe you an apology, for a start-”
And he thought about Steve.
And then Tony placed a firm hand to the centre of Steve’s chest. Steve felt all the air just leave his body, his skin literally burning under Tony’s palm, instinctively leaning into it – but knowing he couldn’t move any more than that. And then he felt Tony push against him, and relented immediately, not so much

A shy smile broke free of him, that blush spreading across his cheeks.

In this chapter Tony tells Steve about the night that Obie turned him into a vampire, which includes discussion of the fact that:

And then Steve took a little gasp of air, like maybe he really had stopped breathing for a time there. Tony saw Steve mouth his name, like he was too dazed to know he’d done it, or too stunned to make himself say it out loud. And Tony was suddenly gripped by a more severe panic than he’d ever felt in his life. A pure, instinctive fear. A physical

“What did you just give them?” Steve asked, coldly.
“Wait - Hydra still have him?” Tony cut in, sitting upright.
Steve was tempted to stay there a moment and just watch him go… It was only the fear of being caught that pushed him, begrudgingly, to turn the corner.
“Nothing! I swear to God, we never - we would never have hurt him-”
So, he said nothing.
He did feel confident that Tony was happy right now, that he’d liked the food and that he liked being with Steve.
Whatever milestones and ceremonies and... changes, were still ahead of them, whatever serious conversations they were yet to have, whatever big decisions they still had to make-
But that was the easy thing to brush off.
At first, Steve was just glad they’d stopped talking - his neck had started to ache with the effort of bouncing between them.
And he looked to Steve to give him some warning if he was on the wrong track entirely with this… But Steve just looked at him, either numb or overwhelmed… and then – the

And, actually, as they ran up the stairs Tony started to think they were going to get away with it. The feeling on his skin didn’t grow as they reached the landing, the way it had the night they’d been invited to the third floor. He didn’t find it hard to concentrate, while he worked on breaking the security code on the next set of doors. There wasn’t a sudden surge of euphoria or panic when they slid open, no strong smell, no physical reaction… Just a normal swell of relief, thinking that maybe the patches did work up here too, that maybe they’d just be able to get in and out after all.

…But it didn’t.
“I’ve missed you,” Tony sighed.
But he didn’t really care.
To begin with, it was just a flood of mental images that Tony couldn’t fight anymore. Flashes from that first awkward meeting. Visions of the next one going just as badly. The memory of those
rational. He didn’t deny that he’d desperately wanted any excuse to see Tony again, and obviously his desire to help him was at least partly emotional… But Steve was sure that he’d spent the last few days thinking about the objective benefits and the logical arguments, exactly as he’d explained them to Tony.
Steve pushed it all aside.
“Last time we talked, you were trying to ‘weasel out of’ ever seeing him again,” Rhodey summarised, in a pointedly neutral tone. “And you weren’t sure you even liked him – but you did think he was hot. And then I went on the Iraq trip, and texted you at least once a week to ask how it was going – and all you ever said was that Bucky’s arm was getting better.”

Steve went to carry on the joke; he almost winced and apologised and pretend-begged him not to. But then he registered the earnest expression that had suddenly appeared on Bucky’s face, and he stilled.
“Look-”
And then Steve kissed his throat again, the edge of his teeth teasing the sensitive spot at the hinge of his jaw.
Steve just smiled into that bruising kiss,

In one clean step he’d gone from deep, comfortable sleep to completely awake, fully aware of the surroundings that he’d been
“Oh, Steve, I love you, I’ve always loved you, I’ve never stopped loving you, I’ve never loved you more than I do right now, it’s okay, it’s all going to be okay, come here-”
The Red Skull’s face flickered with a sadness that Steve
Steve braced his hands against the inside of Tony’s thighs, deliberately digging his thumbs into the crease of Tony’s groin as he pulled his earlobe between his teeth-
“Yes,” Tony gasped, grabbing the back of Steve’s neck, trying to claim his mouth again.
Steve smiled in spite of himself, as Sam’s tirade faded down the corridor. Then he heard the microwave ping cheerfully beside him, and turned to give his meal an unimpressed glare.
“Part of it is that I’ve always really wanted to be

Oh… Maybe he
He remembered that he’d cleared the room with a sonic blast rather than a spray of bullets - because he couldn’t risk hurting Bucky. Tony was sure he would always remember that detail, because he’d been so intensely, sickeningly focused on it at the time. He’d repeated it to himself, over and over, as the jet neared the landing site,
Steve very much liked the way that Tony had started to lounge around the house when they had these meetings.
One Sunday afternoon a few weeks later, and Bucky found himself aimlessly wandering around the house again.

And then of Tony would wonder whether he should just give it up and start from there. Accept what he’d done, and the realities of it, as a foundational part of his theorising…
And this was why he didn’t bother thinking about this stuff anymore.
“And, if you’re saying you can’t help us because you’re worried about what will happen to you… Then, I’m sorry, I really am” And Steve looked her right in the eye then, his tone cold but somehow still compassionate, “But, if we go in without your help, and we get it wrong – if we

“Hey.”

“Please fuck me Tony, please,” Steve sobbed, not sure where the words were even coming from anymore. Tony buried his hand deep inside Steve then, and dragged a finger roughly over that sweet spot – and waited patiently for Steve to cry out, and shudder, and tremble to a helpless stop, before he leant close and whispered,
“Hi,” Tony repeated, a silly, giggly happiness flooding through him. He
“Well, I’m still sorry…” Bucky sighed. And then, before Tony could contradict him, he went on, “That’s not why I’m here, though.”
“Ah, but you can explain it.” Tony found himself assuring, calmly. “They’re putting drugs in the water, we’ve just seen it with our own eyes. I’m not thinking of it as anything more than that.” Was a lie, obviously – but Steve seemed greatly reassured. And that gave Tony a warm, soft feeling he hadn’t had for a very long time…
He’d wrapped Steve in cool, clean towels, then in a warm, soft robe, and then finally in fresh white sheets – a swell of pride and assurance rising up in Tony, every time Steve enjoyed one of those little details.
A little ripple of relief ran through his body, as that initial jolt of awareness settled into a more developed understanding of Steve’s mood.
“Okay…” Tony answered on auto pilot…wondering
Steve held his breath, and tensed his shoulders, and braced for the shot he was sure was coming-
“...It does?”
“Oh, because when I finally found you and Nat last night, you were both wearing like a million flower garlands,” Tony recalled, with a frown.
Steve immediately blacked out, for a fraction of a second. His legs went from under him. The crack of the floor hitting his knees jolted him awake, but it took a few seconds longer for the room to stop spinning, and for his vision to clear-
And laughed.
“Don’t call him an asshole,” Steve sighed-

flustered about it, even if there was no one there to hear him.
Still, this was all very easy for him to say, he supposed - in what were his first sluggish thoughts in a while.
And Tony
And he managed to retain some sort of composure, as he watched them walk to the elevator. He returned Steve’s little nod of acknowledgement, just before the doors closed behind them. And then suddenly Tony found himself standing in the middle of this suffocating silence, feeling out of place in his own workshop. He didn’t know if he couldn’t believe they’d gone, or if he couldn’t believe they’d ever been here - but something about the situation wasn’t quite fitting in his head. He certainly wasn’t ‘fine’.
Like Steve had sort of forgotten that there were two people in this, that all of existence wasn’t just part of this incredible, increasing sensation

Steve flinched.
And then he saw Steve gasp softly, his face softening into such an open, vulnerable hope… It made Tony’s whole body ache. He didn’t know whether he loved or hated that feeling.
Tony’s shoulders bunched, his jaw tingling sharply as a familiar heat ran up his neck…

“Hm?”
And then Tony took a little step closer, and said,

But Tony was staring right through it-
“Just waiting in your living room for you to come home?” Steve replied with faux confusion. “I’m sorry, is that not a perfectly reasonable way to behave? I’m new in this century, you know. Kind of trying to pick it up as I go.”
And then, of course, there were the downsides to that plan. The particular, somewhat queasy risk of going into a situation where they’d
hurt Tony’s feelings a little bit…
There was no way to write this off as something he was imagining. No way to pretend it wasn’t real.
He could still feel that
So, he steadied himself, and proceeded very, very carefully...
“And they don’t know anything about… They just think you woke up today?” Tony clarified, raising an eyebrow.
, to keep pretending that Steve had no personality - to stubbornly pretend there was nothing positive about him…
But, tonight, Steve was filled with such a dreadful, painful hope. Knowing how unlikely this was to work, and how very much he wanted this to work…
“Yes baby, that’s it,” he murmured, his thrusts coming shorter and shallower now. He felt Tony pull into him, his fingernails digging into Steve skin, a growl held somewhere are the bottom of his chest. “That’s it Tony, come for me.”
And Steve felt something very deep inside him just
“All I’m really saying is that the world would be better if it was forced to drop that poisonous glorification of the past. And I didn’t hear any of those ideas from voices in my head. I didn’t hear them from the fairies. It’s perfectly logical that I should think that. Backed up with evidence of man’s behaviour and analysis of the facts. And, based on that, I’ve concluded that the world would be better if people were forced to change. You might not agree with it, until you drink the reasonable water. But how can

Do you not feel complicit, knowing what the Mallemens will do, if you stop me?” And Steve saw him shuffle his weight back onto his feet – getting ready to move, he knew he was- “Who are you to tell the whole world they can’t have this? You know who you are? You’re-”

Their eyes met in the same amused surprise.
“I love you,” Tony replied, dazed and breathless.

was good-
Both Tony and Steve had been careful to give Bucky time to himself - and Bucky was grateful for that. As comfortable as he felt around them, and as glad as he was that they were both here, there was still a lot that he preferred to unpack on his own. Sometimes there was too much noise and conflict in his head for him to think about sharing his thoughts with anyone, times when he needed space to react to it… Times when he wanted stillness and quiet.
… Odd reaction, to that particular memory.

...tried to ignore the terrible, compelling idea that maybe everything he was didn’t make him a total jackass, so much as someone very few people could live with…
If it seemed like Steve was at all hesitant, it was only because his legs were trembling. There wasn’t any resistance left in him…not for Tony. He realised, with an unexpected swell of calm, that he really

Partly, it was just that he loved Tony Stark. Just that. The joy and thrill of being in love, the simple feeling of looking forward to something…
“I like that you’re polite like that,” Rhodey commented, nonchalantly.
“We have a grand banquet planned for every night of the festival, over a hundred different parties and theatrical performances, sporting showcases from the greatest athletes in the galaxies,” Rousseau Number One went on, like he was listing things as they came to him, “all culminating in the Gala Ball on the final night.”

And, how about that – Steve really didn’t like it.
He felt as though he understood them - even if he still couldn’t explain them.
“Yeah,” Steve nodded, “heading back to LA in the morning.”
“What, you’re too good to wear dumpster clothes?” Bucky teased, while he was tying the sheet over his shoulder, like a toga.
He sighed, and began to towel his hair dry with too much aggression.

Tony smiled.
And somehow it didn’t feel personal… In the moment, it just seemed like Tony was more unsure of the circumstances than he was about Steve, per se.
For a second, Steve was lost for words. With nowhere else to put the sudden swell of emotion, he wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist, and let his head fall into the crook of his neck…
He wondered if Tony had seen any of the really early performances-
And the giddy woosh of his centre of gravity being pulled up through his body, pulling the world with it-
It wouldn’t help him, if he just didn’t find anything...
And he had thought, vaguely, that he’d have to make a real effort to avoid the topic, when he next saw her. That he didn’t want her to know about the… latest development, with Steve, so it was probably best to avoid talking about him at all…
“I want to fuck you, please can I fuck you,” Tony babbled, losing interest in his higher functions, already crawling over Steve’s body.
Steve moaned, when minutes of struggling still hadn’t gotten them to within grasping distance of shore.
“And you’re still okay with this one?” Tony clarified, and Bucky nodded.
“...Honestly, I don’t really know,” Steve admitted, wincing as he said it. “But, in real terms - mostly it’s just the stuff you already know about me. Vampires were stronger and faster and they healed more quickly. All that stuff you already know about the serum… it’s just… that’s why. And, you know, I’m more sensitive to sunlight - although that obviously got exaggerated in all the fairy tales. It’s not like I

, really.
It just fell out of his mouth, a tad too enthusiastically, before he could stop himself-
Steve froze again, like a cornered animal. He willed himself to think something, anything, but there was only that static-electric panic in his head.
“So, what, you didn’t think of it? You didn’t think it mattered?” Bucky went on. “What, you just didn’t want him in your little gang?”
He let his head fall into Steve’s lap, a dreamy smile washing over his face as Steve stroked a tender hand over the back of his neck. For a few moments, there was nothing but this perfect, simple happiness, and this complete, unquestioned safely…
Most of Tony’s sexual history was with people who didn’t feel anything for him at all. He’d preferred things that way. He’d always picked the people who weren’t impressed by him, the people who weren’t intimidated by his reputation - the people he wouldn’t disappoint simply by existing, because they’d never expected anything of him in the first place.

he liked it. Whether this was a physical response or an emotional one. What exactly it made him think about, or feel, or… want. Steve would have liked a day or two to work on that. And then maybe he’d have gotten around to wondering how Tony did it, and what it meant-
He was just happy and comfortable here, simply enjoying Tony’s company.

She said the last word with such hurt. Such anger. Tony glanced up at Steve then, and saw the same uncomfortable fear he felt himself. The awkwardness of earlier had completely dissolved in the seriousness of what Zan was saying – but it was hard to be pleased about that, under the circumstances.
Which was in itself enough to snag Steve’s attention. But when he looked more carefully, Steve could see that it was a candid shot; a badly lit 6x4 like the ones he’d found in all of SHIELDs 90s files… he couldn’t make out the details from here.

say no to that face.
“She’s wants to talk to us”
He remembered thinking of a million things that he wanted for Steve... he remembered there being reasons he could never be those things...
A sharp twinge, all the way along his spine, as Steve jerked his hips again, his movement stuttering, his legs tensing against Tony’s thighs.
And then it occurred to him, almost in a panic, that Steve was standing
“Because otherwise I’d be wearing
That he was obviously expecting to be interrupted and judged and second-guessed. That this was all a defence against the accusations that Tony naturally assumed were coming…
That rant had been Tony coming up against a core struggle of his very being. Yet another moment when who he really was overrode
Steve was rougher in pushing Tony’s jacket back over his shoulders, his hand going to the knot of Tony’s tie without breaking the kiss. He pulled Tony’s bottom lip between his teeth as he slid his tie free of his collar, earning him a pleading little moan that he could feel deep in his groin. He carried on kissing Tony as he unbuttoned his shirt, Tony writhing against him the whole time-
And he saw the wry smile that had crept onto Rhodey’s face, the knowing expression in his eyes – Tony knew that Rhodey had an answer to that.

“Hm.” Tony smiled back, and then just drifted on to “So, in, like, 2049, when we’re celebrating our thirtieth anniversary, and someone’s kid asks us how we got together in the first place…” And he sat up again, to look at Steve when he asked, quite seriously “Where do you want to lie and say we were?”

It wasn’t only the bruised ache around his eyes, or the thickness of his headache. It was the way his emotions weighed down on him like a cold blanket, the feeling of being entirely submerged in sadness and anxiety, from the moment he opened his eyes-
If it weren’t for that initial high, Steve never would have found himself experimenting with any of the others…
“No, but, Steve,” Tony interrupted more firmly. Steve stilled, and watched a thought flicker behind Tony’s eyes, before Tony set his shoulders and looked at him.
His next breath came out as a quiet, trembling moan.
“What?” Tony replied automatically, his ears still ringing in panic.

“They’re not being secretive; they’ve just forgotten that those things feel very important when you first get here.” Dev assured. “And we understand that, so, a few things you may be wondering about.” He pointed back up at the screen. “For a start, as you may have gathered, we’re not on earth – I hope you were prepared for at least that much?”
He had to bring this whole arrangement with Steve and Bucky to an end –
But whatever it was, Tony really felt like things were going to be okay-

Jan Nowak was a SHIELD agent who had met and immediately fallen for the girl of his dreams at a family party – when she had already been diagnosed with terminal cancer. And he had dated her, and proposed to her, and married her, and buried her, all within the space of two years.
And it annoyed Tony that Steve was ignoring his feelings, and, suddenly, it annoyed him that Steve just wasn’t taking no for an answer. That he was forcing Tony to make a choice between giving Steve his own way, or telling Steve to shut up – for which he would no doubt be blamed.
Belatedly, he recognised it.
“So, Steve tells me you’re a vampire,” Bucky said, simply. “And he didn’t really go into a lot of detail – in fairness, I didn’t ask a lot of questions. Only if he was sure I didn’t hurt you, and he said he was. That’s right, yeah?”
