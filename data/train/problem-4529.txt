Unfortunately for Cas, the murderous witch in question happened to walk into the room at that moment, dashing any of the healer’s hopes that this was just some sort of Halloween movie-induced dream. There was no way his mind would have come up with the Mary Poppins lookalike that strode into the root cellar. The woman looked like she’d be more at home running a PTA bake sale than tossing what looked like chopped up brain bits into the gurgling cauldron, but here they were. Castiel dry heaved at the sight, once again barely managing to keep down whatever he’d eaten last. The choking noise had Bizzarro-Mary Poppins turning around to look in his direction.
“It is if he willingly binds his soul with yours. If you two allow your souls to fully bond, Rowena said it’d stabilize Cassie completely.” Gabe looked smug at his declaration, but Cas felt apprehensive. Fully bonding with someone’s soul seemed like it must be a big deal, he couldn’t ask that of Dean. They’d barely had a chance to get to know one another!
“What are you man, one of those professors Sam gets nerdy about? It’s just presents. We get all get each other a gift and wrap it. Then we give them to the person we got ‘em for and unwrap them.”
Dean opened his eyes in the morning to find a sleeping angel next to him. He froze as soon as he saw Cas there, more worried that the angel had fallen asleep than about the fact that Dean was all to happy to wake up to his best friend lying beside him. He reached over to see if he could wake Cas up and ran into – feathers? Dean quickly rubbed his hands over his face and woke up more definitively. Yup, those were feathers. Large, gorgeous, black feathers that shimmered like obsidian in the sunlight. It was as if every color that had ever existed had come together to create the shimmering black of Castiel’s wings. While concerned about why Cas was sleeping and why his wings were manifested when Dean had only ever seen shadows, Dean couldn’t help but be enthralled with the things. His hand reached out to pet the one blanketing him before he actually thought about it. He had just enough time to appreciate how amazingly soft they felt before Castiel awoke with a gasp. The wing pulled back suddenly and Cas was sitting up staring at Dean in shock.
“You’re just leaving me here?” The woman laughed in response to Castiel’s question.
“I like it. Although I’d prefer you don’t pack him away with those terrible ornaments when Christmas is over.” Sam laughs and Dean sighs in relief.
“Little late on that info, Sammy. Cas and I were ambushed about an hour ago. They’re tracking Baby?”
“I’d appreciate it, jeans aren’t great sleepwear. Do you mind if I grab the shower first? I don’t think I’ll be able to stay awake much longer.”
“He’s not suffering from magic drain. He’s unconscious because his soul is being drained.” Gabe tried to turn back to Cassie, but was distracted by Dean grabbing his shoulder.
“Yes, I’d imagine it’s like grooming.” Dean chuckles.
“Dean will be fine, but there are no such things as Yetis, Sam. It was a witch that transformed itself, I used the witch killing bullets.” Dean heard Sam’s boots in the snow as he approached them but Dean stayed on the ground staring at Cas as he reached his hand up and started pushing his fingers into Cas’ face. Cas swung his attention back to Dean as the older Winchester started pinching Cas’ cheek between his fingers.
“Thank you, Dean. It’s usually not this bad, but between whatever the Bizzaro-witch did to my back and the magic suppressing cuffs I feel more drained than usual.” Dean was concerned about Cas mentioning something being done to his back, but figured he’d say something if he hadn’t been able to heal himself. Dean polished off his burger and got up to paw through his duffle bag.
“Nah, he hates white chocolate. Something about pretending to be chocolate and it being a lie. I dunno, he’s dramatic.” Cas tipped his head to the side examining the colorful candy. After another moment he took a small bite. Dean knew he couldn’t really taste much human food, but he also knew peppermint had a strong flavor. Cas chewed slowly. And then took another small bite.
“Cas is fine, just drained. I’ll let him explain later, I’m not getting into the middle of magical nerd stuff with you two.” Actually, Dean felt that Cas’ angelic nature was his story to tell, it wasn’t up to Dean to share that with anyone else. “Anyway, Gabe got to us at the diner. He’s not driving his car, so don’t worry about that.”
“The same way Charlie can. They caught you on a bunch of different street cameras and I guess they set up an ambush in the direction they thought you were headed. Or maybe they set up a few, but regardless, Baby’s too noticeable. Bobby’s probably okay to tow it, someone would have to do that eventually, but I wouldn’t suggest you guys staying there too long.”
This is a continuation of days 1 and 4 (Chapters 1 & 2)
When they reach their room, Dean opts to take a shower before swapping case notes so Cas tries to take that time to compose himself. When given moments away from Dean, where there is a chance for quiet, the angel forces himself to let the feelings he has for the infuriating man wash over him. He lets himself feel the pain at having to let him go up against Amara alone. He lets himself feel the overwhelming joy at seeing him alive once again. He lets himself feel how much he’s fallen in love with the beautiful human being. He recalls talking to Anna at the beginning of what would become his fall, her telling him it only gets worse. He has no doubt now that she wasn’t just referring to his struggle with doubt. An angel that can feel things akin to a human can easily become overwhelmed. They were not built for these sensations, and so, every time Castiel lets go to indulge in the wash of his emotions he pulls on his grace and works to reign them in one at a time. By the time Dean emerges from the shower Castiel has regained some semblance of stoicism.
“She died the same day as I was born, I never knew her. Uncle Gabe is the only family I have. My uncle doesn’t even have a picture, he had to take me and run. He told me she was killed by the Demon Coven, and that she’d saved my life. Like you probably saved mine today. I’m sorry I haven’t said it yet, but thank you Dean.” Cas’ voice dropped lower, fingers dancing over the feather sigil before he found himself looking up into sad green eyes as Dean reached across to place his hand alongside the tattoo, weaving their fingers together.
“Yes. We were looking anyway.”
“You’re far from a boring old human Dean, I think you’re Cassie here’s soul compliment. Rowena would know more but, play along for a second here, can you touch his wings?” Dean looked confused, but was wondering the same thing himself, although he didn’t know what Gabe meant by ‘soul compliment’.
“You might want to slow down and chew, sunshine. The cow’s already dead, it ain’t going nowhere.” Cas rolled his eyes at Dean’s remark and moved on to inhaling his fries. Dean wondered how long it had been since Cas ate and vaguely remembered Sam mentioning how physically draining magic use could be. Deciding Cas’ needs were greater than his own, Dean sacrificed his fries and focused on his own burger.
“I’ll be okay, Dean. It’s just been an exceptionally long day. Just promise you’ll remind me to lock Sam in Rowena’s basement the next time he tries to convince me that we should be witch vigilantes.”
“Yeah, we could probably make it work. I’m not sure until I try though, you’re much more powerful than the last time I did this. You should also know, there’s no way you’d be unaware this time. Binding an angel’s wings is a punishment reserved for angels who are deemed traitors to our kind. Once you’ve experienced your angelic nature – and make no mistake Cassie, you have now with that healing display – you’ll feel like you’re missing an essential part of yourself. It’s like losing the ability to see in color, or missing a limb. That’s part of the reason I never told you, if you had known about the binding you would have started to experience the constricting nature of it.” Cas frowned, and barely noticed when Dean pushed Cas’ hand away so he could talk.
“Yeah, and it worked. For the record, I’d have done that even if it wasn’t to trick the thing though. Better me than you.” Dean was maybe angrier than he expected. He realized he’d been worried about how long Cas would last against that thing as he noted cuts that weren’t healing and the way the angel was swaying as he tried to hold himself upright. He also noticed that the blue in Cas’ eyes was in no way diminishing as he glowered at Dean.
“No.” Sam peeked into the box Dean had just opened as it was pushed aside into what he imagined was Dean’s junk pile. It was full of smaller boxes. Sam pulled one out and laughed. They were tree ornaments, and really ugly ones at that. Dean just continued to pull more boxes out, but looking at the hideous ornaments Sam realized with a start that it was almost Christmas. Maybe Sam had more than one idea of how to cheer his brother up.
“It was alright, bakeries are pretty popular in the fall and there’s some huge family reunion going on in town that about wiped me out this afternoon. Oh, and then Sam called to say he plans on staying in Stanford for Thanksgiving because he feels like he needs the time to catch up.” Cas could hear the disappointment in Dean’s voice and he reached out to grab Dean’s hand.
Shit. Even more goddamned witches.
Castiel couldn’t remember a time when he had felt happier. In all fairness, he had spent most of his existence without feeling much emotion at all, but this was different than even the brief moments of satisfaction he had experienced in more recent years. When they reached the Wayside Inn Cas agreed with the ‘quaint’ assessment. It was a stone inn from the 1800s. They had already been relatively packed by the time Sam and Charlie were looking for rooms, so all four of them were sharing one of the larger suites. There was a large window seat that Cas found appealing as he could watch as the snow fell and muffled all of the outdoor noise. He especially liked how the Christmas lights reflected off of the powdery white snow drifts.
While Dean had been grateful that Sam was there for him as Dean worked his way through preliminary treatments before getting on the biologic that restored him almost back to normal, Dean didn’t want Sam to make his decisions based off of Dean’s condition. Hell, Dean didn’t want any of their choices made because of Dean’s chronic disease. So, Dean put on a happy face and practically shoved his brother out the door to take advantage of his full ride to Stanford. Quitting his job as a mechanic to open up his own bakery had been what really convinced Sam that Dean would be alright without him.
“I’ll do everything I can Sammy. Fill me in quickly and then go back inside and stay there until I get back.” Dean listened carefully as his brother went over the information he’d obtained and then briefly told him about where they had found the witch and how Cas had made sure Sam had an opportunity to escape at the older witch’s own expense. Dean popped Baby’s trunk as he listened and loaded one of his guns with witch-killing bullets as Sam talked. He also grabbed one of his hunting rifles, grateful he had witch-killing ammo for something more equipped for distance. This lady sounded more dangerous than Sam had initially anticipated and Dean would rather not get too close if he didn’t need to.
“Well, if you’re really sure of what you want, you should go and make it happen. I’ll be even more awesome and help you out.” Charlie took out her phone and spent a few moments messing around with it. Then she passed it over to Dean. He smiled as he read over the screen advertising an all day viewing of Christmas movies at the building that was originally a theatre back in the 19th century. Apparently, the current owners had kept one of the viewing rooms maintained for special occasions.
“Is there any way to tell if the good Captain is still here?” Dean waved towards the roots of the tree. Cas shook his head. “Ah well, I’d be surprised if they were still here. I guess we better find out what exactly Louisa Abbot was into.” They started walking back towards the car.
Cas collected a branch from the Wych Elm growing out of Captain Abbot’s grave, mindful of the tree’s reputation for dropping branches on unsuspecting passersby. Then Cas took a few moments to make sure the caretaker knew that he and his partner may be around afterhours because of the attack yesterday and was happy to find out that she had already decided to stay with a friend until she felt safer. Cas made quick work of the elm branch, pleased with how easy it was to shape into a stake. The sun would set soon so Castiel got to work engraving the sigil they would need directly into the tree trunk. Once Dean brought the last ingredient it should only take them a few minutes to complete everything. With any luck the vampire would come to them.
“That would be acceptable.” Cas paused to look out over the cemetery again before opening the passenger side door of the Impala. Dean noticed the angel’s hesitation.
“You seem to be thinking hard. It’s too early in the morning for that, Dean.” Dean grinned at Cas’ grouchy morning voice. Cas had become human enough to need sleep and so far, waking up was high on the list of the angel’s least favorite mortal experiences. Dean continued to create a trail of shimmering ripples as he carded his hands in the soft feathers, increasing the pressure of his fingers now that he knew his husband was awake.
“No, this isn’t supposed to be there.” Cas’ eyes were wide with panic as he pointed towards his back, and Dean couldn’t help but step closer. He placed a comforting hand on Cas’ face. Dean barely noticed when he started to move his thumb across Cas’ cheekbones, the need to calm the man was overwhelming.
“Goodbye, sister.”
“I’m here Sam. I’m happy to bring a tree to assist with your holiday rituals. Please send me the address.” Cas ended the call. He was absurdly happy at the idea of being included in decorating a tree with the Winchesters. He was worried about Dean of course, but he wasn’t surprised to hear that Mary left. She had expressed that she felt out of place. If Sam thought having a Christmas tree would help, then Cas would get a tree. He glanced at the address on his screen and drove to the store.
“Anna, I don’t know what I can do for it. The baby doesn’t have enough grace to finish balancing out the growing soul.” Honestly, Gabriel wasn’t sure he should be saving the child. If he survived and Azazel got ahold of him it could be catastrophic.
“Uh-huh. Not to state the obvious but Cas has a dude’s vessel. Have you ever seen Dean hook up with another guy?” Sam’s eyebrows raised and then dropped to a deep furrow.
“Do you want to borrow some sweats and a t-shirt, Cas? I always carry a few days’ worth of clothes.” Impressively, Cas had already managed to finish off the rest of the food.
The more the warm water woke him up the more he started to panic. Holy shit, that hadn’t been a dream. Could he just play it off as a Christmas tradition? Cas hadn’t said anything, although he was fairly certain he had fallen asleep on the window seat which means that the angel must have moved him to the bed at some point. What if Cas knew that Dean had wanted to kiss him in spite of the mistletoe, that the plant had just been an excuse to do what he had already wanted to do? What if Cas just kissed him because of the mistletoe and it wasn’t anything more to him? What if it was more? What the hell was Dean supposed to do about any of it?
“Sam, I know what I’m going to do for him.” Sam rolled his eyes.
“Well, well. I guess dear old Melody wasn’t pulling our chain. I can’t tell what the fuck it is, but it’s not a witch.” Cas scrambled to the side of the cage furthest away from the black-eyed man, not that there was anywhere to go. Something about those eyes terrified him, and the longer he stared the more the man’s face appeared inhuman. What the hell was going on?
“Alright children, gather round!” Cas’ scowl returned at Gabriel’s antics.
“Gabriel. What’s wrong with him? Does he just need to sleep off the magic drain?” Gabriel glanced over his shoulder to see Dean hovering, his face a mask of worry.
“What does he want with these?” Castiel shrugged slightly. Being a very experienced tactician, he knew the best strategy for convincing Dean to help decorate. More than anything else Dean was motivated by helping others.
“Back off asshole. What the fuck did you do to Cas? What do you even want with him?”
Now if he could just have a bit more luck, he thought he could use getting one another presents as a way of showing his brother that Cas loved him back, and that Sam was happy that Dean had fallen in love.
“Oh dear, you didn’t forget? And with only ten shopping days left!” Crowley smiled mockingly. Cas just glared at Crowley and slammed money on the bar for the beer he hadn’t touched.
Cas is somewhat relieved to be dropped off at the cemetery. While Dean hadn’t reacted poorly to being draped in an angel wing this morning, or the fact that Cas was asleep in the same bed, he couldn’t help feeling that he had been pushing things too far. He hadn’t meant to fall asleep while also solidifying his wings. He needed to conserve his grace for more important tasks. While Castiel was truly content to just be a part of Dean’s life it was difficult to remind himself that he could not have more, especially with his poor control over the very human-like emotions he now experienced. What was really tipping him over the edge though, was how Dean kept reacting. Dean did not react with anger or defensiveness when he found himself in situations that hinted of a more intimate relationship with Cas. He acted as if it were normal and even welcome. It surprised Cas, but it also gave him some of the hope that he had never really allowed himself to have. It was distracting, which made it all the better that he would be prepping the spell by himself.
“You’re talking about soul mates. He’ll have to find the one person in the world who’s a match for his grace formed soul. Does that even exist?”
“Fine. No, I guess not. Whatever. Stop feeding Sam’s smugness.” Dean rolls his eyes but also throws his arms around his angel pulling him closer. Sam is absolutely radiating an aura of you owe me and I’m amazing, but Dean chooses to ignore him for now. If he’s honest, Dean doesn’t really mind. He has Cas, and while he knows being together won’t always be this easy, he’s grateful for any moment that he can spend with his arms around the person he loves.
“Wow, Cas. I will say the one human trait that’s given you very little problems is sarcasm.” Cas just continued to look at Dean expectantly. “Alright, alright, lets go get you coffee, angel.”
“Cas? Everything okay?” Cas looked up to see Dean’s hypnotizing green eyes glancing at him in the rearview mirror. Cas had conceded ‘shotgun’ to Sam because his legs were so much longer. Sam had his headphones on listening to a podcast and Cas must have stayed quiet for too long after Dean had been talking to him.
“No. Actually, they seem to be fuller. Allowing my grace to flow more easily into them seems to be healing them, that must be why they are painful.”
“Right to business then? No sweet nothings whispered in my ear? I’m almost insulted.”
Castiel did wonder why Dean was in such a good mood. He’d like to know what it took to get Dean into this type of mindset, for future reference. Maybe it was just celebrating Christmas, but Cas had known Dean for a long time and he’d never seen a holiday make him so happy. Perhaps… well, maybe there was something to what Sam had told him yesterday. Sam had said Dean was better when Cas was around which wasn’t something the angel had ever thought about before. Cas knew that Dean had made him better, and he preferred it when he was with Dean. It had taken him years to work out that he was actually in love with Dean, but he’d been satisfied to just watch over him until Metranon stole his grace and Castiel had become human.
“What are you doing, Dean-o? Are you a witch like your brother?” Dean’s eyes widened at the implication.
“I can feel them too, Cas. They aren’t on your skin exactly, but I do feel feathers. They’re changing color a bit, they’re kind of black but the color shifts as I touch them. What does that mean?” Cas yawned, no longer having the energy to wonder about all the questions he had no answers for. Cas stretched out onto the bed and was happy to feel Dean shift behind him and continue caressing his back. Cas snuggled into a threadbare motel pillow and sunk into the feeling of Dean’s comforting thrum and soothing touch.
“Okay, but how are they tracking Baby?”
Dean reflects on the changes he and Cas have undergone since saving Cas from the Empty.
“Thanks Cas. I – I just wanted to say that I’m happy you came back home when she left.” Dean briefly squeezed Cas’ fingers before returning his hand to the steering wheel. Castiel slowly pulled his hand back into his lap breathing out a quiet ‘you’re welcome’ in response to Dean’s words. The way Dean had been acting recently, this was why Castiel had started to hope. The car fell silent as he stared at the hand on which the angel could still feel a ghost of Dean’s touch.
“Mrs. Paige said that the victim may have been a descendant of Captain Abbot, but she wasn’t sure. She suggested the Historical Society again, if we needed further information. She did say that she knew Louisa Abbot when she was a teenager. She was one of several teenagers she used to call the police on for breaking into the cemetery after hours to party. Mrs. Paige said she hadn’t really seen her in more recent years.
“I’m not worried about the wings, kid. I am concerned that they’re unbound and that you can see them.” Gabe pushed Dean to the side and pulled Cassie out of the car. Looking around, he decided they needed a better location to try and figure this out. “Where were you headed, Cassie said you were going somewhere safe from the Demon Coven?”
“Sure Cas,” Dean says a bit breathlessly, “lead the way.” Dean follows his angel back into the hall thinking that, while he’s sure he will love whatever Cas got him, the best present is knowing that he possibly had helped Cas feel like he really did belong here with him.
“Sure.” Charlie handed her phone over to Sam. He took a few moments to look through them with a grin growing across his face.
“See? You’re thrumming. It’s more intense when you touch me.” Dean tries to pull his hand back, worried he had hurt Castiel, but Cas grabs his hand and keeps it in place. “Can’t you feel that?”
“I would like to show you part of my true self. A part you can safely see with the aid of that potion.” Dean’s eyes sparkle, he’s clearly intrigued and Cas’ smile grows more confident. “It will give you partial access to otherworldly sight, similar to what many human psychics can see. With the dosage Sam and I measured out it should last for about a day. It’s somewhat variable dependent on your metabolism. If you decide to take it, I will meet you halfway and manifest a small representation of my true self.”
“Did you bring pre-made dough from the grocery store? Really?” Cas chuckled.
“Alright, asshole. Time to talk. What the hell does your coven want with a healing witch?” The demon sneered at Dean.
“We haven’t gone to get coffee yet. I believe someone mentioned coffee to me before starting this endeavor but we’ve been walking around for an hour, and I still have yet to see any.” Dean rolled his eyes.
“Right, right. Sheesh, no appreciation for the art of suspense here, tough audience. Anyway, I wasn’t joking kiddo, you’re not fully human. Your mom, well your Grace donor more accurately, was an angel. That feather for Anna? I embedded one of her actual feathers when I made the sigil for her. The sigil for me? That’s mine.” Cas weighed Gabe’s words carefully. His uncle seemed to be sincere, and it’s not that Cas didn’t seem to be sporting some very angelic looking wings.
“Calm down, Red! He’s not a Nephilim and he’s also not mine. More like… a nephew? I guess? I need help stabilizing him, I can hide him well enough after that.”
Now all Dean had to do was to get up the nerve to actually talk to Cas, but he figured taking him out to see Christmas movies in a historic theater was as good a starting point as any.
“Yes, he seemed to think I was running out of ‘shopping days’.” Dean just shook his head at Cas’ air quotes and pulled the lights through the bottom of the tree. Sam brought the ornaments over and passed some to the others and they showed Cas where to hang them. Even though Sam had planned this to cheer Dean up, he also found himself grinning non-stop. Now that Sam thought about it, standing here talking about presents with his brother and Cas, while happily making jokes about the Men of Letters choice in tree ornaments, was the closest thing he had experienced to a real family Christmas.
His human friends all ate dinner quickly while Cas stole a few fries just to get Dean to look at him. He could tell Dean felt awkward about what happened in the restaurant, and because Dean felt awkward, Cas felt it as well. He didn’t know what had come over him but he would try to restrain himself a bit more in the future. Even so, he had thought that Dean had leaned into the kiss as well. Cas rolled his shoulders to dispel some of the tingling sensation of his grace running through his wings. They had pulsed again when he and Dean had almost – well, if nothing else Dean’s first look at Castiel’s wings would be more impressive with how much they had healed.
“Dean! Did you get Cas? What’s going on? Where are you? Are you okay?”
“Fuck!” This was a terrible plan; the service road was coming up on them fast as Dean spotted a car turning the corner. He wasn’t sure if crashing into a tree, getting mauled by a Yeti, or hit by an incoming car was a better way to go out. Meanwhile the Yeti was still chasing them.
“Dean?” Cas’ beautiful rough voice snapped Dean out of his reverie. He was relieved to see his friend’s bleary blue eyes blinking up at him.
“Do you really want to drive the Impala in a potential blizzard? Besides, Charlie already found us a suite at the historic bed and breakfast. It’s… quaint. Also, they have some sort of special blueberry French toast they make in the mornings, so we figured you’d be okay with it.” Dean conceded that he didn’t want to drive Baby in a blizzard and he had already parked her in a paid for covered space because it was the most secure parking lot he had found here. He also wouldn’t say no to French toast.
Sam was worrying more and more about Dean. He knew his brother said he understood why Mom needed her space, but Dean was withdrawing more and more. When they weren’t on a hunt Dean found all sorts of projects around the bunker that required manual labor. The last few days his brother had only communicated with one-word responses and only when Sam asked him a direct question. Sam had been relieved when Cas texted him that he was on the way to them, Dean was always better with Cas around.
Dean took the paper from her as they continued walking. It was listed as an all-ages window and store hunt with different prizes every night and Dean laughed as he saw what they were supposed to be looking for.
“He’s not Nephilim. Azazel was trying to create new angels, angels that he could control. This one was the first time he’s been close to success but I couldn’t leave him to be used by Hell. He was born from my grace, my grace and the faint remnants of a stillborn infant’s human soul.” Gabriel looked at his sister in horror. She was right, the child wasn’t a Nephilim, not exactly. He was, however, invaluable if Azazel perfected the process.
Gabriel reached into Anna and pulled out the last of her grace, trying to ignore the pain on his sister’s face. Quickly, Gabriel siphoned it into the infant, using some of his own power to facilitate the transfer. There was a burst of light and Gabriel barely managed to place the child safely on the floor before being thrown back with the force of the merging. When Gabriel managed to regain his equilibrium he rushed back over to the baby, who was now crying loudly.
“Well, I didn’t say anything because I wanted an honest choice from you without bribery, but when you wear my feather you should be able to see them anyway, especially since you said you can feel me through it. You may even be able to see them at times when they aren’t manifested in this realm.” Dean’s face is almost giddy at this news and Cas laughs again. Cas grasps Dean’s hand and this time he doesn’t protest as he’d led back into the warmth of the bunker. Cas takes a moment to push his wings away from the physical realm before going back inside. Dean continues to look behind Cas.
“I’m a witch, and a healer at that. The Demon Coven won’t take kindly to you wasting their time with someone as mundane as myself.” Bizzaro-Poppins laughed and reached her hand towards Castiel’s back. He couldn’t see what she did but all of a sudden, he felt a wrenching pain, as if she were sinking claws into him.
Eventually though, they reached their destination and Dean dropped Castiel’s hand to hold open the door to the small shop with local artwork decorating the walls. Cas immediately missed the feeling of Dean’s hand but pretended to be absorbed in reading the menu board to compose himself before looking back over at his best friend.
“Was Captain Abbot an ancestor of the victim?” Cas’ question caught Dean off guard. There was something strangely mesmerizing about the massive twisting trunk rising out of the ground exactly where the remains of Captain Abbot would have been. Dean registered that Cas and the caretaker were continuing to talk, but Dean stepped away to examine the tree more carefully. It’s roots, on the surface at least, didn’t seem to spread out much. Rather they seemed to go straight down into the Earth. Its trunk was thick enough to have been there for hundreds of years despite having only appeared a few days ago. The tree itself was knotted in appearance, with ugly, twisted branches shooting out in all directions. For some reason it occurred to Dean that the tree looked like it was screaming in pain. Dean jumped when he suddenly felt Cas’ hand on his shoulder.
“No Dean. Sam woke up at some ungodly hour and already ate. Cas said he only wanted coffee so they decided it was a good time to go retrieve your car. The worst of the storm didn’t end up hitting us and Cas said the parking lot here was safer or something. That you’d be worried with ‘Baby’ in a public lot for too long.” Dean choked up a little at the idea of Cas dragging Sam out first thing in the morning to take care of Baby. He was a bit disappointed that he hadn’t seen Cas yet this morning, but maybe this was an opportunity, Dean thought he should talk to someone before he lost his mind. Maybe.
“That’s fucking genius Sam! I gotta go!” Dean hung up on Sam and popped the trunk. Digging out some ammo he realized he wouldn’t be able to actually etch anything, so he hoped a sharpie would work and that the part of the bullet he could draw on wouldn’t get warped from firing or impact in such a way that if broke the sigil. Dean figured he’d make as many as he could in the next five minutes and hope at least a few of them worked as intended.
“Give me the baby, Anna. Let me see what can be done for him.” Anna looked into Gabriel’s eyes for a long moment but whatever she saw there seemed to satisfy her. She placed the child in her brother’s waiting arms, breathing a soft sigh of relief.
“Still, this can’t be just a coincidence. The Demon Coven killed my mom, when I was four. Sam was just a baby. This pull I feel towards you, our moms both being attacked by the same monsters, there’s something more going on here.” Cas noticed the feather sigil beneath their hands warming under their combined touch. Cas leaned into Dean, as if the man’s gravitational force had increased, sucking Cas in. Their eyes locked, mirror images of old loss and new desire, and Cas suddenly felt that nothing mattered more than getting closer to the compelling man beside him.
“I am sorry that your mother left.” Dean took a deep breath and for a moment Castiel thought Dean was going to start shouting at him. Cas would let him shout if that’s what he needed. Before he could start though, Cas saw Dean look at his face and wince. Perhaps Dean could read Castiel’s compassion in his eyes. Holding Dean’s gaze Cas saw the deep pain that reverberated through Dean’s being. Cas didn’t even stop to think. He pulled Dean into his arms and hugged him fiercely. Dean’s mother left, so Cas would stay as long as Dean needed him. He tried to pour that reassurance into the embrace. Surprisingly Dean didn’t resist, he just melted into the hug.
“Did you finish room 5, Castiel?” Alex stared at him expectantly. Silently, Cas handed over the trash bag and muttered something about taking his lunch break outside. Too embarrassed by his very obvious admiration of the man that must have been Dean, Cas didn’t think he could talk to him in front of Alex. He rushed out the front door in the hopes that the autumn air would help him pull himself together. He didn’t know why he’d felt so compelled to talk to a man who’s private and very personal conversation he’d overheard. He was almost glad that his humiliating gawking had saved him from speaking to the guy. After all, what would he have said anyway? The air alone wasn’t helping Castiel’s composure, so he began pacing in front of the building.
“Dean, it’s right behind you!” Impulsively, Dean spun his lid around so he was now speeding down towards the road backwards. Hoping he didn’t hit a tree he managed to pull his gun out and shoot at the rampaging monster. Not that he managed to hit it more than once.
“Unlikely, unless you were to go on a hunt. It would make you slightly more aware of ghosts.”
“I mean how do you go up to a stranger and tell them they aren’t alone and that good things do happen? It’s not like it wouldn’t embarrass the guy to know I overheard him talking about his money problems…” Cas froze as he heard someone clear their throat behind him.
“Yeah, I bound his powers when he was still a baby. To save his life, by the way.” Cas whimpered as Gabe combed his hand through a rough looking patch of feathers.
“Um, well, I asked you to come back because… because Mom left. Dean hasn’t been handling it well, and I thought you and I could maybe do something to remind him that he still had us.” Cas took a deep breath and didn’t speak for a moment. It was hard to think of Dean dealing with his mother’s absence again. “Cas?”
“I can work with that, maybe we can make something similar. What we aren’t doing is using store bought crust.” Cas shook his head at Dean fondly.
Castiel returned to the bunker to hear the Winchesters arguing over something about the tree. Cas dropped off the food in the kitchen and took another bag with him to see what was going on. Absurdly, he walked in on them standing back to admire the new tree topper – which was apparently him. Castiel wasn’t sure whether to laugh or glower. He settled for asking them what in the world was going on. Dean rubbed his hand on the back of his head while Sam pointedly looked elsewhere.
“Well hello to you as well, Feathers.”
“Whoa, slow the fuck down Sammy! Yeah, I got Cas, he’s fine. Don’t worry about the rest right now, you need to go hide out somewhere for a while.”
“I was just saying there isn’t anything new on the Lucifer front. No new cases either.”
“Well, long story short Cassie, you’re a kind of hybrid angel and Dean-o here is your human soul mate.”
“Yes, what supplies do you require?”
“Awesome! You’re pretty good at this angel spotting thing.” Dean smirked and winked at the actual angel in the store.
“So, we have to stake the vampire? Seriously?” Dean was amused at the idea of staking a vampire actually working.
Dean and Cas make up their pie making date and figure out that they are both on the same page.
“Yes, thank you Charlie. We just found the last one in the window here.”
“Yeah! Sounds like a plan. Although those ornaments are really ugly.” Cas chuckled as they made their way out of the storage area.
“I accept you Castiel.” Dean smiles, glorious in his choice, and his voice is saturated with love as a small flare of grace glows where the pendant hangs. Cas sighs as he can feel Dean’s heartbeat through the new connection, and he watches as Dean takes in the small change in feeling as well.
“What the fuck are you talking about, man? Did you already forget the boring human speech?”
When they finally arrived at the front of the line of cars entering the ranch, Dean began to understand why there was a crowd. The lights draped everywhere were impressive and Dean was happy to note that Cas seemed taken in by the display. It always cheered Dean up to see Castiel happy, it felt like those instances were all too rare in their line of work. Dean and Cas showed their badges at the entrance and asked where they could find Janice. They were directed to a side road for staff and Dean noticed the small frown of Cas’ face.
Cas pulled up to the still lit windows of Winchester’s Pies and Pastries in his beat-up Chevy Cobalt. The car was a bit of a lemon but Cas was attached to it as it had been his constant companion since leaving home for college. He smiled as he locked the car door, recalling how Dean had tried for all of five minutes to refrain from criticizing it. Looking up at the bakery windows Cas shivers in anticipation of finally having a night alone with the man he’s rapidly become infatuated with. He eagerly strides up to the door, texting as he walks to let Dean know he’s arrived.
Turning the corner Cas was startled to see what could only be a 6-foot flannel-wearing freckled god. The man was Hollywood beautiful and for a moment Cas forgot what had brought him rushing around the corner in the first place. The sound of Alex pointedly snapping her fingers brought Castiel back to reality as he broke of his inappropriate staring. He felt his skin heat up rapidly as he blushed.
“So, this lady at the historical society was great. She apparently teaches genealogy classes for free to the public or something, so she was able to pull up the victim’s ancestry pretty fast. Captain Abbot was her ancestor all right, so at least we have that connection. Couldn’t find much out about the family besides that, so we should talk to Louisa’s next of kin tomorrow. I think the police report said she had a sister locally.” Castiel agrees to the plan and pulls out some information he had printed at the library.
“Well that’s good, Dean, because you only have eight days left until Christmas.”
“I’m sure he will appreciate it Cas. You make him better, you know. He’s cares for himself more when you’re here, I don’t worry about him as much.” They had made it to the roof and Cas turned around to look at Sam with a solemn expression.
“Yeah, how’d you feel about hunting with me once you feel a bit better? I bet you’re awesome at research, and we could stay together longer while we figure out this bond thing. Even if you decide to have Gabe bind your wings again, I could use a badass hunting partner. I promise I’m much better at this than Sam.” To Dean’s relief, Cas grinned at him.
“I can track Cassie through his feather sigil, it’s basically a fancy medical alert. Cassie’s magic seems to have taken care of the demonic chucklehead; I wouldn’t worry about that for now. I would like to know how they managed to track Cassie though.” Dean seemed to accept Gabriel’s vague explanation as acceptable in light of his concern for Cas.
“I think it works just fine Cas.” Dean grinned at his companion, appreciating the guy’s sense of humor, especially in light of being captured by a murderer.
“They aren’t just shadows anymore Cas. I can see individual feathers; I can see their color – I think. It changes. It’s uh, it’s hard to describe but they look like every color I’ve ever seen shimmering through the blackness of space,” Dean says breathlessly. He seems startled at his own description and laughs softly. “Damn, Cas, they’re so spectacular they’re making me sound fucking poetic. They’re amazing. You’re amazing.”
“I think we can get the pie started and then eat while it bakes, if that’s okay with you.” Cas hummed in agreement and the two of them got to work. Dean shared some of his crust making secrets explaining to Cas that he was lucky Dean was a baker as he always has some of his own dough ready to use. Cas shared stories about his grandmother, along with some fairly outrageous stories about his brother, Gabriel. Dean was surprised by the simplicity of the peach pie recipe, but he was more surprised that Cas didn’t seem to know what actually counted as a pie.
Castiel had been warned about the Demon Coven more than once. Uncle Gabriel had warned him time and time again to be cautious, to keep a low profile. Cas’ mother Anna had been targeted by the cult, and while Gabriel had never been forthcoming with any details, he made it clear that she’d escaped them to protect her child. Now here he was being sold to them because some witch decided that he was unusual, more than just a run of the mill witch.
“I have no idea what you are implying Crowley.”
“We don’t have time to worry about that, Sam. Pass the info to Charlie, I’m sure either she or Bobby can find someone to go after her.”
“Don’t worry about it, Cas. Okay, so Louisa was trying to make her own breed of vampire.”
“What were you thinking? What if I hadn’t been fast enough?” Dean let Castiel rant at him for a few moments, standing up and dusting off the dirt from the back of his jeans.
“Why… why would he say that? He’s always chosen us over Heaven, chosen humans.” Dean started to internally panic at the idea of Cas deciding to leave one day.
“No, like I said it was just unexpected, not harmful. I apologize, I didn’t mean for them to be out for so long.” Dean was surprised to note that Cas looked embarrassed.
“So, you are trying for blackmail, clever.” Charlie rolled her eyes. “Actually, can I see the pictures?”
“Okay, so this may sound strange, but I need you to pick up a tree. And a tree stand. And lights. Oh, and when you get here text me so I can help you sneak them in.” Sam had lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. Castiel was confused.
“Dammit boy, you want to tell me what the hell is going on? I just saw you lot appear out of thin air.” Bobby took out a flask without relinquishing the gun, and proceeded to splash the whole group. Gabe decided to ignore the holy water and the gun and flew another small hop into the house having seen a couch through the door. He put Cassie down gently and started to evaluate the state of his nephew’s wings, and therefore his Grace, more closely.
“Yes. Aspects of angel wings can retain physicality in certain circumstances as well. For example, a feather removed from our wings with purpose can retain enough of a, hm, echo of our grace to retain physicality. The purpose of this spell follows a similar principle. The difficulty is in maintaining it for a period of time without draining my grace too badly. It’s also strange because my wings are already altered when I’m in a vessel to be proportionate to the human body. They are only a reflection of my true form, so I’m attempting to alter and alteration.” Sam thought about that for a moment.
“You said you could kind of taste the peppermint bark we made, right? The have peppermint flavor on the specials board, if you want.” Cas nodded and let Dean order coffee for Castiel and hot chocolate for himself. While Dean was ordering Cas looked around at some of the artwork hanging on the walls, keeping an eye out for their last scavenger hunt angel. He was contemplating a painting that seemed to be an abstract version of a human eye when Dean came up behind him holding two mismatched mugs.
Making it up far enough in the line to order, they both wanted double cheeseburgers (Dean’s with bacon and Cas’ with extra pickles). The smell of burgers and seasoned fries filled up the car, and Cas’ long day without much food caught up to him with an audible growl of his stomach, shocking a surprised laugh from both of them. The drive to a local motel passed in comfortable silence.
“Uh, don’t babies need, like, other stuff?” The glare that Rowena turned towards Gabe would have turned lesser creatures to stone. It was clear that the idea had just occurred to Gabriel that human babies needed more than just air to survive.
“Hiya, Dean-o. I’m Cassie’s Uncle Gabe. You mind letting me get a closer look at my nephew there?” Dean glowered at Gabe, obviously suspicious.
“Let’s go back inside. You should sleep for a while, so we can exchange gifts with Sam in the morning.” Dean frowns in response to this suggestion.
“Hey, look, there are lights up here too!” Dean gestures to the string lights propped up on tall stands around the edges of the rooftop. Castiel knows Sam must have put them up and wonders how Sam knew he’d end up doing this at night. Cas silently thanks his friend for the forethought. Dean follows one of the strands back to its source to find the on switch and suddenly the rooftop is softly lit with tiny imitations of the stars in the sky. Cas silently hands the potion back to Dean. It feels as if words aren’t needed in this moment, and Dean must feel it as well. He acts rather than speaking and throws back the potion as if it were a shot.
“Go ahead.” Sam thanked her and spent a few moments emailing himself some of the photos.
“Cas, you’re practically a planetarium. It’s like there are whole galaxies in here. I could look forever and never see all there is to see.” As this is one of the better human descriptions of angel true forms, Castiel feels content that he has shown the man he loves much more of what he really is. That Dean shows such quiet wonder at this glimpse of the heart of Castiel makes him feel safe to take another risk, one that means even more. He presses his wings in to bring Dean even closer, until their chests are almost touching. Cas pulls the smaller gift out of his pocket and lays it in Dean’s hand. Dean’s eyes are alight with curiosity as he peels off the paper. He shoves the crumpled paper in his coat pocket and lets the pendant that had been within drop, carefully holding the chain in his fingers. He squints at the pendant, a feather preserved on top of bronze, and then gasps.
“Anything new?” Cas looked up at Dean as if the sun had come out after a storm. For a moment Dean just stared back, stunned more than usual by the angel’s fathomless blue eyes. He realized Cas was talking, but he hadn’t actually heard a word he said.
“Yeah, I wouldn’t be surprised. Still, it’s kinda concerning.” Dean fidgeted with the bedspread as Cas tried to work out what exactly was bothering the man.
“Part of the reason? Is there more, Gabe?”
Seeing Dean get hit in the chest and collide with his own car left Cas shocked. He froze for almost a moment too long, but managed to dive across the front seat just in time to catch Dean and drag him back inside. Unfortunately, that was all he managed to accomplish before more debris started raining down on their location. Struggling to close the open driver’s side door, Cas stretched out over Dean, silently praying he’d be okay. Cas knew if he could just concentrate for a few minutes, he’d be able to channel a healing spell. The thrumming sensation he associated with Dean was rapidly fading, and Cas knew he had to act quickly.
“I get it doc, I do, but $400 a month? It’s basically choosing between eating and my ability to move without pain.”
While it’s not exactly a question, Cas understands that he needs to put this in more human terms. “Yes, Dean. You would be accepting that what we have is more than just friendship. I love you Dean. I am content with just being by your side, and if you do not love me the same way nothing has to change. However, these past days have allowed me to hope for more. So, I am offering you more. I am offering you me, if you choose to accept me.” Castiel’s hand has moved up to cradle Dean’s face, but he needs Dean to choose what he wants and does not move further.
“Cas!” Castiel caught up to Dean a few moments later. “We should do this.” Dean pointed to the event page. Cas gave Dean an all to rare laugh when he saw what Dean was showing him.
Despite his persistent fascination with Dean, Cas begins to nod off. Between the growl of the car’s engine, the soothing smell of well cared for leather, and the never-ending thrum of Dean’s presence Cas felt safe and comforted. He didn’t want to fall asleep though, what if this was all just some sort of strange concussion induced dream? Cas found himself pushing his hands up his sleeves and pressing into the skin over his deltoids – an old habit to reassure himself that he was real and present in the world. He trailed his fingers over the ridges of the tattoo-like sigils his Uncle Gabriel had given him sometime before Cas could walk. Only he and Gabe could see and feel them, but it was enough to calm Cas’ racing mind. Lost in thought, Cas didn’t hear Dean talking and felt his leg jump as the man beside him tapped Castiel’s leg to get his attention.
“Welcome back, sunshine. I’m Sam’s brother, Dean. Your head is pretty banged up but if you think you can walk a bit, I can get you to my car and away from what’s left of those asshole witches who tried to kidnap you.” Cas blinked a few more times and seemed to be trying to absorb what Dean had just said.
“Okay, okay. Give me a minute.” Sam tried to be patient as he heard soft tapping noises, likely from Charlie’s keyboard. “Here’s something. It’s maybe ninety minutes or so away from you guys, but it’s not far from where I am. There’s this historic riverside city that has something called Midnight Madness where all the stores are open late into the night. They have a bunch of sales and decorations, but from the event listing it looks like mostly locals show up, and it’s semi-remote. Ooo, didn’t you say they’d been baking together?”
“Sure, yeah. I do. It just, feels strange to say it? I dunno, Charlie. I feel like I’ve barely come to terms with saying I’m bisexual, much less saying I want a boyfriend.” Charlie’s smile expanded.
“Dean?” Sam could hear some boxes being moved around in one of the rooms they’d been using for storage. He looked through the doorway to see his brother opening up an old box.
Sam seized his opportunity a few hours later when Cas had been sent out on a supply run by Dean. Sam found Dean in the middle of working on his Christmas present for Cas, understanding now why Dean had sent the angel out on his own for food they didn’t really need.
“Wow, Cas. I can see them – well the projection at least.” Castiel curled his wings in front of him to examine them. He seemed mildly surprised by something. “Is there something wrong Cas?”
Reaching out a shaking hand, Dean sunk his fingers into the softest and yet most exhilarating thing he’d ever felt. Cas’ feathers were awesome; they were like silk and steel at the same time. When  he’d touched Cas’ back the previous night, the sensation had been severely muted in comparison to the full experience. Once Dean started touching, he wasn’t sure how to stop.
They eventually made their way back to the car and drove through the light display. Maybe they should have talked about the case, but Dean didn’t want to ruin the moment. Cas gazed out at the decorations with a look of quiet contentment on his face and Dean reached for the angel’s hand without thinking about it. Cas threaded his fingers through Dean’s without even turning away from the window.
Gabe had always enjoyed sensationalism, and after years dealing with his uncle’s vivacious and often heavily embellished storytelling, Cas had learned to treat most everything he said with a healthy dose of skepticism.
“W-Y-C-H Dean, not witch. It means pliable, it’s named for the characteristic of the wood. But no, to answer your question. I doubt it has anything to do with the coffin wood. It’s not a tree common to this area.” Dean waves his hand to indicate Castiel should continue. “You are not the only one to mistake the name of the tree for something else. More recent lore does associate the tree with actual witches as many of them seem to like these trees as ritualistic sites. The rest of the lore associates them with melancholy and death, especially because the trees are known for unexpectedly dropping branches and injuring the unsuspecting people standing below them.”
Castiel was shaken from his thoughts as the car started to shake. He caught a whiff of smoke and then the car came to a grinding halt. The coven thugs started to curse and Cas tensed, listening carefully to try and figure out what had happened.
“Huh, maybe you’re right. I mean, I figured a lot of Dean’s recent effort was because he felt guilty about something Cas told Mom, but volunteering for a cutesy Christmas event seems bit above and beyond if that were the case.” Charlie nodded eagerly.
Despite only having been in the area for a short time, the witch Sam had wanted to hunt down seemed to have an elaborate set up. It reminded Cas of Baba Yaga stories, which was in no way reassuring. Animal bones hung from the ceiling of what looked to be an old root cellar. A beat-up wooden table was near the center of the room and featured a massive cleaver along with unidentified bloodstains. There was even a large cauldron over a fire pit, bubbling with some sort of mystery liquid that smelled truly terrible. For one insane moment Cas wondered if this was some sort of prank, maybe he’d fallen asleep watching Hocus Pocus and was having some sort of bizarre nightmare. There’s no way a real-life murderous witch would have a setup that looked right out of a Halloween movie, right?
“Yeah man, thanks to you. He should have never gone on a hunt like that, and he absolutely shouldn’t have dragged you along. I’m just glad I was in the area and could get to you in time. We really need to get moving though, let’s see if you can sit up.” Cas drew his eyebrows together and started to sit up before Dean finished talking. Unfortunately, Castiel’s stomach seemed to be a victim of his rapid change in position.
“Yes, Uncle, what does that mean and what exactly is going on here anyway? And why are there feathers everywhere? Wait, do I have wings??” A panicked look crossed over Cas’ face and his wings flapped and he was obviously struggling to regain his balance. Concerned that he’d hurt himself more, Dean helped Cas sit up on the couch.
“Sometime today, bitch!”
Cas pulled out the food as soon as they were in the room, quickly claiming a chair at the small table by the window. Dean happily joined him and dove into the meal with the obviously hungry healer. Dean had always enjoyed food but even he had to admit that Cas could give him a run for his money. Dean watched in awe as Cas’ burger was practically swallowed whole.
“Yeah, okay. Does that mean that Louisa was some sort of witch, and grew the tree there on purpose?” Cas thinks about Dean’s suggestion for a few moments.
“Dean! We could use that plan anytime now!” Dean ran out the back door pulling Sam with him towards the hill. It was steeper than he remembered but he only hesitated for an instant. He threw the lid on the ground in front of him.
Since they got back from the not-Yeti case Dean had been waking up to make Cas coffee, he’d convinced Cas that baking pies was an essential Christmas tradition which resulted in the two of them spending hours watching cooking shows together in an attempt to make the perfect pie, and Dean had even spent time helping Cas order a Christmas gift for Claire online. Just last night Dean had made apple cider for everyone and had been sitting awfully close to Cas while they watched Patrick Stewart in “A Christmas Carol” under the premise of sharing a blanket. Sam had spent the night wishing they would just kiss already because the sexual tension in the bunker was ridiculous, but he had honestly never seen Dean happier. Cas seemed confused but pleased by the change in Dean’s behavior and as a result had thrown himself wholeheartedly into his own Christmas plans.
“We aren’t. Gabriel is transporting us elsewhere while Cas recovers.” Sam made an indignant huff on the other end of the line.
“Hey, I didn’t mean to bother you. I just wanted to tell you Cas texted to say he was on his way here. I thought you’d want to know.” Dean just nodded at the news. Sam looked around and noticed that Dean was going through some of the stuff prior occupants of the bunker had left behind. Sam waved his hand towards the boxes. “Anything interesting?” Dean sighed deeply.
“Thanks again Charlie, we’ll see you later tonight.”
Cas feels a rush of bliss and his grace warms his wings as he feels more feathers push into existence. He leans into the kiss and wraps his free arm around Dean’s neck as the hand cupping Dean’s faces slides up into his hair. Dean opens his mouth and Cas dives in, the sensation of their tongues touching better than anything Cas could have imagined, although Dean’s hands on his bare waist place at a close second. Too quickly, Dean pulls back to breathe and takes a small step back before Cas can drag him back for more.
Sam was impressed with Charlie’s devious but brilliant maneuvering. The chocolate making event was almost entirely couples, and there was only room for two people at most stations. She had managed to get Cas and Dean set up at one table and then set herself and Sam up at a table about two rows back. Charlie had informed Sam that they needed a good vantage point to better access what they were up against for Operation Angel-Impala. Sam could tell that she was entertained by the entire situation, but also honestly invested in Dean’s happiness.
“Not really, I’m going to frame some of them. I’m not sure I have enough for an album, we don’t stop and take pictures all that often,” Sam gave Charlie half of a smile and then spotted something in the distance. “Hey, I think that’s the booth I’m looking for.”
“Dean, I’m so glad you’re okay.” Cas reached up and cradled Dean’s face in his hand. Forgetting all about earlier talk of not escalating their physical relationship, both men found themselves drawing one another closer and sinking into a life-affirming kiss. It was everything Dean could have imagined, and more. The taste of Cas’ was intoxicating, and tingles spread through Dean’s body in the wake of Cas’ tongue running along Dean’s lower lip. Coming up briefly for air, Dean was about to dive in for more when he heard a wolf whistle from the other end of the couch. Cas snapped his head towards the sound and Dean was amused to see the healer turn bright red when he caught sight of Gabe giving them a thumbs up.
“Of course I’ll help your friend Sam, but you’re staying here and contacting Rowena.” Dean kept talking over his brother’s protests. “Not negotiable Sammy. I can tell you were hit over the head; you probably have a concussion. Is there anyone else that can help you? I don’t know how long this will take.”
“Your mom is gone?”
“Uh, hey man. I actually came out to ask you something else, but I think this just got awkward.” Cas took a deep breath already knowing it was Dean standing behind him. Cas’ habit of muttering to himself when anxious had gotten him into trouble on more than one occasion, but never quite as badly as this felt. Sadly, his fervent wish to turn invisible on the spot was being ignored by the universe and he found himself staring into striking green eyes while wondering how he could possibly salvage this situation.
“Crap, that means one of those witches managed to loosen the bindings.” Gabe crowded into the area where Dean could still make out the incorporeal wings that seemed to have sprouted from Cas’ back while Dean had been unconscious. To Dean’s surprise, Gabriel managed to grab one of the wings and started stretching it out.
“Hey, it’s alright. We’ll figure it out, but you gotta calm down and tell me what’s different about the feathers on your back, because besides the fading in and out they look a lot like your arm tattoos.” Cas leaned into Dean’s touch and closed his eyes. Dean continued to stand beside Cas as the strange feathers flickered in and out of existence, giving his companion time to pull himself together.
“Yes, yes. Alright then, no new leads on Lucifer. I was calling to tell you I have some other business to take care of for a bit so, you’ll have to keep an eye out for any news. Get Moose and Squirrel to help. I assume you’re still with them?” Crowley chuckled over the phone, although Castiel wasn’t sure what the demon found amusing.
“Um, okay. Will I have control over this sight, or am I going to be seeing trippy stuff all day?” Castiel snorts.
“That’s easy enough.” Cas didn’t even warn Dean, one moment he’s standing there looking at the angel expectantly, the next he has a faceful of feathers.
“Yeah, jerk. They are tracking your extremely run of the mill, easily blends in, and difficult to notice, car.” Dean could almost admire his brother’s ability to ooze sarcasm from a distance if it wasn’t a slight on Dean’s beautiful classic car.
“You actually haven’t Dean. Said it, I mean. Until right now.”
“There’s something shielding you, but I’m sure the Demon Coven will be interested regardless. They’re always in the market for unusual supernatural creatures.” Cas’ blood ran cold at the mention of the Demon Coven. While all dark magic was tied to the demonic, the Demon Coven dealt directly with Hell. According to Rowena many of them welcomed demonic possession and while Castiel’s Uncle Gabe had told him very little about his parentage, he knew that his mother had been killed by members of that coven when their house had burned down. Cas had been an infant at the time.
“Whoa, warn a guy first! And what about my car?” Gabe ignored the kid’s protests and proceeded towards the house, only to have yet another human point a gun in his face. Gabe didn’t have the patience for this, he wanted to find a nice couch or something for his nephew, and then figure out if the bindings could be redone before Cassie’s Grace used up his human soul. Luckily for the older human, Dean made himself useful before Gabe had decided to handle things himself.
When Cas had woken up after being stabbed by a reaper to find Dean’s concerned and pain-stricken face in front of him – felt Dean’s warm calloused hands cradling his face, well, he hadn’t been able to control his emotions as easily. It didn’t help that Dean had left him on his own only to show up again still acting like he cared. Regaining his grace had did nothing to get his desire for more with Dean under control, despite knowing how unlikely it was that Dean felt the same way. So, why was he even allowing himself to consider the possibility? Cas sighed deeply.
“Hey Cas. I know you’re probably almost here, but I was wondering if I could ask you a favor?”
Comments and kudos are always appreciated!
Cas exited the bathroom wearing only the sweatpants that had been loaned to him, as it seemed pointless to cover up the flickering feathers on his back until Dean had a better look at them. He found Dean pacing the room while anxiously chewing on his lip.
“We shouldn’t waste any time then, at this rate I won’t see you again until Thanksgiving.” Cas leaned forward and kissed the edge of Dean’s jaw.
“Oh yes, I know better than to get in the way of Azazel. He has a reputation for following through with payment when he’s pleased and I just know he’ll be pleased with you.” Castiel grimaced as once again the witch seemed to claw at something on his back. “I do admit that I’m curious about you, but Azazel pays extremely well for curiosities.”
“Cas.” Castiel sighed. It was never easy with Dean. He walked up to the man he loved and placed a hand on his shoulder. Castiel expected Dean to shrug it off but Dean just stilled and stood up to look at the angel.
“Soul ‘buddy’? Really Gabe?” Dean rolled his eyes and then turned his attention back to Cas. “I’m not one for the touchy-feely crap, but thanks for saving my life, Cas. If me staying close helps keep you safe, I don’t have a problem with it.”
“Okay, okay Dean! Calm down, I’ll call Charlie and Bobby, okay? Charlie lives closer so I’ll see if I can crash at her place while I talk to her.”
“I don’t know what is wrong with you, or the woman who contacted you, but I’m just a witch. From what I’ve heard about the head of your coven, your boss won’t be too happy if you bring him a run of the mill supe.” Castiel knew there was no way to convince them to leave him here, but it didn’t mean he’d go with them without at least trying to get away. The man ignored Cas completely as he waved his hand, unlocking the cage.
“No problem. It’s not under the tree though, and you need to be quiet so we don’t wake up Sammy.” Dean grabs Cas’ empty mug and drops the dishes off in the kitchen before coming back to drag Cas down the hall towards the living area.
“Yes, Dean. Rowena seems to think it’s probably tied to the elm and with the other victim also being close to the area I’m inclined to agree with her. Using the tree for the spell may even be enough to draw it to us. If you want to drop me off at the cemetery, I can start preparing everything while you get the ashes.” Dean agrees and grabs his keys.
Dean glances at his watch and notes that it is technically Christmas now.
“I’d like to give you your Christmas present on Christmas Eve. Just us. I know it’s traditional to exchange gift on the actual day but -” Dean cut Cas off before he could continue.
“Hey, hands off! Where’s yours and Sam’s? We can trade.” Dean was tall enough that he easily held the candy out of Charlie’s reach.
“Just call me if you hear anything new about Lucifer.” Castiel continued to glower at the demon.
“What do you mean his soul’s being drained? Is it something the assholes from the Demon Coven did to him? He said he was fine!” Dean moved around Gabe and crouched down by Cassie’s head, surprising the archangel when the kid started petting Cassie’s hair. As soon as Dean touched Cassie, Gabe noticed the soul drain stopped completely.
“Dean, right? Sam’s brother?” The guy who was probably Dean blinked at Gabe in surprise.
“Oh man, you’re right! I’d have to actively resist a magical compulsion, this is more like a ‘this would be nice’ feeling, not something forced on me. Thanks, Cas.” Dean grinned and Cas found himself smiling back.
“Cas picked it up on the way here. He brought lights and tinsel as well. I told him that you had found an old box of ornaments.” Sam looked down into the box that Cas set on the ground. He crouched down and started pulling out the smaller boxes of ornaments so old they probably counted as antiques. “Do you guys want to get the lights on? I can start sorting through this stuff.” Dean nodded, still looking at the tree.
“Damn it, Sam! Pack up your shit, pack up what you need for the spell, and get Charlie to at least find people to go with you. People Sam, not Charlie, experienced fucking hunters or I swear I will make you regret it!”
“Well, well, look who’s all awake and ready to greet the day! You know, at first, I’d thought you and your friend were hunters. You’re not though, are you? You’re something else.” Bizzaro-Poppins’ eyes were seriously disturbing. Cas was sure sanity had left this witch behind a very long time ago.
“Alright Gabriel. Bring the wee one back downstairs to the casting room. Once the spell cast, it will draw him to a compatible soul once he’s within a mile or so of the person. His soul compliment should also feel the effect, and that’s the best chance I can give him.” Gabe scooped up Castiel, continuing to keep a wing in reach so the baby would remain occupied. Once they made their way into Rowena’s casting room, Gabe waited for the witch to finish the set up.
“No. My affinity for healing is rare but not unheard of. Rowena never mentioned anything being unusual about me.”
Gabriel looked more carefully at the small and fragile creature in his arms. He could see the strange melding of soul and grace. He could also tell the baby wouldn’t live for long without help. The soul remnants left behind when the human infant died during birth hadn’t been enough to sustain the child’s new life on its own, and the grace siphoned off from Anna was exhausting itself trying to compensate. Of course, souls weren’t actually necessary for a human body to live but the way the grace and soul had fused together to make something new seemed to suggest both parts were essential.
“Dean, just talk to Meg. We will figure something out. At least promise me you’ll take the Humira every other week. I know it didn’t manage your symptoms well at the lower dose before, but it was still better than letting the RA go untreated.”
Sam fought back the nausea he felt at the idea of having to tell Gabriel that he’d gotten the nephew the man had raised as his son trapped by a murderous witch. He made his fingers dial Cas’ house number and was almost relieved when no one picked up the phone. Sam remembered as he left a message for Gabe to call back when he could that Cas’ uncle was out of town. Cas had mentioned it a few days ago. As guilty as Sam felt at not being able to contact Gabriel, he was also hopeful that Cas would be back safe and sound by the time Sam got a call back.
“I’d enjoy that Dean.” Dean returned Cas’ grin.
“His name is Castiel. Take care of him Gabriel, he deserves to live a full life.” Gabriel nodded and leaned over to kiss Anna on the forehead.
“That would take too long, we were the closest and it took us 2 hours to get here. Fine, I’ll lift the damn hood, you can sure as fuck figure out what’s wrong with it though.” Cas let out a relieved breath as he heard both of the thugs get out of the car after popping the hood. He figured if nothing else he had a chance to gather information.
While Dean planned for family game night, his mind was also mulling over the almost kiss that Sam and Charlie had interrupted. Dean could have sworn that Cas had also been leaning in towards him, but in part of Dean’s mind that just didn’t make sense. The idea that Cas could have actually wanted to kiss him was just too much. While Dean would be happy to kiss Castiel, he’d only rarely known Cas to have shown any interest in kissing anyone. Meg, April, and he vaguely recalled something about Hannah. Even if Cas had wanted to kiss him, did it mean the same thing it would have meant to Dean? Dean himself wouldn’t have been so ready to kiss Castiel not all that long ago, not until he had slowly begun to realize that it was okay for him to want to kiss guys. Well, not really guys so much as his best friend specifically, but he had always ignored it when he had been attracted to guys in the past. Charlie had been the one to call him on it, to mention more than once that Dean was a little bit too knowledgeable about how to flirt with a guy. While Dean hadn’t actually spoken to anyone, seeing Charlie so comfortable in her own sexuality and then seeing Claire falling for Kaia – it had helped. It had helped even more to see that no one he cared about thought twice about Charlie or Claire’s choices in partners.
“Really? You think you’ll still want me around by the spring?” Cas seemed more nervous than Dean thought he should be. Did Cas not see how awesome he was? Heck, Dean was the lucky one in this arrangement – a baker with a GED dating a future doctor.
“Alright. You want me to drop you off at the library?”
“I – I am having difficulty deciding on a present for Dean. I know things he likes but…” Cas wasn’t sure how to phrase his question and looking at his hands in his lap didn’t seem to be providing any inspiration. Sam cleared his throat.
“Sure. You have a plan for blessing of the divine?” Cas smiled at Dean.
“I think I know how to stabilize him. There’s a temporary solution and a long-term solution. Temporarily, you’ll need to subdue his grace as much as possible. It will keep his grace from burning out the human soul. Long-term, he needs to bind his grace to a second soul, and a powerful soul at that.” Gabe took the seat across from Rowena and stared at the baby for a few moments in contemplation.
“Babies apparently need a lot of stuff. I won’t lie to you Red; I may be out of my depth on this one.” Gabe dumped the new supplies on the floor and made his way over the witch.
“My grandmother called it a pie, so it’s a pie. Think of it as a sheet pie if it makes you feel better.” Dean still knew it wasn’t a pie, but out loud he conceded that sheet pie was an acceptable compromise.
“Sam won’t steal it?”
“You won’t hurt me. Angels are warriors of God, and our wings were built to aid us in battle.” To illustrate this, Castiel raises his wings above his body, snapping them out all at once with a sharp ringing sound.
“Alright, we should see what we can learn about those back tattoos and then get you to bed.” Cas blinked sleepily and scooted to the side so Dean would have a better view of his back. “Cas, what happens if we take a picture? I know you said your arm feathers aren’t usually visible to most people.”
“Sam, maybe you should let Dean know you’d be happy for him. If he was with Cas I mean.” Sam looked puzzled.
“I can taste some of it, I think. It reminds me of toothpaste.” Cas half smiled as he ate more.
Once Sam left, all Dean had was the memories of his family to keep him together. He applied for a small business loan and used nostalgia to keep moving forward through the ache of loneliness. He kept telling himself that his family hadn’t abandoned him. Death took his parents, and his brother was an adult now and needed to live his own life. Sam had even tried to get Dean to move with him, and possibly that was another downside of nostalgia – Dean wanted to stay in the place where he grew up. The place where his mother had lived and Dean had, for the briefest of times, felt happy and safe.
“I’ll admit I enjoy being close to you Dean, but I’m also curious as to the nature of our bond. Maybe we can take anything like kissing out of the equation for now, until we get to know each other a little bit better?”
“Can you stop somewhere and pick up a few supplies? I’ll text you the address of the closest store. You still have the credit card we gave you right?” Castiel could here Sam’s smile through the phone.
Castiel was not usually a pessimist. At worst, he thought of himself as a realist, but all things considered, he now found himself locked into a doom and gloom mindset. Really though, he wasn’t exactly prepared to deal with magic binding handcuffs, he hadn’t even known something like that existed. He’d learned on one especially drunken night that Sam could pick locks as he broke into Uncle Gabe’s liquor cabinet. Sadly, it had never occurred to Cas to ask his friend for lessons, he’d just stood there, jaw hanging open, and more impressed than he likely would have been if he’d been sober. Glaring resentfully at the painful cuffs, Cas desperately regretted not having branched out from his more law-abiding hobbies.
“You better find somewhere for everyone to spend the night then. Check out the forecast.” Sam’s eyes widen in mild surprise as he sees the weather app on Charlie’s screen.
“Okay, so you’re saying whatever manifests, if anything, will be at least two steps away from your true form. Will that make them safe to see?” Cas nodded. “Okay. So, if this is mostly about you redirecting your grace, what is the spell for?”
“Sorry, sorry, this is all,” Dean moved his hands to try and encompass the enormity of the feelings building inside of him. “A lot.” Charlie just nodded and slid back to the other side of the table as one of the staff members brought over plates of blueberry French toast goodness. Food, something Dean could focus on. Dean smiled gratefully as the same staff member filled up his coffee mug. For a little while they ate in silence enjoying the rich and syrupy food in peace. Finally, Dean felt like he had a handle on things and decided asking for help wasn’t the worst idea.
“Ah, the perfect boyfriend – free pizza delivery!” Cas raised one eyebrow at Dean’s antics, clearly waiting to be let inside.
“C’mon Dean, we have to hurry. She’s already murdered two people and I left Cas behind! I’ll never forgive myself if she hurts him, we have to go!” Dean dragged his feet as he took in his injured brother’s current state. He was covered in scratches and rapidly forming bruises, and seemed to have a long trail of drying blood originating from his skull.
“You said you only see the projection of my wings? Do you mind if I try something?”
With only 4 days left until Christmas, Dean had decided that going Christmas shopping was another holiday tradition that Cas had yet to experience. Sam had his doubts about this one, he was fairly certain that Dean hadn’t actually been near a mall or shopping plaza this close to the holidays, and possibly didn’t know what he was getting into. In an attempt to avoid disaster, Sam found himself calling Charlie for back-up. If anyone would help him with Operation Angel-Impala (which was the name Charlie quickly gave Sam’s not-really-a-plan), it was the Winchester’s adopted sister.
“What do I do Sam?” Sam looked at Dean, the exasperation clear on his face.
“Dean. Can I touch you with my wings?” Dean’s eyes widen just a bit but he nods his head in agreement. Castiel pulls his wings in and up until he is cradling Dean and they are in a shelter created by his plumage. Dean directs his gaze around the impromptu cocoon and runs his hand lightly over more feathers as they minutely shift in color against a background of darkness.
“I do like the pictures Samantha. Even if you and Charlie were clearly stalking Cas and I with some sort of ulterior motive in mind.” Dean continues to glower at his brother.
“Sammy. I need to do better than that. Cas, well, he’s important. He’s my best friend and I feel like I always, um, take him for granted or something. I want to do something really great for him for our Christmas present thing. But I ain’t got a single damn idea of what.” Sam turned back towards Dean and smiled at him.
“Cas, the binding thing sounds messed up. If not for me, you wouldn’t have lost it in the first place. Let me help, man.” Dean was scowling at Cas now, but Cas matched him glare for glare.
“What’s wrong, Cas?”
“Hey asshole, leave my goddamn angel alone!” Dean knew the shotgun wouldn’t work against the creature but it got his attention, and with the impact to its shoulder and the stake still protruding from its ribcage the monster snarled as it barreled towards Dean. Dean was backed up against the tree as Cas turned on him with a horrified look on his face.
“Are you going to share your thoughts with me, or do I have to guess what’s on your mind.” Dean kissed Cas a few more times before pulling back just enough to answer.
“Well, something happened. How do you feel Cas?” Cas started to shake and make pained noises. “Crap! Cas, are you okay?” Sam crouched down in front of his friend, not sure what to do. Cas held his hand out indicating that he needed a moment so Sam waited anxiously while the angel curled over his stomach breathing heavily. Slowly, Cas seemed to breath more normally until he finally sat up.
“Well, it doesn’t seem to be hurting anything. Let’s just go to sleep, Dean.” Cas scrubbed at his eyelids tiredly.
This is for anyone who has struggled with staying healthy due to money. No one should have to choose between their health and finances, and maybe the best thing we can do is support the people in our live for the time being. I sincerely hope that we make a better way for dealing with healthcare in the near future.
“Call Sam and get him to work on it.” Cas let out an exasperated huff in response to Dean’s delegation of research to his brother.
“Well, you got to pick me. You were just stuck with Dean,” Charlie teased. “Anyway, I’m getting us all tickets to the chocolate making thing. Dean can’t say no if it’s a Christmas gift from me and I kind of want to see this new Christmasy Dean for myself. There’s a restaurant and bar called The Phoenix Emporium; we can meet there.” Sam wrote down the bar’s name and address looking forward to having someone to plot against Cas and Dean with (for their own good, of course).
He noticed Dean shivering despite the blanket draped over him and Castiel found himself giving into another impulse that he wasn’t sure Dean would appreciate. He pulled on the smallest amount of his grace to give some substance to his wings and dropped one of them on top of the man he loved. They were broken and battered, but over the years they had healed enough to fill out a bit. Dean quieted as he felt the weight of the wing, and Cas saw a small smile ripple across his face. The angel would just have to pull his wings back from the physical realm before Dean woke up, but it was worth the grace to keep Dean more comfortable as he slept.
“I’d really like to kiss you right now, and I don’t want to stop kissing you anytime soon.” Dean’s lips are on him as soon as the words leave his mouth. The last coherent thought has for the next while is that Dean does taste like pie, but also, he feels like coming home.
“Well, that cost way more than I was originally intending to spend on Dean, and she won’t have it ready until tomorrow night, but I think it’ll be worth it.” Sam honestly looks excited just for himself, so Charlie just punches his arm and grins.
“Charlie,” Dean whispered. “Do you know what’s up the scavenger hunt?” Charlie gave Dean a confused look.
“Yeah? I’m all ears, sunshine.” Dean’s grin is mischievous as Cas runs a thumb along the bottom of Dean’s lip.
“We already have an angel at the top of the tree Sammy!” Sam started laughing as well as Cas looked at the two of them completely baffled.
“I would like to experience Christmas with people I care for. Sam is teaching me some of your local holiday customs. Will you come help?” Castiel may have resorted to the head tilt Dean always responded to. He was not above ‘fighting dirty’ when it came to Dean’s happiness. Dean gave Cas a genuine smile and pushed him towards the door.
Cas immediately tried to bolt, but the black-eyed man clotheslined the fleeing healer with unnatural speed and strength, just in front of the stairs. Choking, Cas was helpless to resist as the man with normal eyes yanked a hood over his head and started to pull him forward by the magic binding cuffs.
“I’m not doing anything. Cas and I both feel better when we touch, I thought it might help. I’m as boring a human as they come, no witchy powers here dude.” Dean continued to run his fingers through Cassie’s hair and Gabe turned his attention to the ‘boring human’. Dean’s soul was impressive, and Cassie’s weakened soul seemed to be responding to it. Huh, Rowena had said Cas could be stabilized, was that what was going on here?
Sam’s one concern was that Dean still seemed to be careful around Cas when he thought Sam was looking. Maybe Charlie’s advice hadn’t been too far off, maybe Dean just needed to know that his brother was okay with him and Cas being together. Sure, Sam had tried to make that clear before, but Dean seemed particularly oblivious to all things involving feelings and Cas. Sam sat on his bed and looked at the doll he’d had made (well, altered really, there hadn’t been time for a completely custom order) and contemplated how best to approach his brother.
“Dean?” Dean realized that Cas must have said something while he’d been busy staring.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thanks.” Dean didn’t seem embarrassed or awkward for once, just grateful. Cas just nodded and briefly grasped Dean’s shoulder once more. The angel was happy to have offered Dean some small amount of solace. He always treasured the stolen moments when he could be there for Dean, when it felt like Dean was just letting Castiel love and adore him. Softly smiling, Cas also looked at the boxes for a moment.
*Please come when you can.*
Later that night, after grabbing burgers at a drive thru, they poured through the case notes together hoping to find something they had been missing. Dean didn’t even remember falling asleep until he woke up to Cas rolling him onto a pillow and laying a blanket on him. He mumbled a drowsy thank you and sunk into a dreamless slumber.
“Gabe? It’s Cas. I know you’re out of town right now but I’m calling you to say that the Demon Coven is tracking me and it’s possible they have all of the information that was available in my wallet. I’m okay, I’m with Sam’s brother, Dean, and he’s taking me somewhere safe. I don’t know if you remember, but Sam told us he’s a hunter, one of the good ones. Also, I don’t have my phone, I’m calling from Dean’s cell. Please stay safe, Gabe.” Cas ended the call and handed the phone back to Dean.
Thanks for reading. In case you're wondering, Cas' not-pie is actually something my grandmother used to make. It's a crust spread out on a baking pan with sliced peaches on top. The peaches are then covered in cinnamon, sugar, and butter and then baked in the oven. It's amazing and delicious and I refuse to call it anything other than peach pie even though everyone outside my family has informed me it is not pie!
“Okay, okay! Let’s go make not-pie, c’mon.” Dean grabbed Cas’ hand, allowing himself the brief contact with the angel. Dean was suspecting more and more that his feelings for Cas were only growing, but he was doubtful that angels could even fall in love. He’d just have to content himself with the time they spent together. He wanted Cas to be happier here on Earth, to feel like he was supposed to be here. Seeing Cas smile as they worked on slicing peaches together felt like the kind of peace that Dean hadn’t ever had, and had never thought possible.
“And look how they’re all in each other’s space. Anyone else here would assume they are already dating.”
Gritting his teeth, Cas tried to concentrate on Dean once again. With blood in his eyes and the constant barrage of objects hitting his shield and assailing his senses, Castiel could only be grateful that his training with Rowena had taught him to truly block out everything around him when necessary. The panic he felt at Dean’s fading thrum was harder to work around, but urgent need lent power to his healing spell. Cas poured everything he could into the dying man he had come to feel he couldn’t live without, and it still wasn’t enough.
“So instead, you made it look like you were drawing it away from me? Getting yourself killed for me!?” Castiel’s eyes flashed dangerously blue.
“Any other side effects I should worry about?”
Dean thought that Cas was probably in a state of shock. With Gabe’s exit, Cas’ ability to argue with Dean seemed to have left with the annoying archangel. Dean wasn’t sure what to do for Cas at the moment, but he refused to leave him, and not just because Dean was afraid that his wonky angel powers would start to drain Cas’ soul again (and even as someone who hunted supernatural monsters, that seemed like a weird thing to think about).
He was happy to see that Cas looked more relaxed than he’d really ever known him to be. It still bothered him that the angel wasn’t sure he fit in here. Every time Castiel left, Dean worried that he wouldn’t come back. He kept waiting for the day that Cas would realize that he couldn’t possibly be bothered with Dean of all people. All of these Christmas activities were more than worth it if they made Cas happy. Honestly, Dean had started having fun with it himself as well. When he’d worried about Sam having a good Christmas as a kid, Dean had never had time to enjoy any of it for himself. With Cas, though, they were having fun together. If everything kept going well maybe Cas would stay, at least as much as he could. Dean put his hand into his coat pocket to make sure the bee mug Cas had enjoyed was secure. At least he knew one part of Cas’ present was something he’d like.
Even with the almost kiss hanging over Castiel’s thoughts, he was enjoying himself. Dean roared with laughter when Charlie showed him the picture of Sam in reindeer antlers. He suggested that they send it to Crowley as Sam protested that a moose and a reindeer were not the same thing. Dean announced that he had gotten everyone apple cider, and Charlie pulled out the matching Christmas pajamas she had gotten Cas to help her pick out. She quickly guilt-tripped the Winchesters into wearing them. Castiel didn’t argue with her, it felt wonderful to be included. He had even picked out fuzzy Christmas socks for all of them when he had been looped into Charlie’s plan, and gave Dean the one with angels on them. Charlie then proceeded to give both of the brothers the saddest face she could conjure up until they all agreed to sit in window seat together while Charlie propped up her phone to take a picture of them all.
“You can see them?” Dean nodded in affirmation. “They’re magical in nature, no one besides Gabe has noticed them before, and he’s the one who put them on me.”
“Get on with it, Gabriel. Cas deserves to hear about you magically binding him and whatever else you did to him, and I want to know why you think I’m able to help him.” Dean also losing patience with Gabe made Cas feel better somehow.
“Merry Christmas Cas.” They sit contentedly side by side for a few moments longer. Eventually Dean has an idea. He wasn’t sleeping anyway, so maybe he and Cas could exchange gifts privately now, rather than trying to find time to ditch Sam tomorrow.
“Your guess is as good as mine. It’s entirely possible that he will live out his existence as, essentially, a human. He may never find a soul that will allow him to reach his full potential. Do you want me to place the recognition spell on him? I’ll need to do it before you bind his grace.” Gabe nodded, and Rowena got up to gather the ingredients. While she was digging through her storeroom Gabriel crouched down to gaze at the sleeping baby.
“I can still see them, more like shadows the way I’ve seen them before, or outlines of shadows, but maybe that’s just the potion.”
“Hey, Cas. You said you wanted to exchange gifts with just us, right? We could do that now if you wanted.” Dean was somewhat nervous about what Castiel would think of his gift, especially since he’d put so much work into it. Cas’ face lights up at Dean’s suggestion.
“Cas.” Dean’s fingers dance across Cas’ cheek and he finds himself leaning into Dean’s touch. “Okay. I’ll bring the pie.” Cas laughs softly and nods.
“Since when?” Sam pointed out the window.
“Possibly. The other thing these trees are known for is guarding the entrance to Hades, so it may also be a result of an attempt to raise the dead. I cannot be certain as this seems unlike any other necromantic ritual I’ve heard of. I am also uncertain at to the motivation of raising someone who died over two centuries ago, as the more recent dead are usually preferrable to necromancers.”
He frowned at what remained of Anna. He wished he had time to honor her death properly but centuries of experience hiding from heaven had taught him he couldn’t linger here. Azazel would be looking for Anna and the child and his time masquerading as Loki had taught him many ways of remaining below the radar. Continuing to soothe the now sleepy infant, Gabe set the scene. He made a grace-built replica of the baby and placed it by Anna. He used his power to start a fire that he hoped would make it appear like Anna’s dying grace had exploded to anyone who may have been hunting the two escapees. Without a backwards glance Gabe flew off with his new charge to one of his many safe houses. He needed help, and there was one witch who had just as much of a reason to hide from Heaven as little Castiel did.
“Sure, none of us need Charlie’s Christmas PJs, but we’re all wearing them anyway. Look, we got you a few changes of clothing if you ever want them. There’s also a wardrobe we can drag up here if you need more than a few hooks for hanging up stuff. The bookshelf by the desk is mostly empty because Sam and I thought you’d want to move your books from the other room. Also, I know you can research in the library but you can also work in here if mine and Sam’s bickering gets to be too much. Um, anyway, I just want you to feel at home, because this is your home as much as it is ours Cas. You always have a place with us. I really hope it helps you to feel like you belong here with us.” Dean’s face had gone a bit red and he cuts himself off before he becomes too incoherent. He’s still a bit nervous but then Cas’ arms are around him before he even realizes that the angel had moved. Cas’ face is buried in Dean’s neck and after the initial shock wears off Dean returns the embrace.
“Cas… she said she missed her kids. We were standing right there, but she doesn’t even recognize us. She could have stayed, gotten to know us. But she’d rather have a memory.” Dean whispered the words in a raw and halting voice. Castiel knew how hard it was for Dean to express these things and so he pulled his arms tighter around him, feeling the soft flannel of Dean’s shirt underneath his palms. Dean dropped his head into Cas’ neck as if he could hide there from the world.
“Sister, there’s still a chance that you have enough grace left to regenerate. Even if you were to sacrifice what remains, I’m not sure it will be enough to save the kid.”
“Spit it out Feathers.” Cas felt like this was probably not the best idea but it felt like he couldn’t stop now.
He was so absorbed in creating the sigil that he almost didn’t hear the movement behind him in time.
“Then why are we sneaking?”
“I can help if you want, but hey, is there something else? You seem a little out of it.” Castiel was about to tell Sam he was fine, but something stopped him. Maybe he should ask Sam for help.
When Cas entered the room carrying a large box with Dean walking in right behind him smiling Sam was relieved. He sometimes wished Dean could talk to him more easily, but over the years Sam had noticed what his idiot brother hadn’t seen, at least not yet. Castiel was in love with Dean. Sam was also convinced that his brother was in love with the angel but he doubted Dean had figured that out. Neither of them seemed to be aware that the other harbored similar feelings.
It’s off season for the small college town, most of the students having gone home for winter break, so the hunters end up with better than normal accommodations. Dean is more than happy to discover a decent grill-themed restaurant practically in the parking lot of their hotel, and Cas is happy to wait until his companion is content with food before telling him what he’d found during his time in the library. Dean talks ideally about the pie store the server had told him about, wondering if they’ll have time to check it out before they leave. Cas lets Dean talk, he finds himself still grateful that he can have these moments, he truly thought he was going to lose him in the attempt to destroy Amara.
“She thinks Louisa was trying to make her own vampire. Ties of blood are necessary for control and the age of the corpse increases the power of the risen dead in a ritual like this. Rowena said that no one tries this type of thing though, because the amount of power and control needed are astronomical. She said she wouldn’t try it herself, that there are easier ways to get a loyal servant. Then she said something about how maybe Louisa didn’t have the ‘assets’ Rowena had?” Dean broke into laughter and Cas tilted his head in puzzlement. Dean always enjoyed Cas’ air quotes.
“It’s not just finding a soul. The soul needs to balance the child’s grace, and to do that the two souls must be deeply compatible. The soul has to be freely given, the human needs to be willing to share their innermost self. This is something the child will have to accomplish on his own. Until then, his grace must be bound.”
“I dunno what happened, or how they found us. The last thing I remember is a cement block flying at me, then waking up with Cas passed out. He slept pretty soundly after using a bunch of magic yesterday, so I thought maybe he used too much? Shit, he said you can see his tattoos – can you see the wings he’s sprouted?” Gabe had, in fact, noticed that his nephew’s wings were no longer bound, although how the human could see them, he wasn’t sure.
“You know I can’t get enough of you, sunshine. I’m happy to pet you whenever you want.” Cas turned his head and blinked slowly. In the blink of an eye Dean was pulled into Cas’ arms as the wing he’d been stroking wrapped around him. Cas’ lips were soft and sleep-warm as they molded to Dean’s. Melting into the kiss, Dean could feel Cas’ feathers cradling him. He’d never tire of kissing Cas; he’d gone so long without him that Dean would gladly spend the rest of his days in his angel’s embrace.
“We only have one more on the list. Where haven’t we gone yet?” Castiel lifts an eyebrow as Dean pours over the small map of the historic city he’d found in the event booklet.
“I guess… it’s about showing Dean something of my true self. Giving him a part of myself so he knows how much I value him.” Cas seemed to want to say something else but stopped short. Sam honestly thought the whole thing was stupid romantic, and while his brother wasn’t big into talking about feelings, he doubted even Dean could fail to react emotionally to Cas’ present.
“Charlie,” began Castiel sincerely, “I want to say thank you for the Christmas gift.” Charlie practically beamed at Cas.
“Are you kidding, Charlie?” Dean growled. “Obviously, it fucking snowed, we were awake for that part last night!” Charlie continued to look at him expectantly and eventually he caved and hauled himself to the bathroom since, apparently, he didn’t have a choice but to wake up. He was originally just going to splash some water on his face but decided that a shower sounded like a much better way of not being an asshole to everyone for the rest of the day. That and caffeine. As he showered, he allowed himself to fall back into the memory of Castiel’s lips, the surreal feeling of only him and the angel existing as the falling snow muffled all the sound.
Sam runs off before Dean can protest, but he’s back in less than a minute handing Dean a bag. Dean is still viewing Sam suspiciously but he opens the bag anyway. Sam takes a moment to enjoy the surprised but gleeful look on his brother’s face. The doll he pulls out has dark wings, brown hair, blue buttons for eyes, and a trench coat.
“It’s okay to say you want him to be your boyfriend, Dean.”
“Cut that shit out, you’re hurting him.” Dean’s scowl deepened as Gabriel ignored the order.
“Merry Christmas Dean! C’mon an- oh. Oops.” Sam looks like a deer in headlights as he takes in his brother and Cas both staring back at him, with their limbs tangled together and wearing very little in the way of clothing. “Uh, I guess that answers the question of whether or not you’d seen Cas this morning…”
“I can do that. I brought all the ingredients; I didn’t know what’d you’d have at your house.” Dean reluctantly pulled away from Cas to peek in the grocery bag.
Barreling through the forest, Dean knew he didn’t have any weapon that would help him out against a demon. Of course, there was always a Devil’s trap but then he’d have to lure the guys into it. Exorcising a demon was always hit or miss if they couldn’t be restrained, so that would have to be a backup plan. Dean made it back to his parking spot without a solid idea of how to deal with a demon if Cas’ captors were actually possessed. Dean called Sam.
“Okay, so you said the second spell is one you already knew would work. You want to try the first one and see if it works?”
“Oh, hey. We should get a picture. Go stand in front of that Christmas tree over there. Dean, hold up your bar with Cas.” Charlie took longer than Dean though was needed to make sure he and Cas were posing the way she wanted, but he wasn’t going to complain seeing how the whole night had been her idea. Some passerby even took a picture of all four of them together.
“Thanks Cas. Want to hang out by the tree?” Cas grabs his own mug and follows Dean out to the couch they had moved by the tree earlier. There’s one blanket tossed over the arm and Cas drapes it over Dean’s shoulders before sitting down himself. The sit in comfortable silence for a few minutes as Cas gazes at the tree and Dean tries to not gaze at Cas. Dean smiles fondly at his mug as he drains the last of the hot chocolate his maybe more than best friend had made for him. Even when he and Cas had fought over the years, even when he’d felt betrayed by Cas, he’d never failed to try and look after Dean. As much as Dean had been furious at the angel over many times over, he also knew that he didn’t have much ground to stand on. In fact, he sometimes worried that Cas had learned a little bit too much about being a Winchester – most of Cas’ mistakes were made in the attempt to protect those he cared about. Most days Dean still wasn’t sure how he could possibly deserve someone like Castiel in his life. Cas really would have gone with him to what he’d thought was his death only a few months back, just so Dean wouldn’t have had to go alone.
“Alright Charlie. I can do that. I think I have an idea but we may have to explore some of the art tents later.”
“You should give him something that will remind him of you.” Cas looked up at the younger Winchester, startled. He knew Sam wasn’t joking, his voice was deeply serious.
“I think that’s a great idea Dean. You can’t think of anything? I mean, I’ve had a hard time thinking of something too, but I don’t have as much to apologize for.” Sam smirked and Dean was already regretting asking his brother for help.
“That settles it then. Whether we catch up to the Demon Coven or not, we can face whatever comes next together.”
Castiel hadn’t meant to overhear the conversation. He was supposed to be on break, but had volunteered to reset room 5 for the next patient because he knew his friend Alex had been in dire need of a break. Cas was only a volunteer, spending his junior year of college shadowing various medical professionals to get a better idea of what a career in medicine would really be like. When Alex had suggested shadowing one of the doctors she worked with, he’d readily agreed, knowing that his friend spoke highly of both Dr. Barnes and Dr. Fitzgerald.
Cas and Dean were both damp from snow by the time they made it back to The Phoenix Emporium to meet up with Sam and Charlie, who weren’t even there yet. Dean reluctantly dropped Castiel’s hand as they walked in, no longer having an excuse to hold it. Dean wasn’t sure but he thought the angel looked disappointed when Dean pulled his hand away. He wasn’t sure when it had started happening, but Dean was beginning to believe that just maybe there was something more between him and his best friend. He’d spent so long pointedly ignoring his feelings for Cas because he assumed that angels didn’t feel love like humans did – and even if they could feel that, Dean wasn’t anything special. It was already an unexpected gift to just have Castiel in his life, especially considering what a screw up Dean was. His own mother didn’t seem to want to have a real relationship with him.
“I convinced Cas to help me take down a witch that started to gain a local foothold while Rowena’s been gone. She’s killed two people and I was worried she’d kill a lot more before Rowena gets back next week. You know how that type of thing attracts hunters, and by the time they got here Cas, Rowena, and I would become targets as well.” Dean wrenched his arm away from his brother’s grasp in anger.
“Just Clue, Charlie. I thought we could all have family board game night.” Charlie grinned eagerly and Cas glanced down at the board game Dean had under his arm.
“I can do that. I mean, as long as that’s cool with you, Cas.” Cas snuggled in closer to the remarkable man beside him, humming in agreement.
“Uh, just something warm? Would you pick? There are too many choices.” Dean’s eyes ran across the menu board for a few minutes.
True to his word, Cas encouraged touch between the two of them, but didn’t push for anything more. As much as part of Dean wanted to say ‘fuck it’ and finally get a taste of Cas’ lips (and maybe more), he was secretly relieved the more time that passed with their connection proving itself to be nothing more than a pleasant sensation of being at home with the other person. Dean did still feel a distinct desire to be close to Cas, but as the healer pointed out the night before, the impulse to touch was still a choice and could be ignored. Realizing that, Dean didn’t want to ignore it and often found himself holding hands with Cas as he drove.
“Hey, Cas? Before we do that, can I try touching your back?” Cas glanced over his shoulder at the green-eyed man behind him, trying to process the question with his increasingly sleep fuzzed brain.
“Hey man, sorry. You seemed off in your own world there and I wanted to ask if you have a drive thru preference. How do you feel about burgers?” Cas blinked and stared at Dean’s profile for a moment too long before forcing his eyes back to the passing scenery.
“What?”
“Can we try the flat pie one we saw yesterday?”, Cas asked. Dean snorted.
“Blue is my favorite color Cas. Blue, blue, blue.” Cas ignored Dean in favor of pushing his grace into Dean’s bruised head. Dean felt warm and a soothing feeling spread through him. He sighed and then felt the world snap back into place. Cas continued to cradle Dean’s head making sure there wasn’t any other injury he needed to heal. Dean just lay still until Cas looked into his eyes. He was vividly aware of Cas holding his face with one hand and his forearm with the other.
Tomorrow is Christmas Eve, and while Sam was sad to say goodbye to Charlie, he’s extremely grateful for her help over the past few days. Not only did she sneak in more pictures of Dean and Cas than Sam had realized, she had also managed to get quite a few of their whole group. He hadn’t even realized she’d been taking pictures while they played Clue at the inn before they turned in for the night. Honestly, Charlie deserves credit for things going so well between Dean and Cas right now more than Sam. He was impressed that Dean took Cas on a date even if the angel seemed unaware that it had been a date. Either way, Sam thought that if the two of them were ever going to get over themselves and actually use words to communicate, now was the time.
“I’m not saying it’s off the table Dean, and temporary help is extremely appreciated. I just don’t want you to feel forced or pressured into anything more permanent.” Dean continued to stare, but his expression slowly began to soften as he realized that Cas was looking out for him.
“You are very welcome, Castiel. I’m happy you guys had fun!” Sam and Dean also thanked Charlie.
“Your uncle is out of town?”
“He’s… he’s interested? Really?” Dean felt like maybe he was going into shock. He could hear Charlie talking about the way Cas always looked at him, and how the two of them had practically kissed the other night anyway except Sam had to go and be noisy, and how she was really happy for him – but all Dean could focus on was the idea that last night had possibly been a dream after all, a dream come true. Goddamn but that was cliché.
“Oh, I’m not wasting their time. I may not be able to see what you are, but there’s power coming from you, bound up to your back.” Cas knew for a fact that he had unusual markings on his back, but Gabe had told him they were burns from the fire that had taken his mother’s life. Cas had always liked to pretend they were wings, the pattern reminded him of feathers. Cas couldn’t stop the tears from rolling down his face as Bizzaro-Poppins continued to twist and claw, he’d never felt something so painful. He choked out a gasp of relief when she finally pulled her hand away. Regardless of how human he knew himself to be, he also knew that neither Sam or Rowena would be able to help him if the Demon Coven came for him. He needed to find a way out, and soon.
“Do I even want to know, guys?” Dean encouraged Cas to tell Charlie about their cartoon adventures as they walked over to wait in line with Sam.

“No problem. By the way, do you mind if I jump onto your gift a bit? Just to help decorate, nothing fancy.” Dean raised an eyebrow at his brother but then he shrugged.
“Angel scavenger hunt. You’ve already found plenty of angels, Dean.” Dean playfully bumped Cas’ shoulder.
Unfortunately, their lazy explorations of one another are interrupted by the sudden slam of Dean’s door being thrown open.
“Sorry Sam. It appears that they do have some degree of physicality. Hopefully that will be enough for Dean to be able to touch them with the addition of the other spell.” Cas tipped one side of his mouth up in a half smile, obviously pleased that his idea was working out so far. Cas noticed Sam shivering. “We can go inside now, thank you for your help Sam.”
“Why are you looking for dolls, Sam? What does that have to do with talking to Dean?” Sam smiled mysteriously and wiggled his eyebrows at her.
“Crowley.”
“I honestly don’t know what I can tell you guys that I haven’t already told the other cops. I’m sorry she’s dead but Louisa and I were not close. She and I have barely spoken since we were kids. She was friends with some really weird people and did a lot of drugs when we were younger. I’m really not surprised she ended up dead in a cemetery.” Janice was clearly frustrated at her sister’s death and the notoriety it had brought with it. They did manage to find out the names of some of the ‘weird’ friends Louisa hung out with but beyond that she had been more than happy to offer them free access to the Christmas event just to be rid of them.
Dean ignored any further taunts from the demon, and realized it would be better to leave him here than try and banish the fucker back to hell. Even if the human host was still alive, he would just be exchanging a demon for an evil witch willing to sell himself to a demon for power, so really, he’d have nothing to gain by performing an exorcism. The longer he was stuck here the more of a head start Dean would have.
“I’m not sure why the FBI would be interested in something like this.” The older woman sniffed and looked at both Cas and Dean suspiciously. Dean turned on the charm and gave her a warm smile.
They had unexpectedly spent the morning at the morgue. There was another strange death last night, something had eaten the victim’s spleen. They’d only received a call about it because the original victim, Louisa, had also been missing her spleen along with several other organs and most of her blood. If it was the same creature it certainly seemed to enjoy the bloodier organs of the body. The only other thing the victims had in common was proximity to the cemetery. The most recent victim had visited the cemetery the previous day according to her wife.
“Um, well, you mentioned shopping days when we last spoke, and – uh, I was wondering what you could tell me about the human tradition of exchanging gifts?” There was a long pause and then Cas heard Crowley burst into laughter over the phone. Castiel grimaced. No, this had not been a good idea. Castiel was about to just hang up when Crowley’s laughter died down to a light wheezing noise.
“Yeah, sure. Cas and I were going to go check out the stores up on the main street. You guys want to meet back at that bar where we started, in maybe two hours? We can get dinner.” Everyone agreed easily and Dean led Cas over to the volunteer station to get the Angel checklist. Dean was really looking forward to finding more ways to make sure Cas knew he belonged.
“Here, I forgot I brought this for you.” Dean looks expectantly at the angel as Cas looks at the material in his hands.
“You’re welcome, thank you for saving my idiot brother.”
“Mine? I… I don’t actually need to sleep or anything.” Dean smiles at his friend and moves over towards the dresser, opening one of the drawers to show off more of the gift to Cas.
“I – I’m glad I got to see them. They’re fucking awesome Cas, the shadows were badass enough, but wow. If I had known you could manifest them like that, I’d have been begging you to show me for years.” Cas laughed and the tension between them evaporated. Dean got ready in the bathroom and found Cas back in his regular clothing hanging up the phone when he’d finished brushing his teeth.
“What’s wrong with Cas? I thought you said you guys were alright? And when did Gabe get there? It’s unlikely his car is safe right now either.”
“I will talk to her, I swear. It’s just when we had to switch insurance plans the new one says the co-pay for that grade of medicine is $100 a dose. I’m honestly not sure I can make that work Dr. Barnes.”
“I – wow Cas… I see you. Your wings. They’re fucking beautiful.” Castiel hesitates for a moment, but allows the wondering lilt to Dean’s voice to sooth his doubts. He turns slowly to see Dean looking at him as if he’d never seen anything better in his life. This look, more than anything, undoes the knots of worry in the angel’s chest and he smiles broadly and unfurls his wings a bit, stretching them towards the stars. A rush of joy runs through his body as he takes in the awe on Dean’s face and the way he reaches out for Castiel without trepidation. Cas takes his outstretched hand and gently pulls him closer.
“Well, no, but I do have a crazier idea.” Dean knocked over one of the bins and started working the lid off of the top. “Come help already!” Sam and Dean together popped off one of the massive plastic lids just as the door shook with the Yeti’s weight. The thing screeched in rage and pounded harder.
“I, um, I just thought it’d make you smile man.” Dean rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly and Cas decided it was time to change the subject.
“Eugh! No fair Cas!” As gross as the feeling of melted chocolate in his ear was, Dean couldn’t help laughing. Their peppermint bark was in a freezer to help it set faster, although they had been told by one of the volunteers running the event that two bars takes a lot less time than a whole pan. When he looked up at Cas’ self-satisfied grin and chocolate smeared nose Dean dissolved into laughter all over again. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt this good.
“Of course, Dean.” Cas came to a stop beside him and tugged briefly at Dean’s sleeve. “Can I use your phone to call my uncle when you’re finished? I could be traced back to him more easily than Rowena.” Dean nodded his agreement and dialed Sam. Dean was relieved when his brother answered right away.
“Yes. He’s at a convention for his business, but I left a message on his cell. I just hope he checks his messages soon.” Seeing the concern that flashes across the blue-eyed man’s face, Dean can’t resist reaching out a hand to touch Cas’ shoulder. Cas jumps at the contact and his eyes flash bright blue for a second.
“Don’t worry, Dean can keep him in his room.” Dean and Cas both turn somewhat pinker at Sam’s words, but the angel is pleased to notice that Dean doesn’t protest. Cas feels another pulse of grace warm and heal his wings, and he happily shares the box of Scooby-Doo ornaments he found at the store with his friends.
“I’m always up for burgers, whatever you want is fine Dean.”
“Oh?”
“He’s not a Nephilim! Please don’t kill him Gabriel, he wasn’t born this way.” Anna cradled the unusually quiet infant more tightly to her chest. “It was Azazel, he’s had me imprisoned for months. This child is just his latest victim. I’ve seen so many of the children die Gabriel, I need you to help me save at least one.” Some of the fierce warrior Gabriel had once known shone through Anna’s eyes momentarily before she began to gasp in pain once again. Gabriel inwardly sighed, he knew he couldn’t deny Anna her request, Nephilim or not. Anna was one of the few of his siblings he’d related to and she was dying. He wanted to know more about how Anna had ended up imprisoned by a Prince of Hell, and what Azazel was doing experimenting with human children, but he knew Anna’s time was rapidly slipping away.
“You’re my favorite sibling Charlie.”
Fuck, it wouldn’t be difficult to trace Cas back to Rowena. From what Sam had told Dean over the years Rowena managed to keep Cas away from the notice of the hunter community but if the Demon Coven had identified the guy the witch community would know who Rowena’s apprentices were. It was time to get Cas out of here, and fast.
“I don’t suppose there’s enough for a second cup of whatever smells so amazing?” Dean peers over Castiel’s shoulder having long ago stopped complaining about personal space. Cas smiles softly and starts pouring the hot cocoa as Dean notices there are already two mugs out on the counter. Cas then throws extra marshmallows in Dean’s mug, without Dean even having to ask.
“Sorry Cas, Dean means you. Lots of people put an angel decoration at the top of their Christmas trees.” Cas just raised his eyebrow as Dean wiped the corners of his eyes still grinning. Actually, this was giving Sam an idea…
“Thank you, Dean. I will try.” Castiel goes into the bathroom to change and when he emerges, he finds Dean sitting on one of the beds flipping through TV channels. Dean slides over, indicating that Cas should sit down as the TV is only visible from the one bed. Dean complains that the only thing on is a Law & Order marathon because the hotel doesn’t have a streaming service on the TV. Cas doesn’t mind though, sharing the bed to watch television gives him an excuse to watch over Dean as he sleeps without Dean complaining about it. Even nicer is how Dean falls asleep gradually in the middle of an episode and doesn’t seem to notice how he curls into Cas’ side as he does it. Cas smiles and allows his feelings to wash over him again as he thinks about how the softer PJs must be more comfortable for Dean to lay on.
“But Dean,” Sam whined, “I can get to her faster. I found a tracking spell based on her magical signature. Since she cast more than one spell at me, I can trace her.”
“He was born human, died, and was then infused with angelic grace. The angel whose grace was used got him to me and sacrificed herself to save him. He’s not really Nephilim, he’s something new. C’mon, Rowena, help me out here. I stabilized the angelic side, but the human soul is still so fragile. I’m worried the grace will burn it out.” Gabe gave Rowena his best pleading face. He knew she was fond of him and he also knew she had a bit of a soft spot for children (well, except her own son, better to avoid that topic). While the scowl remained on her face, he could see something soften in her eyes. Finally, after several long minutes, she threw her hands up in exasperation and started walking up the stairs to the main floor.
“Hey Cassie, I’m really sorry about this. I need my wing back though; you need to be fully in this plane for all the fanfare.” Gabe ran his fingers roughly through his feathers, finding a loose covert and drawing it into the material plane to give to the baby. “Ready when you are, Red!”
Thanks for reading! Let me know if you're interested in more of this AU as I go through Suptober - I'm thinking about exploring Dean's life with a chronic disease and writing more about Cas trying to get into medical school.
“Of course, I’m rather fond of Sam, I’d hate to see him killed by evil witches.” Dean chuckled in appreciation of Cas’ dry sarcasm.
“Is this for some ill-advised spell? These sound like odd ingredients.” Sam laughed.
Glancing behind Dean, Cas noticed his right wing had wrapped itself around Dean without the angel having been really aware of it. Ever since his wings started to heal Cas found himself wrapping them around Dean more and more. Castiel was still hesitant to share with Dean that he was in love with him, but he was starting to learn new ways to show it. He saw the way Dean relaxed when his wing curled around him. Even though he couldn’t quite feel it, he was somehow sensing their presence.
“Yes, tactile communication for comfort and bonding. The PBS special on primates said it’s called grooming.” At this point Dean is laughing hard enough that he bends over to try and catch his breath.
“Dude, are you actually bouncing?” Castiel responds with his trademark stoicism.
“What?” Sam winced at the harsh tone.
Dean felt bad for the guy as he heaved onto the forest floor, and he grabbed a water bottle from his pack and passed it over when it looked like Cas had stabilized a bit. He was blushing and clearly embarrassed.
Vaguely he registered additional shots and noticed he was running in the direction of the shooter, but the closer he got to the thrumming the more everything else was drowned out. For just a moment, as Castiel saw the man firing shots at the coven thugs, he felt like he could fly. There was a wrenching pain on his back and Cas had a brief view of shocked green eyes as blackness overcame him.
Outside of the nausea, Castiel had felt a strange sensation, a sort of deep vibration in his bones, when he’d been shoved into the coven’s vehicle. While it had dropped in intensity almost immediately, Cas had to wonder if the coven thugs had cast some sort of tracking spell on him. To Castiel’s knowledge those were usually more involved, but he was still a fairly inexperienced witch. It worried him as it would greatly hinder his chances of escape. Still, he hoped he could get free long enough to contact Uncle Gabriel. While Gabe had dodged a lot of Cas’ questions growing up, Cas knew that his uncle loved him and would stop at nothing to recover him. Gabe had always been subtle about using his powers but Cas knew that Rowena wouldn’t have taken in a minor witch like himself if his uncle hadn’t been an accomplished spellcaster. If anyone could rescue Cas it was his Uncle Gabe.
Knowing it would likely kill him, Cas reversed his mental focus inward, tearing through strange bindings he’d never felt before on the way to pulling at his own soul. He’d only known Dean for such a short time, but something intrinsic to his very essence told him that Dean was worth absolutely anything Cas could give him. Maybe, as new and unexplored as it was, love really could break down any barrier. Yanking at the light of his own inner self, Cas noticed even more power deep within him. He tore down every mental wall and poured everything he had into Dean.
“Cas… this is, at best, a very large peach tart. It’s not a pie!” Cas rolled his eyes and continued to add large amounts of butter on top of the sliced peaches.
“It’s yours. I know you’ve been camped out in a different room, but I couldn’t set all this up in there without you noticing.”
“Wait. Just a sec, Cas. Here, I want you to put this on me.” Cas’ eyes widen with surprise and joy, and he thinks that the kissing can wait for just a moment. He takes the chain and pulls the pendant over Dean’s head. Dean pulls his layers away from his neck just enough for Cas to drop the pendant below his undershirt to rest close to Dean’s heart.
Jack would have allowed Cas to remain connected to Heaven, but Cas asked if Jack could help him find a way to live a mortal life with Dean. Jack had been more than happy to help. Using the bond that Dean and Cas had forged from the day that Dean had been pulled from Hell, to their time in Purgatory, from the times they had faced sorrow and death, and through the love that they both felt for so long but kept hidden deep inside, Jack was able to bind their inner selves together. Cas gained a mortal life with Dean, and a closer tie to human feelings and needs. Dean gained the ability to interact with some of Cas’ true form and occasionally glimpse the souls of others. While Cas was delighted to experience humanity without losing his wings, Dean thought he had the better end of the bargain.
“Hmm, well, really long story short – when you were just a human baby you mostly died. Then the Demon Coven shoved some of Anna’s Grace into you and you were alive again, just not enough to survive for long. Anna gave you the rest of her Grace to save your life but angelic Grace can be powered by human souls. Your human soul was too weak to balance out your Grace trying to use it as a power source, so I bound your Grace to keep you alive. You have just enough that it manifested as a healing ability, so Rowena agreed to train you as a witch, since you were human enough to harness power the witchy way rather than unconsciously pulling on your Grace and weakening the binding spell keeping you alive.”
