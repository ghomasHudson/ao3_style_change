“That’s a lovely color,” says John. “How important is all this rubbish, anyways? Forgive me, but it seems like a lot of security for nothing more than a spot of disease research.”
Blank.
She and Sherlock do not look away from each other.
“Doctor Watson.” At last, Mycroft leans over the coffee table, selects a cube of sugar, and allows it to fall, primly, into his cup. “You’re looking…well.”
.  He rolls across the bed to meet his gaze. “I’m not in the mood right now.”
Unthinkingly, Sherlock catches his wrist halfway there. John stares at him. Sherlock’s mind screeches. He wants to justify himself. He is suddenly a child caught with his fingers bleeding because he broke the glass vase that mummy always treasured. The child bursts into tears. It was the fear. The fear made him do it.
John sits back. “Just a memory. Nothing. It’s not important.”
“Here,” he says. “You haven’t eaten in days.”
The rain strengthens. John is breathing hard. He kisses Sherlock’s cheek with startling tenderness, and asks if he’s alright, if it’s any good. Sherlock sighs. It’s fine, it’s perfect; he’s ready. John hoists up his knees and cradles his back carefully in his palms, as though he were made of porcelain. Sherlock wants to mutter something smart, but he’s out of air.
“Nonsense,” continues John, but before Sherlock can intervene there is another knock at the door. This time Sherlock rolls his eyes and gives a terrific sigh as Molly lets in an older man with silver hair and a poorly tailored black suit.
“The whole city, John,” he continues raggedly. “The whole bloody city, before more people can die. It’s already started. They’re going to get everyone out. Three days. Everyone. Even the enemy troops. They have to. They don’t have a choice. We don’t have a choice. Nobody does. There’s no other option.”
John watches him go—what else can he do?—and wonders what test, exactly, he has passed.
“Could you, maybe.” John feels like every word is a bridge, fragile, bending beneath his weight; he cannot, cannot afford to fall. “Tell me about it?”
Empty. Blank.
But John doesn’t. Sherlock’s hands wheel briefly in the air.
John shrugs. He has shut the medical dictionary by this point. “You know, I can cook. I mean, I’m not brilliant for it or anything like that, but it’s usually edible. So if you go out and buy some food, maybe some bread and milk, a few fruits and vegetables, even some eggs or meat if you’re feeling really adventurous, we could have square meals, maybe even three a day.” His voice is warm with hidden laughter, and Sherlock cannot bring himself to resent the quiet joke being made of his lifestyle. “Only if you’re up for it, of course.”
Sherlock, for his part, realizes that he is falling in love.
Adler clears her throat. Sherlock apologizes and continues.
John shakes his head. “I have nowhere better to be.”
John nods. Might as well. Perhaps in that time the right words will come to him and he will be able to define what it is that exists between himself and Sherlock, place a name to the strange bond, the feeling in his chest that is familiar and foreign at the same time. But he doubts it.
They are consumed in flames. Sherlock is vaguely conscious of a deafening roar. Savage heat swirls around them. His mouth runs impossibly dry. The world seems to crumble away beneath their feet. In an instant the entire universe takes on the same dreamlike quality that has tortured Sherlock since the accident.
The warning is replaced by panic that goes unheeded.
“No, you’re right.” John speaks softly, slowly, shaping the spaces between each word into expansive, atomically intimate silences in which he knows their lives can stretch, infinitely separate and yet wound inexorably together. He knows it deeply, wildly and fantastically and utterly, utterly irrationally, such that it is the surest sort of knowing he has ever done. “I suppose we can’t.”
What, then?
“It’s the clinic.” He swallows. “Sherlock, I think you’d better come, too.”
He looks down. Sherlock almost laughs. “Are you jealous?”
He swallows his toast, puts down the paper. Clears his throat.
“Is it, now?”
His eyes open; surely of their own accord, for he cannot imagine how he might have opened them himself. There is an ache at the back of his head; he recognizes little else except for the pain and the unpleasant sharpness of consciousness. Not the starched sheets drawn up to his chin, not the plaster ceiling, not the sterile glow of the hospital room and the chatter of the monitoring machines, nothing. Not even the man who sits in the armchair across from the bed and seems to shed fifty years when he meets his gaze, the creases about the corners of his eyes and his mouth coming undone in an instant.
“You believe me?”
Sherlock looks at him, then, and there is something in his eyes that makes John think it’s starting, it’s starting, god help him, nothing can stop it now.
When John wakes, his hand is not on Sherlock’s hip. That’s the first thing he knows, and then, shifting, blinking the sleep out of his eyes, he thinks for a moment that Sherlock is gone, which is strangely not terrifying. It actually makes a curious sort of sense, feels almost reassuring. Sherlock wouldn’t be the type for a morning cuddle anyway—sad, that, but John will make do. He’s probably off doing research for the case. His old self, then. Everything is fine. Then John shifts awake a little more and realizes that Sherlock is still there, just far away, sitting on the very edge of the bed, naked, sheet around his waist, shoulders hunched, fingers steepled, looking at the wall, or at nothing.
He sighs. “I could take a guess or two.”
“It isn’t anything,” replies the intruder at long last. His gaze flickers to the sleeping girl. “Personal curiosity.”
“You’re thinking,” he observes glassily. “Care to share with the class?”
Death assures him of it, cracking his bony knuckles with a leer.
Sherlock forms the steeple shape with his fingers again. “Perhaps.”
The last thing he registers is that John is not at his side.
“Do relax. Nearly done.”
Sherlock breathes. The rhythm of his thought is returned. He has recovered himself.
And then it comes, the kiss, and he must know, John thinks, he must see, or feel, or know, or
What does he know? Nothing.
The older boy says, “Mummy can’t see you like this.”
“All right, all right.” If Sherlock doesn’t want to talk, he won’t; John lets it go. “You’re an arrogant prick, you know that?”
John touches her forehead and her eyes come open. She is frightened. Her skin is feverish. She seems to gasp for air.
eat, don’t you?”
All this has happened in the space of an instant, but one must keep in mind that there are centuries of tiny observations catalogued in the mind of a genius.
“Why else would I say it?” He shakes his head. “It’s not right, Sherlock. Something about this whole thing isn’t right at all.”
Her eyes are wide and sad as she looks between him and John. She must see it all over John, then—the sand, the sky, the flinching light. John looks at her. Just above her collar, a touch of pink. Shyness. And from the tentative flowering pattern of it, not just any shyness: a crush. On Sherlock? He almost wants to smile. Then again, maybe it’s for someone else and she’s just been thinking about them. Perhaps they texted her something sweet, or maybe even came by, brought her something for lunch, kissed her cheek. But—ah, no. When Sherlock looks at her, the color flares and flutters, all the way up her neck. She must know it’s there; she must be used to it by now. Poor thing.
At one point John remembers his childhood, recalls the quiet days in the countryside, skinning his knees climbing trees with his older sister. He and Sherlock discover that they did not live so far apart as children, but never so much as laid eyes on each other because Sherlock was homeschooled by a governess who spoke the Queen’s English in its purest form, and John went to a public school down a road which became a river of mud after a hard rain. Sherlock’s mother took tea in a white gazebo overlooking a lawn as smooth as green velvet, cool and isolated in her status; John’s mum set the kettle on a rickety wooden table and called her children and husband around, wiping sticky fingers on her own apron and kissing their foreheads one by one.
John stares. The soft light that emanates from the cage reflects into his eyes.
Sherlock sips his tea.
The man looks at him in surprise. “How did you know?”
He sits in the armchair across from the other armchair, surrounded by walls and a smile that is yellow, surrounded by the bullet holes irrevocably embedded in that smile, in its yellowness, and he thinks that he should move out; but still he sits, and stares out the window, and listens, and listens, and listens—to absence, to the non-strains of the violin.
“Because they feel funny,” she whispers, “my fingers and toes.”
Sometimes, Sherlock wakes and John is already gone, but the whisper of eggs frying on the stove is as good as his lips against his ear. Other times John stays and then his lips really are against his ear, his cheek, his forehead, his mouth, whispering without speaking. They ask each other a thousand questions without a single word. Sherlock has fallen in love.
Then it occurs to him and he nearly leaps from his chair in victory, too thrilled to feel strange or question his revelation.
A memory strikes John suddenly: the warehouse. He snorts, and Sherlock’s eyebrows rise.
Sherlock does not. He steeples his fingers and fixes his gaze again on the window.
It’s very late when Mycroft leaves; John hears the click of the door, and then the sound of Sherlock’s footsteps, one by one up the stairs. He’s finished his blog post already and is curled up in their bed reading a mystery. He listens as Sherlock’s footsteps stop. He can imagine the way he pauses outside the door, and wishes with one fervent ache that he wouldn’t hesitate ever again. Still, John waits for him, knowing, now, that he will come. A heartbeat later the door opens. Sherlock steps inside, and—wise man, or at least a little wiser than he was before—sets down the two cups of tea he brought with him on the nightstand. Then, he sits at the end of the bed, his back to John, only a slice of his profile visible, the slender shapes of it turned more tenderly square by the lamplight. John looks up from his book.
“Bloody awful,” he says.
Relief.
He finds himself in front of the glass case that takes up the entire back shelf. “This used to be a pantry, you know,” he comments dryly. John rolls his eyes.
, a cab on a rainy night, handcuffs, falling is just like flying, but really it’s not, because you’re not flying, you’re dead and I’m alone, for three years I’m alone, and yet here you are, right here in front of me, and if it were anybody else I wouldn’t believe it, but it’s you, telling me that the world changes when you sleep, and I’ve said it before  and I’ll said it again: I will never believe you told me a lie.
“You can feel free to order something whenever you like,” offers Sherlock as he settles into his armchair, forming the steeple shape with his fingers. “Anything; it doesn’t matter to me, and I’m sure there are a few acceptable places still open.”
Sherlock pauses.
John smiles and chuckles quietly. “Nothing special.” He shifts, takes his teacup from the arm of the chair, but doesn’t drink. “Just what all doctors think.”
“How so?” asks John, though he has an idea.
Since his release from the hospital, John has dozed at his bedside, waking him every few hours, making him walk a few paces to ensure that his concussion has not taken an unseen toll. Sherlock assumes that the upstairs bedroom goes unused; such is the behavior of married couples, is it not? But John looks stricken when he tries to stand from the bed and Sherlock catches his hand; his pupils dilate and Sherlock can see color rush to his neck. His own breath catches. Has he made a mistake? Impossible; he swallows the pounding of his heart. Impossible.
For his part, John is surprised when he peers out the window and does not see a scar of blood on the sand.
And yet, lying there struggling to breathe, Sherlock thinks that he might not be unhappy even in this unsubstantial reality. John exists. Can he not subsist on John alone?
“Alright.”
Weeks pass like this. The cases blur together. Sometimes Sherlock won’t speak to John, or sometimes he goes out and comes back bleeding, and once he even collapses in the middle of the street because he hasn’t slept in days and he is a person, a human person, after all. John gets a job at the surgery to help pay rent, and it’s fine but it’s not like the Work, stretched by Sherlock always into a proper noun, which is more than a little self-important, but, well, John can’t help but agree. Nothing, it turns out, is quite like the Work. And that’s. Well. That is what it is.
“It couldn’t hurt.”
A long silence during which John feels something deep within him crumple.
“Right, Sherlock,” whispers John, voice still scratching. “Goodnight, then.”
“It’s not your fault, John,” he groans, lurching forwards in the armchair. “Please don’t look at me like that. I can’t stand it. It’s driving me mad. It’s not your fault. You must believe me. I know it sounds strange, arrogant even, but I’m absolutely positive that it’s not your fault. I can’t explain, but it’s not…” He inhales unsteadily. “You simply must believe me when I tell you that it isn’t your fault.”
On his wrists, exhilaration rusts over.
John considers rolling down his sleeves—the curdling bruises, cords of color twisting like a second set of veins on his forearms—but then thinks why not, why not let him see. As if it matters to him anyway.
It is too much. The little boy is whimpering; he can’t even speak. He wouldn’t say anything, anyway. He’s too young to know.
There, blooming from the lines of his palm like a fresh wound. No, no, no.
Sherlock shakes his head from side to side. “I don’t know. It could just be coincidence.” He can hear the raw strain in his own voice. It’s pathetic.
“I had hoped,” murmured Mycroft.
“What is it?” John stares at him fearlessly. “You have to tell me, Sherlock.”
He draws the curtains and the night pours through the window in a thick black flood. Fantastic shadows ricochet from the walls and taunt the fragile lamplight. Sherlock is a pale glimmer against the slice of black glass. He tucks the violin beneath his chin. A deep breath. He arches his wrist so that the bow presses soundlessly into the strings. A pause. He closes his eyes. John waits.
“Ever, John.”
“And when I met you, it was nothing.”
It washes over his skin in gradients, concentrates at his shoulder, his thigh. Above all, it seeks, reaching for color, sucking at trails of it when they curl newly from his hands or the soles of his feet.
He goes to the set of test tubes and plucks one at random. He swirls the liquid inside until it colors a pale blue. He reaches for the nearest pad of paper and jots down a few notes with the pen that Molly left behind. He is acutely aware of John, who for the meantime occupies himself circling the counters and squinting into the miscellaneous petri dishes. But then again, he is acutely aware of most things.
And by now Sherlock knows that it is only a matter of time. He can count by the messages that flood his cellphone. Adler has told his brother. And if Adler has told his brother, it means she is truly afraid. And if Adler will admit to her fear, then the excuse can no longer hold. The dam must crumble and the torrent must be unleashed upon the streets of London.
“Thank you, anyways.”
Mycroft quirks a brow, and John gets the feeling that he is trying to choose between surprise, amusement, and anger that he was bold enough to ask.
Working overtime, John becomes lost in his memory. The clinic is quiet. The windows and hallways are dark except for the emergency lights. The patients lie soundless between the sheets. An injured young man sleeps in every bed. They are a collection of broken legs and arms and ribs and shattered minds and youths. They are torn by the screams of gunfire and the taste of dust and blood and left tattered dying on starched hospital sheets. John feels a sad kinship with them.
“A mother’s love is not a guarantee.” Sherlock is tilting her chin back and forth, examining the blood on her neck. Mottled, there—a tiny strain of gold. But Sherlock looking only at the blood. “Nothing is.”
“This is hubris.”
“It must be so hard to be you.” He settles down beside him. “Nothing ever surprises you. You poor tragic thing. How do you survive?”
“There is little worth understanding.”
“This, however.” He does not try to hide his delight. Finally, what he came here for. “Superb.”
“Stay here when I’m gone.” His voice is smooth. He does not bother to whisper. “Whenever you can get away from the work, that is. Please.”
, John.”
“He did it on purpose, you know.”
, or for anything, god, Sherlock, I’m here for—oh, hell.” He swallows. “Look, Sherlock, it’s like I said, right? I don’t expect…I know you, I mean…we can just—”
John looks down at his hands. Clenches his fist.
John shoos Death away from the sides of the bed with a wave of his hand, a warning just under his breath, with a nurse sent to fluff the pillows, to deliver a fresh dose of morphine. He will do anything to chase away that persistent shadow. Three more cannot die. He will not stand for it. And nor will he stand to see Death enjoying himself to such an extent, lurking at the feet of the bed and toying with the toes of the patient, twisting them back and forth in anticipation, grinning like the crescent moon through the windowpane.
The man nods and shifts one of his hands to Molly’s forearm, rubbing up and down in an effort to soothe her. She sucks on her lower lip; she is the type of girl who quivers with excess self-awareness even when standing completely still.
“The violin.” John looks up at him. “You said you played the violin.”
“To die? Alone? And in pain?”
Cornered. Sherlock is infinitely grateful that John does not understand what he is saying. He hopes he never will. He nods tersely. “I will give you that much.”
“Mycroft? Control? You don’t fucking say.”
Sherlock stares at him for a long moment. His expression is unreadable. Finally he blinks as if snapping from a dream and his upper lip curls. “Don’t be so dramatic.” An outright sneer. “It doesn’t suit you.”
He and Sherlock talk of nothing in particular. Their only goal is to fill the empty night with words, and even if each and every one is meaningless, just the sound of another voice is enough. At some point in the small hours of the morning, in the deep breath just before the dawn, Death grows tired of skirting the feet of the bed and takes up residence at the back of John’s chair, leaning over his shoulder to listen in on their conversation, the lamplight spilling halfway across his face.
John shuts his laptop. “You’re brilliant and you feel things that I can’t understand. But I wish you wouldn’t keep secrets.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Such brilliant comedy, my dear Watson.” He sighs. “Fine. Tomorrow I will fetch some….groceries…and you may have your way with them. But as for tonight, I am afraid you will have to fend for yourself.”
“With all due respect, doctor,” he says, his arm darting out, trying to block John from nestling the boy into the sheets. He is American. “See here, he’s one of the enemy, and what’s more, he can’t be much older than fourteen.”
“Sherlock Holmes,” he sighs. “It seems I will never be able to stop thanking you.”
“My pension is nothing. It’s warm here and there’s food enough and I won’t be shot.” He looks at his hands. “You might be a genius but you haven’t seen the front. You don’t understand. I can’t just return to a comfortable flat and make a good salary again. Staying here is better.”
“Shut up.”
Mycroft nods sadly. “I will see to it straightaway.” He rubs at his temple. “Thank goodness the queen is away on negotiations in the United States. May she stay there until this whole matter is good and sorted.”
Silence.
“They are not. They are—feelings.”
It is the first time they have said it aloud. They both stare into their laps for an indeterminable time. Finally Irene lifts her gaze. She swirls her drink once, twice. Runs her index finger along the rim. But nobody can dawdle forever.
A young man. Nearly old enough to be drafted. Slender with awkward knees and elbows. Pale from the beginning and even more so with sickness. Sad eyes bulging from hollow cheekbones. Average. Dreams about beautiful girls far out of his league, and heroics in battle that were never possible in the first place, and the day when he graduates and can reach out and seize the world in his right fist. Honor student in school, but the war has stripped that future from his fingertips, and now death with strip away any future at all.
His knees crumple.
Sherlock clears his throat.
“And tell the detective inspector he can trust me.”
“Well,” says John. He does hate his flat: little licks of red that claw at his neck before sinking back into the sand. He feels one now in the space below his ear, and Mike’s eyes flicker to it. A yellow blotch of hope appears at his temple: cerebral, friendly.
Placing the photo carefully back on the table, Sherlock turns his attention back to the present.
In an instant, Sherlock is on his feet and looms above John, six feet of infinite capability. He reaches down to offer help. John grasps his hands and together, they pull John to his feet.
“Yes. That - exactly. I um...”
That caught John’s attention.
His trousers had a dark brown stain on the leg. The blotch was streaky as if someone tried to hastily wipe it away, but it hadn’t been treated properly. John was in a hurry, short on time. He had a rushed lunch then. A quick sandwich between patients, but he was distracted and dropped sauce on his trousers. What was distracting him? Not the surgery. He could do the work by rote. John had confided that much in him. The work was fairly dull, an endless parade of perfectly normal maladies: flu, piles, seasonal allergies and the like. Besides, an exotic malady wouldn’t make John’s shoulders creep toward his ears. He’d be telling Sherlock all about it.
The atmosphere in the room changes as the implications of all this new evidence becomes clear.
) his older brother when he’s determined, especially in matters relating to John Watson. Additionally, Mycroft is not a monster, and to the best of his rather expansive knowledge, the baby she is carrying is real and is 50% Watson.
John isn’t sure what to say to that.
Sherlock raises his eyes. “Yes.”
“It would be… selfish. Wouldn’t it? To expect her to… to choose me,” David says. “Here she is, starting a new life with somebody and I just… storm back in. Disturb the balance. A good man would just… step aside. Let her be happy.”
Sherlock scowls at the doctor's bold assumptions.
He doesn’t doubt that; not their cruelty. Not the inhuman pain they’d put him through. The screwdriver may be a lie, or perhaps the fact that anything was inflicted by Nadi was, but it’s a small part of a much bigger puzzle still left to unveil.
but Lestrade cuts him off.
“Where
“Yes.”
“Yes.” John smiles dangerously like a predator. The mutual rutting turns to slow, mind-blowing grinding. “You want this, don’t you? You want me.”
But there’s one photo, and one photo only—that of David Stewart, the POW Sherlock had helped rescue.
—as the last straw, the last dying ember of their marriage finally being put out.
“It’s in Hanwell. She’ll be head nurse.”
“Of course I trust you, John.” Sherlock says, resigned.
“No, thank you.”
“That’s your problem now, Mycroft,” Sherlock says pointedly.
John details the things he has noticed in the past few weeks.
“John, please, you’re reading too much into this,” Sherlock says. “I spent two months with the man thinking he was an abused, suffering prisoner of war. Yes, I may not have divulged everything. It seemed inconsequential at the time but now—”
He closes his eyes in defeat. He takes advantage of the fact that John can’t see his broken face; he allows his lips to twist in pain before he takes a long breath to regroup and brace himself for a thoroughly uncomfortable ride back to London.
“Yes.”
“So?”
It is good. He has this now and it’s enough. It’s more than he ever thought he’d get. They sit silently together for a while, taking comfort in their new intimacy. It’s Christmas Day, he realizes. He looks at his phone, his mind finally available to think about anything else in the world that isn’t Sherlock Holmes. Harry texted back last night, some silly looking photos attached.
“Alright. Thanks.” John says with a small smile.
Sherlock lowers his eyes, deathly quiet, absent-mindedly rubbing a discarded beer label in his right hand, his lips pinched. John's got his answer.
“Oh, yeah.” John clears his throat, the topic suddenly making him inexplicably uncomfortable. “Yeah, a headhunter reached out to her.”
Why is he like this?
John isn’t.
“Any tea left in that cup?” Sherlock’s low baritone travels through the floor straight to his groin. John looks at the half-empty cup, a victim of his wild, distracted stirring.
“And what you told his sister was true?” he asks. “You buried him?”
“Collins says you nearly choked him-”
“Are you catching up on everything you missed?”
"I'm going now," John mumbles, a satisfied smile on his face despite having to rip himself away. "Good night."
John judges himself. He has every right to. He hates himself. He wants to crawl into the ground and stay there. He wants to die.
Sherlock spends the rest of the night watching David and Alison in their bedroom; she falls asleep rather quickly while David stares at the ceiling, unmoving and clutching the duvet nervously.
“Not really. What’s it to you?”
“Or a freedom fighter. We came to their home, they’re coming into ours,” David says. “Terrorists, freedom fighters. Depends on whom you’re asking, innit.”
done anything sensible in your entire life?” John asks loudly and shakes his head. “
“But... he’s a compulsive liar, and a good one at that,” Sherlock says. “It’s hard to deduce anything coherent about a man in his condition, but his talent for lying made him stand out in his RTI training, so much so that it was noted in his  file.”
“You mean my home?”
“Good, now that we’re all settled,” Edwin says, nodding at Mycroft, “let’s get right to it, shall we?”
“I suppose I didn’t.” Sherlock admits.
Perhaps she, being who she really is, is never fully comfortable keeping the same look, never changing. Habits tend to crawl in and reside inside you, and knowing the little he knows about her, he’s sure that by this point, she’s a ball of discomfort over living in the same place, staying attached to one person, looking exactly the same.
are,” Sherlock says haughtily, “but they’re not wrong.”
“Have you ever used any illegal substances?”
“Don’t be absurd—”
Sherlock’s phone rings, and he hurries to answer, seeing that it’s Billy calling. “Yes?” Sherlock says, listening intently. “Where’s he now?”
“What, the war?”
The door slams loudly in his face, the sound reverberating through the old building.
Gabriel’s eyes flinch very very slightly again, then he shakes his head. “Just me.”
John nods.
Morning is here and he would like to get moving. He's thoroughly exposed here and might attract unnecessary attention. He stands up slowly, dusting dirt and sand off his clothes. When he’s fully standing, he takes a minute to look around and survey his surroundings. Behind him is a row of trees, stretched along the road. The view is one which you might see in nearly any other island in the region: green olive trees, grey rocky hills, bright clear sky.
“Hmm?”
he can’t help but deduce.
“I... I’m a teacher now.”
The group roars in laughter, the memory materializing in everyone’s minds. John can’t help but smile to himself; he may have not met Jonathan, but he’d met dozens of soldiers just like him. Young men and women who found themselves as far from home as possible and sometimes, just sometimes, needed to regain their humanity by pissing around.
“As for toxins…” Lestrade clears his throat and concentrates as he reads on. “Yeah, Flunitrazepam. That would explain Nathan’s lack of struggle.”
“Oh?” Gabriel says. “Why not?”
It’s like living in a never ending deja-vu, the sensation grating on his nerves he thinks, when a figure in the street catches his eye. They dart to the left, and his entire head follows, fixating on her like an eagle. It’s a woman, holding up her phone to a passerby while asking for directions (
“What’s whose name?”
“John...” Sherlock begs as the other man fixes his clothes, shaking his head at Sherlock’s words.
“Why did you ask to meet with John?” Sherlock asks coldly, impatient with James’ speech.
They pass the rest of the evening quietly, barely speaking. Eventually, Sherlock wakes Mrs. Hudson up, and they leave for Baker Street.
“Yes, really,” Sherlock says proudly.
“There’s only you, love,” David says, sweeping her gently into her arms. They stand for a while, whispering to each other, the words unintelligible to the microphones.
“I don’t remember being invited at any other time.” Sherlock says while staring out the window, his voice cold.
John is standing by their rental car in the car park, rattled and embarrassed. He just yelled at a grieving, distraught family. Sherlock’s family, no less. They’re terrible but they're still related to Sherlock and John is nothing but an outsider. He had no right.
“What does that mean?”
Sherlock shakes his head, looks at Rosie instead of him as he speaks. “They were angry, after Eurus. They said they didn’t want anything to do with us.”
That's all for now my friends. See you soon!
Sherlock raises a brow when John doesn’t continue.
“Preferably some place none of your people can hear us, and certainly not the Germans.”
His heart expands when Sherlock offers her his arm. He smiles yet again when she takes it.
“Do not make any stops on the way. Don’t let anyone see you. I won’t be able to protect you otherwise,” Mycroft continues. “Am I clear, Dr. Watson?”
“Don’t!” he snarls, swatting John’s hands away.
“It’s a perfectly common practice, Dr. Watson,” Edwin says. “And works like a charm.”
Things move quickly once they reach the Yard.
When it’s only the three of them left in the living room, Sherlock’s mood swings quickly to unrest. No one but John would recognize the signs - the swift transition into the Mind Palace; it is something that usually keeps Sherlock still and unmoving for hours. Right now, however, Sherlock's body is jittery; he's restless. Attempting to solve some emotional difficulty he'll probably never open up to John about.
But it’s not just that, is it? When Rosie’s cheerful voice isn’t heard in this flat, it is a cold and lonely place. Full of ghosts; one specific ghost in particular. Rosie’s breathing sounds travelling through the monitor help him feel like he’s not alone here even when she’s asleep.
“Honestly, what?” He prods when Sherlock doesn’t elaborate. “‘Cause I didn’t. I wasn’t hoping to. Never particularly liked children, really. But then Mary…” He shrugs. “I’m glad for it. She’s beautiful and lovely and every time I look at her I’m happy she’s here, but…”
“Why would you possibly think you can just toss his feelings around like that—”
Sherlock stops moving entirely, looking up at John again. His face difficult to read for a moment, until he nods in agreement.
“No, God no. Not this time.” John says. “It’s about Mary.”
Sherlock’s smile turns into a straight line. “What?”
“This is...
He opens his eyes, transported back to reality. This helped, somehow. The waves of panic receded, his mind clearer.
“Who was notified about it first?”
David looks back, tired and angry. “Because they were cruel.”
“Some in uni. You know, med school pressure. But no one since… no one since James. That was... Off-putting. For a long time.”
Tomorrow could be good. If John would leave him alone for the rest of the night, he’s sure he can come up with something adequate enough by morning. John got his bit of excitement and his mood seems good. Better than Sherlock’s seen him in a while, really.
“You… don’t know.” John says. “So there were only ever…”
“I’m progressing cautiously, very cautiously.” Mycroft says and hands a heap of dossiers to Sherlock. “The first indication about a POW still alive came through an anonymous call to a casework operator. That could be nearly anyone from our wider network - an employee, an asset, someone from GCHQ or even Interpol. Per protocol the report was examined against any information in other agencies - Mossad, CIA, FSD, DGSE etc. They had no similar indications to corroborate it, so it was passed on as a finalized report to our department.”
“Oh, must you?”
With a nod at the man’s blessing, Sherlock loses track of the rest of the conversation as Mycroft and Saul discuss the situation in Crimea, and whatever it is that the Chinese are up to these days. Pacing back and forth across the room, he spends a good deal of time memorizing the details in the dossier; there's no way he'll be able to keep it, given how classified this is. In his preoccupation with the task at hand—cramming the list of dates, names and locations into his Mind Palace—he misses the sound of steps on the stairs and the faint knock on the door.
Mycroft is only two or three steps behind her, his nose buried in his phone. When he raises his eyes he joins his mother in reading the situation, his face inscrutable but for the beginning of a knowing smirk.
"I asked for forgiveness, yes," John says. "I've been working on that with Ella since Mary died. I attended… two anger management courses. One basic, one specific to parents with anger issues. Ella and I are currently working on additional techniques she developed to help me control my anger."
“What if it wasn’t the trauma?” Sherlock finally asks. “What if it’s hereditary?”
John wants to ask him. W
“If you say so.”
“I… you have to remember, they would throw me into a dungeon in order to torture me for days on end,” he says. “I’d… hallucinate. Lose consciousness, in and out. I can’t say my state of mind was very... coherent.”
“O ye, of little faith…” he mocks. “You just wait and see.”
“Oh,” John says, his face scrunching as he blinks with apprehension. “He told you that?”
John struggles to tamper down the feeling of setback. Last night he was allowed to take Sherlock to bed, such as it were, to offer some consolation through small touches. He’s not even greeted this morning.
“I’ve seen you drunk so many times, David, but you never punched anyone, or tried to choke them.” Alison grabs her phone, handing it to David. “Call him. Call Aldridge, and apologize.”
He lies in a bit, thinking about last night's conversation. Sherlock’s moods have been swinging like a pendulum. One moment he’s closed off, another they’re joking about John’s sex life.
“Oh, you know. The news about that soldier that came back. The Royal Marine.” John shakes his head. “Poor bastard.”
“Yes, they have one every year in Combe Hall.” She says. “It’s lovely.”
“I don’t know.” He shrugs. “What was her favourite book growing up?”
Sherlock was spread across the sofa; he hadn't moved from his spot all night. And every other night recently, to be fair.
“Is it far?” John asks.
“It’s right in front of me, John,” Sherlock continues. “I’m missing something, I must be—”
“Of course I’m familiar with it. Every soldier in Afghanistan kew about Musa Qala.” John shakes his head. “It was brutal. They were sent to their deaths.”
“She might be in danger!” Sherlock says.
“Oh, I know doctors!” She giggles. “See you tomorrow at the station, then?”
Can’t be good if Sherlock Holmes is stating something deathly obvious.
“I’ve been letting you in for a while.”
“So is this about not being alone? Because you have very little else in your life? But you’ve had other people in your life. There was Mary.”
The waltz is haunting and unfamiliar; there is something joyous in the melody, but every now and then there’s just a tinge of sadness. It is a song of love and pain, a congratulation and a goodbye; it pulls at John’s heartstrings, a perfect soundtrack for the beating of his traitorous heart. And Sherlock… Sherlock is a wonderful teacher and a beautiful dancer and he smells like sandalwood and freshly-cut Hampstead Heath grass and
SaintScully
“I don’t think so, but—”
, his eyes say.
“Where do you think she’s from?”
“Stop.”
“At home. Baker Street.”
David nods, a pained look on his face.
“A Danish journalist?” Sherlock scans the dossier. “Smells a bit of—”
“I see all those hours watching those hateful Bond films weren’t a waste after all,” Sherlock says, his voice weak but mischievous. “Great idea, John.”
“Does it hurt if I touch them?” Alison whispers, her hand fluttering gently over David’s back.
John's eyes remain glued to the screen even after the video has stopped playing. A few minutes pass without a sound in the flat, other than John's shallow breathing and his eyelashes brushing his skin as he blinks.
“I’m perfectly fine, John.” Sherlock says.
John suddenly hates Thomas, because what Thomas is doing is shamelessly testing the waters. Waters John would rather not be disturbed right now, when they’re all looking at the same mirror and his facial expressions are completely exposed.
Sherlock takes the steps to the flat slowly, one step at a time. By the time he reaches the door, his breath shallow with exertion, he’s cursing his traitorous, weak body. The flat is empty still, luckily.
John and Sherlock were riding back to London, finalizing their (very minimal) plans for Christmas Eve. The mood was comfortable; Sherlock was moved by the sign of life his father gave by squeezing John’s hand.
“Who would do that?” Edwin asks.
It happened rather rarely, but it broadened the mind. A fair alternative. Ian would lock the shop, close the door to the storage room and clear his throat. Then he’d take Sherlock into his warm mouth and slip a finger inside him while staring straight into Sherlock’s soul.
“Because it’s bloody important.”
you—”
Didn’t Sherlock tell him that only a few days ago?
“Yes,” John says weakly, all fight in him gone. “Yes. You’re right.”
Sherlock’s shoulders twitch. What is John implying?
John's breath catches, his heart twisting in pain. “Jesus.”
John has to physically stop himself from scoffing at the sheer incredulity of the thought that those words just came out of Sherlock’s mouth.
“I see,” Gabriel says, his tone even. “I can’t say I’m surprised.”
“First drawer,” Sherlock says, taking another sip as David opens the first drawer, pulling out a vest. John knows him well enough to read the crooked, satisfied smile Sherlock is wearing at the moment.
“I prefer carrots over sticks, myself,” Mrs Norbury says. “Keep out, and I’ll give you something quite valuable in return.”
He needs closure, and he needs it now.
“I choose to enjoy it while I can.”
Sherlock's eyes narrow, sparkling mischievously. “How old were you?
“Does he have any theories?” Sherlock asks.
John expects a scathing remark about how paradise is a fictional location created by idiots to provide comfort and what-not. Sherlock surprises him.
“Yes?”
A salesperson John doesn’t recall seeing before walks in the room, greeting Sherlock and then the Watsons once he spots them.
“I spoke to him last night in Frankfurt,” Mycroft speaks clearly, confidently, though his tone is reserved. “He’s... healthy, if exhausted, which is understandable.”
Sherlock says nothing. He'd hoped John had watched the damn thing so they could just be over with it.
“We’re not going anywhere.” Sherlock declares. “We have a case.”
John barely manages a quiet “Bye” to Greg as he rushes to follow Sherlock.
“Mary—”
“Why would he drug Nathan? The sex was guaranteed given the transaction.” Sherlock asks as he reads the more detailed autopsy report.
Alison looks up at him, eyes wide and glistening.
“Al,” David says, taking another careful step forward. “You have every right to be mad at me. I know I've been impossible, and I know I can't just vanish for a few days like that…”
She smiles shyly and waves, still glued to Sherlock’s neck.
. Not when he
“What?”
“Money?” he says, sparing on the niceties. “Did he say what for?”
“Oh please, Sherlock. I know you pretty well by now. Well enough to know you’re doing it under some misguided notion that I’m emotionally invested in this. Well, I’m not.”
“I have gone to great lengths throughout the years to ensure that you are, to the best of my abilities. I’ve made sacrifices, far too many for my own good. I’ve shot a man. I got on that plane.” Sherlock continues. “So that you could have a home, a child, a loving family. All the things a good man such as yourself deserves.”
“Trust…”
Sherlock tears his eyes away from the body, confused. “What?”
she managed to keep that from us, to hide all that agony and suffering...”
John thinks to himself.
“...Sh’lock?”
“That’s the general idea, yeah,” David says. “Spencer says she’s done remarkable work for veterans. That there’s a lot to learn from her if I’m actually going to do this.”
” John growls as if disgusted by that last word. “When all I needed to do was grab you and-”
Sherlock lowered his eyes.
He hates all of it. He hates the crowds of tourists, he hates the restaurants full of mountain climbers, he hates the fake hippies and peace activists.
“They wanted him to be found.” John finishes the sentence.
“No.” David says solemnly. “No, he didn’t.”
His heart, though?
“Do you know what it is already?”
The early dawn brings with it the first rays of sunlight and sounds of growing traffic from the nearby road.
He thought.
“Yeah, I guess this place hasn’t been used in a long time,” David says, while John hears soft footsteps. “Look at my bags. Maybe I threw some in there.”
And what about William’s… assumptions? He shouldn’t be surprised, really. Everyone assumed that about them. But what if…? William knew Sherlock. He knew his son’s heart, didn’t he? So does that mean…?
“Well, I deserve to know, if my life is in danger, wouldn’t you say?”
“I didn’t imagine him at all.” John says, perplexed. “I didn’t even know he existed two days ago.”
“What sort of training then?”
Sherlock’s face crumbles. “Am I mistaken for wishing to know I've done everything I can to make sure you're happy?”
“I’ll see you at the bolthole in an hour,” Mycroft says, hanging up abruptly.
- and Sherlock sighs (
John doesn’t speak a word. He’s so drunk Sherlock wonders if he even notices he’s there. Sherlock puts John to bed; he never says anything. There is no point. John won’t comprehend his words when he’s drunk and won’t tolerate listening to him when he isn’t.
“Did they…” She looks away in pain. “Did they bury him, at least?”
"Then go make tea in your own house,
“I just got word that your asset was found dead.”
“Nothing,” she says, shaking her head. “You just seem… better.”
John shook his head. "No," He said, rejecting the thought. "Well..." He spoke after a moment, tilting his head to the side slightly as he reconsidered. "No, no." He shook his head again. "You're the most fascinating person I ever met, I'm just not sure I'll be able to keep up with all of this for long," John says and points in the direction of the crime scene.
“Mary... I-I need to tell you…”
As they entered the cabin earlier, David placed a hand on the small of Sherlock’s back, guiding him in. A small gesture, but intimate. Sherlock rarely allowed such a touch without scorn or an uncomfortable twitch, if anyone was daring enough to even attempt it.
"The day I came back, you were furious. She promised she'll get you to forgive me."
“Yeah,” John says. “He needs my help.”
,” John stage-whispers as soon as the street door closes, hoisting the baby on his hip, “was
“Will liked you.” She says with a sad smile, trying to change the atmosphere.
“No, Harry's is February. Mum’s was August.” John pouts now. “Can’t think of anyone...”
“Really?”
He spends the evening being largely ignored by a violin-playing Sherlock. Rosie and John are curled together on the sofa watching a YouTube video.
Sherlock doesn’t respond, the words he just spoke catching even himself by surprise.
“And, er...” John’s eyes are tightly shut as he rubs his left eyebrow. “How long has this been going on behind my back?”
They’ve been weighing the best way to approach Aldridge for days; the man is traumatized, and the information he may have may prove to be nothing but the figments of a mentally scarred man. They ended up agreeing it’s best to send John up Beaconsfield, seeing as it’s quite far from central London, and Sherlock might be needed in case Stewart does something that requires his immediate presence.
“I’m just saying, it’s normal to feel…” John pleads.
“You mentioned that you picked that location to be closer to Sherlock. Have the two of you ever discussed you moving back there?” David asks.
“I need your phone, John, before David can—” Sherlock scowls.
“Yeah,” John says. “Not sure you still can.”
John's morning ritual was rigid and comforting. A glance at the sitting room in search of Sherlock, a yawn and a 'Morning,' a beeline to the kettle for some tea.
The drive is quiet, but for the first time in years, John finally feels it’s the right type of quiet. An expectant one, a comfortable one. They’re riding home knowing - for the first time ever, he supposes - just who and what they are to each other.
“Maybe it’s not him,” Mycroft suggests. “Could it be that somebody’s using his name?”
“Exactly.”
), searching for the source of John’s voice. “Dr. Watson, is that you?”
“You the new Anthea?” John asks, awarded with the same steely stare the driver had to offer. “I’ll just—” he frowns and opens the door.
Sherlock looks at him over a pile of papers and says nothing for a short time.
“Oh, don’t be so hard on yourself.” David smiles back as they stand next to John’s car. “I’m sure you’d give Michael a run for his money. At least you didn’t tell me to take it one day at a time.”
“John.”
“My people, Sherlock?” Mycroft whispers. “You know very well I can’t trust my own people with this. If what you’re saying is true there’s a chance someone from Mossad or even our end planted that information for you to end up there.”
“That’s enough, sir.”
finds a way, thinking ten steps ahead of everyone—couldn’t find a way for them. “So you left,” John murmurs, his lungs devoid of oxygen.
“What are you on about?” she says.
He didn't respond. He never replied to any of Mary's messages ever again. There was no point.
“And what?”
Lestrade clears his throat, apparently sensing they need a fresh start.
“You stuck a screwdriver into his thigh and urinated on the wound,” Sherlock says. “So you’re a religious, adulterous torturer. Scum of the Earth. Can’t be entirely sure anyone will miss you. Besides your family, of course. Do you think your wife and children are still alive?”
Much like John, I grew tired of the vow shtick very quickly.
"Sherlock!"
“So not much to work with, for now.” The DI says and looks between Sherlock and John. “Not until he’s released from observation.”
“She said as much.” Sherlock explains and oh, how John wishes he could have been a fly on the wall for that conversation.
She stands nervously as David follows her in, tightly clutching a bag with his few, meagre belongings, looking around him with wide eyes.
“Oh, my.” Mrs. Hudson whispers, clutching her own cheeks. He
“We’ll be right out!” Elin calls over the sounds of water and infuriating flute music. “I’ve kept the news about your little detour that night to myself, but I won’t do it again.”
“Suppose you’re going to get some sort of commendation, then?” John asks as he watches David gradually turning from tipsy to drunk right in front of his eyes. The grim mood of their earlier conversation has dissipated, and they spend a few moments staring at the telly.
Occasionally, however, they might digress. Sherlock has taken to dropping sly prompts about the war. He has a strange fascination with the macabre. Murders and suicides bring a gleam into his eyes that brightens whenever John mentions a mysterious death or a missing soldier.
Soft, almost silent. Like he’s afraid. Is he afraid? Sherlock looks at him. His eyes say nothing. Blank. Controlled. No, no. Just blank. Right? Then he turns away, faces the window. Hands clasped behind his back. No reaching him. No reaching him? No—no reaching him.
John obligingly fills the plastic cup and hands it to him. Sherlock sips slowly. He feels that so long as the water lasts, John will stay. He has some ten ounces of liquid to make an irreversible confession. Perhaps the most daunting challenge he has ever faces.
“Just tea.” He reaches for his phone. No new cases. Opens the laptop. Nothing. He tugs unhappily at his dressing gown and curls into his chair and waits. John crosses the sitting room. He’s rolled up his sleeves and he smells like soap and his eyes are soft. Sherlock looks away.
John knows that Sherlock plays the violin. But he has never seen it, and he gets the sense that if he has never seen it, it’s because Sherlock doesn’t want him to, and so when he comes home from Tesco one afternoon and there he is, standing by the window, chin tucked bow raised, John wants to throw his hand over his eyes, wants to protect the sudden sacredness that has rooted itself into everything, the armchairs the wallpaper the yellow smile and its bullet holes, but also he doesn’t, he doesn’t, he can’t, couldn’t, not to save his own life maybe not even to save Sherlock’s, because it’s beautiful, it’s so beautiful.
And John does. He does know that.
He hopes, vaguely, to die; won’t do anything about it, though. Never does anything about anything. Not really.
, God forbid. What
And at the simple expression of trust in his face it occurs to Sherlock that he has just asked a man whom he has known for less than a month to believe him out of the goodness of his heart, against all logic and without evidence, and that this man has agreed. He is suddenly breathless; he is both terrified and amazed. John believes him. There is no lie in his face, and he does not say things simply to pacify others, not John. John is honest, and John believes a man such as Sherlock, against all reason, all good sense, against everything. Sherlock swallows his pounding heart. Extraordinary.
John’s shoulders slacken. But then Mycroft looks over his shoulder. His eyes prick, briefly, at John’s shoulder, his leg. The weight of his body pressing into the cane. Or—not pressing, not at all.
John frowns. “What do you know about this?”
John sighs. “Come off it, Sherlock. The clinic is about to close down anyways. I’ll keep that log of her heart rate exactly as you’ve asked. You have my word. You don’t need to hover around here any longer asking personal questions when you don’t really care about the answers.”
“Furnish it.”
The woman giggles behind her hand and the man flushes with anger. His jaw shifts visibly.
“It’s the same,” whispers John. “They’re all the same, all the same…”
But who is this, he wonders, blinking again.
John still does not know his destination, of course. He has hinted and Sherlock has dodged with practiced ease. It is clear that he does not want to explain his reason for haunting the clinic. He will not tell why he obsesses over even the most minute changes in the little girl. Not why his thumb is always at her wrist seeking her pulse. Not why he tracks what she eats and drinks and every syllable that she mumbles in her sleep. Not why he forces John to keep meticulous journals on her progress. But John cannot be bothered to press him. He chooses to accept uncertainty.
“My first mistake.”
Usually John ducks his chin. Usually he braces his palms on Sherlock’s chest, breathes into the hollow of his throat. Usually he melts from his arms –
John tells him to shut up. His shoulder is burning and they’re cornered, he realizes—fuck, at the edge of the rooftop, the step-father about to reach the top of the fire escape, gun in hand. Must be fifteen, twenty feet down. He and Sherlock lock eyes, and it’s really that easy.
He does not know what to do.
He smoothes the hair back from his forehead. A gesture heavy with affection. Sherlock doesn’t know what to do. John’s hand lingers at his cheek and Sherlock bends just a bit, into the bowl of his palm. John’s still smiling, but it’s softer. Hesitant. Sherlock chews on his lower lip. John drops his hand, takes his jaw.
Sherlock cracks a smile. “It’s always obvious to me, I’m afraid.” He chuckles sadly. “How long?”
A certain closeness, violence and joy. Both are like explosions.
Sherlock was shivering. “Come on. We’re almost home.”
Again, John waits. Sherlock absently runs his thumb over John’s knuckles as he pulls at his own lower lip, a new habit, something he does when he’s far away from himself, adrift in thought, emotion, memory. It’s soft and rhythmic, and John is nearly lulled, lost in it, when he speaks again.
John nods. His throat feels thick. “Thank you. I will.”
“Don’t be ridiculous. It’s only natural. It is a bothersome sight for most people, but for you…well.” He shifts and looks out the window. His voice drops. “Do allow me to reiterate. You are so very far from
“I hate this,” he says eventually. “I bloody hate this, more than I’ve ever hated anything.”
Every patient is a memory. Every pale new face, every heartbeat, every shuddering breath, is another glimpse back to the war hospital on the front. John sees a bullet wound and a thousand more surface to his memory. The sun beats down on his head and he tastes dust and blood. He has come to prefer the latter because the dust dries his lips, which are already cracked so much that it hurts him to smile. He sees a shattered rib and hears the abandoned soldier pillowed on the scorching sand crying for water. He feels his own canteen heavy at his belt; he struggles against the hands that hold him back.
Sherlock frowns. “Who said it had to be Chinese?” He shakes his head. “Well, there’s certainly no food in the kitchen here, of that much I can assure you.”
“Honestly Sherlock,” continues Anderson, “you don’t just go dropping the word biological war - ”
Don’t you know that people go out there to die?
“It is under control.”
He is a teenager. But in him still, there is the little boy, a child, really. The boy is trying his best but sometimes he just has to, god, sometimes he just has to. He didn’t want to get caught. He’s usually too smart to get caught. He
Sherlock snorts. “I am never lost in thought, John; I always know my way.” He plants both hands on the desk and leans forwards. The edge of his scarf trails over the paperwork but John does not lift his gaze. “You are a dreadful liar.”
“Right,” says John. “Right. I know. In that case, if you’d just…or I’ll just, we’ll just—Christ. Look, it’s alright. It doesn’t have to be…a big deal. It’s fine, really. Just. It’ll be fine.”
“John,” he says eventually. “John…have you been here all this time?”
He braces himself.
He dawdled on the way back to the flat and it is already late afternoon, almost early evening. The sun slants in through the thin curtains like tarnished brass. Rainclouds boil on the horizon, but for the meantime the sky is pale blue, touched faintly by the sunset. Sherlock hangs his coat in the hall.
In light of this realization, what happens next is infinitely more ironic.
John starts forwards; anger and shame crackle into his expression. “I…well, yes. I’m a doctor. I could hardly just leave you here.” He stares at his hands. “Don’t misunderstand me.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Please; even
John grins. He hopes Mycroft doesn’t know why he’s grinning, if only because it would be nice to know something that Mycroft does not.
The memory shatters with a crackling groan, like breaking glass. The splinters of sound scatter glittering into the dark; they dig into his skin. At first John thinks he has imagined it. The onomatopoeia of snapping from a reverie rings in his ears. Then the groan comes again and he realizes that the little girl is crying out for him. He rushes from the pool of light cast by his desk lamp and crouches in the cool grey shadow that clings to the feet of the infirmary cots. The girl is caught between sleeping and waking and her face is a slip of paper, white and dry in the dim glow of the emergency lights. She cries again. The darkness seems to swallow her voice the moment it struggles from her throat.
“Relax,” mumbles Sherlock. His skin tastes soft and human, like tea and sweat and sleep. John gives a shuddering exhale. He turns and Sherlock can see the questions forming on his lips; he kisses him and tastes the
Ordinary people astound him.
; it was a pain to transpose to the violin, but it’s lovely, soft, the impression of sound, little more. Suitable, all things considered. He imagines the notes flowing from the bow, through the window, winding through the night, sinuous and colorful, ribbons of sound.  The soft clatter of John’s keyboard rises into the air to join them, homey and plodding, unremarkable. It’s a nice symphony.
Not under control. Hubris. God
“Correct. You are so terribly clever.” She folds the paper crisply along the creases and tucks it back into her breast pocket. “Sherlock. What is the meaning of this?”
“You’re not my husband,” he whispers. He wants to bite his tongue. For a moment there is silence. John chuckles cautiously.
“Oh, how noble. You simply must spring to her defense, I suppose, because you fancy that you
“What about it?”
“Nicotine.”
The next day when he materializes at the side of the bed just before dawn, John sets down his clipboard and tells him that perhaps something might be arranged.
He doesn’t want to talk. Usually John doesn’t bother, but today, he persists:
He puts down the violin. John shuts his book. A tacit invitation. Sherlock comes to the sofa. He draws his knees to his chest. Comfortable silence. He and John don’t like words. Too clumsy, unreliable, easily misinterpreted. John gets up to mind the stove and set the table. Chicken, potatoes; Sherlock rolls it around on his plate. Digestion requires sleep, after all.
“Terrible program,” says John at some point.
“Thank you for the tea,” he says.
Blue. It’s blue.
They solve the case and quiet settles over Baker Street. Sherlock takes to lingering at the windowsill and worrying his violin; John reads and blogs. They sit on the sofa for hours with their computers on their laps and their hands wound together. They don’t speak. They don’t need to.
He pauses. Closes his eyes.
, the
For a moment, he thinks he said it too quietly. Then, from the sitting room:
John is going to die, and that’s terrible but not so terrible, and then Sherlock finds him, of course he finds him, and John is not just going to die he is dying, right then and there, dying all over again, he is dying of fear. He wants to scream, don’t come any closer, he wants to scream, please. Please, do not come any closer. Please.
“So do you,” replies John. He isn’t wrong. But Sherlock always only looks exhausted. The frenetic pace of his mind does not allow such luxuries as tiredness. “But I suppose you’re right.”
“Right,” she says at last. “Never showing, never telling.”
There is a smile, and it is yellow, and there are holes—from bullets, holes from bullets, bullet holes. In it. In the smile, in its yellowness. And there is Sherlock, and he is saying:
“Oh, Sherlock!” she wails again. “Thank goodness you’re safe. I came the moment I heard.” She bites down ferociously on her lower lip.
Time goes by. As it does. And then it is a day, a day like any other day; just one of many. John is coming home from the surgery. He works there more and more, these days. Has to pay the bills somehow. He hates it, of course. But it might be a little better than nothing. Might. He hasn’t decided yet, honestly. When he does, well. He thinks he’ll feel a little better, then.
“You obviously do not understand the caliber of work with which my associates and I are entrusted.” He smirks and presses his index finger into a tiny censor just below the knob. “Easily missed by those who do not know where to look.” The door gives a sigh and comes open at the slightest touch.
He does not buy groceries. He does not cook.
“What finally…?”
“You really must listen to me, this time.”
John shudders into an armchair. From the music comes the color and from Sherlock comes the music. Is this data of all possible data somehow insufficient?
John is silent. Sherlock dares to look at him. His expression is unreadable. Sherlock inhales unsteadily.
“Do forgive me for saying so, Ms. Hooper,” he says without looking up from the test tube, “but if the world acted on every
Dawn breaks, and the sunlight is ash, and London is a graveyard. It is a clear day with an icy wind that cuts through the walls. No rain; the air is dry, and the light pale. Each papery ray seems to flutter gradually down to rest and drift on the grey surface of the city, as though it were a pool of water. Neither of them has slept. They roamed London all night. They had nothing to fear. The streets are safe as a mausoleum nowadays, and likewise haunted by the inconstant sense of Death. He leers from alleyways and the cold empty windows of the shops, from the bloodstains on the sidewalk and the piles of sandbags and barbed wire on the street, from every abandoned apartment, but it is only a glimpse of his face. No longer is he constant presence at John’s side, at least not while Sherlock is there.
In the morning they take breakfast together. It is strange, but they do not so much as think to separate. Sherlock has coffee and an orange which he meticulously divides into neat slices and eats slowly. John picks at the watery cafeteria scrambled eggs as he goes over the lab results taken from the new patients the night before. As they feared, and as Sherlock new from the beginning, the charts and numbers are identical to those of the little girl. Beneath the chalky skin of each new patient rages an unmistakable private chaos. John props his head on his hands again. Wanting to distract him, to chase the guilt and terror from his eyes even if only for a little while, and most of all seized by a curiously fervent desire to stay near him, to watch him, make sure he doesn’t do anything rash, even though John is good and rational and Sherlock is psychotic and erratic, Sherlock asks if John would like to see the research lab.
Weeks have passed. He is finally released from his bed and for once John does not seem perplexed by his good mood. He makes bacon for breakfast and Sherlock eats a slice and a half; he looks so pleased that Sherlock wonders if he will kiss him. His heart is still pounding when John leaves the table. He marvels at the blood rushing thick and hot to his fingertips. They spend the day roaming about London. The city has the insubstantial familiarity of a dream.
For her part, Molly nearly dissolves on the spot. She beams and the expression makes her look uncomfortable, like her face is about to part in two.
“You’re a madman, then,” he seethes. “Putting this whole thing on the line just because you want a sodding…” He searches for the word and seems to find no luck. He gives a growl to compensate. “Just imagine the hell it would be if you were reported and something got out! Lestrade will have you when we’re through, Holmes. I’ll see to it myself.”
Sherlock smiles at the familiar grumpy action, but the smile slides quickly off his face as he gets to work. He pulls his phone out of his trouser pocket and fires off a message.
Sherlock flinched violently and wrenched his wrist away. Startled, John searched his friend’s face for some sign as to how to handle the situation. He had no idea what had happened, but it was clear that Sherlock had been greatly affected. Not, that he would ever admit it. John hadn’t the first idea as to how to begin this conversation, but a horrific hypothesis was forming in his mind.
“I’ve been reliably informed that pointing out the failings of others is
"Yours," he growls as his tongue burns a hot trail along John's.
Stephen smiles wickedly.
Sherlock is barely withstanding John’s punishing thrusts. He won’t hold out much longer. A mottled flush peppers his chest, neck, and face a bright red. He is chanting low, almost under his breath.
. It’s an antidote, of sorts, that I take regularly. It’s not exactly commercially available.”
Sherlock slumped defeatedly to sit fully upon the ground. He pulled his knees into his chest until the Belstaff was pulled tight around him like a blanket covering his entire body. The crook of his left elbow itched in a decades old siren call that Sherlock had trained himself to ignore. In this moment, it was almost too powerful to overcome. He needed to get somewhere safe. He needed to get there quickly. He needed to get home. He needed –
John's cock grew impossibly harder in his hand, and Sherlock felt his own balls draw up in his pants. His eyes widened. Was he going to - ?
Lestrade looked like he wanted to evaporate on the spot, but John was struck dumb. A moment later, he was bent in half giggling hysterically. Between wheezes, he was apologizing to Lestrade, but it was clearly difficult to believe he was being sincere when his face was turning purple.
M took it as an apology, but Sherlock knew it was a tear of disgust. He was disgusted with himself. He was repulsed by the man in his lap, and his skin should be crawling at his touch. Caught between repulsion at his body’s responses and mortification at his weakness, he felt a few more frustrated tears fall. He’d known what would happen. What always happened.
“Harry’s in hospital. She drove her car into an embankment this morning.” John shut his eyes and breathed deep. He was angry. “She broke three ribs.” John looked directly at him, and Sherlock shied away from the intensity of that gaze. It was steady and slightly accusatory, as if he was challenging Sherlock to be rude about his sister.
John busies himself fixing their cups while Sherlock surveys the yard. His critical eye sweeps over every last centimeter, and John is sure he's already noticed the garden. He smiles as he hands over the sweetened cup. John leans back in his own chair and stirs milk into his tea.
Mycroft caught up with him halfway to the house and gripped him by the arm. “John.” The tone of his voice made John stop and turn. “He won’t be able to give you the answers you seek.”
"Yes, John. I can actually remember sentences uttered not thirty minutes ago, but we don't have any time to waste. The plan must be put into action as soon as possible and as enjoyable as teatime with the landlady was, it has put us behind schedule. Now, I need you to go see Mycroft. He has the rest of the details. Don't argue. I've had about as much of him as I can stomach today, so you have to be the one to go. After that, meet me back here. We need to orchestrate a meeting with your wife."
Meanwhile, Sherlock is across town doing something extremely stupid. He slides the warehouse door open and walks confidently into the center of the room. His head rotates on a swivel, searching for any signs of movement.
Sherlock frowns in frustration. He seems to know what he wants to say but can’t quite figure out how to actually say it. That’s usually John’s part. It’s why they make such a good team. Greg can’t imagine what could possibly bring Sherlock to him instead of John, but it must be important. He waits patiently, no pressure. Just sits quietly and waits for Sherlock to speak.
He stands in front of the Diogenes Club and pulls his Army-ingrained confidence around him. John hasn’t let richer, taller, stronger men intimidate him since uni, but there is something about this place that cuts right through him. It makes him feel small and vulnerable and lacking. He hates it.
"Mary's herb garden caught my eye. She had a shockingly large variety. Lots of plants no novice gardener would own and any knowledgeable gardener would know not to use in their cooking. Many of the herbs in your yard are poisonous, lethal upon ingestion. When you mentioned the suddenness of your illness and its strange recurrence, it all became clear. What I can’t understand is why now? She's had ample opportunity to poison you for weeks. Why wait?"
Sherlock had known John would love this place. His eyes had lit up when they walked in, and he’d spent the last hour pointing out all the aviation bits and bobs. He’d even told a few stories about his time in Afghanistan. Sherlock would have happily watched him for hours.
Sherlock’s fingers worried the edge of the sheets. Silence stretched between the two men for several minutes before his fingers stopped moving. He drew in a breath, steeling himself, but did not turn to look at John. His reply was quiet and muffled. If John had not been sitting so close, he would not have heard it.
Whatever Mycroft read from his face seemed to convince the man. He gestured for John to sit in the chair near the bed while he stood nearby, looking down at his brother.
Sherlock wanted desperately to believe him.
John scoops two bowls and three mugs into the kitchen sink. Nine years on and he still hasn’t got Sherlock on a bloody acceptable feeding schedule, the git. John loves his small, unconventional, ridiculous family. Rosie had been so excited leaving the house this morning. John smiles at the memory…
Sherlock leaned against an industrial-looking building and surveyed the scene in front of him. It was a French restaurant with a large picture window that allowed him to take in the detail of the place, even from his position across the street. The restaurant had been designed to feel homey and seat as many as possible at the same time. Sherlock could tell it usually had dozens and dozens of tables (mostly for two) arranged in neat rows.
He had expected Sherlock to draw his legs up and leave room for him at the end of the sofa. However, the man sat up and motioned for John to sit next to him.
Sherlock nods tersely, taking the explanation without comment.
"Okay. I just need to grab some clothes, and we'll go."
"Oh my god. She binned all the coffee. Said she wanted us to try again. She said that eating healthier would be better for a baby. I didn’t even question it. Jesus!"
"I heard that
“I explained earlier about the effects of Hypno. I told you I had personal knowledge.” Sherlock swallowed, knowing that he was about to venture into unknown territory. He was going to tell John, and he had no way to know how the man would react.
Sherlock chuckles and rubs up and down John’s back.
“I wish you wouldn’t,” John said with a sigh.
A white-tiled bathroom filled his vision. A grand pedestal sink was center-frame while the entire far wall was adorned with the steady flow of a waterfall shower. Steam was curling lightly off the streaming current, fogging over the mirror. But none of that held John’s fascination the way the fully-clothed solitary figure crouching in the corner did. Sherlock’s halo of dark curls grew damp and stuck to the man’s forehead, but he paid them no mind. He remained motionless in his cramped position.
"The days with tea and the days with experiments. Every single one was a mystery and a blessing."
“Yes. You should rest.”
convinced me to go back to her. Was that all part of some plan to keep her complacent while you figured her out? Am I just some convenient pawn you’re not afraid to sacrifice so long as you get to take the queen in the end?"
This time the accusation is intentional.
Finally, Sherlock makes it to the checkout. It takes the teenager behind the counter three tries to give him correct change. Sherlock is so grateful by the end of the ordeal that he simply takes it and leaves without reply. He hails a cab and breathes a sigh of relief to have done something right, something helpful. At least he hopes it will be.
Knowing that M would insist, Sherlock undid the button of his suit jacket before resettling into his chair. The table was pristine. Only the butter knife was askew, but there weren’t any menus. Sherlock took a sip from his water glass while M rejoined him.
“No, Sherlock. I get that there are things about this that I don’t understand. There may even be parts of it that I can’t understand, but it doesn’t change my decision.”
“I know,” Greg replied. “He’s the best there is. Why do you think I put up with all the other nonsense?” he said jovially. “I’ve got to go but have him text me if he finds anything.”
Mrs. Hudson's face darkens and Sherlock stops fidgeting immediately. He stands perfectly still, drawn up to his full height. He has picked up a few habits from his time with John. Apparently, standing at military attention in anticipation of battle is one of them.
sort of way. He is roguishly handsome and charming in a way that Sherlock is not. There’s a truth beneath it that Sherlock can never quite muster. He tries anyway. He straightens his shoulders and offers his hand.
Sherlock picked up one of the slides in front of him and turned it over repeatedly in his hand. John wasn’t used to this much self-conscious reflection on Sherlock’s part. He was usually forthcoming with information relating to a case, unless he was on the trail of the solution and too busy to be bothered spelling it out. This was different. This was a calm assessment of the facts, as if Sherlock was deciding what to tell John and what to hold back. It unnerved him.
“You’ve left behind the street thug persona, I see,” Sherlock said. He sounded detached, almost bored. That was good. M needn’t know his pulse was thudding in his throat.
“That’ll be Molly. She’s watching Rosie tonight.”
“Or – “
Sherlock's whole body sways toward the plate and his nostrils flare as he tries to determine the biscuit type by scent alone. Mrs. Hudson pats his cheek and heads for the kitchen.
Sherlock nodded in frustration.
“Sherlock, I swear to God, if you are just winding me up!”
He was preparing to call for Lisbeth when his mobile vibrated and chirped with an incoming text message from an unlisted number:
“Then how is he behind these deaths? They’re recent, committed long after he died.”
Sherlock suddenly understood.
But Sherlock is already shaking his head.
Sherlock fiddles with the saucer. The porcelain clatters and he draws his hands back quickly. He shoots John an apologetic glance before resuming his stare at the still-gloved hands he now has bundled in his lap. The uncertain feeling claws its way through John's stomach again. The timidity radiating from his friend is so out of place that John hardly knows what to do. He rests his arm, palm up, on the table and softly clears his throat.
Instead of drawing attention to John’s momentary lapse, he stands.
They bicker as they make their way inside. A sweeping spiral staircase fills the entryway. The wrought iron railing tugs at John’s memory. He closes his eyes and concentrates hard, trying his best to remember.
He held up a hand to keep John from interrupting. He didn’t need John to argue with him. Honestly, he needed John to keep quiet, or he’d never get the words out.
“Tell me how you’re feeling?” he asked, fondness suffusing his tone.
The sounds of Mrs. Hudson greeting Molly can be heard through the open door.
Sherlock swallowed and said nothing, but John could feel his doubt. He readjusted his position so that his lower back was settled more comfortably against the unyielding tile and cleared his throat. This time, he waited for Sherlock to look up. He had things that needed saying, and he’d put them off far too long. He had no way of knowing how they would be received, but he needed to know that Sherlock heard and understood,
Mary’s smile might more properly be called a snarl as she bears her teeth.
John’s eyebrows draw down in confusion.
“How long has it been?” he asked.
"Chocolate raspberry."
Greg just shakes his head, entirely unsure of what Sherlock is trying to say.
“Hey,” John called softly.
[TEXT] c u soon
Stephen’s voice, American accent and all, rings loud in the room as the open door of the wardrobe catches John’s eye. He goes dizzy with arousal at the sight of his naked body stretched between the two most beautiful men he has ever met reflected in the full-length mirror.
Sherlock’s body was rigid with tension and fine lines were carving their paths around his eyes. He quickly pressed the lock button, and his phone fell dark. Although the harsh light was gone, Sherlock felt exposed under John’s scrutiny. The happiness had gone out of the air. Now there was a vast void between them that John could not cross. Sherlock was already mentally drifting, going where John could not follow.
Ten minutes later, John trotted down the stairs to find Sherlock standing at the stove. As he entered the kitchen, he saw that Sherlock was flipping bacon in the frying pan while four thick slices of bread and two mugs of tea sat waiting on the side. His stomach gave a grumble of anticipation, and Sherlock chuckled.
Sherlock’s stomach gave a lurch and he felt an unfamiliar sinking feeling. Someday, he would be wrong. It was just the balance of probability. What would John do then, when Sherlock had failed him? Would that steely look fade to a bland politeness? John certainly wouldn’t speak with the same certainty in his voice. Would he leave? Unimaginable.
A woman in her thirties. She came from work, and soon her husband and two children join her in the clinic. She runs her hands through their hair one by one. They are pretty things, like little china dolls, cheeks airbrushed with rose paint and eyes of blue enamel.  They smile at their mother. They do not understand. Even Sherlock must look away, but John has no choice; he greets the little girl and boy with a smile. As all doctors must do, he offers them each his hand, a piece of candy. Sad restitution for the loss of their mother. But they cannot know that.
And with that, the fluidity is gone. His eyes glitter again. Curiosity. The buzzing buzzing buzzing of wanting to know more, more, impossibly much. It must be so maddening. Never resting. Thinking. Thinking. The desperate pursuit of thought paused for a few moments between the frosty chords.
Still, he’s not surprised that Mike beams. He knows that seeing the colors is not the same as understanding them.
He does not look at John, and in that absence of gaze John senses a secret being kept from them both. Lestrade has returned, and he is yelling and Sherlock is snapping at him and yet the world is crumpling into a single intimacy the parts of which are Sherlock John and no one else because Sherlock spoke quietly not because he cares about protecting anyone’s secrets—quite the opposite, the joy of his life is rooted in exposure—so why?
But Sherlock only sneers.
Strange. One morning, John gets up, pulls on his robe, and shuffles into the kitchen. It isn’t until he’s finished putting on the kettle that he really understands that Sherlock is sitting at the kitchen table surrounded by all the apparati one needs to draw blood—the slender needle perched smugly in his chalky hand—and also a cup of tea. John blinks.
“Quite a handsome date you’ve got there,” he grins. Sherlock sighs. John laughs uncomfortably and shakes his head.
Perhaps it is because John is familiar and sharply defined; perhaps it is because the Sherlock lost in the gloom of his memory is fighting back into his consciousness. Perhaps it is because John spells his heart in boldface whether he means to or not; perhaps it is merely because John is there. Regardless, Sherlock lies awake at night tracing shapes over the strong lines of his back; he marvels at the sharp angles of his shoulder blades, the powerful curves of his hips, the gentle slope of his stomach. He listens intently to the rhythm of his breathing and thinks what luck that he married such an intriguing man.
The thought slammed through him like an icy chill. The fact that he was even considering leaving John behind was abhorrent. It was the repulsion more than anything that had him sliding into the back of a cab without another word.
after all this time. They’re in the panting breaths of two broken men starting to heal, working together to fix each other at last.
“You did this. I know you did. But, how did you? Why?”
John sets his half-empty glass down on the side table and leans forward, elbows resting on his knees. He has a predatory gleam in his eyes as he sizes Stephen up.
Terror slammed through John. Sherlock had been poisoned god knew how long ago, and he had been treating himself with a homemade remedy?
John leans over to kiss Sherlock’s temple as he passes by to fill the kettle. Sherlock shifts, subconsciously leaning into the scent of home-safe-
Sherlock takes the papers and flips toward the back. He stops on a page with the words
“Why are you here?”
John says nothing but tightens his grip on the gun. Sherlock’s stomach flips, clearly John did think his marriage to Mary meant something. He steps forward to intervene, but Mary refocuses the gun on him. She knows that threatening Sherlock works even better than pointing the gun at John himself.
“And you and John, how’s that going then? You three still making it work over at Baker Street?”
Sherlock can hear sporadic wheezing until the rush of water against porcelain drowns out all other sounds. Sherlock slips into his room as the tub fills and pulls a small, plastic storage box out from underneath his bed. He actually spent time picking this box personally. He wanted to be sure it would seal and protect the items inside from dust, water, chemicals, everything. He pulls off the lid with a
When he was finally finished, he turned and must have read the frustration on John's face because he simply started down the hall on the right.
Thirty Day Challenge: Day 4 - Kisses
Sherlock thunders up the stairs, startling Rosie into tears. Turning the corner into the sitting room, Sherlock scoops her up off the floor where she had been doing her homework. He plants a kiss on her head and twirls her around.
John joins them in the sitting room twenty minutes later. Sherlock looks up with hungry eyes as John enters. He is wearing the deep blue cashmere jumper Sherlock bought him for his birthday.
The bureaucrat's voice was mostly unchanged, but John detected a note of desperation bleeding through. The realization that Mycroft was almost pleading with him stayed his hand for the time being.
“There will be if you do not get over here and kiss me.”
He helped Sherlock settle comfortably onto the sofa and laid a heavy afghan over him to ensure he wouldn’t be cold. John briefly ducked into the kitchen to fill a glass of water and grab an apple from the fruit bowl on the counter. He knew Sherlock was unlikely to eat it, but it was a healthy, easy snack that would appeal to the man’s insatiable sweet tooth.
John grips Sherlock’s hand and pats the bed.
Mycroft can hear the sound of his little brother retching through the door. He presses his palm flat against the door and holds silent vigil until the violent sick noises stop. He waits another thirty seconds, but when Sherlock shows no sign of coming out, he tries the door handle, which is locked - of course.
Sherlock’s head whipped around as the back of M’s hand connected with his cheek. “Did I tell you that you could touch?” His cheek stung with the echo of M’s slap.
Sherlock can’t find an answer that makes sense. He shuts his eyes and breathes deeply until he is no longer on the edge of hyperventilating. He presses play.
Sherlock doesn’t realize he is pleading in Serbian. Mycroft doesn't move, speaking gently.
M moaned appreciatively, and Sherlock felt a bolt of arousal shoot down his spine. There was sweat beading along his hairline, and his shirt felt tacky against his chest. He chewed, savoring the taste. M watched Sherlock’s Adam’s apple bob as he swallowed. M continued to feed him bits of pasta from his own plate, alternating bites for himself and Sherlock.
Then, he turned to glare at Sherlock. “Of course you know about my plans, never mind the fact that even I’d forgotten. You could have reminded me, you know.” John’s tone was accusatory but there was no heat in it.
“You kept it? You kept all this?”
"Okay. You didn’t know. But you figured something out. That’s why you were so intent on making me leave. You figured something out yesterday."
John’s eyes filled but no tears fell. He had no idea if Sherlock would want the same from him, but he could not remember ever feeling this free.
“Molly, I – You, of course, were the logical choice, but I did not think it wise to ask this of you. I know I have made many mistakes over the course of our acquaintance, but I truly did think this would be the height of cruelty. I promised after
“Sherlock, dear, mind the door! It’s nice to hear you humming again. It’s been ages. Anyway, I’m just popping to the shops. Shouldn’t be long.”
John doesn't say that. He knows Sherlock is talking about the conversation with Mycroft, so he squares his shoulders and answers directly.
He kisses the cold tip of Sherlock's nose.
John's voice is oddly compatible with the day, all soft lavender and downy clouds. Sherlock sucks in breath and forces himself to look up.
“Yes, well. Good. Anyway, remember how I told you about the man who looked like you? The American?"
The only indication that this room was meant to be slept in was a single bed shoved aside and wedged in the corner furthest from the lab equipment. Balled up paper littered the floor along with chewed up biros and discarded tomes. A single frayed robe hung on a solitary hook near the door, a level of care not afforded to the chaos covering the rest of the room.
“No? Tell me then. What was the attraction?”
Sherlock showers, dresses, and sits down at his microscope. The paraffin samples he prepared last week are finally ready for analysis. He is so engrossed in what he is doing, that it is just after noon when he remembers the biology book. Pushing aside the samples, he grabs the text and jogs down the stairs.
“It’s more than just an act though,” Sherlock continued. M was wearing a tight, tailored dark navy suit jacket over a black collar shirt and matching silk tie. That lot wouldn’t come cheap.
John kisses Sherlock's forehead.
Well that’s one of Greg’s questions answered at least. Runner up to John is not so shabby a position, he supposes. Sherlock’s tone softens so suddenly, that Greg has to lean forward to catch his next words.
“I want that with you, John. I just – I can’t…” he swallowed and his eyes widened in panic. “I’m not…good. There are things I don’t know how to give you. What I mean is that you deserve so much better than what I am.”
Sherlock, surprised and a little jealous, takes another slow sip of wine. If John wants to have sex with Stephen then Sherlock is going to sit here and watch. Let them be uncomfortable. They are in his home after all. Writhing and humping and kissing on his sofa. John is sucking Stephen’s tongue into his mouth and moaning wantonly in Sherlock’s sitting room. He could probably hear the friction of their trouser zippers rubbing together from his kitchen.
“Well, good thing he’s got a doctor then.”
John peels himself off the bathroom door and closes the space between them. His hands run up Sherlock’s chest, neck, chin to cup his cheeks.
Sherlock stops the door just in time. Ah, it was him humming in the streets. Interesting. He smiles apologetically.
We have the code words for a reason, Sherlock. Use them, won't you?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Mary looks pensively at the gun she is twirling around in her hand.
"John would never forgive you!"
“And experiments!”
Stephen downs the rest of the wine in one go.
Mycroft spins on his heels and leaves with a small parting nod directed at John.
M licked a line just under his jaw and quivered with pleasure at his cry. His cock grew harder in Sherlock’s hand, and he knew the man was close. He wished he could look away, but M would not allow it. His body screamed at him to grab and grind and come, but he couldn’t move. His eyes were still fixed on M, whose own eyes were fluttering with pleasure.
Sherlock's face breaks into one of his rare, genuine smiles. The kind that twitches the corner of his lips but really shines from his eyes. The tension leeches from his frame slowly and his back curves softly as he breathes out.
John wanted to take the words back, but another part of him hoped Sherlock would answer. He wanted to understand one more small piece of the man he shared his life with.
Lestrade had called about a new case precisely thirty-seven minutes ago. It sounded like a promising case too. At least a seven…seven-point-five if his suspicions about the dismemberment happened to be correct. Sherlock had listened just long enough to hear Lestrade say
John squeezed his eyes shut. “How many?”
"But he's alive?"
"John?"
Rosie sniffled so softly that only Sherlock could hear it and raised her mouth to his ear.
Greg chimed in. “We haven’t been getting anywhere with Monahan. He’ll give us plenty of tangential evidence. He doesn’t seem to mind implicating himself but trying to get any information on his supplier is a non-starter. We’re running out of leads.” He shrugged apologetically.
He tried to clamp down on the inkling before it bloomed into a full-blown thought, but something must have shown on his face. He felt the atmosphere change and immediately regretted it. He wanted the lightness of their afternoon back. He didn’t want to dwell on what had happened. He didn’t want to remember…
The warning that had been picking away at the back of his mind all night snapped into clear focus. He knew things had been off with Sherlock lately. He didn’t know the exact cause, but he knew it was unusual for him to find the detective in the throes of a panic attack on the dank ground of an alleyway in Brixton.
genius – had been…had not
Sherlock’s blood runs cold as he hears the quiet snick of a window rising. He rushes to keep Mary’s focus. He is going to bloody kill Mycroft. Why couldn’t he just keep John busy for an hour?
Sherlock stops pacing at the discouraged look on John's face.
"So…"
John just breathes heavily and refuses to rise to the bait. Mycroft waits, but John can hear his team working in the background.
“Rosie, I’m sorry I didn’t bring it earlier…”
“No.”
The door snapped shut just as he was settling into the fine leather seat. John was already gathering his plan of attack against Anthea. Surely, this time, he would be able to get some information out of her before he arrived in an abandoned car park or nuclear power plant.
It comes out a little rough. He clears his throat and tries again.
“Stay here. Relax. I’ll call when it’s ready?”
“Can’t wait.”
Sherlock strolls through the crowds passing down the busy street. Apparently, strolling is something he does now. The thought makes him chuckle. He turns the corner and speeds his pace. A few more blocks and he’ll be home. Every few seconds, a passerby turns to stare at him. That’s odd. He does get recognized occasionally but this seems quite excessive. He does a quick physical check. Yes, he’s good, remembered all the proper clothes on all the correct parts and everything.
Sherlock sighed with exasperation but did not address the issue.
“The death of Annabelle Aimes was arranged as part of her employment contract with the American Central Intelligence Agency. Her family was to believe her dead and she was to have no further contact with any acquaintances from her pre-employment life.”
Sherlock's pleading cuts off with an inhuman screech that sends Mycroft sprawling as his ears ring. His Blackberry hits the floor and shatters as he rams his shoulder against the door. When the lock breaks, Sherlock is huddled in the corner of the shower, knees hugged to his chest. The crash of the door hitting the ground resounds loudly in the small room, and Sherlock shrinks further into the corner, covers his head with his arms, and begs again.
“I’m sorry.” It was not enough, he knew it wasn’t, but he couldn’t think of what else to say. He meant it though, and John must have understood because he smiled at Sherlock in that crooked way that said it’s all fine.
Suddenly, John remembered his voice.
He looks anxiously at John, who is still stunned. The concept is incredible. He remembers what it was like to come home and have nothing. He remembers how hard it was to make it to physio those first few weeks. He could barely make it a few blocks with his cane. That had been bloody humiliating. It would have been life-changing to have had an in-house clinic. Happiness bubbles up and fills John’s chest. He can feel tears streaking down his cheeks but he doesn’t care.
Though he doesn’t answer any texts or calls, Sherlock is not actually hard to find. When John enters the flat, he immediately notices the rigid figure seated on the sofa.
"The worst part is that I'm not even surprised. Not really. I should be angry. I should feel betrayed. But I don't. I just feel really, really relieved."
“Blimey,” Greg said, aggressively massaging his own temples.
“Sherlock Holmes is playing by the rules? My, how the mighty have fallen!”
Sherlock flinches at the quiet ferocity and unspoken accusation.
“John…”
“Our lives are dangerous. The nature of the work that we do ensures that we will never be completely safe. That’s a risk I am well aware of and have chosen freely. I made a choice that first night to follow my nutter of a flatmate on a wild goose chase around London. I didn’t do it because it was easy or convenient, and I had no illusions about what I was getting myself into.”
“Sod off, Mycroft. Just find him. Now.”
“The dates…”
John shuffles to the bedroom while Sherlock trails behind him uncertainly. As John climbs under the comforter, Sherlock glances around making sure everything is in order.
Sherlock notices the light shining through the crack of his bedroom door as soon as he rounds the corner into the kitchen. He moves silently down the corridor and pushes open the door.
“I should get out.”
me, Sherlock, and he will never love you. Why would he? He was my assignment, and I made sure to be everything he needed.”
“Mycroft, tell me.” Finally, a bit of steel stole into his voice, making the request more of a command. It made John feel more himself, more in control. It had the added benefit of seeming to shock Mycroft into action as well. He finally flipped open the clasp on his briefcase and withdrew a single file. It was an unassuming manila folder that could not contain more than twenty sheets of paper.
The music fades. Sherlock lifts his chin. He sets the violin on the windowsill.
Oh, but how the times have changed!
the blue, the blue that eclipses John entirely. Their teeth clack together, Sherlock’s tongue lashes out, his fingers dig into John’s hair, and John is blue, nothing more, Sherlock groans against his mouth, he is blue and nothing more.
“She’s so…”
“I’m far less interested in the color of her palms, inspector, than I am in that of her coat.”
She stretches indulgently. “Glad to hear it.” She swirls the amber liquid in the bottom of the glass and flecks of light glitter from her eyes. “Has he called you back yet?”
The rest of the day slips away through their fingers. The effort to hold onto the hours and minutes, to grasp for the seconds, is hopeless. Their hands cannot find purchase. They work. The patients groan and ask for water, painkiller, any number of things. They comply. What choice do they have? And before they have even so much as taken a breath the pale winter afternoon bleeds into the inconstant color of dusk.
At some point a knock on the door shatters the scientific reverie. Sherlock sighs and admits a young woman into the lab. John recognizes her as the girl who was with Sherlock when he first broke into the clinic three weeks ago. She is slender and her mouth pulls down at the corners with worry. She gazes at Sherlock with eyes stretched out of proportion with admiration. John swallows and glances uneasily to the side. He cannot help but touch his own face and wonder if he was wearing such an expression not moments ago.
“I see.” The older boy’s voice loses its distance, loosens into something almost amused, and that is worse than anything else, it’s venom, it’s fire. “In that case, don’t come crying to me.”
“Sherlock!” cries the man at once, pushing past Molly without a glance. “Who is this?” He obviously means John. “You know full well that you mustn’t let unauthorized personnel in here, and especially not
Sherlock sips his tea.
“Experiment.” Sherlock pricks his skin, grins as the blood rushes free. “I need at least seven vials. You wouldn’t understand.”
Silence, for a long time. Sherlock doesn’t look at him. Then, just as John is really sitting up, just as he’s about to ask again—
John laughs again, and this time the sound is a brilliant streak of color in the air before it fades.
, John!”
John tries not to think. He concentrates on the street, the pace of his footsteps, on breathing, the inconstant color of the sky.  He reckons that it is easier for him than for Sherlock. He wishes he could help but he doesn’t want to break the curious spell of silence. At this point they both know the way to Baker Street by heart. They don’t need to speak. They seldom do. Words are translated between them soundlessly. They absorb and transmit meanings in the slightest inclination of the chin, the rustle of a jacket, an inhale, an exhale, a crease of a forehead. John shakes his head. He does not want to think about that. He does not want to consider their strange bond.
He nods helplessly. For the moment there is no choice but to be honest, even though it drives him to the brink of insanity with terror.
Sally was prettier at uni. She used to smile and play with her hair. She was interesting, too, but she wasn’t interested. She didn’t look at men. Sherlock didn’t look at women. She studied criminal law and he studied cocaine; the other subjects were dull, and it was nice to be able to control reality for an instant. They fell in love. People laughed approvingly. It became a great joke. Sherlock was so cold and Sally was so determined that their bed was popularly likened to a block of ice.
Sherlock knows he should be quiet, but his hands are shaking. His shirt is torn and there is a burn twisted into the skin of his stomach. His head swims with pain and exhaustion and fear. John is not his husband. He has made a fool of himself.
“Let’s go, Sherlock,” he spits. “We have more important things to worry about.”
for this one, seeing as a ten-year-old could have figured it out. Basic human instinct, really.”
, that is.”
“What…” John bites down on his lower lip. “What of it, then?”
But today there is no time for ritual. He explodes through the doors and pushes past the sea of subordinates who rise clamoring for him to stop, to show some identification. The General is perched at the head of a long table like a slender green bird, pushing little pieces of painted wood over a map with an expression of vague distaste. Despite modern technology, she has always been inclined towards physical representation, and prefers paper maps and wooden regiments far above punching coordinates into a keyboard. It is a respectable if not inconvenient quality.
“It’s not,” he says. “I.”
Nobody has yet dared to call it World War Three and he supposes that they never will. Perhaps if the United States were to come to their assistance the nickname would catch. But true to the character history has painted, the Americans want nothing to do with the new European front. Granted, Britain does not stand alone – the smaller European countries are eager to raise arms at her side, as is a good portion of Africa and the Middle East – but the combined might of France and Germany is considerable and they seem to gain more allies with each passing day.
“Do you know why you’re here?”
“No,” growls Sherlock.
John looks at him for a while. He puts his laptop on the coffee table and clears his throat. Another glance. Hesitation. Sherlock understands. He climbs over the middle cushion. John reaches out. Sherlock leans into his palm and his thumb tests his cheek, the swell of his lower lip. He sighs. John takes his face in both hands. It’s a meticulous exploration. At some point Sherlock closes his eyes. John drops his hands after an indefinite time and Sherlock gazes at him, sees that he’s sheepish, rubbing at the back of his neck with one hand.
“Afghanistan.”
“I might have been a detective,” drawls Sherlock as an explanation. He drums on his lower lip with his index and middle fingers. A habit; perhaps it embodies the rhythm of his thought. “Had I not been manipulated into running errands for the government before I could protest, that is.”
Sherlock intervenes with another splendid roll of his eyes. His expression has melted again, no longer cool and glassy. Just indifferent. It suits him.
Better to forget him.
Touching John is no longer an essential part of Sherlock’s role; rather, it is an essential part of Sherlock.
“It hurts,” she whimpers. “Help me.”
“Actually,” Sherlock revises as they run. “Step-father.”
“Patches, then.”
Even in the almost-darkness, he can see John’s jaw slacken in shock. Do they really have sex that often? Sherlock will have to do some research, evidently. He realizes with a jolt of shock that the idea sends his heart into his throat again. He swallows thickly and turns away, drawing the sheets closely around himself.
. From when you remembered two sugars in my coffee after two days. John Watson…” His voice is thick. “John Watson, I daresay that I have loved you from the start.”
“Just as I’ve showed you how to do all this time—tirelessly, and out of pure love, I might add—even though you never quite listened, but now you see the error of your ways, and you will do as I suggest?”
“We almost die every other week, and now you’re upset about it?”
, for the love of god.”
His chin is jerked upwards and his breath hitches, because suddenly his vision is nothing but Sherlock Holmes, whose fingers dig cold into the line of his jaw but whose eyes are colder still. They sparkle wildly. Calculating. John flinches and rips his face away. Sherlock leans back obligingly.
“It’s hardly my fault.” Sherlock caps off the vial. “They have to be kept at a certain temperature.”
“Visiting hours are over,” says John. The intruder is a man. He is wearing a black suit. It must be satin otherwise it would not gleam in the dark as it does. Hard eyes again comparable to chips of glass. Not a trace of fear. The strange contours of his mouth bend and contort. There exists no word to describe his expression.
John is quiet for a long moment. “But I think I might keep trying, even so.” He gives a crooked smile. “I’m afraid that stubbornness runs in my blood.”
Centuries have passed since the days of the trenches, of the clusters of barbed wire, of the terror of nuclear fallout. In modern days such as these war is supposed to be a refined art. But blood colors the sand of the desert. The winds blow smoke and the thick smell of carnage. The hospital reeks most of all. The air is hazy and heavy with pain and morphine and last words. Every day is punctuated by new corpses and yet the mattresses are never empty.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, opens his mouth, but John beats him to it.
“Exactly. Well. That, and nicotine.”
One morning John suggests that they get married, and Sherlock says alright, and that’s that. John says that he thinks spring is a very good time to be married, Sherlock laughs, and then they kiss, and make love right there on the sofa. Sherlock’s sleepy afterwards, and dozes with John’s lips in his hair. It’s a predictable mistake. A bit disappointing, even. He should know better.
John’s heard about people like him, of course. He thought they were more of an old wives’ tale, but still. He had heard.
He stops the bow. The music ceases. “I’m sorry.” It’s all he can say for now.  It’s the first day back from the hospital. It’s the first day of reality, and he needs time to adjust. They both do, really; they’re not sure how to be around each other yet.
Sherlock is quiet for a long moment, and when he speaks, he chooses his words carefully.
the neighbors say? So you don’t even consider it, no. Can’t consider it until at least six months have passed, and then you might give it some thought. Sit down, take some notes, draw a conclusion. Just as you will when you calculate when to move in with her, what colors to use at the wedding, how many children to have, where to retire. Because that’s how it works. Love. Isn’t it?”
to be different. This can’t be all there is. I can’t believe it. I won’t believe it. It’s impossible. There’s so much more to it. More.” He grips the rail of the bridge until his palms burn from the cold. “No. I won’t believe that it was supposed to end here. I can’t shake the feeling that you and I were supposed to be something more.”
There is the scar. His skin is the war and the war is pale, so his skin is pale. The war is John and the war is pale, so John is pale.
“Eat. You’re pale.”
That spring, Irene kissed his cheek, and he fell asleep on her shoulder, and when he woke a fat woman in a muddy blazer was striking his desk with a ruler. His classmates laughed and he was given detention for sleeping in class. He was idly sad. He didn’t see Irene again. He didn’t except to. But now he’s confronted with that mouth, and the right measurements, and the brush of her fingers at his cheek. She jams something into his neck; he smiles as the ground surges up to meet him. She’s unmistakable.
Then, from somewhere very, very distant (and at once acute: he is being shaken, he realizes, at the shoulders), a sound:
Sherlock rolls his eyes – “Oh, don’t be so dramatic; it doesn’t suit you,” – but he looks impressed.
The fear that has been clutching his bones since John reached out to sweep the hair from the little girl’s forehead rears its head again. Sherlock grips the edge of the table. “I don’t know what you mean.”
“I am human. I am alive. I have been alive for many, many years, certainly much more than the more or less month-long period of time—Mahatma Gandhi, 21 days, although there were also those Irish hunger strikers, between 46 and 73 days, now that
“Yes,” says John. Wondering, briefly, if he might cry. “She’s just like you.”
“Yes, well. He wants to control me most of all.” And then, quieter: “I frighten him.”
Fear.
And not long after, he is gone.
“Perhaps,” he replies tersely. He deliberates over every word. “They remind me of a little girl. I can’t remember her name. I heard about her a few weeks ago and went to take some samples, but the doctor caught me…” He stops. He does not want to talk about John. He is not sure why. Of course John should not be involved, although perhaps it is already too late for that. But it also seems like a secret, a secret which he quite jealously wants to keep. How curious.
“Sherlock.” Mycroft’s voice is terse. “Evacuation. Three days. Don’t tell anyone.”
He leans into the older boy, even though he hates it, and feels him wipe a lurid tongue of vomit from the corners of his lips. And then from somewhere deep within him a thought slips to the surface: it is weak, and ragged, but it is real.
It is not the same as color, either.
He will move what little he has from the clinic the following morning. He is in no hurry and it is too late anyhow. They dallied with the violin and the tea –
A quiet rain begins, hushed drumbeats on the roof. It mingles with their breathing and the creak of the couch. It’s overwhelming, but Sherlock doesn’t want to move. He likes the weight of John, the smell of his shirt, his skin, the murmur of his hands and lips. He likes the warmth in the pit of his own stomach. It’s all brand new, and he likes it all very much, and he’s a bit chagrined when John pushes him away.
“For the love of god, John, don’t pretend to be any stupider than you already are. You know what I mean.”
And he loves Sherlock, loves him loves him loves him.
Sherlock gapes. “You…”
Sherlock smiles tolerantly and draws a badge from his pocket with a flourish. John swallows. Research department. Royal. During the day he can be wherever he very well pleases. Sherlock chuckles. Doubtless he can see the realization play out on John’s expression.
John smirks. “Oh, you must be terribly hungry, working all day.” He wants to pretend things are normal. He wants to pretend and he hopes Sherlock will pretend, too, because games are no fun playing alone. He waits with baited breath. Sherlock chuckles as they head towards the door. He exhales.
He smiles. Already John has learned to be wary of his smile.
John snorts and presses his nose into his shoulder. Then they’re kissing, idly at first, until John shuts off the telly and puts his hand in the hair at the nape of Sherlock’s neck. It’s gotten a bit more serious; John tastes of spice, tea leaves, a trace of mint toothpaste, and his other hand is on Sherlock’s neck, close to his singing pulse. A while later he breaks away, drops a kiss at his jaw, and shifts so that Sherlock nestles in crook of his legs to extend luxuriously over his chest.
“Unfortunately for your sake, my dear Watson,” he replies, “you left that position behind the moment you brought in this little girl.”
“And if I agree, you’ll…restrain yourself?”
John exhales through his nose. “If you must know, yes.” He rubs his temple. “I don’t think I have other memories, not anymore.”
, you…” No. No. Grit teeth. Grit teeth. “For a…simulacrum.”
Does Sherlock put butter on toast? John has seen Sherlock eat toast (rarely is not never), but he doesn’t remember what he likes (Sherlock would remember what John likes, or would not even need to remember, would deduce it from the pattern of his jumper; John is not Sherlock). Fuck. Jam? Honey? Nutella? Peanut butter? Peanut butter and banana? Sliced banana? Sliced in little yellow circles? Almost cute, as if for a child? As if packing their lunch? Oh no. Sherlock does need—nutrients, doesn’t he? Some fat? Some protein? A little sodium? Sugars, preferably natural? Banana sugar is natural. And potassium? Fuck. Who the hell knows what he needs? Well, probably Sherlock.
He cannot stand not to know something, let alone something to do with John Watson.
A pause. And then again, the older boy:
Sand. The bare bowl of the sky. Wanness of light—of light, light, the sun, darting wires, a torch that moves like someone flinching, piercing and insubstantial.
Therapy had him suspended like a fragile bridge between realities for a while, and that was alright. He even dreamt a bit. Mundane things: a trip to Tesco, a walk in the park with a faceless girl, sometimes a man, a cloudy sky, feeding the ducks. He got out of the ward and rented a flat. Then he woke up and the Soviet Union had been gone for fifteen years.
“No, I mean it, I’m not here for…for that, for
Sherlock drops her wrist. John is gripping the railing of the bed. His face is expressionless except for where his mouth draws down faintly at the corners. The slightest crease spells the depth of his horror. Otherwise he is empty. Devoid. But then the blank sheet of paper that is his face crumples and straightens again with a thousand new wrinkles, and the emptiness melts into confusion. Sherlock watches as John begins to suck on his lower lip. He seems human again. Sherlock gives a silent sigh of relief, because to him, that much seems to be only John’s job. Being human and such, that is. John is soft. Softer than he is, at least. Soft enough to allow confusion to melt his face.
“Sounds festive,” Sophie says. “The minister will not be attending.”
“Yes,” David nods, strapped to wires emanating from the computer housing the polygraph test’s software.
A pair of sympathetic eyes stare patiently at him through the rear-view mirror, and with another sigh he gives the man his address. The car slides quietly away from the kerb and John sits back heavily, resigned, as the nearest edge of Regents Park comes into view.
“So you’ve never…” He clears his throat. “You’ve never moved, or…?”
Slack-jawed, John doesn’t say a word.
There’s nothing out of line as far as his eyes can see; just a regular Tuesday afternoon filled with sounds of laughter and idle chatter.
“I’m sure that’s not true.”
“Anthea had to use a significant portion of her talent to gain us access here,” Mycroft says. “Let’s hope it gets us something useful.”
“The circumstances of my return were…” Sherlock swallows, choosing not to detail. “While it is difficult for me to read social cues, it was clear that John wasn’t interested in my presence. He switched sides. It unnerved me. I think it… clouded my judgment.”
Trying this way and that, browsing through the video streams coming from inside the house, he stops dead angrily when he realizes what’s wrong. He picks his phone up and dials the only number the phone had been used for so far.
“I still think about her every day, Sherlock.” He says, shaking his head. “How lonely she must have felt. We were both young, you know, I don’t know if I would have been able to save her... but I would have liked to have a chance. To kick him out of our house, to call him out. I was big by then. I’d have liked to see him try to get at me.”
“What’s going on?” Lestrade asks.
He must be invisible. That’s the only explanation.
He hears the door to the sitting room open whilst he collects his toiletries and packs for their Christmas visit.
“I’m sure you do.” Sherlock says and burrows in John’s neck again, inhaling John’s scent in.
“How could you tell him that no one’s waiting for you at home when you come back?”
“What’s all this?” John asks, noticing the new setup on the wall.
John sits in his chair, staring at the dust travelling through unsuspecting sunbeams. He listens as Sherlock opens the door downstairs. Rosie’s voice travels as Sherlock knocks on Mrs. Hudson’s door.
“I beat him with my own hands on the floor of my cell, and...” David says through gritted teeth.
The table goes dead silent as everyone around it turns to find a dishevelled man walking toward them.
But as time stretches on, John’s resolve weakens. Sherlock is different - it’s very subtle, and not bad at all. He seems a bit more at ease, a bit more round around his usually sharp edges. There are smiles, responses that are not as grating. Names mentioned that John doesn’t recognize, jokes he’s not in on.
“It was everything from… from who I was, where I lived. Names of my girlfriends, of friends from school. And then… supply routes, communication codes, rules of engagement. Names of soldiers from our compound, days of new sections arrivals. That sort of thing.”
There is no luck to be had.
Ten minutes later and the door opens to admit John. He looks rumpled and mortified. His hair is matted and dull. His eyes are exhausted. His ratty purple cardigan and grey oxford are filthy and wrinkled. There is indeed a bandage wrapped around his forehead. He has been subsisting on coffee and hospital pastries nicked from the tray by the secretaries alone. He is worried and angry, palpably caught between the two emotions. Sherlock aches with love.
And likewise Sherlock Homes is no ordinary scientist.
“God,” gasps the older boy, at last. “Don’t you see there’s no other way?”
is uncertain as he scoots across the mattress and tentatively winds one arm down around John’s waist. The gentle rhythm of his breathing stutters and Sherlock pauses, but John only sighs and presses against his stomach. He is still asleep. With bated breath, Sherlock carefully splays his fingers across his stomach, tests the swell of his abdomen, the nuances of his ribcage, the thrum of his heartbeat. Then all at once he buries his face in the crook of his shoulder and a sigh of immeasurable satisfaction escapes his lips.
“Sherlock?”
“Shut up.” Does it surprise the older boy, the grit of his own front teeth? It hasn’t for a long time. But here, now—maybe. “Shut
Sherlock clears his throat.
Sherlock doesn’t see. John makes sure of that. He doesn’t see, does he? Would John know if he did? Maybe. Maybe. But, he reminds himself, he’s not even looking. Not even looking. No matter how much of a genius you are, it’s hard to see what you don’t ever think to look for.
Sherlock barks a laugh—performative, arrogant. It is something he wants other people to hear. And yet when he speaks the words are low, controlled. Almost private.
The fall is—pale.
“So you think that I have been rather brusque. Forgive me; it is only that you seem to be quite willing to surround yourself with Death.”
“It was the first time my brother ever admitted to having made a mistake. In front of me, at the very least. I suspect, however, it was also the first time he had admitted such a thing ever in his life.”
“If you expect anything of me,” says Sherlock, and his voice is so tight, straining over each syllable, so tight that John thinks it would have been deep and gasping and laden, laden, laden, were he not forcing it between his cemented together teeth. “Even one single thing, John. You expect too much.”
John colors. “Right. Of course you wouldn’t…want that.” He looks away. “I’ll just go, then. I’m sure I can find another place without too much trouble.” He says it so easily; his expression is veiled. Sherlock just imagines the idea of Baker Street without John Watson and is left nearly breathless with pain
John takes a moment to shoo Death from the foot of the bed –
Obviously.
But he does not die for three more hours, and he cries for help with his last breath.
Sherlock sighs. “What’s troubling you?” His eyes flash warningly. “I’m curious.”
John will come and have a look tomorrow.
They make it to the bedroom. In the doorway, Sherlock groans.
“I don’t see how that’s foolish. She only just died this morning and you’ve proven yourself to be the sort of man who honestly cares for each and every patient. Perplexing, that, and quite inconvenient, as you can see, but not necessarily…foolish…I would say.”
“Well?”
“Sorry,” he manages.
Don’t open eyes. Don’t open eyes. Don’t—
But it was always like that, everyone but Sherlock.  He was an exception. Born to break the rules. He thought about this at night as he tried not to sleep. He didn’t want to wake to another contorted reality. Maybe the brand of tea his mother liked would change. But maybe his father would be sitting beside her at the kitchen table alive and well. Maybe they wouldn’t even recognize him. Maybe he wouldn’t be their son any longer.
“Impossible?”
They jump.
“Of course not,” he says quietly. “Not a word. I swear to you on my honor as a soldier.” He pauses. “Thank you, Sherlock.”
“Fantastic,” gasps John eventually. “Just fantastic. I really should have known better. Of course it was nothing but an experiment to you. No, not even that. Only you would keep amnesia a secret for fun, Sherlock. You were just doing what you thought was expected. You were playing a part. It was a game. We were playing charades like children. Nothing about it was real. Terrific.” He stands. There is blood on his palms. The sound of human voices erupts into the air and he glances over his shoulder. “The police. We will need to go to the hospital. You can barely sit up. I’ll go say hello.”
, not at all. Sherlock groans and the world rushes back to life in an excruciating explosion of sound and color. He is glad for John’s hands on his shoulders. Otherwise he fears he might break into a thousand pieces.
“I fear that I myself would prefer that you not do so,” he replies creamily.
“Of course I bloody believe you. I’ve got no choice.”
“Say…” His voice seems to shatter something in the air. He does not know what, but the shards shower down between them like broken glass. Sherlock raises a brow. His hand is still on the doorknob.
When he grabs John, when he pulls away the bomb, John can’t handle it—the closeness, the weight of Sherlock’s breath, the frantic stumbling of his fingers which are still nimble but so suddenly unlike him, so unlike him. He is afraid, there’s no denying it, and his fear feels almost like, almost like, fuck, it feels almost like love, and John can’t. Can’t do it. He gasps:
Memories cling to John with sticky fingers, like sleep just before dawn. They are patterned and predictable, a broken black and white film reel from centuries ago, dusty and spotted. Always the same. As he has done a thousand times before, up late at night in the clinic watching patients, before his waking eyes he sees himself wandering through the streets of London to buy a newspaper the first morning after his return. He is oblivious to the gunfire that sears and crackles like water in a pan of hot oil. Halfway to the news kiosk, a soldier trips across his path. He is bleeding from the ear. A few drops spatter nearby on the pavement. Scattered gems. John buys the paper. He unfurls it with trembling fingers. Little news from the front.
John takes her hand. Her fingertips are swollen and flushed, and her toes, too, so much that the nails have begun to disappear. He frowns and plucks her from the examination table. She burrows into the crook of his shoulder and her skinny arms seal around his neck. The whole world cannot help but to trust John. He is a good doctor perhaps more because of who he is than his medical degree at all.
“I don’t,” he manages. “I won’t. It can’t. So.”
John shakes his head. “No. That’s alright. Not thirsty.” He pauses. “Actually, I...well, I was wondering if you would do me a favor.”
“I fear that I will have to ask you to leave,” he says evenly. The intruder meets his gaze.
“It can’t be,” he repeats. “It can’t be; good God, just this morning she was…”
Very little did.
(See the end of the chapter for
John cannot bear it. As he presses the needle into the slender blue vein at the junction of her elbow he wonders how long it has been since he was last compelled to overuse the cool syringes of morphine. He pushes down and she cries out in pain. He apologizes again and again. But he cannot stop until her jaw slackens and she sinks back into the pillows with a sigh. Her face is no longer a slip of paper but rather a puddle of milk. He touches her cheek and rises with a grunt of pain; the leg still worries him.
“Don’t be absurd. Of course I can. For example, when we met yesterday I saw your desire to stick a gun in your mouth and pull the trigger. Or don’t you recall? It’s still there, by the way. And yet, you have done no such thing. So, what does that tell us? That you are brave? That you are a coward? Or perhaps you are waiting for a sign. From all we can learn from colors, it is just as likely that you are done waiting and are simply too apathetic to do away with your own miserable existence. But is that the case, really? I don’t know. I simply do not. And I suspect that neither do you.”
viously.”
He can hear Molly hesitate. It is a tense sound. Eventually she lets up on her lower lip. There is lipstick on her teeth. Poor girl. She quietly admits that he is right.
“I do—care about you, John. You must know that.”
it? John can’t tell, he can’t tell, and he wishes not for the first time for anything to open on that man’s sheet-of-paper skin.
But, he reasons with himself, he is only digressing in the vain hope of distracting himself. At some point he will have to acknowledge the panic that has begun to twist itself into his ribs. The little girl is dead. The little girl is dead and she died with the symptoms. The symptoms, the very symptoms. Sherlock cannot deny it. There can be no mistaking them. The little girl is dead and she died with the symptoms and John is standing at her bedside with that infinite expression in his eyes and it is all Sherlock can manage to sputter facts like a broken faucet and construct silly analogies about painting and emotions spelled out in eyes and cheekbones and lips.
He looks at Sherlock.
“Those stories are insipid,” replies Sherlock.
“Thank you,” he breathes, with the dreamlike slowness of a sleepwalker.
“All right, then,” says John after a tic. “Tea, Mycroft?”
Even in the indefinite grey light he can see Sherlock raise a brow in surprise. “Certainly.”
Thank you for reading!
And he knows that, from the juncture of vein and lips—from the wake of those thousand tiny deaths—there flowers up into his face an infinite, infinite blue.
Mycroft nods and reaches for the phone.
“Yes.”
“John,” says Sherlock. “It
“Sherlock,” says the girl.
John swallows, thickly.
“Ourselves, at the altar, perhaps in matching tuxedos?” he suggests, eyes following the path of the grey sunlight over the curve of the ring. Sherlock laughs again.
Sherlock throws his hands into the air. “The doctor and I! But that hardly matters, does it?” Fear and exasperation eat at his voice like acid. He fears that soon it will be left full of holes like an old rag and his words will slip through the gaps and shatter on the ground.
“Nobody,” says Irene. She does not try to conceal her gratitude. “He grows close to nobody.”
“It’s. It’s only been a few months.”
Sherlock is liquid, living liquid there in the center of the music, and when he bares the bow against the strings, the note that slips from the intimacy, from the unbearable pressure of their contact, is liquid, and it is—it is bright. Bright, so bright, every note flows into a ribbon of color, rippling and tenuous and alive, and there is Sherlock in the center of all of it, the green and red and yellow and purple and silver and orange and pink and grey and the gold and gold and gold. The colors knot themselves around him, lick at his shoulders, his neck, his cheeks and hands, ricochet from him but always come back, trying again, again and again and again, for as long as he plays. He is surrounded by color; color surrounds him. For as long as he plays.
John’s breath hitches. “Who?”
Sherlock frowns. “I can safely assume that Ms. Adler has informed you, then?”
John pushes his plate away. He has barely eaten anything. He reaches across the table and swallows the dregs of Sherlock’s coffee. Unthinkingly, as if it were nothing at all. Sherlock stares. John wipes his mouth on the edge of his sleeve.
And neither, Sherlock considers, can happiness.
They never mention their marriage; they do not need words. John’s eyes speak for them both.
“If you’re not opposed, that is…” He presses his palm. “Maybe we can start over.”
“They’ve come back,” says Sherlock.
“As do you,” he replies. “Quite lovely in your uniform, as always.”
A soft chuckle. Loathsome. But—worth it. If only barely.
“So it has come to this,” murmurs Mycroft. He cannot help but glance out the window. Outside London is grey, but alive and breathing. The sky is silver. So the sun must be strong through the thin layer of cloud. There was light rain in the morning but now the air is dry.
She wanders into the clinic clutching her hands together in front of her chest as if caught halfway through a prayer. Veins bulge sickly blue and purple from her wrists and fingers. She is wearing a pink cotton dress and her face and lips are stained with ash. The nurses swoop down on her like birds of prey, their crisp caps and pressed white skirts flared to ward off competitors. She begins to cry.
His only regret is that, with the man’s hands around his throat, he can’t laugh at it.
John nods, and then he feels Sherlock's baritone chuckle radiate through him.
“It’s not his fault.” Mycroft closes his eyes. “It is not my brother’s fault.”
“It being an infant hardly makes it more or less deserving than an adult human,” he says. “It simply hasn’t been given the chance to ruin something.”
Fear.
Sherlock snorts. “Ridiculous, that custom. I don’t want to make a scene or dirty my trousers.” He meets John’s eyes. “Nevertheless, will you?”
He cannot say why it hurts when John looks at him in disappointment.
“Old line of my brother’s, that. What a terrific arse.” He shifts his weight from one foot to the other. “In any case, as a point of interest that relates to the subject at hand, I myself have long been in search of a flatmate. The rent has spiked in these conditions, and while my landlady is very kind, I have  grown unfortunately fond of her, and hate to see her suffer financially solely on my behalf. In short, doctor, a few extra pounds would greatly soothe my guilt. In addition, I believe you should know that I find you to be an intriguing if not an entirely bearable human being.” He pauses. The bow of his lip curves and for an instant he is an impish child.
“Everything hurts.” Her teeth come down spasmodically on her lower lip. “Won’t somebody help me…please…”
The younger boy curls his hands into fists in hospital sheets that feel like paper against his skin.
He looks up at Sherlock and he can read the question in his eyes.
Hatred. He had been immersed in himself, spinning through the crooked hallways of his own mind, and he doesn’t want to find his way, not to this place (hospital bed), this time (he is twenty-seven), not to this person (Daedalus, he thinks, so cold in his craft, and his lips nearly curve). But the older boy won’t leave; he knows the older boy won’t leave. So he breathes once through the tiny space that, in the ferocious set of his expression, he has left open between his lips.
detective, as emphasizes Lestrade’s subordinate, a young woman with perpetually pursed lips. They are clearly sleeping together; she takes pains to hide the marks at her throat, and he is too careful not to brush against her when they leave the room. Sherlock treats them coldly, and they do not seem surprised.
“Don’t move,” he whispers, and kisses him. It’s proper, solid but gentle. John isn’t asking for anything. He’s only sharing a bit of himself. Sherlock cautiously tilts his chin. It’s short, not very passionate or wrenched with feeling, but it’s important. It’s everything, and they’re both smiling when they part.
The pediatric ward is out of the question; so is intensive care. He will take her to the clinic and watch her. He only trusts himself with the task. The girl takes the news calmly. Relief even flickers into her expression. She thanks him quietly. Startled, he asks her why.
“John. It should not need to be said, but you are not to speak of this to anyone.” He looks down. “To be perfectly honest I’m not quite sure what I was thinking, showing this to you, after all.”
Later, she drugs him with a swift prick in the throat; the motion is easy, practiced, something she must have done hundreds of times before, and yet, her hand drags with something like sadness.
Quiet. John begins to realize what he has said. Sherlock does not move, does not even breathe. His eyes are distant. They both stare into the river. They dare not look away.
“Anderson!” The name rings in the silence like a crystal champagne flute struck with a silver spoon. The sound is fragile and tenuous. It stretches and ripples. A few patients shift in their beds. To their right a young man groans softly. The veil of sleep begins to evaporate. Sherlock takes a step forwards. His chest is heaving. For a moment his eyes rest on John. Then they focus on nothing at all.
“What?” says John, though of course he knows, and he knows Sherlock knows he knows. He braces himself for the bite of his retort, for something dug down into him, turning him inside out.
At some point they’re kissing. It’s gotten easier, and the room spins a bit. Effect of the tranquilizer, rationalizes Sherlock. Maybe that’s not the whole story. He wants to sleep again. John is unbuttoning his shirt, innocently, like a parent to a child, and pulling him to his chest. He drowses, and for the first time in a while, he has the impression of a dream.
He is not unacquainted with London, but the city seems foreign to him. The grey faces of her buildings and shops are as empty and unrecognizable as those of the citizens who skitter along the streets as if shortcuts and alleyways will shelter them from bullets and mines. The barricades and the twinkling fires strip the city of her familiar personality. She loses her grandeur in the glimpses of uniforms and the murmurs of French and German that fall onto the pavement and shatter like shards of glass. And yet one can see the remnants of pride in the immaculate hedges of her parks and the clean walls of Buckingham Palace, for the government keeps her well even as chaos burns in her heart.
“John, no.” He unthinkingly reaches for his hand. “Don’t you understand? I thought you were my husband and so I decided to fall in love with you. I was…terrified, frankly. I had no idea what would happen. To forge such a feeling seemed…impossibly daunting.” He stops for a long moment. John’s hand is limp in his grasp. He presses his thumb into his palm, feels the rush of his pulse. “It was easier than I imagined. And then one day sitting on the couch I realized that it was easy because it was real.”
He steps towards the glow of his desk lamp and nearly drops the empty syringe. A figure has materialized from the darkness behind him. It ghosts silently to the edge of the mattress and stares down at the little girl, sleeping at peace under the drugs. For a moment John thinks that Death has crafted a new form, and he tries to frighten him from the bed again. What business has he trifling with a child when he can have his pick of fine young men? What business at all? The girl is not ready but the soldiers are ripe with lead and blood.
“Ah,” says John.
Rash, rash; rash, rash, rash!
Mycroft is in the sitting room. John is in his robe, scratching his belly as he walks downstairs, and Mycroft is in the sitting room, and Sherlock is perched in the armchair across from him, and both of them are fully dressed—immaculate suits, silk ties—and nether is saying a word, just staring, staring.
He remembers the feeling differently. Once, when he was six or seven, he was alone in the house and felt uneasy. Another time, Mycroft fell and broke his arm at the elbow. Their mother was uncharacteristically unsettled. Clutching her hand in the hospital waiting room, Sherlock had felt his stomach twist.
“I thought.” He pushes the words between his teeth. “You didn’t make deductions from colors.”
John sighs.
John shakes his head. “It seems quite the opposite to me. Maybe you feel so much, Sherlock, and so deeply, that your dreams are so rich that they’re…well, that they’re reality. Maybe you’re the strongest dreamer. Maybe you can meld the world with your feeling because you have so much. Maybe it’s not reality that controls you, in the end.”
And he pauses, and John’s hope (the shape of sparks, yellow, skittering across his fingertips) catches on that tiny miracle: Sherlock Holmes, pausing. And then, Sherlock Holmes, coming alive, so alive with color he seems wreathed in it, black purple grief and orange yellow joy and red, red, pain and anger, and everything else imaginable and all of it impossibly intense and yet in every bit, in every single color, at the same time there is that lithe and lovely blue, the one John’s only read about in sonnets and seen in special effects, but never really, never really—except, of course, on his very own skin.
Strange. Terrible.
But even so, with every new patient John relives his first acquaintance with Death.
“Subjective.”
Thank you so much for reading!
Later that night, John still doesn’t feel like cooking—only eggs in the morning, eggs in the morning—so he gets Thai takeaway. He’s on the phone with the restaurant when he pauses for a long moment. Then, he orders for two. Sherlock drew a lot of blood that day, he should eat something. The food comes, and John goes into the sitting room and puts a carton of pineapple fried rice at Sherlock’s elbow. He does not look at it. An hour later, he has not so much as unwrapped the chopsticks.
And maybe he imagines it, or maybe it’s just the morning light, the slant of it cutting Sherlock’s expression into pieces, but John thinks he sees in the meant-to-be-granite resolve of his mouth, in the set of it, in his teeth pressed together, in the firmness of his hands and shoulders, in all of that John thinks he sees a certain crystalline texture, a prismatic almost trembling, terribly and sweetly fragile. He thinks he sees it, and maybe he’s imagining it, maybe it’s the light, but it pushes him forwards; it sets off, in the recesses of his chest, a tiny tragic shatter of hope.
The Afghanistan of his nightmares: sand sky earth light flinching bullets blood sand.
“Tiresome.”
John opens his eyes and gazes, from the point where their hands meet and their wrists wind up and away from each other, at the blue of Sherlock’s skin, mirrored onto his.
“More,” he sobs in broken English. He seems to know his surroundings enough to understand who John is. “More, sir, you are a doctor, please, more. Make it stop.
“We’re hopeless, you and I.” He gives him a shake. “Absolutely hopeless.”
“Splendid.”
John hates buying groceries. But someone has to do it. Don’t they?
“Could’ve been.”
“John,” he says, and the force of the punch is gone from his voice, and the universe of tenderness in that tiny syllable snaps in two something that John had built up within himself ever since he fired that bullet and watched his skin rust over.
The color spills from John’s neck to flood his cheeks. He opens his mouth. His pulse sings, a startled bird trapped beneath Sherlock’s thumb. He blinks slowly; his chest seems to swell. An unsteady exhale buoys his reply to the ceiling.
, the situation only grows more perplexing. It would seem that he and John share the place; the furniture is a jumble of personalities, the walls peeling with hidden stories that Sherlock itches to uncover. He has been confined to his bed, but once John has left to purchase some groceries, he rises and begins to wander about the apartment, searching, but for what? He has harbored the quiet hope that something will jog his memory, that he will be broken from this dreamlike world which does not seem to belong to him, but as he runs his fingers across the spines of crumbling old volumes and hesitantly presses his palm into the cushions of the sofa, as his fingers find the slender bow of a violin and – much to his surprise – draw out a few whining notes by the windowsill, it becomes increasingly apparent that this will not happen.
John was right. The past can’t be restored. Perhaps it never existed in the first place. But they started over. Sometimes they talk about a house in the countryside. A backyard, a big kitchen, windows for lots of sun. Bees, suggests Sherlock on a whim, and John laughs and kisses him. Alright. Bees. Whatever you like. But they’re not quiet ready for peace and quiet, not yet. So for now, it’s just a pleasant dream.
Sherlock nods. He waits for the panic to show on John’s face. But it never does. In the end there is only the slightest flicker of emotion. Anger winks from the bend of his mouth, the crease of his forehead. But why?
“Do forgive me for saying so, my dear Watson,” says Sherlock finally, and his voice is strange, stiff and starched like hospital sheets. John cannot bring himself to look at him. He is too afraid. The lapping of the water fills a pause that seems an eternity. At long last Sherlock exhales.
His fingers are cold and John finds himself halfway across the clinic before his breath returns. They bob and weave quickly between the mattresses. Sherlock says nothing. In fact, he does not so much as look back over his shoulder while John stumbles over his own feet and tries to find the words to protest. Sherlock does not even seem to feel the need to ask for directions. Soon they are standing at the foot of the bed where the little girl is slipping between sleeping and waking. Her fever still rages. Her lips are dry and her breath whistles painstakingly between them.
“I know. That you know. You know everything.”
“What are you doing?”
“A word?” says Sherlock.
“Yes. Of course.” Sherlock runs a hand through his hair. He swallows and the pale flesh of his neck contracts. “Follow me.”
Silence.
“My dear boy. He already does.” A snort. “Ordinary people are so naive.”
And yet.
How long did she sleep the night before, was she restless, and did she seat the vanilla pudding that silly old nurse left out for her the other day?
“Um, can I, um.” He screws his eyes shut. “Would you like me to move out? I was thinking…thinking about getting a new flat anyway. You know. Before. I could still come on cases and all that. But if it would be easier for you, it really wouldn’t be too much trouble. That is. I can just—”
Sherlock stares. “America, I would guess. The queen is already there in the first place.” He cannot comprehend that John is so calm. “But that hardly matters, does it?”
Oh, but John cannot possibly describe it to him.
For John Watson, the little girl with her face pulled white and wan over her cheekbones like the skin of a leather drum is the pebble.
The drive isn’t long, but Sherlock pays the whole fare. John is unsure of how to react to this. In the end he says nothing.  The restaurant is small and its windows cast a friendly glow onto the sidewalk. It forms a striking juxtaposition with the shadows of the fires that crackle from the alleyways and the occasional fountain of light that spurts up from somewhere in the distance: shells exploding.
Sherlock exhales unsteadily. “Not at all.”
Sherlock makes a small, impossibly frustrated noise from the back of his throat. “Boring.”
After a few minutes, he feels okay enough to lift his head. His vision still swims a bit, but thankfully the gaping customers have moved on. He swipes at his eyes, fighting hard against the tremor in his hands. He pulls himself up on shaking knees until he stands tall-backed and proud: Sherlock Holmes, Consulting Detective once more.
Concerned that this is taking a turn for the worse, Greg hurries to reassure the detective.
"Come on time to get up."
“Git.”
The familiar flow of information winds itself around Sherlock's brain. He settles into the comforting cadence of deductions. His shoulders grow lax and his face lights up in a way John has not seen in months. Sherlock's words slow as he reaches the end of his list. His brow puckers.
