Tony suited up and blasted off, leaving Steve alone with Thor and Bruce. He called SHIELD, talked to a few different people who were no help at all, then settled in with Thor to wait for Natasha and Clint’s report while Bruce worked with JARVIS to analyze some of the data from the Mandarin’s explosions.
Steve conceded. "You're probably right. Maybe I'll visit the principal. See what I can learn about Jim. Thanks, Tony." Without thinking, he clapped Tony on the shoulder. Tony seemed surprised, but didn't move away from his touch.
“Just because Steve isn’t here to mother-hen you, doesn’t mean you don’t need to eat. But I don’t cook, so you get Doritos and Pop-Tarts. Take your pick.”
Someone Steve didn’t recognize came up to Rumlow and grabbed him by the elbow. Steve knew he wasn’t supposed to hear the whispered, “Are you crazy? What the fuck are you thinking bringing him here?”
“I don’t. I mean, I didn’t read your files. Or at least not the full thing. They gave me files on everyone, but mostly it was just skills and evaluations, no real history or detail. They, ah. They also showed me some… footage. Of you and Dr. Banner, mostly. They seemed to think it was important. I’m not sure why. The stuff they showed of you doesn’t really seem like you. Anyway, you don’t have to tell me anything you don’t want to. I can wait. Besides, he said I’m supposed to trust you and earn your trust in me. That’s where I’ll start. I’ll keep you posted on what I get from Romanoff. Should we set up a time to meet? Do we need an excuse? Damn, I’m terrible at subterfuge.”
“Welcome back, Captain. I’ve alerted the rest of the Avengers to your return, which coincides with that of Thor. They are on the common floor and have asked that I update you on Thor’s story while you make your way there. They believe it will be faster.”
Steve huffed out a laugh. “Yes, please, dispense with the kid gloves. Might actually be my favorite thing about Stark. Zero risk of kid gloves there. How am I ever supposed to catch up if everyone keeps pretending nothing’s changed?” As they finished eating, they made plans to meet up the next day to buy him a new phone, then decided to meet at Natasha’s to watch their first movie. Despite everything that had happened that day – and boy, had it been maybe the longest day in history – Steve went to bed feeling more hopeful than he had so far this century.
“I have no idea how it’s possible. I did defeat Schmidt, and from my understanding, the rest of Hydra followed soon after. But Brock Rumlow, head of SHIELD’s STRIKE team, said, ‘Hail Hydra,’ to me in the locker room today. Long story short, our future selves,” he gestured between Tony and himself, “apparently knew that the whole STRIKE team and Agent Sitwell – plus, from how the conversation went, Secretary Alexander Pierce – were Hydra. They were in the elevator with the scepter, future me needed the scepter, and he convinced them to give it to him by hailing Hydra. So now, they all think that
Natasha wasted no time. “SHIELD is compromised. We’ve known for a while now. We weren’t sure if we could trust you until yesterday.”
“Oh my god!” Steve and Thor whirled around, braced for attack, only to see a blond child holding some sort of homemade weapon that looked like it had been pointed at them until he’d figured out who they were. “Tony didn’t say you guys were coming!”
Steve started, mouth open. "There's got to be some mistake. Could someone else have done it and… put his name on the paperwork? That doesn't make sense either. What the hell?"
Steve frowned, confused. “They do that? Pay people part-time so they don’t have to give them benefits? And that’s what SHIELD is doing to Tony?”
It took him a solid 24 hours, but Steve finally worked up the nerve to call Tony. “Um, hey, this is Steve. The firefighter. From the accident you were in the other day. Um, Natasha - she’s Miss Potts’ assistant - she gave me your phone number.” He took a deep breath. “I was wondering if maybe you wanted to get dinner with me this Saturday.”
They were all settled in on the various furniture when JARVIS informed them that Phil was requesting entrance.
“Actually, Captain, I wanted your thoughts on the team. I hear you guys had a little get-to-know-you gathering. I’m curious how that went for you.” Fury leaned back in his chair with his hands folded in his lap.
Tony hugged her and told her he’d take care of Extremis. “You’re going to be fine,” he promised. Then he turned to Steve, noticing the burns for the first time. “You saved her. Thank you.”
“Regular injections, to keep my antibodies and all that up.” Tony shook himself slightly, as though his discomfort was nothing more than water and he a wet dog. “Look, I know I’m the weakest on the team, physically. But if we could just not do the whole I’m kind of disabled and it makes people uncomfortable thing-”
The shape of the idea that’s building inside of him is so large, it’s hard to see the end of it. He tests out the tenets of what Tony and people like him are saying. Tony doesn’t let his dynamic affect him. So, functionally, he doesn’t have one. Tony is…other? He’s just… He’s just a human man, and his dynamic isn’t important because he lives without it. What is it they say? Better living through chemistry? Steve smiles at that, the thought buoying him. In a strange kind of way, he and Tony are matched.
“Eh, it was a mixed bag. According to JARVIS, our sample is too small to come with anything concrete through pattern analysis without more known variables in the equation, so we need more known quantities or more variables. Preferably both. Theoretically, I could use the records I got from SHIELD to create a kind of web. Who knows who, who was assigned to what projects, etc.”
Getting beer with Sam was about as far as it could be from getting beer with Rumlow. Sam talked about his former wingman, Riley, who had died in combat. It made Steve comfortable enough to talk about Bucky, or at least what it had been like watching him die. They talked and laughed for a couple of hours before Natasha disappeared to “take care of some things.” Steve didn’t know what those things were, but he figured he was probably better off not knowing. She left him the keys, saying she had her own ride.
As he walked back to his apartment, he spotted an art store and decided to take a look. He hadn’t really been driven to draw since he woke up, with the brief exception of his time in Tony’s lab, but the shop intrigued him. He couldn’t believe all the new kinds of equipment and techniques. Paints, chalk, charcoal, pencils. It was all a little overwhelming, and the staff here weren’t nearly as helpful as the librarians had been. In the end, he decided to stick with just a sketchbook and some drawing pencils, then come back after he’d done more research.
To make up for my ever-so-cruel love realization cliffhanger from last chapter, I have a special treat for you! There will be a brief interlude in this chapter from Tony’s point of view. Also, I had a sort of realization that Pierce would know Bucky’s relationship with Steve, and that makes it unlikely that he’d just show off the Winter Soldier to Steve on a video feed, so we’re doing a handwave-y thing where Pierce doesn’t know who Bucky is. He just knows that he got this asset from the Russians. Instead, no one really knows what Bucky looks like. We’ll pretend that the Smithsonian exhibit doesn’t exist. Everyone’s image of Bucky just comes from the comics done about Captain America. Vague resemblance, but could sort of be any handsome brunet. Also, as the title implies, get ready for lots of feelings in this chapter!
“Now Tony,” Steve protested, blushing, “don’t exaggerate. Besides, Fitz seemed like he would do just about anything
“Peggy had a good day yesterday, and I think she solved pretty much all of our problems. Typical Peggy. What do you know about me?”
The team learns more about who is Hydra - and who isn't. Steve makes a new friend and figures out some things.
“I’m glad,” Steve said gently. “I, uh, I get the impression that you’re concerned about upsetting me. I’m glad Peggy got married. He would’ve had to have been pretty special for her to get married. She deserved special. But she and I weren’t… I wasn’t in love with her.” Tony’s head shot up from where he’d been staring at his desk. “She was the first dame – woman – I could really talk to, and I know that we got painted as sort of star-crossed lovers in a lot of the stories. And maybe, if things had been different, I would’ve loved her. I like to think we could’ve made each other happy. I’m sorry I never got to see all the amazing things she did. And I miss her… very much. But I don’t think she was really meant for me.” He’d gotten good at these sorts of half-truths a long time ago – talking about women without giving away that he had no real interest in them. He felt like he should tell Tony he was gay, but he wasn’t ready. But then again, maybe this was one of the things his future self had meant that he should trust Tony with. It had all just been easier with Clint, somehow. Clint had said something first, been ready to take on Captain America if it turned out that Captain America was a bigot. Still, trust Tony. Steve shook his head. “That was a lie.”
“No, I think I may actually be. Clint and Tony already know. Might as well add in Bruce, and Thor when he comes back. Do we have any idea where Hydra stands on gay rights? I might have to suck it up and stay in the closet if I’m going to pull off my undercover mission.”
. I don’t mean me. This isn’t a date. What about Kristen from statistics? If you asked her out, she’d probably say yes.”
"You're supposed to be discouraging my bad life decisions!" Pepper favours him with a wry look. "My parole officer already reamed me out bright and early this morning. Guess it was high on the to do list."
“Beth, please tell me this is actually a beneficial loss-leader,” Tony yells across the room, but he’s mostly kidding.
“Look again,” Rogers said gruffly, taking Tony firmly by the elbow. “People are gathered here with friends for food and drink, to partake in the holiday together in a bit of sensible and good-natured fun. You are getting sloshed all on your lonesome.”
As soon as the elevator doors open, the acrid stench of upset alpha floods the tiny chamber. There’s something wrong with it; it’s chemical, tinged with something noxious. The closest Steve’s ever smelled to how the Hulk smells is people who are sick with cancer and going through chemotherapy. But he supposes this is what Tony meant, when he’d implied that Bruce is intersex, too. Bruce is an omega. Hulk is alpha rage personified. His scent alone is almost enough to bring the average man to his knees.
Tony turned, jaw cracking uncomfortably as a yawn overtook him. He shook his head a little, wincing when the bar spun dangerously. “Sheriff.”
“I don’t think I can do this again,” Tony whispers, and Steve’s heart crumples in his chest. He reaches out to touch the skin at the back of Tony’s neck. It’s soft, he knows, from hugging Tony, because it’s the one spot he can touch Tony when he’s in the armour. It’s a place his hand is familiar with. He gets the barest impression of warmth against his fingertips, but he can’t touch Tony. His hand passes right through.
“Stay,” he murmured, mouth moving across Tony’s shoulders, up to the back of his ear. The barest hint of stubble scraped over the side of Tony’s throat, a delightful drag. Sheriff Rogers was always clean-shaven, clean-cut. It was a delight to see Steve, slow and lazy in the mornings, an early riser but often languid with it.
For a while they just kiss. Steve lets him do as he likes, fingers moving fitfully over Tony’s neck, shoulders, up and down his biceps. When Tony deepens the kiss he buries his fingers into Tony’s hair and moans for him, easy.
“Do it,” Tony says. Steve drives like a maniac on that bike of his, and he needs to talk to him ASAP. He glances out at the skyline. “Loki? If you’re listening, this would be an awesome time for you to show up and tell me what you know about what your old buddies are up to. I have a really fucking bad feeling about this.”
“Tony,” Carol says, and there’s a warning in it that Steve doesn’t understand. Fear, maybe. “Talk to me.”
“It’s what delivers spermatophores into the mantle of a female octopus. Or sometimes a male. We’ve observed that, too. It’s longer than all the rest, maybe because some octopodes engage in what’s called sexual cannibalism. And this here, at the end, is the ligula.” He curls the tentacle in so that Steve can look at it. The last few inches of it has no suckers, just a slightly plumper section vaguely in the shape of an elongated spade. The underside of the ligula is bright white: ridged, erect, and inflexible. “In other words, this is the closest thing I’ve got to a cock.”
him, but shouting at him mentally and verbally while he’d been on Tony’s screen hadn’t had any effect. He’d thought about trying to walk up to Xavier’s place, but quickly dismissed the idea after his the last time getting snapped back to Tony’s side like a rubber band. It was such a deeply unpleasant experience, and Steve isn’t really interested in trying it again soon. Maybe when he feels less like he’s going to throw up.
“You forced my hand,” Tony says, but his smile is wry, now. Something fond and potent that he doesn’t want to put a name to swells in his chest. “Thank you. Thank you so much. You have- well. No.” He laughs, disbelieving, smoothing a shaking hand over his face. “God. You do have an idea of what you did. You know exactly how important what you did for us is. For every enhanced, maybe, everywhere.”
“We have thousands of Asian-American employees,” Pepper says, but he knows that tone. She’s already giving in.
Tony nods. “It’ll come slow, and then it’ll hit you in the face,” he agrees. “That’s why it’s better to start treatment early. Take it from someone who refused; it’s the fucking worst to do it alone.”
been told it’s an excellent asset for a soldier to have in the field.” He leans down and slides an arm under Tony’s, pulling their torsos flush together. “Hmmm.”
“I want you to scream,” Loki says in a low voice, slipping one finger inside him. Tony bears down a little at the stretch, breathes deep. “I want to take you apart.”
Tony can’t keep his eyes open, but he doesn’t need to: the sight of Steve wrapped up in him is burned on his retinas. He’s going to remember this in vivid colour for the rest of his life. His climax takes him in a slow surge, waves of it, much longer than a human orgasm. His whole body tightens up, muscles clenching, and he can feel himself coming: endlessly, pumping again and again and again inside Steve’s hot, tight body. Steve’s moaning for it, his hole clenching in tandem, but he finishes much earlier than Tony. He can’t stop, waves of it crashing over him, building in intensity until Tony’s sobbing with pleasure, his face buried into the back of Steve’s ear, mouthing blindly at the skin there. Steve’s speaking, but Tony can’t parse language, and they stay like that for what feels like forever: Steve, pliant and trembling in Tony’s arms, his body a hot coal in contrast to the tepid water lapping at their ribs.
“Are you sure?” Thor asked, and Steve paused and glanced up at him. There was an uncanny shine in his eyes, some kind of shared grief that Steve could barely dare to look at. “We could take some wine onto the balcony, look at the mountains. It is a fine night.”
“It is 3:47 PM on Thursday, April 7th in New York City. You are currently in Avengers Tower, accompanied by Loki Laufeyson. You are in the penthouse. I have notified Agent Romanov of the situation, and she is on standby in the living room should you require her assistance. Shall I begin the count?”
Steve snorts, then winces, immediately regretting his choice. Tony does his best not to laugh at him.
“You like it when I work you open with nothing but my cock,” Tony murmurs, and Steve lets out a high, desperate sound of want. “But I’m a bit bigger like this.”
Tony frowns, then sits up in bed and glares at the nearest security camera. “Well that’s not fucking suspicious at all. What the hell, J?”
“Is that…a problem?” Steve asked, chest tightening. He moved towards the fridge, half because the noise was in fact getting annoying, but mostly to try to escape Tony’s sharp scrutiny. He pulled out the butter and the milk, then shut the door. “I know my nature was kind of a shock to everyone.”
Tony stares at him for longer than is polite, and Steve meets his gaze with his pulse thundering so loud he’s almost surprised Tony can’t hear it. He sets his jaw, tries to school his face into something less lovesick, and Tony’s expression shifts. His brow smooths out, and he turns back to his work. “Yeah, well. Guess he didn’t want to see it. A future that included queer liberation was already halfway here when he died.”
“I know I have a reputation for being kind of a slut,” he begins, but Steve holds a hand up to silence him.
,” Steve says, more packed into those two syllables than Tony had let him say in the whole nail-biting conversation that preceded the sex. It’s enough to make him concede his defeat, and he turns his head enough for Steve’s mouth to brush the outer shell of his ear. Steve obligingly nuzzles closer, lipping at the thin skin covering the cartilage, and Tony relaxes into his attentions with a soft sigh.
Loki narrows one eye, a scrunched expression spreading across his face that seems ill fit to his usual elegance. He’s relaxed, Tony realises, surprised. “It is better to hold something in reserve when you are at a disadvantage.”
“You’re a fucking miracle,” Tony gasped, still in the throes of his orgasm, and Steve hummed at the praise. The way it made Tony’s eyes roll back in his head was just a bonus. “Holy fucking shit, I’ve never- I mean, I knew it was a thing, I’m me, but no one’s ever…”
“I’m just saying, you know what’s coming, Tones. They’re already talking oversight. We’ve gotta get in front of this thing, and you need Ross on your side.”
Steve nodded, scraping the bottom of the container for the last few grains of rice. “That’s probably the smartest choice,” he agreed.
“You do know who you’re talking to, don’t you, Sheriff?” Tony shrugged, turning to the back door and unlocking it. “You coming?”
So maybe Tony had been right. Maybe there was a part of him that had been, how did he phrase it? Dedicated to Victorian-era pining from afar? He strokes his thumb over the papery skin of Tony’s wrist, uses Tony’s hand to cup his own cheek. He presses an apologetic kiss to the palm of his hand. He wishes more than anything that he could have the scent of Tony’s skin: warm salt, orange pumice soap, the fancy herbal-smelling shampoos and deodorants he uses. He closes his eyes, presses a kiss to Tony’s knuckles.
“I take it I am not welcome for this discussion,” he says, eyes sliding between the two of them as they settle together on the couch.
“Endearments are a privilege earned,” Loki agrees, inclining his head. “You are Stark’s general. I would expect no less.”
“You’re insatiable,” he said, and Steve tilted his face up to beam happily at him. “Eat some more gelato, you minx.”
“When he was dying, he gave Pepper his company and Rhodes his suit. I took it for recklessness,” Natasha said to him. He’d been pinned to the mat, panting, sweat beading his brow after a long sparring session. She was breathing hard, but wore her triumph like an old and well-loved coat. “I was wrong. I don’t make mistakes.”
Happy offers him a selection of Advil Liqui-Gels, Motrin, and Aspirin as soon as he climbs into the car. Tony swallows two Liqui-Gels dry and collapses back into the seat, letting his head loll against the plush leather.
“I can’t explain how looking at you like this makes me feel,” Tony admits. He lets go of Steve’s ass on to reach up and brush the tears away, smearing them into the streak of blood. On the other side, he presses his mouth to Steve’s cheek and licks the taste of them from his lips.
Steve had watched Tony flip his red AA chit back and forth over his knuckles for twenty minutes, helpless, angry. He’d eventually managed to catch Tony’s fingers in his own, which had startled the man enough that he jerked upright, the chip falling from his fingers and rolling to a stop on the floor. Then he’d called Carol, and she’d come over, and Tony had pulled out a little brown paper bag full of airtight canisters that Steve had never seen before. All these years, and he doesn’t think he’s ever seen Tony get high like this. He’s seen Tony already intoxicated, but watching this process feels unbearably intimate. Something about the look of it twists in his gut like an eel, desire and hurt curling over each other into this messy thing that aches and aches. He knows he shouldn’t be here for this. Carol was Tony’s go-to when he was having problems with Steve. It had been that way since the War, and he expects that it will continue to be so long into the future. Carol understands parts of Tony that Steve never has, parts that aren’t wholly encapsulated by the shared meaning of the chips they both carry with them, but are certainly representative of it. Carol or Tony might say that they are both fucked up in the same way: stubborn bastards with complex pasts, whose worst enemy is themselves. That was what Tony had said to Steve once, anyhow, when Steve had asked him about it. Maybe he’d been a little jealous. Nobody could prove anything.
"What would you know about it, Marty McFly? You've never been anything but the righteous little orphan Annie fighting bullies, come to save America from the big bad Nazi. You have a death count higher than the Chrysler and yet you still maintain your moral high horse because everybody knows eugenics are evil. Tell me, Captain, what's it like to be the living proof of this country's hypocrisy? We took a disabled orphan and let a German scientist turn him into the Übermensch, then let him loose on Hitler. Does your superhearing let you in on the dog whistle effect of the words 'perfect soldier', or has your blonde hair and blue eyes been called All-American too often for you to see that you're made of everything you were ever taught to hate about The Reich?"
Tony wakes up with tacky morning breath in his mouth, bleariness overtaking the anodyne of sleep. A quiet alarm is sounding, and he sits up in bed to see the hulking planes of Steve’s shoulders bunching under thin cotton. He’s reaching for the bedside table, and Tony’s chest splits open with a dizzying spill of embarrassment, desire, and relief at the memory of last night. Everything’s out in the open and no one tried to kill anyone else. Steve kissed him. They cuddled. It was…nice.
“The bits of it you like enough to keep,” Steve says, wryly. “So you don’t think it would be good for me, either?”
“I gave my word I did not intend you harm,” Loki says, some of the desperation leaving him for wariness, and Tony turns his head to suck Loki’s thumb into his mouth. He’s rewarded with those sharp eyes lowering to half mast, and he licks at the pad of Loki’s thumb and drags his teeth against it. Loki surges up to kiss him again, brutal this time, and Tony bites at his lower lip in retaliation. He freezes when Loki lets out a low moan, then does it again.
There’s a chorus of boos and laughter from the assembled group, and Steve grins at his family as they heckle him.
Because, what, they’re…both men? That Steve hit him because he didn’t love him enough, didn’t love him the way he would love a woman?
“I just-” Tony’s voice is breaking, now. His fingers are bone white under the flaking bloodstains. It’s Steve’s blood, of course: still dried under his fingernails, caught in the grooves of his calluses. Steve watches him clutch at Carol’s biceps, the leather of her jacket creaking under his fingers, and feels the clench of Tony’s hands around his heart. “Why couldn’t he stay?”
“Stop. Just, stop that,” he said, putting the bowls on the chair. He leaned down, shifting Rogers up on the pillows and sitting on the bed, one knee tucked up between them. He pulled one bowl to him, dipping the spoon in and feeding Rogers the first bite.
“Will you not speak to your assassin, then? Your captain? Perhaps your monster? If you do not trust your Avengers, then who do you trust, Tony Stark? Or is it only the fair Miss Potts that holds your regard?” The way his lips twist sneeringly over Pepper’s name makes Tony shiver.
Stephen glances around them, raising a single eyebrow. Then he shakes his head, and settles into a floating, cross-legged position. “I take it you are required for the parade?”
He spreads his legs wide, wrists crossed over his head, and a shiver runs through him at the low growl Loki releases, drinking in the sight of him. Tony tilts his hips invitingly, and Loki wraps one hand around his cock and bends him nearly in half with the other, casual strength pushing Tony’s thigh up so he can lick at the sensitive patch of skin behind Tony’s balls. Tony groans, startled, then gasps at the first cool touch of Loki’s fingers to his arse.
“And whose choice was that?” Steve asks mildly. He glances around, then circles back to the trash can on the corner. He peers down into the bin, then smiles and rolls up his sleeves. “Nice.”
Surprise breaks over Tony’s face like a wave cresting smooth rocks. “A surprisingly sentimental reason from you, Hill.”
“I do not know that I would go that far,” Loki says, slowly. “But we have been allied. We understand one another.”
. I know this is not what you were imagining lol but it was a comment that helped me get unstuck when I couldn't figure out what the hell to do with this fic. Even when I don't reply immediately to comments I read them in my email inbox and they really hep me a lot.
Steve lifts his head. There, in the doorway, Tony is staring right at him. The expression on his face is one Steve hasn’t seen before, even in over a decade of friendship. Tony looks…haunted, is really the only word Steve might use to describe it. He looks like he’s seen a ghost.
Steve shrugs, glancing back into his now empty bowl. “Just normal people writing about their own experiences—omegas, and, uh. Trans-natured people? Blogs, I think they’re called? There’s this website where people talk about this stuff a lot, called Tumblr-”
Steve is saying something, muffled into his collarbones, and Tony tilts his head to hear him better.
“Tony,” Steve says, sounding resigned, and Tony turns to him with a broad, plastic grin. “What is he talking about?”
“Oh,” Tony gasps, and Steve can’t help it. He glances up to look at Tony’s face, and it feels like all of the blood in his body rushes to an organ that he doesn’t currently have any meaningful ability to use. There’s a fine sheen of sweat on Tony’s brow, limning him in the light. His mouth is open, tongue slipping out to touch the corner, and Steve has a sudden visceral memory of how it felt to kiss him, to taste the startled sound he’d made in that dark, cold room. Tony’s got one hand on his cock and his other-
“She’s like a mini-Tony,” Steve muttered, “complete with the lying about his injuries and the casual bragging about impossible feats and the qualms about killing anyone, including actual Nazis. I can barely handle the one I’ve got.”
“I love you,” he said, staring hard at the camera. “Nothing will change that, unless you tell me you don’t want me. I told you, remember? Don’t-” His voice broke, and he swiped a hand over his face, gathering himself. “I love you. Don’t forget.”
“Okay,” he hears himself saying. He swallows, then nods to himself. “Okay. But you didn’t answer my question, Professor. Am I cleared for the field?”
He knows what the professor is going to show him, and it hurts before he even sees it. Tony had flown into a building so thoroughly wrecked that the remaining top two floors were tilted at a 45 degree angle. It had been a school, and while some of the children had been able to be evacuated, some of them had been trapped by broken legs or other injuries, or blocked in by the sheer instability of the building.
A tug, and then something he can’t describe; like the non-Euclidean geometry of the Chitauri mass, maybe, or the unsettling feeling of numbness and pressure that had washed over him as he passed through the portal to space. He closes his eyes, and when he opens them he’s standing on the tower landing pad in Manhattan, as though nothing had happened and he’d never left.
“Too soon?” Steve shakes his head at him, and Tony waves a hand at the elevator walls. “In or out, Cap. Them’s the breaks.”
Not once does Reed ever even hint that Tony might be delusional. It is, perhaps, the kindest thing Steve has ever seen him do. But then, he isn’t sure that Reed would have thought to be kind in that way. Perhaps that’s what Tony finds so comforting about it; Reed does not typically have the emotional intelligence to dissemble. Instead, he throws himself into the data Tony has compiled with the kind of reckless abandon that Reed approaches any scientific inquiry.
“Can I send Loki to bother you with his intel?” Tony asks, widening his eyes in what he’s been told is a very fetching begging expression, and Bruce rubs at his mouth tiredly.
Tony raises an eyebrow. He pulls his head back away from the armour, turns to look at the holoscreen.
“Dork,” Tony mutters. He holds it carefully between his fingers and takes it to the pegboard on the wall, then pauses, the pin about to puncture the paper. “J, how fast can we frame this?”
Steve doesn’t sleep well, but he knew he wouldn’t. Instead he tries to map out where to go from here, or maybe where he went wrong. He hadn’t been prepared for Tony to cut into his feelings, the tension strung between them like taffy, gooey and sweet. It kept shifting under his feet, churning like the gears of the pull, always leaving him unsure of the ground. He was positive he wouldn’t have lashed out at Tony like that if he hadn’t been so raw from Amora’s spell. That had been a tactical error on his part. He should have waited longer. He knew what Tony was like when he was cornered, but Tony had been so cold and he’d just wanted…he’d just
Soooo, I meant to write more for this chapter but I ended up writing a lot of smut? It’s way over the rating I’ve put for this story and includes some CNC, so I decided to shift it over to its own one-shot in the collection. If you’re into that sort of thing, consider this only half of the chapter and move over to the next part of the collection (I will add a hyperlink) where you can enjoy 5k words of filth. :D Comments, as always, greatly appreciated. I try to reply to everything but sometimes I miss one or two, so I’m sorry if that’s the case! Do know that I appreciate and read them all.
Steve swallows. His eyes feet hot and swollen with unshed tears. He’s never heard the scripture like this; plain and easy, coming into him like a song. It’s beautiful.
This is the bit where I out myself as a DV survivor. The right to ownership of experience is paramount, for me, especially taking personal experience into account. Some people feel being spanked as a kid for running into the street is abuse, or even their parents yelling at them. Some people don’t, and think their parents were great despite (or even because of) these things. I have a very cut and dry, bruises and broken bones experience, but I also experienced the former, which I do not count as part of my trauma. Not everyone feels the same way. All experiences are valid.
“Maya Hansen? What on earth does a botanist want with me? I mean besides the obvious.” Tony winked at the rest of the room.
Steve didn’t miss how down on himself Tony seemed. “So you’re telling me that Hydra shouldn’t recruit you because if you know what’s going on, you want to do the right thing.”
“Do you see Tony at all?” Steve asked, taking one of the recommended appetisers and humming in surprise at the taste. It was both sweet and savoury, some sort of compote mixed in with the musk of organ meat. Tony always went a little crazy at his parties, and the SI Holiday Party was notoriously extravagant. Apparently there were even celebrities who wanted in, but Tony was pretty firm about the fact that this was for the employees. They even had a little red carpet with professional photographers, so everyone could come and pose and get their photo taken. It was sweet, watching groups of awkward coders posing together in their fanciest clothes. Tony could be so sweet.
Bruce had been a hard-line advocate for the cells, but then again, Bruce didn’t trust himself. Together, they’d worked on a cell for Hulk, dug deep into the lowest sub-basement that Tony could get cleared by the city zoning commission. He told them it was built to house a laboratory that would be dealing with energy testing, with a small potential for high-payload explosions. With the arc reactor being what it was, it was easy for people to believe that Tony needed a space that could hold in a small nuclear-level blast. Tony had pioneered hard light forcefields for the Hulk’s cell, with their structure heavily based on vibranium. The knockoff was what he’d given to SHIELD, which had ultimately ended up being used for the Pleasant Hill project.
“I dunno,” Jamie Gaughan from Marketing says, looking a little conflicted. He’s actually Irish from Ireland, and speaks a handful of Gaelic, which Tony finds pretty hot honestly. That’s probably problematic, or something, so he isn’t going to say anything about it. Pepper looks like she knows, anyway. “Isn’t that…trading on stereotypes?”
“I don’t think it’s a ‘schoolboy crush’ when you are in a relationship, sir.” JARVIS’ voice is gentle as Tony’s ever heard it. “This is hard for you, but I am not sure I understand why.”
Loki laughs, light and pattering, like hail on a tin roof. His teeth flash blindingly white. "Is that so?" he says. He takes a deep draught of his scotch, long fingers tightening on the glass.
Tony laughs out loud, even as his cock twitches painfully in his boxers. “That’ll teach you to try to out-seduce an infamous, world-reviled libertine,” he calls, gleeful. The shower turns on, and he grins up at the ceiling. “Point one to me. Make a note, J.”
Steve wrenches his mouth away with a wet sound that curls hot and writhing in the pit of Tony’s belly. His eyes are huge in his face.
“What-?” Clint talks right over him, but that’s alright; he’s used to that, these days, and Steve is pretty sure he already knows the answer.
“You tell me,” Bruce sighs, his hands twisting together in that familiar, nervous way. It makes Tony’s chest ache to see it. “What’s the last thing you remember?”
“I have need of you still,” Loki parries, but his voice is soft. He presses a quick kiss to Tony’s lips, then moves to stand, pulling Tony up with him as though he’s made of paper. “Your assassin will become restless, and you have repairs to make.”
“After what happened with Hydra, Captain Rogers has made his position on answering to SHIELD again very clear.” Coulson says tiredly. He glances at Tony, face placid, and Tony reads the unspoken question there; why wasn’t Steve with him? Tony stares back. “Not unfairly, I suppose, but that’s off the table.”
Peter, in typical Peter fashion, crawls right over the kitchen island and back down the other side. He crouches by Tony’s splayed legs, his head swaying back and forth as he surveys the kitchen. Steve’s too exhausted to try the rubber band method right now, so he settles for trying ineffectually to rub a comforting hand over Tony’s shin.
Tony opened his mouth, closed it again. They’d only been doing this for two months, this dating thing, and now they were on assignment in Chengdu, looking for someone who was manufacturing counterfeit Stark tech and lacing it with an absolutely nasty virus. It had been a rough three days with no sleep, two firefights, and a car chase, and Tony looked absolutely beat to hell. He would never admit it, though. Sometimes Steve thought Tony’s alpha posturing would be the death of him, but then he knew there wasn’t much space for him to throw stones. He was just as bad, half the time.
“I know.” He points at Bruce. “The other guy’s got Moonstone. She’s pretty hard to keep down, so we don’t have to worry so much about killing her. War Machine will be split between Barnes and doombot patrol. If you take down your target, join me in the compound. There’s a few human combatants inside, nothing I can’t handle, but we have no idea what state Cap is gonna be in when we get there. JARVIS has run scans and thinks he knows where they’re keeping him. The Iron Legion will be running assists wherever they’re needed and to whomever needs them. This is a rescue mission, first and foremost. No heroics, quick and dirty. We’re not working for arrests; SHIELD has no jurisdiction. We’re in, we find Cap, we’re out.”
Tony exhales slowly, laying the last of the apple slices down. Clint is watching him, and Tony slides over so he can get to the rest of the pie crust, which he begins to cut into inch wide ribbons. Tony licks the last of the sweetness from his fingers and turns to wash his hands.
But he understands him, is the thing. Some days, it feels like he understands Loki better than he had ever understood Steve.
“Oh, I know,” he drawled, eyes dragging slow over Steve’s body, and Steve huffed. “I just meant, uh. You’re…I guess I never imagined you’d be into the traditional alpha/omega thing.”
Something was shifting over Tony’s face now, first fear, then resignation, then something like calculation. Steve watched as he pulled his pants up, tucking his shirt back in, redoing the button. He watched as Tony reassembled his mask.
“I was created to serve Sir,” JARVIS says, voice uncharacteristically robotic, but Steve shakes his head. He knows JARVIS will be watching from every camera.
Moving is strange in this new body. Everything is rough and painfully dry against his skin. He should probably get into a tub, and soon.
“Helicarriers that go up and never come down and can easily kill a whole lot of people really fast,” Tony replied.
“Clint recruited me for SHIELD in the fall of 2000. Before that, I was in the Red Room and working for the KGB in Russia. I was trained there from the age of 5, believing utterly in my cause. They did a lot of things to us there. Almost everyone thinks that Clint was my first real taste of kindness, but he wasn’t. A few years before he showed up, I was assigned a new teacher and told that I would become his field partner. The Soldier. At first, he was even colder than I’d been trained to be. He was not hiding his emotions; he was truly emotionless. I found out later he’d been brainwashed over and over and over. But the longer he trained me and the more we worked together, the more human he – we both – became. I fell in love – what I thought was love, at least. Though I was never innocent, I loved this older man with all the innocence of youth. He was the first time I ever felt anything resembling safety. He didn’t love me back, of course – I was a child – but he felt something for me that broke some of their programming of him. Perhaps he thought of me as something like a sister. Oh, he still followed orders, but he was kinder to me than they would have deemed necessary. His affection for me was discovered, of course. He was taken from me, I don’t know where. I didn’t see him again until a few years ago, I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran. Someone shot out our tires and we went over a cliff. I pulled the engineer out, but he was standing there. I was covering the engineer with my body, but the Soldier shot him through me. He didn’t recognize me at all. I called him Yasha. I learned in your apartment yesterday that his real name was James Buchanan Barnes. I’m not sure how that’s possible, but the picture in your apartment is my Soldier. I’m sure of it.”
“God, isn’t that just like dear old Dad. So desperate for science that he completely ignored all the possible consequences. He got in bed with Red Skull’s best friend, and for what? What could he possibly have had that was worth it?”
The build up to this question took a lot longer than 24 hours, but as Steve looked across the table at Tony in the restaurant where they'd had their first date, Steve knew that asking Tony to marry him would take that first date's place as the best thing he ever asked for.
“Why do they have to call him a consultant if he’s an Avenger?” Steve asked, not letting it drop. “I mean yeah, it’s not like he needs to live in the shitty apartments, but still. It’s the principle. Don’t the unions put a stop to that sort of thing?”
“We will, Tony, I promise. Good news is that it looks like Thor and Jim saved the President. Must be something else happening there, though, or they would’ve checked in already. Now, where are your suits? I was promised backup.”
“No, no, that’s okay,” Steve rushed to say, cursing the blush he could feel on his pale Irish skin. “I’ll just get something back at the base. I’ve taken up too much of your time, anyway. I’ll see if I can get Natasha and Clint to eat with me. Maybe Thor. I bet he eats a lot, too. After something like the battle, I just can’t keep up with my metabolism. I’ll leave you both alone now.” He could tell he was rambling, but couldn’t do anything to stop it. He’d always been like this around pretty women. “Ma’am, it was lovely to meet you. I’m so sorry for disturbing you.” With that, he vanished, Pepper and Tony blinking after him.
Steve chuckled, silently thanking Natasha for preparing him for this. “It’s with Stark, for the moment. I’m letting him and Banner do a little investigation for me. Besides, I figured taking it from you would get your leader’s attention. Feel free to tell Pierce I’m open to a chat.”
Steve cleared his throat. "Before I tell you any of this, I'd like your word that you won't tell SHIELD – not even Fury – and you won't discuss it anywhere other than this building. The reason why is part of the story, but I need your word first."
"She may not have been," said Natasha, "but she didn't found SHIELD by herself. She would've had to make compromises."
"Okay, so we're looking for specific recruiter type connections, not just any kind. With the additional data from you two, plus the junior Carter, we should be able to get a start. Anyone recruited by Agent is probably good.” Tony’s voice softened at the mention of Coulson.
The whole team met in the common room a couple of days later when Tony asked for them. He didn’t wait for them to get settled before he started talking. “So Fury called. He’d like to call in the consultant. And by that I mean me. He wants me to build him stuff.”
“What? Sure, Chinese food is fine, J, order something. But why aren’t you upset? Didn’t you ask this guy out? I feel like I would be disappointed if I asked someone out only for them to hit on my friend.”
Steve went down to Tony’s lab the next day with breakfast after learning from JARVIS that Tony hadn’t eaten since lunch the day before. He looked somehow both tired and wired. His hair was sticking up everywhere and he had bags under his eyes, but his movement never slowed. Tony didn’t seem surprised to see him, and instead of talking, just dragged him over to a stool.
He laughed. "Not exactly. There was a major incident, and they called both of us in, and, well, anyway, we're a team now. We're sort of working with SHIELD rather than for them. Do you remember Arnim Zola?"
“Thank you, JARVIS,” Steve said. Then he turned to Natasha and Clint. “I’d like to bring him in. He’s someone everyone trusts.”
"Couldn't help but follow in your footsteps, huh?" He asked with a grin. Peggy had solved his two biggest problems in no time at all. "I missed you. My new team is great, but they're still settling in and getting used to each other. They're not quite a team yet."
Steve’s favorite was when Tony talked him through various new tech – they covered everything from smartphones and video games to armor and weapons for the team. He loved the way Tony lit up and bounced when he talked tech. He talked with his whole body and leaned into the role of instructor. He seemed to appreciate how quickly Steve picked things up and laughed when Steve groused about the lack of help SHIELD had been. When Tony asked, Steve handed over his phone to let Tony tinker with it. He promised that SHIELD would no longer be able to monitor Steve’s phone usage, and they’d only hear conversations that Steve had in otherwise monitored locations. “Won’t Fury be suspicious if they suddenly can’t see what I’m doing anymore?”
Steve blushed and groaned. “Come on, Tony. It wasn’t my idea. I talked to the hospital administrator and she had the kids vote. They thought it was funny.”
He sighed. “I can’t sing. Or dance. Or walk away from a fight. It has occasionally been pointed out to me that I’m stubborn. I get a little tunnel vision about things that are important to me. I expect that would sometimes include my work instead of whoever I was dating at the time. I tend to see things in black and white. You want me to keep going, or can you come up with some yourself?”
Steve was disappointed, as the hope that had barely had time to flicker died. “I’m sorry to hear about Edwin. He was a good man and a friend. It says a lot that Tony would create a whole system to honor him.” Steve paused, thinking about the rest of what JARVIS had said, and he decided that this new JARVIS could be helpful, hoping he could be friends with JARVIS, as he had been with Edwin. “Say, if you monitor the Tower all the time, do you think you could please help me figure out where Loki went? Or why he left the scepter?”
At that, Rhodey stopped staring at Steve and narrowed his eyes at Tony. “You want me to snap out of it? Fine. Did you go to the hospital? How much sleep did you get last night? Have you eaten anything today?”
“Miss Potts? This is Steve Rogers.” He saw Tony smirk slightly. “I’m going to have Natasha Romanoff and Clint Barton come out to you. They’ll get some more information from Miss Hansen and make sure the two of you are safe. Will you let us know if anything else happens?” As soon as Steve finished, Natasha and Clint nodded and headed for the roof.
In addition to his drawing, the team’s movie nights, his regular training, and his attempts to catch up on 70 years of missed popular culture, Steve started sparring regularly with Natasha. He was actually pretty excited about it. He’d never had time for formal training – he’d gone right from the lab to the chorus line to Nazi Germany. Thanks to the serum, he’d managed just fine. His reflexes, flexibility, and strength were all heightened, and he’d always had a mind for strategy. Up until the Battle of New York, as it was being called, he’d only ever fought against the Red Skull and people weaker than him. He hadn’t really needed to be a superior fighter, but now, he knew he needed every advantage he could get. Natasha, on the other hand, often fought against people physically stronger than her – she hadn’t even hesitated to fight the aliens with enhanced strength – but her prodigious skill allowed her to best nearly anyone.
“I mean I saw you on the news, but it’s still pretty surreal.” Rhodey finally seemed to notice that Steve was saluting him. “At ease. Jeez. And don’t salute me. It’s weird.” He turned to Tony. “Captain America just saluted me.”
Occasionally, they did talk. Steve could tell that Tony’s favorite stories were the ones Steve told about Edwin Jarvis. He worried sometimes that when he ran out, he’d have nothing left to say that Tony would want to hear, but that turned out to be wrong. Tony also loved hearing about the scrapes he and Bucky had gotten into and the ones Steve got into while Bucky wasn’t paying attention (“And to think that I would’ve thought signing up for a top-secret government experiment would top the list,” Tony said wryly).
Rhodey took it with a look of mild disbelief. “The pleasure is all mine, Captain. You can call me Jim. Or Rhodey, since that’s what Tony calls me.”
Steve chuckled. “Pretty much. She gave me a hard time over that, too. So that solves that problem. The other thing she mentioned is that she has a great-niece at SHIELD – Sharon – who apparently doesn’t advertise that she’s related to the co-founder. I’m having dinner with her tonight at the hotel so I can fill her in.”
Natasha, wasn’t looking at them, but at the screen. “Future you is a much better fighter. You’re lucky he didn’t want to kill you. I believe now that we’re friends. There are some moves I don’t show just any trainee,” she smirked at him.
“She shot Sitwell? That might be a good sign. Long story short, Hydra is inside SHIELD. Future-me didn’t tell me that. He impersonated Hydra to steal Loki’s scepter from Rumlow and Sitwell, which we found out recently, when Rumlow said ‘Hail Hydra’ to me in the SHIELD locker room. We’re trying to separate loyal SHIELD agents from Hydra double agents.”
“I didn’t exactly anticipate fighting the god of thunder on an airplane. I made the extremely reasonable decision to escape with my life,” countered the man in the armor.
They chatted for another couple of minutes, until Sam came back. “I told Jim where the ambulance is going to take you guys. He’s going to meet you at the hospital. He promised to call your assistant. He says he loves you and not to worry about the wedding.”
“There will be no discussions of emotions, Rogers.” He softened his words with a hand on Steve’s shoulder. “We have a lot of work to do. I know that you want to rescue Rapunzel, but we have to have a coordinated strike.”
“Your facade is secure, sir. What I’m about to share with you isn’t widely known. At least not among anyone alive. I certainly haven’t mentioned it to Fury. It’s not just my muscles and healing that are enhanced. My senses are too. I can hear people whispering two or three rooms away, depending on background noise. Some of your agents are chatty when they’re alone.”
"Did you miss the part about future semi-thieves beating the shit out of us?" Tony interjected. "Because Captain America being all rah-rah team spirit isn't all that surprising to me."
Tony gave a half-smile of his own and returned the handshake. “Should I sit down for this? Or maybe a drink is in order?”
“Right. So I’ve seen you strategize in real-time. You analyzed everyone’s capabilities and made split-second decisions that allowed six people to fight an entire army of aliens, plus one demi-god with daddy issues. You have the capability to think on your feet. What you lack is confidence. We’re going to practice.”
Tony’s voice was breathy now, and Steve hadn’t done this in a long time – since before the serum, really – but he didn’t think he was misreading the signals. He stared at Tony’s mouth for a moment, then reached one hand up to Tony’s face, cupping his cheek gently, ever mindful of his own strength. He heard Tony’s breath catch, decided to take that as a good sign, and leaned in slowly. Finally, his mouth touched Tony’s, softly, not wanting to push too hard. Tony seemed to have other ideas. As soon as their lips met, he pushed up on his toes, leaning more fully into Steve and putting one hand on Steve’s neck and the other on his hip. He tilted his head and let his lips part, inviting Steve in. It wasn’t an invitation Steve could resist. He dove into the kiss and brought his other hand to the small of Tony’s back, pulling him in gently, his heart pounding so loudly in his ears now that he almost couldn’t hear Tony’s soft moan of pleasure.
Fury sighed. “I’m sorry about how it had to be done. Bringing him back was… complicated. I didn’t know if it would work for a long time. Then once he was back…”
You’re starting on musical education without me? J, throw on some Black Sabbath. I can’t leave something this important to a guy who shoots arrows for a living. Okay, music can stay on in the background while we work through the phone how-to.”
“The message from the future, the thing about myself that no one else knew was who my first crush was. My first crush that I never told anyone about, not even Bucky. I never told anyone because I couldn’t.” Steve could see the tiny changes in Tony’s expression as he started to connect the dots. “I couldn’t tell anyone that the first person I liked as more than a friend was named Matthew.”
“Not long. Long enough to hear what sounded like you trying to recruit Jim. It’s a great idea. Even if he can’t be here full-time, it’s never bad having someone high up in the military complex in the know.”
Natasha continued to stare at him as though she were analyzing everything in him. "Call the rest of the team. We'll debrief tomorrow before Indian food and movie night. Let Clint pick the movie to make up for telling me first. Stark, I'll see you then." She paused. "Are you ready to go… Steve?"
"Your bed is too soft. When I was over there, I was sleeping on the ground. Using rocks for pillows like a caveman. Then I come back, I'm home, lying in my bed and it's like…"
“Because they didn’t cease to exist when the Red Skull did. Zola brought them over when SHIELD recruited him. He worked for SHIELD because they thought he could help them with the serum. Instead, he rebuilt Hydra within SHIELD. There are thousands of SHIELD agents. Hundreds of them are actually Hydra. Including John Garrett.”
As they walked over, they heard Tony. “Look, I’m just saying I have a lot of practice keeping my stuff out of the hands of the government. Tell Jane that if anyone gives her any trouble, she can give me a call. Scientists have got to stick together. And she’s one of the best. Ah, our SHIELD contingent is here. Well SHIELD and shield,” he mimed holding up a shield and gestured at Steve on the last word. “Who wants a drink?"
“Well, yes, but only to get his password so I could read some files. It’s not like I told him where I was. Look, we can talk about that later. The point is, the guy on the TV is not the Mandarin. It’s actually – ”
“I”m not having this fight with you again. Jim and I are fine to pay for our own wedding. Your wedding gift can be not getting into any trouble while we’re away on our honeymoon.”
“Wow. Winter Soldier. Fist of Hydra. Sounds like I gotta get myself a new PR person. Captain America seems a little plain next to that.” He tried a wry grin and felt himself relax a little when Pierce laughed.
“Well I can’t say I followed the reference at the end,” Steve’s lips quirked, “but then, future me said I’d almost never understand you. The rest of it seems right. If it’s alright with you, I’d also like to talk about something he didn’t say. He was very clear to tell me to trust you and the rest of the team, which I assume includes Thor, Dr. Banner, Natasha, and Clint. He didn’t tell me to trust anyone else. He didn’t tell me to trust Fury or SHIELD. Unless I’ve changed a helluva lot, I think that’s an intentional omission. If I went back to pre-serum me, I’d tell him to trust the Howling Commandos, sure, but I’d also tell him to trust Phillips, Erskine, Howard, Peggy, and the rest of the SSR. I tend to have some… slight issues with authority. I was a rebel long before I was a soldier. I guess what I’m saying is that I’d like to keep this between the team until we have a better idea of what could be going on. Especially after that nuke,” he concluded with a nod to Tony.
"Yeah, Bucky was the one always reading those science fiction novels. He thought Howard's stuff was the best. Your lab would make him lose his mind." Steve cleared his throat. "I've been meaning to tell you, I'm sorry about your parents. I never met your mother, but I've seen pictures – you look like her. And Edwin. JARVIS said he died as well. He was a good man."
“Son of a bitch. God damn Garrett. I trusted him. Fuck.” He took a deep breath and Steve could see as he changed from Trip to Agent Triplett. “Okay, so why are you telling me? Are you going door-to-door to every real SHIELD agent’s mother’s house? Like a tall Girl Scout selling horrifying news?”
Over the next several days, he convinced Bruce that he’d never been kissed (“No one paid me any attention before the serum, especially when I was standing next to Bucky. After the serum, there were a lot more important things happening than kissing.”), Tony that he’d never dressed up for Halloween (“We were broke nearly all of the time. Why on earth would I waste money on a costume?”), and Clint that his birthday wasn’t really the fourth of July (“Come on, Clint, what better propaganda is there than a Captain America born on the Fourth?”). Once he got used to it, it was actually a little bit fun trading on the Captain America everyone thought they knew.
Steve and Natasha head over to Stark Tower, Steve meets another important person in Tony's life, and Steve and Clint have an interesting chat.
Steve made himself turn away from the suits to face Tony. “Actually, I’m here for two reasons. The first is to apologize for everything I said on the helicarrier. You are a hero, and you deserve my respect.”
He jumped but managed to regain his composure pretty quickly. “Oh, thanks. Now that I actually live here, I’ve gotten better at drawing you guys.” No need to mention that there might’ve been a slightly higher proportion of drawings of Tony.
"See there are levels. Higher levels get more info. Fury is 10. Hill and Coulson are 9, you're 8. The superspies are both level 7. You don't get, like, memos on all the stuff you're cleared to know, but you can mostly access it. I hacked up high enough. Coulson surviving is level 7 data."
Fury nodded as though he’d expected as much. “We’ll be happy to set up some scheduled training for you and set aside time in the conference – ”
Tony grinned. “You mean besides the alien weapons of mass destruction? No worries, I left a bug on SHIELD’s servers, in addition to the one Fury saw while we were there. I’ll let you know if I find anything interesting. Here’s the flip side of tech. SHIELD is almost certainly monitoring you if you’re living on site. Probably even if you’re not. They’ll also have bugged that ridiculous brick you call a phone. If you’re serious about secrecy, you’re gonna have to let me hook you up, and you can’t discuss anything anywhere on SHIELD property. They have eyes and ears everywhere, just like I do in this building.”
Steve looked around. "Look, you've got no reason to follow my lead here, but it seems to me that if that's the only advice future me gives, it's awfully important. He seemed like he trusted you all, both on and off the field, but something about how he said it made me think that the trust took a little too long and something slipped through the cracks in the meantime. I know this doesn't automatically make us a team, but I'd like us to be." He cleared his throat. "Anyway, that's where we are."
“I’ll build in a backdoor, no big deal. Don’t worry, big guy.” Tony clapped Bruce on the shoulder. “There’s no way they could change
During his time in the SHIELD gym with Natasha and occasionally Clint, Steve ran into SHIELD agents all the time. They all knew Natasha and Clint, and they at least knew
Natasha brushed this off with a graceful wave of her hand. "I don't know the details, obviously, but it seems to me that at some point in the future, you – or maybe we – need some sort of major power source, and they came back to borrow these. Since they've apparently mastered time travel – thought apparently not theft, considering the debacle with the tesseract – they just brought it back when they were done. Makes sense. I don't think they beat the shit out of you intentionally; you were just in the way. You're sure it was really you? The last thing we need is to be taking directions from the enemy."
Tony answered first. “Yeah, he does, but he decided to let the Air Force outfit it with substandard Hammer weapons.”
Steve squeezed his shoulder gently, then moved back to sit on the couch next to Tony. “Have a seat, Phil. Just after the Battle of New York, I fought someone who looked like me. I thought he was Loki, but as it turned out, he was me from the future. He told me that Bucky – James –”
Steve just stared at him. “Going on? Where?” His brain finally clicked through modern vernacular, more slowly than he thought it should, considering the beer didn’t affect him. “OH. No. There is no there, there. We’re not together.” He paused, filtering the evening through a new lens. “Why, you gonna make a move?”
"I believe that Loki was acting under the influence of the scepter." Now, it was Clint who tightened. Steve could see Thor register the discomfort, but he continued, "he was promised an army by someone, and gifted with the scepter at the same time. He is prone to mischief, but not on this scale. If it is agreeable, I would pursue him alone."
“I can count on one hand the number of people who really saw me.” Steve paused to look her up and down. “I suspect maybe you know a little of what that’s like. My mother worked herself to death trying to keep me alive after my father died. She took the jobs and shifts no one else wanted to keep food on the table and enough medicine to try and fix what was wrong with me. She did her best, but she wouldn’t’ve managed it without Bucky. While she was killing herself on the job, Bucky was pulling me outta fights I couldn’t win. Everybody loved Bucky. Clint wasn’t wrong when he said Bucky was pretty, though Buck might’ve objected to the word. He was tough and smart and handsome and charming. The dames loved him and the guys wanted to be him, hoping some of that magic might wear off, just a little. And he dragged me right along with him. Every date he went on, he got her to bring a friend so we could double. Every bully I picked a fight with, Bucky fought with, too. Right up to and including the Red Skull. The day I really became Captain America is the day I decided to go behind enemy lines, against orders, to rescue him when he was probably already dead. Howard Stark flew me over, and I jumped out of a plane that was being shot at and went up to a Hydra base armed with nothing but a prop shield to save him. It was crazy. I figured I might die. But for Bucky, I was willing to leave it all on the field, because I knew he woulda for me. I found him laying on a table where Zola had been experimenting on him or torturing him, I don't know which, mumbling his name, rank, and serial number over and over again. When we got back to camp, he followed me, same as always, hauling me outta trouble. He fell off a train in the mountains on a mission. After the serum, I thought that wouldn't happen anymore. Being too slow or too weak. But it did. All the times he saved me, and when I could finally keep up, I couldn't save him."
Tony stares hard at her, trying to see the trick. He taps a finger against his thigh, then points a disbelieving finger at her. “Is this…an apology?”
“Iron-Man, Hasegawa is a no show,” Widow says, sounding winded. “Barnes is down and secured, should be long enough to finish up here. Entering the compound now.”
A half smile quirks up one corner of Steve’s mouth, although he can taste how bitter it is. “Tony, you remember what I said when I heard Hasegawa was dead?”
“I missed you,” he whispered, hands clenching helplessly in his lap against the urge to touch and take. He wanted to be good for Tony. He’d be good for him. “I missed you so much, I nearly went crazy with it.”
Tony huffs, but there’s a smile in it. Steve doesn’t need to turn his head to see it. He knows Tony, maybe better than anyone. He can see his rueful, pained smile in his mind as easy as anything.
They lay there spent for a few minutes, Steve weakly combing his fingers through Tony’s hair. He was absolutely high as a kite on endorphins, and when Tony’s knot finally released and began to go down, the loss made him shiver with want.
“Bigger fish to fry,” Tony reminds him, and Steve nods. His fingers trail down the inside of Tony’s thigh, gentle and warm. “Steve. It’s alright.”
The last thing he hears before he loses consciousness is the sound of Tony whispering his name: over and over again, soft and reverent, like he’s counting beads on a rosary.
“Tony, do not mistake me. Just because he is Captain America, does not mean you have to let this stand. You have rights. People who will protect you.” He winces, then, taking a long draught from his cup as Tony blinks at him, completely baffled. “I must admit, I don’t understand why you didn’t say something at the start, but you are notorious for hiding your hurts. I suppose I am not so surprised, after all.”
“I’ll have someone drop us off, parking in midtown is such a bitch,” he says, and Steve shakes himself and follows behind him.
Tony comes back to himself in pieces. He’s out over the open ocean, the sun glimmering off of the waves in bright sparkles of golden light. It’s early afternoon, bright and beautiful. There’s not a cloud in the sky.
“Stark’s got deep pockets,” Logan says, and Steve tilts his head a bit in confusion. Logan’s never cared much for the high life. “I bet his bar is top-notch.”
, Tony. Inside and out. Top to bottom. Everything you are. Everything you’ll become.” Steve’s leaning in as he speaks, closer, closer, until their lips brush with each word. “I want it all. There is nothing you could say to scare me away. I want every part of you. As thoroughly as I belong to you, I want- I
“That would soothe the egos of so many men,” Natasha purrs at him, and Tony can’t help but grin at her.
Tony steals a bit of water so he can wipe the counter free of flour with a paper towel. Clint puts the dishes in the dishwasher, and the two of them stand awkwardly in the middle of the kitchen for a moment. Clint hooks a thumb at the dark flat screen.
“I’d help you even if it had nothing to do with Steve,” Bucky continues, because he’s just as much of a meddling brat as he ever was, even now. He steamrolls right over Tony with cheerful Midwestern nicety, like the sky is blue and butter wouldn’t melt in his mouth, no sir.
“I called myself a slut,” Tony says, slowly, and Steve clears his throat, looking uncomfortable. “I openly reclaim that label for myself all the time, Cap.”
“Because it was untested. He said to tell you biochem and radiation are his arena, and you’re an idiot for not asking for help earlier.” Hawkeye is grinning, and Tony turns to look at him. “Are you-”
“Stark,” Loki says, and Tony laughs, breathless and absolutely wrung dry after the ridiculous fucking day he’s had.
“Eww,” Clint groaned, and Tony leaned back until he fell against the back of the couch, laughing breathlessly.
“I am,” Steve says, and then he’s kissing Tony, pressing him up against the concrete and leaning down to lip gently at Tony’s mouth. He’s tentative at first, testing, and Tony freezes in bemused terror, fingers clenching reflexively around the meat of Steve’s biceps. Steve pulls back, eyes wild. “Tell me you want this, too. Tell me I wasn’t wrong.”
"And I know you're going to wait until Thor's back from Asgard. You timed it so you'll have the team on your side, which will convince your brother immediately because we both know he still loves you, in maybe a creepy and terrifying way. And you'll have plenty of time to convince him of your transformation before he has to return home again and break the news to your-" He pauses at Loki's raised eyebrow. "Well, to Odin. There won't be any doubts left in his mind."
Natasha smiled. “See, you read people very well. We just have to tap into that for your lie training. I’ll tell them that at some point over the next few days, you’ll be trying to convince them of something and I’ll be listening. That way, you’ll feel better about it, and they’ll be extra suspicious. Win-win.”
“No, no, Jesus, I’m sorry. I just… my whole life, my dad held you up as this paragon of everything I’d never be, and trust me, straight was definitely on the list. It just hit me all at once – every comparison he made, everything I ever hated you for, and he never really knew you at all. No wonder he never liked me. All he had to compare me to was some cardboard cutout in his head that never even existed.”
“Do not be concerned, Captain. I will certainly keep the details of this conversation confidential. It is written into my programming never to disclose a person’s sexuality. However, you may be interested to learn about the changes in civil rights since your time of origin. Homosexuality is no longer illegal, and although there are many individuals who hold unfortunate beliefs regarding the morality of it, much progress has been made. In fact, two people of the same sex may be legally married in several states, including New York, as well as the District of Columbia.”
He could feel his skills improving as they worked, but he didn’t feel like he was making as much progress cracking the outer shell Natasha always kept in place. They rarely talked much during their actual sparring, and she usually declined to join him for any one-on-one activities.
Tony just blinked at him for a moment, his face as unguarded as Steve had ever seen it. "You knew Jarvis? Really? He pretty much raised me. Didn't mention you. Guess he figured Howard talked enough for both of them."
“Gay, if I understand all the terminology correctly. Just men. Umm, I haven’t told anyone else. Although JARVIS knows, thanks to the recording of future me. He won’t tell, though. Apparently Tony programmed him against telling anyone, even him.”
“Yes, my fiancee is Jim. Please tell him we’re fine. And ask him to call my assistant - she’ll liaise with the hotel and wedding planner.” She rattled off a number, which Bucky, who was holding her head still, repeated for Sam.
“You know, he’s going to get his feelings hurt if you call everyone by their first name except him. Call him Bruce. And sure, I’ll give him a call. Not so sure about Thor.”
“I heard the most fascinating story from my boss today. I mentioned she was getting married today, didn’t I?”
Tony just laughed. “Fair point. Well fine, even without the dress yet, you look amazing. You picked the perfect hair and makeup team. Even if you wouldn’t let me pay for it.”
Steve sat with his head bowed. “You’re right. He was just so good, you know? I was runnin’ around committing felonies trying to join the army, and he was just trying to go to a science expo with a pretty girl. He always took care of me, even after I pulled him out of hell. Smart, too. I looked up some stuff, and do you know how much math you have to do to be a good sniper? Without any of the fancy scopes you have now. He was always good with math.” Steve took a deep, shuddery breath, finally looking up to meet Tony’s eyes. “What must they have done to him to turn him into the Winter Soldier?”
Steve could almost hear Tony connecting the dots, but he controlled his response well. “So what you’re telling me is that you needed Aunt Peggy to remind you that you’re enhanced,” he said flatly.
"JARVIS told me. I checked with him before I called. Also, how could you even keep a straight face when you said that?"
That night, Steve dreamed, as he so often did, of the day Bucky fell from the train. He woke, suppressing a scream, his arm thrown out in front of him. He glanced at the clock – 4:22 – and sighed. He could try to go back to sleep, but he knew it wouldn’t work. Instead, he decided to grab some breakfast and head for the gym, like he usually did, to pound out his frustration, guilt, and regret on the heavy bag. He stayed for a couple of hours, then walked back to his place. He was surprised to find that the changes made yesterday lifted his spirits a bit when he walked back inside. He picked up a history book to pass the time until he met Natasha.
“This wouldn’t happen to be about some SHIELD missions that I’ll apparently be running with you and Clint, would it? It would’ve maybe been nice if he’d talked to me about it before he told you I would do it,” Steve replied, grabbing his leather jacket from the closet and his keys and wallet from the bowl on the table by his door.
“I’m not surprised. You know when I was surprised? Thirty minutes ago when Rumlow said ‘Hail Hydra’ to me in a locker room. This no longer makes the cut of things I find surprising. Now I’m just pissed.” Steve consciously relaxed his jaw.
“No. Maybe the reason I came now. Believe it or not, I was a little nervous to visit. I wasn’t sure how it would really feel to see the lives that my friends lived while I was in the ice. Seeing Peggy how she is now is tough. A very in-your-face reminder of exactly what I missed. But I came because I wanted to know. This just moved up my timeline. It couldn’t wait. You should probably sit.” Steve cleared his throat. “How much do you know about Hydra?”
Loki chuckles, looking up at Tony from beneath his lashes again. His eyes find the bruise on Tony’s cheek where he hit the wall, purple ringing the left side of his occipital. “That looks malicious, it’s true. Very good ammunition.” He licks his lower lip, considering. “I could soothe the pain without erasing the damage.”
“Oh, I-” He whined, going limp and tilting his throat back in submission. He dropped his free hand by his head, letting his legs fall completely open. “Alpha. Claim me.”
That night, Steve went back to his room and pulled up whatever books and documentaries he could find on the sexual revolution. He learned about birth control, and blockers, and Anita Hill. He read the court briefs for the ERA and Title IX. The more he read, the quicker the ball of anxious confusion in his stomach turned to lead. He’d tried to get Tony to Submit—now called showing Obeisance—to him in a professional environment, which was
The professor smiles. “I had a friend––a Jewish, German mutant––who survived the war,” he says. Steve thinks he knows this story, and so he’s unsurprised to see Xavier’s eyes flickering with something sad, something complicated and unbearable and kind. “He was taken by the Reich, used in their experiments. They did…terrible things to him. Things no child should have to suffer.”
Steve grins at him, then hums in consideration. “Does that make you even more brilliant now than you were before?”
“We were in the Dark Dimension,” Stephen says, frowning. His arms are folded across his chest, storm-grey eyes sharp and narrowed at Steve. “Dealing with a recurrent issue.”
“Oh please. I was a doe-eyed underage twink when I showed up at a college full of sexually repressed nerds. It was a miracle my virginity lasted 48 hours.”
“It is my personal recommendation that you see a…different kind of specialist, at least at first. We’re not sure exactly what Amora did to you. But we have enhanced allies that can test that for us. That’s what you were worried about, wasn’t it?”
“And your mind,” Thor retorts, moving to stand. “I know I have never been a match for Loki. And all this…” He waves a hand around the workshop, helplessly. “Your science unnerves me, Tony Stark. This you know. It is so unlike that of home, and even if it were, magic has never been my art.”
“Steve,” Tony says warningly, but Steve just tilts his head up to look at Tony. His eyes are sharp, assessing. That familiar, awful stubbornness overtakes him, an expression that Tony has learned to hate as much as he’s wary of it. It’s enough to make the low ache of pain in Tony’s skull flare with warning.
Instead, he hugs the northwest corner of the park, eyes flitting over the old men and their fishing rods, the duckweed already making its rampant conquest over the water, the grating cries of birds heralding the sharp beak of a kingfisher as it flashes into the rippling silt.
“Sen means a thousand,” she says. Steve furrows his brow, turns to look at her fully. “Her name. Chihiro means a thousand questions. That’s her power in the world; she doubts the face value of things. It saves her from the pig curse. But the witch took that away from her, and just leaves her with a thousand. She’s just one in a thousand workers. Sen.”
to Steve—had only worsened things. Now they barely needed to speak at all to communicate. Sometimes it felt like Steve could read Tony’s thoughts across his furrowed brow like a ticker tape, plain as the star on his mailed chest.
“What are you doing?” Tony says flatly, slicking his hair back. He opens his eyes and turns around, but Loki is a green and black blur behind the fogged glass. He reaches for the shampoo.
“Here,” Tony says, gesturing with the glass cutter he’s holding before realising that’s probably a bad idea. “Why did I decide to make the Empire State Building a to-scale model?”
“Well,” Clint says, laying out a lattice over the top of the pie, “nobody’s ever doubted your ambition.” Tony dries his hands in the dishcloth, the soft fabric clutched between his hands as he watches, mesmerised, while Clint pours an agonisingly slow drizzle of liquid over the top of the pie, working in a wide inward spiral until the whole top is covered, the rest of the liquid slipping down through the openings in the crust’s weaved pattern. “You usually can do it, too, which is why your ego so annoying.”
There were two more doors to go through, one requiring his handprint, the other a retina scan. Finally, he stepped into a huge cavern filled entirely by the Tank; a large metal box with a single pane of glass, equipped with everything from sleeping gas to horse-tranquilisers to other, more deadly solutions. The walls of this room were equipped to handle a sizeable explosion, Steve knew, even if he didn’t quite understand the specs behind it. It was meant to contain, and it was intimidating, and Tony said it looked like a high-tech fish tank. Steve told him he’d clearly never seen a fish tank in his life if that’s what he thought a fish tank looked like, but Tony called it the Tank, and that was its name. It even said so on the blueprints.
Tony argues a bit longer, but it seems to mostly be for the fun of it. He closes his eyes and lies back on the padded bench… thing… Reed has strapped him into.
“I knew you wouldn’t do something that cruel,” Steve explains. “I know you care about me, Tony. You wouldn’t have kissed me unless you meant it.”
“Iron?” Tony says, looking over his shoulder and Bruce nods. “Oh, the irony. Iron Man in his Iron Tower-”
“I have already apologised for my prior transgressions,” Thor says, sounding a little disgruntled about it, and Tony laughs and shakes his head. He taps meaningfully at his earpiece. “Ah. You were speaking to JARVIS.”
“Stephen!” he crows, standing. He spreads his arms out wide. “God, I could fucking hug you. Can I hug you? Are you good? Where the hell have you been? What about Clea and Wong?”
and love and regard. He wanted everyone to know that Tony was his, but more importantly he thought, he was Tony’s.
Peter stills. He sucks in a breath. Then he turns, and fixes Steve with those fearless white-lensed eyes. “Sometimes that’s all he needs.”
Loki looks nonplussed, and Bruce begins to laugh, quiet and shaking. Loki looks between them, a small crease between his brows. “What?”
“Nobody can see me except you,” he confesses. “You’re the first person I’ve been able to talk to since I died.”
He’s got strong leather cuffs, steel chain. Tony’s not a supersoldier, but he’s no slouch. They’re built for someone a little more powerful than the average baseline human. He wraps them around Steve’s wrists, first one, then the other. Steve doesn’t say anything, just watches him with dark eyes. The breaths he takes are deep, enough to swell his chest, to make all the fine lines of his obliques stand out in powerful, mouth-watering shapes that Tony desperately wants to get his mouth on. His eyes are guarded, and after he’s done Tony leans in to kiss him, slow and humming with pleasure.
“That’s your first problem, then, isn’t it?” Pepper asks, not unkindly, and Steve glances up to stare at her from beneath his furrowed brows. “Have you read Plath’s “Colossus” by any chance?”
“Yes,” Tony hissed, and then his mouth was on Steve’s neck, and everything else fled from Steve’s mind like gossamer on the wind.
He rolls over onto his stomach, burying his face into his pillow and letting out a frustrated yell. Loki had better come back soon.
“I’ve got to look. He doesn’t have his horse. If he’s hurt, there’s no way for the man to navigate in this storm. He’ll die out there.”
He closes his eyes. “Steve. Don’t.” He turns a sharp glare on Steve, who’s looking down at him with a strange kind of stubborn tenderness that doesn’t reassure Tony at all. He decides to go on the offensive. “This is just the intermission. You’ve already shown where your allegiances lie. You’ll be glad when this nightmare is over, and you can march off into the sunset with your platonic ideal of brotherly love and the niece of your wartime girl, like that isn’t incredibly weird. And I’ll go back to my fiancé, and get married, and have two kids and a big smelly dog and an annoying spider babysitter. You already chose Barnes over me. Remember?”
"Shit. Okay, we have to assume they were taken. Excuse me, JARVIS? Miss Hansen told Pepper that her boss was working for the Mandarin. Do you know who her boss is?"
“Alexander Pierce, in addition to being the Secretary of the World Security Council, is also the highest-ranking member of Hydra. Based on a visit from Steve and Tony from the future, we got a heads up. Steve is now undercover as Hydra. Pierce confirmed that you are not Hydra. That puts you squarely on our side.”
“Pepper, I need you to try to calm down,” he said gently. “I know you’ve gone through more than anyone should ever have to today, but I’ve got you now, you’re going to be alright. Tony and I are going to take care of you, okay?” He watched as the panic began to recede from her eyes, as the glow began to recede from her skin. She cooled enough that he felt safe putting her down. They both looked up as they heard Killian talking to Tony. It was clear he’d seen Pepper fall, but hadn’t seen Steve catch her. Steve looked around to make sure there were no other agents. “You’re safe for now, but I’d like to go help Tony. Killian obviously has better control of this Extremis thing than the rest of his agents.”
“My question is where we do we go from here?” Natasha asked. “Clint, Steve, and I are going to be running missions for SHIELD,” Steve’s head popped up at that; it was news to him. Natasha continued without pause, though he doubted his response went unnoticed, “Tony spends half his time in Malibu, Bruce travels all over the world, and Thor doesn’t even live on this planet. How are we even supposed to spend enough time together to become a team?”
“Oh no. He won’t believe it unless he hears it from you. Suck it up, Buttercup. Text him. And get some sleep.”
Completely separate from wanting to bond with each of his teammates, Steve grew to love his time in Tony’s lab. Mostly they were silent, with nothing but the sound of whatever loud music Tony had put on that day, but with the way Tony sank into whatever project he was working on, Steve got to watch him without worrying about what Tony would think of it. And boy, he had started to love watching Tony. He was never still – even when he was thinking and not actively working on the project, he couldn’t seem to stop his hands from moving and tinkering. He danced along with the music and Steve couldn’t tell if he was really that unselfconscious or if he had actually gotten so caught up that he’d forgotten that Steve was there. Sometimes, Steve started drawing Iron Man only to flip to a new page and draw Tony in the lab instead. Tony never asked to see the drawings he did there, and Steve never volunteered.
Despite the edge to his tone, Steve couldn’t manage to bring himself out of his wonder at the workshop. “I don’t know how you ever bring yourself to leave this room. Though I suppose you’d get hungry after a while.”
." Steve looked up at Tony from under his lashes in time to see his eyebrows shoot up to his hairline.
“I took an initial look at the schematics,” Natasha said, interrupting Steve’s train of thought. “Shouldn’t be a problem.”
“I was recruited by my original SO,” Rumlow said, “and I brought Rollins in later. Together, we turned most of STRIKE. The ones who weren’t a good fit were… reassigned.”
“Barton and Romanoff are loyal to him. They won’t switch sides, even for me. If Fury were in, they would almost certainly follow. I told you about Stark already. Banner is even less likely. He has less than zero trust in government authority. He’s only willing to stay with Stark because he believes that Stark can and will protect him from the government. Thor is off-world and probably won’t care much for the politics of earth. I’m afraid I’ll be your only powered person for a while.”
“That’s going to have to be something we sort out after everyone is contained. People who surrender will be locked up until things can be sorted. People who fight back are probably in for the long haul. Feel free to kill them,” Natasha said.
Tony gave a little half-smile, but it didn’t hold. Tony seemed to hesitate. “Recruiting me wouldn’t be the smart move. At least not overtly. Look, we haven’t talked about my life before Iron Man – and this isn’t an invitation to start – but I’ve been thinking about what Romanoff said about Hydra recruiting vulnerable baby agents. It’s possible that I might’ve been what could appear to be vulnerable to the casual observer.” Steve was confused by the new avenue of conversation, but he just waited for him to continue. He knew he could outlast Tony. He wasn’t always patient, but sometimes stubborn substituted for patient pretty well. “Howard was, let’s just say not father of the year. I was a little kid who desperately wanted daddy to love him, and when Howard didn’t fill the void, Stane stepped in. Until he literally tried to kill me, I pretty much did whatever he asked me to. I designed lots of weapons because I bought into Stane’s lie that I was keeping US soldiers safe, but what they actually did was kill US soldiers. I was too busy drinking and fucking to pay that much attention. If Stane had been Hydra and hadn’t gotten tired of living in the shadows, he could’ve gotten a lot of mileage out of me.”
Tony spoke first. “So you’re telling me that our future selves came back in time to beat the crap out of us and steal our stuff?”
Steve wondered exactly where Fury had gotten that information and decided to go with as much truth as he could. “I’m not sure how many of them are ready for a real team, but I’d like to give it a shot. They’ve got pretty different personalities, but I think those sometimes make the best teams. Maybe you have more fights, but you’re generally more effective. We’re going to have a barrel full of trust issues, but I think we can crack it. I’d like to continue working with them, meeting and training and discussing strategy.”
