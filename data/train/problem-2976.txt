Michael remains silent and takes one step forward, towering over his vessel, claws digging deeply into the sand. When he closes his eyes, his Grace starts radiating blinding light, his outlines blurring and fading into the brightness.
"Listen to your angel, for once he's less dumb than you are. He knows you need rest, and that his presence slows us down and put us in danger."
A man pulling a cart takes a puzzled look at Gabriel, probably wondering why is this boy talking to himself. The first stone-built structures appear, and we enter Nazareth. The Archangel is striding resolutely towards the house where the young Mary lives - she is there, surrounded by chickens and feeding them by tossing seeds around.
He is staring at Anna in disbelief, and even from up here I can see his jugular throbbing at an accelerated pace.
I'm staring at Cas, waiting for him to confirm, to make the nasty feeling in my gut go away. The exact same feeling I had when I walked on Sam drinking demon blood. Or when I learned Cas was working with Crowley.
I've stopped listening to him already, watching from above as Jimmy tries to convince his wife of my existence. Hours pass, bringing us closer to the present. Soon, the sun is melting into the skyline, casting its last warm pink rays on the snow-covered roofs of the houses.
: Beyond here be dragons? Am I in unedited territory now, or is this fic about to undergo a massive plot twist?
They walked to the cafeteria together, passing several other teachers coming and going to lunch. The relaxed social atmosphere of the previous day’s group lunch had all but dissipated. Most of the staff only stuck around long enough to claim their food and maybe swap a few quick words with whoever they ran into along the way before getting back to their respective classrooms. With orientation the next morning, everyone was too busy with final preparations to take too much time for casual socializing.
“Like a giant prism,” Cas says. “Like I’ve got wings made of something celestial and imperceptible by human eyesight that happened to catch the light at just the right angle to make a sort of… reverse shadow…” he trails off, so Dean finishes the thought for him.
He bottoms out and gives them both a moment to adjust before Cas is wrapping his legs around Dean and spurring him on. Before he moves, Dean leans down and kisses him thoroughly, backing off just enough to stare into his eyes as he slowly pulls out and slides back in. Dean keeps that painfully slow pace until Cas is clawing at his back, digging his fingertips into the matching image tattooed on Dean’s shoulder. He almost loses it right there.
It was a pretty bold suggestion, Dean realized the second he sent the message. As far as he knew, Feathers had a similar policy to his own when it came to anyone else reading his stories. They might bounce ideas off one another, or work out minor plot points together sometimes, but even he had never seen one of Feathers’ first drafts. Dean reassured himself about his plan to push the boundaries, and was encouraged the moment the next message appeared.
“You’re not getting it yet,” Gabriel says. “I don’t want to just save your ass, here. I want to make sure he never does this to anyone else. He’s dangerous. Maybe even unhinged. But he shouldn’t be allowed within a mile of any hospital, let alone running the emergency medicine department. He’s the worst kind of doctor, who gets a thrill out of playing god.”
Cas smiled at that, and then turned serious. “You know I never put it into words last night, but in case it wasn’t clear, I love you, Dean. There is no one I’d rather spend this human life with, and nothing that could make me leave your side.”
For the first time since that first fateful shower weeks ago, Dean was completely alone in the apartment. He didn’t have to put on a show for Cas. He could be as corny as he wanted to be and nobody would judge him for it. As much as he missed Cas, a full chested rendition of Fool In The Rain felt cathartically appropriate that night.
“I think we lucked out,” Cas said as he’d unlocked their front door and held it open for Dean. “This is the corner unit, and we seem to have some additional closet space as well as a balcony off the living room.”
. It couldn’t be worse than that whole Thin Man fiasco. At least, Dean hoped Ed had learned his lesson about faking supernatural shit for fun and profit. He heaved a huge sigh as Cas shuffled around the table to watch over his other shoulder, and then clicked the link to the video.
“Not a romantic then?” Dean asked with a playful smile, letting Cas know he didn’t intend it as a judgment of any sort, or a demand for an answer. To his relief, it seemed to put Cas at ease. “I can’t imagine making it all the way through medical school and general residency and then just walking away. There’s cheaper ways to find a date.”
“That’s going to make him even more dangerous than usual. Do you think we should warn his other boarders? Kevin Tran and Hannah Johnson?”
She pointed out each of the people she named, and Dean followed along as best he could. Garth and Bess sat side by side at a table with several other teachers he’d been introduced to but was now blanking on their names. From what he could tell, they looked like a couple of newlyweds, the way they kept smiling at each other. Alicia was easy to spot, laughing at a joke one of the parents serving their food had told her, while Max rocked along to whatever was playing on his headphones as he grabbed a soda from a large cooler in the corner of the room. Cas was another story. The man Donna indicated was sitting almost directly behind him, his back turned to them as he ate, hunched over a book spread out on the table beside his plate. All Dean had was a really nice view of the back of Cas’s messy head of hair.
: LOL so if you spend all your free time editing on the sly tomorrow at work maybe you’ll get as far as I did tonight editing mine.
“I know it’s not really any of my business, but I know you Dean, and even after something like this when he practically lays down an engraved invitation for you, sometimes you just won’t pick it up. You think you’re not good enough, or you have some stupid idea about yourself or your life that stops you from doing anything to make yourself happy. Whatever, the reason’s not important.” Sam paused again, glancing up at Dean’s confused face before looking back down at his hands and hurrying on before he lost his momentum, or courage. “Just… don’t do that this time. You deserve better. Hell,
“Music, gym, computer lab, art, science lab, and… something else, right?” Dean said, grinning at Cas before jumping down off the stage.
Cas shrugged. “They will if we’re less than professional with one another at work. I don’t know that it’s any of their business, anyway.”
Cas was left blinking at Dean now, trying to recall what he’d told Dean he would be doing all day. “Ah, yes? I suppose? I haven’t heard from them yet, but I think I would’ve known by now if things hadn’t gone well.”
That’s when it finally hit Cas, that Dean hadn’t just casually brought up the brewery tour. He’d probably bought the tickets weeks ago. When Cas turned him down, Dean offered his ticket to the only other friend he had in town. That could’ve been him, spending an afternoon with Dean. But he also realized that if he’d said yes, if he’d gone with Dean, he never would’ve figured any of this out. They would’ve had fun together like they always did, sure, but they would’ve continued dodging the hidden halves of their lives. They never would’ve talked about Charlie, or the fandom, or any of it. He wondered how long they could’ve dragged this out if he hadn’t turned Dean down and then sat at home, alone, sulking about it all day. The thought stopped him cold, and he resolved to finally have a real conversation with Dean, about everything.
“Sam, this is Dr. Milton. He’s tricked me into agreeing to buy a car. Gabriel, this is Sam. He was my last patient last night.”
“So who are you online? Because if you know Charlie online, there’s a high likelihood that we’re already acquainted.”
“The hospital takes all complaints of this nature, anonymous or otherwise, very seriously,” Crowly replied. “So despite rapturous praise from everyone who should’ve had a say in your future assignments, the administration was unwilling to ignore those complaints without further investigation.”
Dean blinked at him, and then shrugged. “Whatever, it works out to the same deal. We both gotta live here together, and I don’t intend to make it weird by having strangers for sleepovers. I just… I wanted to make that understood, okay? We haven’t really laid out those sorts of house rules, and I wanted you to know that.”
He thought about how he could get in touch with Feathers. If something was truly wrong, and Feathers couldn’t use Discord or tumblr for whatever reason, Dean had no idea how to call or text him, or even where to go about searching for him. For all he knew, Feathers lived in Siberia and their schedules only meshed up because he worked the night shift. He dismissed that idea quickly as undeniably ridiculous. They at least knew each other better than that.
“I thought I was a number of times, but things never seemed to work out, for one reason or another. Either the timing was wrong, or the other person was only interested in a casual relationship, and that’s not something I’ve ever wanted.”
“If you think this is bad, wait until Monday when the halls are teeming with kids,” she said with a grin as another teacher sat down beside her. “Most of us make them wear some sort of name tags for at least the first week of school, but even that only helps so much.”
Another nurse’s station sits in the center of a ring of curtained-off exam areas. Cas leads Sam around to the open curtain with a large number 3 suspended from the ceiling above it.
By the time Gabriel gets home around 10:30, Cas has made substantial progress toward unpacking. He’d been pleasantly surprised by the thoroughness of the labeling of all his belongings, and the thoughtfulness of the packing. Once he gets started, it’s a simple matter of stacking his still neatly folded things in drawers or else picking up things still on their hangers and transferring them to his new closet. He’s even moved the boxes of his books from Gabriel’s office into the back of the large walk-in closet. He doesn’t own nearly enough clothing to come close to filling it, and it seems logical to store the rest of his belongings where they’re out of Gabriel’s way. When Gabriel strolls in to find him flattening and folding up one of the last empty boxes, he gives an impressed whistle.
Dean nods. “Yeah, good. Same. I’m surrounded by blood and needles all day long, so, same. Just thought you should know. Just in case. Because I got lube, but I’m not sure about condoms. It’s, uh… it’s been a while. And I’ve never had sex without one.”
well, at least for me. I studied law because it got me out of taking organic chemistry, and now I’ve got all this medical shit to sort through, and I haven’t got the first idea what I’m looking at half the time. Google has been both my friend and my mortal enemy here.”
Mildred raises an eyebrow and is about to make a snappy comeback when she notices the state of the back of Sam’s jacket and her entire demeanor shifts into protective mother hen mode.
He trudged back to his apartment and sat down on the couch. Dean had fully intended to wait until noon to get back to reading, as they’d agreed the night before, but he was feeling lost and lonely and confused. It was exactly the state he’d left Neal and Em in the previous night. He admitted to himself that he needed the comfort of reading Feathers’ words right then, needed to know how the characters would make it through and find their happy ending. Maybe it would give him some insight into how to deal with his own entirely fucked up situation.
Dean tugs the collar of his shirt down, revealing the star inside a circle of flames on his own chest, surrounded by glimpses of other images spreading across his chest and shoulder. “This one supposedly protects against demons, but me and Sammy both got ‘em years ago.”
The Chief thought about that for a moment, and then walked across the room, pushing her way between Dean and Sam to point to a map of the town pinned to the opposite wall. “The first few incidents were reported after a family went camping around the far side of Silver Lake, here. Day after they got back to town, we had the grocery store incident. Len Morton stood in that parking lot long enough for his ice cream to melt just to apologize for a non-existent scratch.”
“I know, Dean, but the only thing left is the heavy shit.” He groans as Dean gets his shoes off and starts rubbing his feet. “That feels wonderful. Please don’t stop.”
“That’s how it usually happens, Dean,” Jody said. “Take it from us, people like that hardly ever back off.”
Charlie was quiet for a moment at that, and Dean had a bit of a panic over what he'd said that actually managed to shut her up for a second.
When they’d broken in the day before, the cabin had been locked up for winter, the furniture covered with sheets to protect it from dust and the windows shuttered. He and Dean had uncovered the sofa and other furniture, made up the bed, and made it comfortable for themselves. Somehow, since he’d last seen it, the entire cabin had been festively redecorated. A six foot Christmas tree stood in one corner decked out with a rainbow assortment of lights and glittering baubles. Holly and pine garland had been draped across the stone mantle above a blazing fire, tied with red bows. A pile of wrapped gifts sat beneath the tree, and the tables at each arm of the sofa bore tall pillar candles that seemed to be giving off a subtle aroma of cinnamon. Perhaps most bizarrely, Dean was nowhere in sight.
Cas locks up the house and gets in his car. He lets the rumble of the engine soothe him as he backs out of the driveway and heads, probably out of sheer habit, toward the hospital, even though he knows he can’t actually go there. It’s blessedly less than a minute later that he finds himself driving past Pamela’s office and Dean’s shop, and knows if nothing else, Dean will certainly know how to get a hold of Pamela. They are friends, after all. He looks for a parking spot on the street, but there’s not one conveniently available so he drives around the block until he spots Dean’s beautiful black car parked out behind the building and pulls in next to it. As he gets out, he can’t help but think their two cars look pretty damn good together.
Dean laughed outright at that, and resisted the urge to kiss Cas stupid. He needed to confess as well.
“I may have mentioned that I would likely feel better when I got home to read your latest letter. She was intrigued by that, and asked if we’d been writing to each other every day since the shift change.”
Over the course of that first day, Dean and Donna perfected their working partnership. She wasn’t Cas, but Dean appreciated her knack for showing up every time Lydia tried to corner him, and monopolizing every conversation that Lydia had tried to turn into a flirtation. There was no faster way to douse any intended arousal than to barge between them griping about carbuncles or acid reflux or the food poisoning case in curtain three. Dean kinda loved her for it.
“It’s only been two days. Give it time,” Dean replied, leaning in for a kiss. “Maybe we should try desensitization therapy. That could help.”
Jack smiled at him contentedly and felt the relief in Cas. Cas looked at his own fingers with a sense of wonder, rubbing them together and marveling at them, like shaking off the prickling sensation of feeling returning after his hand had been numb for far too long. Jack knew from personal experience that that was just the tip of the iceberg. He understood completely what having full possession of his own human soul had done for him, and he wanted desperately to get Cas out of this place of desolation before the full force of his choice settled over him. Amara sympathized, and they both felt a pang of anticipation for their own liberation. For the first time, they both were united in their resolve to carry out the plan they’d set for themselves, without any regret or remorse for what they were leaving behind.
Dean pockets the phone. “Oh shit,” he says, pulling out his own phone and sending Donna a text, since she was the last person he’d messaged.
Dean smiled at that, feeling relieved himself, but saving the rest of this conversation for some point when they didn’t have an honesty monster to hunt. The last thing he needed was to let himself get too comfortable with spilling truths all over the place. He slowly released his hold on Cas and steered them to safer waters.
“I don’t have wings or the power of Heaven at my back, but I do recall something I said to you that night. Good things do happen, Dean. And they have.”
Jack laughed, evading the question yet again, seeing as how it was directly connected up to the previous one, even if he hadn’t fully made his choice yet. There was one thing he could absolutely do to make Heaven a little less lonely, though. It’s why he was there in the first place, after all.
Cas licked his lips, drawing Dean’s gaze for a second before snapping back to Cas’s eyes. “I suppose that depends on what you mean by
As he walked closer across the inky darkness, Jack could see that Cas was still entirely alive, but pinned to the ground by a cocoon of snaking tendrils of the empty. It writhed across his body and held him down, muffling his screams as the Entity crouched over him, flicking its fingers and sending new waves of horror and suffering through Cas. Jack couldn’t stand for it any longer. Without taking his eyes off of Cas, he cleared his throat to finally get the Entity’s attention. It didn’t even turn to acknowledge his presence, merely started talking with an air of menacing glee in its voice.
“First things first,” he says when he’s finished his burger. “You got anything you need from Nick’s tonight?”
Cas shook his head. “There’s a certain Queen who posted an interesting series of photos on tumblr yesterday. I had no idea the two of you were acquainted.”
Benny leads him away down the hall, kicking up a fuss but going with him anyway. As soon as they turn the corner and Nick’s complaints fade into the distance, Gabriel turns to them with a grin, rubbing his hands together.
She glared at him for another minute before finally replying. “Aside from the bio students from the college, I think you’re the first out of towners we’ve had since this started. It hit the week after tourist season ended, when the foliage turned.”
The woman who ran the campground had set everything up for them, and he turned down the fresh sheets that were far nicer than the stiff white linens he was used to seeing at motels. These were nearly as soft as the sheets on his bed back at the bunker that he’d picked out for himself, light blue, and embroidered along the hem with a delicate pattern of flowering vines. Rather than lay claim to one side of the bed, he hesitated; maybe out of consideration for Dean’s preferences since Dean had had a lifetime of sleeping to even establish a preference, but also just a bit out of the nervous unease that had left the single beer he’d drunk fizzing uncomfortably in his belly.
Volunteering to help Cas shelve books for the next few hours probably wasn’t the best way to go about avoiding the subject, he learned all too quickly. Everything had been going fine at first. Cas stayed in his office to finish scanning in the remaining new books, while Dean made his way through the nonfiction section, shelving and organizing as he went. The library had a great selection, and he’d been making a mental list of books he could recommend to kids who came to his office. Knowing they had a brand new assortment of dinosaur books, or a new atlas of the solar system, or even a new book about puppies would be useful information down the line. If walking a student down to the library to pick out a book also happened to give him a chance to see Cas more frequently, Dean absolutely would not object.
“It was an accident,” Sam grits out, wincing in pain as he tries to look up at her. “I shoulda been looking where I was going.”
Over dinner that first week, they’d talked about practically everything else. Well, aside from the huge elephant they’d brought back into the room with them that evening. As he got dressed, Dean struggled to hold on to the calm sense of familiarity their shower concert had restored, at least for a few minutes. Cas had started with the baseline, patting out the drum track on the tile wall. Dean had known the song before he even got the first words of Come Together out. Silly exuberance ensued as they both laughed their way through the lyrics. It had been exactly the sort of absurdity that Dean had needed after the exhausting week at the hospital, the complete upheaval of his old life, and the fear that had shot through him over whether or not he’d already managed to ruin the one solid friendship he’d successfully made in this new life.
It didn’t take him long to scroll back far enough to see her first post of the day. A full-length mirror selfie, dressed casually in jeans and an Unnatural t-shirt, her auburn hair brushing her shoulders, and a face that he could’ve sworn he recognized. He wondered if it was entirely possible that he’d seen her around town. It wasn’t a huge city, after all, and after living there for several years he found he recognized a lot of people just from hanging out in his usual haunts-- the library, the tea shop, the bookstore, or even just walking along the Promenade by the river. He couldn’t quite place where he’d seen her, though, despite squinting at her photo for several minutes. Eventually he scrolled down and read the caption below.
“Beauty parlor?” Cas asked, completely confused for a moment before realization washed over him and his eyes widened as he complied with Dean’s request. “You mean like the hair stylist who was flirting with me. Yes, I understand now.”
With that thought, he shut his laptop and dragged himself to bed. He could lie there and rewatch the last season of Unnatural, and wonder if Impala was watching the same episode he was.
Cas poured the milk into both mugs and rinsed out the pan. He stirred the chocolate and wondered if they had any of those small marshmallows. Somewhere deep down, he knew they didn’t, but when he opened the cupboard to put the box of cocoa back, there they were on the shelf. He only hesitated for a moment before reaching for the bag and dropping a handful of marshmallows into each of their mugs. Something was definitely not right.
: DEAN. Stop. He knows what a first draft looks like, and he VOLUNTEERED. Trust him, okay? He’s not gonna suddenly hate you because you made a typo. Now go, talk to your man and tell him I said hi. And don’t get all weird and self-deprecating. It’s not a good look on someone as good looking as you are.
“You know I’d never turn down pie, but the whole point was for me to show you how it’s made. Kinda defeats the purpose if you’re not even here to see the magic happen.”
Cas hesitated for just a moment, because of course he heard Dean’s complaint, before cautiously reaching out and resting a hand on Dean’s shoulder. Dean rolled his head to see Cas smiling at him with what his brain was trying to convince him was genuine fondness. He crushed down that thought and waited for Cas to finish the job with whatever hearty platitude or pithy reassurance he was about to offer.
“So I’ve gathered,” Ed said. “I’ve heard a lot of tall tales about you guys, and just considering this place,” he said, gesturing around at the bunker in general with his beer, “I have a feeling there’s a lot more truth to them then most people even realize.”
It made for a dizzying array of sensations, the heat and the wet and the weight of Cas sliding against him. It was almost too much to take in; so many of his deepest desires that had played out in endless loops in his thoughts were now happening for real. He only had a split second to worry that Cas was pressed back against his growing erection before Cas sighed again and rolled his spine, sending a shiver up Dean’s back and another shot of heat to his groin.
Dean pushed in the chair at the circulation desk and switched off the computer, while Cas shut off the lights in his office and closed the door. He left the main library lights on for now, mostly to humor Mildred, but it would only be the work of a minute to return to switch those off, too. As Dean and Cas made their way back to the cafeteria, Dean felt a sudden weight at the realization that they were about to go their separate ways for the weekend. When they returned to work on Monday morning, everything would be different. They’d both be swept up in first day chaos, and the little routine they’d established over the last few days would be a distant memory. Maybe they could still keep their standing lunch appointment, but it would hardly be the same once the cafeteria was filled with raucous students. And if they were about to be dismissed for the day just before noon, then they wouldn’t even have one last quiet lunch together.
Cas accepts this, but he has other questions. “What do cowboy boots have to do with this being a suitable venue for our ongoing lessons?”
“It seems more like people are being compelled to tell the truth,” Cas replied. “The local librarian admitted publicly that she loves romance novels, and wished more people would join her book club. Several people have sold their businesses after running them successfully for decades, declaring that they hated their lives and wanted to do something more fulfilling. There’ve also been twenty petitions for divorces in the last three weeks, in a town that’s barely seen that many over the last decade. There’ve been nearly that many applications for marriage licenses, as well.”
Dean struggled to recall what had happened on stage that day, even though it had only been a few weeks ago. To be fair, he’d been entirely distracted by his first introduction to Cas at the time. But in between flashes of blue and the recollection that they’d first bonded over quietly heckling the boring speaker, Dean began to remember. “Yeah. Yeah, that was the guy. Zachariah Adler. He was a smarmy douche, but he didn’t seem invested in screwing over the hospital. He was all about towing the company line.”
Dean snorts and takes another swig of beer. “You’re the only nerd I know whose after school job is basically homework.”
Dean watched on, bemused, while Cas composed himself. “Well at the very least, I’ll be able to help you out with maintenance. But if you’re gonna own a car like that, you should at least know the basics of how to take care of her.”
“I think I should probably do that myself,” Cas says, frowning at Dean’s hand. “It’s technically an open wound.”
Cas nodded solemnly, as if he took Dean’s rather terse reply as some sort of deep and abiding confidence.
“And don’t forget about the decades of fucking us over before that,” Sam muttered before diving back into his research.
“I got another victim for you, Claire, if you’re up for it,” Jody announces late that afternoon, much to Claire’s surprise.
“First report I could find for sure was about three weeks ago. A man dinged a car door with a shopping cart at the grocery store, then stood there for forty five minutes waiting for the owner of the car to finish shopping so he could pay for the damage.”
Cas had finally begun to smile again, and turned his attention back to the computer. “We didn’t actually meet face to face until late the next night when you summoned me. There was a bit of a delay due to unforeseen circumstances.”
“Wow, Cas, this is awesome,” Dean replied, looking from the books into Cas’s pleased face. “You sure you don’t need these? There’s a lot in here.”
“Speaking of eating, I think you said something about getting dinner when I woke up?” Dean asked, patting his stomach. “I’ve been subsisting on road food and coffee since yesterday morning. What’s good around here?”
A smile slowly spread across Dean’s face as the full delight of this situation began to dawn on him. “How about you try and guess.”
deserves better than that. And if you don’t know what I’m talking about, you’re probably a hopeless case anyway at this point. Just… know I’d be happy for both of you.”
Cas’s eyes went wide as Dean just grinned and shrugged at him. Very hesitantly, he replied. “Hello.”
Dean frowned but nodded, letting Sam stagger off to bed. Sam had shown up less than five minutes after Dean had walked by Cas’s open door. Either he’d just missed Cas in the hall or else Cas had gone back to his room when he’d heard Dean in the kitchen. At least it was a place to start looking for him again. He picked up the mugs and set out to find him.
“They are far softer than boots, yes. I intended to help you with the groceries. I suppose I’m too late for that,” Cas said, looking around the kitchen and then sniffing the air. “Are you making pizza? What happened to all the grand dinner plans you regaled me with this afternoon?”
Ed shrugged his backpack off and set it on the war room table, still looking around trying to absorb everything in the room. Dean brought a round of beer from the fridge in the library and set one on the table in front of Ed, startling him back to the present.
was in that book. Her husband’s strange death was apparently, according to Carver Edlund, the result of witchcraft. And the two strange, pushy FBI agents who’d scoured her kitchen for clues while asking her some wild questions had actually been hunting witches, one of whom turned out to be the girl she’d trusted to babysit her son. The girl had actually been an ancient witch trying to raise a demon, while Sam and Dean had been trying to stop the apocalypse.
“There is such a thing as compromise, Dean. Doing something that’s not your first choice in order to enjoy the company of the people who matter most to you.”
Cas’s next note was slightly more desperate. “It’s been difficult to adjust to this sleep schedule. I’m tired all the time. And it feels pointless to even try when we switch again in less than a week.”
: It’s all good. I was kinda shocked you volunteered yourself like that. It’s about as rough as a draft can get. I don’t even know if it would make good reading. Are you really that stuck on your own fic?
“Because it’s true…” Dean said. His eyes went wide and he looked down at the soapy water in mild horror. “You don’t think the water in the hot water tank counts as water stored before the spell lifted, do you?”
wishing he could see into the room. The idea of Cas being trapped in there with this guy is turning his stomach. “Bunch of John Does or something?”
Dean reached down and unzipped the bag closest to him without looking away from Ed and grabbed out a set of binoculars and a weird looking antenna thing. “We’re gonna go in covert if we can, scope the scene out, and then react accordingly.”
“We have a lot to do today,” Cas says, wrapping an arm around Dean’s waist and pulling him in for a kiss.
Cas grinds his hips against Dean’s to demonstrate exactly how sure he is, and Dean bites his lip and drops his head back to rest against the door with a thud at the feeling of Cas’s hard cock rubbing against his through their pants. He holds Cas tight, hands sliding from his hips and down his ass, urging him to do it again. Cas obliges, and then hisses in pain as his new tattoo bumps against Dean’s shoulder. Dean lets him go instantly, holding him by the shoulders now to force a few inches of distance between them so he can look Cas in the eyes.
After those details are sorted, they move on to the second half of their business-- the mountain of circumstantial evidence they’ll use to take Nick down once and for all. Pamela begins by going through the list of observations Gabriel had compiled case by case before moving on to Cas’s current situation. He feels uncomfortable answering some of the more personal questions about his time living under Dr. Morningstar’s roof, but Pamela assures him it’s necessary to uncover any potential weapons Nick might have tucked up his sleeve.
“She felt bad for both of us,” Dean replied, grinning at Cas and ushering him into the staff room to finish their breakfast.
“Huh, but aren’t the Penns loaded all on their own?” Dean asked, legitimately confused on the matter. “They aren’t secretly in financial straits or some shit, are they?”
She paused for a moment, resting her hands on the back of a chair for support. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, then looked right at Jack.
“Beer?” Dean asks, setting the bags down on the table and turning to find Cas studying the apartment.
The first time he’d unintentionally walked in on Cas in the shower room, Cas had fortunately finished showering. Unfortunately, Cas was standing by the sink, wearing only a pair of jeans, leaning in close to the steamy mirror, shaving. If Dean could’ve escaped unnoticed, he would have, but of course Cas had spotted him, turning to him with a smiling
“Yeah, Sam should be back soon, and I can call Pamela for you and tell her you’re here with me,” Dean says eventually, pulling out his phone. “Hell, they’re probably all freaked out about you by now. It’s been a while since you sent those messages.”
“You know bigfoot’s not real,” Sam replied. “And I’ve had enough of fake aliens to last a lifetime, thanks.”
In the space of a single human breath, the Empty showed Cas everything he ever wanted, only to rip it all to shreds the moment he tried to reach for it, over and over and over again. A thousand different scenarios played out where Cas would come just to the brink of happiness, where Dean would be right there with him, only for it to fail in those final moments. Dean would die and Cas would fail to save him. A particular favorite of the Entity’s seemed to be that Cas’s sacrifice had been in vain, that he’d destroyed any hope for Dean’s happiness anyway.
“That’s great and all, but is there actually a plan for any of it?” Ed asked hesitantly. “Or are we just gonna march up to these guys in broad daylight basically covered in weapons? Because that doesn’t seem like much of a plan.”
“You would just drop it, wouldn’t you?” Dean asked, and then had to clear his throat as Cas turned back to him, confused. “If I never asked you to do that again, you’d just let it go and keep on going like we have been for years now, and you’d pretend like it never happened even if it killed you inside.”
Dean blinked at him for a minute. “I gotta say I’m not feeling particularly good about the nuclear crocodiles, but alligators aren’t sounding that much more enticing.”
“I still can’t figure out why the administration would capitulate to a handful of anonymous complaints that Crowley even acknowledged they knew were bogus,” Cas said as they locked the door behind them again. “It doesn’t make sense to throw the entire department into upheaval over it. There are surely easier and less disruptive ways to weed out the person who made the complaints.”
“Ooh, yah,” Donna replied, sitting down at the computer and turning the screen toward Dean. “Made some headway on it with Cas’s help. The guy should take on a second career as a mystery writer. He’s really clever about spotting irregularities and suspicious details.”
to tell someone about it. He still hesitated, though. It was late, they were both tired and had to be up early in the morning. And Cas was still not sure just how far he was willing to open himself up to anyone online. He spared one slightly hysterical moment to think maybe it was something he could tell Dean about over lunch, before shaking that thought off and sending Impala the link to his story. The second Impala reciprocated, Cas eagerly clicked through and read the opening lines. He squeezed his eyes shut and tabbed back over to Discord before he succumbed to the urge to keep reading. He’d earned it, after all, finishing his entire draft. He wrote, so now he should get to read.
“Next week’s trip shouldn’t be this bad,” Cas pointed out as he stocked the fridge, holding up a large bottle of ketchup. “Unless you are far more fond of ketchup than you’ve let on thus far.”
“Well, I don’t think I can offer you any help with that, then,” Cas said, nodding in sympathy. “Would it help you to think of it as something you’re writing to be printed in a newsletter, or sent as an email? Sometimes approaching a conundrum from a different angle changes everything.”
He looked up from the water to Cas’s face, open and honest and waiting for him to get over himself. “Yeah. I just want you, Cas.”
. But now, after never thinking he’d ever get any more than that, Cas was telling him flat-out that he had already chosen to stick around, and his reasons amounted to
Donna shrugged. “We’re on call tomorrow, but that doesn’t mean we’ll actually be called in. We might have time to whip up a little something before they wake up.”
The friends he’d made in California were great, but they were all in the same boat he was. They’d all met and been thrown together on the same journey into life, but each of them had known from the beginning that all their roads would eventually head out in different directions. While they’d shared the same stretch of highway they’d been able to find comfort and support in one another, but when it was time to go their separate ways, Dean didn’t feel it like a traumatic loss. He’d stay in touch with some of them-- the core of his friend group like Benny and Charlie and Aaron-- but he couldn’t imagine what it must’ve felt like for Cas being cut adrift completely with no tether to anything he could think of as home.
“You got nothing against rock music, I take it,” Dean asked, looking around at one completely empty set of bookshelves and a few large blank walls. “I’ve still got my stereo down in my car, and a bunch of old concert posters I’ve been lugging around for years hoping to get them framed someday. I just never had wall space for them out in LA.”
“Why the fuck didn’t we do this sooner,” Dean muttered, fascinated by the pleased faces Cas made as he moved his fingers through Cas’s hair.
Cas finally glanced at the clock, and was shocked to see it was coming up on five o’clock. The walking tour was surely nearly done by now, if any of them could still walk in their current state. Which meant that Dean would be walking home again soon… or staggering, as the case may be. He wondered if he should call Dean for a hot minute before remembering that Dean likely wouldn’t be in any state to talk about anything. He could wait for tomorrow, for their standing brunch date. Cas had more questions than he knew what to do with, and the delay would hopefully give him enough time to sort them all out.
“What the hell is even happening in there?” Dean asks, trying to get a look through the door and failing.
What the hell was that? I never saw a person to become this lifeless after watching a horror movie. Well, he
Gabriel then finds his cue to get into the conversation. “You see Dean, our Cas here is wasting all his good opportunities in life and choosing to live his life like a reclusive in this small remote house, while being your average working slave, instead of swimming in money like we all do!” Gabriel chuckles, definitely trying to get a reaction from Cas.
He seems strangely happy now. “We can do that. Netflix has a large movie collection.” Maybe not strangely, since movie nights actually get me a little excited as well. Actually, not only a
His noisy scream definitely turned every eye on us by now. “You really are a piece of shit, you know that?” I angrily talk through my clenched teeth, while twisting his arm even more and him trying in vain to keep down his screams. “Thinking that you’re
.” Cas looks uncomfortable being surrounded by so many people, but his mouth sure has no problems in being snarky.
I finally gather my courage to get out of the room after taking my things but I find Cas in the same place, completely panicked. He notices me then. “Dean, you do not have to do this. I already told you that it is not necessary for us to sleep in the same bed.”
affected. The collar is usually worn to show the ownership over an omega and the people usually avoid them.
. Although I still have no idea how can this sex-on-legs guy can also be so cute with those squeezy cheeks, but so clueless and confusing while carrying the alpha gene. Another of life’s great mysteries, I guess?
“How can the music flow there? It does not make any sense.” Cas says while waving his rusty robotic hands in the air. This guy has a lot of work to do.
“How about peanut butter with grape jelly? I do not have jam, though. I am finding it unsettling.” Cas even seems horrified at the thought of it. What happened between him and jam? “Shall we eat outside? It seems like a nice morning to do that.”
A warm mouth engulfs my cock and it goes up and down relentlessly, forcing me to get even harder and widening the hole in my stomach that only increases my desperation even more.
“Thank you, Dean.” he slowly says, looking me straight in the eyes, and at that moment I feel like I
He nods, though still doesn’t make any move to get up for some reason, and just stares aimlessly at our intertwined hands.
This does piss me off enough to snap at him in more words than I ever wanted to say during this time. “Cas, I’ll just tell you once to get it over with. In case you forgot about what kind of planet we’re living on, the people here don’t care if omegas have sleep paralyses or screws loose or whatever, and sure as hell won’t spend money on doctors for them unless they’re about to kick the bucket.” Seeing him wanting to refute my ‘spending money’ comment, I quickly continue. “And before you get any ideas, I also don’t trust those lunatics and won’t ever go see them on my own accord.”
Finally detaching from me, I give him a bloody feral smirk. “Keep dreaming, you sick son of a bitch.”
Always wanted to read a rude omega Dean and confused alpha Cas fanfic, then one day I decided 'Why wait for the fic, when I can write it myself?' :)
He did. “Is it alright if I carry you, Dean?” His voice sounds like he’s outside of the ocean I’m sinking right now, but it strangely sounds reassuring to me.
This is actually nothing new to me. It has been happening for a few years now. Even before the dissociation itself. Garth told me that it’s called sleep paralysis, but it’s worse than any dissociation I’ve ever had. At least, during my dissociative episodes, I can somehow move and I’ve been able to break through some of them with enough willpower. But the sleep paralyses are the worst. I’ve never been able to break through one, since from what I understood, the brain itself is half asleep and the muscles are locked. Though the worst part is the shit I see and hear during that. I know that nothing is real, but it’s still a disturbing experience.
“Mission? Is he a secret agent or something? Well, he still has a long way to go until he reaches the 007 level, but he actually seems to have that kind of vibe, now that I’m thinking about it.” Or not, but maybe that’s the trick.
After I take the shower in the unexpectedly big bathroom, I can feel all the weariness catching up to me. So, after changing my clothes, I turn off the lights and directly pass out on the unmade but soft bed.
There was no way to escape that house since it was full of servants, but fortunately, I could figure out the address where I was being held from some delivery boxes left in that room. And remembering the fact that the black-market omega trafficking is illegal, for the first time I decided that my only way out is by calling the
the problem for getting so emotional over hearing something that I’ve been waiting to hear for so long and showing it to him.
He has no reaction to my outburst and answers calmly but with conviction. “Because it should be your right as well. Because you are
“It actually is,” Cas is now avoiding my eyes, looking like he feels guilty of something. “We have access to the population’s database. Our job is to keep it secured from external attacks, but Charlie should be classified as a virus as well.” I snort a little, but I’m more amazed that Cas made a joke. Actually, it doesn’t seem like he made it intentionally, judging by the grim look on his face, but it’s still funny.
“Don’t ask me, man. I have no idea what that guy is thinking and probably wouldn’t understand it even if he were to tell me. Even his coworkers call him an
“–ean!” I’m abruptly pulled out of my thoughts by the feeling of cold fingers touching mine. Cas looks ashamed. “Y-you said that touching your hands will keep you focused.” He takes his hand back, his voice trembling. “I am so sorry for touching you without permission. I am also very sorry for confusing you. It was not my intention. I only bring you grieve, Dean.”
Despite being outnumbered I decide to take my chances and suddenly kick one of them between the legs, then try to sneak besides him, back to where I came from. That is until one of them roughly grabs my collar, then throws me into a wall.
“Do you want me to sleep with you?” I calmly say to him, but my brain has caught up with what I ended up saying way too late.
Garth looks back at me confused, but a little amused and shrugs. “You really like to run away from people who try to say nice things to you, don’t you?”
Not like I’d like to stay here more than I have to, but there is something that I need to do first. So, I say instead. “It doesn’t seem like you ever did this before, but shouldn’t you like, tell the staff what are you planning to do, first?” Only then, he seems to calm a little and answer with a cute ‘Oh’. I’m not even going to reprimand myself for this anymore. I’ll be with this guy for the next 6 months and if I am to enjoy this, then even better. I continue. “I also need to pack my stuff and talk with somebody, so just do what you gotta do until then.”
“Garth, man, I think you seriously need a vacation, if you got to the point where you see me as a sweetheart.” I say to him smiling a little.
But the most important question is actually what the hell am I doing? Poor guy can’t even read me and despairs when he thinks that he’s the problem. Well, he
“The climax.” I amusedly add slowly, ignoring the angry noises coming from Dick and skimming through the papers. Just like Cas said during our first conversation, everything from the part that I can leave after six months, to the part that I’ll get financial support if I do – everything is all in here. It still doesn’t make sense to me why would a person like him go through these lengths for a lowly omega like me, but beggars can't be choosers, I guess?
“Hey, hey, Garth, you need to breathe. I’m okay. Actually, this phone is mine. Well, bought by Cas, but he gave it to me.”
Right now, I’m showing off my dancing moves in the rhythm of one of my favorite songs – Eye Of The Tiger. In the kitchen. Climbed on the counter. While Cas is probably thinking that I’ve gone insane. Well, he was the one who taught me how to use this Alexa box thing. It was a present from Gabe, of course, but since he told me that he doesn’t use it anyway, I took it upon myself to not let it catch dust anymore and use it for playing the greatest hits of all time on it.
So, I snap out. “What the fuck is wrong with you?” He has no reaction, just keeps looking at me just as intensely as he did the first second he stepped into my room. I start to raise my voice even louder. “Is this a new strategy on how to tame the craziest omega no one managed to? Did you make a bet with your other asshole alpha friends that you’ll be the one to do it? Or is this just how fucked up you really are and this is a stupid joke to piss me off?” I feel my fists tightening even more (when did I close them?). That moment, I’m starting to realize the consequences of my stupid outburst. He
But of course, this asshole who suddenly jumps in my way must bring me back to the real world. “What’s a beauty like you doing so lonely right here?” The piece of shit leers, only making me roll my eyes at the stupid pick-up line.
I haven't planned for this, but Garth/Gabriel kinda gives me ideas. What would their name be? Garthiel? XD
. I decide to not respond to this one since it still feels overwhelming for another person to care that much for me. Garth was the same, but Cas is an alpha who also only knows me for a few days. And as strange as it is, it goes the other way around as well, that it feels like I’ve known him since
Though, this seems to get Cas even more panicked. “What? It happened before? Have you seen a doctor? What if you end up not being able to ever get out of that state? What if–”
Seeing my shocked look, she continues. “You’re Cas’s omega, right?” My face is probably getting more flabbergasted by the second but she laughs even harder at it. “Don’t be so shocked! I’m Cas’s colleague from work, but between us,” Charlie then lowers her voice and gets closer to me. “The moment I heard he got an omega, my first instinct was to dig out everything about you, so I know most of your life by now.”
“It’s not that big of a deal, Cas” I shrug. “I do have my own collar given by the center.” Not like I wore a collar that much, since I always used suppressants to pass as an alpha or beta whenever I was outside on my own. But he doesn’t need to know this detail. The thought of running away is also at the back of my mind, but that stupid implanted chip is a pain in the ass and I don’t know where I could get those kinds of devices that Benny used to deactivate the chips and keep everyone out of our tracks.
It still doesn’t hurt but I can feel my stomach turning the deeper it goes. Though the moment I start gagging, a hand goes to my abdomen which suddenly stops the sickness from my stomach. “Do not worry, Dean. Some people have these kinds of reactions when they are nervous. You should feel alright now.”
“Because this is my wish, Dick.” Cas answers, seeming out of patience already, even though that guy hasn’t been here for more than two minutes.
“You can’t, Cas. You’re not even watching it anymore.” I respond, feeling amused by his feeble attempts. “Why are you forcing yourself to watch it if it’s not your cup of tea? Lots of people don’t like horror movies and are scared of them, it’s not something to try to be brave about.”
Cas ignores him and turns to me. “Dean, your arrival here was quite unexpected, so we will need to buy more things for your accommodation and also some food. Would you mind coming with me to the store, or do you feel tired from the trip?”
Though one thing I do remember clearly. The feeling of freedom. I could finally be myself without expecting someone to hurt me because of that. Without always looking over my shoulder, like when I was on the run. I think it’s also the feeling of happiness. Maybe I would’ve been more sure of it, if Cas would’ve been here as well. There’s something strange about him that makes me forget that he’s an alpha and that I could maybe trust him.
coffin before. Ever since I’ve been sold on the black market, I’ve been thrown from alpha to alpha. Endured every punishment, but since I didn’t satisfy their pervert needs of submissiveness, they all eventually gave up and sold me to the next one. This is where I started to dissociate. It helped me get through every punishment and not crack. But there was
.” That moment I thank all the pie lords for having Cas cover me with a blanket like a baby, since it would’ve definitely been a nice
Ignoring the battle cries of Gabriel in the background, we start to follow after Garth who is already quite ahead of us, probably trying to get as far away from Gabriel as well. I whisper to Cas “Please tell me that he won’t live with us? I’ll end up punching him or worse, sooner or later.” Probably sooner. Most probably in a few minutes.
what you think you do Dean! You deserve nice things and good people who appreciate you the way you are!” Garth then lowers his face and says “I admire you a lot Dean. Even after all you’ve been through, you are still fighting for your beliefs. I also can’t talk in the name of my colleagues, but I do know that they’d feel bad if something were to happen to you because we weren’t able to protect you. It’s still a job we chose to do and we also need to keep up with our own beliefs until the end.”
Cas interrupts him by sitting between us on the couch, frowning. “This is disturbing. You are not only insinuating that one of our parents slept around, but also claiming that I’m pursuing an incestuous relationship, since I’m
I try to lift up the mood though. “Yet, you still did dirty stuff at those sex clubs.” I laugh as he helps me get on the bed.
alpha. He hasn’t moved one step, hasn’t made not even a simple facial expression. Just like a robot. A robot with ruffled brunette hair, an intense stare that gets through my very soul and deep,
“It does not make any sense, but okay, Dean.” The whole conversation doesn’t make any sense, but at least I’m distracted from my dirty thoughts, so it’s all good.
“Hello there, feathers!” I amusedly greet Cas, who just came back from work. Right now, I’m stuffing my face with the dozens of pies I bought from the store. After deciding to get something to eat in order to forget about the asshole who ruined my day, I bought all the pies that guy had in the store. His shocked face
Gabriel laughs, putting an arm around Cas. “But that’s why it’s so amazing! Self-destruction has always been the most fun way to pass the time since forever!” Cas rolls his eyes at him, though Gabriel continues happily. “Also, if you get drunk with us, you won’t need to take care of anyone since you’re just as smashed!” Gabriel laughs even louder now, like he’s already drunk.
I’ve already been alive for 27 years now and I know that this world has nothing good to offer to an omega like me who fights against the waves.
“You like those ugly cowboy boots, yet you hate my trench coat.” He confirms then sighs. “Is there anything that you find attractive in
realize that you can take me away from here without needing my permission, you know?” I start raising my voice. “You can do whatever the fuck you want with me. So why the hell would you need my permission? Not only that, but a fucking
“An extremely weird wish, I might add,” The guy – Dick (fitting name) points wildly at me. “All those benefits just for this omega? What would your father think if he were to find out that you’re succumbing to the wishes of such an inferior being?” I can definitely feel my hangover headaches coming back now.
He seems to hold himself back from asking more questions and only answers after sighing deeply. “I only called him, but since he is in another town on a mission, he could not come here.”
“It is nothing, Dean.” He’s still addressing to the walls, but I decide to get it over with the clean-up to finally start the movie. “I will do the dishes, Dean. You always used to do them whenever I cooked.” Cas suddenly starts out of his revere and follows me to the sink.
weird fetishes. If that’s so, then why the hell am I so affected? Why did my heart skip a beat and now is running twice as fast, as if being scared that I will die if it won’t beat like it will recover that moment of silence?
“I took another day off today as well.” He continues talking while preparing the breakfast. “You do not need to worry about it. I have lots of vacation days left and the team is not going to die only from me missing two working days.” When the coffee is done as well, Cas refuses my help to carry them and we go out on the lake terrace. I haven’t been here before, but the view is really outstanding. “It is kind of cold.” Cas says pensively.
His sits on my legs, pining them securely, though his hands are now caressing my torso, reaching for my nipples and rubbing them until they’re hard. “I am not hurting you, Dean. The only thing that is hurting you is your rebellion. The moment you will let go, will be the moment you will stop suffering.”
Gabriel continues unperturbed. “Brother, also, please tell me, do you think it’s normal to act like a kid in love in front of those people? Unlike the rest of our stupid family, we both hated the sick treatment of every being that was considered inferior to us. So, you know it yourself that I have nothing against Dean being an omega, but you also do know that the other people don’t think like that at all! You don’t fucking let them hear shit like that! Do you know how fucking scared I was? It was a fucking institution there, Cas. They could have denounced you at any moment, that you’re not straight in the head and lose everything you’ve fought your whole life!”
“Not on the floor, please–” These are Cas’s last words before I expel the sacred pie on the floor. I do have some lasting weird thoughts that at least the floor is a better place than the toilet to do that.
That moment I remember something. “Wait, Cas. Shouldn’t you go to work today?” He even missed work yesterday because of me.
And this is the second moment of this weird day when I’m being left speechless with only one sentence inside my mind. What the
It's gonna be a long ride with lots of angst, humor (sorry for the bad puns that I'm going to do :), hurt/comfort, fluff and as much wholesomeness as I can.
If they mean that alphas are no longer allowed to kill their omegas and are being supervised to also not beat them to a pulp, then it’s an improvement. Also, maybe supervised is not the right word, since the centers only usually check after a month to see if the omega has any visible wounds and if so, get them back to the center. Though that usually ends up with more bribe from the alpha and the ‘promise’ that he’ll make sure that the omega ‘will be a good boy the next time’.
The moment he kisses towards my stomach and goes for the button of my jeans, I feel some pressure on my legs being released, so I use my whole power to kick him off the bed, even though I know that it’s useless to try to escape with my hands still being tied and also opening that heavy door must be a mission close to impossible. The only way I can have some chances to escape is to
He slowly approaches the bed at that moment, and sits next to me putting his hand on my cheek. “It’s because I love you that I must do that.”
“Okay, Dean. I will come back for you when everything is ready.” Why even this simple sentence is making my knees feel like jelly is beyond me, but I only shrug and go about my business.
“Cas.” He suddenly stops his prattling at the sound of my serious voice. “It’s a sleepover. That’s all. You had sleepovers with your friends, right? I had and I don’t feel uncomfortable
“Are you with me, Dean? Should I take you to the hospital?” He’s suddenly besides me, in front of the wheel. The time is always passing strangely when I’m like this and minutes seem like seconds to me.
head. If someone would’ve told me yesterday that I’ll go shopping with an alpha without putting even the smallest fight and help him carry shopping bags while walking alongside him without a care in the world, I would’ve smacked the crap out of him.
I shrug, since I have no idea how any of these alpha brains work. “She only told me that she knows the brand of diapers my parents used to buy for me as a baby, getting to my today’s preferences in underwear.”
When I notice that Dick has finally calmed down a little, but still giving me disgusted looks, I happily use the opportunity for another dick joke. “Do you have a boner to pick with me? Well, I’m sorry but I don’t speak dick language.” Is all I need to say before he’s two seconds away from blowing up again.
Though before I manage to kick again, he grabs my shins and harshly squeezes them until a whimper escapes my throat. He probably didn’t break them, but the hard slap he gives to my face next shocks me just as much. “I am starting to get tired of your antics, Dean. You seem like you do not want me to treat you gently at all.” He roughly pulls down my jeans and boxers at once. “Or maybe because I am treating you gently, you are shocked by your unexpected enjoyment.” He starts stroking my cock. “This one here seems like it is more honest than you are. Getting so hard and leaking so much. You are actually enjoying this, right Dean? The loss of power and control. Being at my mercy.”
?” I feel my words rolling off my tongue like it’s something that needs to be said. Something that makes even this stoic bastard in front of me to widen his eyes.
face. Not the same could be said about the rest of my body littered in scars made from punishments over the years.
These kinds of thoughts though, also remind me of Sammy when he used to tell me that he’ll become the strongest when he’ll grow up, and that he’ll be the one to protect me then. A bitter taste comes into my mouth at the thought of how different our lives could’ve been if our mother didn’t separate us.
Since this is more of a transition chapter and nothing much happens, I'll also post the next chapter in a few minutes.
“What? What angel powers? I do not understand that reference, Dean.” Cas is back to his always confused state and his cute gestures. I don’t know if I should be mad that he doesn’t get any allusions or head over hills over his adorable quirks.
. I finally deserve some happiness, so I’ll grasp it with whatever crumbs of hope I have left in me, even if it will all end up in disappointment.
After saying my goodbyes to Garth, I leave along with Cas and Gabriel. Gabriel is still sulking and trying to get Cas’s attention, which he adamantly refuses to give it, by looking everywhere else but him.
“What?” I turn irritated at them, though I know the reason they act like that. It’s probably not related to me scratching the table (or maybe that one as well?) but more like related to the fact that omegas usually don’t drink alcohol, since it’d prevent them from slaving efficiently to their alphas as they should. Sometimes, the alphas get them drunk just for fun, but this probably won’t lead them to effortlessly open a beer bottle and drinking so much of it this happily.
“N-no! F-fuck you, you piece of shit. I fucking hate you so much. I hope you die choking on your own blood a thousand times over, you sick fuck!” It makes me so sick. Being touched there usually felt so good, that my body is used to react like now. But my mind is in a complete turmoil. I can’t find a way to escape. I can’t even fight. Fighting only brings more pain. Just like in Hell. Only now it’s not my soul being tortured. Feeling my own body being touched like this awakens even more distress from inside me. I’ve been dreaming for so long to get back into this body, but now I’m starting to wonder what actually hurts more.
Though, before Cas has any chance of making a step in the opposite direction, the loud obnoxious voice of Gabriel resounds in the whole building. “Coome oon brotheer!” His voice gets more serious now. “You know what I meant and you know how this world is, don’t you?”
“Good night, Dean.” Cas says in a hurry before turning off the lights and leaving the room without waiting for my answer.
Of course, that only pissed off the asshole who’s now walking angrily after me. “Who the fuck do you think you are, slut!” Oh yes, the forever used
But they didn’t know that I only needed a few seconds to realize that this would be my life from then on if I wouldn’t escape somehow. That they’ll use this punishment for the rest of my life in order to tame me. They were only two and with the biggest rush of adrenaline I ever had in my life, I headbutted a piece of shit right in the nose and kicked the other. Took a nearby lamp and knocked them unconscious (at least I think they were
I raise my voice then. “Why would you also need my signature? I already gave you my verbal approval!” Which he
Cas is the one lightly holding my hand, his legs sprawled out on the ground and his head laying into an uncomfortable position on the bed. I don’t remember how I got here, but I know for sure that something must have been possessing me to ask him to hold my hand, while looking the weakest I’ve ever been my whole life in front of an alpha.
That was until I heard the doorbell and realized that I’m dreaming of the day when I’m being taken away. Realized that even if I know that, I have no control over my own body when I let my father get his gun to go look through the peephole. I have no control when they break the door and see him getting shot to death, while fighting them. I have no control even when I’m the one running to them ready to fight them to death myself, only to end up pinned on the ground and losing my consciousness when they shove a chloroform-soaked rag into my face.
. I roll my eyes at it, only inducing a new wave of nausea. Dammit. I was so immersed in the conversation that I almost forgot about the war I lost.
I frown back to him, since this is something I never imagined to ever hear from an alpha’s mouth. “Umm, Cas, this is a normal mentality for the alphas, you know?” Including
. Even his deep voice is sending goosebumps through my whole body. It even makes me wonder how would he sound like, while being on top of me and- FOCUS, DEAN! But the next moment when I feel like I collected myself a little more, his next words are crashing into me like those waves that tried to drown me a few years ago into the deepest of ocean. “This must be what love looks like.”
Cas’s thoughtful expression ends and he looks straight in my eyes while saying something that shocks me just as well. “I used to go to this certain sex club where I–” Only to be stopped by Gabriel raising a hand in front of him.
He seems a little taken back by my sudden question that he widens his eyes and says “My apologies, Dean. This should have been the first thing I should have said to you before my impromptu love declaration. My name is Castiel,”
“What?” He slowly raises his head, only now seeming to remember something else. “Dean, all those wrappers… Please tell me you did not eat all of those.” His mood changes are disturbing now. Even more disturbing since he seems to want to drag me away from my pies.
I shake my head and find my baggage that Cas probably brought here himself to take out some change clothes. There are simple ones given by the center, but still better than what I’m wearing. Must be a miracle that I haven’t puked on them.
. I’m still a little skeptical about the reality part, but unexpectedly I’m enjoying it a lot. Not sure if it’s because of the special effects that are really good, or everything that happens there is actually real, but it did give me some scares here and there.
He catches up to me pretty quickly though. “Is this about my trench coat? Do you still hate it that much?”
. I was at their mercy. For the first time in my life, I actually thought that they would leave me there to die. No dissociation could help me from escaping the only destiny I was left with.
A last attempt. “Unfortunately, that dick seems really hard to beat.” Come on Cas, you can get this one!
“Why would my words make you so angry, Dean?” I’ll punch him! Or I would’ve definitely punched him until now if it weren’t for his confused voice and his acting like he has absolutely no idea what’s happening here. Alphas don’t act like this for fuck’s sake! They don’t need my opinions and don’t try to understand me.
“What’s with the trench coat?” I ask Cas, while he tries to find his lost car keys. We already had breakfast (probably lunch in Cas’s case) and we’re almost about to leave for the mall.
During our walk, I do see some confusing looks going our way. I realize now that I forgot my collar, but fortunately Cas’s alpha scent is probably strong enough to keep their curiosity at bay. It’s probably also confusing to see an omega and an alpha walking leisurely together while both are carrying shopping bags. This is usually done only by omegas, never getting help from their alphas, since they need to keep their stupid reputation.
He finally startles out of his daydreaming and shakily makes his way to the bed. “Right… I usually sleep on the right side.” This is probably the first day when Cas is not able to keep eye contact for more than a few seconds for so many times already. At least his embarrassment helps me keep up my composure.
Has this guy lived on the moon? But I’m even more determined now. I’m gonna make a man out of this guy even if it’s the last thing I’ll ever do. “Didn’t you say that you’re gonna steal my heart? You can’t do that if you don’t have moves, man! Follow my lead!”
Welp. It seems that is not that easily to distract Cas’s attention when it comes to stuff like this. “You
After a little too many seconds of silence, Garth finally answers. “Whaaat? Protected you? The great Dean Winchester has been protected by an alpha? What's the world coming to?”
Garth’s speech leaves me at a loss of words, but besides the strange warmth spreading inside, I also feel sorry for the guy.
give delusional vibes to me as well, but I do agree with him that the way to a man’s heart is by giving him pies, burgers or anything that destroys the stomach but feeds the heart!” I say, while solemnly touching my chest.
“Dammit, Cas!” I slam the cup on the table a little harder, Cas looking at me shocked. “Dick jokes, Cas! Did you really not catch a single little one?”
“Cas! Stop it already!” I angrily raise my voice completely stopping him. I know that it’s not his fault, but all the doctors I’ve ever met my whole life, were a bunch of assholes who didn’t give a shit about me and only did painful check-ups on me, or roughly treated any injuries from my punishments enough to not die or not remain with permanent damage. Like I would trust an asshole like that with my mind. Even if the thought of remaining a vegetable my whole life, is a nightmare I often use to have.
After around half an hour of driving and Gabriel pestering either Cas (who was still ignoring him) or me (he kept trying to make me get Cas forgive him – like I'd know how people do this stuff, since I never cared for forgiveness from other persons), during which I kept getting weird side glances from Cas, we get to a nice lake house which looks unexpectedly homey.
Another thing I notice is the sound of TV. Did Cas forgot it on when he left for work? Does he even watch TV before going to work?
“No, no, I’m okay, Cas. You were just too funny, that’s all.” That moment, I also realize something else. Did Gabriel also see my sorry state from yesterday? So, I ask Cas “Did Gabriel come here to help you out?”
A few minutes after he leaves, the person I wanted to talk to, Garth, comes into my room looking just as ruffled as I was when that guy first opened his mouth.
Though for some reason this guy doesn’t seem surprised by this, since he only smiles and shrugs in response. “Not like I didn’t expect this to happen, especially when you asked for this kind of senseless contract,” The asshole flutters the documents from his hands, then takes a seat on the couch; Cas sits next to me on the other one though, eliciting a frown from the jerk. “I know that we’ve already had this conversation, but are you sure you don’t want to reconsider? This is revolting! You even requested for an additional signing space for the omega. Why would you do that?” He’s raising his voice now.
’s the one that did something bad. He probably notices the suspicion on my face and plays the avoidance game again. “This is what I meant by her dating the boss.”
Without thinking too much he answers nonchalantly. “Actually, today, something embarrassing happened to me. For some reason, I found myself in front of my 30-year brother, who most of his life didn’t give a damn for the ones who loved him, but suddenly he’s head over heels for a stranger–”
Cas seems completely confused over what I said, but after a reluctant “Okay” we get back to watching Dr. Sexy. Of course, he only resists a few minutes before letting his jealousy loose again and making another comment.
. My nails bled from scratching the walls. My voice died after hours of pleading. My body hurt after uselessly hitting everything I could with everything I had. I only saw darkness and hear emptiness. I inspired back the air I expired. No escape. Nowhere to run. There was only one thing I could do. The thing that the coffin was made for. To
I decide to not let my self-hate eat again at me and try for a small smile. “How about breakfast, Cas?”
I suddenly wake up drenched in sweat, tucked comfortably in a warm bed but feeling something even warmer surrounding my hand. It’s probably early in the morning since I can sense the first rays of sun, but the room is illuminated enough to see a passed-out figure on the edge of the bed.
As I make my way out of the door, I decide to at least make myself appear busy by talking on the phone that Cas has bought for me that day at the mall – for some reason I always end up in trouble every time I’m alone outside.
I go to the oven and pull out two reheated pies I’ve bought from the store. Cas gives me a concerned look now though. “Is this the first pie you have eaten today?” Momma hen in action. I do try to look nonchalant and only shrug, but Cas only grows more suspicious. “How many, Dean?”
There are also special luxury rooms, where the alpha can ‘try’ an omega before buying him. Unfortunately, lots of alpha scums want to
Of course, I must also give my own parting words to him. “Too bad it’s the last time you come here, right? It must be hard to suck it up, but you need to realize that your services are not satisfying at all! You need to stop being so cocky!” I scream after him, while he madly stomps his way out of the house. “His parents must’ve really liked dicks to name him like that.” I say mockingly, while Cas is keeping his forever confused look.
Before opening my mouth and asking more about it, he stops in front of a store. I was so engrossed in our conversation that I didn’t notice that we already got into civilization. Now that I realize, it was quite a short walk despite the lots of nature around Cas’s house.
Gabriel turns exasperatedly to him. “Brother, I can’t take this anymore! Are you planning to do the ignoring game just like before? Do you know how much I suffered being ignored by you for a whole month? You’re the only one who can understand me in this whole world!” Gabriel laments dramatically while making weird gestures in the air.
Cas definitely notices. I can’t see his face but he’s completely still and tense. His fists are tight. Yet, he doesn’t say anything. Doesn’t move. A few minutes when I feel calm enough, I turn around and give him an “Okay” in a small, tight voice, then make my way to the kitchen in an attempt to occupy myself with anything else.
When he returns, we both stay in our own chair, wrapped in the fluffiest blankets I’ve ever felt. This is really
He stops eating and puts his sandwich back on the plate. “Because this is what I felt and still feel, Dean.”
Opening my eyes after what seemed only a few moments later, I realize that instead of Cas’s warm chest, I’m hugging a pillow. At least he’s holding my hand, but is he really hating cuddling that much to replace himself with a pillow? There’s lot of light in the room, so it’s probably quite late. At least it’s Saturday and I didn’t make Cas miss another work day. Though him sleeping this late is unusual. Did he try to watch over me after that, or did I have more nightmares?
Cas is smiling now a little and I feel that warmness inside my chest that I always seem to get whenever he gives these sweet little smiles. I know him for so little time, but I definitely got it bad for his face. Probably not only the face, but there’s no need to duel on these feelings right now.
I hate him. I don’t think I’ve ever hated anyone as I hated him this moment. Even if he’s gentle with me, this only turns my stomach even more. Violence is something that I’m used to. Violence hidden in gentleness disgusts me as nothing before.
“You are not serious.” Cas says incredulously while looking back and forth at me and the pie. “This pie is mine, Dean.” His serious face while saying this makes me so proud of him for some reason. Like he’s a true pie warrior right now, only that he tries to protect me from it, not the other way around like I would do. So, he starts eating it while looking annoyed at me. He’s like an angry puppy now. So cute.
After buying some ingredients and some essentials for me, we’re both carrying the many shopping bags, while making our way back.
Opening my eyes, I can see handcuffs keeping my arms tied to a headboard. I’m also laying in a comfortable bed, though this situation is anything but comfortable.
As a side note, I'll add the next chapter in a few minutes, since I didn't expect to love Garth this much and spend a whole chapter on him, while also wanting you to meet Cas as soon as possible.
After that, we’re only talking when absolutely necessary. Cas still seems uncomfortable, especially when we get to big crowds, but he keeps insisting on buying other things for me. Like a phone, but since we are both ‘noobs’ as the annoyed employee calls us, we take a random one he shows us.
He seems more relaxed, now that he sees that I have a relatively normal reaction to his crazy offer. He says “You will still appear of being under my tutelage, so you will not have any other problems and can do whatever you want, without being in danger of being taken back to an omega center. Also, I will finance you for the rest of your life and you can find your own love at your choosing without me interfering with you at all.” His eyes do seem a little sad at this last sentence though.
Though, there’s also a thought in the back of my mind of what would happen if I were to refuse him. Would he throw a fit? Leave forever? Come back later to try again? Or just force me like a normal alpha? Well, I don’t think he’d try to force me after all this fight to convince me, but who knows? Either way is not worth the risk of him leaving and lose this opportunity.
After getting back from our little trip, we find my baggage in the small hall, right in front of the entrance door and Gabriel sprawled on the couch from the living room, surrounded by all kinds of sweets – bags of chips in his arms, two lollipops in his mouth, while sweets I didn’t even know they existed were scattered all over the couch, table, floor. Our trip probably didn’t last more than 20 minutes, but everything around Gabriel was already a disaster, and judging by Cas’s scornful expression, this isn’t how his house looked like when he left.
Cas continues then. “After I made you some sandwiches, you both puked on the ground and passed out there,”
I end up going back to watching a new episode of Dr. Sexy, but for some reason I feel pretty exhausted myself and by the end of it, I decide to turn in for the night as well. Though, on my way to bedroom I’m stopped by Cas getting out of his room. He fidgets again, not being able to keep eye contact more than a few seconds. “Are you okay, Cas?”
I answer solemnly. “Cas, they’ve done nothing wrong to me. I was the one who hurt their pride by puking them. I shall never blame them for something I brought on myself.”
“Dude! Did you just teleport here, or what the hell? Keep those angel powers in check, man.” I say exasperatedly, trying to calm my poor heart. No idea how he can move so ninja-like especially with that trench coat. Or maybe that’s the secret and its ugliness hides some secret powers after all.
I'll also treat some sensitive subjects, but since it's a WIP, I promise to add any triggers in tags and notes as we get to them.
After I calm down a little, I put the jacket in his arms, murmur a “We’ll get this.” and leave the store the next second, with Cas wordlessly going alone to pay for everything.
Garth. He wants to see the beautiful parts of the people around him, but only if he knew what his colleagues are capable of.
Until they opened the coffin. Even now I remember their laughing faces. I couldn’t see them well in the beginning. But little by little I got used to the light, to the fresh air, to the
Gabriel only smirks proudly at him. “Ohoo! Cas, the overprotective hubby!” He continues dramatically. “But don’t worry my little brother, despite my initial reticence, I shall not come between you lovebirds! Not when little Cassy is finally getting the hang of it!” he says while slowly squeezing Cas’s cheeks.
. A comfortable silence falls between us while we eat, but I do feel Cas stealing glances at me now and then. I’ve been meaning to ask him ever since we met, but I never got to with everything that happened. “The first time we met,” He makes eye contact with me. “Why did you tell me that you probably love me?”
Shit Shit Shit. He starts to pick up his pace, but I try to focus on his words, not the pleasure that starts to spread everytime he moves, even though my brain still fights on trying to make my body sick at the same time. I can’t live like this. Hell is not a better option either, though a sick part of me still feels that I’d rather torture others, than feeling this kind of humiliation.
. “Oh.” He clears his throat and finally changes the subject as well. “If it would not be a bother to you, you can give it a try tomorrow. I will leave the credit card on the counter as always if you are in a need to shop for more ingredients. But, Dean… No overdoses on pies again, please. You could really end up in the hospital.” Cas now has a concerned look.
Unfortunately, Karen turns her attention to me. “You're so lucky to have such a celebrity as your alpha! Let’s be friends! Here’s my number!” She excitedly thrusts a business in my hands and leaves. “Call me!” She says while merrily going her way. What the
I decide to stop the poor guy’s suffering that moment though – he told me from the beginning that he has no expectations from me, but I didn’t think that he’s
“Cas!” It’s my turn now to interrupt his erratic way of thinking. “I’m peachy. No need to go all momma hen on me. I’m also
I feel bile rising to my throat at the unwanted touches, his teeth also gently biting on a nipple over the shirt. I scream at him. “You’re a piece of shit! I don’t want anything you’re doing right now. Don’t you fucking give me your fucked up rationality. This is not freedom. You’re abusing your power to force your way through things when you see they don’t go as you wanted. You’re no
While she stares in shock, I turn off the speakers and end the call after reassuring Cas that I’ll be okay.
Cas asks incredulously though. “How can you still love pies after what they have done to you, Dean?”
Cas wears a dumbfounded face after my outburst, but Gabriel smirks like he knows what’s going on. Fine, asshole. “Gabe, truth or dare?”
“It’s already this late…” Cas says, melancholically looking at the clock. “I have already prepared your room, so we can go there now,” Instead of getting up he still looks expectantly at me. “Before that, I did not tell you about my schedule. From tomorrow on I will be at work from nine to five, weekends free. Of course, you can spend your time however you wish. We also have Netflix if you choose to stay at home or you can go out and explore whenever you wish. Just…” He sighs that moment looking a little sad. “I do not like to this, but would you mind if you were to wear a collar outside? I am worried about your safety and even if this is a small area, bad people are everywhere… At least they should refrain more if they see… the collar.”
He turns around, his expression still a little ruffled, but answers “Your first kiss. When was your first kiss?”
will come back. Fortunately, they’re not happening very often despite my shitty life, but when they happen, they’re
“Okay–” He probably realizes that moment what I just said and starts babbling. “No, Dean… That’s not– I mean–”
The next day, I finally manage to get out of bed – after spending most of the night finishing a whole season, Cas abandoning me pretty early – in order to make my way out to the store and buy more ingredients for my first tentative of cooking in a long time.
I smirk, having an idea what his next words are going to be. “Why is Novak in love with you, Dean?!” only for Garth to prove me wrong. No
Although if I were in my right mind, I would’ve told him that tormenting himself to watch a horror movie for this kind of reason is childish. But I know that Cas has his own way of thinking and I can’t make fun of someone who not only tries to better himself, but also almost got his ass kicked when he tried to protect me from those asshole alphas.
That moment, Gabriel seems to forget his pain though, since he suddenly sneers. “How about for every refusal, we’d have to drink a big shot of beer?”
One finger becomes two and then three. Like a countdown until the breaking point. I feel him hitting something inside that makes me tighten around his fingers. I know what that is. “The prostate.” He says. And of course, he keeps hitting there again and again stirring unwanted sounds from me. It feels weird and disgusting. I want him to stop but I know that he won’t. Even if I keep cursing like I kept doing the whole time, it doesn’t help with anything.
“Nah. He’s as tame as a kitten. Despite him not understanding my glorious puns, he’s actually quite fun to have around, you know.” I do sense an unexpected drop of gentleness in my voice when I talk about Cas.
“For some strange reason he’s acting the same in front of other alphas as well and almost got beat up himself while trying to protect me. He’s an oddball for sure.” A smile makes its way on my face and I now realize that I’m actually walking aimlessly. I even passed the store, but there are not so many people around and it’s quite a nice weather for a little walking after so many days of being secluded in the house watching Dr. Sexy.
Cas breaks his empty staring by answering me. “I have been knowing him ever since we were children. My family always collaborated with their family law business and they used to bring him during diners. Never liked him too much though. He is putting himself on too much of a greater pedestal.” He frowns, looking at his own cup which seems to be half empty by now.
My thoughts stop when I feel something suddenly tightening around my hand; that’s right, Cas is still holding my hand and now I realize that he probably called my name many times but I started to dissociate again. “I do not know how I can help you, Dean.” His expression looks as despairing as I remember seeing it yesterday, during the few seconds of consciousness I sometimes got.
Actually, the whole day was a complete disaster. Instead of a fun date and messing around with Cas, I became an emotional mess and even had a panic attack. But Cas, unlike every alpha I’ve ever met, not only tried to stop those alphas, he stayed and took care of me. Even now, he’s holding my hand, after so many hours, despite sleeping in such an uncomfortable position.
I only give a wink back at him, but I do feel my heart growing under his praise, so I try to keep my mind in the present and enjoy the food without thinking of unpleasant memories.
He turns to look hesitantly into my eyes now. “What if I end up hurting you? I cannot control my reactions very well during these moments.”
At least until a certain moment in time, when we both had enough alcohol and my memory got foggy from then on.
“He is not a bad guy” mumbles Cas, while we walk down a small bridge. The weather is pretty nice with lots of nature and fresh air. It doesn’t even compare to the small garden where I sometimes spend my time at the center. Though, it makes me remember a lot more of the last time when me and Benny managed to lose the police in the forest, only for us to get lost ourselves. The weather was just as nice even then and it was more easier than we expected to find our way back.
“When the hell freezes over!” I suddenly shout, trying to keep distance from an approaching Cas. “My body shall not reject this piece of heaven that finally made its way through it!” I dramatically proclaim, feeling like a warrior who’s about to be attacked by the enemy. That’s right. Cas is the enemy and he shall not prevail!
“Dean!” I suddenly raise my head, watching a worried Cas making his way to me. “Are you okay? I kept calling you but you seemed deep in thought. Do you have a fever? Your face is getting red. I will bring a thermometer–”
I do feel a lot appreciation for the way Garth tries to humanize some words. It’s not ‘release contract’, more like a
The last thing I remember before ending up in this empty weird room is a deafening static sound and the broken glass.
. He continues. “I also apologize for my words. I have not realized that they would affect you so much. I do have the bad tendency to say the wrong things at the wrong time,” No shit, Sherlock. “So, I would like to start anew. Nice to meet you, Dean.”
After cleaning the floor and giving me some medicine, (now realizing that I never took so many pills as I did these two days) Cas stares at my miserable form holding my stomach and lying on the patient couch (I’ll call it that from now on, since I keep using it during my sufferings). He does have a reproachful look, but it’s weirdly mostly mixed with worriedness, and the way he carefully draped the soft blanket over me made me feel a bit guilty.
me even though they have no intention for a purchase. Though, that just usually ends up with me getting punished and me not being very fazed by that, which makes them even angrier. Compared to the punishments I received during my black-market omega days, these ones are like a walk in the park to me, especially since they are not allowed to do visible damage to us.
Before getting ready to leave, something else catches my attention. I almost didn’t notice it, since it was on a pretty hidden clothing rack, but its material suddenly drew my eyes on what seems to be
I can visibly see a full body tremble coming from the mortified man, who quickly turns with his tail between his legs and hurryingly leaves.
appellative. “You only exist to take cock! Maybe I should take you right here in front of everybody!” He starts laughing, only increasing the sinking feeling in my stomach that I started to forget about. He could do that though, and nobody would stop him. It’s usually illegal to do public sexual acts but with the right bribe even the police will ignore them – though it’s not like anyone would dare report him.
He seems to consider it a little, then sighs and nods unhappily though. “I see, Dean. If that is your wish, I will not meddle into this any further. But if you were to change your mind someday, I do know a doctor that I have a lot of trust in, and I have the feeling that you would like her as well.” Seeing that my only reaction is a bored shrug he continues. “But we should do something about that, though. Also, about your dissociation.” I do startle a little when I hear that. “We can try some home remedies and recommendations that I found on the internet. Nothing invasive or uncomfortable, of course. Would you like to at least hear about them?”
“Hey, Cas? Will you look at me?” He’s the one who has his head bowed this time around, so I feel like I need to make him feel better somehow. When he finally raises his head and looks at me, I can feel a big smile creeping on my mouth. “You’re awesome!”
Cas frowns at his own cup from his hands. “Fortunately, Dick is completely terrified of my brother and he had the instincts to run away the second he saw my murdering brother coming towards him.” Of course he missed again my genius dick joke.
After eating some eggs and taking the pills given by Cas (I still have half of mind to be wary of unknown pills, but the rest of it would rather get drugged than feel like being thrown in front of multiple buses), a walking dead me and even more begrudgingly walking dead Gabriel – who was threatened with another month of ignoring and no visiting – start with the horrible mission of cleaning up all this mess.
“Wanna take a piss, if you’d so kindly let me go.” I grumpily answer him, using my wonderful morning voice. Even a bear would sound more pleasant than I do right now.
“Cas, you don’t have to keep watching if it scares you that much, you know?” I finally say, deciding that I tortured him enough.
Only then, we reach a luxurious extravagant Tesla; Gabriel takes the driver’s seat, but unexpectedly, instead of taking the shotgun, Cas sits next to me in the back and keeps looking intendedly at his window.
After Cas returns, we finally get to eat. The food is unexpectedly amazing. I was always a good cook, but I didn’t expect it to end up so good on the first try. I first learned to cook after my mother left me and my father and I had to look after the house while he was working. I was around 15 at that time, four years before getting caught by the black-market dealers, but I still had to cook even after that for some alphas, or when I was with Benny.
seem a little threatening though. “And as for my father, I do not believe that there is much left for me to do to increase his existing disappointment in me.”
she look into me? It’s not like my info is one click away or something.” I mumble, starting to wonder what their jobs actually are. Gabe said that he has a normal job, but who knows what a normal job means to these guys.
He quickly realizes his sudden outburst and now he’s looking at the ground in shame. “Cas, I was kidding. And no need to be ashamed. You’re a pervert, just like everyone else,” Of course my words are making him look even guiltier.
“I’m in the mood for a horror movie.” I say after he finished his pie and while he’s drinking some water, which he immediately chokes on. “What’s with you and choking today, Cas?” I flirty wink at him, but he’s not even looking at me in the eye now.
“Want to grab a milkshake?” I suddenly hear a voice and turn to see some sad blue eyes looking my way. “Gabriel always said that sweets make sad people happy.”
He seems to stare even more intently at my reaction now, while reluctantly asking. “Have you ever seen a doctor about it?”
Jealous Cas is definitely the last thing I needed for this evening. I shrug. “Not… really.” Though I don’t sound very confident.
At least the lights are on now and I can focus on Cas trying to talk to me. Theoretically it should only last a few minutes, but I swear that it always feels like hours. Fortunately, this one seems to pass quite quickly – probably because I feel more relaxed with Cas here – and I’m able to move my fingers enough to caress Cas’s palm. He seems to deflate a little when he feels it. “That is right, Dean. Just like that. Focus on me. You are safe. I am here for you.” This guy should do ASMR or something, since his deep voice is pulling me back to sleep for some reason. Before I let my eyelids completely close though, I’m able to move enough to bury my face into his chest. This feels so
Actually, if I were to ignore the apocalypse around Gabriel, the rest of the house is really clean. Besides Gabriel’s couch which is the bigger one, there are two other couches next to it and a TV in front of them, playing some K-pop music. Behind the couches there is an open-space kitchen, which is where me and Cas are heading right now. There is also a door next to the stairs that lead to the second floor.
“Dean? Are you okay?” Cas is immediately next to me, worryingly trying to get me to talk. This probably goes for a while, since I seem to miss lots of his conversation with the police and then him trying again to get a reaction out of me.
“It’s actually nice.” I say absentmindedly. The cold is actually helping me clear my mind better and even the nice view is already making me feel relaxed.
Some part of me wants to see just how angry Cas could get, but the biggest part can no longer stop the dick jokes from coming out. “Come on Cas, dicks will always be dicks. A pain in the ass, you know. No need to raise that much attention to them.” I smugly say while the dick goes red.
. They all only need an omega who can satisfy their pervert needs and why not, also be their personal maids and punching bags when they feel like it.
“Dean, you will get sick,” He approaches me, now noticing even more empty packages and his face getting more troubled by the second. “You need to puke them.”
Gabriel just laughs and pulls out his lollipops, smirking. “Some on my secret spots, most of them from my truck. I always have extras just in the unexpected case of my brother suddenly deciding to bring a boyfriend home and not having enough provisions to win him over.”
“Dean, an alpha will come see you today.” This was the first thing Garth said to me the moment he woke me up.
“Mhm. Mornings are such a pain. I’ve always hated ‘em.” I murmur, not completely awake yet, but capable of having a simple conversation at least.
. I try to stop my thoughts and finally answer the question. “I was pretty drunk at that time, but if you need an age, it was around 17 years old, I think?”
“Dean, is this what you find attractive in a man?” Cas asks in a serious tone, but still a little concerned.
He makes a grimacing face like he can already feel the punch and answers “I would rather avoid that,” He straightens up. “I have a proposition for you, Dean.”
Cas opens his mouth, probably trying to form a response, though Gabriel stops him by suddenly roaring “Let’s get drunk!”
So, I decide to take Cas’s offer and get outside for some fresh air and maybe buy myself some sweet pies.
. I really am the worst of the worst. I’m treating like this a person who spent a whole night taking care and being worried shitless for an ungrateful son of a bitch like me. My whole life I thought that the alphas are the biggest trash out there, but what about me? When I finally meet a weird nice alpha, why is my first instinct to snap at him for everything?
Now that I look better, his eyes are becoming a warmer blue under the light of the sun. Thankfully, I snap out my cheesy thoughts pretty quickly and shrug. “Was expecting a great Novak like you to have a fortress with an army at the entrance. Didn’t expect such a family house instead.”
“Touché. You’ll never let these little events go, won’t you?” I sheepishly respond while making our way to the garage.
Of course, here and there only applies to me. Poor Cas has given up on watching it as he should, ever since the second jump scare. Now, he only gets an eye out of the pillow to watch my reactions and sometimes looks at the TV as well when he probably deems me relaxed enough.
“If you’re just sitting in your car outside, and you don’t need assistance, then you should probably come inside. I know Sam’s not with you, so I brought you some company. You shouldn’t be alone.”
“Doesn’t mean we can’t celebrate it anyway,” he said more quietly, smiling at Cas. “It was a pretty noteworthy occasion, you pulling me outta hell. What did you have in mind?”
“I can’t believe you’re in my house, just standing there like that,” Cas said, waving a hand up and down at Dean.
“You go get yourself taken care of, and give me a call when you’re feeling better. I’ll take you out for coffee to thank you for not pressing me to death like a common witch.”
“It’s been more than 20 minutes, I think,” Dean said softly when he was right behind Cas, one hand up and hovering a few inches above the angriest looking abrasion  along Cas’s shoulderblade.
“Why does it sound like I’m in trouble for something?” Dean asked, knowing how Crowley appreciated people getting directly to the point.
Ed stood there and blinked for a second, turned around and frowned at the deceptively utilitarian entryway, and then slowly stepped out onto the landing to get a better look inside.
Jody and Cas were both already reading over their emails while Dean just glared at the doorway where Crowley had disappeared.
He was well and truly confused now, sitting there staring at Cas who looked just as baffled as he felt. Luckily for him, Crowley must’ve been feeling generous because he didn’t keep Dean in suspense for long.
Dean snorted at that. “You’re awake, Cas. We’re in Maine, hunting for something that’s making all the locals pitch the skeletons in their closets out onto their front yards for the whole world to see.”
Cas had said everything could change in ten years, and he hadn’t been kidding. Eleven years ago, he was fresh outta hell and was still coming to grips with the fact that angels were real, and now he was sitting in his own kitchen just chilling with one. The same kitchen where God had once cooked them up pancakes while Cas had still been possessed by Lucifer. The same kitchen where he’d sat with his resurrected father and cooked dinner with his resurrected mother. The same kitchen where he’d told Sam he couldn’t imagine living any other life than the one that had led him right here, surrounded by the people he loved and loved him in turn. And it had all happened in little more than a decade.
“I got her grief,” Dean said, not taking his eyes from Cas. “Gloria, the ghost. That kinda longing, the loss, I know exactly how that feels.”
“As an education professional, I’m appalled that none of your prior teachers encouraged you to nurture your hobby,” Cas couldn’t help replying.
how many people are willing to talk to a guy pretending to be an investigative journalist or a historian making a documentary. It opens a lot of doors. But I mostly handle vengeful spirits. I’ve run across the occasional ghoul. Helped a guy out with a shapeshifter once.” Ed shuddered at the memory, and Dean completely sympathized.
Dean blinked up at him, as if seeing Cas there for the first time. “I think distraction’s probably the way to go for now.” Dean sipped at his coffee and closed his eyes for a moment, before giving him a serious look. “So how did your thing yesterday go. The person like your story?”
It was all true, at least. Feathers didn’t have to know exactly what Charlie had been trying to talk him into. Feathers was already typing out a reply, and despite a number of new message notifications popping up in the general chat channel, Dean sat there staring at the screen until Feathers was done.
“If you’d be more comfortable, and if it’s okay with Mildred, I can take you back to one of the exam rooms where you can recline and take some of the pressure off that shoulder.”
Again, Impala had hesitated on replying, and Cas’s heart sank just a little bit. He was considering breaking his rules for Dean, but he hadn’t been expecting Impala to seem… hurt? It was often hard to read emotions behind text conversations, but Impala definitely seemed at least disappointed. They’d been talking online for years, and Cas had rarely even allowed himself to share entirely innocuous and generic information about himself with Impala. And now he was talking about bringing someone who knew him in real life into the fandom, and giving Impala nothing more than he’d ever had before.
Cas grinned at the disgusted face Dean made, and nodded. “Our apartment smelled like melted plastic and burnt potato soup for weeks. It was years before I could stomach eating them again, but I trusted Mildred enough to give these a try when I started working here.” He dipped another one of the crispy golden nuggets in ketchup and popped it in his mouth.
“Whatever,” Ed pressed on. “Point is, there’s not a lot for them to film. What’s their reason for being there? No way in hell is that place haunted. Especially with you guys living practically next door.”
It had in no way been as simple as that, and Dean knew it, but examining the failure of his relationship with Lisa hadn’t been all that much more complicated, either. They were together because it had been easy, until it wasn’t anymore.
Cas huffed out a laugh. “As long as you’ll remind me to eat lunch every day, I won’t need to keep an emergency supply of peanut butter and jelly in my office.”
“As ready as I’m gonna be, thanks in part to you, by the way.” Dean leaned ever so slightly toward Cas, stopping well shy of bumping shoulders. He had no idea where the impulse to the overly-familiar gesture had come from, but he gave himself a mental pat on the back for reining it in.
Violently thrown back, I snap my wings open to halt the fall so I won’t crash into the ground. The air movement it generates blows ashes and embers away from me. The cloud of souls scatters like a swarm of fireflies. I rise up to the sky clutching my wounded forearm where it’s bleeding Grace, while a cold and stunned rage swallows me whole. Camael attacked me. Worse yet, he is compromising my mission. I’ll have to do it all over gain should Cain see Angels fighting. My blade materializes into my hand.
"You don't understand." I can feel myself growing irritated. "The soul that Humans carry inside of them is shaped and altered by each of their actions. I managed to cleanse the stain from Dean's, but he still has his memories and all the guilt attached to them. I'm not confident that I can re-purify the soul if it gets tainted to the same extent! I saw what Hell did to him, and what you want to ask of him will damage his soul, revive in him the taste of cruelty, and ruin his redemp–"
"This is ridiculous and a waste of our time," Uriel groans at my side, slumping a bit more into his seat with obvious annoyance.
But orders are orders, and it is for my loyalty and devotion that I have been chosen to carry out the mission. Anger is pointless, and Camael will endure much more suffering before he dies. I am a good son, I will not fail my Father.
The charred pattern of his wings is imprinted on the ground - the same wings that have patted my back or wrapped me in a silky cocoon so often in the past. It fully covers the demon trap and extends across the entire wrecked place, outlining every feather.
No. He would never. Or would he? I know that in theory our blades can kill us. But Camael would never do such a thing.
The wind is blowing ripples on the surface of the wide saline lake, here, in Siosp's former sector. The water is dark, sliced from side to side by a flaming trail as the sun is melting into the ground.
I’ve grown used to be supervised. After millions of years of solitude, hearing the Garrison’s voices in my head and only meeting them every now and then, this is a welcome change. My brothers used to be almost abstract concepts to me, but now I’m beginning to really know them, their personality and what makes them different from one another.
It is surprising to find that after all he has been through, and with the rare privilege of standing in the presence of an Angel, Dean keeps doubting what he sees and hears.
And all of a sudden, I see it. A soul bright and radiant just like Adam and Eve's once were, but already tainted by darkness and corruption. The righteous man’s soul, without a doubt. The demon was telling the truth.
The fresh layer of snow crunches under my feet as I walk up to the bench and take a look around - there is no living thing here, and the winter white coat hushes and muffles all sounds from the city. Ice particles glisten in the light of the late afternoon, and the bare tree branches stretch their shadows out across the bright gray sky.
It is strictly forbidden for us to appear before Adam and Eve's eyes. We never reply to their prayers, however poignant they may be. Nevertheless, there is always a soldier from the Garrison on guard near them, invisible, who has to report back everything they do and say to Anael afterwards. We don't see Anael that much lately, he is busy with interdivisional meetings, statistics and reports he has to write down, among other tedious tasks that became mandatory since Paradise was created.
Now that's offensive. I'm doing all I can to protect Dean and save them both from the tragic end that Fate has planned for them. And no one acknowledges or appreciates my hard work, as usual.
"Castiel, please let me explain. I did hear your call for backup earlier when you were fighting Alastair, but I couldn't come to your rescue because..."
Thankfully, Jesus is not in any danger. We have warned Joseph about this through a dream, and they have fled to Egypt to be safe.
I have had the opportunity to visit tens of thousands of human Paradises over the last few centuries. They all depict memories of happiness, laughter, love. Or sometimes they were created out of thin air by their imagination - but that only applies to the few Humans who have never experienced a single moment of true happiness in their lives. I have explored these fragments of life during my missions of soul-selection and my contribution to intense debates on the admission or rejection of particular cases.
He manages to set me free and I whirl around. My brother just stabbed the creature with his blade, but it doesn’t seem to be effective. The oozing monster looks unharmed. Riemu suddenly disappears from my sight when two creatures bring him down, and before I have any chance of helping him, five more attack me at the same time.
Benny's voice. His blurred face comes briefly in front of me, and I squint my eyes. The world's spinning around me and a searing pain bores into my skull.
"You sure are a lot of fun in the Garrison! Fine, let's get you an exemption. I'll pass this on directly to the administration as a one-time exception."
"Farewell," I whisper before exploding the reflecting surface with a flick of my hand. Glass shards shoot and slice into the air, sending glowing fragments of light everywhere, but I’m long gone before they fall back to the ground.
"Great. Avoid paperwork by adding more paperwork... Remind me, is he the Angel of Joy or the Angel of Masochism?" Uriel whispers to me.
He places a finger above the house and makes a small movement. Every item in the kitchen suddenly starts floating before Jimmy's astonished eyes. He takes a step backwards, frantically crossing himself.
I was unable to lead the Garrison, nor could I live up to the hierarchy's expectations. I failed in my role as General, and now I feel unworthy of my Guardian title. I’m unable to protect Dean.
Thank you! That's what I've been saying for centuries! The sole response I've been given was to be sent on resurrection duty with the Garrison... Humans pose a real hazard that the higher chain of command won't be able to ignore forever!"
"I'd like to be sure, Dean: if your angel's too fat to pass the portal, you and me we're leaving this shit hole anyway, right?"
I know better than anyone that to gank a werewolf, you have to dismember it or shove a silver blade in its heart. But that's the rule on Earth and here and now I don't have silver and no time to chop it in slices. I've been beheading monsters non-stop for months without stopping to identify their species, and I came to the conclusion that rules are slightly different in here. I never linger long enough to check if the beheading was effective on monsters other than vampires, ghouls, arachnes and other joys. Behead first, think later. This is the only rule to follow in here. And even if the mutt makes it, he's chained to that tree with a slayed brain. If other monsters don't eat him, I'm pretty sure he won't be willing to bother us anymore.
"What Samandriel said is true. Cain is indeed alive and his soul is undamaged. Which makes the charge brought against Camael null and void."
I tighten my grip on my weapon, throwing her an icy look. Why is she specifically talking to me? As though she believes she can draw me into her fall. That's offensive. I'm a loyal soldier and I would never betray my Creator.
"Is it really necessary to waste a soldier to babysit, Castiel? You already deprived the Garrison of an Angel to idly watch over your vessel's family..."
The red glow in Eve's eyes intensifies and the fire gradually fades over the entire area, like a nightmare dissipating.
Within the Garden, mortals don't suffer, age or have any kind of physical need. In its center Father grew the Tree of Knowledge whose apples can widen the human or animal mind, and the Tree of Eternal Life. Adam and Eve are not allowed to touch them for the moment. I heard that God plans to give them the fruits as a reward once they have proven their faith, love and obedience.
This woman - Pamela - was twice the victim of my arrogance. After losing her sight, she died because of my reckless initiative, which never was approved by my superiors. Even though my plan ultimately resulted in a victory, I used the Winchesters and my own siblings as pawns and things could have gone very wrong. Dean and Sam could have died. Out of sheer selfishness and pride, I led Baradiel and Levanael into the ugliest kind of disobedience, and if it weren't for Uriel who assumed responsibility for my actions, we all might have ended up in rehabilitation or executed.
When my wing brushes against Brap's, he huffs and brings his wings tighter together behind his back to avoid contact.
"Rzionr Nrzfm," I say disapprovingly. "Why are you equipped with a vessel not yet out of childhood? We were told only adults were qualified."
I unclasp my hands and turn my head to him - I fear I'm starting to understand his point. The same thing Anpiel had implied without clarifying what she meant.
I feel myself getting tenser with effort as I annihilate this fragment of life to replace it by a long and lonely day of walk and an uneventful night. Cain’s soul is burning like lava when I implant those fake memories to fill the gap I created.
Uriel is standing silently at my left, and Anael looks tensed at my right. Two Human females are crying at our feet with tears streaming down their face. The entire Garrison is gathered behind us. I gaze up at the four Archangels, my older brothers, all radiating with light and power. Lucifer looks upset and deep in thought.
Rachel bravely struggles to stand on his feet while the other Angels obey and fly away. He is leaning on me, which leaves me no other choice but to remain here instead of going back to my mission as ordered.
I stay alone there, listening to Eve's crystal-clear voice humming her lullaby, the one Abel will be listening to for all eternity.
After carrying the cross up the hill with the help of a bystander, Jesus collapsed to the ground. And now the guards are tearing the scarlet cloak off and laying him down on the cross. The rusty, blunt point of the nail – which has undoubtedly been used many times before – presses against one of his wrists and the hammer strikes down, driving it in with one blow and ripping a cry of pain out of our brother. Blood is gushing out and dripping to the ground while the executioner moves to his other wrist and then to his feet, placing them one on top of the other – he has to hammer the nail repeatedly to break the bone structure there, sweating profusely in the midday sun.
"What do you intend to do once we're outside?" I end up saying to break the awkward silence. "We have no more Apocalypse to stop, and Leviathans are out of the game. You're
And I realize that once more, the Apocalypse was prevented because the enemy preferred to surrender rather than see the Creation destroyed.
The righteous man is praying, to me. Just the thought of it sends joy through my heart and brings a smile to my lips. My wings twitch as I look up as though it might help me hear better.
And to do that, I have to sacrifice this body and soul that are not mine and that I was only meant to borrow as a vehicle to fulfill my mission. The heartbeat pumps blood through the veins and I can feel every organ, even the thinnest vein of this flesh and bone body. Numb, wrapped inside my Grace, Jimmy Novak's soul is glowing, oblivious to my dire intentions for him. His soul won't survive the process. It will be drained of its essence, for the sole purpose of saving Sam and Dean. Jimmy Novak will never see his family again, he will never go to Heaven, his existence will be wiped out and annihilated to the core. To save Humanity from the Apocalypse. To save the Humans under my protection. To fulfill my own selfish and unholy desire.
I only roll my eyes at him and look through the window during the short ride to the mall. Unexpectedly the car drives better than looks. Its shape does resemble my baby a little, though it’s a million years away from her in every aspect.
“Same life, you know. Work, home, sleep. But more interesting is probably what you’ve been up to, Dean. How's your new life? How's that alpha? Is he treating you, right? Actually, wait! You’re not calling me because you need help, right? Did you steal this phone from him to contact me?”
Cas nodded blankly at him, like nothing Dean had said really made any sense, in any context. Dean hurried to cover all his bases, hoping to find Cas on at least one of them.
“I got maybe an hour more left on her appointment, but you’re welcome to hang out here any time you need. I can close up the shop, and as soon as I’m done you can tell me what’s up, okay?”
“I do have clothes, Dean. I didn’t show up here naked, you know,” Cas says, but he drops his towel and pulls on the soft cotton pants anyway.
Cas nodded slowly, this time Dean letting him get there on his own. “But you want to have a thing… with someone?”
“Yeah, okay,” he said, his voice pitched slightly higher than he was happy with as he scooped up his clean clothes. “You know what? I was packing and I think I accidentally packed the clean underwear I meant to bring with.” He nearly dropped his boots cringing at how idiotic he sounded, but pressed on. “I’m just gonna… go, and I’ll tell Sammy you’re on the way.” He didn’t even glance back at Cas as he fled.
Dean rolled his eyes, but appreciated Jody’s solidarity. He opened the door to the staff room and waved her inside, to find Donna and Cas sitting nervously at a table while Crowley leaned against the counter alternately sipping from and sneering at a paper cup of coffee. Dean had been about to ask Cas what was going on when Crowley cut him off.
Only a few hours later, Dean dragged himself out of bed earlier than he would’ve liked, but he couldn’t bear drifting off again only to suffer another nightmare about injured birds. His brain wasn’t helping with his worry about Feathers. He grabbed his laptop on the way to the kitchen to make coffee and opened Discord while it brewed. There was still nothing from Feathers. He sipped at his coffee, willing Feathers to appear and apologize for scaring the shit out of him. Maybe promising he’d never go radio silent like that again. But the force of his will was clearly not strong enough to summon Feathers on its own.
“Let’s get through this weekend’s chore list, and we can maybe worry about cruising with crocodiles next weekend. Deal?”
“Strategy?” Cas asked, his head tilting curiously before he slowly made his way to the opposite end of the sofa.
“Yeah, you might be right.” Sam shook off his reverie and grinned at Ed. He could make a spreadsheet of all the subtle shifts in Dean and Cas’s relationship over the last few months while he was trying to fall asleep later and see if he needed to shift any of those tally marks around. He was still sure that if their relationship had changed in such a fundamental way, there would’ve been more than just
Chief Riordan took a deep breath, and then slowly nodded. “Ayuh. After the first rush of confessions, things seemed to settle down for a week or so. The clerk’s office across the hall started to get busier for a while, with folks coming in to file for both marriage licenses and divorce decrees. It’s been a weird couple of weeks. But there hadn’t really been any crime to speak of, aside from the odd duck flagging down one of my officers to confess to jaywalking or the like.”
“So Wulf joined up with them at some point and began leading them to the Dark Side,” Dean said, nodding thoughtfully.
Cas nodded and yawned. “I don’t know what time it is, but the idea of getting up before sunrise sounds particularly terrible right now. This is everything I’d wanted last night but was too terrified to ask for. I don’t think I want it to end that soon.”
Cas took pity on him, his smile widening at whatever Dean’s face was doing. “Don’t worry, I can’t see them either,” he said, pointing to the book in Dean’s hands. “They say almost everyone should be able to, but it just gives me a headache to try. I think it’s good for the students to know that they’re not broken or deficient if they struggle with it themselves. I’m Castiel Novak, by the way. Librarian and sometimes unintentional provider of surprise heart palpitations. My apologies for sneaking up on you.”
The ride back to the cabin passed in less than five minutes of some of the most intense and uncomfortable silence Dean had spent in Cas’s company in years. It was nearly as awkward as that time Cas didn’t remember him. Maybe it was worse. Dean couldn’t pretend he was some stranger now, or chalk up Cas’s apparent discomfort to unfamiliarity.
Wulf closed the distance between them and gripped Louis in a tight hug. Unlike the other souls, Louis only seemed to grow stronger, more solid, in the embrace. They pulled back after a moment and looked into each other’s eyes.
Sure, some of the conversation they’d had over the last few days had veered toward the flirtatious end of the spectrum, but Dean had been able to handwave most of the things Cas had said to him as warmly welcoming and friendly. He also thought he’d kept his own comments in that lane, for the most part. But the way Cas had told him that librarians are rebels, in a low and rumbling tone meant only for his ears, and with a mischievous glint in his eye… Dean was left feeling just a bit too warm all over.
He regretted having to let go of Cas to shut the water off again, but Cas slid forward and did it for him. Instead of sliding back to his previous place, he crawled up Dean’s lap and straddled his thighs. “I think we’re clean enough now.”
“It means, whoa…” Sam braced himself under the weight of regret and disappointment that followed. “It means the emotional whiplash is unbearable. If I wasn’t so fucking tired I’d go wander out into the woods with a sleeping bag to get away from it. If this is how you’ve both been feeling for the last month, I do not blame either of you for being so pissed off at each other.” He took a few deep breaths and finally looked back up at Dean’s concerned face. “It means whatever conversation the two of you had last night wasn’t finished.”
Clearing Cas of any responsibility in Adler’s death is the easy part. It’s the rest of Gabriel’s plans that have him concerned. Dr. Morningstar has made a career out of manipulating everyone and everything around him for his own entertainment. He knows how to schmooze the people he needs to keep in his pocket, and he knows how to nudge his underlings into self-destructing. He’s elevated destroying people’s lives into an art form. Cas is still stuck on wondering what even drove the man into medicine in the first place. Healing seems like a strange career path for someone who thrives on Nick’s brand of chaos and maliciousness. Gabriel, however, has already moved on to strategy.
In many of these little vignettes, Chuck won and crushed the universe entirely. In others, Chuck was defeated but Dean died anyway. In others, Dean ended up back in Hell, or even in the Empty, tormented for an eternity beside Cas and never even knowing that the torment wasn’t just more of the same pain that Chuck had inflicted on him since birth, never really getting a win and never having an ounce of free will to fight back with. The worst of all, though, were the ones where Dean flat-out rejected Cas after his confession and just walked away without looking back.
Gabriel shrugs. “I haven’t kept in touch with her, but I know she’s moved out to some small town in Arizona and taken a job at a retirement home. Couldn’t hurt to ask. She uprooted her entire life to get away from the guy, so no guarantees, but she might be willing to put her story down on paper if there’s a chance it will help take him down.”
When Charlie didn’t answer right away, Dean finally looked up at her. She stared at him, open mouthed and blinking.
Cas gave him a relieved smile. “That was my hope. I was thinking over there,” he added, pointing toward a spot on the wall beside one of their bookshelves.
“When the Men of Letters locked half that stuff up, they had no idea how to break the curses, but the three of us could probably take care of all of them in a couple of days, easy.”
There wasn’t really anything else to do without Cas around, so Dean just kept writing as if Cas were there and he was just talking to him, telling him stories about his life. He poured himself out onto the pages, and after a few drinks and the demise one one of the cheap hospital pens the apartment had apparently come furnished with, he glanced over what he’d written wondering if it all wasn’t too personal to just stick to the fridge.
“I was thinking witch, or just some poor schmuck who ran across a box full of cursed objects, maybe,” Sam replied. “He wasn’t trading for souls. He took payment in cash.”
“Why not?” Cas asks. “Your art is all over this city. Probably all over the country. Perhaps even around the world. Walking around everywhere, on the gallery of humanity you’ve graced with your hands. What higher praise can an artist receive than people enjoying your work enough to make it a very literal part of themselves?”
Dean snorts at that and considers picking up another cupcake, but he still hasn’t had a proper dinner yet. He decides he doesn’t care and selects a chocolate cherry one because at least it’s got a visible piece of fruit on it and therefore qualifies as proper food. After a few moments of silence while Sam stands by the counter fidgeting with his sling, Dean finally looks up at him with a raised eyebrow, waiting to hear whatever it is Sam needs to say.
Dean sputters at the sudden change in topic. “Wha… why would we need... What makes him think Cas won’t be going home?”
“Dean,” Cas started, and then let it hang in the air for a moment. “I don’t know what changed, what made you think I would want to leave, but you have to know there’s nowhere else I’d rather be in this or any other universe.”
Dean stood there, leaning one hand on the counter as he guzzled his coffee. He’d need all his brain cells awake for this. Donuts wouldn’t hurt, either. And that’s when he remembered Charlie lived walking distance to his apartment, and to the best bakery in town.
“Will do, Dean.” She stopped typing and turned all her attention back on Dean to reassure him. “We’ll get this sorted and then we’ll get together to celebrate. You take care of yourself, and Cas.”
Cas raises an eyebrow at him, glances down at Dean’s shoulder now covered by his sleeve again, and shrugs. “I think after this afternoon’s revelations, I’d be a fool to turn down the offer.”
Cas gave him a grim, knowing nod as they finally made it outside into the early afternoon heat. “Medical school trains us under what might be medically suspect working conditions.”
“Where is your brother now, if he’s not in Kansas?” Cas asked hesitantly, as if expecting another cheerfully delivered tragedy and unsure how to deal with it if it was.
As he grudgingly took a seat, Dean noticed the laptop open on the table with the document he and Donna began compiling the night before open on the screen.
While he’d run the gamut of emotions by Cas’s side as he slowly assembled his wardrobe for his new life, Dean was now left with a dilemma. The longer the trip had taken, the more potential dinner options he’d crossed off his mental checklist. Lasagna, pot roast with all the trimmings, homemade chicken soup and a big crusty loaf of bread-- they were all delicious and comforting, but also labor intensive and time consuming. They still bought everything he'd need to make any of those options, but he loaded up their grocery bags with the understanding that all of it would have to wait. Dean was already worn out from their long day and wanted to eat before midnight, so with a dissatisfied grumble he turned on the oven and pulled out a couple of frozen pizzas. He stuck them in the oven and gave his fully stocked refrigerator a longing glance as he popped open a beer and kicked up his feet to wait. Not two minutes later he heard an unfamiliar shuffling sound coming down the hallway, and grinned around a gulp of beer knowing exactly what was headed his way. He stifled the grin and turned to the door just in time to see Cas carefully navigating down the steps into the kitchen in his new slippers.
“Yeah, because I don’t hit on everything that moves,” Cas interrupts, but Gabriel keeps talking over him.
While Dean toweled off, Cas shut off the water on his side of the wall. He didn’t hear the shower door open, as if Cas was just standing there like this was a normal way to carry on a conversation. His theory was confirmed when Cas spoke again.
Sam assumed Dean was trying to be cool and not let Cas know he was having this silent conversation with Sam. Meanwhile he could hear Cas holding an internal debate over whether he should attempt this exact sort of conversation without letting Dean in on it. Until Cas made his decision, Sam chose to focus as much as possible on Dean, since he’d already committed to it. He gave a very slight nod of his head, which seemed to satisfy Dean.
“A few of my friends in Baltimore,” Cas said, smiling as Dean glanced at him, pointing out the group photo Dean had been looking at. “Our last day off before we all started going our separate ways into our new lives. We went for lunch in Fell’s Point and walked all around the inner harbor.”
“What the actual fuck?” he muttered, and Dean just shook his head and laughed as he walked past their dazed visitor and jogged down the steps.
“Fancy meeting you here,” Dean said, as Cas turned on him with a start. “Looks like you and Jody had quite the adventure this afternoon.”
“You can shower out there. I’m gonna hope whatever this thing we’re hunting isn’t fucking slimy, and doesn’t get any of it’s goo on me,” Dean replied. “I don’t need to join the polar bear club this week.”
Dean nodded slowly. Yeah, he wouldn’t risk some kid stumbling across anything untoward in his browsing history, but if the school’s not saving records of employee internet activity, then he should be safe enough logging in for an hour or two. There weren’t even any kids in the building today, and most of the teachers were probably using every last minute to get their classrooms ready. Dean really didn’t expect any interruptions.
Dean wasn’t really sure what to do next, so he did the most foolish thing imaginable before his brain caught up to try and stop him. He pulled Cas into a messy hug and held on for just a few seconds before letting him go again. Cas had been so surprised he hadn’t even had a chance to return the hug before Dean was stepping back, giving him a disappointed smile, and heading toward his room. Over his shoulder, he called out, “Night, Cas.” He didn’t even look back long enough to see the stunned look on Cas’s face as he stood there and watched Dean go.
“It can be tempting to linger on the ghosts in our past,” Cas replied, focusing on laying out everything for the spell. “The only way to fully come to terms with the past is to face it directly and learn to let it go. Otherwise we’re blind to what could be in the present, and what matters most as we move into the future. As the only person present older than Wulf, I can confidently say that life improves vastly when living in the present and holding on to what you truly love.”
Cas’s eyebrows were scrunched together as he finally mulled over what that actually meant. “They didn’t even consult with any of us before implementing these changes. If they believed there were legitimate accusations to be made against any of us, they would’ve been required to address them with us personally before taking action. There’s a protocol they have to follow in circumstances like this. It’s in our contracts.”
“That was the point,” Sam said glumly. “They’ve been through all that shit, and still haven’t figured each other out yet. I’ve been living with them for a decade and a half, and I’m about at my wits’ end.”
. Well that was bullshit, right there, and Dean was gonna make sure Cas knew it, with all the necessary words instead of ambiguous knots of emotions. Technically he was right, if having it would’ve triggered that dumb deal, but that was the only thing standing in their way, other than Dean’s complete failure to ever actually talk to Cas about any of this when he’d had the chance. Even if it was too late now for any of it to change anything, Cas still deserved to know.
Cas nodded sagely, as if that made any sense at all, and then turned to walk toward his room. “I’m sure the sleep deprivation, constant stress, long hours running around, inconsistent meals and caffeine addiction will help immensely, yes.”
Sam nods approvingly, while Cas looks confused. “You don’t need to do that, Dean. I’m sure Pamela will bring me back after the meeting. I know you have your shop to run.”
The new teacher grinned at Dean and stuck her hand out for him to shake. “Donna Hanscum, fifth grade.” Dean shook her hand and listened to her talk right over any introduction he was able to make. “You must be Dean. It’s a lot easier on us classroom teachers to get a handle on our own groups of kids. I don’t envy you guys that have to remember every kid in the whole dang school.”
Dean took a deep breath and held off actually drinking just yet, and stared at the opening credits of the next episode on television as if he hadn’t already watched the little montage more than a dozen times that day and he’d be quizzed on it at the end of the show. They both watched the first few minutes, long enough to hear what the contestants would be baking. Between the mild distraction of the show and the whiskey slowly working its way into his veins, Dean finally wrapped his head around what Cas had said in the kitchen. When he spoke, without even turning to look at Cas, it was barely louder than the television.
Dean let out a bitter little laugh. “Welcome to my life.” He sipped his coffee and watched a couple of ducks swim by on the canal while they sat there in silence for a few minutes.
“And here we are again,” Dean said, clearing his throat. Both of their lives had changed that night, and they’d spent so much of their time fighting against everything in the universe since then. The one constant had always been each other, even when they’d totally fucked it all up and broken the natural order and sacrificed themselves to fix it all again, they’d done it to save each other. At the end of the road, and the beginning of their journey, Dean couldn’t keep his feelings bottled up any longer. “I love you, you know.”
“What the fuck, is even the wildlife around here going mental?” Dean asked, and then slowly let his foot off the brake and coasted back to the parking spot behind their cabin in case there were any more kamikaze woodland creatures lying in wait by the edge of the road.
He wasn’t about to be happy about it, either. Hence all his grumpiness with Cas and his complaint sessions with Sam. No matter how hard he prodded for information on what he and Cas talked about while Dean had been holed up in his room, though, Sam wouldn’t break. If Cas was talking to Sam about his budding romantic feelings, he’d either sworn Sam to secrecy or Sam had decided to take a vow of silence out of spite for Dean’s increasingly irritable behavior.
: Just don’t make them fuck in the school library. I have to work there, and that’s something I don’t think I could unsee
Dean carefully considered his options, while also savoring what might be his one and only opportunity to wake up like this. It’s not like he had a way to escape the bed without waking Cas up, between being effectively pinned beneath Cas and practically fenced in by the bed frame at his head and feet, the wall at his back, and Cas blocking his only escape route. Even if he could slip out of his grasp without waking him, he’d still have to climb over Cas to get out of bed. There was no practical solution to this dilemma other than to feign sleep until Cas woke up. Nobody said he had to feign sleep with his eyes closed, so with no one to witness him, he watched over Cas as he slept.
We both turn our eyes to the Human who just holds her necklace's crucifix pendant tighter in her hand, like she's about to faint. Sister Abigail is a true saint with a pure soul. She will never give in to a demon's temptation. But just to be safe...
I know his soul is still inside him, and I can sense that his body is still functioning, although damaged. It's weak, but there definitely is a heartbeat.
I suddenly miss our quiet complicity and long for those peaceful times when my brother would come to spend time with me and we would watch the crawling fish on the ground. It seems so far away now...
Dean may not believe in anything, but he's important to the Lord, otherwise He wouldn't have sent us to rescue him. He is essential, indispensable, and destined to save Humanity. He's probably the most worthy person in the world to be saved. And yet...
"Why did you have Rzionr Nrzfm transferred to the Garrison? Your report described him as an excellent soldier."
This time, when we go back to Earth, I'll ask him to stay, to not return to Heaven. What I didn't dare to ask after the Apocalypse. But now, I know what I want. I want to go hunting with my lil' bro and Cas, I want us three to take the road in the Impala with good music playing full blast, I want to make the angel smile for real, to make him see a whole bunch of movies so he'll finally get my jokes, and...
"God acknowledges your pain and appreciates your sacrifice, Abel." Gabriel grazes the young Human with the tip of a finger. Abel nods with a smile halfway between sad and happy.
I can feel my wings tensing behind my back, but I do my best to keep my gaze steady and not to react. Oh yes, I have. I have questioned an order before. Several times, even though I've never expressed it out loud. It's a shameful, slithering secret hidden deep inside of me. A secret that I will never be able to reveal, even less now that I have responsibilities, soldiers at my command.
If any Angel of my rank dared to question the decisions of God and the Archangels like this, he would be immediately sent to rehabilitation or executed on the spot. I can't help but tighten my wings behind my back uneasily. I cannot give an Archangel a call to order, nor agree with his discourse.
My voice is hoarse, rising in the silent night. I peer around, searching for her figure and trying to sense her aura. I get no reply. She's nowhere to be seen and yet, I know Anna can hear me.
My wings are shuddering behind my back, and I quickly pull myself together. My old memories and my past attachment to my sister and superior should not interfere with my mission. I must eliminate her without hesitation, as ordered.
I signal for Miz to open the pathway. He holds out one hand and delivers a powerful wave of energy to shred the invisible veil that was hiding the gateway we have been searching for so long. We rush straight into the opening, weapon in hand and driven by a sense of duty and mission.
The rising water levels reached the top of the highest mountains where a few hundreds of animals and perceptive Humans had escaped to safety. We stood idly by, listening to their cries of distress and watching them tear themselves apart to climb on floating tree trunks. And finally, as the last of them stayed afloat, looking up to the sky with pleading eyes and whispered prayers, we pushed them one by one into the deep water until they drowned.
"Not to me. I felt your creation in my Grace." Her smile is somewhere between fondness and teasing. "You're my little brother and nothing will ever change that. Not even your title or rank."
"There are more Humans out there and we don’t want to live ignorant like animals anymore," Adam says with defiance in his eyes.
And I know now for sure that the war I'm fighting is already lost. If it is written that the Cage shall be opened and the Apocalypse shall descend again upon the Earth, that is how it will be. I understand now why the hierarchy never backed me in my mission. Why my soldiers are dying. Why I am losing.
"It is midnight. Get in formation, soldiers! Follow me! The orders are to kill all first-born babies, humans and animals alike, who are not in a house marked with lamb's blood," Anna shouts in a strong but dispassionate tone.
One last glance at Jimmy who keeps talking to the microwave, and I lay my hand on my brother's shoulder, who effortlessly drags us through the time flow.
The ground is made of marble tiles and there are golden columns rising up into the light as far as I can see.
Uriel is right, of course. I really don’t want to have to watch this city fall into ashes, and it's holding me back.
I look up to the sky when I hear the voice resonating through my skull and I unfurl my wings. But Siosp, my brother in charge of supervising me today, remains still as if he didn’t hear the call. He has been acting apathetic all day. I glance at him and nudge his arm to urge him to get ready to fly too. He finally tears his eyes off the silent city and shakes his head in dejection.
"Well, you're a regular Chatty Cathy. Tell me something. Sam would have wanted in on this, why not bring him back?"
"While it may be understood by those listening to it now, it will only take two or three generations for the message to be distorted or lost. That's the way Humans are."
"You have been created to be part of the Garrison. Our Father commands you to observe the new form of life and to be ready to obey His orders."
My voice is raspy and full of emotion, I clear my throat and moisten my lips. Unlike Sam, I'm not good to express all this sentiment crap. I don't even know what I meant to say, but I end up silent, staring at Cas. I notice Benny's moved a few more meters away. He's turned his back and is whistling, weapon on his shoulder, on the watch. Deep inside, I'm grateful for my vamp' buddy to give us a semblance of privacy – even if I know that he can hear every breath we take.
I have given orders to kill as a priority the demons on the sidelines chanting their evil spells. Uriel is enjoying himself, blasting away and burning to ashes hundreds of demons with each one of his mighty blows.
Orders are orders. There is no need to think, no hesitation to have. I am Heaven’s weapon, a warrior of God. I do the Lord’s will without questioning it, for this is the purpose I was created for. Without breaking eye contact with the General, I step on the boat, pushing it deep into the dark water with such strength it raises giant waves all around.
"You heard me. Everybody made such a big deal about you bringing Dean Winchester back to life, as though that was some kind of exploit, when I brought a bunch of Winchesters back to life all by myself and somehow no one ever mentions this. Just last year, I brought Sam Winchester back and no one cared, but when you bring Dean back, boom, that's the highlight of the millennium! I find this a bit offensive to say the least. Besides, Sam is the prettier one. I particularly like his hair."
All Angels have been ordered by God to bow to Adam and Eve and to love Humans above everything else. Lucifer refuses to do so, and is cast away as punishment. A Cherub named Azazel reveals the truth to Adam and Eve about their birth, resulting in them doubting God and being chased out of the Garden of Eden.
Nodding, I take a step closer to look him straight in the eye, studying every detail of his green irises.
The wind is blowing hard, flapping my coat behind me, gusting under my shirt. My tie flutters and sways briefly and then is tossed over my shoulder. There are dark clouds surrounding us and engulfing me momentarily, hiding the sight of the city from my eyes.
The tension in my brother's shoulders loosens up. There is something weird about his attitude. For a split second I could swear I saw a flash of
"I know. And I would never disobey orders. But… there are times when… I understand why Lucifer rebelled."
"Balthazar. She's trying to get a look at my face. Is there anything we can do to counter an invocation?"
"Leviathans were the only creatures able to kill us, and they have been locked away, Levanael. Our number won’t get any lower."
"Castiel. Why did you wait so long to give the alarm? Why did you send your brothers straight into a trap? And why did you destroy a city with your true form? The death and mutilation of these Humans had not been written by the Sisters of Fate. Explain yourself."
I spread my wings to propel myself high into the sky until I fly through the layer of clouds shading the Earth. An ocean of white cotton blossoms as far as the eye can see, wrapping the curve of the planet in a serene silence. The sun shines on my feathers as I slice through the air in the direction of the East. Miz might have spotted some of Eve's creatures. Or maybe demons.
With a snap of fingers, he sets the book on fire until all that remains is a pile of ashes. Then he looks up at me with a smug grin.
Since the last events occurred, I went back to watch over the other Humans who have moved on and forgotten all about Adam and Eve’s very existence. I made sure of it. I have been informed that their parents looking for them everywhere was an inconvenience.
My head is thrown back 'cause he's towering me, sitting on my lap and his hands slipping in my hair. My right hand grips his shoulder like an anchor to reality. I breathe heavily with my nose while Cas is nibbling on my lower lip and sucking on it with an obscene wet noise. Oh
"What? Of course not! You're hurting my feelings. No, I'm talking about the girl: Claire! I worked hard on this bloodline, you know, to build you a vessel perfectly fitted for your Grace. And she is your true vessel, not Jimmy. Because, you see, I've always thought of you more as a woman, for some reason. You'd make a cute little sister. This Apocalypse is happening just a couple years too soon, she's still a bit young. But anyway, Jimmy will have to do in the meanwhile, and once this whole mess is over, assuming Humanity hasn't been wiped out, then you can try her on. You'll see, it will be something else: power, efficiency, speed, and so on. Besides, I guarantee you that once she's grown up, she'll be a hottie."
After getting out of bed and going to the bathroom, I wash my face and teeth while staring in the mirror. Despite the good night sleep my face still looks weary. Even if the last months had been easier on me, it still wasn’t a life that would make me happy with lots of alphas
“Would you like to accompany me tomorrow after work to buy some clothes and other utilities you might need?” Cas breaks my sightseeing with his unsure voice. I look to him, but he seems like he found some very interesting spot on the wall that he needs to focus on. He looks just like someone asking for a prom date–
“I don’t care,” I spit out in disgust. “I only need a few words to get him to show his true jerk face.” And they always show it whenever they’re provoked. Especially by a
I also hear careful footsteps making their way downstairs and approaching me – probably Cas’s – but since I want to avoid the risk of puking again, I continue keeping my head rested on folded hands on the table, while I hear the bowl being taken away and the footsteps leaving and returning once again. “Good morning, Dean. I brought you some water.” I hear Cas slowly muttering from above.
? Some of my strength is failing once I start registering those words and they use this opportunity to drag me to a very small closet, probably used to store cleaning utensils.
“What are you all staring around for? Do you want to be next on my list?” At her words, everyone is dispersing quickly, leaving only me and her in the middle of street.
. I’m trying to panickily push open the door, but the assholes seem to be holding it closed, since they probably don’t have the keys to actually lock it. The worst part is that there's so little place to move and so suffocating, that I actually feel like in a
“Owner? I think you are the rude one, Karen.” Cas.Is.Amazing. I laugh out loud now, turning some heads in my direction. I’ll probably be a known figure soon, if I keep meeting so many weirdos who want to fight me.
I wake up in the same position I fell asleep into, but feel the most refreshed I’ve felt in a long time. I slept like a log, not even using the blanket from under me to cover myself.
Before getting attacked by one of them, I suddenly hear other voices and see the same uniforms that saved me a few years ago. Some police officers are making their way towards us, catching the assholes that were trying to run away.
Cas suddenly slams his fists on the table, making havoc on the remaining documents. “Enough is enough, Dick!” Now he
He answers without breathing, like this is something as normal as the sun raising on the sky, while taking my breath as well. “I would have come back for you, Dean.
. I completely forgot about that. Though, I still find it very weird. “Cas, what’s even the point of me signing it? Not like my signature would have any effects if you were to honor that contract or not.” An omega signature will always have the same effect as a random smudge on paper, no reason for him to go to these lengths.
Though I don't plan to focus on other ships here, it'd nice as background or other fic part of this series :)
.” Before thinking that this guy has no salvation, some recognizance seems to appear in his eyes. “I thought I was the only one looking at yours.”
I try to keep a smile during Garth’s story, though I realize that this is the last time I’ll ever hear him talking to me like this. The moment he sees my face dropping though, he asks for a paper and pen.
? Is this guy fucking with me? Did he really forget the planet that he’s living on? That in front of him is someone who’s been treated like the lowest of trash most of his life? How the hell could he say that?
I wake up feeling strangely refreshed. Even though I had quite a rough date with my wonderful pies yesterday, it seems like all that puking and medicine had a pretty good effect on my body (probably that quick wank helped release some tension as well, even if I feel a
. Are we both a bunch of masochists, who like to beat ourselves for the same things? So, I take a big breath and say something that I never imagined I’ll ever say to an alpha. I seem to do this a lot ever since I met Cas. “You know, I’m actually enjoying a lot these days spent with you, Cas. You’re a cooler guy than you give yourself credit for.”
That moment when his attention is distracted, I manage to open my handcuffs and stab the nail into his neck. Even if he’s an
This seems to completely wake him up, since he swiftly releases me and looks guilty at the side. “I’m very sorry, Dean. You kept cuddling me last night and this was the only alternative I could help you with. I’m not very good with this kind of thing.” He quickly says in one breath, like he wanted to get it over with. Unfortunately for him, I’m the last person on earth he should consider having a hearty conversation the first thing in the morning. So, I just ignore him and go to the bathroom in my room, where I have all my stuff. I should just move them all in his bathroom if I keep doing this whole sleeping in his room thing. It’s such a hassle to walk so many steps in the morning. I wanna go to sleep until I die and then sleep some more. The mornings are too troublesome.
“Bad morning, Cas.” I finally respond, cringing at my horse voice. Did I scream until I almost broke my vocal cords, or what the hell?
Cas takes a few moments to answer though, since he’s probably just as shocked as me. “Please tell me what is happening, or leave
Yet Cas is now worryingly standing in front of me, definitely not finding his own words amusing. “Dean, I do not understand what is happening. Oh, right, maybe Gabriel would know–”
“Do you have anything else to say to me, or did you only come here to fuck with me, until I get to finally punch you?” I spit out.
