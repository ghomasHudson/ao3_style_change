His knees buckled, but Castiel caught him just in time. He lifted him into the air, spinning him around so they were facing the same way again. He laid him down beside him.
He was a sweaty mess by the time he was done and barely felt like eating, much less making, dinner. Still, he washed up and started on the granola. He hadn’t posted a recipe or video since Monday, and his followers wouldn’t care that he’d been working like a dog all week. All they’d see was the lack of content.
“Oh, it’s okay. I only finished cooking about 10 minutes ago.” They passed the bathroom’s ajar door, where Jack was using the sink. “Would you like to join us for dinner? You can eat later if you’re not hungry yet.”
After a while, Dean had started hanging out in Castiel’s room pretty much daily. Castiel’s roommate was an international student who seemed to spend literally all his time either in class or at the library, and that suited Dean just fine. It meant that he and Castiel had the room to themselves. It felt like the two of them had a little world that was all their own, where Dean could say whatever he wanted and not be judged or made fun of. Castiel always made him feel like he was the smartest and funniest and most interesting person on the planet, and no one had ever treated him that way.
The house was cold; if the almanac had been correct, the previous night had been the last spring frost. Dean stopped in the hallway to turn the heat on. The thermostat was next to Sam’s bedroom, and Dean could hear him snoring softly through the door. He grinned and continued down the stairs to the kitchen.
Castiel scoffed, kissed him again. The song next door faded out, and Castiel didn’t mind. He loved Dean, and he had all the time in the world to say it.
When they emerged into the kitchen, Castiel was chopping a bell pepper at the island. A zucchini, an onion, a bulb of garlic, and a box of mushrooms were waiting their turn. Soft jazz music was playing from the house’s sound system, somewhere up in the exposed rafters.
Dean sliced one of the limes into thin slices, then juiced the other two. He poured tequila and mineral water over a tall pitcher of ice and limes while Castiel told him about his day. Though he didn’t say so directly, Dean got the sense that he’d spent more time brooding over his imagined transgression than actually getting work done on his dissertation. Maybe it was naïve, but Dean hoped, as they touched glasses, that a quick return to normality between them would ease Castiel into being prepared to hear what he had to say.
*The time varies based on the size of the potatoes, so you should try to boil potatoes of roughly similar size here. Also, if your potatoes are on the smaller side, you’ll want to start checking them for doneness earlier than 30 minutes.
She let out a sharp, derisive peal of laughter. Dean glanced around, mindful of the looks he’d gotten when he walked in. Something wasn’t right in this village, and he needed to keep his wits about him.
“It’s okay. You know, a lot of what goes into good cooking is confidence. Try not to be intimidated by the food or afraid of messing up. It’ll sense your fear.”
“The—the location is perfect,” Castiel stammered. “A picturesque hillside just outside of town with woods and a stream. People would love coming here to pick fresh, organic fruit and experience nature. At the same time, they could see the 1815 Federal-style home of Bunker Hill, which will be historically listed by that point. Hopefully.”
Dean ignored him. He turned to the window and watched the leafy edges of the traffic circle slip by. It was a cloudless, humid day; the air was wet and fecund. He’d be returning to the farm tonight. Back to the real world.
“Must be all those herbs I just picked,” Dean said, pulling Jack into a brief hug. “Hey, Jack. Welcome. Nice to see you again.”
Bake at 375 degrees for forty minutes. Remove the enchiladas from the oven and let rest for at least five minutes before serving. Sprinkle with chopped cilantro just before digging in. I serve mine with white jasmine rice and black beans; I find that the blandness of the rice and earthiness of the beans balances the cheesy spice of the enchiladas well. In terms of toppings, sliced jalapenos, sour cream, fresh red salsa, sliced avocado, and more chopped cilantro all have a place at my table.
"Oh. Um, what'd you do after that?" Dean tipped the wine bottle over Castiel's glass. "And sorry if this feels like a job interview all of a sudden."
Dean looked down at their hands and gave a gentle laugh. He rubbed his thumb back and forth over Castiel’s ring finger.
Dean shuffled up the stairs gratefully. He brushed his teeth and changed into the pajamas he’d left on the vanity earlier. When he turned off the bathroom light, he vacillated between heading in the direction of his office or his bed before settling on the latter. He figured that, if Sam were sending him a finished video, he could just as easily post that with his phone.
Dean reached for his box of tissues and started cleaning up. Okay, jacking off to his roommate was pretty gay. There wasn’t really a way around that one. But that didn’t mean he’d ever actually act on…whatever had just happened. Probably plenty of guys had a fantasy about another dude once or twice in their lives. And that’s all they were. Fantasies.
After a few more sips, Dean topped himself up and returned to the warm spot on the couch. He’d tended to his blog. It’d be negligent to not check his Instagram.
The creature turned to look at him. For the first time, the line of its mouth moved, curving down with what looked like confusion. Or displeasure.
“Yeah. Oh, by the way. Sam might try to sneak all sorts of vegetables into your food when you’re not looking. Keep an eye on him.”
Divide the batter evenly among the muffin liners and bake for 20-25 minutes, until the tops are slightly puffy and golden and a toothpick inserted into the center of one of the interior muffins comes out clean. I usually start testing at around 18 minutes to be safe, but my oven is on the strong side.
“Hello?” Castiel said, once he reached the gate. He shone the flashlight on the ground, looking for tracks.
Castiel nodded, and Dean grasped both his shoulders, digging his nails in. With a single loud grunt, he sank down most of the way, stopping an inch from the bottom.
“No, of course not,” Castiel said dismissively. “I was merely curious. This all just feels so…new. Being human.”
“Oh my god,” Kelly said slowly. She picked out and marveled at each of the bag’s items. “This is lovely.”
Dean seemed to absorb that. His fingers kneaded Castiel’s hips; his thumbs hooked into Castiel’s belt loops. Finally, he leaned in close to whisper.
“No, it was awesome. You were awesome. It was…different, but not in a bad way.” Dean sighed. “I think I just psyched myself out about it, you know? I’m not sure whether I was more excited or scared. But it wasn’t as bad as I’d thought it’d be.”
After a few seconds of suspense, the least surprising chords imaginable started playing from the car’s speakers.
Castiel waved his hand over the console. A fine mist sprinkled from the ceiling, cleansing all the surfaces. Dean’s bladder felt voided, his urethra cleaned out again.
He and Jack exchanged a strange look, but the moment only lasted for a second. Castiel stepped towards the door.
“Dean’s brother went to Stanford,” Castiel said. “He lives in DC. Maybe we could ask him about it when you visit.”
Dean felt Castiel’s hand at his waist. He breathed in the steam from the hot water and closed his eyes.
Castiel breathed. He finished his wine as he held Dean tight against him with his other arm. He kissed Dean’s hair and kept going.
“I just feel weird. You know, being in a truck cab with the owner, rather than thrusting a protest sign in his face. I kind of feel like a turncoat.”
The next week, Castiel was visiting Jack in Camden, so Dean focused most of his free time on developing new recipes. The YouTube channel was coming up to 800,000 subscribers, and he thought he had just the recipe to celebrate the occasion and the season.
“Everything’s okay at work?” she said, after a few seconds. “It’s not more stress than you anticipated?”
“It’s—it’s fine. You can get dressed in my room. Take as long as you need. I’m heading out, anyway.”
“Auckland won’t start to feel like summer until the end of October at the earliest. The South Island, even later.”
Castiel shook his head, joining Dean’s laughter. His wounds still smarted, but Dean felt like all the hurt between him and Castiel since that first week of sophomore year had suddenly dissolved. In its place, Dean felt a calmness in his heart that he’d never had room for before. He hoped Castiel felt that way too, now that he knew the truth.
"This was your idea, Cass?" Dean turned to him at the threshold of the dining room. "You never said that. Thank you."
“Ignore the jealousy in the peanut gallery, dear viewer. 10k! This one’s for all you lovely people out there.”
“‘You can read me anything.’” Dean leaned back into the hollow of Castiel’s neck. “You pretty much read me the book of love that first time we kissed.”
Another moment passed, and the taut control Castiel held over his muscles yielded to Dean like a leaf collapsing under the weight of too much rain. He gathered a fistful of Dean’s shirt with one hand and pawed at the crown of his head with the other. His mouth trembled, then finally broke away.
“Oh, I was just remembering that I told Hannah I’d go to her and Jonathan’s Halloween party. She invited me a while ago, way before I met you.”
“No,” Dean mumbled. He bashed a clove of garlic with brutal force. “I don’t care if you’re into dudes, Sam. I mean, you’ve been to the Celine Dion Vegas show multiple times. I’m not sure how surprised you expect me to be.”
Dean sat back and exhaled. He raised his wine glass to his lips. A minute of tense silence passed before Sam changed the subject.
“Uh-huh.” Dean edged the mug of tea towards him. “Well, hearing more about those sounds way more exciting than an afternoon of spreadsheets.”
Said driver, a guy in his mid-thirties with messy chestnut-brown hair and expensive-looking aviators perched on his nose, managed to exit without scratching Dean’s most prized possession. He thumped the door shut behind him and peered around the parking lot with his hands on his hips. Definitely an out-of-towner, if the Swarthmore T-shirt and flashy ride hadn’t made it obvious enough.
“Maybe I’ll take this off too.” Dean pulled his T-shirt up and over his head. “It was pretty warm today. Still kind of muggy.”
No, Castiel’s first time had to be with someone who really cared about him. Someone who really knew him and valued him and…loved him, maybe. He wasn’t like Dean, who hadn’t hesitated to toss away his innocence at the first opportunity like yesterday’s garbage. He was complex and sensitive and special.
Dean grinned, and Castiel couldn’t help but grin back. The sight of his housemate’s inhumanly dense, pointy teeth reminded him of the precautions he’d thought up on the drive home to protect his identity.
“I know it looks like a lot of ingredients when they’re all laid out like this, but none of what we’re about to do is hard. It’s a meal that’s simple, satisfying, and not too time-consuming. I think you guys will like this one.”
“I’m happy to help.” Castiel turned to the garden. “Is this the next thing you’re going to show me?”
The next day, he slept in, made whole wheat and yogurt pancakes with fresh strawberries, and spent the entire morning watching
Dean shook his head, blushing again. Simple gratitude was enough to fluster him, and for some reason that ignited Castiel’s protective urge—another hallmark of his draconic nature—like nothing else so far. All he wanted in that moment was to call Dean back to bed, curl up with him, and pet his hair while bathing him in kisses and compliments.
For the first time in a while, a genuine smile lit up Castiel’s face. He looked up at the balloons dotting the ceiling.
“Um…Michael thought you were his perfect vessel. But he was wrong. You’re mine, and I’m going to fill you up in ways he never imagined.”
The choreography of the protest was different this time, with the crowd gathering at a park a few blocks to the northeast of Lafayette Square before moving down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. As Dean had expected, the clear, breezy weather and the June date yielded a turnout at least four times the size of the previous protest. Castiel used the same
“You should see what he looks like.” Dean forced out a laugh, but the pang in his ribs made him immediately regret it.
They had enough time after lunch for a walk through the National Portrait Gallery; Castiel said that they’d have to get to all the museums eventually. Dean was able to identify each of the flowers in the background of
“Don’t be silly. You’ve saved me from having to spend Christmas in a motel room. I have to thank you somehow.”
“Uh.” Dean fidgeted in his seat. “Sure. I mean, as long as I don’t need to cook for Sam. But he stays over at Kevin’s a lot in the summer. Not a
Castiel brushed Dean’s hands away and finished the job, squatting down to reach the last couple buttons. Dean raised his eyebrows at the sight of Castiel kneeling between his legs, though he managed to not make a joke about it. He didn’t seem like he was in the mood for humor.
They left for Hannah’s house about half an hour past sundown. The party was from six to midnight, though Castiel noted to Dean that they didn’t have to stay that long by any means.
“We say it ironically. It’s 1500 people or so. A couple schools, a general store, art galleries, a few restaurants, a bar. The population doubles in the summer. At least.”
“No kitchen should be that clean,” Dean said in consternation. “I feel like I’m looking at one of those model setups at the home and garden store.”
Dean leaned the container of wolf urine against the fencepost and started typing. Of course Sam couldn’t wait much more than a day before sticking his nose in. Dean was surprised that he’d lasted as long as he had.
Dean’s breath stalled. He sat forward on the couch cushion. Crowley glared at him and jumped off his lap.
“I’m not making fun of you, sweetie. I’m just pointing out—I’ve had so many friends who thought they could fix a guy’s issues if they just gave him enough love. Thought they could change him. You know how many of them succeeded?”
“Well, I just use it to pick up chicks, but some people actually take it seriously.” Dean played with the smoke-tentacle that had wrapped itself around his fingers. “So, that’s what Aquarius looks like? I’ll have to remember.”
“Oh, Dean.” Castiel reached across the table, finding a narrow path through the candles. He rested his hand over Dean’s. “I don’t deserve you.”
“Cheesy corn muffins with green chiles and cilantro.” Dean scribbled on his notepad. “I think I need to lower the moisture a little.”
“Couldn’t have done it without you.” Dean pecked Castiel’s cheek before reluctantly turning to Sam. “Without either of you.”
Dean nodded to Charlie and ignored Meg. Castiel’s eyes were still downcast, and Dean hated that so much that he nearly stayed.
When he got to the kitchen, he was disappointed to find that the granola hadn’t been touched. Castiel apparently wasn’t joking about waking up late. Dean assembled his prosciutto on rye, poured a glass of orange juice, and went out to the deck to eat. He was nearly done with his sandwich when the French door opened hesitantly and Castiel peeked out, squinting and holding his hand up to the light.
“And wonderful. And beautiful.” Castiel brought his arms around Dean’s shoulders. “You’re the closest to heaven that I’ll ever be, is what I mean to say.”
"Not far enough away from my family. It's always a drama with them. I had other reasons to stay close to home, but...who knows. It's not like I can go back and change things now, in any case."
“Wake up, sleepyhead.” Castiel sat on the couch next to Dean’s waist and smiled back at him. “I made you something.”
Later, as he and Castiel watched Jack drive home from the bottom of the driveway, Dean took stock of where they were with one day left before the journey home.
“One of our servers is stuck at the doctor’s office and Dick couldn’t find anyone else on short notice. I did used to do this job not too long ago, you know.”
Already, though, he felt reinvigorated by the clean mountain air, the peace and quiet, the views of nature all around. Coming up here for the summer had definitely been the right idea, regardless of Jack’s protests. At least he’d mostly stopped sulking by now.
Upon reaching the second floor, he pivoted on the balls of his feet in the direction of his bathroom as he always did. He stopped in his tracks when he heard faint music floating down the hallway from Castiel’s room.
“I—” Dean fluttered his lips. “It’s kind of silly. I always wanted to cook for people. Have my own restaurant, maybe a little lodge in the country. Somewhere people could meet, relax, have a good time. I imagined having lots of people around me, morning till late at night, friends and strangers. I don’t know, maybe it’s because it was only the three of us when I was growing up. Me, Sam, and Dad, moving from place to place. Or, once we got here, working on the farm all the time.”
“Yeah, she’s excited to see this place. I must talk about it a lot. I’ll bring her along for the Fourth, if that’s okay.”
Dean rolled over one of the sausages with his pair of tongs, showing Castiel the browning underside. He looked at Castiel.
“Dean, I—” Castiel squeezed the base of his cock, holding it up as Dean dragged his balls over the tip. “I don’t think I’ll last very long.”
The shadows were long in the fields when Dean called an end to the day. He covered the bales of pine straw with tarp and carried the weeds from the strawberry rows to the brush heap, then drove back through the gate and up the road home. He fiddled with the radio dial as he drove, blithely tapping past songs he liked just for the sake of discharging some of his nervous energy.
“Alright.” Dean pumped Castiel’s cock, smearing the precome that oozed out over his palm. “I want to swallow it.”
“I wanted to thank you for listening. I don’t really like talking about home and…I just feel like I can talk to you about shit like that. And thanks for trying to make me feel better. The hugging and…the other stuff. I appreciate that.”
He hunches over it like he’s never seen anything like it before. Dean pulls off his shoes, his damp socks, his too-thin coat, his sweater that he stole from a church donation bin. He sits in front of the radiator and shivers.
No, obviously, it did not. Castiel and Bobby featured in the episode, with Castiel especially playing a key “sidekick” role in buying Dean enough time to get through to Sam. Later, Castiel is important in setting out the state of the world post-climax—affirming God’s existence, resurrecting Bobby, debriefing Dean. Throughout the episode, Chuck narrates to the audience the point of
“Yeah, I was just about to leave.” Yuri beamed. “Can I test some of what I’ve got for next week while I have you here?”
Castiel tilted his head. “You know, you’re not entirely wrong. Anyway, he and Rowena are kind of free spirits. She does web and graphic design for New Age types—psychics, astrologers, occult bookshop owners. Makes a killing at it, apparently. No kids yet, which—” Castiel cringed. “That’ll be hell on wheels if it ever happens. Uh, that’s everyone. You okay? You’re looking a little pale.”
“You’re right. I love you, and they’ll just have to put up with it. Besides, you’re here on Father’s invitation. They won’t be rude in front of him.”
“I’m not sure.” Castiel sighs. “I can’t return to Heaven. I’ve perpetrated more violence against angelkind than any other being in history, with the possible exception of Lucifer.”
He sighed and opened his eyes, giving up on sleep. He stretched his neck to peer at his beehives, which he’d arranged around himself on the tower’s roof like the seats of a round table. There were fewer and fewer bees each day, but he didn’t know why. He speculated that it had something to do with them not liking the location, but they were too delicate for him to move to a new one. Humans would have to do it, and none of those came to visit him any longer.
“Uh, sure. Then we have our spices. One and a half teaspoons vanilla extract, one teaspoon ground cardamom, a half teaspoon of ground ginger. Last but not least—” Dean lifted the blueberry ramekin with one hand, the cream-white platter of roses and violets with the other. “Our berries and edible flowers. This is a small, sweet heirloom blueberry that my family’s been planting for the last eighty years. And here, we’ve got some pink Virginia roses and some Appalachian violets.”
Cain was still working with the hives when Dean returned to the house for lunch, but he assured Dean that he had everything well in hand. Dean said he’d leave a couple boxes of eggs for him in a cooler by the front door.
“It’s a museum in Boston,” Castiel said, to Dean’s quizzical look. “I told him about all of Henry’s antiques. And about the house itself, of course.”
****See the breadcrumbs recipe from the blog entry for Cauliflower Gratin and Farro Pilaf with Blistered Asparagus. Alternatively, use Panko. It’s fine. 😉
“Dean, you should know that I’m not a ‘suave’ human being. I got teased a lot for being a ‘nerd’ and a ‘dork’ when I was younger.” He was using air quotes, and Dean opened his eyes in time to see most of them. “I’m what some people consider ‘socially awkward.’”
“Not Baby, that’s taken. Sweetheart? Nah.” Dean waddled back and forth, his shins trapped in his pooled jeans, his boxer briefs snug and tented in front. “Lover? Sugar Pie?”
“We’re getting each other ready for the main event. The, uh, ‘exchange of gametes.’ Although, not sure about you, but I’m pretty much ready to go by this point.”
“No way. I’m just a home cook. I am partial to grilling, though. If I didn’t have Cass living with me, I’d probably grill twice as much as I do.”
Dean looked up from the wooden bins of potatoes and gave a glare across the row of root vegetables. Sam was pressing his palm to the crown of his head in a gesture of mock confusion.
“His publisher put the screws to him, so he’s trying to finish a manuscript by the end of the weekend,” Michael said, lifting his menu. “He apologizes, but you’ll see him tomorrow, surely.”
“You usually do,” Castiel noted. “I love our talks on the drives to and from DC. You’re very curious. Just like Dean.”
“I’m not sure, sire. I haven’t slept with many people. Er, I haven’t stayed the night with many women.” Dean swallowed. “Anyway, it’s not a bad thing. Did I make you feel self-conscious by bringing it up?”
**You can use extra-virgin olive oil for roasting the radishes, but you might have to lower the oven temperature to 375 degrees and let them cook longer. Depending on your oven and oil, EVOO can start smoking at around 400 degrees.
“No, we make a good team. Only thing is—” Dean nodded at the clock above the entrance to the floral department. “All these extra groceries mean I’m a little behind schedule. We should wrap this up so I don’t miss my next order.”
“No, no. We do have something for you, though.” Castiel handed her the bag in his hand. “It’s a loaf of orange huckleberry bread Dean made, along with some of his farm’s products.”
Dean dropped his arms to Castiel’s waist, holding him tight as he turned to the table. In that moment, he felt that he had everything he’d ever wanted, and that the rest of his life would only get better from there.
“Thank you,” Jack grumbled. “And aren’t you and Mom the ones always complaining about how superficial society is compared to when you were growing up?”
“No, she ended up reaching the very end of a poker tournament in Reno she plays every year, so she couldn’t make the flight. She won $20,000, so I doubt she’s too broken up over it.”
If you’re using your oven’s broiler, place the poblanos on a baking sheet and set it on the top rack (or the highest rack you can place it on without the peppers touching the broiler element). It will take somewhere around 5-8 minutes per side, though it really depends on the oven. The same guidelines apply for the broiler as for a flame—don’t walk away and do other things while they’re in the oven, and check them often. Once your poblanos’ skins are black all around, place them in a pot that’s large enough to hold all of them comfortably and cover for at least 10 minutes.
The dining room was filled with hooting and clapping now; it was lit with the frenetic dazzle of the camera flash in Jack’s hands. Dean hardly noticed. His entire world was Castiel. He nudged down, drawing Castiel into a gentle kiss that shivered with relief for both of them.
"No, those are the vegetable and flower beds. Most of the rows are edible flowers, but I only planted them a little over a week ago. Not much to look at, especially from up here." Dean pointed to their left. "See that gate over there? The road that goes through it takes you to the berry fields."
“Don’t worry, Dean. I’m not going anywhere.” Castiel tapped his foot into Dean’s again. “And yes, that’s a threat.”
Dean craned his neck for a kiss. They lay in silence for a while, the rise and fall of Castiel’s chest slowing little by little as the morning wore on, bright and lazy outside the bedroom windows.
There was a flap, a breeze, and then the air was muggy and languorously warm. It was early evening; the slim sliver of the moon hovered over the flat horizon. The sky was an upturned bowl filled with innumerable stars.
“Dean,” Castiel muttered, almost too overcome to get words out. Heat was gathering in the floor of his abdomen, but Dean didn’t seem to hear him. “Dean, I’m coming.”
Castiel shared his laugh, though he seemed embarrassed at the same time—turning his long, tanned neck to peer at the dimming forest, rubbing his forearm with his other hand. By this point, Dean had stuck his foot in his mouth so many times that Castiel’s body language when uncomfortable was becoming intimately familiar.
At the top of this set of stairs was the chamber immediately below the roof. It had proper windows, so all its contents were visible: glazed urns, piles of gold coins, dishes of jewelry, chests filled with offerings that Castiel had never bothered perusing. He’d only ever wanted food, but it’d taken the villagers a while to realize that.
Jack sighed. He threw Castiel a look that seemed pretty damn knowing for a 14-year-old kid and half-stomped down his hallway, quietly enough that he could get away with it without Castiel admonishing him.
Dean placed the potatoes in his cart and looked up again. Sam was holding a banana in one hand and a plantain in the other, comparing them. When he saw Dean approaching, he presented them to him and grinned.
“I’ll give you one of mine later. Get your head in the game, Cass. We’re supposed to be putting on a show.”
“I’ll try to restrain myself, then.” He started down one of the rows of crops, and Dean followed him. “Are these all things for the farm? I guess they must be.”
Dean blinked. A gaggle of festivalgoers had gathered at the curb, and Charlie and Kevin were both counting out cash. Dean banished the memories with a roll of his neck and bent down to the crates of jam.
“We’re a lot more laid-back now. We used to do this whole—this whole pranking thing. He’d put superglue on my chair; I’d stick itching powder in his boxers. Dad thought it was hilarious.”
“Then call him up and tell him. Don’t know why you decided to make me need brain bleach first thing in the morning.” Bobby reached for the doorknob. “Just—make sure you’re off the sauce by the time I get back, okay? I told John I’d look after you.”
“No, of course I can.” Dean blinked and pushed away from the pickup counter. “I better go. Only got half an hour.”
Dean had been mulling over expanding the strawberry fields for a while now. The obstacle to that was labor. There were never enough workers for strawberries—they ripened early in the year, when kids were still in school, and it was hard for most farmworkers to find childcare. Not only that, but no one really liked picking strawberries. They grew low to the ground, which meant a lot of squatting and bending down in the dust, all of which took a toll on the body.
“Don’t know,” Castiel said. “It’s some sort of surprise. But he said it’s scenic. And that maybe we could get something to eat in Burlington after.”
“Because I knew you’d try to stop me, Dean. And because I thought it’d be fun to surprise you. Now you’ll see me every day when you come in for lunch!”
“Careful,” Castiel said, as Dean pushed himself up by his forearms. A second tentacle, about the width of a shotgun barrel and at least six feet long, rose up from Castiel’s side and curved around Dean’s waist to support his lower back. The tentacle that had been at his wrist made its way to his left shoulder, resting there. Almost like it was trying to comfort him.
“Spear closet. One at each corner. That one has the modem in it, so it’s good you brought it up. If the internet goes down while I’m out on the farm, you can restart it there.”
“You don’t say?” Rafe had joined the bar now, dropping his plate to the zebrawood with a sharp clatter. “So, what was it about the unattached son of Maine’s second-richest man that sparked your sudden conversion?”
“This brings back memories. Happier times.” He gave Sam an indulgent nod. “I have four brothers. This is what it was like most of the time growing up.”
“What are we toasting to?” Castiel said, once Dean had snapped a picture of two drinks and two hands.
“I’ll probably end up puking it all up,” Dean says, to break the ice. Castiel hasn’t really talked since they sat down; he just stares at him. It’s strange and it should probably freak Dean out. He isn’t freaked out, which probably should freak him out even more.
“You looking forward to finally meeting Castiel? You going to let him, I don’t know, cream your coffee?”
Dean grunted and nodded. Maybe Castiel was flattering himself, but he thought Dean’s grunts were more enthusiastic than usual at the mention of them holding hands.
Dean made a face and followed Castiel through the doorway. The kitchen was the same width as the one at Bunker Hill, but about double the length and with better, more comprehensive lighting. He really needed to replace those track lights.
Dean grinned back, patted Sam’s shoulder. In the sunrise over the parking lot, Sam could see a light in his brother’s eyes that had never been there before, not even when they were children. For once in his life, he looked free.
Castiel strode to the screen door. Dean gave him a pleading look, but Castiel just gestured back to Yuri.
Once they got to level ground, emerging from the shade of the larches into the sweltering daylight, things seemed to shift. Dean’s gait relaxed, and he even shot a hopeful smile now and again up at the saddle. Castiel finally returned one.
Castiel tilted his head. “Was that deep? My brothers would’ve told me to stop talking nonsense and eat my cereal.”
Dean checked his phone once he was sitting in the Impala again. Nothing from Castiel. He thought about texting him but decided against it. Castiel was probably hard at work on his dissertation; he wouldn’t appreciate Dean’s constant interruptions.
Castiel puts down his empty cup and plays with the sugar packets in the center of the table. He doesn’t ask the logical question.
“It’s not—okay, it’s for cleaning the telescope. But I thought Cass might like it.” Dean rubbed his neck sheepishly as he turned to Castiel. “You’re always saying we don’t take proper care of Henry’s ‘beautiful instrument.’”
“Yeah, it’s a Dominique hen. All our chickens are. The rest are probably resting in the coop somewhere.”
“They’re in the back,” Castiel said, as they walked down the brown brick pathway to Luke’s front door. “We can go around the side deck.”
“How do you want to do this, Dean?” Castiel looked up once he reached Dean’s boots. “Should we go to your room? I can fly us there.”
“No, I’ll tell the truth. He always knows when I’m lying, anyway.” Jack downed the pathetic drizzle of champagne that was left in his flute.
Castiel stands in the corner, staring at the opposite wall, as Eileen and Sam and finally Dean wash up. Dean lays a cautious hand on Castiel’s waist as he passes him to get to his duffel bag. Castiel doesn’t lean into it, but he doesn’t pull away.
At that, the muscles in Dean’s shoulders relaxed. He flipped onto his back and beamed up at Castiel in the strip of moonlight between them.
“Message received.” Dean gestured out at the lake. “Incredible view you’ve got here. I’ve always loved how the lake looks from the eastern shore.”
“If you won’t let go of that, can you at least let go of your plate? I want to start the dishwasher before we go out again.”
“Hang on.” Dean plants his feet in the middle of the parking lot. “Are you doing this because—what do you want?”
To Dean’s surprise, they managed to get on the road just before 5:30 the next morning. Castiel was unexpectedly spry while they loaded up the Impala’s back seat with the cooler, basket of parchment-wrapped orange and huckleberry loaves, and box of produce for the ratatouille. By the time they were on the interstate, however, he’d already crashed, his breaths whistling softly against the car window. Dean sipped his thermos and drove, enjoying the tranquility of the world at dawn.
“Plus, it’s cooler in the truck.” Castiel grabbed the front of his blue floral shirt and fanned himself.
. The Kinsey Scale. Basically, he was one of the first people to study sexuality scientifically, objectively, rather than with the goal of ‘fixing’ nonheterosexual people. And he was bi.”
“Cass, don’t be an idiot. You’re not going to lose me because of this, alright? I won’t treat you any different.”
“So I did.” A tentacle caressed Dean’s arm, and Castiel waved his right hand in a languid arc above their heads. The ceiling’s lights faded, gradual and inexorable, into the cold black of space.
“Obviously, he didn’t eat them, since they lived to tell the tale.” Ellen refilled Dean’s bowl with stew. “He asked for them to bring him any food they could spare. He promised to bless the village if they did as he said.”
At sundown, when the water on the marina was the color of raspberry sorbet, everyone packed up their cars and returned to Little Providence for gifts, drinks, and cake. Because they had to walk back to the school road to retrieve the Impala, Dean thought he and Castiel would be the last to depart. When they passed the PIHOP parking lot, however, Jack was still there, leaning against the side of his car and staring at his phone. Dean pulled up and rolled down his window.
Dean unlocked Baby, slid behind the wheel, and shut the door. He gripped the wheel and breathed, feeling heat in his chest and neck that burned like cheap whiskey. After a few seconds, he saw Castiel slip back into the house. He stared at the front door for a while before finally turning the ignition.
“I’m happy you pay more than the minimum wage, at least. Virginia’s one of the states without a higher minimum than the federal one. It’s a travesty. No one can live on that, especially not a family.”
In the morning, the fog hung in thick tendrils from the red oaks that lined either side of the driveway, obscuring the lawn and fence and even the road itself. Dean sipped coffee from his thermos and screwed the lid back on. He brought the Impala into drive and rolled forward, taking it slow.
Minutes went by as Dean leaned against the kitchen island, still and straining as a levee. Eventually, the scent of burning potatoes shook him from his frozen indignation.
“No, Dean. I’m not so naïve as to think that any of us would be able to eat without the labor of immigrants. I just—”
“You smell good,” Dean said. He palmed Castiel’s midsection and rubbed his thumb along the centerline of his abs.  “You always smell good.”
“You know, for when you’re interested in someone.” Castiel cleared his throat and lowered his voice, as if being eavesdropped on were a risk in his empty backyard. “When you want to, you know, sleep with them.”
They listened to AC/DC on the drive up to Burlington, Charlie’s request for “something less dudebro” notwithstanding. The back seat erupted with fits of whispering and sniggering every so often, to the point that Castiel started peering at Meg and Charlie in the rear-view mirror. For his part, Dean studiously pretended to hear none of it.
“It’s for a chef’s supply store, have you heard of it?” Sam looked from Dean to Castiel, then back again. “I asked a friend of mine from Stanford who’s a chef at one of the hotels in Vegas. He said it’s the best place. $500 should get you something pretty nice, I hope.”
? And why had Castiel found him living alone in the swamp, then, seemingly fearful of leaving Bunker Cemetery?
“If you want to,” Castiel said. “Like I told you the other day, I’m a good listener. And I’d like to think I’m open-minded. I don’t make hasty value judgments about other people’s lives and circumstances. It’s kind of in the anthropologist job description.”
Castiel put down the wine bottle and took his seat across from Dean. “Just imagine them in their underwear.”
Castiel looked up from his laptop. “Hey, back me up on this. Didn’t that pudding look like the bisexual flag?”
“Yeah, well, I think we’ll do better this year.” Dean lay the first slices of French toast in the pan; the butter sizzled. “I’m trying some edible flowers in the backyard beds.”
“So, do you still want to go to the Halloween party tomorrow? It’s eighties-themed, by the way. You might hear more of that classic rock you like.”
“How’s German Club, how’s the Bicycle Touring Society, how’s that…lunch meeting where everyone yells at each other—”
“Let’s get started, then. Guys, this is an awesome recipe for the dreary time of year we’re stuck in right now. It’s cheesy, spicy, salty, sweet, tart, crunchy—plus, you won’t believe how easy it is. Who needs the boxed stuff?”
“The walruses.” He sniffed again, then let out a long, labored breath. “Nowhere to go. We have to help them, Dean.”
Castiel just smiles again before returning his head to Dean’s shoulder. Dean reaches up to roll down the window, get a breeze in to cool things down. Maybe flush the stench of sex out of here before the four of them have to drive back to the bunker together first thing in the morning.
“They’re the outermost flight feathers on the wings of a bird.” Castiel painted thin stripes through the air with his index finger, tracing an invisible pair of wings.
“You know, no one’s ever given me flowers.” Dean looked down at the little nubs of the daylilies. “It’s the other way around with straight people.”
Somewhere around Leesburg, there was a line on the radio about angels in the architecture, and Dean found himself thinking about the stone fountain in Castiel’s front garden. That teenage feeling of every mundane and random thing in the world leading back to a single bright point in his mind’s eye—he knew what it was, and he didn’t care. He wanted to ride with it through the night until he ran out of road or gas, whichever came first.
“Yeah,” Dean laughed. He yanked Castiel in, closing his knees around his narrow hips when he bumped against the table. “Yeah, it’s a flirtation. You interested?”
“Oh, I see what you mean.” Castiel looked away. “The dragon had a preference for speaking literally. I’ve only had him to talk to for so many years. I’d nearly forgotten what it’s like to talk to other humans.”
“Sorry, buddy.” Dean threw back the duvet and stood up. “Cass isn’t some random girl who’s DTF. He’s my roommate and best friend and that means more than you getting wet for one night. So, we’re letting him take the lead.”
“Hey, just because Michael’s inside him, that doesn’t mean they’re an item. I know that better than anyone.”
“Glad you think so.” Dean glanced at the tripod. “You can also just use your hands to crush the tomatoes. If you don’t feel like doing it this way.”
Castiel took a deep breath. Maybe this thing with Dean didn’t need to be going anywhere. Maybe they could just enjoy each other’s company right now and figure out the rest later. That sounded…very nice, actually.
“Dean,” Castiel said. “I’ve figured it out. I know what I’m going to do to help people in Winchester.”
Dean explained more of the history and preparation of the dish before moving on to the grilling. The grill—one of the small number of additions John had made to Bunker Hill—was large enough to fit all the vegetables at once, though Dean emphasized the different cook times of corn, bell peppers, and tomatoes.
Dean and Castiel spent the next day on Mount Desert Island, leaving in time to lunch in Bar Harbor. Dean got to try his first lobster roll there, with Castiel commenting that it was good that at least one of them got to enjoy them.
“No—it’s okay, Cass. That’s not what it was.” Dean put down the lemons. “You’re right, it is the farm. I’m just nervous. The start of the picking season…it’s a stressful time.”
“You’d probably find it desolate. To the human eye, it’d simply look like a lot of empty space with a few dead rocks floating around. But there are millions of us there, slipping in and out of this dimension at any given moment. Dancing past one another as we locate the door we need, then pass through it.”
“Of course they do, handsome. It’s in the name. There are other languages, but.” Castiel looked up from his laptop. “Remember how I said that my dad wants to try your cooking on one of the nights we’re there?”
Dean froze. Castiel had told her? Of course he’d told her. They’d probably been texting all day while his back was turned. He’d caught Castiel once, at least.
“Yeah. Then I worked in my office until 7. Made really poor progress. I think I actually had a negative word count because of editing? Oh, and someone microwaved fish in the department kitchen, which of course went on to permeate every square inch of the building for the rest of the day. So, yeah. And now I’m home.”
“Yes, he likes to explore new places. Kind of like me when I was younger.” There was the far-off cadence of Jack’s voice, and Castiel glanced to the side. “Do a cold wash with the detergent in the translucent bottle, then dry them on low. Do you need—okay.” Castiel turned back to his phone. “Sorry. He got some new clothes today and wants to wear them tomorrow.”
Castiel held out his hand, and Dean gave him his duffel bag. Castiel walked it to the luggage rack in front of the closet and set it down carefully, smoothing out its sagging edges before turning back to Dean and smiling. Dean felt a little embarrassed by the whole production; it was just a smelly old duffel bag, after all. He returned Castiel’s smile anyway.
“16, huh?” He grazes the backs of his knuckles along Dean’s cheek, down his jugular. “You don’t look 16.”
Before Dean could say anything back, Castiel dove beneath the waves, the muscles of his back glinting in the moonlight for a split-second as he slipped away.
Sam spun the linguine around his fork and speared a radish with the tines. His eyes widened as he chewed.
“Look, you’re not going anywhere, alright? I’ll talk to Sammy once he cools down. No one should spend Christmas alone.”
On the first point, I have to assume that most people are too seduced by the syntactical parallelism of the thought as presented to dig into its logical structure. The basic question to pose here is: why? Why, if
Hannah petted one of Castiel’s wings. “I remember the first year you wore this. You and Ethan. How long’s it been since you guys split up? Don’t you think it’s time to move on?”
“So, get this,” Charlie said, once they were settled in with their coffees. The first hour was always slow, so they typically spent it chatting.
Dean shoved the bag of cornmeal into Sam’s arms. If his little brother was going to follow him around, he might as well put him to work. Following a quick check of his notepad, Dean walked to the spices to gather up the things he needed for the glazed root vegetables, and Sam trailed close behind.
“Anyway,” Dean said abruptly. “A lot of you ask me for more recipes using berries. We’re right at the start of blueberry season here on the farm, so I figured I’d feature a recipe with them to celebrate.”
“Well, we’re almost to the weekend, folks. Hope you’ve got some nice R&R planned. With midterms coming up, you’ve got to take the time to kick back when you can.”
Castiel shrugged. He seemed to be losing some of the conviction he’d started this conversation off with, and Dean didn’t like that at all.
A lone streetlamp marked the bridge access road, where a ruby-red row of brake lights greeted their arrival. A work crew had sectioned off part of the lane with orange cones.
“I was younger than her. Like you and Castiel. Well, she was six years older than me, so a little more. Most people in those days thought six years was a lot when the woman was the older one. Maybe they still do.” Chuck smiled wistfully. “It didn’t help that I was shorter, too. Honestly, I don’t know what she saw in me.”
Dean groaned back into the futon and stared at the first article printout. Fuck, even the title looked boring.
He hurried across the street, still laughing; the hand was already flashing red. When he saw that Dean wasn’t following, he stopped in the middle of the crosswalk to beckon to him.
“Right.” Dean teetered in place, trying to squeeze his hole shut. “Just so you know, I don’t think we’ll be having sex when you’re in that form. This was plenty big enough for me.”
Castiel tilted his head, glancing down between Dean’s thighs. Castiel’s come was still dribbling out of his hole, and Dean burned with an odd mix of arousal and humiliation.
“I doubt anyone’s adolescent years covered them in glory. Besides, that’s not who you really are. You were performing. Trying to be someone you weren’t. That messes people up. Take it from someone who knows.”
Dean plugged his phone into the charger on his nightstand, pulled back the covers on his bed, and climbed in. Once he’d settled into the sheets, he reached for his phone again and looked at the picture below Castiel’s tweet. Castiel was seated, hips open and the soles of his feet pressed together, below what looked like a cherry tree. The sea-green grass around him was strewn with blossoms the color of thinly spun cotton candy, a few of which had fallen into his unruly mess of hair. He was smoldering, head angled slightly to the left, at the camera—that imperious, intensely aware smolder that made him look a little crazy. Crazy and irresistible.
Castiel reached for Dean’s waist, and Dean shuffled back to join Castiel’s side. They surveyed the sweep of Jack’s life, from the crayoned blobs in one corner of the room to the Camden panorama in the other. Castiel lay his head on Dean’s shoulder.
He truly was a failure as a knight. Every man, woman, and child in the Northern Kingdoms would curse his name through the ages. Dean Winchester, the blackguard who’d found the missing heir to the throne and led him to his death in the same day. Perhaps if he leapt from the tower now, no one would ever know. He was already a traitor, so it would only be fitting for him to take the coward’s way out.
Castiel flipped open the first aid kit and let out a long, loud sigh. His abs tensed in consternation.
“Yeah, she used to get up and stretch at random times like this. She’s a yoga instructor, so maybe it comes with the territory. You and her, I mean.”
When he reached the last of the shutters, Castiel paused, his shoulders stiff, and gazed out into the night. Even without sitting up to check, Dean knew that he was looking across the island. At the other end of the house’s V; at the solitary yellow light at the top of the tower.
“Your growing berry empire,” Castiel said, without turning away from the passage he was revising on his laptop.
Castiel didn’t bother hiding his grin. He slid left to cradle the side of Dean’s face, staring into his black eye again. Dean swallowed.
Castiel shrugged off his blazer and hung it on the hatstand. He’d have to take it to the dry cleaner in town to see if it was salvageable. The dress shirt and slacks were lighter colors, though, and probably lost. A shame, since they’d fit quite well for being off the rack.
“Just head back, right now. And get a taxi if you can. I don’t want you crammed in on the metro with all those people.”
“I like this spot, Dean.” He stroked the window column and gazed in the other direction, where the state route led north to the border with West Virginia.
“They’re what I write all my poetry on. I’ve…written a lot this past week, gone through several, so I figured I should stock up on a few. Nothing worse than running out right in the middle of a poem.”
Strawberries were one of the main money crops for the farm, along with blueberries. Heirloom organic strawberries fetched a hefty price at the farmer’s markets and at local restaurants, and strawberry jam was by far the most popular jam or jelly they sold. As he established the netting over acre after acre, he recited to himself his hope for a good strawberry season like an incantation.
“Yes! I think I’ll stop there first, then the grocery store, then Biggerson’s for your burger and fries and pie.”
“No thanks.” Garth pointed to some brown sludge in a big plastic bottle. “I’ve got my protein shake.”
“Um.” Castiel tilted his head as they clinked glasses. “How many guesses do I have? I doubt I’ll need three.”
“Um….” Castiel chewed another bite. “Did you sleep well? Your eyes were still closed when I left for work. I tried to be as quiet as possible while I was getting ready. I didn’t want to wake you.”
“Please give him a chance.” Castiel tossed the last cold item—a bag of frozen green beans—into the freezer, then slid it shut. “You’ll enjoy your time here a lot more here if you make some friends.”
Castiel smiled. It was a good attempt, but Dean was familiar enough with him by now to know there was some unease there.
“Yes. Normally, that’s for when students have a major illness, a child, a death in the family, things like that. But because this is so sudden and I’m at a late stage in my dissertation, the university is giving me the option.”
“You are.” Dean knocked the side of his foot into Castiel’s bare ankle. “One of those people, I mean. Not presumptuous.”
“Or drawing. I remember you coming home crying in fourth grade because of one mean comment by a substitute teacher. What if you’d let that stop you from doing something you love?”
“Actually.” Castiel handed him more words. “Perhaps I’m thinking about this the wrong way around. It’s Halloween on Friday. People will be in all sorts of costumes. Maybe…this sounds crazy, but maybe we can go out without disguising you very much at all. We could hide you in plain sight.”
“Oh, no. I had my parents, I had our nanny. She was Castiel’s nanny, actually. I like to joke with her that she got a few months off between Cass and his son.”
“He knew you’d react that way. That’s why he insinuated you aren’t straight. You shouldn’t have let it get to you.”
“It won’t take long.” Castiel held his arm out when Dean tried to take his seat. “No, just…stay there.”
“A dragon killed both my parents.” Dean wrapped his arms around his bare chest. “My mother when I was just a boy; my father sixteen years later, once he’d finally managed to track it down for some measure of vengeance.”
“Okay.” Dean drooped his head. “You should probably stop, then. I’ll be too blissed out to drive if you don’t.”
“I just figured you’re new in town,” Dean said hastily. “I hadn’t seen you guys around here before.”
“Really? Alright, practice on me. Pretend I’m your target audience. The adoring forty-something working mom who has a thing for wholesome, corn-fed Midwestern boys.”
“Dad, you’re amazing.” Suddenly, Jack was hugging him from behind, and Castiel leaned back into him from where he was kneeled in front of the freezer.
“It’s his ‘outdoors uniform.’” Dean snorted. “We’re going to pick huckleberries on the other side of the valley.”
“No, cooking sounds perfect, Dean. It’s been too long since we did that.” Castiel smiled. “I have a nice bottle of wine to go with dinner, too.”
Castiel doesn’t respond. He unwinds from Dean; his wings shimmer into the ether. He flips onto his back.
“Yeah.” Dean stuck out his tongue. “Wasn’t going to say anything, but I think I see a few lines forming on your forehead.”
“Charlie. You talked to Charlie.” Castiel took in a sharp breath when Dean’s fingers reached his balls. “The last couple hours make much more sense now. She didn’t seem nearly as interested in Zoroastrianism as she purported to be.”
He lay his hand over the curve of Dean’s cock, almost as if he were petting it, and Dean instantly blew out a long, sharp breath. He smiled when Castiel glanced at him.
“Maybe we could find another way of communicating.” Castiel sat up a little, and the creature watched every movement. “It’s not all about speech. Psychologists say that over 70% of communication is nonverbal. For example, you offered me a drink of water and you’re taking care of my ankle. Even though we can’t have a conversation, you communicated to me that I can trust you.”
“No. No, not at all.” Castiel spun the stem of his wine glass back and forth between his fingers. “I, uh, I think about you naked quite often.”
“You called me your mate,” Dean said, once Castiel seemed to have finished his preparations. “What does that mean? Like, we can’t….” Dean gave a single nod to the hectocotylus. “Can we?”
They continued with the recipe; Castiel was better behaved for the rest of it, bar a quip about the “thick and creamy” soy yogurt that caused Jack to hang his head in shame. Dean topped the three stacks of pancakes with big spoonfuls of thawed black cap raspberries and sprinkled them with lemon zest.
“How’d you manage all these months, anyway?” Dean capped the canteen and restrung it to the horse’s side. “The villagers claim there’s been no water in the valley for months. I suppose Blue-Eyes must have been providing you with food and drink somehow, though.”
Then again, it wasn’t like there were any other options. He’d have to apologize eventually. The thing he still had to figure out was whether he and Castiel could just go back to the way they’d been once amends were made. Dean wasn’t sure he could do that right away. He’d gotten swept up in the euphoria of falling for a new person and placed too much faith in him too quickly; now he felt burned. He wasn’t sure whether it was his pride or his trust that smarted. He supposed that was what he had to decide before they had a conversation.
“Then—” Dean waggled his bare ass on the table. “You going to flip me over and fuck me, or do I have to do all the work here?”
The boutiques were a few blocks away, in the heart of the Old Port. They walked uphill along Exchange Street, which was less than a mile but seemed like ten with Castiel stopping at what felt like every shop that had men’s clothing in the windows. In one of them, Castiel found two patterned linen shirts and coordinate slacks in Jack’s size; in another, he dressed Dean up in a navy blue Aran cardigan.
“No, it—it meant a lot to me.” Dean fumbled for the tendril of smoke he’d been holding and brought it close. He had no idea why he’d ever let it go in the first place. “I just thought you were leaving.”
“I don’t believe we have any. We went on a hike on Tuesday and spent the day in Spokane yesterday, so I think we’re looking forward to relaxing at home.”
“Better?” Dean said. He drew in a long breath. Surrounded as they were by damp bedsheets hanging from the parallel lines, the air around them smelled of warm grass and the bright scent of liquid detergent.
When his attempt at humor failed to cut the tension, he tilted his head and searched Dean’s expression.
On the television, the camera panned over what to Dean looked like featureless brown blobs. The narrator remarked on the perils of climate change for the entire planet.
Dean rolled his eyes and flipped on Castiel’s bedroom light. He joined Castiel at the foot of the bed.
“We did it by doing it.” Dean clambered to his feet and put his hands on his hips. “I can’t believe my dumb plan to get out of angel Hell by having loud sex worked! Sam’s going to freak when I tell him.”
“We don’t have to talk about this,” Castiel said. “I only wanted to make sure you know that I’m still an option. Whether you take that option or not won’t change how I feel about you one iota. Okay?”
Dean looked down. He was too embarrassed to jab back against Castiel’s teasing. He felt guileless and heavy-tongued and moonstruck; he was seventeen again, wearing a scratchy button-down to his first date with Amanda Heckerling and balancing one of those overfilled movie theater popcorn buckets in one arm as she clung to the other. Even back then, though, he didn’t think he’d been this shy.
“Yeah. Thursday works for them. Funny thing, when we were at the market, Charlie brought up moving things around before I did. Apparently, she has a second date on Saturday.”
“I’m fine,” Dean lied. “I just wish you’d told me sooner. You think any of this would’ve changed how I feel about you?”
“No, like a burrito. Sort of. Here.” Dean nudged him, then brought his hands to the sides of the tortilla as Castiel withdrew his.
Dean cocked his head at the ceiling, the video all but forgotten. He had to have, right? Who could go without sex for an entire year? Dean shuddered. The very idea was unnatural.
Briefly, Dean balled his fists. It pissed him off when Castiel made decisions for the two of them without asking him. Sure, those worked out more often than not—they’d been through way worse than that clown show back there, after all—but that wasn’t the point.
He was right. The clouds were nearly all gone now, save for a few stray wisps that were barely visible in the warm glare. Dean pulled the sunglasses from his jacket pocket and pressed them to the bridge of his nose. Castiel laughed uproariously.
“I don’t know. Because of you, I felt emotions for the first time.” Castiel paused. “Does that sound like love to you?”
“Yes. She said you’ll have to switch to diet food if you haven’t shed those extra pounds before your next checkup.”
“I was going to say I could choke you if you keep trying to get me to screw up, but you’d probably turn that into something dirty too.”
Dean sighed. He had less than five minutes left, and he only felt more unsure with each passing second. He patted his phone, considered calling Sam. Maybe he’d have some advice on what to do about the farm. Asking him for help felt like admitting defeat, but Dean didn’t think he could go through this alone any longer.
Add the bean sprouts to the pan and mix well. You can do a quick heat-through on high heat while doing this if you have too much moisture, but not for more than a minute. You’ll overcook the bean sprouts and lose the crispiness if you cook them much longer.
“Holy shit.” Dean convulses on the seat, and Castiel steadies him with a hand on his waist. “Cass, that’s—”
“Even if they don’t, at least we don’t have to fear the dragon’s wrath any longer. Um, about that. I’ve gotten together six men and four carts for tomorrow. I think that should be enough to bring down all the hives in one trip.”
“After I finished that, I had to loosen up the mulch from last fall and apply fresh pine needles. Almost out of those, but there’re plenty of wood chips in the horse barn.”
“Spain has a lot of nice beach towns. I spent a few months there for my research, um…three years ago, now. And there’s Greece. I only went there for a weekend visit, but I’d love to go back. Oh, and you know I fell in love with Cuba.”
“Huh, I guess this guy’s someone. Lots of replies. ‘At Castiel: so this is what you do when you aren’t at a protest? Crying laugh emoji.’ ‘At Castiel: better make sure he supports Abolish ICE before you stan lmao.’”
home,” Castiel replies. From the way he says it, Dean’s pretty sure he isn't talking about Indianapolis, but he can’t puzzle out where else he might mean.
Dean nodded. He didn’t always feel lucky; sometimes he felt trapped. He hadn’t chosen the life he lived, though he wasn’t sure whether he’d choose differently, given the chance. Sometimes, that uncertainty was paralyzing.
A ripple of sympathy passed over the table. Castiel reached underneath the tablecloth to rest his hand on Dean’s thigh. Dean beamed at him.
“This was one of granddad’s favorite parts of the house, too. My dad said he’d stand here and smoke every morning after breakfast before he went down to the farm for the day. It’s the first part of the house that gets warm and bright when the sun comes up.”
He was back to the flirting, then. If he was still feeling any discomfort from the previous night, he wasn’t showing it. Dean actually felt his shoulders relax at that. He sat down on the deck chair nearest to Castiel’s yoga mat and pulled out his phone.
“Dean won’t stop talking about how he’s going to fire up the grill and finally put ‘real burgers’ on it.” Castiel poured more wine into Dean’s glass. “No one’s stopping him from cooking said burgers on any given night.”
“‘He sifts you to free you from your husks,’” Castiel said, ignoring him. “‘He grinds you to whiteness.’”
“Well.” Dean rubbed his thumb along the side of Castiel’s. “We’re holding hands right now. We’re two wills, meeting.”
In a small bowl, mix together flour, salt, and pepper. Pour the soy milk into a second bowl, and the breadcrumbs into a third bowl.
They worked out the details over dinner—pear, walnut, and goat cheese salad; baked macaroni and cheese with beet greens; and sweet and crispy sesame tofu. The courses didn’t go together very well, but Dean figured he’d pack them up in Tupperwares and let Sam figure it out over the course of the following week.
“Chuck,” he corrected, holding on to Dean’s hand. “You’re quite welcome here, Dean. That orange bread you made was delicious. And Castiel only has rhapsodic things to say about you.”
The room Dean awoke in was high-ceilinged, cool, and utterly silent. Along the walls, bands of periwinkle and magenta light pulsed in time with his breaths, while the same colors bloomed here and there on the ceiling like twinkling stars, drawing his eyes’ focus as they adjusted. The air smelled faintly of anise.
“I’ll start manifesting it.” Castiel wiggled a little in Dean’s arms. “Want to go inside? I kind of feel like warming up with some hot chocolate.”
“Oh my god. Cass, I used to watch that all the time growing up. Once Sam went to sleep and I had the TV in our motel room to myself? Yeah, that was Iron Chef time.”
“Hey, handsome.” Meg swirled her teabag. “See, that makes me feel better. My entire family’s pear-shaped. Even if I
“I knew, no matter what, that Jack would keep his promise to me. And when he didn’t, I knew something was wrong. Not with him, but with the universe. And it took us a while to figure out what it was and how to fix it, but I knew we had to find a way to save you. Do you know why?”
“Okay.” Dean glanced up at the ceiling; Castiel’s footsteps were making their way to the bathroom now. “Answer the question, then.”
“They only yell at each other sometimes. You just had the bad luck of coming to one where they did.”
“Well, I didn’t want to show up emptyhanded. It’s a strawberry rhubarb pie from my favorite bakery.”
“Yeah,” Castiel said. “It’s not that. I just like telling him horror stories about my family to freak him out. All true, of course.”
“This is from Rachel and me. It’s a brandy with notes of ‘berry potpourri.’ I…thought you might enjoy it.”
“How does that feel, Dean?” Castiel leans down for a kiss, licking and sucking at the side of Dean’s mouth that isn’t crammed full with a grace tentacle.
It didn’t take Castiel long to find a costume fedora at the Halloween pop-up shop in town that afternoon. At a shoe store in the same strip mall, he picked up a pair of soft, flexible moccasins in size 13. He’d had Dean try on several pairs of his own shoes last night, to no avail. Dean’s feet were very wide, which made sense for someone whose body was designed for ease of swimming.
“Okay, okay.” Dean took a deep breath. “Charlie, uh, I wanted to talk to you about this because you’re my best friend besides Cass, and…well, because you’re gay.”
“Yeah,” Dean said. For a second before remembering their audience, he sounded awed. “I mean, yeah, angel! I want to touch that little dangly thing in the back of your throat!”
“Hey, I said it’s fine. Besides, I sort of guessed when you said you’d been wanting to kiss me for a while.” Dean gave an upward nod, almost over his shoulder. “Back at The Barn.”
“He’s doing great, yeah. And his dad’s able to take care of him in the afternoons, so.” Lisa shrugged and smiled in the way she always did when she’d said everything she had to say on a topic.
“Hey!” He took out his phone and began snapping pictures. “These ducks are so colorful. Iridescent.”
“Wait. Does that mean—” Dean wet his lips. “That means you want…I mean, you and me? Like—like that?”
“Okay,” Dean said, once he was atop the ladder again. “First, you’re wrong about that. Dad ragged on me all the time if he caught me watching soap operas or cooking shows or anything like that. He’d let me know when he didn’t like the way I was walking, or when my voice wasn’t deep enough, or when I got too openly excited about things, because men aren’t supposed to get too excited about stuff, even stuff they really love.”
“I guess salamander men must kiss to express affection, just like humans do,” Castiel murmured. “Unless you’re preparing to eat me.”
“For the most part. If this becomes a regular thing, I’d appreciate if you could make Jack’s meals, help with small tasks around the house—laundry, light cleaning. But yes, I mostly want you here for companionship.” Castiel hesitated. “For Jack.”
“I was saying Cass should post that one with no context,” Sam finished for him. “Now that you’ve gone and blown the secret wide open.”
Something about the way he says it squeezes out any room for doubt or disagreement. And that’s when Benny realizes. He realizes that Castiel isn’t even planning to try hitching a ride. He’s just going along with all this because of Dean. Because it’s the only way Dean can keep going.
It was a one-pound jar for $15. Dean wouldn’t have spent that on himself, but…well, Sam was right. He was trying to impress Castiel.
Dean looked around uncomfortably. He supposed that it was good that Castiel had had some company other than the dragon, but to refer to insects with such affection…perhaps he’d spent more time exposed to the full moon than Dean had realized.
“Stop analyzing everything,” Dean groaned. “Can’t you switch your huge brain off for dinner at least?”
“I like waking up next to you. Now that the berry season’s almost over, you don’t have to get up as early, right?”
“Sophia and I used to do that,” Chuck said. “We’d have these contests where we’d compete to see who could come up with the most outlandish idea. Whoever won had the full support of the other in making it a reality.”
They’d stopped at the statue of Andrew Jackson, and Castiel turned to face him. He only took one step forward, but that was enough to send Dean’s heart thudding so rapidly that his blood roared louder than the ringing in his ears from the protest. He glanced at Castiel’s lips, licked his own, gulped down the burning-hot saliva in his mouth. When he looked up again, Castiel had narrowed his eyes at him.
“No,” Dean said hastily. “Actually, I was going to ask you to stay out of that side of the house until then. I’m kind of…preparing a surprise.”
Dean would wake him up and make him brush his teeth eventually, but he’d waited long enough to post his recipe. He’d read somewhere that consistent content was vital to gaining an online following. If nothing else, he could manage that.
“People come up here to see the first sunrise in the U.S. I did it with some friends freshman year. Cold, but pretty.”
“I don’t know,” Dean said pensively. “It’s nice, but the temperature will go down even further, and your collapse this morning has me worried still—”
“Oh, that’s right.” Naomi tipped back from the refrigerator doors. “Castiel’s father says you’re to cook for them while you’re here.”
“To be fair, part of it is metabolism. Everyone in my family is lithe and compact. Unfortunately, that means we also tend to be on the shorter side.” Castiel smiled. “Hello, Meg.”
Ellen was looking at him expectantly. She’d already gathered two jars of jam and a vacuum-sealed bag of dried strawberries at the edge of the table.
“Later.” Dean pumped Castiel’s cock a few times. “We can do all the romantic crap later. Right now, I want you to bend me over the map table and plow my ass.”
“It doesn’t feel as cold as last night.” Castiel strode to the window and looked out, facing away from Dean. “I’ll be fine.”
“Your son?” Dean said. His voice came out incredulous, even unnerved. He hadn’t intended for it to be.
After breakfast, the three of them returned to the mainland, Dean following Jack’s car until he turned for Kelly’s house. Castiel texted him five minutes later, once he was sure he was off the road, to remind him to fill Kelly in on his plans.
“Uh….” Dean put down his fork. “Hang on. You’re not thinking—I mean, that place costs over a hundred bucks per person, and that’s before even getting to wine.”
“I was, uh—” Dean rubbed his neck. “I was thinking we could do that yoga, like you said. Sam won’t be here for another half an hour, probably.”
Castiel brought his hand down on Dean’s ass with a thwack that reverberated against the war room’s brick and cement walls. Dean jerked forward, his bottom lip dragging past the Lesser Antilles.
“Business. Well, for the most part. Cass and I are meeting with an architect next week. We’re thinking about building a bed and breakfast on the property, down where the worker housing is now.”
“Uh, T-shirt.” Dean raised his hands to the ceiling. “Just pull it up from the bottom and over my head.”
“Adam loves hanging around Jack,” Castiel said sotto voce. “He’s like his idol. Been that way since they were little. Of course, that means I get stern emails from Michael whenever Adam uses swear words or broaches ‘mature topics.’ Somehow, it’s always Jack’s fault.”
Add the tofu and kimchi to the pot, then add enough hot water to just cover the surface of the ingredients. Stir gently and let simmer for one hour, stirring occasionally. Add additional hot water as the stew evaporates, just enough to keep the broth right at the level of the ingredients.
While the onion is sweating, add your vegetable stock to your other large pot and warm on medium low heat. (If the stock was in the refrigerator, you may want to bring it to temperature on medium for a few minutes before reducing the heat to medium low.)
Dean dumped the radishes over the noodles, then drizzled in lemon juice and extra-virgin olive oil. He divided the pan between their two plates and carried them to the table. Sam picked up the bottle and his glass and followed behind.
“I don’t even think I can vote in Maine anymore.” Castiel grinned at Dean. “Maybe when we build our vacation home up here. I’ll have to check.”
Castiel didn't seem convinced. Dean wasn't sure he was either. They raised their wine to their lips at the same time, and Castiel had just polished his off when the door opened again.
They doubled back through the produce section to get the items for Dean’s dinner on Saturday, then did the two-step through Garth’s terminal and the checkout line. Dean parted ways with him and Jack at Food Land’s front door, saying he’d show up around six. Castiel watched him bend across the pickup counter to receive his next order, grab an empty cart, push off into the store. He only tore his eyes away from the view of Dean’s rear when Jack elbowed him.
Once he was done drying off, he wrapped the towel around his waist and picked up his watch, phone, and keys. He walked through to the living room, but stopped in his tracks between the fireplace and coffee table when he saw Castiel sitting on the couch, petting Crowley.
Dean scowled. No, fuck that. He and Castiel hadn’t cuddled. They’d just hugged and chilled together on the futon. He always got a little sleepy after his third glass of wine, and it wasn’t like he was going to get up and crawl into bed midway through their conversation like a lightweight. That would’ve just been rude. Plus, he was really glad they were finally hanging out again.
“Yeah. I mean, I think so. He’s big into God and mythology and folklore and all of that.” There was the clinking of a belt, the smoothing-down of jeans. “I’m trying to get Dad to let him come visit this year, but who knows.”
Kelly. Jack’s mom, Dean guessed. They were probably divorced. Not too surprising; the relationship and lifestyle magazines in Food Land’s breakroom claimed that half of all marriages ended in divorce. Maybe Jack spent the school year with her and summers with Castiel. If it was hard for him, taking care of Jack on his own, they’d probably separated pretty recently.
They walked down the hallway, Dean drumming his fingers on the banister and Castiel pausing every few feet to comment on the cream and azure wallpaper, the old wig stand, the cutlass and flintlock pistol mounted in a narrow V. Dean opened the door and let Castiel walk through first.
“We did a good job,” Castiel said. He showed Dean one of the pictures he’d taken. “Now we just need some wreaths.”
“Dean,” Castiel said. He held out the sleeping bag he’d pulled down from the top shelf of the linen closet. “I thought of this while I was working. I have this sleeping bag for camping. I probably don’t seem like the most outdoorsy person to you, but I’ve camped a lot, actually, including as part of my fieldwork. It’s a water-resistant sleeping bag. I thought it might work for you to sleep in. You know, so you can sleep on the couch without…well, without it getting damp. And it’ll keep you warm. This house is old and drafty. I’m surprised you’re not cold now, you know, with—” Castiel looked down Dean’s body. “Anyway, I’ll just leave it here.”
“Well, you’ve got me to look out for you now.” Dean scraped the onions and garlic into a gently sizzling saucepan.
What he didn’t comprehend was Blue-Eyes’s initial benevolence. There were dragons that demanded worship and in turn protected their cult from the outside world; Dean had even fought and killed one high up in the Western Mountains. But all this dragon seemed interested in was eating honey and being left alone. He supposed he couldn’t even blame him too much for not granting the region rain. It wasn’t as if he were blighting the land, really—he was just permitting it to return to its natural state.
“Huh.” Dean sat back, took another sip of coffee. “He didn’t want to go home for the holidays? Wherever home is?”
He stepped back to let him in. Castiel was wearing a crisp white dress shirt with two buttons undone and slim-fitting navy blue slacks. A light grey blazer was draped over one of his arms, and he suspended a brown box adorned with a crimson ribbon from the other. He looked around the vestibule before turning to Dean.
“Okay,” Castiel said. “I left you some towels on the counter. The water heats up fast, so be careful. And remember to close the curtains on the window.”
“No, I don’t mean like that. I mean that…these were the only places where someone else was taking care of me. Where I wasn’t the one taking care of other people. Looking after Sam and—and Dad.”
“‘My lord, my lord.’” She rolled her eyes. “I think she’s making carrot soup in the kitchen. I’ll go fetch her.”
“Make sure you wear long sleeves and pants. And boots. We’ll be walking in the woods. Easy to lose your footing.”
Sam glared back Dean’s challenge. Castiel circled the table and peered over Dean’s shoulder at the tower of books.
Dean fumbled Castiel’s hand as he returned it to his lap. He hugged him tight, deciding to change the subject, and Castiel returned the embrace after a moment of apparent confusion.
“Don’t you want more? Sure you do.” Castiel flipped onto his front, turned his head on the pillow to kiss Dean’s lips. “Of course you do.”
He reached the outskirts of the village and immediately gathered that things were direr here than on the other side of the mountain. The ribs on the cows, not just the dogs, were visible, which meant that the common folk were falling behind on providing for one of their only forms of sustenance. He stopped in front of a burned-out cottage and grimaced at the two fresh graves in the sideyard. A girl of eight or nine with huge eyes stared at him from above the sill of one of the ruined windows.
“Crap. It is too weird, isn’t it?” Castiel rubbed his forehead; he could already feel the wine clouding his brain. “Forget I said that. It makes me sound creepy.”
A few people glanced at him warmly; at least one regarded him with suspicion. He was the only person here with neither a hood nor an umbrella. Combined with the novelty of the situation, he wasn’t sure if he’d ever felt more exposed.
They toiled in the fields until just past seven, by which time the wind in the valley had regained some of its bite and the sky above the hills was a dusky purple. In eleven hours of work, they’d mulched enough pine and cleared enough straw to feather every chicken coop in Frederick County. John Winchester would’ve been proud.
Castiel didn’t seem satisfied by that excuse. He looked over his shoulder at the trilling of the record player. Dean, feeling foolhardy, decided to press his luck.
“People who act one way in public, but who have this hidden other side. One they keep secret from everyone around them. Maybe it’s even a secret from themselves, on some level. Maybe they don’t even want to admit that that’s the kind of person they are.”
“Okay, this—we are not having this conversation.” Dean cleared his throat. “First Sam, now you? Why does everyone think I’m crushing on some dude all of a sudden?”
Add the beans and salt to the Dutch oven and mix well. Fill the Dutch oven with hot water up to the top of the vegetables—they should be wet, but not swimming. Bake for 90 minutes uncovered, until the top of the casserole is nicely browned and caramelized. Let cool for at least 15 minutes before serving.
“Okay,” the guy says, taking a step in that cuts off Dean’s escape. His body darkens the light from the sign. Instinctively, Dean reaches to his hip, but only finds soft fabric.
“Oh, thank you. Well, this is my room. Not much to see here, just a closet, a dresser, my bed, obviously….” Castiel frowned. “Dean, I’m sorry I don’t have a bed to offer you. This house technically has two bedrooms, but I turned the other one into my office. I hope the couch is okay.”
“Cass.” Dean’s stomach was in freefall; every hair on his body felt like it was standing on end. “What—”
“Uh. Well, he’s standing.” Sam unzipped the duffel bag. “Cass, we found a counterspell. But we need an angel feather, and you’re going to have to hold up a ceremonial vessel while I do the incantation. Can you—”
“Is it okay to say I’m excited?” Dean said, watching Castiel’s hand. “Does that sound weird to say in person?”
“I’ll just say this, Dean. My offer stands. Nothing’s changed. If you want my help, nothing would make me happier than to give it.”
Dean looked up at the towering pine trees. They seemed impossibly huge, and he swayed as he angled his head back, trying to see all the way to their tops.
“I’m just that good.” Dean filled Castiel’s glass with water and handed it to him. “How was, uh, working out your kinks?”
“You sure you guys will be alright?” Dean handed Charlie the keys to the delivery truck. “I know this is kind of short notice. I appreciate it.”
Dean didn’t bother contradicting him. He shimmied them back to the bed, stripping off Castiel’s tie and discarding it on the hardwood.
“Hey, it’s raining. I wouldn’t normally wear something like this.” Castiel adjusted his trench coat’s lapels. “Wait, do you really?”
Maybe that didn’t matter. The more important question, as Castiel liked to say, was why he cared so much.
“Wait, what?” Dean furrowed his brow. “You’re what, 30? 31? There were definitely games when you were his age.”
“More or less. I just thought it’d be rude for me to hide in my office for too long. I’m the host, after all.” Sam leaned over the bar. “Looking good.”
“A few factoids about Ursa Minor,” Castiel said, ignoring Dean’s protests. “It’s the site of a meteor shower every year around Christmas called the Ursids. Also, it’s the home of Polaris, the North Star.”
“It’s not metabolism, Charlie.” Dean scooted his chair closer to Castiel’s, just a little bit. “He runs or bikes every day.”
Dean joined Castiel’s side and reached for the bags. Together, the two of them were able to lift them all, and Castiel shut the trunk with a satisfying thud.
Dean laughed, wrapped Castiel in an embrace as they watched the clouds float by. After their descent, they went swimming in a lake on the western side of the island. Castiel was only lukewarm about that, but Dean insisted. Otherwise, they’d have packed their swimsuits for nothing.
Slice the tofu into the desired size. I like flipping it onto its side and slicing it into two wide, thin sections, then laying it flat again and cutting it into eight equal pieces, yielding sixteen pieces total. Breading is a pretty tedious kitchen task, so I prefer larger pieces.
“Very sure.” Jack pushed himself up. “I’m going to help Adam with his kite. He got it tangled again.”
Castiel thought he knew what Dean meant, as unlikely as it was. He leaned down, rubbing Dean’s cheekbone with his thumb, and stopped a few inches away.
“That was just me forgetting we had a guest.” Dean started gathering the ingredients for breakfast: box of generic raisin bran, bowl and spoon from the dishrack, carton of almond milk because Sam didn’t do dairy. “Sorry for assaulting your eyeballs.”
“Yeah,” Dean said, though with the hectocotylus filling all the space between his lips, it came out as a toneless grunt instead of words. Castiel seemed to receive the message, however, since he brought up one of his smoke-tendrils and curled it around Dean’s shaft.
“I—” Dean swallowed down the lump in his throat. “I don’t know. I guess I’m still looking for the right person.”
Dean smiled and winced simultaneously. He reached up to pat Castiel’s hand. It was a while before he spoke.
“Why would they do that?” Castiel said, drawing their attention. “This valley only received the water it did for so many years because of his favor. If one’s goal were to return rain to this place, killing or…disabling the dragon would be a strange way of going about it.”
“Well, I don’t know about better, but Sam and I are pretty close. He’s the only family I have, really.”
“I don’t know, Cass. You might’ve been too much for me to handle back then.” Dean sniffed his armpit. “I better shower before bed. Are you going to….”
. I’m not the only person who knows how to run this place. Sam was part of it for nine years before he went to college, and then he lived with Lisa and me the summer before last.” Dean licked his lips. “I can get Sam to take care of the farm. He’ll be fine for a week.”
“That was my mistake,” Castiel said sheepishly. “Certain species can perceive our language, or one of the others we blend into the signal. It…helps if they do. They rarely want to come aboard if they don’t understand our attempts to communicate.”
“It still tastes good, don’t worry.” Dean raised the shallow bowl of chia seeds to the camera. “We’re making chia pudding with coconut milk and topping it with berries and edible flowers. It only takes a few minutes to throw together. So, let’s get started. We need half a cup of chia seeds, a can of coconut milk, two tablespoons of honey—you can use maple syrup if you prefer.”
“Uh, yeah.” Dean gulped and took a step backwards, nearly tripping over a curl at the edge of the carpet. “I mean, yeah. Then—dinner.”
Dean cleared his throat again. Gabe was giving him that weird leering side-grin that seemed to be his neutral expression, and Dean felt more and more aware of everyone’s eyes on him as he fidgeted alone at the head of the table.
“I think I suspected.” Dean laughed. “Shit, I should’ve suspected about myself at that point. That’s repression for you, I guess.”
“How precise do we have to be?” Dean said, surveying the empty lot with his hands on his hips. “Like I said, I only remember the general area where I last saw Cass, not the exact spot.”
“When I return to you,” Castiel said, pulling back at last. “I won’t have to find my way. Our bond is the door between us. All I have to do is open it and walk through.”
Dean snorted. This guy wasn’t the smoothest talker, but there was something weirdly endearing about that. Cute, almost.
“I want to make you happy. I want both of us to feel good.” Castiel nuzzled his ear. “Promise to tell me if it doesn’t feel good.”
After Sam had driven back to DC and they’d cleaned up downstairs, Dean climbed the steps and shuffled to the bathroom. Since he had Sundays off now and he’d spent the entire day indoors, he still needed to shower before bed. With Castiel doing some organizing in the library, he planned to scrub up, get the bedroom ready, and go downstairs to collect him.
Castiel zipped up his suitcase and moved to the side of the bed. He sat down next to Dean, and the mattress dipped between them.
“I can’t say for sure, sire, but it sounds like thunder when he speaks. Low, rumbling. And he came in on a tempest. I imagine he wields lightning and all the other powers of the storm. Thankfully, I’ve never had occasion to confirm that.”
“If this doesn’t get you way more followers than a normal post, I’ll happily eat my words. Just—smile. Try to look relaxed.”
Dean had always been a visual person, so he was finding it hard not to imagine Castiel while he talked to him. He was sprawled out on those cloud-white bedsheets, his messy hair falling in his eyes and over the phone’s microphone, the duvet thrown back to reveal just the upper half of his body. Shirtless, with the golden sun painting every line of his lithe torso and narrow waist. He seemed the type to sleep in just his boxer briefs. Maybe less.
“Soy sauce. Oh, here.” Dean shut the refrigerator and nudged Castiel away from the stove. “I’m sure whoever this belongs to won’t mind.”
“He isn’t always home for Thanksgiving.” Dean flutters his lips. “He isn’t even home for Christmas half the time.”
Dean squinted and shook his head. The dusk had settled in, silhouetting the arms of the silver pines that separated their backyard from the train tracks, bearing a west wind that offered a tiny bit of relief from the heat of the day. Man, he knew he had daddy issues, but they were pretty bad if a 90-second encounter with a dad and his son stuck in his craw like this.
“I’m not trying to be harsh, angel. Heck, I’ve thought of going you-pick before. Probably most fruit farmers have.”
They continued down the slope into the city. Dean pointed out the produce market off the highway (“A lot of our fresh berries go there”), the livestock exchange building (“Never bought anything at the auction, but their diner’s good”), and the Museum of the Shenandoah Valley (“The gardens there are top notch”). Castiel followed along, nodding here and there to indicate his attentiveness.
Remove pot from heat and add butter and mashed pumpkin. Stir to combine, making sure that butter is fully melted. Add the Parmesan gradually, stirring until it has fully melted into the risotto. Taste and add more salt if necessary.
“Except the angel feather, yeah.” Dean reached for his keys. “Alright, let’s get moving. We’ll start driving to Wichita, Cass can meet us there.”
“For all you vegans watching,” Castiel said. “And Canadians. Fair amount of overlap there, in my experience.”
Dean blinked at the swaybacked horse fence, breathed in the balmy aroma of Kentucky bluegrass around their feet. The leaves of the black cherry trees whispered in the breeze. When Castiel nipped at the base of his neck, Dean giggled and jerked away.
“Nah, only a couple minutes. Charlie gave me an hour for lunch, so we can take our time. Your order’s my first one when I get back, anyway.”
“There you go.” Castiel doubled up the towel and lay it down under Dean. “I forgot how moist your skin is. This towel should keep the couch dry until I figure out a more long-term solution.”
“They might, they might not.” Sam chuckled. “The main thing is that Cass looks at you like you’re the reason the sun rises in the morning. Who cares what his family thinks?”
“It’s okay, baby.” Dean brushes his hand down Castiel’s side, stopping and squeezing where the ribs end. “Can you get your wings out now?”
“Well, yeah.” Dean snuck a glance at him. “You really want to do that? You know what rimming is, right?”
Castiel scowled. “Is this how it’s going to be from now on? You calling me old every chance you get?”
“That first time—I was 16; he was a day student in the year above me. Dirty blond hair, light eyes. A smile that could charm the pants off anyone.” Castiel rubbed his thumb over the back of Dean’s hand. “I guess I have a type.”
“Yeah.” Castiel scratched the back of his neck. “Sorry, I wasn’t sure how you wanted to approach that. If you wanted to tell everyone.”
The question was predictable, but Castiel seemed caught off guard. He stared out the restaurant’s bay window. The sun, sliced off by the restaurant’s ceiling, illuminated half his face and left the rest in darkness.
Castiel walked to one of the walls and traced the edge of a windowpane with his fingertips. “I can see the influence of the period. These are Art Deco lines.” He turned back and let out a sigh. “Dean, your home is even more beautiful than I imagined. It’s like a museum. I feel as if I’m about to cry.”
“Apologies, your Highness.” Dean peered around the cobweb-strewn gloom. “I’m just trying to find a safe way forward. I fear there may be traps.”
Castiel glided into the space beside Dean’s, just like the day they’d first met. Dean approached them around the front of his car. He was wearing a white graphic T-shirt today, tighter than anything he’d worn in previous weeks, and Castiel could see the slimness of his waist and the hard jut of his collarbone against the fabric. His sleeves were short, laying bare the entirety of his lithe, lightly freckled arms, all the way up to where his biceps ended just beneath his armpits. Unfortunately, his faded blue jeans were as loose as ever.
“It’s not your job to choose my boyfriends. I don’t know why you’ve been like this since I came out. You didn’t care which girls I was dating in high school.”
“A lot, actually. You can see pretty much everything here, out in the middle of nowhere. Uh, no offense.”
Castiel tilted his head against the pearl-white pillow. After a moment, he pushed his hand through his hair, smiling radiantly.
Dean gaped at him. What the hell? Castiel was the last person he’d expect to have been getting random tail and hiding it from everyone around him. Dean felt betrayed and impressed in equal measure.
“I wasn’t just trying to lecture you on the nature of angelic grace. I’m also making sure you don’t get addicted.”
“Oh,” Castiel said, once the tofu was in the pan and they were watching over it like a vigil. “Did you look at the flyer?”
“Then I’ve loved you for a very long time, Dean.” Castiel pressed a kiss to his lips. “My righteous man.”
“I’m sorry if it seemed like I was attacking you when I dissed dating apps. That wasn’t my intent.” Castiel rested his chin in his palm. “In truth, I wasn’t talking about you at all. I was just reflecting my own experiences—with the superficiality in the gay community, specifically. How there’s so much emphasis on bodies and dicks instead of minds and hearts. You’re right; there’s such a culture of hooking up just to get more notches on your bedpost. I’ve always rejected that.”
“Yes,” Castiel interrupted, the syllable emerging more as a growl than a recognizable word. “In fact, why don’t you pack a bag when you get home and stay with us for the weekend, Dean. There’s a guest room that I can make up for you.”
“I didn’t mean—I’m talking about this. The droopy tip part.” Dean pulled a little at the opening in Castiel’s foreskin. “Not your dick. Your dick’s a good size. Nice and long. Pretty thick, too. Does it hurt when I do that?”
“Of course. Of course, 100%.” She rubbed his back. “I’m really sorry. You know I only want you to be happy.”
Meg rolled her eyes. “I thought Dean was the clueless one. Looks like he might have some competition.”
Over the next couple days, Castiel helped Dean with filling out the preliminary information form for listing in the Virginia and national historical registers. At first, the going was slow, but Dean remembered something from years back that might speed up the process.
“Oh, he’s still here.” Dean let him go and crossed his arms. “Try being a little shit about Cass like you used to be. You’ll be taking a nice swim before you know it.”
“It’s nothing special, I know. I’m just happy that business is good. Moving to a new place is always….”
“Is that the real reason you’re reluctant? Because you’re afraid of meeting him? Or…or because you think it’s too soon?”
“You remember what it was like being a teenager. You want privacy, even when nothing’s going on.” Dean pursed his lips. “Or….”
Dean gulped. Sam was about to clear his throat to remind them of his and Miracle’s presence, but the scent of expensive perfume and the rustle of silk stopped him cold.
“It’s okay.” Castiel finished packing away the camera before stopping to breathe. “I…thank you, Father. I appreciate that.”
“Hey, I’m sorry. I guess I’m a little suspicious of strangers. You can’t blame me after what just happened.”
“Yes.” Castiel started transferring the bag of frozen foods to the freezer. “Anyway, we’re in a small town in Idaho. I don’t think they have ‘weird natural versions’ of Lucky Charms at the grocery store.”
“Oh!” Dean shook out half of the pasta and eased it into the pot of bubbling water. “Yeah, definitely don’t wait too long to start your linguine. Otherwise, everything else might get cold waiting.”
Blue-Eyes was the sixth dragon he’d faced down and—depending on what Dean found upon investigating the lair—either the fourth he’d killed or the third that had slipped his grasp. This one was by far the largest of the six, and distinct in several other ways besides. He hadn’t attempted to fight back, even just with his wings or claws. He’d expressed regret for the hardship he’d caused for the villagers. He’d attempted to reason with Dean. All of this was unheard of.
Dean led the way down one of the piers. He nodded at the green-hulled, wooden-rigged sailboat at the end.
Castiel picked up two bags—Jack’s toiletries and the cat food—and met Jack at the mouth of the hallway.
“Perhaps you should have explained that to the dragon upon meeting him,” Castiel snapped. “Instead of gratifying your bloodlust like a common thug.”
They said goodnight, and Dean watched the end call screen for a while after. He closed his eyes and squeezed his forehead. The churning of the dishwasher seemed to increase in volume with each passing second. He felt unsteady, ungrounded, as if the water could burst forth and sweep him away at any moment.
It didn’t matter, though. As far as Dean was concerned, all dragons deserved to die. He would hunt this one.
The exchange was broken up by the arrival of their waiter, and the next few minutes were occupied with the taking of their orders. Dean watched Castiel’s expression for most of the time. Castiel wouldn’t return his gaze, instead focusing on his menu and huffing every few breaths. Behind him, the tangerine-hued sunset glittered on the bay, casting sparks of color that vanished just as soon as they appeared.
When the smoke cleared and Sam opened his eyes again, the paper with the incantation was nowhere to be found. He picked up the singed skyphos and scrambled to his feet.
They lay in silence for a while, the winter wind rattling the shutters against the old brick walls. Dean thought back to his past Christmases—the single one in Lawrence he remembered, Mom’s awful Watergate salad that Dad adored; the ones on the road, Charlie Brown and free church dinners and telephones that didn’t ring; the ones at Bunker Hill, Dad and Sam doing their best pretending of the year for Dean’s sake. He realized that almost all of them fit into one of those two categories.
“I’ll just get a closeup before digging in.” Castiel walked to the tripod with his pudding, changing something with the angle of the phone before returning.
He had to tell him the truth, no matter how much the thought scared him. No matter how afraid he was of all the awful scenarios he’d dreamt up that morning as he’d lain in this very spot. No matter how determined Dean was to not get it through his thick head that he and Meg were only friends.
“They are.” Castiel slurped a bite of his curry. “Jack won’t get here until Wednesday. I’m having a car pick him up from Dulles, so you can just focus on cooking.”
At the inn—which was called “The Roadhouse” in spite of the fact that it wasn’t fronted by anything that could properly be called a road—Dean tied up Baby at the horse trough and paused to read the notice board. There were more papers pinned to it than he’d expected for a settlement of this size, and he felt a moment of hope that there’d be a job for the taking matching his competencies. What he found instead was gibberish that only became more mystifying the further he read.
“He’s the legendary Salamander Man of Bunker Cemetery,” Castiel replied. “He doesn’t talk, so he can’t tell you himself.”
“Yeah, I adopted him after Dad died.” Dean checked the temperature of the oil. “We never really had pets growing up. I always wanted one.”
“Um, Dean.” Castiel poured them two glasses of water. “Tonight, it’d be best if you don’t get too close to anyone. It’ll be dark—spooky lighting for Halloween—and people tend to get drunk at these things, both of which will aid in your disguise. But even so, the closer you get to other humans, the more likely it is that you’ll be detected. We can explain away your hands and tail as part of the costume, but your teeth are harder, since they’re internal, and they go all the way to the back of your jaw, unlike fake vampire fangs. A quick glance shouldn’t arouse any suspicion, but try to look down and hide your mouth when you’re eating.”
“No, I’m fine. Just…just mellow. I think it didn’t hit me right away. I think it’s all the shots Benny had us doing.”
Maybe—and this was the last thought in his head as he curled onto his side and shut his eyes—the weirdest part of all of this was that he was beginning to feel none of it was very weird at all.
