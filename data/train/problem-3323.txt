“Well one lady was sure she saw the Loch Ness Monster but it ended up just being a big stick, or some shit” Kit said handing Cass his shorts, “follow us to the equipment room to get your first aid packs and whistles.”
“Ok, Heathers, which way is the uniform room?” Dean asked secretly proud of himself for that reference. But all he got was a annoyed eye roll from Sam and a supportive thumbs up from Cass.
The boys nodded in acknowledgement, this didn’t sound like anything they had dealt with before, werewolves never didn’t any hunting in the water before, and vamps would never just leave an arm or a leg.
After a brief pit-stop at a 7-below Dean was outfitted with a tank-top that read: Do You Like My Beach Bod? A pair of palm tree swim trunks and bright yellow flip-flops.
“Ok, well in that case I guess I should fill you boys in,” She said relaxing a little, “Over the past 5 summers at least 6 tourists go missing every year. We have managed to convince the public that these are just accidents since all of the disappearances have happened in the water. But this summer every week we have seemed to find a body part... nothing big enough to identify any of the victims". Shaking her head she continued unconvinced of the next part, "It could just be sharks but there has been no evidence other than bite marks on the body parts that appear.”
“Huack,” Dean groaned and hunched over. Cass,ignoring him, put his hand on one of the legs on the table, he poked around the open wound until he pulled away with some sort of sticky goo on his middle finger.
“DON’T TOUCH ME CASS!”
“Well we will figure it out later but we should get ready for work in the morning” Sam said as they opened the doors to the Impala and got ready to drive back to the motel. The only thing that could be heard from them as they pulled out of the parking lot was Dean shrieking,
After the papers were filled out Sam, Dean, and Cass walked outside of the tower, Kit and Orlando were waiting for them, they were laughing and whispering to each other.
Marina gave Cass a weird glance and Cass took this as a sign that he had overshared. He looked at Dean to save him from this situation but Dean had a glazed look over his face so Cass gave him a little nudge with his elbow, “Right Dean?”
Sorry its short, I have a 3rd chapter coming, I just felt I needed to post this first.
“Cat? CAT!” He yelled frantically. Without hesitation he jumped into the water and felt a slimy hand on his leg pulling him further into the water. He barely had time to scream before he was yanked underwater.
“Shouldn’t we figure out what that-shit- is first?” Cass asked ignoring Deans gestures to the sink and got a stern no-face from Dean.
“We get that a lot,” Sam chimed in, staring at Dean. Dean shrugged and kept going,
They regrouped and got into their FBI costumes at the Beachfront motel.
Brandon watched his girlfriend take off her shirt and put her phone on the beach. He turned around to do the same.
She turned to leave and simultaneously Dean and Sams eyes drifted down. Cass, unaware of what the brothers were looking at started looking over the office for a pen to fill the job applications out.
“Yes, I agree,” Cass said, staring at Dean. Dean nodded his head down, pulled his shades down to the bridge of his nose and gave Cass a little wink.
“I found them at a store and I brought them because I knew this conversation would happen,” Sam said with a grin on his face.
“Yeah we would like to apply” Sam answered wondering what kind of management this place had.
Dean stared at them disgusted, he didn't do shorts, “Where in hell did you find these and why the fuck did you bring them?”
“Its so fucking hot outside,” Dean complained as he got out of the drivers seat. He had his usual getup on, a tee layered with a plaid shirt with the accompanying ratty-old jeans and thick work boots.
“Yeah,” Sam said, pulling out 3 fake documents, “Yeah and CPR training too.” He handed the papers over taking note of her soft fingers barely grazing his hand.
“Nothing much, but, a bunch of our friends have gone missing,” Orlando replied, “The police don’t have anything to say about it.”
Cass on the other hand, doesn't get hot.
“Yeah she is right through that door,” the receptionist said pointing towards a door that read, SHERIFF.
The brothers exchanged confused glances, Loch ness monster, they had never heard of it but in there defense up until a year ago they hadn't heard of angels being real either.
“Yeah, we're here about the disappearances.” Sam replied, he got a good look at her map, and saw that she had multiple locations circled in red marker.
“We will be back to help you guys get uniforms,” Orlando said as he and Kit left the tower.
“Ok if you don’t then I will,” This got Dean a well deserved smack on the back of the head from Cass.
“So, what do you kids know about the disappearances?”  Dean asked trying to sound obtuse and younger.
“I’ll take them,” Dean said enthusiastically grabbing the cheap, plastic sunglasses off of Cass’s head, “I look better in them anyway”
“First we have gotta find out what we are dealing with,” Sam said, “After we get uniforms and get settled in here, we will check with local police to see if they have any leads.”
“Yeah, are all 3 of you applying? We have some lifeguard positions open.”
“No, not us specifically but many tourists claim to have seen things,” Kit said while tossing Dean a pair of swim shorts. Dean took the shorts and sized them up to his own shorts with his lip curling up making a disgusted face. They looked a little small but Cass gave him a smile.
Once the teens had left Dean couldn’t hold it in any longer, “Ok. Wow, she is hot shit! Sam, dude, you gotta hit that!” Sam blushed as he smacked Dean with the forms.
“Lifeguards,” Sam replied. Dean looked down at the shorts and rolled his eyes.
“Hi, agents Kirk, McCoy, and Scotty,” Dean said while motioning to Sam and Cass but stopped when she gave him a confused look,
She let out a sigh, “Sorry boys, my name is Sheriff Ryan, I have just been obsessed with this case and I think I have finally gotten somewhere and now you guys are going to come in and take my glory.”
“So Sammy, what is the angle we are going for, FBI, fishing and wildlife, the beach police?”
The boys followed Kit and Orlando to a building near the public entrance to the beach. The building looked more like a post office than a living quarters for lifeguards. It wasn’t brightly colored like the others and didn’t have many windows. They crossed a ratty bridge and followed the teens through the doors and down a hallway to the uniform room.
“Ok, so full disclosure we have had a lot of people go missing so I don’t our boss is going to be too picky, he will probably just ask you some basic questions,” He motioned to his partner,
“Ahh——“”
“Ok Danny and Sandy, let's go.” Sam said, “We got a monster to catch.”
“Ok” Marina replied, opening up a drawer from the filing cabinet in the corner. “I just need you guys to fill out these forms-- you guys have lifeguard certifications right?” She asked, handing 3 copies of the same form to Sam.
“What the fuck is that?” Dean asked, barely able to look at it and eyes going wide as Cass held it up to his nose. Ignoring his profanity and bewildered looks Cass replied,
“Yeah whatever the fuck this is” Dean added sharing Sam reaction.
“Hand me that test tube.” Not wanted to look at his boyfriend anymore Dean walked over the desk and rummaged through it until he found a plastic container and brought it over to Cass.
“Yeah, we get it,” Sam said looking at Dean. Dean caught his eye and shrugged, this place did seem like they had access to police records. “What are your names again?”
She starts to tear up again, but averts her face and wipes her eyes angrily.
MAE: Ah, about… our interpretations of the characters.
) And you are? Mike, I presume?
SAM: Dean, don’t you think we should talk…
DEAN: Not listening to you.
DEAN: What
SAM: You know, the homophobes...
MAE: You know it?
SAM: Okay. Thank you so much for your help, and again we are very sorry. We will do anything we can.
SAM: Hm. I feel like you deserve to know. Uh, those books you read? They’re true. They’re all based on things that really happened.
EXT. OUTSIDE MAE’S HOUSE
Sam turns to the second officer.
DEAN: I’m going to go to bed. And you know what, I might even look at some pictures of naked women before I sleep. Because I like hot girls.
SAM: Well, okay, have a good day then.
DEAN: Any idea who she was sneaking out with?
OFFICER: Make that girls. (
OFFICER 2: Looks like she was strangled as well. Everything else looks similar too, as far as I can see right now. Scratches on her hands and dirt on her knees, too. Looks like she was running before she got killed
SAM: Sure.
SAM: Okay, if you’re attracted to him but not in
Dean looks at it for an extended moment, then goes back to the bikini woman. He spends an agonizing amount of time switching between looking at the topless man and the bikini-clad woman, trying to decide which to buy.
He stands up.
DEAN: Awesome.
SAM: And just don’t go outside. Especially not to the forest.
FATHER: She was home with us. Watching TV.
) We just got news that another body was found. Definitely related. Same forest, same symbols on the body. Same weird smell of rotten eggs even, apparently.
FATHER & MOTHER: Thank you. Goodbye.
For the first time, her smile falters slightly, but she catches herself quickly.
SAM: And your mother?
Both of the parents look at him in shock.
He and Dean fumble for their fake badges and flash them.
DEAN: Any idea what she was doing in the forest that night?
DEAN: (
MAE: Yeah. They’re friends, I think, they all joined together. Following our ad on the internet. Don’t know them otherwise.
MOTHER: No, you don’t understand. I mean they were in love. They were a couple.
DEAN: Uh. Okay. So Ashley, Jess and Mike are the people that left?
ASHLEY: AP English.
DEAN: It’s true.
INT. MAE’S ROOM
DEAN: So, you.
DEAN: Save it.
DEAN: I’m not agreeing with you, bitch, I’m saying are you fucking stupid?
MAE: Well, not really. I mean…
) Yes of course.
SAM: Hopefully you’ll never see us again. I’ll make sure to tell the cops the phone is yours, and you can go and pick it up soon, okay?
MAE: Here.
INT. IMPALA
DEAN: So the day before.
OFFICER 2: Seems to be mostly gone now but it was definitely noticeable when I got here. First time it was stronger, even.
SAM: You know, it’s not like…
DEAN: I’d say just some demon, but…
SAM: Yes, please, that would be great.
What is following her is not visible in the dark. The only thing we can see is a spot of light, coming closer and closer and finally catching up with her. The girl sobs.
DEAN: Oh, no, he does.
This phrase sparks both Sam and Dean’s interest immediately.
SAM: Yeah, probably because people have been walking around the place. She was running. I doubt she would've had time to draw a devil's trap.
DEAN: And you know that how? You got a wire to the big man upstairs? Cause I know a lot of people who’d be dying to learn about that.
They hurriedly enter the car. Dean starts the engine. Sam, who has been holding the phone up to his ear, puts it down.
ASHLEY: MY parents raised me to know a sinner when I see one. So did Liza’s parents, but then, alas, she was led off the righteous path… led astray by that Julie girl… (
MOTHER: She wouldn’t tell me.
SAM: Speaking of which…
) I'm Agent Reed, this is my partner Agent Stone. We're here about the girl that was murdered.
DEAN: (
The door bursts open and Sam and Dean re-enter the room they left just hours ago.
MAE: Nah, dad’s at work. Brother’s still in school.
) Bye, Mae Chen.
Dean and Sam take a closer look at the body and the surroundings.
Sam leaves and closes the door behind him.
She makes a noise of protest.
Three people are already in the room. Mae is on the floor. A tall, muscular teenage boy sits on her chest, with his hands around her throat. She is struggling, trying to kick him and push him off her.
DEAN:
Ashley’s mother looks shocked. Ashley does too, for a moment, but then catches herself.
SAM: Anything out of the ordinary, really.
a Destiel?
DEAN: Uh, I think it does.
He picks up the newspaper again and pretends to read.
SAM: Still, we should talk to her parents as well.
Even though they try to play it cool, the brothers’ shock is unmistakable.
DEAN: You have no idea what you’re talking about.
MAE: But, anyway. Why would that be relevant to them being killed?
FATHER: No, sorry. Mae probably has them, though.
FATHER: Mae Chen, their friend.
MAE: And sometimes we’d dress up as the characters, you know, for fun. I’d be the younger brother, Julie would be the older one, and Liza would be the angel.
DEAN: What were you doing Friday night?
SAM: Dude, you’re sleeping with a man, you have to be…
DEAN: What?
DEAN: (
) in the end it didn’t help… I just wish I could have done more…
OFFICER: Sure.
Sam sighs.
MOTHER: Are you implying
) Anyway, did Julie maybe say anything? Any thoughts as to what had happened to Liza?
Maybe it’s best not to let her know.
SAM: Did anything out of the ordinary happen that day?
DEAN: And she’s still around? Anyone talk to her in the last few days?
MOTHER: You see, it’s all over the room, she kept drawing those… and she was listening to that satanic music too… (
DEAN: Again, Sam, what the fuck are you talking about?
ASHLEY: (
MAE: I don’t know how to defend myself. I don’t even do any sports.
SAM: And we’ll give you our numbers, okay? And if something weird happens, anything, you can call us, and we’ll be there. Alright?
SAM: And you’re not stupid. You’re a very smart girl.
SAM: Well, yeah
SAM: Yeah.
Finally he gives up and moves on to the baked goods, where he picks up a packaged angel cake and puts it in his bag.
This finally wipes the smile off Ashley’s face for good. Mike whimpers like a shot puppy. Dean grins.
SAM: The sulfur?
Sam, Dean and the officer cross the tape to inspect the body.
DEAN: You know, something that might be connected to those symbols they found on her.
) Uh. Have pie. Uh. Sorry. I didn’t know -
She puts a hand on her forehead, tears running from her closed eyes.
them?
Sam looks defeated.
DEAN: Uh, he’s a fucking angel of the lord. He doesn’t feel things like that. Wait, is your phone ringing?
DEAN: And rebellious teenagers aren’t usually found murdered in a devil’s trap.
OFFICER 2: Well, you're right, I suppose it would.
DEAN: What?
INT. IMPALA
DEAN: So what if I was hooking up with the angel?
ASHLEY: Like I told you. I’m an angel. An avenging one, perhaps.
DEAN: Sam, what the fuck are you talking about?
DEAN: Do you happen to also have the names of the rest of the book club?
DEAN: What did you just call me?
She wipes her tears, messing up the mascara even more dramatically.
SAM: Yeah, yeah, hold on.
The room of a teenager who seems to be going through a goth phase. Several My Chemical Romance posters decorate the walls. There are several mediocre drawings of demonic or monstrous figures taped to various surfaces, often captioned with or surrounded by strange symbols and letters.
Sam is sitting in the kitchen. Dean comes in and slams the newspaper down on the table.
SAM: Okay. Too much information.
FATHER: Do you think she’s… in
The brother’s bags are sitting by the door, ready to leave for whichever place they are going to visit next. But for now, they are still sitting at the kitchen table.
DEAN: What book are you reading?
SAM: I’m really sorry for your loss.
MOTHER: (
SAM: Huh. Maybe. But this isn’t anything we’ve seen before. To be in the books it would have to be something that’s already happened to us, right?
Both of them are immediately on their feet. They are already on their way out of the door and into the car when Sam tries to call her back.
MOTHER: Oh, some months ago. Half a year, maybe. She kept going on the internet in these…
) What, Sammy?
SAM: Okay, look, it’s like… Well, now that I think about it, is Castiel even a man? Angels don’t really have a gender, do they?
INT. MOTEL BEDROOM
We still can’t see what is attacking her, but a voice cuts through the dark.
MAE: Thank you.
) Hey Dean. I’m back. They didn’t -
Dean lifts his bottle of beer for a toast with whatever fruity little drink Sam is having.
"Woah, it's ok, I
Castiel looked at her
"I've got some work for you," she said and ran a finger up his inner thigh.
He didn't have to explain himself. He didn't have to answer any questions. He didn't have to label it.
"Hello, Sam," said Castiel.
getting hung up on the "gay" thing.
Dean's heart skipped a beat. He tried not to look as uncomfortable as he felt. "What do you mean?"
He heard Ellen exhale. "Why won't he bite him? It'd keep him safe, wouldn't it? From other packs?"
Kay was sitting in the passenger seat that Sam had been in only moments before.
"I look at your soul," said Castiel.
"Help me clear everyone out then."
Then, Dean almost didn't dare to think it, he imagined Castiel fucking
hard in his chest. He leaned in but then pulled away again
"It...
"It wouldn't make sense. He's never
"Liked you?" said Sam, eyebrow raised.
"Whatever," muttered Dean. "Let's go check out the missing kid's house."
"You sound like you miss it," said Dean.
Dean frowned. "My soul?"
"Why?" said Dean
"What the - are you talking about our life? There isn't going to be a damn sequel. We've done our job. We've served our time. That's it. You want a sequel go speak to whichever bozos wrote the tv show in this universe, ok? 'Cause we're done."
into why he had agreed to try this.
"Nearly old enough to drink," she said and slid him a beer too with a wink. Castiel caught it between his hands. He sniffed the rim. Not because he had never had a beer before but out of habit.
The little poster Castiel had adjusted slipped off the computer onto the floor. Castiel's face flooded with heat. "I-I have to - you can't say those things here, Dean."
Sam. Why don't you serve them their next round?"
like five minutes ago. Any chance it could get back there?"
"Ok," he said. "So, if you're not into that... what are you into?"
more sexual. It felt wrong thinking of Castiel that way but Dean had to admit that he liked it. He
Dean pulled a face. "I don't know what's more unlikely, a god with a heart or a kid eating an ancient relic."
Castiel stood up immediately and followed.
"That Dean Winchester has a bit of a reputation. I haven't met him myself but he's not someone you want to get on the wrong side of. I heard he put two alphas in hospital for talking shit about his brother. He's a mean son of a bitch when he wants to be."
"What?"
"The hell if I know," said Dean. Castiel had transported them to a nearby park with a large open field. A guy walking a dog and a couple of kids were in the distance, kicking a ball.
"What car is it?" interrupted Dean.
Dean leapt over the low railings and dropped onto the beach. He looked over his shoulder to check Castiel was still with him. The angel walked down the stone steps, following his footprints in the rusty coloured sand.
Sam and Dean shared a look.
"Chaos. She's the goddess of chaos," finished Sam.
me when you insult yourself," said Castiel, clearly restraining the anger in his voice.
. He swiped glasses from tables here and there. He spotted an easy target on the edge of a table and reached to get it.
Dean's hands were warm and firm. He was so close. His scent was delicious. Castiel's whole body thrummed with desire.
Cas looked up at his building. “Yea, lost the key remember? We have to leave the bathroom window by the fire escape unlocked when no one’s home and climb through it to get in.” Cas paused to think. He really needed to email the landlord again and ask again for him to please maybe make them a new key.
Forcing himself back to the whiskey in front of him, Dean glanced up at the bar mirror. He put great effort into ignoring how much he looked like shit. His eyes had deep bags under them, no doubt a result of the restless 3 hours of sleep he tended to get. His face was even starting to show changes, slightly hollowed from the lack of food and creased from the frown that he consistently held there. He was happy to turn his attention away from himself as he glanced at the other patrons at the bar. There were only three others; Chris and Jake were weekday regulars content with watching baseball reruns on the TV, and Jamie’s roommate Missy was seated at a high table, skimming paper as she waited for Jamie to get off at 4.
Cass nodded, “Have you guys seen anything?”
“I am not putting these on until absolutely necessary,” Dean proclaimed. Cass looked a little disappointed, he could imagine Dean in booty shorts, he could imagine kissing Dean in booty shorts.
“Before you touch anything else, you need to wash that shit off your hands.” Dean said pointing to the sink in the room
“Good,” she said, looking over the papers, “with the amount of people that have gone missing I am going to need all of the help I can get,” she added, winking in Sam’s direction.
MAE: Okay. Ugh. It’s stupid, but… okay, there’s this series of books, you’ve probably never heard of them, but Liza came across one of them in the library and started reading it and we all sort of… infected each other. And then put up ads on an internet forum and got a couple other fans involved. So we would meet on a weekly basis, exchange the books so we wouldn’t all have to buy them, and talk about them. That’s it, pretty much.
MAE: Has it come up in another case or something like that?
DEAN: Shit.
MAE: That was… Friday. No. We met on Thursdays.
EXT. OUTSIDE MAE’S HOUSE
MAE: Uh, it’s called
OFFICER 2: No idea. But we can give you their parents' addresses.
SAM: You know I saw you and Cas, I…
DEAN: Okay, it was only a few times. And it’s not like we talk much.
DEAN: Maybe she was trying to protect herself against the demon that was after her, but messed up and it got her? Looks like the lines are broken.
) Please - please don’t hurt us.
MIKE: (
SAM: It’s Mae.
SAM: Oh, hello. We’re here to ask some questions…
) Okay. So normal book club business?
) To be honest I don’t even know where to start searching. I mean, what are we looking at?
Sam, Dean and Ashley sit on chairs around a glass coffee table.
MOTHER: She didn’t talk much at all in the days between… She just stayed in her room.
- was… homosexual!
SAM: I do, I do, just… does Cas know that?
She rummages through a pile on her desk and pulls out a sheet of paper with a list of names written on it in ballpoint pen. From another pile, she pulls out a marker and circles three entries on the list.
SAM: About this morning.
DEAN: Oh god. These people are writing made up stories about us.
SAM: Like you said, you’d be surprised.
DEAN: Fingers crossed Mae knows something.
INT. A GAS STATION
SAM: (
EXT. OUTSIDE THE HOUSE
SAM: Because to me it looked pretty clear.
DEAN: Okay, don’t - if you say anything right now, I swear - I’m not in love with him! That’s not what this is!
DEAN: Oh, no, not that.
TITLE CARD
DEAN: Absolutely not.
BOY: I wasn’t doing anything, I swear, we were just messing around, sir, she made me…
ASHLEY: I don’t believe you. I think your gun and your macho act are as fake as your badge.
DEAN: Alright, I think I got it.
MAE: Yeah.
DEAN: Cas! What’s up? Anything new?
FATHER: Of course. Anything we can do to help.
DEAN: Huh. You'd think that popularity would go down after a body is found there.
DEAN: Oh, holy shit. Are you fucking kidding me?
SAM: This is about Liza and Julie. You’ve probably heard.
SAM: You know, I understand the feeling. I lost my mother when I was young. Barely remember her.
The police officer (2) who is already at the scene and kneeling next to the body stands up to talk to them.
DEAN: What?? (
SAM: But then why is she dead too?
Dean pockets the list. They both stand up from the bed and make their way through the small, cramped room. When they’re at the door, Mae calls out to them again.
SAM: No, I guess, not Cas specifically, but in general...
He points a gun at the boy, who immediately jumps up with his hands in the air.
SAM: We’re looking for Ashley?
SAM: Uh, FBI.
SAM: Can you give us the names of the people who were kicked out? Actually, just everyone in the club?
DEAN: …
SAM: No hex bags, no… signs of hexes at all, actually. I have no idea.
DEAN:
DEAN: Awesome. Let’s go to Ohio.
SAM: Dean… you obviously like men... And there’s nothing wrong with that!
SAM: I don’t hear anything.
DEAN: Alright, enough of the heart-to-heart, we’ve all known people who died, can we get started?
DEAN: Unless she’s, you know, murdered in the mean time.
He turns to Mike, who has been standing quietly with his trembling hands in the air the entire scene.
SAM: Okay. Thank you. We’ll look into it. We’ll let you know if we need more information.
DEAN: I think I’ve found us a case.
Sam raises his eyebrows at him. Dean shrugs.
SAM: I don’t know.
SAM: (
The girl screams. Then her voice is muffled. She continues to struggle audibly.
SAM: I just don’t want you thinking there’s something wrong with it, because there’s not.
) Is Sam here?
) I would
DEAN: So what do you think? You got anything?
SAM: If we need anything else, we’ll let you know. Alright, have a good evening now. And again we are so sorry for your loss.
SAM: Are your parents not home?
SAM: Uh....
SAM: We need to talk about this at some point.
MAE: It’s okay. It’s been a while.
SAM: Yeah.
DEAN: What the hell are you talking about?
SAM: Oh my god.
what this is about?
DEAN: Yeah.
DEAN: Uh, yeah, I do. I have a gun pointed at you.
SAM: It’s not like I didn’t have my suspicions, but…
Dean takes a pair of handcuffs - engraved with devil’s traps, not that it matters now - from one of his pockets and reaches for Ashley’s wrist. When she tries to evade him, he lifts the gun again, and she gives in and lets him close the handcuffs around her right hand. Mike is less resistant, allowing Dean to lock the second cuff around his left hand. He never takes his eyes off the gun.
The door opens.
MOTHER: She was always drawing these… occult symbols and talking about demons and… vampires and things like that. And she refused to keep going to church. (
MAE: (
ASHLEY: Of course. Please come in.
SAM: What book series?
ASHLEY: They insisted that an angel - an
The brothers raise their eyebrows, looking uncomfortable.
DEAN: You’re the one who’s fucking a demon.
MAE: And good luck with the investigation.
WOMAN: Is something wrong?
, and sneaking out. So I disconnected her internet. But… (
SAM: Can we take that? Aren’t you gonna need it anymore?
DEAN: And what’s your problem?
SAM: See you then.
In the backseat of the car, they kiss.
DEAN: Do you, by any chance, know if she knew a girl called Julie Brown?
She continues crying while her husband holds her and strokes her back.
DEAN: You think someone from that group read something in the books, tried it for fun, accidentally summoned something real?
DEAN: Don’t know what that is.
ASHLEY: Angry? Oh, no. Disappointed, maybe… but now… I am just sorry. It’s strange, isn’t it. How a sudden death changes things. To think that I was still talking to them a few days ago...
She looks down. A few tears roll down her face and smudge her mascara.
Sam and Dean, wearing their fake FBI suits, are introducing themselves to a police officer.
Sam takes Dean aside. They speak quietly to avoid being heard.
SAM: …
Dean takes a look at the list.
SAM: I don’t think that makes a difference.
SAM: Maybe we should check out that internet forum they were talking about. Might lead us somewhere.
INT. LIZA’S ROOM
He starts driving, fast.
ASHLEY: Do you really think you could get away with killing a girl like me? Look at me! I’m the kind of girl they start national campaigns for.
“So Clarence,” Meg asked as they locked the doors behind them, “are you coming out tonight?”
“By the time I got here they had already left. I was actually surprised to see that you didn’t go with them.”
“No, no I don’t think so.”
Dean just scoffed as he began to move Cas through the first floor. “Cas you’re rambling, you’re definitely not fine. Plus I told you earlier, we’re basically best friends now. Now come on you big lug help me out with the stairs here.”
Before he was completely asleep he felt Dean adjusting him, moving him onto his side and pulling a sheet over him. Cas heard a mumbled “Fucking idiot, need to get some sleep.” as he slipped into darkness.
“Oh would you look at that,” Dean mumbled as they emerged from the tree line into a clearing where a group of four college-age kids were gathered around a tent and campfire. “Hey dumbasses,” he snarked, getting their attention, “the forest is closed for a reason.”
“Oh honey no it’s on me today I need to make sure you boys are being fed right, you’re both far too skinny.” Cas directed his eyes towards the floor, remembering his three days straight of oatmeal meals. Judging by Dean’s lack of argument, he was thinking a similar thing. “Now both of you, get on outta here, and don’t be strangers you hear Dean Winchester!”
And so Cas and Dean found themselves pushing through the woods towards the smoke.
It’s a Thursday afternoon, and Dean is sitting at the bar outside of Lebanon for the third time that week. Last month, he would have had ten unread messages from Sam lighting up his phone. But right now Sammy isn’t even in Kansas, he’s down in Texas on a rugaru case that Dean would normally be on. Sam didn’t even invite Dean on this one though. Turns out that a month and a half of “no” is enough to make a guy take a hint. Dean figures he should care that Sam is running solo, but he decides that if anyone ought to worry, it’s the rugaru who has a Winchester on its tail.
Cas looked back at Dean, who was quite frankly looking more shocked than Cas would’ve expected. “Yea, it’s fine. It’s right there on the fire escape.”
“I don’t even know your last name, you really think I’m going to let you drive me around the whole fucking city of Philadelphia?”
He turned, probably noticing the sound of Dean almost smacking himself off the concrete. “Hello Dean.”
you - I don’t need you to fucking babysit me.”
“Maybe when you start using my name I’ll start listening to what you say” he retorted with a raised brow.
“Kinda is a word for it.” They fell into a silence, not quite a comfortable one, but one that Castiel couldn’t really figure out how to break without seeming intrusive.
Mama’s was remarkably empty for 8:30 AM. The only patrons were some elderly couples scattered around the tables. The whole place smelled like breakfast meat and coffee, and Cas’s mouth started watering the second they walked in. Dean made a beeline for a booth in the corner, sitting down on one side and motioning for Cas to slide in across from him.
“Oh we are so screwed.” Dean said. “We gotta get you guys out of here.”
“Dude, you look like shit.”
“Alright Missouri ok let the poor kid go,” Dean said. “I’ll see ya Krissy, run an extra gym lap for me will ya? Come on Cas lets get outta here.”
“I’ve been ranger of this county 20 years and I’ve never seen anything like this. Maybe a cougar or bear, but that doesn’t explain where the kids are now.” Cas nodded in response.
“It’s 14 hours to Baraga.” Cas relied monotonically as Dean returned his view to the road, hearing rustling as Cas moved around looking for the music.
“Well like I said, I enjoy it. Plus,” he started with a small smile, “music does seem to help pass the time on these long drives.” Dean nodded as Cas settled back into silence, seeming more interested in the road than in Dean. Accepting that they wouldn’t be having any late-night heart-to-hearts like he and Sam tended to do, Dean relaxed back into the cushion and allowed himself to be hypnotized by the scattered porch lights they passed as they drove up the highway.
Cas hated how he could already pick out the way Dean’s face relaxed at the question.
Dean slipped the ID back into its sleeve before he tossed it over to Cas. He looked about as far from a State Ranger as you could get, but Dean wasn’t about to tell him to change. Every time he saw that trench coat filled out instead of hidden in the back of his closet a thrill shot up Dean’s spine and he wasn’t about to give that up.
Even after he finally stopped chugging water, Dean’s face was still set in a grimace when he linked eyes with Castiel. This of course, only caused Cas to laugh even harder. Dean, after his eyes widened significantly, soon dropped his grimace in favor of a massive smile braking out on his face, followed by his own round of hysterics. And that is how two hungover college students on the edge of finals week found themselves laughing over black coffee on a very early Friday morning in a small diner in west philly.
Kari watched his hand move, clearly feeling bolder than their earlier interaction. “Oh well shucks you know that ain’t the truth now don’t you Dean-o.” He met Dean’s eyes as his hand clasped around the hilt of the knife. “You know as well as I do that you’re here for another hit of that warm and glow-y blue stuff.” He paused for a second as he pulled away from the Impala, positioning himself closer to the passenger front tire as he inched around to the front of the car. “You can’t fool me, I know the magic, and I know damn well when someone’s hooked as hell. I gotta say Dean-o, I’m not a bit surprised to see you.” Dean responded by narrowing his eyes and setting his jaw, even as his hand released his grip on the knife. “Especially after I made it so easy to follow me here, did you like the ride by the way? Picked it up at a scrapyard the other week and am still a bit sentimental towards it.”
Dean’s mouth quirked up. “Hey thanks man, I mean it’s been awhile now, so it doesn’t bother me as much anymore. You know he wasn’t really the most amazing dad, we were mostly raised by our Uncle Bobby, but he was still my dad.” He paused to take a sip of his coffee (if you could call it that with all the cream that had been dumped in it). “And I don’t mind missing the holidays too much; it’s out of my control at this point anyways.” He glanced up at Cas, his eyes lighting up. “Plus, now I get a chance to bug you until then. I’m going to drag you around this city whether you like it or not. Call it hazing for coming to school in Philadelphia.”
The whole room was what some might call “organized chaos,” and what Castiel considered “typical broke college student.” It was homey, in a weird, bright pink smiley face duct tape kinda way.
“What?” Dean asked, blinking out the stupor caused by the very much alive Castiel sitting a few feet in front of him. “They went where again?”
Kari only rolled his eyes. “Well be my guest and take a seat then.” Dean sat on the couch as Kari picked up the IV drop, grabbing the stack of cups from the minibar as he passed.
“I’m not a
Cas tried to roll his eyes again, and only succeeded in almost losing his grip on the counter behind him. Dean’s arm shot out to steady Castiel, grabbing his bicep as he swayed against the counter, eyes closing against his will. Cas may or may not have leaned heavily into Dean’s touch. If Dean noticed, he didn’t react.
“It’s Novak.” Dean smiled.
Cas smiled softly. “Yea, I guess you will.”
“And why would I do that?” the djinn interrupted.
Narrowing his gaze, Dean glanced at the couch on the farside of the room. He hated it, but the stupid Djinn was right. He could feel the desperation rising the longer he looked at the faded tattoos on Kari’s arm. “What do I have to do for more time?” Dean finally said, glare turning to point at Kari, who smirked.
“What?”
Cas looked at Dean in alarm, dropping his angel blade as the voice changed. “Chole!” it yelled. Chloe stepped backwards tripping on the log she’d been sitting on and landing on the ground.
“The fourth,”
He glanced east at the sunrise. The pink was receding as the sun rose off the horizon, causing the blue sky all around it to brighten in the most vibrant way.
“Dean, Dean, you can lie to yourself all you want about why you’re here, and you can keep clutching that pretty silver knife like it’ll change the 6 hours you just drove to follow me here.” Kari finally looked up as he pulled the IV cord out of his bag. “You can lie to just about anyone Dean. But you can’t lie to me. I’ve seen all of desperation’s faces and forms over the years, and kid, you got it bad.” Dean didn’t even respond. He just glared. Kari only sighed.
The last thing he heard before the wendigo knocked him out against the tree branch was Cas’s yell ringing out.
It all happened at once. Cas’s mouth began to open in a yell as Robbie broke out of the tree line, and as Dean sensed more than heard the break of a branch directly above him. It was too late. Dean felt his feet life off the ground.
a textbook to study for an exam? Wrong. If Castiel had to explain to one more person that “sorry we actually are all out of that textbook because it’s for a class that started sixteen weeks ago,” he was going to lose his damn mind.
He took a deep breath in, and his previous problems flew out of his mind. His pillowcase definitely didn’t smell like this. Pushing himself up slightly off the pillow, Cas took in the room around him. Slanted ceilings told him that he was on the top floor of someone’s rowhome. The windows were small against the walls, and the thin quilt he had kicked to the ground was a dark, faded army green. He began to panic, trying to think back to the events of the pervious night, when his eyes fell into the far corner of the room.
“Dean, are you sure everything is alright?” Instead of worry, Cas was doing his best impression of a puppy, eyebrows raised as if he already knew the answer to what he was asking.
“Yea man,” he clapped Cas on the back as he pulled away, “everything’s great.” He smiled at Cas with a dazzle which he was sure only further confused the man. But as Dean turned to get some coffee, he realized that he didn’t give a shit. That damn djinn had actually pulled it off.
more aggressive, lips more open, teeth grazing skin. Castiel had a distinct impression that Dean wanted to bite him. Biting Castiel would mean that he would hold Dean's mark.
think you can make our lives PG13?" Dean shook his head. "This is insane. What's the last thing you remember?"
"Well no, it would turn back into the wheel once he stops playing with it."
"But that's not all she wants," pressed Dean. "She wants . . ."
Castiel made a pained noise. He covered his face with his hands. Smelling he was wet was one thing but seeing it was
"They're brothers, in case you're interested," she said.
"Like...
Castiel looked over his shoulder at Dean, pausing in confusion.
It'll be OK, he thought to himself. Dean will know what to do.
, Castiel took it and with incredible ease, Dean hoisted him to his feet.
"How would a kid even play with it?"
"Dean," Castiel managed. He was struggling to concentrate. Dean smelled incredible.
"What?"
"Where's Sam and Cas, you bitch!" snapped Dean.

Castiel stood beside her, looking down at her. Her eyes panned from his navel, up his chest, his nipples, then his face. "Well, hello, gorgeous," she said. Even to Castiel's ears, it sounded false.
"What's up?" said Sam.
"You and Sam do!" insisted Daniel.

Panting, Dean stared up at the ceiling. "That was so fucking good," he said, closing his eyes.

"Yeah, yeah I know," said Dean, feeling twitchy.
"Ok, so how do we gank her?" said Dean, losing interest.
Daniel placed Dean, Sam and Castiel on the windowsill and stared at them. He adjusted the order so Dean and Castiel stood next to each other; Castiel would prefer that.
"Shut the hell up!" snarled Dean. He turned back to Cas, his expression still pained. "Cas," he murmured. "Do you want to be mine?"
"Where are we?" said Dean.
"No, it's not what you think. Yatiku
. "Oh, hello, Dean." He cleared his throat. "What can I do for you?" At Dean's answering smirk, Castiel amended, "Do you need any books today?"
. Sure, he had seen Castiel's softer side too when he was happy or sleepy. But he wasn't sure he had ever seen the look Castiel was giving him now. The blue of his irises seemed to hold depth that Dean

Mr and Mrs Green returned from the kitchen with snacks and mugs of coffee. Although they hadn't asked for them, the couple passed the drinks over, setting a plate of biscuits down in front of them. Dean cheerfully took his and started chomping on a digestive biscuit while Sam took the floor. Sam was better at dealing with emotional situations than Dean was.
"I've never tasted an angel," replied Castiel.
In spite of himself, Dean's lips twitched. "FYI? Cas was scarier."

They sat there together in silence; an angel and a hunter in a tiny cafe in the middle of England.
He knew without looking up that he had
"It's nothing," assured Dean.
Kay actually laughed at this. "It isn't my fault you have Castiel's dick on your mind. I have no interest in seeing you two get it on. It'd be like watching two apes ravage each other on the Discovery Channel.
Once upon a time, not so long ago, a monster came to the small town of Whittington Court, Hillchester. He killed a kid called Jimmy Green; cast hexes on high schoolers; stole money so he could drive a flashy car, and ate the last Strawb from Timothy Arkwright's pick'n'mix.

"Yeah, but we're grown ups. You're like five," said Dean.
"So you were in heaven," said Dean
They all looked over their shoulders to see the boy in the bed roll over in his sleep.
Yatiku would allow it. If it's a kid's toy it's got to be safe to swallow, right?"

Mrs Green shook her head slowly. "Nothing. He-he was a happy boy."
"And so can Dean," said Sam. "Dean can claim him now."
"You ok, Cas?" said Ellen, smiling at him.

"I love that you're my alpha," began Castiel.

"What?" he said with a squint. "What did you just call me?"
Castiel lips quirked into a small smile.
. And Castiel could sense it now.
There was a long pregnant pause. Dean and Sam appeared to be having a silent, wordless argument. Eventually Dean turned to Castiel. "Cas," said Dean. His voice had changed completely. It seemed to be much quieter, holding emotions Castiel didn't understand.
said to Castiel that he loved him would that be it? Would that be enough for Kay? He
"Right," said Dean. "Can you get us out of here Cas?"
Dean's heart swelled. "Yeah? Me too," he said softly.
Castiel stared at him. Why didn't Castiel say anything? Clearly, he had sensed that Dean was feeling him up a little. But he wasn't saying anything. He wasn't doing anything. Dean's heart was beating erratically. He wished Castiel would do something but he wasn't sure what he wanted Castiel to do. If the angel made a move to kiss Dean, would he deny him? Or would he accept it? Welcome it? Whether he wanted to kiss Castiel or not the fact remained that Dean was feeling pretty damn horny.
As a blue hand reached towards his face Dean decided that he didn’t give a shit, and his world again dropped into black.
“Oh yea it’s Castiel, sometimes Cas.” Cas stopped for a moment, shifting his eyes around as he thought. “Uh, For the past week I’ve had to break into my own apartment because my roommate dropped our key in a gutter?” He looked back to Dean who was smiling widely again.
“I said do it, or else I stab you and find another djinn around.”
“Yes, just transferred this semester.” Cas said, tapping his fingers against the countertop.
“Listen, if you really want my help, I’m gonna need some of the good stuff.” The djinn’s eyes travelled up and down Dean again, “Lucky for you, your got about 12 pints of it flowing through that warm meat suit of yours” gesturing towards Dean with his still open hands. “Since my batteries are drained, I’ll need at least a pint to even get you a glance through the door.” He raised his eyebrows at Dean, daring the man to give his answer.
MAE: (
SAM: Queer?
) Nice, no? I thought they should get to die like those demons they so worshipped.
SAM: You’ve been through a lot. Just take some time for yourself. To heal, okay? And tea with honey is gonna make your throat feel better. Experience.
But her voice is rough and strained, and trying to talk makes her wince in pain. Sam helps her sit up and half-carries her to the bed.
DEAN: What, Sammy?
DEAN: You’d be surprised what people who love each other are capable of.
DEAN: Shut the fuck up.
SAM: We really cannot say that, sir.
GIRL: Please… don’t do this…
with him, do you think you could be heteroromantic bisexual?
MAE: Well, usually not.
SAM: Uh, yeah. Julie’s parents told us that you started a… book club with Liza and Julie, is that correct?
MAE: See you.
DEAN: Again, you’d be surprised.
SAM: Yeah.
SAM: It’s only… Okay, yeah, sure. Good night.
It is clear that Sam was right when he said Ashley likes to hear herself talk.
DEAN: And what are you? Some kind of demon bitch?
CASTIEL: Hello, Dean.
The brothers are sitting around the kitchen table again, Dean drinking a beer, Sam with a salad in front of him. This time Dean has the laptop while Sam is looking at papers and maps.
FATHER: Nothing unusual. She went to school. Liza was here a few afternoons. Oh, and book club.
This shocks Dean for a moment. Sam looks at him, but Dean pointedly avoids his gaze. He recovers quickly.
DEAN: 17 year old girl disappeared in Akron, Ohio, and was found dead with all kinds of weird symbols on and around her. Newspaper says it looks like cult activity and a lot of locals reported weird things happening the days before. Sound up our alley?
SAM: You know what, forget it.
She wipes her eyes again and breathes deeply.
MAE: Oh. Um. Our user names. On the internet forum. (
SAM: You’ll be okay. And we’ll find what - who did this so they can’t hurt you.
SAM: That's weird. A devil's trap?
DEAN: (
ASHLEY: What is it? (
DEAN: What.
DEAN: Awesome. So that’s settled. I’m gonna get some sleep, then.
Sam nods, understanding.
MAE: Okay.
DEAN: Okay, what the hell
SAM: Yeah… look, okay, we’re staying in a motel not too far from you.
DEAN: Yes?
MAE: It’s not like the book club is gonna be happening anymore.
DEAN: Was she acting strange before she died?
He scrolls through the page and clicks links, his expression getting increasingly confused.
ASHLEY: That’s what I told them!
INT. JULIE'S HOUSE
SAM: Oh, yeah, that’s fair.
MAE: FBI officials have to stay in a

Dean slides into the backseat next to him and puts the grocery bag down on the floor.
MAE: Is this really relevant?
DEAN: And anyway, it doesn’t matter because I’m not gay.
SAM: Alright, okay, whatever. Have fun.
MAE: Thanks. (
SAM: (
DEAN: Right, you just sicced your little pet on them.
DEAN: I … you’re making this up.
DEAN: And you don’t believe me.
DEAN: And that’s why you
SAM: Can you tell us anything about this drawing?
DEAN: Uh, I’m not a drunk college girl, so no.
) Not as safe as a glock.
FATHER: Is that everything?
ASHLEY: Yes, of course. So tragic.
DEAN: Yep.
DEAN: Do you know if the vics knew each other?
It’s getting dark outside.
) I mean...  people get intense about it.
SAM: Huh. When did this start?
) Oh, hello.
Both of Julie's parents are sitting on a couch opposite Sam and Dean. They are holding each other and crying.
MAE: Wait.
) Maybe it’s not a demon or anything. Maybe it’s just some sort of lesbian love triangle drama.
SAM: You’ve evidently been meeting behind my back. Just ask him.
A sweet, sweet smile is frozen on her face. Not a hair on her head is in disarray, not a particle of her make up in the wrong place.
SAM: Uh, okay. So you weren’t angry at them?
They leave the room.
MAE: I am.
DEAN: Ugh.
The brothers are sitting in the car in silence. Music plays on the radio, Dean is driving. The silence is awkward and has been going on for a while. Finally, Sam clears his throat.
SAM: (
His fingers tense around the gun.
The decoration in this house is minimalist, with bare walls and white furniture; however, on the wall there is a cross, impossible to miss.

DEAN: Do you really think someone would be insane enough…?
EXT. FOREST - CRIME SCENE
MAE: (
) Well, yes. (
) Are you really not FBI?
SAM: That was a really smart thing you just did. I’m sorry you had to end up in this situation. But you handled it better than most people would have. Maybe that’s some comfort. (
SAM: Okay, that’s not…
MIKE: I swear, I didn’t mean to… I just did what she told me to...
DEAN: Maybe she did get possessed in the end? Maybe the devil’s trap was for
SAM: (
CASTIEL: Hello, Dean.
ASHLEY: To think that a few days ago I was still talking to them… And, oh, I wish we hadn’t parted in conflict… I just wish I could apologize and tell them I’m sorry. Oh...
DEAN: Look, okay, that was… I wanted a friend, okay? More than I wanted to get laid.
) She only told us she wanted to go for a walk. We told her to be careful and stay safe because, you know, and she said… she said we didn’t need to worry.
Behind them in the shadows, Ashley is standing and watching the scene.
EXT. FOREST
SAM: When you say you parted in conflict, what do you mean?
Sam frowns at him.
Dean is wandering through a gas station, a bag of groceries in his hand. He pauses in front of the magazines and reaches for a porn magazine with a woman dressed in a bikini on the cover.
) Oh. No. Fuck no.
Sam hesitates.
DEAN: Wait, what are those words next to the names? What’s, uh, “destiel1967”?
ASHLEY: Don’t talk to him, idiot.
SAM: Uh, what?
Dean laughs.
Mae frowns at him.
MOTHER: Oh, yes, that… she wanted to get it tattooed, she begged me for permission, but of course I told her no. Not in this house.
SAM: I’ll be there in a moment.
SAM: Uh, like… remember when we hunted that siren?
MAE: Wow, bad enough to get the FBI involved? What, is this, like, a serial thing?
DEAN: Uh, yeah it is.
Castiel takes off his trench coat and carefully drapes it over the back of a chair before turning to face Dean again. They look at each other for a tense moment. Then Castiel places a hand on Dean’s hip and pulls him close.
MOTHER: Thank you.
Mae makes a noise. Everyone in the room turns to look at her as she holds up her phone, whose screen says “Recording…”
SAM: (
your deal, though?
DEAN: Maybe that Julie girl was a hunter who told her about the symbols. To help her protect herself.
SAM: You three were really close, then?
) Just like in Supernatural...
DEAN: You asked!
DEAN: Did your club meet the day Liza was killed?
INT. POLICE STATION
SAM: We should definitely check out those people that got kicked out.
The interior of this house looks very different than the first. Instead of crosses and saints, the walls are mostly bare, painted light yellow, decorated with some pictures of scenery.
SAM: Uh…
INT. MAE'S ROOM
) I mean, it rarely is, to be honest. But it is worth something.
DEAN: Such a good idea.
) I told Liza so many times, she shouldn't do that, she needs to stop… but she insisted on turning away from Christ and letting the devil into her heart… and now… (
MAE: I’d have to be really stupid to go to the forest now.
He points to the anti possession symbol on the closet.
INT. MOTEL KITCHEN
DEAN: What? I’m not going around killing people for being gay.
MONSTER: Enjoy your trip to hell. Maybe you’ll see your friend there.
OFFICER 2: A runner, again. Not the same runner, mind you, but you know these woods are popular with the runners here.
) We were all so broken when we heard about Liza… We never thought… And now…
SAM: Hey. Uh, we’re looking for Mae Chen?
Dean, meanwhile, turns to Ashley.
MOTHER: She brought her here once and I told her to never let her visit again and to stop seeing her… Dreadful girl, always dressed like a boy… Between you and me, I’m sure that she dragged my girl into this… (
DEAN: The fuck is that?
) No, you want to stay here and rest.
SAM: His vessel may be, but his true self… Wait, don’t angels… not have genitalia? Does that apply too if they’re in a vessel?
Dean is alone in the room. He is lying on the bed, reading a newspaper.
SAM: Uh, no, just routine investigation.
MAE: I’m… scared. What if whoever did this is coming for me next?
FATHER: Not exactly.
She sits down on her daughter’s bed, crying, as Sam and Dean leave.
DEAN: What? It’s not like I’m in love with him.
DEAN: Alright, okay, you know what? This is none of your business.
DEAN: It stopped after like a second. Can you just check it?
SAM: Dean!
SAM: How about Sunday night?
MAE: Dead.
DEAN: Yes, yes, very tragic. Do you know where Julie was the night Liza was killed?
SAM & DEAN: Huh.
DEAN: Hello, Castiel.
SAM: Uh, okay. That's… yeah.
SAM: Over opinions on a book?
SAM: Do you think you could take us to the crime scene?
He goes back to staring out of the window. Silence fills the Impala again.
SAM: The anti possession symbol, yeah.
DEAN: So another dead end. Got anything else? Other than talking to the other two?
When he hears Sam’s voice, Dean’s eyes go wide with shock. He tries to push Castiel off him, but unsuccessfully - Cas reacts too slowly.
The parents look at each other.
MOTHER: I can show you her room.
) To Kill a Mockingbird. How is this relevant?
Sam raises his eyebrows and gives Dean a long look.
Sam is not making it up.
SAM: We are very sorry for your loss. Is it alright if we ask you some questions?
A girl is running in the dark among the trees. She is breathless and panicked, repeatedly looking over her shoulder.
SAM: Okay.
DEAN: Shut up. I’m serious.
SAM: Yeah, sure. You’ve said.
) I want to come with you!
We are in the forest again, though this time during the day. There are a lot of people standing around the tape that marks the crime scene: police officers, paramedics, journalists, locals.
SAM: I hate to say this, but you do realize that these are the kind of people whose side you’re on?
) And now this. Death seems to have it out for me.
Mae, on the floor, gasps for air. Sam rushes to her side while Dean continues to point his gun in the direction of the boy and Ashley.
DEAN: So. That explains the symbols in Liza’s room.
Suddenly there are steps outside the door.
DEAN: I’m afraid we can’t tell you any details about the investigation. Can we come in?
ASHLEY: I can give you my friends’ numbers, they’ll tell you it’s true. I would
SAM: That lured everyone in with sex? And it turned into a man for you?
MAE: What, you don’t think…
DEAN: Holy shit.
They kiss. This is clearly not the first time, but it’s not a romantic kiss; it’s wordless and rushed, there is a lot of unresolved tension in the way they touch each other. Dean pulls Castiel onto the bed and on top of him as they continue kissing.
But then another magazine catches his eye - HUNKY TRUCK FREAKS, with a muscular topless man on the cover.
There is no way to get up into the room from the outside, and there is no time to waste. Dean gets ready to kick in the front door, but to his surprise finds it open.
FATHER: I have no idea. Uh, I can give you her address if you’d like?
ASHLEY: I don’t know what you mean.
DEAN: That Ashley chick is definitely weird, but I doubt she’d be capable of anything like this.
SAM: So, you’re bisexual, then?
He frowns at the screen.
He writes two phone numbers down and gives them to Mae.
DEAN: Alright, okay. So what?
SAM: We are so sorry for your loss. If it's alright, we would like to ask you some questions about Elizabeth.
DEAN: Even more true for couples.
ASHLEY: I never hurt anyone.
A moment later, a teenage girl appears in the hallway. She has long, blond hair and wears make-up that makes her look several years older.
MAE: I guess there was this fight.
) They weren’t pure. They weren’t just talking about the book, but spreading an agenda… They were trying to convert everyone around them to their sinful way of living.
SAM: Uh, okay, enlighten me then.
MAE: You’re talking to her.
DEAN: Yeah, sure. I know angels, and you ain’t one of them.
Finally, a weak call for help is heard. A window on the first floor is lit - Mae's room.
SAM: I guess not.
DEAN: Would you like to put that theory to the test?
They turn back to her. She is speaking to Sam only now, without looking at Dean. She sounds quieter and less confident than before.
ASHLEY: A nice touch, was it not?
DEAN: Bye.
BOY: Yes, sir - I swear I didn’t mean -
It's dark outside now. The car pulls up and parks on the street in front of the house. Sam and Dean exit the car and run outside, shining a flashlight and yelling Mae's name.
SAM: Anyway, it’s not just about your body, but also how you identify and how you… hold on, there’s this illustration…
INT. LIVING ROOM
DEAN: Still worth checking out. Or do you have anything better to do tomorrow?
SAM: Yeah, we can go tomorrow.
Then, silence.
DEAN: Uh, he went out to get food. Should be back in twenty.
MOTHER: (
SAM: Are you okay?
SAM: Mae? Who is Mae?
MAE: Okay.

DEAN: Do you still have those drawings? Can you show us?
EXT. OUTSIDE JULIE’S HOUSE
SAM: Your colleague said there was a smell of rotten eggs at both crime scenes?
INT. MOTEL KITCHEN
) Okay.
Sam shrugs.
He closes the door. It takes a moment for what he saw to sink in. He opens the door again.
EXT. ASHLEY’S HOUSE
DEAN: And those… symbols you painted on them?
Castiel is sitting in the backseat of the Impala. The door on the other side opens.
DEAN: Witches? Their book club?
. He glanced at Castiel whose eyes had widened a fraction.
in jeans and a t-shirt. Her hair was thick, curly and tousled. Her light blue eyes were offset by the darkness of her skin.
The kid ran over to him and hugged him around the waist. He was bouncing off the walls with enthusiasm.
"Where are we going?" said Dean without much enthusiasm. All he could think of was getting his hand on his dick and having a nice slow tug but that wasn't about to happen anytime soon. Not unless he stopped off somewhere and q
Dean gritted his teeth and glared at Sam who could
At their usual table, Dean sat down and slung an arm over Castiel's shoulder. He kissed him on the side of the head while he listened to Sam talk about an unknown wolf that had crossed over onto their land the night before.
"Then get someone else to do it, lady," snapped Dean.
Somewhere in the distance, there were voices.
Castiel's face pinked. He didn't respond.
"No," said Kay. "You're doing it." Her tone was light and she was smiling but the threat was obvious.
For one moment Dean had to marvel at the excitement and absolute blind joy on Daniel's face. Complete and utter innocence.
looked up and it pulled another moan from Dean.
"It turns back into the wheel while it's inside him?! He'd get torn up. That's pretty dark, Sam."
Dean sat down on the bed which was so squishy he fell backwards. Flailing like a turtle on its back, he staggered to his feet and cleared his throat. "So, what? No case?" He flicked a glance at Castiel who wasn't watching him but his lips were curved into a surreptitious smile. Dean lightly punched his arm.
touchy alphas, Ruby was a good person to call.
"Jimmy?" said Daniel in disgust. "God no. I hate him. I was kind of glad he was gone at first. He used to make fun of my Captain America pencil sharpener ‘cause it looks like the pencil goes into his butt." He held up the sharpener in question and poked a pencil into it. Dean snorted. From the position of the print, Dean had to agree it looked as though America's mightiest hero was getting boned.
Castiel nodded. "I don't."
Dean held them together. He released Castiel's shoulder, licking and kissing what was sure to be a deep wound.
missing the point. I'm not gay. There is no gay or straight in heaven. There are only souls. They are beyond physical form. It is irrelevant what your body looks like, what genitals you possess," - Dean winced because a waitress had just passed by the table - "I love you. Besides, I don't choose to look at your physical appearance when I see you."
let yourself feel what you want to feel."
Feeling brave, Dean dared to slip a hand between their bodies and stroke Castiel through the material of his pants. Castiel dipped his head to watch Dean stroke him, then looked back into Dean's gaze. Castiel's eyes were dark, half-lidded and filled with need. Dean didn't doubt that his own face looked similar.
"Son of a bitch!" He spun around and Castiel had disappeared too.
Castiel lifted his hand to tap two fingers on his forehead as he always did. Dean reached up at the last second to catch his hand. He stroked his thumb over Castiel's warm palm moments before he was transported back to the cafe.
"Like, love, same difference," said Dean
Dean pushed down his pants and Castiel felt the unmistakable press of the head of Dean's dick against his asshole. Castiel inhaled sharply. Dean's scent was all around him. He could taste him on his tongue. He felt dizzy with it.
"Did you do it?" asked Dean. "Nothing's changed."
"Even so, I think its best if you leave your teacher alone," said Sam, smiling. "We'll take it from here."
"Yeah," agreed Dean. "I've had better. I didn't expect to get dragged from the grave to find out whether or not I batted for the other team."
"Jaguar S-type."
"You're saying he
Dean felt safe that he was able to explore touching Castiel this way without the worry of things moving too quickly or having to answer questions.
holding himself back for Castiel's sake.
Dean had to admit: he was a little tempted. Going hunting again
"How're you doing, Sam? Your brother not in tonight?" she asked as she slid him a beer.
Due to his tumultuous upbringing, Castiel behaved more wolf than human. As a result, he often found it difficult to understand social cues, slang terms and popular culture, choosing instead to use body language and instincts to communicate. Castiel understood that it was important to learn how to interact with his fellow humans. The pack had worked hard over the past year to encourage and educate Castiel on social interaction. Still, it was difficult for him.
"Nothing. . ." Dean felt a little helpless. "Nothing, I couldn't say anything."
"Let me guess, you brought us here?" said Dean.
Dean was aware he must have been looking at Castiel with the same intensity that Castiel usually reserved for him. He wanted to show Castiel some appreciation. He wanted to do something for him. Even if it was just a touch, anything. But he found himself questioning his own sexuality at the same time. He stood there, wondering, panicking, about what it meant. His heart was beating a little faster. He could feel warmth creeping up his cheeks. His breathing was coming in quicker.
Castiel's eyes slid to meet his. He must have sensed Dean's gaze. "Is everything OK?" asked Castiel.
"I can feel his pulse thumping away under my fingers. . .like a little bird flapping its wings."
Customers of Pulse had the option to go to the bar to order or wait at a table and
Sam snorted. "Dean," he said around a patronising smile. "Yeah. You're not straight."
"What you don't think we should? The bitch has got us on puppet strings."
"Nah, I'm good," said Sam.
"I love you too," said Castiel.
"Is he a friend of yours, Daniel?" asked Sam.
"You boys look lost," said a smooth female voice.
Castiel nodded.
Castiel's eyes tracked the movement and seemed to darken. "Believe me. I know."
"Hey," said Dean, his face turning into an expression Castiel didn't recognise, "you can go wherever you want, I don't want to stop you, just- I thought we said you'd try to stay human more often."
"Yes, Dean," said Castiel.
Castiel didn't subscribe to alpha, beta and omega dynamics. At least, not anymore.

Castiel considered him for a moment then said, "We're not in the real world," he said

"Fornicate," finished Castiel.
Dean shook his head in exasperation. "Man, I need food. Don't they do pie in England? Find me some pie, Sam."

"So you dragged us out of heaven?" said Dean.
in the face and angry with himself. He continued with what he was doing without acknowledging them.
Dean pulled out of the street with difficulty. He swung the Impala round once he was free of the tight street and breathed a sigh of relief.
Dean huffed a laugh and rolled his eyes. "You always know how to make a guy feel good. It was the bite. But to be honest, I wanted you so bad. I
"Wow," repeated Sam. "And still no counter."
Dean cleared his throat, "Right, yeah but I'm a guy, so that makes you-"
"I'm sorry," said Castiel, trying to pull his hand away but she held it tight. Generally, alphas were

Her grip on Castiel's wrist tightened and she twisted. Castiel gasped in pain, falling forward and catching himself so he didn't hit the table.
"Hm, while you're down there, Cas, could you. . .?"
"Lie on the bed," instructed Castiel.

"I'm eight," said Daniel with a pout.
"Are you ok?" said Dean
"I am attracted to you. I want sex with you,"
Dean thrust his hips roughly against Castiel's and Castiel could feel how hard he was underneath his pants. Dean spun Castiel around and slammed him onto the table. It was rough enough to hurt and Castiel could feel his cheek throbbing from where it had hit the table and was now pressed against the cold smooth surface of the wood. He loved how strong Dean was, how capable, and how easily he could break Castiel's neck should he wish to. Castiel's heart hammered inside his chest, his body thrumming with need. Dean's hand was gripping Castiel's hair, holding him against the table, as he kicked Castiel's legs apart.
"Of course I do," replied Sam. He looked up to meet Dean's eye. "I mean, I don't miss hunting exactly, but there are things I miss about it. I miss spending time with you."
couldn't control myself." He grinned,
. "Oh, fuck!"
I didn't get the whole show," he said. There was a long pause. "I'm guessing you and Cas, uh, worked some stuff out then?"
"Wait - Sam! SAM!" shouted Dean but Sam left without a word.

One minute the wheel is there and then it isn't. There's nothing else. I've checked earlier in the day and later too."

"If you don't bite him, I will," said the woman.
"Uh. . ." began Dean.
and his breathing harsh.
"He's not a demon," said Daniel immediately.
"What? I can tell you're into him. His brother
Dean chuckled, falling back into conversation with Sam.
it was because if it didn't happen in the real world, any mistakes (if there were any) could be undone.

Dean felt his jeans pop open and it was a relief to finally get his dick free. Dean stared, lips parted, as Castiels lips enveloped the head of his cock and sank down.

Castiel rubbed his palm over the ridge of his hard cock where it
"Chaos?" Dean looked at Castiel. "Does that sound right?"
"Suck me off, Cas," panted Dean, trying to restrain himself from pushing Castiel's head down. Castiel's fingers had
Castiel didn't move. He didn't appear to be breathing either. Dean wondered if he had forgotten as Dean had. His soft blue eyes were studying Dean's face. Dean let him look.
"What's a kid that age doing watching us?" said Dean. "I mean I know we started early but wow. Kid must have a strong stomach."
still defined. His lips were exquisite, his hair was a dark golden brown, and his skin was smooth and sunkissed. His eyes were very expressive, Castiel noticed. He guessed they would be easy to read. He was. . . beautiful.
A breeze fluttered by. Dean could smell the sweet scent of grass on the warm air and hear the distant sound of tree branches moving in the wind. Leaves flew around their feet dancing past Dean's ankles over to Castiel who was stood next to him, looking up.

"This isn't hell," said a deep voice to his right. A deep, gravelly, voice that could only belong to. . .

Castiel blinked.
"Sure, " said Sam. He gave Dean and Castiel an awkward look then nodded and slid away, back to their table.
Sam seemed to sense this too. "Dean, you're
. Castiel found himself stealing glances at him from across the room. On one occasion Dean caught his eye and Castiel saw him smile
Dean sighed. "Nothing."
They took a moment in silence together while Castiel's breathing eased. Then Dean made a disapproving sound in the back of his throat.
"So, Dean's finishing that off then he's coming over," said Sam to Ellen. He noticed Castiel next to him and squeezed the nape of Castiel's neck. Although Sam was an alpha he had never made a move on Castiel. Even when Castiel was in heat, it hadn't occurred to Sam to pursue him though it must have been hard to deny his instincts. In werewolf society, he would have been well within his rights to attempt to bed Castiel since he was the second alpha in the pack and Castiel technically hadn't been claimed. Dean still hadn't bitten Castiel to claim ownership. However, the respect Sam had for Dean ran much deeper than wolf instincts and he would never touch Castiel. It was probably for this reason that the Winchester pack was able to maintain two alphas.
Castiel nodded he lifted his hand to touch Dean's forehead. Before he reached him though, Daniel was tugging at Dean's sleeve.
"Hey, it's ok." Dean put his hands on Castiel's shoulders.
say I'm a fan of the show
Castiel heartbeat sped up but this time it wasn't due to arousal. "You mean. . . you think I'm your mate," said Castiel, his head spinning.
Dean's lips parted and he clamped down onto the curve between Castiel's neck and shoulder and sank his teeth in.
"No," said Castiel
Sam's eyebrows shot up. "Wow."
"Then how do you know you like guys?" said Dean.
From the corner of his eye, he saw Jo approach the table. Feeling safe to look up without
Castiel wasn't listening at all now. He wondered, idly, when Dean would fuck him again. Castiel had loved it last night when Dean had pinned him against the wall so tightly that he had barely been able to breathe as he had fucked him raw. Heat pulsed in his cock at the memory.
"Hey."
"You're not going to be able to stop this, Ellen."
"I'm not

he didn't have the wheel after all."
roughly,
"In your mind." Castiel reached across the table and touched Dean's forehead. There was a brief moment of complete darkness then he opened his eyes.
"Shut up, Sam," grumbled Dean.
Pulse was quiet for a Thursday afternoon. The club only had a few betas and one or two alphas. Castiel knew it would get busier later (it always did) but he enjoyed the quiet while it lasted.
"It would, yeah," said Sam. "I've told him that but Dean's pretty protective of him, you know? I think he wants Cas to love him first before he makes a claim. He doesn't want to bite Cas just because it's instinct for Cas to want it."
"I thought we agreed you'd try to stay human when we're at the bar?" said Dean.
Even from where Castiel was standing he was able to feel Dean's anger pouring off him in waves. The Roadhouse had fallen completely silent. Dean stepped in close, glaring down at her with carefully controlled rage. "You need to back off bitch before I rip your spine out."
Dean Winchester opened his eyes. The first thing he noticed was his own body weight. Gravity. He hadn't felt real for a long time. A real, solid human being. Heaven had a way of making you feel as though you were living somewhere between reality and fantasy. He had been asleep, dreaming, and now he was awake.
Dean's shoulders slumped. He nodded.
, as always, in a leather jacket, jeans and a shirt. Castiel had to admit he was a little disappointed Dean hadn't shown up in his wolf form.
. "Bobby said he saw you." Dean couldn't understand why his heart was beating faster.
A touch to the forehead and Dean and Castiel were back in their room at the bed and breakfast.
Once he'd finished eating he debated getting up and leaving but he decided not to. An awkward conversation was coming. Whether it was now or later it was going to happen. There was no sense putting off the inevitable. He peeked at Castiel who thankfully wasn't watching Dean. In all the years Dean had known Castiel, it had taken him this long to learn that Dean didn't like to be stared at. And yet as the thought crossed his mind, he realised how much he actually enjoyed Castiel's quirks. There was also something in the way that Castiel looked at Dean that he liked. It was as though Dean was very important or interesting and Dean had never felt that way about himself. Then again, maybe it was just Castiel's confusion that made him look like that. Castiel always seemed to walk around with a permanent look of bewilderment. It always made Dean smile.

Castiel's eyes slowly lifted from his navel to his chest, up his neck, his lips then, finally, his eyes. "I...what?" said Castiel vaguely.
send us back? Enough with the games. Send us back. I'm not doing this."
There was something in Castiel's tone, the depth of it, that made Dean go quiet.
Castiel stood back behind Sam to sniff the air and have a quick glance at who was in the bar. It didn't take a wolf's nose to know that there were more humans than werewolves just by the number of jeans he could see. Jeans were not a popular choice for wolves as it made it difficult to shift from human to wolf in tight denim. That being said, Sam and Dean seemed to enjoy wearing them. Castiel imagined it had something to do with confidence in their own strength while they were still human.
"You've been separated from him for a long time, that means he no longer belongs to you," said Sam.
Sam pulled Dean out of the bedroom.
. It was perverse and Dean loved the fact Castiel was staring at him while he sucked him down greedily.
"No," growled Castiel. "
Dean's brows drew together. He hadn't realised that Castiel would be having a difficult time too.
Daniel stepped back. He took one long look at them then turned and got back into bed. The three figures were the last thing Daniel saw before he drifted off to sleep.
"A flashlight? The blue one? That's mine you, idjit! I wondered where that had got to!" exclaimed Bobby.
"Because it is of no importance," said Castiel.
Dean's expression was still open in disbelief. "Latent? what does that mean?"
"Oh! That's my mum. You can stay for breakfast if you like?" said Daniel, his eyes shining with hope. "I bet my mum would like to meet you."
like Daniel. And quite
on the case. Castiel was becoming a huge distraction for him. Wherever he looked, whatever he did, Castiel was at the forefront of his mind. He started to notice things about the angel that he hadn't noticed before like his hands, his jaw, his lips, his hair. He started imaging Castiel in situations that grew
"Your face," said Dean, stroking Castiel's cheek which was tender under Dean's fingers. He winced. "I'm sorry, Cas, I got a bit carried away. I couldn't control myself."
he had stared. It was impossible not to. Dean had given him an answering lascivious smirk that was hard not to smile at.
It was frustrating.
"Nothing," he said finally. "I'm fine. Go ahead."
. It might have had something to do with the fact that Castiel was an omega. There wasn't a lot of respect granted to omegas.
It was the most Castiel had spoken in perhaps his whole life but he had felt it had been important to tell Dean this. Dean had to know what Castiel made him feel.
He ignored her cryptic response. "Is that what you're into? Are you watching us all the time? It's a kink isn't it?" he asked, attempting to get a rise out of her. Secretly he was thankful he hadn't decided to knock one out over Cas if she
"He's still all wolf, isn't he?" Castiel heard Ellen say to Sam.

Castiel blinked, unsure what to say. He knew what he wanted to do but he was almost certain it wouldn't be a good idea to smell her neck without permission.
"Let him go, Meg."
"Apple pie?" said another waitress in a tone that suggested she couldn't care less about apples or pie.
"But how do you know?" Dean licked apple sauce off his spoon.
Dean leaned in close and Castiel flinched, trying to back up.
to be intelligent," drawled a female voice.
"I'm not sure," said Castiel. "Gods and goddesses usually have an obsession of some kind. We should consider what she wants in order to work out what she is."
It didn't help that they were all crowded around a tiny table with tiny chairs and Dean could feel Castiel's knees against his.
"But I can't change. . ." said Castiel.
stronger than omegas. Castiel didn't have a hope of escaping her grasp.
when Dean had sauntered up to him, leant against the desk and gave him a grin.
"England?" said Sam, oblivious to the unspoken communication passing between them.
. He imagined it all and yet... the reality of it was quite different. He couldn't imagine doing it for real. As a result, he and Castiel were at an impasse.
"Of course," said Castiel, as though this was obvious.
"I could tell he got your rocks off when he said that," she said, gazing out of the window at the passersby who, Dean suddenly noticed, had frozen in time.
"Uhh," came a voice above them. It was Sam. Bobby and Ellen were peeking out from behind the bar like two soldiers taking cover in a trench. "So I guess we're not playing pool tonight?"
. She placed the plate down in front of him and he beamed, snatching up the spoon beside it.
Dean stared at him. "Was that your version of a

Yatiku's wheel instead."
Castiel hesitated, he sat back down.
They were stood beneath a night sky but it wasn't one Dean had ever seen before. It stretched above them, enormous and magnificent; a melody of colours from blue to purple to black; a backdrop for planets and stars,
