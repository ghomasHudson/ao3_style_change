Dean finds himself smiling wryly. “Well, looks like that’s sorted then, yeah?” He nods his head towards the door, and Lucifer reluctantly turns to leave. As he walks out, the man and Cas share a look. Dean’s pretty sure he just witnessed attempted murder from Castiel.
Cas squeezes his eyes shut, feeling sick. His fists flex, unsure whether he wants to punch the wall or scream.
"Your Honor, if I may—lifting Jack so crudely from his current living environment, especially during such a crucial time in his development when there is in fact nothing wrong with it--"
"Cas?" Chuck finally questions. "Castiel?" He chuckles. "He wasn't worth the energy. Never knew ambition if it stared at him right in the face."
"Man, and I thought my family was messed up." Dean breathes. And then he laughs. Cas looks at him in surprise.
I just wanted to take this moment to thank a few people. Firstly, thanks to MalMuses for always being vigilant in reading my chapters and flailing over feelings. You've been a huge motivator in helping get this done <3
Castiel stands beside him, and Dean silently motions for him to join him. Quietly, Castiel jumps onto the hood, and they sit on the hood of the impala, shoulders pressed together. They quietly look out at the sunset, comfortable silence falling between them.
They’re wandering around the edges of the Quidditch pitch. Sam is staring with some nostalgia at the seats for the audience in the stands. It wasn’t often that he got to visit Hogwarts, and even less that he got to visit the Quidditch pitch, even with Dean working there.
Castiel presses on. He closes his eyes, feeling the echo of movement from somewhere around the corner. He presses himself to the edge of the wall. He pauses, raises his wand, before peering around the corner.
Dean opens his mouth to rebuke her, but is interrupted by the sight of the Potions Master sweeping into the Great Hall, making his way to the front. Crowley stands to the side of Bobby and Chuck, and places a hand on his hip, scanning the crowd.
Dean stares at Cas, who, with a reluctant look at the referee,then at Jody, turns and heads back into the changing rooms.
Lucifer siphons easily through the wave, flames licking weakly at the ground around him. He looks up to find the staff of Hogwarts surrounding him, poised.
Chuck eyes the glass almost warily, but doesn’t reach for it. This was by far not the first time he’d been in the Headmaster’s office, but he still spends a few minutes gazing around at all the portraits, mouth open in an awestruck manner. Bobby waits patiently for Chuck to turn his attention back to him; again, this was rather a regular occurrence. Frankly, he found the portraits annoying after a while. Apparently being Headmaster also meant no privacy.
Dean had numerated for some time while driving up here; this man had killed his mom, his dad, and nearly killed Sammy. He taught Lucifer
“Uh— yeah.” Dean acknowledges, rather glumly. He makes note somewhere in the back of his mind about Michael's behaviour. “Not exactly about me, though. I was, going to ask a favour — I know you’ve saved my life and everything, but I know you’ll do a good job—”
“Lucifer came into the picture not long after Kelly passed away, tried to claim his son, but he was interred very shortly after doing that. But…he’s recently been released.”
?" Dean finally croaks, surprising himself. Most of the staff body whip their heads around to him, thrown by the aggressive town at the Headmaster. Bobby is unperturbed, but sighs.
They both glance out of the window, where the happy shrieks of a dozen six year olds ring around the garden.
Sam takes a seat. There is an agonising silence as Crowley leans forward, picks up his teapot, and pours tea into a fine china cup only for himself. Sam and Dean look at each other. Castiel and Sam glance at each other.
Cas shrugs with one shoulder, because of course he knew he was already there. "Jack was very insistent that I catch it."
Dean is a bit lost, to say the least, and it's at least a minute that passes before he realises that he's still stood in the doorway, staring like some idiot. Eventually he shakes his head, and curiosity outgrows his need for sensibility.
"Oh?" Ellen questions, flipping the burger with a nonchalance that only comes from years of muscle memory. "How were they?"
“No, this is just a bonus.” She muses, her own wand lowering to point at Castiel. Cas dares to let his eyes glance around their surroundings. She was stood on top the carcass of brick, giving her the high ground. The Alley was quickly emptying, people disapparating or running to floo powder stations. “He saved me because I’m loyal. And he wants you
Lucifer is the real father. He turned up here when I wasn’t home and my sister was babysitting, and--”
They stand side by side in silence for a few minutes, looking over the lake. The lake surface is still, the moon shimmering at them from the water. Dean wonders when he walked into a poem.
Thank you for reading, and you get extra bonus points for guessing the references for any of the chapters ;)
"Jody?" Dean calls out, just as a precaution. He rounds the landing only to come to a stop at the doorway into the dining room, where he comes to the stop at the sight of someone sitting at it. He blinks as recognition falls.
Other wizards dressed in scrubs hurry by him as he winds down the corridors of the hospital. When he reaches the correct floor, a gentle looking male approaches him. Dean tries hard not to think of Cas.
The gentle sounds of public movement filters through the single pane window. Dean squints, his surroundings unfamiliar until the half finished cream paint on the walls falls into place, and his eyes settle on a frame, movement shuffling within it in a constant loop. A younger version of Sam and he, jostling each other with stretched cheeks and skin that didn’t quite know how to settle itself on their bones and muscles.
Cas only realises that Dean is staring at him when his gaze finally rests back on his, and he blinks. Dean glances away quickly for a moment.
Dean pulls up to some old warehouse in the middle of God-Freaking-Nowhere. There's no one around except for a mildly surprised security guard staring at the Impala with some level of awe. Dean decides this guy alone gets a nine on the respect rating
His partner, Kaia, glares at Jack utterly unimpressed. With no fanfare she throws his arm over her shoulder, and they wander off into the castle. Dean turns to the rest of the class. He starts to grin.
"Thank you for tonight, Dean," Cas murmurs, and Dean glances down at him. They'd never quite stood this close before, and it only really clicks with him now how Cas is
John never would have approved of suits or black clothing. He never would've approved of grand funerals or fanfare. It's not really like they had the money to do so, anyway.
Castiel nods, and they walk. Dean shrugs. “You shouldn’t need to be the one to apologise for his behaviour, anyway. That’s his job.”
“Hey,” He grins, taking a step forward, but falters when he realises that the rest of the crowd have also turned their eyes on him, seventh year boys included. He blinks.
Castiel pushes open the door to the Gas N’ Sip as he makes his way to his car. The can of whatever off brand energy drink he could grab from a shelf hisses as he pulls on the tab, and he takes a swig of it. He places it atop his car once he approaches. Castiel leans against the door handle and sighs. That run in with Jack's teacher was the last thing he needed to concern his thoughts right now. He’s not sure himself why he acted so abruptly. Maybe it would be easier if Mr. Winchester — Dean, was it? — knew about it. It was a little presumptuous to think that Dean
“There are many ways Dark Wizards and Witches come to power, class.” She starts writing on the board. “Often they have to be a Master Wizard. One cannot afford Justice if one does not know the secrets upon how to avoid it in the first place.”
Castiel tilts his head, a little amused. "I didn't say anything. I just remember walking into Jody's dining room once and finding you, outside of your work hours, sat helping Jack with an assignment
Dean drives up the mostly overgrown driveway, eventually coming across the farm house. It hadn't been painted in years, but it was clearly lived in—just a little faded. With a bitter taste, he realises it reminds him of Bobby’s.
He glances briefly to the side, where in front of the Student selective there is a girl that Dean vaguely recognises from Quidditch matches staring wide eyed at her own name. Her fists are clenched and some students are prodding at her. She’s trying not to break down.
Eileen is outside; that’s apparent. Secondly, the distinct sound of sirens wail in the background, accompanied by the ambient noise of a neighbourhood having tumbled out from their homes in the middle of the night.
“Minister Shurley?” Sam affirms. Michael nods. “I imagine it’s in regard to the letter in your hand.”
Cas turns slowly to look at Dean. His is gaze impossibly stoic. “Because he wasn’t trying to take over the Ministry.”
Cas seems to fall silent. Dean rubs at the side of his jaw in thought. "Uh, I'm sorry to hear that. Did you… wanna talk about it?"
Dean growls, sluggish. Lucifer sniffs. He drops him, and Dean lands head first on the concrete floor.
"Anyone home?" Dean calls out. Ellen is standing with her back to him, hovering over a grill. Jo is tucked in some corner, wielding a knife against some vegetables. He thinks twice about making her jump. Dean smiles. "Hey. How're the girls doing back here?"
“Unfortunately Michael prefers to only take jobs that end up with him looking like he has nothing to be sorry for.”
Slowly, he turns to look at Cas, his features mostly hidden in shadow. The moon manages to brush the outline of Castiel’s nose, drawing a gentle line around the edge of his cheek, stroking the exposed collarbone before it nestles under a Gryffindor scarf.
The snitch and Cas nearly meet, before it flies out of Cas's reach and flutters up, near Dean. Dean leans down, feeling the breath rush out of his lungs as he swoops down to try and meet it halfway. In his peripheral, he sees Cas flying up towards him.
Jack jumps in the doorway and runs about his knees. “Oh! Hello Mr. Winchester! I didn’t know you’d be coming too!” Jack careers into the house with the optimism of a child who knows exactly who he’s looking for.  “Claireeeeeeee? Where are youuuuuu?”  His voice disappears, into the house. Jody’s voice calls after him.
Samandriel peers over with some curiosity as Cas takes the quill out of their hands, opening the front cover and scratching something on the first page. Cas closes it before he can see, folding the book underneath his robes.
“Can I interest you in our Valentine’s--” He starts his mantra as he straightens, only to stop when recognition hits him upon seeing this man’s face. He blinks.
“Uh. Thanks.” Dean mumbles, and leads him back to his car, parked at the kerbside at the end of the path. He opens the passenger door for Cas, waiting until he slides in. Castiel brushes by Dean as he does so, and he can smell the mix of sandalwood, leather and mint that makes up Dean’s cologne (and chewing gum, apparently) as he sits down. He forgets all his creeping concerns about neighbors peering into this moment of his. The door closes beside him and a moment later Dean slides in. He starts the ignition and the Impala purrs to life. Dean glances to his side with a grin, cheeks still tinged.
Cas just looks at him, somewhat darkly. He downs the rest of the drink. Charlie and Dean just stand there, as though waiting for Castiel to just drop there and then on his face. Castiel looks between them some bemusement.
Castiel nods. "It was meant to put me through school. I served, and once my tour was done I'd be able to go."
Jack blinks, then looks down at the table. He grabs at the piece of paper to wave it at Dean. "Homework! But it's... it's hard..."
As they circle each other Lucifer turns his head, looking straight at Dean. He raises an eyebrow. With a casual flick of his wrist, a spell surges towards him, and Dean raises his wand in anticipation, mouth trying to form the words--
The purr of the Impala pulls up at exactly 7pm, and Cas restrains himself long enough to wait until there's a knock on his door.
“Come on, Jack,” Castiel urges, calmly wiping some of the tears from his cheeks. “You have to tell me, otherwise I can’t help you.”
Lucifer pulls his arm back and Castiel lurches for another punch to his temple—Lucifer ducks his head and it largely lands through his hair, but Cas immediately jabs him in the face. Lucifer’s nose explodes with blood.
Castiel nods, and a small but uncomfortable silence settles in around them. He distracts himself by taking time to glance round the room. It wasn't luxurious by any means; just a simple diner with some pokey decorations. It was due for a repaint, and the furniture was clearly outdated and in dire need of replacement.
To start off the week, there will be a ball to celebrate the start of the challenge, with the selected champions as the honoured guests for the occasion. We will also be taking opportunity to visit your lessons and other activities.” Minister Shurley smiles, before fumbling with the pieces of paper he had placed on the lecturn. He tucks them away in his robes. “Uh, thank you for your time. I hope you have a great rest of your week.”
Jack gives a dutiful nod, before leaning forward, gripping the pencil he was carrying super tight and carving at the paper, tongue sticking out from concentration. Dean has to refrain a slightly amused smile. Kids were kind of adorable, when they weren't screaming at him or each other.
It's not often that Dean finds himself fast asleep in a place that is not his own—once he'd gotten used to the apartment that Sam and he had moved in together Dean had immediately done what Sam had dubbed as
. Jack grew up without his mother." His voice breaks. "And now you're depriving him of his father, too."
The snitch has swooped near towards the bottom of the pitch, by the referee. Cas is inches behind it, stood on his broom, hand outstretched.
There is tense silence as spells are thrown across the room. Dean finds himself dodging far more than he’d like for something that is not a Quidditch match, but he manages to stay on his feet. They step closer and closer, and at one point, Cas laughs when he catches Dean off guard, nearly teetering off the platform.
“Oh, I’ll probably have to take the trip back down to London, but being part of the Ministry and part of the Minister’s entourage, apparition is thankfully allowed. So I should be around for most of the events.”
on leaving her door unlocked, but anyone dumb enough to enter the sheriff's premises unannounced probably deserved it.
Chuck stands before the desk, fidgeting for a moment. He eyes the parchment, before hesitantly taking his seat. “Do you not use a charm to let the quill scribe for you? I mean - I always found it a pretty cool trick, being able to do that, I mean.”
Anna pulls Jack through a door on the right of the landing, giving one last look at Castiel before she closes it.
“Sam and Professor Singer took him out while we were dealing with Lucifer. It appears he’d been under the Imperius curse. I’m unsure just how long but… it’s considerable.”
Dean glances down sometime later while he’s balancing on his broom to the side of the pitch, observing the game. He looks with some surprise that he sees Kaia returning, with Professor Mills in stride with her. He motions to the class to continue their practice, and he glides down to where Jody is. He steps off the broom in pace to join her at the bottom, broom grasped in his hand.
son,” Castiel spits. “And part of it is because I know how to deal with a manipulative, lying bastard like you. This is my last warning, or I call the police. Get.
"Hey, looking for the storage container for John Winchester?" He slaps down some ID documents, for good measure.
Jody’s smile tightens for just a second, before she pats at Claire’s shoulder and straightens up. “Well, winning isn’t everything. It’s an important lesson we must all lear—”
“Did we ever find Chuck?” Sam asks, breaking the silence. The proceeding silence that follows has Dean gripping at the bedpost, irritation clawing at his jaw.
He turns back to the small crowd just as they all step back, Cas sighing loudly. He looks round and catches Dean staring at him. Something in the back of Dean’s mind tells him he should at least try to look away.
He watches carefully as all the students take off, do their circuit around the pitch, and then return to the line. Some are better than others. A few miss their mark completely, flying past their partner, and one falls off the broom before it stops moving, and he lands face first in the grass. It flies off into the wall, breaking in half. Dean sighs.
They stare each other down a moment longer, before Michael glances to Castiel. He pulls his robe to himself. "We'll continue this conversation later, Castiel." He turns on his foot, and strides out of the hall.
“Sure, I’ll just go and ask the Dementors and Dark Wizards to politely leave, next time. I’m sure that’ll fill them with fear and the students with utter confidence.”
Sam laughs in delight, hopping off of Dean and bounding to the kitchen, shoving the coat hanger that he'd draped with his coat into Dean's face. While Dean attempts to wrestle with the various limbs of the hanger, Sam is tapping urgently away at his phone. Dean's stomach swells in fear—flustering him and lowering his defences against the coat hanger.
Dean frowns and for the first time, struggles to swallow. He’s not sure he’s ever heard Cas say those words.
A groan rolls from most of the class, but the familiar shuffle of books being put into bags and chairs scraped under desks proceeds anyway. He wonders why there is such pause as they leave until he looks up at the open door to see Dean stood there, staring into the room. He wonders how much Dean heard of the conversation.
"Yes," Cas notes. He tightens his hold on the bag he's carrying and shuffles past. Dean watches him go for a moment, forgetting to close the front door. He briefly wonders, again, how Cas and Jody know each other.
Cheers roar across the stands, colours of red and yellows flickering along the stadium. Dean grins as he marches across the pitch, the rest of his team behind him. It was the closest they’d come to winning the cup since he became Captain.
!” He yells, as the male falls onto one knee from the effort. The hurricane lasts for only a few moments before it drops, a counter spell freezing it almost mid-gale. The hurricane shatters, splintering the shield with hundreds of shards of ice. Dean manages to throw up a repulsion spell in front of him, watching as the ice melts, soaking the ground and his clothes in the process.
similar manner with no identity attached to the arsonist — then on the last page written, was his name, in big letters — and circled underneath, another.
"Ah. The ‘father’, come to find his prodigal 'son'." He even does the finger quotes. Castiel's expression is pure death.
Sam rolls his eyes, and pulls out another letter—signed, from Crowley. He puts the two pieces of handwriting next to each other.
Within a minute the assault begins to slow, debris piling at bottom of the shield around him. A slow haze of dust rises around him from the plaster, and he slowly crawls to the edge of the shield, wondering why he couldn’t see them any longer - and then he stops.
Fun fact: A decent portion of this chapter was written at a cafe called The Elephant House, which is where JK Rowling wrote a substantial amount of the Harry Potter books. Yes, I felt like such a nerd doing it. Yes, I was absolutely geeking out.
Despite the ominous tone of the conversation, Dean can't help but smile a bit to himself. "Sure thing, man. I'll be there."
Dean pulls up in his usual spot just beside the driveway, cutting the ignition off only after the song he's currently listening to finishes.
Cas smiles at him, and Dean feels warmth bloom in his chest. He places his hand over Dean’s, for just a moment. “Thank you, Dean. I… appreciate it. Truly.”
They stop and stare at him. The bigger guy turns and nods his head to one of the others, who then scarpers off down the corridor—towards Jack's bedroom.
. You too?” Sam comments, in disbelief. Sam presses his back against the shield, wondering if he’ll end up falling through it somehow. “Come on -- this isn’t you.” He raises his own wand in preparation. Michael was making no motion of slowing down, eyes narrowed, focused on him. Sam can only watch him as he approaches. Something was wrong.
They sit like this in silence for a few minutes, before Cas sighs, long. He pulls out an envelope that had been tucked under his arm, placing it under the coffee table.
“But what if they come for us, too?” A girl in the back pipes up, her voice wobbling. A few concerned murmurs pass themselves along the classroom. He frowns.
“Dean?” Are the first words that come out of his mouth, and Dean actually freezes as a delighted wave crashes on him so forcefully he feels dizzy. He manages to step forward.
Cas halts a few paces behind him but makes no motion to turn him around. “This isn’t Sam’s fault, I—”
He feels Jack watch him for a few moments, before he protectively nurses his truck under his arm while trying to pick up the Lego with one hand. Cas has swept a path to him just as Jack starts debating whether he needs to give up his truck for the sake of tidiness. He doesn't seem happy about it.
Dean raises one shoulder. "Hey now, don't put yourself down. Nearly knocked me out in the game the other day."
"Could ask the same thing." Sam replies grumpily, frowning down at him. Dean relents his attempts to push free of the moose of a man, and so he drops his arms with a sigh. He can't look at him.
Castiel finds himself standing outside Jack's bedroom, staring. The sheets had been tossed to one side, mattress covering ruffled at where Jack had clearly grasped to try and stop being pulled away from his bed by some stranger.
Castiel shrugs. "He picks up on things even if they're not being said. Most children are like that." Castiel glances at him. "You should know that by now."
Dean blanches. “I got enough on my plate already. I don’ wanna step on his toes more than I already have—”
Dean stands behind the bench, looking out at the various children rolling in the grass and causing an unending tirade of grass stains that would take the next decade to get out. It could be worse.
He and the other body mass tumble onto the living room floor, scrabbling for purchase; it only takes a few moments for Dean's muscle memory to settle on the mass of long limbs and exerted grunts.
The whole stadium is fit to bursting, despite it being a very overcast day. Dean had been out a lot in the quidditch pitch, so it wouldn't surprise him if it was going to start raining later. They
"This journal belongs to a recently deceased person, of whom the cause of death is suspicious. There are dubious links of Lucifer's involvement to this 'Azazel'. In light of Lucifer's recent release from prison, this hardly looks like good standing for Lucifer to be in place of custody, does it not?"
Feeling light, Dean asks Cas after the practice has finished whether he wants to join him for a drink at the Three Broomsticks. Cas, red-faced and eyes bright from the match, nods at him with a smile.
The walls crunch and Castiel has less than a second before the plaster erupts behind him. He throws himself face first to the ground, hoping that the water has done its job and doused out the rest of the fire.
Dean wanders through to the kitchen, where Bobby is hunched over a small saucepan. By the smell he is reheating some beans. Dean leans against the doorframe.
Alastair raises his wand, and Castiel’s muscles explode in pain, vision ringing white. He feels the cobblestones hit his knees as he crumples. He curls, deaf to his own screams.
forgiven him yet for the whole not-telling-him-about-Dad thing. He estimates it'd take some awful practical joke and then Sam will be satisfied. The joke hadn't come yet, so Dean was trying to not feel too paranoid about it.
"SAM!" She yells, and against her better instinct, begins to charge up the stairs towards the bedroom.
"Ladies and Gentleman," Chuck announces, wand pressed to his throat in an amplifying spell. His voice wavers as he tries, unused to the effect of the volume. "I - I hope you're ready for a great competition!"
"As much as I enjoy you wanderin' into my house to drink my beer, I know you got plenty at home." He pauses. "What are you doin' here?"
Chuck stares at him. Eventually, he reaches out, hand in a tremor, to the glass of whiskey. He downs it in one go, and slams it back down on the desk. “I-- I - you shouldn’t be making such… lewd assumptions, Headmaster. I’m perfectly fine. It’s the students welfare I’m concerned about. That’s all.”
“Alright kids, we got ourselves a match. Professor Novak and I are going to be the Seekers on either team. Claire, seeing as you need to save yourself, you can referee. I’m trusting you with this, alright?” He says, throwing her the whistle. They juggle with it in surprise, but run off with a small
Crowley holds up a finger to Dean with a frown. Crowley finishes his sip, takes forever to place his cup down, then smiles at them. He places his feet on his desk.
in the room even from what is probably a half concussed state. Then the thought slams into his mind, and terror overtakes
He throws himself off Meg as Lucifer raises his wand and Cas charges towards Dean – only to go diving to the ground again as a hand grabs his ankle. He throws his arms out and clutches Dean’s waist as he falls, bringing the Winchester down with him. They land on each other with a thump, and the killing curse goes sailing over Dean, dispersing against one of the stands which begins to crumble. Students start screaming.
When Cas looks up at Dean, his expression is notably softer. He stills says, "You didn't need to do that. I should be--"
“Dementors aren’t to be trusted, and should never have been allowed so close to the grounds… but why they approached merely you is unusual, as opposed to doing so during a match or training. The Headmaster will need to know what happened.”
“If you’re here to bemoan the fact that the Dementors made yet another interruption the goings on at Hogwarts, then you’ve already made your point clear enough; despite the fact that I have already told you that the blame for this can fall on no one but the Ministry.”
“Now where’s my hug from the man of the hour?” Sammy leans down and she pulls him in tight, patting him on the back. “Congrats, Sam. You’ve found a good one.”
“I don’t think anyone would. It’s a good job Castiel was around. Weren’t you able to cast a patronus?”
Someone is walking towards them, and it takes a few moments for him to realise that it’s Sam Winchester. From the frown on his expression, it appears that he heard their conversation.
The hallway is bathed in the flickering red and black of flames, all coming from upstairs. Eileen freezes.
It's Sam's turn to roll his eyes behind him; easily seen from looming over Dean's shoulder. He fidgets with the cuffs of his sleeves for a moment, wondering whether they're long enough. "How'd it go?"
He leans forward on his broom, increasing his speed a little to lengthen the distance, and spins around on his broom.
“Don’t worry. Castiel is more than capable of ensuring defences are beyond standards, even if his brother doesn’t think so.” Bobby mutters. He watches Chuck for a moment, and frowns. “Is… is that why you’re here, Minister?”
"Hey, Dean." She murmurs, and immediately opens her arms for a hug. Dean hesitates for a moment, but then numbly leans into her arms. He feels Jody wrap them around his shoulders and give a light squeeze, but as Dean still feels pretty tense it doesn't last long, and Jody pulls away. She pats at his shoulder.
So uh, what you gonna do now?" Dean asks, forever wondering why he's stumbling over his words all of a sudden—though he knows he should know better by now.  Castiel closes his eyes, and sighs.
From one of the side doors, three different stretchers are wheeled in, with sheets over them. By the time it clicks for Dean what is underneath those sheets, the sheets are pulled off, and the crowd that is gathered around them gasps.
He traces the footsteps to a cabinet that is half open; the drawer itself is empty, until Dean peers in with his flashlight, casting it to one thing at the bottom. He reaches in and pulls it out.
“Well it’s kind of a last minute thing, y’see. He’s all caught up with a work thing, and I said I’d do him a favour, y’know, pick Jack up so he didn’t keep you waiting--”
Dean is sitting outside on the hood of the impala. The sun is starting to set. He takes a swig of his drink. He hears footsteps approach from beside, but doesn't question them.
Cas' expression falls neutral, but the mischief lingers in the creases around his eyes. "I don't have a clue what you're talking about, Winchester."
Jack looks at his writing again, as though Dean was tricking him, and gives a satisfied nod at his handiwork. "The a is hard though."
"But not as soon as it happened. Not before you went to the storage unit. Not before I had to have a potential client and a man you barely
Chalk scratches on the blackboard, the only sound echoing throughout the tired classroom. A post-lunch class never boded well for any student; many sit with half closed eyes, doodling idly on their notes. The Professor, Naomi, drops their chalk with some fanfare. Some of the students startle.
“Oh.” Castiel falls quiet for a moment. Dean takes this opportunity to dig around for another drink. When he looks back, Cas is still standing there, watching him.
The meeting was called in the middle of the day, during the lunch hour, so some Professors are still holding onto mugs of tea or notes tucked under their arms.
Technically, Cas shouldn't have his phone on his person while he's behind the counter at the gas station. But it's the middle of the night. And He trusts Dean, he does. It's just…
Dean opens his mouth to say something when, with a nod, Cas turns and steps onto the staircase. Dean watches as he descends, carried away by the ever gliding staircase.
“Yeah, but, you just don’t talk about someone’s family like that when they don’t know anythin’. ‘S not as though it’s hard on you as is, with all the other students sayin’ things about you too.”
Castiel kneels to inspect him, holding his breath as he turns him over. Lifeless eyes gaze back up at him.
Castiel shakes his head. "You're allowed to enjoy yourself, Dean. You're allowed to be compassionate and enjoy being compassionate, outside of your own dedication to your brother."
Before Dean has chance to answer this man with the gravel voice, he leans down to hook a steady arm around Dean’s shoulders, pulling him up to his feet. He doesn’t let go, and instead leads him off the pitch, and back towards the castle. It takes Dean a few minutes to realise who is carrying him.
Michael frowns, and steps towards Dean. Even though they're edging at the same height, he manages to leer over Dean.
Dean sighs, dramatically. He even raises a hand to his head. “Alas, no one shall ever take the Grindylows like the majestic creatures they deserve to be recognised as.” He declares, dramatically. “Will no one do them justice?”
Dean looks up in mild surprise as Castiel is stood over him. He’d leaned over to do up one of his boots before heading out with Sam whilst in the corridors, only to find the Professor looming over him. It makes him blink.
Despite the clattering noise that Dean is unintentionally intentionally making, the person in front of him doesn’t seem to be taking any notice. So with a yawn, Dean stretches, knocking his quill over, hitting his back.
Chuck Shurley gazes at him. He slowly raises an eyebrow. If he had his arms free, Dean imagined he'd want to slow clap like some B-movie villain.
“Oh, uh. Don’t worry about it. Sounds like you got the short end of the stick, having to deal with a brother like that. No offense.” He adds, straightening up. He looks around the corridor. “I was just, uh, headin’ out. You can walk with me if you like.”
He throws as much power behind the spell as he possibly can, and as Cas drops all his spells, water pours out from Dean’s wand, a torrent towering towards Lucifer.
"Jody needs her car lookin' at, but I can't get out to her til' tomorrow and she needs it done yesterday. Can you go check it out?"
Small note - there are some mild descriptions of someone passing away up ahead. Also some ghastly fashion sense.
Sam taps the side of his nose with a grin. “Putting your head down and working hard pays off, y’know,” a small frown, “and hearing that your older brother nearly died at the hands of a dozen Dementors also makes people a bit more sympathetic.”
“Lucifer?” Castiel asks Jack, trying to force down the crack in his voice. Jack seems none the wiser, and nods vigorously.
Cas is approaching Dean by the time he glances up, and before he can open his mouth to question him Cas leans forward to peel away the bandage on his forehead, and he can feel his cheeks flush red at the proximity. He
Castiel pauses in what he's doing. He folds his arms, wand still in his hand. "I'm unsure as to what you're implying."
Dean shakes his head, waving his free hand at him to shush him. “Hey, nah. Don’t worry about it. You’d be amazed how many parents turn up way later and treat this as just daycare.”
The sky is an entanglement of mess, robes and brooms and players all finding their place in the air. Dean rises up to the middle of the pitch, looking around. They usually staggered the release of the snitch, so it could be some time before it appears. He tilts gently so the side as a Bludger flies by him, not leaving his gaze trained on the the rest of the pitch, slowly scanning it for any sign of the snitch.
As she turns and staggers away, Cas walks after her, wand steady. “I’ll just have to disappoint him.”
“Alrigh’ then.” Dean remarks, going back to hunting in the fridge, trying to ignore the prolonged silence that was getting more and more awkward by the second.  He can feel Cas somewhere beside him take a breath, as though about to say something--
Dean runs a hand down his back, and Cas pulls away. Fingers brush at Dean's jawline, and he feels himself smile as Cas kisses him one last time. "Night, Dean."
They fall into comfortable silence. Dean slides his hand down, intertwining his fingers with Castiel's.
," Dean spits, pulling out his wand from under his robes. He screws his eyes shut, trying to focus on the darkness seeping into the edges of his mind. He glances behind him.
Castiel’s head doesn’t move. He murmurs, quietly. “… You know I’ll be training to become an Auror, just like the rest of my family.”
"But that didn't happen." Dean remarks, more of a statement than a question. He fiddles with one of the coasters on the table, but can see Cas nod from his peripheral.
are still learning.” She mutters, turning around. Dean strides by her, grinning. Castiel is walking behind him, looking distinctly like he’s already lost.
The container is covered in dust. Dean presses the flashlight on his phone and swings it around. There are clear foot tracks on the ground that have displaced settled dust; he'd been here very recently, though not to linger, apparently.
Sam could count the amount of times he’s been in the Minister’s office. It remained ever the same, even with a new Minister - except for the removal of personal artifacts belonging to the last Minister here. Chuck seemed as of yet to place any of his own.
She adds ‘upbringing’. The whole room falls to deathly silence, distinctly lacking in the ambient yawn and shuffle of stationary from drowsy students. Naomi only realises as she turns back around.
teacher to outsmart you. The whole school is aware of your past profession and your family. At least attempt to demonstrate that you once belonged to such."
They fill in the empty chairs left out at the impossibly longer staff table, and the Minister takes a stand at the lectern, Professor Singer wordlessly taking a step back.
Castiel nods, and his hand gently squeezes Dean's arm. With one last glance, Cas turns and enters the house in silence. The door closes behind him with a soft click, and Dean watches, alone.
There is tense silence for a few minutes as the judge pours over the receipts, frowning. Castiel glances over to where Lucifer and Crowley stand. Both of them are staring, Lucifer with confusion, Crowley with some mild, stoic curiosity. Castiel tilts his head.
right to command the amount of attention he did from Dean, but he found himself unable to resist it. Was that what had Dean so on edge?
The office is cramped, dark, and yet surprisingly clean. Even Castiel could tell from just walking in that he had
They only make to break apart when they hear the front door to Bobby's open behind them, and Sam's voice:
, Cas.” Dean raises his arms, motioning to the other man. “You keepin’ something like this – makes me wonder if that’s really the case.”
Cas doesn't hang around to listen, however. He pushes himself out of Sam and Dean's way, leaving the courthouse without so much as a goodbye. Both brothers stand there, watching him go.
"Oh," is all Anna says, gaze lingering on Jack—who for what it was worth, was concentrating on that apple juice with some
Thirty seconds later, Sam holds up a vial and runs over to Jess. Gently, he pours it into her mouth, and everyone falls silent in anticipation.
Everyone turns to stare at Sam, uncomfortable, but side eyes the Minister expectantly; they’d all been wondering the same thing. Chuck blinks, frozen. He wrings his hands.
"Sam is being taken to the hospital. I think he will be okay." She looks uncertain. "Tell Dean to come, please."
Dean braces himself for the pain jolting through him, tensing up as his stomach is aimed again, and again. Tears well in his eyes from the pain. His stomach convulses.
Michael holds his gaze for a tentative amount of time. With one final look at Sam, he turns away. “I’ll leave you to think on what we talked about.” He says, and walks behind them, disappearing. Eventually, Castiel looks at Sam.
Sam is propped up on a bed behind him, looking rather well for what Dean was anticipating. His brow furrows in confusion.
“No, apologies. I don’t understand why you believe you have authority in this matter. The only one who should raise concerns with me about this is Professor Singer.”
He crashes onto the roof, nearly sliding off his broom completely, and looks around, disorientated. He hears the whistle of the object moving before he ducks, and he watches as it flies towards Sam.
"Yes, I know," Cas says, a little too quickly. He looks down at him. "But we haven't had a chance to go visit his Mom this month."
Dean has been in two minds the whole day. He wanted to be there at the hearing, especially after hearing the news. (That they all knew, but still.) But, after the last time Dean properly saw him...
Just like Azazel had done to Mary, all those years ago. Just like what had happened to John Winchester.
They are charming the platform away, when Dean glances up. Noticing that Dean has stopped what he is doing, Castiel turns around. He frowns.
Sam raises an eyebrow. “I think he’d know, even if I tried not to tell him.” He places a hand on Cas’ shoulder. “Thanks for looking out for him, by the way. I don’t think I ever thanked you - he’s too busy looking out for others sometimes. He’ll appreciate having someone at his back.”
The first thing that settles in his consciousness is the smell of anaesthetic, tickling at his nose. He grips at the bundled sheets that his legs are trapped under, and holds a hand to his head as his senses dawn on him.
"Nice. Kid called Jack. His dad brought him in. His name was something odd. Castiel? Castine? Name sounds European, that's all I remember. Think they're new in town though. Seemed nice enough."
“You all here? Doesn’t matter, it’ll be your own fault if you were late to star in your own competition.” He motions to the three different tables that are laid out at the front of the Great Hall, with various beakers and ingredients placed on it. “You’ll have noticed that you’ll be doing some potion making.” He looks at Chuck for a moment, then back to them. “But because we have a temperament for the over-dramatic in this bloody school, we’ve given you something of a …stake, to work towards.”
Cas nods. "In that envelope is an announcement of a custody hearing. He wants to fight for custody, and probably prove his paternity."
.” Charlie giggles. Dean turns away, holding his overladen paper plate of buffet and BBQ food to hold himself away.
Jack recoils for a moment, shuffling behind his father's leg as he peers up at Dean. Dean gives him a warm smile. "I'm Mr. Winchester. I'll be your new teacher. It's all cool if you're scared though, I can be pretty intimidating." He reaches around behind his desk, grabbing something. "I got a friend for you, though, who will never be scared of me or anyone else."
Sam nods, only realising now that he is looking away from the laptop just how exhausted he felt. His eyes are dry. When was the last time he'd even paused to make a drink?
Jody snorts, folding her arms. “Not the worst idea I’ve heard from you. But what I do hear is that there is a Dueling club starting up, in response to recent events happening at Hogwarts — and, well, the wider wizarding community.”
Dean’s out of his robes in this occasion, but decided to take his brother for one walk around the pitch before heading towards Hogsmeade to visit one of the local taverns. Weekends were a good time.
"Can't imagine why you may think that." But Cas sighs. He slides his arms around Dean's waist, and leans in for a moment. He takes a breath. "Okay, I'm leaving."
Naomi, staring at Dean for a few more seconds, glances back at the scribble of chalk on the black board at the front of the room.
Cas stands at the entrance to his living room. He folds his arms, looking at the epicentre with a sigh. "Jack, we can't leave it like this."
He stops when the girl, hair tied in soft rings of a short ponytail, steps forward. She’s silent for a few moments, stares through him, before she slowly raises a finger. It stops after it lands directly on his face.
Bobby looks at Chuck, then at the quill. He leans back, grabs the glass bottle behind him, and two small glasses, setting them on the desk. He pours both of them a glass of whiskey, whether or not Chuck wanted it or not.
tall man. Sam looms over him, a little apologetically, while they stand awkwardly outside Gabriel's bar.
His phone rings. He shouldn't, but he glances at it as he's still driving, and his breath catches in his throat as he doesn't recognise the number. Quickly pulling up, he answers it.
“Yeah, could’ve guessed that one.” Dean says, peeling the envelope from his chest. He sticks his fingernail underneath the skin of it before Cas reaches, hand clamping over Dean’s wrist. Dean pauses.
The staircase groans as it rotates, but Bobby doesn't look up from his desk until he hears the footsteps of the new arrival approach. Bobby glances up, peering over his reading glasses at the figure. He places the quill down beside the parchment.
The tailor seems satisfied, so Dean shoves Sam out of the way to get a good look at himself in the mirror. He frowns for a moment, turning a little to the left and right. "Huh." He remarks. "Maybe bow ties can be cool."
Cas and Jody take a step back, and after a moment, the sound of the whistle blows through the grounds.
Dean steps into the room alone. As the door is closed behind him, the stifled ambience of the rest of the ward dissipates as quickly as he enters. He grips at the book and helplessly looks around the room. Bare. White. A hospital room. In the centre is a bed with a chair beside it.
It's only then he realises that the whole match had stopped in favour of watching them. Claire slowly raises one of her eyebrows.
"I always figured the promise of all the hamburgers you could eat and the wistful screaming of children demanding ice cream is always a surefire way to lift the spirits." Jodie notes. Dean at least attempts a chuckle. "Charlie's in the garden."
When suddenly wailing rings through the kitchen and the door is being thrown open by someone half its height.
Dean raises an eyebrow, but smiles when he realises what is he is being handed. There’s a small crinkle as he rips some of the foil, chomping half of it into his mouth. “Oh, hey— thanks-” He mumbles around a piece. Castiel closes the drawer and starts shuffling his papers around on the desk, organising them. It takes him a few moments to realise how intently he’s being stared at, and he looks up.
“Hey.” He feels a hand on his arm. A groggy blink, and Jody swims into view, sat at the end of his bed.
He twists his head around, wondering if the man himself was lurking around the corner. He couldn’t see nor sense anything. Of course. Lucifer wouldn’t want to do this sort of grunt work himself.
Crowley picks up the teacup, pinky finger extended, and takes a very slow, very indulgent sip. Castiel cannot help but wonder how he hasn't burned his tongue.
He watches, arm raised over his head, as the shield shimmers above him as bricks start raining towards him, debris crashing around as some of them shatter on impact. The only thing Castiel can hear outside of the ruckus his is own breathing - something that he’s barely doing.
Charlie sticks her tongue out, withdrawing as her eye catches the Headmaster rising to his feet. Silence hushes over the great hall, students turning from their own gossip to look towards the front. Nevertheless, Robert Singer taps the end of his goblet on the desk in three long, drawn out knocks. He waits for complete silence to fall.
Castiel looks down at the ground. “Oh.” Is all he finally says, sounding…resigned. Dean feels himself sigh on his behalf.
“Here, take this.” Castiel says, pulling a piece of foil out from his robes, and it takes Dean a moment to realise that he’s being offered chocolate. Weakly, he takes it.
Sam shrugs a little. "Yeah. But he...he kinda struggles to accept he needs lookin' after too, y'know?" Castiel nods. Sam sighs. "Kinda wonder what he'll do once the wedding happens."
"Fuck off," Dean comments, hoisting the box into his arms. "You gonna say that about every strange guy that comes in?"
The snitch dances along the pitch, waltzing its way around one of the towers. Ahead of him, Cas abruptly alters his course to fly around the opposite side of the tower, hoping to meet it on the other side. Dean flies up, and skirts along the top of the tower until he's overhead.
aside. “We, uh. We got a policy about people turning up like this. His guardian didn’t give permission for anyone of your description, so…”
"You're right, of course." Sam signs at Eileen. With a slow stretch, he rises to his feet. Eileen looks up at him. "Don't worry about down here. You go get ready for bed," she signs at him.
The house is small, but cosy, and overgrown with succulents. He’s not sure he’s ever seen so many in one house, and Dean has a small suspicion that if Cas could get away with it, he’d replace the armchair with even more of them. The TV is on, some remnant of whatever children’s channel Jack must have been watching just before bedtime. Dean finds himself watching it with the vague curiosity of a missed children’s TV diet.
He straightens up as two people he doesn't recognise enter the room. A small boy with brown hair, swooping over one side of his face and cut neatly. He grips onto what he's only assuming is his dad's hand—a tall, dark haired man, lips pressed together as he sweeps the room, even more cautious than his son. They both certainly
Sam gives a curt nod, straightening. “Yeah,” he says. Then snorts. “Thought you were the one who didn’t like chick flick moments?”
Castiel grips the edge of the desk, squeezing his eyes shut as he attempts to compose himself.  He can feel Sam take a deep breath beside him.
A nod. Cas stares down at his tea. “I don’t know the details, but Kelly came to the conclusion that Lucifer was, well, an abusive ass. She was a friend of mine; we were work colleagues. So she came to me asking for help, and I helped her, and… along with some other family members, helped keep Lucifer away. We all knew he was involved in, uh, ‘conducting illegal activities’, and eventually he ended up serving time.”
Cas reaches up, and grabs Dean's robes, pulling so hard to throw Dean away. Dean grabs hold of Cas and refuses to let go, and they both spin in the air.
"Not sure. Used to work for Bobby—he runs a mechanics shop, dunno if you've met him yet. You stick around any longer you'll run into him somewhere in town, I bet. Grumpiest man in the world, has a baseball cap permanently glued to his head. Can't miss him. Bobby insisted I should 'do something with those smarts' after Sammy went off to law school. I wanted to keep supportin' Sam, but I ended up goin' through school myself while workin’ part time for Bobby. Been rockin’ the teacher life about five years, now."
?” Dean cuts in, the adrenaline from the fight squaring his shoulders. He shuffles out of Jody’s grasp, taking a few steps to Cas. “I felt it in my hand! You’re the one that tackled me, you dick!—”
They strike the ground with a bruising thump, both yelling as their brooms bounce somewhere off the ground. The shock of hitting the ground has Dean unclench his fist and Cas tackles him, grabbing at his hand in an effort to snatch the snitch from him.
Sam glances up as a figure looms at his doorway. He blinks with some shock as he realises that it is the Head Auror.
“I know your luck hasn’t been great so far,” he says, earnestly. He withdraws his wand from his robes, holding it up in front of him in preparation. Dean has flashbacks, to a few months earlier, when a taller man with blue eyes did the same thing and nearly kicked his ass. It was some of the most fun Dean had had all year.
Charlie Bradbury nudges Dean as soon as he sits down at the staff table, eyeing Castiel with a raised eyebrow as he goes to sit at the other end, seemingly unaware to the observation he is now receiving.
Castiel finally turns around at that, blue eyes gazing at Dean with a look that merely confirms his suspicions. Dean can’t figure out if Cas is hurt or not.
Cas grunts, holding the shield, and Dean feels his chest twist. He staggers shakily to his feet. He looks behind him.
Anna looks at him, handing Jack a tall glass cup. Jack frowns in concentration. "I'm grown up enough now! I've drank from them before!"
"You know that Ellen would probably just give you your lunch for free if you turned up to her diner?"
"I, uh," Dean stammers over himself for a moment, before he can gather his thoughts. He places the coffee cup down and reaches for the inside of his jacket, pulling John's Journal out. "Uh, my dad, in the hospital — he slipped me this note, some coordinates. He was a marine, it was something he'd do a lot to let me and Sam know where he was headin' next though we never figured out why — anyway, it led to a storage container, and it then to this journal, which is full of stuff about mom, and --" Dean feels his voice crack for a moment. He stubbornly pushes on. "And the last page had this."
eyes, like he belonged in an overzealously coloured portrait drawn by one of his students. "It's hard, moving schools so soon."
“Thank you all for listening. As mentioned at Breakfast there’s an announcement I needed to make that had to wait for tonight.
A strained silence settles in between them, long enough for her to believe that she’s made her point, before she picks the chalk back up.
He turns his head, Jack’s babbling tuning out, and sees Anna standing at the doorway. She’s staring straight at him, expressionless. A single nod.
“The top drawer in his desk is full of chocolate. He told me not to tell anyone about that, though.”
Cas is quiet for a moment, glancing down to his shoulder where Dean has just had his hand. He looks up. “Thank you, Dean.”
from how full it is. Many of the pages are full of the unmistakable scrawl of John’s handwriting, full of pictures, newspaper clippings — some about mom, some about other arson attacks across the country that occurred in a
Castiel looks at him with a slight frown. Dean shrugs. “You can call me Dean. You don’t need to call me by my title. It’s not as though we weren’t both students here, once.”
Azazel lives in some abandoned farm house in the middle of freaking nowhere, because of course he does. It's little wonder that there was so much difficulty in trying to find out where or who this guy was—this guy sure wasn't getting delivery without an extortionate tip required.
Any murmurs silence as Bobby sweeps into the room. They all look at Bobby expectantly, and Bobby doesn't waste any time.
Jody smiles at him, and leads him into the house. Somewhere in the distance is the sound of children yelling delightedly. The door shuts behind him with a soft click.
Sam narrows his eyes, adjusting the gloves on his broom. Dean can see that they're shaking, even now. "You're in a good mood. Feeling confident?"
Cas stares down at the ground, and Dean can only manage a few moments of silence before he reaches out, placing his hand on Castiel’s shoulder.
The combination works, and Dean pockets the lock as he pulls the door open with a creak. He was already regretting not having Sam around, but he was working. And...uh, he hadn't told him yet.
"Right, so. I'm going to need as many details as I can. About what happened, about what you did, about the situation you find yourself in now. If you have any physical evidence on you that would be great, otherwise I'll need as much as that as soon as possible. Then I'll have to take it back to the firm and hopefully be able to take on your case personally."
Chuck Shurley, while certainly capable in some ways, was not so much in… others. A capable duellist was not one of them; he would’ve been part of the Aurors if that was the case, especially with the events of the last few years.
Lucifer staggers back, and Dean can't roll away quick enough before he feels two bodies tumbling over him; he barely shuffles out of range of becoming
“Don’t be out partying too late, Sammy.” Dean grins, opening his car door. “You got work in the morning.”
When Castiel enters the kitchen, Dean slams a bunch of cheese into his mouth, freezing when they make eye contact.
“That’ll be $14.86,” Castiel interrupts, the cash register opening with a ding. “Would you like a look at our Valentine’s Special with your copy of Busty Asian Beauties?”
Dean tries to think if he remembers that. He just remembers fire, and how wet his feet were after running outside.
Before either of them can reply, another individual drifts to a stop beside them. They all look up, and Dean's shoulders tense.
Cas leans back on his haunches with a blink. Jack is staring at him, seriously, so he spends a moment contemplating the question more than he should. "...He's a very nice man, yes." Cas pauses. "He's very caring, and very funny, and smart."
“Was too distracted to watch you go down. It was Cas who caught you. We… didn’t know what Michael was going to do once he went down – if it even
Sam sighs, and turns so that Eileen can see him. He'd been working at the papers from the custody case nearly all day. He didn't have much time left before he went on leave for the wedding, so he needed to make sure that everything was
Mr. Shurley nods, and ushers him along. Jack bumbles off, still clutching at Tony the gecko. Dean and Mr. Shurley straightens as they watch him go.
." Dean grunts as Lucifer kicks him, hard, in the stomach. With boots. Then he kicks him again. And again. And again.
The Professor’s sentence has the rest of the class bubble in hurried murmurs, and Naomi tangles with dragging the class into silence.
It's an envelope, tucked into the windshield. Tentatively, Cas leans over, and pulls it out. His own name is handwritten on the front, and is unsealed.
The classroom slowly fills with kindergarten children, and Dean leans back on his chair, grinning at them as they all come in—many of them clutching new toys of their own, running around and waving them at friends whom they hadn't seen over the winter break. Or perhaps they had. To a kid that age, a day probably felt like a lifetime. A few of them wave their presents enthusiastically in his face, and Dean can only pull a smile at them before the kids run off. He wonders if they’ll remember much of these moments—he could at least remember Sammy's delight when they were kids.
“Well, it’s uh. It’s a bit late for that.” He manages to murmur, before images of Cas, unnaturally still on the stretcher flash into his mind. He squeezes his eyes shut for a moment. “What do you think we should do?”
, Professor. You’d better walk me home just in case those Grindylows decide to swoop in on Dementor horseback to have me for breakfast too.”
"You sure you're fine doing this?" Cas asks, stood in the doorway. His fingers are clutched into the lapels of Dean's jacket, and his breath ghosts over Dean's lips.
When Castiel pulls up to the house, Jack practically bursts out of the door in excitement. He barely has time to cut the ignition and open the door before Jack has barrelled into him. It’s an instant salve to the anxiety that had been broiling in his chest on the way over, and he wraps his arms around Jack in a tight, relieved squeeze and smiles down at him before Jack even says a word.
“You don’t need to swear your life, Dean.” He says, quiet. His hand reaches up, placing it over Dean’s, thumb wrapped around his wrist. “I’ll watch over you.”
Dean turns his head as Ellen looks up; Sam looms over his right shoulder. If Dean hadn’t grown up with his ever imposing stature, he probably would have jumped out of his skin. Despite not jumping, Dean punches him in the shoulder for good measure.
“I don’t think Castiel has anything to apologise for,” Sam comments, as he casually approaches. “Professor Singer would have hired him for a reason. If Bobby trusts him, then we should.”
Dean grins, tilting his head towards the older woman in the back of the kitchen, flipping some burgers. “Hey, Ellen. How you doin’?”
Castiel tucks his wand away, and his expression softens just a fraction. "I understand your sentiment, Dean. But my family do not. The last members of my family to leave the profession --"
“Finally, most often it is their background that dictates their future. If a wizard has come from a sordid family, or a family with a dark past, the individuals are much more likely to go on to commit Dark Acts. Nature and Nurture often go hand in hand.”
"What are you doing here, Sir?" they ask, then gasp rather dramatically. "-- Are you here to teach us?!"
"Hey, sweetheart." Dean murmurs, reaching and brushing his thumb across the stubble of Castiel's cheek. "It's over now, yeah? You're both gonna be just fine."
The staff room bubbles with concern. He feels Charlie and Jody's eyes on him. If his head didn't suddenly feel so numb, Dean would start feeling rather self conscious.
Castiel nods, seeming appeased. Dean's unsure why he just told him all that. He motions to the doorway, stepping aside. "Jody had to run to the garden, one of 'em was crying. You know where the kitchen is?"
He practically stumbles into the school, barely remembering that shoes and rain and lino flooring don't make for the best power walk, and he very nearly loses his balance. Rain dripping down his forehead, he nods at the woman behind the reception desk—Charlie, he believes her name was?—before speeding along to the room.
They drive to a diner, one that is tucked away on the highway just outside of town, one that is only often frequented by road trip users, Truck drivers, and those looking for an undisclosed place to meet. Dean swears by it on their way over, particularly as it’s run by someone he’s known since he was a kid.
Dean holds his hands up. “Alright, sorry. I was just --” Dean frowns. “Wait, do you think he has it out for Shurley?”
Dean and Lucifer both stop and turn to the doorway. Castiel stands there, and Dean straightens. He ignores the relief easing into his spine.
Dean twists his broom in a u-turn, turning behind him to chase after Cas. As with most quidditch matches, it was very easy to forget about the rest of the team on the pitch, and Dean's only focus became what was in front of him; Cas and getting that snitch.
Dean grins down at the male sitting on the bench in front of him. "Seemed pretty determined to catch that bouquet, Cas."
Dean glances back at Cas, briefly, before tossing Charlie the bar of chocolate. She catches it with a fumble. “It’s not everyday you have someone literally save your life seconds from death. Wanted to make sure he knew how grateful I was.”
was a student), and be on his way. At this time of year, dipping into October, nights grew to be a lot longer and he’d often find himself having to do his final routine in the dark. It didn’t bother him. He might be the Quidditch Master, but that didn’t make him an insufficient wizard. Even though they were hanging on the outskirts of Hogwarts, it was very rare to get anything crawling in from outside. Once or twice he’d had to use a stun spell to scare some things that had made its way from the forbidden forest, but that was all.
Castiel lands on top of Lucifer, punching him straight across the jaw. He strikes him several times before Lucifer rolls him over,  pinning his arm hard against his neck. Cas chokes, grabbing at the arm for a few moments—he pries a leg free enough to kick Lucifer between the legs.
Dean is sure it's in his hair, and thus it will remain for 84 years. It’s times like this he deeply,
“Not really, but they might feel helpless. I think it’ll be important if you do something to help them… not, feel helpless, Dean.”
The arena falls silent. Dean turns to stare at Cas. Cas doesn’t know what to do, and helplessly shrugs. Chuck had been one variable, but a very minor one. He looks to Sam, who’s watching with even more bemusement than Dean is.
All thoughts about Cas forgotten, he chases after the snitch as it zooms around the perimeter of the pitch. Somewhere distant, he can hear the announcer’s voice rising in anticipation of his inevitable win…
He watches as Castiel silently strides to the back of his team, throwing his leg over the broom. He can’t recall ever seeing Castiel fly before. Jody must have been pretty desperate for a replacement if she’d chosen
Jack nods, patting a hand to Cas’ wet forehead. “Yeah! We read a story and then I played with a firetruck and then I did a drawing, which I just done with--”
He’s interrupted by Jack jumping out of his seat with a “Daddy!” and running towards him. Castiel blinks but scoops the boy up as he nears him, hoisting him on his hip. He looks at Jack.
. I’m just saying how unfair it is that you’re picking him apart in front of us. All families have got crap in them, don’t mean anything about the people. Hell, even I—”
"It's the same handwriting, and you know it." Castiel cuts in, with a growl. "You left those invoices on my car window. You want Lucifer gone."
"Very well. But that doesn't refute what I said," he says, and walks off—his lawyer, Crowley, in tow. As soon as they're sure Lucifer has left, Dean steps towards Cas.
Rubbing what is probably blood away from his eyes, Dean looks dazedly as he sees Claire fly above the Lake, with the Dementors pursuing her. Dean doesn't know where his broom is, but his wand is gripped tight in his hand.
They walk the remainder of the corridor back in silence. Dean is unsure whether the silence is comfortable or not, and he fidgets with the foil on the chocolate bar the rest of the walk. He pauses at the door to the great hall, gently putting an arm out to stop Cas.
"Two drinks on delivery to the most handsome boys in the diner," a female voice serenades from beside them and Dean drags his gaze away to stare up at the approaching waitress. Young, female. If Castiel had to guess, possibly Ellen's daughter? He wouldn't suppose to presume, though.
Just before Dean barrels into him, Cas spins upside down on his broom, and Dean nearly flies outside the boundary line. Swearing as he pulls his broom up to stop himself, he turns back to see where Cas has gone. Cas has righted to top of the broom, and Dean swears that Cas smirks at him, before turning and flying off to pursue his goal of finding the snitch.
“Hm,” he says. “Not quite what I had in mind, Castiel. I was hoping you’d be just as easy to convince as Michael over there.”
He can’t see anything, nothing that should cause him such sudden pause, but cold rushes over him, terror tightening his chest that his joints freeze, and for a few seconds he can’t make himself move, or think, to try and decipher what the impending danger is that’s approaching him—
“Oh. Mr… Winchester,” The name comes back to him. Mr. Winchester tilts his head, and a grin spreads on his expression.
They both look down, and wait for the whistle. Dean hunkers his shoulders down, leaning against the broom as close as possible…
Sam strolls towards the judge’s desk with the envelope, in a sealed plastic wallet. He presents it to the judge, who then opens it, pouring out the numerous pieces of paper and invoices.
“Bloody hell,” Crowley mutters, dragging the trolley away. “Knew I should’ve used Charlie. Then I wouldn’t have to be witness to this ridiculous mating dance.”
Jack comes to a stop, as though pondering the deepest reaches of the universe. For all Cas knew, he was. "Isn't a date like... like when you...." He covers his hand with his mouth, as though about to say something abhorrent. "When you do kissing?"
Jack was the only remaining child. As he approaches he can hear the teacher, Mr. Winchester’s, voice drifts out:
“Da--Dadd--y-” Jack sobs. Dean ducks out of the fridge, straightening up to see what drama is unfolding behind him. Castiel has already turned towards the child. It didn’t take someone with intelligence to decipher what the issue was.
Dean’s expression goes from one of cockiness to losing any emotion immediately. He turns to Castiel, who simply gives him a nod, and with a hand to his back, a light push to the centre of the arena. Dean pretends not to stumble. And draws out his wand.
Sam looks back at Dean, looks at him for long enough that Dean has to look away. “Yeah, so they haven’t changed.”
“I am unsure of what else you expect of me, Michael. Hogwarts is one of the most well protected places in the country. But there’s only so much that can be done when the Ministry decides that sending a group of Dementors to look over Hogwarts is a
He stops when he nears Anna, and they simply look at each other silently for a long moment or two. Castiel glances down to where Jack is hovering at the door; he clearly wants to see this big meeting.
close into the eyes of Lucifer. Lucifer had always come off as this try-hard, got-off-the-wrong-foot, wrong-place-at-wrong-time, Gee-Mr-Judge-I'm-Sorry-For-Getting-Emotional-About-My-Son kinda guy. Now?
Sam's suddenly looking at him as though he knows something Castiel doesn't, so Castiel quickly glances down at the array of papers on the desk. He’s not used to having that gaze turned back on him.
Dean steps towards the bed and places the book down for a moment on the bedside table. He slowly settles into the chair. He watches the other male, for a few moments.
Dean collapses onto one of the chairs with a dramatic sigh, backpack crumpling beside the old desk. He subtlety (or not so subtly) eyes the other boy, who has his back to him at a desk just further up in the room. They are the only two occupants there, aside from a lone piece of chalk that is currently writing lines on the blackboard in front of them. Writing lines. Detention could be worse, he supposes.
Dean closes his eyes for a moment, letting the noise of the children and the rush of exerted energy slowly slosh its way to stillness as he breathes. He'd joke about it, but this was one of his favorite parts of the day in that it was necessary. No matter how hectic, or stressful, or annoying his work day would be, he knew there would be a moment where he could come back to Baby and sit in her company, alone, and just... breathe. It might not be the most comfy, or the first place people would think of for respite, but it was certainly one to him.
Castiel stares into Jack’s bedroom. Tumbled to the side, perched upside down on the carpet and staring at him from its odd angle, was a plush, red, gecko.
This chapter contains upsetting descriptions of injury and death to families, particularly of the children.
As he’s leaning down, he hears the distinct sound of a person at the counter, and items being dropped by the till ready for purchase. He starts to straighten back up.
With a small grunt, Dean lets his head fall back on the pillow. He rubs roughly at his eyes with his knuckles. Right. London.
Cas’ lack of response shouldn’t have been so disconcerting, but he remains silent for an uncomfortable amount of time. He reckons Cas has never paid much attention to social cues, but this was a little ridiculous.
Nothing. He knows that there's going to be nothing. Cursing, he keeps moving, forcing to take a detour and move off course, if only to get them away from the others, and from the students. He can hear screams coming from the crowd. The competition is going to be abandoned soon if something isn't done.
Jess’ shrill cry throws Dean out of his internal dance and he looks up, watching as Jess emerges and runs towards a figure, slumped on the floor, unconscious---
She passes a worried glance at Dean before wandering off again. To Castiel's surprise, Dean raises a bottle in a toast.
Dean sighs, long. "I'm not. Told you, didn't I? Also might have brought it up with—" It dawns on him how strange this will sound, and he feels heat brushing his cheeks with something like embarrassment. "—with Cas."
“Er… no, not really. I had them all moved out of the office. Kind of gave me the heebie jeebies, y’know?” He mumbles. He stares down at his hands for a second, before using his right one to run a hand across his forehead. “I just wanted to ask about… well. About the security, at Hogwarts.”
They had him cremated, and took the surprisingly sleek looking urn to Mary's grave. There's silence as Dean unscrews the lid, and scatters the ashes on top, watching as the summary of this man, their father, is compressed to nothing but a grey smear. They're alone in the back of the cemetery. Quietly, Sam unscrews the whiskey he'd been carrying, and pours it on the grave. He takes a deep swig, before passing it over to Dean. Dean takes his own, before pouring the rest on the grave.
The whistle rings so loudly, Dean tucks away a thought in the back of his mind to threaten detention to Claire if they’ve broken his whistle, tournament or no. That was his favourite whistle, too.
Eileen drops the notes she's looking at, striding towards the hallway. "Sam?" she calls out, but feels no feet walking across upstairs. She walks into the hallway, and gasps.
Jody’s stern expression releases into a large smile, skin crinkling at the corner of her eyes. She grabs Dean by the shoulders. “Thank you. I can guarantee a lot more students will be eager to take part with you and the Professor helping to lead it.”
Castiel watches him for a moment. “I would if I could, but I’m fairly certain Hogwarts staff aren’t allowed to support Ministry members during a challenge. It’ll go both ways.”
Sam doesn't realise just how blankly he's staring at the computer screen until he feels a pair of gentle hands on his shoulders, rubbing deep at the knots in his muscles. He exhales, arching a little into the motion.
“Son of a –” He says, but doesn’t finish as he’s thrown onto his side, a hand bruising his waist as he hits the ground hard. He looks up just in time to see Cas advance forward, and with a flick of his wand a hurricane surges into motion. Dean raises his arm to cover his eyes.
"I will. Good luck." The call ends, and Cas is left staring at the black and white, fuzzy resolution security cameras in front of him. He stares. Then he looks down, and tries to call Dean.
coming from the bedroom. Eileen tugs her jumper to cover her mouth and kicks open the bedroom door, where Sam is still
She storms forward, hand curling into a fist, and Castiel almost falls backwards as he staggers to his feet, backing up.
“Okay, we’ve all been over this part. What I’m lookin’ for is your take-off and landing.” Dean frowns at a few impatient groans. “Alright, alright. I know you’ve done this a million times over but if you forget to oil the bones of what you know you’ll never get up in the sky proper. Not how it’s meant to go, anyway.”
"I'm not throwing it away." Cas reassures, leaning down to begin sweeping. "But you should start picking up what's around you."
“There are things I have to carry alone, even now.” Cas cuts in, a dead stare. The hallway is quiet, the muted sounds of birds calling from beyond the archways they were stood between. “We saw what happened to Michael. I’ve seen what happens when
Dean throws himself to the bottom of the stadium, legs wrapped tight around the broom as he reaches his arms out. He tackles Cas from behind and they both go flying onto the grass, rolling. The snitch is between both of them, they can hear the distinct buzz, and they tackle and wrestle over the pitch, yelling at the other to get off. Dean eventually managed to lay on Castiel's midsection, digging fingers into the tendon on his wrists to get Cas to let go. Cas resists for a remarkable length of time until Dean puts weight on his elbow and with a growl Cas is forced to open his hand.
True to his word, Dean looks out;  spotting Jack sprinting around the flowerbeds, bouquet in hand. Claire and Kaia are trailing after him, curious, as Jack holds the bouquet to the flowers in the flowerbed, probably pointing out the different colours. Whatever it is, Claire finds it hilarious.
He saunters upstairs, brushing his teeth, and half-heartedly rolling into pyjamas. He crawls under the duvet, knowing it was one of those nights where he’ll be unconscious within minutes.
Suddenly, crying erupts from the aforementioned garden. Jodie rolls her eyes. "I'd better go sort that out. Make yourself at home."
“Yeah, yeah, lookin’ for Chuck is great and all, but we’re missin’ something. Why’d Lucifer disguise as him in the first place and then come to Hogwarts? He had the ministry of Magic right under his fingertips, not unlike he’s done—”
Castiel slowly shuffles around the corner when the children don’t move, and lowers himself to a crouch. He glances at his wand, and a soft light shines from the end of it. The children turn to look at him.
Dean holds up the wand in celebration and the students applaud, some of the girls shaking his robe as though a small banner. Dean grins, taking in the applause with a small bow, before turning back to Cas, who is trying to dry his face with a rough wipe of his arm. Water drips off his eyelashes as he coughs, and the class fall silent; Dean included.
He suddenly feels a body beside him and he glances up, finding Sam is next to him gathering some of the items in his own arms. They both pause when they make eye contact, and slowly Dean reaches for some beakers in Sam’s hand.
Dean flashes his best flattering grin at her, and dares to keep his head where it is for the moment. “I work with small kids, Ellen. My reflexes are second to none.”
“I know.” Dean cuts in with a smile. “It’s okay.” He leans down to Jack, raises a high five. “I’ll see ya tomorrow, yeah?”
“As I said, it’s part of my responsibility to Hogwarts. But I appreciate the gratitude.” He tries a smile. “Truly.”
A few students pass by, enough to draw attention from them, and Cas quietly steps away. He shakes his head. “I can’t say too much. Maybe I will, soon. I just wanted you to know.”
He motions to the doors to the great hall, which open as if on cue. A small entourage enter the hall, all waving at the students as polite applause smatters throughout, growing as the Minister enters, obvious by the small stature and distinct separation from the rest of the group entering. Castiel blinks, in his seat, but stands in order to join the rest of the staff applauding.
already know — it was a small town, he knew Jody, and Jack was his student. If he cared Dean would’ve looked into who Jack was and his background.
“Here, at Hogwarts. It was part of our—” Cas sighs, cutting himself off from a redundant explanation. “My role as an Auror specialised in healing magic.”
of, Dean?" Sam asks, pointedly. Dean can hear the tailor bustling around in the background. They ignore him.
Lucifer pauses, before turning into the room. He presses fingers to his own heart, a softly mocking expression. “What? How rude, Cassie. Little old me just wants a family visit—”
“Looks like you figured you’ve got too many ribs and needed to get rid of one.” He looks to their partner. “Get them to the medical wing.”
To Dean’s surprise, Cas corners him after leaving the Great Hall, despite ignoring him the whole time.
Jody lived on the edge of town. It helped, having a bigger space, considering she somehow managed to balance being the sheriff while also juggling three small daughters, though Donna would generally swing by  as the pseudo co-parent.
Dean presses in, lips pushing against Cas'. Their sway stills as they kiss, soft and slow. Cas hums, eyes closed, before tilting his head back to look at him. "You're a master at both, it appears."
The reception itself, while modest, was still lavish—the community hall was full to the brim of Sam's college mates, and their own found family—Ellen and Jo, Jody and her kids, all running around the large patch of grass set just outside the function room, French doors open wide to let in the late summer heat.
"Hmm," Dean muses, considering Castiel with a curious gaze. "Am I going to have to charm you to the truth, Novak?"
“You don’t just leave the profession of Auror, Castiel. Your recklessness is going to put everyone in danger, —”
He's absent-mindedly jangling his car keys in his hands as he walks into the reception area, coming to a stop as he sees Cas and Sam walking out. Good timing, then. He tries a smile at Cas—who isn't even looking at him, staring off somewhere, jaw set. Sam gives him a half-hearted shrug in greeting.
Wringing his hands, he takes a few steps forward. A hand grasps at Cas’ shoulder, and Castiel jerks, shoulders hunching.
Cas stares at him. "Didn't you have...?" he begins to ask, but doesn't finish his sentence; the guy seems to carry at least
When Dean finally lands, Claire already bundled up by Jody and Bobby after the Dementors were expelled, the first thing Dean does is march up to Michael. Looking furious.
I’m officially announcing a school---wide tournament, as a symbol of partnership between Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic, and to allow us to come together and celebrate in times that may otherwise call us to run and hide. This tournament shall be run like this; there will be a representative from the school — one selected from the student selection, and one from the staff, and there will be one from our small entourage of Ministry staff members. There will be a few select challenges that will take place over the first week of November, and the winner shall earn a small monetary prize alongside the honour of their respective groups.
“Hey,” Cas soothes, sweeping Jack off his feet and propping him on the kitchen island. “What are those tears for?”
Castiel locks the car behind him and walks Jack towards the house. Castiel glances towards the front windows, and slows. There’s a silhouette in the window, of a man staring at him. When Cas makes brief eye contact, the curtains shift and the man steps away.
All class members are quiet, looking at one particular individual with his hand up. His face is like thunder.
Without so much as pausing in his work, Castiel picks up the quill, and throws it back onto Dean’s desk.
Dean reaches inside his jacket, pulling out the journal. "Before he died, he gave me coordinates. Found this."
He strides towards the shop, having to push against the crowd fleeing from the scene. He comes to a stop at the body of Samandriel, face down and hair mopped in blood.
"Well maybe you need to stop depending on someone who's left the profession to make it look as though
He’s a few paces away, when someone emerges from the pub. Cas stumbles to a halt, hairs on his neck prickling. Alastair watches him, coolly.
“Get out of my house,” is the first thing that manages to fight from Castiel’s lips. He takes a deep breath.
Cas is still staring at him. He speaks, quietly. Dean takes a few steps forward. “Maybe. But I don’t want to make assumptions.” He stares at Dean. “And I don’t want you to get into danger.”
“Relax,” Jody soothes, fingers on his arm tightening, grounding him. “He's here. We’re all safe. Take it easy, you had a rough time.” She lets go, knowing how much Dean will actually heed her words.
“Secondly, they have to have a following. There is only so much destruction one Wizard or Witch can cause without garnering the attention of other magic creatures to stop them. Their power lies in numbers.”
“But what if they come for us, too?” A girl in the back pipes up, her voice wobbling. A few concerned murmurs pass themselves along the classroom. He frowns.
To his surprise, Cas leans and slides his hands behind Dean's back and wraps his arms around him, holding him tight. Dean freezes at the motion.
Jack nearly drops it completely, but at least the risk of the pencil carving 'car' into the table had decreased significantly.
Dean was a little surprised just by how many people did turn up. Pastor Jim, whom he'd not seen since he and Sammy were kids, Rufus, some other oldies. Most of them made remarks about how he was a good man, and it was a 'shame what Mary's death did to him.' He and Sammy could only exchange knowing looks.
Dean clenches his fists, nails digging in his palm.  Azazel shifts slightly, and Dean nearly startles before realising that Azazel had pulled out a...guitar?
As soon as the door closes, Castiel takes a moment to close his eyes, and breathe deeply. They’d planned for this situation. He could handle this. He had to. Squaring his shoulders, Castiel marches into the living room.
"I know exactly what I'm talking about." Dean continues, ignoring Cas for the moment. "Every time trouble happens you're
Bobby looks at him quickly with a glare. "Hold yer horses, boy. Let me finish." He turns the stove off, the steam curling into the paint cracked ceiling. "'Course I had an idea. One of the first things that happened  after the fire was John bringing you boys here."
He grabs his broom and throws a spare one to Cas, who catches it with one hand. The students erupt into cheers.
Jo passes Dean a wink as she places the drinks down in front of the men.  Dean smirks at her, but it drops when he looks over to him. Jo still flashes Castiel a smile, before wandering off with the empty tray. Dean shrugs with one shoulder.
much the case for students, and rather less so for staff. They have their own duties to attend to, Michael.”
Jack looks from Dean, to the hand, before tentatively raises his own small hand and bats it against Dean’s larger palm. Dean grins. Castiel feels warmth blossom in his chest, paired with relief. Jack really seems to enjoy it here, at least.
The wind is knocked out of him as they both collide, brooms tangling between each other. The force stops their flight completely and they fall towards the ground, capes wrapping around their shoulders and heads. Growling, Dean pushes at Cas, and in their tumble they spin round and round each other, and Dean wonders when they’ll—
Cas swims into mind, pinned underneath Lucifer, bloody. Unconscious. He visions his own hands, covered in blood.  He drops Chuck.
“Yes, yes, of course. I just wanted to go back over the details. Lucifer has been… rather silent since the attack in Hastings. I understand your difficulty with the Dementors, but I do think it best to keep them. If only I could get away with that closer to the Ministry.” Chuck sighs, longingly. “Obviously the tournament is a prime target for any attacks - as the main challenges being out in the grounds.”
They stumble down the stairs, both coughing, and Sam suddenly begins to resist as they near the door "My notes, my notes--"
Writing this chapter there were two songs I had on repeat, and I'd recommend listening to them as you're reading for extra feels!
A low, loud rumble shakes the street, crunching rubble bursting through the rain. Cas closes his eyes as flashes of falling bricks and still children cross his mind, before people start pushing past him. He turns around.
When Lucifer is safely out of sight, Cas pulls Jack towards him in a tight hug, letting out a deep sigh. He looks up at Dean.
“I found Michael trying to interrogate Cas here the other night,” Sam comments, as they walk across the suspension bridge. Dean turns to look at him with a frown.
“I, uh—I was there, with Sammy. Visitin’ our mom’s grave. We saw you not far from us visitin’ one too, and I got curious, but didn’t wanna disturb you. I went and had a look afterwards and realised it would’ve been Jack’s mom.”
Jack's not even looking at him, too busy trying to grasp a rebellious piece of Lego. He sighs hard at Cas, as though
He is within leaping distance of the snitch when he feels the air shift around him, only to have enough time to look to his right and roll under his broom as Cas charges above him. Grunting, Dean rolls himself back upright, growling at the Professor.
The security guard blinks at him slowly, and rummages in the tiny desk he's sat behind for a few moments, before pulling out a clipboard with some names. "Yeah, storage container six. Just down the way."
The quill scratches on the thick parchment. Professor Singer sits at his desk, pausing for a moment to dip the quill in the ink. His penmanship is slow, and a little shaky, but trained.
"So," Crowley starts, and opens the top drawer of his desk. He pulls out another envelope, already sealed. "Let's do a deal."
“Yes, Michael?” He questions, once the other has come within earshot. Michael comes to a stop, and watches him for a moment.
charm on the end of his wand but is staring off into the water. Dean looks up, warily. It’s clear, besides the eons of stars scattered across the sky.
Sam, Dean and Claire all scatter in suppressed panic to a respective station. Dean immediately grabs onto a glass beaker and finds himself staring at the ingredients, unable to clear his mind free. He can hear Claire swearing beside him, and ignores his ‘teacher instinct’ to threaten a loss of house points for foul language.
They're stood in the middle of the quidditch pitch; he, Sam, and Claire, all throwing their gear on. Despite facing Sam his gaze flickers to the right of him, seeing Claire in his peripheral. Jody is hovering around her like some sort of constipated Hen, and Claire is just staring at the ground, a frown on her face. Dean's seen that 'I want you to get out of my face but I’ll probably be expelled if I open my mouth’ look all too often.
