. There was another person beneath this false front, this facade that Sherlock had molded into his own. He was a man with a life, not just a plaything for this creature of the wood. Anger bubbled in his chest each day he repeated his name to himself.
I returned to the inn and decided to entertain the steam room as a means to relax and reorder my thoughts, and now I am sitting near the hearth with my pipe. Perhaps I will go speak with the constable about the disappearance and attempt to gather more information, as he was the one who sent for me in the first place. The rest of the villagers seem wary of me, sharing very little if any information. This evening I will endeavour to patronize the local pub as a means to win them over.
. Enjoy…,” he gestured vaguely at John’s jersey and shrugged. Without another word, he sidestepped John and stalked away.
Flashing him a brief smile, I take his hands and stand, towering over him. “Yes, I was there when it happened,” I remind him, glancing pointedly down at my bandaged thigh. He huffs out a chuckle, patting me on the shoulder before reaching behind himself to grab my clothing, thrusting it at my chest.

, on the floor near the pool, bringing my knees to my chest and wrapping my arms around them while I rock side to side, shudder involuntarily. My chest feels tight with agony as the pit in my stomach grows hot with rage-filled sorrow.
“None going home with you today, boys?” the middle aged woman behind the counter asked, as she always did when they came to visit. “Redbeard has his eyes on you, Sherlock,” she added, nodding over at the Irish Setter.

“Do you wish to test me?” He returned to his chore, the sounds of his axe echoing around the black trees of the forest. I lingered a moment longer, then turned on my heel and walked back to the village to document my findings here.
Along my stroll through the village back to the inn, I passed the local market filled with servants and maidens bartering for items to make their supper. Unfortunately, the village is of a size that each person recognizes the other, and newcomers such as myself draw exaggerated attention. The moment I entered the edge of the market to become acquainted with their customs and wares, the townspeople fell quiet except for their hushed conversations about
He shook his head and rolled onto his side, letting the blankets bunch up at his chest. Gripping a fistful, he buried his face into the down pillow he took from his grandmother’s house all those years ago and scowled, fighting the sting in the corners of his eyes.
“Of course I expected this, Sherlock. The doctor indicated you would wake soon, and I knew once you did Dr. Watson would finally allow himself to rest,” Mycroft replies coolly, making a show of picking a piece of lint off his suit sleeve.
“Don’t be
I hear the flap of the paper being unfolded and the cough from John before he starts reading in a tired monotone, working to keep the tune out of his voice as he recognizes the song:
The trashcan flies across the smoking area with the force of my kick, slamming noisily against the opposite wall. Three quick strides and I’m over there, denting it repeatedly. The sound echoes off the sides of the building, ricocheting the racket across the courtyard and startling the other smokers. They hastily extinguish their cigarettes and scurry inside, but I barely notice as I unleash every ounce of rage I feel on the bin at my feet.
Following my walk in the village, I enjoyed some time in the sauna to gather my thoughts and prepare myself for a meeting with the constable, a man by the name of Dimmock. He is a wafish man, thin and sickly looking with a voice pitched higher than I expected. Although he was the one who requested my assistance, he seemed annoyed with my presence, dictating to me the various things he’s done to investigate and asserting that there was no more to be done about it. I assured him that I would inevitably prove him wrong, which earned me a short tempered glare and a curt “guten Nachmittag” (good afternoon). Had you been present, you might have reminded me to mind my manners. Instead, I smiled broadly and tipped my hat, again assuring him that I would have answers by the third day of my holiday in his humble town, despite his insistence that it was futile. One of his deputies ushered me out shortly thereafter, entreating me to avoid their offices in the future.
No, that’s incorrect.
name.”
“John,” he finally begins, voice firm with determination. My heart leaps into my throat, pulse pounding in my ears.
John seems like he might be happy this way. Or, at the very least, not depressed. The last time I saw him truly happy, it was after we had solved the Baskerville case. We returned to the inn in Dartmoor after helping Henry get home, and John immediately ordered us a couple of pints and plopped down in one of the wing chairs by the fire. He gestured with his head at the seat across from him and smiled at me, his shoulders dropping with relief.
The moment Sherlock opened his clouded eyes, murmuring into the crook of John's neck while shoving a leg between his thighs, though, it was gone.
“Sherlock--”
Day 2 (continued)

Another rush of crippling pain shoots into my back, arcing down my legs with a horrific spasm. I’m gasping, choking on my own saliva as Charles kicks me a few more times in my lower back, the point of his shoe colliding with my kidneys. He pauses to laugh with Moran as a guttural, pained cry erupts from me, ending on a sob as I choke back tears.
“John,

She nods and smiles, glancing at the cabinet next to the stove. “I can protect myself if necessary, John. Don’t you boys worry about me.”
. Speaking to my feet, I respond, “Just a panic attack.”
My thoughts, sluggish with the morphine, drift lazily around each other. They resemble curls of cigarette smoke, thick with incoherent substance. Occasionally I pick out an image or feeling, and they are all related to my sleeping companion. Our exchange earlier was overwhelming, full of the unsaid words we aren’t yet comfortable exposing to each other. I was exasperated with myself--I’d been mentally rehearsing everything I need to tell him as I traveled back to London and when the moment came, my mind betrayed me. I could see his discomfort, his unease. He was holding back, keeping his true reactions from me. At times I wished to reach out and demand the truth of him, yet I knew...
He considers his tea, despite it being clearly too hot, and sighs. More toying with the thread beneath his fingers, more clenching and unclenching of his jaw. I make my observation of him no secret, gaping openly with the hopes that it will draw his gaze from the floor. He takes another deep breath and lets it out between his pursed lips, and finally I cannot take it anymore.
Panic Attacks
“I’m...I just…,” he trails off, at a loss for words. He rolls onto his back next to me, staring up at the ceiling and sighing in exasperation with himself. “I just--”
If you have a LOT of questions right now, don't worry! All will be made clear.
I declined to thank him for his company, as he was useless.
.” I don’t bother keeping the loud moan from crawling out of my throat, my eyes sliding shut involuntarily while my knees wobble under his touch. He takes it as an invitation to start trailing wet, open-mouthed kisses along my jawline, his fingers tightening in my curls to hold me still against his onslaught.
“Mrow!” the cat complained, his ears falling flat against his head as he saw John.
He flashes a knowing smile, hidden in the corners of his lips. “You can’t bear what, Sherlock?” he whispers, breathless and ending on a grimace.
Pulling out my phone to check the time, I reply, “Isn’t that what autopsies are for?” before striding away.
I think.
“You’re remembering something,” Sherlock comments cautiously, breaking me out of my flashback. “Please, John. I need as many details as you can provide.” He leans forward, face serious and tone dark.
“Music would probably help,” he interrupts, looking away. “Associations and all that.”
” the creature asked, drawing out the words. The only part of him that moved was his mouth, the rest of him frozen.
I meet his eye briefly before looking towards Sherlock, watching his chest flutter up and down. “A statement? Look, it was self-defense. You can see me, you know what he did to me. He had just shot Sherlock, what was I supposed to do?”
“John, I’m telling you, if you don’t let him go I’m going to have to intervene.

. How could I be such an idiot, hoping that perhaps this solid, angry, gorgeous man standing here would ever be interested in
, even. The thought sparks something inside me as Mycroft turns to leave, a storm of doubts and worries about this new version of our...relationship.
“Promise!” Barely a breath.
“Not really…” John sighed. His neighborhood was anything but fancy. But who was he to complain…
John swallowed but didn't avoid Greg's eyes.
familiar dark rumbling laughter emerged from behind it, mixed with giggles in high pitched voices. Unmistakably Miss Pirate, apparently in the company of fellow dancers; talking and laughing as if nothing out of the ordinary had just happened.
“I missed my stop.” John therefore said.
After a while, Sherlock started to take cases again. Short and easy ones at first, the more difficult ones after regaining some confidence. Sometimes he would take John along, but sometimes he wouldn’t, even when John had nothing else to do, no shift at the surgery, no social calls, no anything.
A memory, a picture, him sitting on the edge of his bed, just woken, staring down at his arm. Something had felt wrong. Not the marks, they were expected. What didn't fit in the picture? At that time Sherlock hadn't been able to grasp it, mind fogged, body wrecked. Now though, realisation dawned. It was true. The arm. The wrong arm. The right arm, he never used the right arm. His dominant arm. Too important. Couldn't risk it. Experiments, the violin…
"Can we maybe not do that,
All that was left in his head was war. War, war and more war. And he highly doubted his trauma would be an enticing subject for verbal foreplay — “Hey, want to polish my gun?” wouldn't be quite the appealing pick up line, he gathered. Apparently, not only his gun had gotten rusty...
? He didn’t take long to further think about it though; didn’t even make it to his bed before his hand was flying over his cock and mental pictures of a handsome hot guy from next door were flooding his mind. That voice... GOD... That voice!!! That guy could bring him off just talking to him. A heady mix of adrenaline and endorphins rushed through his veins and sent John’s pleasure spiralling up and up until he came harder than he had come in ages, his release painting his trousers and the floor underneath his desk, even splashing some drops on the keyboard of his laptop; the website with search results for “phone sex London” still opened.
He lay there, panting, trying to get his breath back under control. For a blissful moment his mind wiped out, the world turned black.
John remained silent and Sherlock started to feel uneasy. He got fidgety, didn’t know what to do with himself. Could John please start speaking again, no matter if he was only berating him. After a while John pulled out his phone and started fiddling with it. It took him some time, he just kept scrolling and looking.
When the waiter called him “Here you go, mate!” he turned around and expected something of a hot dog like snack. Instead the waiter pushed a paper cup in his waiting hand, as if this was the most common thing to do, when sausage with bread was ordered. John looked confused, but he had no time to waist and at least – as he hoped – it was something edible in that weird mug he now owned. One quick look and he had confirmed pieces of something looking like sausage in a don’t-know-but probably-edible sauce and some kind of bread-roll sticking out of the mug. Very well then, this had to do! Throwing some coins on the counter he dashed out of the snack bar, hurrying after Sherlock, who had stopped at a corner, hiding and cautiously gleaming across the street.
As always, forever, I'm eternally grateful for my invaluable betas and friends and lifesavers
“Our sweet and lovely, tea making, scones baking, not your housekeeper Mrs Hudson?” John gaped.
“Git.” he countered affectionately, as was their habit. It felt good to have things being ‘theirs’ again. Not long ago John had thought he had lost that for good. Sherlock grinned at him as if trying to erase that memory.
He thought back to everything he had witnessed inside that building, out of reach now, deep dark waters flowing steadily and infinitely between them. He wished he could go back there, to those moments, turn back time! He would change so many things. Uncountable things. All the way back to their very first encounter. That though, was the only thing he wouldn't want to change for the world… meeting Sherlock. Meeting Sherlock had been the best thing that could have possibly happened to him. And he had kicked it with his feet over and over again. He had hurt Sherlock in so many ways he only now realised. 'I can't stand it anymore' Sherlock had said. John could see why. But Sherlock had also said 'It isn't your fault. It's all me'. Why did he think that? Just then it sunk in, that that too was John's fault. How often had he blamed Sherlock, for everything actually. Most of all the fall. Again and again the fall. This had to stop. They had to move on. Just not the way Sherlock was implying. Because… just look at them. They couldn't do it, not now. Not alone.
To see Sherlock this happy and unrestrained after all those challenging and straining last weeks, most of all after the night before, filled John with hope that they had survived this storm without too much damage and with the confidence that they'd manage to sail any troubled waters ahead of them. They'd start over new without ever forgetting their wonderful whirlwind beginning.
“I think I'll take that risk.” John contered without hesitation, a fierceness and determination within him he hadn’t felt since his rugby days.
you faked it, Sherlock. I wanna know
I had drugs on me, which I
“No, John. This is Sherlock.”
“I get it now,” John said, soothingly. “I understand.”
“Why are you angry?” Sherlock asked and turned his head, watching John.
He swallowed. And swallowed. Tried to speak. But didn't succeed. In the end.
He needed to let go of the past, but he didn’t want to abandon it. It had brought him here. No past, no John. He needed to re-evaluate, to re-arrange. Find a way to include the good things of the past into the new version of himself. There had to be a new him.
The story Sherlock is thinking of while walking back to Baker Street is from a children's book that is very dear to me. It's called "Momo" written by Michael Ende. Check it out:
“You assumed damn right then.” He nodded. He set his tea cup back on the table trying to hide the tremor in his hand. “So… he… it worked then? He… he heard it?” He asked nervously. Dread and hope and embarrassment fighting and roiling in his stomach. When Mycroft only nodded slightly and no other information came forth, John frowned.
Red blotches started blooming and spread all over Sherlock’s cheeks and neck and chest. His breathing sped up a bit and his lips parted. ‘
!!” John gestured wildly at his head. Horrified.
“Come on, go on you!” John couldn’t help laughing at this point. “I won’t interrupt anymore.”
"Angelo! I didn't even order it."
John.
As reaction John gripped Sherlock's arse and bucked his own hips forwards, pressing their groins tightly together. Sherlock couldn't help but do the same and the friction confirmed that John was just as affected as Sherlock was himself. Feeling John's hardening cock against his own through much too many layers of fabric made Sherlock gasp.
“You do look like you'd need something stronger.”
"Are you sure…," Mycroft started, not caring for Sherlock's defensiveness.
Sherlock raised his head and propped himself on his forearm.
? Found
Still buzzed, he was blinded when the screen lit up, but squinting his eyes he reached his goal to focus on the screen, get into his inbox and find Sherlock's mail with a few clicks.
While John made his way through the tunnels of the underground station to catch the next train in time, they didn’t speak much. Actually, they didn’t speak at all and John startled when Scott’s dark sonorous voice suddenly came from the speaker still pressed against his ear. Had he walked all the way, a mobile phone pressed against his ear without saying a single word? What was he? A bloody teenager? Jeez…
“No, I mean it, mate. Not seen you like this for, well… quite a while.” Greg said, a bit uneasy but serious. "Bad news?" Greg nodded towards the now closed laptop.
"So…" John said, stretched, intent, determined.
been directed at him. That was the only reason why Sherlock had even bothered to add a link to the email. It was the song he had had in mind immediately after listening to John’s music on the USB device. So... it's… sending messages by songs between them now? Was that code for something?
"Is that why you called me a prostitute?" he asked defensively.
John sighed relieved, pulled Sherlock’s face closer. Sherlock’s eyes widened in alarm but John aimed for his forehead and pressed a heartfelt kiss to it. He released Sherlock’s face only to jump to his feet and immediately grab Sherlock's hand to pull him up too. Without waiting another second he rushed towards the door leading to the stairway, a confused Consulting Detective in his wake.
John cringed. “Sherlock…”
With this in mind he made his way inside, which he could have done blindly by now. But as he reached the hiding place of his belongings he cursed. Being angry with himself he picked up his needed items.
He tried to push back this train of thought. This wasn’t part of the plan. Imagining things that weren’t real wouldn’t bring him any step closer to the solution of this problem. Which was still very much present, as he now noticed.
The winking though, John. Not the punctuation faces.
He took a deep steadying breath and continued his path.
John had admitted that he only had that blog because of Sherlock in the first place, right? So it wasn’t actually just Sherlock who had been caught secretly pining for his flatmate… Sherlock smirked.
Finally Mycroft said quietly: “And did you discuss this decision with your dear doctor?”
the Greg in his mind said over and over.
He literally jumped up from his chair to grab his laptop. He had to do research. That's the way he always started a case. With facts.
was just a disguise, too, an armour, as so many other things concerning this man calling himself a high functioning sociopath. But that wouldn't explain… John would have never expected...
The song… oh no… the song…
or not, but decided against it for now. If Sherlock wanted him to only read it, he would do so. For now. He could still listen to it later. And he started reading...
He didn't wait. No, he didn't. He didn't wonder either, if this was it. Four texts. Actually more than enough if he was honest. Especially because he wouldn't read them anyway. The morning merged into noon and he still didn't wonder. He also wasn't disappointed or sad that John had given up after four.
From here on the chapters are going to be a bit longer. And when I say a bit... well... I'm sorry? It was not within my power though, the boys just demanded a bit more space for drama. Sherlock in particular felt neglected in his role as World's Most Dramatic Drama Queen. What was I supposed to do? *shrug emoji*
“nogayloveinteresteither,” Sherlock mumbled.
“An amazing arse then?” Sherlock teased, grinning.
God, how could he not have realised? How? All this time.
“But, you know… that email. It was… it felt an awful lot like…,” he lowered his voice to give it a mock ironic touch “...’we-could-still-be-friends’...,” he tried to chuckle but the sadness in his eyes undermined all his efforts.
Still, he did his best to let him go. He had to. Everything he had tried had failed. What else was he supposed to do? The more than clear message, that his attempts to contact Sherlock weren’t appreciated should have been enough to stop him. Nonetheless, he tried to grasp at every weak straw to prevent himself from drowning. He had asked Greg if he knew any way to contact Sherlock that John hadn't tried yet. But Greg had only shook his head and avoided his gaze, quite sheepishly now that John recalled it, and had told him, “No, sorry mate, not any more.” That had been it. Ruled out, too.
“Sherlock,” he grabbed Sherlock’s wrist, “wait! Experience and expertise and whatnot… you can’t use that on your ‘manly’ legs just so! That’s… insane!”
"It got easier each time I said it until I internalised it at some point. And the easier it got the more it hurt Harry. At the end there, I could just as well have kicked her with my feet, already lying on the ground and bleeding." He shifted in Sherlock's arms, drinking in their closeness, scarcely able to believe that Sherlock still held him… tender, loving… as if he was worth it. "And to top it all off, I kept blaming her for her alcohol abuse and her anger issues, never openly acknowledging my own problems. There's a pattern, you see? I'm a coward." He noticed that Sherlock's hands had halted their wandering, arms encircling his shoulders, the thumb of Sherlock's left hand cautiously moving over the scar of the bullet wound in a careful caress.
Breath shallow.
... in which John is confused and concerned, John is doubting and delighted, a hope is fulfilled and an illusion shattered...
“But… why?” John was still puzzled. They had both seemed so… blown away by each other. John had to confess though
He had almost succeeded in convincing himself that this was acceptable, when Miss Pirate suddenly changed her tactic. She sauntered and flaunted herself on and off the stage, following the weird tendrils from one side to the other like weaving a net. She criss-crossed the stage, each time she passed the pole she took hold and swung herself around it, leaving the audience in breathless and restless anticipation as to which part of the room she would bless with her attention next.
His scrotum started to tighten, his balls drawing up. The free hand traveled up to where it had started, wanted to cover his mouth, hinder the noises from escaping.
it echoed in his mind.
"You brought coffee." Sherlock's low voice broke the silence.
John was bitter.
"You can't know about next year…"
He sat on the sofa, closed his eyes, oblivious to everything around him, going back to a place in his head void of air, descending to the darkest depths of his mind…
would never hurt as much as one of the curly hairs on Miss Lamentory's pretty head. And she's
“What happened to ‘The two of us against the rest of the world’?” John called after Sherlock’s retreating back. “What about the thrill of  the chase? About the blood pumping through our veins? That’s all over and done with?”
"I won’t, Sherlock. I won’t ever give up, never again. We already wasted so much time! I will never…" breathing, quick, shallow, close to the speaker, "No, Sherlock. I won't give up."
There had been only one antidote to that kind of torture, and Sherlock had known it. There had been no way he could have stayed dead. No way he could have lived a life without John Watson at his side. Not after he'd had a taste of what it felt like to be such a great man’s best friend.
His hands shaking from barely manageable self-restraint, he hammered his fingertips on the screen to dial a by now well known number. When he only got transferred to the voicemail, he would have loved to throw his phone across the room. He briefly closed his eyes, took a deep breath. And started to type.
“Good,” John nodded. “That’s… good.” he said, copying Sherlock's own earlier reaction to show that he had understood, too. He looked down for a moment and up again, smiled to himself. “Yeah, really good actually…”
Carefully yet focused he made his way up the stairs. Intentionally not avoiding the one creaking step. The sound filled him with the tender feeling of coming home and the excitement of a new beginning.
"Calm down, genius," he chuckled, "no need to panic. I didn't know either."
kind of girl from? Was she British or had he bought her somewhere abroad? She did look slightly Asian? No, too tall, Eastern Europe maybe?
"You're new here," the man said, eyeing John assessingly. "Who are you?" he asked with unhidden suspicion and disdain.
How could his determination only have lasted this briefly? He had to get it back. He was weak. He had never been weak. At least he had never wanted to be weak. And after the last slip he had managed fairly well. But now…
she had been there, helped him, seen him. She had witnessed on the front line what he was capable of. What he had done. To John. What he was doing again. She had said herself, that she had seen John suffering, saw him suffering now, knowing that it was Sherlock who had done that to him. And still, she had come here, deliberately to tell him to move things on with John. She told him not to hurt John again… and encouraged him to get closer nonetheless? She trusted him to get this right? Despite everything?
at the end. There was a rather big time gap between the first flood of texts and this one. Did it even belong to the rest? Or was it out of context? Still, John couldn't grasp the meaning.
"That was then. This is now." Is actually such a small thing to say but had such a surprisingly (for me) great impact! It stayed with me ever since I read it in
How they had managed to break through those walls now, John wasn't quite sure. It felt so sudden, although it had actually been a long time coming, John guessed. Piling up until they finally caved in. And it was
being half naked, in his mind devouring and being devoured by the man now standing in front of him while said man was watching him. Sherlock blushed furiously at the thought alone. He forced himself to not avoid John’s gaze and saw the bastard smirk. Damn, he knew exactly what went through Sherlock’s mind.
John caught a glance at Sherlock's shopping basket and frowned.
"YES!!!"
"Yes," John answered in a whisper, holding all the wonder Sherlock himself was experiencing.
John tried to breathe calmly through his nose; the pulse thumping in his ears creating more a dubstep-like sound than the buoyant tune of the pirate theme. No longer sitting on the barstool because that was impossible, he watched enthralled what would come next and barked out an actual laugh when Miss Pirate suddenly pulled out a Jolly Roger—the black flag that was the last detail that marked her as a proper pirate… skull and crossed bones and all—which she apparently had hidden underneath the back of her corset and skirt.
All John wanted was to rush after him, but he tugged on that warm hand in his and pulled the man back.
He'd do everything for this man.
"Come on," Sherlock said and ran his fingers through John's greying hair, "let's get that shower,
PLEASE!
“Yeah, okay…” John laughed, and realised they had indeed reached the next stop. “At your command!” He said joyfully and followed Scott’s instructions.
"I think…" John said, a bit breathless, "I can make an exception for this one. Dig as deep as you want…"
“John,” he felt his insides curl in on themselves, trying to hide away even though he was exposed like never before, “you know the consequences of this emotional state I'm in. You’re aware of what I’m likely to do when I’m out of my depth
The moment John Watson slumped into the back seat of the cab he threw the door shut behind him and closed his eyes, leaning his head on the backrest.
John's inner voice, slowed down as the rest of him, finally objected. ‘
John all but tumbled off the bed and scuttled over to the bathroom. Quickly he snatched everything he needed and rushed back to their bedroom to find Sherlock in the same position, legs splayed wide, displaying himself, but his eyes closed and taking steadying breaths. John could relate all too much.
“So, you see, the favour I’m asking for isn’t even for myself and it is
"John. That doesn't make any sense."
“Don’t know if it’s wise to reveal such private information to…”
Lost in thought he was startled by a scratching and scrunching. At first he thought of rats seeking shelter in the abandoned building the same way he did. He scanned the dusted floor next to him when he realised that it was the noise of nearing footsteps in the dust. Shit, he should have known that this place had security and got checked regularly. Of course they would secure a place like this. Homeless and squatters taking over vacant buildings was a common problem in London after all. Maybe it was one of those. Or was someone looking for him? Greg? No, why would he? He hastily shuffled backwards into the shadows. Either way, he felt absolutely no desire whatsoever to be discovered and to have to explain his presence.
(also linked the relevant chapter). Making use of creative license though I put it in the mouth of someone other than in the fic, but nonetheless it was written with said fic in mind...
"So… you… are you… do you…"
“Mmhmm, of course I do. That’s the whole point, yeah?” John stopped them in front of the bath and pulled the shower curtains open. When he turned to look at Sherlock again the eagerness from before seemed to have subsided, shifted into tensed uncertainty. Anxiousness started to coil in John’s guts. What was wrong? Had he unknowingly crossed a line already? Sherlock had seemed to be as willing as John was. Had he misjudged the situation? No. No, he was certain he hadn’t. But then… what?
At the corner of Baker Street he stopped his stride, nerves suddenly prickling up his neck and over his scalp. Looking diagonally across the street he could see Speedy's red awning. Impressive how different such a simple sight can feel. Not long ago in the rain it had felt like desperation and dread, a few days later it had felt like loss and emptiness. Now though, it felt like hope, like confidence, like a thousand bees buzzing through his body.
"First of all it's 'friend with benefits' what they call it these days, if that's what you mean at least," John hissed back and heard an adorably grumpily mumbled 'ridiculous term' in the background, which almost broke his temper again. Only almost though, that's why he went on with his rant. John was glad he had just left the bus. He took a deep breath of London air and set out to leave the last few metres to his flat behind him. "And second," he continued while walking, "if I remember correctly it's you who meant to tell me about my not so urgent sex drive and rubbed in that I'm all alone, yeah? So why would I suddenly have a friend with benefits, huh?"
“Because you're just adorable when you’re annoyed.” Sherlock rumbled.
“You should have been more careful and more precise in your announcement, then.” John smirked, immensely enjoying the direction the events were taking. He ran a finger over the smooth skin of Sherlock’s jaw. “If I’m not mistaken then
are the one shaving twice a day because you can’t stand the itch of stubble and the feeling of your chin catching on your scarf. Mister Sensitive-skin-all-labels-must-be-removed-or-I-wear-my-shirts-inside-out.”
John huffed a small breath through his nose. Nodding once he said, “Right. Right, yes. Yes, of course you're right, Greg. I'm just being silly.” He raised his glass to blame the liquor.
Big squishy cuddles for everyone who's reading and following "my" idiots on their journey, for leaving kudos and/or comments, for bookmarking. It means a lot to me and makes my little writer's heart jump for joy!!! 💜
good. You keep implying that it will be for the best, but what if it’s not? I don’t want to hurt you!” Sherlock said, getting agitated.
"No, I think, you really can't." said Sherlock flatly.
"I can ease your mind, I don't particularly like tucking either. If possible, I try to avoid it." Sherlock seemed to avoid John's eyes when he pulled one peculiar garment out of the pile. It was a kind of slip with skin coloured female bits attached to it on the front. John raised one eyebrow.
"Captain?" Miss Pirate addressed him cautiously.
The corset was decorated with metal buttons and refined embroidery and hung with solid chains. According to the theme of the arrangement a small sabre was hanging from a thin leather belt slung around that fragile waist, directing John's gaze to the perfectly pronounced backside by bouncing slightly against it. John began sweating the moment he discovered even a pair of ancient looking handcuffs fixed to a ring at the hip.
“Hey,” he said, softly. “What’s up? Something wrong?”
“Great.” John said with a big smile on his face. “And for the correctness, we take photo evidence just so you can’t twist the facts to your own liking, mister!”
Sherlock whirled out of his chair and, to John's immense regret, pulled his dressing gown around himself and tied the belt to close it.
“You!” It sounded like a command. It
Sighing he looked up; dusk had already settled upon London's roofs. When had that happened? He checked his watch and frowned perplexedly. It was late already, he had even missed his favourite pre-primetime sitcom. The one he didn’t even remember the name of. That one with those...people and that city. Nevermind.
“Is he… I mean… is he up?” John asked with a mix of emotions in his voice Sherlock couldn’t quite fathom at this point.
“Sherlock,” John gently admonished him, walking over to put their plates on the table. He had found some sausages in their fridge that miraculously hadn't passed their expiration date yet and had settled on beans and sausage and toast, which was only fit for human consumption because it was browned and soaked in butter. “Come on, indulge me. Go on. Impress a boy.” He leaned over and pressed a short and soft kiss on Sherlock’s cheek. John saw him glancing sidewards at him, before he inhaled deeply and started to rattle off the information he had gathered through Lestrade's mail.
John had to actually giggle at that.
“Well, that means...” Scott purred, “... no ripping.”
"..."
He breathed shallowly, her finger kept drawing small circles along the seam of his scar. None of their other muscles moved.
John whimpered, he couldn’t stand this, this was torture and Sherlock knew it. Dammit! He was unable to do anything but stare and wait and try not to come in his pants this instant.
After a moment he heard some shuffling from inside and a faint shimmer appeared in the headlight. The lock clicked, the door opened and Mrs Hudson appeared half hiding, clutching her dressing gown shut in front of her chest.
She moved her fingers to the top button of his shirt and flipped the first button through the hole. John shivered, even though he could burst from the heat rising to his face, fully aware of the small patch of skin revealed by his open collar. When no rejection came, Miss Pirate seemed to be encouraged and made work of the other buttons, cherishing each new bit of skin laid free by running her short but well-manicured nails, painted in the same deep purple shade as her lipstick, across his skin, causing shivers all over his body.
Sherlock didn't realise the soft smile spreading on his lips. The corners of his eyes crinkled in affectionate amusement and his heartbeat accelerated smoothly as if lifted by a warm summer breeze.
"I'd say so, yeah…" Greg agreed. "You… okay then? Should we… dunno, stay up a bit? Still some beer in the fridge…" Greg inspected his friend with concern, but John could sense the wish for a soft pillow and sweet dreams on him.
"I told you, but did you listen?" the other man sing-songed.
“Is that it?” John asked.
, his nasty mind added spitefully.
Jeez… he wished he would be able to kick his own ass!
Sherlock knew it before he felt it.
John frowned. What had he missed? When it hit him, he squeezed his eyes shut and groaned. God, he was so used to his name being... well… his name, that he didn’t immediately draw the connection to… other meanings that were given to the word.
"No. Oh my god…" he tried to catch his breath, holding onto the pole next to him for some desperately needed support. "Christ no," he said, shaking his head, an incredulous grin still on his lips. "I fully agree. No bestiality for me either."
“John, dear?” came her warm and lovely but now also concerned voice from downstairs.
“What’s holding you back, Sherlock?” Whispered but forceful.
“Well, I’ll just…” He said, pointing towards the bathroom, “I’ll go take a shower, will take a while though...”
“I feel a bit like shite.” He said, voice still raspy. “A lot like shite actually. I think I had a bit too much yesterday.”
“Sherlock, honestly! Trust me! We
And he came, pictures of Sherlock, bare chested, flexing muscles, sunbathed skin flashing through his mind. John's upper body jerked up from the force of his orgasm, pulling the blanket along, which slithered from his shoulders and pooled in his lap. The sudden wave of chilly air engulfing him tore and tugged on the corners of his awareness, not yet fully capable of uncovering and clearing his mind and senses.
"I don't know what exactly is great about it, but it means I have to
"No… Love."
How could life be this cruel? The very moment he realised he wanted nothing more than to be at this extraordinary man’s side unconditionally, to share his life indefinitely, the opportunity was ripped away under his waiting hands once again. Why was it that he had to let go over and over again. All he wanted was to get a new chance! A second chance? A third? He had lost count. And this time not because he thought it was his one option, his one way to carry on, to survive. No, this time it was a conscious decision, this was out of his own free will, out of commitment, out of acknowledgement… out of… well… out of love!
Sherlock never took his eyes off John who had now taken to the sparse chest hair. He especially took his sweet time with the fuzz of scattered hairs around Sherlock’s small deeply red nipples. It wasn’t exactly necessary, but John enjoyed how Sherlock’s breath hitched when he grazed the small nubs with the buzzing and vibrating device. They hardened and stood immediately and John couldn’t resist to lean down, put his lips on one of them and suck. The hitch turned into a hiss, then turned into a moan when John added the press and the teasing touch of his tongue.
He looked down to find the all too familiar coat lying abandoned on the floor, collar turned up even in its empty solitude. John knelt to feel the fabric, to pick it up, when something small rolled out of the coat pocket and dropped onto the floor.
someone."
some of you might have spotted the reference to one of favourite johnlock fics.
“Yeah, and I don’t even dare to ask how you know.” John breathed out, defeated.
“Well, I think we’d both find that embarrassing.” Mycroft threw him a little smirk.
His hips lifted involuntary, his throbbing cock chasing more friction. The thought of a lace covered erection pressed against his own made him groan.
He groaned in frustration and glided his fingers through his curls, only to grip them hard the next moment. He couldn't remember. Why couldn't he remember anything?
John was restless. He couldn't stop his thoughts or still his mind or mute Greg's voice.
“No. What? Wait…” rustling on the line, “Why are you Greg?” he heard John slur into the speaker.
Silence. Ambient noises the melody to his heartbeat.
"Sounds like a reasonable plan." Mycroft nodded.
“Might.” Sherlock had at least the decency to look slightly guilty.
LOL LOL LOL!!!!! <3 Yeah!!
"Am," the man underneath him simply said.
"John, before I met you, I never took anyone home after a performance. That had never been the purpose or my intention. But you just assume, you never ask." Sherlock said, his voice somehow reassuring despite the reproach.
The next morning he would pretend that nothing had happened. Sipping tea in his armchair, easy conversation about nothing important at all before burying his nose in his laptop, tapping away on his blog, writing emails or whatever…
contain that particular word, it just wasn’t my primary choice to describe your reproductive organ.” The man said snootily, apparently very sure of himself. John however burst into another fit of laughter.
"Now I know why you never let it grow." he said fondly. "It's ginger."
Jenny sounded a bit more earnest.
John hadn't expected the tsunami-like wave of relief that crushed over him. Thank all the bloody Gods out there that the hell of pretending he'd wanna share his Pirate was over. A small smile cracked his mask of exasperation.
he thought. The distinction to the song he played for Sherlock on the radio blatant.
. That’s what it’s like between human beings. You can’t avoid that. Important thing is though, not to give up because of that. Because we might hurt each other, but we can talk it out, make up again. And then we keep enjoying our time together, yeah? Most likely we'll even be better afterwards. I think there’d be much more enjoying than hurting each other. Because if that’s what we both want, we can make it work! Just not run if it gets bumpy.”
When she spoke again, she sounded much calmer, much more compassionate, much more reassuring. A friend. A real friend, Sherlock realised.
he turned the term over in his head. When had he and Sherlock ever cooperated. The word tasted foul on his tongue.
These two silly notes in John's neat stocky writing, scribbled down in doctor-y haste, were more than Sherlock had ever expected to see from John again his life. And it was nearly more than he could bear.
“But…”
. He also wasn’t much interested in any tedious crap telly at the moment, he decided to just open his music account, start his favourite playlist and turn the volume up as high as possible to blow his mind free from any other thought.
When she bend forwards to him her smell took his breath away.
song for the chapter can be found
“Good.” said Sherlock firmly, as if reading John’s thoughts after all. “That’s… good.”
John lifted an innocent looking bag of strips and skin coloured tissues and cloths. Sherlock cleared his throat.
“You make it sound,” his voice, too small. A bit firmer, “you make it sound as if I deliberately chose not to talk to you… as if I don’t
"Just imagine… wouldn't it kill that lovely landlady of yours were she notified of your breakup?"
Sherlock looked puzzled, then frowned and tilted his head to look intensely at John.
"You know how he can get, John." Greg said and John just gave an understanding grunt. "He… he kept sniffing the corpses, John, and… and…," Greg shrieked, and he sounded as horrified as John had ever heard him. "John, he licked them. He
Sherlock was already standing up from his chair, making his way to the door as he stopped and silently said without even turning: “That shouldn’t be any of your concern, Mycroft.”
Enraptured, John watched—torn between fascination and fury—as Miss Pirate made defenceless men whimper, gasp, and groan; steadying herself on shoulders, sliding hands over torsos, accidentally scratching nails over nipples, leaning her bum against backrests, swaying her behind just the tad too close in front of a poor sod’s face, tracing inner seams of trousers with the tip of her toes. As often as they sensed their opportunity, greedy hands were trying their luck, most of the time failing to get what they aimed for. Nonetheless, the bouquet of banknotes grew, and to John's indescribable disapproval each single one was rewarded with a cheeky wink.
He saw how Sherlock had to recollect their conversation and was pleased to have been able to shut down the never resting machinery of Sherlock’s mind.
For a short moment John was wondering if maybe Sherlock was also hungry and wanted to share, but he dismissed that thought quite quickly. And because this was really unusual behaviour for Sherlock to let his suspect out of view that long, John started to worry a bit, there was nothing left to do than ask…
The suspicious glares from earlier had by now turned into scandalised stares, but to his own puzzlement John realised that he didn't care. Not one bit!! He seldom had had this much fun in his life, if ever. He really didn't give a fuck what the other people might think.
“Yes, you will. Your fault, you get us new shaving foam.” John nodded.
He let his eyes wander over what he was able to see from this angle, taking in the unique atmosphere of the flat; the only place that had ever felt like home.
All he had been through crashed over him, buried him, like one of these buildings struck by a bomb back in Afghanistan… it was even the same kind of fear The fear to be crushed by the unfathomable weight of it all.
As if Sherlock wouldn’t know.
“You assumed damn right then.” He nodded. He set his tea cup back on the table trying to hide the tremor in his hand. “So… he… it worked then? He… he heard it?” He asked nervously. Dread and hope and embarrassment fighting and roiling in his stomach. When Mycroft only nodded slightly and no other information came forth, John frowned.
“If you must know,” John glared at Greg, annoyed. “No!”
“Yes, I share that sentiment.” Scott stated with a sigh.
Sherlock's question deep within that still needed to be answered was: 'You're mine. Am I yours?'
“I meant what I said—I survived. Not everyone was good-natured regarding the services they thought I had to offer. There was more than one interested party who wanted to earn their money by selling my… company. I always succeeded to scare them off—quite literally sometimes. Even to fight them if they got too nasty. I always found something that was their ruin or at least hurt them enough to teach them a lesson; after a while they left me alone, you know my methods, John.” Sherlock looked a bit proud of himself. “And I’ve always,
He muttered under his breath, looking down. After a short while, he stood, walked over to where the camera was set up. For a moment, Sherlock could only see the buttons on John's crumpled checkered shirt covering his stomach, before John crouched down and Sherlock came face to face with a close up of John's face, his eyes intense.
"Alright?" a warm low voice pulled him from his hungry-just-not-particularly-for-food thoughts. He looked over his shoulder and realised that he was still holding on to Miss Pirate's arm and swiftly released it.
"It deserves the rating considering I wasn't able to narrow down the amount of ideas for its solution to three within the first 30 minutes."
Mycroft's phone. Text message. He didn't look. Sherlock knew.
we're playing correctly, then you're mine to do with as I please. Isn't that right,
“Or do you just want to listen, hmmm? Oh, you’re a kinky one, aren’t you?” Scott’s voice continued, even though John still couldn’t fathom that the voice belonged to the same man. Could voices be lent out or something? The saucy teasing grin seeping into it made it almost unbearable.
Jenny interfered.
"But you just said something about not pretending to be someone…" John wondered but was quickly interrupted by Sherlock.
The anticipation made him hasten even more, getting him slightly out of breath. At the same time, he already felt his mind quieting. But this wasn’t enough, not nearly enough. He had to get rid of all this useless and illogical nonsense to clear his mind and be able to think properly again.
“But… he
“Yes, of course, I know you have all the right to be angry. With me only ever burdening you, letting you down. I should have helped you… after Mary… let you do whatever you wanted to do. Not make you… Maybe I shouldn't have come back… And then afterwards and now… taking to old habits.” Sherlock winced a bit.
How on earth could Sherlock look this sensual, this tantalizing?
He surely hadn't expected
Sherlock turned. He stood at the window wearing his dressing gown.
Some of the guys picked a drink from the bar, John declined, and then they settled in some of the chairs at a table close to the stage. John didn’t know what to expect, but he could imagine. Not the first time he’d been to such an establishment though. But this was really not the kind of fun he had meant.
A faint memory of song snippets from earlier that day surfaced.
"I'm tired, John," she whispered.
However, not long after, he shook his head. This was starting to get really bizarre. Just the moment John had convinced him that there was no amnesia whatsoever, he had to stumble over this article? What was the ridiculously overrated universe up to. Rarely that lazy? Today it seemed to be comatose then…
“But seriously though,” John frowned and tilted his head. “Hudders?”
, coming from the nook Sherlock had emerged from. Although, not really music. More like a voice, a female voice, carrying a simple yet powerful melody. The voice seemed surprisingly young and yet it was oddly rough and mature. Only accompanied by minimalistic single piano notes.
Sherlock!” She looked at him, intensely. “Not many people come back from the death to get a second chance. Sherlock… don’t waste it.” she whispered.
Same as with the unexpected letter, Sherlock had no other choice than to let it wash over him and bear through it.
“Thank you,” came the quiet and timid response. Not a second later though, “I merely wanted to apply my new gained skills of colloquial language to gather information about it’s benefits in contrast to a more sophisticated approach of interpersonal interaction.”
"But then John, they're in fact bell-
"I have business to attend to. I'll see you at dinner and we'll discuss further proceedings." He got out and headed towards the house without waiting for Sherlock.
Lots of love,
“A song?” Greg said skeptically and looked over at him. “Like… on a record? Or what?”
He quickly contemplated, he couldn't very well reveal their true identities but he had absolutely no idea about the behavioural rules of the scene either. So he went with the first thing that came to mind, as close to the truth as possible; remembering what Sherlock used to say, "only lies have detail."
His thoughts came to a screeching halt when he saw Sherlock shrugging to himself, then reaching for his belt and starting to unbuckle it. John swallowed hard when Sherlock continued to pop open the button of his trousers and lowered the zip. The swish of the little metal teeth being forced to let go of each other seemed to roar in John's ears, echoing through his skull, causing all strings of nerves to resonate, to vibrate, to pulsate, to quiver. He blushed furiously. What was Sherlock doing? Why was he doing it? And even more important… What was John supposed to do? He felt split in two, fighting with himself. The one part was already running as fast as he was capable of, almost reached the exit, almost got away because… under no circumstances was it okay to stay and watch. Sherlock was obviously not aware of John's presence so he felt safe and alone and… well… unwatched. This was violating his privacy in the extreme! This was intruding, this was voyeurism, this was creepy, this was… not okay! He should leave! Most definitely! But the other part of him couldn't move as much as his pinkie. He couldn't leave. He just couldn't. He couldn't turn his eyes away, he couldn't stop staring. Nobody could ask that of him, could they? After all… this was Sherlock. And he couldn't leave now he had finally found him. Maybe not so much found… but… but he was there! In the flesh! And that was part of John's problem. Because what in the name of God was he doing there?
‘Angel with a shotgun’... he’d said it before. He would fight for love. For Sherlock. If that’d be what Sherlock needed. Sherlock had thought it to be foolish. Nothing to fight for, because he would never have expected… could she be right? Love? John hadn’t articulated it explicitly this way though. Was there room for misinterpretation? What was more likely… that the Bit Not Good High Functioning Sociopath would be wrong in matters of … sentiment… or Lovey Dovey Flirty Jenny? But John was so… rugby… and beer… and pub… and girlfriends. A
He thought he had been careful and subtle. It seemed however that he had been sorely mistaken. Why was he surprised anyway? Was there anything one could keep hidden from Mr. Obvious? Apparently not. One day, when John had been very innocently preparing their afternoon tea, Sherlock had startled him. They had enjoyed their companionable silence, each going their own way, doing some more or less important stuff. Or rather, nothing important whatsoever. It had been tea time, so John had got up to set their tea. As was their habit. Without any indication Sherlock’s low baritone cut through the cosy quiet of their flat.
The adorable crinkle appeared above Sherlock’s nose which usually caused some fond amusement. Although this time it made something churn in John’s belly which felt suspiciously like fury; which was most definitely not directed at Sherlock but at everything and everyone that had made this man. He might claim that he had made himself, but John was convinced that he could have been so much more—trusting, self-confident, happier—if he weren’t burdened by some nasty experiences and toxic external influences in the past. He wanted to chase them all and make them pay in every possible way for what they had done to Sherlock. However, that wasn’t possible and in no way was Sherlock going to be the one to bear his temper right now. Quite the opposite actually. John swore to himself that from now on he’d try to be the counterbalance to those experiences as best he could.
John felt tears of frustration well up, blurring his sight. Tears of helplessness. Tears of trepidation. Tears of heartache.
However, he couldn’t help but feel that it was all worth it.
“Finally.”
“Just pretend, nobody’s watching!” John said, softly. “As if I’m not here.” He searched Sherlock’s face thoughtfully, then slowly, deliberately shook his head. “No,” he said, stretching the word. “No, actually... You have to be aware that I’m here. And that I’ll stay. You have to know that I’m watching you and that I will love it.”
Alternatingly his legs were stretched outwards to his sides, long, slender. Like roots searching for ground to hold on to. His body bending over as if drawn to them, arms following the motion.
"Uhm…" John cleared his throat, gestured to the kitchen, including food and wine and
The Pirate wasn’t a pirate anymore though. High heels had given way to shiny black leather dress shoes. The costume was gone, no breasts, just a flat chest. Amazed John realised that he didn't care.
Sherlock craved to have John here with him for whatever John was willing to give. And apparently this was the one thing he was willing to give to Sherlock. That much he had understood from John’s letter.
"..."
"You're acting… strange the last couple of days."
“The order with new stock of everything will be delivered this evening.” Sherlock smirked.
John hummed contentedly and tried to come up with some perky remark — because honestly, what even was his life right now — instead, he gently drifted off while musing about it, his mind flooded with tons of endorphins and mental pictures of pale skin and long legs and lips stretched around his cock.
"No. No, probably not."
Sherlock only looked stunned at him and John didn’t wait for a response.
“What?” John pulled back and looked at Sherlock.
“I don’t even know your name.” John whispered, being sure that it wouldn’t matter anyway what the answer would be.
“All your body hair lighter than your head’s then?” John really was craving more information about the man. He was also craving a lot of other things though. Please get the hint, Scott, please...
So he had to make use of the only other method on hand - quite literally. He grabbed his phone and hammered his fingertips rapidly against the screen.
“Whenever you’re ready, Sherlock, I’ll be here. I can wait. As long as I know you’re not shutting me out, keeping it to yourself.” He was gently holding the back of Sherlock’s head now, trying to reassure and protect and support his seemingly distressed… friend? Best friend? Partner? Still that, but also so much more. His... Sherlock. Always that.
Sherlock checked his own texts, his gaze flipping back and forth between the screens of the laptop and phone before realisation dawned. Of course he had to spell it out for John. After all, he'd always be the idiot that he claimed not to be.
"As you should be."
Sending you lots of love,
“I did.” Scott said dryly.
“Exactly.” Sherlock nodded cockily but winked at John. John chuckled and for a while they just stupidly grinned at each other, before John cleared his throat and raised an eyebrow.
Not much later a fuming Sherlock threw open the door of 221b and glared daggers at John as if he was the cause of all the misery.
“Think, John. Think!” John felt almost bare under Sherlock’s scrutinising eyes. “Do you… by any chance… know...
Staring in disgust at his big brother Sherlock took a seat across from him at the other side of the table, flipping his coat dramatically while doing so.
He felt like he stopped breathing all together as he opened the door and entered the living room. He took in the state of their flat, his flat. Motionless he stood in the doorway and scanned the room, eyes the only thing moving. Items seemed randomly scattered across the floor, his music stand toppled over, sheets thrown all across the room. But most of all his eyes stuck on a box sitting on the couch table. A box Sherlock had never seen before and which was filled and surrounded by countless papers and items carelessly strewn over the floor and the table surface. When Sherlock realised what all the papers were about an icy grip seemed to twist his guts. All these papers about the fall. John had cut them out. He had kept them. What must it have been like for John? Facing all of that, on a daily basis. Realisation about the impact his disappearance had had beyond the fall itself dawned on him. Sherlock nearly doubled over. He hadn't been there. John had to bear this all alone. No wonder that he still held a grudge against Sherlock.
"But the way I felt. When I woke. I know that…"
And finally his feet started to move. Slowly first, hesitantly, little step to his side. This felt better, his footing much more stable. Okay, he could work from here, good position to continue...
me?" John asked baffled, tilting his head sidewards, frowning.
“I'll get us a refill, yeah?” He asked without waiting for an answer. He made his way up to the bar and dumped the empty glasses on the counter.
He slightly tugged at Sherlock’s cuffs to ease them over the wrists, but wasn’t given any assistance. Quizzically he looked at Sherlock and was puzzled at the hint of hurt showing in the lines around his eyes.
“I don’t mind. It’s alright, it’s okay.” One step closer.
John marveled at the realisation of the difference between the Sherlock 'then' and the Sherlock currently lurking outside of 221 Baker Street. The progress they had made. Both of them. No, John corrected himself, the Sherlock downstairs wasn't a different man; it was the same man, the same stir crazy genius he had always loved along the way. That open, vulnerable side in need of affection and love had always been there; safely bottled up and locked away behind thick walls of self-protection, only showing its face every now and then in Sherlock's most vulnerable moments.
“No, of course you won’t.” John mumbled.
John could feel his cheeks strain with the broad grin that was spreading on his face just thinking of Scott's ridiculous talk. That man had thrown him off balance even in his dreams. Apparently, it had kept his traumatised soldier’s mind occupied in a way that had allowed him to fall asleep again even after waking from his nightmares. That alone was a miracle.
It was so much fun to mess with that brilliant brain; John relaxed into the joy that was now bubbling up again and let himself fall backwards onto his mattress.
Text alert. Stop walking. Check. Mike.
John’s confused gaze fixed on him up on the roof indelible, committed to memory, reflecting his own pain, his own desperation. Tears running down his cheeks. John trusting him, hoping and then disbelievingly realising the extent of the situation.
is the reason you can’t stay. But… you never considered that there might be a choice. A real choice.” Mycroft tried to take a step towards Sherlock, but Sherlock tensed up immediately and Mycroft shied away again. “Sherlock, when it comes to John Watson you might not have to choose
"Jooooohn. I can barely waaaalk."
Out of the country?
No time to change, no time to rest for a while, let alone EAT. Of course, Sherlock wasn’t aware of any of this as it never matters to him, but not so for John! He would actually really much like to change the clothes a sick child vomited on at the clinic, and he desperately needed to use the loo! But well, what was all this in comparison to catching this criminal whoever-he-was and whatever-he-did at Sherlock’s side….
When he let himself fall back into the music, able to experience it inside and out, he felt himself calm down, centred, grounded. This was good. This would help him to keep his composure. Perhaps this could even help him to say what needed to be said.
"Bell? They didn't ring the bell, John! Mrs Hudson let them…"
"You'd feed me up?"
“Sherlock William Shezza Elle Holmes, you amazing researching and violin-playing Dancing Drag Pirate Detective… I love you to the moon and back with everything you are and everything you’ll ever be! But don’t expect for one single second that I’ll ever stop being jealous!!!” he said, happy laughter mixing with his tears strained voice.
(this is also a store for all your other drag/shape altering needs) and also this shop here:
Mycroft turned towards him with a curious glint in his eyes.
Slowly it dawned on John. Sherlock, who had given up everything and put his own life in the line of fire to protect him; Sherlock who was the reason that John was still alive… He still didn’t know his value in John’s life. Sherlock needed to know! John had to make sure he did! Involuntarily he took a step in Sherlock’s direction and almost bumped against him when  the man suddenly stood right in front of him.
When Sherlock lifted his foot and the pressure on his cock eased, he sighed in relief. However it didn’t last long—big hands with slender fingers splayed and slid underneath the waistband of the denims. John watched enraptured when they glided over the curves of arse cheeks, over hips and strong thighs; as they revealed the expected suspenders, the straps holding the stockings in place; as they effortlessly guided down the trousers on their way.
Trying to get some grip John shook his head and closed his eyes. Not the right moment to freak out.
“He… he said a lot, you know, but… half of the time I didn’t understand a damn thing he was saying! Like… What did he want to tell me? Greg, really… I still don’t know! But in the end… I think… yeah, I think,” John sighed, “He doesn’t need me anymore, Greg. In his life I mean. Wants distance. Has something new.” His voice was bitter and he knew Greg realised. It wasn’t long then before Greg interrupted.
As all the times before, there was no answer. If he was honest, he hadn't even expected one anymore. But it had been worth a try. By now the realities began to blur into one another, his mind no longer able to hold on to the rapid switch of the two layers of his consciousness...
Sherlock. This was Sherlock. Real life Sherlock!
Breathlessly waiting for what would happen next, John watched each little movement of Sherlock closely, still bothered by how Sherlock had managed to hide this from him all this time they had lived together. Or had John been too unobservant? Wasn't that what Sherlock accused him of constantly? Had he seen but not observed - once again? How could John of all people have missed that Sherlock's passion wasn't exclusively for The Work?
He raised his gaze and looked Sherlock directly into his eyes. The brothers kept staring at each other, until Sherlock quietly picked up the chair and sat back down without a word.
Did Sherlock still not know that John was all his? And that he'd do everything for Sherlock? Why did Sherlock still hesitate to go all-in? Did this still feel like a game to him? Was he still afraid to lose?
“Whichever way, Sherlock. Please let us try again. We’ve both been through a lot. We’ve learned our lesson. Let’s do better this time!”
"Sherlock, stop that. Just… stop it. Why are you this evasive? Why are you backing off each time I think we're taking one step forward? What are you afraid of?"
“It’s part of the disguise,” he had said without any traceable emotion.
"Wouldn't have expected anyone to think anything about it actually," John huffed.
“But John, you have to understand… The entire time I’ve fought so hard to rectify that misconception, to set that record straight… of sorts…” He smirked at John who grunted amused. “I really didn’t care what they thought of me, but that they judged me because of it, looked down at me, without even caring enough to ask to confirm or defuse the rumours… I have to admit, it hurt.” Sherlock was quiet for a moment, swallowed.
Now he had finally reached his goal. Nearly. Sherlock waited for it. Desperately. Wouldn't it be easier to just give up, to let exhaustion take over? Just let it all go?
Never leaving his eyes, Miss Pirate planted both her feet on the stage again and ran her now free right hand down her front, sliding over one of the firm breasts and along a flat stomach heaving from heavy breathing only to stop at her groin and to cup herself through the layers of leather and lace of her skirt.
When he finally ran his palms quickly over Sherlock’s front to check for any missing spots, a low groan coming from the top of the mattress made him look up. The sight of Sherlock’s face, contorted in suppressed pleasure, made John cave in and yield to the urge to free the lower lip currently trapped by the teeth biting it. He surged up, his own body sliding in a wave of warm skin over Sherlock’s chilly torso. He pulled Sherlock’s swollen lower lip free with one thumb taking hold of the man’s chin and dove in for a kiss. The moan rumbling deep in Sherlock’s throat could as much have been caused by John’s passionate tongue pushing between his lips as by their equally straining erections sliding against each other due to John's move. The last remaining bit of foam on Sherlock’s freshly shaven skin made it slippery in a way that prevented any friction that might have felt uncomfortable.
"Oh God, Sherlock…" John croaked.
“Which you got…,” John actually didn’t want to know.
Sherlock gave a confirming grunt. Not to the desire to talk about anything. What would be the purpose of that? No, he rather welcomed John's acknowledgment of his faults.
underneath all those tits and bits… literally." He smirked and an answering grin spread on Sherlock's face. "So, don't you dare to be insecure about that gorgeous pirate you're turning into and who is still very much my Sherlock."
"No, they aren't."
The one night came to his memory when they had sat in their respective chairs, still shaken to the core, frightened by the amount of angst they’ve felt - not for themselves but for the other - but so reassured at the same time because they knew now - really knew - that they weren’t alone anymore.
one last chance?
Yes, I'm aware that there's barely any to no phone signal on the tube in London. This didn't even need research, just one visit to London. Let's call it a kind of field study...😩🤣
And each time he read it he noticed something different.
"Yes, it's true, I still enjoy it. But it's not everything I have and need anymore. Let's call it 'controlled usage' now." he winked. "My addiction only acts up when my source of happiness is absent." He waited to let this sink in. He hoped it did. "It's you who healed me, Sherlock! It's a fact! You trust facts." John grinned, enjoying beating Sherlock with his own weapons. To signal that this topic didn't need any further discussion in his opinion right now, he tapped the button again.
“That’s who I am and I need you to see me as a whole. There are no different personalities. It’s all one and the same—I’m Sherlock as well as William, as only my Uncle Rudy used to call me. I’m also Shezza, who you luckily haven’t met yet and I hope never will. It’s what I went by among the addicts in the dens. And then there’s Elle and your Miss Pirate even if it’s actually the same. I’m the Violinist and the Chemist. And yes, I’m best known as the Consulting Detective. And only for you I’m a boyfriend and a lover and… a vampire.” An amused but intrigued little smile spread on his lips. He continued earnestly, holding John’s gaze when he spoke. “Just as you are an army Captain and a medical doctor, a surgeon to be precise. But you're still the ugly jumper wearing John Hamish Watson and my blogger and my partner in crime… Well, rather crime-solving. And my... John.”
," John moaned. The heat, the buzz, the raw and ruthless want of his approaching orgasm built and swell in his lower belly.
“I was always looking for the next rush of adrenaline,” John said out of the blue, without further announcement. He sat up and looked at Sherlock who only reluctantly let go of him. “You were right, I’m an addict, I always have been. Always looking for the next fix. I never stayed long, I never committed myself to anything. Army and medicine, perfect place to be for that. Easy to hide behind a long-term contract with only one hospital or signing up for a tour abroad for several years… yeah,” he huffed dismissively, “good old dutiful and loyal John Watson.” He looked down at their hands. Sherlock’s hand almost fully covered his. For some reason it was a calming and reassuring sight.
“Yes. And?” John said, stubbornly, raised his chin daringly.
“I know.”
“Just… curious. Bad habit of mine.” Scott said, apparently trying to sound apologetic but failing spectacularly.
He knew they’d done it. They’d taken the first hurdle. The biggest one, because from here on it was merely looking for the right path. But at least they were facing the same direction. They’d go that path together. That’s all that counted. They’d get there.
Almost.
“I can’t possibly answer that as I’m missing essential data to estimate…” Scott said, a bit breathless.
John briefly wondered if Scott was just mocking him, but he sounded too serious for that.
"Nothing."
In the end, Moriarty had won. There was nothing left here to burn, his heart was gone.
But he didn't know. Couldn't remember. Didn't understand. Why was he here? How?
John looked around the park, suspicious. Squinting he scanned the people walking by, sitting on benches, doing the stuff people tended to do in parks in their leisure time… It could literally be
Deflated he left the gents and headed for the bar. A drink was exactly what he needed now to calm his thoughts and his silly heart. His friends had long left and he climbed a chair at the bar and ordered just anything strong. He didn’t care.
“Of course not
“What I mean
A dusty, dirty, scratched mp3 player. His mp3 player.
John fastened his steps, treading with more force than necessary. Almost marching, soldier today, into battle. Determined to fight for it. Determined to win it. The opponent to defeat was a tough one though
John claimed that he meant what was implied in the song. He wouldn’t give up if they’d face rougher times? He wouldn’t give up if they’d make mistakes? He wouldn’t give up if Sherlock would retreat, needed time for himself? He would be willing to learn, together with Sherlock? He would… still be his friend? Would he? Even if it didn’t work? Between them? A… relationship? Sherlock got dizzy at the thought. Because… what if… what if
"He is free to do as he wants to do. I don't care." Sherlock huffed, and it sounded much too sincere for John’s liking.
“The life I lived before I met you, was never my own.” He had to clear his throat. This wasn’t going to be easy. “Even looking back I don’t know which choices were my own and which were just me meeting the expectations I thought were demanded of me. I wanted to make my parents proud, it was about the only way to gain some affection, you know,” Sherlock’s hand settled over his own which was still resting on Sherlock’s thigh. “So the army it was, which was okay because I felt like doing something useful. And guns… yeah, I liked guns to be honest.” Sherlock raised one eyebrow and regarded him smugly. John threw him a ‘you’re one to talk’-stare back and Sherlock sheepishly avoided his gaze.
"Well, I guess I might have been a tiny bit jealous…" John admitted, hugging Sherlock a bit tighter against his chest. He was happy to receive an answering squeeze of his forearms.
That was it. He hadn't thought about Moriarty's threat in a long while. There had been the web, there had been the game still. But Moriarty was dead, John was safe. There was no-one who cared about Sherlock's heart now. And still, he couldn't quite shake the feeling that, even posthumous, Moriarty had still played his game. Sherlock had never even had the slightest chance.
Feeling lost, John rubbed a hand over his face, lingered, the hand clasped over his mouth. Deep in thought, he turned his head slightly, slowly, and let his lips slide over the rough side of his forefinger. He felt his own warm breath ghost over his clammy skin. His focus shifted, from irrevocable incidents and past places to the here and now, to his own body. Narrowing down, turning an unintentional and insignificant touch into the centre of his attention. It felt strange, the contrast between the brushes of vivid warm puffs of air and the chilly nightly breeze. The rough cold skin of his knuckles, slightly numb, touch only registered like through a layer of wool, against the over-sensitive soft tissue of his lips. It was a give and take of sensation. The rough smoothing the soft, the warmth leaving traces on the cold. The tingling on the lips increasing, the numb fingers fading into the background of awareness. The overload of sensation made the tingle merge into numbness. The ongoing movement forces numb skin into sensation. Humid breath leaving a moist layer on knuckles where it brushed over them. Lips drying damp fingers under their warm touch. The soft slightly scratchy sound the contact caused recognised from inside and outside of his head.
Only now, seeing Sherlock and the costume of The Purple Pirate side by side, it struck him that he had never seen them together. Which was ridiculous as they were one and the same, but… he hadn’t seen them merge, so to speak. And now, he was supposed to assist. He wasn’t sure if he’d come out safe and sane at the other end of this undertaking…
didn’t, did I? Someone apparently forgot to tell me.” John hissed through his teeth. John looked up at Sherlock and knew his fury was plainly visible in his eyes. Sherlock watched him for a moment, scanning his face. He took a miniscule step back, only to lower their hands even though he didn't let go.
, together with his location. And immediately pocketed his phone again to have both hands on his gun.
“Well...not really. But thanks for asking!” John replied tentatively, not knowing what to do, his bladder persistently asking for attention.
“Why?” Sherlock almost yelled. “Why, John? Can’t you see that this wouldn’t work? Why hang on to something that isn’t good for either of us? Believe me, John. It might not look like it right now, but we’re better off without each other.” Without another word he turned and without hesitation he made his way towards the exit.
Suddenly it was all so clear. He had tried so hard and in the end it was this one simple thing which was utterly obvious to John, that Sherlock still doubted, that he craved to hear. How could John have been so blind all the time. Only recently even, he had detected the actual main problem but he hadn't drawn the connection. Too obvious. He had seen, but not observed.
"No, you're right. That isn't all of it. It's actually about what came after." John sighed defeated. Sherlock still held him close, brushed his nose through John's hair, let one of his hands wander over John's back.
"What the fuck would have happened, if
, he made his way to the door they had come through earlier that night intending to get out of the cursed club.
"Russell Square." Sherlock stated, opened his eyes and immediately pinned John with his gaze.
“Yep.” John popped the ‘p’ on purpose. “Been to Kabul. To investigate the media coverage of the events. The picture they were painting for the people at home. We had hints that there was a leak, providing misinformation, to blackguard our mission.” John was extremely pleased to have caught Sherlock by surprise and have his full attention now. “Went by the name of Iain back then and I was pretty proud about pulling off a fairly decent Scottish accent. And the beard, well…,” he grinned widely and saw Sherlock blush even more, “... I must say the effect it had on others was quite… uhm… satisfying.” He deepened his voice with the last word and slowly approached Sherlock. Who seemed to have some difficulties breathing.
Less and less voices audible in the neighborhood.
He turned the disc in his hands, the edge on the side which had hit the wall splintered, a long crack tracking over the backside.
The moment Sherlock stopped typing and hummed happily behind his laptop, John looked up to discover a wicked smirk on the detective's face. His eyes twinkled mischievously and John knew, this meant trouble.
“Right you are, love!” John, still chuckling, pressed a kiss on the willingly reciprocating pouting lips of his partner.
Dear readers,
"For Christ sake, John, it's freezing!"
"..."
?" Sherlock spat.
John thought, slightly panicking,
"Bossy…"
Presents? SH
John nodded back, gave him a small but heartening and encouraging smile.
Sherlock… yesterday… in the park…
Without looking at it he pulled out the disc, put it into the reader and swallowed. When the new window of the video player opened, he was greeted with a close up of John Watson's face, nose ridiculously distorted, eyes flickering between anywhere below and above the lense of the camera, brow furrowed. Sherlock's finger hammered on the pause button. Sherlock's heart hammered in his chest. He squeezed his eyes shut for a moment, tried to even out his breathing. He had known that something of this kind would happen. Why did it still affect him this much? He knew why… because he had tried… hard. And failed. He could stop watching though. Right now. Although, he couldn't. All his powers of restraint were spent. He was drained. And now the floodgates were opened, every sentiment he had tried to hold back was flowing over, drowning him. Suffocating him.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Thank you, John Watson." he said low and deep. And it felt as if they'd just made a pact.
Mycroft turned his head and watched John for a moment with a serious gaze, probably taking in John’s state of clothing and surely making all the deductions he needed. After a while he took a deep breath and spoke again: “John…” he paused for a moment, his eyes not leaving John’s face. “John”, he started again. “What are your intentions with my brother?”
Sherlock’s breath hitched the tiniest bit, barely audible if it were not for John’s senses being on high alert. John hummed appreciatively against Sherlock’s skin, bathing in the warmth it radiated and the familiar fragrance of Sherlock’s cologne mixed with a new heady and raw scent of skin covered in fresh sweat and dust and the distinct intoxicating whiff of the thrill of entering unknown territory.
Shatter Me.
Sherlock did get quite eager to spend more time in bed though. John did not object, happy to prove the previously mentioned effect of the famous Watson-beard… or rather MacKelpie-beard that is. When he saw Sherlock shifting on the kitchen chairs, yelping when he got in the tub to take a bath and smearing extra-skin-soothing creme not only on his face, he was very happy to have come up with the punishment following the misuse of shaving foam. Not that he himself enjoyed it any less, but Sherlock was much more self-conscious about his stubble.
“What?” John asked, annoyed the moment he saw that look.
"Sherlock?" Mycroft's voice woke Sherlock from his trance. Immediately, Sherlock spun on his heels. The look on his face switched from pained to furious in a flash.
John had thought that Sherlock had finally given in to the dry spell of cases since he wasn’t allowed on crime scenes of the Yard any longer. Barely any private cases came in, as people apparently didn’t get as much chance to cheat, to silently disappear, to change identities or to get kidnapped due to the pandemic. Sherlock didn’t like any of those changes.
"I'll do all I can to keep you safe."
"*whisper* Thank you, John."
And of me, obviously.” He took a deep steadying breath, trying to gather some courage. He had never shared this before. With no-one, not even Ella. “Here we go then.”
"Wait, stop." John interrupted before Scott could get too deep into that angle of thoughts. “Didn’t mean it like that.”
John wasn’t sure if he had misheard the whispered ‘yes, Captain’ but he was pretty sure he hadn’t. Perfect. After giving Scott a moment and giving his poor neglected erection some attention if only through boundaries of fabric, he continued, knowing full well that he was daring Scott…
John groaned, disgruntled at the thought that they’d have to face the loathsome creature again.
“Greg. I had to promise him. It’s the least I can do, no? Keep my promise?” John pleaded, the last bit of energy pouring into convincing himself, not giving into the temptation, the curiosity to know what Sherlock had wanted to say.
*** link to song within the chapter (underlined) and in the end notes ***
“But you’ve only seen me twice,” Sherlock swallowed, his voice was thick and he realised that this was the first time he had spoken since they’d left Baker Street, “how is that enough times to make this assumption?” Sherlock could have smacked himself. Why was he getting defensive again? He knew why. The two times John had watched him had been some of his most unguarded moments. And they had both hurt. And he was still embarrassed about both of them. Breaking down that spectacularly in front of John who had to pick up his pieces afterwards and nurse him back to consciousness
“No?” John couldn’t help to counter. Sherlock only glared at him. “It’s awful, Sherlock! Really really awful!! It hurts my eyes! I can’t even look at you!!” John ranted. “Let alone…”
“You never had that tea, did you?” Greg suddenly changed topic. John looked up and his eyes fell on his still full cup, now gone cold.
“I have the feeling I’ll like everything on you.” John crooned, donning his best Humphrey Bogart impression.
Sherlock smiled tenderly at him, releasing John's waist to reach up and cradle his face, running his thumbs slowly and gently over the bristly hair on John's cheeks.
“What was I supposed to say?” John heard himself say.
“So?” Greg asked innocently. John just huffed. “My thoughts exactly…,” Greg cheered.
“Are we?” John asked, a bit insecure.
of girlfriends. And Sherlock was so…
“Mmmhmm,” John confirmed, and encouraged by the slight blush colouring Sherlock’s cheekbones and the shuddering breath he rather felt underneath his hands than heard, John let his hands slowly wander upwards, giving Sherlock all the time to back out, and reached for the top buttons of Sherlock’s shirt. “May I?” he whispered, trying to take in all of Sherlock’s beautiful face, to detect any sign of discomfort. When he found none and there was only a small nod coming from the man, watching him silently, he pressed a soft kiss to the hollow of Sherlock’s throat between his collarbones and popped the first button open. It felt like so much more though; it felt like opening a door that had been locked for ages. Like opening it wide, revealing a secret garden. Like taking the last step over the threshold and setting foot into the beauty of the forbidden place for the first time. And yet, it felt like finally coming home.
“No,” Miss Pirate said, calmly, unfazed.
"Will you never—not EVER—do that again, young man?!" she had scolded him while pushing him into one of the chairs at her kitchen table. "If I have to get
“Rather the opposite, actually.” Scott dispelled John’s concern after an amused huff. Slowly, lowly, each word pronounced meticulously, he added, “You see, I prefer dress shirts, bespoke.” It made John shiver. Oh yes, tailored shirts —

“Do you have the first idea how lucky you are? He’s
"As you have now confirmed, regarding the fact that you called the landline, I'm indeed back at Baker Street."
And left.
The song continued as John hadn’t reached the button to turn it off in time. He wasn’t even aware of his hand still hovering mid-air. His mind going blank. '
reasonable. Otherwise they wouldn't get anywhere. Even John had to realise that.
"Anyway, it doesn't smell and it doesn't taste like you though. So, off it goes…"
"You… you absolute…" he looked at Sherlock and saw the childish joy twinkling in his eyes. "God, I love you!" rushed out of him. "Don't you ever doubt that."
The fierce crisp tone almost pierced John’s brain, sending it offline. The contrast to the earlier warm sultry rumble was mind blowing. However, as much as Scott tried to sound as if he was holding the reins in hand, John noticed the tremble in the man’s voice, the little whimpers and grunts, which only spiked John’s arousal even more, knowing he was just as affected. John did as he was told, licking broad stripes over the palm of his hand, trying to gather as much saliva as possible, because he suspected he wasn’t in any state to collect the lube from the night stand anymore.
John hoped he had misunderstood. Was Sherlock still doubting himself? But it all made sense.
Sherlock growled and his wandering hands and fingers suggested that he was about to make use of the opportunity, when very inconveniently his mobile buzzed and beeped. They tried to ignore it but it went off again. And again.
Their beards though seemed to grow at the same rate. They squabbled about it. Sherlock tried to argue that his progress was much more visible. John vetoed that it was only related to his darker hair colour and couldn't be taken into account.
“Well… it might be a bit cramped but it's not
"Had to prick you several times. And I only had that right arm of yours. The left crook was… nevermind. I don't even know how often I had to put damned catheters back in. You ripped them out in your sleep… God knows how you did that…" chuckle, "couldn't leave you alone for one minute…" laugh, "nothing new there, yeah?" He sounded fond. Fond?
"More proof that I can’t be trusted," resigned, but strangely calm. The confirmation somehow settled something within him. It felt clammy, mushy, dark grey. Like mud. It covered his insides, it coated his heart. "Again. Again and again."
"I don't want to hurt you again." John said under his breath, barely able to stand the affection radiating from Sherlock's eyes.
Up to the point they had entered Mycroft's kitchen everything had gone according to Sherlock's predictions. Of course he had known that Mycroft would locate his bolt hole eventually. Actually, he had downright counted on him doing so. But John wouldn't. And that was the whole point.
The sight on John's other side wasn't any less confusing. Greg, barefoot, Hawaiian-flowery shorts, upper body bare, sweaty, smeared with grease. He was wiping his hands on an oily cloth stuffed into his waistband with one corner. He looked as if he had just climbed out of the engine room, which he probably had. He, too, was eying his counterpart, scrutinising him, mouth still hanging open from stopping mid speech. Motionless apart from the still wiping hands.
When he had finally managed to get away, he had sought shelter in one of his lesser known boltholes. He hardly ever used this one, but it would do for its current purpose. He wanted to hide, he wanted to not be found… by John. Although, he still didn't want to abandon his plans. Anything but, actually. So he had stayed put until the anticipated black sedan had pulled up to the curb right in front of his makeshift home. There was a briefing to attend after all, and if Mycroft was anything, then he was annoyingly meticulous about adhering to agreements. At least, that was what Sherlock had thought…
"You, of course."
how big your heart is, how sensitive and caring and… well… fragile you are.” He pulled Sherlock’s hand up and rested his cheek against Sherlock’s open palm. Long warm fingers immediately dug into the soft skin behind his ear. Breathing became difficult.
damnit!
Walk. What to do? Walk. Where to go? Walk.
it was a show, he
"God… You!" he growled, nibbling on Sherlock's bottom lip, flicking his tongue playfully against the tip of Sherlock's who was trying to get past his lips to invade his mouth. "Turn…" he rasped, patting Sherlock's hip. When the man didn't react immediately he repeated more urgently, reaching for Sherlock's thigh to pull, "Turn! Come here! I want to taste you, too…"
He came to a halt, tried to catch his breath. The picture of John before him, wide eyed, becoming clearer, steadier. Steadying himself in return.
But this was all wrong.
"Sherlock Holmes, you are a bad bad man!!" John growled. Sherlock's grin grew wider and turned even more wickedly.
?" Miss Pirate snarled, restrained, for his ears only.
“Furthermore, I wouldn’t risk you killing Lestrade for giving you that stupid idea in the first place, would I? You'd end up in jail and I'd lose my main source of interesting cases. That'd be a pity.” Sherlock chuckled.
“I don't exactly

“And you, Mycroft… What are
Relieved by the change of mood, John grinned. He released Sherlock's dressing gown in favor of sliding his fingers into the most glorious curls on the entire planet. Who was he kidding, in the entire universe!
“Alright… If you must know, I was looking for a new flat, but there wasn’t much appealing or affordable on offer either. I even applied for social housing at the community centre, but I’m afraid I’m not even eligible for that. Yeah and afterwards I was scouring estate agents all through central London even though I knew that was a futile attempt. That’s when my friend called after me when I walked through a park; wouldn’t even have noticed. So there’s that… We had coffee, my friend listened to me whining like a drowning cat and told me, out of pity I guess, about some other friend who is looking for a flatshare. So I declined.”
Up to the point he almost felt out of his mind and wasn't able to withstand the urge to take Sherlock right there and then anymore.
Memories surfaced of a period in his life he hadn’t thought of in a long while. Incredible how all this had been pushed aside and became irrelevant in the wake of his life with Sherlock.
"What? Why?" John was taken aback. "Why would I?"
"No dear, sorry." She looked emphatically at him, pitying even. John had to look away. He swallowed.
When he finally came down from his high, panting hard, head still restring against the wall, he realised that the stranger was gone. Left without so much as a word. Vanished into thin air. John hadn't even noticed.
"I? I distanced myself? You can't be… Sherlock, seriously??" He heard more rustling and footsteps on a wooden floor. John was pacing. "You can't honestly… fuck, this is not how I wanted this to go." The pacing stopped. Then with apparently new found certainty, "Sherlock, we need to talk."
Sherlock didn‘t even realise he was moving until the fresh May air hit his face. The moment he stepped on the pavement, he remembered his coat still hanging upstairs, but never mind, he definitely would not go back for it now. And the spring sun warmed the air enough to not freeze anymore after all. All he wanted was to leave everything behind. Away from Baker Street, away from 221B, from John, from arguments, from abominable feelings.... he groaned and gave a strangled frustrated cry at the thought, and made an older woman passing him jump. He only gave her a moody glare and she hurried away.

So Sherlock did the first best thing he could think of. Deliver facts.
He saw that Molly kept eyeing Greg who waited in the background. She blushed a bit and brushed a non-existing loose hair strand behind her ear.
Luckily Sherlock smirked and the tense atmosphere eased a bit.
Letting army medals and badges slip through his fingers, thoughts crossed his mind and shifted into one another. Fragments like shards picked from the memory of a past broken into a thousand pieces.
“Of course you can!” Greg squeaked in friendly annoyance. “You know… open your mouth… voice and all… and say it. Easy!”
“Why?” John asked, puzzled. This wasn’t like Sherlock—Mr Punchline. “You’ve been so furious about it like I’ve never seen you before. Not with me, at least,” he added a bit sheepishly. “Surely you want to still get it out? It wasn’t proper talking we did there just yet, right?” he nudged Sherlock playfully, indicating he was okay with it; that he’d face whatever Sherlock had to say.
What would it feel like to kiss John Watson. Sherlock had never been one for kissing. Too sentimental. With Victor it had been pleasurable enough. Mostly in the heat of the moment. But never just for the sake of kissing. But John… he wouldn't mind kissing him. On the contrary, kissing John would be everything. He longed to know what his lips felt like. If they would feel like Sherlock imagined them to feel… warm, soft yet firm, a bit scratchy because they were chapped sometimes and also because they were thinner than Sherlock's. He would probably feel stubble under his lips. Which would be delightful. He could scratch his teeth over it. Hear the rasping sound it would make. Dip his tongue against it to feel the prickle. Sherlock shivered. Would John like that? What would he taste like? What was the taste of safety and belonging? Of destiny? Of home? Sherlock imagined John to taste the way their Baker Street flat smelled like. Sunny, cosy, sometimes of tea, sometimes of Indian take away. Sometimes like danger. Sometimes like comfort. Kissing John would be a whole universe of sensations. It would be enough, he wouldn’t need anything more.

"I wouldn't even put it beyond you." Sherlock scowled. "You
“Of course we are!” Sherlock exclaimed. “Now you’re my pimp!”
After roaming the internet and reading everything about treatment options, he learned that a major point in comforting amnesia patients is a strong bond to their closest relatives and acquaintances
John felt heat creep to his face. He hadn’t seen the Purple Pirate since their very first night. It was a very very memorable night. He had been so alone and he owed that Posh Purple Pirate so much. She… he… — John chuckled at the realisation that he still mixed the images up in his mind. No matter which, it was all fine anyway, that enigmatic Pirate had entered his life and made him drown in an instant. And saved his life.
“Why would I?” John teased, smirking.
“Alright...” Sherlock took a deep breath. “I think when you called me a prostitute…”
John was afraid to reach out only to touch a massive and cold surface. So he felt his heart hammering in his chest, cautious of every of his movements, hesitant of what to do next.
“You had a row… with a machine?” If a phone speaker would be able to smirk, that’s what his phone would have done. God, this was embarrassing.
So, Jo my dear, you know you ruined me for life, right? And I'll be forever grateful for that! Love you! 💜💜💜
Moriarty. Everything always seemed to come back to Moriarty in the end. Moriarty really was playing posthumous games with him.
He had been tempted to shout out to Sherlock and he nearly had when suddenly the impression had changed unexpectedly into something different altogether; when suddenly… Sherlock had started to dance.
So much evidence of John's life at 221b and nevertheless Sherlock could feel the emptiness of the flat. It wasn't the ‘John-had-a-shift-at-the surgery-emptiness’ or the ‘John-had-left-doing-groceries-without-Sherlock-noticing-emptiness’. No, it was no doubt a ‘John-left-for-good-emptiness’. He had even left in such a hurry and in such desperation that he hadn't cared to take his most valuable belongings. Leaving had seemingly been more important at that point than sentiment. That was uncharacteristic for a John Watson. Sherlock summarised his deductions. This was serious. This was final.
"I was merely trying to understand the reasoning. Why would he bring wine when you clearly said candle."
"Did you also see the eyeliner and mascara, John?" he asked excitedly.
"I actually think I do…" he laughed at Sherlock's doubting huff. "Full same for me when I see you dancing, you know. Of course you do, how could you not…" he chuckled and Sherlock joined in. "I think that it's not even necessarily your pirate that does it for me," John continued, caressing Sherlock's face with his hands and his gaze. "It's just… you. Good God, your body, Sherlock…" he groaned, his own body shuddering from the tingle sizzling through his nervous system at the thought. "I don't know how that pole doesn't melt in your hands…"
,” Sherlock looked smug. Corner of his mouth twitching.
"... it's boring."
No, John thought, he hadn’t done anything wrong. He had been here in time, he had come at all in the first place... had bought coffee and waited for him, had asked him how he was… John had no right to throw all his frustration on Sherlock. That was what he had vowed to himself. Give Sherlock all the space he needed and deal with his own demons by himself. And when all the recent developments were alright… no... even
John sighed and tried to concentrate on the text messages.
"No…," he got interrupted once again.
“Uhm… yeah… hi.” Sherlock’s voice was a bit off, too. Had he been drinking, as well? And… ‘hi’? Did he just say ‘hi’?
"Three-four time, John. Really."
“I can’t find words appropriate enough to make you understand. It’s not that I haven’t searched for them. God, I did, I really did. Nothing would suffice, it’d all just be a bleak and deficient depiction.” John was silent, Sherlock couldn’t even hear him breath.
Oh god, Moriarty, he would haunt him forever. He'd never get rid of him. Moriarty was cruel, even in death. He didn't do sentiment. Appealing. Could that be a solution - being like Moriarty? Maybe. Could work. Would work.
“Sherlock… oh my God… that’s… that’s great!” She jumped up and squirreled her way around the couch table. “Wow! What am I doing here? I’ll just be…”
With kind regards,
“What the hell…?” Was that an insult? John didn’t know what to make of this guy.
It took him a moment before he got aware that he had lost track of time while ogling Sherlock. Distracted by the mesmerising sight, he hadn’t realised that the lyrics kept repeating themselves, that the song was on a never ending loop. So much for waiting. Indecisive, John turned the options over in his head. Should he wait? Would Sherlock stop? Sherlock had to stop at one point. But when? He had proven before that he could keep this going for hours. Days even? Until breaking down? Again? But if John interrupted, would that take Sherlock by surprise, startle him, spook him even? Would that destroy the moment? Would that destroy this last chance John got? But if he waited and had to watch Sherlock wear himself out? What if Sherlock would be too tired, too exhausted to even listen to John? Could he risk that? Should he just step in? But if it went wrong? There was no possibility to do it over… either way…
Mind and body confused, whirling, dizzy, he felt himself sucked into a vortex of desire. A force unintentionally unleashed only the day before, the night before. Now being more than aware of the subject of his desire, molten into one with him, it only spiked his arousal. Tangled in his own clothes, John fumbled, one-handed, with his own shirt buttons. Impatiently pulling and tugging as if he couldn't wait to unwrap someone else's body, Sherlock's body. The other hand grazing over his still clothed chest, ghosting over fabric covered nipples. The jolting feeling when they hardened flashing through his body right to his groin, his rapidly filling cock, opposed the sensation of the tiny nubs forming under his fingertips, tempting him to rub firmer, to press harder. Panting with the enjoyment of his own and someone else's pleasure, he bent his back and pushed his head into the cushions of the chair and his chest into the restless hands. He tweaked greedily presented nipples and felt the satisfaction of them being tweaked. He rolled them between finger and thump and groaned deeply when a new wave of desire crushed over him.
Sherlock slept peacefully, his bruised face unlined and vulnerable. He was clean and he had color in his cheeks. His matted hair and beard had been shaved and his scalp smelled slightly medicinal – a treatment for the lice. He wore pyjamas, but underneath ointment and bandages covered his sores and lacerations. He had splints on three, slightly swollen fingers.
"I know!" Mycroft thundered. "Don't you think I know that better than anyone!?"
“I’ll be back.” Letrade told Mycroft. It felt
“Yeah. And, erm...” John sighed, troubled. “I’ll need money. More money than I have...”
Then Mycroft said, "my brother is fourteen years old."
John had felt the shift in Sherlock’s emotions. He pressed a gentle kiss to the back of his Omega's neck.
“John...” Sherlock spoke quietly, just above a whisper. I leaned closer to hear him. “What if I have HIV?”
He was somewhere in Eastern Europe or Northern Asia – maybe Ukraine. Maybe Kazakhstan. He didn’t know.
He’d always dated petite Beta females. He preferred them aesthetically.
"No." She agreed. "Shane is good for you. You're doing better, I can tell."
I stood out in the hall wondering what Sherlock had to tell Mycroft. He must have some vital information about Moriarty’s web... I prayed Vinokourov had truly been the end of it.
“That has nothing to do with HIM.” I scoffed. “Most people are simply too dull to spend an hour with – let alone enough time to qualify as a relationship. I have standards.” I told him loftily. “I couldn’t bear to settle for just any Mariah or Brenda or Jan.” These were the names of John’s last three girlfriends, and it pissed him off.
“In Mycroft’s world? Always.” Sherlock said, rolling his eyes. “Mycroft needs to produce an heir – ideally two. Alphas, obviously. That will be the main consideration when negotiating a bondmate contract for Mycroft.”
And really, John
I turned away, not wanting to spy on such an intimate moment. Sherlock had slept with this man. Maybe he would again. Their body language certainly suggested he would.
The world slowly disappeared, only their kiss existing. Black swum in his peripheral vision obscuring everything but John. Then even John began to disappear. Sherlock strained to see John's face, but he was falling away from him... falling... falling...
"I think he's been poisoned." John told the doctor. "You need to test his blood for GBH."
I smiled a little nervously and lifted my waistband out to avoid my erection. I shucked off my pants. My prick stuck out rudely, the thick ring protruded from my urethra and disappeared under the corona of the glans... any other lover would be enthusiastic, aroused, by my piercing. I waited for John's judgement.
“That’s not the point!” The shout left me retching helplessly, coughing phlegm and bile into my lap. When I recovered myself I caught Mycroft giving a small shake of his head towards the door. I looked up – John’s shadow was in the window. I scowled
The young man smiled. "Thanks... John. Am I interrupting?" He asked.
As always, I look forward to your insightful comments.
“You’re mine, love, and there’s only one thing you can say about that.” I jacked his prick, the pink head emerging from his foreskin then almost disappearing again. “Only one thing you can say: ‘Yes, John.’”
4. Thief. Prostitute. Disfigured from prison abuse. A shell of the pretty boy he used to be. Upper bunk.
“Fuck me! Christ! Fuck me please!” I begged.
John pushed the hair back from my face tenderly. “God, you’re hot... you’re serious, you want me to... take charge? Coerce you?”
"How are you feeling about going home?"
“Erm… ok…” John painstakingly arranged himself the way Sherlock suggested – with several impatient exclamations from his Omega – whilst not pulling on their knotted parts too painfully. Sherlock moaned in relief when he was able to lower his legs. He lay splayed out in front of John, a vastness of alabaster skin, his bum in John’s lap.
After a moment I got up and followed him. He stood uncertainly by the table, holding the greasy paper bag.
I felt the IV move. “Are you doing it?” I demanded.
Sherlock's smile was tentative, not the easy smile of my best friend. I reached out to him impulsively, offered my hand. He took it, but his expression became guarded.
I’d had the curtains drawn tightly in 221b since the dinner party – I didn’t fancy Seb Moran staring at me through his rifle’s scope. But the longer he was out there, the harder it became to quell my fears – I found myself pulling the shades closed at work and wanting to check over my shoulder every three steps when I walked outdoors. I fantasized about him staring at my heat signature in the flat through an infra-red scope...
Ianto spoke. “I’m going out to check the trail.” He said, opening a door to a large coat room and pulling a mac from a hanger.
He sighed. “Fine.”
“John...” Sherlock whispered again, and I knew how very much he’d missed me too. “You’re really here.”
“I would be lost without my Virginia.” Dr. Mahon said. “I can’t imagine life without her.”
Mycroft blinked. “If I’d known that, I might have tried this sooner.”
I was panting hard as I fucked his fist. John sucked my earlobe. “Yeah, back up onto my fingers.” He crooned in my ear. “Just like that. Fuck me harder, fuck my fist, love. Fuck yourself on my hand. You feel so good.” He twisted his finger into my prostate and stars sparked in my vision. Another thrust, and another, and then my cock throbbed and erupted, twisting my insides and curling my toes. Muffling a shout against his shoulder, I came so hard I shot on John’s cheek and my chin. My bollocks turned themselves inside out, my body trembled with absolute bloody bliss. My vision failed, my brain went offline and there was only the electricity jolting through me…
"How do you feel about it?"
John relaxed, letting his breathing slow and eyes close. A kip after sex was always welcome. Moreso with his lover in his arms. He was on the edge of sleep when Sherlock spoke again.
"This is ridiculous."
"The sniper could have shot it." I observed. "He didn't."
"Can you spot me to the bog?" John asked softly. "I can walk, but my balance isn't 100 percent right now. I need to take this bloody catheter out."
“How old were you?” I asked through my own shock.
John and his companion went into a restaurant. Sherlock could see them being seated as he walked past. He continued to follow the hunter. He prowled the neighborhood then settled into a café with a view of the restaurant. Sherlock secreted himself in a doorway and watched the watcher.
"Of course." Sherlock looked at the folders. "Your friend, Peter, did he rerun my tests? Are his findings in here as well?"
“You are mine.” He sighed finally, resting his forehead against the back of Sherlock’s neck. “We are bonded.” He could feel the Omega’s restless pleasure through the newly made empathetic link. It was strong – stronger than John had expected. It was almost as if he could read his Omega’s thoughts.
Jim had done it knowing it would be a horrible, bloody, torturous death.
“You put him in danger!” I accused.
(See the end of the chapter for

I am dead.
"It won't resolve itself."
He relaxed minutely. “Yeah. It’s all true? You and he were… lovers?”
This time when he smiled, there was real humour sparkling in his eyes. "No." He said. "I don't need it."
“Do you remember the names of everyone
Sherlock knew it wouldn’t be long before he would be begging for it. Maybe an hour, maybe less. He didn’t know what effect the adrenaline and the exposure to so many riled Alphas would have – if it accelerated his heat, he had mere minutes.
“John.” I whisper. I shouldn’t wake him up, but I’m still disoriented. “John.”
“Of course not.” Sherlock said, unperturbed. “As long as the morphine doesn’t make you too sleepy – or affect you in other ways. How did you react to it after you were shot?”
Sherlock frowned. “I sincerely hope not.”
I waited, but when it was clear she wasn’t going to say more, I cleared my throat. “What happened to him?” I asked.
“You’re OK?” John asked when they were alone. “Did he hurt you?”
His Omega looked at him finally, his eyes dark in the dim light. “Yes... you’re right... you’re right... but not the police, they can’t stop him.”
When Dad left them, John experienced a strange mix of fear, confusion and relief. Mostly confusion. John had no idea why he'd left or how they'd go on without him. Dad was their Alpha! He missed his Dad keenly... but he also no longer felt tense and pressured all day long.
"I want him to love me not be disgusted by me. I couldn't bear to see that on his face."
“What are Omega brains like?” John asked, fascinated.
Fuck me, I had to get a job. There were bills. The rent would be due soon. I had put off finding another job, allowing myself the luxury of enjoying the first months of giddy love unfettered by obligation. Sherlock and I had been in each other’s pockets, spending almost all our time together – so much so, that I knew when Sherlock must have visited Lestrade. It had been wonderful. I had loved making Sherlock so happy.
“Yes.”
"What? Cooking? Making dinner?"
No... John doesn't love me... not like I love him. It won't be ok... it'll never be ok."
Choking, Sherlock slipped his right hand into his pocket. The gun was there, hard and reassuring, a little bit of John under his fingers. He thumbed off the safety.
"You're not coming with me!" John croaked, the piteous tone clear despite his effort to fight it.
The nurse turned on her heel and left.
John shushed me. “I know, my love. I know you’ll come back to me. And I will be here.”
“You’re being very silly.” He said finally.
“Maybe we should have some fun. Your people might feel compelled to ‘rescue’ you before too long.”
I pulled out my phone. “Give me your number and I’ll text the details.”
Victor studied me for a moment. “Sherlock’s lucky to have you.” He said finally.
John woke to find Mrs. Hudson sitting at his bedside, quietly knitting. She set her task aside. “How are you feeling, love?” She asked.
I forced that from my brain. We would find him and get him back to Wallog. Then I could treat him if need be. He would be OK.
Sherlock woke the next morning alone, aching all over, and feeling crabby. They had given him barely any pain medication. He abused the nurses – they were all stupid! – but it did nothing to improve his mood – or to get him more drugs. He wrote a long text to John, a rant about the incompetence of doctors and pain management ending with a plea that John come and wrangle more drugs for him.

Though I may complain, I do miss having you around. It’s so quiet. I find myself longing for your violin music, even in the middle of the night. Funny how easy it is to take for granted the things you find annoying, then how we miss them when they are gone. I shall be pleased to have you back, my dear boy, even if it wakes me at times I am not ready.
As John walked to class, his phone went off again. Probably just Mike confirming he got the message. He ignored it and kept going, but then his pocket vibrated again. And again. And
He hums in agreement and tightens his hand around mine as if strengthening his resolve. Always the soldier. No backing out now.

. Were there.” This is fucking embarrassing, but we don’t have time for my shame. Raking my fingers through my hair, I sigh and continue, “Anyway, we got right pissed, and then he put me in a cab for my flat and I left. I don’t remember much after that. I think I...maybe had a few more? I didn’t go right to sleep, I remember…,” I trail off as hazy images pass through my mind.
John contemplates the ceiling for a moment before dropping his head down onto his shoulder, breathing deeply through his nose while we lock eyes. He looks exhausted, and just
John blinked.

I lean over, bracing myself on the wall for support while I attempt to wash my legs and feet quickly.
Scratching at his greying beard, he clunked out into the sitting area and found Mycroft curled up in front of the stone cold fireplace, his fur shaking as he tried to stay warm. John was glad he forced himself from his bed, feeling guilty for neglecting his cat. As soon as he got close, Mycroft started and looked up at him with grey-blue eyes.
“Obviously,” I reply with false sarcasm, rolling my eyes. He smirks and drops the bag in a chair to come help me as I throw the blanket off my lap and swing my legs over the side of the bed.
My fake Sherlock was there, too, watching from over Moran’s shoulder. His face was sad, pitying, as he watched me bleed and groan in pain from what felt like everywhere on my body. I felt so sick, so

Before he can get off the floor, I’m on my knees and snatching at his dressing gown to keep him with me. “No? Sherlock?” I search his face, confused.
It was loud and they both jumped. Sherlock frowned – visitors would buzz the street door… who would be inside the building? His first thought was the girlfriend, but he rejected it even before John’s negation. It was Mycroft. Of course, it was Mycroft.
“You’ll be one of the guests.” She said. “I’m Lyn, the cook.” She’d been eating her own breakfast, but got up immediately. “You’ll be wanting coffee?”
“Dr. Mahon! Yes, thank you.” The doctor opened the door for John. In the doorframe, he turned to thank her again and saw that she was with a tall, willowy woman and a teenaged girl. Both had long auburn hair, but the girl had Dr. Mahon’s warm, brown eyes. He could smell the willowy woman’s sweet caramel scent, Dr. Mahon’s musty clove overlaying it pleasingly. The girl must have worn a suppressant as she had no scent at all. She certainly looked like an Omega with her slight frame and heart-shaped face.
“Detective Inspector...
“Yes.” Sherlock said. There was a pregnant silence. John opened his eyes. Sherlock and Shane were looking at each other, silently communicating – what, John wasn’t sure.
“Yeah, erm...” John sniffed and sighed. “How is your mother doing?”

“I never understood why you cared.” Sherlock said. “But now I do. I hate that you’re not eating.”
"You followed a recipe?" The frittata was light, fluffy – perfect.
God, I wanted him! I was on fire for him!
Chekhov's Hedge Maze raises it's ugly head....
Sherlock lifted himself up, his thighs flexing and lowered himself. He did it again, harder. And again, bouncing, landing hard, John’s cock deep within him. He adjusted slightly, leaning forward and bouncing again – gasping aloud as John’s cock found his sensitive internal pearl. He began bouncing on John’s cock faster, harder, crying out in ecstasy.
"John, no!" Sherlock brushed his fingers across my forehead, trying to smooth away my frown. "I want... it's different with you. Stay."
“Bart’s. The girl is in the morgue.” Sherlock said tightly. “We can get started tonight.”
He wasn’t in the brothel. He remembered the office, downloading files, hiding behind the door... then the sudden, agonising pain...
“Ima kill you, faggot.”
“I still need to examine you.” Dr. Baehr insisted.
I passed off the surveillance to Mycroft’s people and read the reports on the stalking pair. I doubted that either of them had been the sniper – he didn’t match the description that the clerk at the Dry Cleaners had given. And he wasn’t well-dressed. That could all be a disguise, of course, but the height was wrong. That’s harder to disguise without affecting some sort of injury.
"What do you mean?"Shane asked, unable to stop fidgeting.
I lay on the pavement. It’s cold and damp. Damp with my own blood. I try to look around, but all I can see is the sky. And the façade of a tall building. St. Bart’s.
But now, listening to him talking about me with Mrs. Hudson, I was painfully conscious of what I had put him through.
"Yeah."
Sherlock nodded, it was true. "Why did you go back in? To Moran's compound?" It bothered Sherlock that he hadn't seen that potential in Shane. Even now it was a mystery.
John looked at me and smiled softly. "I'll just be a minute, then we can sit together." He said. "I'll come right back."
Sherlock held up his hands in a ‘calm down’ motion. “
John had been exploring the room in which he was being held whilst he worked all this out, rolling along the tiled floor, searching for something sharp enough to cut through the zip ties. He was still counting out his breaths to keep his panic at bay, still forcing his fury down. The last thing he needed right now was for his base instincts to turn him into a complete raging mess.
"Dr. Watson asked me to build a fire for you." The man said, kneeling on the hearth.
I sat up, scrubbing the tears from my face. “I’m not hurt.” I told John. “I’m... fine.”
"Tea sounds lovely, actually." The woman said, not taking John's rather unsubtle hint. She had a soft, melodic voice, very feminine. Whoever she was, I hated her. "Is this yours?" Mrs. Hudson's door knob rattled suddenly, making me jump back from the door.
"John? He was fine. We continued on as before." The numb was creeping back.
It was dark, but there was still a fire burning. John was dozing in the overstuffed chair by the hearth, the remains of a dinner tray on a small table next to him. He was wearing clothes, but he'd pressed his bare skin against mine.
“I wanted to be a detective.” Lestrade agreed, thinking that his definition of ‘ambitious’ might not line up with Mycroft’s. “Seriously, you didn’t know that I fancied you?”
“What look?”
When I joined John Watson to show him 221b Baker Street that evening, I’d been well-fucked and sucked, kissed and frigged and spit-roasted (Craig’s boyfriend had joined in). My needs, I thought, had been met.
Peaky was an understatement. John was ghostly pale. He unclasped the sling, carefully unbuttoned his shirt and lifted it off his shoulder. Blood was seeping through his bandages. He swore. John gingerly pulled his shirt and sling back on. He splashed water on his face one-handed.
I frowned. I was undecided about Mary. It seemed likely that the mugging had been a setup, a way of making contact. A way for Moran – who we knew from the dry cleaner knew Moriarty – to insert himself into my life.
As we finished our meal, our conversation turned to the case.
I knew delayed orgasm was a side effect of the anti-depressants I had started taking and I'd been feeling anxious about it. So I focused on the sensations, not an end result. I had a long, slow wank thinking about John... I loved touching him: his compact, perfectly proportioned body, the strength in his arms and thighs, his firm arse, twin handfuls of muscle. I loved his hands, square and deft and so, so sensitive, always finding just the right places to touch me... his mouth, the way it traveled over my skin, hot and wet and unrelenting... the heavy weight of his bollocks, the satin covered steel of his cock... the smell of his arousal... the feel of him filling my mouth, stretching... the taste...
John reached the second floor before he encountered another person. An enervated-looking Alpha was pulling a door closed behind him and he looked up just as John came into sight.
"This is new territory for you?"
Suddenly Mary is small potatoes...
"Hell no. Being a younger sibling is great. All the perks, none of the responsibility."
“If Seb’s hurt or... you’d know what to do.”
“You’re in no shape to argue. Please, do it for me. I need you to be safe. – Hush, he’s coming.”
God! It felt wonderful to be back in London! Sherlock was glad John had gone for a walk, he was enjoying HIS city again. In his depression, he hadn't realized how much he'd missed London.
Mycroft’s smile was warm, his eyes unfocussed. “Yes. Very.”
“Hey, watch it!” Sherlock had bumped a short female – or she had bumped him. Now she stood in his path, bristling. John prodded him, and he remembered himself. He managed a low growl whilst drawing himself up to his full height and towering over her. Then John was next to him.
I jumped back at the sound of Mycroft’s voice, pushing Mary off me. I blushed red to my roots as I faced him.
"Jesus Christ, shut up! You're pathetic!" Church shook his head in disbelief. "Why did you leave him? Why did you fake your death?"
“You don’t know that.”
“Do you?” Sherlock asked softly, leaning his head against my shoulder.
He smiled, seemingly in spite of himself. "Ok. How else is this time different?"
Another punch and I was choking on blood. Vino called him off impatiently. He didn’t want me too far gone for the execution. He wanted to have his fun with the machete.
"Western exposure..." Sherlock muttered, and I realised that the afternoon sun had beat down through the window wall on the body daily.
Mycroft smiled without warmth. “I’ll check in. Make certain everything’s running smoothly.” Lestrade noted that his eyes were more green than blue. It suited his fair skin and auburn hair.
An agreement John promptly broke as soon as Sherlock came back.
Sherlock had to hide that from Moriarty at all costs. If Moriarty knew HOW MUCH John meant to him, he would kill John.
“I began applying the theorem to crime. How much crime can one person mastermind without getting caught? How many coppers does he have to bribe; how many people on the ‘inside’ will he need; how much can he steal; how many deaths; who to kill for maximum effect; how to kill for minimum risk – all strands of a web with Moriarty at the center.
He couldn't breathe!
"Yes, Sherlock. John will have been very upset by your death. He's going to feel betrayed. He might hate you for it."
— I’ll let you go then. Thanks for texting – with Seb missing, I guess I panicked a little when you disappeared too. —
I wanted to go to him. I COULD perform that miracle – and there was no one else I would do it for. I had to physically stop myself from running to John and throwing myself at his feet, begging forgiveness.
“You don’t think it was an accident, you said as much.”
Burying my face in his pillow, I remembered his breath, slow and even on my neck, the prickle of his chest hair on my spine. I felt distantly, helplessly aroused by the memory, even through my pain and exhaustion.
But Vinokourov wouldn’t be interested in a junkie whore. And Vinokourov was why I was here.
“Sherlock, she’s not –“
“I didn’t think you’d object to getting rid of a lice infestation.”
“Indeed. We are formulating plans to mount a rescue of uninfected Londoners whilst containing the infected — without shooting them willy-nilly like those trigger-happy marines.” Mycroft said testily.
"John." Sherlock heard Bob's voice through the door. "Tell me how you are feeling right now."
"That's completely different – we're bonded."
“Yes. When he turned twenty-one and took control of his trust fund, Sherlock decided to lock it into monthly payments. I thought he was being ridiculous at the time, but a few years later when he’d become a heroin addict, I saw the wisdom. He would have run though all the money if he could have.”
I climbed onto his lap, kissing him – as on the stairs, I was again similar in height. I held his head in both my hands and kissed his mouth. I was relieved and delighted that Sherlock liked to kiss, that he was good at it, passionate. There was nothing worse than desultory kisses. I loved kissing. I could lose myself in Sherlock’s kisses.
"I don't know why – I don't know what you're doing here."
"This sort of trauma... I don't think it's the sort of thing you can just ... delete. There's too much fallout. I think you'll have to work through it."
It was growing dark and I was on the verge of contacting Mycroft to demand that he locate John via CCTV when I heard the front door. It was John’s tread on the stair – even as I sighed with relief and lay my violin in its case, I girded myself for the final blow. I would have my dignity, I resolved, if nothing else.
Sherlock tried again. "John, it was Church." He croaked.
Eventually John had worked three fingers in. "John, give me more...I want your whole hand inside me." Sherlock moaned. John slipped a fourth finger in slowly and making a cone of his fingers, added his thumb. He fucked Sherlock's arse with his hand, feeling him open up.
How had she managed to get behind the scrotum of a man under the covers in a suit of pajamas? John could think of one or two ways but they all involved sex acts. She HAD been strangely preoccupied with sex that night she found Shane and Sherlock sharing his bed.
He still felt calmer – the jittery, nauseating rage had dissipated – but sleep was elusive. All his questions going round and round through his mind: why? Why!? John didn't even really care how, just WHY!?
"William, don't panic. Do you trust John?"
Dr. Baehr rode in the ambulance with me monitoring my vitals and showing her notes to another doctor. If he introduced himself, I missed it.
I crept through the first floor flat to the front door. There was no spy hole, but I could hear them perfectly. Hearing John's voice made me want to weep.
Sherlock put the carton of noodles he was opening down and stepped close to John. Close enough that their foreheads almost touched, John could feel the tickle of Sherlock’s dark curls. Sherlock’s big hand covered John’s cheek and his lips pressed against John’s. John felt inhibited, kissing in front of Shane, but he let Sherlock kiss his mouth and his jaw and his neck… then pushed him away, stealing a guilty glance at Shane.
He wondered if he should break up with Shane. Surely he was doing him a disservice. He wasn't treating him right whilst he struggled with his feelings for Sherlock.
"Erg, looks like a pretty big gash... yeah, you're going to need stitches."
“How do you know Vic?” I asked.
"It's not Vic, not really ... it was Dad. I mean, how would you feel if your Dad suddenly took up with a... a..." He had the decency to blush.
John: I’ll make it up to you when I get back, I promise.
"You're drunk, John." I told him. "Sleep it off."
Everyone looked up, taking in the tall Omega and his unobtrusive Alpha. Sherlock knew they were tasting his new scent and staring at John. They all knew about the riot – several of the uniformed Betas had been there. Seeing the bondmates now set them abuzz.
“They are totally doing it.” John said.
"Oh, so we're back to pity, are we? Acting like a git is more becoming, John."
I sighed and let myself relax against him.
"How did you change his mind?"
“She’s keeping tabs on you.” He said with certainty.
“I do. I want to know you better. You lost someone you loved, same as me... you know all about Sherlock. I don’t even know your friend’s name.”
Sherlock didn't struggle, he turned onto his side and curled his knees into his chest. John's hand lingered on his shoulder, Sherlock registered THAT despite the convulsions in his body expelling sick into the little trough that appeared under his chin, despite the pain in his chest, spiking with every heave, every breath.
He opened my mouth with his tongue assertively. John's kisses were hard, greedy. One hand grasped my neck, the other still clung to my collar.
hopeful that they can be recovered — some of the experts believe the disease simply has to run its course.” Mycroft looked dubious. “That would be a best-case-scenario.”
‘Mine,’ John’s base instinct insisted.
"You had to believe so THEY would believe it..."
“This first.” His words gusted by my ear making my hair stand on end with desire. “John, I need you... I need to feel you...”
Sherlock stood stiffly and walked to the door. He didn't look back. He opened the door, walked through it, closed it behind him and leaned on it – he was both drained and wired. And confused.
“It’s open.”
“Nothing so dramatic.”
“Interesting.” Sherlock said.
"I want John. And I don't have him. You don't have who you want, Church... maybe you don't deserve him."
It was several, gruelling, terrifying hours before he recognised Baker Street. Lestrade fought his way to 221B and pounded on the door, shouting to be let in — dangerous, by then he knew that the silent infected were attracted by loud noises. Every infected in earshot followed him to Sherlock and John’s door.
“Wales? When?”
“Yes.” I said, sitting up. “I would like a wash.” I smiled back at him and accepted the hand he extended to pull me upright.
“Yeah.”
He could still feel it, his left hand, feel it as if it were still there. John thought he was reasonably brave, he'd established that in Afghanistan for certain. But he didn't feel brave enough to look and see that the hand his senses insisted was just fine was, in fact, gone.
John brought him a mug of tea and set it on the coffee table. Sherlock saw that he was hard in his jeans and felt an answering throb in his own groin. He felt flushed. Sherlock groped for his own pulse and felt it racing. This was a very different start to his heat… so much gentler.
The big Alpha jerked him forward and Sherlock couldn’t smother his cry of misery.
"It IS important." He insisted. "Consider this: maybe you relapsed because you didn't take rehab seriously enough. If you want to get back to your girlfriend, it's time to abandon this 'bored' pose and start working at it."
Finally... finally! I felt the muscles in his back unclench. His breathing calmed and his trembling stilled. I ran a hand through the coarse, dark curls gently. “Good?” I asked.
“Yes, of course. I’m fine.” John said brusquely, closing his eyes again, shutting Sherlock out, dismissing him.
Unlike an Army spouse, I had no contact with him. Everyone thought he was dead and I had nothing to contradict them – no notes or texts or any of the things one might get from a loved one abroad.
I try to keep it there, not think about having him as my lover. Not think about his lean body rocking beneath me, reacting to my every movement, my every breathe, flushed and perfect, eager for my cock, my cum, my kisses... waking beside him, the morning light making his pale skin glow. My fingers on his arm, his neck, in his hair. My lips pressed against his. The look in his eyes, hungry, sad, grateful for whatever scrap I give him - he should never settle for scraps! He deserves a lover who cherishes him. (Up close I can see the scars. They weren't there before - who has cut you, my love? Who has hurt you, beaten you, left this evidence of pain? How have you struggled on your own?)
“Mr. Holmes? Can you tell me what you took?”
I wished the sniper would just do it. Just put me out of this misery. Because what was I supposed to do now?! Goddammit, Sherlock! What was I supposed to do without him?!
It was Angus' turn to sigh. "I did. Taz... he went back to Sheffield. We'd been together for seven years – five here in London. I thought we were happy... classic story, I guess. Taz got the seven year itch... I knew something was off, but not..." The nurse shook his head ruefully. "He started seeing a chap from back home... I didn't know until he moved out. So stupid..."
I couldn't give it to him.
I lay down next to him, on top of the duvet, and closed my eyes.
“You’re close, then.”
The smuggler giggled with delight. “That was YOU, English? I heard about you! Cops find you covered in blood with a skinned corpse still screaming.”
“That story wasn’t very accurate.” I told Mary. “I wasn’t... we weren’t together then. Not romantically.”
“However," Mycroft continued. "I did learn that he apprenticed with an IRA bomb maker for a while – until she turned up dead. That was a bit of a theme, almost everyone with whom he had a relationship died or disappeared – including his parents and his sister.” The Alpha clutched his umbrella. “I don’t know how I didn’t see it…”
"I'm guessing you need some time alone." He said.
“You’re so beautiful.” I told him. “I’m happy... I can’t believe how happy.”
I suddenly came to the realisation that I had to move. I couldn’t afford the flat on my own. And I couldn’t bear to have someone else living there, sitting in Sherlock’s chair. Touching Sherlock’s things... No. I had to find a place of my own where everything didn’t remind me of him. A fresh start. A clean slate.
That's what made John feel the worst – it sounded just like something Sherlock would say and she knew that because John had told her in his blog. He wondered how much the paper had paid her.
Sherlock opened his eyes. Shane was leaning over him looking concerned. He glanced around – they were in a lift and John was not with them.
“Of course I do.” John said. “The real question is... why did you ever bother with ME, Sherlock? Let alone, fall in love?” He must have heard my ambivalence and thought it was about him.
Lestrade hurried over. “DI Coleman says you can have five minutes.” He said. “He’s over here.” He led them deeper into the laneway, then around back of a building. There, among the bins, lay the body of a slim teen. The male Omega had had a delicate prettiness that clung to him in death.
"Not at all."
“Three.” I mumbled, unable to meet his eyes.
Walter's laugh is an unamused bark. "You think I don't know?! After almost thirty years, I STILL find myself looking for ways to score."
He couldn’t remember.  John’s earliest memory was of his father yelling at him to put the baby down... and her unhappy cries when he obeyed.
He kissed my neck, ran his teeth across my jaw and nipped at my ear. It sent shivers through me – directly to my groin. John felt my erection against his hip, he paused.
Sherlock bolted the door – noting the heavy-duty security bar that fit across it – and followed the voice.
The nurse's eyes narrowed. "Looking for something to steal, are ya? Though you'd rumble the dead man?"
“It’s too suspicious, John, you being up here this long.” He slid off the bed, wary of what sort of silhouette he might cast on the shade. “We can’t afford to arouse their suspicions now!”
I can not stand by and allow such reckless, fear-driven behavior to destroy what is possibly the most interesting and important scientific discovery of our time. I only hesitate here to document what I saw and what I know in case I do not make it out of this situation alive. Though I expect the villagers of Werben will have their own version of this tale, perhaps some day the true story may be told.
“Then I shall mourn your loss, Mr. Holmes,” he said sadly. He walked away from me, heading to his office at the completion of our conversation.

for him. Technically, I died for him. (I would do it again, in a much more permanent fashion, if required.) What could he possibly want from me that would cause such anxiety? He already asked me to be his best man, already asked me for assistance with planning his wedding (
“Who was helping him? John? Did you see?” Sherlock asks, eyes flicking over to him. John remains quiet, his lips pressed tightly together as he fights with his amygdala, breath moving rapidly in his lungs. Despite my usual rule of remaining detached, watching him war against himself stirs something high in my throat, making it difficult to swallow and my mouth uncomfortably dry.
A quick glance to my right reveals my hallucinated companion, face twisted up while he watches my malicious rage at his brother. His eyes are dark, pleading and pained.
“Afternoon,” John says, clearing his throat. He smiles over at me, a curt one full of stress and fear. He removes his coat and hangs it up, shutting the door to the flat in the process.
The snark in his voice was unmistakable--he thought John was an idiot. And, perhaps he
“Come in.” Sherlock said. “I want you to.”
“Is he at all apologetic? Does he understand how he hurt you?”
He hated Moran even more for sending his John there.
Somewhat less mild, but still not troubling was when John said quite tersely to “Stop fussing!” He knew I worried about his hip – and more fundamentally, his safety from the criminal element I attracted. But he had little patience for my worries. When he was terse, I let him be no matter my concerns. At least I had thus far.
He just hadn’t realized that while he and Shane had been bickering about what to do and how to save him, Moran had tied John up and left him to slowly die from lack of blood flow. John’s left hand had died first.
I was certain now that he was coming on to me. “I wouldn’t bet against you.”
I struggled – edging my own climax – to fuck him through it, to watch his face, see what I had done to him.
Sherlock finished with the body and took the samples to one of the adjacent laboratories. Lestrade took his leave with a mumbled “Text me if you find anything.” John helped Sherlock prepare slides.
“The day you and Mycroft look alike is the day you can go find another mate.”
Dad couldn't seem to stop himself from one-upping everyone. Even his own son. John knew his dad didn't like to be challenged, but it wasn’t fair. John really loved Rugby and Dad was ruining it. “Dad, I
Before I was distracted, I had been composing. It was easier to do with my violin, but I hadn't touched an instrument in over two years. I composed in my head, letting the melody flow through my brain, seeing the notes... it kept my mind busy, kept me from dwelling on my situation.

That roused me. I opened the door to the library and stepped aside to allow them to enter. Mycroft pushed John over the threshold and grabbed me savagely.
Sherlock shook his head. “I…”
John laughed self-deprecatingly. "I got lucky."
Sherlock learns more about the man following John. And he learns more about John's boyfriend.
“I was honestly shocked when he stepped out of hiding. I had no idea he was there. I expect Moran was equally as surprised – it gave us the upper hand.”
The tip of John’s Alpha cock pierced the tiny passage into the Omega’s womb and John came and came and came, shooting copiously into the sweet tunnel, breeding Sherlock with wave upon wave of intensely satisfying pleasure. This was what their bodies were made for!
“We’re setting a trap for Moran.” Sherlock told me. “We’re going to draw him out and capture him. You brought your gun?”
I stayed on the couch all day and all night, dozing in and out of consciousness. I left it only for the toilet and  for tea.
It was good, Sherlock told himself sternly, that John had someone he could talk to, who understood. Who could help him. Sherlock would simply have told John to stop being an idiot – perhaps he even had.
“Good.” He surveyed John’s prone, helpless form again. “Let’s get him ready.”
“Nazer?” I asked, dreading the answer.
"Yes." Sherlock said quickly.
It was late in the day when John carried the last box of Sherlock’s stuff up the seventeen stairs to their flat and collapsed into the comfy chair in front of the fireplace. The skull already decorated the mantle. If Sherlock had unpacked anything else, John couldn’t see it.
