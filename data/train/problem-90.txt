“Yes it was. I told you I am responsible for my own actions. Me hurting you? Yeah, that’s not okay. Ever. Okay?” John breathed into Sherlock's shoulder.
"That's why I had to die, John. That's why you had to think...If they realized you weren't mourning they might have..."
“Shit, sorry. I didn’t mean... clearly you’ve had some sort of… shit. I just, I didn’t mean to trivialize whatever,” he gestures his hands vaguely at Sherlock, “happened to you like that.”
A vein pops out of John’s neck as his expression tightens, only to be softened by an unexpected sound.
John lowers his arm. “Christ, on second thought, maybe you were onto something. We should just get out of here. We can go back home and get you some rest.”
Hey Sherlock, can we talk about something serious for a second? It's been a decent amount of months now and I know that isn't super long in the grand scheme of things but I think I'm ready. I want to come home. I might still have outbursts or bad days, but I've been doing a lot better. I swear on my life I will never, ever, lay hands on you again. And as for my bad days, I know you get them too so maybe we can help each other? We'll know what to say and what not to say. I may never again be the younger man you fell for, I certainly have a lot more baggage now, but I'm doing good. Real good. And you seem like you are too. If you disagree then that's okay, I'll wait for you.
“Because I love you,” Sherlock sobbed. “Romantic love is more intense than anything I have ever felt before and I don’t know what to do. I don’t have the outlets most people have for their sentiment since you are not… gay. And so I did what I normally do, self-destruct.” The words are being pulled out of his chest. It hurts. It hurts more than he expected and he leans even more into John. It shouldn’t be this hard. John knew already; it wasn’t difficult to deduce he read the letter and he almost said it himself mere seconds ago. Yet all the muscles that make up his heart are pulling, straining.
“I tried so hard to ignore this fact. I tried everything else. I denied and denied that that is what I wanted because I thought it was impossible. I thought you had no interest in romantic relationships. I didn’t want to press or pry. And on top of that you’re a man and it- it’s difficult for me, that. Not because I’m not gay, but because of what other people think. With Harry I saw how cruel people can be… my own family. I was supposed to be the normal one and look how I turned out,” he scoffs.
John’s focus reorients to Sherlock. “You’re going to tell me. Right now. Over a nice dinner. And yes you do have to eat it and no I don’t care that you don’t like steak.”
Look at me I'm actually posting a new chapter for this fic lol I told you guys it would happen eventually ;)
It is the middle of the night. Logically, John knows that nothing adventurous is likely to happen. Everyone most likely went to bed. However, John’s hands, steady and taught, don’t seem to acknowledge this. The strong, swift contractions in his chest are oblivious as well.
I get why Sherlock said we need to work on ourselves, I do. As much as I wanted to take him to bed that day in Baker Street, I couldn't. It wouldn't be right. It would have felt like sorrow, loss. We'd be trying to prove our feelings to each other. We would be thinking of all the years we lost. We would be thinking about how stupid we are for not seeing this in each other sooner. We would be in our heads. I want to be in the moment. I want it to feel like love and reunion and rejoicing. I want him to smile and laugh. I miss him.
“It wasn’t enough. She was perfect. She was everything I wanted. She was clever, funny, a tad rude, incredibly dangerous, skilled, she
I am sorry. I am so, so sorry, John. I killed your wife. I took everything away from you, every sense of stability you ever had, with her and with me. I’m going to talk about the fall now. I know this is hard for you so please skip this section if you must. But I need you to know. I need you to know I am not a machine. You were my best friend. You were the closest to getting to know me, to understanding me, more so than anyone else. I need you to know this. I need someone to know the things left unsaid.
I spent the following two years travelling the world tearing down Moriarty’s web bit-by-bit. It was an endless mission, one I was not sure I would ever finish. I considered settling down in the country and making a new life there, but I kept pushing, walking through the web, because I could not bare the thought of never returning to our flat again, of never seeing you again, John.
John walks over and sits at the edge of the bed, laughter dwindling. “So,” he begins conversationally, “Can’t sleep?”
"Look, I know you're eager and I know we've been doing a whole lot of talking and nothing else but this is important. You'll like it."
Sherlock took a deep, unsteady breath, dropped his shirt and dressing gown to the floor, and turned around, his head lowered. His face hidden.
I think he's doing good. He seems good. He seems happy. Content. I think I may be too, or at least, I am as content as I'll ever be considering everything.
It's been almost 2 months since my last drink. That means something, yeah? I'll tell Sherlock, maybe he'll agree to meet up in person soon.
God, we never talked about Rosie. We never even mentioned her. She's such a huge part of my life and we never discussed how she will fit in in all of this. When I eventually come home, will Sherlock be okay with having her there? He will need to baby-proof the whole flat, which, in Sherlock's case, would involve a complete change in lifestyle. The experiments? The body parts? The swords? They would all have to go. Would Sherlock be okay with that?
Sherlock remained frozen, every muscle in his body stuck in place as John grabbed him by his hair and pulled him in. Their lips met, brushing gently, hesitantly, Sherlock's barely moving, his body unable to catch up with his mind as John's parted lips pushed against his own.
None of this is meant to be an excuse. I did not involve you. I left you in the dark. I tactlessly came back with no warning. I ruined your engagement. I am selfish. But I need you to understand that the decisions I made, the things I endured, were for you. I wanted to be with you. I value you, your thoughts, your opinions, your expertise, your companionship. I have feelings, John, I’m just too much of a pretentious arsehole to show them.
“So why don’t you go to bed in the spare room, make yourself at home, and I’ll go to my room. I’ll give John a call and make sure he’s alright so we don’t have to worry about him. Sound acceptable to you, Mr. Detective?”
Sherlock stiffened, managing the strength to raise his head and read John's face as he talked. "When I was away I needed to destroy Moriarty's web. I couldn't risk coming back to Baker Street until this was done in case there was a chance that… well I'm sure you can deduce that on your own. So I spent two years wandering the world, dismantling pieces of the web one by one until...Serbia. I'm sure you can-" he gestured vaguely back at John.
her. I did everything I could to keep you together because I thought that’s what you wanted. I... I’m the reason you’re miserable. I kept you in a marriage that made you unhappy and that’s what drove you to text this woman. I am to blame, John. This is not your fault.”
“Yes, and I her, but Mrs. Hudson, Greg, and all the others will have.. expectations upon my return that I cannot fulfill.”
“He doesn’t blame you either, not really. He knows it’s not your fault. ‘Cause it’s not. You know that, right?”
“John, the excitement made you happy, not me. I made you miserable. I am rude and callous and despicable. Even setting the larger infractions aside, I drove you to near insanity on a day-to-day basis. It would be better for you to find a new hobby to fulfill your adrenaline kick, or maybe a career change. It’s never too late, you know. You could always be an EMT. It doesn’t pay as well but it would suit you. Or maybe pick up an interest in skydiving, who knows.”
They sit in silence for a few moments, both letting the shock sink into their bodies, letting their heartbeats slow until they match each other’s in a slow, steady pace.
“A discarded towel on a wooden chair. A small bookshelf. Pictures of you and… her. A fake echeveria in a ceramic pot.”
“All I’ve wanted all these years was for you to do those things, utilize those outlets like ordinary people. That is what’s been missing this entire time. That’s the gap, the variable. That’s why I am never happy,” John accepts.
“I see. I am very sorry, John. I knew I caused you so much pain, it should not be a surprise that having me in your life has had that… impact. Since your happiness is incompatible with our friendship, it’s best that we remain separated. I shouldn’t have let you in here. I should have turned you away at the door. I know what I am, John. And if I’m right and you read my letter, you do too. It was much easier to tell you to go through the letter than it is to do in person. I don’t know if I can say my farewell.”
As the anger has now built up and subsided, John doesn’t feel the same emptiness as before, but regret and sadness finally seeped out of his core.
John let go of Sherlock and stepped back to observe his face. His heart and mind were racing as he wondered if he made a terrible mistake. Sherlock was completely unmoving, paralyzed. John had seen him do this before, but that was of little comfort given how much of himself he just put on display. He wanted to run, to walk out, go home to Rosie, but he knew if he did he could never come back. He could never face Sherlock after this. So he waited.
“I mean, yeah, but it isn’t like what you think. I know you are still you and we’re good-ish and I can be honest around you I just…”
“Christ,” John exclaims as he looks up at the towering staircase spiraling upwards and glances back down at the distant floor below. “Wish this woman also gave you a key to an elevator to get up here. Maybe a crane.”
John huffs and stares straight forward, his mind should be racing, he should be grieving, worried for himself, for Sherlock. He should feel sick and yet he feels nothing. He thinks nothing. His mind is blank.
“Yes. Well I would use, chase criminals around London, and play the violin. Of course, since I met you they are no longer needed for that purpose and now I turn to them for… other things.”
Sherlock begins to look around. “A wooden wardrobe. A discarded hospital gown. A laundry bin,” he mumbles.
“Yeah.” John lifts his hand to the back of his neck. “Sorry ‘bout that. Just a lot to, you know, process. Didn’t want to do it here.”
“Yes! Now let’s take a break before your legs collapse under themselves,” John commands, cautiously surveying his friend’s current condition. He frowns as Sherlock’s thighs shake when he proceeds to sit down.
“Of course it is! Of course it’s my bloody fault! It always is. I make my own decisions, Sherlock. You did not make me cheat on Mary. You did not make me stay with her. I
“That’s great. I love when I invite someone into my home, they scare my soon-to-be-husband half to death, I console said husband and convince him to go talk to the new guest, make dinner, and then spend the next half hour having a conversation with said guest as he hardly pays attention, then basically tells me that he hates me and to piss off. Ya know, in my own home.” A brittle smile crawls on Mary’s face as she leans back in her chair and looks Sherlock in the eye.
“She couldn’t fill the entire gap, just a large chunk of it. And then I went and tried to do it myself, texting some strange woman I met on the bus when Mary was with our
Sherlock looks up at her and is surprised to find her expression open and eyes crinkled with mirth, as she relaxes into her seat once more.
“Mm, yeah. She told me she wants to come with us on cases sometime.” Another pause. “I know it’s kind of our thing, but hey, this way I won’t have to deal with another girlfriend jealous of how much time I spend with you,” he punctuates, pointing at Sherlock.
“Yeah, you’re right. It just- it feels so wrong, you know? The normalcy. Makes you feel out of place.”
“Yeah, I can get back into writing,” John agrees. “Just you and me against the rest of the world,” he says, smiling. But the smile soon fades. “What do ya think about Mary?” he asks. “Honestly.”
“I don’t think I can live without it,” John states honestly. “But I don’t know if I can do this right now. There’s still so much to talk through and work through and I
Is calling Sherlock every day against the rules? I don't think he knows either and he made the rules, the git. I suppose it's fine, we're still getting space to ourselves and that was the whole point, right? I'm not smothering him or anything.
“No!” John blurts. “I mean, yeah, I would like to know quite a lot of things but I know some things can be difficult. I don’t want to force you to, you know.”
That day on the roof I had to jump. Moriarty had snipers. One on Lestrade, one on Mrs. Hudson, and one on you. They were instructed to shoot all three of you unless I killed myself. Mycroft and I saw this as a possibility and staged a plan for me to fake my death. I never wanted you to be there, never wanted you to see me like that, but you knew me well enough to know where I would be and to know I would need you, that I lied to you about Mrs. Hudson and was about to do something terribly stupid. You were right, as always. I am sorry you had to witness that.
“Just look at you. On your side, still as a board, breathing gently. You never sleep like that. You usually look like an octopus flailing around, mumbling some nonsense, and drooling into my Union Jack pillow.”
“You can’t keep sacrificing yourself and letting me do whatever I want because you lo-. Ahem. It isn’t healthy. You know this. You
I made great progress but never finished the job. I was apprehended. Held captive. Tortured. Mycroft found me and retrieved me from my cell. He thought it best I went home. At that point I could no longer disagree. It was dangerous of me. Selfish. There are still people out there loyal to Moriarty. Luckily none of them have come for you, I beg they never do.
“I met you and you showed me what it is like to live again. You did. Not the cases, although they did help, but it was
Upon listing and acknowledging these facts it is becoming very difficult to accept our departure from one another, but this is something we both must do, for your sake.
“Not everyone knew who I was when all of that happened anyways. I was hardly a celebrity. Most of them knew what the hat looked like better than my visage to begin with. They hardly recognized me without it even at the height of all of this.”
John took a step back, his hand grasping at his mouth and pulling at the side of his jaw. His eyes dashed around every raised line on Sherlock's back. "Jesus, Sherlock," he whispered. Suddenly he felt his whole body boiling. "What case could possibly be worth this?" he sneered, his left fist clenching and unclenching rhythmically.
“And if you do need me to change something- if I ever trigger you and don’t realize or if I’m just being a standard dick, you can always- there’s no shame in-”
They think about the future. They think about the past. They think about what was, what could have been, and what will never be. They think about their regrets and their sorrows. They let their minds wander freely without judgement or anger, thoughts streaming down multiple paths, slowly trickling away. They fall asleep.
Do I even remember the last time I wrote anything? Nope. Do I remember the plot of this fic? Kinda. Did I reread this fic to make sure this chapter made sense? Nah. Let me know if I messed anything up terribly lmao. Also every comment adds a year to my life so talk to my lonely quarantined ass pls
“Today I want to re-acquaint myself with London. This walk has made it apparent to me that I am not used to it anymore: the people, the noises. What once faded into the background now seems jarring.”
“I’m sorry, Sherlock. You have suffered so much because of me and I haven’t shown you any gratitude. I-I
Sherlock stood there shaking his head, running his hands through his hair, pulling. "I. Can't. John...please."
Do not worry about me. I did briefly consider returning to old habits. Suicide, even. But I have learned. You have taught me that my life is important, that it has value. I do not want to risk hurting you the way I hurt you before. Even thinking about doing so is intolerable.
“You will. I will. Because we need to come back to each other, John. Neither of us are in the place for a healthy relationship right now, you practically said so yourself. And I won’t be able to be around you and support you in my current state; I’ll keep hurting myself. You were right.”
Sherlock took a deep breath and looked at John in the eyes. "John, I need you to make one more deduction," he implored, his heart racing, his hands becoming ice cold, nausea building up as the room began to spin. "Please."
“There must be a pattern somewhere, some variable we aren’t seeing,” Sherlock lifts his fingers to his temples.
God I'm being ridiculous I should just call him and ask to come over and get this on with. There's no reason I should be writing a goddamn script. I'm just so bad at these things.
you and everyone bloody else! I am an idiot. I am an idiot for not seeing what my own best friend was feeling. I
“I knew it!” She crosses her arms confidently over her chest as a smirk builds on her face. “Give me another one!”
Sherlock's been taking mood stabilizers. Sherlock. Apparently he's been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. I should have seen it. The not talking for days on end, his self-sacrificing that could practically be considered self-harm… he was depressed, not sulking. I think he has been for a while. Refusing to sleep and eating, running around the flat at 1000 miles per hour, making terribly risky decisions… the drugs. He was manic. God, I am a shit friend. A shit, shit friend. And doctor.
John is prepared for this and resists the motion, bracing himself on the wall, and surprised at his own apparent strength as Sherlock struggles to move his arm.
“Green checkered shirt. Brown belt. Jeans. Navy socks.” His breathing begins to slow. “And a, quite frankly, horrible mustache.”
"But...why? Why do all this just to come back to Baker Street with...me? I'm sure there are plenty of other cases elsewhere," John challenged.
I really should have done this "talking about how I feel" thing earlier. He does love her. He wants to be a father figure to her. He wants to be her dad. I don't know why I find this so unbelievable, but here I am, staring at her as she sleeps thinking about her growing up with the two of us together. He assures me that this sacrifice is not self-harming so it doesn't count. I always thought taking aspects of The Work away from Sherlock would be the definition of harming him, but now I think losing me would be worse. I can't believe that I'm that important to him. I don't deserve him.
But you wouldn’t tell me things. Important things. You kept me out and then you left me. Mary came into my life and she was clever and a bit of a smart-arse and who knows, maybe I picked up on the fact that she was an adrenaline junkie too. And she began to fill in the gaping hole you left and it was nice. And I loved her, I really, really did. But you came back. You came back and living with her and being with her when I knew I could be home instead was difficult, especially after mourning that home for two whole years. I yearned for it every day. Any time someone knocked on the door I thought it was you. Everywhere I looked I saw you.”
“I am thinking perhaps we could just walk around a bit more. Maybe grab lunch, go to St. James Park, purchase some drinks and head to an old bolthole of mine.”
This is so dumb, why can't I just see him already? Why can't we be together? It's been years. We've been in love for years. And we still haven't done anything about it. Still.
“Yes,” Sherlock consents. “That could work. Maybe she’ll even be useful; it could be convenient having another medical professional around.”
“I can’t believe this is an old bolthole of yours. Seriously, Sherlock. How did you get access to this?” John marvels, eyes widening as he looks up at his friend.
“I thought I failed you. I thought it was some kind of test when you acted like you didn’t care about Mrs. Hudson. I thought you were trying to test me to see if I still believed in you and that I failed and by the time I realized that and I ran after you you already made your decision. You were up there on that- that roof, and I failed.”
John makes a noise of compliance, then reaches his arm around his friend, supporting his weight and providing assistance with surprisingly little resistance as they ascend the staircase once more.
“Not one associated with my previous drug use,” Sherlock explains. “One I use to get away from Mycroft when he sticks his fat nose in my business.”
Sherlock came to after several drawn-out moments, overly aware that he was being scrutinized by John. John who just kissed him.
“Yeah. I understand that. I think that’s why when I came back from Afghanistan I stayed at that miserable flat I couldn’t really afford for so long. I wasn’t ready for a permanent place. I wasn’t ready to settle down again.”
As he peeks his head in, a long figure wrapped in a sheet laying on one side with a mop of curls sitting at the top comes into view. A chest moves slowly, steadily, up and down.
“Alright, alright. Don’t worry, you’re still quite fetching even with that dead caterpillar nestling above your mouth just- there,” he points at said affronting caterpillar.
“Honestly though, she’s been great,” John insists. “Really. Really great. Great! She’s amazing! Brilliant! She keeps me on my toes and pushes me.” He pushes his arms forward in demonstration. “Sometimes she’s a bit much but I need it, ya know? I mean, in comparison to chasing a criminal around the entiiire city of London, dealing with her is no biggie,” he jokes. “But she keeps me on top of my game. Tippity top. Stops me from going back into That Place. It’s good, yeah? I love her. Really! I do.”
“I know you aren’t broken of course you aren’t,” John sighs. “However, that doesn’t mean you’re fine either. And even if you were fine, it’s still my responsibility to not hurt the people around me.”
Sherlock lifts his head up, raising an eyebrow. “Don’t you think it is a bit late for this? Shouldn’t you yourself have retired by now anyways? Your fiancé is waiting for you after all.”
“John, look at me,” Sherlock instructs him, and it is strange to be the one taking orders for once.  John complies, though, and lifts his head, allowing Sherlock to turn his face so that John is looking directly at him, staring into fathomless quicksilver eyes.
As he says the words he knows that they are true; they’ve always been true, no matter how hard he had tried to fight them in the past.  Finally admitting them out loud eases something in his chest that has been gripping him painfully, something he hasn’t even noticed until the pressure of it begins to lessen, its constricting hold loosening, and John realises that he can breathe finally, for the first time in what seems like far too long.
Sherlock won’t meet his gaze, though.  “Then why won’t you penetrate me?” he asks softly, a small blush dusting his pale face.  “You’ve never even gotten close to acting like you want to.”
Now John is really frustrated.  He hates when Sherlock talks in riddles.  “What are you on about?  Come on, this isn’t funny anymore, I smell disgusting over here!”
“Pretty much, yeah,” John said, as his smug smile came back.  He squirmed slightly in his chair, but tried not to show it.  Hearing the words ‘let me ride your cock’ coming out of Sherlock’s mouth, no matter how sarcastic they sounded, was enough to get his dick stirring in his trousers.
John’s hand roughly pushed Sherlock’s own away from his cock, gripping the hard flesh harshly and stroking it, making Sherlock moan into John’s mouth and buck up into the blonde’s hand and body.
“Mmm, what?” he asks sleepily.  They had woken early in the morning and stayed awake all day, not wanting to waste a single moment of their last day together, and he is tired.  The rest of the weekend had been spent much the same way: too much excitement and activity, too little sleep.  For Sherlock it is not a hardship, for John it is something that he has not done since his days in the Army and his mind is a little foggy around the edges.
gave in.  You saw something that you wanted, and you took it.  Take me, John.  Please.  I want you to.”
“Well, Mrs. Hudson helped a bit,” Sherlock said, slightly embarrassed by John’s reaction to Callum’s room.
This is how he lives his life now, and he’ll be damned if he is going to feel ashamed of it.  How could he, when Sherlock is pounding into him, using his body so sweetly?
give him.  So many wonderful things, many of which he had thought he had lost forever in the Baker Street fire.
His fingers slip out and leave Sherlock’s hole gaping emptily at him, enticingly.  The skin around his entrance looks so soft and tender, deliciously pink from use, and John has the sudden undeniable urge to taste it.  He’s never done that with a lover before, never had it done to him.  He’s never felt the desire.  But Sherlock’s arse looks so gorgeous, spread out for him, waiting to be used any way he wants.
They didn’t speak for a little while, remaining quiet as the waitress brought their drinks and they ordered a few more rounds, John deciding that it would be safer if he stuck to beer after his shot. He knew that Lestrade was waiting for him to say something, that he was wanting John to bring up the reason for the doctor’s anger, but John couldn’t seem to find the right words while he was sober.
“John, wait—!” he hears Sherlock say from his spot on the floor, struggling to stand as John barrels into the bedroom, but John is done waiting for him.  Sherlock is still on the floor when John enters the room, and the man looks down at him with a stern frown on his face that quickly turns into one of exasperation as he looks at the extent of the damage done this time.
“No, love,” John says with a small smile and a shake of his head, “I’m all right.”  Instead, he moves down the bed and drags Sherlock into his arms as he lies on his back, holding him close and stroking Sherlock’s bare arms absent-mindedly.
Sherlock lights up at the mention of a present from his Daddy, just like John knew he would.  John reaches over to the coffee table awkwardly, careful not to upset the squirming pile of teenage Sherlock in his lap.  He opens it one-handed, drawing out the contents inside, and presents it to Sherlock proudly, not able to keep the stupid, goofy smile off of his face, although the edges of it are curbed by a sudden nervousness.  He doesn’t know if it will ever stop being nerve-wracking, buying gifts like this for his very adult, very temperamental, very
“You,” Sherlock pants out, turning his face towards John to kiss him, his body relaxing deeply after his orgasm, muscles going loose and lax.  “Now you.”
Sherlock winces and bites harder on his bottom lip, fighting against the urge to admit that he was bad but not wanting to disobey his Daddy again.  “I was—” he begins, but lets out a strangled little sob as John thrusts harshly into him.  “I was a naughty boy, Daddy.  I’m sorry.”  John pulls another sob from him as he surges up into Sherlock.
Sherlock bites his lip and stays still for a moment before seeming to make a decision.  He nods his head once, silently, and gets up from his seat, moving cautiously over to John and taking up the position.  He lays down across John’s legs gingerly with his stomach across John’s lap.  His long legs are dangling over the side of the chair, his feet braced on the floor.  He doesn’t seem to know what to do with his arms, so he puts them under his chest for now, a bit awkwardly, trapped between his body and John’s lap.
He moves back into the dining room with a dish rag in one hand and his cane in the other, supporting his leg.  Mary’s mobile is still lying on the tabletop, so John moves it over to wipe the wooden surface clean.  While he is scrubbing he hears the sound of a phone going off and looks up to see that Mary’s mobile has lit up, an unlisted number ringing through.
“It wasn’t the checkup today that did it,” McNairn said as the boys quickly scanned the article. “It was released today. There’s no official confirmation yet, since no one who knows you personally has made a statement. But with a photo like this, a statement confirming the pregnancy is just a nicety.”
Sherlock trembles under his tongue.  “I…I feel empty,” he moans, breath fogging on the dark wood surface that his face is pressed into.  “I don’t like it.”
Sherlock slammed the door shut again with a rattle of the pane of glass that was on it, turning to the detective and giving him a murderous look.  “Don’t sit there and tell me what you think my child deserves,” he said quietly, voice shaking with his constraint.  His hands clenched into fists at his side and he had the most obsessive urge to punch Lestrade in the face, repeatedly, until his hands were covered in the other man’s blood.
“I thought I did, too,” John answers Mike softly, carefully.  “But I guess I was just lying to myself, trying to make myself feel better about what I thought I was stuck with.”  He shakes his head sadly.  “But that wasn’t love, mate.  I fell out of love with her a long time ago.  I just didn’t want to admit it.  I kept thinking that I could fix it, that I could make it better, that I could learn to love her again.  But you can’t learn to love someone after they’ve done something like that to you.  Not when they don’t want to learn to love you back.”
“Greg, go easy on him,” John scolded the detective inspector once Sherlock was out of earshot.  “He’s not having an easy time of it, you know.”
“Ready for it, baby?” he asks, letting his fingers trail softly along the rim of Sherlock’s arse, checking one last time to see how open he is.  John doesn’t like not having lube on hand, even though Sherlock used it earlier, so he makes a last ditch effort to coat himself as liberally as he can with spit.  He can feel that his saliva makes everything even slicker, so he knows that Sherlock used a water based lubricant; he adds a little more spit to help things along.  The soft, relaxed muscle clenching around his fingers does much to reassure him as well and draws a groan out of his throat, and John can’t hold back any longer.  He grips his cock and lines himself up, then pushes slowly inside the indescribable heat of Sherlock’s body, cursing.
John flushes deeply, can feel the heat creeping into his cheeks and all the way up to his ears.  He can’t take back the words once they have been said, though, and he knows Sherlock will never let the issue go now that he’s been intrigued by it.  “Well,” he starts uneasily, “it’s, er…a bit of a turn on, honestly.”
And Sherlock does.  He takes John’s cock back down, all the way again, trying to go impossibly farther still.  His lips and the tip of his nose brush John’s pubic bone and John feels Sherlock try to relax his throat around him and swallow, choking and trying to breathe around the cock in his mouth for a few more seconds.
Silence settled over the room for a long moment, broken only by the low drone of the tv and the soft noises of newspaper pages turning.  John was almost to the end of periodical—and more than happy to note that there was not even the smallest mention of Sherlock Holmes in conjunction with a piece on the Synathida protests that were still happening in the area—when suddenly Sherlock jumped in his seat across the coffee table from John, sitting up quickly and bringing a hand up to touch his belly.
The blonde man gave him a stern look.  “Sherlock, your chair is perfectly fine,” he prompted, hoping the brunette man would get the hint—he didn’t necessarily want to be the jerk that kicked a pregnant man out of his seat, but he was quickly becoming more and more okay with the idea.
Hey all!  I decided to post early because I'm going on a trip this weekend and wanted to have this up in case I can't find the time to get to a computer while I'm gone.  Beta’d by Indelible_Ink and iriswallpaper.  Check out the end of the chapter for more fanart by Vanimelda4!  Thanks so much!
John beams at him.  “Come on, baby.  Let me help you get cleaned up and dressed.”  He knows that Sherlock can do it on his own, but that’s not the point.  The point is that John wants to take care of Sherlock right now, and Sherlock is letting him.  John doesn’t think he could be any happier than he is in that moment.  They wash up, and John battles his erection the entire time.  It certainly is a turn-on, and a privilege, being allowed to treat Sherlock this way.  Yet John hadn’t been lying when he said that he’d wanted to let Sherlock have something just for him, without worrying about getting John off.  So in the end, John’s resolve had won out, and he willed his erection down.
“Hey, shhh,” John says, and he leans into Sherlock’s body, wrapping a warm, comforting arm over the thin man’s pale shoulders and bringing him close.  “It’s okay.  I want to do this for you.  And if it doesn’t work this time, that’s fine, it’ll be all right.  We’ll just try again later.  We can try as many times as you like, as many times as it takes to make you feel good.”
John, of course, had worried the instant Sherlock had said that he was too unwell to take the case.  Sherlock had to try to convince him that it was only a small flu bug, nothing to get worked up over, but John seemed reluctant to buy his story.
The man does, slightly.  He is breathing raggedly in his anger and worry, but he stares at John for a short moment longer before he sighs and drops his head, falling back down into his seat.  John follows him into his own, and he turns to put a hand on Mike’s knee.  He wants Mike to know just how serious he realises this is.
Cleaned and completely redressed, Sherlock turns moodily towards the desk by the window, sitting down in the chair with a flounce and proceeding to check his website and the blog in silence on John’s pilfered laptop.  He doesn’t hand John any tissues or his clothes, or tell him to clean up, and John knows what that means.  The words don’t have to be spoken for John to know how this is going to go anymore.  Sherlock likes it when Greg comes home and sees John dirty and clearly well-fucked.  So John clenches his arsehole around the plug and keeps his legs away from the upholstery as well as he comfortably can and hopes that Greg won’t be much longer, because he knows he will start staining the furniture soon.
He hums thoughtfully for a moment before turning to the table beside them, where he had placed Sherlock’s plug earlier.  He keeps one hand on Sherlock’s shoulders, still pressing him into the desk, as he gently slides the plug back into the boy’s abused, reddened entrance, scraping up some of the come that has dribbled out of him along the way.
“When did the pain first start?” he asked, but Sherlock couldn’t seem to comprehend the question.  “Sherlock!  Answer me, you wanker.  They say it’s important—they need to know how long the pain has been going on.”
John tries not to be hurt that Sherlock is doing all of this without him, but the job he found at a local clinic is keeping him very busy.  They were short-staffed and had hired John on almost immediately, wanting him to cover extra shifts to make up for their patient-load.  John had agreed because he knew that he and Sherlock would need the money.  However, he didn’t anticipate being too busy for Sherlock.  He can see why Sherlock has taken to wandering London for hours at a time.  John figures it must give him something to do.
“How is that fair?” Sherlock asks, looking confused and petulant.  His sleep-mussed curls and the soft tone of his voice add to his child-like illusion and John is once again amazed at how well Sherlock plays his part in this game of theirs.  “No, that’s not fair at all,” Sherlock answers his own question.  “If Sherlock’s need to follow rules, then so do Daddies.  That’s how it should be.”  He looks quite sure of himself.
He walks purposefully up to the boy in his chair and takes hold of Sherlock’s shoulders, pulls Sherlock up to stand next to him, right in front of him so that they are face to face.  He lifts a hand to trace his thumb along the soft flesh of Sherlock’s bottom lip.  “That sharp mouth of yours.  The way I can’t ever decide what colour your eyes are.  The way your hair curls.  The smell of you.”  John pulls Sherlock to him and breathes in the scent of him at the delicate juncture where his neck meets his shoulder.  “God, the smell of you,” John mumbles into Sherlock’s skin, kissing him softly and feeling Sherlock shiver against him.  “How you feel in my arms, like you were made just for me.  I love the way you make me laugh.  How you’ve brought me back from a sad, empty life where I had nothing and you made me feel again.  I love how you’re brilliant, and sweet, and so needy.  How you’re broken, and lonely, and sad, just like me.  I love how you don’t make me feel alone.  I even love how immature you are.”  John pauses for a moment and reconsiders his words.  “I love it sometimes,” he amends immediately.  And then right after that, “I kind of love it.”
“Fuck, take it again,” he says, pulling Sherlock’s head back down.  There is a slight resistance against his hands, he can feel it, and he drags himself out of his lust-haze enough to notice that Sherlock is still a little winded so he loosens his hold slightly but still can’t help begging, “Suck it again, please, God.”
But he got no such luxury, because John forged ahead, heedless of the tears that he knew his words would bring to both of them.
John licks his lips and forges ahead.  “I, er, just want you to know that I’m not going to replace the wedding ring that you threw out the window,” he says determinedly, watching as Sherlock hears his words and grows still as John speaks.  “If Mary asks me to get another, I’ll tell her no.  I’ll tell her that it is just pointless.  But…” he trails off with a blush, then clears his throat and squares his shoulders because he was a soldier, dammit.  He killed people.  And he won’t be made to feel like a love-struck school boyover this.  “Sherlock, there’s something I want to give you.  Something that I want you to have.”
The smirk is completely gone now and Sherlock stares at John through a blank, expressionless face.  Then a small frowns creases the skin between his thick eyebrows and John can see his eyes flicker ever so slightly over the teacher, as if the boy is looking for something, contemplating something.  Whatever it is, Sherlock seems to find it, because after a moment’s pause he responds.
“You’re a push-over,” Sherlock repeats, as if John is asking because he simply hadn’t heard him correctly.  There is a hint of something akin to manic glee in the boy’s voice when he clarifies, “Here I am, underage and in
with a glass of scotch in one hand and his cane pressed against his twinging leg, surrounded by an oppressive silence.
She gave him a warm, motherly smile and a pat on the cheek to let him know that she would take care of it, and he continued on his way to his bedroom, closing the door with a contented sigh behind him once he was inside.
“It’s nice,” John answered him.  “Coming along very nice indeed.  It will be ready to move in to in a few weeks?” he asked.
John wants to cry.  He wants to yell and scream and tear their flat apart.  He wants to take his gun out of his bedside table and shoot every single fucking lowlife that Sherlock has spent the last five days with.
Sherlock’s smirk only grows, heedless of how he is irritating John.  “That is certainly correct.”  He shrugs his thin shoulders and takes another drag of his cigarette.  “I guess you can say that I’m waiting around school for the same reason that you are.”
John sighed loudly, trying to draw Sherlock’s attention as he stood in the middle of the empty room.  But when that didn’t work out, he simply spoke, voice loud and echoing in the bare room around them.  “Sherlock, what exactly are we doing here?”
“Lube,” he mumbles, not even bothering to pull his mouth away from John’s lips.  The word gets lost in a smear of tongues and teeth.
“Sherlock,” he huffs, slowing his thrusts, “Sherlock, let go of the pillows.  Spread your arse for me.”
“Yes, all right,” John concedes, and his grip tightens around Sherlock’s prick, squeezing just right and pumping firmly, twisting at the head and tightening even more on the way back down, over and over and over again, and the slick slide of it and the heat and the constriction are all so good.  So very, very good.
“Of course, Mrs. Hudson,” they both said in unison, and said landlady gave them a smile and blew them a kiss before turning around and leaving them alone.
“The cuff is far too loose, you know,” he chastised her, when he finally couldn’t take sitting there in silence for another moment. “And you’ve probably contaminated my urine sample by leaving out on the counter without a lid for the past five minutes,” he said, using the arm that had the blood pressure cuff around it to point at the urine sample pointlessly. She knew where the sample was, after all, but he just wanted to prove a point. The cuff slid off of his upper arm to dangle uselessly around his wrist when he moved his arm.
“Do you plan to continue your association with Sherlock Holmes?” Mycroft asks him bluntly, and John can tell that he is a man who is used to getting results—it is obvious he is getting tired of playing games with John even if he tries to look unaffected by it all.  Mycroft glances down at the hand that he is using to clutch the handle of his umbrella, spreading his fingers out as if he is so bored, so seemingly unconcerned with the conversation that he finds his cuticles more interesting than John’s answer.  But John knows differently.  Knows that if Mycroft truly didn’t care—the way Sherlock seems to think he doesn’t—then John wouldn’t be here at all.
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” he whispers into the crown of Sherlock’s head, placing a kiss there which gets lost in the wild tangles.
“Often enough for him to detest me,” is Sherlock’s vague answer.  “Although, to be fair, I think it wouldn’t take much for that to happen, anyways.”  The teen pauses and looks at John for a long moment, a deep stare that feels like it penetrates to John’s very core.  He seems to decide something because when he begins to speak again he looks away from John and his voice is small.
He smiles and there is a strange tightness in his throat, a warmth stinging at the corners of his eyes.  “I know,” he says.  He can’t describe the happiness he feels at knowing that Sherlock still wants him, will still be with him, even after all of the ways that John has cocked things up.  He feels right again, like the world had been tilted the wrong way while Sherlock was gone, but now it is back to normal.  He feels like he has finally found his way home after being lost for days, searching for something that he has found once more.
Sherlock arches, pushing his body farther down on John’s finger.  “Yes,” he says, voice slightly strangled.  “I can.”
Beside him, he felt John shift his weight uncomfortably, and the other man avoided his gaze as well.  “You don’t have to,” John said softly, a small frown forming on his face.  “It was my fault, I—the way I behaved, Sherlock, was inexcusable and awful—”
“John, again,” Sherlock says a few days later as he clambers on top of the man, heedless of the trouble John is already having trying to catch his breath.
“That’s my good boy,” he tells Sherlock as they continue to move together, tiny little sounds of desperation still being pulled out of Sherlock’s throat with each jerk of his hips.  “Shh, Daddy’s here for you.”
If Sherlock knows the truth—which he always does—he doesn’t say anything about it, and John is immensely grateful.
“Please?” Sherlock persists, and John doesn’t think he’s ever seen this particular look on Sherlock’s pale, handsome face—this look of sadness, of anxiety.  It makes him look even younger than he already does.  “It’s just that…I get so lonely sometimes and I have no one to talk to.  No one else understands me the way that you do.”
Sherlock just shakes his head slightly, not denying that he already knows, but not confirming it either.  “I don’t see what you see in me.  Tell me,” he presses.
He gentles the press of their lips in increments, wanting to draw out the ending, and Sherlock tries to follow his lead.  It is somewhat awkward-feeling as they try to match each other’s pace—Sherlock is still pressing too hard while John is trying to show him how to ease up so that the kiss doesn’t end abruptly—but neither one seems to mind too much.
Sherlock groans loudly at the thought of that and John can’t take it anymore, he pulls his fingers out of Sherlock’s mouth and bends down to kiss him.  Sherlock opens up to John immediately and the man can taste himself as he licks Sherlock’s lips, dips his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth.  The combined taste of them together is exquisite.
yes.  So beautiful,” John murmurs as he continues to push himself against Sherlock, and the brunet man blushes silently beneath him, somewhat embarrassed by his own body’s betrayal.  John can feel his thrusts become erratic against the other man, and Sherlock tilts his head up to catch John’s mouth with his own, knowing that the blond man is close.
John usually took care of all of the shopping—as well as the cleaning and the other domestic things—and Sherlock had not been aware that milk came in so many forms.  The few times he had promised John he would pick up any groceries it was always something simple like beans or a roll of toilet paper.  But this was something else entirely.
As he watched John and Callum, and listened to all the noises that the two made in the silence of his room, he thought of that night at the pool when he had met Moriarty for the first (true) time.  When the man had threatened to burn Sherlock’s heart right out of him.  Sherlock had responded by saying that he had been reliably informed that he did not have one, and Moriarty had effectively proven that that was, indeed, not true.
Without a second thought, his hand comes down to spank Sherlock again, smacking him right on the fleshy part of his arse, on top of the previously reddened skin.  Sherlock cries out and bucks underneath him, unable to stop the movement.
“You can just leave me at the coffee shop where we ran into one another the other night.  I’ll wait out the storm there.”
Below him Sherlock bucks his hips up into nothing.  John is straddling his chest and Sherlock’s arms are trapped above John’s thighs so there is not even the hope of friction anywhere near Sherlock’s cock.
John usually waited until Sherlock was home before making the tea, and he never had biscuits in the middle of the afternoon, since he often took a late lunch from his job.
He lounged back on the pillow-top mattress and pushed back against the plush feather pillows, sighing heavily.  “I could get used to this,” he said sleepily, feeling the day’s stresses start to slip away, even if only slightly.
“Well,” he said carefully, “you have gotten…bigger, Sherlock. You don’t look like your just fat, now. You look…pregnant.”
That wasn’t what Sherlock wanted to hear.  That wasn’t what John was supposed to say.  John was supposed to tell him that he was wrong—about Lestrade, about wanting to give up, about wanting to leave.  John was supposed to hold him up, be his rock, be the unfaltering hand that Sherlock leaned on.
“John,” Sherlock choked out, his body suddenly on fire from the other man’s touches. He had to have more, he had to have John, had to be filled…
“You know we always make it up to you, Greg,” John says as he, too, stands and moves to cover Greg from the other side.  When he reaches him, he stands on the tips of his toes to press up against Greg’s back as much as he can and stretches to press a kiss to the back of his husband’s neck, boxing the older man in between the two of them.
She grabbed at the two men; standing on the tips of her toes and reaching up to hook both arms around each of their necks. “Oh, dearies! I knew you would end up with a family of your own one day!” she said happily, giving each of them a kiss on their cheeks. “I knew it the moment John moved in with you, Sherlock. You both said you were just flatmates, but I knew better!” She released them with a laugh, her eyes shiny with tears as she took a step back and looked at them. “Parents, can you believe it?” she said to no one in particular.
Sherlock’s mouth drops open to pant heavily but he nods his head, agreeing, and John squeezes a third finger into his hole, lube dribbling out as it is pressed up against the tightness of Sherlock’s body.
, John,” Sherlock says angrily, throwing off his long overcoat and flinging it onto the sofa in a huff that belies his words.  “As if I care what those imbeciles think, anyways.”
,” Sherlock whimpers and a small, coherent part of John’s brain registers the fact that Sherlock’s voice sounds slightly frightened.
“How do you want it, baby?” he asks as he moves his hips forward slightly, rocking them back and forth in their new position.
“You’re not that old, John.  I’m surprised you would need it,” Mike argues, still not catching on.  “Also—if you don’t mind me saying so—I’m surprised that you’re having sex with Mary constantly enough to use it.  I thought you guys weren’t…” he pauses and makes an awkward motion with his hand that John isn’t sure he knows the meaning of.  “You know,” Mike finishes uncomfortably, making a face.
“I just wanted to tell you—I mean, I thought that you should know,” Lestrade stammered, and then he seemed to find the words that he wanted, and he surged ahead, a little more confident now.  “He’s been a mess, lately.  Over the whole situation, and not just about what happened yesterday.  He’s been scared out of his mind and worried about you and the baby.”
John closes his eyes and shakes his head, wishing he could un-hear everything that Sherlock has told him.  It makes his heart ache.  “Sherlock, please,” he pleads, and his voice is nothing more than a whisper.  “Just let me walk away from this.  I’m begging you.”
“I’m glad you’re finally seeing things my way,” John tells him as he pushes Sherlock’s face back down onto his crotch.  Sherlock braces himself for the onslaught once again, knowing that John will be just as forceful as he has been.  Because Sherlock wants this, after all.
“So?” Sherlock sniffs derisively as he wipes himself off with John’s discarded jumper.  “I didn’t hear you voicing any concern while I was giving them to you.”
John’s arms tighten around Sherlock, pulling him closer.  “I love you, too, baby,” he says, dragging his lips across Sherlock’s mouth and down his neck, tasting every piece of collarbone and clavicle that he had wanted to earlier.  Sherlock moans and arches up against his mouth, and John can feel the rumble of his deep voice as he presses his lips against Sherlock’s chest.  He gently pushes the brunet back, down onto the floor, and moves over him.  Sherlock’s arms come up to wrap around his neck and his warm thighs part to cradle John’s body.  They fit so perfectly together, sinking into one another.  John sighs into his mouth.
That is all it takes for a low growl to escape John’s throat.  Struggling up from his seat, he yanks his hand out of Sherlock’s grasp and pulls Sherlock closer to him, up to his feet and out of his seat.  Standing as well, John quickly wastes no time in pushing Sherlock against the edge of the table, kissing him fiercely and licking the mess off of his mouth.  Sherlock lets out a small, strangled yelp as John shoves him roughly against the edge of the table.  When his lips open up to the brutal kiss, John slips his tongue inside, tasting sugary sweetness, and Sherlock’s yelp turns slowly into a moan.
“I told you to leave off!”  John shouts out at him, throwing another punch.  This one connects with Bill’s chin in a satisfying
“It’s not the end of the world, you know,” John assures him conversationally.  “You won’t die from not getting off one more time.”
the jerk?”  He stared at John blankly for a moment, as if truly not comprehending the man’s words and John began to feel distinctly uncomfortable, as if he may have been a little too harsh with Greg.  After all, the detective inspector had never been anything but supporting and understanding towards John, especially these past few months, when the doctor felt he had needed it the most.
John hums in agreement and rubs his hand in a slow circle over the pinkening flesh of Sherlock’s cheek.  “Good boy,” he says warmly, and Sherlock squirms in his lap.
The third spin off in the daddy kink series will be posted in the upcoming days, though the timeline for that fic doesn’t necessarily fit in with the timeline for TBL.
“It’s not so bad, this,” Sherlock said lowly to John some time later, as the blonde man came back carrying a plate heaping with small sandwiches and other finger foods, which he and Sherlock began to pick off of.
A/N: Another great big thank you to my betas, Jenamy and Haelia!  And thank you to the people who have taken the time to comment or leave kudos—seeing that makes my heart happy!  I want to warn you in advance, I'm new to AO3 and slightly computer illiterate, so adding chapters and all of this lark is throwing me for a loop.  I'm especially confused by the option for beginning and ending chapter notes, so if something is off I'm sorry...
“Where do you need me to drop you?” John asks suddenly, because he is afraid that if Sherlock asks him anything else he won’t be able to stay quiet again and this has been embarrassing enough as it is.
John has just enough time to nod his head vigorously and say, “Yeah, baby, come one,” before Sherlock is arching his back, pushing roughly into John’s hand as he shouts out and comes across John’s belly and chest
he did.  He had seen them.  Small squares of sterile alcohol pads and strips of gauze fall out over the sides as John continues to dig through his kit, almost frantically now, before he finally sees them, down at the very bottom.
But John was unwilling to believe so.  “Mycroft?” he asked incredulously, and Sherlock could understand why.  “He’s going to let us stay with him?”  ‘
Both men laugh perversely at that and then trail off uncomfortably.  They may make jokes about it, but the pain is very real, and they can’t forget that.
As soon as the question hit the air, John’s face went blank with incredulity.  “Sherlock, what the hell has gotten in to you?” he asked, dumbfounded.
He grabs up several boxes from the store that he keeps for Sherlock—the teen is prone to all sorts of injuries and maladies, and John knew that he would need to keep a well-stocked kit around the mad genius when they began living together.  The plasters are all themed, meant to make his lovebug smile and giggle as John applies them—anything to make his little honeybee feel better.  There are dinosaur printed ones, and some with tiny little spaceships and aliens on them.  There are even Army-green camouflaged ones that Sherlock picked out himself on a rare trip to the shops with John once, because they reminded him of his Daddy.  And, of course, there is the dwindling supply of pirate-themed plasters that John will have to restock soon.
When Sherlock had first shown him the old, dusty books and John had asked about them, Sherlock had said that he vaguely remembered a mother whose face he couldn’t quite picture reading them to him.  Mostly, though, he said that he just remembered reading them to himself at night, as he lay in his bed after tucking himself in, no one coming to kiss him goodnight.
“Let me have that cupcake in the display.  The chocolate one,” John says, leaning his cane against the counter and pulling out his wallet.
“Oh, that,” Lestrade answered, raising a hand to scratch the back of his head embarrassedly. “Yeah. Well, we caught a missing person’s case. Teenage girl, history of drug abuse, father recently remarried. We had the dogs after her, but they lost the trail here.” He shuffled through the notes he had taken for the case in his small notepad. “It’s a local hang out for other secondary school kids, so there are lots of footprints and tire tracks. It’s a huge mess; I don’t even know where to have my team begin.”
Above him, Sherlock grits his teeth and winces, sucking in a sharp breath, but it doesn’t seem much different from some of the other times that they have fucked.  His prick is still stiff and jutting upwards between them, so John pushes forward a little more and feels as Sherlock let himself sink down onto John’s length.  The tight rim of Sherlock’s hole pops past the crown of his cock and John gives the boy a minute to adjust to the widest part of him, past the head.  It is always Sherlock’s favourite part of being penetrated, when John’s cock stretches him as far as it can before Sherlock swallows the rest of John easily, sinking onto him slickly with the help of the lube.
“Yeah,” Lestrade agreed, not liking this conversation any more than John was, it seemed. “Right, well, I’ll just fill you in on what you’ve missed, then.”
God, he didn’t even know what he was thinking.  His mind raced and would not settle on a single thought.  He couldn’t even grasp onto the words that he wanted to say right now, because they were suddenly pushed to the side as more thoughts and feelings tumbled down upon him.
John followed Sherlock’s gaze and scanned the room skeptically.  He took in the bare walls that were up, covering up the studs beneath them, and the shiny, polished hardwood floor on which they stood, inhaling the scent of fresh cut wood and new paint deeply.
When John wakes up in the morning it is to an empty bed.  The spot Sherlock occupied last night is cold now, and John wonders for a moment if he had imagined it all.  But the evidence of it still clings somewhat to his hand and his groin, letting him know it was real.
“That is one of the sexiest things I’ve ever seen in my life,” John tells him with a salacious grin.
“Really, John?” Mike asks him, voice gone calm and soft.  “Or are you just telling yourself that to justify what you’re doing to this boy?”
As much as Sherlock tries to hide it, John knows that the thought of being left by someone else in his life hurts Sherlock deeply.
“There we are,” John says soothingly, rubbing his hands gently across Sherlock’s tender bum before helping him to stand.  “All done now.”
He had grinned at the deep red blush that had stained Sherlock’s cheeks at his words as he stopped to give Sherlock a little kiss on his way to the kitchen.
John tries to ignore the smirk that he sees playing at the corner of Sherlock’s lips as he tears into the box and slaps a patch on the smooth, pale skin of his arm.  “It might air out by Sunday night,” Sherlock says simply, unconcerned.
“When we play?” Sherlock asks, thinking that John forgot to add that on to the end of his statement.
But once he did, he let out a great sigh of relief.  There, inside the blackened strongbox, was all of his paperwork and notebooks from his pregnancy, untouched by the fire and looking as pristine and new as the day that Sherlock had put them in there for the first time.  He searched around in the safe for a bit more, digging through it.  John’s bullets were in there, as well, and the other two guns were still securely hidden about their persons.  The most important paperwork that they had—John’s honorable discharge certificate, their birth certificates, their notarized living wills, stating each other as power of medical attorney should something dire happen to either one of them, among a few other things—was all there, not a wrinkle, not a tear, not a burn on them.
“John, please,” he says, because he needs.  He doesn’t know exactly what it is that he needs, but he knows that John can give it to him, whatever it is.
If Mycroft seems taken aback by John’s sudden question, he doesn’t show it.  But the Holmes brothers are very good at hiding their emotions, John has come to learn, and Mycroft’s words belie his aloof, blasé appearance.  “I worry about him,” Mycroft says carefully, voice tight and clipped as if he is walking over land mines.  “Constantly.”  His eyes never leave John’s, as if challenging the ex-soldier to claim that his words are untrue.
Part of him feels more than a little foolish: he is 35 years old and sexting dirty pictures of his privates for the first time in his life, to someone who is not his wife.  He would never in a million years consider doing this with Mary.  In fact, she had tried a few years back and he had been so uncomfortable with the idea that he had made her stop.
He thought he had hurt before, when he had been cheated on by his wife, when he had been shot, when he had been discharged from the Army, when he had given up his career as a surgeon, when he had hurt Sherlock’s feelings.  But this…this
“John,” Sherlock sighs, closing his eyes and biting his bottom lip, and John can tell he is already close.
“What could you possibly do, John,” Sherlock continues, voice cracking and finally, finally, as all the anger seems to leave Sherlock and only the hurt and the pain seems to remain, John can get close to him, can reach out for him.  “What could you possibly do that could hurt me more than knowing that she kissed you, and you just
As he watches, Sherlock’s digits slide over John’s, sometimes not able to find purchase, slimy as they are with come.  But as they move, John feels Sherlock caress his wedding ring every time his fingers slide over it, covering it in John’s ejaculate.  John’s breath catches in his throat and he can’t tear his eyes away from the debased sight in front of him.
Sherlock moans wantonly and nods his head, eyes still closed tightly shut as if in shame.  He brings a large, pale hand down to himself, gripping the base of his hard cock to steady it while he reaches his other hand over to run his fingertips up along the shaft and then to circle the head.  He pulls his foreskin forward and then pushes it back down in small, teasing half-strokes, spreading the wetness he finds there around the crown and then slowly farther down his shaft, slicking himself up naturally.  Sherlock groans at the feeling and so does John, and the two sounds mix together as one.
He can feel one of Sherlock’s hands leaving his hips, trailing down along his leg and sliding under to grab his prick, hanging thick and swollen between his thighs, an angry almost-purple color from being neglected for so long.  He grips just a little too tightly, and John gasps in pain, and it is glorious.  Sherlock doesn’t pump him at all except once in the beginning, dragging his palm across the fat head of John’s cock so that he can smear his hand with John’s precome.  After that Sherlock just grabs John’s cock around the shaft and
“Lick my fingers,” he commands Sherlock, shifting his body so that he can lean over Sherlock’s back and reach the detective’s mouth with one hand while the other continues to play with his dry hole, not pushing in, simply getting it used to the feel of his fingers.  Sherlock strains his neck to reach the digits John is presenting him, and he sucks them into his mouth hungrily, positively soaking them because he knows where they will end up soon.
underneath it all that John has missed over the years he has been married to his wife.  His mouth almost waters as he remembers what it feels like to have a cock against his tongue, and he lets out a little moan when he realises that he isn’t about to suck just anyone’s cock—he is going to suck
,” Sherlock breathes, eyes going wide in surprise.  He pulls away from John at that, far enough that he can look at the man’s face.  John lets him go, trying not to blush even more at Sherlock’s scrutiny.  He can see the boy doing that thing again—that thing where he reads John’s body and emotions like a book, where he finds answers in the silence of the other man and susses out John’s secret desires, hidden intentions.
John heaves a frustrated sigh, not wanting to deal with this right now.  It’s getting later and his text tone goes off in his pocket, a tiny warning.  “Do you want to know how I feel?  I
John doesn’t understand it; he doesn’t understand how they go from arguing with each other, almost ending things, tearing each other’s throats out…to this.  His cock presses between the plump flesh of Sherlock’s arse, still trapped behind a layer of clothing, and they both gasp, mindless with want.
He supports Sherlock’s weight as they limp into the A&E.  He carefully wraps a hand under Sherlock’s armpit so that the boy can throw his own lanky arm over John’s shoulders and put his weight on the older man.  As they hobble into the building John looks over at his student worryingly.  Sherlock’s face is so close to his own in their current position and for the first time John gets a good look at Sherlock’s injuries under glaringly bright lights.
In his defense, it had seemed to happen overnight. Yesterday he had managed to squeeze into his loosest fitting trousers and today…today he felt the hot prickle of tears forming in the corners of his eyes as he pulled vainly at the two ends of fabric in his hands, trying futilely to make them meet over his distended abdomen.
“Listen to me, Sherlock,” John said, wrapping his arms tightly around the other man and holding him close in the darkness.  “You are so brave, and so strong, and so amazing.  I would never, not in a million years, have the courage to do what you’re doing.”
He sinks into the wet warmth of Sherlock’s mouth and shudders, not able to stop the small thrusting movements of his hips.  He can feel his cock pulse and grow against Sherlock’s tongue as the boy rubs it slickly against the underside of John’s prick.  John gasps at the amazing sensation and pulls out slightly too far, afraid that he will come already.  The head of his cock slips out of Sherlock’s mouth and slides along his lips slickly, catching in one corner and pressing against Sherlock’s cheek.  John can feel himself pulse against Sherlock’s soft skin as a swell of precome springs forth.  The head of his cock slips along the slickness, spreading it and mixing saliva as well.  Sherlock’s tongue darts out to follow John’s cock and the man curses, grabbing himself once again and placing his prick back in Sherlock’s mouth.
“Yes,” John whispers against his lips, more a sound of surrender than anything else, and sweeps his tongue out to lick Sherlock’s mouth again.  Sherlock tastes sweet and feels so soft.  Young and naïve and so willing underneath John.  Completely and perfectly lovely.  John thinks that he will never be able to let him go.
“That sharp tongue of yours is good for more than just snarky comments and brilliant deductions,” John says vaguely but he knows that Sherlock understands just what he means, just what he wants.
Later that night, he helps Sherlock gather all of his belongings before Mary is due back from her late flight, picking up any trace that Sherlock was ever in the house and making sure nothing is left of him in John’s home.  They don’t speak to one another; they can barely look at each other because they know that it will just hurt too much.  John doesn’t want him to go, but Mary is due back at any moment, her plane having landed some time ago.  Waiting for her luggage and the cab ride home will buy them a little time, but not much, he knows.
John stares at him, confused for a moment.  Because the way it sounds, one would think that Sherlock
“John, God, John,” Sherlock cries, throwing his head back so hard that it thumps loudly against the wall.
“Well, we won’t be able to tell for certain until we can do a sonogram and take some measurements, but from the information you gave regarding your sexual activity at your last prenatal exam, it seems….”  Sherlock heard the soft rustle of papers on the other end of the line as Dr. Greenwhich went back through his file.  “About 5 weeks, judging by the date you gave us for your last day of ovulation.”
“What a coincidence!  I just started work here at Speedy’s part time,” the young blond says, his smile widening.  “Well, now that I know you live right next door, maybe we can get together to study.  You know, since you seem to be doing so well with the chemistry lessons and all—” he teases, and John is shocked to see a deep flush rise up on Sherlock’s cheeks, painting them a pretty pink colour that is too attractive for the brunet’s own good.
He makes sure that the second hit is slightly harder, and that it doesn’t fall on the same spot as the previous one.  He is sure it doesn’t sting too badly, though.  Sherlock is wearing his trousers, after all, but John still doesn’t want this to actually hurt him.  This is more like an exercise in obedience, really.
“I happen to like them,” John chuckles as he lets Sherlock wrestle with his clothing for a moment before deciding that if he doesn’t step in, he’ll likely be down one shirt.
Beside him Sherlock seems oblivious to John’s attention.  He has thrown his head back and closed his eyes as John sucks along his long neck.  His fingers clutch at John’s clothing in any accessible place, gripping tightly and tugging to gain leverage as Sherlock tries to thrust his hips against John’s body, but John gently stops him with a soft pressure to his boney hip.
Sherlock winces at the enthusiasm in John’s voice, because he knows it will only lead to a bigger disappointment, but he doesn’t lie to him.  He can’t.  “I can achieve orgasm every so often by myself,” he confesses, “so I know that my body is capable of doing it, but it requires a tremendous amount of time and effort.”  He hopes that his words are enough to break John’s delusions.
“Come on,” he says, giving Sherlock one more kiss and then dropping his hands so that he can begin to straighten Sherlock’s clothes.  “I’ll take you back to Mike’s class.  I’ll make up some excuse for why I dragged you away like that.”
“John,” he hears Sherlock say from the head of the bed, but John ignores him.  He is too wrapped up in this, his senses overloaded with Sherlock, his mouth full of him.
A very special thanks to iriswallpaper for the beta, and as always, thanks to Indelible_Ink for the Brit-pick!
Taken aback by John’s sudden response, Lestrade held his empty hands up in submission.  “Okay, okay, sorry mate….You know I don’t mean anything by it.  It’s just a nickname everyone—”
God, would he ever stop vomiting?  Between all of the fluids he had lost due to the Synathida and now the early stages of pregnancy, he was surprised he had not dehydrated yet and turned to a pile of dust as he lay on the bathroom floor, hugging the toilet bowl.  The website said that his appendix had doubled in size during the past five weeks.  His eating habits, never very good to begin with, were now nonexistent, thanks to the
“I told you where I was going,” he states, tone softening a bit.  He knows she must be concerned, and he doesn’t want to be the bad guy anymore.  Just because they will soon be divorced doesn’t mean she can’t still be worried for him.  “I’m in London now.”  He doesn’t say who he is with, but he figures she most likely knows.  The more days that have passed, the more he feels safe here with Sherlock.  If Mary had called the proper authorities by now, John feels safe in the knowledge that Mycroft has kept true to his word.  No one has tried to find them here in London, yet.  He dares to feel hopeful.
“John.  Please tell me that it’s not true,” he pleads as he turns to look at the blond man, and John can’t remember a time that his friend has looked so devastated.  “Tell me that I’m going crazy.”
John sighs, using an alcohol pad to wipe away blood from Sherlock’s palm, allowing him to finally see the cut.  It is deep, but not as bad as he feared.  “Sherlock, I’ve told you before not to play with the scalpels when we scene, haven’t I?” he asks into the silence as he continues to go about cleaning the cut.
In that moment, watching his adult lover hug a ridiculously-smiling bee soft toy, John has the strongest feelings of protectiveness and possessiveness he thinks he has ever felt for Sherlock, outside of jealousy.  Even stronger than the very first time that he had seen Sherlock beaten bloody by his alcoholic father and John had taken him to hospital, back before they had become romantically involved with each other.  Back when Sherlock was still just his student and John was just his teacher, and Sherlock was running to him for help from his abusive drunk of a father.  What he feels now, though, is even stronger than that; it is a deep-seated desire to protect Sherlock from everything and anything, because Sherlock is his now, whereas he wasn’t before.  Sherlock trusts John, and he looks to John for care and guidance now.
“But he’s completely insatiable, Mike,” John continues hurriedly, covering up the awkward hitch in the conversation.  “We haven’t even gone all the way and I can’t keep up with him.”  He shakes his head and runs a hand through his hair, taking a drink of his beer.  “I can’t remember being that age, but if I was half as horny as he is all the time it’s a wonder I was able to even graduate uni!”
“John, I’m not going to do that!” Sherlock cries out as the man starts to drive away from the kerb.  “Please, don’t take me there.  I don’t want to go.”  He sounds almost as if he is about to cry, and it breaks John’s heart to hear his voice crack that way.
The reminder that this rule is only while they play seems to placate the growing anxiety in Sherlock somewhat.  He doesn’t complain anymore and he writes down the rule with minimal grumbling and a soft, “Yes, sir,” said to his Daddy.
“Good,” John responds with a nod of his head.  He doesn’t quite know where to go from here, because he suddenly wants very badly to kiss Sherlock.  “Very good.”
Sherlock’s mouth opens diligently to John’s tongue, and John moans at the taste of the marmalade that Sherlock had licked off of him earlier which still lingers on his lips.
“Alohicious?” John repeated, surprised at Sherlock’s taste in children’s names.  He knew that ‘Mycroft’ and ‘Sherlock’ were not nearly as common as they had been in the 1800’s maybe, but there was a limit to the embarrassment that he would make his son suffer through in the poor child’s lifetime.  “I don’t want to name him anything that rhymes with ‘delicious’.”
, Mike.  I’ve tried so hard to make it work with her.”  He shakes his head and shrugs, a helpless little gesture of surrender.  “She refuses to meet me halfway.  She gave up on our marriage a long time ago.  I know that.  I was just too stubborn and scared to see it.”
He wonders if he should look any different, if other people will be able to tell just by gazing at his face that he has spent the past day cheating on his wife and fucking his student in their bed.  The face in the mirror frowns at him and he suddenly doesn’t like what he sees very much, so he turns away and heads for the door.
Sherlock doesn’t respond and John can only hope that the loon hasn’t been suspended by the time he gets back.
He couldn’t believe it.  The odds of this little picture surviving when nothing else had were astronomical.  Improbable.  Unpredictable.
“I know, John,” Lestrade cut him off. “God, I’m such a prat, for throwing this at you, too. I just wanted you to know that I’m here for you, John, even if Sherlock isn’t. And I’d be willing to give you everything that he isn’t. Because you deserve it John. And you don’t deserve what he’s doing to you. I’ve always thought that.”
John pauses in his ministrations and stares at the boy standing next to him.  Sherlock is almost the same height as him, tall for his age, but there is still a lot of time for him to grow.  His strange eyes shine brightly in the darkness of the street.  John doesn’t exactly know how to answer him so the blond says simply, “Because you need it, Sherlock.”
“No, none of that,” John tells him, voice stern.  “You have to learn to take all of it.  Come on, I know you can.  You want to be good for me, don’t you?  Try it again.”
“Sad?  Depraved?  Twisted?” Sherlock offers up.  “Yes, possibly.”  He doesn’t seem to be bothered by that fact at all.  “I’ve told you before, John—I’m not a nice person.  I keep telling you, and I keep doing these things that should show you that I’m not a good person.  And you see it, for a little while.  You get angry at me, and you yell at me, and you tell me that I’m wrong and that I’m not good for you.  But then you forgive me.  You always forgive me.  Why are you always forgiving me?” he asks, voice frustrated and angry and sharp.
Sherlock gasps out a strangled moan as he sinks slowly down John’s cock in increments.  The angle is different from what they are used to, deeper; the weight of Sherlock’s body is behind it, and the teen goes slowly, so slowly, as if he is afraid of the pleasure he is feeling.  His hair is plastered to his forehead with sweat, his cheeks are flushed a blotchy red and his eyes are completely glazed over—John doesn’t think he has ever seen Sherlock look as gorgeous as he does when he is sitting on John’s cock.
“This is no good,” he said, loudly, not looking at Lestrade or Donovan but instead staring at the dead woman.
“Sorry, mate,” John says off-handedly and the person looks up at him.  He is surprised to see that it’s the Holmes boy.
“I’m not going anywhere, Sherlock,” John tells him, because he feels like it has to be said again, like Sherlock needs to hear it over and over and over again or else he’ll forget.  “I’m not going to end up choosing her.  I’ve already made my choice.  We just have to wait a little while longer, love, for you to finish your A-Levels.  But you don’t have to worry about me leaving you.  I could never do that.  I could never have this with someone else.  I love you.  You saved me, Sherlock,” John tells him again, hugging him tighter.  “You don’t even know how you’ve saved me.”
Before he knows it, John feels Mary grabbing his arm and pulling him out of Mike’s house.  The four of them pile into Mike’s car (he thinks he hears Mary say something about him being distracted so it would probably be best if someone else drives) and he sits and fumes in the back seat as the other three chatter on happily about silly, inane things that he could care less about.
He is almost incoherent in his need and desperation, and John can’t help the groan that tears its way out of his throat.  He loves Sherlock like this, he loves being the one to make Sherlock like this, and John can’t deny such a tempting request.
Sherlock hums happily and wiggles his bum against John’s groin contentedly.  John reaches across Sherlock once more to turn off the bedside lamp and the room is thrown into a sudden semi-darkness.  A faint glow filters in through the window from where Sherlock forgot to close the drapes, but John doesn’t mind; he can see Sherlock’s face like this and he thinks that he might enjoy watching the boy sleep for a while.
friend—who won’t mind taking him in for a little while.  Just while his father stumbles through this particular binge.  “Don’t worry about me.  I have somewhere I can go.”  He tries to reassure John with a small smile, but it seems to hurt him to move his lips that way so he stops.
Sherlock beams and nods his head emphatically and John can practically see the teen’s years slipping away from him, leaving the vestiges of a particular kind of immaturity behind that is both endearing and disturbingly arousing to watch.
Sherlock had stayed quiet the entire way home after they had left the doctor’s office.  Quiet in the cab coming home and pliant as John had walked him up the stairs and set him in the chair, not speaking, barely even blinking.
John shakes his head.  He doesn’t want to talk about this right now.  He can barely think straight; Sherlock is driving him mad.  “It’s not the name that turns me on,” he says, lifting his head and taking Sherlock’s mouth in a kiss.  “It’s you.  God, it’s you.”
Sherlock makes the most beautiful, broken, inhuman sound as he comes apart in John’s arms, and the man just cradles him tighter, holding Sherlock like he is the most precious thing in the world.  John fucks him gently through his orgasm, careful not to overstimulate him, right on the razor’s edge himself.  It isn’t until Sherlock’s orgasm ends and he whimpers and turns his face to hide in the crook of John’s neck that the man tips over uncontrollably, the pull of his orgasm too hard to keep at bay for a second longer.  He groans against Sherlock’s hair and buries himself deep, feeling Sherlock gasp against his shoulder as John settles into his body and they both feel him come.
Sherlock looks at him with large, strikingly clear blue eyes.  When John brings a hand up to gently apply pressure to the bones in his face to check for fractures, Sherlock nuzzles into his hand, closing his eyes.  The tips of his eyelashes are wet and have clumped together.  “I’m sorry, Daddy,” he whispers into John’s palm.
Sherlock simply continues to smile at him, though, not a single speck of judgment in his green-blue eyes.  “It’s fine,” Sherlock assures him happily.  “You can call me anything you want, as long as it means that I’m yours.  I don’t mind any of it.”
He turns Sherlock harshly around to face the wall suddenly, without warning.  John shoves him into the unyielding barrier and puts one hand on the back of Sherlock’s head.  He presses the side of Sherlock’s face into the wall, dropping his other hand to wank the teen roughly.  Sherlock’s cock is completely hard and practically dripping from the slit and John’s prick gives a sympathetic twitch in his trousers as he rubs himself in between Sherlock’s plush arse cheeks, pressing him harder into the wall.
The next one is harder.  He draws a blank for a long moment and he honestly thinks that there isn’t anything else to put down on the list of rules for him to follow.  Then he remembers something.  The memory comes shooting across his brain like a bolt of lightning, vivid in its intensity and pain.  He puts his hand back down to the paper and is proud that it shakes only slightly.
“Not all of them,” Sherlock says, voice small.  His face is still hidden against John’s neck and John can feel Sherlock’s warm breath on the sensitive skin below his ear.  He hugs the boy tighter to him.  “I wasn’t lying when I told you that the kids from school like to bully me.  I’ve never lied to you, John.”  He sounds adamant that John realise this.
The next hit is the same, on Sherlock’s other arse cheek, for balance.  John wants to be sure that the sensitive skin is somewhat ready for harsher hits, so he spanks Sherlock slightly harder on each cheek once more as Sherlock asks for each one before smacking him soundly on the fleshy round part of his arse.  The hit is so hard that it stings John’s hand and makes Sherlock gasp, his hands clenching in the sheets as he says the word, “Five,” on a sharp inhaled breath.  “Another, please, Daddy,” he begs, wiggling his bum, and John holds in a dark chuckle.
John continues pacing, stabbing the end of his cane into the plush carpet harshly, but he glares at her now, wanting to have her look him in the eye when she lies to him.  He won’t make this easy for her.  “We changed your mobile number, Mary,” he reminds her calmly, sounding far more collected than he feels.  “You gave it to him again.  How else would he have it?”
He and John met Lestrade and his team in a back alleyway a few blocks from the University of London, in an area that was known for their bars and clubs.  They made their way over to Lestrade, who was intent on examining the young woman who was lying face down on the ground before him, and pointedly ignoring Sherlock.
“You shouldn’t laugh at crime scenes, Lestrade,” he said, and it was only because John had known him for so long that he could detect the hint of jealousy in the man’s deep baritone voice.  “It’s highly inappropriate, don’t you think?”
“Sherlock, you can’t—” John tries again, but he suddenly realises that he has no words for how incredibly stupid the kid is being.  “It’s not—”
John doesn’t exactly know what it is that Sherlock is asking for, but it doesn’t really matter; he’ll give him whatever it is.  Anything, everything.  It all belongs to Sherlock now.
John waits for a moment before he begins thrusting into Sherlock.  He doesn’t even withdraw completely, he just moves inside of him, short shallow snaps of his hips because he can’t bear to leave the wet heat and tight comfort of Sherlock’s body for even a moment.  Every thrust, every drag of skin on skin is like fire and white hot pleasure shooting through John.  As they move together, Sherlock rolling his hips, John can’t believe that he has kept himself from wanting to have this for the rest of his life.  He can’t believe he has pushed Sherlock away so many times, kept him at bay, and not given in to his desires to be with Sherlock completely.  At the thought, John bites his bottom lip and thrusts harder, his shoulders and his back and his hips all flexing as he pushes harshly into Sherlock’s body, filling him up so completely that he knows Sherlock will never be able to remove or forget him, or ever leave him behind.
John watches him the entire time but suddenly has to shut his eyes against the image that the dark-haired boy in front of him creates.  He wonders if Sherlock knows just how arousing he is, if he knows just how crazy he drives John.  The older man’s stomach clenches as he feels Sherlock’s wet tongue suckle at his fingertips and John knows that if he doesn’t make Sherlock stop soon things are quickly going to get out of hand.
He saw John reach a hand over to the cart that he had grabbed the baby out of, still half asleep, as if it was nothing more than habit, and when the blonde man’s hand touched nothing in the hospital-issue crib, Sherlock saw John snap awake, alert in an instant.  He eyes automatically went to Sherlock, sitting up in the bed holding their son, and a glorious smile split his face, so deep and wide that the small dimples he had by the corners of his lips appeared.
want, Sherlock?” John asks him gently, carding his fingers through Sherlock’s curls.  “Tell me.  You want to move to London and you want to go to university here, and you want to live at Baker Street, and you want to become some sort of private detective and keep bees—”
“Oh, John,” Mike says, his voice dropping low and his face crumbling into a look of sorrow.  He shakes his head, as if he is trying to un-hear the words that John has just spoken.  “No,” he denies, not wanting to believe it.  “Come on, mate, you’re better than that!  I never thought you would cheat—not after you know how much it hurts.”
“Do you love Daddy, Sherlock?” he asks from his spot across the room, because he just has to hear it again.
“Sherlock, I won’t force you to eat all of your food every day, but I’m not going to sit by and let you fill your body with junk.  If you want sweets, you are going to have to eat something nutritious first, even if it is just a little bit.”  His voice and his eyes soften as he looks down at Sherlock.  “I’m not asking a lot from you, love.”
Is it just to put another notch in his bedpost, John wonders.  Just for the thrill of saying that he got to sleep with his teacher, with someone over twice his age?  Is it just to see John jump through hoops for Sherlock and destroy his whole life for the teen?  Is Sherlock really that cruel?  Cruel enough that he would take John’s heart in his hand and crush it to dust while he watches John throw away a marriage, a job, a chance at a decent life, all for Sherlock?
“If any of you take one more step closer, I swear to God that I will blow each and every one of your fucking heads off, so I suggest that you
John frowns.  He doesn’t really like the reminder of Sherlock’s youth, but he supposes he walked right into that one.  “You know what I mean.”
John makes it to the end of the class without incident, and thinks that Mike must have just been taking the piss—trying to make him nervous about his first day teaching.  He is able to spot the Holmes boy right away, not even needing to take attendance to know which student he is.  As soon as the student walks in, he takes a seat as far away from all of the other kids as possible and huddles into himself.  Even if it weren’t for the anti-social behaviour, John can tell just from looking at the thin brunet boy that there is something that sets him apart from the rest of his peers, something
Sherlock tilts his head to watch John from his position, upside down.  He doesn’t move otherwise, though a small frown creases his young face.  “Now you’ve made Dr. Barium jealous,” he states rather ominously.
At A&E, the doctor had told Sherlock to take some time off from school until the worst of the bruising and swelling went down.  John knows that the brunet was more than happy with that.  But without being able to see Sherlock every day, John finds that he only thinks about the boy more.
He knows it isn’t really a medical conference that she is going to.  He has always been able to tell when she is lying to him, and he knows that she’s lying now; it’s obvious (as Sherlock would put it).  Normally at this moment in their conversation he would accuse her of lying and cheating and start an epic row.  Now, though, he finds himself actually trying to contain a happy smile as she lies through her teeth about how busy they are going to be at the conference, so if he rings her she probably won’t be able to answer.
John tries not to think about how unsettling that thought is.  “What if Mary decides she wants to have sex with me again?” he asks, wanting to be sure that Sherlock is aware of everything that could happen in this situation.  “I won’t exactly be able to say no to her without it looking suspicious—she’s still my wife.”
“I love you, and I want you to have them.  They’re yours,” John whispers against Sherlock’s mouth, pressing kisses to his lips between his words, sealing them there.  “They always were.”
Then he drops out of Sherlock’s line of sight as he crouches down and lowers his head to lick the marmalade off of Sherlock’s prick.
John groans at the heat that is suddenly enveloping his stiff prick.  When they wank, it feels amazing—every time, no question—but there is just something about the warmth of a body wrapped completely around his hard cock that surpasses everything else.  He gives an experimental thrust and slides slickly through the tight space between Sherlock’s clenched thighs, the lotion making Sherlock’s skin smooth.  John pants into Sherlock’s neck at the feel of it and reaches his lotion-smeared hand around to Sherlock’s front, gripping Sherlock’s cock and stroking him.
Sherlock tries to nod but can’t seem to move his head correctly with his weight pressed down on it.  So instead he whimpers, “Uh-huh,” and fuck if it isn’t the sexiest little sound that John has ever heard.
He lets himself get lost in his memories for a while, winding down from his row with Mary and feeling the tension slowly drift away.  When he finishes his tea, it is still a decent hour and he isn’t ready to go back home yet, so he orders another and drinks it a bit slower.  When he finally feels that he can’t possibly put off going back any longer he sighs and bins his Styrofoam cups, leaving the warm glow of the coffee shop and stepping outside into the dark.
“Give me that little mouth,” John growls out as he pulls Sherlock forward once again by his hair.  Sherlock opens up obediently for him, taking him back into his mouth.  John’s cock twitches against his tongue, precome swelling up as Sherlock licks him clean of lube.
John has always enjoyed Sherlock on top of him.  The weight of him, the press, the feel.  Sherlock has only ever sat in his lap this way a few times, and in bed they hardly ever do anything in this position before John flips them over.  He doesn’t know why.  He loves it, certainly.  Maybe he is just afraid that Sherlock—innocent, still slightly-virginal Sherlock—will be uncomfortable with the implications of it.  John doesn’t want Sherlock to feel pressured into doing anything and this position certainly puts a lot of attention on Sherlock’s actions.  So John will savour it while he can.  He wraps his arms around Sherlock’s back, pulling him in close, and presses Sherlock against his chest.  Then he immediately tilts his head up so that John can kiss the brunet deeper, taste more of him.
Sherlock has taken over his life entirely and John has never even realised it.  He had never known how much of his day revolved around Sherlock until the boy isn’t there anymore: texts in the morning to say hello because they can’t see each other; secret smiles in the corridors as students shuffle from one class to the next; picture messages of Sherlock’s classwork from other subjects with more in-depth answers to the questions than could possibly be needed at a secondary school level; blushes struggling to be kept at bay while John gives his lesson to Sherlock’s class; texts at the end of the day to tell him whether or not they can be with each other later; kisses and touches and cool sheets and skulls watching with empty eyes while they get lost in each other; goodbye snogs and lectures on being sure to eat a proper dinner and not just the stale biscuits that John had brought with him two days ago.  Goodnight texts late at night because they can’t be with one another as they fall asleep.
“You didn’t come home after I fell asleep last night, did you?” she asks into the silence quietly, and John is suddenly slightly ashamed and somewhat disgusted with himself over that point, so he still doesn’t answer her.
He’ll do anything, he knows, anything at all, to keep Sherlock safe.  To make the boy feel that he isn’t alone any longer.  John will be a bright flame in the middle of Sherlock’s darkness and he will burn away anything that tries to hurt the child.   Sherlock has to see that.  He wants Sherlock to see that.
A few more weeks pass by in which John tries to settle into his new life.  He argues with Mary often and becomes a regular down at the pub, even meeting up with Mike every once in a while to share a pint.  Mostly, though, he just goes to work and puts a lot of attention into his lesson plans and course material.  He has even taken to creating work specifically for Sherlock, something that keeps him occupied and helps the student out.  He doesn’t grade Sherlock on those particular pieces of work; it is just extra information that he gives to the brunet to further his knowledge.  He finds that Sherlock has a passion for human anatomy and physiology, and John is more than happy to share his expertise in that area.
The thing that John can’t figure out, though, is: why him?  Why did Sherlock want a relationship with a man who is his teacher?  He could have gone back to drugs to keep himself occupied, he could have chosen anybody else in the world to fuck, but he picked John.
Sherlock stands from the table abruptly, making all of the science equipment and their tea cups rattle violently.  He grabs up his tepid tea and dumps it suddenly onto the front of John’s shirt, being sure to splash his crotch as well.
“Four,” he gasps out, and he finds it hard to breathe through the stinging pain for a moment.  “I made Molly cry.”
John doesn’t really know what to say.  It is true, all of it, completely, but he knows that telling the boy he is correct isn’t exactly something he should do.  So instead he ignores everything that Sherlock has said and replies with, “You share the same reason for waiting around the school after hours, then, do you?”
Across the table from him, Sherlock gives him a knowing smile.  “You don’t have to tell me,” he agrees, and the two look at each other over their styrofoam cups for a moment before they both laugh.
Sherlock moans as John enters him, his thighs quivering and wrapping around John’s waist, hands scrambling to grip John’s shoulders.  “Daddy,” he says, and the man stills as he gives Sherlock a moment to get used to the feel of him, the incredible stretch of it, before moving.
John moves to change their positions, lying Sherlock down amongst the pillows carefully and wiggling down on top of him.  “Just listen to me talk, Sherlock,” John says with a smile and a kiss to his lips.  “Concentrate on what I’m saying.  Let me describe what I’m feeling to you, and you can feel what I feel.  See if that helps.”
They continue going to Sherlock’s house whenever his father isn’t there, which seems to be quite a lot.  Sometimes they do nothing but sit and talk, cuddled up together on the sofa in the sitting room or curled around one another in Sherlock’s bed, and John comes to find that he rather enjoys Sherlock’s sharp elbows jabbing into him in uncomfortable places or the boy’s bony feet in his lap.  He delights in being able to spend any time with Sherlock away from the threat of prying eyes in a way they never were at the coffee shop.  He has even taken to stopping at a corner shop on his way over and bringing his own milk sometimes so that he can make them both a proper cup of tea.  He enjoys the days when they are at Sherlock’s house doing nothing but talking about forensic pathology, or internal medicine, or ghastly crimes that Sherlock seems obsessed with.
Sherlock’s skin feels like it’s about to burst apart, come open at the seams.  There is a build-up of pressure that is going nowhere, a dam of arousal that is keeping him from completion and he
Lestrade sighed, defeated again. “All right, you heard him, boys,” he called to the rest of the forensics team. “Back to the Yard and have another go at the ransom note.”
“Jesus, fuck,” John groans when he can’t take it any longer, pressing his hips forward in a rush and bottoming out inside of Sherlock.
“Please,” Sherlock scoffs.  “You forget that I see everything.  You wanted to hug me when you first came in.  And on top of that, I can also tell that you washed up before you came to meet me, which you never do.”  He points at John’s chest and John has never felt more like a bug under a microscope than he does right now, with Sherlock’s strange eyes flaying him open ferociously, mercilessly.  “You’ve changed into clean clothes—they’re too pressed for you to have worn them all day—and you are freshly shaven.    You put on your best cologne—I know it’s your best because you don’t wear it to school, so it’s something that you only use for special occasions—and you even brushed your teeth before you left your house.  I can smell the mint of your toothpaste on your breath.  You even styled your hair differently.”  He glares at John accusingly.  “You took the effort to look highly presentable.  And the way you’ve been looking at me all night…I thought you would have been happy that I returned your feelings.”
“It’s harder for your body to take in a third finger,” John says as he slips another finger in next to the first two, “but it tries so hard, I can feel it.”  The stretch is uncomfortable for a moment and Sherlock strains against the slight burn before remembering that it will be better if he bears down against it.  “You try so hard for me, it’s lovely,” John praises him and Sherlock works harder to loosen his muscles.  “You open up so slowly; I always have to be so careful not to hurt you.  But it’s always worth it to see you this way.  And when I find just the right spot,” John curls his fingers a certain way, searching, and he knows when he’s found what he is looking for as Sherlock cries out against the electric sparks of pleasure that shoot through his body and set everything alight, “you make the most perfect sound.  I always want to kiss you right then, so that I can swallow that sound down and keep it in me forever.”
Across the room from him, Mary is exasperated and looks like she’s at her wits end.  Like she is the one who this is hurting.  “He just had a question about the clinic back in London, John!” she explains, her voice shrill and loud.  “I’m not talking to him again!”
Sherlock looks up at him with wide eyes, wet with reflexive tears, his mouth stretched open around John’s thick cock and nods as best he can, moaning out something that could be translated into a “yes”.
“Yes,” Sherlock agrees, smirking and still out of breath.  “I don’t think I’ve ever enjoyed a meal so much.”
He trails his kisses across Sherlock’s face, down Sherlock’s neck and chest, and then over to his soft belly.  John knows that Sherlock is more ticklish than he has ever let on to be, and so John takes the opportunity to pepper warm kisses along Sherlock’s perfect little belly button.  Then he inhales a deep breath and, before Sherlock knows what is happening, John blows out a big wet raspberry on Sherlock’s tummy, tickling him and making the boy squawk and squirm against him.  Sherlock laughs and wiggles underneath him, John’s still-hard erection responding to every single one of Sherlock’s movements.
“What’s all the ruckus about, boys?” they heard from the stairway up to John’s room. Mrs. Hudson soon appeared, climbing the steps in a rush and frowning. “Not putting anymore holes in my walls, I hope. You still owe me from the last set you made.”
John pulls back slightly but keeps fucking Sherlock’s face, thrusting in and out steadily.  He knows his boy can’t take a cock that demanding yet, and John doesn’t want to hurt him, so he keeps his thrusts shallow.  He feels Sherlock go pliant around his prick, mouth going slack and throat relaxing as he lets John hold the weight of his head.  John likes Sherlock best when he is like this—so trusting, even after John has tried to choke him with cock only a moment before.
John’s stomach churns once again, but this time it is in anger.  He can’t believe the incredible audacity of this man, this worthless excuse of a brother.  What gives him the right to talk to John like this, to judge John for his actions, when he has left Sherlock alone for the boy’s entire life?  It’s preposterous and he swallows against the rage that seems to almost choke him.  “Are we done?” he asks, ready to turn away before he loses what little self-control he has left and punches the poncy git right in his face.
When he is fully dressed once more, John quietly makes his way to the side of Sherlock’s bed and stares down at the sleeping teen.  He reaches a cautious hand out to brush Sherlock’s fringe away from his face so that he can see him better, and he frowns down at his lover in confusion.  He wants to wake Sherlock up and ask him about what just happened, what Sherlock was playing at.  But he knows that Sherlock needs the rest more than John needs answers to his questions—he doesn’t know the last time Sherlock had a decent sleep.
John restrains himself, however, and instead says, “I want you to count them for me, Sherlock, all right?  And I’ll take a thank you after each one, as well.  Then you’re to ask me for the next one.  Is that clear?”  It’s a lot of directions, he knows, but it is the point he is still trying to prove: that Sherlock doesn’t have the restraint he thinks he does, that even simple instructions are too far out of his control to follow at times like these.
The words break John’s heart into a million pieces, and he doesn’t know what to say to them so he says nothing.
For the past few weeks—ever since he had started getting bigger—every morning always started the same. He would measure the ever-growing width of his waist, the length from the bottom of his sternum to the top of his pubic bone, and the amount of weight that he gained from one day to the next. All the measurements would be meticulously written down in his notebook, along with each cramp, each craving, each pinched nerve. Nothing was left out of the data, not even sexual desires that came in crashing waves at the most random moments. Everything was jotted down—much to John’s mortification—and at only 5 months into Sherlock’s pregnancy, he had already filled up two composition notebooks and was working on his third.
John sighs as he enters the house because he thought that he had already put an end to this conversation earlier, but it seems not.  “We talked about this already,” he says, trying not to sound frustrated as he makes his way straight to Sherlock’s bedroom.
And suddenly Greg was pushing closer to him, forcing him back against the wall with a small thud and pressing their bodies closer together, making what space had been between them disappear, his hands moving up to comb through John’s hair as his tongue continued to taste John’s mouth, and the blonde man felt himself move of his own volition.
Sherlock doesn’t give himself much time to adjust to the stretch.  He pulls his hand back and brings it to his face again, sliding his fingers into his mouth once more to rewet them before replacing them at his arse.  John knows he is squeezing two fingers in this time because he knows what an impatient, greedy little thing Sherlock is in bed.  He would worry about Sherlock hurting himself but he knows that his little boy can take a hard fucking from time to time.
John sighed suddenly and moved violently on the chair, trying to get into a more comfortable position to no avail.  The object groaned in protest underneath him.  “Please, Sherlock, for the love of all that is good and holy…let me get some sleep.  I’m so tired.”
John levels him with a look that says that he isn’t stupid and Sherlock would do well to remember that.  “What did we just say about you being honest with Daddy, young man?” he asks, and Sherlock has the decency to look chastised.  “I know you almost better than you know yourself, Sherlock.  Better than anyone else in the world,” he reminds the child tenderly.  “Never forget that.  I remember what you used to look like when I first met you.  How hurt you used to look when you thought you would always be alone.”  John pauses and runs his fingers through the dark, soft curls, taking the opportunity to get the slight quavering of his voice under control.  “I hated seeing you look like that, baby.  I hated seeing the way that you thought of yourself.  I know that you still feel that way sometimes.  I know that it’s still hard for you, being so different from everyone, seeing things the way you do, but you have nothing to be ashamed of.”  Sherlock had readily admitted the reasons for his relapse, while John had held him in his arms through the worst of the withdrawals.  He had said that sometimes everything in his head is just too much, and he can’t handle it, no matter how often he tells John that he is all Sherlock needs to make things better.  John had to learn that things just don’t work that way, in the real world.  “You’re brilliant.  Amazing.  So beautiful.  And, yeah,” he licks his lips and contemplates what he is about to say before deciding that it is definitely the last thing that needs to go on the list, and nods his head.  “This one needs to go down, too: ‘Every day I must tell Daddy one good thing I like about myself’.”
John sighs and presses the heel of his hand against his crotch under the countertop.  The erection seems to have flagged somewhat, which is good news—at least he won’t have to go to hospital for it—but he can feel the beginnings of a rather large headache coming on.  “Almost 4 hours ago now,” he answers, purposefully omitting the fact that this is the fourth erection he has been the proud owner of in that amount of time.  There are some things that even best mates don’t share.  “I’ll probably just cut it in half,” he tells the other man as Mike sneaks a few more chips off of John’s plate.  “I think 50 milligrams was a little much for me.”
He worries about Sherlock.  Constantly.   He knows Sherlock hates being around his brother—after only a few minutes with the elder Holmes, John can understand why—and he wonders how Sherlock is coping.  John wonders if he is eating, if he is angry, if he is smoking again.  If he is wanting something stronger than nicotine—that 7% solution that he has told John haltingly, sparingly, about.  He knows that Sherlock won’t go out and buy himself nicotine patches, so if he’s run out he will most likely be smoking again.  John wonders if Sherlock is staying under Mycroft’s watchful eye or trying to sneak off undetected.  He thinks about Sherlock’s too-thin coat because the stubborn brat wanted to use the extra money Mycroft had given him to buy some more science equipment, and he thinks about how the weather is still unseasonably cold.  John spends days not eating, pacing about his home, drinking alone at the pub where he and Mike meet sometimes, checking his phone constantly.
“I made a promise, Sherlock, and I didn’t keep it,” John explained, his hands fluttering about wildly in his distress, the .22 still in his grasp.  “I don’t want to start off our baby’s life with me not able to keep promises to him.”
, but the more they play this game the deeper they fall.  John shouldn’t be surprised: Sherlock never had a childhood, never had a father with whom to share all of these special bonding moments.  There has only ever been John.
Silence settled onto the group as John stared them down, and even Sherlock didn’t make another sound.
John pushes a third finger into Sherlock, stretching him widely at a speed that seems too slow but that he simultaneously worries may be too fast.  He doesn’t ever want to hurt Sherlock, yet even though he has fucked Sherlock almost nonstop for the past two days, it seems like John can’t ever wait long enough to make sure he is properly stretched before wanting to slide his cock into him.  But John forces himself to take a deep breath and slow down.  He rubs his hand up along Sherlock’s shaft and across his groin, up Sherlock’s soft belly and over his side soothingly as John continues to stretch and prep him for just a little while longer.  John watches the younger male closely as Sherlock writhes against his hands, face flushed and lips swollen and red from his teeth.
“Sherlock, these people…” John stared at the letters around them, too, all of them opened now, and lying on the bed like little white promises of hope and courage.  “This is amazing.”
“No, of course not!” John assures him quickly and somewhat loudly.  He looks around to be sure he hasn’t brought any attention to them and turns back to Sherlock, lowering his voice.  “I want you to quit for you.  It’s not healthy, you know that.  A kid your age shouldn’t be smoking as much as you do.”
There is no hesitation in John’s movements as he walks over to their bed and climbs back into it, crawling into the warm, sleep-softened circle of Sherlock’s arms.  Sherlock holds him tightly, squeezing John around his slightly rounded middle, long fingers tracing every scar that they can touch through the thin white vest that John is wearing now.  His fingertips leave burning trails of fire on John’s skin that send shivers of warmth through his old, battered body.
The man grins wickedly against the sweaty skin.  “Yeah, that’s it, love.  Louder.  I want to hear it.  I want to hear you scream for me.”
He dared a glance up at Sherlock and was surprised to see the brunet man staring steadily at him through wide, unbelieving eyes.  A faint, adorable blush colored his cheeks and the bridge of his nose.
John frowns, not happy with his answer.  "Do you want Daddy's cock, Sherlock?" he asks once more, his tone slightly harsher.
“So, where do you want to go first?” John asks him, eyes on the road in front of them, which is slick from the light rain that has been falling all morning.  It is still early yet in the day and they have hours ahead of them to enjoy.  Together.
After a moment his knees begin to hurt in earnest, the delicate bones rolling back and forth along the hardwood floor beneath him as Sherlock thrusts into him over and over again, ruthlessly, but he knows better than to say anything.  If he were to complain, Sherlock would only fuck him harder, anyways.  There is no escaping anything Sherlock wants to subject him to.  But that’s okay, because John doesn’t really want him to stop in the first place.
“Yes, John,” Sherlock cries out, eyes screwed shut.  He ruts against John some more, trying to relieve some of the pressure John knows he must be feeling, much like himself.  “Anything you want, just please, make me go again.  I can’t stand this.”  He lets out a shuddery little sob and John finally takes pity on him.  He wants to come so badly, and he thinks Sherlock deserves a reward after being such a good boy for him.
John fidgets in the shoddy little seat at the corner table uncomfortably, his knee knocking into his cane where it is propped against the chair.  This isn’t a conversation he wants to be having with anyone, much less a student of his.  Jesus, not even Mike asks him such personal questions, and they’ve been mates for years.  But here is Sherlock—young and brash and constantly thirsty for knowledge—and John has never been very good at not answering his probing, invasive questions.  “Well…” he begins uncomfortably but Sherlock cuts him off with a small sound of surprise.
And then, finally, John drew breath to speak, and his answer left Sherlock feeling as faint and light-headed as all the previous disconnected information John had just given him.
“No,” Sherlock puffs as he continues to squirm incessantly in tiny little mind-blowing movements.  “Can’t.”
But that day he had agreed with John.  A good sign, indeed.  When he had first seen the photograph, whole and undamaged, it had been as close to a miracle as Sherlock had thought anything was.  Even if he didn’t believe in
At that Sherlock grimaces and John can’t help but laugh.  “No, that won’t be necessary.  This is sufficient,” Sherlock says and then pauses a moment.  John can see him blushing in the weak phosphorescent lighting around them only because Sherlock’s skin is so beautifully pale.  “Thank you,” Sherlock whispers to him and reaches a hesitant hand out to take the cupcake from John’s grasp.
A million reasons for why he shouldn’t be doing this flit through his mind, but he can’t really find any of them viable enough to make him keep his cock in his pants.  So he pulls his pyjama bottoms down while he sits there in the dark room, the only light coming from the glow of the telly that is still on, and he tries to take a decent enough picture of his own prick to send back to his lover in return.
“You haven’t called me that in ages,” Mary whispers to him, a strange look dancing across her face.  Then she smiles brightly at him, and for a split second John sees the woman that he married, happy and beautiful, the expression in her eyes full of warmth and love for him.
When they are finally settled, John gives him one final kiss and then says, “Okay, I’m going to start now.  Just listen to the sound of my voice, all right?  Don’t think too much.”
He drops to his knees right there in the bathroom, with Sherlock sitting on the closed lid of the toilet, and moves to unbuckle Sherlock’s trousers.  Sherlock leans back against the cistern of the toilet and cants his hips to give John better access because the teen can’t use both hands to help John thanks to the large plaster over his palm, and one hand is only a hindrance.  John gets the job done on his own, though, gently pulling Sherlock’s trousers and pants down his bony hips and leaving them around the brunet’s pale thighs, exposing his slender, elegant cock to the cool air.
Sherlock falls back against John’s chest once more but John holds him this time, lets Sherlock shake and tremble against him.  “I won’t leave you, Sherlock.  I promised you I never would, didn’t I?” he asks, thinking back to the days early on in their relationship, when Sherlock was still so scared of being left, of being abandoned by the people he cared about, just like his mother, just like his brother, just like every person he had known in his life who was supposed to have loved and cared for him.
“John, don’t make me out to be the bad guy,” Lestrade complained.  “We both know that I don’t want to make this even harder on you.  I—” he trailed off, and Sherlock could have sworn that he was blushing slightly, but it could have been the red filtered light shining down on his face from the ambulance siren above them.
Sherlock simply rolls his eyes.  “What would have been the point?” he asks with a shrug.  “It’s not like there’s anyone who will do anything for me.”
“You, too,” he tells Sherlock, who has stopped rubbing himself in favour of watching John.  Sherlock’s cock is still hard, though, and John knows that it won’t be long before he comes.
Sherlock sobs and clenches down tight around him, making John groan and his hips stutter for a fraction of a second.
“What the fuck is the matter with you, Sherlock?  Hmm?” John shouts as he bangs into Sherlock’s bedroom late on Sunday morning, having just gotten back in town from an achingly uncomfortable car ride home with his furious wife.  He had dropped her off at their house, unpacked, and then came straight to see Sherlock, finding him in his bedroom, sitting at his desk behind his microscope.
John’s lips followed his hands, drifting lower and lower, and placing small, wet kisses along all the skin he exposed as he made a trail downwards, pulling down Sherlock’s pajama bottoms.   “It will be strong,” he kissed Sherlock’s chest, “and healthy,” he kissed Sherlock’s distended belly, “and smart,” he kissed Sherlock’s hip bone, “and a complete handful—just like you.” He took Sherlock’s length into his hot mouth, swirling his tongue around the tip wetly. “Perfect,” he finished, releasing Sherlock’s cock.
And then he turned and descended the stairs of 221b, leaving Sherlock and John standing out on the landing and looking down after him as he opened the front door and walked out onto Baker Street, getting swallowed up by the crowd of reporters and flashes of light that had made their way back to the stoop.
He writhes beneath John’s body and arches up into his hand as John slowly—finally—trails it towards his straining cock.  Sherlock enjoys this; he wasn’t lying to John about that.  He can feel arousal and stimulation normally, and he basks in the feelings running through his body, letting them flow over him, letting John take care of him.
He tears into Sherlock’s mouth, making Sherlock gasp as he falls into John’s body, sliding against the mess that he left on John’s stomach.  Beneath him, John grinds his wet cock into the delicate juncture where Sherlock’s thigh meets his hip, making Sherlock hiss a sharp breath at the feel of the still-stiff flesh digging into him.
“Please,” Sherlock scoffs, pulling a face that John laughs at when he sees the reflection of it in the window of the car—Sherlock has had his nose plastered to the glass ever since they entered the city.  “As if he would let me go to a public university in London.  He took me to Cambridge and Oxford and some other stuffy old universities in boring places that I’ve already deleted.  He said that he thought I would be too distracted in a big city like London, easily pulled off course.  He says there’s too much temptation for me.  He wants me to go where my mother or father went to study, where he went.  Mycroft would have a myocardial infarction if I told him that I wanted to come to London and study at Imperial College or Queen Mary University.”
“There’s your cecum,” the technician said, frowning and digging into Sherlock’s belly a little harder.
He fought back the anxiety, the all-consuming panic of the situation.  Fought it back with every breath that he took and sat, still and silent, until the hyperventilation’s had passed and his mind, somewhat calmed by the steady, slow breathing, could finally focus on one thought:
John gets Sherlock’s belt undone and begins working on his flies, kissing him messily, forcing Sherlock’s mouth open so that he can get deeper.  He pulls the zipper of Sherlock’s trousers down and his fingers automatically dive underneath Sherlock’s clothing, revelling in the warmth, the feel of soft, naked skin against his gun-calloused hands.  Sherlock moans against his mouth.
“Come on, Sherlock!  It all makes perfect sense!” John yelled out, waving his hands emphatically, no longer calm and composed in the face of Sherlock’s ridicule.
!  But he knew that the doctor was weary and wary, and, despite everything going on in the world outside this building, he was being as accommodating to Sherlock as he could be at the moment.
“I have to agree,” he responded, his own voice a whisper so as not to disturb the sleeping infant.  “I never…apologized for…what happened,” he said, somewhat awkwardly, not looking at John but instead staring at Callum.
“Of course, John,” Sherlock said simply.  “We have nowhere else to go.”  He knew better than anyone that he could not get on with Mycroft for more than a few minutes before they began nitpicking at each other like little schoolboys, but he and John didn’t really seem to have any other options at the moment.  So he had resigned himself to the good will that he knew Mycroft was going to offer up.  Just because he had not gotten the text yet didn’t mean that his brother was not going to offer, he knew this.
They continue to hold hands the entire time they walk aimlessly down the busy streets, blushing and giggling about it like school children but enjoying themselves immensely.  When they pass a particular shop that caters to men’s clothes, Sherlock sees a coat that catches his attention.  It is a sharp looking number in a dark blue material that seems to be nicer than any piece of clothing Sherlock has, barring what Mycroft sends him perhaps.  It is a calf-length Belstaff that looks to be far warmer than any coat Sherlock has ever owned, never having anyone who cared overly about being sure that he was dressed appropriately for England’s changeable weather.  John empties half of his personal savings account buying it for him, the one that he keeps separate from Mary, and doesn’t even think twice about it.  They purchase it in a larger size, so that it will last through a few more of Sherlock’s remaining growth spurts that John knows he is bound to have soon.
he must be—the doctor is sure he hasn’t slept for days—no matter how exhausted Sherlock is, the withdrawals will probably keep him from drifting off and actually finding any peace in rest.  John will have to look into asking another physician down at the clinic for a low dose sleep aide as well, just something to keep Sherlock on for a week or two until the worst of the withdrawals are over.  John knows it wasn’t a big relapse, but it certainly was a severe binge.  With Sherlock’s long history of drug use, he doesn’t want to leave anything to chance; he doesn’t want to treat this as if it is just a small bump in the road.  He knows that if they don’t take this seriously, it could potentially lead to other binges, other relapses.  And he won’t let that happen.  He’ll die before he loses Sherlock to drugs or anything else in this world.
And suddenly, John’s frown melted into a smile of his own and the boys grinned devilishly at each other, wide wolf smiles that shined mischievously in the darkness of their bedroom.
John chuckles as he continues mixing.  “What a strange thing to be thinking about.  Only you would wonder something like that,” he says, a hint of something like pride in his voice.  He looks down at the leftover chocolate chips they have, and at the squeeze tube of chocolate sauce he was going to use to drizzle over the biscuits when they were done.  A wicked thought comes into his mind.
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock groans out, near mindless with want.  He can feel his cock hanging heavy between his legs, but John has ignored it completely the entire time he has prepped Sherlock, and the brunet man just wants relief.
“I’m giving you some attention, John,” Sherlock said darkly against his neck, biting down hard on the soft flesh and making John cry out. The hand that he wasn’t using to play with John’s cock was unbuttoning his shirt fervently, pushing it off of his shoulders when he had worked through all the small buttons. “I’m giving you the kind of attention that you can’t get anywhere else. Even if you wanted to.”
“I must warn you, though, Mr. Holmes,” Dr. Greenwhich said suddenly, voice not nearly as cheerful as it had been a moment ago.  “The chance for peritonitis is high if you wait too long after the signs of labor first appear.  You need to be sure that you come straight to the hospital if you even suspect that you have gone into labor.  Do you understand everything that I have explained to you, Mr. Holmes?”
Above him, John continues to speak, and even though his voice has gone breathless there is still that hard edge to it, that velvet darkness.
For a moment Sherlock looks as though he is going to refuse John’s offer.  But the rain is coming down so heavily that the inside of John’s door and his arm are soaking wet from having rolled the window down to shout at Sherlock, and John can feel that it is a bitterly cold rain, the kind that stings when it hits skin.  It is only another second or two before Sherlock gives in and walks around the car to get into the passenger seat.
John tries to hold back a wince at that, although Sherlock is steadfastly avoiding looking at him.  He knows Sherlock doesn’t like his brother, but it still must hurt to know the only real family he has left, the only family who could still care for him adequately, doesn’t even want to try.  John’s sure, though, that Sherlock didn’t make it easy for Mycroft, who was trying to start a promising, important career.  John thinks about a younger Sherlock, small and inquisitive, sneaking away from his older brother and causing him all sorts of trouble.  If Sherlock is such a pain in the arse now, John can only imagine what kind of child he had been.  John thinks back on the night Sherlock first told him about his brother.  He remembers the teen saying that Mycroft believes Sherlock is single-handedly trying to bring down his career.  John can’t help but chuckle at that thought.  He can see how someone like Mycroft might think that, although John knows that Sherlock’s actions are only the cry of a child aching for attention, for stimulation, for someone to nurture the genius on the cusp of breaking free.  John can only stifle a laugh as he imagines what kind of hellion Sherlock would have been as a child if he had been nurtured properly, allowed to flourish to his full potential.
“Yes,” John agrees, and there is no break between the second and third spanks the way there was with the first two.  John brings his hand back down across Sherlock’s soft skin, in a different spot, but no less powerful than the second swat.  Sherlock can’t tell if it hurts more or less than being hit in the same place twice.
If Greg noticed the slight movement, the only indication he gave of his disapproval was a hard set of his lips and another rude remark towards the consulting detective.  “Come on then, Sherlock.  Astound us, like old days.  But be quick about it, I’ve got a lot of paperwork to finish up.”
They worked silently together for a few hours, speaking only when necessary.  Sherlock still seemed to be lost in his own thoughts, and John took advantage of the opportunity to think about the things that had transpired that day, and everything that he and Greg had said to each other.  They were both so engrossed in putting the nursery together and in their own thoughts that John didn’t even notice how late it had gotten until he stood up from bending over the now finished crib, wincing at a cramp in his back, and checked his watch with a groan.
He groans as he releases over his fist, his come mixing with Sherlock’s, sliding warm and wet over his fingers.  He loosens his grip slightly but continues to stroke them, drawing out their orgasms and searching for Sherlock’s mouth with his own.  When he finds it, he presses a searing kiss against it, no less passionate despite his climax.
John thinks that Sherlock means it to be said with an air of amusement, but the older man doesn’t laugh.  Instead he frowns and reaches a hand slowly across the table towards the boy.  “Is that what happened here?” he asks as he softly touches Sherlock’s face, tracing the tips of his fingers along a fading bruise that runs across the teen’s sharp cheekbone.
As he lies in the cold bed he thinks back tiredly on their life together and how they had been happy once, a long time ago.  He wonders when his wife had turned into a person he doesn’t even recognise anymore, and if she thinks the same about him.  But it is late and he is drained and weary, so he tries hard not to dwell on it and prepares himself for sleep.  Their last row had started shortly after dinner and they have been at it for hours, and he has work in the morning.
“Why the hell are you breaking into my house in the middle of the night?” John hisses, throwing the covers off of himself and moving to sit on the edge of the bed.  “Do you know how dangerous that is?  What if I had thought you were a burglar?”  He doesn’t tell the boy that if Sherlock had done this while John had been in the main bedroom, Sherlock would have a face full of the barrel-end of a gun right now.  John keeps the service piece he had managed to smuggle out of the Army after his discharge loaded in the drawer of his nightstand, by his bed, for reasons which he doesn’t ever really dwell on.
“We’ll need to go shopping for electronics again,” the brunette man was mumbling to himself, staring at the far wall of the room with his fingers steepled in front of his mouth, not paying John any attention again.
They’ll go to London before he leaves with Mary for the weekend and they’ll spend the whole day there, where no one knows them and they can be together, enjoying each other’s company.  Sherlock will love going to London with him, John is sure of it.
John sighs and brings a hand up to scrub the sleep from his face, relaxing instantly.  “Have you been up all night?” he asks without preamble.
Before John knows it, Sherlock is almost finished with the container of fruit that John had meant for the two of them to share, on top of having eaten his whole sandwich.  “I knew you were hungry.  See?” John chastises him gently, smiling proudly at how well Sherlock has behaved for him.  “All you had to do was listen to me.”

“Fine!” John suddenly shouted out, throwing his arms up in the air.  “You want me to prove it?  Let’s do it then.  Even if I’m wrong, at least I know I can get you to shut up for a little while—you won’t be able to talk with your mouth full.”
John looks down the line of their bodies to watch Sherlock grind his erection against John’s own hardness and stares at the two of them pressed so closely together.
“For someone who says they don’t like the attention,” he teased Sherlock as the brunette lay sprawled out on the couch, long legs dangling over the armrest and a cup of tea resting on the growing mound of his belly, “you sure do get your photo in the paper an awful lot.”
“No, you were the first,” Sherlock says off-handedly, as if it isn’t a big deal.  “I’ve never done anything having to do with…” he makes a vague hand gesture without looking up from his paper, “that.”
John sighs in relief at the out that his friend has provided for him.  “Probably, yeah,” he tells Mike truthfully.
Behind him he hears Sherlock chuckle darkly.  “You’ll take what I want to give you, John, and you won’t complain.”  He clicks his tongue slightly in reproach.  “You know better than that.”  His fingers run over the head of John’s sensitive cock, squeezing the crown and milking the last few drops of come out of him, fingers smearing through it messily and spreading it down the shaft as he continues to pump John languidly.
John thinks it is the most amazing thing ever, to get to hear Sherlock’s little hitching, huffing cries of pleasure perfectly timed with the gentle jerks of John’s hand and the thrust of his cock as Sherlock’s orgasm takes control of his body.  On the sides of John’s belly, Sherlock’s fingers are holding tightly, having clamped down on him at the start of his orgasm.  Now, Sherlock grips him harshly as he continues to make tiny little movements on John’s cock, milking out the last of his orgasm with no suggestion of control or dignity any longer, only need and pleasure.  It’s the most arousing, endearing thing John has seen, and his heart flutters at the sight of it.
Sherlock grumbles in a sleep-gravelly voice but doesn’t disagree, and pulls himself out of bed to do as John says.  When he’s gone into his en suite, not even bothering to close the door, John shakes his head in exasperation and makes his way to the kitchen.  Once there, John has to carefully navigate his way around to be sure he doesn’t set anything on fire while he cooks—eggs, beans, and sausage with toast, just about the only thing he can make without burning.  It is just about finished by the time Sherlock comes out, looking well-rested and scrubbed pink and fresh from his shower in a pair of pyjama bottoms and an old faded tee.  Sherlock makes tea in silence while John finishes their breakfast and they serve each other, setting plates and cups on the worktop as they stand up to eat because the kitchen table is covered in all sorts of debris.  John thinks it is endearingly domestic and he smiles at Sherlock, who blushes at him in silence.
“Yes, that’s perfect,” John whispers, running his hands through Sherlock’s hair gently, a sharp contrast to the rough thrust of his hips.  “You’re so good for me, darling.  And do you know what good little boys get?”
He could only imagine what John thought of the past year.  He had had to fight his own battles, while Sherlock struggled with his, both separated and brought together by the same thing, by the same love they felt for each other and for their unborn child.
John stared at him for a moment, astonishment turning to anger in an instant.  “Is that what you think, then?” John asked, and Sherlock could see his body tensing in fury against the outline of the fire behind him.  “That I’m just some bloody idiot, someone who you’ve been toying with this whole time, because I give you a good laugh?  So that you can see what ‘normal’ people are really like?”
“Yours is more comfortable,” Sherlock answered simply, reaching a hand out mechanically to grab a crisp off of the side table.  Only when his hand grasped thin air did he pull his gaze away from the telly, staring down at the empty space where his snack had been and then frowning up at John.
When the men dragging him down the alley finally stopped walking, they pushed him away roughly, making him stumble into a brick wall.  His outstretched hands softened the blow of falling against the stones as most of the shock was absorbed into his wrists.  Thankfully, they gave him a few seconds to shake the worst of the dizziness and disconcertion off now that he was finally still, with a solid, unmoving wall on which to ground himself against.
The politician is standing in the middle of their sitting room looking composed, as if the scene playing out before him is not effecting him in the slightest.  Mycroft stares steadily at Sherlock when he states quite frankly, “I told you that the next time you relapsed you were going away to the rehab facility for much longer.”
“Since you’re so iffy with calling me back, and could probably use some company seeing your scattered state at the shop, I decided to come to pay you a visit. I’ve brought breakfast, can I come in?” Mike smiled widely at his friend. John’s face somehow managed to both pale and grow rosy red in at the same time and he cleared his throat, swiftly swiping his tongue over his lips.
Hope you enjoyed this chapter as well! My approach to Sherlock is slightly different, but I hope it will make sense story-wise and that you end up liking my take on him!
“Yeah, person. You’re the person that is the most important to me and we live in the same flat,” John smiled softly but groaned suddenly as Sherlock had squirmed closer, wrapping all his limbs hastily around John, squeezing him tightly.
“But… You talk to me… Don’t that make you feel better?” Sherlock questioned and John chuckled a little.
“That’s good, do you want to leave? Go back home for a bit before we go to that café perhaps for a light dinner instead?” John said, not wanting to deny the option, but wanting Sherlock to feel fully healthy. Sherlock took a deep breath and shook his head.
John hurried up to his bedroom, getting inside quickly and slumping down onto the bed. The little house was quiet, and John was quite content about that. Though, he winced as there was a soft knock on his door. “Yeah?” John said and the door opened just a little. “Happy birthday rugby-brain.” Harry murmured before shutting the door gently. John blushed. “Thanks...” He murmured, seeing the door open a bit more. “Mum and dad might've forgotten but I haven't. I'm your bloody sister. Can't forget the day you were born and poisoned my life forever.” She said but smirked softly, leaning against the wall. John chuckled. “Cheers sis.” He said and propped himself up on his elbows a bit. Harry nodded and sighed. “I brought you something. More for fun really. I know you're too old for these.” She said and chucked a small packet of rugby player trading cards in a foil wrapper onto the bed. “You loved these when you were little.” She said and smiled. John picked up the little packet, blushing, his eyes wide. He did remember that he loved them, and he couldn't believe his sister had been so thoughtful. “Harry.... Thank you so much...” He mumbled and looked up at her with misty eyes and a smile. She rolled her eyes. “Don't get all sentimental on me, you won't get a gift next time if you do. Go on, open 'em and let's see what you got.” She said and sat down on the bed. She watched as John nodded and very gently began to open the cards. “So... Where were you all evening anyway? I promise I won't tell.” She said and looked up at John. John bit his lip. “I was with my new friend Sherlock. His... His family decided to celebrate my birthday by taking me out for dinner. They're really nice.” He said with a nod. Harry smirked and chuckled. “Your /friend/ huh?” She said and John frowned. “What's that supposed to mean? Yes, my friend, what about it?” John said, a bit defensive. Harry shook her head. “Nah, nothing, I'll let you find that out on your own, just like I did.” She said and ruffled John's hair before she stood up and started to walk to the door. John frowned deeper. “What do you mean 'like you did'? What's that supposed to mean? Harry!” John huffed when Harry closed the door. “'Like I did'...” John repeated quietly to himself, putting the cards back into the foil packet and into a secure drawer in his nightstand.
“Myc-” Sherlock said as his brother reached the door, turning around swiftly. “Thank you.” He said softly with a nod. Mycroft turned around and smiled a little, giving Sherlock a little nod back before leaving the room.
Talking helps but it doesn't stop the guilt. My hand hurts. Now I need to call someone to patch the wall. Great, they're probably going to think I'm a psychopath.
“John, I’m not broken. You don’t need to walk on eggshells around me. I’m fine. You’re allowed to be upset.”
“I’m sorry I didn’t mean to make it seem like… I’m not going to- not going to leave you. Okay? Ever. But you left me behind. You let me grieve your death. You threw my whole life away and left me with nothing. I will never be able to forget this, Sherlock, and I need you to understand that. Things aren’t going to be the same for a while. But for now, I need you to be honest with me and tell me exactly what you were thinking when you-” John balls his fist ”-you left me. You let me go to- go to your funeral. You let me visit your grave and I talked to you. And two years!”
"Oh! Don't be cheeky! This is only the first date but you nev- wait! How do you know about the whole 'Three Continents' thing?"
"I don't know much about people, John, but I do know that most people would stop being friends with someone after all...that," Sherlock retorted.
The snipers were immediately rid of by Mycroft’s people when deemed safe, and I wanted to tell you then, to see you, to leave you a message or a hint that I was still alive, but I couldn’t risk it. Moriarty’s network is huge, vast, everywhere. Undoubtedly he left people to monitor you, checking to be sure you were acting as if you were truly in mourning. If I had told you the truth and your behavior suddenly shifted, you could have died. I could not risk it.
It's okay. Everything is going to be okay. Ella advised me to talk to him about "my concerns" so I'll just call him. Calling is allowed, right? He did say we need to talk more. Okay, yeah. I'll do that. I'll just call him.
When they reach the top and turn the corner, rays of sunshine filter through a massive, circular, glass face encased in a very familiar cast iron frame that illuminates a narrow hallway.
"Why are you here? Why are you watching over me? Why do you care about my drug use? Why did you save me?" Sherlock demanded.
“After? You’ll go back home. To Baker Street of course. I’ll visit you all the time. We’ll start taking cases again. Mrs. Hudson will be floored,” he chuckles. Then his face drops. “God, she doesn’t know, does she?”
They sit on the concrete floor and Sherlock removes the golden brown bottle from the bag, taking a swig and passing it to John. They continue to share the drink for some time and partake in their usual banter. There are large moments of silence between them that are at first quite comfortable. However, the tone shifts the more they drink, morphing into something darker as repressed thoughts slug their way upwards to consciousness.
Sherlock’s knees buckle and John holds on tighter, forcing him to stay up. After a few minutes of grabbing each other, John silently crying into Sherlock’s shoulder and Sherlock reciprocating into John’s hair.
“They’re your friends, Sherlock. I know neither of us like talking about those sort of things but you don’t need to go into any details. I think eventually you should tell them- and me- more about what happened, but for now if they ask just say you’re staying with me and you’re taking a break from work. They’ll understand.”
"Just text her. Phone her. Do something while there's still a chance because that chance doesn't last forever. Trust me, Sherlock. It's gone before you know it. Before. You. Know it," John scolded.
I am sorry if this confession tainted your fonder memories with me. I’m sorry if I have made you uncomfortable or upset.
“Yeah of course, I know, it’s just… Christ. Mrs. Hudson and Greg and everyone at the Yard- they’re about to have their entire lives turned upside down.”
“Yeah. Yeah, thanks.” John takes another swig. “Ya know, there’s this funny thing really that I did. Before I asked her to marry me. I went to Baker Street. Went into the old flat. Our flat. I wanted to ask for your permission,” John scoffs, “as if you were here. As if I need your permission to marry someone. It was just a- a silly little thing. That I did. Not quite sure why.”
“Hush! That was meant to be rhetorical. Okay, so maybe they didn’t know him. Maybe there’s another reason why trusted him. But they didn’t just let them in their homes, they actively got in a vehicle with them to a remote location. You don’t do that with people you barely know. People are cautious about those kinds of things. Except...”
Sherlock sighed. "As I think I have explained to you many times before, romantic entanglement, while fulfilling for other people-"
This letter is becoming enormous; I have wasted enough of your time. I should stop stalling and get to the final point.
“Yeah, you have a point.” Neither of them moves. “But I have a feeling you don’t want to be alone tonight.”
“John it has occurred to me that maybe I owe you some sort of apology,” Sherlock says with a sad grimace. His eyes shine up at John.
“Oi!” John faces Sherlock, snatches his wrist and rises. “Just for that, breaks over.” He yanks Sherlock up on his feet, barely giving Sherlock time to grab the brown bag he’d been carrying.
“Wait- don’t tell me!” Mary exclaims as she taps her fingers in concentration. “Boomerang!” She exclaims, eyes set alight. “It was a boomerang! Right?”
Sherlock considers that maybe he should be nicer to John’s probably-going-to-be-wife. However, he also couldn’t be arsed to do so.
“I can’t believe you’re back. I mean I can- I do believe- I just- I went so long thinking I’d never see you again,” John mumbles.
Ella is right, I need to stop. Sherlock has been through Hell and back and he is still amazing, vibrant, beautiful, happy. I can find happiness too. I will heal. I need to stop being so harsh with myself. I need to forgive myself. I need to realize that this takes time, years even, but that it is okay. My life may be a disaster but even though these things that happened will never be erased or redone and will never get better, I am getting better at coping with them. It may not ever be okay but I will be okay.
They stood there face to face. John resolutely looking up at Sherlock. A thin layer of vibrating molecules between them.
He kicks off his shoes and walks down the hall. As he glances at the door on the left his arm reaches for the handle on the right. John sighs.
“Ha, yeah they’re gonna be pissed to have you back flaunting around and showing off and being all mysterious all the time,” John smirks. “But no, seriously. It’s going to change their worlds Sherlock. You changed my entire world today. Don’t you know that?”
you and the life I wanted to live. We had a nice house together, we were married, we had a baby, and yet she let me go on cases. Hell, she encouraged me to. It was the best of both worlds: I could live an ordinary life without feeling so
“He’s pissed at you- and he has every right to be- but he doesn’t hate you. He could never hate you.”
Their hearts begin to mirror one another, contracting, relaxing, expanding, and contracting once more in synchrony.
“Exactly! And I have a bum leg and you are in no shape to be making this climb either. You really couldn’t have chosen anywhere else to go? A bolthole on the ground floor perhaps?”
John's hand reflexively moved to his eyes as he turned his head away. "Jesus, Sherlock what are you-"
John grins. “Oh she definitely does. Isn’t that something? I think she’s the first one of my girlfriends that doesn’t want you dead.” He pauses. “Maybe that’s a sign that I made the right decision, ya know, that she’s the one.”
"Right, well then I better get back to Rosie. See you tomorrow." John pivoted towards the door and began walking.
“Welp, it looks like the only way to go is up,” John quips. His comment is not met with the expected snarky comment, however, but rather the sound of heavy breathing echoing through the staircase.
God, I'm horrible. My wife passed away and I'm already moving on and racing to be with someone else. Mary didn't deserve this. I don't deserve him.
You are the bravest, wisest, most human human-being I have ever known. I never was and never will be worthy of your friendship. You are brilliant. You inspire me to be my best. You taught me to be kind. You showed my how wonderful it is to have a friend. You brought me out of my isolation. You humble me. You made me believe that I am extraordinary rather than abnormal, brilliant rather than a freak. You’ve given me the confidence to grow, tear down my walls (as much as they will allow) and become human again. I haven’t felt this human, this alive, in so long and it is because of you, John Watson, that I am able to do so again. You have saved me so many times in so many ways. Living with you was the best time of my life. It was an honour to be your flatmate. To be your friend.
“You don’t have to be scared, Sherlock,” John whispered into the crook of Sherlock’s neck, and his warm breath sent shivers down the brunette’s spine, stirring his groin. “I’m sure our baby will be born perfectly healthy and utterly adorable. How could it not, with you as its father?”
“All right,” Sherlock says on a shaky breath.  He thinks for a small moment, and then says, “Arsenic.”
True to form, the blonde doctor only stared up at Lestrade through angry eyebrows and a stern jaw.  “And what about the other one?” he asked the detective inspector, crossing his arms over his chest.  “The one that Sherlock said got away?  What are you going to do about him?”
