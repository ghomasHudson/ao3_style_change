And John reacts.
Sherlock wants to salute. To burst into tears. To kiss him.
He doesn't care.
What happens is that John decides that Sherlock is amazing and extraordinary and fantastic and worth killing a man for.
He returns to 221B with takeaway, an apology, and a request to be allowed back in, and stays stubbornly on the sidewalk like some overcautious vampire until Mrs. Hudson manages to henpeck her tenant downstairs. Sherlock accepts the boxes of food and leaves the door open as he swans back to the first floor. When John cautiously follows, he's given a choice of beer or tea, and rather ungraciously told to text Sherlock Dr. Hughes's number if he must. An olive branch is still an olive branch even if it's missing some leaves from being thrown in one's face, and John is smart enough to be satisfied with the peace offering, such as it is.
"If it was all up to me then why would I even need to come here?!"
Thank you to everyone for your patience, and especially to everyone who sent me kind words of encouragement as I struggled with this chapter. I re-read and re-arranged and re-wrote this chapter so often that I've lost all objectivity toward it (if indeed, I ever had any to begin with when it comes to my own writing) and have no idea whether it's better or worse than before. But it is finished, at least, and I'm going to call that a win. Thank you again for sticking with me.
He got Sherlock to sit, and then forced him to  drink two glasses of water; partly to occupy his esophagus with something other than sobs and gasps, and half to give  himself a few minutes in which to process.
But John is always there, nearly constantly in contact as he instructs and guides. Calloused hands adjust Sherlock's limbs, steady his hips, and modify his stances. Sherlock strains to maintain poses for as long  as he can for the sole purpose of not losing contact with the warm palm cupping his elbow or the fingertips pressing into the small of his back, and is rewarded for his efforts with kisses dropped to the nearest bit of skin; cheek, bicep, shoulderblade. Once in a while, his stomach.
"I have never in my life been
“Even when I make you go all shouty and frowny?” Sherlock asks wistfully.
And accuracy.
When Sherlock finds out that his microscope is located in the brand new mini laboratory built out in 221C, complete with a refrigerator, freezer, incubator, autoclave, and plenty of filtration and ventilation, he nearly dances out of his own skin with glee. Even John's comment of "Mycroft's idea, actually" does nothing toward dampening his enthusiasm.
"That's not..." John begins, then seems to falter into a confused silence as well. "I just meant, well, how do you feel? Asking as your friend, not your doctor."
1. Kiss me
"It's been...good," Sherlock continues, trying to form his feelings into thoughts. "With just the two of us." And he doesn't want to lose it, or even lose sight of it. Dilute it, or diminish it in any way. He wants some parts of his old life back, certainly, but by no means all of it. Not the loneliness he can now admit to, or the jealousy and the fears he'd refused to acknowledge.
“Tell me,” he whispered.
John winces at how rapidly this nothing situation has escalated into a potential MI5 action (because Sherlock has revealed what background checks could not, which is that Mycroft is the creepy shadow behind the throne) and texts back before Big Brother can put a kill order out on him. Seconds later, he's ringing his assistant and telling him to send 'round the car immediately, and have a big cheerful bouquet waiting in it, plus one of those fancy tea hampers from Fortnum & Mason. Sherlock may turn up his nose at gifts, but Mrs. Hudson will hopefully be open to bribery, provided it's blatant enough.
102. Show me all of your ticklish spots, if any. Or better yet, let me find them for myself.
“I  love you,” John grates out, all gravelly from sleep and his heart  having dislodged from its usual location and getting stuck in his  throat. “I love you, and you are
John finishes off the grooming session by seating Sherlock on the toilet for another quick shave with the electric razor. And then, with all the confidence of a man with naturally straight hair always kept short, he gives Sherlock a thorough blow-dry and brushing out. John's expression is confused and alarmed when he steps back to survey the ruination, and soon both men are snickering.
...because of Sherlock, or at least his own attachment to Sherlock.
“Guessing these aren’t happy  tears?” he joked, patting awkwardly at a tricep. Watery eyes blinked  rapidly, knocking yet more tears loose, then fixed on him, wide like  they were surprised to find him there.
John is carefully poring over his handful of petals, turning a few intact flowers over with one careful finger.

“Mycroft showed up just as you were wheeled into surgery. He gave me a file and power of attorney over you. I gave him a black eye.”
John might be shoved out an actual window.
Sherlock hurries, careful when he's not thinking and sloppy when he remembers that they're all dead now. He takes a cab to save his body from being jostled on the tube, and slips in through the kitchens of the Landmark to avoid any unpleasantries about his lack of reservation.
And so they fall into a new routine, unmarred by any (real) bickering, not soured by any (sustained) complaints of boredom. John moves into physical therapist mode, becomes a devout student of massage therapy and exercise routines specific to injury recovery, and playfully announces "enrichment time!" whenever he chivvies Sherlock out of bed or his seat to do careful laps around the flat or an hour of yoga in the living room. If Sherlock is feeling particularly unmotivated to move, the enrichment team is treated to a few growls or hisses, or perhaps a quick swipe of one paw.
He's maybe made some undignified noise, because the couch shakes with how hard John is trying not to laugh aloud.
,  Sherlock fell straight down between one breath and the next, down to  his knees and with John’s palms catching at elbow and forearm, gentling  him the remainder of the way, bringing him to rest between John’s legs,  staring breathlessly up and repeating his request with beseeching gaze  because his voice had failed at the same time as his legs.
) as anything but his attending physician. Unfortunately his - apparently obvious - pause of surprise deepens the little wrinkle between John's brows.

"Tell me about her?" he asks quietly, and watches, and waits.
And men like your brother fear what they cannot control.
"And Sherringford..."
“What…what  do you need right now?” Sherlock asked, struggling in too many ways to  settle on one and try to sort it out. The unfamiliar sight of John,  stoic soldier John, crumpled into the corner of the couch and visibly  struggling not to weep was by itself enough to put the self-proclaimed  sociopath into a flutter. Add to this the impulse to both flee the  emotional scene and throw himself at John in a childish desire to give  comfort, plus the immobilizing terror of doing exactly the wrong thing,  and Sherlock was experiencing the entire array of fight, flight, freeze,  and fawn responses.

And then blinked, frowned, and pouted.
He has to refuel and recharge with utmost efficiency.

By some miracle, his mobile was still in one hand rather than having been thrown at his flatmate’s insufferable face, and he opened up the Contacts app to look for his current girlfriend’s number.
“Tyrant,” Sherlock grumbles, but he begins crawling out of his cocoon and sneaks in a grateful headbutt against John’s shoulder as he does.
John unwittingly provides him a hiding place in which to recover, the both of them happy to indulge in mutual comfort after the stark review of the two years they'd spent apart. A quick hand clasp turns into a rough grab at his shoulder, and then John pulls him into a sideways embrace despite big brother looking on. Sherlock noses along a shirt-collar and breathes in washing powder and shower gel, warmth and safety, and sighs gratitude into the crook of John's neck.
Sherlock sits back with a sigh and surveys the messy sprawl of notecards with tired, slightly sweaty satisfaction. He hasn't moved from the couch but it was still exertion of a sort, and he's not exactly in top form. Take it all in all, his note feels more solid than not, however, especially given the fact that this is his first foray as an adult into uttermost honesty and emotional vulnerability. He's congratulating himself quite heartily on this bold essay into uncharted territory when the muted snap of a laptop being shut startles him out of his reverie.
In the early stages of recovering his health, Sherlock finds it easy to revel in gratitude and nostalgia. Keeping himself from attempting to see too far into the future and along the many paths of possibility is not too difficult a task, especially when he keeps his short term goals in mind; get well and have A Talk with John. Anxiety is not conducive to any aspect of his health, nor will it keep John amiable. First things first, and he can worry about all the rest when he has the strength to deal with the consequences, whatever they may be.
"Nor my moustache?"
“John!”
John ignores his protest.
It was  heady, it was dizzying, it made John feel powerful,  humble, eternal, and small all at the same time, to have Sherlock so  focused on him. All of his being distilled down to this one want,  waiting for this gift that John wanted to bestow.
"What you need is to grow up," Mrs. Hudson declares. "However you've lived, it's made you into the man you are now; well and good...or perhaps not, but that's neither here nor there. But you're well into your adulthood and you're being told flat out that you're not marriage material--"

"Mycroft," John murmurs, and makes no protests as Sherlock leaves his corner. The gun stays ready, however, and John remains standing with his body angled, presenting less of a target to the doorway.
NB: Results still favorable if jam or marmalade eaten instead of honey. Jaffa Cakes, Jammie Dodgers, and other sandwich biscuits also acceptable, but only for closed-mouth kisses. Snowballing crumb paste is not sexy.
, since you can’t even be arsed to remember his name.”
The serious part of the meeting seems to be over, and the conversation continues in this vein; John and Sherlock indulging in silliness while Mycroft acts the part of dour chaperone, subtly egging them on. The quick spikes of anger and offense from a few minutes before make the descent into childish antics all the sweeter, and Sherlock finds himself giggling freely, uncaring of any mental movies his older brother may be recording. Though despite the shenanigans, they do in fact manage to come up with a workable plan for revealing Sherlock's resurrection to their chosen few.
Damn it.
73.	And your chest
But while phrases such as "thank you for being so protective of me, and the heart that we have both acknowledged that I have" and "I appreciate the way in which you wish to shield me from even relatively harmless sorts of harm" are clear and comparatively concise, they're terribly awkward to actually put out there in audible syllables. Even reborn, Sherlock is still British, and there are limits to how much honest emoting he can do on any given day.
But in this AU, John is the one left off of Moriarty's hit list as (incorrectly) unimportant, and is the one to secretly back the detective up.
Sherlock hesitates, second-guesses himself, then forges on.
The house sells at far above the asking price, after two buyers get into a rather heated bidding war. John signs papers and shakes Dr. Verner's hand, and doesn't find out that he's just met Sherlock's third cousin until several years later.
A bit of clanging and cursing draws his attention to the doorway, and when John reappears, he stops a moment and then chuckles.
John says some unflattering things about her while she finishes the online referral form, glares silently when she picks up the phone to persuade "Marcus darling" to squeeze a new patient in, and slams her office door on his way out. He's irritated with himself all the way home, because he knows damn well that he's one set of crossed arms away from being a perfect caricature of a five year old throwing a tantrum.
“I can always tell when you’re lying.”
“Met someone about a month ago.”

“Yes!” Sherlock nods eagerly, happy that John has thought ahead to the proper conclusions. “The alcohol industry will stop at
"Surely you can understand our reasoning, Doctor Watson. Revealing the fact that you were sheltering with him at Baker Street during his recovery establishes a precedent that may prove dangerous should Sherlock ever--"
"No? How about the extensor muscle groups?"
The reassurance seems to fall quite flat, unfortunately. Sorrow gives way to an outright grimace.

He takes over the second bedroom so he's got a place to put his clothes and desk, but replaces the cramped bed with an indulgently squashy loveseat, cheap coffee table, and expensive flatscreen telly. They work and snog and eventually start shagging all over the flat, John spends every night in Sherlock's bed unless he's out chasing said madman all around London, and when he feels like he should call Dr. Hughes or simply needs a bit of quiet, he goes upstairs and locks the door.
“How  was that?” he asked, settling smoothly into his  I-am-about-to-be-given-a-right-good-bollocking-by-a-superior-officer  face. His body had automatically shifted into parade rest as well, and  he had to struggle not to fidget awkwardly out of it as Sherlock stared  at him.
“I’m no good at this, I know. No one  thinks I’m aware, or that I care; I know even you have your moments.  Brave, loyal, honorable John. You’ll defend me against the world, but  sometimes I can see you looking at me with doubt and even fear. But I’m  aware of my shortcomings. I can’t be everything, John, surely you can  see that?”
touching! Be
The first text comes a few hours later.
"A bit? Actually, yes," he answers in some surprise, then crinkles his eyebrows together at John. And? What of it? Are you not going to read my cards?
Seconds tick by, and he doesn't bound outside, crying out for John to come along, to hurry, to keep up. Two years in purgatory and two months in paradise, and suddenly he's faced with an unguarded door through which to walk, and an unexpected uncertainty about what awaits him on the other side.

The opening sequence of the movie has the consulting detective questioning the wisdom of the choice. The titular character falls and falls and falls through the air to his supposed death, leaving behind a colleague who blames themself for the tragedy, but John's reaction is no worse than a hitch in his breathing and a soft sigh. One hand sneaks over to lightly curl around Sherlock's wrist, fingers resting over a quickening pulse. The sight enchants Sherlock for a good half hour, at the end of which he is slumped down and sliding over and snoozing away on John's shoulder, and all in all it's the quietest he's ever been during a Bond night.
"Not very. This tea will keep me satisfied for now, and I'm more likely to need a nap than a snack afterwards. Reluctant as I am to admit it, that shower exhausted me."
"Oh. That makes sense."
Almost everyone has roots. Those without even that bare minimum requirement tend to end up with various ICD-10 codes slapped on to them like safety labels. Beyond that, there are no hard and fast rules that a person's bloom must abide by.
A single bud snaps off in his hand.
John storms out.
"You're welcome to try now," Sherlock suggests, not quite confident enough to try adding bedroom eyes or dropping his voice to a more seductive register. He's shammed it before for cases, but it is an entirely different endeavor when one adds real emotion to the mix. That he is brave enough to flirt at all, even, is only thanks to John proving over and again that his self-control is enough to keep desire in check.
(You're my doctor. I'm your patient. I have to do exactly as you say or you'll give me to Mycroft. Those are the terms under which you and I operate for now, and until I know more I don't dare test the borders.)
"Amazing?" John suggested.
“Um…”
"Sherlock," John replies patiently, some amusement even tugging at the corners of his mouth. "I've been keeping you all to myself for weeks now, and I haven't made a single attempt to let any of our friends know that you're alive. If I were them I'd knock me flat."
The personal return on investments is also a matter of joy to him. They've only exchanged a few kisses thus far, despite the many nights spent together. It was all too surreal and strained, and stress-relief sex not worth lowering their guard for. They are broken and dysfunctional and both men probably need a lifetime of therapy but that doesn't mean they aren't eminently suited for each other. John and Sherlock have been tried and tested, proven true to each other, and miracle of miracles, have talked things out and come to an agreement; they are together.
“Oh,” Sherlock breathes, and the way John visibly snaps to full-body attention without actually moving would be absolutely riveting, except that the consulting detective and amateur scientist is a little too caught up in his error to pay much mind.
-  he was left to offer intimacies on his own terms and timing. Mostly it  was letting himself give in to all the little impulses he’d been  strangling down prior to being given carte blanche on expressions of  affection; touching Sherlock every time they neared each other, dropping  little kisses good morning and good night and to mark all the moments  of eye contact in between, and cuddling Sherlock into a halfway decent  sleep schedule once the detective began invading his bed.
"While you were in hospital I told Mycroft that I wanted to see your recovery through at Baker Street, and told him to take care of it. I didn't really bother myself with any of the details," John muses. "He put up a bit of a fuss about the location, but I think it was more a token protest. Either that or he realized how set I was on the idea and didn't want to have to black bag me for hitting him a second time."
120. Just...sex. I would like all the sex things, please. I would like you to like doing them with me. Show me all of it. Show me all of you.
And  on a less altruistic note, there was a goodly bit of his brain that was  jumping up and down and hollering gleefully at an opportunity to share  in
His face did something, apparently, because Sherlock eyed him sharply, then jumped up and stalked off to the kitchen table.
John seems to have some requests of his own to be fulfilled. A great many, in fact, if the quantity of...stuff...he has ordered is any indication. Sherlock opens two other boxes, lighter than the first though not much smaller in dimension.
“...you want to know if you’ve been missing out.”
“Okay!”
"You're a little peaky," John notes, showing some unfortunately timed talent for observation. "Dunno if it's fatigue or nerves, but how about we have some dinner and watch a movie until you're ready to go back to bed, and then I'll read these while you're sleeping."
“I love you so so so much John,” he says earnestly, in order to relieve a little of the pressure.
Mycroft sees through this, of course. But equally predictably, says nothing directly about it.
1.	Kiss me
“Yeah.”
Sherlock smiles and shakes his head, perfectly content to stay in this little cocoon.
(Smiles. Laughter. Hugs.)
Loved, wanted, worthy.
John's eyelids squinch down, hard, like he's fighting off a bright light or sudden headache. Pale hands find their way almost automatically to the man's temples, smoothing back hair too short to need such a gesture, trying to soothe away whatever is hurting him. The contact eases Sherlock too, helps keep new fears from forming over whatever John wishes to confess, and he tentatively curls his hands 'round John's neck to anchor himself.
Instead of answering, Sherlock shakes loose everything he can and quickly scrapes up the little white stars, transferring them to John's palm.
"I've had this thought before, but put it aside as unfounded. But then tonight...well."
"I'm a doctor. What's the--
A laptop, three burner phones, broad-spectrum antibiotics.
eventually too. So, two birds and one stone and all that."
“What  would you say are your favorite activities to engage in, as they relate  to the intimacy aspect of a romantic relationship?“
"Guess I'm your enrichment team, then? Any...I dunno, feedback or suggestions? Questions, concerns?"
I'm deliberately treating John's staff - apart from Greg - like we're in a Jane Austen novel; they're there but not characters in their own right. When the main characters need them, they're suddenly there, and the implication is that they're always there and only mentioned when necessary, like furniture and the weather. It's a reflection of how John sees them (or rather, doesn't see them). Tom, Colin, and Dan get names because John is emotionally invested in them, but his personal chef is just "the kitchen".

But of course, resuming his suicide mission isn't exactly an act calculated to increase the man's happiness, and
Delicious. Desirable. Like a caramel petit-four iced with cocaine fondant and served on a folder containing conclusive proof to back up Sherlock's theory that Jack the Ripper was a midwife, not a madman.
As I read through the file that Mycroft gave me, my feelings of betrayal changed to understanding and regret and gratitude. I still wish that you could have found a way to take me along so that I could have helped you, or that you'd at least read me into your plan so that I could have been spared some of the pain, but I understand your reasons for doing what you did. It is what it is, and I can accept it now.
“Should I call someone, then? Lestrade, or Stamford, perhaps an old Army mate?”

He considers buying a flea comb to help rake all the little white blossoms out of his hair.
Sherlock finds that he needs a moment to re-orient his mindset. He's been two years away and then for several weeks, either unconscious or trying very hard not to think of John (John John

wining and dining, or are you also wooing and doing?”
One of John's last acts as CEO is to order Greg Lestrade to personally pick him up from the airport after a last minute trip to Germany. The head of security waits at the gate with "WATSON" neatly printed on cardstock because appearances matter, and the fact that he and John know what the other looks like doesn't. When John walks out of the aerobridge knocking shoulders and laughing with Sherlock Holmes, Greg doesn't drop the sign, because he is a god damned professional, but it's a near thing. Once the soon to be ex-CEO slides into the back seat of the company car, however, Greg reaches in after him, punches the man on the shoulder, and declares that he's owed an explanation and some more Glenfiddich. He gets a rude gesture and a recommendation that he fuck off, but as his boss is still grinning, Greg is pretty sure he won't be fired.
Unfortunately, John hadn’t held on quite as tightly to
“How long do we have?”
"The night I returned," he says, quiet and calm. A soft touch seems appropriate for the late hour and tender topic. "I found you at The Landmark. Table for two, you hadn't ordered yet, not even wine. A bottle blonde in a lavender silk gown, beadwork in a leaf pattern. Earrings to go with the dress, but a ring she wore every day. Easy, confident, not a first date by any means. But you were tense, nervous; this was a special occasion of which the outcome was uncertain, not a celebration. And you had a small jewelry box in the inner pocket of your coat."
“Jesus, Sherlock,
"Oh..."
John's eyebrows knit together a bit, and Sherlock realizes he's used some rather unflattering adjectives there, and that is probably A Bit Not Good when one is discussing romantic love with the person that one is in romantic love with.
"Sorry," Sherlock offers, but John interrupts with a shush and some reinforcing cuddling. He props his head up a bit with the hand he doesn't have firmly wrapped around Sherlock's torso. No one has any right to look attractive from this angle, with extra chins and a bit of sleep crusted in the corner of their left eye, but Sherlock is near to overwhelmed by how lovely every tiny detail of the man is.
"Our first dinner at Angelo's. I

The trembling in his tum gets markedly worse, and Sherlock isn't sure if he's feeling more afraid and unsure, or if this is a herald of an oncoming loss of control; of impulsively deciding to throw self-control, dignity, and everything else separating man from goldfish to the wind. What he means to

After exhausting the past, they cautiously begin exploring the future.
"It's not a verb, John," Sherlock chides, but while he's trying to wave the compliment off, his cheeks prickle with a pleased flush and he cannot keep his mouth from twisting up into a smile.
(Don't rush, don't ruin this, don't be stupid and selfish and so
“Flip over and scoot  down,” he commanded, nudging John with one knee while he pecked away at  the remote. He saw John uncurl a bit and peer up at him, but kept his  gaze locked on to the television.
"I'm not Dr. Dunaway. I'm not going to take your money forever just to watch you work on your frown lines."
There is an exaggerated eye roll and sigh from across the table at the valuable minutes being wasted on this impromptu food fight strategy session, but Sherlock recognizes it for what it is; Mycroft's best efforts at contributing to the fun.
They have an extended snuggle session that turns into a light doze, and are startled into wakefulness and giggles by someone's stomach giving a startlingly loud growl. They both deny ownership of the noise but agree that preparing and then eating lunch together would be an acceptable passtime, and then begin unfolding themselves from the chair.

His duties as High Priest at the temple will include a lot of self-flagellation.
Sherlock is hunting and being hunted, and in all the world, John is his only bolthole. The dead man slips from one disguise to another, a harried university student in plain sight one day and a jaded sex worker lurking in shadows the next, living on caffeine and nicotine and quick bites that won't require too much bloodflow to digest, sometimes sleeping but never, ever resting. Not unless there is someone he trusts to watch over him.
John will gleefully commit all sorts of crimes, but he is still an honorable man. He may not always behave in accordance with the law, but he consistently acts in defense of what is
Sherlock stared at the  laxative commercial currently on-screen as if solving a locked-vault  quintuple murder depended on it. The silence from his couchmate was  unnerving, but soon enough John snorted and settled against his  shoulder.
“Okay! Pearl Garden or Wong’s?”

“Do it again. I wasn’t paying attention.”
“He thinks that I need some excitement in my life.” The executive huffs in amusement. “So it’s been a few weeks now, of offering to take him to Italy or Japan for a weekend and instead eating Chinese takeaway at his flat while he rants about how unimaginative criminals are, or getting dragged down dark alleys by the hand like a little kid so we can watch for a burglar or blackmailer or whatever. The turnover rate in my security detail’s giving HR the fits.”
"Dinner?" Sherlock asks, impishly, impulsively.
, and perhaps more importantly, unheralded by any alarming commotion. Even if the security team had somehow been neutralized before being able to shout or shoot - highly improbable, with one of them having had time to send off a signal to John - there would have been thuds as their bodies hit the floor. Sherlock uncurls and unclenches, rising to his feet even as John glances over and nods.

The sun is blotted out, snow slaps and stings at his exposed skin, a shrieking wind blinds and deafens him, and he is left grasping frantically for something, anything that makes sense amidst this unexpected turn of events.

A couple of months down the road, the now-five person crew actually wins one of the races they enter as a team, and John brings them all to the villa on Hampstead Lane to celebrate by breaking into his liquor cabinet and splashing about in his pool. There's the expected wide-eyed, slack-jawed boggling when they realize
It's so simple and obvious, now that John's put it into words. Is this how John feels, when Sherlock explains the observations and reasonings that lead him from the pink hydrangeas behind a Devon property to the buried body of the real estate agent's mistress? Perhaps Sherlock ought to be a bit more gracious when detailing his deductions.
John hums again, a delightfully soothing and contented sound that Sherlock can feel in his skull and fingertips and just to the left of his sternum.
Sherlock utters a noise that was meant to be a succinct interrogative phrase but ends up sounding more like a three inch tall goose honking. It makes a wisp of a smile appear on John's face, so, not a complete loss.

"I have an excellent doctor." Sherlock sets aside his ill humor for now in favor of giving John an appreciative peck. He has not forgotten his mission; to live up to John's belief in Sherlock, of having a great heart and brilliant mind, of deserving the honor of being John's best friend and the most important person in his life.
You see, you frighten her, whereas I see myself in you. That's why you're reading this letter, instead of negotiating with me for Kate's freedom. Yes, Kate's, because I love her more than I do myself. She wouldn't beg for mine; instead she'd threaten to do absolutely dreadful things to you and your brother and dour old England if you were to hurt even one hair on my head. But tell Mycroft not to worry; I have accepted a job with the DGSI and a proposal from Kate and am very happy. Happy enough to let bygones be bygones, in fact. So long as we are left alone we will have no cause to dig up old grudges.
"Of course you are dear, all children are," Mrs. Hudson says placidly, and this makes the executive sputter.
"Yes?"
, but his own Glock is safetied and slipped behind a cushion. When this relaxing of defensive measures brings no protest from the soldier standing guard, he floomphs down onto the sofa and arranges himself into the best languid lounge he can manage in the few seconds he has left. There is an eloquent snort from before him.
Several times since that night at the gallery, Sherlock has found himself wondering at the speed and ease with which they've become friends. Or as close to friends as two such broken men can ever become. Their jagged edges are cracked in just the right shapes to fit fairly well together. It's good, what they have right now. John is busy with work and Sherlock is busy with The Work. They spend enough time apart that they're generally happy to see each other when they can, and if tempers flare, there's nothing stopping John from storming out before the sparks can lead to scorched earth.
"I would like some of my infinite kisses now, please."
(See the end of the chapter for
Mycroft has not suffered in the same way and to similar extent as John and Sherlock, but...
"After everything, is it really so unbelievable that there are no lengths to which I will not go, or sacrifices that I will not make, for the sake of your happiness?"
"In that case, I'm sorry John, but I can't help you."
, he may never be. How does one
"Hm, shall I read to you out of my old textbooks, then?" John snickers. "Take you on a fascinating tour of the carpals?"
Today, John spends a bit longer than usual examining the scars once they're exposed to warm air and lamplight. Sherlock closes his eyes and tracks the gentle, probing presses circling the freshest scar tissue. The fingers seem to be tracing and testing each and every millimeter of damaged skin tonight. Sherlock is pleased to note that there's none of the swollen soreness of an infected wound, and that John's fingers feel warm instead of comparatively cool the way they would against feverish flesh.
“Er...top three, or all I  can think of?” John asked, curiosity engaged as to what sort of case the  consulting detective was considering taking on.
"And on that note, good afternoon, gentlemen," Mycroft abruptly announces, gathering his brolly and briefcase and dignity about him as he stands.
19. And scones (lots of scones)
“Fine!”
...there’s where I should have tapped out’.”
“Oh.”
Another point occurs to him.
"Mm?" he queries, peering at John through his drooped-down lashes while slowly luxuriating in the fact that his food has
(Or pharmaceutical, but John does not Do That.)
“Yes!”
I dearly wanted to insert wordplay about Irene going in "naked" which in spy novel parlance means that an agent operates without any cover story or back-up in place as a wee nod to BBC's "A Scandal in Belgravia", but I couldn't quite figure it out. Alackaday.
Eleanor refuses to help him.
It's a look that makes him want to straighten up, throw his shoulders back, and smooth any wrinkles out of his vest. He settles for gingerly sitting forward from his squashed pillow nest and clearing his throat.
“John,  I–” Shaky, shaken, barely held together. John was unable bear to hear  Sherlock Fucking Holmes reduced to such wet-kitten vulnerability, and  him the proximate cause.
Details whirl around him and Sherlock can actually hear the rustle-roar of them for once, like leaves tossed in the wind. His eyes take in the sight of John's hair and shoulders and suit and gestures and knees and tapping left shoe. There's a woman seated across from him but she's only a blur; all Sherlock can focus on is the ring box in John's jacket pocket, interior, right side.
"The instant you came back, it was like I couldn't see her anymore. I forgot she
Sherlock breathes out, simultaneously discovering that he'd been holding his breath as well as holding himself in readiness for...something. But John's pottering away happily in the kitchen now, humming and clattering about and most importantly not pinning Sherlock in place with a fond, steady, seeking gaze. Released and relaxing, Sherlock sighs and sinks back into the cushions, and in similar fashion his mind drifts down through layers of memories newly made.
20.	Dip your finger into some boysenberry jam and bring it to my mouth
They quietly putter about after lunch, not joined at the hip but hardly ever more than ten feet apart. Sherlock rifles through an accumulation of newspapers for interesting morsels, and John taps away at his phone. And as is part of their new routine, as soon as one or the other of them grows restless with their forcedly subdued, sedentary, and confined lifestyle, they draw near and begin angling for contact. Intimacy is a beautiful cure for boredom.
2. Kiss me again, with your head tilted the other way
.) "Thinking back to my reaction to that first cup of broth you gave me, I believe I'll proceed with caution. I've been daydreaming of a well-fried egg, in point of fact, with just a bit of salt sprinkled over the whites."
(Please come home. Please
your job!" exclaims John, ratcheting right back up to exasperated.
9.	Hug me from behind and nip at my neck
57.	Rub lotion into my hands
Trying to control and compartmentalize his thoughts keeps him too busy for proper strops, in any case. Like some nightmares tend to do, the mental images of John in peril dig claws into him, and will not be easily brushed aside.
“Trust,” he answered after a moment of thought.
There’s a pause, long enough to make him wonder if the person has left, and then another caress and a soft,
“The neuralizers, John! They’ll nebulize every date rape drug, but when mixed together and then drinked all together, they act like a drug too. Like a…a…sheep in wolf’s wool. But I’m a genius, so there’s hardly any ill effects! It’s a clean, non-addictive high, John! I’m
Only in the literal sense, of course, what with Sherlock's still shaky state of health and John's insistence upon a glacial pace when it comes to advancing in their physical intimacies. Sherlock had pouted a bit when John had trotted
(Best not to theorize in advance of all the data.)
Sherlock's unruly brain occasionally attempts to suggest a tangled theory of mistrust and doubt involving John's desire to have an escape route clear of Mycroft's security detail available before he takes things any further. Each time the thought pops up, it is mentally stamped on, ground down, and kicked away. Sherlock is determined not to ruin this almost surreal honeymoon period granted to them with his insecurities.

DGSI = Direction générale de la sécurité intérieure. It is France's equivalent to the UK's MI5, or the US's FBI.
He is the man who has everything, and he’d had nothing to live for.
221B bustles around Sherlock like a busy hive, with him the solitary, stationary queen.
Watson prefers Mozart to Brahms, and puffed rice crackers to yogurt melties. Scrapbooks start filling the bookcases.
“Sorry, sweetheart,” he murmured into silky-soft fabric. “You just caught me off guard, is all. I’m not unwilling.”
There are more anecdotes about early interactions as the two men clear the table and do the washing up; Mary laughing at John over a paper cup of admittedly terrible office coffee, Mary introducing John to different sandwich shops and making him try all her favorites, Mary challenging John to find her a satisfactory Massaman in return for discovering that he does in fact like miso egg yolk aioli on chicken and cheese toasties.
Sherlock Holmes
John peeked out from under his  forearm. He seemed to be frowning again, though it was difficult to tell  without a better view of his eyebrows.
Even righteously angry John or deeply disappointed John (well, maybe) is preferable to impersonal John.
He stammers out an apology and attempts to explain how unprepared he was for John's confession, and thus how stunned, how shocked, how staggered. And these are still not very positive words, so he hastily tacks on that it's with
Because yes, now John sleeps with him.
John seems to be able to focus so well on a single good that he is blinded to any faults scattered around it. Despite awkwardly rebuffed flirtations and cut-off explanations and not half-eaten plates, John clutches his useless cane and declares a willingness to go back to Angelo's, and soon. And despite Donovan and Anderson and Mycroft, John bats away the rapidly unfurling bloom now crowding into his field of vision, grins up at Sherlock, and takes the room upstairs.
)  and getting ready to catch in case a complete collapse was imminent.  They thankfully stayed upright and John - never the Idea Man in the  first place - fell back on awkward humor now that he found himself  knee-deep in unexpected emotion.
101. Let me undress you completely, and don't get irritated when I take my time about it
They talk about everything they've been avoiding talking about, as if that one bout of tears had washed away all John's reticence. The two years away, and the night Sherlock returned. Moriarty and Mary and Magnussen. Geoffrey and Eurus.
Greg attempts to talk to John about it, but only manages a few words before getting reamed for his presumption. At the next mud run, he tells Colin, Tom, and Dan that it's the busy season at work when they ask where Watson's hiding his fine self. They grumble good-naturedly and melt easily back into their former four man configuration.
Later, when phones are unlocked and files are closed and they are finally alone again, he presses for an explanation.
, Sherlock, and then you apparently decided that the best way to come back from the dead was to interrupt one of my dates as if you’d only been gone two hours. Not to mention you were held together with not much more than willpower and some manky catgut, and half out of your mind with a fever.”
"You were so-- you
Happily, some of the prescribed therapies and soothing treatments are already well under way. They are together again, as close as they ever were before, and even closer now with all the intimacy of confessions and conversations and cuddles.
99. Frotting up against the wall, but this time with me draped over you. Oh...this has potential.
“One of these is only alcohol, and I managed to re-engineer most of the others to have very mild side effects, so mathematically speaking–”
“Fuck’s sake Sherlock, I wouldn’t be going on dates if
They start simply, after some protests from the patient.
He refocuses on anxious eyes, imbibing some of that emotion for himself.
"I do have to," Sherlock insists. "I even wrote it down. I..."
“Beautiful,” he murmured, as Sherlock lowered his bow and breathed out a heavy, satisfied sigh.
Sherlock weeps with all the abandon of a small child, pouring out pent up emotion at full bore until finally, finally the flood dwindles to a trickle and then to little drips, and he is utterly emptied out. He sighs and hiccups and shudders in John's arms, goes limp, and falls asleep so quickly it's like a gentle faint.
More than he'd dreamed of ever having again, in fact.
John keeps the Hampstead Lane location as a combination storage unit, not-so-secret back-up bolthole, and a sort of exclusive club for Greg and the lads, with whom he re-integrates himself and eventually introduces Sherlock to. Colin, Tom, and Dan are all very sad for Greg that John has a new sugar baby who is pretty and posh and wears ridiculously fitted shirts. Sherlock preens under the combined attentions of five fit men, and refrains from deducing anything unpleasant about them.
Sherlock is less cooperative, for one. The consulting detective seems to want to slip right back into the life he'd abandoned over a year ago, as if his time as a fugitive and felon had been nothing more than another one of his disguises, easily slipped off once he's done with it. Everyone around them relies on Sherlock's personal account of his time away and accepts his reassurances that he's only lost a bit of ground due to a nasty fever, but John was there; if not on scene, at least for some of the aftermath.
It comes on him like a realization at a crime scene or while poring over a case file; the puzzle pieces suddenly
In BBC Sherlock, Mycroft and Molly would have been risking their safety, careers, and reputations to assist Sherlock, and so in this AU, John puts the same things on the line. And he's utterly devoted and faithful, too. The women John supposedly shags in back rooms and the men John supposedly pays to blow him in the back of his sedan are all Sherlock in disguise, using the cover of casual sex to interact with John without raising suspicion in anyone who might be watching, whether it's John's men or Moriarty's. He may be a bit immature when it comes to communicating emotions, but he is a soldier and a c-suite executive; he is the best of the best when it comes to keeping secrets, staying calm under fire, focusing on objectives to the exclusion of all else, and all the other things Sherlock needs in a partner for a deep cover long term operation.
to me.”
The feedback loop discovered during their first few kisses is still going strong. When John gives Sherlock anything more than a chaste, closed-mouth peck, there is a one hundred percent chance of Sherlock breaking out into full body goosebumps. Any additional nibbly kisses delivered before the shivers have time to fade triggers a cascade effect eventually resulting in a somewhat embarrassing but delicious loss of control. Sherlock squirms, clutches blindly, and buries his face in John's neck, whines, whimpers needily, and gasps out all the air in his lungs.
“What?”
"Sorry Sir. At last check-in, he was reported to be - and I quote - 'geeking out over the skeletons in the catacombs.' The report is that it's just a personal field trip and not related to the case he's been working on, which okay, I can see it. But I've got a feeling it's something more, so I'm pestering Holmes the elder for details. If I disappear, please let my kids know I love them."
3. He is afraid.
Sherlock sips and considers.
54. Wash my hair
A nuzzle and kiss to his neck yanks his attention away from the movie that he isn't really watching, and then John is carefully rearranging the both of them. There's a quiet "c'mere" and a great deal of squirming and swearing and blanket-tugging before John is satisfied, but at long last they are supine. Sherlock's cards are once again on the coffee table, the blanket is deemed superfluous and relegated to the floor, John is draped a la Sherlock along the seat cushions, and Sherlock is wedged between John and the back of the couch and happy to be so.
“I am anything but fine in this situation,”  Sherlock replied with some scorn, but was interrupted before he could  get into any explanation or exposition.
The retelling of John and Mary's short-lived romance is hardly begun, never mind finished, and certainly not to the satisfaction of Sherlock's curiosity.
They cling to each other, John like he's been waiting all his life for this and Sherlock like he'll die if he lets go. They rock together, or perhaps they're rocking each other, trying to impart comfort and understanding and let their bodies speak to each other now that their voices have failed. They both make unconscious little shifts and adjustments until John's managed to burrow halfway under the rumpled pile of blankets and pillows, and Sherlock is able to wriggle one foot free and hook it around the first ankle he comes across. John murmurs unintelligibly and Sherlock cries into his shoulder.
They'd ended up against a wall, then another wall, and then in bed.
"Feel up to taking a shower?"
And Sherlock talks. He's famous for his taciturnity among those few who know him and his sulks are the stuff of legend, yet he makes an effort to draw John out, to rile him up, and to make him think. Their conversations are more like arguments than chat, with Sherlock challenging John's ways (or lack) of thinking and also using the man as a sounding board for puzzling out his own tangled thoughts. For all the frowns and curses and shouting, it's more bracing than bruising. John keeps coming back for more with that cocky grin of his, and in between visits, Sherlock finds himself looking around for those sharp blue eyes, somehow always already pinned on him, except when they're absent.
(Additional research item: widely accepted standard quota for first kisses.)
–and then you are going to pass back out. When you wake up, we’ll see if you can handle some broth, and then we’ll start your recovery in earnest. We can talk more after you’re stronger.”
The examination ends, and Sherlock raises his eyebrows when instead of applying fresh gel sheets, John instead holds gauze pads against his skin, and rather than affixing them with medical tape, overlaps squares of protective film over them, as if there were rows of intravenous catheters on Sherlock's back.
DVD Commentary: Marcus Hughes is my omc from "A Doctor in the House". He's not really based on anyone; I just wanted to add another "MH" to the BBC Sherlock mix. XD
"And how do your talents intersect with his interests?" Mycroft continues, prompting an impatient sigh from his younger brother. As if Sherlock is so dim-witted that he'd fall prey to someone - other than Mycroft - wishing to use him for his knowledge or connections.
thrown at me for my ability to get tables - but that I was welcome to join him at a crime scene instead, if I promised not to ask too many stupid questions. Said my knowledge of firearms and corporate espionage might come in handy solving a murder. He consults with the police off the books, apparently.”
“It’s fine; everything’s fine.  I just need to talk, to tell you things, and I can’t do it while you’re  awake. Too much noise, too much data; I can’t think when there’s so  much to see about you; your expressions and body language and the things  you say and don’t say. Sleep, John, please sleep. Dream about something  nice.”
"I'm too late, was too slow, it took too
to Sherlock, and he impulsively grins before letting out a plaintive whine.
Sherlock shrugs and nibbles stubbornly at another biscuit even though his pleasure in them has waned. The Holmes brothers do not speak of emotional matters, only cerebral, and this conversation is edging close to uncomfortable territories.
about him. To
"...Sherlock?"
John nods, and Sherlock is hard pressed to read much from his expression. Not that he's trying; John would know if he slipped into deduction mode, and though he hasn't tested the theory as of yet he's certain it would make John angry.
'This' is a Glock 17, cold and heavy in his hand.
John's quick hop-bounce across the sofa catches him by surprise, and the rest of his confession falls, ricochets off a cushion, and rolls away. Hands enter his view but before he can start up the fear that John means to take the decision literally out of
"Sherlock. Wake up."
"Good morning, again," John quips, before Sherlock can do much more than widen his eyes and draw in a deep breath. "Though we're well into the afternoon, now. How are you feeling?"
By then, John was ready.
"I'll have the security team provide sufficient noise, then, for when you and Doctor Watson welcome Mrs. Hudson home," Mycroft concedes, a little stiff and snide, but thankfully allowing John's mini tirade to pass without further remark. "Perhaps some last minute accident and subsequent repairs, to cover for any screams or broken china."
(Or is there someone waiting, already, for John?)
“Well…”
John's smile is no mere wisp this time; it blooms bright and warm and takes over his entire face in a blink. He reaches up, clasps the back of Sherlock's neck, and leans in startlingly close and yet not close enough by far. The proximity makes observations a little more difficult but still, happiness is as obvious on his face as relief is in the droop of his shoulders and the gusty sigh that turns into a chuckle.
"I do."
Hopefully the symbol shows up properly, however you're viewing this story, but just in case it doesn't, the last line of the inscription on Sherlock's new phone case is an "x" and an eternity symbol.

“I  wasn’t offering tea or jam,” Sherlock clarified. “Though if you’d  wished it I would have conjured some up. I suppose I should have said…
"Well...bollocks," John says helplessly. "Where'd I go wrong, exactly?"
Doctor Watson estimates that another three or four months should do the trick. The world's only consulting detective wonders how much time will be required to heal the invisible injuries that they've both picked up.
105. Naked SEX in bed. Me on my front. I can't even imagine exposing my face to you at such a time.
Nothing. He knocked as politely as he knew how; an apology for the angry pounding he’d dealt the door earlier.
John dutifully fulfills this item, carefully monitoring the goldenness of the toast under Sherlock's supervision, and even tries the results out himself. He admits it's delicious and then reluctantly declares that it probably won't hurt anything to indulge in the fat- and carbohydrate-laden snack once in a while. The way he closes his eyes and hums appreciatively over his last buttery bite makes Sherlock think that it will not be too arduous a task to tempt him into making the sweet treat at least every other Sunday.
= = = = =
Sherlock took a step forward.
It seems a momentous question, and Sherlock's sat up and wide-eyed and holding his breath, but John only quirks one eyebrow at him.
"He's still in France," Greg reports, fingers running down his notepad. They've got some of the best cybersecurity available, but John still has a distrust of such things when it comes to personal matters. Not to mention the revelation that Sherlock isn't quite "nothing, with no family connections". On a computer monitor, Mycroft Holmes appears to be nothing more than a mid-level bureaucrat, but the reality that they've crossed paths with a few times now is much more unsettling. It makes John cautious in a way that few things - or people - do, and he makes sure that anything to do with Sherlock stays only briefly on paper before being shredded and then soaked or burned, and Greg is the sole person entrusted with the details.
"Thought you weren't ready?"
A short sigh from his pyschologist.
(Mine.)
They're disguising themselves as workpersons here to effect some extensive rennovations or repairs, judging from the noise they're making. Perhaps the mold problem in C was falsely exaggerated. In addition to providing security, they're sneaking in the shopping and whatever other supplies you request disguised as equipment and building materials. Heavy footsteps come up the stairs, then go down, quicker and lighter. Ah, and they're also sneaking out the rubbish for you. Their presence also explains the continued use of electricity and water despite Mrs. Hudson being absent, should anyone be inspired to pull utility bills.
He looks most like Sherlock at first glance, with the same dramatic curls and heavy brows, the little upward tilt to the tip of his nose over lips that ought to look absolutely ridiculous on a man. John recognizes the rounded chin and precise angle of the jaw, and can't stop himself from glancing up from Mycroft's phone to compare the scattering of moles on Sherlock's neck to the ones on Geoffrey's.
13 chapters, they've communicated "I love you" to each other, and there is still no snogging. What even am I writing? orz
Sherlock scrunches up his face at this ridiculous cover story. Surely Mycroft's people could have come up with something better than
“Sherlock!”
(...?)
. It's over, I'm home, there's hope, there's reason to hope, and there's

John and Sherlock only end up arguing instead of explaining. Before  they can escalate to shouting and draw the attention of the nursing  staff, Mycroft steps in.
“Sherlock?”
3.	Kiss my temple and linger there, like you're breathing in my shampoo
It's like having gotten acclimated to a long vacation (
After that, it's an increasingly drunken competition to see who can declare the most devotion to John before the night is over.
John stares at her incredulously, wondering if she's experiencing a touch of senility.
“Good! That’s good, Sherlock. You make me happy too.”
And waiting for John to come home, which John had obviously just done.
"Not phrased exactly so, but yes. In fact, we'll need to update the recipe box. We covered quite a few new requests tonight."
"I missed you too." He looked up, glanced away, then re-settled his gaze upon Sherlock's; nervous, determined. "How would it be if I got changed while you made tea, and then we had a little cuddle on the sofa while I told you all about Count Sylvius?"
John sucks in a breath and sighs it out again, quick and shallow. It's hot against the hand that Sherlock stupidly still has pressed against the other man's lips, obviously impeding said man's ability to actually answer the question being put to him, but Sherlock is frozen solid, or stupid. And then John - clever John, adaptable John, master tactician Captain J. H. Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers - finds a way around the obstruction.
“No,  that’s not what I meant. Just you is fine, Sherlock.” John smiled, but  it was such a tired, sorrowful replica of his usual smiles and grins and  laugh precursors.
"Ah, one of those," John nods, still smiling but visibly settling in for a serious, solemn talk. This is not the first time Sherlock's emotionally tangental thoughts have been put to collaborative peer review.
"Want his number?"
(I love you.)
Barbarous, betraying bastards, the both of them.
"I admire your dedication to scientific accuracy," Sherlock murmurs, delighting in the playfulness and certainty of being loved that keeps this banter from becoming anything like torment. "Ninety-eight, too. Frottage. Against the wall. Specifically me against the wall, and you all over me. And then we did a bit of one-eleven and one-twelve, which was more of the same only in different positions, and concluded with one-fourteen, which was the one where I asked if we could take turns bringing each other off with our hands."
Sherlock opens a minuscule crack in his burrow so that he can whine out some of his misery.
81.	Rub your thumb over the bruise sometimes, like you're fond of seeing it and remembering
He contents himself with merely getting a bit more comfortable, fluffing the pillows he's squashed into stiffness and doing some careful stretches. Once settled, he finds himself easily entertained with the glimpses he gets of the other man cooking. The peep of the electric kettle, clinks and clatters of sturdy china, and the tantalizing crackle-spit-hiss of an egg cracked into a hot pan; it's a soothing concerto of home comforts, with John the soloist humming away in the spotlight.
And Sherlock thinks back to how John had wanted to keep him alive, and safe, and healthy from the very beginning of their acquaintance. To protect his reputation, his feelings. To have others acknowledge that he had feelings at all, in fact. To make him happy by
John.
“And is it
“Sherlock, please say something?”
88. Is the 69 position actually pleasurable or is it just a porn thing?
“Well, things you aren’t interested in. My pub-and-rugby mate. My…dinner-and-movie date.”
He sighs and looks up to find John watching him, an empty plate of his own on his lap and a contemplative look on his face. Sherlock blinks at realizing that he'd been so absorbed in his meal that he'd missed the opportunity to watch John tuck into his own fare. Another reminder of how much ground he's lost.
“Okay John,” Sherlock agrees wholeheartedly. Who needs drugs when they have a John? “I don’t need drugs anymore anyway.”
It’s the easiest out he’d ever been offered, but John  stayed silent. Sherlock wanting “a proper kiss” had particularly struck  him, for one. It was sweet and endearing and a tiny bit sad, which made  John hesitate to jump out the conversational window he’d been shoved  toward. He also remained mum on this point because there was no universe  in which Sherlock would react favorably to being told that John felt  badly for him in any way, shape, or form.
is equally stunning.
The soothing press of one hand trapped between John's forearm and palm. "Just absolutely brilliant."
"I am feeling

“Are we in any danger?” John grinds out from between his clenched teeth.
"Here is fine. I want to stay just like this, and have you talk to me until I fall asleep. Probably very rudely, right in the middle of a sentence."
86. And then I would like to practice these things on you
(Soon?)
John burst back into the flat at a much higher energy level than usual, pounding up the stairs without any concern as to what Sherlock might deduce from his speed and stomp factor.
, Sherlock thinks to himself, and smiles at the familiar figure fussing about one room over.
John's free hand comes up to pat Sherlock's, then adjusts the placement of their hands slightly so that they're directly over his heart. Pretense, apparently, is unnecessary.
This wasn’t…
"What are you telling me?" he asks. Breathes. It's barely a whisper.
Instead of rolling his eyes, Sherlock nods, because he does not want to ruin the mood by acting a prat. That done, he hints at a desire for recommencing the kissing by tipping his head invitingly and pinning his best yearning look at John's lips. If this were a dinner, he would be painted as a shameless glutton.
("I'm
"Blame Mycroft," Sherlock suggests, smiling sunnily over at his brother. "He knew too. In fact, hide in the bedroom with me, and let
He hasn't been so long at home now as to have forgotten how to survive. As soon as he recognizes the state he's fallen into, Sherlock begins getting himself out of it. He breathes in, and makes himself hold it for a five-count. In that moment of suspended operations, he shakes himself, tightens his grip on the gun and reality, and reassesses. The safety is on. He thumbs it off and kneels in the corner as directed, surrounded by pipes and appliances, and out of view of both the rooftop garden and the staircase. He breathes out slowly over a four-count, and looks over to the living room.
Right, okay. Time for the game ender.
Just then, John's phone chirps in an unfamiliar pattern. One, two, one; short, high-pitched beeps.
And with that fact acknowledged, the question that has been haunting Sherlock goes from a dread-soaked spectral shade to a mere lump of laundry to be ignored or attended to as the whim might take him, with no more importance either way.
But then again, John has always been keen on feeding him up.
(Oh.)
He also gets to see John close his eyes and struggle to even out his breathing. Their foreheads touch, or John will nuzzle into his collarbone or hair, like he wants to increase contact even as he dials back the tension. The kisses often resume, but they're quick and sweet, or smacking and silly. Sometimes they'll tease John's self-control again, and other times they'll move on to other things.
"I also want to apologize, not just say that I grieve for your sake. I want you to know that I never stopped regretting that one of the last things I said to you was that you were a machine. I hope you knew even then that I didn't mean it and never believed it. A robot would never endure what you have to keep its friends safe. A sociopath wouldn't
"It's fine," John insists, but he's tugging irritably at his vines. "You don't bloom for anyone, I get it."
John celebrates this by dragging Sherlock’s face down and nuzzling their noses together. He does it so enthusiastically that it sort of hurts, but pulls back before Sherlock has to complain about his cartilage.
A tiny thrill of vindication sparks briefly, but there are too many what-ifs and regrets over time and opportunities wasted to want to breathe any life into it.
“Getting there,” he says, then frowns and admits, “I think. I hope. God this is miserable; not being sure.”
"Yeah, see? This is why I need the notes. Shite at talking things out in general, and just...one of the biggest regrets I had was saying all the wrong things the day you...the day at Bart's, and never having said anything I ought to've, even before the whole mess with Moriarty. When I realized I'd been given this second chance, this
This was…
John’s unwavering gaze, too, is only adding to the unreality of the situation. Sherlock can’t bring himself to meet those long looks head on just yet, too fearful to even glance much at John at all. Too afraid of what he might glean from the man’s hair and skin, shoulders and clothes and cuticles.
They talk (read: complain with varying degrees of affection) about Sherlock, of course, until one day they're suddenly talking about John.
It's everything he couldn't have ever imagined receiving, wouldn't have dared to even dream of, overloading his heart and mind both. It's
"I believe Moriarty
He is asking.
At John's inquiring quirk of the eyebrows and expectant smile, Sherlock pats his midriff and lets out a satisfied sigh.
"What is it, love?"

“Okay! Takeaway or go get?”
“Whom,” Sherlock corrected, and then bit down on his lips and began intently examining the back of the sofa. John’s face must have reflected the level of homicidal he was feeling, because the expression on Sherlock’s face was very near regret.
He'd pegged John as starved for touch and honest affection from the very first, and needing to be shocked awake with a bit of excitement and adventure. Having been in a pique from growing bored of needling the Met, Sherlock had latched onto John Watson as an interesting new specimen to examine. He hadn't looked forward to much more than another evening successfully spent sober.
No one else notices that anything's gone amiss. John's temper is nothing new, and nobody had expected his recent uptick in good moods to last anyway. Some had even thought it downright disturbing to see the man acting so comparatively calm and civil, and are relieved in a way to see him return to his usual surly self. The sun rises in the east, it's raining in London, and John Watson is a twat.

specialty."
He thinks about the mirror, and looking into it, and then turns back to thoughts of simple pleasures previously taken for granted.
5.	Kiss my neck, just over my jugular vein
“Now get out!” Sherlock snapped, stomping a foot for emphasis and miraculously not coming off like a three year old while doing it.
“Gladly!” John snapped right back, and stomped both feet as he wrenched his way out the bedroom door, thundered up to his own room, and only stopped himself from kicking his bed in exasperation by recalling x-rays he’d seen of toes with multiple fractures.
45.	Nibble on my earlobe
"Not sleepy at all?" John asks. "Did you want to nip back out to the living room, or...?"
So to sum up, I want you to know that I understand why you left, that I'm so sorry you had to leave at all, and alone on top of it, and that I'm so glad you've come back..."
Sherlock winds down partly because he's just about done, and partly because he's gone a little hoarse.
...so that he could break up with her.
"I am trying to tell you - and apparently doing a piss-poor job of it, so no more faffing about - that I love you. That I'm
in response to John's heart laid bare before him.
Sherlock pleads.
“Oh,”  Sherlock said, disappointed. “Right, of course, that would be…” Silly,  stupid, insufficient. He waved away the sting of rejection and then  pulled his shoulders back, determined to do what he could.
Definitely clever, Sherlock thinks, as he settles himself into the leather armchair. Mary had clearly seen John's passivity and lack of engagement, so to speak, and taken steps to shore up the relationship. Initiates a three month anniversary celebration to kill two birds with one stone; not only is John suddenly aware of the actual date they'd become a couple, he'll feel the need to reciprocate by planning their six month do.
“Recovering, actually, if you’re well enough to whinge at me. I’m just glad the fever made you compliant enough to drink everything I held out to you. Wouldn’t have wanted to try putting a line in you while you were tossing and turning.” John’s smile grows tight, and he worms a hand under the coverlet to comb through crushed curls. Sherlock feels greasy and gross all of a sudden, unworthy of this affectionate treatment, and wrinkles his nose.
; name one
John is feeling rather good about all the amazing progress they're making, which is of course when Marcus claps his hands together with a smile and says,
"Oh, er...ta," John replies, not sure what to make of this seeming non sequitur. He drops back onto the cushions and turns wide eyes over to Sherlock.
The fever was from a ragged knife wound that Sherlock hadn't been able to reach well enough to stitch. He'd closed it with duct tape and collapsed in John's hotel room a week later. About the only silver lining to that whole incident was that John vomiting all over himself when he'd peeled back the tape had really sold the influenza story he'd told his security detail, allowing him to hide away in his hotel room for a few days and tend to the dying detective.
They're not just keeping others out, however; they're also here to ensure that you and I stay inside and undetected. You make trips out to the landing, but no further, and the curtains aren't just shut; they're clipped together and tacked down. I suppose Mycroft had you casually tell your inner circle that you were off to Scotland for a conference or some such thing, and planning to turn it into an extended holiday?"
, Sherlock,” John declares, and it fills Sherlock up with so much contentment that he thinks he might burst.
He's treated to a surprised but pleased expression as John climbs into his side of the bed.
(Ah. Formal meal etiquette.)
Individually packaged stainless steel scissors and scalpels. Sampling pens and punches. Microscope slides and cover glasses. Shampoo, conditioner, and bubble bath. (Probably unrelated; disregard.) Petri dishes, covers, and cling film. 50ml bottles of biuret reagent and crystal violet, and boxes of P30 antigen strips.
It's like a reverse imprinting; he's apparently been categorized as an abandoned chick in need of warmth and feeding, and nothing manages to dissuade the woman from settling over him like a broody hen. She clucks over the messes Sherlock makes and throws her hands up at John for wearing such nice clothes within the blast radius of the oft-times explosive and/or corrosive experiments being run in the kitchen. Chocolate digestives begin sharing space with gooey cakes on the tea tray after she discovers that John's not got as sweet a tooth as Sherlock. And whenever said tenant runs off without telling John where or when or why, she brews tea and settles in with the abandoned CEO to see if the distractible detective will return before the pot is empty.
What  few brain cells were still functional made an effort and rallied  together to scrounge through the mind palace for whatever they could  find of Best Man Duties, focusing on tasks that could be accomplished  with enough time and money and effort. Those were assets that he was  certain of. He wasn’t ready to calculate whether or not he would have  the heart to go through with it all.
“Sherlock,  can we talk? That is to say…can I apologize?” John asked through the  door. He gnawed on his lip a while, and when he still heard absolutely  nothing, began feeling sharp pinpricks of fear. What had he done? And  how badly had he done it?
The conversation seems to be over for now, as John then digs up the remote for the telly from behind a couch cushion. There are a thousand and one things Sherlock wants to say, but he is well and truly wrung out, and finishing his cuppa seems to be about the only thing he has strength for. Perhaps, if his luck holds, he'll wake up to renewed energy, a fried egg, and the chance to talk with a friend.
Incarcerated. Terminated.
“Pearl  Garden and tea, yes please,” John said. “Archeology marathon, fine.  Gemma, no. God no, she chucked me months ago. I meant…well, I was  thinking of you, for the…um. Company. Only if you’re okay with it. Just  sharing the couch is fine, too. We don’t need to…um. Touch.
“This feels like one of those moments where in hindsight, I’d look back and say, ‘now
"That would be acceptable." He folds his hands sedately over the book corner that he's destroyed in his nervousness. Hide the evidence.
After  mentally making a note to brush up on codependency, he set his book  aside and tried cajoling Sherlock back into the conversation.
There's a metal and plastic chair in the tub being rained on by the shower head, and a little space heater in the far corner making the steamy room even stuffier. He knows he'll be glad of the warmth as soon as he's wet, however, and appreciates the setup.
But there will be time for all that. Right now, he just wants to sit a little while longer on the sofa with John, ignored by absolutely everyone else, taking advantage of a rest well-earned and sorely needed.
"We can pull these up a bit, to hide our faces," Sherlock explains. "And I've got a hood to hide my hair."

Sherlock somehow survived the unbearable intimacy of tying John's tie while the man himself stared fondly up at him, chin lifted as if for a kiss. Then, the coup de grâce; John departed. To add insult to mortal injury, he did so with an extra spring in his step, Sherlock's unfiltered compliment having buoyed up his confidence and raised his spirits.
John admits with some sheepishness that she'd set the pace and he'd done nothing but go along with it all. He'd only really realized the scope of their relationship when she'd asked him to pick the restaurant for their three month anniversary.
Try again, Sherlock wants to beg. Ask me. Please still want to. But John isn't done explaining.
A tiny nod.
"May I have them?" he asks on impulse, "To keep, I mean." It's sentimentality at its most puerile. He can practically hear Mycroft's eyebrow twitching, almost feel that scornful gaze heavy upon his neck. This is one step above asking John to nip down to the local florist's for rose petals to be pressed and dried and used as a fragrant lining for the teak keepsake box that the notecards will be enthroned in.
"Just have one of the guards go for chips," Sherlock suggests, not fancying being pelted with chocolate and jam. "Less sticky, and you won't need proper plates and saucers."
otherwise. I’m such a…I don’t have a word  vile enough for the shitty sort of friend I’ve been to you and I am so  very sorry Sherlock.
He becomes aware that he's fallen asleep when he finds himself being woken up, with hands (gentle, warm, calloused, familiar,
As if to apologize for sharing so much of Sherlock's features, he seems to have modeled his attire - at least in this photo - after Mycroft, buttoned-up and formal.
"Do you have any more?" he asks, glancing up and then craning his neck to look over at the desk. "They come in packs of a hundred, don't they? Could I? Would you mind, if I...? Would it be an appropriate method? This is not my forte either, as you well know, and as you said yourself, I need to say everything that I need to say."
The greater part of the conference ends up being anti-climactically simple and straightforward, as if even Mycroft has decided that careful civility will be his best approach while Captain Watson is on duty, and a quick escape his surest bet for continued good health.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What happens to someone who drinks a full dose of all the neutralizers at once?”
Well...bollocks.
"You know I love you."
The grin is smacked right off by this instantly sobering opening, and replaced by an equally unnoticed look of slack-jawed wonder.
It's over. He can finally allow himself to see John again. To
to clarify, sadly. John lifted his head, frowning in obvious puzzlement.
John has declared himself available to be Sherlock's friend and physician and many other things. But there may yet be another person who can claim John in other ways (lover, husband), and Sherlock is not yet strong enough to examine that theory deliberately, to look directly at it and let details and observations resolve and solidify.
"Oh spare me the ardent flames of your new religion, John. I've no need of your precious Dr. Hughes or any of his ilk."
“Apology accepted.” It was stiff and stilted, just like his posture, but John’s smile spread into an outright grin.
"Hungry?"
John  teleported down the hallway somehow, snatched the cigarettes out of his  best friend, flatmate, and date candidate’s hands - “John!” - and  chucked them down the stairs for Mrs. Hudson to trip over, tut at, and  bin.
"...Sherlock, you in there?"
“Yes, you look very broken up.”
“And DON’T pretend you don’t know who I’m talking about!” John added, flicking one finger loose from around his mobile so that he could stab the air with it.
“What are you talking about, you silly git?” John chortled, having fallen prey to his cocktail while listening.
“Even a one percent chance of having just quaffed the results of the Sherlock Holmes Brew Your Own MDMA kit is too high, you tit! Why’d you even drink yours anyway?! We were supposed to take it in turns!”
(Oh!)
Ring selection was a moot point; he had missed (
Sherlock lets his curls run wild, an oddity among age mates who censure old fashioned notions of modesty, chastity, and prudence. Locks are cut short or plaited neatly to better show off the vines sprouting near hairlines whenever a new connection is formed. Unnatural tints are applied so leaves and tendrils show up better, and elaborate combs and hair sticks are arranged to support precious buds and blossoms. Sherlock will part his curls to reveal thready vines and leaves like bottle shards, if proving his humanity becomes necessary, but the tiny white stars are ruthlessly culled whenever he finds them.
is likely sketched out on the notecards. He's suddenly both impatient and reluctant to get acquainted with the contents.
"I'm not sure," Sherlock replies honestly. Will that change too? Will he sink back into old habits, once he's settled back into old haunts?
John waited out the scrutiny.  Three of the best and happiest months of his life now - despite  occasional blunt force trauma and one particularly harrowing gunshot  wound - and he was at ease by this time with all the bits of his heart  that he freely let flow from eyes and lips and fingertips. Let Sherlock  gather all the data he liked; John had nothing to hide. Even the little  lingering shard of doubt of how willing Sherlock might be to acknowledge  that they loved each other - the depth and mutuality of their affection  weren’t in question; only whether they’d eventually make it official  and let it permeate all facets of their life together - was easy to  leave out on display.
“Sherlock? I need you to pay attention, all right?”
"She was making a joke about celebrating 'satisfactory first quarter results' or something like that and checking out restaurants online, thank God," John recalls. "I'm just stood there trying to get my mouth to close. I knew we were dating, but not...I just hadn't thought about it at all, I guess. It woke me up a bit, I think. Shamed me into trying harder to pick myself back up and really move on, not just put myself into her hands and let her do all the work."

In addition to disinhibition on par with consuming eight servings of alcohol, subjects experienced some expressive dysphasia while the neutralizers remained in the system. Some xerostomia was noted upon waking the next morning, however this may have been due to poor hydration in the hours preceding. Further testing required. As theorized, the combined neutralizers have none of the following side effects; presyncope, disequilibrium, nausea, ataxia, excessive somnolence, dyspnea, arrythmia, bradycardia, tachycardia, syncope, and amnesia.
There’s a quick flinch at John’s tone. Just as the blond is familiar with the varieties of his flatmate’s exclamations, Sherlock is the premier expert on all the ways John Watson can say a person’s name. It’s a matter of survival, really. And the one that’s been trotted out now is the low growl with a slight rise in inflection toward the end that makes it a question, except that it’s less a query and more of a “you understand that if you don’t give me what I want
Now though, he looks contentedly tired, and grins after bitching about the ache in his thighs whenever he decides to get up for another beer. Greg rewards himself by munching his way through an enormous bacon and garlic aioli butty piled high with straw potatoes and pickled onions, and washing it down with criminally expensive whiskey.
"Can I, then?" John asks, steady and sure but still requesting permission. There is no hand in the way of his taking, now; they are clenched bloodless-tight in Sherlock's lap.
"Stand down, Captain," Mycroft orders, by way of greeting.
"It'll still be the two of us," John says, nothing of mockery or teasing in his tone. He gives Sherlock's shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "At the core, at least. Always you and me. You can get London and puzzle-solving and all of that back without giving up what we've already got here. So no matter what else happens, no matter what gets...I don't know, blown up or scraped away or lost, you'll always have this. I'll be with you, at your side and on it. You have my word."
"Did you buy exercise equipment?" He mentally begs for the answer to be in the negative, or if affirmative, to be solely for John's own use.
Will it be here waiting for him when he returns? Or will it have faded, dimmed; something not quantifiable and yet unarguably real gone missing, once they were not present to sustain it? Perhaps it will even prove to have only been a way-stop along a linear path that he cannot double back on, a dance they cannot fall back into once they lose the rhythm.
When they meet, Sherlock quirks an eyebrow as the doctor's coronet of greenery noticeably thickens. The other eyebrow joins its mate when merely walking closer causes a blushing bud to appear over John Watson's left ear. Brushing fingers causes two more to nose their way through thick blond strands, and John grins a bit sheepishly while smoothing his unruly vines back with one hand.
Anyway...his John. His smiling, happy, rumpled John, who is now rolling off his back and onto his side so that he can tap playfully at Sherlock's nose.
But deserving or not, he must try to live up to John's faith, love, and kindness.
Marcus helps him elaborate.
up, maybe have a fried egg with his toast and tea, or a roast drumstick or two instead of shredded chicken in his rice and broth, sit in his chair and actually use the loo.
"Please."
When he wakes, it's not to the sound of something sizzling in a pan, but rather to a quiet, irregular clacking. Keeping himself still, Sherlock peels his eyes open and spots John sitting at the desk, one hand keeping his chin propped up and the other idly tapping a pen. He's frowning thoughtfully down at something, but from his slouch on the couch Sherlock can't tell what it is. After observing a bit longer without any developments, he hums and stretches as if he's just now waking up, and notes John's sudden startle and hasty shuffling of small pieces of paper. (Thick. Regular. Cardstock. Index cards?)
He's only logical when it comes to business matters.
and aware of and grateful for my body in a way that seems completely new to me. I am experiencing actual cravings for food, if you can believe it."
“John? It’s me, it’s Sherlock. You’re in your room, at Baker Street, in London…”
Mycroft visibly bristles.
"Thank you for the wonderful meal." It's delivered with heartfelt sincerity. Absence makes the stomach as well as the heart grow fonder. After a moment's consideration, Sherlock expands on his expression of gratitude.
He feels in real danger of a myocardial infarction at the first four words (what's her name?), but the time frame John gives his lie (??) lets him breathe again.
I have made spekkoek (aka lapis legit or thousand layer cake) a few times before, mainly for bragging rights. It is a marathon baking project that should only be attempted by people with strong backs. You take two bowls of batter (it's like 90% butter and egg and just a smidgen of sugar and flour to hold it together) and color one with tons of cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, and other spices. Then you take a brush and paint on one layer of plain batter thin enough to read a newspaper through and broil it for three minutes. Once it's baked, you butter it and paint on a layer of dark batter, then broil THAT for three minutes. Rinse and repeat for eternity, or until you have depleted your supply of batter or your will to live.
"All right?"
For science.
"Hang on, is that why you keep deleting Lestrade's first name?!"
He popped up and chased Sherlock into the kitchen.
John is knelt in the living room, lacing up his boots, and Sherlock gets in the way by fussily arranging his blue scarf around the man's neck. John returns the favor with the grey scarf that had been dropped carelessly to the floor.
John snorts and then gives the older man an impatient jerk of the chin, wanting him to get on with the update.
"Obvious," Sherlock replies - some habits die hard indeed - and then he's off, pointing out all the details that've been acquired since he woke up and found himself reinstated at Baker Street. At first he only explains what he's deduced from John's hair and socks and abducted from the dust and placement of certain books and what-nots in his bedroom, plus some supplemental notes from this morning's foray into the bath and living room. An inference about utensils, however, segues into the quality of chicken breast - and the one egg - he's been served during his recuperation so far, and that in turn leads to his declaration that Mycroft is in charge of the shopping.
Basically, she's Sherlock's long-suffering, under-appreciated, but very much loved mum.
He hadn't ever thought that it would be some cutting remark made to the woman that would make the array of sunset-hued flowers curl shut and begin drooping.
A minute ticks by before Mycroft sighs and stands.
“I’m sorry, John.”
The  voice is familiar (Sherlock), the voice is safe (home), and the voice  doesn’t sound worried or impatient or scared (no cases, no injuries).  There’s nothing urging him to consciousness, so John relaxes into the  pocket of warmth that’s collected under the blankets, shying away from  air that’s a few degrees too cool for comfort. There’s a shift nearby;  the earth moves, or tilts, or gravity decides to work a different way  (Sherlock’s leaning on the bed) and John shifts a little too, as if  something’s pulling him closer.
"That," John murmurs, nosing at the curve of Sherlock's fingers and pressing a light kiss to the palm. He pulls away and also tugs Sherlock's wrist down, finally getting the interfering limb out of the way of his mouth.
(Sentiment, but this is not grit in the guts of his microscope; he is being crushed under a truckload of gravel. Oh John, John,

The first step is for Mrs. Hudson to be recalled to Baker Street, of course. This merely requires an email to be sent, informing her that the rennovations at 221 are complete and that her travel arrangements are attached.
“I also go on…erm. Snog-and-shag dates, where the dinner and movie are more…incidental.”
So in my notes, this was supposed to be just a paragraph or two before I led into the next bit. It ended up being a whole chapter by itself. How do I concise??

"Well it's fucking embarrassing, for one!"
So now, thanks to Sherlock's traitorous mouth and unruly heart, John was off to mingle his way through a ballroom, armed with Gieves & Hawkes, an easy demeanor, and a devastating grin.
The somewhat awkward air is escaped by John offering Sherlock a choice of where to move to next. Thoroughly sick of his own room by this point, Sherlock immediately pleads for anywhere at all other than his bed, and rejoices when he's told he can sit on the couch for the rest of the day. John sets him up with a nest of what seems to be every pillow and cushion belonging to Baker Street and then disappears into the kitchen. While John fusses with the kettle, Sherlock greedily drinks the room in; differences, additions, removals, and everything that's remained the same.
*sobs in weary gratitude while finally adding the "first kiss" tag after nearly 18k words*
"Maybe you ought to keep hidden away at first," John chuckles, apparently having envisioned similar scenarios. "I'll lure her upstairs with tea and talk, and then you can pop out when I've got her occupied with a jaffa cake or something else nice and soft, in case she's in a throwing mood."
Sherlock is surprised at how light they are before realizing he's expecting physical weight equal to the emotional impact they contain. The impulse to hold them carefully collides with the desire to crush them tight, and both get tangled up in a sudden urge to literally consume them. In this shaken-up state, Sherlock trusts himself not one bit to speak clearly and coherently, but he cannot say
John does spend a great deal of time "working on his frown lines" in Dr. Hughes's office, but as it's a thoughtful, productive silence, the psychiatrist allows it.

= = = = =
John teases him for the full list. Some of the items on the list are impossible under current circumstances, or at the very least exceedingly ill-advised, so Sherlock's compromise is writing the first five items down on an index card and handing it over for review and discussion, with more to be revealed if all goes well.
There's a red morocco leather case under the floorboards of Sherlock's bedroom in which he's put away his addictions; the tourniquet and syringe, an old mobile with his dealer's number in it. John is small, but he won't fit in it - at least not without a great deal of processing - which worries Sherlock a little. (The metaphor, not the murder.)
At first she's merely Sherlock's slightly batty landlady, only met in little glimpses here and there as she brings them tea or calls up to the first floor whenever someone comes knocking for the world's only consulting detective. She staunchly defends herself from the title of housekeeper, and so far as John can tell from the chaotic clutter in 221B, she's really not. She's just Sherlock's doorman, administrative assistant, chef, laundress, and occasional nurse.
Nothing.
Sherlock is essentially recovered, but John's belongings do not migrate back to his house. Nor do John and Rosie. There are carefully nonchalant comments about getting out of Sherlock's hair, and after every sincere invitation for the Watsons to stay as long as they like, another bit of permanence makes it way to Baker Street.
“What are you–” John asked, but Sherlock interrupted, gesturing with the remote.
to say?
Sherlock drifts and dreams and when he finally manages to pry his gummy eyes open, what he sees only serves to further disorient him. He’s in his old bedroom but there are wires and tubes trailing away from him and the unfortunately familiar peep of a heart monitor nearby. Every bit of him is in pain, but it’s more soreness than the slashed and stabbed feeling he was expecting, and his back is no longer a mass of raw fire. And oh…John is there, (John, John,
Sherlock's first full day out of bed
(And perhaps, partly because he doesn't want to stumble into how John makes and receives no calls, and doesn't text often enough or with much fondness of expression. His emails, too, are numerous but short. In enough love to propose, but not to keep in touch? Or secure enough not to need to? Does Mycroft screen all his communications? John would not want to woo a woman with big brother watching. Or has she been entrusted with this secret and commissioned to help him keep up his cover story? Is she off in Scotland alone, snapping photos and sending back postcards to their mutual acquaintance? Is she dreaming of coming back on her honeymoon, to walk the shores while holding John's hand?)
Some things are the same. They share food and drink, have spirited discussions and heated arguments, chase down clues and criminals, and generally have a marvelous time getting into all sorts of trouble.
“Pub  nights are indeed of no interest to me. I have no objection to your  continuing to attend such things with Lestrade or Stamford. But perhaps  it has fallen within your observations that I will in fact deign to eat  dinner and watch a movie so long as it is in your company.”
"A little help?"
And stared at him.
(Dating? Engaged? Married?)
After enough time and bewilderment, John cleared his throat.
. Even if you'd not come back.
. He stares so long that John's discomfort turns to concern. And then he yelps as Sherlock suddenly comes back to life and begins raking his hands through his hair, nearly headbutting his concerned physician.

Sherlock stares, then blinks a bit when his eyes start to dry out.
"Feeling a little awkward, here."
Baking should be an Olympic sport.
He leans in, and...and Sherlock isn't sure what this is. It's very much like a kiss, except that
The  quietest “oh” in the history of breathy realizations ghosts past John’s  left ear, and he chuckles and sniffles while Sherlock processes.
"People make new friends at all stages of life. There's nothing remarkable about it, and that's what makes things seem embarrassing, isn't it? The fear that people will notice something out of the ordinary, stop and stare, and start thinking thoughts about us?"
"Here," he says, his voice a rusty ghost of its usual tone and timbre. "It's all in here."
On those nights, John putters around, getting ready for the next day's meetings while Sherlock relays messages that he couldn't trust to any of their timed drops or encrypted phones, uses John as a board against which to iron out the kinks in his plans and plots, and eats whatever room service has delivered. That done, he strips and showers and then collapses in John's bed, unconscious as soon as his head hits the pillow. John sits on the floor, eyes on the door and one hand on whatever weapon Sherlock happens to bring with him.
He taps out a Paganini caprice on the coverlet a quasi presto and considers his options. John is not in the room, but can be heard puttering around in the kitchen, so for obvious reasons, attempting to roam around the flat is out. And while he's itching for something to occupy himself with, Sherlock is also not unaware of the positive effect his meek obedience has been having on John's mood. The doctor's insistence on quick, honest answers to all of his patient care questions have also left their mark in turn. Even if he were to successfully get out of bed, snoop around, and tuck himself back in none the worse for wear and John none the wiser, Sherlock finds himself uneasy at the idea of lying at the next patient interview, whether directly or through omission.
Years upon years of repressed emotion break free in a violent, unplanned and uncoordinated rush, and he might as well attempt to dam up the Thames with a spoon as stop the tears from flowing. As long as he'd been alone and beset on all sides with danger both real and theoretical, there'd been plenty of motivation to keep himself walled up and hidden away. It had been logical and even natural to act like the sociopath he'd billed himself as once upon a time. But now, back home at Baker Street, surrounded with dearly missed comforts, cared for and tended to and fed, this last act of kindness from the one person he'd missed most obliterates all of his defenses.
"What? No?" John follows his gaze and then brightens. "Oh, fantastic! These are for you, too. Why don't you go ahead and open them all up while I sort out the groceries."
"Um. Let me just..." Sherlock scrabbled for John's phone, needing a moment in which to recover.
(My John.)
Except that one day, many days later, Sherlock demanded it.
Greg isn't always there, but he gets reports. He wonders if this is John's way of coping with the loss of something that remained undefined even before it was taken away. He wants to ask, but is kept so busy directing and expanding his team that there's no second opportunity to presume upon their tenuous friendship.
Sherlock is suddenly breathless and wanting all over again, and finds boldness hiding underneath desire.
. If Mycroft hadn't needed me to talk to her and get her to keep mum about all this, it might've been days before I remembered to call her. It was like...relying on a penlight to navigate a dark room...and when you get out and it's all bright outside, you can't even see the beam anymore. And this is such a fucking awful way to describe an amazing woman, like I was just using her to get by, and I--"
He might actually be gearing up toward huffiness over this thought. He'd just performed a thoracotomy on himself, reached in, tugged out his heart, and given it over to the most important person in all his life, and John is thinking about
Others are familiar and comforting to find again, like the satisfying crunch of autumn leaves after a wet spring and long summer. Jokes and praise and a perfectly fried egg.
Pompilidae is the family name of the spider wasp. They are solitary and as their nickname suggests, are known for hunting and killing spiders. Do not check out the spider wasp wiki. It is chock-a-block with nightmare fuel.
"Well done! That's Mycroft out of our hair for a few weeks at least. Do shed that ridiculous get-up John. I'll make tea."
"I've been keeping something...I've been
106. But then again, I would want to see your face. Memorize all your expressions. Me on my back, then? Perhaps you could promise to keep your eyes closed?
When Sherlock finds spermicide-coated options, he breaks and asks for edification.
Sherlock allows himself to be tucked protectively behind his doctor-physical therapist-bodyguard-boyfriend-
And once John Watson commits to something, he puts his head down and goes for it.
100. And then let me slowly slide down, nipping your buttons open (wear the pale blue button-down) and then (oh, and the dark blue jeans) let me put what I learned from requests 85 through 87 to the test
He'd endured two years of minimal involvement in and sporadic updates on a mission that had the potential to inflict considerable ruin upon his life, both professionally and personally, but that he could not acknowledge even existed. Sherlock had not emerged unscathed by any means, and could not have predicted the way in which John had welcomed him back. He now looked back at his relationship with his brother and wondered how it, too, would prove to have changed.
He bonked his head once against the wood,  trying to find the right words to unlock the door, trying to find the  right salve for the injuries he’d so unforgivably inflicted.
with that disinhibition is still undecided. It could be anything from tearing off John's shirt and marking him with a bite, to blurting out a proposal of marriage and matching tattoos. Whatever it ends up being, he's sure it'll be mortifying.
A shiver pours down the entire surface of his epidermis, beginning with the crown of his head and ending with a spasm of his toes.
Sherlock stares, almost boggles, at this infinitely patient and understanding and gentle John. This communicative John. This John who so easily clasps his forearms, leans in, and maintains eye contact from a scant foot away.

He accepts it like he accepts that he can only have clear liquids, mashed fruits, and overcooked rice right now; it is a temporary condition brought on by his poor health. As John said, "more" is for when he's stronger, both body and mind. It motivates him to be as ideal a patient as possible. When he starts to yearn for activity and input, he quells the urge to complain by imagining getting out of bed without wincing and twinging, showering and shaving and suiting up, and then going to Angelo's for carbonara and a glass of Picpoul de Pinet, with John smiling up at him along the way.
“John it’s me. It’s…it’s Sherlock. You’re having a–”
When they break apart, sidelong glances show them Mycroft eyeing the eclectic collection of bedroom and laboratory supplies still scattered about. John's embarassed throat-clearing restarts the conversation easily enough, however, and soon Sherlock is signing a more prosaic stack of paperwork, attesting that he the undersigned duly acknowledges that he is, in point of fact, not dead.
