“‘Rip it from your being?’ Cas that sounds…” Dean scratches the back of his neck again awkwardly. “Well pretty damn painful, are you sure you wanna do this?”
“It’s okay, Dean, it’s okay. I’m here.” And with those simple words, Dean’s entire body just crumbles as he falls against Cas’ chest.
Cas raises his arm to rest his hand on Dean’s shoulder again, but Dean just shoves it away. “Dammit, Cas, drop it.”
Cas stays quiet for a moment, trying to regain his strength. Trying to find every ounce of strength inside himself to resist the urge to pull Dean close and kiss away the tears from his face. “Dean, you don’t understand. I don’t want to do this….” Castiel let’s out a frustrated huff, he didn’t realize it’d be this hard to tell Dean what he had done. “I made a deal with The Empty to save Jack, Dean. I had to. He’s family. I had to do anything I could to save him.”
On the (very) slim chance that Dean does make some sort of gesture of love, Cas would be overjoyed. So overjoyed, in fact, that every single part of his being would be filled with happiness… which sounds great and all, minus the fact that he made a deal with the The Empty… the second Cas succombs to happiness; he’ll be sucked into the void.
“No Dean, I mean… remember when Jack died and Lily came to perform the spell to bring him back? I had to go to Heaven to get him and bring his soul back to his body.”
Dean would wake up in a pool of sweat and tear soaked cheeks. Then sob the rest of the night away.
was happy, too.
Jack stared at the beer in his hand with his eyebrows raised as he thought about how to respond. “Well, I--”
“I know it’s a lot to ask, Cas, but… hold on,” Dean disappears down the hallway in a rush, but is only gone for a minute before returning with a clear glass vial with a cork on top. “Cas, if you give up your grace, you become human, right? Just like when Metatron ripped it from you for the spell that made the angels fall. You became human… would the same thing still happen if you willingly gave up your grace?”
“Cas? Cas?!” He is full on, honest to god, freaking out now. What did he just do? It was his idea to take Cas’s grace… he was supposed to become human not completely give out right in front of him for the love of—-
“Okay, is there anything specific we need to extract your grace? Is there some kind of spell? What ingredients do we need?” Dean is opening the cupboards and pulling out a large ceramic mortar and a wooden pestle, preparing to mash together whatever they’ll need for the spell.
Saving people.
“When I was in Heaven, The Empty was there. He felt like he had claim over Jack’s soul… I had to… Dean, I had to make a deal. Me for Jack.”
“You did everything you could, Dean. You can’t put all the blame on yourself.” Cas says from behind him. Dean just rolls his eyes and takes in a sharp breathe.
Dean takes a deep breath before deciding to take the plunge. He’s been afraid to admit his feelings, even to himself, for years. Almost a fucking decade. But he’s already started this, no backing out now. It’s time to fight for this before he loses his angel forever.
Dean shakes his head, trying to keep those thoughts in the deep corners of his mind where all the dark memories go. Trying to bury it as far away as possible and hoping it never surfaces again.
That is until he hears Dean take in another breath, this time it’s shaky and uneven. The unsteady breath pulls Castiel’s angelic blue gaze away from the floor and up to the hunter’s face. His heart immediately breaks at the sight in front of him.
Cas’ arms, somehow, wrap even tighter around Dean, holding him infinitely closer.
“Dean?” Cas wavers before following his gaze. “What do you see?” He asks looking everywhere. The footboard still the end of the bed, the blanket under his legs, the smudge on his pant leg, the scuff on his—
“No, no, I know, but…. bare with me here. What would happen if it came to take you to the Empty and you didn’t have your grace or any of your angel-mojo?”
This is fucking
This is supposed to be all his happiest moments, this is meant to be the place where all the bad is kept locked out and hidden away. But now the only thing running through his mind is how Cas isn’t there and never will be.
“Cas? What’s wrong with Cas? Where is he?”
“But then you prayed to me in Purgatory,” Cas continued his speech without even acknowledging Dean’s words. “It reignited that spark in me, Dean. You forgave me for the mistakes I’ve made and you apologized for your own. You reminded me what it meant to be part of a family. Yes, I was… amin love with you, Dean, but that’s not what matters the most. I don’t care what kind of relationship we have, as long as we have one. After your prayer I was ready and willing to be nothing more than friends, if that's what you wanted. I just wanted to be in your life. I never expected more. I knew I’d never be truly and completely happy that way, but that just meant I could stay here longer with you. The Empty would never come after me.”
But something went wrong, something always goes wrong, and two innocent lives were lost instead of saved... why? Because Dean fucked up. He wasn’t quick enough. He wasn’t smart enough. He wasn’t... he just wasn’t enough.
“Cas— Cas, I—“ Dean chokes out through the lump in his throat as he presses his cheek against Cas’s shoulder.
“Dean, I told you; I heard your prayer,” Cas cuts Dean off before he can say anything too emotional. “I know that you feel uncomfortable talking about your feelings and your prayer was enough for me. I appreciate your forgiveness and more than accept your apology.”
“Okay.., it’s okay. We will figure it out. Can you try to explain it to me?” Dean stands up and takes a step away from the bed to give Cas a once over. “I mean from here you look… the same. I don’t see anything—“ his words stop abruptly and he’s suddenly sheet white, paler than a ghost. His eyes locked on something towards the bottom of the bed.
They could’ve been saved. They could be alive right now. Dean and Cas should’ve left that small town feeling proud and appreciated by happy family. Instead they left a grieving husband and son, father and brother, to try to find a way to move on after losing half of themselves.
“Okay, Dean,” Cas says to the floor, refusing to look at him.
When Dean’s life came to an end, part of him was relieved. No more fighting, no more monsters, and no more living without the love of his life.
Three minutes turn into ten, which turn into twenty, until...
What good is being in Heaven if he doesn’t even get to be with the one he loves most?
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean, I know. I know. We don’t have much time. Please,” he reaches out his hand towards Dean and Dean takes in right away. His hands trembling in his angels.
But, deep down, he knew Sam better than that. He knew that his brother was probably still out there in the world fighting the good fight.
“Cas…” Dean chokes out, but can’t bring himself to form any other words.
“Dean.” Cas’ voice is quiet in the silence of the bunker... gentle.
No. Nope. No way. Dean is not doing this right now. He shrugs Cas’ arm off him and continues making his way towards the kitchen, but he can hear the footsteps following him. “Just leave it, Cas.  I fucked up, we don’t need to have some big, chick-flick moment about it.”
“M’fine, Dean, just—“ his legs give out before he can finish and he slumps into Dean’s arms. Dean easily holds him up, his strong frame keeping either of them from crashing to the ground.
He vaguely hears footsteps coming from the hall before hearing his brother's voice. “Dean? Is that you?” Sam appears in the doorway of the room in sweatpants and a T-shirt. His confused expression quickly shifting to worry as he runs to sit next to Dean on the ground beside the bed. “Dean?! What happened? What’s going on?”
Dean wraps his other hand around the back of Cas’s head, tilting his face towards Deanto lock eyes with his angel. His eyes are half lidded, as if he’s drowsy, and Dean realizes Cas didn’t make a single sound during the grace extraction. “Cas, how you feeling, buddy?” He asks warily. Dean suddenly realizes how wobbly Cas’s head is, his hand the only thing keeping his head from dropping back. “Cas, talk to me.” His voice quickly going from hesitant to worried.
“The Shadow didn’t want me then. The deal was that it’d take me when I was truly happy. When I felt truly happy… With Jack back now and the chance we now have against Chuck… there would only be one other thing that could make me truly and completely happy, Dean…” Cas looks into Dean’s eyes then, hoping they speak for him so he doesn’t have to say it aloud.
“Dean?” Cas says, staring at the hand held out to him with his head tilted and his brows furrowed.
“Did I, Cas?! Did I?!” Dean turns around to face the angel, so he can look him in the eyes and see nothing but the reflection of failure.
Two sets of wooden tables and chairs in front of him. Six white pillars, standing proudly next to shelves holding one-of-a-kind books. An impressively large black telescope in the center of a red brick wall.
He chuckles to himself at the memory before it fades away and the room is empty again. He strolls down the hallway towards the kitchen. As he approaches the doorway, he can’t help but remember how close he and Cas had been, how their fingers brushed together when Dean handed him the glass of whiskey.
Instead, Cas’s eyes are soft. His brows are furrowed and he’s looking at Dean with nothing but reverence and worry and love—
“Nice try,” he hears The Shadow whisper sadistically before the darkness is swallowed up completely by the void, disappearing into thin air.
Dean reached out to Cas, desperate to wipe away the tears that were rolling down his cheeks and pull his angel close to his chest. But Cas moved his body to the side and out of Dean’s reach. “Cas, please… I didn’t mean--”
“Nothing I have ever felt before, even when I was human.”
The boys are all sitting around the map table taking in everything Jack just told them. Kill Chuck? Kill God?
“Dean, please just give me a moment. I promise I am fine I just need to….adjust,” Castiel softly assures Dean. His eyes closed and his breathing heavy. Dean kneels in front of Cas on the side of the bed, staring at Cas and just… waiting.
Dean pulls away to look at Castiel, trying to memorize his every feature. His enchantingly blue eyes, his messy black hair, his slightly chapped but oh-so-kissable lips… he allows his eyes to scan over Cas’s briefly. Complete darkness covering Cas from the chest down now…
PLEASE let me know what you think!! I LIVE FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
“Dean, I must go. I... I cannot stay here with you,” his heart ached as the words left his lips. He didn’t dare turn around and say it to Dean’s face and see the pain he was causing. He continued down the hallway until he was by the stairs that lead out of the bunker. But a strong hand grabbed his shoulder and spun him around.
“I love you, Dean. Every minute we had together, like this, no matter how few, was worth it. Do you hear me? Every second I had with you was worth it. Okay?” Cas leans forward again and Dean presses a soft kiss against his forehead. The black goo has now covered both of Castiel’s legs from the knees down and is currently working its way over his thighs. “I know you, Dean. I know you’re going to blame yourself for this, but you CAN’T. This is not your fault. I made the deal. I knew this was something that could happen. We knew this was a possibility… okay?” Deans nods, but doesn’t pull his head away from Cas. Both of their hands are locked together so tight between them, trembling as tears drop onto their fingers. “Just please don’t blame yourself Dean…you gave me hope. You made me feel joy I never thought I’d be able to feel. You taught me how to be human, how to love. Don’t regret a single moment.”
“.....he’s gone, Sammy.”
Dread washes over him as he stares at the now-familiar black ooze slowly working its way across his leg, moving to cover his foot. He forces himself to pull his eyes away to look at Dean.
“So.. you’re okay… you’re human now?”
“No, Cas, wait,” Dean called after him. Cas could hear the hunter’s heavy steps following him.
“Cas, wait… I can’t— I’ve already—“ Dean isn’t sure what to say, but he knows he has to say something before the angel walks away and out of his life for good this time.
As long as he was happy, Dean didn’t care what Sam was doing. He just wanted his brother’s happiness and he knew that Sam had found that with Eileen.
He can almost see the gears turning in Dean’s head, but finally a look of understanding falls on the hunter’s face and he immediately takes a step back. “Cas…” he breathes.
Dean swallows thickly before lifting his knife to make a small cut on Cas’s neck, then he hears Castiel mumble the Enochian phrase. It takes a moment and Dean is worried it didn’t work, but suddenly a blue glow slowly begins to pour from the small incision on Cas’s neck. His grace fills the vial all the way to the top and, as soon as the light fades from the opening on Cas’s neck, Dean puts the cork on the vial and quickly cups his hand on Cas’s wound with a cotton pad from the first aid kit.
“When I first held your soul, it was so…” to Dean’s horror, Cas was getting choked up, “different to the other souls I’d handled. I knew the trials Michael was going to put you through, and I just wanted to remove any discomfort or upset or-” he paused again, steadying himself, “I just wish I could’ve done it sooner. I’ve since learned the surgery you underwent beforehand can be expensive.”
Another wordless nod from Mary. Dean reasoned with himself that this must be harder for her than it is for him, that she’d just been blasted forward from the eighties, that countless scenarios must be running through her mind as she looked at him, witches curses and accidents and medical tragedies. What else could help her understand the shock of putting her daughter, blonde haired and grinning, to bed, then meeting him hours later, gruff and world-weary?
The whole thing made his head swim. So he huffed and stood up.
“Seriously man? Come on, how is she supposed to know that? So, she thinks I’m sexy, who cares?” Dean shook his head and shrugged, giving a chuckle as if it were funny to him. Castiel did not find it amusing; Dean is his, how dare some insignificant mortal think that she could pull him away from his ‘friend for a fun night’. As if she could ever compare to their bond.
With the powers to rival god, he still was dedicated to Dean Winchester. Whatever Dean wants.
P. S. We expect a invitation to the weddings.
“Bait?” Oh great, was he going to be the bait for a werewolf?
When they are trying to salt and burn one of the bodies having just finished digging her grave. She grabbed Dean and Sam, throwing them back into the cottage. She thought they were helping the other ghost and took to fighting them.
“Why?”
- - - - -
He kept his eyes there and stared into his eyes they kept it there until finally it seemed that Dean would listen to him. “You are important Dean. You are worth saving.” He waited before pulling away, “my apologies for getting so close.” He added before turning to the older angel. “So how do we do this?” He asked and Gabriel chuckled throwing an arm around Sam's shoulders, tugging him down and against his side.
But when they past the rodents Castiel had paused and was there not even noticing Dean was there. So much that Dean moved to find an employee to ask if Castiel could hold one of the guinea pigs. There were ten and when Dean was there telling him that he could hold one he was more then happy. He had to go to a special room but got to hold whichever he wanted.
“It would work. The two could probably work well together to take on them.” Castiel said pulling away from Dean. He was careful to pull Dean away from his head watching the green eyes blink open looking bleary like he just woke up.
That is it, I hope you guys enjoyed this chapter as well as this story. I really enjoyed this story, I started it on a whim, but I have to say I adore this dark universe.
“Ready? Come on.” Sam said leading the two in and looking around. When they were sat down the three talked but more were listening in doing their best to hear what was going on. It wasn't until they were having after-dinner coffee, and a piece of pie of course for Dean that something happened.
There were wardings all along the bunker, more than he knew the Men of Letters had done, purposefully pushing away angels and gods. But there was some impressive rune work that made just one exception, Castiel. Luckily for him they had never thought about the possibility of different universes, so it allowed Castiel, any Castiel, in, including himself.
“No way in hell.”
“Okay man, see you there; thanks man-you really saved my ass.” Dean hung up and moved the phone back and gave the woman a grin. “Thanks a lot, hun, you’re a life saver.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean remained silent.
“Sam, Sugar Cube, yes!” He panted helplessly holding the sheets underneath him. He pulled Gabriel's shirt off, the archangel lifted his arms helping him take it off before being pushed down to lay flat on his back. “Sammy~” he complained as Sam was starting to take off his shirt but paused and looked down and smirked.
“Sam!” Dean yelled and suddenly Castiel was beside him touching Dean's forehead and disappearing and when they came to they looked around seeing they were inside a colonial house.
I have to tell you guys that it is a pain writing both Castiel’s, and I really hope that this twist worked, I am not that experienced with twists so please tell me if I succeeded?
“We'd be separated,” the newly named Sabriel said. It had never needed before, they were the boys, children, to Mary and Bobby while they were dad, the parent, to Violet and Jacob.
“How did he know my name?” She’d be locking her doors and windows extra tight tonight.
“I know man, I know,” Castiel had been hurt just as much. He was almost afraid to see what he would do to the other version of him. Sam was mad and had some choice words for the thing that took his brother, it was not Castiel as far as he was concerned, but still there was a certain amount that was similar between the two. He was a Castiel from another universe, but the question was what did he want?
“Don’t invite me to have some pie and coffee man.” The demon teased and Dean rolled his eyes at his alter.
“A collar.”
With Gabriel he knew it was the archangel wanting to say something. And also he hadn't baked a pie in sixteen or seventeen years. Maybe even eighteen. Hell he couldn't even say the last time he had baked at all. But he was now doing it with Castiel he wanted the pie to be as good as possible.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It's okay Dean, it's me.” He promised and Dean's eyes widened as he realized what he had said, what Cas must have heard. Castiel could see as Dean brought his walls up around his heart trying to protect it.
“That fast?” Dean questioned sitting down and Castiel let out a chuckle.
“It’s okay. I will wait. I’ll wait as long as you need.” Dean sneered but allowed the scarred angel-turned-god to usher him upstairs. Unlike the downstairs this was all plush carpet. The first two rooms were matching in almost every way and were rooms. They had cream carpet and were painted, one was painted a sky blue and one was a light mint green and there was a white dresser, bed, mirror, and two nightstands in each the only difference being one had light blue blankets on the single bed and one had light green.
“Don't worry Dean, it's just because I'm older.” He assured and Dean nodded still seeming put out but with a big smile to him Dean was back to normal chuckling and tugging him away from the room to play a game of tag.
“Good.” Gabriel smiled and reached out to ruffle Castiel's hair, the black wings swatted at one of his golden wings which he swatted back good naturedly.
“So Dean...I know that you are protective of Sammy.” He looked away and sighed, “and I know that I hurt him by pretending to be dead and not letting him know I was okay.” Dean was not expecting this, the sugar fiend-and to be called that by Dean spoke volumes!-looked more serious then he had ever seen him. “But I do care for Sam, and I would never let him be hurt.” Gabriel explained and Dean held back a chuckle from what this made him think of.
The two spent sixty years in Death's Domain, where all the reapers hang out when not reaping, and this place was Dean, Death's, home. Now Castiel was ready because he had to head back. Dean had kissed him passionately before letting him out of his grasp, bringing him back.
“So where do you want to go Samshine?” Gabriel asked Sam stroking his hair out of his face.
Gabriel was left standing still as he watched the witch leave, how long had he been asleep? Groaning he shook, he had to find Sam, find his Sam. Searching out for him he could almost think that he wasn’t able to find Sam.
Wow...that was...that was heavy. I hope I did okay showing that.
“You-you’re one of them!” She yelled out reaching for her gun, Castiel allowed her since it would do nothing to him. “I won’t tell you!” That however, he did react to. His anger getting out of hand he grabbed her by the shoulder throwing her down on the ground.
“What's wrong Gabriel?” Sam asked as it didn't make sense to him, “I have demon's blood. If you mean what you say that I have a 'heart of gold' then somehow I have it despite the blood.” Sam shook his head, that was one of the reasons that he didn't really believe that he had a golden heart.
“Oh Dean, finally I can truly protect you.” Castiel said with a proud smile and sparkling eyes, he reminded Dean of a kid that was showing off something that they were proud of. “Nothing will touch you and if they do…” he trailed off before a slow dangerous smile took over his face and his eyes were that full on white once again, “I’ll destroy them.”
Dean sat down and hummed from the meal. Castiel was happy enough to just eat in silence, they would have time later. Castiel waited until the fries were mostly demolished and he only had about two bites left of his cheeseburger that Castiel spoke up.
Still they didn't know how long, time moved very differently in heaven. One day in heaven could pass in the time that it took for Earth to go through three years, or fifty years could pass in heaven before a single 24 hour period could happen in Earth. It could be either of these things or some combination of any infinite options.
I love the friendhsip of Dean and Gabriel. And destiel and sabriel. I love writing this so much.
“Because it's not like with you and Gabe, I know you do to.” Dean shook his head, “you're good for him, maybe even too good. But Cas...Cas deserves so much better. Someone worth staying around for.”
(See the end of the chapter for
However Sam's horrified gasp brought Dean out of his swirling dark thoughts and he looked up shocked. He didn't need to hear the rest of the conversation to know what they were talking about.
“Heh, okay you got dibs,” he chuckled and went back to his eating but still would do a few bit of flirting to Castiel. It wasn’t even half an hour later that Dean got up and left, Castiel watched him frowning and jumped as he felt something near his ear.
“Yeah, and we have bosses who doesn't mind us taking off whenever?” Dean pointed out and Sam shook his head and smiled.
- - - - -
“It's okay, my dearest, they know you went to hell and back for them, they are grateful even if you failed to.” Castiel promised holding him close. Somehow they all calmed down, Sam having gone through the same thing seeing so many who had died, and it was soon time just as sundown was happening.
“What did you take from him?” Castiel demanded taking the paper back from the other version of himself, who like him earlier didn’t even seem to notice that the paper was taken from him. When Sam tugged on it Castiel let go allowing Sam to read through it.
“Dean won’t do anything to you. I won’t let him,” Sam promised, and Gabriel chuckled a bit and battered his forehead softly against Sam’s jaw.
So instead Dean and Castiel sat down side by side and Dean showed him some of the movies so Castiel might be able to understand his pop culture references. Castiel had decided on E.T. since Dean had once called him that.
“Only if you kill me to. Seriously I raised Cassie from a fledgling. I never wanted to hear that.” Gabriel said and Sam grunted rubbing the tension in his head, hoping he could prevent a headache.
“Not as ancient as I. And you take on that human form.” He laughed and glared at him and Castiel frowned, he might have changed this form a bit, allowing it to be his true form, every part of it was him, the form that his Dean had loved.
“Library?”
“You thought I would…that I didn’t feel the same?”
“Dean didn’t mean it. It’s not enough to just say the words, you have to mean them.” Gabriel sighed and moistened his lips, “you remember Mael?”
“Yeah.” Dean agreed and it was easy to say more now that he admitted it. Just like the first time he told him that he needed him. For Dean admitting he needed him was not easy, hard to admit that he needed anything especially not a person. And though he wasn't going to run away saying it he had no problem saying things that showed exactly how much he needed the angel of Thursday in his life. Beside him.
Dean growled as he carved out the very obscene words into the wall. Scar Castiel had claimed to Dean that he had a ‘present’ for him to ‘keep him entertained when he had to go somewhere’ and when Dean had glared Castiel had taken it as sadness for this thing wearing his best friend’s skin had smiled and touched his face. ‘Don’t worry, my adored, I won’t leave too often but sometimes there are just things that need to be done.’
“I don’t know man,” he let out a frustrated groan, “I couldn’t have been dead for a year before you were gone.” Dean shook his head, “if I’m that replaceable than what’s the point of wanting to try again with me.” Before Castiel could speak again Dean was gone.
Then he saw his reflection in the green eyes of his mate. Not James Novak's body. Him. Castiel. His true form. Dean was seeing him. His three heads, three pairs of wings, and just how big he was compared to Dean.
Somehow that hope doesn't help him and he worries about little Violet and her little brother Jacob. That it wouldn't happen. They had no one. He didn't know how he knew but somehow deep down he just knew. Dean froze up, looking up his green eyes met Sam's hazel, he could feel it to.
Yay for Sabriel. I love me some Destiel but enjoy getting to go through some Sam and Gabe to.
“Yes, I do that. I need to talk to you about Dean Winchester.” He said and she gasped as she realized he was not human.
He started searching out for the souls of Mary Winchester or John Winchester and neither were there and he hummed, wondering if they were dead or never born, he supposed that was possible; one or the other not having been born for whatever reason. He would worry later and tried the simplest thing to see if there was any chance. The first thing he did was looking up any fires, the one thing he knows considering all of the other universes the best chance of a Dean that is like his Dean. Looking through the papers for any home fires in 1983, he’d start in Kansas and keep going seeing as some universes the Winchesters had lived in different places then Kansas. He jumped seeing the first headline was about the ‘mysterious house fire’ that took the life of one Mary Winchester leaving behind her husband, John, and their two sons, Dean and Sam.
This got really serious really fast. And it will keep getting more serious, I know I've been ignoring the whole 'hunter' thing. If you want hunting watch the show, I want to explore other parts of these lovely boys. But as far as I remember it never really looks at something like this, losing parents like this. I hope you guys liked this. I'm now in the situation where I kind of want to finish this story up and have it wrapped up, but at the same time I kind of don't want it to end.
Gabriel pushed the door closed not bothering to worry about locking the door as it is more of a formality anyway considering how many wards and sigils he had protecting it. “Kisses okay then?” He asked and as Sam smirked and raised an eyebrow Gabriel pulled him close to him, jumping up to wrap his legs around Sam's hips, making his face hover over Sam's.
He still felt like someone had reached into his grace and was squeezing it with unforgiving fists whenever he saw Dean and the alternative version of himself be intimate. When they were staring into each other’s eyes, the other Castiel getting to see Dean’s soul, the god could still remember when he first got a glance of it, covered in the blood of the serial killer he had just finished on his own rack, when he cradled Dean in his grace and when he first got to really see him back in his element fresh from a hunting trip. Now he would never look into his mate’s eyes again, they were burnt out. Seeing Dean and the other version of himself kiss, hold hands, cook together-more like Dean teaching the angel to cook, all of it, things he would never have. Still he owed Dean this, both this universe’s Dean and his husband. He glanced and saw Sam as well as Gabriel.
Woods. Of course, this crazy scarred son of a bitch had to take him to the woods. Still he knew how to navigate and so he started going, he knew if he went straight for long enough, he’d reach civilization, unless he found a river which he would follow instead, but till then go straight.
I got to be honest if you guys are reading this I reworked this chapter like twice to keep it from sounding too close to the only other story for this au there is (Sir Catherine is writing one and that’s only as far as I found so if you know more please tell me! I love this au and can’t get enough, which is why I’m writing this).
Violet was going to start taking self defense lessons when she had her eighth birthday so that she could learn to defend herself, Jacob would as well when he was eight. Not from monsters as much as to make sure that people would not be able to hurt them. Demons they got, people were crazy. Demons, werewolves, weindigos, women in white, all of these things had patterns, rules, reasons, people had no rules, no patterns, no reason, they were just crazy.
“What?” Dark universe Castiel frowned and the other Castiel turned to him and glared.
Okay this is the last official chapter but there is an epilogue that is coming. If you prefer a bittersweet ending don’t read it, but there is still more to come for Team Free Will from the Dark Verse yet.
“I'm more than just a pretty face and sweet ass baby, I might not read up on history just to but I do learn and remember things that are important.” Dean explained and Castiel smiled leaning up to press his lips to his husbands, stealing a sweet kiss.
“Dean…” Castiel again tried to reach out to Dean but the only thing he got was a glare for his troubles, his eyes once again inky darkness.
“This early?” Sam asked and Gabriel nodded humming.
The next universe he went to he easily found Dean; she was probably the closest version he had seen so far. But not quiet. She was for some reason sitting in front of a camera. “My name is Deandre Winchester. My brother is Samantha and Marcus Winchester is my dad, and Casti…” she paused before giving the warmest smiles, “she’s the love of my life.” Castiel could not help but smile, even though she was not talking about him, not really, it was for the first time warming him.
“Listen Samshine,” Gabriel whispered as they finished heading back to the house, “Castiel and I may be physically stronger then you hunters but you call the shots.” He looked away from him looking but not, lost in his own thoughts. “We angels are possessive Sammy,” he then chuckled, “single angels share everything, but when it comes to bonded pairs we are possessive. I don't know how Cassie held back for so long but he did.” He looked over at Sam and smiled, “you be ours; Dean is Castiel's and you are mine, and in exchange we are yours to.”
“You haven't told me you are ready yet.” Like that Dean relaxed, he knew already that Castiel would stop if he told him to, but having this proof calmed him even more and the tension eased.
“My necklace-or the alternative one’s yeah, but not my ring, it was a...a wedding ring. I think.”
“Yeah,” Sam answered his brother's half stated question. “First time we went up against a psychic, it was just a kid.” Sam shook his head and roughly rubbed his forehead, “I got a flash of him killing Dean, I screamed and my emotions were so...so...”
Sam and Gabriel were watching them and the trickster chuckled. “They are cute, aren't they?”
“I swear Dean, I'm surprised you didn't want to be a mechanic.” Sam said as Dean took a deep breath and sighed, putting the wrench down, “I used to, do like Bobby, maybe even make a junkyard where I can remake cars.” He shook his head and Sam looked down thinking back to the man who was an uncle in all ways but blood to them, acted more like a father than John Winchester did.
That name, when they decided on it, made Dean snigger. They were planning to call it East of Eden, Campbell's, Novak's, or even Winchester's where they could claim it was extended family. They went through a lot of names, but in the end they settled on The Angel's Nest.
“I’m well aware of that Sammy, but I still want to check it out, at least for a little while.” He shrugged, “I’m going to be heading out soon, I didn’t get back my necklace yet, but I wanted to make a meal first.”
He began trembling slightly and looking at him with wide eyes. Dean saw and jumped to the, wrong, conclusion, “oh, I see.”
“Hey Sam,”
It is about time we got some Sabriel since the last few chapters had been heavy Destiel.
“Oh darling, if only you were my love.” Gabriel pulled away as if he had been slapped but then his lips were on the archangel’s. That had Gabriel ripping from Sam once again.
“Huh. Must be one of the things that are different between universes. Apple is good but not as much as blueberry.” He shrugged, “whatever, like I said keep an eye out. See ya babe,” Dean winked and was about to go before Castiel spoke up.
“Dean?” The green eyed man stopped what he was doing, cutting off his acoustic rendition of Eye of the Tiger.
“Better than scar face, maybe call me ‘baby’?” Castiel hummed and smiled seeing his reaction, it was so cute. “But don’t worry Dean, I have paid attention and made sure your body’s system is kept regular.” Castiel promised and Dean groaned before looking around where he is.
It didn't matter that he and Cas were too different and could never be together; that Cas was an angel and Dean a mortal. That through Dean Castiel had been destroyed over and over again. That it would be better for the angel if he never ran into Dean. That Castiel could do so much better then him.
“They'd be cool moving two states away? For a bakery job?” Dean asked raising a eyebrow and Gabriel shrugged.
Both angels were humbled with the love from their children. Leaning over they each kissed the children's forehead's lovingly. “We love you guys.” Gabriel whispered squeezing Jacob extra tight, as tight as he could without hurting him, while Castiel pressed his face against the blue and pink color Violet had. The last time she had this color at seventeen Dean had teased her that her hair was like cotton candy.
“Yes. Grace, Bella and?” He waited patiently for Dean to think as he did so.
“Hey, don’t get all sentimental on me, I still am not going to be your little doll.” Dean shook his head before sighing, “come on, let’s get a drink.”
Besides Gabriel did have a point and maybe Castiel will enjoy picking on out. “Yeah, well then come on Cas. Say goodbye to Grace we'll go get her a sister.”
And finding this stuff out was not where Sam would react favorably.
But now, now he was seeing the leather cord, he knew it well, it was once slightly rough but after decades of use the leather had become soft and supple. The metal that could be very cold but warmed quickly, it was smooth but sharp if it pressed against him just right. The one thing he didn’t know was the ring, it wasn’t the ring that he once wore on his finger, one of the few things that was a sentimental value to him but was something from his own, not being a gift from someone else; but this ring was not that one that was on his hand.
“Wh-“ he tried to turn but something hit him, and his world went black and the last thing he thought was ‘not again’.
“You've forgotten Cas? We got together on the nineteenth of June last year.” Dean chuckled thinking back and hummed his eyes glancing to the falling leaves. “So that means that it's been...fifteen months?”
He wore a pair of jeans, sleek boots, a silky black button up, and equally black tie. He wore a jacket that looked familiar and took a moment for Castiel to realize why it was-it was Dean’s leather jacket-and remembering what Dean had told him he could see the hint of leather cord of the necklace that would hold his amulet and a ring.
“Dean?” Sam called and Dean relaxed before looking around. “Where are we?” Sam asked looking over to Gabriel who grinned.
“What-“ Castiel didn’t get a chance to finish his question before Dean continued on.
“What? Why?” Dean asked and the demon pursed his lips.
Was he in someone's house?
“So Sugar Cube, what's been bothering you?” Gabriel asked Sam as he stroked through the long brown hair. Three of his six wings were cradling Sam but it was way too hot right now for extreme cuddling like Gabriel wanted to do. But instead his grace was stroking along Sam's body and it was like a phantom limb was petting his mate.
“Cas acted like...like he was a-forgive the pun-avenging angel. I never saw him look so human either, so worried. No, not worried. Scared.” Sam finished and the ironic part was that both brothers were having a conversation with the angel that cared so much for them but didn't see their brother. Entrapped by blue and golden eyes.
“That isn't what Gabe told me last night.” He said with a smirk and leer that made Gabriel proud but had Dean confused before it all clicked and he gave a yell.
Castiel led Dean back around through the foyer that other than a large staircase and archways that led through to the kitchen and the other he was leading Dean to plus there was another door that Dean figured would go outside, a front door. Castiel led Dean into a large entertainment system, on one side against the wall was not only a large record player but also a guitar propped up against the burnt umber wall. There was a cream couch in a square in a sunken living room style.  “Whose house is this?”
Something was very wrong.
I know it is short but I absolutely love this chapter. Does anyone else just love domestic Winchester boys and their angels?
“They’re Cas’s favorite.” Dean said in way of answer, and to him that was an answer and Sam couldn’t help but grin. For the longest time he thought of Dean as nothing but a womanizer, a love-em-and-leave-em kind of guy. But seeing him with Castiel was like seeing an entire side of his brother that he had never seen nor thought would exist.
“I sometimes make trips up to heaven, not often enough to cause suspicion but I couldn't resist going into your heaven.” Gabriel mentioned and Sam raised an eyebrow, waiting for him to continue. “I know you love your brother, so why wasn't he in there?” Gabriel asked and Sam's eyes widened, he knew that Dean had seen it but as his brother never spoke about it Sam had not needed to either.
Sam looked down and he hated to admit it but that did calm him some. The fact remained that Gabriel was extremely strong, without holy oil he wouldn't stand a chance against him. He learned while he still thought that Gabriel was Loki that the-who he then thought demigod-was unrealistically strong. He couldn't see Gabriel ever doing it but still he was relieved to hear it.
It took him time to look past the normal amount as the wings spread out all the way being huge. Logically it made sense as it would have to carry a full grown human, as angels were always thought to look like humans but with wings and a halo. So the wings would have to be large to get enough wind. His mind was always analytical, he thought while Dean worked more on instinct, which while 'college boy' and someone working so much with his instincts shouldn't work, especially such a dangerous profession as the family business but it worked perfectly.
“Couch duty? Sam and I aren't together.” He muttered but somehow the squirrel's hearing caught it.
- - - - -
“Nice place,” Dean hummed seeing the loft that he and Castiel would be staying at, a place that Castiel had managed to get a hold of. It wasn't a huge thing but was like a proper hotel, with pictures and crisp sheets, as opposed to the motels that Dean was raised in. Far from a well made loft.
I know this is kind of campy but I love it, some nice Sabriel to.
“What in the world do you mean?” Dean pushed but Gabriel answered with just a smirk enjoying getting under the skin of the hunter he always found several kinds of annoying. He could see the two of them getting along but that didn't mean that he didn't want to mess with the older of the Winchester brothers.
Castiel looked back when he heard a sound but there was nothing, he wasn’t worried as he could defend himself from anything. He put his hand up to his necklace, clinging to it, he wouldn’t lose Dean, not again. Never again.
Castiel and Gabriel were both acting on pure instinct as they did that. They were making sure that their mates were safe. They warded it against every single thing they could think of. And that included what Gabriel, the third ever angel to exist who would always try to play mediator to Micheal and Lucifer even if they never listened.
“What are you going to name him Sam?” Gabriel asked and Sam raised an eyebrow tugging Gabriel's hair a bit teasingly.
“Cas?” Dean asked and it Castiel looked at Dean and wished he didn't have to tell him, that it could be different. He wanted to first assure Dean that it didn't matter, that the bond didn't matter and he'd be whatever Dean wanted. And if Dean only saw him as a brother that was what he would be to him.
With the goodbyes said the angels flew off. Heaven time and earth time moved at different speeds and would be gone if only a day or two would be gone a week on earth. The cover story they would tell any nosy neighbors-like that one extremely nosy Mrs. Veanien who had nothing better to do with her life than peek over neighbors fences and screech about how she has children and doesn't want them to see homosexual relationships.
“No more speaking like that; I’ve loved you since you stood up to me and showed me what it was to have free will, to be alive for the first time since I was created.” Dean didn’t want to look into those white eyes when he heard that, he wanted to hear that looking into those clear blue eyes he loved.
- - - - -
“Careful what you promise baby,” this time Castiel couldn’t hold back the happy shudder to hear the well-remembered and even more sorely missed pet name. How he longed to hear Dean calling him baby again, hell he would take buddy even, having his Dean as just a friend was better than Dean being gone, but he might have his husband back. The knight got the slightest bit closer, now as he spoke his lips just barely brushed Castiel’s “you’re going to have to prove I can trust you.” And suddenly Dean was back, far away from him that Castiel half expected him to bring up personal space.
“Of course my sweet mate.” Sam whispered doing as Gabriel had begged him to do and the archangel moaned for the sensation which was finally the more that he had been begging for just as much as he moaned for hearing Sam say the word mate.
“You can’t expect me to stay here forever man, food will run out, I’ll go crazy, something.” Dean groaned and Castiel calmed down relaxing more.
“Gabriel? How are you alive?” Dean was the first to actually form words to question the archangel.
“What?” Sam asked glaring at Dean who looked at him giving him the look the look his older brother had given him since he was a child. The one that said 'idiot; just follow along with what I say and keep safe.'
It was a two story home, a nice little dollhouse style home. The first floor would have a porch, a hallway to come into, a living room, kitchen, dining room, a little breakfast nook, a half bathroom and a den. Of course they built in places where plenty of weapons could be stored for easy access just in case as well as three possible entrances to the bunker. These were warded the most heavily and the only people who could possibly get through those would be the beloved hunters as well as anyone they wanted to come in, only those they wanted so none could threaten them in.
“So, I’ll always have you, my beloved.” He whispered to the corpse, but it brought him no happiness. His Dean was gone.
“A mate is precious, not a pet.” Castiel gently reproached him, “they are the most precious thing to any angel.”
“You do?”
“I want to go back to the hotel.”
Dean and Sam looked around and found that they were for some reason in a really weird place. It wasn't hell, both having been there enough times to be able to tell it wasn't hell. It wasn't purgatory as Dean easily could see, and it was not heaven either. This place they were was not anything they had ever seen, so it couldn't be heaven. So...where were they?
Well this was one huge thing to show that he was committed to Dean. Dean couldn’t help but feel that maybe Castiel was bluffing so he nodded. “Okay than.” He agreed and moved forward to place the collar around Castiel’s neck. Castiel did not flinch, he only tilted his chin up, making it easier for Dean to affix the collar around his neck. As soon as it was affixed into place Castiel fell to his knees, Dean frowned not at all liking that, sure he wanted Castiel on his knees, wanted him to feel the pain he did but he was now his and only his.
“Peace Dean.” He assured and it spoke more to Dean than anything that he did as Castiel obviously wanted and sat down on the opposite bed. Even Dean having told him that he needed him, this showed even more trust, how much trust he would show to his angel.
“No.” Dean looked right into his eyes, “if they can’t accept it, they shouldn’t be here, and I don’t want to wait to be your husband till they come around.” He then gave a wink, “when they come around, we can have our reception.” Castiel smiled back, soon Dean would be his husband, he would be Castiel Winchester. It was a pretty sure thing, angels didn’t have last names and it felt wrong to ask Dean to take on the name Novak, which was the closest thing he could do, instead he would take the name Winchester. He would hear Dean’s name ever time he heard his own.
For the first time in years Castiel finally could settle down in a bed with his hunter, warm and alive and happy in his arms. He settled down beside him to enjoy the soft sleepy breathing of Dean.
- - -
Dean didn't react violently, yelling at him or anything. He trusted Castiel enough not to immediately go on the defensive. That was always true, even when Castiel was acting strange, at the time he didn't know and could never in a million years have thought he'd be working with Crowley of all people, but trusted him enough to ignore his instincts instead fighting against every one of his hunter honed instincts to insist that they trust him. It was true, Castiel had gone to hell and back for them plenty of times, had broken rank for them, he deserved the benefit of the doubt, and he did. Despite how hard it hit when he realized that Castiel had betrayed them he couldn't find it in him to not trust him now.
“I like him to.” Sam whispered pressing his face against the dog. They did adopt him, buying the leash, chew toys, bags to pick up his poop, brush, shampoo to wash him, dog food and bowls and everything else.
“Older brother privileges.” Dean chuckled and the angels watch their mates with smiles on their faces from the brotherly bonding.
“Yeah man, I’m fine, so’s Cas.” Dean chuckled, “we’re going to hang out for a little while, take a bit of a vacation, you should to. Love you Sam.” Dean hung up and sighed, “he’s going to be so pissed at me.”
Sam laid on his back, putting one arm to cushion his head and Gabriel, much smaller, climbed onto the side of Sam, laying on his side to place his head onto Sam's chest, to pillow his head. He hummed as Sam wrapped his free arm around Gabriel and the archangel laid his own arm over Sam's chest.
“Few weeks? You mean Scar Cas?” Dean froze up, how did anyone even know that? He wasn’t part of this universe, so who could this be?
“Wh-okay Cas.” Dean manages to guffaw past his laugh and smiled at Castiel.
“No, no, none of that.” Gabriel pouted finishing off one of the pies, “we get a day or two just to be with our mate before you two go to a new gig.”
“Very funny bitch, I just got something to decorate the rooftop, it was looking a little overly green.”
“Don’t worry my beloved, just a moment,” his eyes started to turn white and Dean shook his head.
- - - - -
“They aren't demons fully but close enough; almost immortal, feed off of the soul energy through the filter of psychic energy.” His wings fluttered as he began flying towards the hotel of the Winchester brothers were staying at.
He began breathing fast and made a quick flight, fast as light zipping from one room to the other, thinking maybe he got it wrong and would have to find another way to find Dean but no. No Dean was not in the house, anywhere.
There were still stories of the fabled Winchester brothers, what was still slowly coming to realize in hunter circles of the Winchester siblings, it was known to anyone who knew Sam and Dean Winchester that Violet and Jacob was indeed related to them, family business was the family business.
“Except that.” No. No, no, no, it was because of Sam that his Dean had died. He had lost Dean once because of him, he would not lose him again. He could never forgive himself, but he wouldn’t lose his hunter again. Never again.
“Whose house is this?” Castiel almost laughed, that was much easier than he thought he would ask him.
He began walking down the stairs hearing voices suddenly go hushed, but soon heard the footsteps that entered the room and saw Jack and Sam. “Castiel!” Jack was obviously worried heading to him to check him over while Sam watched with wide hazel eyes.
But if she were to do that then she needed to know what was out there.
Sam had heard classmates talking about from-scratch homemade goodies. Cookies and cakes mostly but he had always thought of pie as that was what he wanted, he wanted to join in and as none had talked about made from scratch pie that is what he wanted.
“Will do babe,” Dean smiled, “but now that we’re all calmed down, we can go and explain everything to them.” Dean promised him and Castiel relaxed and nodded.
“Sam came and we split up, I can get him, we should head back to the bunker as soon as possible.” He finished undoing Dean’s bounds seeing him roll his shoulders, “I doubt that he will remain. His business was the other version of me only.” Castiel succeeded and frowned as he saw the angry red marks on Dean’s wrist but the man didn’t even look at it, only rubbing them quickly to help the circulation and then began to work on his ankles which were a lot easier since they were not tied even half as tightly or intricately.
“Thanks guys, I made pumpkin pie last night, have at it,” Dean winked, he knew full well that was one of their favorites.
So despite the fact his instincts were telling him to push the archangel away from his baby brother and protect him but held back.
Castiel soon found him, it still took longer than he should, and he would be able to change around the runes slightly. He knew the runes well, the exact ones that he had carved into his Dean’s ribs but since he hadn’t been the one technically to carve into this universe’s Dean’s ribs, he couldn’t find it. When Dean rested Castiel would figure something out to carve into his breastbone, something that would claim this beautiful man as his.
“You stay the hell away from me!” Dean growled and Castiel was struck again with it, he thought he was making progress.
(See the end of the chapter for
He was suddenly reminded of why Sam had a fear of Tuesday; he knew that whenever a Tuesday came he for the longest time watched over Dean with that worried look in his eyes. His older brother instincts started to kick in and he headed to stop him but Castiel was there suddenly ushering him away from them to the other bed.
“He's my cherry pie~” Gabriel started singing gently pulling Sam, who was still finishing up the last of his side salad, Buddy was laying at Sam's feet waiting for scraps that the tall man would not give him. Despite all of them being nice to the dog; they all loved him and he loved his people back, but Sam was by far his favorite. It was only Sam who he'd come running to greet when he saw him again, even if Sam had only been gone for five minutes to the bathroom, and would follow him around whenever he could.
“Are you okay?”
When the oven had heated to four hundred degrees Fahrenheit he picked it up putting it in the oven and Gabriel set the oven timer to fifty minutes. “Now we wait.” Gabriel mused before turning to Dean and Dean raised an eyebrow. If the trickster didn't know better he'd think that Dean knew that he had wanted to talk to the older Winchester brother.
He wouldn't say it, but he knew that Castiel knew.
Still outside gave him at least the illusion of privacy, it was possible he really did have that privacy, but he didn’t know and he trusted his instincts. Though he had the same face he didn’t earn the loyalty that kept Dean. He knew when he was in the bathroom at least he knew he was alone in the bathroom. That just made him find the feeling that he was being watched even when outside made him sure that it really was happening.
“No.” Castiel put his hand down when Dean was obviously not going to take it, “come.” Dean grumbled and complained but did as he was asked. Castiel began to move from one room to the other, the house was three floors the ground one was all hard wood except the kitchen and half bath were both in tile. Castiel tried to put his hand on the small of Dean’s back but he pulled away and he respected his wishes, he knew Dean and knew that he couldn’t push Dean to accept him, it would only push him away.
It went without saying that it was one of the things that had captured Castiel's heart.
Castiel made sure that no humans were paying attention when he put the bags in a pocket dimension, there was no where on the bike to put them. He had come to love the feel of an automobile and so he put on the gloves and the helmet before driving back to the home.
“Hm, angels. Well I was just coming to get some help with these darling hunters.” He then took a step back revealing the children that the brothers had just been talking about.
“Oh…okay, just one hunt.”
“You are good Dean.” Castiel whispered wrapping his arm around Dean's body. “They understand that you can't save everyone, even though you try, you can't. They know you did everything you could. They want to be here to be with you.” Castiel promised pressing his lips to Dean's temple in absolute care, wiping his tears away. For once Dean did not feel weak the few times he had cried.
“Yeah, so he is different, he seems pretty in control of himself,” that was another sticking point, especially since Castiel didn’t understand how it was that this version of himself could control the purgatory souls. What had he done wrong then? Opening the doors were wrong, but was there a way he could have done it and not destroyed so many? “but you can remember that time, right? So, can you like, I don’t know man, think about that time and if you were like obsessed with Dean where you’d have taken him in that situation?”
He turned and walked up to the woman, he was reasonably sure she was because every human had at least a hint of a trace of magic and he could sense what magic and it was a woman’s magic. “Excuse me, have you seen this man?” He had taken, besides the clothing on his back, his Book of Shadows and the picture of them. It once had been a picture of Sam, Dean, Castiel and Bobby. The explosion that had killed Dean had also killed Bobby and blinded Sam. It had been Bobby in his wheel chair, Castiel standing stiffly beside him, beside Castiel was Dean with a grin and an arm thrown around Castiel’s shoulder and at the end beside Dean was Sam. Rowena, who had taught him how to use his naturally strong magic, had also agreed to and had cut Castiel out of the picture for him and drawn a cross of Bobby’s head.
“Dude you don’t love me, you shouldn’t lie about that.”
“Are you having second thoughts?” Castiel was mostly teasing but it was an honest question. Dean was his, he knew Dean Winchester was his, the moment that he had gripped him so tight in perdition, when he felt how easily and instinctively Dean’s soul burrowed into his grace. He didn’t need anything but that, though he would like to claim his human mate the human way.
“There, now you'll be safe.” Castiel said looking right into Dean's eyes, or at least what he thought would be looking into his eyes. “Safe and sound,” Castiel reached out with his hand, brushing his knuckles down Dean’s face from his temple down to his jawline. He was smiling so very gently his eyes were back to blue and Dean could almost trick himself into thinking that opening the door to Purgatory had not affected him. Of course he couldn’t because that eyeless look was burned into his head, but Castiel was looking at him gently and as relaxed as Dean had ever seen him; those few times they got to be just the two of them, just best friends instead of a hunter and an angel trying to save the world or doing some hunt. Castiel seemed more than happy to just keep looking into Dean’s eyes, the same way the two of them had done a hundred times before and he didn’t think he could break the spell, but that was before Sam gripped Castiel’s arm.
“I wish,” both men looked at Dean like he had grown a second and third head, as far as either knew Dean was fully heterosexual so should not be interested in experiencing a sexual encounter with a different universe’s version of himself and Castiel. “That would make things a lot simpler, I could have just said no thanks or done it and been out he…his Dean died.”
He laughed weakly, “nice to know your image of me includes a big dick.” He said, wincing as the joke fell flat.
He felt his way to the cupboard where they kept their glasses, and then to the kitchen sink, his hands out in front of him like he was performing some stupid, mock ballet as he navigated his way though the dark.
But, turning to look over his shoulder, Dean realised that Cas was already asleep.
“It’s not a big deal,” he said, avoiding Mary’s gaze.
An easy smile from Jack, "remember, Dean. Raindrops. I'll be everywhere."
Without looking anyone in the eye, she sat down opposite Cas at the table and cradled her chin in her hands, shoulders slumping. Sam followed, sitting down next to her, stiff and awkward.
“Yeah.” Dean said, “yeah, she’s my mom.”
Oh. Well, Dean supposed he’d been a little slow on the uptake with that one. Not interested in women. Right. Noted.
“I know.” Sam said, “I know, just- can you get to the bunker? We’re gonna be there in a few hours. I need to see you.”
"Look," he said, 'Jack - you don't have to do this. You can come home with us, learn to use your new powers somewhere safe."
“Dean,” Cas said, catching his attention, “you still haven’t told me what happened.”
“I thought you were dead.” Cas said, tone a little more accusatory than you’d normally use on someone who just had a near death experience.
“No!” Jack answered, too fast, “not if he’s asleep. He’s human now, I don’t want to-”
But Cas extended his smile to him, seeming to light the entire room with it, glowing from the inside out, “thank you, Dean.”
“How?”
“And The Empty?” He asked, after a moment.
“But, I’m still-” Dean had to pause for a second, swallowing around the sudden dryness in his throat, “this isn’t a trick. I am who I say I am.”
Dean cleared his throat, feeling a little self conscious, like he was witnessing something private. He thought that maybe he should leave, go back to bed.
They stared at each other for a long moment, eyes meeting for real for the first time since Cas had gotten back.
“Yeah, well-” Dean reached out hopelessly to grasp Cas’ shoulder but decided against it at the last second, dropping his hand to his side and curling it into a fist.
Cas sat up a little straighter, “Sam.”
“Cas.” He murmured, rubbing his eyes, “look, we did what we could. It wasn’t an easy fight, it was
"Wait," Dean cut him off, his mouth dry, "when you said you brought everyone back-"
And then there was a burst of light, and the kitchen was fully illuminated, and Dean realised he wasn’t alone.
“Cas?” He called into the seemingly empty bunker, “Cas?”
“Are things going to be okay?” Cas asked, nodding towards the door, “with you and her?”
“No, I-”
Sam didn’t grace that with a response - he shook his head and leaned back in his seat, smiling to himself. Dean wondered whether he was picturing a future - a future with Eileen, with children and a house and not a monster in sight. It was a nice thought. Unrealistic, though. Dean knew that by now; something would always come to pull the two of them back in.
Instead, he launched himself across the room at Cas, sitting him up, making sure he was solid, drinking it all in. He just had to feel him, just to be sure.
Slowly, he approached the table, crouching so he was eye-to-eye with Jack. Jack’s gaze fell on him and he stopped staring, his eyes widening like he hadn’t even noticed Dean was in the room with him.
He heard Cas shift, like he was going to reach out for Dean but had thought better of it. The room suddenly felt cold, like a ghost had passed through. Dean shivered.
“I don’t know - everything? Chucks gone, everyone’s back on Earth. You even got Cas back.”
“Well, yes. It’s been nearly forty years, Dean.”
Dean jumped, “no!” He said, “no, Jack - look, there’s no harm done. Cas’ll be so happy to see you.”
Dean sighed and met Cas’ gaze once again. And, together, in that silent moment, they made a decision.
He wanted to convince him to stay.
“Dean?”
But, now, without the haze of layers of grief and guilt, and with that box suddenly unlocked, only the fact remained: Cas loved him.
“You scared the shit out of me, man,” he said, hand on Cas’ cheek, “Jesus, I thought-” he couldn’t even bring himself to say it.
Dean felt a little weight lift from his chest - Cas could handle this far better than him, everything would be alright once he was here. They’d shake him awake, frantic but not grim, and Cas would smile, and they’d work things out.
“Yes.” Jack said, suddenly, “there’s a way.
“She didn’t recognise me,” he said slowly, “I’ve changed a lot since then.”
He needed a glass of water.
Jack’s smile faltered, but he nodded and stood up, following Dean as they left the kitchen together.
Dean looked around, trying to guess where Cas could’ve gone. It wasn’t like he’d need a snack, or to use the bathroom - Dean swore he’d once seen him reading the same book for two days straight, only moving to turn pages, and only stopping when Dean had forced him to, hauling him out of his seat and taking him on a drive for some fresh air.
“Maybe I should leave.”
More of the smile, joy streaming out of Jack, "you want to know about Cas." He said, simply.
“He’s a friend,” he said firmly, “he’s fine.”
Dean couldn’t even begin to formulate a response to that. He looked at Cas’ unwavering gaze and opened his mouth wordlessly, trying to think of how he could possibly answer that level of devotion. There just weren’t words for it.
The temperature in the room seemed to drop and Cas’ eyes widened. He looked from Dean to Mary, unable to hide the shock that lined his face, “your mother,” he said, with wonder.
She saw it as a curse, a burden he had to bear. Dean swallowed, “no,” he said gruffly, keeping his eyes fixed on the red light, willing it to turn green, “no, I did it all by myself.”
If Dean had been falling for the past few weeks, then that was the moment when he finally hit the ground, feet first, his entire body reverberating with the shock.
Dean couldn't even answer, his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth. He nodded, squeezing his fists together so tightly that he was afraid he'd bust a blood vessel.
“Who is this woman?” Cas asked, quicker on the draw.
Secretly, Dean wasn’t sure anyone should have Jack’s power, Jack included. And this woman could be anyone.
“I’m tired.”
“Oh!” Mary turned sharply to stare at Dean, “Sams here?”
Dean huffed and refocused his eyes, realising he’d been driving almost on autopilot. They couldn’t be more than half an hour away from the bunker now, the winding roads cutting familiar shapes on the horizon.
Cas and Mary both frowned in unison. Cas at the formality of Dean calling him by his full name, and Mary at the name itself. Dean wondered if she’d heard it before, if she had any sense of what Cas was.
“Cas?” He called again, knowing he sounded pathetic - his voice was breaking, not even able to make it through the single syllable, so pathetically dependent on those three letters.
The shadow that had passed over Cas’ face didn’t lift. If anything, he looked even sadder. Dean wanted to reach out and - he wanted to lean over and -
“Cas,” Dean said, his tone firm, “this is Mary. Mary Winchester.”
“Human.”
Sam and Eileen nodded, and Cas murmured a small “please.”
“Jack,” he said, maintaining eye contact with Dean, “do you know how to do this?”
Then, Dean remembered the mysterious book on the table, “were you trying to bring me back?” He asked, voice quiet.
Dean tore his gaze from Mary for long enough to see Cas staring at him, shocked.
Meeting your mother after being separated from her for thirty years is never going to be an easy situation. Meeting your mother after she’s been
The word caught in his throat, sharp.
Frowning, Jack shook his head, "no,
Jack bit his lip, “I think- I think I want to be human. Like you two.”
He wasn’t sure what he was expecting to see when he reached Mary, but he knew it wasn’t her standing in the middle of the room, gun raised and aimed directly at Cas. In that moment, seeing her ready to kill his best friend, Dean fully understood that Mary had been trained the same way as him, that she had the exact same instincts. The way she shifted on her back foot, the way she kept her elbow slightly bent, the way she sneered at her target - it was like looking in a mirror.
“Did you ask her how much time she feels has passed since her last living memory? Some souls remember their time in heaven, but in her case she may believe the moment of her death was only hours ago, which would definitely complicate her perceptions of-”
“Jack?” Dean repeated, taking a cautious step towards him, “are you alright?”
But no matter how much he tried to justify it, her gaze still made his skin itch. From the way she was looking at him out of the corner of her eye, he could tell she was looking from the wrong direction, her view distorted as though she was peering at him through a kaleidoscope. He could almost hear the sentences she was stringing together in her mind, the connecting words muddled and ugly and wrong; and, suddenly, he felt like a child about to throw a temper tantrum. He felt like a little girl, tugging on his mother’s sleeve as she stared blankly out the window, face and knuckles pale as she watched a car backing out of the driveway. He felt like a little boy being gifted her first gun for her birthday, terrified of its weight and of what she’d seen her father do with his own, and mourning the picture book she’d secretly hoped she’d be getting.
Cas frowned, “well, of course. If her last memory of you is as a child, it must be jarring for her to meet you as an adult-”
“Nothing?”
“Dean?”
to breathe; but, in that moment, he couldn’t see Jack as God or even as a celestial being. All he saw was a scared little boy.
“Where did you find her?”
Sam exhaled shakily, trying to hold it together, “hey Eileen,” he half-said, half-signed, hands and voice equally unsteady.
“He might be here… somewhere,” he said doubtfully, “let’s go and check.”
“Just in case,” he said, watching as she handled it expertly, finger automatically closing around the trigger and stance widening, ready to shoot and dodge at any moment, “this place is secure, but sometimes people slip through the cracks.”
Without a word, Cas yawned and climbed into the bed, looking a little self conscious. It occurred to Dean that he hadn’t slept properly for a very long time - it probably felt strange to tuck himself into bed, like a novelty he was going to have to get used to.
Dean reached a red light at an intersection, breathing a sigh of relief when he realised they couldn't be more than ten minutes away from the bunker now. They just had to get there. He just had to take Mary - mom - inside and show her his life and then she'd understand him. He’d watch as she stepped over the threshold and a lightbulb would light over her head, and she’d finally become his real mom, the one he'd been dreaming about for as long as he could remember, the one who wears white dresses and waltzes around the kitchen, humming absently as she cooks.
Cas pulled back, holding him at arm’s length, “you’re home,” he smiled, “that’s all that matters.”
They all fell into a thick, loaded silence. Dean wasn’t sure if Cas understood the layered awkwardness of all this. Neither of them had exactly acknowledged the way Cas rebuilding his body had changed it, and Dean had a creeping suspicion that Cas simply didn’t know, that he’d taken one look at what was left of Dean’s body and done his best with it; that the greatest thing anyone had ever done for him had been a happy, miraculous mistake.
“Yeah, it was,” Dean grumbled, relieved Cas had managed to compose himself, “but thanks.”
Jack smiled, "I'll be okay, Dean. I have Amara."
“-and all those other bones that your father set incorrectly after you broke them as a child,” Cas continued bitterly, “yes. I was instructed to make you as strong as possible in preparation for being Michael’s vessel.”
“No, you-” Dean didn’t have the right words. He searched for them, delving deep into the past, searching for some parental figure who’d comforted him, searching for old movies or sitcoms, anything that would help him talk to this kid.
Cas was the quietest of them all. Dean knew he was turning everything over in his mind, that he was dying to ask where Jack was, but too afraid to find out the inevitable. Part of him wanted to grab him by the wrist and take him outside, to at least try and comfort him by repeating Jack’s speech, to hope there was a well-timed rumble of thunder or gust of wind that could make them both feel a little less broken up. He imagined how they’d stare at each other, then, and how he’d manage to say it all with a single look.
“Okay.”
And then Cas was pulling back and looking Dean in the face, putting enough distance to check him over, gripping his arms and clinging to them as though he was afraid Dean was going to disappear again. His eyes met Dean’s but seemed to look past them and, with a jolt, Dean realised he was looking at his soul, checking he was all there.
Groaning, he stood up and made his way to the kitchen, squinting as he stumbled down the dark corridor. For a moment, he paused outside Cas’ room, holding his breath to see if he could hear him snoring. He couldn’t. Of course he couldn’t, the walls were too thick.
But everything he’d learnt had been impersonal. The gaps in his human history had been filled in by documentaries caught on motel TVs in the early hours of the morning, turned down low after Dean had groaned and made a show of shoving his head beneath his pillow one too many times. They’d never discussed the past, never talked about politics or morals in anything but an abstract sense.
"Thank you," he managed to croak out, "Jack, I-"
And then the stoplight turned green, and he was stepping on the accelerator, racing away and racing home. A part of him thought that he should call Sam, or Cas, or
“So did I,” Cas smiled, “but here we are. Once again.”
“They fit,” Cas said eventually, and Dean turned to see him, changed.
"This isn't right," he said, "this isn't how it's supposed to end."
“Can you read that?” Mary asked, stepping closer and frowning at the impenetrable pages.
So he didn’t know.
Dean would never forget the look that had passed over Cas’ face in that moment - the transition from confusion to disbelief to joy. He’d never forget how he stumbled out of bed to clasp Jack into a tight hug, how he’d opened his eyes to stare at Dean from over his shoulder, smile wide and unreadable.
Actually, scratch that, he
“No. But I think I know who can.”
It was a small room, smaller than Dean’s, with nothing more than a bed, a chest of drawers, and a small desk-chair combo. Cas seemed to hardly care, though, and made his way directly to the bed, not even taking his shoes off as he tried to climb into it.
Dean made Jack cereal. He made it in the same way Sam had used to like it: cold milk first, then cereal poured with gentle shakes, spread out evenly through the bowl.
That was a fact - something Dean had managed to store in the back of his brain for a while now, stuffed in a little box labelled “do not open!” and emblazoned with a skull and crossbones.
“I-” Dean licked his lips, “I don’t think he will. We tried to get him to stay but he just left.”
She smiled, thankful, and pocketed her gun, stepping out of the room without turning her back to either of them.
She sighed. “I’ll meet you there.”
Dean’s head was pounding.
“So,” he said, after the silence has stretched for far too long, “beer?”
“Damn it, Cas,” he whispered to himself, suddenly feeling very heavy.
Jack frowned, looking more like Cas than ever, “cereal.” He said, after a moment, “and a glass of milk.”
The bulb in the kitchen had finally blown. He flicked the light switch a few times, but all it managed was a weak spark before dying entirely. It didn’t matter - he knew the bunker inside out by now.
“A hunting society,” Mary said faintly, and Dean could hear the devastation in her voice, “and you live here with-”
Way to make him feel old. Deen shook his head, “no, Cas. I mean, look-”
Jack tilted his head, "who says this is the end?"
And then she hung up, leaving Sam and Dean alone in the silence of the car once again.
Well, he wanted to do something. He wanted to take Cas’ sadness and shoot it, or stick it full of silver pins.
A loud noise caught his attention, it was the sound of something being dropped or thrown, followed by vague, indistinguishable voices. Dean’s head snapped up and he dropped the shirt, reaching for his gun as he tore from the room, not bothering to close the door behind him. He kicked himself for getting distracted, but his mind was still on the shirt, its red fabric seeming to wrap around his throat and choke him as he raced down the corridor and back into the study.
"He's at home." Jack said.
Cas nodded seriously, “of course.”
Luckily for the two of them, there was an empty room with a clean bed ready and waiting, some long-forgotten relic of when they’d used to have guests in the bunker on the regular.
“Jack...” He began, preparing to explain all this somehow.
That wasn’t strictly true. This isn’t something even Dean Winchester could do alone. He remembered Bobby sitting him down at the kitchen table and teaching him how to forge prescriptions, sternly lecturing him on needle safety. He thought of a long-forgotten hunter in a bar, writing the name of a surgeon down on a scrap of paper and passing it to him under the table, the note light between his fingers, like a drug deal. And of Sam in a motel room at night, crying his eyes out as John shouted at him, bearing the brunt of the punishment after he shaved Dean’s head.
“Hey, kid.”
“Don’t be.”
“Yeah.”
“Hang on,” he said, backing out of the room, “I’ll get you something.”
“Are you a hunter?” She asked, a little too polite.
And, of course, because he’s Dean Winchester and nothing can ever be easy for him, the death and resurrection is one of the least complicated things he has to explain.
Nothing more was said for the rest of the car ride.
He wasn’t sure why he thought he’d be in there. Cas very rarely spent time in his room; he didn’t need to sleep, and if he wanted to watch TV, he’d usually come and sit with Dean, perching on the end of his bed and giving bizarre running commentaries. Still, he kept his few possessions in here: the clothes he’d worn as a human, his phones, various trinkets and gifts Sam and Dean had given him in the hopes he’d try to make himself more at home.
“We’ll find him.” Dean repeated, pulling out of Cas’ reach and turning to face him, “I promise, man.”
No response - Jack’s eyes continued to dart around the room, panicked, and his breath came in short, scared huffs. Funny. Dean hadn’t known that God even
He covered Jack’s hand with his own, “I know,” he said, “I know, Jack. It’s okay.”
." He insisted, "the bunker."
“I didn’t do anything.”
“How about that cereal then?” He asked, rubbing his hands together.
“Thank you, Dean.” Cas said, a strange quality touching his voice, a hint of something Dean couldn’t understand.
Fine. Dean turned around and sighed, looking past Cas and Jack, at the plain wall on the other side of the room.
“And, you know, you changed a few things: you branded me, got rid of a few scars, fixed up my bad knee-”
Cas didn’t seem to mind, though. He was trying to sit up, muddling through his confusion, “Dean?” He said again, blinking.
“Hey,” he breathed, stumbling towards Cas, “hey, buddy-”
He looked back at Mary, whose expression had faltered, but whose gun was still resolutely trained on Cas. Dean stepped forward, carefully placing his body in the way of the gun. It was a stupid thing to do, really; a couple of bullets wouldn’t hurt Cas, the worst they’d do is leave a few holes in his coat, but Dean couldn’t stand the idea of watching his own mother shoot him.
“Ready?” He asked.
Cas hadn’t said anything, but had nodded, his hand reaching up to feel his pulse again.
The gifts hadn’t made a difference. When Dean pushed the door open, he found the room just as barren as it had been when they’d first discovered the bunker. Everything was neatly tucked away into drawers, out of sight. It was as though Cas had never been there at all.
For a moment, he let his mind wander - thought about changing into the clothes himself and taking something else for Cas. How would he react, he wondered, if he said nothing and climbed into bed next to him? Would he speak? Would he smile? After everything, Dean still wasn’t sure.
But their work was never done, “is Sam here?” Dean asked, looking around.
Cas loved him.
Sam hissed Dean's name, like he was afraid Jack would strike him down - yeah, sure, it was just like Dean to get on the new God's bad side less than an hour after dethroning the previous one, but what did it matter? What had it all been for if Dean was going to lose Jack too?
Jack was sat at the kitchen table, curled in on himself. He looked small, his hands fisted into his hair as he stared desperately around the room, rocking a little.
He didn’t have time to think, though - he left Sam into the car and tore towards the front door, almost knocking it off its hinges as he opened it, so desperate just to
"Everywhere but here," Dean said sullenly, shoving his hands into his pockets.
At around four in the morning, he gave up on sleep altogether. He sat up in bed and put his head in his hands, tugging at his hair - at least his headache was almost gone, making way for his next hangover, which would probably take hold within the next few hours.
“I don’t know.” Jack said.
And it was on Cas’ bed. Cas, who thought Dean was dead, had one of his shirts on his bed. Dean had no idea what that meant - but, somehow, he understood completely. He picked the shirt up and folded it between his hands, squeezing it a little too tightly.
Cas dropped his smile and crossed the room to sit down on the bed. Dean supposed he was trying to look serious, but he was failing; the borrowed pyjamas seemed even bigger on him in the half-light that crept in from the hallway, and his hair was tousled in that way that only comes from deep sleep.
That was something people always failed to understand about this whole saving the world thing; the lack of respect hangovers had for events of cosmic importance. They didn't care about God - they didn’t care about life or death or tragedy. They persisted, a constant reminder that Dean really was getting too old to be doing shit like this.
“Here we are.” He echoed.
“I-” Sam started, his voice a little strained, “I guess we won.”
Jack shook. Jack shook his head, shook from head to toe, “I’m sorry.”
Sam fumbled in his pocket for his phone and held it up to his face with shaking hands.
They all drank together. It should’ve felt celebratory but it wasn’t. It wasn’t sad, though. It was just quiet, small, the feeling you get when you’re the last person left at the bar and you can feel the bartender watching you, waiting for you to leave. It was a wake, a wake if the person who’d died hadn’t been well loved, or, maybe, if they’d been too well loved and people didn’t know how to talk about it.
Jack brightened as the minutes ticked past. Dean wasn’t sure whether this was from the sugar or the comfort of the quiet kitchen, but by the time he’d finished his cereal, he was almost smiling again. He watched, unguarded, as Dean stood up and cleared his bowl away, tossing it carelessly in the sink for someone else to deal with tomorrow.
Mary nodded, relaxing a little at the acknowledgement.
“He’ll probably sleep a hell of a lot better once he finds out you’re safe. Jesus, he’s probably tossing and turning right now, worrying about you.”
Dean’s frown deepened as he approached the bed and realised what the cloth actually was. It was a flannel shirt, one of his own, red and rumpled and a little frayed from years of wear. Dean had last seen it a few days ago, when he’d torn it and debated throwing it out, given how many times he’d already sewn it back together. By now, he was sure all of the buttons must have been replaced twice.
He lifted his hand, "good-"
“Oh,” Cas’ expression faltered, “of course. I’m sorry.”
Slowly, he raised his hand to touch where Dean’s had been, smiling as he felt his pulse race beneath his fingers. Dean thought, for a moment, that he saw a little colour touch his cheeks.
But Jack was already gone.
Eileen hesitated for a moment, face still drawn with confusion, “you’ll tell me everything?”
He couldn’t say it. Something was stopping him - his own pride, maybe. But it was written plainly on his face. He wanted to be at home, he wanted his old life, he’d seen enough of the world to last him several human lifetimes.
Cas tugged at the hem of his jacket, “Dean-” he started, his voice taking on a different tone.
“Oh,” Dean said, glancing at her, “sorry, you two haven’t met. This is Castiel.”
On the perfectly made, obviously unslept in bed, lay what Dean thought was a piece of cloth. He frowned and stepped forward to investigate, making his footsteps as loud and heavy as possible, in case Cas was hiding somewhere nearby.
"You're leaving. Seems pretty fuckin' final to me, kid."
He waited for the other shoe to drop. Surely Cas had to feel something about this: sadness, happiness, existential dread - but his face was terrifyingly calm.
Cas frowned and opened his mouth as though he was about to say something else, but was interrupted by Mary loudly clearing her throat, her gun still clenched tightly in her hand.
One ring.  Two rings. Three rings-
“And what do you want now?” Dean said, quietly, hoping Jack’s rising hysterics wouldn’t wake everyone. The kid needed calm - Sam barging in and taking up space and fussing, that would just complicate things.
He fixed him a glass of milk. He watched him eat the cereal bite by bite and didn’t say a word, worried he’d disappear if he did.
“Cas, buddy?” He called out, “you in here?”
“Did she recognise you?”
“There’s someone,” Jack said, “a woman worthy of taking on my power, capable of it, a woman who’d be happy to have it.”
He didn’t elaborate. Dean waited impatiently, exchanging nervous glances with Cas, whose frown was starting to deepen with worry.
“It wasn’t about that, Dean.” Cas said sharply.
Only one of the lights was working, flickering a little from the almost dead bulb, casting a harsh, wavering golden light on a familiar figure, who was sat slumped in his usual chair.
Cas sighed, entire body sagging. He looked very old all of a sudden, and Dean wanted nothing more than to just let him rest; for a second, he hoped that Mary never came back from the bathroom, that Sam never came back from wherever he’d run off to, and that they could just spend the rest of forever like this. A lifetime of awkward silence with Cas was better than anything else he could think of.
Cas looked at Dean, finally letting go of him and shoving his hands into his pockets, “I’m an angel.” He said bluntly.
“Sam, what’s-” I have no idea what just happened. One minute I was waiting for you outside and the next…”
Dean groaned, “so, how-”
Mary nodded, alert, and Dean turned, walking briskly out the door and trailing down the long corridor to Cas’ room.
“Is there a way to do that?” Cas asked, sounding more like he was talking to himself than to Jack.
“Stay here,” he told Mary, putting the book down on the table.
Dean smiled, shrugging, “I guess I’m just not that easy to kill.”
“And I thought my mom was dead for the past few decades, but here we are.”
“Yeah.” Dean breathed, glad for the change of subject.
After a few minutes of Dean going full-throttle, Sam cleared his throat, “I need to call Eileen.” He said, “Dean, I-”
“It’s late.” He said, turning towards the door, “we should sort things out in the morning, when everyone’s awake.”
He breathed a sigh of relief when they entered the bunker. Mary looked around, peering at the severe metal stairs in confusion, as though she was sure she’d just walked into some kind of trap.
“Knock yourself out,” Dean replied absentmindedly, eyes fixed on the road.
“Tired?” Sam had said the first time, raising his eyebrows, “does that mean you’re…”
“He’s God.”
Dean looked down at him, remembering the shirt in his room. God - he’d really left Cas without a body to mourn, just a hug and a pat on the shoulder to say goodbye; no wonder he’d come straight back here to wallow.
Cas smiled down at the floor, “it doesn’t quite work like that.” He said, “it was more that I felt your soul. And that was all I needed.”
Now, Dean knew that there was a right way to do things. He knew he should pat Cas on the shoulder, tell him he was glad to have his best friend back. He knew he should give him a wide berth, sit opposite him at the table and keep his hands to himself from now on. He knew that what had passed between them before Cas had been taken would change things, and that he should fight that change, that no good could come of it.
Despite himself, and despite his rising nausea that had him seriously worried he was gonna have to pull over and throw up by the side of the road, Dean couldn’t help but hold his breath as the two of them waited for Eileen to pick up.
