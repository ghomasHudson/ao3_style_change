Chapter Three: I’m Giving It All
Cas accepted some candy and reached for his Sprite. “A lot better. The pain isn’t so bad. But I did just have my meds.” Even wasted off his ass, Dean was taking care of him. Cas eyed him. He was glad that Ash and Dean had been able to patch things up. The fight at the hospital had seemed to be resolved quickly, but the past few weeks had been a little strained. “You are lucky, you can get ploughed too. I have to sit here and watch them be incredibly silly drunks.” He said, and his eyes widened when Ash lifted a third bag he’d brought with him. Cas knew it was his pot bag. “I don’t think Dean could object to my getting high.” He said, a grin widening on his face.
“That you’re in love with me.” Cas finished for him. Cas was going to say more, when Dean leaned out, and kissed him, deeply. Cas was too taken aback to do more than kiss back. Cas only pulled back to breathe. “Um, wow.” Was all he could manage to say. Cas’ blue eyes settled on Dean’s emerald green ones. There was so much to be found in those eyes. Cas wasn’t sure what to say to him, but he could see the longing, the fear, the love. Dean loved him, alright. “Okay. Dean Henry, you just kissed me. You… you’re in love with me.” This was going to sound harsh. Cas was sure that it was, and he was sure his parents had been called. They could decide to send someone. He felt the same way Dean did, definitely. But now might be the wrong time to start something. Cas was also of the mind that the town would be alight with gossip. Taking as deep a breath as he could with broken rib cage bones, he spoke again. “When I saw you, getting out of that car, with Belle. That baby girl is a wonderful angel. But when I laid my eyes on you, I just.. I fell for you. You are… I want to be able to get to know you better. You… but right now might not be the best time. I’m not just in danger from Benny. My family, the stuck up snobs…. They were called. They may have to send someone to get me.” He didn’t add the kill him part.
The relief that he was wrong about what Cas had been thinking showed on his face. “You don’t have to worry so much, Cas. I know this is moving so quickly. But what does it matter if we’re happy? Cas I love you. Like, really love you. I never fall like this. Ever. And yeah, I’m scared as fuck too. But in a good way. You…. we’re both crazy because we’re moving this fast, but maybe we’re right. This could be forever, Cas. And you’re great with my kid. She does love you too, so much. Stop worrying so much. I will keep you safe.” Dean kissed him once more, and they settled in to watch Netflix and fall asleep.
Ash looked at the kid. Ash was 23, and he was far too old for Castiel himself. But Cas was just the right age for Dean. Who had clearly thought that Cas was hot as well. Ash sized him up. He was one, gay, and it was obvious to Ash, and two, a virgin gay on top of it. The perfect first boyfriend for Dean. Ash was of the mind that Dean was going to come out as gay eventually. This guy might even be the one to get him to do so. As small as Gatlin was, Ash was into guys as well as girls, and so far it was more about why no one knew his last name, and that he was from Away. It was always pronounced that way, with the A capitalized. “I know things.” Was what he said to Castiel.
Cas’ eyes followed Scott’s. Stiles’ face was still a bit beat up, and Cas knew there was a long scar on his chest from the surgery. “It’s no problem, Scott. We’re friends, and Stiles is my friend too. I hope he wakes up today.” Cas had pulled out a book to read, his own homework was finished. Cas was a bookworm. He also took school seriously. Cas knew that Dean was hiding something. It was all he could think about. What was Dean planning? Cas didn’t know what to think. His heart was wanting it to be a marriage proposal. As crazy as that would be. They still were getting to know each other.
This is when there was a knock on the door, and Jo and Lydia Martin were both standing there. Jo and Lydia had become friends lately. Even if she was Scott and Stiles’ age. Jo said. “We wanted to see how Stiles was doing.” Jo knew that Scott was barely holding it all in. She hoped that she wasn’t going to upset him. Jo leaned on the wall across from Stiles’ bed, and Lydia pulled up the last chair. Jo wasn’t as ladylike as Lydia was. “Scott, are you doing okay?” Jo and Sam had had sex twice more since the first time, and it was the only thing on her mind, really. She knew that was kind of selfish.
The party at Charlie’s had started. Dean had picked up both Scott and Stiles, since Scott couldn’t take Stiles on his bike. He’d cleared out a few of his guns in the trunk to make room for Stiles’ chair. Scott and Stiles were going as Batman and Robin, which Dean thought was very cute. Scott was Robin, and Stiles was Batman. They had just gotten there, and Scott and Dean, who was dressed as a nurse, were carrying Stiles in his chair up the short steps inside to Charlie’s. Dean and Scott found a spot for Stiles and set him down. Cas moved with Dean to get a drink, and they found Charlie, dressed as Hermione. “Hey, girl.” Dean said, and she teased them gently about their costumes matching. Dean got a beer and said, “You look amazing, Charlie.” It was going to be them, Ash, Garth, Callie, Gabrielle, Lydia, Jo, and of course, Sam. Everyone else was already there, and beer pong was set up. Dean had had to promise John and Bobby and Ellen that Sam and Jo wouldn’t drink anything. But they were all probably going to spend the night here, so Dean didn’t think it was going to matter. He wasn’t even 21 yet, but when he’d become a dad, John had started letting him have alcohol. Dean would be 21 soon, though. It was only a few months away.
Dean clung to Cas, he’d been on nerves for two days about if he’d caught something. He and Cas were both clean, and they didn’t use condoms any longer. Dean was just so glad he was clean. He kissed him deeply, and then pulled back. He moved to get out some Cokes for himself and Cas. Dean did coffee but not that often. He preferred soda in the morning as his caffeine of choice. As he was sitting down, Cas put a piece of food down in front of him. Dean said a quick prayer, usually not his thing, but something he’d begun doing lately, and dug in. Cas moved to join him, and Dean mumbled, “Great job, babe.” He was just so glad that he was still clean.
“You’ve got a thing for Gabi?” Dean asked, ignoring her appeal. “I don’t know how good of an idea that is, Char. Gabrielle is kind of wishy washy. She might not be able to give you what you want.” Dean didn’t want to see Charlie hurt. Dean also knew that Cas was still keeping Gabrielle at arms length. “I’m not trying to tell you what to do. But I’m just warning you that it might be a bad idea.” Dean got a plate of his own pizza, Cas had gotten food and drink and had gone to sit with Scott and Stiles. Dean knew why. Something was up with Scott. And Cas and Scott were good friends now, and Dean knew Cas would be who Scott talked to. Dean suspected it would be about Caitlyn.
The next day, Scott was at his locker. He was changing out his books. When Jackson Whittemore walked up to him. “What do you want, Jackson?” Scott asked. It’s not as if they were friends. Scott didn’t want to fight him. Plus, the older boy could crush him if he wanted to. “I gotta go meet my boyfriend.” Scott wasn’t surprised when Jackson didn’t walk away. He kept looking at Scott. “What? What the eff is  your problem?” He didn’t really curse. Except for if Stiles was really good during sex. And that happened pretty much every time. Scott knew it was because they loved each other.
To get the blood runnin’ through my veins, oh
Watching Callie, Jo wondered if Callie would really keep her word. Jo didn’t want to know what John and her mama would do if they found out. All she did know was that she didn’t regret it. It had been everything she’d thought it would be. Jo was taking a bite of her burger and chewing as Sam tried to start a conversation with Callie. Jo was now wondering if Callie knew that Gabrielle Novak was crushing on her pretty hard. Jo was sure that Callie wasn’t gay though. She’d never gotten that vibe from her. She also wasn’t a fan of Gabi. Gabi was a total bitch. Jo had seen her doing and saying some shitty stuff around town. She wasn’t going to be accepted.
I know that you’re dancin’ just for me
That had to have been awful. Cas awkwardly moved to put an arm carefully around Dean’s shoulders. He kissed Dean’s cheek, and then his jaw. “You tell her that she’s got two daddies, and that’s much better than having a mommy and a daddy. When she’s older you can tell her the truth.” Cas was a little nervous that Dean might be upset about the two daddies thing but he couldn’t help it. It was just something he felt in his heart. Cas tilted Dean’s chin so he was looking Cas in the eye. “I gotta admit, you being a dad is just so hot. But it also scares me. I don’t even know for sure how to take care of me, let alone a baby girl. But… we love each other, Dean, no matter how crazy the idea is. I just, I look at you, and I see this strong, beautiful, talented, funny, caring guy and I just don’t know why you want me. I’m just me. You are one of the best guys that I’ve ever met. You are an amazing Southern gentleman. The guys where I come from don’t know how to treat people like you Southern boys.” This was true, and he hoped that Dean would believe him. Cas couldn’t imagine being good enough for Dean. He knew how lucky he was that Dean had chosen him.
Dean was watching his daughter talk with animation to Cas, but out of the corner of his eye, he saw 	Scott and Ash spying on Cas and Belle. It because Cas was new in town, and that was a novelty. Dean cast them a warning glance as they came into the main room of the shop. Dean’s eyes met Ash’s, and the older man gave a nod towards Bobby and John’s office. It was an ‘I want to talk’ gesture. Dean took one more glance at Belle and Cas and then followed Ash. “What do you want, Ash?” Dean asked, folding his arms. He was getting worried this was about Cas.
Scott was burrowing his head in Stiles’ neck. He couldn’t stop remembering what his bio dad had done to him. He knew exactly how Cas felt, because he would feel the same if he was in Cas’ shoes. Scott was doing his best to calm down, but Stiles made him use his inhaler. Scott had asthma. He reluctantly used it. He wanted to check on Cas, but he was so shaky he couldn’t get up. He buried his head in Stiles’ neck again, and they could hear Jodi and the EMTs getting there. Scott was very surprised when one came to check him out, too. Scott tried to tell them he was okay.
“It was okay.” Cas said. The food looked very good. Corn on the cob, too. He moved to get a soda out of the fridge. “I um, I saw Gabrielle today.” Cas knew that Dean probably already knew. Gatlin was small. Much smaller than Cas was used to, actually. He was still trying to get used to doing something and the whole town aware of it a couple of hours later at the most. It was usually just minutes after. Cas moved to help mash potatoes. “I don’t know if I’m going to do it again. She seems to be only caring about what happens to her. Nothing about what I went through. I almost died. And she doesn’t even seem to care. I don’t know why I’m at all surprised, it’s how she is.”
Reaching out, Ash brushed some of the boy’s tears off his cheek. Dean’s cheeks were full of stubble. “I’m sorry, sweetheart. I am. I know…. I should have told you, Benny still talks about you, constantly. I just… I didn’t want to scare you. And I wasn’t at all thinking this might happen. But Dean, he’ll pay for this. They’ve got him. But you have to admit, you’re this upset because you’re in love with Castiel. And that’s what we need to focus on right now. Benny is going to pay. You can focus on being here for Cas.” He didn’t tell Dean Cas’ parents had been called.
Dean looked at the other boy. Dean was a new 18, so he wasn’t exactly a man, but this one had the look of being younger than Dean himself was. Dean turned to face him. The guy was gorgeous. A lot of black hair that was falling over his forehead and gorgeous blue eyes. Dean had recently started to have sexual feelings about guys. At first, he’d done the panic thing. Then he’d decided to see what that was all about. Dean hadn’t been with anyone since Belle’s mom. Who they didn’t even talk about. Belle had been six months old when she’d left. Dean was holding a lot of anger in about that. Belle didn’t remember her, Dean was sure. “We can help you. You give me the keys and I’ll get it up, we’re actually slow today. Gatlin is kind of small.” Dean’s slow drawl was sure to sound odd to the guy, who had an accent Dean was sure was from New York. He’d never wanted to go. He liked Gatlin just fine. He was a very simple man. Dean knew that even 2 years later, they were talking about Dean getting that girl from Away pregnant, and then the girl leaving and Dean having to get his GED. But everyone in town loved his baby girl. And Dean was a very protective father. His green eyes watched Cas’ eyes slide over the toddler, and he had to stop himself from jumping him, hot or not. “You can hang out for a bit?”
Eying his friend carefully, Scott wasn’t sure if he should press him about the new guy. There was something Dean was hiding. Scott brushed his hand through his curls. He was half Latino. All the girls at Stonewall Jackson High thought he was drop your panties gorgeous. Scott shrugged one shoulder. “There’s this party Friday night at Lydia’s.” Lydia was Lydia Martin, one of the most popular girls in school. Scott knew that she only invited the band to play because of Dean, and his fake ID. Scott knew that even with Dean being a single dad dropout, he was still the most popular guy in Gatlin. Scott had to admit that he was jealous.
Things didn’t usually anger him, but Scott did feel some when she said that about his mami. “You don’t know my mami, that’s right. She wouldn’t give up a baby.” Scott wasn’t 100% certain, because Rafe had been a terrible father. She may have been raped by him, and hadn’t wanted Caitlyn to suffer him. Rafe’s physical abuse of Scott hadn’t started until he was three, but Scott had a feeling that he hadn’t been the best husband, either. “I’m 17. How old are you?” When she told him 15, Scott was surprised. Why didn’t he remember his mami being pregnant? Melissa had never been a heavy woman, you’d think she’d’ve said something.
Like it’s 1954
And I’ll leave those other boys alone
Cas watched, Belle blew him a kiss and ran for the stairs. He wished he could help. Cas also wished that Benny hadn’t done this to him, based on only a rumor. Even though it turned out to be true. Cas accepted another kiss and a soda from Dean on his way upstairs. Cas was truly curious if they’d get to why Stiles had called. He was sure it was about sex. He’d happened to walk into a classroom before this happened, and the other two had been making out. He hadn’t been shocked, only about the doing it at school part. That was kind of stupid, you could get caught. Although the idea of doing it with Dean just wouldn’t leave his brain.
If you’ll be the one that I come home to
His boyfriend was right. None of that Dean got from experience. He ran his finger along Cas’ jaw. “No one is going to tell you want to do. You might end up losing out on having her around, and you might regret it. Otherwise, it’s up to you how to handle things.” The door opened, bringing Scott and Stiles with more food and drinks. With Dean Winchester in attendance, food was always a good bet that you could never have too much. Plus, no one in Gatlin locked their doors because it wasn’t usually a crime town. It was essentially Stars Hollow.
Later that evening, Dean and Cas were settled in the living room, pizza boxes and wine coolers on the coffee table in front of them. They’d eaten, and now were lying on the couch, making out. Cas was on top, and their legs were entangled together. Cas could feel Dean’s member getting hard against his, Dean’s right arm was wrapped around Cas’ waist. Cas kissed Dean deeply, nipping at his lip lightly. Dean groaned against his lips, and shifted his hips so his erection was pressed more tightly against Cas’. Cas groaned too, and shifted, pressing his cock directly up against Dean’s. Cas whimpered against Dean’s mouth, and Dean’s right hand slipped beneath Cas’ pants and into his underwear. His thumb circled Cas’ entrance, and Cas groaned again. He pressed closer to Dean, his hand reaching up underneath Dean’s shirt, playing with the hair in his treasure trail. His fingers moved through the hair in soft circles, and Dean was squirming underneath him. Cas set his hand moving down Dean’s stomach and palmed Dean’s huge cock. Dean groaned against Cas’ lips. Cas lifted his head to look at Dean, as his hand still moved up and down Dean’s shaft. “Are we going all the way?” Cas asked, trying to keep him from laughing. His New England accent was fading and he was starting to sound like a true Southerner. Dean bit his lip, and Cas just wondered if he was going to say yes. “It’s okay if you aren’t ready.” Cas told him, his hand stilling as he looked into Dean’s eyes.
That was the best news he’d heard all day. Outside of Dean loving him. It just was… more than he could have asked for. “I’m so glad to hear that. I don’t want them to be in my life.” His cheeks were still flushed from what Dean had said. He caught Jodi looking at him with a knowing glance on her face. “What?” Cas asked, and wasn’t able to keep the nervous laughter from coming. “I’ll be fine. You have Benny in custody, and Dean….” He was way too embarrassed to say what Dean had said out loud. “Stop it, Jode.” Cas admonished, causing them both to laugh. He couldn’t believe it, freedom.
“Ash, give us a minute, would you? Go ask Dad if he’s checked in with Cas today.” Dean said, and Ash gave him a sly smile and went off to do as asked. Dean wiped his hands on his coveralls. “I’d shake your hand, but no sense in getting your hand dirty, darlin’.” Dean said. He set his eyes on her. “You get a place here yet? The hotel isn’t bad, although nothing like you’re used to.” Dean wasn’t sure what to make of her. She nodded in response to his question. “Cas is staying with me, especially while he heals up. My ex hurt him pretty badly.” Dean gave her the full story, managing to keep his calm. “The pat that was fucked up is we weren’t even dating yet.” Dean was still very angry at Benny for what he’d done. He had been trying to keep himself from going to see Benny in jail. He’d just angrily explode all over him. Dean couldn’t believe that Benny had been that psychotic and that into him. “I’ve been taking care of Cas, and he’s enrolled in school. We weren’t dating before but we have been since he woke up. I love him, and he loves me. If you’re going to try and scare me, I don’t plan to hurt him. You can save the hurt my big brother speech.” He wasn’t going to ask about Michael, the other brother. Michael obviously didn’t care about Cas.
All I need is all your lovin’
Sighing, Stiles did feel a bit better. “I just, I saved myself for him. Scott… he did too, actually. I’m just… we’ll only have had sex with each other. I love that. Because I really think that Scott’s the one. I’ve been in love with him for so long I don’t even remember not being in love with him.” Stiles really loved Scott so much. He was sure that Scott felt the same. His tone relaxed, he really was less nervous. Stiles didn’t know what he’d do without Scott. “And I love watching him perform. You guys are awesome.” Stiles was probably the only one in school who hadn’t had a crush on Dean.
A couple of days later, Dean was sacked out in bed. Cas was just waking up. Dean had slept cuddled up to Cas tightly, but he’d slept all night long. That was the first time in the two days since he’d been home. Cas leaned and kissed Dean’s cheek, and then moved to get up, and start breakfast. He stopped on his way down to get Belle, who was already awake and playing with her dolls. He reached down to pick her up, she giggled as he slung her over his shoulder and headed downstairs to the tiny kitchen. Belle only wanted a bowl of cereal, so Cas got that for her and she took it into the living room to watch tv. Cas got out bacon, home fries, and eggs to start for himself and Dean. Dean had gotten drunk the night before, and Cas knew his fiancé's hangover foods. As he was preparing it, the house phone rang. Cas moved to answer it, and it was the hospital. They told Cas that Dean was negative when it came to STDs, and after Cas let out a sigh of relief, he thanked them and hung up. That was some good news. They were going to have to celebrate. Cas got out a can of Pillsbury croissants, that would be a good start. He put them all on a baking sheet and popped them in the oven. As he was doing so, Dean shuffled down the stairs. He smiled softly as Dean moved sleepily to him. Cas gave him a kiss good morning. “I’ve got your hangover food going. And the hospital called, you’ve tested negative.” He smiled as a grin broke out on Dean’s face, and he threw his arms around Cas, pulling him close.
Instead of following what Dean said, Charlie noticed Dean’s glance. “You notice Scott being upset, too?” She asked, and he nodded. “I tried to ask him if he was okay, but he just told me he was okay and changed the subject.” Charlie had assumed it had to do with Stiles’ accident, but then she’d heard about Scott having a sister. So Charlie figured it had to do with that, too. She couldn’t imagine what Scott and Stiles were going through. Before anything else could be said, the front door opened, revealing Caitlyn Cade. Who had not been invited. All movements halted. What was she doing there? Everyone waited with bated breath.
All of the above, all of the above
Scott grinned when he saw them, but Belle ran up to them and he leaned down to scoop her up. “Hey, Belle.” Scott said, curls falling over his eyes. Belle reached up to touch them, she loved his hair. Dean leaned to pick up the bags that Scott had put down when he had lifted Belle. “Yes, I brought pie. Two of them.” Scott told Dean, and Dean and Stiles went into the kitchen to start getting plates together. John was coming by in a bit to pick up Belle, he was going to keep her overnight. “You feeling okay, Cas?” Scott asked, leaning down to give Cas a kiss on the cheek. Scott thought this was going to be so much fun. They all liked hanging together, and it was a couples thing. It was going to be great.
I don’t wanna slow this down,
Leaving to tug Dean back down, Cas gave him a deep kiss. “I missed you today.” Gabrielle had also gotten a hold of him, but Cas wasn’t sure if he wanted to discuss that with Dean. Only because Cas wasn’t sure how he felt about it yet. Cas was still kind of mad at her for siding with their parents even briefly. He got why she’d done it, but the sting of it was still strong. He remembered what it had felt like to stand there and see the looks on all of their faces when he’d told them that he was gay. Cas remembered the look on Gabby’s face most of all. It had been the most horrified. She was such a huge hypocrite. She’d told him that she was into girls herself. That was the most hurtful part.
Looking into Cas’ eyes, Dean brushed tears off Cas’ cheeks and brushed hair off his forehead. “I’m not mad that you didn’t. I get it. You can tell me things like that, you know. You can tell me anything. I will help you in any way you need. If you…. I’m glad what we did before didn’t trigger you.” Dean almost wasn’t sure if that was the right word to use. When Cas gave him a nod, Dean let out a breath. “And we can go as slowly as you want, once you get that cast off.” Pulling out his phone, he texted Ash that he wasn’t going to leave Cas alone, and he was sorry for it.
A couple of hours later, everyone but Cas was drunk and giggly. They were playing Scrabble, a lot of dirty words were being used. This is when the front door opened and Ash came in, with candy and more liquor. Dean grinned when he saw him. “Hey, you made it!” He said, his words slurring. He took the candy from him and Ash just laughed, putting some of the liquor in the fridge and then filling a huge glass with rum and Coke, going back into the living room. Ash had his long hair pulled back into a ponytail. Ash settled next to Cas on the couch. “How you feelin’, hon?” Ash asked, reaching for a candy bar.
Bet My Heart
This is when Dean got home, calling out to them that he was home. He had an armload of grocery bags full of food. He moved to the kitchen, and started unpacking. Belle came in, chattering away about what she and Cas had done that day. Dean listened and made noises at the right times. Scott and Stiles were five minutes away, so he got some pizza rolls, taquitos, and chicken nuggets in the huge oven. Cas came wheeling into the kitchen, and Dean leaned down to kiss him and hug him. “Hey, babe.” Dean said, and ran his fingers through Cas’ hair, loving how soft and silky it was. “Scott and Stiles will be here in a few minutes.”
Looking at him, Dean said, “You know that I love you too, Cas.” Dean moved to lay back on the bed with him, flipping on the tv. He then looked back at Cas. “Are you okay, baby?” Dean asked, reaching out to cup Cas’ jaw. “That… that was okay, right? You did want to have sex?” Even if that really was making love with them. He didn’t like the look on his boyfriend’s face. “Please tell me you didn’t just go along with it to please me. You know that you don’t have to do that. I want you to want to have sex with me.” Dean was trying hard to not think that Cas had flashed back to when Benny had raped him. It was a terrifying thought. His own eyes got a bit misty.
Sharing a look with Jo, Sam did his best to sound calm. “Okay, I’m coming. Is he home or at the shop?” He asked his heart pounding out of his chest when Scott told him Dean was home at his two bedroom cottage. Their mother’s grandfather had left it to Dean when he’d died a year ago. Sam had been jealous at first, but he got why. Dean was raising a daughter, and Grampa Campbell had just been trying to help. Plus he’d left Sam his truck, so when Sam was old enough, he had a car. “Does Dad know?” He asked, his tone cautious.
Chapter Seven: To Find You
Sam paid for his and Jo’s Tastee Freezes (the blizzard equivalent) and moved to sit at one of the picnic tables. Then he spotted Castiel in line. No one knew what to think of him. Sam did know, however, that his brother was fully crushing on Cas. Sam wasn’t sure that they should get involved though. Dean wasn’t a serious relationship guy and Sam was guessing that Cas was. Sam cast his glance at Jo again. They were sort of boyfriend and girlfriend. San was just now 14 and Jo was 13. Sam knew that Jo’s mom liked him too. She was sort of Bobby’s girlfriend. Sam took a bite of his ice cream. “Hey, Jo. Do you… do you want to go to Homecoming with me?” Sam didn’t know why a great girl like Jo would want him, but he was really hoping that she would. Sam wasn’t sure if he loved her yet, but he did like her. She was the most badass girl in Gatlin. Maybe in all of South Carolina. Sam watched her face as she thought about it. Then she grinned and told him yes. He wiped hair out of his eyes and smiled at her. “Oh, great! Dad said he’d drive us, Dean is the one at the shop that night.” Sam also knew it was because Dean always worked on the dance nights. Sam wasn’t sure why and he didn’t want to bring it up with him, in case it upset him.
After a glance at his boyfriend, Stiles knew that going down that route of conversation would be bad for Scott. “So, how’s John and Jodi? Are they still doing the dating thing?” Stiles sent Dean a please go with it look, and Dean obliged. Thank God. Not that Stiles believed in God. He was gay. Most churches (especially in Gatlin) were preaching against it. But also, here’s the irony, it wasn’t a town that was overly homophobic. He thought it was crazy, Stiles thought Southern Baptists could be a bit overzealous. Stiles tried to focus on Dean telling Stiles that John and Jodi were hitting it off great. He asked a couple of follow up questions, and tossed his empty cup away. Almost immediately, Scott got back into Stiles’ lap. They slipped into the previous position, and Stiles kept asking Dean about how everyone else was doing. He was trying to keep the conversation light, Scott was barely holding on. Stiles hadn’t even asked Scott if he’d actually gotten to talk to Caitlyn yet. This is when Noah, Stiles’ dad, came back and said it was time to leave. Stiles was very glad about that. It was agreed that Dean would go to help get Stiles inside and help move things, and off they went. Stiles had to watch Scott get on his bike and sighed.
Narrowing his gaze, Dean smirked at his bandmate. “You asking if he’s into guys? Because don’t act like you don’t have feelings for Stiles.” Dean moved to check the oil, it was almost time to put the new in. He leaned against the wall by the car. “Forget it. I’m not going to talk to you about the new guy.” Dean was trying not to blush, he was sure that Scott would see through his facade and saw that Dean thought Castiel was gorgeous. Scott may be younger, but he was kind of observant sometimes. “Did you get us a gig? Out of Gatlin, maybe?” He asked hopefully. Not that there was much outside Gatlin without a ride.
Cas knew why Dean was giving him that viewpoint. He’d lost his family to death. And his accepted him for who he was. He didn’t get what it felt like to have your family disown you and your hypocrite sister going along when she knew what she was and still shut Cas out. He brushed his hand through his hair as Dean sat on his lap. The best thing about the chair, was Dean could sit on his lap. “I know why you said that. You haven’t been in my shoes. Family is everything to you. For some of us, it’s not like that. I can’t just shake off the anger I’m feeling at Gabrielle. She was…. She went along with them in their hatred of me. Silently.”
As Jodi assured Dean she would, Cas moved to throw away the food trash. Dean had been starving and was now down to just his shake. Cas knew how hungover Dean had been before all of this. He wasn’t really nursing one. He hadn’t gotten drunk the night before. Cas moved to join Dean on the bed, and Dean leaned up close to him, Cas wrapping an arm around Dean’s shoulder. Dean’s mouth worked his straw, and that’s when John got there. Jodi kissed him, promised Dean it would all be okay, and headed out. John came over and bent to hug Dean, and Cas felt Dean start to shake as he cried.
The partying went on for awhile longer, then Dean pulled out the sofa bed so Ash and Scott and Stiles could pass out while they watched tv. Then Dean went into the bedroom with Cas, and after Dean had given Cas a leg up on the bed while kissing him, he began to take off Cas’ clothes. The kiss had been long and full of passion. Once Cas was naked, Dean got naked as well and spread Cas’ legs, being careful of his broken one, and took Cas’ already hardening cock into his mouth. He sucked Cas’ cock hard, and stroked the hair in Cas’ happy trail when Cas was good and turned on, Dean grabbed some lube and spread it all over Cas’ cock. Then he had worked it into his tight asshole, and they both groaned at the feel of it. Dean clenched around Cas’ cock, and then began to ride him. One hand covered the one Cas put on Dean’s own hard length, and the other stroked Cas’ abs. They were both groaning with desire. “Oh fuck, Cas, babe.” Dean gasped out, his hips rocking hard as he eagerly rode Cas like a bronco. Dean had done this a lot with Ash, and he loved it even more with Cas. They both came at the same time, breathless.
Cas thanked him nervously. Then he moved to get a cup of coffee. He could see Dean through a glass window. He was jacking up Cas’ car. He was thinking about what Ash had said. Was Dean really attainable? Cas shouldn’t even be entertaining the idea. He didn’t even know what his plans were, and Dean had that adorable little girl. Cas was only sixteen, he wasn’t ready to be a father. Or have sex with someone without being in love. He’d never even had sex before. He wasn’t sure he was even ready. Cas stirred in some creamer and wondered if his family even cared he was gone.
“What do you want to do today?” Dean asked. He was doing his best to keep his mind off what had happened. John had told Dean to take time off work. He’d still get paid for his time. Dean had tried to fight him off, tell his dad he was okay, but John had been very insistent. Dean didn’t ever go against what John said. Not when he was that serious about it. Dean knew to fight would just be pointless. Dean got up to get more food, and called good morning to his daughter, who had put her own bowl in the sink and was back to coloring and watching cartoons. Dean sat back down and tore into his food. If he was going to go, and bacon killed him, then he would win. It was something he liked to say.
“Oh, babe, you don’t know the half of it.” He said, a grin on his face. Devouring his slice, he grabbed another slice. Belle hummed along to the music of the show, and Dean gave her another piece. She loved pizza too. Dean took another bite. “So, I want to get to know each other. Like, my mom died when I was a kid. And everyone thinks she was cheating on my dad. They don’t talk in front of us, but they think it. Sam was just a baby. He doesn’t even remember her. He goes with us on Decoration Day, but it’s for Dad and I more than it is anything else.” He couldn’t help the tears in his eyes. “Dad and Jodi Mills are sleeping together, and they think no one knows. It’s actually kind of funny, Dad has the worst excuses. And I read, I actually like it. No one ever thinks I like it but I do.” He took a break to get a drink of Coke. He loved telling Cas things. He wasn’t usually this talkative. “My favorite book is The Stand, I love it.” Dean smiled as Cas’ eyes lit up. “Yeah, you like that one, too?” His boyfriend nodded. Dean grinned more. “That’s awesome. I love that you like it too.” Dean wanted to ask Cas about his family, but he didn’t want to upset him. Iit might be a sore subject.
Dean was pacing the shop. He had plans to propose to Cas, and he was discussing it with Scott and Ash, since he wanted to the band to do it. The Sadie Hawkins dance crap was coming up. Dean wasn’t a school dance type of guy, but he knew Cas wanted to go. And Dean thought it was the perfect thing to propose to Cas. Dean knew it was too soon. But Dean couldn’t help it. He loved Cas. And he knew Belle called him ‘Pop-Pop’. Dean knew in his heart this was the right thing to do. “What do I do, guys? I will die if he says no, I have to have the right song.”
The fact that Cas was all of a sudden seeing and talking to Gabrielle was news to Dean. “He’s out with his sister?” Dean was the only one who was keeping Gabrielle at length. Not because he didn’t like her, it was because he wasn’t sure just how long Cas would give her the benefit of the doubt. She just didn’t have a good chance with Cas. Dean knew that for a fact. “Look. I’m sorry I snapped.” Dean knew that Sam was going to be surprised that he’d said he was sorry. Dean didn’t often apologize for things like that. “I’m nervous.” Dean didn’t want to tell Sam, Sam might tell Jo. Dean wasn’t wanting to deal with Jo’s squealing and doing the whole girl thing. Dean wasn’t in the mood for that. And Dean didn’t want to have to ask Sam to lie to his girlfriend. Dean knew how shitty it was to have to lie to your girlfriend. Cas hopefully would never have to be on the receiving end of that. Dean caught Sam’s eye. “No, I’m not going to tell you what I’m worried about.” Dean told him, folding his arms. It was also true that Cas couldn’t really chase around with Belle due to having to still use his cane. Dean knew the doctor had tried to tell Cas it might be temporary. He also knew that Cas was still moping.
Chapter Two: Would I Lose
No this ain’t the way that
Cas let a smile play on his features. “Okay.” He said, and put the costume in his size in the cart. He had known Dean would choose the doctor costume. “Come on, we need something for dinner tonight.” Cas said, as he fell into step with Dean down the aisle. Belle was quiet, looking at her costume. Cas thought it was so cute that Belle was so into books. And she loved Charlie. Cas did too, she was such a quirky, interesting girl. Cas turned to his boyfriend. “What were you thinking of having? I’m not making tuna casserole again, we had it last week.”
That froze Dean as he moved to finish his bacon. Sam was working hard in school so he could go to college. Why would they plan for a baby? “Do you think Dad or Mama’s got a clue?” He asked, and she shook her head. When he asked if she’d heard or caught them, and she sheepishly nodded. Dean was glad it had been her and not their parents. “I can’t believe it. They’re being so stupid. Jo should at least be on the pill.” Dean knew that she still could be, it wasn’t impossible to get pregnant while on birth control. “I taught Sammy no glove, no love.” He said, shaking his head. Finishing up his second plate of food. “Change of subject, but we’ve got to go to Costco.”
“Dean, calm down. You have to be calm for Cas!” Scott said, and met Ash’s eye. He moved to stroke Dean’s back, and squeezed Dean’s hand. His thumb stroked the back of Dean’s hand. “You have got to try. And Cas could still pull through. Don’t start preparing for something that hasn’t even happened yet.” He wasn’t someone who hated, but he was hating Benny right now. He had gone after Cas based on rumors of how Dean might feel. Dean and Cas hadn’t started a relationship yet. And Scott felt like it was something that was inevitable. He had to believe that Cas was going to make it through this. He was a glass half full guy.
The following afternoon, Dean was leaving the diner in town with some hangover food to take home to his fiancé and Belle. That’s when a man he didn’t know stopped in front of him. Dean tried to move past him, and the man pushed Dean against a car in the parking lot. It was happening so fast Dean couldn’t stop it. The man unbuckled Dean’s belt, yanking his worn Wranglers down and his underwear, and took Dean from behind. Dean tried to get loose, but the man was stronger than he was. The man forced himself inside Dean, and Dean tried to cry out. The man reached and covered Dean’s mouth as his hips began to move as he raped him. Dean grasped at straws, hoping this man wouldn’t kill him. He felt tears falling down his cheeks. Dean wished he could do something to get away. He knew that this was going to bond him and Cas in a way that he’d never wanted. It was seeming to last forever, but it really only took a couple of minutes. To Dean’s relief, the man didn’t kill him. He just whispered something about how that was for Benny, and then left. Dean fumbled to get out his phone, to call the cops. Once they were on the way, he put himself back together, finding nothing like semen left on him. That didn’t surprise him. Dean slid to the ground by the car. He can see his own car from where he was, but he didn’t get up to go to it. He looked at the bag of food, which is amazingly untouched. He put his head in his hands.
When Cas saw Dean walking up his belly was full of butterflies. “I take it you’re all done with my car?” He asked. When Dean nodded and moved to the register, Cas’ hair had fallen over his eyes again. He didn’t move it. His blue eyes met Dean’s green ones. Cas didn’t know what to say. He pulled out his wallet as Dean told him the total. Cas handed him some cash. He would have to hit up an ATM soon. Cas didn’t want to pay with his credit and debit cards everywhere. Cas handed him the change. “No, you keep it.” Cas told him, and he knew better than to say that Dean most likely needed it.
Stiles noticed that Scott got quiet when Dean arrived. That was something that confused him. Dean and Scott were good friends. It’s nor like he had to clam up around him. Stiles nodded towards Dean. “You’re a lifesaver, man. The food here sucks the big one.” Stiles said, trying to keep it light. “Oddly enough though, insurance money from the crash is going to be enough to put in a handicap ramp.” Dean grinned, and they high fived. “Dad knows a guy, it’s gonna be up by the end of the week.” Stiles’ legs would be in casts for possibly months. His legs were broken, and would heal, but no one was sure if his spine had been injured permanently.
Dean hung on his father like he hadn’t done since he was four years old. Dean couldn’t believe any of this. When he was in high school, he’d done some hooking to help pay bills. He’d never told anyone, he’d told John that he’d hustled at pool and poker. He’d known how since he was nine. That was something Bobby had taught him to do. “It was so fast, Dad, I couldn’t stop it.” Dean knew he might have to tell Cas about the fact that he’d used to hook. Dean had usually been high or drunk when it was going on, so it might have been non consensual a few of those times. But this was different. It wasn’t something that Dean had had to put himself into. This hadn’t been planned.
It felt so domestic, and Cas knew it should freak him out, and it didn’t. Cas had never felt so happy in his entire life. Cas couldn’t imagine ever feeling safer in his life, either. He let Dean pull his chair out for him. The cane was still in use. Cas couldn’t stop thinking about how all Gabi could think about was herself and if Cas forgave her for what she’d done. Cas knew it would seem trivial with what Benny had done to him. But it wasn’t. Gabi had let his parents disown him for being gay. When she was at least bisexual herself. Cas was having a hard time letting that go. “Jody likes your dad then?” Cas asked, after he realized he’d been silent too long.
“fuck you” to him. “It’s going to be okay, baby. Okay, Scotty?”
Only Scott had come with him, Jo and Sam were with Belle at his place. Dean could barely breathe, he was so scared. Why? Why had Benny taken it this far? Why did Cas have to be hurt? Every medical professional that walked by Dean offered to look at his injuries. Dean shook his head, and reached out, groping for Scott’s hand. Finally, Scott let him find it, and Dean held on tightly. He couldn’t wrap his mind around this. Tears fell down his cheeks. “Fucking Benny. I’ll kill him.” Dean’s tone was dark and evil, and Dean had to hate himself for that. “Why Cas? Why… why do I even….” Dean knew he was babbling and he couldn’t stop. Scott let him, and Dean’s chin began to tremble. Dean couldn’t believe this. He also had to admit that he did have feelings for Castiel. Strong ones. His free hand brushed over his trembling jaw. Dean hadn’t ever been this messed up about someone before. Not even Justine. “What…. What if he doesn’t make it? I know why he did it. He thinks… Benny is obsessed and thinks that he and I still have a shot at being together.” This was said half in shock, even if it wasn’t something that had come as a total surprise.
Once he’d said that, Jo looked around and her eyes lit on Castiel. He was just as mysterious as Ash was. Since no one knew Cas’ last name and he too was from Away. Jo ate some of her ice cream. Her mind was mostly on Decoration Day. Everyone went out to the cemetery and decorated their loved one’s graves. In your Sunday best, and there was always food. It was coming up. Jo’s father was gone, he’d been killed in a car accident, and it had been a huge scandal at the time, because the other driver had been a minor, drunk, and the mayor’s son. Jo hadn’t really known what to think at the time. She still didn’t, but she understood better now that she was older. And the boy was in a federal prison for life. Jo had only been seven at the time. Jo brushed blonde hair behind her ear. “Sam, are you worried about D Day?” She knew he would know what she meant. “Because… it’s the first time I’ve gone… or will go, I mean. I’m….. I was too little before, according to Mama.” Jo wasn’t sure what she was going to do when she saw his grave. She was thinking about it all the time, and it was going to happen next week. “What’s it like for you, when you see your mama’s grave?” This was said quietly. Jo wasn’t sure that she wanted to hear the answer honestly, but she knew Sam would be honest because that's what Sam did. Dean lied on occasion, but Sam didn’t.
Cas had stayed in town. He was more or less settled in. No one had come after him, which led him to think and believe that no one from his family was looking for him. Cas had fake IDs that said he was 18, just in case. He hadn’t enrolled in Gatlin’s high school. He just wasn’t sure that he should. He would be easier for someone to find. At the moment, he was going to get some ice cream at the Tastee Queen. The equivalent of the DQ Blizzard. He was walking, it wasn’t far from his hotel room. There was lots of talking and staring as he went. As he went anywhere, walking or driving. There hadn’t been anymore interactions with Dean. It had made Cas sad though. Although all the kids from the high school kept trying to be his friend. Dean’s bandmate, that Scott fellow, seemed to be trying the hardest. Cas couldn’t figure out why, he’d caught Scott making out with that Stiles kid. So he knew that it wasn’t in a romantic way. Cas had never had so much gossip going around about him in… well ever. Cas approached the ice cream joint and stood in line to wait. He caught a glimpse of that Jo girl who Sam seemed so fond of. She was ahead of him in line. Sam was actually with her. Cas wasn’t sure if he wanted to see them, he was having wet dreams about Dean just about every night. Not that he would tell Sam about it but it would be a lot awkward.
Author’s note: Sorry for the cliffhanger. I usually try not to do that. I’m not sure at all what will happen next, but Destiel and Sciles are both solid. Cailtyn’s PB is Naomi Scott, because I love her. Not sure if I’ll hook up Charlie and Gabrielle, we’ll see. Hope ya’ll are hanging in!
“I’m glad that I could help. I’ve got to go now though, dinner. You and Scott will have great sex.” He said bye and hung up. Gathering everything, he headed back out to the living room. Belle was telling Cas about what she’d been playing outside with Ash. Dean handed her the chocolate milk, and then opened the first pizza box. He’d gotten meat lovers, if he was going to die from fatty foods, Dean wanted it to be bacon. He’d win that way. Dean looked at his boyfriend. “Wait till I tell you. Stiles called.”
Jo arched up under Sam’s touch. She was ready for more. And she knew Sam might take some convincing to get that she was ready. “Sam, I want more.” Jo said against Sam’s lips. He pulled back to look into her eyes. “I mean it, bae. I want to make love to you.” Jo reached into her jeans pocket and pulled out a condom. “Please, Sam. You can’t take advantage if I want it.” They began kissing again, this time taking off clothes. Sam moved down between Jo’s legs, and his tongue slipped along her folds, which were already starting to get wet. Jo’s hand went into Sam’s hair and ran her fingers through it as he also eased a finger into her.
This was surprising to Dean. That Ash was ending their friends with benefits situation. “You can do this, end things, it’s fine. We’ll be friends even without the fucking. But if you’re doing this to free me up for Castiel… it’s not going to happen. Do you hear me? Because I’m not going to lie and tell you that I’m in love with you. I’m not. But I don’t want ya’ll trying to fix me up because I was attracted to him. You know I don’t do that love at first sight thing. You… ya’ll should remember how fixing me up with Benny went.” Dean rolled his eyes. He was so angry that they had done that. He and Benny didn’t even speak to each other anymore. Dean missed Benny. “Is this that, or are you and Garth a thing again?”
That was the question Cas had been dreading. “Um, it doesn’t matter, really.” Cas said, and turned to go. That’s when little arms wrapped around his legs. Cas looked down at Belle, wondering why the little girl was hugging him. Sam came up behind her, saying he was sorry. Cas’ breath was coming in short gasps. Dean was a father. He shouldn’t be pursuing anything with Dean. Cas mumbled something that it was okay with him as Sam leaned down to pick her up. Cas’ eyes met those green ones, so like Dean’s. What Cas was going to do if someone found out he ran away wasn’t on his mind anymore. All he could think about was how much those eyes were like Dean’s. “I’m Castiel.” He said, and offered his hand to Sam, and then Belle, who was holding out her hands for Cas. He was surprised, kids didn’t really take to him like that. “I can’t hold you if your daddy doesn’t say it’s okay.” Cas told her. His heart was pounding when Dean said it was okay. His hands shaking a bit, he took Belle from her uncle’s arms and clutched her to his chest. Her tiny hands went around his neck. Cas hadn’t ever had a toddler before. She was beautiful. More beautiful than any baby he had ever seen. Cas was looking back at her with his eyes just as wide as her green ones were. “You are just like your daddy.” He said, his tone in awe. Cas knew that this little girl had him wrapped around her little finger already.
Chapter Five: Dancin’ Just For Me
Before Cas could reply, his boyfriend came back in with Stiles, and Dean was passing around bowls of ice cream and Stiles put down some pizza rolls on a big plate and put it within reach. Cas accepted the bowl (a styrofoam one that would get tossed out) from Dean, and then a long, lingering kiss. Then Dean was whispering in his ear. He wanted to lay Cas on the bed, and then Dean would ride his cock. Cas’ face was flushed, but agreed to this. Everyone was going to sleep over, so they’d have to be quiet. His mind was trying to wrap itself around the idea that Dean and Ash had slept together. And more than once. He had suspected, but that was different. He wasn’t the least bit jealous. Cas knew how much Dean loved him. But he wished that Dean had told him. Dean settled on Cas’ lap, and Cas, still eating his ice cream, looked into Dean’s intense green eyes. “Why didn’t you tell me you and Ash used to be fuck buddies?” Cas didn’t curse often, but it seemed appropriate for their current situation. “You’re my first, Dean. You know all of my exes because I don’t have any. Why didn’t you tell me?”
Sharing a look with the room, Dean approached her. “You need to leave for right now.” Dean could see that that was upsetting to her. “I’m sorry. But Scott’s boyfriend has just woken from a huge trauma. He almost died. He’s got too much going on to have you to deal with.” Dean refused to let this girl see Scott right now. He just needed time to deal with Stiles before he dealt with this. “Not to mention, we need time to prove you are who you say that you are.” They all watched as she nodded, and headed off  to leave. Dean move and grabbed Cas’ hand and they moved off to talk alone. “Look, Cas, this whole any one of us could have almost died thing…..” His boyfriend only looked back at him, an eyebrow raised. “I just want to know if we’re actually going somewhere. That we aren’t just fooling around. That we have something serious.” Dean knew he was still young for him to be wanting that, but he’d been an adult as soon as Belle was born. “I love you. I do. I love you so much it should scare me, but it doesn’t.” Dean leaned out to kiss him. “I want to know there’s a reason that we’re together.”
Sniffling, Dean reached out and laced his fingers with Cas’. “They’re keeping me overnight for observation. They found some semen, and it needs tested in case he had an STD.” Dean closed his eyes as Cas squeezed his fingers tightly. “I…. I don’t want to be sick. Belle, I can’t… she needs me. She already lost her mama. She can’t lose me too.” Dean sniffled again, and Cas lifted the bag of food he’d brought with him. Dean gave him a watery smile, and Cas pulled out the burgers and fries he’d brought him. And the chocolate milkshake. He opened one of the burgers and took a large bite. He chewed, and met Cas’ eyes. “I love you, so much.” He said, as there was a knock on the door.
It’s not time for conversation no
Once Belle was back to the tv, Dean said, “You are fine just the way you are. And I’ll share my family with you. They’re the best guy could ask for. My dad can be a bit strict, but it’s okay. Sam and I know it’s because he can’t beat to lose us. So I get it. Especially now that I’ve got Belle. I know what it’s like to be afraid you might lose your kid. Dad can be a bit grouchy too but he’s great.” Dean opened the second pizza box. He could really eat when he wanted to. “Bobby helped Dad raise us, and we had Ellen to ask things that a mom would know.”
“Dean, you’ve got to stop hating her. Do you really want to throw away the cash she gives us for playing?” Scott’s mom was just as strapped for cash. She was a nurse at the only hospital in town, but it didn’t pay super well. Scott wasn’t sure where the Martins’ money came from but Lydia could afford to have their band play anytime she needed them. “Some of us, including you, need that money.” Dean sang lead and played guitar, Scott played bass and sang backup. Ash was their drums player. They were actually pretty good. Dean had only ever thought of his voice unseriously till he had happened to play with Scott one day. Scott was glad that he had, honestly.
Scott, covered in tats all over his arms and a few on his legs, had longish curly black hair. His face, like Dean’s, was a bit scruffy. He gave Bobby an uneasy look as he walked off. Dean looked at Scott. Scott had feelings for his best friend Stiles, but Dean Winchester was the hottest guy in Gatlin. Scott couldn’t help but admire him. “You hear about…” He started to ask, and then saw the G6. “You got the new guy’s car?” Scott cried out loud. Dean looked at him with an eyebrow raised. “He got here a couple of hours ago, Dean. It’s all over school.” Scott was kind of bummed Dean had his GED. Otherwise, he’d be finishing up this year. “What’s he like?” Scott had grown up in Gatlin as well as the Winchesters.
‘Cause you got me and I’ll show you
All of what Cas was saying was good until Dean heard the his parents might get him thing. His grip on Cas’ hand tightened, and he leaned out to kiss him. Deeply, and he cradled the back of Cas’ head. His fingers played with the hair at the nape of his neck, earning a soft groan from the other boy. He pulled back to speak. “Hell no, Cas. I will not let them take you anywhere. You shouldn’t have to live with anyone who doesn’t accept you. You want to stay here. I won’t let anyone take you away from me.” Dean brushed the tears off his face. “You can tell me all of it when you’re ready. But I know that you don’t want to live with them, or you wouldn’t have left.” Dean was so so very grateful for John and Bobby. Before Dean could say anything else to convince Cas, the sheriff came in. Jodi Mills, they’d known her forever. Dean knew Cas would love her. “I’m guessing that you’re here to ask about the attack. I’ll go, see if maybe I can get my hands on some pies.” Dean gave Cas’ hand a good squeeze and then leaned down to kiss Cas softly on the lips. “We’ll talk later, I promise. Love you.” Dean whispered against his lips.
Sipping his milkshake, Dean knew Jodi would do everything she could to make sure she caught the guy. “Is Dad coming soon, Mama?” Dean asked, as he stuffed a few fries in his mouth. She told him that John was indeed on his way. Dean visibly relaxed, and he opened his second burger. He was honestly trying to keep his mind off everything that had gone down. Dean had never even thought something like this would happen to him. It had been crazy enough that it had happened to Cas. “Mama, can you stay until Dad gets here?” Dean was legally an adult, but he felt like he was a kid again. He just wanted someone to tell him it was all going to be okay. Dean knew it wouldn’t be, at least for a long while.
I can’t believe how bad
“I just know what you like.” Cas told him. He ate a piece of bacon. Dean had taken off a couple of weeks of work (thankfully with pay) and Cas had taken his GED. So they had some time together. Cas had come into his trust, and they didn’t have to worry about money. He wasn’t eighteen, but a clause had stated that if his parents died before his 18th birthday, he came into it automatically. He’d found out the day before his parents were dead, and the money was his. Cas hadn’t even asked what had happened. He didn’t care. They had tossed him aside  because of his love for men. Something that he couldn’t help. He wasn’t going to be sentimental about their deaths. Just sort of relieved.
Trying not to drool, he headed across the hot asphalt to go inside. Cas really didn’t know what to say to the Adonis should he have to speak to them. He was just drop dead gorgeous and Cas had come out just a couple of weeks ago. And now he was letting himself appreciate boys. Once he got inside, the hot guy was looking at this huge book and the toddler sat on the counter jabbering yo an older but ruggedly gorgeous man, calling him Grandpa. Cas’ eyes widened. This must be the Adonis’ father. Cas cleared his throat, keys and phone in hand. They both turned to look at him. “Um, I’m driving a Chevy, I need an oil change.” His accent probably sounded weird to them, he was sure. Cas brushed some of his black hair out of his eyes. He was letting it grow now that he was on his own. He was scared, but he was glad that he’d done what he’d done. Cas needed to be on his own. The best part was that they couldn’t take his trust fund from him. Cas could support himself, even if he didn’t want to use their money. He really didn’t have much choice. “It’s the blue G6 outside.” He could feel himself blushing as he spoke. The boy’s overalls said “Dean”. He had a name.
How much I want to be on your tattooed heart
One week later
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you
All of my love, all of my love
Repeating the sentiments, Cas watched Dean leave the room. Why was Dean so sure he could protect Cas like that? Then he turned his gaze to Jodi. “Hello, Sheriff Mills.” He said, blinking at the brightness of the lights, evening was starting to begin. Cas looked rough, he had cuts and bruises all over his face, cracked ribs, a broken leg, and a concussion. He wiped his face with his hand carefully. “I know what you’re going to start with. Benny attacked because of Dean. He thinks that…” Cas broke off. Then he took up again. “Benny is jealous that Dean and I are in love, and Dean turned him down. So he’s trying to get rid of me, like that would fix things with Dean.” Cas tried to keep the anger out of his voice. “He clearly needs some professional help. All I was doing was heading back home from Tastee Freeze. I had walked, because it’s not far from my place. He came out of nowhere, started beating the shit out of me. For about twenty minutes, and then someone from school found me. I passed out, and I don’t remember anything else till a couple of hours ago.” It hadn’t been hard to get through. “I don’t know anything else. But it was definitely Benny.” He reached for his water and carefully took a long gulp.
That was something that Jo had heard. Gatlin was so small. “You don’t have to feel guilty about not feeling the same as Dean and John.” He insisted she call him that. J wasn’t sure if she really should but John was not a man to be disobeyed. “You can’t feel what they feel. I… I miss my dad. But… I don’t know what it’s going to feel like to see his grave. I was at the funeral but Mama never let me near the grave.” Jo ate some more ice cream. “I’m…. I’m wish that you’d gotten more time with your mama. And Sam… you know that I wouldn’t listen to gossip about her. You ask John the truth if you have to know.”
It was obvious that Scott was still bothered by the fact that there were things Stiles didn’t recall. He had wrapped an arm around Scott’s waist, and his fingers slipped up underneath Scott’s tee shirt, to stroke his abs. “You don’t have to hide anything from me. I know that you’re upset that I can’t remember the start of us. Or any other awful thing that’s happened recently.” Stiles could feel Scott shivering under his touch. “I’m really looking forward to sleeping with you again. And it’s okay with me sort of that I don’t remember, it’s like I’m a virgin again.” This made Scott look up, a small smile playing on his lips. “I kind of really like that idea, bae.”
Sharing a look with Ash, Scott turned to look back at Dean. “The song you sing isn’t going to be what gets him to say yes or not. And you know that, Dean.” Scott also didn’t have any suggestions on songs. Plus, Dean could be really picky with song selection. Scott brushed his hand through his black curls, which fell exactly back where they had been. Dean had started pacing again. “You’re going to make me throw up if you keep doing that.” Scott admonished him, trying to keep his voice light. Arguing with Dean was not something that Scott wanted to do. And he also knew Dean was just nervous about how the whole proposal thing was going to go. Scott thought Dean was doing the right thing.
Sizing Dean up, Ash pulled out his vape pen. “You are going to tell me you didn’t notice that Cas is very hot?” He asked, as Dean rolled his eyes. “I not telling you to go for it. What I am telling you is, that kid out there… he could be good for you. You know that you haven’t been serious with anyone since Justine left. And I’m not saying that’s a bad thing. But Dean… you know that you feel attracted to him. You know that. You never let anyone hold Belle. And you know it. Dean… I’ve been worried about you. And you can’t use me for sex anymore. Because I’m not into you like that, and you aren’t with me. It’s time.”
Looking at Ash, Sam said, “She’s doing an errand for Ellen.” Sam felt like something was off with Ash. He was hiding something. Sam just wasn’t sure what. He watched Ash’s features as Sam spoke. He looked like he was under strain of hiding something. Sam then turned to his brother. “What are you guys doing anyway? There’s no gig for anything that you need to practice for.” Sam was kind of angry a lot lately because of the abuse at school he was getting because of Callie. People were still talking about stuff Mary had done and Dean’s baby mama leaving. Sam was tired of the small town ways of Gatlin. As soon as he was eighteen, he was out of here. He was going to college.
Callie could tell that her brother needed a change of subject. “So, Dean. If you and Cas want to go out tonight, I can watch Belle.” Callie sipped her Coke. She caught her brother’s green eyes. He was very upset, she could tell by the pain she saw in those emerald green irises. Callie reached across the table and took his free hand and briefly squeezed it. Then she let go, knowing that he wasn’t one for doing so unless it was Cas. Callie knew it had something to do with losing his mother. Callie had heard the stories about Mary. It was hard not to when you lived in Gatlin. Callie didn’t know what to believe, and she hadn’t asked any of the family about it, she didn’t want to upset anyone. And Sam didn’t even remember her. Callie thought that was sad. She knew some of what Dean was going through. Callie hadn’t been through what he had, but she knew that Cas had. She thought the small silver lining was that at least they could find comfort in each other. That would help them both. Callie looked at Belle. “Would you want to spend the night with me and Grandpa and Gramma?” She asked. Belle gave her a nod and a wide smile. “Even if you don’t go out, you could use some time alone.” She set her blue eyes on Cas then, and he nodded, giving her a soft smile of thanks. She hoped it was going to be beneficial for them, as the food came.
Considering with what they were dealing with, this wasn’t surprising to Cas that they were here. He brushed a hand through his hair. All of this should be scaring him. But it wasn’t. Cas just didn’t know what to say. Because he didn’t know exactly what Dean was thinking by starting this. He did note that Dean was fully present, and he wasn’t trying to look away from Cas. He reached out and took Cas’ hand. “I love you, Dean. I’ve not even graduated from high school yet. But none of this is freaking me out like it should be.” Cas sees the partial joy in Dean’s face. “One day at a time?”
“What do you think, Dean?” Came the sarcastic reply. “If I had, I wouldn’t be so grouchy. I don’t know how you ever got along with Ash sleeping in the same bed. He kicks like an Olympic swimmer.” Stiles brushed his hand through his messed up bed head. “And I love Scott with every fiber of my being but he’s like a furnace he’s so warm.” Stiles added some cream and sugar to his coffee. “They caught Benny.” Stiles told him. He’d already caught up on the news that morning. “There was a shootout. He didn’t make it.” He watched the emotions on his friend’s face. “Dean, he admitted that he raped Cas. It’s all over the news. Can…. he might lose his shit.”
Just as long as I’m the name on your tattooed heart
As Stiles dug into his ice cream, Scott asked Dean, “Is Cas here?” He really wanted to see his friend and unload. Scott really liked the advice that Cas would give him about things. Scott liked Cas’ world view. He tried to keep his face falling as Dean told him no, he was with Belle. Scott nodded. He got why they hadn’t brought his daughter here. As well as Belle behaved, it was still a hospital and who knew how long this would take? Even with this being a very small town hospital. Scott nodded when Stiles asked if he wanted some bites of his ice cream, and took them, vanilla and M&Ms filling his mouth.
This is when Callie got home, carrying bags of McDonald’s takeout. It was about ten minutes out of town, though. “I got dinner. Since I know Dad’s out.” Even if he wasn’t, he wasn’t the best cook. Callie looked at them. Something was off. She put down the takeout on the coffee table. “What were you guys doing?” She asked, her blue eyes taking them both in. Callie also noticed their flushed faces and Jo was trying to fix her hair. “Oh my God, you guys had sex! What if Dad had come home?!” Callie wasn’t going to tell him, but they’d taken a very big risk.
The following morning, Dean was up at nine, fixing breakfast. John would be there with Belle soon. As he was mixing up the pancake batter, Stiles came in. He mumbled to him, asking Dean about if there was coffee. Dean nodded. “Your boyfriend still asleep?” Dean asked, adding some batter to the griddle. Stiles grunted an affirmative, and Den studied him. “Did you get lucky last night?” He was actually kind of anxious to know if Scott and Stiles had had sex yet. He’d not gotten the final word yet and he had to admit, Stiles had confided in him, he couldn’t help but wonder if it had gone down.
That was intriguing. Cas accepted the can of Coke Dean gave him. Dean had one, too, he wouldn’t drink alcohol until Belle was in bed. Not even one. Cas loved that he was such a great dad. He bit into a slice of pizza. Belle had My Little Pony on, and wasn’t paying attention. Or it seemed that way, that is. Cas looked at Dean. “I’m very curious. It’s gotta be interesting if Stiles is involved.” Cas liked the other boy, but he was a weird guy. Cas was curious about his dad as well, Noah Stilinski was on the police force. Used to be sheriff before Jodi.
“Yeah, she asked him out. I told him to go. I’m sure he’s not been celebate all these years, but he’s never had a serious girlfriend. Not even a casual one. So I think him at least going out with her once is a good idea.” Dean really wanted his dad to be happy. He knew too that despite what Mary had done, John had still been in love with her. Dean thought his dad would probably always love her, despite what she’d done. Dean couldn’t be that way. He hated Belle’s mama for leaving, and he always would. She had left her child. Belle was too young to remember. She might one day ask about her mama, and Dean could cross that bridge later.
Won’t you let me know now
Dean listened as Cas gave him all the details, and his blood boiled. “Cas, baby, you should have told me. I get why you didn’t tell the cops. Jodi though, she’d’ve believed you. But you should have told me. It’s a good thing that it wasn’t your first time.” Dean knew that Cas had to be dealing with a lot because of this. He rubbed Cas’ back. “I won’t let anyone else hurt you like that ever again.” Dean couldn’t believe that Benny had done this. He supposed that it shouldn’t be, since they knew now that e was psychotic. He moved to kiss Cas, softly and soundly. “I’m so so sorry that he did that to you.”
This is when Dean knocks on the door, and they looked over to him. Dean was grinning, and carrying a huge ice cream treat. It was the Tastee Freeze’s version of a Blizzard. “Thought you might be hungry.” Dean said, as he came inside. Stiles grinned back at him, and he took it. Dean looked at Scott, who got up off of Stiles’ lap so he could eat it. Dean watched as Scott sat in a chair by Stiles, and he could tell that Scott was bummin’. Dean wasn’t sure if he asked, if Scott would tell him. He knew that Scott would tell Cas though. Dean liked that, Cas needed someone like Scott.
We’ll get to rollin’
“What the fuck, Ash?! Why are you fucking Benny of all people? Because I know what ‘spending time’ as you put it, means. You and him are banging. He wasn’t even into you! He’s just using you to get to me! And don’t tell me that it’s my ego talking. Because you know it’s not!” Dean was trying to break out of Scott’s grip. The shorter boy was very strong. Dean couldn’t stop feeling the rage going out of him. He bit his lip. “What if Cas dies? Did you even think of that?! Because clearly Benny is fucking psychotic and no one caught it!” Dean’s eyes were pouring tears, and his breath was coming in gasps.
His boyfriend wasn’t using an angry tone, it was a hurt one. Dean wished that he wasn’t so fucked up right now, only in that he wouldn’t end up saying the wrong thing. Dean, who had already finished his ice cream, put it aside and looked into Cas’ blue eyes. “I’m… I’m not into Ash, and you know that. I’m in love with you. But I know that you know that. I wasn’t trying to keep anything from you. I just, it wasn’t as big of a deal with me as it was with Ash. And I wanted you and Ash to get along. Ash is a great guy, and he's family to me.” He accepted the vape and took a couple of hits and passed it to Cas.
“I can’t see your dad and Jodi as a couple.” Cas giggled. He looked back at Dean, who had one expectant look on his face. “Guess it’s my turn. Okay, I came out to my parents a couple of months ago, and they told me I wasn’t going to be gay. They wanted me to go to a camp to turn me straight. I refused, and left.” Cas didn’t really want to talk about this, but he knew that it was prudent if they were going to be boyfriends. Cas got another slice of pizza. “That’s how I ended up here. And I’m glad.” Cas was just in awe that this beautiful, handsome boy wanted to be with him. He winced a bit as he reached for his pills. Dean admonished him lightly for not asking for help. “I’m sorry, you know that I like to do for myself.” Cas said. He took them, they worked better on a full stomach, and he was halfway there. He was quiet as Belle held out her paper plate for another slice. She looked so much like Dean it was hilarious. Only in that he’d never be able to deny she was his. Cas stuck his tongue out at her, and she giggled. Cas couldn’t believe that her mother had left. It was so crazy.
Would I lose, oh, if I bet my heart on you
She didn’t know why she had taken the chance and come here. Scott would be surrounded by his friends. Caitlyn took a deep breath. “I’m not here to crash anything.” She said, shaking her head. She wasn’t wearing a costume, and her long hair was braided as per usual. “I just wanted to talk to Scott.” Caitlyn knew it might be seen as tacky to just show up on him. He couldn’t get away, and she had been told to wait until Scott called her. She backed up a little as Scott stepped up to her. “I’m sorry, I just couldn’t wait. I only have so much time here before I have to go.” Caitlyn didn’t know what else to say, and she was hoping there wouldn’t be a fight. That wasn’t what she had come for. She gave him a half smile.
Nodding as Cas assured him that he’d not wanted that, Ash moved to add fresh weed to what they’d had already. Ash could be pretty chill pretty much 24/7. “It’s okay, baby. I know why Dean had to be angry with me about it. Dean and I….” Ash paused, not sure how Cas would take this information. “Dean and I used to… hook up. It wasn’t a serious thing. I was ready to be with him, but Dean only saw me as a friend. And I’d never try and come between you two. My point being, I know Dean pretty well. So you don’t have to feel guilty. Dean and I always work things out.”
That was exactly what Dean wanted, but he would go for something else for Cas. Dean loved him so much he would do anything for him. It was amazing, the feelings that he had for Cas. He’d never loved anyone else this way. He turned to Cas as they reached the food side of Walmart. “Cas, will you marry me?” He asked, and Cas turned to look at him, his  eyes wide and filling with tears. Dean knew they were happy ones. “I love you more than I’ve ever loved anyone. Belle loves you. The whole family loves you. I know it’s so soon, but I love you and we do live together.” Dean took one of Cas’ hands in his.
That Friday night, it was the back to school dance. Scott and Stiles were on their way in Stiles’ Jeep. Scott didn’t know what to say to Stiles. They knew what was going to happen after the dance. They both were nervous, that was a given. Scott ran his palms along his slacks, they were a bit sweaty. He finally reached out and gave Stiles’ thigh a squeeze. They had come to a stop in a parking space at the school. Scott unbuckled and moved over to sit on Stiles’ lap. He watched his boyfriend’s eyes widen. Scott settled his hands on Stiles’ hips, and then kissed him deeply, sucking on Stiles’ tongue. A soft groan emitted from Stiles, and Scott took that as a yes. He moved to Stiles’ button on his slacks and worked Stiles out of them. His hand took Stiles’ cock and began to stroke, as Stiles’ hands went to free Scott’s cock out of its own prison. Neither of them seemed to mind that this was happening here and now. Scott moved, lifting Stiles enough to pull his pants and underwear out of the way, and wet two of his fingers, sliding them in Stiles’ entrance.
I saw you smile back
John nodded. “Make sure he’s got his homework. Last time he didn’t and got suspended. It’s like he’s trying to give me a heart attack.” Which was very very funny because he was in great shape. He reached to grab Belle before she overturned a pile of papers. “Tell Bobby to come and watch the counter if he’s not busy, so I can watch Belle.” The Dean getting his girlfriend pregnant thing had been the biggest scandal Gatlin had had in years. John had been ready to kill him. But as soon as that baby had been born, she was loved by everyone, and John was wrapped around her finger. John couldn’t believe that her mother had left. Dean was still angry about it as well. John didn’t blame him. But Dean’s whole life revolved around Belle. John knew that Dean had gone out a few times, but nothing serious. John had to admit, he was worried about that. Dean’s first girlfriend had left, but Dean had to move on. He knew how lonely Dean was. John eyed the boy who had come in. Maybe this kid would be the one to get Dean back out there for real. “It shouldn’t take long, kiddo, for Dean to change your oil.” He said, as Ash headed outside. Belle was peering at Cas from John’s shoulder. He was holding her. “You can go get some coffee and a doughnut over there.” He pointed towards the corner, some seats and a table was set up.
It was very soon. It had only been months. But Cas loved Dean. He loved his life with him. Cas hadn’t thought that he’d found the one when he was just in high school, but they had been through so much, and they were still going strong. Cas looked at their joined hands, and Cas said, “Dean, I love you so much. You have saved me in so many ways. I don’t know what I’d do without you. The thought of it scares me, and while that should scare me, it doesn’t. It is so fast, but when you know, you know. Yes, I will marry you.” Cas said, and he didn’t even care that it was spur of the moment. That made it so much more romantic.
About a half an hour later, Dean was working on dinner in the kitchen. Belle was playing in the living room, and Dean heard the front door open. “Hey, babe.” Dean called out. He’d decided to let Cas tell him about Cas hanging out with his sister. Dean hated when Gatlin gossiped about his family, and he didn’t want Cas to have to feel the same. Dean was working on fried chicken and mashed potatoes. Dean always did boneless chicken, easier for Belle to eat it. “How was your day?” Dean asked, wondering what Cas was going to say. If he was going to tell Dean that he’d had lunch with Gabrielle or not. Dea hoped that he would be honest.
The next few days were hard on Scott. Stiles was still unconscious, and Scott spent as much time as he could in the hospital. Dean had put the proposal on hold, and they weren’t playing the dance. It had been called off because the mayor had been killed in the wreck. Scott was just getting to the hospital now, hoping Stiles had woken up. Cas was with him. Scott had barely been sleeping. He looked like a car crash victim himself. He had deep circles under his eyes and a four day stubble. He led them down the hall to Stiles’ room, telling Cas that he was going to have to do his homework. Melissa would check on him to make sure that he was doing it. Scott settled in the armchair by Stiles’ bed, and Cas took the seat by the window. Scott was working on a book report for Jacob Have I Loved. Next up was The Outsiders. Scott was just wondering why the LGBT community was being left out. Like Fangirl and the Simon Snow books. “Thanks for coming with me, Cas.” Scott said, he truly was grateful. They had gotten closer and closer. Scott felt bad that Cas and Dean weren’t engaged right now. He knew that he couldn’t mention it to Cas, but he still felt guilty. He glanced at Stiles, who still hadn’t woken up, and his legs were both broken.
The gall of Ash was getting to Dean. He gripped Scott’s hand tightly. He knew that he was having a panic attack. He tried to breathe, and Scott helped him sit down. Even with how pissed he was with Ash, Dean buried his face in Ash’s shoulder, and the older man’s arm slid around Dean’s shoulders. Dean let Scott hold his hand, and squeezed tighter still. A whimpering breath left him, and he felt his heart pounding out of his chest. Sobs shook his body, and Dean managed to speak. “Ash, I can’t…. Cas is… I shouldn’t feel this way yet. We barely know each other.” His head stayed where it was.
Stiles wasn’t surprised that they wanted to check Scott out. In the end, they gave him a shot, telling him it was a sedative. Scott had refused to tell them why he was in shock like that. Stiles put Scott up on the couch, which Ash had set to rights, and it had been decided that Cas was going to the hospital. Dean had hurriedly changed his clothes, and asked the rest of them to look after Belle when John finally arrived. Stiles told him that he would. Ash had work, but Stiles was sure that he could handle it. Scott had already fallen back to sleep from the medicine. As Ash was leaving, John arrived with Belle.
Gabrielle looked at him, she guessed he was just a bit older than Cas was. “I’m sorry. I’m 16, it’s not like I could just come.” She said. Gabrielle wasn’t sure she liked guys, but if she did, Dean would be a good lay. “I had to get away. But I’m here. I assume you’re the one who’s dating my brother?” She asked, and Dean nodded slightly. “Look. I know Cassie thinks that I want nothing to do with him. But that isn’t true. I don’t care if he’s gay. Whatever makes him happy is fine with me. I… I kind of ran away from home, too. But I got emancipated first.” Usually that took time, but Gabrielle knew the right people to get things moving quickly. She smiled at Dean’s surprise.
He answered by kissing him deeply. “I did want to. I just… I’m scared to death, and not just about Benny. I’m…. attached so hard to you and Belle. I… I can’t see a future without you. We haven’t even known each other six months. I’m still finishing high school. I….” Cas’ eyes had started leaking tears. He was thinking forever. “You’re my first everything, Dean. You’re older than I am, you’re a parent. And a great one at that. I don’t know if I’m… if I’m ready to be a stepdad. We’re all too attached too soon. I can’t… what if we break up? I’ll be devastated.”
Sippin’ on that drink
Dean moved to start changing in the new oil on Castiel’s car. “You know she only asks us to play because this town loves to gossip about me.” He rolled his eyes. He’d slid underneath to get the pans out of the way. Now, he moved to put in the new oil. “I don’t want to ask Dad to keep an eye on Belle for a fucking Lydia Martin party.” Dean’s tone was final. Dean didn’t want to play at her party. And it wasn’t because he was legally an adult now. Dean just didn’t like her. All of the age appropriate girls in Gatlin hit on Dean, and she was one of them. Dean had no desire for any girl, especially a high school one.
Stiles pulled back to breathe, and he just wondered what had happened. Then he started to get flashes, of the car hitting his and sliding on the rain soaked road. Stiles looked at Scott. His hand reached out and took Scott’s, lacing their fingers together, and took Scott’s, lacing their fingers together, and took a deep, shaky breath. “Oh, babe.” Was all he could say at the moment. Nurses came in, and started fussing over him, but all Stiles could focus on was Scott. He tugged Scott’s face down towards him to kiss him. “I love you, I love you so so so much.” He had almost died, and he just couldn’t stop touching Scott. He had to know he was real.
“Fuck, bae!” Scott gasped, Stiles was so tight. Maybe he’d never pegged himself before. Scott had. He let out another groan. “I’m going to come, bae, I wish I could last longer.” He gasped. Scott kissed him once more, and he was coming, his hands gripping Stiles’ hips tightly. Stiles was coming then, too, his hands wrapped tightly around Scott’s waist. They kissed once more, and then Scott moved to take off the condom on Stiles’ cock, tying it off so they could throw it away. Scott moved to make sure there wasn’t any cum on Stiles or the driver seat, and then got himself put back together, and got out so Stiles could do the same.
All of that was actually great advice. Sam put down his empty cup. “You have to go, Jobelle. You can’t not go. You might regret it. If you want, I’ll go with you and Miss Ellen. Dad’ll say it’s okay because you’ve never been to Decoration Day before.” Sam broke off as Dean’s friend Scott approached. He was 16, two years older than Sam. He went to the high school too. Sam was smart for his age, so he was in some of Scott’s classes. Sam knew something was up when he saw the look on Scott’s face. “What’s wrong?” Summer was almost over, and school would be starting back up. Lydia Martin’s blowout was the last of the summer. The classes Sam had been taking and Jo had been for extra credit.
“You roll your eyes at me again boy and I’ll smack ‘em out of your head.” Bobby told him. “You need to start dating again. I know that you want an actual relationship. John wasn’t a monk, why should you be?” That’s when Dean’s little friend, a couple of years younger, but older than Sam, came walking up. His name was Scott. He was in that band Dean thought was going to get him somewhere. It’s not that Dean wasn’t talented, but he had Belle. That kind of limited his options. Bobby wasn’t sure what to think about Scott McCall. “You better not distract him, Scooter.” Bobby said, ignoring the protests of both of them. Scott was also bisexual, so that was something.
This was what Ash had been dreading. That Dean would bring this up. Ash wasn’t sure what to do. Dean was asking him to be honest. Ash wasn’t one to lie to Dean often. Only when the truth was going to hurt Dean did Ash lie to him. This was going to hurt Dean and cause drama they didn’t need. The group was still trying to get used to having Callie in their lives. As brushed his hand through his hair and looked at Dean. “Look. I don’t hate Cas. I don’t. I know you think I do. I’m sorry if I made you feel that way.” Ash honestly was. He loved Dean, and he didn’t want to hurt him. “Dean, I would never do anything to hurt you on purpose. And you know that. Just, I am trying very hard with him. I am. You are my best friend, Dean. We’ve been through so much shit together. You know that I love you. I wouldn’t ever get in the way of something or someone that you want. Ever.” Ash hoped Dean wouldn’t think he was in love with him. Since Ash hadn’t said anything more than he loved Dean. They said that all the time. He just didn’t want to ruin things with Dean. He did need Dean in his life. Ash wouldn’t make it if he didn’t have Dean in his life. Just let this drop, babe. Please. I will do my best to be nice to Cas like I’ve been trying to. Let’s just leave it at that.” It was hard  for Ash to keep the anguish out of his voice. Very hard.
That was the opening, to ask about if Justine regretted leaving her daughter. Looking at Dean, the older boy gave him a huge grin and ate more pizza. Cas decided to ask. The least that could happen was Dean getting upset or refusing to talk. They could deal if they had to. “Dean. Do you ever think…. That Justine might come back and try to be in Belle’s life?” Cas knew it, if it had been him and his own child. It could turn out very badly. They almost never gave the fathers custody over the mother. Although she had left her own daughter.
“No, they’ll be more concerned about the fact that you’re Yankee and from Away.” Ash told him, shrugging a shoulder. He looked into those blue eyes. “I’m Ash. I’m bisexual, and let me tell you, if you don’t have a thick skin, you won’t be able to handle being here. And Dean is into guys, so if you don’t give up you might get somewhere.” Ash turned to look at John. “I gotta go pick up your kid from school, John. I’ll be back in a few.” John’s wife had died when Dean’s younger brother was a baby. Scuttlebutt in town was she’d been murdered by the man she’d been cheating on John with. Ash had never joined in, because it was cruel to the boys.
Hitting the vape hard before he answered, Ash wasn’t at all surprised that Jo was asking this. She was a curious kind of kid. “I’m fine, kid.” Ash said, knowing she’d hate that, too. Ash didn’t want to let Jo in on what he was dealing with. Ash didn’t think that he should involve Jo in stuff like this when she was only going on 14. Ash didn’t want to risk Ellen’s wrath. She was very protective of Jo. Ash wasn’t equipped to deal with Ellen’s anger. “Now stop asking, because I’m not going to tell you anything anyway. Your mama would kill me.” Ash knew that wouldn’t go over well.
Jodi stepped inside. She was alone. She had come to check on him and take his statement. She moved up to the bed. “Hey, kiddo.” She said, and leaned down to kiss his cheek, as he murmured through a mouthful of burger ‘hey, Mama.’ Jodi and John were practically married already. She gave him a small smile. “I know you don’t want to talk about it, sweetheart, but I have to ask you to tell me what happened.” Dean’s eyes brushed with tears, but he launched into the story for her. Jodi took the notes, and Dean had to pause a few times. But she got it all down. “Gatlin is so small. I have no doubt we’ll catch him. I promise, I won’t let this happen to either of you again.”
Rolling his eyes, Sam adjusted his bag. “Dean, I’m not trying to deprive anyone. I called him on my way to your place, and I couldn’t get a hold of him. Rufus told me Cas was meeting Gabi somewhere.” Sam brushed hair out of his eyes. Most of the family was getting used to Gabrielle. Although, Gabrielle had set her sights on Lydia Martin, and Sam felt sorry for her with that, she’d never have a chance with Lydia. Lydia had her own crush on someone. And it wasn’t Gabrielle. “You’ve got to stop being so protective. Cas can take care of himself. I know it’s hard for you, but if you try you can do it.” Sam just hoped that his words weren’t falling on deaf ears.
I usually play this, oh no
And I didn’t miss that it’s
Dean waved his hand. “Don’t worry about it, Sammy. Just let Dad know you’re here and do your homework.” Dean knew now that Sam was 14 he hated Dean still ‘bossing’ him around, nut Dean had always helped with the raising of Sam. John had worked long hours with Bobby to keep a roof over their heads. Dean kept his eyes on Sam until his brother had rolled his eyes and then moved off to do as asked. Dean looked at Ash. “What’s up with you? You’re hiding something. You think I can’t tell?” He asked, looking at his friend. Dean knew that Ash wasn’t a fan of Cas, even though he was good at hiding it. “You don’t like Cas, and you think you’re doing a good job of hiding it. And you aren’t. I know you. It’s nice that you’re trying not to be a dick to him, but you don’t like him. Why? What’s wrong with Cas that you can’t like him?” Dean really didn’t want it to be that Ash still had feelings for him. Dean knew that would be added drama that they didn’t need. Dean watched his friend as he stood there, looking as if he was trying to think of a lie. Dean said, “I know you’re trying to think of a lie. Just tell me the truth. We’ve known each other all our lives. You shouldn’t have to lie to me. Just be honest, man.”
So just call me if you want me
This was something that Cas hadn’t thought about. “I don’t know. It’s not like there’s much to do in Gatlin.” He said, finishing his own breakfast. But he didn’t move to get any more. He was full. Cas put his plate and Belle’s bowl in the dishwasher, and got himself another Coke. As he was moving to sit back at the table, the front door opened, and Callie called out, finding them easily in the kitchen. “Morning, Callie.” Cas said, and she moved to get her own plate of breakfast. She often came by in the morning, she rose later than John and Jodi, and so it was a habit for her to come over and eat with them. She knew Sam ate breakfast at school with Jo. She got a glass of juice, and Cas gave her a smile. “Good morning to you. You got plans for the day?”
Narrowing his gaze, Dean shook his head and pushed it back at Cas. “No. I know why you’re trying to give it to me. You keep it.” The change was at least 20 dollars and he should be taking it. But Dean was too proud for that. He cast his glance towards the kids, Belle was playing with Jo. Dean turned back to Cas. “I don’t need your charity to take care of my daughter. I have been taking care of her for two years. She’s mine and she goes without nothing.” Dean was trying to keep the cruel tone out of his voice. Dean wasn’t trying to be rude. He just didn’t want Cas’ money. “How old are you, anyway?” He finally asked.
Chapter Four: Angel Watching Over Me
This is when Sam, Dean’s younger brother, and his friend Jo Harvelle came running by, Ash was following them, vaping. It was pot, no one thought to check, even the small police force. Dean glanced at Ash. “If Dad sees you with that, you better tell him you waited till you got back. Ellen will kill you too.” Dean didn’t say too much about it, because he too, liked to smoke. Most of the population of Gatlin did. Dean just wasn’t sure he wanted Ash to do it with Sam and Jo in the car. He kept his gaze on the car as he spoke next. “You may be our Boo Radley, but Ellen and Dad will still tan your hide.” He closed up Castiel’s car, and wiped his hands.
You dance along
“I don’t know. My friend Cas’ sister showed up and it hasn’t been good for him. So far, this seems to be working out just as well.” Scott stood up from the table, picking up his helmet. “I’m leaving. I’ll call you when I decide I’m ready to talk to you.” He walked away, going to his bike. He unlocked it, and slid onto the bike. One day, he’d have a Harley. Scott knew it would require quitting the band. Dean didn’t want to leave Gatlin. If he did, he’d’ve left already. Scott revved the bike, and turned out of the parking lot. He was going to Stiles’, because Melissa was going to be working. Scott was glad that he wasn’t going home to his empty house. Not that anything bad happened in Gatlin.
“You know I don’t with the kids in the car, Dean. Hey, Scoot.” Ash said, tapping the younger boy on the arm. “Ya’ll are discussing band stuff?” He asked, his gaze falling on Sam and Jo, camped out in the seating area, making Cas uncomfortable. Ash was curious about him, and it wasn’t just because he was the first new person in months. Several months. It was because Cas was gay and from Away. Ash was sure that he knew that the town was going to care more about the Away and Yankee part. Ash turned his gaze back to his bandmates. “Because if this is about Lydia’s party, Scott stop trying to talk Dean into giving up his ideals.”
A couple of tears slid down Cas’ cheek. “You are amazing, Dean. I don’t know what I would do without you. You’re my first boyfriend. I can’t believe that you love me. That you want to be with me. I am nothing special. I’m nerdy, I am always reading.” He loved that Dean liked to read, too. Cas loved to talk about books. Cas ate the rest of his slice. Normally. He’d be afraid of the fact that Dean had a daughter. Cas knew that he might not be ready for that. Being a parent, even just a step parent. But he wasn’t at all scared. He wondered if Justine would ever come back. It didn’t seem very likely though.
Watching the exchange, and then Cas seeing the at least three years older than Dean man walk away gave Cas jealous feelings. He was insane! He had just met Dean. He had no claim on him. Cas couldn’t help but feel it deep in his gut though. Cas sighed as Dean moved out to go work on his car. He stood there, a lot nervously. Ash walked up to him. Cas looked at him. His ears were kind of ringing when Ash, as his nametag suggested, asked him if he was jonesing on Dean. After Cas adjusted to the old terminology, was kind of speechless. “Um…. how did you know that I’m… that I’m gay?” Cas asked, the words coming out slowly as he was stunned.
Holding his fiancé close, Cas knew exactly how Dean was feeling. “You can tell me anything that you’re feeling.” Cas told him, rubbing Dean’s back. He didn’t want to force him. He felt incredibly awful that this was bringing them closer together. They could both commiserate together about how things had felt. Cas just hated that Dean had to know from experience how it felt. He rubbed Dean’s back as Dean’s sobs slowed to sniffles. Cas wished that they knew who had done this. All they knew it was it was attached to Benny. Cas wished that he could say he was surprised, but he wasn’t. Every time things felt like they were going back to normal, something happened to change it.
Three hours later, they were eating lunch at a Steak and Shake in Raleigh. They’d already been to Costco. Raleigh was about an hour from Gatlin. They had a cooler they kept in the Impala for Costco runs. They hadn’t had anything spoil yet on the way home. Cas knew part of that was Dean was a speed demon. Belle was sitting next to Callie, pointing to what she wanted on the menu. Cas turned to Dean, they were sitting together. “How are you doing?” Cas asked him, whispering so their daughter couldn’t hear. He leaned forward and kissed Dean’s cheek, they were holding hands. His free hand brushed through Dean’s hair. It of course caused Dean’s eyes to slip shut. He mumbled something about being okay. Cas leaned closer and whispered again. “Dean, I know that you’re really not okay. You can tell me if you’re thinking about anything. You know that.” Cas stroked the back of Dean’s hand with his thumb. He looked into Dean’s green eyes. There was pain in those eyes. Cas reached up and cupped Dean’s jaw. He wasn’t trying to make Dean upset or anything, but Cas just wanted Dean to be honest with him. Cas nodded when his sister in law to be said she was taking Belle to the bathroom. Cas pressed his lips to Dean’s in a deep kiss, wanting him to relax a little. When he pulled back, Dean’s eyes were wet. Cas brushed tears off Dean’s cheek. “Dean, baby, talk to me.” Cas said, but he knew Dean might not.
Wincing at the question, Cas cleaned up the empty Coke cans. “He’s not really dealing. He slept last night, wrapped tightly around me like he’d never hold me again, but I know he’s forcing it to the back of his mind. He’s tried to initiate sex, but I know he’s only using it to try and cope with what he’s been through. I don’t want to make love that way.” Cas didn’t want to have sex as a distraction from the pain he was feeling. Cas got a rag and wiped off the table. “Belle, go get dressed! I put your clothes on your desk chair. We’re going out with Auntie Callie.” Belle squealed with glee and ran for her room. She could get everything on except shoes. “I’ll go get dressed. Be right back.” He told her, and she gave him a smile.
Nodding, Ash excused himself, told Dean they could talk more about the song later. Ash needed to not be around Dean right then. When he got outside the shop, he found Jo. “Hey, Joanna.” Ash said, feeling in his pockets for his vape. He desperately needed to get high. “What errands were you running? Why didn’t Sam go with you?” Ash needed to keep Jo from asking what was wrong. Ash didn’t really want to talk about it. Ash would possibly break down. And he didn’t want to do that, especially in front of Jo. He found his vape and pulled it out, turning it on. Ash always kept it full and ready to go.
This was hard for Sam to answer. Because he couldn’t lie to Jo. His dad sometimes, but not Jo. Sam took a bite of his ice cream, which wasn’t even remotely melty. They tried to be as good as Dairy Queen. Sam swallowed and finally spoke. “It’s different for me than it is Dean or Dad. I didn’t know her like they did. So I don’t really know what I’m missing. I just go and stare at a tombstone, and I miss the idea of her. It’s Dean and Dad I go for. You might not have heard. There was… lots of people were saying that my mom was cheating on my dad. No one knows if it’s true though.”
There was a ringing in Cas’ ears as Dean was speaking. He couldn’t believe this. Benny had told the world what he’d done to Cas. He took a deep shuddering breath. “I can’t believe he did that.” His voice shook as he spoke. Cas buried his head in Dean’s neck, and began to cry. He couldn’t do this. Everyone was going to know. Everyone was going to be gossiping about him. Cas felt Dean’s arms tighten around him, and Stiles left the kitchen. Cas could feel a panic attack coming on. This wasn’t fair. He tried to catch his breath. Dean started saying his name repeatedly, and Csa knew he was having a panic attack.
The gravity of that hit Dean s hard his eyes filled with tears. “Oh fuck.” He said, his phone lighting up with a text from John. With shaking fingers he replied, confirming he was up for the day, and that he’d indeed heard about Benny. Dean was mechanical as he flipped the pancakes. “Cas didn’t even tell me until yesterday. He was scared. He didn’t even…. He didn’t want anyone to know. This…. They’ll never stop with the gossip. And his sister just showed up. This… this isn’t good. What… what am I going to do to help him?!” Dean absolutely couldn’t believe this. Everyone in Gatlin would know before the day was over. It was an incredibly small town. He angrily ran his hand across his cheeks, wiping away his tears. “I’m out if my depth here. I… I know this is going to crush him and I don’t know how to help him deal.” Dean was going to panic if he didn’t calm down. He took deep breaths, and Stiles moved to rub his back, Dean gasping for air. This was the worst possible thing that could have happened to Cas. This is when Cas came wheeling into the kitchen, and saw how upset Dean was. He went to Cas and sat on his lap, telling him what had happened.
I don’t want to complicate this for you
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you
The question that Dean got wasn’t what he’d wanted, but it was an answer that he could live with. Dean kept his eyes on Cas, who was blushing. Dean leaned out and kissed him. “Okay.” He said. He just hoped that he was right in that Cas was the one for him. Belle would be crushed if she lost him this early in her life. Dean looked at Cas, who seemed somber. But since something huge had just happened, that was not a huge surprise. Dean was glad, though, that they had come to a decision. He was glad that at least maybe he and Cas were heading somewhere. He’d put the proposal off again. No need to stir anything up there.
“Hey, no. Don’t disparage yourself like that. You’re amazing. I can’t believe that you think you aren’t.” Dean honestly just didn’t get how Cas could feel that way. He leaned out and brushed hair out of Cas’ eyes, the left one was black. “You are the best thing to happen to me since I saw my daughter being born. I don’t know what’s going to happen with us, but I want the chance to see. I won’t let anyone hurt you or take you away. There’ll be gossip, but they still talk about me knocking up Belle’s mom. They never let things go.”
The fact that Dean had known what Dean had had to do was humiliating. “Dad, no. Don’t blame yourself. You were doing your best to keep a roof over our heads.” Dean felt bad enough about it on his own. Dean buried his head in Cas’ chest, and took a deep sniff. He fell quiet, other than his crying. He heard John say he was going to go get some coffee, and he’d be right back. Dean held onto Cas like a lift raft. He’d never thought that this would happen when he wasn’t in control. He couldn’t find his voice, he was just so terrified. He was just not able to get the man’s voice out of his mind. He kept hearing it echo in his ears.
Cas leaned out to hug him. “I’m sure he’s going to be fine, Scott.” Cas said, unsure of what else to say. This was just awful. Stiles had to pull through. Cas declined hitting the joint, he knew all Scott needed was for him to be there for him. When was life going to get any easier?
Sighing, Dean poured oil into the G6. “Scott, I know that you want to play that party. But you know how Lydia is. She’s always trying to flirt with me. And I know it’s not just for sex. Do you think I want Lydia Martin as my daughter’s stepmother?!” Dean asked, glancing at him as he got the last bottle of oil. “I know you hate when I say this, but you’re still a kid. Yeah, in some ways I am too, but mostly I’m not. I have a beautiful two year old daughter. Her needs have to come before my needs.” This was the same talk they had every time Lydia came up.
“If she meant to keep me, then you’d think you’d remember her being pregnant.” Catilyn could tell that that had occurred to Scott, too. “Look, I’m not trying to judge her. But I was given up. She didn’t raise me like she did you. I’m not sure if I want to know the reason why. My mom, she’s not the best, but she was still the one who raised me. She’d be so mad if she knew I was here.” Caitlyn had grown up in Texas. That was a long way from here. “Gatlin is a lot smaller than where I grew up in Texas.” That had been Corpus Christie. Her accent was a different one than Scott’s. “I just want to get to know you. You’re my brother.” Caitlyn wasn’t sure what Scott was going to say.
Dean kissed Cas deeply, Lydia Martin had read once that if you stopped someone from having a panic attack. But when Dean had pulled back, Cas was out cold. He’d fallen unconscious. “Stiles! Cas passed the fuck out!” Dean yelled, and Scott and Ash both complained loudly, the urgency of it not clear to them. Stiles came running back into the tiny cottage’s kitchen and dialed 911 on his phone. Dean should also be freaking out that with the exception of Ash, they were all under 21. But he was more concerned about Cas. He recovered mostly okay from his slight concussion, but you really could never know. Dean was hella fucking scared.
My time, my attention, my patience
In the waiting room, Dean, Cas, Lydia, and Jo were joined by a girl. She looked about 15, and she looked very similar to Scott. Her long black hair falling down her back. She was on the shorter side. She looked at Dean first. “I was told I could find Scott McCall here?” Caitlyn Cade was Scott’s bio sister. They shared both parents. Caitlyn did know she was about to ruin her brother’s life by coming here. The reason she’d not been raised with Scott was due to a contract her father had made their mother Melissa sign. He didn’t have many scruples. She held up her birth certificate. “I’m Caitlyn McCall. Although I use my adopted name, Cade.” She could tell it was a huge new bunch of information. “My… my adoptive mother doesn’t know that I’m here. She would kill me if I told her.” She was sorry to have to do this behind her back. But she had to. She had to know her brother. “I just, I want to know my family.” Caitlyn wasn’t sure what would happen. She’d had to flash some boob to get anyone in this town to tell her where Scott even was. She’d had a long six month road to this point. Caitlyn had to know why Scott had been kept and she hadn’t. It wasn’t at all fair, and why would it have needed to be done? They’d already had Scott!
The story of what had happened to Scott was truly awful. Caitlyn didn’t know how to absorb it. She pulled on the ends of her long black hair. Which was braided today. “Scott, I’m so sorry that you had to go through that. I can’t even imagine. And now your boyfriend has to recover. I don’t know how to help you deal with any of that. And I didn’t say I didn’t want to get to know Melissa.” Caitlyn could see her chance to know her brother going away. She didn’t want that. She knew about him now, she wanted him in her life. “Look. I want us to get to know each other. I’ll do what I’ve got to do for that to happen.” She meant it, no matter how hard it would be.
Taking this in, Cas only took one hit before passing it on to Scott. They were eating pizza rolls and playing Spit with some Avengers playing cards. Cas looked at Dean. He took a couple of bites of his ice cream as he looked at him. “I’m not jealous by any means. I know how you feel for me. I just, I don’t think we should keep secrets. I’m not angry I’m not angry or upset with Ash. You had a past before I came along. I can’t fault you for that.” He kissed him softly. Then it deepened, and Cas pulled away to breathe. “I love you, and that includes your past.” Cas had his own demons. Ones he was worried to disclose. He worried Dean would leave him.
Callie had pulled her hair back in two braids. She forked up some eggs. She had taken a day or two off work. The library could do without her for a day or two. Callie looked at her brother. “I don’t have any plans. But I do need to talk to you about something.” They both looked at her with eyebrows raised. She sipped her apple juice. “Sam and Jo are doing a lot of sleeping around. Which usually, it’s just, you know, teen stuff. But I think I saw a pregnancy test in the trash.” She said, as she forked up a bite of eggs. “I hid the test from Dad. It was negative, but what if it’s not an accidental thing? What if they’re trying?”
Ash puffed on his vape pen again. “No, I’m not with Garth, God, Dean. You didn’t hear that he left town? They were closing in on his online… activities.” Ash wasn’t going to elaborate because one, it wasn’t his place to tell Dean what Garth had been up to. “So, he headed off somewhere about a week ago. You… I can’t believe that you didn’t hear about it.” It was all they could talk about at the Tastee Queen, Gatlin’s answer to Dairy Queen. It was too small for most franchises. He met Dean’s eye. “I can’t apologize enough for the whole Benny thing.” Ash didn’t add that he’d slept with Benny a lot and he talked about Dean. Dean and Benny weren’t a good match. “I just don’t think that we should bang.”
Stiles was getting out of the hospital. He wouldn’t be mobile for at least three more weeks. Stiles was having issues with remembering certain things. He remembered being in love with Scott, but not the them having started dating. Scott seemed upset about this, but since Stiles still wanted to be with him, he was trying to hide it. Stiles wondered if he should tell Scott he didn’t have to hide anything from him. They’d always been best friends. Stiles was in his clothes, the ones that his dad had brought, waiting for Scott or his dad to come back. Scott poked his head into the room, and Stiles grinned at seeing him. “Scott, bae.” He said, and Scott crossed the room. Once he’d gotten up to Stiles, he grabbed Scott’s shirt and pulled him down to kiss him. “I missed you.” Stiles told him. He had to have his legs held out in front of him, and he wasn’t happy about it. He didn’t remember the accident at all. Stiles did want his memories to come back, but not those. He’d been filled in on everything, especially the big things. And Stiles found he liked Cas a lot. Stiles wasn’t sure what to think of Garth being back in town. “Can we go yet? I’m sick of these walls.”
Meanwhile, Sam and Jo were making out on the couch. John was gone, out with Jody, and Callie was working. Sam’s arms were wrapped around Jo’s waist, and hers were around his neck. Sam was trying to keep his hands from moving up under Jo’s shirt. Sam didn’t want to push things too far. He was surprised when Jo’s hands moved down and went underneath his shirt, stroking his abs. Which weren’t as defined as his big brother’s, but they were tight. She let her fingers move over them, and so Sam let his hands up under Jo’s shirt, stroking her flat stomach. He didn’t let them climb higher.
“No, but Bobby does.” Scott said. “He got Benny to leave, using his shotgun.” Scott may have grown up here, but he was still scared of guns. His eye fell on Castiel then, who was watching them talk. Scott hadn’t spoken to him really, other than a hi here or there. Scott didn’t know what to think. And Dean was totally and completely head over heels for Cas. They’d not even really hung out even. Scott’s eyes moved back to Sam. “It was Benny, Sam, and no one knows why. He just came out of nowhere and started whaling on Dean.” Sam still couldn’t wrap his mind around the fact that Benny had done that.
When Scott didn’t greet her, Caitlyn hoped that it was just because he was nervous or something. Caitlyn didn’t want anything to eat, so she just joined him. “Hi, Scott. I’m Caitlyn.” She held out her hand, and they shook on it. She wasn’t sure what to say. “I was nervous about meeting you. I know we share both parents. It’s not that I don’t want to meet Melissa too. But I was given up for adoption. And I don’t know the details. I couldn’t bear it if she did it because she didn’t want me. I don’t even have the name McCall. I’m Caitlyn Cade.” She hoped she hadn’t offended him, she was his mom.
Scott didn’t know how to say this. It’s not something that he was used to. “Um, Dean got into a fight. He’s pretty beaten up.” Dean had used to get into fights, but not since Belle was born. “No one’s calling the cops… and Dean refuses to go to the hospital.” Scott hated to be the one to tell Sam. But he’d been there. Benny, Dean’s once hookup date, had come by. For some reason he’d been very angry at Dean and had just started hitting. Scott had tried to stop him. Dean had gotten in a couple of good hits, but Benny had taken him by surprise. “He’s pretty bad, Sam. I think that he needs stitches. You have to come.” Sam had skills with cleaning up wounds from hunting animals.
Watching him, Gabrielle gave him a smile. “I’m not here to threaten you. Cassie obviously loves you, he chose to stay with you here. I’m here because he sent me and our brother Michael an email letting us know where he was living and why. He asked us not to tell our parents but they already know and don’t care. But I don’t care about them, so I wasn’t going to fill them in. I just want my brother back. I don’t know if I’m straight either.” Michael had no plans to have either of them in his life. “We need each other, our brother will not be including us in his life. But he’s a total douche anyway so it’s no big loss. You’ll dislike him too.”
That was a loaded question. Scott looked up from the book. “I don’t know, Lyds. I just want him to wake up.” Tears brushed his brown eyes. He knew that Stiles would be having to deal with getting back to healthy for awhile. He stroked Stiles’ bruised face, and as he did, Stiles’ eyes fluttered open. Scott gasped and reached up to brush a hand in Stiles’ hair. “ Bae, I’m so glad that you’re awake.” They had warned Scott that he may not have all of his memories or be a little foggy because he’d had a concussion. Scott leaned to kiss him, overjoyed when Stiles kissed back.
Callie nodded. “Yeah. Actually, we could use some stuff too. I could stop by Dad’s work and get some cash.” She eyed her brother as he cleaned up the table, and put away leftovers, now that Callie had her own food. Dean leaned to kiss Cas and headed up to shower. Callie watched him go, and then turned to Cas. “So, how’s he really doing?” She hadn’t personally been through what they had, but Cas had filled her in on what Dean had gone through growing up. Callie was horrified that Dean had felt like he’d had to resort to that in order to keep food on the table. Callie couldn’t imagine what horrific things he’d had to do in order to do that. “I can’t even imagine going through it.” She said.
Cas woke from his nap to his boyfriend hugging him tightly and kissing him. “Dean, not that I’m complaining, but what’s this for?” He asked, and he froze as Dean told him Benny was loose. Cas shivered and buried his head in Dean’s neck. “I can’t….” Cas hadn’t told Dean everything that Benny had done to him. But he hadn’t told the cops, either. Cas had been afraid that no one would believe him. “Dean…. He didn’t just beat me up.” He said, and now Dean froze. “He…. after he’d beaten me, he raped me.” Cas was glad that it hadn’t been his first time. “He said it was the only way I’d get you.”
“Dude, that’s awesome.” Dean said, and looked at Scott once more before turning back to Stiles. “I think you’ll be just fine after you mend up.” He told him. Dean knew that Stiles was more worried about that than he was at catching who hit him. Dean had been hearing a lot lately about who they felt had done it. The talk was Crowley. Because Stiles was gay. He was already hated because of the way he tended to treat people, and now he was suspected of this. Dean could tell by the fear behind Crowley’s taunts and replies to slights and accusations that he didn’t do it. Dean wasn’t sure that he should tell Stiles any of that. The group had decided maybe it wouldn’t help.
I’m giving it all
Chuckling, Dean said, “Okay. Slow down. It doesn’t matter if you top or bottom. Only in that if you bottom, it will hurt. Especially if you haven’t practiced by pegging yourself.” Dean had done that on occasion. “You and Scott need to talk about it. Most guys are one or the other, but there’s nothing that says you can’t do both. But Stiles, you and Scott love each other. You do. The sex is going to be good because of that. Don’t worry so much. Read some erotica, if you don’t really know what to expect. I know this is your first time.”
This didn’t sound right to Dean. It was true that Ash wouldn’t have hurt him on purpose, but there was something that didn’t feel right about what Ash had said. Dean kept his green eyes on Ash’s blue ones, and wondered what he should do. What he should say. Dean could tell that Ash was actually nervous. Really nervous. This was telling to Dean. Ash really needed him to drop this subject. Dean wasn’t sure what to do. Dean loved Ash too, they had been through a lot together. He ran his hand through his hair. “Ash, I love you too. But you’ve got to get used to me and Cas. Because I plan to be with him forever.” Dean knew that Ash was hiding feelings for him. It explained Ash’s sleeping with Benny before Benny had gone off the deep end, and the sleeping with Garth. And Dean was sure there were others that he just didn’t know about. Dean looked at Ash, who looked as if he was actually trying not to cry. This was new. Ash was usually the Grandmaster at hiding what he was feeling. He knew then that Ash was still in love with him. Dean wasn’t going to bring it up. He didn’t want to hurt Ash or their friendship. Ash had said he would adjust his attitude. That’s all Dean could ask of him.
This was just a bit unsettling. Cas had to think hard about that. If he should do something about being too gay. It could be dangerous. He brushed his hand over his black hair. He found himself asking, “Do I… do I need to worry about that? Are there…” He didn’t want to use the redneck word. It might offend Ash. “People who will object? I kind of have to stick around for a bit.” Mostly because he didn’t have a real plan and he wanted to have at least a small semblance of a plan. Cas did have a room at the town’s only hotel reserved. This definitely wasn’t a tourist trap.
Cas brushed tears off of Dean’s face. Callie and Belle came back, and Callie distracted Belle by coloring with the crayons they’d provided. Dean was still sniffling a bit. Cas leaned out and brushed his lips against Dean’s. “You know that Dad doesn’t blame you for what you had to do. He blames himself, even if I think he shouldn’t do that, either.” They had to stop to order, and Cas was surprised by the huge order of chili fries Dean got with his bacon cheeseburger. He supposed that he shouldn’t be, when Dean was hurting, he liked to junk food it up a little. Cas had had to make sure they had pie stocked for the last couple of weeks. Cas knew they’d be getting into one of them when they got home. Cas himself got a burger and fries with a strawberry shake.
And your song comes on
Dean was sitting at his kitchen table, and his baby brother was stitching up his face. He knew why Benny had done this. Dean had told him that he wasn’t interested in dating him. Benny had seemed to take it okay, but after he’d sat on it for a spell, apparently it had bothered him. Dean winced as Sam stitched. Dean knew that John was going to hear about this, and that was bothering him. Although he knew that it wasn’t his fault. Jo and Scott had taken Belle with them to get pizza. Dean’s face was covered in cuts and bruises, and he was fairly certain his ribs were broken. At least one of them. Sam had also taped them up. Dean finally broke the silence. “I know why Benny did this.” He said. Sam met his eye. “When we went out, and hooked up… he wanted more and I didn’t. He seemed to take it okay at the time. Maybe he got angry. I just… I just don’t want this around Belle. I’m trying to be the best dad that I can. And…. this isn’t doing it.” Dean’s voice shook as he spoke. He didn’t know what he was going to do. He’d insisted on not pressing charges, even with Bobby telling him he was an idiot for doing so. He had been trying to keep it out of the papers. Belle hadn’t been at the shop, and he was so glad. “I know that this wasn’t my fault. But I still… I feel like somehow I did something wrong.”
“He’s out of town, Callie! And if you keep your mouth shut, he won’t know!” Sam still wasn’t sure if he liked his sister. He was trying. Sam just thought their personalities didn’t go together. She seemed to be more like Dean. Sam pulled out his meal, Callie had marked the bags. Sam thought maybe he wasn’t okay with Callie because John let her help keep an eye on him. When Sam was almost 15, he didn’t  think that he needed it. It was true that she wasn’t as strict as Dean used to be. “Just be cool, Callie. Dad’ll flip.” Sam also knew Ellen would, and that woman knew how to use a shotgun. A shotgun.
There was a ringing in Cas’ ears as he ran down the hospital hall to his fiancé's room. When he got to the room, Dean was laying in bed, and Cas rran up to him, pressing kisses all over Dean’s face. “Oh, baby, I’m so so sorry.” Cas murmured, as he leaned back so he could look at him. He brushed his fingers through Dean’s dark brown hair. Dean’s wet eyes fell shut. Cas hated that Dean knew what it felt like to be raped. He’d never wanted that for him. Even if it might bring them closer together. He brushed tears off Dean’s face. He cradled Dean’s chin with his hand, and Dean’s eyes opened to meet his. “Are you okay?”
Looking into his fiancé's eyes, Dean just wasn’t sure if he could talk about what was happening with him. He bit his lip. He didn’t know how to start with what he was feeling. Dean wasn’t really sleeping much, and Cas knew that. He was so tired. And everytime he closed his eyes, he could see his father telling him that he knew that Dean had had to sell his body to survive. Dean had never wanted to have his dad know what he had to do. Dean bit his lip again, and then he said, “I’m not okay. I’m trying to be.” His voice was quiet. He was trying to keep a lump from forming in his throat. “I can’t stop thinking about Dad knowing about what I had to do.” He turned red with embarrassment.
Honey, you don’t have to play no games
“You’re an amazing singer, Dean.” Cas said, right before Dean was kissing him deeply and breathlessly. Cas was quite taken aback, but he didn’t stop him. He enjoyed kissing Dean. When they broke to breathe, Dean said they needed more snacks, so he and Stiles went to the kitchen to get ice cream and more pizza rolls. Cas looked at Ash. Cas felt a rush of affection for the older man. “Ash, I want you to know, I don’t hold you responsible for what Benny did to me. I know that even you couldn’t have known that this was coming. I’m sorry that Dean got so angry at you on my behalf.”
Dean was setting up the next game, and Scott and Stiles were kissing pretty heavily on the floor by the coffee table. Dean caught sight of what Ash was doing. “You’re the best, man.” He said, and they high fived. “Hey, no making out.” He said, mostly in a mocking tone as he tossed empty soda cans at them. It wasn’t very hard, but they tossed them back. Dean wasn’t able to keep the huge grin off his face. After all the drama they’d had lately it was good for them to cut loose. That’s when music from the band’s album started to play. Dean grinned. “Dudes, that was such a good idea! Cas loves our stuff!” He said, unable to keep from dancing along to a cover of Uptown Funk. This caused his boyfriend to watch eagerly as he took hits of the vape. As Dean was dancing along, he sang along. Cas hadn’t gotten to really hear him sing just yet. Dean only wished he could go grab his guitar, but he was too wasted. He’d possibly mess up when tuning. He smoked when the vape was passed to him, and noticed that Scott had gotten up to dance and sing for Stiles too, so they moved to combine the performance. They were technically a rock band, so they’d given it a classic rock feel. Dean actually liked the original song though. He ended up in Cas’ lap, both of them breathless.
No one knew what to do at first. Then Dean decided to take charge. “You need to leave. You weren’t invited.” He said, hoping his tone was forceful enough. He knew that Scott wouldn’t want her here. Dean knew that she was going to try and give him a hard time, too. “I mean it. Get out.” Dean sad, he knew Charlie was the one who should be doing this, since it was her place, but he also knew that she wasn’t one to deal with conflict. Dean folded his arms tightly. His green eyes met Caitlyn’s brown ones, and he could see fear in hers. Dean should reassure her, that no one was going to hurt her, but he didn’t.
Shrugging, Dean set down the pizzas he was carrying. “It was okay. I wrote some song lyrics, we were pretty slow.” He kissed Cas again. “Let me go get the plates, drinks, and your pain meds. You want anything else?” He asked, and Cas shook his head no. “You get chocolate milk, Belle, you were good for Uncle Ash.” She grinned at him, and he went to the tiny kitchen. He moved to get things, and his phone rang. Dean moved to answer as he got Cas’ pills. “Dean.” He said into the phone.
Cas pulled his car into Singer-Winchester Auto. It was in a small town, called Gatlin, in one of the Carolinas. He’d come all the way from New York, Albany. His parents didn’t accept him being gay. Cas had come out, and they’d kicked him out. He’d grabbed what he could, and got so far before his oil needed changed. He was grabbing his phone and moving to go inside when he caught the glimpse of this gorgeous boy, maybe a bit older than Cas, climbing out of a very old car, and he was holding a beautiful toddler. She had curly black hair, and bright green eyes. She was calling the boy “Daddy.” Cas’ mouth fell open at the thought. The boy had green eyes and dark brown hair. A somewhat three o’clock shadow. He was so hot.
