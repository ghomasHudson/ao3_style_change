“Hey guys.” I greeted our friends who where waiting in the hallway in front of our lockers and smiled nervously.
Again sorry it took so long, but I am happy I finished this chapter now! I post it as a christmas gift!
"I don't want to give us up and I don't want to give our other parts up Wade and I have the feeling that Papa would want that and I'm not sure Dad can do anything about it" Peter said honestly.
The room was silent at first and I thought I said something wrong, but when I peeked under my arm, I saw all of them smiling manically at me.
We did already made ourselves ready for bed but then I heard that Sherlock Holmes is displayed on the TV and I love the movie and convinced Mrs. Rogers to let Steve and I watch it.
I don’t have school problems and no idea of football actually, I never had a girlfriend and I prefer reading books than watching movies. All in all I really wouldn’t fit in there.
Mr. Harrison snorted angrily but Tony had already turned around and searched for an empty chair, which happened to be next to me.
"Uhm, well yes. After your little whatever in your room yesterday it was pretty obvious" Tony said, wondering why Peter would behave this carefully around him on this topic. He knew that Tony and Steve had nothing against Peter being gay. Obviously Tony and Steve where gay too, so why would Peter be afraid of him now.
"If I may ask, Sir, why do you even choose to buy a Mango. There are a lot of other healthy fruits on the market, that should be sufficient for young Sir's needs."
Tony flooded the Skaterpark with the light of his car as Peter showed Wade his new hoverboard and Wade made it to his mission to try and throw Peter off of it.
"Everything is going to be alright, Peter" Wade whispered and grabbed Peters hand, squeezing it to show his support.
Bucky just smiled sadly. “He does love you Steve and he may will be angry with you, but if you truly, really love him, than you will do anything for him and not give him up as fast as you did, Steve.”
"Why I just love looking at beautiful people" Wade answered cheekily and made a kissing face towards Peter.
“If you need money, you could have just asked me, I have enough! Does the hospital need some charities?” I asked and looked back at Mrs. Rogers.
"Oh my god. Did your AI just said that?" Someone laughed behind Tony, making him whirl around grabbing his chest.
Natasha was sitting crosslegged on the sofa, leaning on Clints shoulder and playing with two small pocket knives she had brought with her. Pepper capped and uncapped her Pepperspray in an annoying rhythm to calm her nerves and Jane was putting a new film in her camera, because she wasn't able to do it, before she came here.
Besides that, I caught myself thinking about him far too often. His nice smell and those warm brown eyes that sparkled with excitement every time he talked about something he loved!
“I thought we could make some Pizza together, don’t you think? I bought everything and even got a recipe that didn’t sounded too difficult and J promised he would help so… we should give it a try, he?”
They ate their Pizza and watched some Star Trek to make fun about the crappy tech they used, before they spent some time in the workshop, where Dad tried to make some repairs on the Iron Man armor, Peter tried to do some updates on his Game Consol but more often than not played with DUM-E fetch the ball.
Still, Black Widow and Thor were to later, when they finally arrived at the scene, Iron Man had already blew up the whole dimension portal that sent the Doombots on their way.
Wade looked over to him, smiling encouragingly. Despite his crazy and sometimes weird nature, he knew exactly when he had to be serious and supporting. Peter smiled at Wade thankfully.
Five minutes later Fury and Hill rushed into the room, in their hands they held some documents, they distributed under the Avengers.
Dad frowned at him but followed him up to give him his usual good night kiss after Peter made himself ready for bed.
"Hey I think Mr. Forge smiled. Do you think he smiled? I think I finally made him smile" Wade grinned smugly.
But he obviously was. He was stiff, fidgeting with his fingers, biting his lips nervously and scanning the room, as if he needed to escape it in any moment.
"Oh I think you would do it on purpose just to look if your hoverboard could actually withstand a wall", Steve rolled his eyes.
Slowly but surely he melted in Wades arms completely forgetting the time, just enjoying the warmth of the kiss and the sweetness of Wades lips on his. Wades hand slowly sneaked under Peters pajama shirt, exploring the skin beneath, feeling the muscles of Peters body. He riled Peters shirt up, pulling it over Peters head and throwing it on the floor while forcing Peter to walk backwards until his back hit the sink, never once breaking apart.
Peter laughed as his father put a cooking hat on his head and then they started to try their best on the Pizza.
”Morning Tony. Did you sleep well?” Mrs. Rogers asked as she sat a plate full of pancakes in front of me. My stomach growled loudly as I sat down at the kitchen table with a big yawn.
"Your father is right" Wade said. "There can't be secrets in your family and you know that Peter, the worst part is, when Steve finds out that Tony knows, then he will blame Tony, not you."
“Okay, Tony, you are still going to stay with us, before we made an agreement. For now, you are just not going back, until your wounds are healed and even when they are healed, you can always still stay with us! But for now, I made some hot cocoa, come”, She dragged me out of the room and into the living room.
Peter was nervous, twirling his fingers with each other and his eyes moving around restlessly. He leaned against his boyfriend, seeking his warmth, before he answered: “They are going to discuss about Spiderman and Deadpool today, Wade.”
“Okay. Who are you and what did you do to the other guys?”, he asked and looked at every single one of us.
She turned towards her son, hugging him strongly for a short moment. There was pain and worry in her eyes, when she looked at his flushed face, from being hugged by his mother in front of his friends.
"I thought I could tell Dad about our secret, you know the other one, but... when he wants us to tell Papa, then I am not sure I want to tell him anymore" Peter thought out loud.
“Tony, sometimes I don’t think you realize how important it is for children that they have their distance between the problems of their parents, okay? It’s getting on their psyche.” Steve explained hardly.
Tony whispered something to Rhodey and Pepper gave him a hug before they came back to us with smiles plastered on their faces that couldn’t quiet mask all of the concern they were trying to hide.
“It should!” He screamed and before I even could start my escape he had already grabbed me and punched me in the face.
For the rest of the evening we played card games, ate cookies and drank one hot chocolate after another. We laughed and mocked around and when this is what family actually is like… well, I totally ignored the longing in my chest, that wanted to have this every day. For now, I was happy and content and maybe, just maybe Steve really liked me! Maybe, we could even be more than fri
Dad looked concentrated, his tongue sticking out in the corner of his mouth as he threw up the pancake out of the pan with one quick movement.
He grabbed his tray with his not even half finished food on it, walked to the bin and threw it away before angrily stomping out of the cafeteria.
“Exactly Mr. Rogers, but why? Either they have some deep secrets they don’t want you to know or they are afraid you would stop them, but why would they think something like that, unless there is something that they don’t want us to know. So, now the question is, what could that be.” Fury answered, crossing his arms in front if him.
I laid there for a while, trying to calm down, resting before it would start again, when my gaze fell back to the window.
Wade was a good boyfriend. Although he talks shit nonstop he does know when to just be silent and comfort Peter.
Mrs. Rogers had tears in her eyes and grabbed me again to push me against her. She slung her arms around my neck and hugged me.
The whipped cream on top of it got stuck on my nose and I nearly choked myself on one of the marshmallows but it was the best drink I ever had and after I put it back on the table I smiled at Steve, who laughed at me and then smiled back.
Tony fluff will be in the next chapter. This chapter is in Tony's POV, so Steve will be mentioned but not actually be in this chapter, but in the next one there will be Stony and love and fluff and cookies and kisses and everything will go better somehow.
"Tony, are you okay? It was just a nightmare, just a nightmare. Everything is fine. Gosh, you bit your lip, you are bleeding." Steve whispered nervously and out of breath.
It wasn’t long before we arrived in school. The whole way Steve and I just walked in silence next to each other, but it wasn’t awkward, just really relaxing.
After leaving his workshop Tony jogged up the stairs taking a beeline to his sons room and then, remembering what he heard the last time standing in front of Peters room, he stopped and listened. Soft snoring sounds could be heard. Tony let out a breath he didn‘t knew he held and carefully pushed the door open. The first thing he saw where clothes thrown everywhere, making him shudder and then his eyes fell on the bed, where both Wade and Peter slept peacefully in each others arms. Wade, the one who emitted the soft snores had his arms wound around Peters body, pulling him to his chest. Peter looked peaceful and happy. Tonys chest warmed at the loving display of those two and he carefully closed the door behind him, choosing to let them rest, although he promised Mrs. Wilson to send Wade home come evening.
Peter laughed putting himself in the same position as his boyfriends and asking: “And what would that be?”
He had this kind of bed head everyday, as if he just woke up, his brown hair sticking up in every direction, making him look adorable.
Tony was like fire, his brown eyes were sharp. There was an intelligence behind them, that no one but him could grasp, but they were also warm. When he was excited, there was a spark in them, making them look golden.
And when you are not german you can write me anyways because I love talking to people and I am lonely. :)
For a moment Tony could do nothing but sink into Steves warm hug, not thinking about what just happened, what he is forced to do now in order to save Steve and his mother, what his father would do to him... A chill ran down Tonys body and he pushed his body more strongly into Steves hug, as if he would try to melt into Steve, becoming one with him and never letting go.
Steve sobbed. He sobbed and cried and cried and cried until his voice was hoarse and he hadn't enough tears left in him. Only then, his mother let him go and talked to him.
“No need to thank me, sweety.” She smiled back at me and then turned around to the kitchen counter to prepare Steve’s breakfast. Shortly after that Steve came into the kitchen, already ready for the day and greeted us all with a happy “good morning”.
His Dad didn't answer either, what worried him, because his Dad always answered accept he worked in the shop.
Natasha has stopped playing with her knives and Pepper froze in the middle of uncapping her Pepperspray again.
“Hello friends!”, boomed Thor and together with Jane, followed by Rhodey, Pepper, Bruce and Natasha he sat down at the table.
Peter looked into Wades eyes with a determined expression on his face and Wade couldn't even react, when Peter said: "I love you Wade and whatever Steve has to say about that, I don't want and I never will give you up. I love you and I mean it."
I didn't know for how long we sat there just comforting each other. Mostly me but Steve and Mrs. Rogers were nervous from the sudden adrenalin rush too and had to calm themselves down.
“Hey scarface! How come you can still show your ugly face?” Ajax came marching up to their table, followed by his super-stupid goons, Norman and Angel.
Tony scowled. "Hey. I tell you, I can be really strict too, so don't feel to comfortable around here." Tony warned Wade pointing with the Mango smeared knife at him. Wade still laughed.
„Good morning, you two“, Tony greeted Peter and Wade when they stumbled into the kitchen the next morning.
“You little shit! You destroyed everything! You are worthless and pathetic! No one loves you, know one likes you! You are nothing but a punching bag for me!” He screamed while he kicked me, then he hauled me up, took the hood of my sweater and ripped it over my head.
Peter expected Steve to go crazy, to be outraged by this possibility, to... he didn't know, just react, but he didn't. He stayed silent. The only thing that hinted to his Papa being upset was his tightening on the steering wheel.
They are all meeting at Rhodey’s this evening, but I didn’t wanted to come, even though they asked me.
“Don’t talk to me like I am a frightened puppy! I am not weak!” I hissed at him, instead of giving in to my urge to kiss him.
Peters heart beat fast in his chest. His palms where sweaty and his lungs felt like they were trying to squeeze every breath out of his body.
It was times like this, Steve couldn't be more grateful to have such wonderful friends. No one asked why Steve suddenly demanded them to all be there in less than twenty minutes. They just trusted Steve that he had his reason and came in even less time than he had asked them too.
MUHAHAHA Cliffhanger! I am sorry but if I wouldn't have ended it here, it would have certainly took another week before I could have posted it and I really didn't wanted that to happen.
"Dad", I gasped. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... Please, no. Gosh, please don't let it be him, don't let it be him!
A comfortable silence fell over us, while I tried to not concentrate on how good Tony smelled too much.
Everyone was stunned for a moment, before Natasha finally got up, putting her knives in her belt saying: "Okay, who wants to let Tonys Dad pay for what he did to him?"
Two hours later Peter woke up again. It was 3 am now and he would have loved to go back to sleep but then he heard clinging noises downstairs and sure that it must be his Dad he stood up and made his way downstairs to seek out his father.
“Okay”, Peter laughed and made his way over to the big kitchen table, sitting down and watching his father move around, trying to do the breakfast right.
“Dad, I’m sorry!” I tried and put my hands in front of me in a weak attempt to protect me from my father.
Steve leaned down and kissed me softly on the lips. I practically felt how the tension melted form my body, when a soft squirmy feeling started to erupt in my belly. I kissed Steve back, loving the warmth that spread through my body. Loving Steve... I tensed... where had that come from?! I shoved that thought as far away from my mind as I could, the words from my father ringing through my head loud and clearly:
They sat in Peter’s room, after they walked home from school and found Peter’s Dad in the workshop, they knew something bad happened in the morning at Shield HQ, but as his Dad said, that everything was fine with the matter of Spiderman and Deadpool, they concluded that something happened with Steve, again.
Smiling brightly I sat down at the kitchen table and waited till my mom set a plate of tacos down in front of me that I happily devoured in record time.
"No." Steve took a step backwards and pulled Tony near him. "You can't be serious! That... We can't let that happen. Tony" Steve turned around. "Tony I won't let that happen. I won't let you go!"
“Yeah, you are right. I just… It feels so wrong to lie to my Dad. I mean I lied to Papa more often than not because he always forbids me all the cool stuff”, Peter laughed, “But I actually never really lied to Dad. Maybe when I tell him, he could convince the others. I mean he can’t be convinced by other people that we are bad, because he knows us and I am his son, so… what do you think?”
It was six pm now. After they got home, Peter stormed into his room, locking himself away, being angry at Steve and at his Dad for putting up with Steve’s shit all the time and yes it is Steve now and not Papa because he is so fucking angry!
When we arrived at school Pepper, Rhodey, Sam, Bucky, Natasha, Clint and Bruce came running to me, greeting me happily and asking if I was okay.
I was stunned, but couldn’t stop the small trace of guilt that was creeping up in the back of my mind because I had to admit, she was right.
With that said she turned away and signaled that that was all she was going to say about Tony, what I really appreciated since it was quiet exhausting, so I dropped the topic as well.
I should have know that everything would start to fall apart at some point, but... I hoped. That’s the problem. I started hoping and a Stark men should never hope. Especially not me.
"We actually have to do homework", Steve said with a boring tone in his voice that showed just how much he would love to do them.
Sometimes he would talk to Bruce or Jane, because they were all science nerds and in this case the only ones who could actually understand him a little bit when he started rambling about equations and all this stuff.
I hugged her back, for a moment I was just grateful that I could bury my head in her shoulders that no one could see my face. “Tones.” I heard Rhodeys soft voice and fina,my locked up again. Rhodey clapped softly on my shoulder, holding his hand there a little bit longer to give his brotherly comfort and smiled sadly at me. I swallowed thickly. This were too much emotions to be comfortable for me. But before I could bold anywhere Thor’s loud voice boomed through the whole hallway: “Anthony, my friend! Your presence was greatly missed!” He smiled brightly and when Pepper let go of me hit me on my back, that I nearly fell over. “Thanks bug guy.” I smiled. Then came Natasha, Clint, Bruce and the rest of the group and greeted me warmly. Before I came here I was afraid of their reactions. Surely what happened must have done its rounds, at least through the group. I awaited pity and disgust maybe and not sure that I could have handled it I had already planned out my escape route. But now I didn’t quiet know what to make of this. I knew Pepper, she always greeted me like this. But the others... either they really didn’t know it, or they where just nice enough to not mention it in front of me. I didn’t know... I really didn’t care too. I was just happy that I wouldn’t have to deal with their pity.
Peter didn't say anything, but nodded. His chest squeezing tightly at his fathers words. Then he closed the door and went over to Wade, who waited at the entrance of the school.
“Hey Cap”, Clint greeted me enthusiastically. They started to call me Cap since I became the captain of our football team.
Peter crunched angrily with his teeth. Why did his Dad always put up with the shit Papa tells him? He always takes the blame on himself and Papa always throws the blame on Dad! Why? This is soo unfair!
Guilt pooled in my gut but what’s said is said and maybe he sees what an asshole I am and ignores me again like he did before.
What, to be honest, I was grateful for because I was pretty sure I looked like a total creep staring at him, what I also noticed I was doing really often today.
When I opened the bathroom door and stepped out, I heard Rhodey and his mom yelling, but it wasn’t the “argue” yelling, it was the kind of “I am afraid and don’t know what to do” sort of yelling.
His eyes were still locked on the door. It was closed now. Mrs. Rogers made sure to lock it securely.
Steve turned around, said goodbye to Peter, who ignored him and with a hurt feeling went slowly back to his car.
And when you are not german you can write me anyways because I love talking to people and I am lonely. :)
“Hit her head a little bit too hard, did she?” Peter mumbled as he just saw how Wade shoved Ajax face into the bin. When he finally managed to push Ajax completely into the trash, he kicked it hardly, making it roll around the cafeteria directly in front of Mrs. Finch, the director of the school.
“I asked him for his opinion and said, that Spiderman and Deadpool seem like nice guys and they didn’t actually do something bad, they probably just want to help and that I think they are cool. Dad said, that he sees it the same and the Fury shouldn’t do such a fuss about it, but he obviously is the agent of agents and it’s his job to be suspicious. Dad is on our side in this matter but if the others are not, we are screwed.” Peter answered, getting more nervous each second that passed.
Wade shared a look with Peter. Peters eyes where fearful. His heart squeezed tightly in his chest when he had to see Peter this fearful.
Peter nodded, strolling forward and into his Dad’s open arms before harsh sobs shook his frame and the tears started to slip freely.
"Its Tony Mum! He is gone!" Steve stopped for a short moment, turning towards his Mum. His eyes where desperate and there were tears in them. "He is gone Mum." He whispered and sobbed, all dams broken. Steve fell down on his knees crying openly. "He left! He just left Mum! He promised but he left and..." Steve cried.
“You asshole, get off me”, she hissed, shoving Norman from herself and standing up again. Her view zeroed in on Peter as she took a run-up towards him.
Steve laughed heartedly as I remembered what happened last night and then he said: "That is not a nice good morning greeting Tony."
“That doesn’t give him the right to hurt you all the time”, Peter grumbled. His eyes were red and puffy. Now that the anger left him, sadness took the place of it. “Oh god, why do I have to cry now!”
I didn't miss the worried look in her eyes as I sat down to nurse my cup of coffee and push down my muesli before I would go up again to brush my teeth. But I was happy she didn't say anything because I hate talking about feelings and even more so in the morning shortly before I would be forced to go to school.
Steve sighed as he stood up and went into the bathroom. Another night full of nightmares and guilt, Steve thought.
I sighed and got even more frustrated when the bell rang, because class was the last thing I wanted to think about in that moment.
It hurt. It burned through Tonys body like fire. Tony was like fire, hurting and burning everyone who would come near him. Not even Steve, who would stand up for everyone, could stand Tony.
"I will not look like Robert Downey jr. when I am older!" I grumbled and crossed my arms over my chest.
He really made me want to tear my fucking hair out sometimes, with these stupid comments he was constantly throwing at teachers and these idiotic jokes that came out of his mouth, but he was never ever sad.
I jumped, when I felt someone’s hand, most likely Steve’s, on my elbow and than looked up at him with wide, fearful eyes.
“Mr. Stark I really need to ask you to leave now, or I will call the police.” Mrs. Rogers said in a hard tone.
“Ugh, I think I have cheese in my underwear.” Dad groaned and Peter couldn’t help himself but laugh. First Tony looked questioningly at Peter but soon joined in the laughing fit.
“Gosh Tony! We don’t need money, we just… we want to help you, okay? We like you and we care about you and that’s not, because we want something from you. We really just want to help you, because of you, because of you just being Tony”, Steve said.
Howard pulled at my leg. I scratched my stomach over the window, my hands clutched desperately on the wall outside and when he nearly managed to pull me in again, I finally kicked him as hard in his face as I could.
"Boys please, it's already eleven pm and you are still awake. You have school tomorrow, both of you", Mrs Rogers voice came loudly from the kitchen.
Tony and the other Avengers, aside from Sam, Bucky and Nat, because they needed to train for their mission, sat down around a huge table inside Shield HQ.
The Doombots as annoying as there were came in a never ending flow, destroying everything that would get in their past, besides the Avengers because obviously, they were much stronger than them.
“It’s better than last time! Man, I really don’t want to get choked by a giant octopus again. Never. Ever. Again!” Hawkeye answered, shuddering loudly to underline his disgust.
Wade and his granny had left after waving goodbye and now Peter stood here, next to his Dad and in front of Steve and Bucky.
“Maybe they just don’t want us to know their secret identities”, Tony explained. “They are young, they both probably still go to school, now think how shit would hit the fan when they parents find out. Maybe they are afraid of that.”
With three large steps he was at the bin and threw his whole meal away before he put the tray back and left the room.
In the end they were ten minutes late, but because their first lesson was history with the most boring teacher in the whole universe it wasn't that much of a problem. Actually the teacher always focused so hard on his lecture that he wouldn't even know when anyone came into his class late.
“I think Tony was just confused. I would be confused too if people who never gave a damn thing about me suddenly wanted to talk to me and asked me how my day was”, Jane giggled in Thor’s lap.
"He won't, Tony. He can't." Steve answered. There was sadness in his voice and a strong determination. "I won't let him."
I didn’t knew where to go, my phone was at home with my shoes and slowly the adrenalin washed away and the pain started to creep back into my body.
Jarvis took care of me. I liked Jarvis, he was warm and actually proud of me, when I came up with new ideas for robots.
His chocolate brown eyes were resting on mine for just a few seconds and there was sadness in them.
Peter’s breath hitched as Wade’s hand rubbed over his cock, as he slowly crept closer and with his other hand grabbing Peter’s neck to pull him into a kiss.
Steve avoided Tony’s eyes and Tony couldn’t help it but feel a little “pang” inside his chest, every time Steve turned his head when Tony looked up at him.
“Wade, you forgot your unicorn plushy in the living room, Peter, your Dad is here”, she said sternly, threw the unicorn plushy in Wade’s face, who scolded and then left the room.
He dropped the note, staring at something only he could see... something terrible... His whole vision was plastered with pictures of Tonys beaten body, screaming for help...dying.
"Ive seen you naked before Petey and ouch you didn't even try to fight over me", Wade pouted and went up to Peter to wrap his arms around his upper body.
"Steve, I am sor-" I started to apologize but was interrupted by Steve: "Don't you dare apologize for that!" And then he leaned forward, taking my wrists and pulling me towards him. He kissed me again. At first I was too shocked to do anything but let him doing it but then I closed my eyes and started to kiss back. I was lulled into a cover of honey and sandal wood. Steve was warm and his lips were as soft as I always imagined they would be. First I hesitated a bit, nipping on Steve's soft lips, tasting him, trying to remember every second of it. Then I wound my arms around him, pressing him to my chest so we would be closer. Steve wrapped one arm over my head to keep me locked to his lips the other one pressing my upper body against his.
Two years passed since the divorce between Tony and Steve. Two whole years where Tony slept alone in his big bed, that he had bought for Steve because he had always complained that their bed was too small for them both. Two whole years where Steve found Bucky and moved in an apartment with him, breaking Tony’s heart all over again.
He washed his face and put some training clothes on, before he silently left the small apartment and breathed in the cold, fresh morning air. Steve jogged his usual round in the morning, lapping Sam three times before he went back to his apartment.
It was Friday after school now, I was at home in my workshop, fiddling with some wires for my new robot I would call “Butterfingers”, so that “You” and “Dum-E” would have another friend, while I was in school.
I didn’t know what got into the others, that they suddenly seemed to like me, but I never actually had something like this before. Of course there were Pepper and Rhodey, but they often met with Steve and Bruce, Natasha, Clint, Thor and Jane.
The school bell rang before anyone could say anything and, relieved that I had a reason to go, I grabbed my stuff and left the room. Still, I couldn’t forget the faces the others had pulled, because in every single one was a trace of guilt visible too.
My mood got brighter when I realized I had history now, which was, along with art, my favorite class, but then I saw Tony entering the room and remembered that, right, he had history with me too.
Second chapter whoo whoop! Its I think the fastest time I've ever updated and now I am going back watching avengers assemble although I should probably sleep because of school tomorrow!
The soft kiss turned into a harsh one and soon Steve's tongue slipped into my mouth, exploring every corner of it.
I watched them go over to Tony, who slowly raised his head when they came into his view. It somehow looked… painful.
His nails dug into my mothers arm, she had a black eye and there was fear in her eyes, but she still managed to stand tall against him.
Now shit hit the fan. Wade didn’t curse, nor made his a joke. He is angry, not even Peter is going to stop him now from doing something stupid. He can just support him.
“Just for the record”, Pepper added, “You were being an asshole, but Tony can be an asshole too, if he wants to, so it’s really not that bad.”
"I am flattered" Peter snickered and then they made their way towards the parking lot with a sinking feeling in their bodies that seemed to follow them already the whole day, since Tony told them to tell Steve about their relationship.
“Yeah, I feel guilty, because of what Pepper said and tried to be nice to him today in English. At first he didn’t seem to mind but then he suddenly asked me if I wanted something from him and when I said no he was confused and walked away”, I told them and looked at Pepper with questioning eyes.
“Bye Wade, see ya tomorrow in school” Peter shouldered his backpack for school and went downstairs to see his father standing awkwardly in the hall waiting for him.
In a blink of an eye I stood, my vision swam, but suddenly energy streamed in waves through my blood.
“Because I already read them, pirate”, Tony grinned widely, making Steve roll his eyes and the other avengers chuckle.
"I have seen no such thing, Wade. I think its your crazy mind making up stuff" Peter grumbled and started to walk towards the exit.
“We could start by sitting with him during lunch”, Bruce suggested and pointed towards Tony who was sitting alone at an empty table.
Peter clenched his fists around his shirtsleeves even harder as he heard this. Tears starting to burn up in his eyes.
Bucky made eggs and bacon, some pancakes and coffee and he was just cutting some fruit when Steve came up to him.
I was so glad about that that I started to ignore his insulting jokes and comments he still uttered now and then and sometimes even started to laugh about them.
I screamed as loud as I could as I saw a giant shadowy man standing in the door way, before my whole body shook and I found myself in Steve's room with Steve standing over me, looking worriedly in my eyes.
“I love you Steve, I love you with all of my heart and I want you to be happy and I know you are more happy, when you are with Tony, than when you are with me.” Bucky added.
Clint and Natasha were placed in front of me. Clint like always couldn’t hold back his stupid comments and was now rubbing his sore cheek, while Natasha was being her usual scary self, who seemed completely unfazed by the whole situation.
"I may have a plan, but... I am not sure if its a good one. Its dangerous and if there would be a different option than I would never consider something like that but in this case I think we don't have a choice."
“No, he only visited me when I was with Papa and I have my Game Console with you because Papa doesn’t want me to play it” Peter answered.
“But what if they aren’t afraid of us, getting information about their identities or thinking them as threats, what if they are threats, trying to gain the trust of the citizens so that they are safe of being harmed by us. We need to put this point in question too”, Clint blended in.
“Dad, I am sixteen years old, I really don’t need a good night kiss anymore” Peter laughed and then turned around in his bed as his Dad stood up and left.
They had argued a lot in those times. Mostly it was because Tony had been reckless again, sometimes because Tony had worked with Peter on stuff in his workshop that was too dangerous for Peter and sometimes because he wouldn’t help in the household and would give Peter the wrong example.
"So, what are the reasons for calling us at this early hour in such an urgent voice, Steve?" Thor asked with his booming voice, earning a harsh glare from Natasha, who calmly went on playing with her knives.
I imagined him saving me, telling me that everything will be okay now, that he will protect me and my father will never again get near me. Maybe even tells me, that I am not worthless and stupid, but that would be too much. It was just daydreaming after all.
Hey guys, sorry it took so long to update but I really don't know how to continue this story. If anyone has ideas please write it in the comments, I would be happy to read them or if someone has an idea for a new story. And a huge thanks to all the readers that still stick to the story even though I take so long with the updates. ;)
Tony dreamed about fires and Steve and Peter. He couldn't save them. Why couldn't he save them. They were falling screaming his name, screaming for his help, but Tony just couldn't move. His feet wouldn't budge. He just stood there and watched them fall. Watched them burn. He screamed in rage and pain but there was nothing he could do and why was there nothing he could do. Why would life take everything good away from him. He heard Steves promise: "I will never leave you Tony, I promise."
Tears welled up in my eyes when I heard his belt open, not an eye blink later the metal of the belt crashed down on my back and my skin broke where it hit me.
I watched the red liquid drip from the cut, watched it forming a puddle on the white floor. It was a nice color play and for a long time it was the only thing that kept me going. To know that I have control over me, that I can put marks on myself, that I cant watch the colors mix on the floor and then I exaggerated it. Suddenly the pool of blood became big and my vision blurry and then there was nothing.
We still tried our best to be nice to Tony whenever we saw him but he didn’t even look at us anymore and, even though I thought that was just rude, I kept trying anyways.
"Sir. It is six o'clock in the morning. Young Sir and Mr. Wilson are currently sleeping peacefully in young Sir's room. It's currently 17 degrees outside and the sky should be clear for the reminder of the day. You are in your mansion outside of New York", Jarvis said, effectefly calming Tony.
"Because, Jarvis, Steve said that Mangos are the best fruits that exist and that Peter should eat one a day, because otherwise his immune system could suffer", Tony huffed.
“No way!” Peter yelled, making both his parents flinch because of his outburst. “I want to spent as much time with Dad as I do with you!”
"You so cute, baby boo boo", Wade cued into Peters neck. Peter laughed. "Wade stop! That tickles!" Peter giggled and tried to put Wade off him.
“Mom’s hot chocolate is the best in the world”, Steve exclaimed and took one cup for himself and the other for me.
"Of course you can, of course. Just... come." He held out his hand for me and again I took it gratefully letting myself be helped to stand up and lead to Steve's bed.
“What do you mean? Do you want to bench me now?! You are not serious are you?” The last part sounded anxiously and even Papa was shortly too stunned to answer, but then he clenched his hands into fists as Tony went on talking.
“You idiot!” Peter giggled as Wade slang his arms around Peter’s hips shoving him towards the classroom. “Come my boyfriend, lets wipe the smile from your face from our history teacher.” Wade opened the door for him and then they both settled down on their seats.
“Ow!” She whimpered and held her head as she lurched around the cafeteria. Then she puked on Norman who just got his senses back.
“I am going to the bathroom”, I announced and marched out of the room, curious looks following me, until I shut the door.
"Your Dad called me this morning, that I have to pick you up from school today, because you need to tell me something?" Steve started the conversation.
“No, it’s too early…”, he mumbled and turned around, shoving his head under the pillow and cuddling deeper into the soft, fluffy bed sheets.
I know I am not a person someone would love to hang around with, I know I was stupid, a failure, the freak of the Stark family, someone who bring everyone, who tries to get nearer, down with him.
“Look at that, seems like Tony Stark is freezing his ass of in the middle of summer. Apparently he really doesn’t have feelings,” I laughed and the others turned to look at Tony.
As the two hours history passed and the following awful math and English lessons Wade and Peter found themselves in the cafeteria, eating their lunch.
Steves Mum raised one eyebrow in a silent demand, to really not do such a stupid thing, bevor she smiled a rueful smile and said: "Good, when this is all cleared up, I will make my way over to the police. See you all later."
Then his face got in my vision and I felt his arms on my upper body. He helped me up, but I couldn’t help it and fell back in his arms.
“You don’t need to play the nice act now okay and you don’t need to pretend as if you would care about me, I am fine, Peter is fine, he is having a lot of fun and stuff.” Tony grumbled.
“No Dad! I don’t want to go to Papa now, I want to stay with you this week! I want to finish the hoverboard and do other stuff we do. We don’t even need to finish the hoverboard but I want to stay with you this week!” Peter pleaded and Steve could hear the anger that lay beneath it.
After school Steve and I went to the ice cream shop and sat down in one of the grass islands in the city, doing some homework outside. I helped Steve with some math and physics homework and he helped me a little bit with my art project, before we went to the library to get some new books.
“Cap, I think I found the source of the Doombots!” Tony said after they fought them for nearly the whole morning.
“Okay J, bring the music on!” Tony ordered and then “Back in Black” by ACDC blasted through the whole mansion.
They visited me through out the two weeks but well it was nice to finally meet them outside the house of Mrs. Rogers.
“Only if you promise, that we will find a solution about how we will get them back together”, Peter said.
"Not in this language, young man" Steves Mum came storming through the door, looking at all of them seriously.
“Okay, okay! I really started to like him more than a “normal” friendship, but it doesn’t matter, because he doesn’t love me, because I behaved like an asshole, okay!” I screamed and then hid my face under my arms.
“Don’t pout, just promise you won’t eat so fast when I give you back the plate and tell me something about your school day,”
I am a real author now too. :) So if you like my work and are german, cause my work is only available in german right now, please don't be shy to write me.
Tony knew it. It was his own damned fault. He shouldn't have put Mrs. Rogers and Steve in this situation. They were good people. People who deserved nothing bad in their live. What was Tony even thinking, forcing himself in their lives. What the hell was wrong with him.
"Steve whats wrong? What happened?" She asked worried as she saw him running with a jacket in hand towards the door.
All these things made me so much more frustrated when he rejected us that I got to the point where I just wanted to grab him and shake him until he wanted to be friends with us as well.
"Ssh" His mother soothed him. Tears were forming in her own eyes from seeing her son in so much pain and despair, but there was nothing she could do as long as Steve wouldn't let her. "Steve, you need to calm down. Please, calm down. My son." She kissed him on his head, hugging him strongly to her chest.
Tony had tried to talk to Steve, over and over again, asking him if he was serious, if he really wanted to do that, oh please Steve, think about it, I love you, I love you so much.
”Sounds weird” I said. “It’s awesome” Steve answered. “Okay, if you say so” I replied. After watching though some other books and just enjoying the smell of the books we went to the counter and paid for the books we choose to buy. I’ve gotten some books on physics too and Steve wanted to read the story’s of 1001 nights, which dude... two books in bible format with over 2000 words... the fuck! But Steve was determined and bought them and then we went our way back to Steve’s home where his mum already waited with food for us. Spaghettis! Yum!
I scowled and tried to get the plate back, but Mom was faster and soon I slumped back down in my seat, frustrated and pouting.
“Hey, Tony it’s okay”, Steve whispered and pulled my chin up. He smiled at me and I could feel my heart stutter. “Don’t worry, they like you just as much as they like anyone else in the group. Don’t be afraid. We will see hs later in cafeteria Okay?” I nodded, still blushing. Did they really like me? Steve gave me one last kiss and then disappeared down the hall to his art classes with Darcy and Jane.
He felt Steve’s gaze on his back, as he drove quickly down the street. The motor of his car howling loudly and calming him down a bit. Good old Technology, never lets him down.
For a while everything was normal, except for Tony, who was oddly silent today, which even earned him a few concerned looks from Coulson, who was practically inviting him to make his jokes.
Steve opened the door to his room just as I said: "Because even though Robert Downey jr. is my favorite actor and he does a hell of a good job in being an actor and the movie is really, really good too, it has actually not much to do with the original Sherlock Holmes."
"I know you are here. Come out and play with me, Tony!" Dad laughed loudly. "You know the game with the belt? You were a naughty boy Tony. Making yourself comfortable in another ones house. Did you think I would forget you? Did you think I would just leave you alone?"
I want to get to his soft core, I want to be the one getting warmed by the fire surrounding him, I want to be the one he goes to, when his life is awful and I want to hold him, protect him and kiss him.
However, when I finally went to bed that night, I stayed awake for a long time, just staring at the ceiling and thought about everything I learned about Tony that day and when I laid there like that, moon shining through the window and soft blankets wrapped around my body, I thought that maybe, maybe Tony held a little bit more to him than I first thought.
Hand in hand we walked out of the house and made our way to school. It was a sunny morning. And the warm light felt good on my skin. It felt like summer and ice cream and love. It was awesome.
Although I thought I wouldn't be able to sleep again, with Steve's solid presence beside me, his arm around me making me feel protected and safe, I fell back to sleep rather quickly again.
“Oh and how I understand. I know you still love Tony, Steve. I know you agreed with a relationship with me to take your mind off of him. I know you, Steve and I forgive you. I am your best friend, you helped me with everything when I came back from Hydra. You were there for me and if I hadn’t have you in this time, I probably would have gone crazy, maybe I wouldn’t live anymore, if it weren’t for you.” Bucky interrupted him.
Curiously I walked towards the hall I heard them from and stopped shortly behind Natasha. The others already standing in the doorway to the hall with a worried expression on their face, so I got worried to.
Tony just slipped under the covers when Steve finally came to his bedroom after he finished getting ready for sleep. He didn't look happy but tried a smile for Tony sake. Tonys heart squeezed. He shouldn't need to do all that for Tony. It was horrible.
"Yes, there is something we can do, so please stand up now, we can't afford to waist more time as we already have."
He put off the jacket, closed the front door and running up to his room he called all his friends via mobile phone, demanding them to be at his in less than twenty minutes.
It started out as a perfectly normal day. It was nearly too perfect... well, that should have made me start thinking. I just got to comfortable. It was catastrophic.
It seemed like it because Rhodey, Pepper and now even Coulson were behaving like they were used to this.
"Its... uhm...", Peter looked over to Wade. Wade rolled his eyes stepped forward and said: "Obviously its me. I am the problem."
“O-of course, just let me uh…” He put his glass aside and then walked over to Peter, “Just wait in my bed, I will just make myself ready and then I will come. Try to sleep, okay?”
“How can you say that? Do you no respect my unicorn plushy? Shame on you, just shame on you Peter!” Wade dramatically shook his head.
“Morning Bucks”, Steve answered and walked over to him, throwing his arms around him and kissing him on the cheek.
I heard a sickening crunch, what probably was my nose breaking, but before the pain even reached my brain I already lay on the floor gaining one kick after another.
“Tony! I am so glad you are awake!” Now Steve’s mother stood at the doorway and okay, that seals it, I really was at Steve’s house.
“It’s fine. Cry as much as you want, as often as you want essential you come either to me or to Steve when you feel sad or when something lays on your mind, promise me, okay?”
“Come Rhodey, we are bringing him up in his room”, was the only thing I heard, before I dialed mom with shaky fingers and tried to slow my breathing.
"I am sorry for waking you up, I am sorry for bothering you and your mother, I think... I think it would be better for me to go back home", I whispered and couldn't help but to sob again.
“I am sorry, Steve. I didn’t mean it like that. Everyone knows you don’t like Tony. It’s just that sometimes, it really pisses me off how people think about him. I mean, he’s still a person and he still has feelings, but sometimes it seems like people forget that and then they’re like ‘Huh? What’s wrong with Stark?’ but hell, he‘s just a person too and ugh, I am truly sorry, it’s nothing against you. You know, the whole situation with him sometimes stresses me out and…”
"What!" Tonys head shot up and he pulled away from Steve. "No! The police is on his side. He will just pay them and then they will go away and it will be more terrible for us all in the end!"
“I don’t understand how you can put up with all the shit Steve throws upon you!” Peter yelled angrily when they Tony and him both sat in the car, on their way back to the mansion.
He started to talk to Natasha, even though I was fairly sure that he was still mildly scared of her.
"Oh no, you won't", Peter said sternly holding Wades T-Shirt in a strong grip, effectifly stopping him from fleeing the situation. Wade rolled with his eyes but stayed put.
"What!" His mum came running down the stairs. Her hair was sticking up in every direction, she was still clad in her pajama and held a toothbrush in one hand. Her eyes were wide from fear and she nearly toppled over, so fast she was going.
We talked with Mrs. Rogers about the day, before we went in Steve’s room and started reading together in our new books and damn “hitchhikers guide to the galaxy” was fucking awesome. I think I’ve never laughed so hard in my life about a book.
I loved that sweater, my luck that the fabric was to thick my father couldn’t rip it apart. It was a small victory, but it was good enough that my father couldn’t destroy everything I loved.
"Fine. But if I don't like it, then I will go to Howard and you both will not interfere. Deal?" Tony looked both of them in the eyes.
Although Peter thought his dad cool and loved to work with him in the workshop, the equipments wasn’t too dangerous for him and Peter always loved to do the dishes with his dad because they mostly end in a foam fight or something. But obviously Peter was too young to judge about that at least it is what his Papa, Steve, always says, when he tries to defend his dad.
My eyes felt heavy, but the lights were on, so Rhodey was home, that was good. It looked warm in there and it was so cold outside.
Tony clenched his fists, his face stayed blank, as he answered: “Everything is glorious, Steve, what do you want?”
He smiled back at me when we passed us in the hallways, what made my heart flutter, though I would never admit that out loud. He helped Clint during math and they even started doing pranks together.
I didn’t know why I did it, but it just felt like I should tell somebody and so this whole thing came up again, but what confused me even more was that my mom somehow seemed to know something about Tony too.
Steve helped Bucky, cleaning the table, before they both gave each other a good-bye-kiss and parted their ways.
“Seriously this guy is annoying! Geez look at this tech, this is all bullshit!”, Tony complained as he shot one through the chest, grabbing another one by the arm and throwing it into a group of Doombots were they exploded.
I shook all over. Goosbumps tickled on my skin and I shuddered. I curled up into a ball, trying to shield my body with the bed sheets that strangely were still the ones I covered my self with last evening.
They both went out of the house, Tony locking the door after them and then moving towards the beautiful car, resting peacefully in the driveway.
Slowly but surely the room came into view and his heart rate sank, his breath came slower and he let himself fall down on the bed, trying to stop the skating of his body.
We were sitting in Steve's living room, watching Sherlock Holmes and Steve couldn't stop but annoy Tony with telling him how the actor will be his future looking.
"Call up your friends Steve. Tell them to come now and quickly. We need all the help we can get. I am going to call the police in the meantime."
""Should I order something to help you the next time you try to cut a Mango, Sir?", Jarvis asked the sarcasm clearly heard.
When I did, my eyes shot open and I frantically tried to get off the bed, what succeeded in me, falling to the floor with a loud thud, that made me hurt more than before.
"He will kill you if I don't do what he says", Tony sobbed, trying to pull away from Steve again. Steve wouldn't let him.
"I wont let you!" Steve screamed. "Please don't do this to me." Steve fell down on his knees in front of Tony not knowing what to do. He felt completely lost and out of control of the situation. Everything was perfect. Everything was good. Stupid Howard. He had to destroy everything. But Steve wouldn't let him. Steve wouldn't let Howard take the most precious thing he ever had from him.
“Because he is mean to you. He didn’t had the right to hurt you and break up with you two years ago and since then he does nothing but to give you the fault when I fuck up”, Peter whimpered, shortly before the first tear slipped down his cheek.
“Oh Bucky, I am so sorry!” He sobbed and threw his arms around Bucky, hugging him tightly and hiding his head in his boyfriends neck.
“He is not too small to understand Steve. He is not five years anymore, okay? He is nearly an adult and he does understand”, Tony said to Steve.
Mrs. Rogers laughed. “Well Tony, I think you should hurry up a bit, otherwise you are both going to be late.”
Fear dropped like a stone into the pit of my stomach and I nearly got sick right here on the floor, when I saw him.
“Okay, stop! Seriously, what is wrong with all of you? Can’t a guy just eat his damn meal without stupid people like you trying to bother him?!”, Tony interrupted me.
“Dad! For fuckssake! Do you know how long other students in my class stay awake during school?! 1 am is not that long okay, as I already said, I stayed awake for much longer already.” Peter glared at the window, not meeting his Dad’s eyes.
I am a real author now too. :) So if you like my work and are german, cause my work is only available in german right now, please don't be shy to write me.
"Now!" He nearly yelled. Wade and Peter jumped and Wade didn't loose time to scramble out of the car as fast as he could.
“You smell good”, I complimented him and then looked away, shocked about my own words, because damn, what the hell is wrong with me?
I sat down at the kitchen table, ate and caught my thoughts always drifting off to a certain blond haired, muscular, tall guy that first didn’t like me and now somehow changed his mind.
“It’s fine, Peter. They don’t know that we are Deadpool and Spiderman. We just wait for what they say about us and when they see us as threats, then we will just stop for a little while until the whole situation settles down again.” Wade’s voice was soothing and calm and Peter could only think again, about what a wonderful boyfriend he has.
It was 2 pm when he finally arrived home, parked his car in front of the mansion and when finally inside, slammed the door furiously and hid in his workshop until Peter came home.
"No need to apologize, I feel the same, but we can't let our emotions cloud us now. We need to do something. And because I have to go to the police personally to get their asses towards Tonys house, I need you all to behave and not go there on your own, getting footage of what happens there and saving Tony from his fathers grasp. Got me?"
“I talked with Tony today and he helped me with my math homework”, Clint explained happily. “I finally understood probability calculations. I am going to rock the next
”Tony calm down, my Mum was joking. We are not going to be too late to school.” Steve rolled his eyes and threw his Mother an annoyed look. Mrs. Rogers looked guilty.
Steve smiled at me softly. “Come Tony.” He said warmly and held his hand up to me. Grateful for the help I took his hand when I reached him and returned the smile.
“I mean, at least you are smart. I am like the dumbest dumbass of all dumbasses”, Wade rolled with his eyes.
"Wow you're daddy is scary", Wade whispered when both he and Peter went out the kitchen door to the bathroom upstairs.
He always seemed to know everything better, couldn’t stop making jokes out of everything and everyone, was always out partying and drinking and slept with everyone.
"Is everything okay? Are you alright?" The anxious voice of Mrs. Rogers came from the door. "Tony are you okay?"
Anyways, in the moment our eyes met I thought I saw someone different and it made my chest tighten and - wait… was that a bruise under his eye? But before I could question it any further he turned his head again and the thought bruise was gone.
Steve shook his head. “Oh, okay then...” I nodded, blushing furiously at how much I miscalculated the situation.
Tonys heart hammered in his chest. His lungs burned as if he had run a marathon. Sweat coated his forehead. Panic and fear squeezed his heart as if it was trying to explode in thousand peaces in his chest. As if that would help to stop feeling something.
“I am meeting with the rest of the Avengers. We are going to discuss what we do about Spiderman and Deadpool, of we are going to recruit them or see them as threats.”
This was the best time I’ve ever had in school, because Tony somehow made everything funnier and better, and by opening up to us we loosened up ourselves and I think he even made the bond between all of us stronger.
"Its okay, Tony. Its okay", Steve whispered and pulled Tonys head to his chest. Tony sobbed, trying to calm down but not able to stop the flow of tears.
"Wade and I should make ourselves ready for school and then eat your breakfast without complain and then you drifted of."
Steve looked startled, then he looked to Wade with a not so happy expression before he turned to Peter.
He helped Thor in physics and managed to get Bruce to talk to Betty and didn’t flee from us in the cafeteria.
“She can smell it” Wade answered, pouting. “I know that because I made it with my unicorn plushy in the living room to see if she will notice it.”
"I want Wade to come with us Papa, I need to tell you something and Wade has to be there too" Peter said with a determined voice.
I swallowed heavily. I was not in the room with Steve anymore. My heart beat rapidly in my chest and my breath quickened.
"We both won't", Mrs. Rogers said from somewhere behind. "I just called the police and told them what just happened..."
“Pancakes!” He answered happily and showed him a plate full of little distorted pancakes. “J helped me, I think they didn’t taste too bad. I wanted to let you sleep a little bit until I finished breakfast but now that you are here, just settle down, I will bring you your breakfast.”
“Pshh, it’s okay, it’s okay.” Tony mumbled sweet nonsense in his ear, while rubbing his back and just being there for his son. “I love you.”
Wades stomach felt like there where thousands butterflies flying around. He felt like that everytime he looked at Peter, seeing him, just thinking of him made him nervous. He coudn't understand what Peter might see in him, but he knew one thing: He wouldn't ever let any harm come to him. Peter was just too precious for this world, too nice, too forgiving and Wade loved him for that. Wade loved Peter more than he ever thought possible and he would try his damn best to no let any harm come to him.
“Thanks for your help in math by the way. I would have never managed it without you”, Clint tried again to start a conversation with him.
“I am a bad boyfriend and a bad best friend! I feel like I am using you and I can’t do it anymore”, he sobbed.
Dad sighed loudly. “I knew I made a mistake letting you stay up for so long. Damn, Steve is going to kill me, if he ever finds out.”
“Hey Dad”, Peter greeted him and then hugged him. With his now sixteen years old, he was slightly taller than his Dad and he couldn’t help but point it out in every occasion he got.
“No, its not, we are going to talk about that” Steve growled and then ignored Tony the whole way through the debrief until he was alone with him in the workshop.
Steve had cried again, Tony had cried again and Peter had cried, clutching Tony’s hand desperately. He loved his Dad, he didn’t want to leave him.
"And I would help you. There are a lot of sufficient ways to get rid of a body Mr. Wilson I assure you"; Jarvis chimed in.
He was wearing a thick sweater with his hood pulled over his head, even though it was extremely hot outside.
“Come, I have something for you okay?” Tony dragged him forward to his working table, showing him the hoverboard. “It’s finished, and I though we could try it and when it functions, we could paint it in the colors you like.”
“What is it? What happened?” I tried again, more frantically this time and then I got a glimpse of who exactly was in the hall. It wasn’t only Pepper, Rhodey and Rhodey’s mom, but Tony too.
"Your are not worth it, Tony." He heard his father say. "You will never be worthy. Someone like Captain America would just laugh at you."
My heart thumbed against my ribcage as if it wanted to jump out of my breast and gallop away. Adrenaline rushed through my veins and I held the door so tight, my knuckles turned white.
"Jesus, you scared me!", Tony yelled at Wade who stood there still laughing about what Jarvis just said.
"Don't be sorry, it's okay Tony. Everything is alright. You are fine." Mrs. Rogers hand rubbed my back and Steve sacked against me, wrapping me in a huge hug.
"Of course you like Iron Man, he literally has your whole personality!" Steve rolled his eyes but grinned at Tony.
Steve, knowing he wouldn’t be able to sleep anymore stood up and went into the living room. Usually he would go for a walk, do some sports to keep his mind from running but now he was just to tired.
Jane just rolled her eyes at her boyfriend and placed herself near Natasha and Pepper, whereas Thor threw himself at me.
“So how was your day with your friend?” Tony asked Peter as they both sat in the car driving in the direction of the mansion.
Steve rolled his eyes fondly at his boyfriends remark and quickly jumped under the shower, when he was done, they both sat down at the small table and ate their breakfast.
"Wha..." I frantically scrambled backwards and then hit the floor with a loud "THUMB" as I fell off of the bed.
After they both finished their breakfast, Dad cleaned up the kitchen as Peter brushed his teeth and made himself ready for school.
But Tony was also loud and obnoxious, he seemed like he didn’t care when people are mean to him, just brushing it off, as if it was dust, even though he does. He built himself an armor and put on a mask to protect himself. With all his stupid comments and his sometimes terrible behavior he tries to warn people, to keep them away from him. His soft core was surrounded by fire and when you get near him to fast and to hard, he is going to burn you.
“Fury has his reasons to be suspicious. He did went to a lot of shit and with such a secret organization on his back, he needs to be that kind of suspicious, but I see your point Bucky and I will say it when we discuss the matter.”
“You are pathetic. An old man who knows his time is up soon. You are desperate and afraid of letting go, so you let your fear out on me and your son. Especially your son, because you know he is smarter than you and he will lead Stark Industries in a new and better area and you will be forgotten. You are a coward, Howard!” Mum growled ad then
“Really? As you cared about me when we broke up, you broke your promise and left me alone?” Tony interrupted Steve tiredly.
Tony, who was still trying to catch his breath, made himself tall in front of our teacher, shrugged and responded with a smirk
"He should not be able to get in now", she said after trying the lock for the hundredth time. "We are safe."
It was Wednesday morning and I was sitting half asleep in my seat, drawing stupid sketches of my teacher in my notebook when suddenly the door burst open and Tony stumbled into the room.
“I know you love me Steve and I love you too, but your heart lies with Tony and not with me and I want you to do what your heart says. I will never leave you Steve. You are not going to loose me because of this. I forgive you and I love you.” Bucky said softly, wiping Steve’s tears from his cheek.
“Peter, you don’t understand. Some conversations have to be discussed between Tony and me, okay. Don’t throw yourself into things you are too young for”, Steve explained carefully.
“He is not going to forgive me, Bucky. He doesn’t love me anymore”, Steve whispered not meeting Bucky’s eyes.
They both didn’t know that Tony came up from his workshop and hearing the moans if his son and his best friend quickly darted back down in his workshop.
This happened two years ago. Now Peter had some stuff with his Papa and some stuff with his Dad, seeing the hurt still lingering in both of their eyes, knowing they both still loved each other but not able to do anything until now.
A smile crept over my face, while I remembered strong hands, warm hugs and a deep voice, that made my heart flutter and my stomach twist.
"Good, no go make yourself ready for school while I still try to fight this mango", Tony mumbled and turned around.
Rhodey and Pepper officially belonged to our group, but they were always there for Tony, even though he was kind of an ass sometimes.
“I said, “Shut up Gayfucker, no one asked you for your opinion”, Ajax grinned cruelly. “You wanna punch me now scarface? You think you are strong enough?”
Steves whole body shook and his voice trembled, when he said: "Tony is gone and if we don't do anything in the next hour or so, he will probably not be alive anymore."
It was warm outside, the sun shone brightly, birds chirped and people happily made there way through the streets as Steve and me sat down on a bench in the park to drink our coffees in peace.
Then they put on the beamer and produced some files on the wall. Next to the files were some video clips where Spiderman and Deadpool fought against some bad guys. Every video had a different date and showed different situations.
"Sorry sleeping beauty I was shocked you already were awake, I thought I could kiss you to wake up", I smirked and felt even more smug when I saw the deep blush creeping up Steve's face.
"He came here last night, demanding from Tony to return home. When Mum and I refused to let Tony go, he told him that if he wouldn't come till this morning, he would regret it."
Tony sighed again and stood up, figuring that he wouldn't be able to fall asleep anytime soon again, he ordered Jarvis to start running the shower that he could change out of his sweat through clothes and put on some comfortable jogging pants and a T-Shirt. After that he went downstairs brewing some coffee and trying his best to prepare some healthy oatmeal breakfast with fresh fruits inside for Peter and Wade. Because obviously sticky, slimy oatmeal is the most healthiest breakfast for growing adults... at least thats what Steve told him.
“You did not, now fuck off or I will shoot your asses with his weapons” She huffed and disappeared in the kitchen.
Steve’s heart fluttered at the sight. He still is as cute as he was when they both went on their first date. A cold weight made itself noticeable in his chest as he thought about their first date. Tony was so cute. He remembered how insecure he was, how he said all the time, that he would probably fuck it up and Steve would leave him eventually, how Steve answered that he promised he would not. Steve swallowed hardly at the memory. He broke the promise! Guilt mixed itself with the cold weight in his chest and he had to blink a few times to clear his head again. He had Bucky now and he loved him so much, but he wasn’t Tony.
Peter was fourteen years old when he heard his parents fighting again. In the morning the alarm had went off as Doctor Doom attacked New York with his Doombots, again.
“That’s definitely better than reading Comics about Papa”, Peter whispered in between his moans and kisses.
“Well, as interesting as Rhodey’s broccoli problem is, I’d really like to go back to Bruce’s tragic love story because I’m pretty sure she’s got a crush on you too, Bruce,”
Peter looked over to Wade who shrugged. He didn't look quiet comfortable with the situation either. Peters heart still beat hard in his chest and little rushes of adrenaline coursed through his body.
"Don't be so shy Stevie Boy, no need to blush like a tomato", I laughed again and then stumbled on my feet to go into the bathroom. "If you want, you can visit me in the shower." I winked at him and laughed again as Steve groaned loudly and hid his face in his hands.
"Because in the books Sherlock Holmes' character is different, he didn't fight that much and he was never against John's and Mary's marriage and had no affair with Irene Adler", I explained as I crawled under my own covers. Steve's small room now had two beds in it since we carried the one I woke up in into his room.
"I bet this is what you look like when you are an adult", Steve laughed and pointed at the actor on the small TV.
And its not beta read... I don't have a beta reader but if you want to than you are welcome to write me, I would appreciate the help. :)
"Okay, you listen to me now. You and your boyfriend go make yourself ready for school, then you come back down and eat your sticky, disgustingly healthy food I made for you and you will not complain because it took me the whole morning because apparently there is a lot you need to consider while making oatmeal, who would have thought... but, wait... where was I...?"
Pepper and Rhodey rolled their eyes at our attempt to get a conversation going with him and Bruce was desperately trying to hide his smirk.
He dragged himself to an empty table, placed his tray in front of him and actually looked quiet sad, what made me start to regret my words.
“Hey, Peter, calm down. It’s okay”, his Dad murmured, rubbing his back and then turning to Steve he answered: “I know you don’t trust me to take care of Peter properly, but I do. I even started cooking food on my own, so that it is fresh or whatever you said would be better than ordering it all the time, okay? You just had him for a whole week and now it’s my turn. I know you don’t like it, but it was our agreement and you need to accept that.”
He looked up at me with wide eyes, as if he was shocked I actually cared enough to answer, then he shrugged it off and smiled.
It was four pm as Steve and Bucky finally made it to the school of Peter. Tony was already waiting in front of the director’s room. Next him sat an old woman with white, curly hair, Steve recognized as Mrs. Wilson. In front of them sat Wade and Peter looking ashamed on their shoes. At least they felt ashamed.
Steve stopped abruptly as I pressed my lips against his. It was fierce but short and when I pulled back I looked up into Steve's shocked face as I myself needed time to realize what the fuck I just did.
“It really is fine. It’s just for two more years and then I am eighteen and can go. I survived this long, I can survive two more years”, I argued.
They stood there for a moment. Steve looking at Wade with a stony expression and Wade fidgeting with his fingers.
We tried to be nice to Tony and Tony simply shrugged us off, as if we were just annoying bugs buzzing around his head.
I am a real author now too. :) So if you like my work and are german, cause my work is only available in german right now, please don't be shy to write me.
Steve and Mrs. Rogers exchanged some concerned looks, that I couldn’t quiet understand but ignored for the most part and after I finished breakfast I got ready in record time. As usual Steve already had his stuff put together and was waiting for me in the entrance hall, when I came stumbling down the stairs trying to shove the last of my books in my school bag.
Tonys heart stopped. Everyone knowing. All his life he tried to hide this dark painful secret from everyone and now they should all know.
“Peter!” Tony looked shocked. “Don’t talk like that about your father! He loves you and he wants the best for you and he was right, I shouldn’t have you let stay awake for so long, but I forgot the time and I am sorry, okay. I will do it better now.”
I thought that as along as the others liked me, I had to enjoy it. It wouldn’t last long, but it felt good, while it lasted, even though I first was suspicious.
“Tony, maybe Peter should come back to Bucky and me this week, just so you know… that he can settle down a bit”, Steve suggested, as they all had left the school building.
"No. You will and if he really thinks he will be able to force you and Wade apart, than he will have to fight me first, understood?"
"I am not going to win this fight anyways so do what you want but don't come crying to me like a baby when you crush into a wall", Steve huffed.
"No Tony, it would be dangerous and probably give you a lot of injuries, maybe worse", Steve said sternly.
He fucked up. He broke the promise he made to Tony and hurt him in every possible way, knowing he still loved Tony with all of his heart. He was just a coward, afraid of Tony pushing him away when he wanted to tell him he was sorry and wanted him back. Steve knew he made a mistake but it was too late now. Tony was angry with him and he has all rights to be angry with him.
Slowly but surely his eyes focused again and he stopped looking at the closed door like frightened deer but focused his gaze on Steve.
No one said anything to it. I didn’t know if it was just because they gave up or they if they just let it drop for now, but I was relieved.
She went to go, but before she turned into the living room she stopped and asked Steve: "Tell Jane to bring her camera."
Considering if he should still send Mrs. Wilson a message that Wade would sleep over he put out his phone and thinking for a while hit send.
I held it with both of my hands, letting the warmth of the cup seek through me, before I took a huge gulp.
“Aww man, that made my erection go down as fast as a whatever goes down fast!” Wade threw his hands up in the air.
We heard Mrs. Rogers yelling in the hallway before we ran downstairs and my heart froze in my chest.
“Finally Steve and you put your heads out of your asses”, Pepper grinned. “Pepper!” I yelled. The other two snickered and then we made our way to the classes.
"No Tony. It really is not. Did they do that in the past?" Mrs. Rogers asked again. Her voice was hard.
“I was with this friend of mine on the weekend and you know, we have been friends for like ten years, but there was never something going on between us. So we went to his house and watched a movie, nothing special, but then all of a sudden he just honked my boob! HONKED!” Pepper shrieked, completely outraged.
Peter knew that his Dad missed Steve. Sometimes Peter thought he missed Steve even more than Steve actually missed him but that thought Peter quickly pushed aside. The problem was, Papa would come to him when Papa couldn’t sleep at night, Dad would never come to him and it always made Peter worry when his Dad wouldn’t sleep for days. He made it to his mission to, every time he could, help him sleep and he knew for sure, that his Dad always could sleep better, when someone slept with him in his huge bed. So Peter searched for his Dad and finding him in the kitchen covered with motor oil and grease, just making himself something to drink he said: “Dad, I can’t sleep.”
Steve rolled his eyes, making Peter angry. Why would he always be annoyed by everything Tony did? Why would he always blame Tony? It wasn't fair! Why would he do that? Peter had heard Steve talking to Bucky once when Tony was injured by a mission, telling him about how worried he was about Tony and Bucky telling Steve that he still had feelings for Tony and Steve not denying it, just apologizing to Bucky. Peter knew for a fact, Steve still had feelings towards Tony, he had seen the pictures of Tony in Steves sketchbook. It was full of pictures. He knew Steve had little pictures of Tony everywhere in secret. He found one where Tony laughed at a joke someone said underneath Steves pillow. He found one in Steves car, where Tony looked concentrated while baking, splattered with baking pouder. He found one in Steves briefcase where Tony just smiled dreamly at something or someone... Peter liked to think it was Steve he looked at. It didn't matter, what mattered was the fact that Steve still held feelings for Tony and that Peter just couldn't understand why Steve would try to hurt Tony everytime he had the chance.
Silence dominated them, as they got out and went up to the front door. The door opened automatically. Jarvis knowing that Steve and Peter where at the front porch knew that they had open access to Tonys house. Loud music blared through the house indicating that Tony indeed was working in the shop, not knowing Steve and Peter where there.
"Now, would you please tell me, why you would think that I would accept Wade in your life Peter, because I don't know where I went wrong in..."
But he did. Why did Steve leave? He promised Tony, he promised he would stay. Then why wouldn't he? Why would he let Tony feel hope again and then take it from him in the most terrible way? It wasn't fair. Nothing in Tonys life ever was. Even his father had told him that.
Wades heart stopped. No, it really stopped for a moment there. When Wade finally could catch his breath to answer Peter, to tell him how much he loved him too and that he would do anything for him, Peter went on: "I don't want an answer from you now, Wade. I just want you to know." Then Peter turned towards Steve, leaving Wade to follow, without him being able to express the same feelings for Peter.
“What’s your favorite one?” Steve wanted to know, when he stood in front of a shelf full of books he all wanted to have.
“You heard me Tony. I am leaving and I am taking Peter with me. I am don with your stupid behavior. I am done with you.” With those words he turned around leaving Tony behind.
I sighed before I left the store to wait outside for Steve. He paid for his comic books too and then we both made our way to starbucks.
I woke again to a shrill sound ringing on the nightstand and groaned loudly as I rolled over, just to be directly in front of Steve's smiling face.
"Tony!" Someone screamed and I jerked awake widely looking around to make out the source of the voice. It was dark in the room only the soft light of the moon provided some seeing. I could make out the shadows of a cupboard and a desk, a door and a night stand, but otherwise the room was empty.
“I know, but it’s going to be gone, when you don’t get your stubborn ass into the shower really quick.” Bucky smiled and finished cutting the mango.
He felt the stare of Bucky on his back and swallowed again, trying to get his mind back in the here and now.
Rhodey didn’t want to talk about it either and while Bruce seemed to have at least a small idea about what was going on, Clint, Natasha, Jane and Thor were just as clueless as I was.
“Indeed, I agree with lady Natasha! We didn’t have the right to behave the way we did towards Anthony and I want to apologize by showing him my kindness!”, exclaimed Thor and smiled brightly.
“Look what I learned while you slept”, his Dad said after a while and then moved towards him with a pan in his hand.
And when you are not german you can write me anyways because I love talking to people and I am lonely. :)
Then, I didn't even realized it, Mrs. Rogers stood up and left the room. I thought she may have said something to Steve but I was too occupied in holding Steve as close as possible that I didn't even heard it. Only as Steve slowly and carefully made his way out of my hard embrace I realized that I were only Steve and myself sitting in the room.
In the end they had to extinguish the fire that broke out in the stove and ordered Pizza from the nearest Restaurant.
For a while I let my thoughts flow and my dreams warm me from the inside and then I heard a key turning in the front door and a coldness ran down my spine like ice needles prickling into my skin.
“Tony!” Pepper exclaimed and came rushing to me. Not even a second after that I had a handful of Pepper in me, that nearly knocked me over.
Tony was smaller than I was and his muscles were lean, so in contrast to me, he looked much more fragile and I really just wanted to wrap him in a blanket and protect him with all I have.
My back stung, I shivered but at the same time was soaked through with sweat and I needed a few minutes to remember what happened.
Tony didn’t look at the document, he knew what stood in their, meaning, hello, super genius here. He hacked into the files beforehand, reading about everything that concerned those two young heroes.
Bruce, who was next to me fiddling with his shirtsleeves, couldn’t hold back a giggle, but blushed like a tomato when he saw Betty Ross walking into the cafeteria halls.
I started searching for something knew and I found dad’s alcohol. I drank. Dad didn’t miss the bottles anyway, he was to out of his mind on most days and he had enough
I stuffed the last piece of the sandwich into my mouth and tried to get into my room as silent as I could, but to my misfortune my father stood at the staircase that lead up to my room.
“They are young, both of them and they didn’t do anything wrong until now, they just helped getting some bad people arrested”, Bucky said.
“That’s not true. You are just lazy. Maybe you should stop fucking your unicorn plushy so much.” Peter grinned.
Steve frowned, but bevor he could ask me more, I said: “We should go now, or we really will be late!”
“Well let’s go to classes now.” Natasha nodded her head in the direction of the class rooms. “I have history now and I really don’t want to handle this stupid teachers lecture about how I should never get late to his class.” She rolled her eyes, but everyone agreed. Bruce, Pepper, Thor and me had physics now, so we waved good bye to our friends and went our way. “Tony, wait”, Steve called and I stopped mid tracks throwing him a questioning look, but Steve just smiled at me and kissed me warmly. For a moment I just melted into the kiss and then I heard the one of the others whistle and pulled away. Heat crawled up my face and I couldn’t upset anyone’s eyes. Why had Steve done this? I mean... to show them all so openly that we were together? They probably knew this, but... to show them This. I mean it’s me we are talking about here. Why would anyone proudly show their friends that they were in love with me? I swallowed thickly and could not meet anyone’s eyes.
„Yeah yeah Jarvis, I will“, Tony mumbled and slowly made his walk over to his bedroom, falling asleep before his head hit the pillow.
After they finished in the bathroom and came downstairs to eat breakfast, they were greeted by a red faced Tony, who forced them to eat his oatmeal because "I assure you it was hard work to make this damn breakfast and you gonna eat it an appreciate it" Tony huffed and then they grabbed their bags from upstairs and climbed onto their car seats.
He sat next to Pepper stabbing his food like it personally insulted him, what probably was the reason why Pepper was staring at him with a raised eyebrow.
Wade leaned down and kissed Peter. Peter turned around in Wades arms to have better access to Wades lips and returned the kiss.
“Also, I would be afraid of us too. Everyone knows what we do. We are fighting villains, but we are causing a lot of destruction with it, our job is actually to kill threats, so that they don’t harm the city. Let’s say they are as young as we think, than I can understand them, for I wouldn’t want to cross us too. They are maybe afraid that we think them as threats and don’t want it”, Bruce added.
“Oh my god! I am so sorry! I thought I went to Rhodey last evening… I… I can… I” Panicking I looked between Mrs: Rogers and Steve and fuck that was embarrassing.
“You know we can’t! Howard is too powerful he just flicks with his fingers and everyone juts “forgets”. But it’s okay, I am used to it”, I explained.
“How was your day?”, Natasha asked him after an uncomfortable silence, where nothing was heard but the clinking of the dishes and the murmured conversations of the
“Jeez, Peter, you nearly gave me a heart attack here!” He covered his chest with his hand trying to calm himself down, while his face twisted into a worried expression.
At first I was sad, angry even, but I didn’t know where to put my rage, so I put it on myself. There are scars on my upper arm, neatly put next to each other with a kitchen knife.
The only ones he talked to were obviously Pepper and Rhodey, since they were his best friends already.
“The Avengers, Wade, they are going to discuss about us, if they are going to see us as threats or if they want to recruit us.”
I yelped, because of the pain shooting through my body and tried to calm down and slow my breathing.
When I woke up again it was in a hospital, my mum sat next to me, looked at me with red, puffy eyes.
“You see? He should sleep properly at night and not playing with tech the whole time.” Steve smiled a small smile. “You understand, don’t you?”
“You idiotic bastard! Don’t think you can ever come back!” Was all I heard, before I turned around the corner and was gone.
“Yeah, we try, but he is stubborn as fuck!”, Rhodey threw his hands in the air in an attempt to show his frustration.
I felt myself being lifted off of the ground and before I even realized it, my eyes fell shut and I faded away into darkness.
"You've heard it Dad. Papa doesn't like me hanging out with Wade, now imagine what would happen, if we told him that we are actually a couple." Peter sighed. Wade came up to Peter and clapped his hand on his shoulder, giving him support.  Tony didn't know what to say about that and for a moment he just stood there with his mouth wide open staring between Wade and Peter, not knowing what to do... what to say and then determination claimed him and his face darkened.
It was cool to do more things with Pepper and Rhodey and it was funny to teach Clint math or Thor physics and it was cool to talk science with Bruce and Jane. At least they understood a little bit. It was cool to eat Pizza with Steve or to talk to Natasha, even thought I still find her scary and I didn’t drink so much anymore, because I had friends now and could do something with them to take my mind off. My father was gone too, at least for two months, because of a business trip.
“What? What is this funny now?!” Dad’s face was red with anger, he look like a volcano, shortly before it explodes, but my mum just laughed hysterically.
The music stopped and not shortly after a slightly disheveled Tony came up the stairs. He wiped his hands on a towel smiling at Steve and Peter, but when he saw Peters pained expression and Steves thunderous one his smile fell and his heart sank in his chest.
"Everything will work out in the end, you will see" Wade just said and then they went to their classes.
“I know, that’s the problem. I am the wrong example for you. Not everything what adults do is right. We make mistakes too and I know you know that, but I have nightmares, Peter. My way of coping with it is not to talk about it and stay awake for so long that I can’t do anything different but crash down from exhaustion. It’s wrong. It’s totally the wrong way of handling things and Peter I don’t want you to become like me in this thing. If you have something on your mind, anything, just come to me or Steve and we will talk about it. We may will be angry with you and we may argue, but we love you and Peter I would do everything for you and I mean everything and so will Steve.”
We were sitting in the cafeteria for lunch break, like on any other school day and were talking about stupid weekend stories.
The first thing I realized when I woke up was, that I wasn’t lying in my bed and that I hurt all over.
Howard turned his back and left. Knowing that he had won. Knowing that Tony would do what he ordered.
“I see the problem Steve, but don’t you think Fury is a little bit too suspicious with the whole situation. Spiderman and Deadpool both never gave a sign that they want to gain our trust, if anything they even avoided us more.” Bucky countered and when he finished his last bit of pancake stood up with his plate in the hand and moved it to the kitchen.
“Um... i actually only read one fictional book in my life, because dad always told me that fictional books are for baby’s and that I should read books that give me information about my job I will later have, so...” and this was the nice way to say it, I thought but didn’t say. Steve’s face darkened. “Well then it’s time to change that”, Steve growled. “Here”, he grabbed a book from the shelf and pushed it into my arms. “Take this one. It’s awesome and funny and you will love it.”
The footsteps grew more loudly and more loudly. I peaked a glance from under my covers, resting my eyes on the suddenly huge looking door. The door was black. It looked like a giant shadow, the door towards hell.
“Okay you little love birds, I am going to clean up the mess in the kitchen. I wish you both a wonderful day.” She smiled at us and practically fled into the kitchen.
Peter quickly made his way to the bathroom, put some fresh clothes on, washed his face and then ran down the stairs towards the kitchen were his Dad stood at the stove with his cooking head, silently cursing under his breath.
"Totally worth it" Wade smirked and kissed Peter again and then Peter saw Wades erection in his boxers and smirked at Wade.
Sometimes he could hear his Papa crying at night, sometimes he cried too, in those times they both would comfort each other but it hurt him that he wasn’t able to do the same thing with his Dad too.
“Don’t tell me it was planned! Just shut up! Do we mean nothing to you? Peter and me? How do you think we feel when we see you nearly dying again and again?! “
Angel and Norman both glared angrily at Peter and Wade. Ajax stumbled on his feet again, growling furiously and soon afterwards all five of them were involved in a fight.
“Hey, it’s okay. You don’t need to be afraid or something”, Steve smiled at me. This wonderful, wonderful smile, that reminded me of warm sunshine and sugar.
"What? No, you are not going back to HIM. Don't you dare say something like that Tony, don't you dare. We want you to be here!"
“Did you already show him your Game Console?” Dad asked him smirking, one eyebrow raised in question.
My stomach growled, so I forced myself to stand up and move into the kitchen, after I shut the music down.
"Mr. Stark-Rogers and Mr. Wilson please cease your inappropriate intimacy on the school halls" Mr. Forge said sternly as he walked by Wade and Peter.
Tony loved Steve. He knew he still loved him and it made him angry that his stupid heart can’t seem to grab the hurt Steve caused him. It annoyed him that Tony couldn’t hate him, because he still loved him. Love, what a stupid feeling!
When it stopped I didn’t recognized it and just lay there, breathing deeply, trying desperately to not sob, so dad wouldn’t get any more angry.
I am pretty sure I went to Rhodey last evening, so why wasn’t I in the room, they usually had ready for me… It couldn’t be, could it?
“Why are you reading that anyways? This is bullshit” The brown haired boy threw the comic book through the room putting himself in a sideway position smirking at Peter and wiggling his eyebrows. “You could do much better stuff with your time.”
“I don’t want to hear your stupid excuses Tony! Damn it! I don’t want to hear it. Every time we go out there fighting, I am always afraid about you because you don’t listen! Fury already wanted to bench you! I overtalked him into not doing this but Tony, you are making it so difficult for me!” Peter could see the red face off his Papa, how his voice always hitched a little bit. He knew he was crying.
"Oh come on, don't be such a party pooper, I would take really high safety measurements before testing the hoverboard I want to built."
Then the whole divorce process came. The media ripped Tony apart, saying that it was sure from the beginning he would fuck up again, saying he didn’t deserved someone like Steve anyways. Through the whole process Peter wasn’t allowed to see his dad.
Never ever someone apologized and then Steve comes and he didn’t even need to apologize! For what! I mean, I was an asshole too, still am, so… what does he want now?
Yeay everybody say hello to the second chapter! I am sorry it took so long but school started again and I hadn't time and besides that I had a headache that nearly killed me!
“Well then lets make a quick exit before she really shoots our asses” Dad clapped his hand on Peter’s shoulder and together they left the house and went to the white Audio R8 waiting outside to bring them home.
“Black Widow, Thor, please go support Iron Man Hawkeye and me are going to stay in position!” Steve ordered.
"Good night", Steve answered and then promptly fell asleep. His breath evened out and his face looked peaceful, young and vulnerable. I would have loved to kiss those wonderful soft looking lips of him, to draw the lines of his body with my hands to remember every single thing and to cuddle my head in his neck to breath in this stunning scent. He smelled like sandal wood and honey.
"Oh god" Peter moaned, trying to put Wades lips back onto his own, but Wade wouldn't let him. He went on sucking Peters neck, enjoying the small whines that came from Peter. He was so sensitiv on his neck. One day Wade would make Peter come just from sucking his neck, but now he focused on stroking Peters cock, teasing him, enjoying how Peter was pressed against him, how Wade could undo him so completely.
Wade licked Peter’s lips before sliding his tongue inside to make Peter moan. Peter slipped his hand under Wade’s T-shirt, throwing it over his head. Wade did the same and it was only a matter of time, until they both lay there only in their boxers, rubbing themselves against each other.
“Yes, that is exactly why we are here, “What if”… Fury and I made a plan in this case”, Hill came into the front of the room from the corner where she stood.
I stumbled the last steps and held tightly on the doorknob, before I managed to get my frozen finger to pull the bell.
"But as long as you don't and actually I am pretty sure you won't because I know you love Peter, nothing is gonna happen to you. I mean I saw your relationship coming long before you even knew your feelings for each other. It was pretty obvious and if I really would have had a problem with that i could have done a lot of things to prevent you two from hanging out with each other. But seriously even if I had a problem with you, Wade, what I don't have and where you are the only one who could change my opinion, then I wouldn't have done anything, because Peter, its your decision and I want you to be happy and if you love someone, I am the last one you need to worry about. Its your life and your future and I will be there to support you and to help you in every situation, but I would never force myself in your life or take decisions from you, that you should make yourself", Tony said.
With still hazy eyes he looked at the clock on his nightstand, realized the time and rubbed over his eyes to get the sleep out of them. Next to him his boyfriend still slept peacefully, his chest moving up and down with every deep breath.
“Just fuck off Ajax, no one wants you here”, Peter rolled with his eyes, bumping his leg against Wade’s. He knew how much Wade hated it when someone mentioned his scars. It wasn’t his fault.
"Tony, everything is alright. Your father is gone and we will make sure that he won't be able to come here again so soon. Don't worry." Mrs. Rogers came up to him. She smiled and stroked his hair, trying to calm him down.
"Ugh" Peter groaned as the last lesson was finished for the day. "I think I never had such a boring day in my live."
Peter moaned loudly when Wade sucked harshly at his neck. Then he was lifted and put down on the sink, while Wade put the hand that didn't hold Peter in place into his pajama pants.
I tried to stand up and groaned because of the pain flaring up my back. I stumbled and my vision blurred and again Steve’s hand was there to steady me, before I fell. When I got my balance I snapped my arm away from his hand, as if it would burn me and glared at him.
Hanging up with my bots in the workshop was anyways what I rather enjoyed. I could be myself there, hide in my thoughts, in my own world and never come back. But eventually I had to, either I have to go to school or my father made sure to remind me again what a failure I am.
After the whole divorce process was over an agreement was made: Every second week Peter would stay with his Dad in the mansion, the other time he would stay with his Papa in the small apartment.
I out my long board into my locker and then made my way to my first two lessons of history together with my friends.
"In order for the plan to function we need all your friends and Tony..." She took a deep breath. "They need to know about your situation."
"Ugh gross." Peter scrunched his face up. "Now would you go out of the bathroom so that I can make myself ready?"
For just a short time, the only thing I could here was my mom’s breath in the phone, before she answered: “On my way”, and hang up.
His Dad just parked in front of the school to let Peter out as he said: “Before you show it, we should probably test it, just to make sure that… you know it doesn’t randomly blow up or something.”
Both nodded silently. Mrs Rogers inclined her head towards the living room, where all three of them went.
“Fine!” Fury huffed and turned to the others again. “Now, the problem is. There are two new superheroes in New York, fighting bad guys. They didn’t interfere with your missions yet, but it’s only a matter of time, before they both decide to rise higher in their business and be like you. Then we need to know, can we trust them and get them on the team to have a better eye on them, or should we seek them out and arrest them, because although they fight bad guys, they are doing it illegally.”
"Ah yeah and then you go to school and you are both going to be a couple and love each other, because no one ever can force anything an you, Peter. Not some random teacher, not Mrs. Wilson, not me and not Steve. Its your decision what you are going to do with your live and when you love Wade then you do it. Got it?"
Tony looked at him with a raised eyebrow but couldn't think about it too much when Peter already fell into his arms, with red rimmed eyes.
He had already heard about what his dad did this time, nearly dying again, but Papa seemed really angry this time. Peter had never seen his Papa this angry.
“It’s 7 am. How can you be this happy?” I asked him, cracking another yawn. “Can’t even keep my eyes open”, I mumbled.
It took nearly two weeks for all the worst injuries to heal and even then there still were marks on my skin that showed Dad's hand work. But this two weeks even though his wounds stung like hell had been his best and happiest weeks in his whole life and he desperately wished they would last forever.
