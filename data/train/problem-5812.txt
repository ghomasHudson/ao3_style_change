“I think Tony would tell us if there was a problem,” Bucky said quietly.
Barton shrugged, picking up the pace a little when dull sounds echoed behind them. “That’s the only way he knows how to work. He like the challenge.”
“As I said before, I just need to ask a few questions.”
“I’m here to see Fury.” Steve continued.
Stark always had to insert his opinion when Loki was brought up. Always had a quip and jest ready to go. It was constantly matched with the archer’s sarcastic wit. Even the Captain lets out a few chuckles here and there.
“You’re slipping.” Steve ran through Bucky and into the ropes.
“Just the hands,” continued Yinsen.
The trees that surrounded most of the property stood tall, like a protective fence, shrouding him from the outside world. The only open area was where the property sloped down to the private beach. The lake it rested on was shared, but Tony’s property was so remote that he hadn’t seen a single boat pass through in his time here. No sounds except the lapping of water against the shore. Sometimes, Tony found himself walking all the way to the beach, watching his feet sit upon hardened mounds of sand and be engulfed by frigid water. Tony eyes the crystal water;
“Pietro, you’re an incredibly competitive boy and a bit of a show off. Which usually, any trait you get from me should be cherished, but it’s only going to end badly.
“He’s given us too much,” she muttered angrily, shaking her head. “Pierce will continue to be a threat as long as he breathes; prison bars won’t stop him from being the HYDRA’s puppeteer.”
Steve nodded. “Makes sense. No one else knew about us meeting except for some of my crew and- don’t even think about it.”
-------------------------
Man, they just can't catch a break.
First, continued thanks and gratitude for keeping with the story. You guys are amazing and I love you all. I'm glad to see you guys are still hanging on even even as this story gets more climactic. Hopefully we'll get all these boys reunited soon!
The man looked unarmed, but that didn’t mean anything in Steve’s book. It looked as if blood matted his face, his stance threatening and stoic. It wasn’t until Steve got closer until he realized it wasn’t blood at all. It was a mask.
It was impossible to avoid his fathers voice through his head.
“We’re stronger together, you know that, right? I’ll keep you safe, you keep me safe. Square deal?” he heard Tony say on the other side of the door.
Falling out of the loop with The Captain and his crew could have devastating results, especially this far in the game. Power in numbers, right? With HYDRA on their tails, Tony couldn’t afford to be left in the dust. They were already steps behind HYDRA, if Tony fell out now, he’d find himself cornered. Because believe it or not, The Captain had resources that he didn’t. Sure, Tony could hack any mainframe, get a digital copy of almost anything, but every brain needs its brawn. This was HYDRA. The fact that they had already managed to survive their first massacre was enough proof that they wouldn’t be one to disappear again with a key simple stokes of a keyboard.
“The area’s still populated, and the last thing we need is the sound of bullets attracting unwanted police attention.”
his mind raced. Did they rush upstairs? Did they flee? There should be more, there was definitely-
“It’s simple. You’ve brought both Stark and your crew so far into your own mess, that there's no way they can both make it out alive. You leave your crew to chase after Stark, and HYDRA will have the rest of your family dead by the time the sun sets. But if you run away with your crew? Then Stark will probably end up face down in a ditch just like his father. Either way, you lose.”
Fury put up a hand to cut him off. “Go home, kid. Let the grownups work.”
“Right, sorry. Clint’s told me what’s been going on the past few days- which I've elected to ignore,” he cut in when Steve shot a hardened gaze at Clint. “It’s just, you told me to keep an eye out. For anything HYDRA related.”
“Hard to forget,” Tony frowned. “It’s just, I…,” he sighed. “That’s where I’m going. That’s where they’re sending me. I called Fury earlier and he agreed; I am accustomed to a certain lifestyle, after all, and I didn’t want to end up staying at Motel 9, you know? No one knows I own property down there, so it’s a perfect get away.” When Steve stared blankly at him, Tony frowned, continuing. “Kind of going out on a limb here, but, you ending up anywhere around there?”
“No, not that, but we’ll come back to that later,” Bucky replied. “But I’m meant the whole thing. You were all over the place.”
“Yes, Sir?”
with a shrug of his shoulders.
“Morning, Sharon.”
“You need to get out of here. You need to leave. I can’t have you going around blowing my cover. Come on.”
Tony pulled away from Steve’s grip. “I’m not some wilting flower, Cap. I don’t need a keeper; I can handle myself just fine.”
“You have no idea what I- ”
“Whatever you say, Sparky,” Clint smiled innocently. Clint relished in the other man’s jaw tic, his hands balling into fists. “What are you doing here?” Clint asked. “My memory isn’t that great, but I could have sworn that you were just here last week.”
“Sounds like we should count our blessings,” Stark replied, frowning as he said it, like he didn't believe the words coming out of his mouth either.
A small smile tugged on Steve’s lips. “Punk.”
That was, until the first donation hit. It was like hearing a forgotten melody or smelling his childhood home. It was like hearing his mother laugh again. A fragile hope that dangled in front of him like a carrot; a single drag was all it took, and Steve knew he was addicted, knew he would chase that feeling to the last drop, like an alcoholic to the bottom of a bottle.
Now blue, on the other hand. On the lower shelves there was a dark shade, navy, that had caught his eye. It reminded him of his stealth suit, his favorite one – the first one that Tony had designed for him. Steve pictured Tony laying in the sea of blue, wrapped up in his own uniform’s color. A wave of possessive satisfaction curled in his lower gut. Tony would be draped over them, his tanned skin blending mixing beautifully with the darker pallet. He’d look up at Steve with half lidded eyes and a playful smirk, as his hand trailed down his chest and wiped his hand through -
The benefit of having his identify unknown was that when he did actually make an appearance, it usually scares the living daylights out of whomever they were dealing with at the time. Steve puts in a few threats here and a few glares there, and boom: Steve gets everything and anything he wants from them.
“Maybe," he asked, hiding the hand holding his firearm under the desk. The last thing he needed to be slapped with was a public arrest for endangering a cop. "Who the hell are you?”
Steve glared at him. "What do you want?"
“I love it,” Steve found himself whispering.
“England?" Pepper blinked at him. He relished in the quick face of uncertainty she pulled, memory tracing through her schedule to see what she had missed. It wasn't every day that Tony was able to pull one over on his scrupulous assistant, but it was worth it every time. "What are you talking about?”
“Pretty sure we weren’t supposed to be in Florida either, but no one seemed to care.”
“Hi there,” she smiled, batting her fake eyelashes wildly. “I’m Susan, I live right across the street,” she said with a point.
7. Delmar White - Violence
“Fuck!” Bucky shouted, throwing his phone against the wall in anger.
He felt Clint’s amused chuckles reverberate against him. “You’re telling me,” he answered. “What the hell happened?”
“I’d let you convince me to buy a rundown car, just on the off chance it’d break down so you can fix it. I’d take you out west; speed down country roads and let you listen to that crap you call music," Steve laughed. "I’d complain when even with all your PhD’s, you still manage to get us lost, even though I wouldn’t really mind being lost with you. I’d lay under the stars with you, letting you choose the direction we went in the next day, because it would never really matter, because I would be happy as long as we’re together.”
it’s not. Well, not all of it at least. I can’t sleep, because I literally cannot sleep.”
The man watched as a fiery red head approached the lift. “Ah, good morning Ms. Potts,” he greeted warmly.
Steve woke to the sound of rustling. His body was pushed slightly from side to side as a hand tucked a blanket tight around his chest. He groaned; well, at least he tried too. The wheeze that broke from his throat sounding more like a rusty car engine trying to start.
Tony groaned, rubbing at his temples. If Pepper hadn’t called yet, there was probably nothing for him to sign. Either that, or it was the weekend, Tony wasn’t really sure.
Tony scowled at the man. “You need me to be your mother?”
Tony rose from his chair, eyeing Sitwell up and down. “Threaten my son again.
“Ooh, what a beauty.”
Steve rubbed at his temples. “For what?”
(See the end of the chapter for
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony sighed, picking the photo up, tying to unfurl the edges. Even while holding the photograph in his hand, Tony still had some doubts that the scene printed on it could be real. Not real in the sense that he still hadn't manage to figure out exactly how Barton and Coulson worked - they were both reserved, sure, but Tony had a file on Barton large enough to know the kind of shenanigans he got himself into, while Coulson seemed to be the type of guy that organized his staples - but the reality of their expressions. They looked so happy, so carefree, like the photo was snapped at a suburban barbecue. How they were able to carve out a piece of happiness and carry it through the lives they led was... intangible for him.
Phil gripped the paper tightly in his hands. “She lost her boss and a close friend. You can’t expect her to be on top of her game.”
“A doctor?” Tony asked, watching as the man tilted the tongs, the boiling metal slipping seamlessly into the mold he had earlier created.
Tony scoffed, running a hand through his hair. “You’re joking right? Like you’re having a laugh. You really can’t expect me to not tell the family that you’re not dead!”
“Um, thanks. I think.” Bruce answered, starting to poke at Stark’s wound as the engineer continued to bombard him with questions. Bruce answered each one politely, working with steady hands, only stopping to gently readjust Stark's position as the man blabbed animatedly about something Steve could never hope to understand. He could see the excitement reflected in Bruce's own eyes as he worked a neat row of stitches into Stark's arm.
Tony could feel his toes curl in pleasure at the sound of Steve’s laugh, almost missing when Steve continued with a “Come in!”
Tony picked up the last scraps of his project from the lawn.
Steve didn’t add.
Steve looked away. “I don’t know, Buck. I really don’t know.”
Tony felt wetness form along his collarbone as The Captain burrowed his face into his shoulder. Tony almost groaned. He did not sign up for this.
Sam got up, stalking over to Hill with his arms crossed. “You know something. Something you didn’t tell us.”
“Not even close,” Barnes chuckled as he raised his gun higher. “You know, I almost feel sorry I gotta do this. Almost.”
“Tony?”
Tony lifted his head. “Hey, J?”
Another sob croaked out of Tony. Was it really Steve? He sure as hell looked like Steve, he smelled like Steve. The gentle hold that surrounded Tony felt like Steve. He peered up through wet eyelashes, gazing up at the other man.
Steve’s mind supplied, remembering all the times Tony blabbed on about the accomplished woman.
Clint shrugged. “What can I say, I’m a hopeless romantic.”
he mused.
“It’s not that. It’s… did you know that aiding and abetting in a crime can sometimes be considered as serious of an offence as actually committing the crime?”
“Well, we need to find out if Hammer really is working with HYDRA. Get some of his men talking, and they might help us onto another lead,” answered Stark.
Steve bit his lip to stifle a laugh. “And you thought the Midwest was a bust.”
Steve, who had taken a seat behind his desk, reached for the gun that lay atop it, turning it to aim at Clint. The smile vanished instantly from Barton's face, the man quickly scrambling to take cover behind Bucky.
“You broke into… why did you,” Sam huffed, suddenly frustrated. “How?” he finally settled on.
“How peculiar.”
Tony jammed a few more buttons on his phone, pressing it up to his ear again. Not sure why he continued to bother; Steve obviously wasn’t going to be picking up anytime soon.
"Did you know that not even five months ago, an Army convey was ambushed in Afghanistan? There weren't any survivors. Autopsy shows that the bullets pulled from these soldiers belonged to Stark guns. My guns," Tony spat. "These guns, in the hands of terrorists being used on
“Here,” the man said quietly.
“So this report was filled out before I had my meeting with Stane, yes?”
Just a heads up!
"You can't do this," Loki whispered hoarsely.
A pleasant flutter passed through his chest, like a giddy school boy realizing that the teacher had chosen him to lead the class. It made him want to puff up his chest at Barnes as if to say '
Pierce furrowed his brow. “What could you possibly have on Steve Rogers?”
"And thank you, for making everything as difficult as possible," Tony snarked back, hanging up the phone before he could get another response.
“As much as I would love to stay, I have a feeling that I did, I’d never make it to the office.”
The woman thrust a badge into Tony’s face. “Government business,” she snapped.
Tony hissed under his breath.
Guilt washed over Steve. He hadn’t even remembered to call Pepper. How long had he been sitting there?
Before the explosion, JARVIS had been running tracers on devices that accessed the fake Joseph Grant information. Now back in the safety of his own home, Tony had managed to access the data and pull up two more potential HYDRA locations.
The Captain pulled out his gun. “That’s not the question she asked you.”
“Don’t,” Steve started, turning to face her. “I know what you’re gonna say. This wasn’t your fault.”
In the back of his mind, a voice was calling out to him. “
Clint gave her an empty stare. “The same thing that’s wrong with all of us, Nat. We’re broken.”
last time. I can’t do it again, I can’t! How long, Bucky? How long do I have to wait before it happens again? How long before I have to go home to someone’s family and tell them that they won’t be home for dinner? How many more graves will I have to dig? I have to be stronger,
Tony frowned. “Are you sure that- ”
That definitely wasn’t Sam.
Clint felt his lower lip tremble, watching as Phil paled even further. “Clint,” he whispered. “Who was in there?”
“Tony,” she greeted. “What was so important that I had to leave the office?”
“Steve isn’t just a floozy, and he isn’t Pepper. This isn’t just a check off your bucket list. I thought you were better than this.” With that, Natasha stalked off back to her room, leaving Tony alone again.
- Second, while I am trying to keep this story as canon as possible, there are just some things that I don't want happening. I want this story to be as real as possible (Which saying that, makes no sense, as I am writing a piece of fiction that was based off something that was already fiction, but who's counting). Like, a mob boss probably won't be running around with a shield as his only weapon. Steve and Bucky aren't actually supersoldiers (more on their buffness later). Bruce won't actually turn into a rage monster, yada yada. So, Tony running around in an armored suit didn't make much sense when everyone else has been kind of tailored to fit my story. What I'm aiming for eventually, are the hand gauntlets he had in CACW.
about Vienna.”
“Not well. I have to be back on base by Friday.”
So hatched their plan. Romanoff had leaked some rumors onto the street that The Captain had been the one behind the car bomb at SI as well as the dead scientists. The public, of course, ate it all up, always looking for the next big rivalry. Tony, in response, ‘leaked’ precious information on the internet. It took a lot of convincing of course; The Captain wasn’t too eager to release one of his rock solid aliases. But in the end, Joseph Grant was born. Tony faked a few police reports to falsify Grant into existence. Then, Tony hid the files within the web, not wanting all of New York to stumble on the information. Sure, Tony made sure to tell everyone that he leaked The Captain’s identity on the internet, but unfortunately for them, not everyone could get access to it.
"I can and I will," Pierce countered. "You've gotten too comfortable here. So comfortable that I see that you've forgotten who runs this town. You've been nothing but a thorn in our side for the better half of a year, giving us nothing and taking everything."
Sam wasn’t exactly sure when this picture
“Unfortunately, Sir, this is an actual consumer product.”
“Alright, gang, let’s blow this popsicle stand,” said Tony, walking – no,
“No,” Tony whimpered, his voice barely carrying over Steve’s hysteria.
The familiar click of heels hitting the floor echoed loudly through the hallway.
Tony thrived on being needed, on being wanted. It was his own sick and twisted version of love, a way of proving to himself that he wasn’t the worthless piece of scrap his father told him he was. He’s a moth drawn to the flame; his publicity the oxygen, his desirable skill set the dry heat that keeps the fire going.
“Oh my god,” he whispered, the ripped photo shaking in his hand.
Stark huffed, but Steve ignored it, moving over towards Clint and Bucky. Another pang of guilt swept through him; Steve had spent all that time trying to get Stark in the building, he had all but forgotten about Clint’s injury. Steve’s hands joined Bucky against Clint’s would, his blue eyes darting all over Clint’s face, taking in his friend’s pained state.
“What the hell was that?”
“Well I’ll be damned.”
“Well, at least we’ve got one thing in common,” Rhodes conceded, flopping into the chair next to Steve.
Bucky chuckled. “Ooh, you really must be worked up if you’re resulting to swearing.”
Bucky frowned. It was more sleep than he got yesterday. His body was finally acclimating to this hell hole, finally accepting his current situation.
Steve rolled his eyes. “How would I know? You said this was going to be easy!”
Steve couldn’t help but smile, thinking of Tony, forever loyal, defending his secret to the very end. “It’s alright, Tony,” Steve said, loud enough for Tony to pick him up over the other end of the call. “I need you to tell the rest of the team about the file drops.”
Finding his way back to Manhattan took a little more effort than he thought. After getting back on a main road, Tony found himself somewhere in the backwoods of Brooklyn. Of course, having lived in Manhattan all his life, he had no inclination of which direction he was going. This ended with Tony driving in circles and having to resort to ask some old broad for directions.
“Tony?”
Gentle hands flipped him on his back.
Tony shrugged. “Well not now, we’re kind of in crisis mode. But after? Yeah, I could swing it. I’m pretty sure you’re the only reason I’d even consider it.”
He drove wildly, ignoring the amount of traffic laws be broke in order to reach the office. The pain in his arm was getting worse, the adrenaline finally leaving his system. Tony’s hand twitched on the steering wheel, his eyes constantly checking behind him for a tail.
But now, watching as Steve returned from down the hall and slip an arm around Tony as he ushered him over to the couch, smiling gratefully as the brunette offered him a sip of his coffee, Sam couldn’t help but notice that a few of those holes had been filled.
Tony mocked. “Because he never shut up about you!”
“Get. Out.”
No, this whole thing didn't sit well with Tony. He was sure Obie would bring it up, the bastard was nothing if not persistant, but he wouldn't win this one. There's only been a few times that he'd have to put his foot down against Obie, but Tony was sure the other man would understand. He always did.
“Now, Ward. How in the world would an officer know a person, Tony Stark no less, was missing hours before the rest of the city got a single clue?”
But there was no one there.
“Well, that’s good, because I’ve got a pretty nasty rap sheet. I don’t think I’d much like the life I deserve.”
“And then he escaped.”
“Really.”
Yinsen nodded, already typing on the computer. A large boom came from the other side of the door, sending it caving in, furniture flying everywhere. Tony pushed Yinsen behind him, arms raised. Two armed guards stormed into the room, one prepped with another grenade.
Steve shook his head. “No, it’s fine. It’s understandable.”
“I’ll be alright, Nat,” he smiled. “You don’t need to worry about me.”
“I started a fire. Caught Phil’s attention, and he found me.”
Slipping down the stairs, he reached for the coffee stained mug he had stuck back under the machine last night. He reveled in the silence before taking a large swig. Instantly be found his lips curl in distaste. Tony knew that his industrial coffee machine – that’d he’d designed himself – could store months’ worth of coffee roast. He peaked down at his mug, taking in the rust brown water. It seemed that JARVIS had seemingly upped his game, resorting to watering down the morning cup-of-joe. Tony glared into his AI’s nearest camera but opted not to respond. He’d just be talking to himself, really.
It’s not safe, Obadiah is on his way over there right now! He’s probably already there!”
Clint gave him a blank look. “How does this help us?”
Clint walked up next to Thor and stared out into the night. “Growing up in the circus was hard. I never had too many things, but the one thing I always had was my brother. But stuff happened; he became someone I didn’t want him to be. But that doesn’t mean I don’t still miss him.”
“That brings up a problem, doesn’t it?” asked Tony.
“And what about the rest of us?” Sam asked quietly. “What if Fury throws the whole lot of us in prison?”
Steve whipped around, throwing the body against the wall, quickly covering it with his own.
“Just trying to make conversation,” Barnes replied, a small smirk adorning his face.
The dinner was quite, but that was hardly surprising, the team winding down after a long mission. A chirp from Tony’s tablet was enough to get the brunette’s attention, dragging him away from the team. Steve let him go with a small frown, only partially satisfied with the amount of food Tony managed to consume.
Pierce walked towards an unmarked van, approaching his workers. “Everything ready?”
Tony usually got away with tinkering in his lab at home, but Pepper wasn’t having it right now. Thus leading to the argument last night.
“I did find one. That’s the problem.”
He pushed past Bucky and towards the door, the walls suddenly constricting and silently judging. He barely had time to shout a quick “I’m going out,” before he was out the door and running down the stairs to the fresh air, away from the Bucky’s questions, away from Natasha’s eyes, away from everything.
working.”
blood, nothing more.”
had originally been Clint’s idea. The rest of them were skeptical of the whole thing; they were just like everyone else with a military face, acknowledging others that had it, giving them a wide berth, but otherwise resorting to licking their wounds in private, or better yet, pretending like they didn’t exist. The fact that Clint had even broached the subject was enough set off red flags.
“Could it be the files?” questioned Sam.
Clint huffed out a breath, stepping out of his left shoe. “I can’t believe you,” he muttered, before chucking the shoe at Tony’s face. “Breathe it in, Stark. That smell will get stuck on your clothes for days.”
All mistakes are my own.
“Pepper what are you saying?” asked Rhodey.
“Tony please…..just please listen….
They pulled apart and Steve slid the ring on Tony’s finger. He looked into Tony’s eye and found it reflecting his own happiness, a single tear slid down from Tony’s eyes and Steve wanted to chase it away so he he kissed it.
It’s been three days since he opened his eyes, three days of hospital hell and Tony wants to get out already.
“I don’t think I can hate anymore!” said Tony
There is a steady rhythm of beeps surrounding him, the room he is in is spacious but not too big and not too clustered, beside him is one more bed, Rhodey had recently abandoned it to sit beside tony and the wheelchair feels like it is trying to mock Tony,  he is currently eating his jello with the enthusiasm of a teen asked to sit through a family meeting, so all in all Tony would describe it as a platter of a  horrible situation with a side of irritation.
“Steve”
Tony and then he contacted me for emergency transport. I don’t know. Jim I really don’t know what to do.” Replied Pepper
“I…..I won’t let you go Tony, I won’t.”
“Hey underoos, its fine I am okay, I am fine”
Tony feels very tired, he wants to rest for the first time in his life he wants to rest, not do anything anymore, just maybe sleep for a little while , yeah that sounds good sleep, that sounds good.
Tony wants to move he wants to sock Steve in his perfect face but he still has a iv in and for the very first time in his life he doesn’t move cause of his child.
“It is going to be difficult Steve. The people with him aren’t your biggest fans right now, and the government is running their own show.” said Natasha
He feels for now he can anchor himself, he would take care of everything just to give his baby a chance.
So here he is doing what feels right.
“What”
He looked down he was wearing his white button down shirt and black slacks but he was barefoot,it was odd, what was he doing here? then he looked at Jarvis then really looked at him, he looked as he did all those years ago when Tony was two years old and Jarvis had carried him in his arms all day after tony had fell and scrapped his knee and refused to walk, much to his parents disapproval.
Tony has a bandage on his left palm, his skin is wrinkled as if it folded in itself. It stings a lot, he is also only six years old and doesn’t understand why his daddy was so angry.
He turn and sees Rhodey who has a tiny smile on his face and tears flowing from his eyes.
When he turned around there a tear rolling down Tony’s check, “You always loved him Tony, a love like that isn’t easily forgotten, but maybe you don’t have to forget it. When you truly love somebody you never stop Tony, nor do you truly let go, you get angry, you hurt but never let go.”
Next time Tony dreams he is with Maria at the beach and she is looking beautiful with her sun kissed face and her hair in the wind and a carefree smile on her face.
He knows what happened, he remembers the fight with his husband, remembers the wait, remember everything up until the moment his brain wanted to rest and his eyes complied.
He can’t meet Steve, not right now but he has to do it, he has to deal with the problem dropped in his lap again and that makes him want to laugh.
He looks at the his fingers and misses the glint of the ring on his finger.
“Focus Anthony, you know why you are here, you know what your mind has been thinking for the past week, you know why you wanted me here, just focus Anthony.” said Jarvis
“ I know, I have seen you rebuilding yourself since a young age, I always wondered if you would ever give up, you always surprised me when you always fought, got up and never give up. I told you Tony you were hell bent on surviving from the first day.
Pepper burst into the room.
“I see your ability to hold a grudge has not changed.” said Jarvis.
“Coming to me has always been an option, I may not be there but I also never left you Anthony.” said Jarvis
“I think there was a fight with someone important, someone I love. I think I lost.” said Tony.
“I Love you too Jarvis” said Tony
If rhodey had ever lost composure in his life it would be the exact moment he saw Steve Rogers barrel his shield towards his own mate. He had wanted to rip the doors off their hinges, kill Steve rogers and wake his best friend up.
Steve could feel bare hands clawing away at his chest in a desperate attempt to rip his heart out of his chest. He wanted to cry, he wanted to let the pain out of his chest, but little did he know that the pain had made home in his chest. Whenever he opened his mouth it felt as if air was only trying to make way to his lungs because his heart was completely in pieces and his brain could do nothing but gasp around the air.
It misses Steve by an inch.
“Dr. Wu, Dr. Helen Cho and his specialist Dr. Alex Jensen are all there and I will be able to manage his security better there.” replied Pepper
Jarvis then got up and walked towards the eggshell colored refrigerator that was kept on the opposite end of the kitchen. Ana had insisted on the color of the refrigerator said it a balance of color to the kitchen. he looked at all the pictures that were stuck on the fridge with magnets.
“Rebuilding” replied Jarvis.
“and you have to start on prenatal vitamins..
Steve was a bullhead, his husband knew the fact, had called him out on it, but at the end his husband was the one who was also paying a price for it.
This might be the only instant where he needs touch the most.
“He hates the beeping of the machines, it makes him wanna rip his hair out and both of us now about his passionate hate for hospitals. He would want to listen to music, he always calls music his solace, though he would hate me for playing Bach but if he wants to do something about it he better get up.” explained Rhodey
“But you will”
The kid deserves that but you need to……you need to leave now.
“Oh my dear boy I am not asking you to hold on to it but I guess all I am saying is you can love someone, care for them, forgive them and not want to meet them again and I think that’s okay.
If somehow DUM-E had managed to get into the wiring again he was going to dismantle and donate the bot to Starbucks where he could take orders from obnoxious customers all day long, no more fetch the wrench for him.
“I am sure Tony will comeback to us.” consoled Pepper
“Tony, I made a promise to you all those years ago when I slid that ring on your finger that I was going to stick with you thru thick and thin, you would always have a friend in me first  and I would always have your back, pick you up when you fall and walk thru life with your hand in my hand and show you how much I love you every day.”
“I don’t think I had the answer to that when you were fourteen year old , I don’t think I have the answer to it today.”
“The baby is fine Mr. Stark”
Tony lay silently on the bed.
“Tony……please, just…..please listen to me. I know..I know I am sorry..
The doctors have already informed that it is going to be tough, his reduced lung capacity, his recent surgery, all these years as ironman, his already weakened heart and his age everything is going to make his pregnancy very difficult but tony thinks he can do this, fight be there for his kid.
“Pep, I am …I am going to have a baby..Pep a tiny baby.”
My god Steve all these years and you still manage to knock the wind out of me. Oh! how I love you Steven Grant Rogers.”
“I don’t think that applies anymore.” replied Tony
In this instance Tony was realizing what those bandages across his chest really meant. This was the very moment when he realized what had happened in Siberia, what had happened between him and Steve. Captain America whom he had loved, looked up to his entire childhood and then when he had turned a new leaf started a new chapter in his life, a super soldier had all but crashed into his life. Tony had seen his admiration and hero worship towards Captain America turn into a bright burning love towards Steve Rogers.
“I don’t know! Oh my god! I don’t know Vision contacted me when he got an emergency signal from Friday. He contacted me around midnight that he was going to get
The next time he opens his eyes there is a ring kept oh his bedside with a note and a phone and he picks it up and tries to hold his tears back.
He dreams a lot these days. He goes from a dreamless state to a dream and then back to the dreamless state. He thinks he is floating in an abyss.
He thought of Steve, poor Steve who would be sitting cross legged in the dark trying to fix the wiring but not being able to understand neither  heads nor tails about it while placating an extremely apologetic DUM-E.
Tony didn’t know how to respond, words failed him and he felt parched. It was overwhelming to relive the moments he lived all those years ago, to still be Steve’s centre of attention to be very much in love with the man kneeling in front of him.
“Leave Steve, I can’t…I can’t do this right now.
“I think it is going to take a long time to get there, it will be a long road, but you will get there, I am sure of it. I wont tell you what to do, you always do what makes sense to you, but I will tell you this Tony forgive but don’t forget.”
He doesn’t ask pepper where it is, but he misses the comforting weight.
He looked around and realized he was standing in Jarvis’s kitchen, he had spent a lot of time here more so than he did in his own home.
"What happened Anthony? Asked Jarvis
Tony smiled.
As Steve was moving down the corridor looking for the room he knew tony would be in he saw Pepper standing in the middle of the hallway. His steps faltered and he came to an abrupt halt. Steve sometimes still felt uncoordinated in his too big body this was one of those moments.
Ste..
“ I don’t think so you can help me Steve, not…not anymore.”
Tony realized there were some memories at the back of his mind, knocking on some metaphorical door wanting, waiting to be let out. But Tony didn’t want to let these memories out he didn’t want to think about them. He was here with Jarvis he just wanted to stay here forever.
Tony dreams.
“Also, here you broke it, you handle it.”
She places a hand over his chest and places his hand on her chest
He thinks he is grieving, grieving his mother, his father, their relationship, his anger, all those years he hated Howard for taking away his mother from him, all those years spent in blind rage fury anger toward Howard, towards something that was not in his control, all the years spent in rage and fury, spent at the bottom of an alcohol bottle. Spent grieving the option that was taken away from him, grieving his happiness.
Jarvis laughed. He then turned his face toward tony and saw that four year old boy clutching his pant leg trying to hide his hurt after having his heartbroken for the very first time by his father.
Steve turned towards her sensing her presence “ I have to go Nat!”
“Tell me why was it so easy for you Steve? Tell me why did you do it? Why did you hurt me? Why? Tell me. Goddamit tell me.”
If anybody would ask him Rhodey would tell him that out of all the mission he went for, all the jobs he had undertaken he was most dedicated to the job of being the best friend of one idiot Anthony Edward Stark, not that he would ever describe it as a job, he would probably describe it as looking after looking after a adamant hyper-active child but he did it because he loved him, not that Tony would listen to him( Honeybear, you are getting sappy in your old age)
Honest opinions please!
“You need to leave.”
As he neared Tony’s room he could hear the steady beep inside, if he could focus enough he could also hear the sound of his shield hitting Tony’s arc reactor again and again.
“Jim… jim I am sorry, so sorry, but its Tony he…,he was…. Vision just brought Tony in from Siberia, he was rushed into emergency surgery he….he jim he was, oh my god! he looked horrible.” stammered Pepper
“I know I…..just…I……I….Tony …just..please give …..just please
“What can I say I am your dork.”
Loving Steve was like flowing with the current of a river and being loved by Steve was like touching the stars.
“So it was true, you really have the audacity to come here, Friday was not wrong.” remarked Pepper
Now 12 years later here they were here  with their house in New York and Steve with his art galleries and Tony with his multi billion dollar company still very much the same in love.
One day Ana was taking out a plate of cookies from the oven when Tony in all his 3 year old  glory has finally managed to climb the stool and had shrieked on the top of his lungs and Ana had dropped all the nice cookies on the floor.
“Today in the latest new as leaked pictures of Tony Stark in a comatose flood the internet, several questions are raised, what happened to the public favorite iron-man? Is this why there has been no words on the accords, on the state of the avengers, is this why Tony Stark has been away from the public eye? And most importantly what happened to the land New York city’s favorite omega in this state?”
“You can’t stay here forever, my child.” said Jarvis
He looked around the room and found another bed, he looked at Nat.
It takes him three days to find out where the rest of the avengers are, he sets up a call with King Panther and arranges for BARF with Steve to reach Wakanda.
Tony thinks maybe it is easy to love him and leave him, he always has been secondary , secondary to his parents, secondary to his lovers, secondary to his godfather and now secondary to his husband.
“I am going to shift to his room, he doesn’t leave my sight for a second, not even for a second after this.” said Rhodey.
I am so sorry.
“Match my breathing Steve”
He could do this.
Go Steve”
I honestly don't know how to feel.
They had been thru so much together, always been each other’s rock. Steve had been there when Tony’s parents had passed, when Stark Industry had gone under because of Obadiah Stane, had been there when Tony had pacemaker installed ih his heart. Tony had been there when Steve’s ma ha passed, when he had been a traumatizing plane crash, had been there when he had returned from the army, had been there when he opened his first art gallery, had been with him thru all those nights where his dreams got too overwhelming and he couldn’t go back to sleep.
“What's the other?” asked Tony.
“I am just reminding you that you always were strong Tony, you were like the sun always shining, you were always moving forward as if you personally despised giving up. Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong in wanting to stop once in a while, to rest. to want to restart, but you, you always wanted to go on, move forward just wanted to take anything make it better, live life and move on. You always were like a wind whirl nothing could stop you” said Jarvis
Once he had realized how fundamentally fucked up that was and that his father was the one who was not good enough he had taken those papers and lit them up with his father’s blowtorch.
Tony was lying on the bed, surrounded by the machine, beeping and making sounds, informing the passer-by that the person in the room was alive, breathing whether conscious or not but he was alive and breathing. He was able to breath own his own, small mercies.
“I won’t keep them away from you Steve
Did I hit my head. I definitely would have to hit my head hard if I am dreaming all of this, sitting here trying to talk to you.” replied Tony.
“Tony……tony it was not, it was not easy to hurt you, I didn’t wanna….I swear I….I”
She just takes his hand and puts a file in his hand “I won’t stop you Steve, you deserve to see your handiwork, he still hasn’t gotten up but before you see him read his file.” said Pepper.
Jarvis smiled it was nice to see some habits really didn’t go away easily.
“Then you come with me, but I don’t think that is what you want. Do you wish for all of this to stop , for your heart to stop hurting, for you to stop feeling drained all of them, yes you want all of that but I don’t think you want to stop.” said Jarvis
“I did a pretty shit job for it to be broken again like this.” replied Tony
Without waiting for a reply he continued, “ you were always resilient, always so persistent, nobody taught you that. For some time, when you were growing up I didn’t know what to do with you, you were always a bright eyed curious child, getting in all sorts of trouble since day one. I was always so scared for you, you would always fall down but then you would pick yourself up , without fail you would pick yourself up. I looked at you and realized you were a little bundle of trouble hell bent on surviving on sheer will and stubbornness.”
It’s a parade of doctors now each coming up to tell him what is wrong with him and what he needs to do and all he can think is about a certain super soldier is sitting outside, a secret that acts like a wall between them and a fight that destroyed them.
His head is on her shoulders now, she is holding him him and he feels like he is going to breakdown in her arms, her arms which has always been a safe place for Tony, a place he associates with warmth and love.”
Tony can see his bullhead of an husband standing there with determination with fight in his eyes, his whole body rigid, rooted in one spot, ready, ready to do anything, ready to not let go.
“You always were so strong Tony, even when your father mistreated you, when your mother failed to see your pain behind your innocent eyes you would always tell me that it all happened so that you could become better, as if you weren’t perfect the way you were born. I would often tell you that you didn’t need to be better, that you were my perfect little bajkeverő (Hungarian for trouble-maker).
He doesn’t stop loving him, he thinks maybe he will never stop loving him, he remembers when his love was all hot burning and needy, now he thinks his love comes with a side of pity and a whole lot of regret.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve grinned, he has always wanted to do that,  he wanted to give Tony everything in this world, Tony deserved the entire world.
As he neared Tony’s bed he felt like he shouldn’t be here, that he had done enough damage that he shouldn’t touch Tony again lest he burns.
“Rhodes, he is in PT right now.”
“You can’t do that alone, I mean you can but you shouldn’t. I should be there, I would…..i would help I mean….I mean you would need me and I…I could help you Tony..help you
He thanked whatever god would listen to him for Steve, he couldn’t remember what he had done so right in his life to be blessed with his marshmallow  of a husband but he loved him very much and everyday spent with him filled with him so much joy that Tony would do anything to keep Steve beside him forever.
Rhodey tells him he who mustn’t be named is still here and he tells him that he doesn’t care.
“My god that was corny” replied Tony.
It had been a disaster, Steve had judged Tony right of the bat and Tony didn’t help the case by being an asshole. He was dating Ty at the time but he had been enamored by Steve since day one, big strong Steve who would stand up to bullies and who would never back down from a fight and never cared for Tony’s status and always called him out on his dumbassery. When Tony had inevitably and very publicly broken up with Ty Steve had been his shoulder to cry on, he had placated him, picked him up, held Tony when he stumbled, listened to all his drunk ramblings and helped him glue all his pieces back.
Tony doesn’t know where that came from, he had never wanted kids but after bonding with Steve, he had felt as if it could be a possibility but in a very very far away future with Steve by his side. He…he doesn’t know..he…
The news hits Tony like a truck, he feels fucking blindsided.
“ Don’t come closer.”
Six month later on the  second of june they renewed their vows, both of them in the same suits they wore all those years ago. They renewed their vows in the backyard of their Malibu mansion with  Tony in his white suit and Steve in his black tuxedo, they renewed their vows in front of their friends turned family and promised to keep loving and cherishing each other for all eternity to come.
Tony got up and walked towards Jarvis , he hugged him as if his life depended on him, as if he was getting hugged after ages, as if he hugged him tightly enough he would make him stay forever.
“You are pregnant Mr. Stark. I thought you were listening to when I was explaining about the emergency surgery, your condition and what to expect in recovery.” explained the doctor.
Pepper was sitting on the stool beside Tony’s bed, She didn’t know when was the last time he had slept like this, what irked was that even when tony was unconscious lying on the hospital bed he didn’t look peaceful. She didn’t know if the ever present crescent shaped dark circle underlying his eyes were trying to tell her something or just spoke about the sorry state of their wearer. Tony’s lips were pale, they were never pale, he always had a pink hue to them, he would always be licking his lips, god forbid that man would ever get up and use a chapstick. Seeing the paleness of his lips, the dryness made her uneasy, it made her want to apply chapstick to those lips but she didn’t understand what it signified more her utter helplessness, helplessness of the entire situation or that tony still didn’t wanna get up.
“I don’t think I have the energy anymore J!”
Tony wonders how Steve does it, how he fights, doesn’t let go, he wants to know, how he jumps from one thing to another ,he wants to know the secret how is he standing in front of Tony all broken and bent but still ready to fight. His optimism it perplexes Tony’s brain.
“What happened Anthony?” asked Jarvis again
After the initial leak of Tony’s pictures no other information had been leaked, so public didn’t know about the fight of Siberia but majority of the world knew that half of the avengers were fugitives right now and the government was being suspiciously tight lipped about their fuck up.
Touch, yeah he thinks he can do touch right now.
“Yeah, we had a specialist with us, though my team would like to get in touch with Mr. Stark’s routine physician to be sure.” replied the doctor.
His laugh becomes louder and Tony thinks he is finally going crazy, that his brain has decided that it’s enough and has finally descended into hysteria.
Jarvis looked at Tony for a moment and said “cause you have been hurt again Tony.”
God! he was being pathetic.
“I don’t think I have the energy anymore”
“Well I can try. I think you know why you are here. You aren’t just trying hard enough to remember.” said Jarvis
Since being defrosted Steve had been for a lot of stealth missions for SHIELD and then as Avengers they had tackled a lot of missions so he knew his way around and since the compound was their home for a long time, he could walk into the building blindfolded and still reach his destination, it also helped that he was a super soldier. The irony of the situation was not lost on him, trying to enter his home as a fugitive, a place where him and tony had made their little family, had so many moments together.
“Why me Jarvis?” asked Tony
Tears were flowing freely from his eyes, Nat gripped his hair, he noticed she was standing , he pressed his face too her stomach and she gripped his face. Tears were still flowing from his face, his brain couldn’t comprehend what was happening.
“I think we should take a break, we can talk to him again later”
It irks Tony to see Steve standing there, his hair as golden as corn , curled on in himself trying to make himself small. He always occupies so much space, his whole demeanour  demanding attention and here he is standing trying to look so small, it is wrong and it bothers him
Pepper handed him her phone.
“Pre-natal vitamins Mr. Stark”
“No dear, look around you”. Jarvis replied.
“The baby is fine?” asked rhodey
He played Bach on her phone and placed it on the table near Tony’s bed.
The doctor had a solemn expression on his face.There was a painstaking silence in the room as if all the air had been sucked out of the room and for maybe just a minute everyone wanted to just stop, stop and just breathe only if they could draw a normal breath.
Somebody was here, no nobody would be here, he couldn’t face anybody , he did something bad, he…he
“You are going to be an uncle Rhodey bear.”
“Why are we discussing all of this here Jarvis?” asked Tony.
"Why are you saying all of this to me? asked Tony.
There is a weight at the back of his neck because for the life of him Steve can’t lift his head up and look at Tony can’t see the face that was always so full of emotions devoid of life. Tony always used to look at him with so much love, so much love that Steve’s heart would burst with happiness. But right now he can’t….can’t look at Tony.
“I’m afraid that I don’t remember. I’ll have the records checked, but if there is a way that I can contact you if I find them.” Tony trailed off when Roger’s held out a card. Taking it Tony noted how, bland, boring it looked.
“I found that file in your father’s mob files… The ones that he kept underneath the file room. I thought I would be wrong, but I searched the whole floor. I thought it wouldn’t hurt to go looking, and low and behold I find Barnes as the second name in all of those files.” Her hard stare wasn’t hard to miss. Tony felt his own muscles tense at what this meant.
“Steve?” the blonde in question turned around. Peter stood in the doorway of his office and it was rather obvious that he felt too awkward to walk in unannounced, unlike the rest of Steve’s crew.
Bucky went still. His relationship with his father wasn’t strained, that was true. Bucky hadn’t had it as bad as Steve did, his father stuck around. Bucky’s dad wasn’t a man of many emotions, but he didn’t get angry with Bucky often. He taught Bucky a lot of what he knew. How to fish, hunt, fight, even taught him to cook should the need arise. “No, he sure didn’t.” He answered, gulping down some of the bile that was starting to rise in his throat.
The point of waking up in the awful hours of the morning was so that Tony had an excuse to drink several cups of coffee before going to the office. But he had not had the chance to drink one drop of that precious liquid. Pepper was insistent that Tony attend meetings while she searched the archives for a Mr. Barnes. “If you want me to do this Tony you are going to have to do something in it for me. That’s why it’s called a deal.”
“I used to think that when I grew up that I would be a ballerina. Twirling around on stage and smile at the crowd when I was finished. My mom used to say that I was graceful on my feet and that I would surprise both her and papa when I would enter a room… After I was taken to the Red Room… That dream seemed so distant that I didn’t think that I would ever think it was an option ever again. Yet here I am with a man who promised me the world if I would just follow him.” Steve glanced at Natasha. It seemed that the heart to heart that she tended to just outright talk about was happening tonight.
Taking a seat in front of his holograms Tony flipped through of few of his specs before stopping on a few. He enlarged them, put them aside then pulled open more documents. Tony worked like this for a few minutes, soon enough getting up for the coffee machine that he’d built in the corner of the lab. He’d thank his genius brain for the idea and wondered for only a second why he’d thought not putting a coffee machine in the lab in the first place was a good idea. Taking a sip from the sweet nectar Tony patted the top of DUM-E’s claw as the bot slowly woke. The AI bot acknowledged his creator’s presence for only a second before shooting across the room and resuming his ministrations of how to operate the fire extinguisher. Tony shook his head at what he was sure was possessed by a child soul before returning to his desk.
“Si, lo hai fatto.”
His grip relaxed.
Once they pulled into the private garage of the tower Tony walked into the building with Loki not too far behind. What Tony saw next was surprising. In front of him, in his lobby, was Steve Rogers and James Barnes. The CEO had stopped in the doorway and had his hands behind his back. He sent a sign to Loki before walking in with a grin on his face. “Captain! I wasn’t expecting you.”
“Well isn’t that precious? Your parents must care so much for one another. What am I supposed to do for you? Tell you that you’re right, that I was foolish and return to the manor with apologies on my tongue even though I would mean none of it? No, Thor, I think that I would rather stay here and be these dolts punching bag.” Steve saw Bucky stiffen at the jab. “I will not go home. That frozen wasteland holds nothing for me. Here I have made a name for myself away from the shadow of Thor, away from the all-seeing eyes of our father.” That seemed to shake Thor slightly as he raised a hand to placate the man.
Walking back to his desk Tony glanced back at the girl. “Send him up. I have some time now before I leave.” She nodded, not at all questioning his dismissal of the other meetings. The girl promptly left the room with a click of heels and a flip of hair. Tony was sure that she was no older than 19. When did he start hiring his staff that young?
“No, they sure don’t.”
“Honeybear?”
“The Merchant,” Barnes spoke, Rogers turning to Rhodey and Pepper and aiming at them. Tony wanted to keep Rogers attention, keep him away from them.
They sat there, together, as they usually did after big changes such as this. Though Tony couldn’t remember this thick air that was around them, even when Tony had said that he’d discussed with the ‘guardians’ who had packed up and moved to the Bronx. That Peter Quill had given Tony a lot of business, even though Loki had been unsure about them too. Though Tony had put Logan on their tails for a bit to make sure they behaved.
It wasn’t until a day before Stark was found that Steve finally realized that it was Stane who held the reigns in the Merchants place. Not as terrifying, but still a man of power. There was a rumor of the position being opened for the Merchant’s place before Tony was back in Manhattan. Steve wondered how pissed the man would get if he told him right now.
They made several turns, and Tony was still 99% sure of where they were simply by the sounds alone. Nearly to the port. Warehouse district.
Tony nearly laughed loudly at the thought.
” The CEO hurried over to his computer, pulling up Loki’s tracking information from his phone. Loki was well away from 32nd but he was still going at a fast pace away from where he had cornered the two Irish mob members.
Tony shook his head, “I think you forget that I am my own best client. Suppose I was curious what it was like off American soil.” Steve narrowed his eyes but did well to keep his fists from clenching. When Tony had been announced to have been found Steve had thought that it was his perfect opportunity. Tony would be vulnerable, disoriented, not have time to contact anyone. He would have the upper hand and convince Tony that he had more power in Manhattan than Tony realized and make a truce to keep from the bloodshed. But instead what Steve found was a broken man… A broken man that had only been looking for a reason to fall off the edge.
Obie was the one to cut off the press conference, pushing Tony lightly away from the podium and handling the rest of the questions while Tony was guided away by Rhodey and Pepper. “Tones, are you okay?” Rhodey asked him while he settled Tony in a chair that was in a back room. Before Tony could reply the door opened, revealing both of the Irish mob members.
When Pepper starting going about the meeting prep he went back to the other screen.
Steve sighed. “Thor won’t let any of us touch him after Bucky tried breaking his nose.” Clint snorted but didn’t seem to have more to say until Bucky walked back into the room. His bloody knuckles were still wet from where he’d tried to wash off the blood but hadn’t been too successful. When the right hand walked in Loki seemed to flinch upon noticing him. Steve thought that at least Loki tried to avoid conflict with someone twice if he could help it.
“You shouldn’t lie Mr. Stark.”
The kid’s eyes were green.
“I’ll let the Captain know,” Clint stated, going for the paper again but Tony pulled it away. Both men stared at the Merchant of Death. He seemed to be staring at the paper for a long time before offering the paperback.
“Who’s after you?” Tony saw that Loki picked up speed suddenly. “Did you hijack a car?” The heavy breathing was his only answer. He could only assume that Loki’s phone was clutched in his fist and he was too paranoid to bring it up to his ear again. So instead Tony worked on opening up the streets for him. “If you can hear me, and are just ignoring me get here as soon as possible. The security will stem off whoever’s after you.”
Thor tucked back some of Loki’s hair back behind his ear. When Thor had brought in his brother he’d already been unconscious. Steve had been worried after the move that Thor was lost and they’d have to risk finding him, but the large man had found them. With his added-on package. “Ai, he was following us in the shadows just when we left. I thought it best that we face our foe head-on rather than run like dogs.” Thor brought his hand away and scowled. “I do not know how my brother came to this place, or how he became so close with the Merchant, but that is a better-suited question for when he wakes.” With that said Thor hefted Loki in the chair onto his shoulder. “Excuse me, Captain.”
Tony sighed. “I should just go to bed.” When he didn’t get a reply he noticed that Pepper had hung up on him.
“Mr. Stark-”
“Without talking to the Merchant?” Tony twirled around quickly and glared at Barnes. It was the first thing he’d said in this conversation, and Tony could tell that Roger’s hadn’t wanted to say anything about it. He had his face in one of his hands now.
“What happened, Laufeyson?”
Clint seemed to just stare at Steve for a minute before laying down a two of spades, Steve picked it up to place with his three and four of spades, he set down a Queen of hearts. “If we run into the Merchant again… Who’s to say that he won’t actually shoot you this time?” Steve shrugged.
So this story isn't dead my teachers just want to torcher me with a butt ton of homework.
Their hands released one another. “Care to give me a lift back to my place, Rogers? I’m sure that my family would like to know that I’m safe.” Tony moved towards the door with Steve. “I would also appreciate it if you gave me back my two other members alive, with us being a part of a truce.”
“That’s what Pepper was telling me. Even Rhodey was keeping tabs here to make sure nothing too drastic happened. I’m shocked that you guys held up my image well enough that people thought I was still around for a while.”
Tony simply grinned. “Might have run into a new mob in town. They don’t exactly understand territories but worry not, I haven’t shot a single er…” Tony grimaced, “Well I shot the ceiling, so I haven’t shot anyone.” There was a soft sigh from Bruce but it had the telltale signs of relief.
Everyone flinched when the Merchant fired a bullet up towards the ceiling. Steve heard the soft thud of a bullet hitting metal but didn’t flinch when the Merchant came closer towards him. “I don’t fear anything, Captain. I am as close as it comes to a god here.” Steve doubted that. No one was considered that, not for people like him and the Merchant. They were expendable when the time was right. When it was there time people didn’t hesitate to throw the old into the garbage and roll on with the new blood.
So sit back and do a little bit more waiting with me. I’m going to be rereading and making sure my brain is on track for the next chapter. I’ll talk with you all again soon.
“I make the best. No one else in the firearms industry can match up to what I can make. I get offers from the military left and right for the guns that I could provide them. I’m not that worried about my significance to the Merchant.” Both men seemed to stiffen up more at his statement. Tony wondered what they had been expecting. He could guess that they were hoping that Tony would become worried with his place in the family, as the supplier. But they didn’t know Manhattan like Tony did. They didn’t know who was the strongest.
“Queens?” Peter nodded. “Oscorp. Newman? Norman? Osboring is my usual name for him. So, grew up with that kind of shadow over the city. Must be nice getting away from that.” Peter walked further into the room then, closing the door behind him. Tony raised a brow but didn’t comment. “I’m not impressed at all by what he’s been doing over there. Biology experiments, test tube wannabe’s and not even offering to ask SI for anything to help.” Peter took a seat across from Tony. “I’m quite ashamed.”
That was when Steve finally intervened. “Drop it, Brock, or I promise I will drop you.” Rumlow glanced to his left, Natasha stood with her pistol at the ready right next to his temple. A small trickle of sweat fell down the man face before he dropped the gun and switched back on the safety.
It was hot. Really, hot. Tony didn’t think that it would get this hot out in a dessert so quickly. He wanted water so badly. His feet stumbled through the sand and Tony wanted to collapse. But he couldn’t. He had to keep going.
“What’s happened since I’ve been away? Rhodey didn’t have long to chat by the time I was available before the flight. Though he was mentioning that you might be trigger happy?” Bruce knew too well about Tony’s past, what he’d done for his position, how he got his name.
“Head back to base. I’ll inform security that you’ll be peeling in and you can join me in the lab. We’ll wait them out then go on the offensive once-”
There was a small pause.
“I see that your greetings are about as similar as my own. Though I thought that with your self-righteous act back in Brooklyn that you would have thrown all of those away.” The man, whose face Steve couldn’t see, was pointing to the guns that everyone was holding. “Old habits. I’ve heard that they die young.” The man practically growled the last bit as guns shot out from the goons’ coats, all trained back on Steve’s family. The man held nothing. Arrogant.
Tony stared at the contraption that was lodged in his chest, connected to the car battery. “What is this? What have you done to me?” Tony growled, his Merchant voice showing through his demeanor.
It seemed to hit a nerve. The Merchant spun on his heel and held out a small caliber gun towards Steve’s direction. “Won’t. I have no need to expand over into Brooklyn. I’m capable of taking the world out from under everyone from where I stand here.” The joking tone left, and Steve couldn’t feel the sharp edges of the grin nailing into him. “Howard broke it off with your little group long before Barnes died. Yet you still tried to go to him for help?” The Merchant turned the barrel towards the ceiling, sighing. “You don’t know the first thing about territories, do you?”
Through the front door.
Bucky’s hand clasped on Steve’s shoulder. “Don’t beat yourself up over this. Dad put you in charge for a reason. You and I both know that I wouldn’t have been all that much better.” It was true. Bucky didn’t have the leadership skill that Steve did when it came to the family. In the army, Bucky had been a snipper. He’d taken out enemies on his own, alone. He had a team, but that didn’t mean that he worked side by side with a lot of them. He stayed still. It was only because that he was at Steve’s side that had resulted in Bucky losing his left arm, brought him home for his father to try and patch him together. It was in the letter from Peggy that Steve learned that Bucky’s dad had named him the next leader of their family.
“Mr. Stark, I just wish to talk with you about getting some land. We don’t have to find the file. I just want a place where I can get settled here for business.” Tony blinked rapidly. He hadn’t said anything after… Where had that voice come from? “Are you listening?”
Peter’s eyes shifted to someone who’d entered the room. His eyes seemed trusting to whomever it was. Steve glanced himself and smiled at the red head. Natasha took a seat next to Steve and stared at Peter for a second. “Don’t sell out your life yet, Peter. We want to help you. Forget what you think you know about normal Mob’s. Our group, our family is different. We don’t sell drugs, or pilfer guns around. We stop things like that. Something that the Merchant can’t offer you, and something Osborn likely can’t offer in Queens.” She held out a hand to Peter with a shockingly kind smirk. “Give us a shot at least. I promise that we have your best interest at heart.”
The man seemed to sigh at Tony’s antics. “Captain Rogers.”
“Why can’t Obie go and talk with these guys? I thought he was supposed to take care of these types of things?” Pepper looked up at Tony then, her eyes sharp, reminding Tony of the reason that he picked her up in the first place. Those eyes and that sharp wit that could rival Tony’s own if he were to dare go up against the woman. She was terrifying in her own sort of way.
Opening up the file Tony glanced over what he was seeing. A rough man’s face greeted him on the first page. Height. Weight. Even a preferred killing method was mentioned in small letters. The title “dangerous” didn’t cross Tony’s mind till he read further on about some of the heists that the guy had run. Most of them were stationed out of Brooklyn. He recognized some of the addresses that were sometimes plastered over the newspapers. Read further he finally saw what he had been asked to look for. A hideout. He knew the building. Where it was located, and what was even stocked there.
“I’m serious.”
“Laufeyson is an informant for the Italian Mob.” Steve turned away from the view of Manhattan to look back at Natasha. Her fiery red hair was tame in the shadows of the warehouse. Her eyes seemed darker than they had been in Brooklyn, almost more paranoid. Steve wished that he knew how to help her feel more at ease, but there was a lot that he himself didn’t know how to handle. The Merchant knew their hideout, they were probably being watched even worse now, and he didn’t know the man real name… Just who his supplier was. Steve sighed, shrugging his shoulders as a means to allow her to be closer.
Thor rested his hand on Loki’s neck then, bringing the man face to angle towards him, but Loki’s eyes steered away. “Loki…”
Steve packed up his bag, throwing it over his shoulder quickly before following after Bucky. “I’ll talk with him. I sort of wouldn’t mind taking him in. He looks like a kid who might want a family for a change.”
Steve stacked up some of his papers into a neater pile. It would have to wait. “Peter, are you sure that it’s a good idea?” The young boy nodded, curling his fingers together and into small fists. It was as if Peter were trying to curl his fingers around the hem of the shirt but thought better of it. “Well… I uh… Peter, I’ll talk it over with Bucky and maybe we will see what we can do.” That seemed to be all that Peter really need because without a second thought Peter nodded and took off back out the door.
“The h$%^ I can’t!” Tony barked, standing abruptly. “Tell Hogan to get the car ready, I’ll be needed a ride home then I have a few things to handle before I go after I friend, Grant Roger’s.”

Gun shots were sounding from outside. Tony thought that he might be able to get them to a spot where there weren’t any gunmen, but that was starting to look like a fruitless endeavor the closer Tony got to an actual exit. “F#^*!” He growled through his teeth before looking around the warehouse more. There weren’t very many exits for him to choose from, and the longer they were there the closer Tony felt to having lung cancer at 35 in a few years.
There were soft curses from Loki’s side suddenly, and he could hear the rush of air as the man seemed to take off. “Loki?”
Natasha shrugged. “Perusing, trying to get a feel for the city. It’s dark here. Darker than most. It feels like home at times then I see families walk down the road without a feeling of dread coming over them. I do not understand what it is that the Merchant does here. He barely shows his face, apparently, and he threatens anyone he deems as a threat… Stark supplies him with cash, and weapons for the streets.” She sighed, bringing her knees up to her chest. “We act as if we are immortal here, but that was Brooklyn. Here… Here we are threatened by Cerberus and his owner Hades. They aren’t willing to give us admittance into Hell.”
“If you are looking for Howard you’ll find him buried next to his wife in the Graveyard on our private property. Though where that is I’d have to kill you myself once you were finished there. Only a few privileged get to go there.” Tony stood up then and wandered over.
Hope you guys enjoyed! Please comment and Kudo!
More noise. He didn’t understand what they were saying. Where was Yinsen?
Regardless Steve has a rag ready for the man after Bucky’s hand connected with his nose. Loki hadn’t exactly taken it but didn’t seem to complain when it meant that the blood would stop pooling into his mouth uncomfortably. The rag was now on the ground after Loki had thrown it at Thor, who had walked into walking intentionally towards the smaller man. Everyone was waiting for Thor to start wailing on the man for that alone, but Thor had simply put his hands on his hips and spoke down at Loki as if he were in trouble with a parent. Steve had to wonder what they must have been like as children when Thor acted this way. It was the calmest he had ever seen the man.
“Pepper, just tell me wh-”
“Cool it, Rumlow. The kid isn’t a threat to us or the family. Put your safety back on.” But the ex-militant didn’t so much and falter.
“Sure. Because I’m sure he wasn’t the one who told you my last name.” Tony cursed under his breath, glancing around before ushering them into his office quickly.
A smirk played over his face as he stood up. “Sorry, thought you were someone else. What can I do for you, sweetheart?” A blush covered the girls face as she stammered out about some meeting that he was undoubtedly late for. Tony didn’t really feel the need to attend any meetings today, so he planned very quickly to turn the girl away until she said…
Shortly after that, they ended the meeting, much to Tony’s pleasure. Walking out to his car Tony had never felt more relaxed. But soon enough his dream came back full force and the frown covered his face faster than a punch to his face. What could he possibly do to get rid of this feeling? “Feeling blue, Stark?” Tony jumped slightly before glaring at the man who sat in his convertible. Loki sipped on a latte, hair up, sunglasses down, and nails seemingly freshly done.
“Of course not. Tony, I said that if you took off tonight, made it to the base you would be back in time for the second meeting. I’ll schedule the next one for later that day, but do not be late.” He nodded, hoping that JARVIS was updating this onto his schedule without his say. Tony was too occupied with Loki’s message.
Steve’s eyes narrowed at the man, hand twitching at his side to move to the back of his pants. From the small bit of laughter, Steve had to assume that his movement hadn’t gone unnoticed. “So, touchy, Captain.”
“I thought it was because I’m your boss and since I sign your paycheck that you did what I asked.” Pepper gave him a look. Tony didn’t question her much further.
Steve stretched his shoulders, setting an arm back and around Peter’s shoulders. Feeling the other tense then relax eventually. “He said his name is Loki. He works for the Merchant of Death. We were hoping to get some information out of him, but Thor has forbidden us from using the usual ways.” Peter seemed to raise a brow at that.
