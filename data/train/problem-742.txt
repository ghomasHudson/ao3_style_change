John continued, “I was just wondering … well, we’ve been cooped up here for about a month and you don’t seem … I don’t know … you don’t appear to be … bored.”
Mycroft turned quickly on his heels. John grabbed his coat and followed him out into the night air. After being cooped up for a time, it actually felt good to step outside, even if it was a bit chilly. John sniffed in a large breath and blew it out. He’d had two days to plan what he would say to Mary when he saw her next and yet, as he got into the car, put on the ridiculous blindfold and waited to put his internal navigation system to the test, he was at a loss as to what the appropriate words were.
“You’ll see him soon enough, John,” Mycroft interrupted. John had given up long ago being surprised when either Holmes brother appeared to read his thoughts before he actually verbalized them. “For now, you’re going to stay at Baker Street under heavy guard so we can make sure the details of this Moriarty business are finalized this time. I’ll be in touch. In the meantime, try to get some rest.”
“Mycroft,” Sherlock clipped.
“John,” Mycroft greeted with his usual brand of arrogant detachment.
Sherlock’s brain felt like it just crashed into a brick wall. As if on autopilot, he interrupted, “After Magnusson. I was tested after the business with Magnusson.”
Sherlock could feel his own cock mercilessly throbbing inside its new home, and he wanted to go deeper. He had to go deeper. But he physically couldn’t. He was already pressed hard against John.
Sherlock made a quick trip to his mind palace where he proceeded to slap the sarcasm right out of Mycroft’s mouth (repeatedly). He then returned to his right mind and with clenched jaw and every bit of restraint he could muster, addressed his brother, “Will. You. Make. The. Appointment?”
John quickly lifted the weapon to his own head.
“Hello,” she answered tentatively.
Sherlock had wondered what the experience of kissing John Watson would feel like; afterall, the detective was never satisfied with just theory. He found that the texture and smooth motion of John’s lips on his own was quite a mind-startling sensation. Every surge of John’s mouth fed the addict in Sherlock and he found himself wanting more, in fact, craving more with each second that passed. But it wasn’t just the kiss itself that had Sherlock’s normally focused mind in a spin. What he hadn’t counted on was the effect that the emotion behind the kiss had on him. Kissing someone was physiological. Kissing someone you love and knowing they return that love, well … that’s something much more. As the kiss deepened, Sherlock noted everything from the purring sounds John’s throat was making and the feel of John’s jaws working Sherlock’s mouth open, to the unique and calming scent of, well … John. It was a maelstrom, pulling Sherlock deeper and deeper; yet, he felt no fear of drowning.
“You’re thinking,” Sherlock stated, his eyes narrowing a bit.
Sherlock felt as if he was going insane.
Rich, burgundy-painted walls and cushioned furniture throughout the room actually gave it a nice, warm feeling. A small, wooden table and two padded chairs were set up in the center of the room; Mary was currently occupying one of them. She lifted her head when he came in, a slight, anxious smile on her face. She was dressed casually and her hair had been dyed brunette. Her make-up was much different than the way she had worn it previously and John had to blink to make sure it was really her sitting there. He closed the door gently and approached the softly-lit setting.
“Sometimes I could just kick you,” John stage whispered. “You’re forty minutes late!”
Irene hummed appreciatively and Sherlock shot her a glare. Irene smirked, “Well, he certainly is dishy. I mean those eyes.”
Sherlock relaxed as he deduced where John was and what he was doing.
The younger man stopped and turned around, and the vulnerability that shown in his face … his eyes … confirmed it.
Because, the day after the banquet, Sherlock had made a decision. He knew he needed to have his hearing checked, if only to eliminate it as a possibility of what was causing these recent word mix-ups. However, he also knew that trying to obtain an appointment with a hearing specialist could take weeks, and patience wasn’t one of Sherlock’s strong suits. After an hour in his mind palace, another half hour of pacing, accompanied by an animated discussion with the Skull, Sherlock begrudgingly, and without John’s knowledge, contacted the only person he knew who had enough clout to make the appointment happen.
When the duo reached the registration table, John turned to Sherlock. “You know sometimes I could just kiss you,” he murmured.
Sherlock wrapped his lips around John’s thick shaft and began to gently suck the tip of it. Slowly, he swirled his tongue and John’s hips began to twitch slightly.
Sherlock practically barked Mycroft’s name before he heard the line go dead. He knew before he had even made the call that he would owe his brother for the favor, and he hated it, the feeling of being on Mycroft’s leash. But Sherlock had weighed the options and knew it was a small price to pay if it could help get this business with John cleared up. And that thought brought a sigh of relief from the detective. However, that relief was short-lived because two weeks later, the appointment turned out to be a disaster. …
“Oh my gosh,” whispered Mary. “It’s John Watson.” The woman’s face instantly fell ashen.
“So it is and he’s walking this way,” Irene gasped, her eyes still fixed on the subject distantly behind Sherlock.
“Shhh! Keep your voice down,” she hissed. “I just wanted to give them an opportunity to chat a bit.”
As they crossed the bedroom door’s threshold and stepped into Sherlock’s room, John could feel a lump developing in his throat. He’d thought about this moment … how it might happen … what he would do … what Sherlock would look like … but as in many of life’s situations, the reality proved to be much more anxiety-provoking than the wishful thinking had been. The giddiness of the previous few seconds was quickly replaced by nervousness and insecurity. But suddenly John felt Sherlock’s grasp tighten around his hand.
Forward … Sherlock pumped into John … and back.
“Brother mine,” Mycroft uttered as he answered his mobile.
“And that’s why I’m not bored,” Sherlock concluded with a shy shrug.
“Yes,” John conceded. “It just naturally happened as they were working on you. I swear. I didn’t mean to, it’s just—”
Sherlock was so irate that in addition to unleashing a wrath of less-than-complimentary deductions on the doctor, he also deduced one nurse to tears and another to almost punch him, not to mention a very red-faced receptionist to flee down the hallway in extreme embarrassment. Sherlock then stewed in the back of a cab, huffed 17 steps up to his flat, made some sort of growling noise as John greeted him, slammed the door to the loo and proceeded to take a very long, very hot shower.
John smirked and continued, “Yes.” He wasn’t going to offer additional information and let Sherlock off-the-hook that easily, especially since John knew the detective had most likely read the letter.
So, since the cab didn’t seem to be making much forward progress at the moment, Sherlock decided to take a trip to his mind palace. John’s wing had grown over the last few months, and as Sherlock reached up to a high shelf to bring down one of the items to study, he couldn’t help but notice that the shelves were almost bending with the weight of all of these unstudied items. Items such as—
“—want to touch your hair,” John finished his sentence as he stared at Sherlock.
John opened his mouth to try to speak but words failed him. Helplessly, he looked at his friend, who was staring back at him with wide, searching eyes. So, John did the only thing he could think to do. He stood up and hovered over the detective, slowly bringing his hand to brush Sherlock’s cheek. Then, he lowered his face within inches of his friend’s and whispered brokenly, “I’m so in love with you, Sherlock. I always have been and I always will be.”
Sherlock, loved him. John had hoped for this … dreamed of this … but didn’t have enough faith that he’d ever hear this. And truthfully, until this moment, he hadn’t realized how much he had
“Come inside me, Sherlock!”
“What? … Oh, you mean the one from Barts?” inquired John, not turning around, as he was elbow-deep in soap suds washing about four-days worth of dishes.
But, John’s face was one of bliss as he choked out, “Oh, yeah. That’s the spot.”
“Are you sure?” John asked softly.
“You assumed that solving crimes is the only way for me to alleviate boredom and keep my mind engaged,” Sherlock answered. “When in fact, over the last few years, I’ve discovered that life offers more than I had thought in terms of interesting situations. And, the human condition, to which I had become indifferent almost to the point of repulsion, actually provides fascinating scenarios and explanations for a myriad of physical, social and psychological behaviors.”
As Sherlock continued to deeply process through the items on the shelf, the detective was suddenly yanked from his mind palace by the cabbie’s voice threatening him if he didn’t leave the vehicle. How long he’d been sitting there, he couldn’t say. So, Sherlock paid the cabbie (with a sneer) then exited the cab, disappointed that his mental research had been interrupted. He then stood outside the front doors of the hotel, totally aware of his late arrival, wondering which John Watson would be greeting him upon his arrival—understanding friend; tipsy flatmate (John had mentioned something about an open bar at the event); or scolding Captain.
At the same time, John’s brain worked overtime to find a way out of this—a way that neither Mary nor Sherlock had to die. He screamed internally,
“Ohhh, Christ,” John gasped.
Sherlock’s head snapped upward, his lips parted and his eyes grew wide as he immediately realized that John was speaking to …
He picked up the glasses and made his way to the sitting room where Sherlock was already perched in his chair, reading a book on apiaries. John handed him one of the glasses and took his own comfy seat as a fire popped in the grate nearby.
Sherlock began to pace again wondering if it would be prudent to just sneak himself out the bedroom window, down the fire escape and make a run for it, trying to avoid the tedious night ahead. But he was pretty sure with the recent snow that the fire escape would be hazardous, not to mention, his footprints would be traced. Still, he contemplated his options.
“Anything, John,” Sherlock breathlessly answered. “Anything.”
, John thought. He gave her a quick, assuring smile, although he was feeling anything but confident at that moment.
At that moment, John turned and caught his eye; the look on his face was one of slight confusion as he stared at the detective. Then John’s facial expression turned to one of understanding as he mouthed silently, “I love you.”
John silently stared at him for a moment with empathic, tear-filled eyes, then whispered,
“They’re safe Dr. Watson,” the man replied. He then yelled “Everyone down!” as he and John broke free from the building’s confines and John found himself hurled behind a police car. A few moments later, an explosion rocked the warehouse.
Sherlock stood stunned and ruminated awhile about that.
John’s hands stilled, too, once they finished petting the soft curls at the back of Sherlock’s neck. His lips broke from Sherlock’s, but softly planted a new trail of kisses at the corner of the detective’s swollen mouth, his jawline, and down his neck. With every kiss, Sherlock’s hands clenched John’s jumper a little tighter and his breath caught until John’s route ended at the collarbone, at which point Sherlock began releasing progressively louder moans that only spurred John on further. John’s mouth gently sucked Sherlock’s skin, making wet, popping noises as it painted a small, purple masterpiece onto the pale, white canvass.
, clamped John’s hand and lifted it near the side of his head. John’s eyes shot wide open to see the predatory expression on Sherlock’s face. The detective had turned the tables momentarily and was on the hunt. The thought of being Sherlock’s prey was intensely stimulating, motivating John to retaliate. Before Sherlock could grasp John’s cock with his other hand, John boldly grabbed Sherlock’s free hand and lifted it along with his own hand up toward the top of the bed, so now both of John’s hands and both of Sherlock’s were grasped together tightly, fingers entwined on the pillow. Totally encaged by limbs, John silently looked at his lover with dark, determined eyes.
“JOHN, NOOOOOO!” Sherlock wailed.
A sudden knock at the door brought him out of his intense reflection as he heard John’s voice calling, “Sherlock? Are you about done in there? I’m starving and I want to order dinner.”
It was like puzzle pieces slotting into place and Sherlock’s thoughts formed more rapidly now as he began to pace back and forth in front of John.
John pursed his lips in a tight and understanding smile. “I know. Me too.”
John had grown sick of subtext and this time was determined to find out what Sherlock meant. He set his glass down on the side table and leaned forward in his chair, legs now brushing very near to his friend’s. He reached out his left arm and placed his hand, palm-side up, on his knee, very slowly, not at all in time with the rapidity of his present heart rate. He had a moment of panic when he thought he may have read the situation incorrectly. But that moment evaporated when all of a sudden, Sherlock’s right hand slipped tentatively on top of John’s, and at the touch, the two instinctively connected in a gentle grasp. They each stared at each other trying to take in this new situation, reveling in the warmth of the touch. John instinctively began rubbing his thumb over Sherlock’s hand and the younger man visibly relaxed as the corners of his mouth raised slightly. John wasn’t so subtle as a genuine grin appeared on his face. He reached out with his other hand and Sherlock quickly grabbed that one too.
“Nice to meet you,” Mary replied, and Sherlock couldn’t resist.
The two men sat in silence for several moments; the only sound in the room was the intermittent popping of embers from the fire. Then, Sherlock turned his head to look at John and his voice broke softly through the silence.
“Ah finally, words! I was getting worried,” Moriarty teased. “Dear, John, do you really think death can stop me? “
“Sherlock,” he gasped.
In shock, Mary turned and gaped at Sherlock.
“As well as can be expected,” she replied. John frowned with concern and began to open his mouth to speak when she interjected, “No, John. It’s ok. I’ve had good accommodations. I’ve been treated well.” John’s brow unfurled and he settled back a little. Mary continued, “I told them what they needed to know. And that’s the end of it. Moriarty is dead. His minions are taken care of. He can’t hurt you, or me or anyone else, anymore.”
“I’ll wait for you outside,” Mycroft spoke to John over his shoulder as he strode out of the room. It was more of a command than a statement. John rose from his chair as did Mary and the two of them hugged each other one last time.
John placed a soft kiss onto his best friend’s lips, awakening every dream that had long been buried. As the kiss deepened, Sherlock guided John into his lap, the two of them stroking each other’s shoulders, chests and every bit of skin they could find. Eventually, they reluctantly broke away, panting into each other’s mouths, trying to catch their breaths.
All of a sudden, he heard the door downstairs open and footsteps on the stairs. John’s heart pounded with nervousness and anticipation. He quickly turned around hoping to see Sherlock, but was disappointed as Mycroft stepped into the room.
“She’s been raised well, John.”
“Sherlock,” John mumbled between kisses.
Sherlock stared at John, whose face had gone somber.
“Hello,” he said with a genuine smile as he took the seat opposite hers.
need her fathers."
In addition, after some pretty solid shared deductions, the people with whom he co-habitated the dormitory had pretty much come to the conclusion that Sherlock was to be left alone, much to his relief. He’d rather be ignored than bullied. Afterall, the ignoring was mutual.
“Ten minutes,” he stated, and then proceeded to walk back down the corridor.
The young man countered haughtily, “What? Why should I—“
He had agonized for weeks over the discovery as Sherlock lay in hospital recovering from the bullet wound that John’s wife had created. Guilt. Anger. Sadness. The emotions had surfaced and resurfaced inside of John on several occasions since then, but each time there was some “reason” he justified to continue burying them. However, this time emotion overpowered reason.
He then turned his focus to the figure immediately to her left. This person was in the exact same predicament. But unlike Mary, this person’s head was bowed. The intermittent light was of no use as the figure kneeled within one of the many shadowy areas of the floor. Suddenly the figure lifted its head and John was able to make out sharp cheekbones and a familiar face. He felt as if his heart had stopped beating.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes,” Sherlock distractedly replied as his thumb swiftly tapped the mobile’s keys.
Two weeks after the incident on the roof …
“So, you can see why I’m having such a tough time making a decision, can’t you?” Moriarty interrupted the stare down.
“Close … Sherlock, close!”
“Oh,” said John, feeling relief and joy at the same time. “I see. Good. That's good. Uh, well, if we’re both clean, then it means that … you know … we wouldn’t have to use a condom. I mean, that’s if you don’t want to. But I want you to feel comfortable, so—”
“She’s so far away.”
“Lestrade,” Sherlock answered as he began to punch out a text.
“Sherlock?” John quietly asked, watching as the detective blinked a few times and brought himself out of whatever room of his Mind Palace in which he had lost himself.
This chapter contains case and canon-typical violence, including John hanging for dear life off the roof of a building. If this is a trigger for you, please skip this chapter.
By this time John had turned to meet his gaze and looked at Sherlock with a quizzical brow.
It was these moments that John allowed himself to admire the beauty of the man sitting across from him. Yes, John had admitted to himself awhile ago that Sherlock was physically attractive, but it was his friends’ inner beauty that John loved—Sherlock’s loyalty, the care he gave to others, his protective nature, his irritation with mediocrity, his passion for science—John loved the whole package. In fact, he had come to terms about a year ago that he was “in love” with Sherlock. But he knew the detective was married to his Work, and that the Work was important. And, John had decided he wasn’t going to be the one to break up that perfect marriage.
So as the trees began to turn beautiful shades of yellow and red and a cooler nip filled the air, Sherlock was settling down into a comfortable routine. His classes still bored him to tears, but as long as he could perform his experiments, he was somewhat satisfied, or at least, less agitated. He should have know the feeling wouldn’t last.
“Hmmm,” the younger man sighed.
Sherlock removed his mouth and took in the sight of John writhing on the bed, hands grasping at the duvet, eyes closed. Sherlock stopped prodding, gave himself a final stroke with his lubed hand, and positioned himself to enter John. He paused momentarily to look at his friend, his lover. He wanted John with every fiber of his being.
The vehicle itself caught Sherlock’s attention as he turned his head and watched whoever the poor fool was who thought he could drive through campus at that time. But, it wasn’t the vehicle itself that then managed to hold his attention. No. What intrigued Sherlock was the muscular arm that was leaning on the open window frame of the car. Because of the angle where he sat, Sherlock could see only the driver’s arm but no other part of the driver.
His chest heaved in pain and his breathing became more labored. He clutched John’s upper arms and choked on the words, as tears began streaming down his face. His body shook as his discourse continued and he looked with agony into John’s face.
As he stepped inside and surveyed the empty room and adjoining kitchen, a flood of memories hit him like an icy downpour. His eyes lit on the dining table and he remembered all of the late-night discussions that had taken place there along with all of the chemicals and other “necessary” experiments that had graced its surface. His gaze traveled along the counter top as he thought about the dinners that had been cheerfully prepared together, but even more, he thought about all of the takeaway cartons and the “stealing” or “sharing” of food that occurred (depending on how one looked at it).
“Oh, no fair. You peeked,” quipped Moriarty. “No matter. I really can’t wait for you to see the rest of your surprise.”
“So impatient,” Moriarty chided. “You see, I need you to do me a favor. I have a decision to make and I’m having a bit of trouble. So I thought a military man such as yourself would be able to do it for me, you know, since you have to make split-second decisions during wartime.”
this. He loved Sherlock so much, but suddenly telling Sherlock “I love you”againdidn’t seem like enough. He wanted to help Sherlock delete every cruelty that had ever caused him pain. He knew why Sherlock’s behavior was arrogant, distant and sometimes destructive. It wasn’t because he didn’t feel things. It’s because he felt things more intensely than others did … love, happiness, pain and rejection. Sherlock felt them all at the core of his being. Sherlock needed to know that John’s feelings went beyond love to respect and acceptance. He deserved to know that he was worthy of everything because he
comfortable, yeah?”
John continued, “Well, it’s just that … I was tested after Mary and I separated, and I’m clean. And, I was just wondering if you’ve been tested lately. … um, because if so, then, well, I was wondering—”
“Look, Sherlock, we can wait—” John started to pull away, but then stopped as he watched Sherlock do something he’d never seen the man do before when faced with a case.
In his entire life, Sherlock had never been so thankful to be sitting down, because if he would have been standing at that moment he’s pretty sure his legs would have failed him.
Not the working from home.
“John,” Sherlock interrupted as a smirk began to form. He leaned in a little toward the other man’s face and whispered, “It’s all fine.”
Knowing it was useless to feign ignorance, John stared back, biting his lower lip. “Yes,” he replied.
"John. Seriously?"
“It’s nothing,” Sherlock sighed sadly as he slowly pushed himself up off the surface of the roof. But before he could turn completely toward the stairwell, John’s hand grabbed Sherlock’s forearm, and Sherlock was forced to face his flatmate.
“And what is that?” John asked curiously.
Sherlock cringed internally hoping Irene would buy it.
Their white-knuckled hands gripped each other as they hung on for dear life.
John slowly pulled his hand away and looked at Sherlock with an indecipherable gaze. “I think you raked your head.”
“John,” Mycroft acknowledged blandly, brushing his suit jacket with his hands and attempting to remain dignified. “They’re both safe. Mary’s been taken somewhere where she can be questioned properly about her connection with Moriarty. And Sherlock, well, let’s just say he’s been taken somewhere where I can keep an eye on him for the moment.”
said Sherlock, feeling relief that he didn’t have to actually say it, and yet aware of a sudden phantom dryness in his mouth, as if he had.
,” he begged. “Please, Sherlock. For me.”
“What do
Val, the GP, chimed in, “Well, if you believe his blog, the two of them are practically married.”
The rosy pink of John’s flushed cheeks began to deepen into a fiery red and his lips parted to unleash a linguistic fury.
Sherlock's eyes grew as wide as saucers, “Wha- what?”
“Neither am I.”
John felt like he was having an out-of-body experience, hardly believing that the beautiful sentiment coming out of Sherlock’s mouth was directed at him.
“You saw. At hospital. When Ma-” Sherlock cleared his throat. “… when I was shot,” he continued.
Sherlock snarled. He could practically feel Mycroft’s smugness oozing out of the phone. “Yes. I need you to secure an appointment for me to meet with a hearing specialist as soon as possible.”
“I want to go deeper,” Sherlock panted.
“But, Sherlock, it’s just that …”
“Sherlock.”
John smirked, “Ready when you are.”
John inquired calmly.
John suddenly forgot about his own nervousness and only wished to quell Sherlock’s. He reached up, and placed his free hand on his partner’s cheek, giving Sherlock a confident, tight-lipped smile. Sherlock’s shoulders visibly released and he pulled John’s waist forward so that the two of them were chest to chest.
“Why don’t you ask Dr. Watson?” scoffed Mycroft. “He probably has connections in the medical field that far surpass mine.”
“Hey,” John whispered. “You, okay?”
It had been four weeks since he and Sherlock and Rosie had started self-isolating due to the pandemic. John had been working as part of a telehealth network and was able to work from home, conducting online consultation, providing diagnosis, referring patients and prescribing medication. Mrs. Hudson, relieved that John could work from the safety of his own home, had allowed him to set up a rudimentary office in 221C. So depending on his shift, he “went to work” leaving Rosie and Sherlock to conduct experiments, prepare culinary “delights,” and experience adventure. John never knew what he’d find when he finished work and walked back upstairs into the flat. One time it was a castle made of blankets. Another time it was a pirate ship in their sitting room (which looked very much like their sofa). Evenings, when John wasn’t on-call, were full of conversation, films and board games (even a lively, follow-the-rules version of Cluedo). Then, after Rosie went to bed, those same evenings took a quiet turn as two men sat comfortably in front of the fire, sometimes reading, sometimes talking and sometimes enjoying the soft strains of a violin.
Of course, in Sherlock’s mind if that was the criteria for a Christmas party then his own invitation list would include only John and Mrs. Hudson. (And if the truth be told, the latter was even an uncertainty.) It most certainly wouldn’t include the gaggle of people who were currently tromping up the steps and filling 221B with all the noise, noise, noise. He could hear Molly’s squeals and Lestrade’s gravelly timbre, and then he thought he heard two voices that made him stop his pacing.
questioned John.
“You knew,” Sherlock stated as he stared at John.
Sherlock uncharacteristically stammered.
Unfortunately, John was on the losing end of a roof-top battle, but rather than tell the loud-mouthed thugs where Sherlock was, he decided to take the beating. He was then pushed off the side of the roof and left to hang there by his pair of accosters, who decided they didn’t have time to watch the inevitable, and attempted to leave the rooftop by way of the main stairwell. Now, John hung, dangling off the side of the building, wind blowing his jacket and gently contorting his body like a discarded Union Jack. He struggled to keep ahold of the roof’s edge but his strength was dwindling.
The doctor sipped his coffee and sighed. "I'd better keep one for him. He hasn't had a drink since we left this morning."
"I don't want to leave. I like it here."
“It looks pretty.” Siger glanced at Mrs. Hudson. “And ladies like them.”
That earned Mycroft two more strikes of the cane.
Before he was fully under Sherlock began to fight again, shifting and bucking as much as the restraints would allow.
"You won't be able to do this forever and it's not what John wants."
"Stay," Greg ordered sharply, turning to help John who had begun to untie the detective.
Irene shrugged. "Do I look like I care?"
That made Eurus look over. She slapped him, hard across the cheek with the back of her hand.
“Yes, sir.” Sherlock was slightly more wary now.
“He’s the Dom my brother obviously hasn’t spoken about. The one from Oxford.”
Mycroft swung him around and pressed their mouths together in a kiss.
"No!" Mycroft yelled.
"You let Irene do this to us, what did you think she would be doing?" Sherlock grumbled.
"Yes, sir."
“Sherlock?” John asked, crouching down beside him he held the back of his hands to Sherlock’s forehead. “You’re not hot. What is it?”
He jumped to his feet with ease and took a few paces back. He paused, listening for sounds of the Dom again. Content that there weren’t any, he took a run at the door and just as he reached the threshold he jumped.
“John, think!”
John reached between the cushions and grasped the vibrator, upping the setting and enjoying the look of shock on Greg's face.
"Thank you." The Dominatrix looked over her shoulder at the object of her desires. "Maybe Mycroft will let us get on with things." She turned to look at the youngest Holmes. "Do you have Tiger Balm on this island?"
Greg walked around Sherlock several times. "I suppose your proud of yourself, upsetting John. That's what you enjoy, getting a rise out of people. Sally, Anderson, John."
"Finn," the detective began, "how would you feel about having a little sister?"
"We'll give them some time, pet," Greg said, noting how Mycroft still looked worried. "If things stay too quiet for too long, we'll check on them. Promise."
"Wrong." John said bumping shoulders with his sub. "Let's call a time out. You can say anything you need to right now without fear of reprisal."
"Nothing. Nothing at all. I just expect you to get angry and upset."
So Sherlock has already attempted to leg it, practically naked. What happened next?
John shook his head and went to get the fucking machine, laughing the whole way.
"John, I mean, sir," the detective said, bowing his head.
Just as Sherlock was about to leap off the bed, John tackled him and kissed him.
"Things are ok. For now. But I don't trust him to not cock this up. He's been on a last warning before."
"That man is impossible!" she complained balling her right hand into a fist.
Greg gave a grunt of surprise. "I thought you weren't going to do that kind of thing with him for a while."
The detective knee walked over to Irene with the dildo still in his mouth.
Eventually, Finn crept out from under the bed on the far side. He peeked over the mattress at the back of John's head. "You pwomise you're not mad?"
John snorted softly. "I don't recall giving you permission to speak."
"It's what my nephew wants to play. Besides, I doubt very much that he's learned the concept of money, let alone the maths required for the game." Mycroft winked at Finn. "Besides, you have to decide what you and John want before I can do anything."
Sherlock was acting like a thoroughly rebuked child as John led him to the fish and chip stand. He even kicked at the sand along the way. His Dom smiled and gave his hand a squeeze, still feeling a bit charmed by him and his recent behaviour.
Sherlock obeyed, sucking air in around his Dom's prick before John thrust in completely.
The detective accepted the bacon, his eyes cast down to the floor.
Sherlock crouched down beside Finn, “stay with John.”
"I thought I was going to need to split that up like I did those first few days," John said, running his hand over Sherlock's red and warm arse. He helped Sherlock back so he was sat on his knees beside the sofa. "I suppose you have had those lines to keep you busy. Have you learnt your lesson, do you think?" He asked, jerking his head at where the notepad was on the floor.
The Superintendent staggered dramatically back. "Oh my god, he apologised without any threats."
"Hey!" Sherlock complained.
"You can be such a brat."
John nodded. “He’s a clever kid. Given his... upbringing. I’m assuming you went to Eton?”
“You'll stay upright, boy. I want you focused on pleasing me, nothing else.” He pushed his head away and watched with amusement as his boy straightened himself back up again.
“But I’m good as much as he is bad.”
As Mycroft got to his feet, his cock bobbed, jostling the pegs about. He moved awkwardly, keeping his legs well spread.
He made sure he had the surveillance equipment up there set up in his room so he didn't have to worry.
“Thank you, sir,” Sherlock said quietly.
The doctor was rather proud of the other Dom. Suspension bondage was difficult to master. "Excellent work, Greg," John slapped him on the back. "You've been studying hard."
"John, look!" Sherlock came running up the wet sand, his hands cupped in front of him.
"He'll wake up in brat mode anyway, it's Sherlock."
“Shall we let them go through to the sitting room on their own?” John offered. “I'm sure Sherlock is bored already.”
They'd spent a whole hour in the next room discussing things, plans and strategies, without him really paying attention to anything that was said.
“Well, I know his tendency for boredom first hand.”
His eyes opened at that and he glanced at John. "Sir?"
John smiled, feeling rather satisfied with himself, but more importantly proud of Sherlock. He reached over and took Greg's hand leaving the brothers together for a moment.
“Not yet.”
"Respect, pet," Greg said, slapping his boy on the thigh.
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut in annoyance. He wanted to move completely, but knew it wasn’t worth arguing. If he did, John would just leave him tied there and after an unknown amount of time John would just ask again until he submitted.
Greg sighed. "Well, bollocks."
When every drop had been delivered, the Dom removed the nozzle and replaced it with a plug. "We'll just give that time to get your full attention, then see if you feel like behaving."
"Do I have your attention now?"
“Brave man.”
After nearly a full minute, Irene nodded.
Sherlock ducked his head - all he wanted to do was phone Lestrade, why was John making this so difficult? “I’m sorry, sir.”
John half wondered if the detective would pause to grab some clothes. He smirked when he reached the kitchen and found him still naked. Naked and kneeling. The Dom sat in the chair nearest his kneeling boy. "Can I get a waffle with chocolate sauce for Sherlock? He actually deserves it for once."
John eyed him curiously. “What?”
Sherlock smiled up at him at that, the redness to his cheeks finally fading away. John ran his hand over his face again, cupping his chin.
John... where was he? Was this some sort of test? A test he knew if he was left much longer he would fail.
Early update!!
Sherlock's head snapped towards his Dom.
"I shall plug you up then," he replied, removing his fingers.
Irene spoke next. "Let's keep him that way. Unchain his collar and place him on his side. We don't want to risk a blocked airway."
“Why are they walking from that direction, when a moment ago they were coming from the other side?”
“Ok, then. Over the last few months, I have been a miserable man. I was nothing, and anyone could see it. You’ve helped me find myself, and make a newer, better version of me. Sherlock Holmes, will you marry me?” John was shaking, more from nerves than cold, but Sherlock grabbed his hands and hauled him back to his feet.
Miserable, Sherlock threw his phone at the chair by his wardrobe, then tossed himself into the pillows and throws littering his bed. They smelled of John, and he began raking them around his head and shoulders, desperate for just that small comfort. His knees were pulling up, his feet brushing against one another, and for the second time he found himself sobbing into his bed over the doctor he was unlikely to have.
With Harry and Clara boarding, John had turned to go back through the airport to get a cab, standing alone on the stretch of pavement outside and raising his hand to hail one. One sped past him, already occupied, and that’s when he saw him again.
“Yes, sorry. I don’t…” John managed to get out, throwing a questioning look between the two substantially younger men seated across from him. He forced down the constriction that almost surfaced in his posture, but couldn’t quite keep it from his face. If he’d let himself think about it, he’d have known it was giving something away to the very observant one of the pair.
“Sherlock, this really isn’t the time to be showing off. Just give him the memory stick. Please.” Victor. From where John was, however, he couldn’t see the other man or determine whose side he was on. No tactical advantage to that, and John had already eased him almost to the floor, letting the counter block his entrance from view.
Trying the back door, he found it unlocked, and his hand was already circling the gun to gently draw it out of the pocket. A thumb flipped the safety off, and he didn’t extend his arm all the way as he pushed the door open just enough to gain access to the stockroom. Letting his eyes adjust to the dim interior, he didn’t move further inside, and he was listening.
Upon reemerging from the back, the owner has one final set to place between Mike, this one much more ornate than the others. “Recroy by Royal Limoges. Recamier shape with gold incrusted design, cobalt blue and hand painted relief gold adornment.“ Mike looks taken aback by all the bands of gold alternating with the single stripe of bone china white and two of nearly midnight blue, but the shop owner has one last thing to add before he gives Mike time to consider.
Saving the entry, he left it at that, knowing that to type out his thoughts and impressions of his new flatmate would be to court disaster. In his own mind though, he was cognizant of what would have been written: Intelligent. Cautious. Sensitive. Angelic, and at that, he forced his brain to shut down, clicking the X to close the browser window.
Not making a sound, John continued to watch and wait, concerned if he went off too hastily that Sherlock would be injured. The leader of the Americans, for John knew the accents for what they were, made a gesture to his partner. The second ran forward, the tables of assorted tea things keeping him from seeing where John rested. He checked the front door, and shook his head to the leader. Unfortunately for John, they weren’t separate for long, because the second American hastened to return to the leader so that there was once again two pairs squared off.
The latter is now restating his question, something about his air making it plain he hates to repeat himself, but he lowers his voice so it doesn’t carry quite so far and there is softness now about the look he’s giving John. “Afghanistan or Iraq?” The words have a punch of space between them that they lacked before, but that expression in his eyes isn’t pity. Mike hasn’t offered anything by way of clarifying, looking at the color choices that owner also provided examples of on a factory sheet, so that John is beginning to feel like a beetle pinned to a board.
“It’s you,” said the vision. His eyebrow lifted on one side, his lips taking only a second longer to do the same.
Sherlock didn’t say what he thought, and John lifted his chin an increment higher, focus pinging from each of Sherlock’s facial features to the way his hands fidgeted, and the obviously troubled tension keeping his shoulders taunt. Once he’d gathered what he needed, John continued his explanation. “Bills to pay, and well…a man needs a profession. Or, I do at any rate. Can’t just loiter around here, all day, every day.” Left shoulder raising into a shrug, he tried to probe a little further into the details of his flat mate’s life. “So, university then, for you. What are you studying?”
“Ah, Mike. There you are. I have a selection ready for you to look over.”  The first cup and saucer set in front of Mike is of another design that is simple elegance and unique, but barely makes a chink of sound when set together for the doctor to consider. “This one is actually from an upcoming company in New York. Mouth-blown borosilicate glass, it’s shatter-resistant and resistant to high heat. It is the same glass used in making beakers, test tubes and other chemistry equipment. This is the clear, with no color infused in the glass, but I also have it available infused in sapphire blue, currant red, daffodil yellow, viridian green, and a smoky quartz.” The voice is cultured, baritone, and the crisp statement makes it clear that the man speaking knows his product.
Righting himself in the bed, he gave a glance over his bedraggled clothing, the usual perfect lines all creased and beyond correction from just his hands alone. Quietly, oh so quietly, he went through his clothing, pulling out a pair of dark purple pants, the softest t-shirt he owned because he was fond of the color being cadet blue, striped pajamas bottoms to add to the illusion of more height, and his darker blue dressing gown. He changed quickly, then made progress just as quietly into the living room, padding lightly on his bare feet.
It takes a few seconds for John to catch up with the change back to the everyday living topic, his mind set on a cuppa after Mike explained their joint destination. “Yeah, like that’s gonna happen.” He barely manages to contain the scoff from his statement, but there is a bit more good humor in it than had been there previously.
The detective shook his head. He didn’t mind a little shove if it got him some extra attention. It seemed like John was set on babying him for a while. Sherlock settled back in his chair. His elbow hurt and he was a bit angry with John. He had no right to go shoving him around. Yet, he supposed it was worth it if John was extra caring afterward.
“Are you hurt?” the detective inspector said. “You’re limping pretty bad there. Has John looked at that?”
Sherlock had stepped out of line and had to be dealt with.
The doctor returned a few moments later with an ice pack. He knelt down in front of Sherlock and placed the ice pack to his elbow. He was looking up the detective with a look of worry and guilt.
He was lying. Why? Was he trying to protect someone?
By the time he reached the crime scene, he was tired from trying to deal with his messed up foot. He had already told John if anyone asked about it he would say he cut it on a broken beaker. It was a believable lie.
“Do you think he murdered her?” Lestrade asked.
Sherlock glanced over his shoulder and caught the look of worry on Lestrade’s face. Why was he so concerned? It was just a hurt foot. What would he think if he knew John did it? Would he think Sherlock deserved the treatment or would he think John was out of line?
His eyes shot up, the darker blue meeting with the color swirl, and his lips quirked. “I was just making myself a drink in the kitchen.” He didn’t ask the vision, no Sherlock, along. He did tuck his head in that direction though, and linger just long enough to make sure Sherlock followed.
“I had a case." There was a pause, and then the vision had more to say to him. "You never called. I thought you’d at least try.” It almost sounded like a demand, but there was a touch of offended hurt behind the words, too. The vision, his vision, was hurt that Plain John Watson hadn’t called.
0o0o0o0
It was a reminder of something else though. Something he could never have. The soldier in the drawing was dead, and Sherlock was meant for an aged paragon of the realm. He began to cry more in earnest then, a drop of it landing on the fine paper, and he carefully wiped off the staining agent so it didn’t incur too much damage. Pursing his lips, he tried to improve the drying time, and carefully put the drawing back in with his other important relics. This too, he would take with him, wherever he was sequestered.
Sherlock didn’t have a valet, an expense too much for someone that didn’t normally care about his state of dress, and the money had been the one that probably had resulted in Mrs. Hudson being allowed to stay on. She didn’t dress him of course, but she did tie the strings at his neck, and try to make sure his cravat and boots were at least somewhat presentable.
It seemed as though it took forever, and when they pulled up to the location, John didn’t try to bolt out of the ambulance first. Staying back, he let the doors swing wide, and Sherlock be pulled out with the stretcher safely meeting the ground before he hopped out behind him. He touched to his side, aware that he’d left his gun back at the shop, and lifted his gaze to see that they were not in fact at a local hospital.
There was no clock in the room, but after the group left him alone with Sherlock, he drew out his phone to see the time. Just after nine, early yet, but he fought off the urge to call Mike and apprise him of the situation. Mycroft first, that’s who he’d speak to, if Sherlock didn’t wake up before that. Finally taking the leather club chair, unknowingly occupying just the design Sherlock had put into his John Space within his Mind Palace, John pulled it closer to the bed so he could hold onto Sherlock’s hand.
As he sat there, callouses on his fingertips playing lightly against the fabric, John is working through the next stage of their interaction in the way only a military man that was also a doctor, could. Important to delve further, understand Sherlock on a level where John could have them both understand what was acceptable to the other, yet be relaxed in one another’s company on a consistent basis. Perhaps it shouldn’t be as hard as it was, but John wasn’t always the jovial and laid back man that most people saw on the surface. He knew Sherlock had already deduced that, was likely encouraged by it, and was potentially hoping for more of John’s calm, yet clearly comprehensive, direction. Just the idea of that alone was sending a sharp buzz through his spine, sending a tingle into his arms and legs that had nothing to do with wartime injuries.
“Friend of mine. When I say ‘friend’…” For just an instant, Sherlock appeared crestfallen, but he didn’t have time to say more than, “Oh, Mrs Hudson, the landlady, she’s giving me a special deal. Owes me a favour. A few years back, her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida. I was able to help out.” Double-backing to the comment about the price of the flat, as if doing so would draw John’s attention away from the human relic and back to the much more promising details of the flat.
“John” was all he got out to the woman after her explanation, and an uneasy breath drawn into his lungs after she left. In her wake, the flat was pin-drop quiet, lingering that way until John got a clear head, and finally sought out Sherlock’s face once more. “Right…Well, Sherlock…you may call me John too, of course. Flatmates being in one another’s space all the time, after all.” Leaving his reaction to Mrs. Hudson’s comments to the wayside, he was back to trying to put Sherlock into a calmer frame of mind.
Mike raises a finger in farewell before Sherlock disappears from view, the door shut behind them, and John turns to look at his old friend. Mike just smiles, and starts to walk in the direction of the tube. “Yeah. He’s always like that, and you always did have a way with the pretty ones.”
Two days had become three, one of the other doctors out on maternity leave. John will still living in the bedsit, and out of plastic bags with plastic cutlery. Day by day, things were becoming less and less solid to him. Boring blurs, all of it.
“Why is he the new therapist?”
The sheets were of the deeper red shade too, the colors of the border now alternated so that the border design on them was the lighter one of the drapes. The bed had been outfitted with four pillows, matching cases crisp, and the duvet that stretched out over the remainder of the bed likewise sporting the key theme. The headboard of the bed slatted, a simple design with the foot board a lower version of the same, both with metal plates attached to the ends to display the matching key. The dresser sat alongside the wall to the right of the room, and he’d passed it on his way to the window, but gave it a moment or two of inspection and saw that the hardware was also composed of the squares from the fabrics and bed. It had six standard drawers, a small closet was situated between the end of it, and the corner of the room. Just large enough for a few suits, a fact that brought on a hardening of John’s features. He only saw it when he looked across to the wall opposite, where a square, full-length mirror reflected back his posture and closed features.
John hadn’t thought of his mother’s set in ages, and thinning his lips out, he swallows thickly, taking a few more steps to his left. His hand is clenching, but he wills it to relax, and looks over the floor to ceiling shelves of equally distinctive design. They form open-fronted boxes, and are made of teak or an equally dark wood, the crown moldings and hardwood floor beneath his feet, matching the scheme. Square black canisters with every conceivable type of tea are set on the niches, the lids are round with a border of a thin stripe of pink, and each one has a hand-written label that resembles parchment. A wooden sign designates sections of black tea, green tea, white tea, the whole lot. It mirrors the counter in length, and John can’t imagine even him ever needing that much tea in one lifetime. He hears a door open behind him, but he’s still figuring out exactly how many different types of tea are being sold, finally just multiplying the number of columns and rows that make up the shelving unit.
“Sorry, John. He was still at the shop when I left, mentioned he had a bit of stock to put away, but…Well, he seemed a bit distracted. Worried, maybe?” Mike sounded unsure, as if he thought he might be sharing too much information or he was just completely mistaken.
“Christ, John. It’s not a rendezvous. You’re just going to look at a flat.” John had barely stomached dinner after their meeting or breakfast and lunch today, so he was forcing himself to make something in his pitiful excuse for a kitchenette as he waited for a reasonable time to leave for the appointment. He’d been dressed for it an hour already, having taken more care than usual in his shower and shave, and wincing a bit at the fact there was nothing much to be done with his hair. It was slightly too long for his military background, but not long enough to alter.
John, having no idea what was going on, had brows thickly drawn down, and his lips thinned almost flat. When he saw Mycroft's behavior, he tried to set aside a rising tide of anger, but couldn't quite keep the level of demand from his tone. "No. What? What have you done?" Maybe knowing he wouldn't get the full lot of details from Mycroft, he sought Trevor's eyes instead, breath getting less steady by the moment.
When the door opened on its own, he curiously looked in from the offside kitchen, wondering who'd be arriving just now. The vision was there. Standing in Harry and Clara’s living room, and dressed in the tightest shirt John had ever seen. The teal color brought out the exact shade in the vision’s eye, the black suit cut trim as well accentuating his slender hips and gorgeous posterior. John’s mouth fell open.
When their eyes met, John thought he might go down through the very floor, for his vision had a whole galaxy stirring in his irises, the colors never quieting to just a basic one or two. The bowed-mouth had started to curve a little at the corners, but then the eyes suddenly opened more widely, and the vision darted off into the back room where the decorations were being stored.
“I cancelled. I don’t know. Maybe I’m wrong, but it just seems like something isn’t right. Sherlock always replies.” Forcing his fingers straight, John sat down in his chair, where they just resumed that curling on the arm.
The water had finally reached its necessary temperature, and John was breaking apart the thin pieces to get them settled, but his brain was on a loop. Mike had clearly intended John to have an interest in Sherlock, but John had no clue how far that interest was meant to go. Again, John was thinking about how active Sherlock seemed to be, and it inevitably led to his eyes fixing on the cane hooked on the back of the only chair in the meager flat.
“It’s just a place to live, John. Mike didn’t want you stuck here indefinitely, and maybe he thought you could help. It’s just sharing the rent.” The unspoken part, the part that would have caused his voice to crack and made his eyes turn in disgust from the cane, was about how Sherlock was young, beautiful, had so much going for him, and John was exactly the opposite-old, weathered from experience, too much sun, pain, and had nothing to show for any of it, not even a job. Self-loathing was welling up, and despite the care John had taken to get ready for the appointment, he limped his way over to the desk and picked up his phone. Before he could change his mind again, he sent the message.
He shut the door, but practically bounced off the mattress as he threw everything else onto it with equal zeal. Getting his mobile off the bedside table, he brought up the contacts, hit the correct name, touched the number, and waited for the call to go through. It only rang once, before the voice on the other end of the line greeted him.
Unbidden, the door opened, and Mrs. Hudson entered the room. She had been Sherlock’s nurse when he was growing up, and though he was long out of short clothes, the household budget had been stretched in its meager fashion to make sure that she was able to stay on. She was the only person that could calm Sherlock down when he was in one of his dark moods or a rare strop like the one that had taken hold this afternoon.
John shrugged a bit stiffly, a nostril flaring as his lips temporarily thinned, and he took a sip from his cup. "Couldn't say. I've only met him once, actually. Guessing he must be gone for awhile, because he hasn't been back around the flat, and Sherlock hasn't mentioned him to me." Yes, he knew there were many explanations, but he was trying not to let hope have its way with him. He was too old, and too worn down in some places, to have affection go wild and then have it all dashed if he was mistaken.
“Yes, tomorrow...then.” Sherlock is almost whispering at this point, and he’s pushing his hands into his trouser pockets, either trying to keep them from shaking or trying to appear more casual than John is guessing he actually is. Like a flash though, he leans to the left, opening the door for John. He still looks self conscious, and is avoiding direct eye contact, but John is smiling even more now.
Sherlock almost stumbled with the speed with which he rose, smiling timidly, but with such enthusiasm that John almost didn’t know what to make of it. What had he done to deserve this gorgeous, warm-hearted soul? He watched as Sherlock picked the tea back up, and hastened out of the living room to do as he’d been directed.
“Did that lamp from the last scene just disappear?”
John had been at the airport, sending Harry and Clara off on a belated honeymoon. The placed was of course packed, as Heathrow always was. Weighted down with not just his cane, but also an overnight kit of Clara’s, she rescued it from him just in time. A child had run past, energetic and ready to board, knocking the case from John’s hand where he loosely grasped the worn plastic handle.
“I don’t own it. I mean…My older brother, Mycroft, he owns it.” Rolling pressed lips against one another, he took a deep breath, blanching as he explained further. “He thought I needed a diversion, something besides my education, to keep me out of trouble. I mean…I play the violin, and I…well, I do other things, but he thought it wasn’t enough.”
“First of all, breathe Sherlock. You’re doing fine, and the meal was amazing.” The creases that formed near John’s indigo-colored eyes might have done more to cause the relaxing of Sherlock’s than the words, but time would tell. He certainly had no intentions of racing off, and not learning all he could about his remarkable young man.
If he was relaxed about it then she would be too.
“Come on,” John said with a snort. “‘I’ve seen you catch a cab during a snowstorm. Don’t give me that!”
“Sherlock!” John called kneeling down next to his lover. “Let me get that out. I’m so sorry.”
A case. Three days later Sherlock was called off on a case. A missing woman and a dead hedgehog. Sherlock was excited about the case. It was the first interesting one in weeks. Yet, his foot was still killing him. He really didn't like the idea of being on it. Whenever he stepped on it a wave of pain would shoot through this foot.
“What happened?” she asked when saw Sherlock limping around his flat.
“I’m going to wrap it,” John explained. “I’ll check it and help you change it, hun.”
To his surprise, Sherlock didn’t pull away from his touch. He half expected his mate to pull away from his touch. Sherlock allowed his lover to wrap his fingers around his arm. He wanted John to touch him in a soft loving way.
his boyfriend over a mistake. The word
“He did that?” Mrs. Hudson said setting the tea down.
He was determined to prove himself. He didn’t want his boyfriend thinking he didn’t care about their child.
Sherlock took a deep breath and leaned against the wall. He pulled out his mobile phone and dialed Lestrade’s number. The detective inspector picked up after a few rings.
“Are you still hurting?” John pushed the conversation on.
“John and I got into a fight yesterday,” he explained sitting down in his chair.
“I had to get off work early to pick her up,” the doctor explained. “I...I thought I could count on you. She’s your child too.”
Sherlock had no way to hide the bruise on his face. He thought of hiding it with makeup but thought better of it. What if he didn’t do a good job? If Lestrade thought he was trying to hide a bruise he might get suspicious.
“Do you feel like going out?” the doctor asked kneeling down in front of him.
To her surprise, John knocked the plate from his hand. The ceramic dish fell to the ground and shattered. Sherlock jumped back in surprise. He was looking to get a rise out of John but nothing too intense.
John never wanted to see that look on Sherlock’s eyes again. He wouldn’t allow it. He would help Sherlock heal and then things would be better. He had to stop letting his bad days get to him. Sherlock wasn’t trying to get a rise out of him. He was just as busy as he was. He
John quickly jumped back to his feet and ran into the kitchen. Sherlock shook his head as sat up. He didn’t think he was really hurt. He had just banged his elbow up a bit. He got to his feet and sat down in his chair.
doing anything wrong. Sometimes Sherlock needed a heavy hand. They both knew that.
He needed to stop. There was no way he was going to touch his lover in anger ever again.
Sherlock dropped his book and pulled his boyfriend in for a hug. This was what he enjoyed. The long hugs and soft kisses.
“I’m sorry about Seether,” John said softly. “I know you were..affected by her death.”
In all fairness, he had tried to get there but he had a feeling John wasn’t going to care.
“I did try to get a cab,” Sherlock explained. “I had to take the tube and a bus to get there. I did go as fast as I could.”
He smiled as he closed his eyes. He could get used to this.
“Just drop it,” Sherlock said kissing his lover’s cheek. “Let’s get dressed and have a fun night out. We don’t need to worry about this.”
He couldn’t make it too obvious or John would see right through it. He decided to stop doing the dishes since that was John’s pet peeve. He did things he really needed to do, like caring for Rosie but he tried to leave a trail of unfinished chores behind him.
