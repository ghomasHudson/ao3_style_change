“I’m ready,” Dean told Cas one winter night when they could hear the wind howling outside while they were warm and entwined under their comforter. They had spent a long time on foreplay, licking and sucking and stroking every available surface on one another’s bodies. Cas circled his fingers over Dean’s lube-slicked asshole, round and round, telling Dean how beautiful, how precious he was. “I’m gonna take care of you, my beloved,” he said, pressing two fingers in. “Just like you take care of me.”
She shook her head and gritted her teeth. “That bastard,” she spat out, referring to Crowley Dean assumed.
“No,” he said, feeling as if he were in a dream. Cas removed the lit cigarette from his fingers, and Dean let him. “No, thanks, he added,” and with that, he fell asleep.
“Sure, honey,” she agreed easily.
“He just got off an ashram,” Dean explained. “I mean, he’s like, remember when they found that little person out in the woods?” he asked. “Wolf boy?”
Dean looked up to see Cas’s concerned face, and reached out without answering. Cas, still naked, his now unsheathed cock almost limp, knelt down beside Dean and pulled him into an embrace. They stayed that way, Dean practically in Cas’s lap, until Dean started to shiver, and Cas urged him off the floor and back onto the bed. Cas stepped into the bathroom and after the sink ran for a awhile, he emerged with a damp washcloth to clean Dean up before pulling the covers from the floor where they had fallen, and wrapping them both up. They faced one another, skin to skin, clutched tight, breathing each other’s breath. “I want to tell you something,” Dean whispered, his eyes closed.
“I think we have some apples,” Cas said, his smile brightening. “Would you like one? They’re fairly round.”
“This can be my present,” Cas said with a grin, tugging at Dean’s pants until he lifted up enough for Cas to release his erection. And with that he swallowed Dean down.
“And since when do you get peppers and onions on pizza?” Sam continued. “No meat lovers?”
Carmen looked up, her smile fading too. “Dean, that’s sandwich meat,” she said, annoyed. She was always so particular about what foods were for what purpose.
He thought about that. The only thing he’d found palatable so far were those peas. “I don’t know. Something round maybe?” he mused.
“Why not?”
Dean and Cas lived comfortably for the next two days like an old married couple. Cas went off to the nursery, and Dean worked cleaning up the yard and building his unusual bird bath. He chiseled and sanded a number of the larger patio chunks into smooth, interlocking pieces and started to glue them together with concrete patch into a bowl about two feet in diameter. If he painted over the dull gray when it was done, he could make it look really nice.
After some quiet snuggling, Dean suggested, “Maybe it would be good for you to talk to a counselor or something like I’ve been doing.” Since he had to do it, Dean decided to make the best of his court-mandated counseling, and he’d come to like his counselor, Mia. Unloading all of the crap in his life from his mom’s death to his failed marriage onto a person who had no emotional investment in any of it was freeing, another step in this strange journey he’d been on since that fateful day he’d cracked his head on the pavement. He even enjoyed the AA meetings he also had to go to, although he didn’t think he was an alcoholic. He could tell no one at the meetings believed him when he said as much, but he didn’t mind. Hearing all of their stories of struggle and redemption was inspiring.
Dean found himself getting irritated. “So you just crash on people’s floors?” he asked, not bothering to blow his smoke away from Cas.
“It’s five hundred and eighty-seven dollars to get my car out of impound.” He was glad he couldn’t see her face.
“You didn’t ask,” he said. When Dean gave him an annoyed look, Cas screwed up his face like it was hard for him to figure out how to explain. He finally continued, “As I told you before, I left the ashram because I came to realize it was a cult. I didn’t like being under Chuck’s control.” He paused and turned to face Dean. “But I did enjoy some of it,” he admitted, his eyes pleading with Dean to understand, “and as you pointed out, I did learn a lot.”
Dean had a swirl of emotions about number 5. Did Cas want to be with him, really be with him, live with him long term? His instincts said yes, but Cas was so young, and whatever this thing was that was blossoming between them, was it love? It felt that way, but maybe it was too soon to tell.
“How are you feeling?” Cas, sitting up beside him, asked. His voice was coming from every direction. Dean didn’t answer. He felt something welling up from within, and crawled out of the nest into the dirt to puke. It was like everything he had ever been came out. Cas’s hand on his back felt electric. Dean focused on every point of contact and the energy that penetrated his skin. He didn’t respond to Cas’s question and instead gathered the surrounding dirt and stones with his hands to bury the vomit, an act which seemed very important, almost ceremonial. He moved away from the mound of dirt and continued to run his hands over the ground, clearing the dry rocky top soil to reveal a patch of the darker, moist ground underneath. A few tiny insects scrambled away from him, frantic at being exposed. The dirt itself writhed and pulsed. Dean watched it for a long time. He sensed Cas beside him, observing, but Dean couldn’t take his eyes off the living, breathing dirt.
Once Benny was out of sight, Amara slipped her hands into the soapy water over Dean’s. “Here, let me help you with that,” she whispered, entwining her fingers with Dean’s.
He searched his memory. “Couple days ago?” he said.
Dean forced himself to look at the food, but it didn’t look like food at all. He shook his head slightly and said, “It just doesn’t look right to me.” He felt light and clean, and everything on the plate looked heavy and repulsive.
Cas was unfazed. “Would you like something to eat?” he asked in such a sweet voice that Dean felt something loosen in his throat that he hadn’t even realized was tight.
“Before meeting you, I thought I would walk the earth alone for the rest of my life like the Wandering Jew,” Cas said, sounding near tears. “I never thought I would ever feel so loved.”
“Me too,” Cas said, and Dean sucked in a breath. “It’s why my mother left with me. I was six.”
“What?” Carmen said as she placed the dirty dishes in the sink.
“Mr. Dean!” Benny called, setting a paper bag, undoubtedly filled with beer, on the kitchen counter.
Carmen’s mouth dropped open and she didn’t speak for a moment. “Excuse me?” she said, her voice low and slow.
Dean wished he could wrap her in a warm hug and soothe her, but that wasn’t possible while buckled into a car. Plus, his arms felt like sandbags. The calm and warmth he felt toward Carmen felt new, not like the ordinary, obligatory affection he usually felt toward the girl he’d entered adulthood with, but something deeper he knew he would feel toward anyone who crossed his path at the moment. A love for humanity. It was like a golden buzzing deep within, but his head hurt too much to think about it beyond that.
Dean ignored him and kept talking, closing his eyes again, “85 miles an hour, my eyes are closed.” He started moving his hand back and forth to the rhythm of his words: “Switching lanes...85 miles...100 miles….125 miles an hour, five, ten minutes.”
There was a pause and the tapping of keys. “Sir, you are already at your limit,” the voice stated without judgement, but Dean still felt judged.
Cas released Dean’s chin, turned and left the room without answering. Carmen gave him a puzzled look but then turned her attention to Dean. “Amara and Benny are coming over tonight.”
Dean shook his head. “I don’t know if I’m making sense.”
The doctor insisted he stay awake though and had him squeeze his fingers with both hands, push against his arm, and turn his head. He had him follow a pen light with his eyes and he hit his elbows with a little hammer to check his reflexes.
“I don’t think anything is wrong with eating vegetables,” Cas said, and a bolt of affection shot through Dean.
“Dean!” Carmen admonished again.
“Amara!” Carmen protested.
“I didn't want to say nothin’ in front of Carmen,” he whispered.
“I’m very sorry to hear that,” Cas said, lowering the book to the table, his sympathetic eyes meeting Dean’s, which just enraged him more.
Sam seemed to consider that. “Well, even if you’re not an alcoholic,” he said, “maybe the counseling will be a good thing.”
“Why didn’t you go to college?” Cas asked, breaking Dean out of his reverie.
“Let go of him!” Carmen shouted, pulling Amara away, causing Dean to slump back to the couch.
“Hey,” Dean said with a smile as he grabbed his coveralls.
The next time he opened his eyes, the pain was muffled, like the tip of the knife was puncturing his forehead through layers of cotton. He could see now that his hands were wrapped in gauze. They stung distantly as if the wounds barely belonged to him.
He draped the soft fleece blanket Carmen kept at the foot of the bed, around his shoulders and wandered out to the kitchen. He still hadn’t eaten since coming home from the hospital, but didn’t feel hungry. He was permiated with some kind of glow that transported him from one room to the next. He filled the coffee pot with water and watched as it heated up. He then took a mug from the cupboard and filled it with the hot water. The mug infused his hands with warmth. He sat at the table and sipped his hot water, feeling it travel down his esophagus and into his stomach from which it seemed to branch out into his extremities. It must have been late in the day because Cas arrived home and stood in the entryway looking at Dean as if trying to read him. Dean sipped his water. “Do you want something to eat?” Cas asked.
“Well yeah, Sam, life is strange,” Dean conceded. “I’m not gonna turn my back on something this good because it’s strange. What me and Cas got going between us...it’s not like anything else I’ve experienced, and I’m gonna go with it, y’know?” he said, feeling more passionate as he spoke.
“That’s awesome, Sammy. You’re amazing!” Dean said. Sam paused for a good thirty seconds, and Dean realized he probably didn’t know what to say in response to Dean’s praise. Was he just surprised, or maybe even choked up?
Dean squinted past Cas to see Carmen fastening an earring. Cas straightened and left the room, squeezing past Carmen who glared at him.
“I wanted to make sure you weren’t still mad at me,” she said with pleading eyes.
“Take care, Benny,” Dean said, feeling like he had to appease his friend somehow, although he didn’t know what he’d done wrong. What did it matter to Benny if he didn’t care about his car anymore? Cars were just a collection of metal parts.
Carmen looked pissed, but Amara just looked a little hurt. “She paid for the bail bond! What do you think?” Carmen said in a kind of whispered shout. In Kansas, a third DUI was a felony, and he knew bail was at least a thousand. People were milling around them, and Carmen didn’t like to cause scenes in public. She turned and walked toward the door before he even got to the bottom of the stairs. Amara gave him a sympathetic glance, but when he said nothing, she followed Carmen. What was he supposed to do? Thank her? He knew he should feel ashamed that his wife had to ask his mistress for bail money, but he just seethed with a formless anger. This was all his fault, obviously, but he felt aggrieved nonetheless.
“Ok, I’ll see you,” Dean said, focused solely on his Baby.
“So what do you think this is about, Dean?” Cas asked, waving his sandwich toward Dean’s plate.
“I’ve never paid rent,” Cas said without shame, contemplating his bacon.
“How old is he, and why does he need a place to stay?” Dean was suspicious of everyone in Carmen’s family. She had one older brother who was in prison for murder and one sister who was in prison for embezzelment. He knew of several more of her family members who were hardcore druggies and a couple of them had tried to get money from them before. He’d had to give a beat down to one sister’s boyfriend when he wouldn’t take no for an answer. Another thing he and Carmen had in common is that they agreed they didn’t want kids. They’d seen first hand all the ways parents could screw them up. That was also how Carmen and Amara had become friends. They’d met at a barbeque and bonded over their decision not to have kids, something that made them freaks in the eyes of their other Kansas girlfriends, and Amara had given her a job as her receptionist.
“Well isn’t that precious,” Dean conceded, already leaving the room. “Just don’t eat our food or use our shit anymore,” he called over his shoulder. He could hear Carmen apologizing for him.
“Carmen, goddammit, stop abusing her!” he exploded after one too many taps on the brake as they were moving.
The next morning, Dean was yanked out of sleep by the sound of Carmen’s hair dryer. Their bedroom was small enough that the attached bathroom was only a few feet away from the bed and you could hear everything even through the closed door. He’d had at least one too many beers the night before and had a good ache going behind his eyes.
“A single event can awaken within us a stranger totally unknown to us. To live is to be slowly born.”
In the car on the way, Dean drifted in and out, Carmen muttering about insurance and money from the driver’s seat. He slept through the long wait at the emergency room, and eventually roused enough to enter a cubicle where a nurse took all his vitals and blood and hooked him up to an IV. Carmen stood by fidgeting the whole time while Dean reclined and dozed again.
“You ever sleep outside?” Dean continued.
“I’ll eat some bread later,” he answered with a wink and started to walk away.
“Oh yeah?” Dean said, fading.
“I sentence you to ninety days house arrest and a one-thousand five hundred dollar fine,” the Honorable Billie J. Morton, as her name plate said, intoned from the bench. The courtroom was nothing fancy, but Judge Morton, a tall Black woman talking down to him from her bench with an imperious glare, made Dean feel like he was standing before the Supreme Court. “I’m not finished,” she intoned when Sam slapped Dean on the back and opened his mouth to thank her for reducing Dean’s charge to a misdemeanor. “Stopping repeat drunk drivers is my personal mission. People like you are everything I live to set right. To tame.”
“Are you still angry with me?” Cas asked, sounding like a little boy. Dean couldn’t help himself from placing an anchoring hand on Cas’s lower back.
Benny made another grab for the snacks and Amara slapped his hand away saying, “That’s enough, baby.”
“Thank you,” Dean said, letting his tears fall and placing his own hand on Cas’s stubbled cheek. “That was… thank you.”
Cas stepped out of the kitchen toward him, lifting a hand as if to touch, but then dropping it. “How are you?” he asked. He hesitated before saying, “Your trip seemed fairly...intense.”
She wrenched her wrist out of his grip, her face twisting up as if she was going to cry, but no tears fell. “Whatever, Dean,” she said, her face going back to neutral, her fury gone. “I guess we should split up then.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean panted. He’d had a few dicks up his ass, but always when wasted, so out of it he might not have even remembered doing it except for the ache in his ass the next morning. He wanted Cas to fuck him more than anything now though. “Just,” Dean grunted, an image of himself on all fours in a filthy alley flashing in his mind, making him hesitate for a second, before licking and biting at the pale column of Cas’s neck. “Yeah,” he repeated after coming up for air.
“About fifteen minutes,” Dean admitted, smiling.
“I think,” Dean started, then stopped. “I think that’s what fucked me up the most. I mean, a lot of shit fucked me up, but being that out of control and treated like a piece of trash, that shut me down for good.”
“Are you going to get on?” Cas asked, watching him.
Carmen rolled her eyes. “I have to go,” she said.
It took some effort for his parole officer to get the ankle bracelet off, but when it finally clicked open, Dean felt like a hundred pounds had been lifted from him. “Thank you,” he said to Jerry, and it was heartfelt.
Sam let out a breathy laugh. “Wait, wait, I’ll get to that,” he said, “but I gotta ask you some questions first.”
It took a moment for Sam’s words to compute. “What? How could you be a lawyer already?” Dean asked. He knew Sam graduated from undergrad early because a big-wig professor gave him some kind of internship that usually only went to grad students, but Sam was only twenty-three now. His little brother was a genius, even got some hugely prestigious award Stanford Law gave to hardly anyone that paid for law school, but Dean thought it would be at least another year until he was an actual lawyer.
“Shoot, Sammy,” Dean agreed.
“This is not about checks,” Dean said.
They were so close, Dean might as well have been talking to himself. “I told you I turned tricks sometimes when I was a kid.”
“Huh?” Dean looked out the window to see they were at Crowley’s. It looked different somehow, as if it were underwater.
Dean picked up a pea with his fingers, admired it’s smooth roundness and then popped it in his mouth. He enjoyed its subtle sweetness and starchy texture.
“Do you remember being mad at me?” she asked slowly, as if Dean might not understand.
Dean made it through his first day back, but by the end of the second, he fell asleep on his creeper under a ‘66 Stingray. In a dream, he was an infant looking up at his mother. She reached out to him, her golden hair framing her beautiful smile and shimmering green eyes. He reached out to her and then was jarred awake as his hand was slapped away. Crowley stood above him, glowering, apparently having pulled him and the creeper out from under the car. “What the hell are you doing, Dean?” Crowley exclaimed, backing up as if he’d been assaulted.
Cas appeared in the bedroom doorway, sleep-tussled and adorable.
― Jeanette Winterson, The Passion
“Get out of our bedroom, Cas” Carmen admonished from the doorway.
“No, it’s good,” Cas said with growing enthusiasm. “I think Dean is having an awakening.”
“Is this good? You gonna be ok?” she asked. The concerned words sounded more like impatience. She had to get to her own job.
Cas looked at him with his trademark curious head tilt.
“It’s fucking two in the morning, Carmen,” Dean said, incredulous. “What the fuck?”
Dean swallowed down the lump in his throat at her words, which seemed threatening despite her unchanged inflection. He wondered if she knew someone killed by a drunk driver or something, maybe someone close to her. He knew it was only luck that had kept him from hitting someone the many times he’d been wasted behind the wheel, and he absorbed her anger, took it seriously. She had no way of knowing what he knew, that it would never happen again. He wondered why she'd reduced his charge.
“Sh!” Dead shushed her to hear what else the voice had to tell him. “Can you repeat that please?” he asked.
“The Impala,” Benny said, as if it were obvious. “I know how she feels about that car.”
Sam automatically responded, “‘Night jerk.” Some things never changed.
Benny frowned and shook his head in disgust. “And what’s the plan to get her out, Dean?”
The anger in his voice made Dean shrink a bit. “I don’t think I feel like driving,” he murmured. He just wanted to exist in his own body, to propel himself with his own legs, not with the assistance of any type of machinery. Driving a car seemed unnatural.
“Five hundred eighty-seven dollars.” The thought of being even more in debt to a woman he was getting tired of fucking made his stomach roil, but he had no other options left.
“You’re going to have to move the fuck out of here,” Dean said, lighting up a cigarette and pointing at Cas.
“If you want, I can bring some of the extra plants from work for you to plant in the yard,” Cas said as Dean crouched down to resume piling up the concrete chunks. He thought of how he could break them down further and maybe create a bird bath.
Dean took a moment to let that sink in and then laughed. “That’s,” he started, paused to catch his breath, and then started again. “That’s fuckin’ awesome.” He looked at Cas beside him and could practically see the wheels turning in his dude’s brain.
“What? No!” Cas said in the closest thing to a shout he’d ever heard from him.
“He may not have the words for it,” Cas powered on, “but if you look at him out there, he’s laughing and he’s happy.” There was another long silence. “I can give you something to read,” Cas added.
“No thanks,” Benny said, shaking his head, his eyes wide.
Dean had an urge to reach out and touch him, but his body felt so heavy. Instead he said, “Just leave me alone.”
Dean shrugged. “No plan,” he said, and at Benny’s incredulous look added, “It’s ok, man,” as if soothing an angry bear.
Dean didn’t say anything to Cas as they finished up their shopping, checked out and carried their bags across the street to the bus stop. It wasn’t until they were seated on the bus, their bags in their laps that Dean looked at Cas and said, “Well, what about that?” They started cracking up and didn’t stop until they got off at their stop ten minutes later.
“They tell you that you can’t leave the house,” Dean explained. “It has like a force field.” Dean let go of Bertha and circled his hands around himself to illustrate. “There’s a range, and it’ll just hone in on you.”
“Wow,” Sam said with raised eyebrows.  “So what was with all the DUIs?”
Carmen looked at him in disbelief. “What, that you haven’t eaten for nearly a week?”
“I’m not saying it has anything to do with checks. It’s just that…”
Dean pulled his hands out saying, “Ok, easy there, easy.” He didn’t want to start anything with their spouses right in the house. Not to mention Cas might be lurking around somewhere. Plus, he just wasn't feeling Amara lately.
“Don’t feel like this is charity,” Crowley continued. “You need a way to get to work. It’s not good for our image for customers to see you riding a bicycle or getting dropped off by your wife like a child.” His face pinched with distaste when saying the word bicycle as if he were saying “shit.” “I could take a little bit out of your paycheck each month. How does that sound?” He smiled at Dean expectantly.
“We don’t have insurance,” Carmen blurted out, and the doctor’s eyes widened.
After they were done eating, they set up kind of a nest in the backyard. Dean’s sledgehammering had revealed ground that was all loose dirt and rocks, so Dean got a tarp from the garage and they laid that down first, then Cas’s camping pad and Dean’s exercise mat from the weight room, then every blanket and pillow in the house and Cas’s sleeping bag. It was a clear and balmy night, and while the lights and noise on the wrong side of the tracks in suburbia didn’t exactly lend themselves to peaceful star-gazing, they could see the big dipper, and Cas pointed out the little dipper, which Dean hadn’t even known about.
She gasped, clutching at her chest in shock when she looked up and saw him lurking in the dark, watching her through the glass. When she recognized him, her scared face morphed into a coy smile and she ended her call and unlocked the door for him.
“Yeah, I know,” he agreed. “I feel bad about Carmen, but y’know, I’m pretty sure she’s not in love with me anymore.” He paused for a moment to think. “I mean, to tell you the truth, I’m not sure we were ever in love. It was more like we were just comfortable, y’know?” Dean hadn’t been conscious of that thought until now, but it was true. Each of them had been what the other needed at the time, a lifeline out of their crappy home lives, but it was never some great love affair. “I hope she can forgive us one day,” he added, “but yeah, she’s pretty pissed.”
Cas had suggested walking down the road and hanging out in the woods for Dean’s trip, but Dean thought it was a bad idea. He’d never been a boy scout or anything, and the woods always seemed creepy to him. They decided instead to hang out in the backyard since it was another warm, sunny day, and they could always take a walk later if Dean felt like it.
Dean studied Cas for a bit, and Cas didn’t look away. “You must have had a weird upbringing, the way you talk,” he said. “You don’t sound like a regular kid.”
“Ok,” Dean had easily agreed. The truth was, he had started to enjoy living in Lawrence now that he spent more time around the campus. Starting college had opened up his world as well as Cas’s, and he realized his town was more than the dive bars and burger joints he’d always frequented before. He’d miss it and the people he’d met there if they lived in the middle of nowhere. Self-sufficiency seemed less and less attractive to both of them.
“Why?” she asked, as if she really couldn’t understand what was going on with him. She knew what the car meant to him, but she still didn’t care that Baby was gone.
“Broke?” Carmen countered. “Cas, enough already!”
Back at the house, Benny was sitting at the kitchen table with Carmen. They looked up to say “hey” when he walked in but kept talking, apparently about Amara, as he put the beets in the refrigerator. He felt hungry for the first time since the accident.
“She won’t know the difference,” Dean said.
“What?” Dean said, pretty sure he hadn’t done that.
“If only you could see this as a good thing,” Cas said, his voice rough with sadness.
“Cas, can I talk to you for a minute?” Carmen said from the sliding door, ignoring Dean.
Cas ran a hand up and down Dean’s arm. “Well, I don’t know what the conditions were when you did that, but there’s a protocol to follow,” he said. “You’re supposed to be in a comfortable, non-threatening environment without overstimulation, and you should be with a sober person who can sit with you.”
Dean laughed and held out a beckoning hand to Carmen, “Honey, come here.” Carmen’s face softened and Dean said, “Come on,” again, gesturing her over.
Before he could continue, Dean interrupted, saying, “No she didn’t. What do you know?” Dean thought of the pretty, brown-eyed girl he first met in the back of the school during lunch when he went out for a smoke. He had just moved to town after their dad lost yet another job and moved them back to Kansas. Dean was so fucking pissed off at everything, particularly about having to start at a new school in eleventh grade. He was so close to dropping out, and eventually did before the year ended. He also thought about ditching his dad every day and going out to Hollywood or somewhere else, but he couldn’t leave Sammy alone with their dad, and the truth was, he couldn’t leave their dad either. First of all, Baby technically belonged to the old man, even though Dean mostly drove her, but also Dad depended on Dean, and Dean shuddered to think how much further he’d crawl into the bottle if one or both of his kids left him. And in the midst of all of the crap in his own life, Dean saw this gorgeous chick who looked even more pathetic than him. She had a faint shiner under one eye and was crying softly. He asked her if she was ok, shared his smoke, and the rest was history.
“Dean, wait,” Cas called behind him. “Will you please drink some water?”
Dean allowed Cas to haul him up and lead him out of the woods, an arm held around his shoulders. His face was a balloon, light and swollen, as if it were trying to float away from him. The sky was endless indigo and filled with stars he’d never noticed before. Their beams streaked down to Earth, and Dean reached out to catch them as Cas shuffled him down the sidewalk toward the house. A few cars passed them, their dark, shiny bodies leaving shadows and echoes in their wake.
Dean had always loved the raunchy chaos of the club, but now the air, thick with smoke and b.o., made him gag, and Lee, Charlie, and Ash’s yelping and hollering at the strippers on the stage who gyrated around their poles rattled in his head. The dancers looked to Dean like exotic wild animals, their skin glistening like reptilian scales, their faces contorted into rictuses of feigned pleasure that was more like feral snarling.
“Because we don’t have it,” she said slowly, as if he was an idiot.
“It was time,” Cas answered cryptically.
Dean squinted up at her, still holding the mug in both hands, and she retreated to the bedroom, looking satisfied, as if he had agreed to something.
Dean weighed the consequences of being late to work against the humiliation of riding that ridiculous bike, and chose the humiliation. Cas brought the bike around to the front of the house and handed it over. “Uh, thanks,” Dean mumbled. He hadn’t ridden a bike since he was around thirteen, and he never rode one very much back then either. When Dean was around nine and they were living in some shithole motel in Kansas City, Dean had found a rusty, broken BMX abandoned by a dumpster. He used whatever he could find in his dad’s tool box to fix the thing up, and did a serviceable job. He and Sam had shared it for a few years, sometimes with Sam up on the handlebars and Dean doing all the work. That bike was one of the few bright spots in their childhood, but Dean left it to Sam once he'd gotten more interested in booze, sex, and earning some money so Sam would stay fed and clothed. He didn’t know what Sam had done with it.
Dean absently waved back on his way back to bed, Cas’s palm warm against his shoulder.
Dean enunciated slowly. “Hot...water.”
“See, this is a working house,” Dean continued, starting to pace. “People in this house work for a living.” He stopped in his tracks upon seeing Cas nod his head. “Yeah, don’t just nod your head at me, ok?” he said, his irritation growing. “You’re eating bacon because somebody worked to put it there.” Dean didn’t know why he was so pissed off at the kid. He’d only been there a short time and he hadn’t been much trouble. He just didn’t like freeloaders. Dean had been working since he was ten years old in some capacity or another, since four if you counted taking care of Sammy as work. His whole life had centered around making enough money to survive, and here he was, finally in his own house, and this kid, this annoyingly attractive man-boy, had the nerve to squat there.
Dean even looked into how he could maybe convert Baby to electric, but that was beyond even his considerable skill set. Sometimes when he was under the hood tuning her up or feeling the hum of her engine when he drove, Dean thought of all the time he’d spent with her throughout his life, and how small that life had been. She was now a symbol of how big his life had become.
Dean knew it was no use and decided to have some fun with the guy. He felt like his life was spinning out of control, and when he felt that way, he got more reckless and obnoxious. “Can you tell me one thing that I can do that doesn’t involve money?”
Amara straightened her clothes, grabbed her purse from the coffee table, and hissed, “If Dean dies, it’s your fault,” before stomping out the front door.
“No you can’t,” Cas said, picking up the last piece of bacon, as if what he said was an incontrovertible fact.
Dean chuckled, realizing he had actually moaned out loud. “Just enjoying life, Sammy,” he said with a smile before continuing to eat.
Cas nodded and waited for the answer. The unwavering stare that Dean found unnerving before his accident was now quite grounding.
When he turned around to go back inside, Crowley was standing out front with his arms crossed. “Dean, we need to talk,” he said, leading the way into his office. “Have a seat,” he said, once they were both alone inside and he’d closed the door. Dean looked at him expectantly.
“Uh, yeah,” Dean said. He didn’t know quite how he felt about it all. He wasn’t the person he was before the bike accident, but he wasn’t the person he was after the accident either anymore. It was like the two versions of him had merged together. All the things he had suppressed for so long were now at the forefront of his mind. He wasn’t afraid of any of it anymore, but it was right there now, and he wasn’t sure how he wanted to move forward. “I’m ok, but I don’t think I’m ready to talk about it yet,” he decided.
"It doesn't matter. That doesn't give me the right to be the biggest asshole in the world."
Warnings: Mention of suicide
Dean texted.
"If you want."
If something would happen to Sam, Dean didn't know what he would do. He'd get even crazier than I already was. Life without his brother wasn't a life. It wasn't even a life now. Sam was literally his best friend right now.
"You look like shit." he said at some point and bit his lip.
Cas drove slowly, so Dean could keep up with him in an comfortable pace. Dean enjoyed this, them walking and talking. He appreciated Cas' company.
Dean knew what he meant and it surprised him that he could honestly deny this question. No, he hadn't, because he had made sure that he didn't. He had gone straight to Cas and prevented it, because he knew that if he had been alone in that house for just one second, he would have done it.
"I don't know, Dean. Somehow. We would have found a way." he said and laid down again.
"I'm not angry."
"I've known Gabriel and Michael forever, ever since we were little. They were the first ones I came out to. At some point, Gabriel introduced me to Balthazar, and somehow, there was something and nothing at the same time. I don't know, but I liked him and I thought that it could go somewhere, and I wanted my mom to know that." Cas removed his hand from Dean's leg. "I just wanted to talk to her, let her into my life, you know. Is that stupid?"
"Thanks." Dean said at some point and she frowned. "That you didn't put him on the street."
Actually Dean didn't think much of it, in fact he didn't feel like it, but Cas' grandparents were nice. Very nice, in fact. They didn't ask any questions, maybe they didn't care.
Sammy was out all the time and didn't come back until dinner. They sat together for dinner in the evening and talked about life. At least Sam and their dad. John even got up more often to cook something. On good days it was even Dean.
"I have a gift for you, if that's what we are gonna call it."
It was not their old house, it was their home. How could his father just forget that?
But for a few seconds he was able to forget about all that.
But Dean was sure that, even if it was just a cruel test, a game, he would loose. He was loosing. Because no one explained the rules to him and sometimes it felt like everyone was against him. As if everyone else did know the rules and mocked Dean, because he fucking didn't.
"Fuck, Dean." Dean heard him say softer, sadder. Dean noticed how his vision blurred. Actually, he had expected Cas to approach him, to do something, but he just stayed where he had been before. Dean glanced over his shoulder and saw Cas leaning his entire body against the wall. He looked at the ceiling, probably deep in his thoughts.
“We’ll give Dean a little something to eat, and then you can go home,” she concluded, leaving without even looking at them as if her mind were already on her next task.
“She’s my employer,” Carmen repeated, over-enunciating each word.
He looked uncomfortable, probably wondering what kind of dumbasses didn’t have even the most basic health insurance. It wasn’t their fault they made too much money to be on Medicaid but not enough to afford private health insurance. They weren’t going to choose paying for health insurance over paying their phone and cable bills or buying groceries and gas. “Oh, uh, well that’s not my area, so I’ll have someone from billing come see you,” he said before he and the nurse made a quick exit.
Crowley's face went from a look of disbelief to a scowl, and he stalked out of the locker room without another word.
“Heh, yeah, well it’s been awhile,” he said with a self-conscious dip of his head. He looked up and down Dean’s body before adding, “You look like a fuckin’ scarecrow. We’re gonna do some eating while I’m here.”
“Oh, really,” Carmen sneered.
“Me too, baby,” Dean said, feeling protective of the beautiful boy in his arms. “I think it’s safe to say our marriage is over.” They let the gravity of what they’d done sit between them for a while, neither knowing what to say or do to make the situation right. Without asking Cas about it, Dean knew that he and Cas were not a one-time fling. They were both in deep as soon as it started.
“Wow,” Sam said. “Who is this and what did you do with my brother?”
“People tend to ‘flip out’,” Cas said using actual dorky finger quotes, “if they don’t feel safe or know what to expect. Cas got a dreamy look on his face. “But when they do, the experience can be incredible,” he said. “It’s like I could see the beauty in everything, including myself, and I could let go of a lot of negative energy. I would never have left the ashram if I hadn’t had that experience.”
Dean chuckled. “Well,” he said. “I don’t have any money, no job, and I’m gonna be a felon now, so I don’t think so.”
“Dean!” Carmen yelled, diving for the phone, but Dean already ended the call, laughing. “They record those!”
Cas brought out a jug of water and a notebook and pen in case Dean wanted to write anything down. He found some trippy instrumental music to play on Dean’s phone--lots of chimes and gongs. He said it was better not to listen to music Dean was familiar with because the music would affect the trip. Dean figured Metallica and Zeppelin might not be the best music for it anyway. He laid back in the nest and raised his face to the sun. It was the perfect day for this, or he figured a seventy degree sunny day was perfect for a peyote trip, but what did he know?
Cas pulled him in close again and they started to kiss a little desperately and rub their hardening cocks together. Dean wished they had some lube and condoms because he wanted to get inside Cas or Cas to get inside him. But the friction they had going was good too and Cas lasted a lot longer this time. The rolling and rolling of their hips felt like being tossed in ocean waves to Dean. Cas came, and it didn’t take long for Dean to follow. He cleaned up their bellies as best he could with a pillowcase and tossed it into the darkness. They kissed some more, now wet and slow.
There was a knock on the front door, and he opened it to find Amara on the other side in a tight red mini dress, her tousled hair swept up in a big clip. He turned and walked toward the kitchen, and he didn’t stop her as she followed. She only spoke after Dean had filled a glass of water at the sink, took a sip, and turned to face her.
Garth sat back down and gave him a sad smile, and Dean left without another word.
“Good,” Benny answered, peering over Dean’s shoulder. “How long you been washing that bowl, cher?”
“Guys?” she stage-whispered, interrupting Benny’s story about some guy trying to cheat him outrageously on the price of a 340 valve cover. “Guys, excuse me, excuse me.” When she had their full attention, she asked, “Guess what?”
Once Dean was up and riding, the muscle memory kicked in, and he arrived at the garage in about twenty minutes, almost the same amount of time the bus took, including the walk to the bus stop and the stops along the way. He was on time, barely, but the looks he got from his coworkers almost made him turn around and go home. Lee outright laughed when he saw the bike, but the others were at least kind enough to snicker to themselves. Crowley was talking to some slick old guy in a suit, when he saw Dean tuck the bike in a corner outside the locker room and gave him a quick glare before returning to his conversation. Dean put his head down, changed into his coveralls in the locker room, and got to work.
“Not really?” Dean answered, although it sounded like a question.
Dean flicked some ash out the window and glanced over at her. “An ashram? What the fuck is an ashram?”
Was he sick? Dean wondered. On some level he knew that he wasn't behaving normally. Carmen was right. Normal people didn’t eat raw beets like apples, or only round things. Normal people worried when they lost their jobs. But he didn’t feel sick. Cas was right. He was happy. Carmen didn’t seem part of that. He remembered times in the past when he thought he was happy with her, all that stoned fooling around in high school; tumbling into the courthouse, boozy, in their second-hand wedding clothes and saying “I do”; sleeping in the bed they owned in the house they owned for the first time. It had sort of seemed like happiness, like the best they could possibly do. No one was hurting them. They were safe and doing what normal people were supposed to do, living the dream. Weren’t they? None of it seemed real now. The dirt under that concrete seemed real. The cool condensation on the glass in his hand seemed real. And Cas. What he felt for Cas seemed real.
“You know, I just wanted to say something,” Sam said. “I know we’ve known each other for a long time, and somehow I’ve never said this, but… you know I consider you like family, right?”
Gil started on his right arm, the tattoo machine buzzing calmingly. Dean exhaled for the first time in over a century.
“Why here?” Dean asked, breaking the silence that had been blanketing them for what felt like a very long time. Castiel had flown them to the park as soon as Dean had given the go-ahead, and all the nearby light bulbs had exploded upon their landing. A pedestrian had noticed, but immediately un-noticed at a wave of Castiel’s hand.
“Kid, I don’t know about this,” Bobby said. “No one will see the outside of the house, anyways.”
“I think it’s more complicated than that,” Sam said. “Have you ever heard of a half-demon, half-human child?”
She closed the door, but Dean awkwardly scratched the back of his head and backed away anyways, clearing his throat and opening the door again, with a “nothing to see here” expression on his face. He didn’t give Cas a second look, leaving Cas to scramble out after him.
“Not this again,” Dean said. “Don’t tell me you’re still offended.”
“Uh, Cas?” Dean said, clearing his throat quietly. “Usually people don’t stand this close to each other.”
“Finally it clicks,” Zachariah said.
“I still think this should count as a win for me,” Gabriel said.
“What are you?” Dean said, still holding out the axe. It occurred to him that this was the first time he’d spoken aloud in years -- he found he didn’t need or want words to torment his victims.
Michael’s side?
“Where is God?” Cas yelled again.
Angels had no need for breath, apparently, but Dean quickly ran out of breath, pulling back and panting embarrassingly. Cas didn’t waste a second, moving his mouth to the side of Dean’s neck and sucking, so suddenly that Dean involuntarily let out a moan. When was the last time someone had bothered to kiss his neck? It had been over a century, he was sure, and he had forgotten that he even had nerve endings there, had forgotten that it could feel good.
The bottle landed on Dean, because of course it did. Dean smiled mischievously and said something suggestive, something Cas didn’t remember because at the time of the saying, Cas was still somewhat scared of Dean and his blatant expression of his bisexuality, and tried to forget about any sexually charged moments the second they happened. Cas wasn’t in the closet, but he still kind of
“You think it’s going to be
“You mean, after we get breakfast?”
“Unless,” Dean said, clearing his throat. “Unless, for some reason, you wanted to have a two night stand.”
“Hey,” Bobby grumped. “That one is mine.”
Cas raised an eyebrow at that, wondering how Gabriel had been bribed into doing anything that could be described as “helping.” He followed Gabriel up the stairs, afraid of what he might be walking into, but before he could say anything, Gabriel spinned and steered him into a linen closet with a little more force than was probably required.
seemed to be tracking some point Dean couldn’t for their entire journey out. “You saved me even though you knew I’d just end up there again?”
“I guess,” Jo said.
“Um,” Dean said, licking his lips. “I wouldn’t say no.”
fuck me, Cas.”
“I doubt it,” Dean said, following his lead. It didn’t take long to search the whole place, where there was no trace whatsoever of Siobhan. There was, however, a sulfurous odor in the air.
Dean shrugged. “Cas saved me.”
are coming over tomorrow?” Cas muttered to Dean. Somehow everyone heard him.
“Yeah, I could say the same for you,” Dean said. “Did you find Anna? Or God?”
Gabriel just smiled angelically. “Our beloved Dean-o sure has a lot of exes, doesn’t he?”
“That ain’t good,” Bobby muttered. “Other hunters have been saying the same type of thing.”
Dean slept a whole six hours that night, six hours of formless horror that he forgot all details of as soon as he woke up. It was that way every night -- Dean had a hundred years of hell to dream about, after all, and whether or not he managed to fall asleep, he relived them every single night after the lights turned out.
“Okay,” Dean said, nodding. “Because, like, I don’t want to pressure you into anything, you’re a fucking
Dean growled and pushed with all his strength against the wall. He could feel that it was weakening the longer Alastair talked, but not fast enough.
“Maybe he was,” Dean said. “But hey, we don’t need him.”
“He hid us from the other angels!” Sam said, gesturing to his ribs. “Why would he do that?”
So I can pick Cas?
Dean met Cas’s gaze for a long moment. He couldn’t tell if it was Castiel himself, or the vessel he was occupying, but Dean found himself completely unable to tear his eyes away from the angel’s blue ones.
,” Cas said.
“Not after last time,” Bobby said, escorting a complaining Gabriel down to the basement. “Jo put a bed in there, you’ll love it.”
“Cas, please,” Dean said, once he could tell that he was sufficiently prepared. “Now’s good.”
“Why bother? Haven’t we all made out with each other?” Jo said.
Sam opened his mouth as if to argue more, but closed it uselessly as he saw that Ruby was already gone. He turned to give Dean a once over.
“It makes me sad that you don’t think you deserve what Sam has,” Cas said, determined to get his point across even if it killed him. “If you ask me, you deserve all that and more. I… I love you, Dean.” He realized what he’d just said, and felt immediate embarrassment. “I love all of you.”
“Oh yes,” Dean said. “This is the first time in years the timing has been right. Let’s go.”
Cas nodded in baffled encouragement.
The wind howled harder, chilling Dean to the bone, as the doors to the warehouse all flew open at the same time. The next time Dean blinked, a person had appeared. A somewhat familiar person.
SAM/LUCIFER
“Sam Winchester,” he said, licking his lips hungrily. “The things I’d do to you… but I can’t. It’s against orders.”
“That was close,” Dean said.
“Wait, Dean, look,” Sam said, pointing out at the cemetery. More demons were converging on the spot, and at least a few of the new arrivals seemed to have prisoners in tow, figures with bags over their heads. “It’s past 11:30. Do we make a move?”
“I need some water,” Dean said, squinting at the receipt. He was worried he wasn’t remembering everything properly -- there was a lot that he needed to get down.
“You do,” Dean said, leaning to kiss his abdomen. The angel was toned and well-muscled, whether because Cas did a lot of physical activity or because his vessel had, Dean wasn’t sure.
“Why are you with a

room has to be clean,” Dean muttered. “It’s not like she’s going to look into every room in this house. If we’re lucky, she’ll only be exposed to the bare minimum.”
He finally stopped in Bismarck, where he dumped the car and got a room at the cheapest motel he could see. His plan had been to clean himself up a bit and hopefully make himself look less suspicious, but Dean found that looking at himself -- his impossibly 29-year-old self -- in the blurry mirror was an unnecessarily uncomfortable experience, so he quickly abandoned any cleaning process that was too involved. He took off his sweaty clothes, clumsily rinsed the dirt off his skin, and put the clothes back on.
“It’s me, Bobby, I swear,” Dean said. “I got out of hell.”
“Do you actually want me to kiss you?” Dean said. Cas couldn’t read his tone.
“So it’s down to us,” Dean muttered. “Just us, just us…”
“Yep, got me there,” Dean said. “Hell is famously where bad things happen, so, yeah, I’m a little skeptical of anything claiming to be
in hell. I want him to choose me, so he can go back to being his true, authentic self. I mean, have you
“Well, yeah,” Dean said, surprised by the statement. “He saved me, twice.”
“Well, you seem to trust Castiel,” Michael said.
“Dean,” Cas finally said in a rough, quiet voice that Dean could feel in his bones. “Can I ask you a question?”
My name is Dean Winchester, I’m a hundred thirty years old and I’m…
more thing you wanted to say?”
They didn’t discuss the fight again. Castiel had been right, anyways -- there were so many cases to take that Bobby couldn’t keep up, calling them before they’d even wrapped up a single case, and often sending them each off on different cases. Between the caseload and the continuing nightmares about hell, Dean didn’t feel a moment of rest for the next month.
"That's not true," Dean mumbled.
“I’ve wanted to do that for so long,” Dean said, darting in for another quick, sloppy kiss. “And you’re trying to tell me that you have, too?”
“No dirty girl scouts,” Sam said. “Are we all clear on our assignments?”
SAM/LUCIFER
“But now untold quantities of people will die, thanks to Lucifer,” Cas said in distress. “We
to be on Lucifer’s side, you know. Lucifer’s got him chained for now, but if you can track Death down, you might find that he’s more sympathetic than you think. He despises these earthly squabbles, considers them beneath him.
Hmm. Nice vessel, man.
“Hey, I have an idea,” Dean said, voice low. “Do you want to fuck me?”
CASTIEL
“Let her go, Sam,” Dean interjected.
“I still can’t believe you won on a technicality,” Gabriel muttered.
Gil nodded and picked up the tattoo gun again. Lost in the soothing buzzing sounds, Dean wondered about the handprint. He had none of his hell scars anymore, or even any of his pre-hell scars, so the handprint was curious indeed. The one who had rebuilt his earth body had clearly wanted him to see it -- that much was obvious, though the reason
“Pretty good for your first time, Cas,” Dean said.
“A baby?” Sam said. “Probably not a possession, then.”
“I wouldn’t be opposed,” Cas said. “But… you don’t have to tell me anything you don't want to.”
That dangerous line of thinking led Cas to picture how
GABRIEL
“Find God is plan B?” Dean said. “I would have thought there would be at least one more plan before fucking
“She just dropped dead?” Dean said. “How?”
“The ants would have a field day,” Jo said.
“Where is God?” Cas said determinately. “You have clearly been on earth for some time, and God isn’t in heaven, so he must be here as well. Where is he?”
Later that night, the younger constituents of the party (so, everyone except Bobby and Sam, who apparently had aged several decades from the stress of the week) were drunk and giggling on the floor, enjoying what had started as peppermint cocktails and morphed into straight whiskey as everyone stopped caring.
“Oh,” Sam said idly. “Death.”
In the distance, it looked as though hostages were switching hands and being arranged in some deliberate way. A large fire was burning in the center of the circle.
“It was an angel,” Dean said. “I saw its true form when I was in hell. There’s nothing else it could have been.”
. When did he become such a bleeding heart, huh?”
I -- I don’t see how that would be relevant.
“Regrettably,” Cas said.
comes in. What’s plan A, anyways?”
“Why were you pretending to be a trickster god?” Dean said.
“Okay,” Cas said quickly.
A PRODUCER cuts in, telling them to start talking about more “TV-ready” content.
“You--” Dean began.
“Wait, Cas--” Dean said, but Cas was already gone.
“Go away, Michael,” Dean said.
“What side is that?” Dean asked. “I’m getting kind of confused. Lucifer wants to end the world, which is bad, but then it sort of seems as though Michael and Gabriel
"You won't lose me." Dean said, but he actually didn't know it he meant it. How could he be so fucking sure.
Dean woke up sometime in the morning. The sun was already shining slightly through his window and he heard some birds
"You promised to talk to me." Cas said disappointed as Dean sat down on Cas' couch. His hands were dangled between his tights and he watched them. Cas was leaning against the wall.
"Did for a while." the other one answered honestly and Dean crosses his arms even tighter. "Listen, I don't care. I mean, I actually do but I don't think anything bas about you. I don't think that you are crazy or weird. And I certainly don't think that you are stupid. It's just... we all have our shit and all our way to deal with it. And if you want to talk or just drop that mask for one single minute, I'm here."
The three guys said something to each other in Spanish before looking to Dean who popped the hood. “Now, there’s gas in the tank, right?” he asked, and the guy beside him nodded. “Well, let’s check the fuel pressure,” he continued. He ran inside to get his tool kit and got to work. About a half hour later, the problem was solved. The three of them whispered back and forth in Spanish and one got out his wallet and shoved several bills toward Dean, but Dean wouldn’t take it. They all smiled, said a few more things Dean didn’t understand except for “gracias,” clapped him on the back, and were on their way. It felt good to help people.
In the past Dean would have brushed off Sam’s words with something like, “No chick flick moments, bitch,” but instead Dean surprised Sam with another bear hug and said, Thanks, Sammy. Thanks for everything.”
When the doorbell rang, Cas rose to pay for the pizza since he was the only one with cash in the house these days. Sam turned to Dean, his face doing that twitchy thing it did when he didn’t know how his words would be received. Dean smiled to see the expression. Still his same old Sammy. He said in a low voice, “Um, Cas is...interesting.”
She didn’t say anything for enough time as she fiddled with the things behind the counter that he knew he wouldn’t like what came out of her mouth next. “I’d love to help you, but I’m broke right now.” The fact that she was no longer looking him in the eye showed she was lying. Dean knew she was loaded, not just because she owned her own business, but because she was her daddy’s little princess. According to Carmen, he was rich and had gifted her the salon in the first place.
Carmen hesitated for a beat then said, “Sure, little bro, c’mere.” Amara released Carmen so she and Cas could embrace.
“Listen, I’m really trying to be a better credit card person,” Dean pleaded.
“Mmm,” Dean agreed, feeling the pull of sleep.
“Thank you, your Honor,” Marv said with a little bow, before packing up his mess of papers into his battered briefcase. “So long, boys,” he said to Sam and Dean before scurrying out of the courtroom without a backward glance.
“Look, Mrs. Winchester,” the doctor continued. “Dean passed all the neuro checks. He says he remembers the event. There’s no nausea or vomiting. He just hasn’t eaten in almost a week. I can order a CT scan or give you a referral to a neurologist, but I really don’t think it’s necessary. He seemed fine once he got that, right?” she said, pointing to the IV needle taped to the back of Dean’s hand.
The edge of the woods was three blocks from the house, but when they got there, Dean felt as if he’d been on a long journey. There was no trail into the woods, but the trees were spaced widely enough that Dean could just step off the sidewalk onto the pine-needle-covered forest floor. He weaved between tall evergreens, moving deeper into the quiet of the woods. Cas trailing behind. Although he knew the trees in these woods weren’t that tall, right now they seemed to tower over him, their viridescent branches undulating in the breeze far, far away, but then all of a sudden a branch was right there, and all he had to do was reach out and touch it. The pine needles felt simultaneously rough and soft, and he spent some time running his fingers over them, releasing their intense fragrance. He sank down to the ground and lay back, surrendering himself to the beam of sunlight breaking through the foliage. The cloudless sky above receded and the branches descended toward him. He closed his eyes and felt his body sink into the earth.
Dean didn’t feel like he could walk and talk at the same time, so he waited until Cas settled him seated back in the nest to say, “I think I’m ok.”
Dean felt a wave of sorrow rush through him knowing that his little brother hadn’t told him any of this before, hadn’t asked him for help. How far they had shifted since they were kids when Dean was Sam’s rock, his savior. “I’m so, so sorry I wasn’t there to help you, Sammy,” Dean said. “I’ve gotta meet this Professor Mills and give her a thank you gift.”
“Which brother, and what’s ‘awhile’?” Dean asked. He’d never been able to keep track of all her fucked up family members. Her dad got around, and it seemed like she had dozens of siblings, half-siblings, and step-siblings. It was unbelievable to him that they all knew each other and mostly kept in touch, but he guessed they’d all bonded over their dad being a skeevy asshole. Back in high school it was inevitable that Dean and Carmen became a couple--they were both pretty on the outside and screwed up on the inside, Dean with his dead mom and alcoholic dad, and Carmen with her tweaker mom and perv dad. Neither of them had any money or self-respect, but they could hang out, smoke dope, feel each other up, and not judge one another. They were a legit couple, and after high school, they even got kind of respectable. They both had jobs, got married at the courthouse, and were able to buy a two-bedroom tract house when they were 24. Their neighborhood kind of sucked, and they were always in debt, but the fact that they owned a house was a source of pride for both of them.
She looked taken aback by what she saw. “What are you doing, Cas?”
Benny huffed, looking like he was losing patience. “Your car, man. Your car. The car,” he said.
“I think he’s around nineteen now,” she said. “He said he was living on an ashram or something, but that he didn’t like it there anymore.”
“Knock knock,” Amara announced as they let themselves in and walked toward the kitchen. As usual, she was wearing a tight mini-skirt, this time with a zebra print, and on top she wore a fitted red leather jacket.
Dean yanked his hands back. “Just stay the fuck away from me, alright?” As he stormed out the door, he knew their little affair was over, and if it weren’t for the fact that he still had no way to get Baby back, he would have been relieved. He suspected Carmen had preempted him and told Amara behind his back not to lend him the money. Now he was furious at both women, and he didn’t even have his car to go to one of the bars across town for a hook-up. As he got on the stupid bus and walked past a disheveled guy sleeping across three seats, it was like a glowing ball of fury had grown in Dean’s core. Something in him was going to explode.
“What happened?” Sam asked, still sounding worried.
He almost asked if any of them could give him a loan, but he knew none of them had that kind of money. He only knew one person who did.
He got faster until Dean groaned loudly and came. Dean shivered more than before and he felt Cas come and ride it out until he pulled away and threw himself on the bed next to Dean. Dean had a hand in his hair, cum over his stomach and chest and if he didn't know any better, he would think he was about to die.
Cas responded and Dean thought about it.
"What's going on?" Cas wanted to know carefully and Dean looked up slightly.
"Doesn't your granny get scared if you have a guy with you overnight?" Dean asked with a sassy smile.
"Dean, it's me." Cas said softly.
Honestly, Dean wasn't sure if he was mad at his father. Dean didn't want a fucking fresh start. He saw no reason for one. He wasn't ready.
"The people were weird." Sam admited after he was sure that their father couldn't hear them. "Towards me."
Faster than Dean could think, Cas stood right in front of him and put his lips on his. Dean was surprised, but not against it. His hands were on Dean's hips, whereupon Dean laid his slowly on Cas shoulder.
It was a kind of offer that sounded much better in Dean's head. Cas moved closer and kissed his forehead.
Dean would freak out, go crazy, and all because of him. Because he wanted Cas too much, more than anything else in this world. Could he wish for anything, no matter what, it would be him.
"Because I understand it." he said after a while and Dean swallowed. "I was like that too some time ago."
A girl, Dean was sure her name was Meg, turned to Castiel and asked him something that he affirmed.
"I don't want to tell you. I don't know it myself." his father said honestly and Dean understood nothing.
"I know." Cas said naturally. "Just wanted to know if you're okay. You didn't reply to any messages."
Dean was there, somewhere really far away in his thoughts. He didn't feel anything, he couldn't focus. But when the nurse said this sentence, he looked up. He still felt as if he were in a tunnel. Sealed off from everyone else.
"Please, shut up." Dean interrupted him faster than he could think about it and squeezed his eyes shut. "You don't understand this."
Dean swallowed hard. He wondered if the small scar above Cas' eyebrow came from that or if it was an innocent scar from childhood.
He was tired. Dean closed his eyes and tried not to think about what the hell was going on with him. Actually, Dean just wanted to go away, somewhere where it didn't hurt. Where everything was okay, where he was safe from all the evil thoughts and the pain.
"You have great grandparents." Dean mentions and Cas nodded with a little smile.
Dean hadn't hurt himself in the entire week. It suprised him. Maybe he was too busy with his, well, friends? In the evening he often texted with Cas, but mostly it was about the trip they were on right now. Nothing special.
"I'm afraid to lose you, Dean. Don't you get it?" Sam muttered almost angrily, because Dean really didn't seem to understand.
"I know, Dean." John nodded.
"Well, last night." He started.
“Excuse me?” he said and looked to Carmen.
“Should I be?” Dean asked and then started laughing.
“I think that’s best,” Carmen said coldly.
Dean realized his jeans were wet for the first time. “I guess I pissed myself?”
Sam shut the laptop and said, “So where am I gonna crash?” eyeing the couch that was at least a foot too short for him. Dean led him to the room where Cas used to sleep and was touched to see that Cas had already set up a makeshift bed for his brother on the floor.
After Amara was gone, he took a shower, got dressed, and headed into their little garage to visit Baby. The ‘67 Chevy Impala was his life. She had been his dad’s, but it was Dean who kept her in mint condition, and since his dad drank himself to death five years ago, Baby was his. She had gotten him his job at Crowley’s Restoration and Repair. Crowley, the temperamental owner, had been so impressed with Dean’s skills that he was willing to overlook his record and lack of formal certification, but he said he’d toss Dean out on his ass if he ever came to work drunk or got out of line in any other way. Six years later and he still had the job restoring classic cars. No benefits, but he made decent money and loved his work and his crew of friends there. Dean knew how to keep his work and his vices separate.
After that, they must have fallen asleep, because when he woke up in Cas' arms, the room was flooded with sunlight. He felt Cas' hand go through his hair and he lost himself in the feeling.
They weren't okay.
Dean was weird since then, understandably weird and Cas noticed.
"He gets his stomach pumped out." John repeaded.
Dean had set up his old bed, closet and his desk alone. He had noticed his father standing in the doorway for a moment, probably wanting to ask him if he should help, but Dean paid him no attention. He was alone and busy, with his thoughts completely on the matter and he didn't want anyone else with him.
It was warm, something Dean could focus on, so he did. Cas' warmth kept him here, in this reality. Dean wondered what would have happened if he wouldn't have told Cas. Where would his mind be then?
"Everything will be okay, I just know that." Sam said after a while and Dean just looked at him for a while until he nodded.
His father had every right to be mad at him. Dean knew that. He was stubborn and maybe even selfish if he was honest with himself.
But then Dean realized he couldn't say it. He didn't want to say it out loud. You couldn't bring something like that up "normally.
"Same. Then there are four of us. Welcome to the family, you are an official member now." A sad laugh left both of them.
"Will you try then?" Dean didn't want to. He really didn't. He didn't respond. "I've also been to the therapy before."
Cas and Dean had been together for almost two months and they reall weren't good at hiding it. John knew it, Cas' grandparents knew it. His dad knew it. They talked to him once through skype and Cas introduced them. He was nice.
"Why do you tell dad that you don't talk to people? I saw you sitting with these guys today." Sam asked. It was justified question.
"Jesus Christ." Dean laughed and buried my blushing face in his hands.
And it seemed to Dean that they didn't expect anything from each other. To be honest, Dean expected absolutely nothing from Cas. No great speech, no body contact, just nothing. And Dean found that it made things so much easier.
"Dad said you slept at a friends house." Sam started. "The guy that was here?"
And for a brief moment, even Dean believed it. It was okay.
"You too." Dean countered.
"Just say it." Dean pressured him and felt like his own heart beat got faster.
He just wanted to be okay.
Then he left the room again and left Dean alone, whereupon he laid down again. Dean didn't need anything, no coffee, no tea, no food. Simply disappearing would do him good now. Having nothing to do with the whole thing would do him really fucking good.
Castiel would stick on him, Dean knew that.
"Okay."
"Not really, thanks." he said and averted his gaze. He looked down at his tray so he wouldn't have to see Castiel's face. He might change his mind.
"That won't happen." Dean said fast.
"Are you staying with me?" Dean asked automatically at some point. It was one of his biggest fears at this moment. Cas looked at him in confusion for a moment, until he understood the question. He leaned over and kissed Dean's forehead.
