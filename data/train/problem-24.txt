The potato blight a decade later caused a great famine among the Scottish population which made work very hard for John as many people were suffering from typhus and cholera. Having faced death so many times now, he had become hard and unfeeling to get through this bad time. He didn’t socialise anymore, nor did he make friends. The only thing that got him going was caring for his patients and helping them survive.
John surveyed the wall, eyes gliding across the pictures as he processed the new information. If MacCafferty was as addicted as the Countess made it sound, they needed to gain access to one of these communities and look for him as insiders.
Suddenly John stopped and closed his eyes to empower his other senses. His brows creased in concentration as he drowned out the birds and unnecessary voices. With his sight blocked out, Sherlock’s enticing smell was nearly too much for John but he pushed past his urge to scent his neck and was able to not only make out Sherlock’s rather loud respiration but also a very subtle breathing beyond one of the doors on their right-hand side. He snapped his eyes open, met Sherlock’s curious stare and pointed to the second door on their right.
William, however, didn’t calm down. “We can’t, sire! Entire streets are burning and it’s spreading, fast! There are reports that one of ours started it, feeding off a baker and somehow… I’m not clear on the details, but the bakery went up in flames and it’s spreading, fast.”
At that point, his son merely nodded. Days passed before he brought the topic up again, when they were once again alone. John answered all of Hamish’s questions, talked about his weeks with the Council and how he had obtained a permit to fill Hamish in.
"Yet given the lady’s absence and Miss Hooper’s stellar qualifications, I am sure diverging from protocol will be acceptable," Sherlock immediately rebuked, completely calm and reasonable. He was playing a part, John noticed, and playing it rather well.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow, thoroughly amused that his younger sibling of all people was warning him against being too confident. "I assume you have a suggestion?"
"Miss Irene Adler had the 'pleasure' of meeting someone who had information on his followers who provided information about his plans. Said informant didn’t give a name but we all have heard rumours about something dark stirring in the cold north."
He didn’t approach the woman right away, opting instead for a detour to pour some more milk into his cup. He saw the slender line of the woman’s shoulders tense as he walked towards her table, though she remained where she was.
"Do not play coy, Miss Adler," Sherlock cautioned, "it does not become you. You know exactly who I am."
“Oh, Sean,” she sighed dramatically and went over to the white sofa in her living room where she sat down. “He’s a womaniser – a rich one at that. You probably know already if you are working with him. He likes to get his women presents and spoil them. It doesn’t matter if they’re humans or vampires. There’s even a rumour he tried to seduce a banshee but no one believed him.”
John had rarely been so nervous in his life. He had seen the exact moment Bill had pieced the clues together. He would have talked to John's superiors by now and any moment they would barge into the hospital room and take him into custody.
He flinched back as if scolded, glad that Sherlock was too busy grumbling complaints at having to get clean. John stood, frozen, in the room until Mrs Hudson’s return jostled him back to reality.
John blinked at the sudden non-sequitur. This had to be the most obvious change in topic he had ever witnessed, especially from Sherlock. If the man was indeed this ruffled, it was probably best to give him time and ask again later.
“Listen, Hamish,” John tried again, “I’m sure you heard the talk. People wondering about why I don’t age, why my hair doesn’t turn grey… This is why. I shall never grow old. Not in appearance, that is. And, unless someone slays me with the necessary means, I shall never die.”
"Well, you’re not exactly a mountain of muscle and we are ten times stronger than the average human," John shot back. He had seen those of his kind crush skulls with their bare hands – there was no way he would leave Sherlock alone with one of them who was sure to meet them with hostility.
"Baker Street? Really? You can afford a flat in Marylebone? A one-bedroom flat must be more than two thousand quid a month," John said in awe, wondering what kind of profession Sherlock was pursuing.
Just then Mrs Hudson returned, urging Sherlock to shed his mud-caked clothes. John stood back, watching the proceedings in case Sherlock lost his balance as he shimmied out of his trousers. It was only when John’s eyes were drawn to the boy’s bare chest that he realised what he had been doing.
The time at the Council changed John more profoundly than his Sire’s bite ever could. He learnt of the vampires’ struggles to stay hidden, to conceal their identity, of revolts and insurgences trying to change the status quo. Estrode and his colleagues explained the workings of the Council, how they regulated the number of humans falling victim to vampires, and how to drink from a human without killing them and using a thrall to make them forget the incident.
John didn’t dare whisper anything to Sherlock since Victoria’s heightened senses would allow her to eavesdrop. Instead, John let his thumb rub soothing circles into Sherlock’s skin through the layers of clothing. Once again Sherlock tensed, but relaxed into the touch a rapid heartbeat later.
"Did it occur to you, Agent Lively, that the fact that we have yet to do that means the woman in question is currently on the run?" he asked instead, his tone enough to chastise the operative.
What they did yield were lessons in self-control. Sherlock had hoped he would grow accustomed to the sight of John Watson in tight leather and fabric, but to no avail. The image had yet to lose its effect on Sherlock's mind, which was circling back to bulge in the other man's trousers, the broad, strong lines of his shoulders or the firmness of his arms.
Gabriel decided to join the fight to fight for equality and John let him go, realising that he was probably going to lose the only friend he had made in many years. The depression that held Europe in its grip afterwards was just the next omen for the war that came. This time, the Vampire community in Germany arose from the ashes like a big bad bat and threatened to put all humans into slavery and make them food for all vampires. That was even too much for the other nations and John once again took up arms to prevent the worst.
The vigilantes would end up killing more people than the fire, he thought bitterly as he pressed a cloth to his arm. John was hidden from view in an abandoned backyard, only a few droplets of blood on the ground giving away his journey from the street to here.
"And hidden the fact that you still live in the quarters my brother organised for you?" Sherlock shot back, but his voice was tinged with mirth. He glanced around once more, then shook his head. "You will be moving as soon as we are back from this mission."
The cab took them back to Baker Street, neither of them speaking a word during the ride. John felt itchy. He wanted to get out of these clothes as quick as possible, preferably accompanied by a good shower. His body was prickling all over. Those four days in close proximity of Sherlock had strung his nerves a little too tight. He could keep it under control but he wondered for how long. All that smell of blood in the club had clawed at him to take what he considered his.
Then the riots started and the world descended into chaos once more, only this time it was worse than before and in the end, John’s life was forever changed.
For a long time he sat in his small house in Glasgow, staring at the wall and wondering whether he should go on or end his miserable life. Every friend he made would die after a certain time and he couldn’t bear losing more people who were dear to him. In the end, the decision to stay by himself was easy, though he would not have thought his isolation to last quite as long as it did.
The previous tenants had moved away several months ago, but John had told Mrs Hudson not to look for new ones since he would be returning soon. So it came to a big surprise to hear movement inside the house when he opened the door. His eyes immediately darted around the room, looking for anything he might use as a weapon, only to be fundamentally waylaid when the source of the noise appeared in the doorway to the living room.
Victor Trevor died eventually of substance abuse and his death pulled Sherlock out of his horrible habit. He went to seek help with his brother who instantly put him into a drug rehabilitation clinic. He spent two years there until he was discharged. It was also his brother who saw his skill of deduction – after all, he was gifted too – and introduced him to Greg Lestrade, an officer at New Scotland Yard at that time, who worked for the Criminal Record Office.
It was shortly before his fifteenth birthday; Christmas was already over, when Sherlock showed up late on John's doorstep. It was snowing lightly, the white flakes catching the light of the streetlamps while clinging to Sherlock's brown curls and blue coat.
Victoria had her eyes closed for a moment, licking her lips reverently to catch every trace of Sherlock’s blood. Then she opened them again but her eyes, which had been nearly dark with just a thin stripe of colour around the iris, were now a noticeable dark green shade. John could positively feel Sherlock’s question, but the detective remained silent.
It was like a dam had broken after that. Whenever Diane and John could make the time, they would meet up. They didn’t lie together every time; sometimes they merely enjoyed each other’s company. Before long John knew he had fallen for this woman just as fiercely as he had for Mary in her time.
“You want to, what, teach me?” John asked, somewhat daringly. The despair that had consumed him moments ago seemed to vanish slightly.
“Off now; be good to your mother.” John ruffled Hamish’s hair, earning himself an exasperated sigh, and watched as his wife and child pulled the cart down the street, joining the masses that had the same idea.
Of course, it couldn’t stay like that forever. At the end of the nineteenth century, there was a revolt among the vampires living in Northern Europe, a revolt that was carried by the idea of unveiling their secret and taking over the human world. Out of a blind rage, many innocent humans were killed in several massacres, even women and children, which gained huge attention from the Vampire Council but also the human leaders of the European nations. They sent investigators to find out the reason for the huge bloodshed, never expecting the revelation that was about to come. The Vampire Council arranged a meeting with all European leaders and took the greatest step in vampire history – they revealed their true nature. No one wanted to believe them at first, but when one creature picked up a president and slammed him into a wall, baring his fangs that could grow at will, any doubts fell silent. All of the leaders were intimidated, many of them frightened and others outraged that the vampires had hidden away for so long. They argued about eradicating them because they felt inferior, but others suggested to let them continue as they had before, intending to fulfil their wishes of acknowledgment and prevent the continued bloodshed.
John's only response was another nod, but then his left arm wound itself around Sherlock's waist. "Good?"
Mrs Hudson hugged him tight and wished him well before he got into a cab and headed off. He went back to his sister and settled down in Liverpool where he opened a small practice. It wasn't easy to push his memories of Sherlock away but with time he managed, although it left a gap in his heart which he kept tucked away from everyone.
But Sherlock deserved better. John refused to let the first time he drank from the man be in the course of a case.
Sherlock could feel the blush creeping up his neck and shrugged his shoulders to play it off. Compliments from John still had this unexpected effect on him.
John laughed and promised to bring him a souvenir before walking away, certain that a bit of space would do both of them good.
Watching the setting sun and the display of orange and red behind his curtains, John absentmindedly sipped his drink. What would happen tomorrow? Would there be any chance for him to get Sherlock to talk to him or would they just tag along with the others and ignore each other?
When he found Harry, his sister was strung out on drugs of unknown nature, though John suspected it was one of the newer designer products that had flooded the American market recently.
Once in a while there were some of them who became fed up with their situation and daring enough to fight against the unspoken rules of staying in hiding. These tensions resulted in nasty wars among them, wars that were perceived by humans as a fight between two countries that didn’t get along. They never guessed it wasn’t a war between humans.
"Just take it out," Osmond hissed – for it was a hiss, no other word for it – and presented his shoulder.
Sherlock pushed down the curiosity urging him to ask about John's motifs, yet the detective inside of him overrode the impulse. They were here to pursue a lead, after all – not to share a drink and exchange life stories.
"He prefers some other place on Thurdays. He says the pull's better there," Everhart added with a leer even as he manoeuvred his 'donor' into his lap. He traced the line of her neck with a finger, whispering something into her ear that made her blush furiously. "But I know a contact who might be able to help you find him. She frequents the café
John's absence left a hole in Sherlock's heart. He was glad he had created a room for John in his mind palace, so whenever he felt very lonely, he went there and relived fond memories of his childhood. He felt very embarrassed about asking Mycroft to help him trace John in America and although his brother used his contacts to find John, he couldn't get any information on him. John had literally disappeared and Sherlock was now even more convinced that he was a vampire and that his fellows had helped to wipe away any trace of him. That revelation made him incredibly sad and desperate. He wondered if the new job in the States had been the real reason for his departure or if John had stayed in the United Kingdom. John had been his only friend, the only one who understood and listened to him. Why did he have to leave?
He himself rarely frequented establishments such as Fangtasia, a global chain of vampire bars, but sometimes he had to attend meetings in such places (meetings of the shadier kind, that is). It was always a fascinating experience to see his fellow vampires lose themselves in the kind of ecstasy that had never really held much appeal for Estrode, not even when he was human, which explained why he had remained childless all his life. But not even he could resist fresh blood when it was so willingly given, so he occasionally indulged, leaving the blood bags in his fridge a little while longer.
"Oh, Sherlock.” John regarded him for a moment, his face a picture of conflicting thoughts, until one finally won out. "You look like you need a hug."
John didn’t look back. Estrode had allowed him to contact him in the future, yet other than that John had no intention of returning. All he wanted was to see his wife and son again, so he squared his shoulders and left the Council, disappearing into the labyrinth of London’s streets.
John, Sherlock and Molly remained behind while the two agents took over, Sterling producing a piece of paper from the inside of his jacket. John strained his ears – which was not particularly difficult, seeing as his targets were only about ten metres away – and listened to Sterling explaining the story behind their warrant. The document was fake, of course, hurriedly crafted in the back of the car. Their swiftness had made John wonder if Sterling and Trevelyan were in a habit of forging official government papers.
“He was,” he said kindly. “It’s great to hear he’s feeling much better. It was my pleasure to help.”
John lost track of time as he was crouched next to the woman’s drained body. He only looked up when he caught a sound in the distance, unnaturally far away yet still reaching his ears.
Silence fell. John weighed his options but his senses told him that Sherlock needed rest. Regardless of how curious John was, any answers could wait.
It was obvious that Everhart was sceptical about his story and reluctant to give John any information.
At that he lifted an eyebrow at his audience, daring them to negate his words. John had to admit that he hadn’t had a clue about anything "dark in the north" as he had been too busy killing off idiot vampires and humans in Afghanistan.
John gathered her too thin form into his arms and carried her out of the decaying building and into his rented car. He drove carefully until they reached the local Council in Manaus, a city with two million inhabitants and quite a Vampire population. It took three days for Harry to open her eyes. Any human would have died, but thankfully there was no such thing as drug overdose for vampires.
had always been Magnussen’s motto and he went about acquiring it ruthlessly. Humans thought his news agency had simply been passed from father to son for three centuries, but the Council knew better. Estrode wouldn’t go as far as to say Magnussen had them under his control, but it was a precarious situation with a very fine balance.
“I am not the only one responsible for the formation of this unit, Sherlock. I don't have that kind of power."
John's stomach sank. Whatever he had felt at meeting Sherlock again after so many years had dissipated before it could bloom into more.
Yet all good things end sooner or later, and this case was no different. Bill had seen what happened to rorty soldiers, had treated their wounds in battle when no medic was around, had seen them cry as the life left them.
Sherlock, who had got goosebumps from John's gentle touch, knew that this was a wild guess. Not even he could tell if it was really a habit of some vampires to do that. But John must have his reasons and although they weren't very close (that had been a long time ago) he trusted John.
He found a nice little house close to where Mrs Hudson had moved and started working at the local hospital. He spent nearly every evening with the small family – Mycroft only came home on the weekends as he was enrolled at his school until he turned eighteen – and watched Sherlock grow up.
They had existed since the beginning of humankind and had kept their identity a secret from the very moment they knew they wouldn’t be accepted. They were aware of people’s fear of them and to prevent extinction, they mingled with them and became as invisible as possible to the human eye. Nothing gave them away. Neither skin colour, nor hair colour, not eyes or speech. They became masters of deception and managed to survive until this very day. You wouldn’t even realise you passed them on the street. You would even be shocked that they made up one quarter of the human population on earth.
John glanced at Sherlock, whose eyes were narrowed and focussed on the countess. He nodded, as if to confirm her sincerity.
Yet he invited her into his house again and again, the accidental touches becoming more frequent and especially longer in their duration. Diane relished the conversations they shared, basking in the attention and John couldn’t resist showering her in compliments, praising her in ways he knew her husband never did.
This time it took the vampire longer to regain his composure, to stop his hands from trembling. Sherlock wished he could reach out and provide comfort, yet he feared the gesture would only make it worse.
“Thank you.” Estrode nodded, put a few pounds down before getting up. “Enjoy your drink, Mr Magnussen, and your stay here.”
Now, however, a few days later, the room was dark and the candles almost burnt to stumps. Some still had more wax than others, which got Sherlock wondering which conditions led to this effect. Minutes later he was going through the drawers, trying to remember where Mrs Hudson kept the spare candles but, of course, Sherlock hadn’t saved this information and deleted it, unaware that it would be of interest for an experiment later on.
"Brilliant," was all John managed to say, before he forcibly shook his head and stopped staring at his former friend who was brimming with pride over his deductions yet had chosen to abstain from recounting them in detail.
"Not a lie, do not even try to deny it," Sherlock interrupted the man’s desperate attempt to cover his employer’s transgressions. "You shall allow us to inspect the portraits and leave us in peace and none of this will ever reach the press. Do we have an understanding?"
. Sherlock took a deep breath, casting about for an adequate place to start. He wanted to make a good impression, but he didn’t want to lie either. Not to John.
Before John could speak up, however, someone at the other end of the room called for silence and ordered them to take their seats. Sherlock immediately left John's side and sat down far away from him.
Yet after John’s last letter it was a different situation. He had spoken at length about a new family that had moved to his neighbourhood, their two sons - three and ten years old.
"You don’t have to say anything, my dear. They could be lying," he said. "Prove that you are Irene’s friends," he demanded.
Under the disguise of leaving the country for a job in the States, John bid goodbye to the Holmes and Hudsons. Sherlock was visibly angry about it and refused to acknowledge John's departure. The last time John saw him for many years, he was waving up to Sherlock's window on the first floor with the boy turning around and disappearing into the room, his face hard as stone.
"John Watson?" one of them, tall and black, broad shoulders, asked. John swallowed and nodded. There was no use asking how they knew his real name. A description of him would have sufficed for any member of the Council to identify him.
“I appreciate your bluntness. Allow me to return it,” John said. “There is a special substance circulating among our kind. Sean promised me access to it – and now he’s gone. What can you tell us about that?”
John saw Sherlock’s hands twitch where they were holding the china. Yes, she was lying through her teeth. John didn’t need the country’s best detective to tell him that.
As quick as they had come, they headed back to the car again, leaving a bewildered butler behind. This time, John sat down in the passenger seat since Molly fit much better in the back. Sterling and Trevelyan certainly didn’t mind at all.
“It would be our pleasure to invite you for dinner one day,” she said, turning to go. “Have a good day, Dr Watson.”
"Good evening," John greeted, meeting the slanted eyes of the man. "May we share the sofa with you?"
"Want to start fresh?" was what he came up with, causing Sherlock to narrow his eyes in obvious confusion. "I mean, let the past be the past?"
Only when he analysed the pills, which had been used to kill the vampires, did he find out that they consisted of several toxic components he had never seen in this concoction. Knowing that his little brother was working the case, Mycroft got all this information and forwarded them to the Council.
Judging by the light that penetrated the thick rainclouds covering the sky, he guessed it must be early afternoon and so he ran along the path in search of people and houses he was familiar with. He only met destroyed homes but not a soul. Everything was burned to the ground, the smell of burned flesh and wood biting into his nose.
With monumental effort, Sherlock took a deep breath. On the exhale, most of the tension left his body and a blush rose in his cheeks. That baffled John more than the location Victoria had provided.
, of course you bloody did.” John laughed quietly and the sound warmed something in Sherlock’s chest.
Unfortunately, his strict father did not like how Sherlock was spending all of his time recently. He never allowed Sherlock to go over to visit John at his house and have some fun playing pretend, rather he demanded him to grow up and stop the silly pirate games. Mycroft always just raised an eyebrow at his little brother who cried when he found the garden door locked. Sometimes his mother would get the key and let him out but when his father found out that Sherlock had attempted to climb over the fence to John’s adjacent garden, he grounded him and didn’t let him see the man for a long time, literally forcing his wife to make the awkward visit and go over to his house to have tea with him. Awkward, in that John was yet to marry and her presence in his home would surely ignite rumours amongst the neighbours.
It came as a surprise to him that Sherlock had apparently pushed his resenting feelings aside for whatever reasons. Could it really be because he had realised how much it mattered to him that John was back? A sly smile spread on his lips.
Their life was peaceful and happy and one day, Mary told him that she was pregnant again, surprising John who hadn’t expected his wife to become pregnant with his child when he was a vampire.
"If you care for a swim, I’m certain I can handle Miss Somervell on my own," Sherlock suggested, his voice tinged with sarcasm.
Sherlock’s cheeks coloured slightly, but other than that he did not acknowledge the comment. For the better, probably, John mused. They still had a way to go with the case so they couldn’t afford making it awkward too early on.
Well, the scowl of which John found himself at the receiving end definitely held some animosity, yet John doubted that Sherlock’s anger went as far as trying to hurt him.
“It is rare but not unheard of that humans give birth to healthy hybrids. Those are curious beings, John, with the most fascinating characteristics. They usually inherit all the positive genes of vampires and humans and are very sought after as marriage partners. Consider yourself lucky, John.”
Knebworth House does really exist. It’s a country house built in the 15th century in Hertfortshire, England and a Grade II listed building (= particularly important building of more than special interest). Numerous films have been shot there too, including Jane Eyre (1997), Harry Potter 4 and The King’s Speech. Unlike in the story, the house is open to visitors and Iriya had been there and felt inspired. :D
“You’re quite right but I’m not interested. I’m a business man, so I’m only interested in business. I wouldn’t know your real name either, so let’s not bother with that.” John gave her his most sincere smile that did funny things to Sherlock, so he hoped that the woman was persuaded in any way as well.
"Cleaning's boring," Sherlock declared, sounding as petulant as he did when he was younger. John's chest ached at the memory. He followed Sherlock upstairs to a second bedroom that had apparently been used as storage and would have to be tidied up for John to move in. It held a large wardrobe bursting with clothes. Sherlock rummaged through them for a moment and eventually produced something with a grin.
Mycroft would need to keep a closer eye on both his brother and the vampire. Solving crimes might have settled Sherlock somewhat, yet his impulsive tendencies still remained, and paired with a dark creature with an affinity for danger? That was a combination that courted trouble.
John got word from the Council a week after he had sent his letter and to his relief, his request had been approved. Hamish – now at the age of twenty-five – and he would sit together and talk quite frequently in the absence of his wife, providing ample opportunity for John to make his confession.
Thank you for reading and commenting. Please note that the next chapter will take awhile to be updated.
Magnussen was granted certain liberties, had been allowed to feed off humans even during bans, got away with heinous actions… and yet they needed him. He was a nuisance, granted, though also a helpful ally, especially in times of war, given his vast network of informants.
In the end, it was Sherlock who drove a sleek black jeep up to Knebworth House. Molly sat next to him on the passenger seat while John sat a little crammed in the back with the two operatives Sherlock had chosen. The two men were both tall and broad-shouldered, and John could see from their posture alone that they were truly capable agents. Yet where one was blond, Sterling, John thought he was called – the other, Trevelyan, had dark hair.
Hamish was still looking at him with wide, unbelieving eyes, so John turned to his last resort. It required a lot of concentration, since he had spent years repressing the urge to bare them in the vicinity of humans.
“Then at least shower. I’ll give you some spare clothes, and you can let the morons from SIS know that you’re probably not going to be back tomorrow night. They’ll be pestering us about an update soon – two annoying birds, one stone.”
"Oh, John, this would not be the first time I went up against one of you and walked away victorious," Sherlock sneered, by all appearances confident in his abilities, yet John noticed how his knuckles had whitened because he was gripping the steering wheel rather firmly.
After that, there was nothing left in London for John and his son but painful memories, so they left and settled down in a quiet town in Scotland where his family came from originally.
"I see you haven't learnt how to clean up in the past few years," John remarked, but he made sure to add a smile.
He was appalled at himself when he understood that he had been seduced by her blood, water and food not being enough to still his hunger. An unwanted and unnatural instinct drove him to bite and kill her, leaving him trembling and panicked afterwards when he looked at her lifeless body.
“So, how long ‘till I get my kitchen back?” John wondered, hoping against the odds that Sherlock might actually answer.
"I am still the only way you lot will be able to solve this before half the vampire population of Great Britain is starting to panic. And I doubt that would be a desirable outcome? After all, the humans might soon follow... if your reaction is not too late, and whoever is doing this intends to harm mortals as well, this might happen sooner than you think."
Moving to Glasgow turned out to have been a good decision. John became a well-known doctor who took care of the poorer population in his neighbourhood. Every now and then he went to visit his son, who only met him when his wife was out. He became a father in the same year John told him he was a vampire and presented his newborn son to him. As much as John wanted the baby to know that he was his grandfather, he decided to not see the child anymore when he turned five as he expected the little boy to notice that he wasn’t aging and he didn’t dare to ask the Council again to involve the child in his secret.
"Caring is not an advantage," he had said, leaving a bitter taste in Sherlock's mouth when he thought of it.
Barging into his life now with news about his sister would not only take him away from Chelsea and rob the area of a gifted doctor, but also cause John much personal suffering. Since if he actually managed to find his sister and persuade her to come with him, getting her back on her feet would be a task of monumental proportions.
"Hello, Sherlock," John greeted him with a warm smile. His hair was slightly damp from a shower and he was dressed in a dark green dressing gown. "It's quite late already. Is something the matter?"
John accepted, and Mycroft went his merry way. He was amused that nothing seemed to have changed between the two brothers since he saw them twenty years ago.
Peace settled down in Europe and John felt a heavy weight being lifted from his shoulders when his friend came back safely from the war. Britain had suffered hard from the enemy’s attacks on their major cities but it soon experienced prosperity again. Seduced by the big city’s anonymity and wealth, John turned his back on Scotland to return to London in the 1960s.
Victoria feigned thinking about it but it was clear to John that she would suggest something daring. He had already guessed by the way she had eyed Sherlock during their conversation.
“You are ready,” Estrode announced four weeks after taking John in. London was being rebuilt after the fire had consumed too many homes of too many innocent people. John heard rumours that the vampire responsible for the fire had been tried and sentenced to horrible suffering and a long time in the Council’s catacombs.
Something in his chest loosened at the sight but he needed more, needed to see the man. He rang the bell, eager for the door to open. When it did, John smiled warmly at him in his dressing gown and shower-damp hair.
He moved to Chelsea, a posh and affluent area in Central London, and bought a house in a side street of King’s Road. Gabriel also moved here, fell in love with a human woman he soon thereafter married and who gave him a child. For a decade, John’s life was dominated by routine as a local doctor until, one sunny day in 1978, a new family moved in next door.
They never seemed to remember that humans outnumbered their kind ten to one and were – as interhuman wars had proven – capable of great violence. Estrode had heard the kind of horror stories travelling creatures told of Italy, where the Church strung vampires up in broad daylight until, hours or even days later depending on how strong the victim was, the vampire perished. Immortality could have an end after all.
John gave a chuckle, pushing the fingers of his left hand into the curls at Sherlock's nape, indicating whom Sherlock belonged to. "Oh, he's got the habit of changing his numbers. He's a very private man."
John glanced at Sterling on his right who produced said papers and gracefully handed them over to the guard, even if he had to reach between the driver’s seat and the frame of the car.
John’s vision blurred around the edges when his attacker finally released him. He couldn’t move, didn’t have the strength. He had no choice but to watch the man flop onto his back, smiling, red fluid dripping down his chin and trickling down his cheeks.
She led the way – her flat was close, and even John could tell it spoke of new wealth. Sherlock had given him the faintest nod while leaving the café, but still John’s mind was racing to find a different way to make Victoria divulge the information. Then it occurred to him.
"Do you know what kind of drug he gave you?" he asked, shaking his head at the foolishness of some people who thought they needed drugs to get a certain kick in their life.
It took a long moment during which John had to force his eyes to remain on Sherlock’s face and not trail down his slender form, but eventually the detective nodded curtly.
The dead piled up during weeks of chaos and John felt helpless in the face of the Black Death. He wanted to flee, like the King and his Court had done, yet he and his family had no money to do so. So he stayed, trying to help where he could, the constant fear of contracting the Plague bringing him many sleepless nights.
He didn't give away that he had seen it to avoid making Sherlock feel caught in the act. He probably didn't even realise it.
A carriage took him to the south to the village of Dulwich where Mary’s parents owned a small cottage. Compared to London, the air and water here was fresh and clean and John hungered for his wife and son’s company, needing to see if they were alright. He wasn’t worried that they would see the change in him; his appearance hadn’t changed much, only that many old childhood scars had faded away and his skin looked very healthy and unblemished. The grey in his hair had also vanished, giving him a younger look. But still, those were minor things and he was sure that Mary would notice them but not discuss them as long as he came back safely.
It felt eerily good being insulted again after so many years without Sherlock’s sharp tongue, even though it still hurt a little, especially when all John could do was shrug miserably. It was better to be insulted instead of explaining the truth and that the Vampire Council wouldn’t have sanctioned Sherlock knowing about John’s true nature.
in danger you are," John continued. "All these vampires that have been killed were part of Moriarty’s circle but the plans he has for humankind and vampires were obviously supposed to stay secret. Everyone that blabbed was killed. We are here to get more information and to eventually catch Moriarty. So who talked to you?"
Instead of being heavily guarded, this house was apparently open to the public because several tourists were mingling about when they entered the car park in front of the manor. Another sign alerted them that the grounds were free of charge.
Everhart's dark eyes fell on him and a low chuckle escaped the feeding vampire while he made a shooing motion with his hand. As if struck by lightening, John got up quickly, his fingers on Sherlock's neck slipping to his shoulder and pulling the man with him.
It took a few seconds and for a moment John thought the man would argue, but eventually he nodded, welcoming them into the impressive mansion.
John was only half listening. His sensitive senses had already taken in the various states of emotions filling the room, mostly anticipation, eagerness, wariness, and boredom which emanated strongly from Sherlock. Soon after naming all his ranks and a short description of his own history, Brown was joined by Estrode and Mycroft, the latter of whom had been watching from the side, clad impeccably in an ash grey, bespoke suit and wearing a poker face. He came to a halt next to Brown and let his gaze sweep over the assembled crowd, assessing them quietly before he lifted his hand and called someone forward.
“Why don’t you sit down? I’ll take care of the drinks,” he offered, pleased at the surprised smile he received in return. Sherlock used the time he waited at the counter for their order to be prepared by trying to calm his pulse. He failed, obviously.
“She will need training as well as continuous therapy,” he told John, who didn’t argue. As a doctor he knew what these drugs did to a vampire’s restraint and self-control – namely, shattering it. Harry had to learn how to function again while John was on a different mission: put inappropriate thoughts of a certain young boy out of his mind. In the end it was four years before John deemed Harry ready to be left by herself and decided to return to his old house. Harry had flourished and even got herself a job and had been going out with a nice vampire girl named Clara for a while now. Clara technically was her superior at the Council, though the Vampire community had always been progressive and tolerated such relationships. John knew Harry was in good hands with her.
How severe would his punishment be? Would his friendship with Estrode be enough to save John from having his fangs pulled?
“We agreed to speak about Sean and his whereabouts and not about drugs,” she said a little petulantly. “I might be able to have some information on that if you care to give me some more blood.”
“Fine,” Victoria said, raising her hands in reassurance. “How about some tea, then to help your… friend replenish?”
Magnussen was not one of those. He had established one of the very first English newspapers in 1621, had become a vampire a few years later and had since plagued the Council’s existence as one of the most powerful men of the country, maybe even of Europe.
Sherlock gave him a small smile, remembering that as a teenager he had coaxed the same reaction from John whenever he had made a deduction. He still couldn’t stop being surprised about that. It had been far too long that someone voiced their appreciation about what he deduced.
However, John never thought to ask for permission to reveal his secret. He took great care to hide the things in his home specific to his nature and Diane never got suspicious, even though the bed looked like no one had slept in it for days and the fridge was half-empty all of the time. John had begun to store his blood bags in the cold basement.
"I have news?" John turned towards the door of their office at MI5 headquarters where Molly Hooper was fidgeting on the threshold.
It didn't take long until the projectile lay in Bill's palm, bloodied but unmistakeably a grey-white bullet, strange marking on the shell.
He swallowed hard in an attempt to soothe his nerves. He should have known. With Mycroft Holmes behind the formation of this unit it should not come as a surprise to see Sherlock here as well.
"I'm sorry," John murmured. "Thank you for your confidence. This club seems to allow vampires to bring their donors with them and feed on them in here. It's been quite a long while since I did that. I've stuck to bagged blood since the seventies…" His voice trailed off, leaving it to Sherlock to guess what could have been his reasons. "There's a man on the right in the corner with a very young woman. Maybe in her late teens. He could be the one we're looking for and if not perhaps he can tell us if he knows MacCafferty," John added, gently rubbing over the spot on Sherlock's arm where he squeezed too hard before dropping his hand in his lap.
Yet it stung, hearing her call him reckless and daft, wondering 'what would your parents think'. The last one was worst. Sherlock could not explain the pain he felt, could not deal with the situation. He ran out of the house and into the cold night, barely remembering to bring his coat.
The picture and the accompanying information proved what Estrode had long since suspected: Harriet Watson, after years of absence, had reappeared in England just in time for the invention of designer drugs for vampires. Whole nests of addicts existed throughout the country and the Council did their best to find them and clean them out if they were causing trouble. If not, they were left alone. Vampires who spend their immortality completely removed from reality in a haze of drugs, willing humans and sex didn’t hurt anyone and the Council really had better things to do.
John just rolled his eyes and disappeared with Sherlock behind a set of double doors at the end of the staircase. It was eerily quiet in the corridor they entered beyond. John’s sensitive hearing only picked up on the summer birds singing outside and some distant voices of the tourists in the gardens. There were no footsteps or voices from the residents of the house to be heard. Could it possibly be that vampires apart from Miss Somervell’s uncle were living here?
"Try? Christ, we’re going to have to work together on this case, Sherlock; we could at least be civil about it."
"Vampires with this mark have been spotted all around the United Kingdom," Mycroft explained. "Their crimes have differed in severity and intention, yet this is a pattern that suggests a common element. An organisation, maybe even a leader pulling the strings. The British Government as well as the Council has allocated resources to deal with this matter."
Sherlock licked his lips to underscore his nerviness. “My master’s business proposition would require the involvement of a seasoned distributor.”
The next morning, John was up before everyone else and he spent the time exploring the building until he stumbled upon a library. He almost went right past it, figuring it was closed at this early hour, yet a sliver of light caught his eye.
With a placating smile, Molly hurriedly produced her documentation Mycroft had forged for them and handed it to the man, who squinted at the paper, his lips pursed.
Just like Sherlock had predicted, Mycroft sought him out the following morning, his polite “A word, Doctor Watson?” by no means a request. John recounted what little progress they had made and the older Holmes pursed his lips in dismay but otherwise remained dispassionate.
With a wink she turned away and John surveyed the room to see whom she was referring to. When he found the person, it hit John like a stake to the heart.
"Probably not unharmed, though," he commented, not missing how Sherlock swallowed. "Good thing I’m not in the mood for a swim, then. Never underestimate older vampires."
"Don't mind him," John said, waving Molly into the room. Agents Sterling and Trevelyan had fled the room soon after arriving this morning, chased off by Sherlock's temper. "You found something on Meow Meow?"
John managed to push all those thoughts aside and enjoyed the nice chatty evenings with the Hudsons and Sherlock who revealed to be a very bright mind that could unravel many secrets about people which was not always appreciated. It caused some trouble at his school, making him an outcast very early on. No one wanted to befriend this weird, tall boy with the piercing eyes and long face who could tell that you stole money from your father’s wallet or that you copied homework from your friend. It caused Sherlock to draw back into himself and become even more observant for he was always alone.
"Please, Miss Adler, why don’t you enlighten us how you came to receive this information?" Mycroft said with a charming smile.
John stumbled past it, remembering now that he had sent his family away from the disastrous horror that had gutted one third of the city within the past two days. His hunger became stronger and after what felt like hours he finally managed to find a way out of the rubble and reached the undestroyed part of the city. He was hit with thousands of smells he had never smelt before, infiltrating his mind and demanding a name for what they were. Confused and overwhelmed, John sat down next to a well that was used to get water from and asked a woman if he could have a sip from her ladle that she used to put water into a cup. She looked at him with kind eyes and gave him a drink.
John laughed, truly amused and a tad pleased given the compliment, if he was honest with himself. It gave him a warm feeling in his rather cool body that Sherlock wanted him around, even if the man couldn’t really say it in words. Just the offer of a room that brought him closer to Sherlock made the day look brighter, tight-strung nerves be damned. He could take care of that later.
The grey building sat surrounded by soft hills, trees and hedges in the countryside, overlooking the sea. A small, asphalted path split off the main road, marked by a wooden sign indicating it was leading towards "Glenda Manor".
The promise of money had the woman’s eyes glint with greed. Sherlock sighed mentally as she told him to fetch his master. When he did, the appreciation in John’s expression made it hard to breathe for a moment. John squared his shoulders and his soft features turned businesslike when he got up and approached the table, taking his chair over to where the vampiress was sitting.
Sherlock wasn’t certain what to expect from the woman – whether she would manage to keep her face blank or give something away. Her reaction fell in the middle. The sly smile playing about the corner of her mouth was noticeable, as was the spark of recognition in her eyes.
“Oh, he’s out and about, doing one of his experiments,” Mrs Hudson filled him in as she served him tea. “I hope he comes back soon, he’ll catch his death out there.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and John was sure he would rebuff their question, but instead Sherlock rushed through an explanation, saying, "Irene and my colleague, John Watson, are both vampires and thus dwell in similar circles. Miss Adler told us to mention a townhouse in Swansea during Easter in case anyone doubted our acquaintance."
Sherlock felt eyes on him as he moved through the crowd. He should be used to it by now, seeing as it was by no means the first time this had happened, and yet the hungry, almost blazing gazes of the other vampires at the clubs were still decidedly unsettling. This was the forth establishment they had visited, the previous three yielding no results as to their mark's whereabouts.
“You need help, mate?” John called out to the man, tall with light hair but with severe burns covering the side of his body. “You’re not looking too well.”
John opened his mouth to argue but decided any effort would be in vain. Instead, he went back to his car to retrieve his belongings. Seeing Sherlock regularly after his realisation had been detrimental to his sanity – what would being in his vicinity do to John?
His quarters were just a meagre bedsit with an ensuite. It only had one window and scarce furniture. When he had come here for the first time, he had been surprised how bleak everything looked and how much it reflected his mood. He walked over to the fridge and pulled out a blood bag (there were several inside, although he only drank blood once a week) but maybe Mycroft was trying to make up for the time they hadn’t been in contact. After all, he had also enjoyed John’s presence before he had gone to boarding school. Compared to Sherlock, though, he had never been very open with his feelings.
Now it was John’s turn to snort, a little torn between the warm feeling in his chest that being reunited with his long lost friend brought about, and the annoyance at said friend’s horrible manners.
Silence spread while John was waiting for Sherlock to react and at the same time looking for something to say that would not sound too pathetic.
"That is ghastly, Sherlock. I don't think they wear morning suits and top hats in a posh Vampire club. Posh doesn't mean 'old-fashioned' and that would look as if I'm going to a wedding."
"Good. Let’s start." Sherlock’s tone was brisk and serious. Without another word he started off to the left, not even checking if John was following him. Which he did, of course.
Most importantly, they taught John how to blend in, to use tricks to hide his true nature. He became versed at hunting animals, draining rats, cats and dogs rather than humans. John thought it was disgusting and was glad when he learnt that he could also sustain his energy by eating bread, fruits and drinking water as long as it wasn’t too much.
“Of course you noticed her eyes change,” John said with a sad smile, “Vampires can go without blood for about two weeks. Cherry, apple or beetroot juice which contain high amounts of iron and vitamin C can only tide us over a little, that’s why many of us get their hands on bloodbags or fresh blood. The longer we go without it, the darker our eyes become. So, going by the colour of our eyes you can also see how hungry and dangerous we are. Well, and a banshee is a spirit. They make a horrible screeching or keening sound to signal the death of a family member or loved one. But never mind that. Humans rarely see or hear them,” John continued. “That place she named. Sean’s location. Are you familiar with it?”
Sherlock's gaze found the person John had pointed out immediately, cataloguing everything he could in the blink of an eye. Objectively speaking, the man was handsome, with sharp cheekbones, dark hair, and a slender build which the dark colour of his wardrobe only accentuated. Intricate accessories gave him an air of eccentricity, and his movements were energetic, almost as if he was riding a high.
That night, she became his first victim after she took him in to tend to his obvious wounds on his neck and arm.
Sherlock huddled closer into John's side at the thought of his childhood friend suffering the same fate while selfishly hoping John would continue. There was little way of knowing whether what John said was sincere or a mere half-truth tailored to win over their mark, and yet he liked to think this was John's way of telling him things neither of them had mentioned yet.
“Don’t get me wrong but he had sworn me to secrecy. He doesn’t want to be found. The situation has changed, though, and to be honest with you, I’d rather he is found and taken care of.”
“Tell the Captain General to spread the word – no one feeds. No one! Any actions to the contrary will be considered treason!”
“I don’t think it is any of your business to judge me or him. After all, we are not judging you by the brand of your handbag or the origin of your clothes,” John replied, sitting down and gesturing Sherlock to do the same.
"Doubtful. While the two Neanderthals next to you might be good bodyguards, their intellectual capacities will not advance this case; Miss Hooper is only here since she has access to a lab with halfway decent equipment," the detective delivered in a cold tone, ignoring the offended-looking faces of Sterling and Trevelyan in the rear-view mirror. "Being nice, John, is irrelevant to the successful solving of this case."
The feeling the look of admiration on John’s handsome face caused was better than any line of cocaine Sherlock had ever consumed.
Thank you so much for reading our story and leaving all those amazing comments. They are very much appreciated! :) Please note that the next chapter will take awhile to be updated. We're writing it now but real life has got very busy for us and sorting it has priority.
John leaned slightly across the table, looking Sherlock directly in the eye. The younger man shivered imperceptively under his probing gaze and kept his face blank as he nodded. John took another moment to decide, but eventually he tilted his head in the direction of their mark.
Estrode hissed, would have bared his fangs if he didn’t have the amount of self-control he actually possessed.
John was so glad that fashion had changed drastically over the last six decades. Now he could wear comfortable clothes again like he did before he became a vampire. He turned back to the wardrobe, dug through the incredible amount of clothes – did Sherlock only keep it for dressing up? – and put a pair of black leather trousers, a white shirt and a leather jacket on the unused bed.
Nothing that Sherlock stumbled across could hold his interest, let alone fill the hole again that had been reopened. Sherlock even closed himself off from the only friend he had made at university. He had finished boarding school with distinction, enabling him to study forensics and chemistry, something that had always fascinated him. His incredible skill of deduction, though, chased most people away, leaving only those who wanted to tease him or felt fascinated enough to try to befriend or date him.
Victor never acted on it, but he had been in love with Sherlock for quite a while, which the latter had figured out soon enough. Victor tried everything to get him back and made the huge mistake of seducing him with drugs to do so. As soon as he realised what cocaine and marijuana did to Sherlock's brain, both of them spiralled down abysmally.
Sherlock's expression must have betrayed him, for John's features immediately softened to something akin to pity – though it was not pity. John would never pity him. Empathy, maybe. One of these emotions John seemed to have aplenty, always bestowing it on others without thinking of himself first.
By the age of fourteen he had come to the conclusion that John either owned some medication or cream that made him look like thirty-eight or that he hid a much darker secret.
"The information that you seem to have known about vampires for a long time now, brother," Mycroft admitted.
"They are really impressive," Molly said, "but can you show us the portraits in the private chambers of your mistress? We’d rather start there with our… research."
"You barge in here, speak of murders and don’t introduce yourselves properly. Who do you think you are? I can have you thrown out of here in a mere second," he spoke in a threatening voice.
With that, Sherlock turned on his heels and vanished from sight. John heaved a sigh, running a hand through his hair. Lusting after a fourteen-year-old was only marginally better than lusting after a ten-year-old.
"If you don’t tell us then you both will get into trouble," John pointed out. "The quicker we get behind all this, the quicker we can prevent madness to spread out on this island."
He avoided walking past the front seats, so neither he nor Sherlock could see Diane and her husband. The smell of death was hurting John’s nose and with tears in his eyes he ran off in the dark to the next town to call an ambulance.
He had heard the story before, when Adler had come to him two weeks ago, telling him about one of her clients who had boasted about knowing someone who was in contact with someone called Moriarty alias "The Spider", he was feared amongst the criminal underbelly of Europe, with a reputation of allowing no room for betrayal. All vampires killed had gone a step too far, as Adler’s informant had explained. They had fed information to the wrong people, believing they would escape the consequences unscathed. Moriarty chose his followers himself and neither allowed boasting to others nor giving away what he planned.
"Not for me," Sherlock said. "Mrs Hudson, the landlady, is giving me a special deal. Owes me a favour." At John's questioning gaze, he continued. "A few years back, her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida. I was able to help out."
By Monday evening the streets of London had become more dangerous than the flames. Rumours about foreigners setting it spread even faster than the fire and John sustained a painful gash on his left arm when he tried to help a family of Dutch immigrants against an angry mob of Englishmen.
Eventually he had to accept that he needed blood and if he didn’t want to harm humans, animals were the only solution.
The Vampire Council and Estrode helped to wipe away any trace of him to prevent anybody from finding him. The only person who knew where he had gone was his friend Gabriel. He was his link to London that kept him updated about his own small family and what was going on in the capital.
Molly, apparently oblivious to the slightly awkward silence that had descended on the car, craned her neck to see more of the impressive house.
He was about to get off the sofa when Sherlock opened one sleepy eye and snaked an arm around John's neck.
"We need to go undercover," he declared, gazing expectantly at the detective. For the first time since reaching MI5, Sherlock's lips curled upwards.
In chapter four, Irene revealed information about Moriarty which she got from one of her clients – Emily Somervell, member of the royal family. Sherlock and John somewhat reconciled and went on a mission to find her to get more information. She told them she heard about Moriarty from a vampire called MacCafferty who could be found in high-end Vampire clubs.
The startled sound he made drew the man’s – the vampire’s – attention and suddenly the panic that John felt was reflected back at him in the dark eyes of his attacker.
Estrode barely resisted the temptation to roll his eyes. William was young for a vampire, had a flare for the dramatic and was just learning how to navigate the waters of vampire politics.
The other man's answering nod was nothing but a twitch of the head and Sherlock felt worry spread through his chest. He shifted closer and covered John's hand that was still on his arm with his own. As their eyes met, Sherlock almost jerked back at the naked hunger he saw but thankfully caught himself at the last moment.
He administered the cut just below the wrist with the precision of a doctor and Sherlock took it only with a slight wince. Victoria only approached when John inclined his head in permission and never broke additional skin with her teeth. She lifted Sherlock’s wrist to her eager red lips, sealed them carefully around the cut and started to suck.
“Oi! What are you doing in my kitchen?! People eat there!” he explained and followed Sherlock against his better judgement.
The words, “I am a vampire” were the easy part, as it turned out. Convincing his son of their truth was more of an obstacle.
The drive from Fangtasia to his office was long and granted enough time to look through what Magnussen had found. Apparently there still was no word on the exact whereabouts of Sebastian Moran, but a few other vampires of interest had been sighted in Belfast. There hadn’t been any bombings since March 1976, which was three years ago, but the IRA was still strong and committed to their cause. Why some vampires thought they had a place amongst the fighters was beyond Estrode, but daft vampires had always existed all around the globe.
John used the last strength he had to lock his jaw and squeeze his mouth shut but a strong hand pried it open once more as his attacker’s blood trickled down his wrist until it dropped down into John’s mouth.
Sherlock was silent for a moment, almost as if mulling over his answer. For a man who always spoke his mind and paid so little heed to how his words affected those around him, the pause was almost too considered in John's eyes. "What changed is that you're back. Whatever petty reason you had for leaving has to be moot now."
The Council again enforced their rule of not killing people but many vampires didn’t listen and went on nightly huntings. Others coupled with humans and brought even more hybrids into the world than had existed at that time. Those children were allowed but strictly controlled as they could live in the human and vampire world without needing to hide themselves and always posed a danger that they would help expose the vampire world. In the 1830s many of them were sent to Canada, New Zealand and Australia when other people moved out of the country to settle somewhere else.
The butler looked at him for a long moment as if he was scrutinising John, and then he nodded and led them back to the foyer where he pointed up the staircase on the right-hand side of the entrance.
The person came closer and rattled beside me. I couldn't see what it was nor could I tell by the sound.
"I feel like I'm about to vomit, I cannot walk straight without help and my head hurts, but yes, I'm alright", I muttered.
The woman stared to sob and I placed my hand onto her knee to calm her down. "You don't need to tell me more, I know the rest. Do you remember what the man looked like?"
I turned my head and that moment Sherlock was gone. I fell onto my knees and gasped for air. The spot Sherlock touched me was hurting badly.
After the door closed, I took at deep breath. All the adrenaline in my blood started getting out of my system, I started noticing just how exausted I really was. Deep in thought, I looked at the woman, who seemed to have fallen asleep. She was breathing quietly but steadily. Was I lucky and prevented another murder? I shook my head to get the thought out of my head. No this was different from Betty Walter's case. Those cases weren't connected. After that, I stared to patch up the lady laying on the bed to treat the bite. It honestly looked worse than it actually was and to finish of, I dripped a little bit of tincture on the wound and finished my work with a plaster. As I was putting everything back to it's original place, I heard the woman quitely moaning and then the sound of rustling fabric. I turned around as saw her staring at me in shock. As she inhaled her breath to scream, I tried to interrupt her.
"See you", Lestrade said goodbye to me and left the building. I waited a few minutes to make sure that he really was gone because I didn't plan on walking straight home.
I jumped when I heard the woman inhaling air sharply and turned around. She was breathing in short quick breaths and had her fingers clithed onto the collar of her dress. I touched the Lancaster and put it into my waistband to have it handy. Closing in, the woman turned her head and asked something that I didn't understand again.
"You heard me, John", Sherlock said with a bitter expression, "Every single guest here is a vampire. Except for you."
The man who approached me looked a lot like the dead man we found tonight. He had the same tall slender figure, the same pale, translucent skin and the same light eyes. The differences were his dark brown locks which fell lightly onto his neck and his dark blue coat. But I noticed that afterwards since I wasn't able to put anything into words at exact this moment.
"Fantastic", Lestrade whispered on our way to the crime scene and ran his fingers through his hair. "Another body and we haven't solved the other three cases."
"John, you've been working at our department for quite a while now. And to be honest, I don't know how to put it into words."
“I leave you alone for a couple of minutes and you tried to break my spell?”, Sherlock shouted at me. His towering figure in the doorframe. “Seems like I haven’t broken your spirit well enough.”
I would be lying if I said that I didn't think about that Sherlock Holmes after we met. This curious fella triggered a strange feeling inside me that I later identified as pure fear. Nervously I bobbed a pen up and down between my fingers while starring at the piece of paper in front of me.
I gulped carefully, afraid that it might cause him to bite me. “I was drained by vampires”, I managed to say, my words not more that an exhale of breath.
Sherlock came closer and leaned down to me. "Let me tell you a secret, John", Sherlock said with a low, husky voice, "I'm certainly not the only vampire who found a liking to your blood. Blood of this kind of quality doesn't stay unknown for long, escpecially if that person is always running around at night."
Once I opened the door, I felt a strange kind of aura. I didn't know what it was but it surely didn't seem right. Carefully, to hear every sound, I went up the stairs and got my pistol ready. I quickly opened the door with a kick and got ready to shoot. I really had to restrain myself from shooting. Right before me, on a chair with an ear to ear grin, was sitting Sherlock Holmes and he was looking at me with his perfect grin.
"Your last visit was quite a while ago", Wakefield said, "Something must have happened, am I right?"
"Hopkins?", I cried out after I found myself on the cold hard pavement. Blood was dripping from his mouth onto my face and I accidently pulled the trigger.
"John, I don't know what you're thinking", Lestrade said while looking outside the cab window, "But I think we have our first suspect."
"No", I whimpered, frustrated at my own weakness. Sherlock was right. I was weaker than him and that made me afraid.
I agreed and went inside. Everything was decorated ecssesively and I definetly wasn't dressed appropriately fr this event. I followed the woman into the crowd fro a while, but then was grabbed and pulled out. I wanted to shout at the person and free myself, but after I saw his face, my heart stopped.
To my surprise, Sherlock suddenly backed away. In the dim light I saw a rim of blue eyes, as if they were illuminated like lightbulbs from the inside and the widely dilated pupils.
"You shouldn't be so loud", he whispered, "Someone might find us." And then decended his lips onto my own.
My assumption that it was a bedroom proofed to be false. I found myself laying on some kind of sofa, considering the rough fabric underneath me. On my left side, I got a good look at the room I was in; it seemed to be a living room, not much different to my own.
“But I’m not sure if he’s able to perform such a complex exorcism”, I said, “Putting such a spell on someone requires lots of magical talent and-“
"What happened?", I asked and sat down next to him, opposite to his desk, "You said it was nothing too dangerous?"
I couldn't tell how much time had passed. The room was always dark, I had completely lost my feeling of time. My heart grew heavy once I heard shoes on stone once again. But this time it as two pairs of shoes. The door opened and I saw two sillouettes enter. One taller and more masculine, the other shorter and more feminine, clearly in a dress.
sounds more thrilling than it acutally is. You just basicly partol a certain area and make sure that nothing bad happens. London may be big but it's highly unlikely that something will happen in your distict. A real "hunt" only occurs if you notice something odd. I put my pistol into my waistband because I hadn't has a holster yet and I checked if it was still there. As I went around the corner, I saw two watchmen crossing my way. One of the two had a little lantern to guide their path. I was surprised to see them, watchmen were getting rare.
“I … I’m not sure”, I said, trying not to let the events replay in my head again, “I don’t think it’s because of that…”
Before I could realize, Sherlock sat me down on the sofa again and he himself took seat in an armchair in front of me.
He lifted the dead man's arm and rolled up the right sleeve. A strange symbol was carved into his underarm. From another pocket I took a pen and a notebook and copied the symbol.
"Don't be scared, dear", he whispered into my ear and I felt his breath against my skin. Then I felt his cold lips against my neck and was startled because by now, I couldn't move at all anymore.
After I told Lestrade everything Sherlock told me, I sat down again on the chair. Thinking about this night, I touched my neck where the bite wound would've been. Frustrated with Sherlock, I got up and took my coat with me. The night was still young and I didn't want to waste any more thoughts on Sherlock Holmes. While wanderings the streets, I came across a young woman, who seemed lost. She was wearing a bright red dress and once she noticed me, she came running towards me.
The woman moved her hand to her neck to check on the bite and didn't avert her gaze from me for a second and touched the plaster slightly with her fingertips.
"We already talked about that", said Lestrade, "and I decided that you really do need some time off."
As I left the chruch, I put the necklace around my neck, hiding the charm underneath my shirt. And I asked myself on the way home, why I didn't own such a thing before.
"We'll surely catch him. There aren't many vampires in London", I contributed but I myself was disappointed of the failed investigations. "Did the watchmen find anything else that might be of use?"
I tried to push him away from me, but his lips were locked with mine and I hadn't had any strength left to fight. As Sherlock finally released me from the kiss, I tried to gasp for air and tried to hold onto him, to not fall to the ground. To my surprise, Sherlock supported me.
"Excuse me?", Lestrade exclaimed and positioned himself next to me, "John, would you care to explain what exactly happened?"
"Come, let's continue walking", Hopkins whispered and grabbed my sleeve and pulled me through the streets.
I wanted to rather vanish into the ground than for her to see me in this condition. She slowed down once she got a better look at me.
I followed Lestrade outside and we walked a while through the downtown until I could see ploicemen from afar. I slowed my walking pace in shock.
“What is it?”, he asked, true curiosity in his eyes. “I tried to read it in your blood, but there seems to be some kind of spell protecting you.”
I sighed deeply, and my gaze feel to the window opposite to me. I heaved myself to my feet and looked outside. It was to high up to get out through the window, except if I wanted to risk some severely broken bones. Plus, even if I managed to get out, I had no clue where I was, I couldn’t get home or to the DSO that easily and was at risk to be found by some creature of the night if I was especially unlucky. At times like this, I cursed myself because I wasn’t as proficient at simple spells like Anderson but if I was lucky I could at least break the protective spell that was placed on the door to keep me in.
A loud bang echoed through the night and startled myself. Both Sherlock and I looked at each other in surprise. I still clutched the pistol tightly in my hands while Sherlock pressed his hand onto his shoulder. My bullet apparently brushed him.
I kind of felt relieving that I didn’t had to hide my identity anymore but nothing much had changed: I still behaved like I did before and wore the same clothes because it was just so much more convenient.
The man turned around and, indeed, it was him. A mischievious smile was on his face, blood stuck to his lips.
"We're currently in a vampires nest", the man explained, "They capture humans and harvest their blood to not go hunting every night."
"Information isn't cheap, I'm afraid", Sherlocks grin got wider as his fangs peeked out a little from his lips.
I wanted to respond something angrily but I felt dizzy and blinked a few times to see clearly again. I felt tired and everything hurted. I saw Sherlock licking his thumb and rubbing my neck with it. I did tingle a bit and after I managed to tough the place where the bite wound would've been, I noticed that it was gone.
He got up from his seat, pacing around the room while explaining to me. “There is something about you, I’m not able to make it out just yet. This may be the reason why other vampires started targeting you as well. Maybe there was an event in your childhood that you are trying to forget?”
Sherlock got up and straightened the fabric of his coat. "Then I will leave this case to you, John Watson."
I felt my hands getting moist. "Well, I, erm...", I stuttered, "once I get home, I'll eat something and go to bed shortly after that. I don't have a lot of freetime between shifts."
On our way back to Scotland Yard, Hopkins started laughing hesitantly. "We came here for nothing then!"
"You don't know that", Sherlock said, shrugging his shoulders, "But you don't have a lead at the moment."
I secretly hoped that I wouldn't find Hopkins lying there, but this was absurd. If Hopkins was really dead there would be much more panic at Scotland Yard. It was still not really dark outside, so not every poiliceman was carrying a lantern, as you could still discern enough without extra light.
I continued my way down the hallway. I was called by Inspector Hopkins to investigate on another case, because Lestrade still seemed to be a bit upset.
On the one hand, I hated the man standing in front of me, on the other hand, I really needed the information.
I wanted to protest, but as I noticed Lestrade closing in, I took Sherlocks hand and followed him to the dance floor. While we were dancing, I tried to not look at Sherlock directly.
I then heard Daniel break the silence with a cough. “Well, we would like to escort Dr. Watson home, if that would be alright.”
She said something I didn't understand and then seemingly became unconcious. I managed to caught her on time and brang her to my flat without second thought and put her on the sofa. She seemed to breathe shallowly.
Sitting in the cab, I placed my hands onto my lap and thought about Lara Owen. A hidden inverstigation wasn't a bad idea after all and I decided to chance my destination. But once I found myself in Lara Owens living room, I finally realised how plain stupid this idea was.
Before I was afraid of losing consciousness, long after I gave up struggling, he released his fangs from my throat.
We took the woman to the infirmary which we luckily had for a month now. As I layed the woman down onto the sickbed, Lestrade already wanted to leave.
Sherlock leaned on the wall, heading towards me and I took a shot at him. He stopped and for a moment and clutched the wound with a labored groan.
“They tied me up and took my blood”, I said, feeling a little safer without his mouth on my neck. I dared a look at him directly and saw slight confusion on his face. Then his expression changed to something akin to sick pleasure.
"I don't think so, John", Lestrade looked at me scepticly, "That's Anderson's field of knowledge and this isn't his case.
If I thought he was rough at me that last night I saw him, I was clearly wrong. I felt his fingernails dig into my shoulders, even through the fabric of my coat and shirt, his breath going quick and unsteady against my skin. Violently, he ripped open the collar of my shirt, buttons falling to the ground with a quiet rattle.
I wanted to scream, wanted to say something, wanted to resist but I somehow couldn't. I was weak against his mystic powers and this made me angry.
"I'm going to go to the Barts. What are you planning on doing? Will you stay here to investigate with Anderson?", Lestrade asked.
"Why is that? I thought Betty Walter's case was clear and the already did the autopsy at the Barts."
The man let go of his victim while laughing and lifted his hands. The woman sank to the ground without any streanth left to stand.
Baynes nodded silently and our ways parted. I went straightforward for a while, until I saw shadows moving in an ally. I carefully snuck around a corner and silently got my Lancaster ready. The person I noticed was standing above another, slurpling noises coming from him.
"John!", I heard Lestrade shout and then felt strong arms bringing me on my feet, "Are you alright?"
"I probably will tell you things you already know, Dr. Watson", he said after we both sat down at my table, I of course within safety distance.
"Why didn't we go straight to the crime scene then?", I asked openly confused, "Wouldn't it be better if we wouldn't waste any time and investigate?"
I shook with fear as he came closer, the wound not seeming to stop him, so I took another shoot. And a third one. By then, Sherlock was standing right in front of me grabbing me by the shoulders with bloodied hands and pressing me into a wall again.
“But seeing you struggle and all feisty is also a bunch of fun”, Sherlock laughed manically as he left his flat.
Closing in to Scotland Yard's entrance, I saw Lestrade already standing there, looking a bit annoyed. He surely wanted to complain that I was late and that he was worried that something might have happend to me, but his epression changed once he saw me carrying the woman and he helped me getting her into the buliding.
“We don’t think the vampires from the nest will come back for you, as we’ve taken well enough care of them. But we still would advise you to stay home for a couple of days.”
"What's so special about you?", he said slightly closing in, "Is there a secret you have I haven't figured out?"
"Don't say that!", Lestrade cried out in surprise, "If you don't want to tell, that's your business!"
I knocked on the church door in front of me. I wasn't religious but even I needed to talk sometimes. The door was opend by a young man shortly after I knocked.
"The woman in the red dress?", Sherlock said confused, "That's Olivia Pansrow. A woman of high status. And a vampire."
"We don't know. He just vanished after you got captured, we think", the woman now explained, "Who is he?"
“The local reverent?”, Sherlock said, disgust on his face, “No wonder your clothes stink of incense, you’re there pretty often, am I right?”
"I cannot quite grasp your idea, Mister John Watson", she said, looking at me in a confused manner, "The culprit surely won't attack the same person twice, will he?"
"Nah, we'll be too suspicious to be guests", he said but for the next twenty minutes, nobody had another idea.
Sherlock Holmes sickened me. Charming on the outside, a monster on the inside. I sometimes envied those at the DSO who could just shoot a monster, knowing that I could never do that; shoot and hit.
Sherlock swayed back to the chair. "I could tell who who it might be, but I'm not good at thinking with a gun to my head."
"Bring me to Scotland Yard", I said and the next thing I remembered was waking up in one of the infirmary.
“Jeanette Holly Watson, care to explain where you have been and gotten all these injuries?”, Molly asked sternly, hands on her hips.
"I...I want to help people. I always wanted but I just didn't know how and I got this job by accident. I was bothered by a ghost and the DSO helped me. I was so amazed by their work that I wanted to join them. I didn't like the hunting like most others."
“I wish, it wouldn’t have come to this”, I said under my breath and too tried to not make any eye contact with him.
"John!", Lestrade raised his voice but then lowered it again, "Please. I can understand that you really care for this case, but the dead can wait for a while. Let's focus on tonights case, alright?"
I heard that a vampire's bite will hurt only at first but I didn't know it could make one so drowsy. I tried to not close my eyes and fall asleep, who knows what could've happened to me if I did?
"Your first real nightshift and already a vampire hunt. John, I'm not sure if this is bloody luck or awful misfortune."
"Do the people at Barts do anything at all except cutting bodies open?", I muttered and buried my nose into my scarf. My pseudo-cold made me grumpier than usual.
Closing in to the corner of a house, I heard something and was ready to draw my gun. Carefully, I approached the corned from where the sound came from and went around it. In shock, I let out a gasp.
Without hesitation, he bit into my flesh and made me scream of pain. It wasn’t like to last time he drank from me, this time the pain didn’t fade, and I clearly felt the would pulsating with every gulp he took. I tried to force the lager man away by pushing but my arms felt wobbly and soon also did my legs. He was supporting me from sliding onto the floor with his arm wrapped around my waist.
"Say, John. What do you do if you're not at work? I mean, I know for about three years and still know close to nothing about you."
"I need to stretch my legs", I said and put the paper and pen back into my pocket and checked if my weapon was still safe inside its holster.
"Molly!", I called her but she turned around and tapped her fan on the back of her head an gave me a fierce look, so I stayed.
Then he pulled me on my feet and I saw, that I could only barely stand and stumbled after him back to the ball room. As we left the private room, I saw Molly running towards us with widened eyes but as she saw Sherlock, she stopped.
"Would you like to dance with me?", he asked and offered his hand. He musn't recognise my voice, so I ran my closed fan through my hand.
I carefully tugged at her collar which was decorated with lace and frills, as I noticed that it was slightly covered in blood.
"Well", I said and rubbed my neck, "Lestrade said that Hopkins called last night but I haven't heard from him personally. Why do you ask?"
"Correct. So, I was on one of my patrols", I made a short pause, "And I, well, I ran into a vampire. Everything went well, mostly."
I sighed. "No, I'm not and you know that Lestrade. I'm still single." I felt how thick the air in this room was getting, so I stood up from my seat. "My shift ends in twenty minutes. If you ecuse me, I'd like to leave now.
"John Watson? Come in, it's cold outside!", revenant Blair Wakefield invited me into the chruch. And together we took our seats in the first row.
Lestrade gave me a crooked smile. "Seems like it. But someone's gotta tell the lady that she needs to be careful and that she should stay away from any public events for the next few weeks.
After talking with some of the other policemen, I went to the nearest library to do some research, but to my misfortune I found nothing that seemed to fit the symbol we found. I put a book back into it's shelf and took a look onto my pocket watch. My shift wasn't officially over yet but I didn't want to waste any time in this library, so I snuck out. After talking to Lestrade last night, I finaly realised how isolated I lived. So I thought it would be nice for me to meet some new people. The small festivity I was planning to attend wasn't far from my flat, I noticed and because one didn't need an invitation, there was quite a crowd. I stood at the edge of the dance floor, leaning against the wall behind me and let my gaze roam the people around me. Maybe Lestrade was right. Maybe it
The Monster stopped his movement and I heard footsteps followed by another shot. The Monster let go of me, I got up and shot a second time. The monster clutched his chest, black blood oozing out of the wound, and then collapsed on the floor, the glowing in his eyes quickly fading.
"A forced holiday?", I cried out in surprise as Lestrade and I were standing alone in my living room.
"You're awake!", I heard a voice say, a voice which I didn't recognise, "Good. Good. Then we'll start rigth away."
I looked to the floor, ashamed, and evaded Sherlock's gaze.  He took of his glove and ran his fingernail across the fabric to cut if off. The fabric fell to the ground and exposed my chest. Sherlock had to take a step back and if he weren't already pale as snow, all colour would've faded from his face.
"Please try to stay conscious", he said to me, "As soon as we get out of here we will bring you to a doctor."
The woman wiped her face. "He was tall and had dark hair. He wore a coat but I don't remember if it was black or blue. And he had those stunning light eyes."
With worry in my gut, I decided to go to bed. Sleep was rough, though and I woke up startled and paralyzed in the middle of the night, a shadowy figure looming above me.
"I...I don't know yet", I said out of breath. I still needed time to properly process what happened.
Slowly, I tried to move her hand from her neck and noticed all the blood running onto her clothes. I wasn't surprised to find a vampire bite on her neck.
"I have been your little spy today", she grinned, "Lestrade wants to investigate at a festivity for a case."
Sherlock put his hand together and his eyes ran around for a while. "I would say that the culprit comes from the East End but I'm not sure from where exactly. It's most likely a man, between 5'5 and 5'9 in height, regular weight, not older than 40 but no younger than 25."
"John? Are you really alright?", Lestrade asked. I finally was released from my forced holiday and was walking down the hallway as he noticed me.
I sighed and we took two of the chairs in the room to sit on. Then, I started explaining. Lestrade, who has listened attentively, scratched his chin.
"Please, don't scream!", I plead and made a careful step towards her. The poor woman was obviously scared and was shaking strongly. "Do you know where you are?"
"No, we're fine", I replied, "You should probably go to bed. It's still in the middle of the night."
The wolf narrowed his eyes at John, leaning into his face closely and sniffing around it carefully. John let out a quiet squeak and squeezed his eyes shut as the wolf’s cold nose brushed his face.
The ex-army doctor stumbled back immediately, clutching the phone tightly in his hand, attempting to muffle the sound but it was already too late, the wolf’s head had shot up, staring straight ahead of him with golden eyes towards John as the black mass started to slowly stalk towards him.
Without warning, the wolf gave out a gruff grunt through its nose before a pink tongue flicked out slowly to lick the tip of its wet black nose. Its huge paw sluggishly trailed along the ground towards it as it proceeded to get onto all four paws.
The doctor took Sherlock’s lack of remark on the matter of him staying as defeat in his argument. John would stay. If Sherlock wanted to be alone, he would grant him the privacy, but he wouldn’t go farther than just outside the room. “Good. Let me take the bandages off your arm. I don’t want pressure on it.” He explained, holding his hand out expectantly.
“No,” John said firmly, looking into Sherlock’s eyes. “Sherlock you’re hurt.” he stated loudly as he tightened his hold when the man tried to pull free, keeping him still. “Why can’t you just tell me what’s bothering you?”
John let out a sigh, kneeling on the floor beside the bed with a groan, pain shooting up his leg. “I can’t just leave you here. Remember what I’ve been saying this whole time? About not wanting you to be alone? If this is an issue of privacy, then I can shut the door and wait outside until you’re done, but I’m not leaving you. I’ve already seen this happen once and it doesn’t change anything. I’m going to be fine, Sherlock. I promise. And so are you.”
John blinked in disbelief. “Change? You don’t mean... into a werewolf? You mean that can actually happen?” he bit his lip, looking Sherlock over curiously.
During the night, John had gathered his medical kit and a few towels and clothes for Sherlock; going by the werewolf movies he’d seen growing up, he figured Sherlock might need them once the fur was gone.
Greg picked up quickly, to which John was thankful for. “Greg?” he said quickly, taking a step away from his sulking friend. “Yeah, I am so sorry. Sherlock didn’t tell me he’d agreed to come in today, which he shouldn’t have done.” he said, directing a glare at Sherlock. “It turns out he can’t go to the scene today. You understand he was injured pretty badly on a... private case. Yes, I know he said he was fine, but you know Sherlock.” He laughed. “I don’t think he’s ready to go out yet. No, no, it’s alright, he just hasn’t quite finished recovering yet, that’s all. Yeah, he’s driving me up the wall... Listen Greg, could I come down tomorrow to collect the files, perhaps? I’m sure he could help from home I-” he paused, smiling. “Yes, thank you. I appreciate it. You know how he can get without a case. We can talk later. Yeah, alright, cheers.” He hung up, raising his hands defensively. “Alright? Done. No problem. You’ve got a case, now you can stop sulking.”
John stomped down the stairs, cursing under his breath and checking his phone once more. “Shut that bloody window, will you? It’s freezing!” the doctor snapped at the detective, going to the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea.
Sherlock shook his head. “They’ll only melt.” He grumbled through a heavy breath. Sherlock felt a small spasm in his arm causing him to wince under his breath. It had started. “John?” he gasped. “John, when it starts I don’t want- argh!” he startled, surprised by the painful shot up his back.
The army doctor slowly edged towards the mass on the floor, breathing shakily as he extended a hand to run his fingers along Sherlock’s arm, frowning at the raw patches where the fur had been torn out and where the flesh had been bitten away. It was still bleeding steadily, but it didn’t look like the injury reached the bone, only muscle. He hesitated a moment before moving his fingers to glide through the fur on the wolf’s head, stroking his ears gently; there were plenty of scratches there as well. “You have a lot of explaining to do.” John warned quietly staring at Mycroft.
John’s attempt to comfort Sherlock did nothing to ease his troubled mind- John’s word’s just angered him. Why did he have to be like this? Why couldn’t he be normal? At least normal within his own species? Even there, in his world, he wasn’t normal – he had been the defaulted pup, the pup that couldn’t control himself and even now as an adult couldn’t.
John furrowed his brow in confusion. “I’m glad I know... I’m glad that you don’t have to sneak off anywhere alone now.”
Sherlock let out another breath out his nose, shaking his large head gently as he sat down. There were traces of embarrassment along with shame clouding his eyes. And then it all suddenly clicked in John’s head.
“There’s got to be something we can do for pain? We can ask Mycroft, maybe. Also, it might be best if you stay home for a while. I doubt you’ll have a lot of movement in your arm for a few weeks.” He called over his shoulder.
A black pointed ear swivelled in the direction of the shaky whisper that called his name. Sherlock opened his eyes, his moon-stone coloured eyes shining brightly against the black fur, only now realising his back was to John, maybe that was for the best? The fear in John’s voice made his heart ache, that was why he avoided people in this state. The edge of fear that lined his friend’s voice gave the detective all the information he needed. He slowly rolled off the bed, landing heavily on the floor as he tried to find his footing. He let out a low growl of pain as he became accustomed to his new form.
As always constructive criticism/comments are always appreciated! I love hearing what you all have to say!
Sherlock didn’t approve of John placing a hand on his leg; he didn’t want any more care. He made his point clear by moving his arm closer towards himself and growled softly under his breath, without baring his teeth to enforce his dissatisfaction.
