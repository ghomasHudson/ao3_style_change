On the first day, Joanna takes a piece of white chalk and writes sigils in the four corners of the kitchen table, drawing each line carefully over the pitted surface of the wood. The first charm she builds is simple – yarrow for the blood, peppermint for invigoration of the tissues. Crushed eggshell for rebirth. She grinds them to dust with her grandmother’s pestle and sews the powder into a delicate, thin-woven bag. She feeds the bag gently down the bird’s throat, pushing it forward with a long silver needle.
The woman nods. “Good,” she says softly, her eyes unfocused. Staring at something neither of them can see. “That’s good.”
Joanna crushes their hands together, palm to palm and blood to blood, and then with a deep breath she stretches up onto her toes and pulls Sherlock’s face down to hers, fitting her lips over his open mouth. She breathes out hard into the heat of him, her air in his lungs and his mouth under hers, and when he inhales she feels the pulse of their twinned heartbeats in her bleeding hand.
Joanna stumbles, her legs still heavy with sleep. Her mouth tastes dry, like chalk. “Sorry,” she murmurs. “Didn’t mean to stay all night – we lost track of time.”
“We have no coin,” the girl said, “but if you hunger, you are welcome to share our food.”
“No, you won’t.”
Joanna can catch only random phrases, reading backwards and through the paper.
A muscle in Mycroft’s cheek twitches, a flinch so subtle that after a moment Joanna wonders if she saw it at all. “Kept, are you?” he says to Adrienne, his tone carefully light. “And here I was under the impression that you lived life free as the proverbial bird.”
But then, Joanna
“I’m sorry,” he says, his lips pressed to the brittle leaves twisted in her hair. She feels his arms shake. “I’m so sorry, Joanna.”
“Really?” she says. “No wonder the ceiling’s so low.”
The attic is just as she’d left it years before – her sleeping bag lying rumpled and unfurled, the space around littered with shabby sofa pillows and the stubs of broken pencils. The blacked out window and the silvered glass of the mirror, unmarred by dust or time. She sits on the floor, legs folded neatly beneath her, and watches her reflection from the corner of her eye.
,” the assistant breathes, profanity shaped from a sigh of relief, and then there’s a loud crack as her grandmother’s cane rips free from its place above the mantle and shrieks across the room, past Joanna and directly through the empty air where Mycroft stood just a moment before. It slams into the wall and stays there, buried inches deep and quivering.
can’t be that dim,” and they’re off. Lestrade steps in the middle to referee, and Joanna tunes them out.
The first few pages are recipes for breads and puddings and stews, some handwritten in a spiked, old-fashioned script and others clipped from the pages of time-yellowed newspapers and magazines. She turns each brittle page carefully, with the tips of her fingers.
The all-saint’s fire is burning through the wards at last, flaring with heat wherever the threads of the spell weaken and ignite. A scorched hole appears high above the black rails of the fire escape, and within moments the roof of 221 Baker Street erupts in flames.
Silence. His lips are chapped, the skin at the corners of his eyes as wrinkled and thin as crepe paper. He needs sleep, and water, and food. He needs to stop waiting for a dead woman to wake.
, it says, long letters shaped in black ink. Below the name a brown spot of dry blood stains the paper, the size of a finger prick. Joanna closes her eyes.
Sherlock cannot find Mrs Hudson in the smoke and the dark. He has searched her flat and started to climb the seventeen steps to the rooms above and the house fears for them both, for their burning lungs and stinging eyes, and the fire,
Joanna picks up the recipe book, tucking it under her arm. “Are you going to tell Sherlock?”
“Bring it,” Sherlock says, and walks out of the room.
Mycroft sighs. “Her concern—”
” Joanna says, and pushes herself to her feet, her Browning still clenched in her left hand. “Sherlock, I know that wood. My grandmother’s house—”
, the oak says.
There’s a silence. Mycroft’s response, she assumes. She’d heard Sherlock speaking to someone on the phone last night while she was trying to sleep, but the conversation had gone on much too long to be with Mycroft – Sherlock rarely lets his brother distract him for more than thirty seconds at a time, if he answers at all. Or so she’d thought.
She tries to be subtle, but there’s no doubt that he’s noticed; his wardrobe disappears item by item, shoe by trouser by suit jacket by shirt, and then reappears ever-so-slightly altered – new stitching in the lining of the collar, a whiff of fresh glue at the heel. Details he couldn’t possibly have missed, and yet he hasn’t said a word.
Thompson looks up from her notepad, pen dangling between her fingers. For all her careful neutrality, she seems less than pleased. “Joanna,” she says, “do you consider yourself a lonely person?”
She stops dead in the doorway, taking in the chaos of the ruined bed and muddy carpet, Joanna awake and standing and Sherlock kneeling at her feet, supplicant as a love-struck fairy tale prince.
“He will not open his door to you,” the girl told Death. She did not curtsey or bow or say
the voice says.
The darkness settles, and Joanna sleeps on.
“You’re an idiot,” she says, her voice muffled slightly by the wall of his chest. He nods.
A modest potted garden rises behind her on the fire escape, green and blooming in the summer sun. She listens as its leaves move in the wind.
, Joanna thinks.
“None of my concern?” she says. “You know my grandmother’s house is warded. If Moriarty wants the mirror, he’ll need my help to get inside.”
“I’m sure jewels all over Britain sleep easier tonight because of you.” She frowns; he’s trying to hide it, but he’s still shivering. “Do you need help with your shoes and trousers?”
Joanna’s breath catches in her throat. “What about it?”
“Step back,” he says, and when she does he slides off the bed and kneels at her feet. His hair brushes her thigh, and she can’t stop the gasp that hisses through her teeth. “More sensitive here,” he says, and she nearly stutters a denial before she feels him gently probing the bruised skin around her right ankle. “You must have injured one of his flunkies, if they felt the need to bind your feet as well as your hands.”
“I thought you were listing times I was in peril and you did things to save me.”
“That’s true. I’ve seen enough evidence of that.”
This year, Sherlock decided to incorporate both the traditional and the modern conventions:
“Let me go fix my face before we get you some cake.” I removed my arm from his shoulders and he stood up and stretched, and a loud pop sounded from somewhere in his body. He looked down at me.
“To avoid something that was bothering him.”
“Anything. Please, John. I need you.”
As it turns out, I didn’t even have to say anything. There was a reason why she reminded me so much of him.
I shook my head no, but all I could hear in my head was
“I think you’re ready, John. There’s little to no danger involved. You don’t have to worry about a chase or a scuffle. Just you and me and what we do best.”
Sherlock stirred with his own realisation. “I owe him, too. More than I’ve ever told him.”
John pressed his face against Sherlock’s chest, and Sherlock pushed his nose into John’s hair. After an exaggerated inhale from them both:
“Are you okay, then? Was it something corrosive?” John reached for Sherlock’s hands, but Sherlock was faster and slid them to his lap, hidden under the table. John squinted, and tried to deduce Sherlock.
“Give me your coat, Watson. I’ll hang it for you tonight.” He heard John’s grateful sigh behind him.
“You go home and you talk to him.”
"After that stunt, she’s mine for the rest of the day.”
John laid back and waited. Slowly, Sherlock brought his slippery finger to John’s hole and rubbed it in slow circles. John moaned at the sensation, which only gave Sherlock confidence. After a minute of rubbing and massaging, John spoke up. “Get a little more lube and I think I’ll be ready for your finger to go inside. Just slick me a bit on the inside, and smear a bit around the hole and we should be all ready.”
My shoulders sagged and I brought my hands to my head. I tipped my head forward and grasped at my hair. Cara should be a therapist instead of a nurse practitioner. Or both. She should be both.
As we sat side-by-side, I felt John's breathing slow down. He was also flaring his hands into fists as he calmed himself. To my surprise, after maybe a minute, he turned to face me, and tucked his right foot under his left knee and reached towards my face.
The sound of glass shattering against the linoleum flooring of the flat resounded in the unusually quiet space.
They were just finishing up their dinner that evening when a song, playing low in the background from the small radio next to the stove, interrupted John from shoving the empty pizza box into a bin bag. He stopped before the whole box was inside. The rubbish could wait.
“Fast learner.” John arched his neck.
Sherlock shook his head, unconvinced. “You’re going to hurt me Sherlock, but I need you to. I trust you, Sherlock. I need you right now. Can you do this for me?”
“And now? Right now I’m trying to make love to my husband because I love him and want to make him feel how much I love him. Because words don’t do it for him. He needs to be shown. This was the best way for me to do that, and now I can’t even do that anymore.”
Sherlock nodded and swallowed hard; he seemed to be coming back to himself. “Okay, John.”
Sherlock blushed. “Here, just push your lips to mine, okay? I’ll show you something here. Probably the last time I’ll know more about something than you for the rest of my life.” John settled himself back against his pillow. He moved his hand from Sherlock’s face and curled his index finger. “Get down here. I need that pretty mouth on mine, immediately!”
“I think I can take her up. Just a few steps. Just gotta make sure I get the rails on her bed in place, though. I’ll holler down if I need you.”
“That seems pretty obvious at the moment.” Sherlock just continued to look befuddled. John suddenly felt like an enormous twat.
“Is she gone?”
“You never have to ask permission to do that. Ever.”
“In my brain that day, after you’d said that, I’d forgotten how hot I found her and was instantly flattered by your assessment of me.”
Sherlock gasped. “Off. This needs to come off.” He grasped at John’s shirt. “I’ll help you out of it.”
“I made an atheist yell out for god. I haven’t lost my stuff yet. Not bad for a fifty-two-year-old.” John managed between breaths.
“I hope you’re right, John.”
He toed off his shoes and pushed them under the bed. He laid himself down gingerly, onto his right side. He felt around for the corner of the sheet and duvet and pulled them to his chest. He could hear Sherlock and Rosie in the kitchen, laughing and carrying on. John smiled. Would there ever be a day when he wasn’t surprised by how much Sherlock Holmes loved Rosamund Mary Watson?
“You what?” If I’d have leant any further back, I would’ve landed on the grass behind me.
“Then what is the point?” He also had the nerve to sound impatient.
‘You are the only person who can break me, you know that? I’ve had a lot more experience with people than you. I’ve had my heart broken by quite a few people. But you…you are the one that can hurt me the most. Maybe that’s why I haven’t been able to say it to you, to tell you properly, how much you mean to me. How much I love you. Because I know you get bored. I’m afraid you’ll get bored of me and go. Change your mind, and see I’m not the conductor of light you thought I was. And I lived through that once, and that was a skin-of-my-teeth thing. I was barely holding on before you came back. I was trying to let go of you the day you came home. I went to your grave: I brought Mary with me. I told her things about you and me. She could tell I loved you. Never had to say it out loud. I’m glad I never told her. Your ears should’ve been the first to hear me say it. I love you. You’re a twat. Sometimes, I want to kick you in the arse, and sometimes I want to get your throat in my hands and give it a tight squeeze. But. All the time? I always want to be around you. I always want us to be together. And now? I just want to hug you and say I love you. And if you can deal with how fucked-up I am, I can deal with how fucked-up you are. And maybe we can try and be what we used to be.”
“I doubt that would’ve worked out very well for me, given my aversion to touching other people.”
“What? What's the matter, Sherlock?” John shouted as he poked his head through the loo’s doorframe; a tendril of steam followed him.
“Christ, yes.”
“It’s okay, Sherlock! Shhhhh now. We’re okay.” John kissed the top of Sherlock’s head and inhaled the smell of his hair.
Sherlock stalked forward and pressed their chests together. His hands drifted down John’s back, then to his sides and then his hips. He lowered his head as his fingers slid between hot skin and elastic. “I love you, too,” he sighed into John’s ear. John’s hand made its way to the small of Sherlock’s back and it slipped inside at the top of Sherlock’s pants. He kissed Sherlock’s left pectoral muscle. And it was interpreted as the question it was made to be:
Trigger warning for drug addiction and potential relapse in Chapter 5 as well.
“I. Don’t know. Don’t know what to say.”
Sherlock just knelt there, appearing dazed.
“John! Stop that! I’m right here, for God’s sake!” He placed the glass forcefully on the night table, and a bit of water sloshed on the table as a result. He got John to sitting and propped him up by shoving most of his pillows behind John’s back.
“How could I forget?” Cara does have beautiful eyes. But they’re not the prettiest I’ve ever seen.
“Hey! Wait! She’s already in here. It sounds like smarty pants here turned off the DVD player by herself. Come back and have a kip with us!” John prayed Sherlock couldn’t tell he was holding his breath.
“You’re always kind, Sherlock.” That elicited a quizzical look from Sherlock.
“Well. Don’t let me stop you.”
. I drove Mrs. Hudson’s car cross London to get to you, and all I could think of, was that I put you in the path of a predator. I don't think I'll ever be able to forgive myself for that. That I could do what I did to you in that morgue while you were hurting physically and mentally because of Mary told you to do. Because you care that much for me. You were slowly killing yourself, and it took a video, that wasn't even meant for me, to see what you were doing! I was so wrapped up in my own shit that I wasn't even willing to see what you were going through after Mary died. I know that you loved her, despite the way she treated you. And me.”
"Don’t I always?"
“All right. I’ll count it down, you just sit there.”
I could only gape at her. When I woke up that morning, I had no idea this conversation was going to happen, or I’d have had a list of excuses prepared.
“Whatever for? This night could not have gone any better, despite my shoulder.”
“Thank you. For everything.”
“This is not a contest!” John’s voice thundered around the flat. He took a measured breath and began again.
. “That coffee is too hot to drink just yet. By the time the song is over, we should be less likely to burn ourselves.”
“Not yet, it isn’t.”
“What?” John looked as though I’d thrown a glass of water in his face.
“I tried to tell him a few years before that, but he put me off a bit.”
I inhaled a fortifying breath: “We are both guilty of doing some pretty abhorrent things to one another. I made you watch me step off of a building and die in front of your eyes. If anyone in this room deserves to never be forgiven for their transgressions, it would certainly be me.”
John’s forehead landed at the centre of Sherlock’s collar bones, his nose brushing against the top of his sternum. A kiss. He lifted his head to look up at Sherlock. “No, you were not. Shall we get down to business?”
“John. Please come. Please.”
“I still maintain that her final act was one made in atonement. Though she never verbally apologised for her error in judgement, she carried guilt for what she did to me. To us. To you, especially, John. She made that clear to me during her last moments.”
“Okay, Sherlock. No more talking. It’s okay. Here we go.”
Sherlock sped up his pace. John’s ankles locked behind Sherlock.
John let him.
Banoffee pie. Oh dear. They were going to have to strategically disguise that before Rosie was able to see the box…
For the traditional third year anniversary aspect of the celebration, he was clad in leather straps, but not restrained. Full bondage was a trigger for Sherlock’s PTSD after his imprisonment and torture in Serbia. But
“Because I think you’re right.”
“Certainly, my little bud. Just be careful of my shoulder, all right?” She climbed onto the cushion next to her father and settled against his right side, and she tucked her head against his chest. Sherlock poked his head into the room when there was a moment he didn’t have to stand over the cooker and stir the chilli.
“Sherrrrlock! Oh, Oh shit.” Sherlock was motionless, he just looked down at John as if in a state of catatonia. He held John’s knees under his shoulders and stayed as still as he was able.
“Just sit here with me and feed me biscuits until I need a kip. Which I don’t think will be much longer. Hold my tea for me so I don’t have to try to reach the table?” John pushed his cup into Sherlock’s right hand without waiting for confirmation and then munched away as Sherlock held his half-empty teacup. Sherlock couldn’t help but grin.
“Oh. Yes. Yes! I can do that!”
John was dumbfounded. He gave Sherlock a tight nod and sat down next to him on the sofa, and then turned to face him. They wriggled John out of his jumper and then his vest. John made a move for the gel and Sherlock exclaimed:
“You think?”
Sherlock opened his eyes, and took a big, shaky breath through his nose and exhaled it through his mouth. “That’s great. Keep doing that.” John continued the slide of his hand along Sherlock’s right thigh, occasionally scratching his nails softly against Sherlock’s soft skin, as Sherlock continued to do his breathing. Once Sherlock calmed enough to speak, John asked:
John shifted as he remembered their first time doing this a few weeks ago. Since it went so well the first time, might as well try recreating it.
to help celebrate their special day. As always, Sherlock had outdone himself. And John was going to thank him properly for all of his hard work.
Rosie was in the living room, playing with the toys Sherlock’s parents bought just for her visits there. Unfortunately, they visited so infrequently, the toys were almost new to her. After this visit, they all hoped visiting there, and back in London, would be a common occurrence. John and Sherlock asked if they could come down to visit the week before, wanting to tell them both in person about their new relationship. And to tell them one thing they’ve been bothered by for many years.
John’s face fell for a moment. His anger dissipated immediately when he was able to recognize the emotions playing out on Sherlock's face.
“Oookaay!” she sing-songed her way up the stairs to hers and John’s bedroom. John’s outburst already forgotten.
“I think I can handle it, too.”
“Could I just? Hold you for a few minutes? I haven’t been able to do that since all of this started and I just want you in my arms for a bit, yeah?”
“Oh! Do I need to get us more lube? Get you a pillow for your shoulder?”
“I’m gonna get yoooouuuu!” John cooed, as he chased Rosie around the sitting room on his knees. As she toddled around, she giggled and shouted, “Daddy silly!”
“You did everything quite right for me. I hope when I did that to you, it felt that way for you as well.”
“Because. I don’t think I’m going to be able to eat these vegetables without wearing them, seeing as I can’t use my other hand to push them onto the fork.” He glared at his left arm and crinkled his nose at its lack of competence.
’ Sherlock copied the military stance he’d seen John portray over the ten years they’d known each other; straightened his back, and his own resolve in the process.
“Well, I will do my very best to be kind to you for as long as you’ll have me.”
“I never apologized to you, did I?”
John flipped to his back, his feet by his pillows, as he waited for Sherlock to spin the lid off of the vitamin E cream. Sherlock helped him work his arm out of his sweatshirt to expose his shoulder. It was time to moisturise and loosen the scar tissue. Sherlock dabbed his finger in the jar and rubbed the cream into all six of John’s incisions. John tried, but failed, to contain the moans that escaped his mouth. Sherlock’s warm, strong hand, massaged the lotion into John’s still traumatised surgical area. Sherlock paid particular attention to the three scars at the front of John’s shoulder and the pectoral/deltoid area. During his procedure, John’s surgeon had to spend extra time repairing his completely torn labrum. The muscular damage from the procedure to that area was rather extensive. The scar tissue and continued inflammation there could still be felt by his therapists eight weeks post-surgery.
“Oh, leave him out of it! Your blog is the biggest indicator. As soon as I realised you were THAT John Watson, I read your blog, more than once. It’s obvious, John.”
“She loves you very much. Sometimes, kids just make things like feelings so damn simple. Somewhere along the way, we lose that part of ourselves.”
Sherlock was blinking again, and his eyes looked a bit wet. He spun around and went back into the kitchen, stubbed his toe on his own stool, cursed, and John heard him drop the lid that had been on top of the pot of chilli right onto the counter next to the cooker.
“So, this is a first for the both of us then.”
“Sure, Sherlock. I’ll meet you in the bathroom.” John held his left elbow in the palm of his right hand as he slowly made his way down the hall. He listened to Sherlock mucking about the freezer as he walked.
“I treasure you. You are my favourite of all things.”
“No. I-I want you. Inside me. Now, please.”
“What we’ve been up to the last three weeks has been fine with me.”
“Fishies?” She looked at both of their faces, seeming to remember the advertisement from a few days ago, but not being able to place it.
“As long as I can get both of my arms around you, there is no room for wishes.”
John started on the buckles, while Sherlock laid there, dazed and riding the waves of the sex chemicals roiling through his bloodstream. One by one, he released Sherlock’s sweaty skin from their bonds.
“Come on, John. You’re almost there.” Cara was leading me to a place I’d been so desperate to go. I just needed someone to tell me it was okay.
“Now you really sound like him.”
“No unnecessary risks. For either of us! No more jumping in front of incoming bullets, okay?!”
“What was that?”
His evasion of the question confirmed my fear. He also did not remove himself from my arms.
He had no reason to worry.
“I’m fine, really. Already got the glass out, got this towel here, and I’m pressing it really hard. Might need seven or eight stitches, but I think it’s fine.”
“I know you think I’m mad about The Work. But I’m not. I couldn’t care less about us not being able to do that anymore. I’m angry that these things keep happening to us. What did either of us do to deserve the rubbish life’s thrown at us?”
“I didn’t want to say before, but I’ve felt both popping from the ligaments, and bones scraping in the joint. I think this might be really serious, Sherlock. If I’m not feeling better in a few days, I’m going to see an Orthopaedic surgeon. The ligaments around the joint feel very loose to me.”
!!!!!!” Sherlock immediately dropped John’s wrist and John tipped forward, his forehead against Sherlock’s belly.
“I’m not really frightened of the surgery, John. I think my anxiety is about the future. The more immediate part of it. Especially after what we have recently become.”
“You’re serious?” An eyebrow raise.
“'Tank you, Papa!”
“I could go with you tomorrow? I'm sure Mycroft could get you in to see someone.”
“How about we go here, Rosamund? We can see tigers and pandas
“It’s either the hospital,” Mrs. Hudson says, “or Sherlock. Your choice.”
“Lucky him,” Donovan says, and lifts the tape. Sherlock ducks beneath it, and Donovan smirks. “Try not enjoy yourself too much, yeah? You make some of the forensic techs queasy.”
The needle swings towards the ground in a perfect arc. Just before it falls, Joanna’s shadow reaches out and catches it.
She pushed past the wedding guests standing in a circle around him. The rich man’s son shuddered and twitched and twisted in the dirt, his leg black with poison, and she heard Death moving through the tall grasses.
Adrienne drops the glass shard back into the box. It lands with a muffled clink. “With access to Moriarty’s resources, Moran is a legitimate threat. I’ve suspected for some time that he’d returned to England, but I couldn’t be sure until I saw the all-saint’s fire at the pool last night.”
“Give me a, oh fuck. A sec to, uh. Oh. This is fantastic. She will be the very last thing I’ll think about, by the way.” John could only smile up at him. Another deep breath and then:  “Are you all right?”
“I didn’t mean to pressure you. If you’re not ready for that sort of thing, I’m not ready for it either. We’re in this thing together.” John kissed Sherlock’s shoulder, rubbing his nose against the softness of the fabric of Sherlock’s dressing gown.
“Johhhhnnnn! Oh my god! John!!!” John felt Sherlock's release against his stomach. He slowed his strokes inside Sherlock, guiding him through the white light of his vision to the other side. The clench of Sherlock around him and the sounds Sherlock were making post-ecstasy were pushing him over as well.
John kept his left arm close to his side, and Sherlock gently tugged until he was left holding John’s coat.
“What’s up? Looks like you’ve something on your mind.”
“Now you know how I feel when you’re out at the shops without me. I still ask you to throw me a pen on occasion.”
“What did Sherlock have to say about that?”
“I believe that’s what the paperwork your surgeon sent you home with said. You had to wait for three to four days for the incisions to stop weeping. They looked fine this morning.”
“My father. He was a shit, too.”
“Of all the places I’ve been, all the beauty this planet has on offer, you are still the loveliest thing my eyes have ever seen.”
“Fine.” Pompousness.
“Were you tortured, Sherlock?”
“Rosie, love?”
“Ready?”
“Thanks. Love you…” John’s voice trailed to an exhaled breath as he drifted to sleep.
“Papa kiss Daddy!” She clapped her hands. She was as happy as the adults were in that room with her.
“Or she could have information. Or be the killer. We should go talk to her.”
“I told you it was all right, John. You don’t have to keep thanking me. I’m here because I want to be. If I didn’t, I’d already be in the kitchen getting up to something mischievous. I do have a lab in there, you know.” Sherlock seemed a little put out.
“I’m the only one around here that’s allowed to hallucinate, okay?” We both laughed at John’s obvious attempt to lighten things up a bit. I can’t ever seem to let well enough alone.
“You smell nice because you’re you. You smell like John.” Sherlock kissed his hair. John pressed himself in closer, tightening his arms around Sherlock as well as his shoulder would allow.
“John? Are you all right?” If anyone was more worried about John’s outburst, it was Sherlock Holmes. He was right behind John and almost stepped on his heels due to John’s sudden and unexpected stop at their front door. Rosie stood in front of her father and godfather in confusion; her head moving side to side waiting for someone to clear up the situation for her before she began to get upset.
“Oh, shu up n cuddle me n get some sleep urself.”
“If it was a full dislocation, I’d be in A&E right now, not sitting on the toilet seat in our loo.”
“What am I doing?” I had no idea that today was THE DAY. It was indeed my birthday.
“You are gorgeous. And all mine.” More praise. Sherlock's back arched at the words. John kissed the plug’s base and then got a hand on it. He gave it a few playful twists and then pressed softly against it, just a bit further, and grazed that nub inside. Sherlock keened.
Sherlock leapt from his chair and stumbled into the sitting room as his chair tumbled over to the floor behind him. He was skidding on his knees as he slid to John’s side.
At that admission, Sherlock scrambled underneath John and sat up.
“A shame, that. You have wonderful hands, Sherlock. You have a very soft touch, when you want to.” John sighed as he finished off the last of that set of exercises.
“I have a pretty good idea what’s eating at him.” Cara unwrapped the egg on white bread with a raised eyebrow.
“It did, Sherlock. Every time we’re together, it’s just, not to sound plebeian about it, it’s wonderful. It’s like that because it’s us.”
“Did I?” John was decidedly confused. And becoming visibly distressed by the look on Sherlock's face.
Sigils are complex, capricious things, often highly personal and easy to misread; the basic intent of the spell on the tyres is invisibility, sure enough, but the subtleties—
“Yes, Gran,” Joanna says again, and leaves her grandmother standing alone beneath the city-lit sky.
It’s like grabbing hold of a live electrical wire. The shock slams through her arm and into her chest, and she doubles over in front of the sink, gasping. The satchel falls, landing at her feet.
There’s nothing particularly desperate or dangerous about the Madame’s empty sitting room. Heavy drapes hang over the windows, shutting out the last of the evening sun. The carpet is thick and wine-red, and it muffles the sound of Joanna’s footsteps as she walks to the small, round table in the middle of the room. The tablecloth is black, embroidered with your typical grab bag of magical signs and symbols – pentagrams and crescent moons, ankhs and runes and the occasional Ouroboros – and at its centre sits a crystal ball in an ornate silver stand.
“Okay. I am so ridiculously ready for this to proceed. Slick yourself up, and put a bit on me, okay? Your belly is going to be rubbing against me and we don’t need any sparks.”
“You did research? Also, I’m not the only person here. We’re both doing this, so you need to be enjoying yourself as well. No pressure on yourself, okay?”
“I honestly don’t think I’ve ever been more sure, or ready, for anything in my entire life.” John searched his face. There was no hint of fear. He looked a bit nervous, but likely a bit more along the lines of anticipation and excitement.
“Sherlock! Are you all right?”
“I fot I was wuv’, Da?” She tilted her head in confusion.
He came back to the kitchen’s entryway: “Yes, John?”
John walked over and sat down on Sherlock’s bed and gently pulled off his jumper and flung it onto a nearby chair.
“We met ten years ago today! I wanted to share the celebration of that with you tonight! I just want to make you feel good, and I can’t do that right now!!!” John yelled. “I’m angry, Sherlock! I’m really fucking angry! I don’t understand it. I used to be a doctor, a healer. I used to be a soldier, working for Queen and Country. And even when that went to shit, I ended up here. I have a beautiful life. A perfect, loving, man who happens to be a gorgeous genius. I have a beautiful, smart, caring, and kind little girl, who I love more than just about anything in the world. I have an amazing job, I get to help people find out the truth about things that happened to themselves or someone they love. I get to put shitty people in prison. So why is it, that I go to sleep some nights, and have dreams about blood on sand? Dreams about my wife dying. Dreams about vacant, pale eyes, staring up at a blue sky. Why is it that I’m reduced to taking a pill every day to help me appreciate how great my life is?
“Jesus Christ.”
John’s hand froze, Sherlock’s nape curl winding halfway around John’s thumb, much like his legs had done around John’s hips a short time ago.
John grabbed Sherlock’s free hand and brought it to his lips. “Thank you.”
After a few more moments, John stood and shook his surgeon’s hand. “Thank you very much for helping me. I know you did the best you could for me. You tried to put me back together again, and I thank you for that.”
“It must’ve been wet!”
“If you ever want to talk about it, I want to hear about it, but only if you want to. I will never force you to talk about it. Thank you, for everything. I meant what I said before, about seeing you. Seeing everything you’ve done for me.
“It’s most likely a temporary symptom. A lot of them go away after a few weeks of taking it.”
“Did you mean what you just said? Do you mean that?”
“I always do as you say, John.” He couldn’t help but laugh at the blatant lie.
John turned to face him and whispered so only the grownups could hear, “I’m going to need your help once we get her settled inside. I am currently unable to move my left shoulder.”
Sherlock began tapping at his phone. John glanced back and forth between them, praying Sherlock had another option to avoid a full-on wobbly. After a few seconds, and before she could fall head-first into a complete snit, Sherlock bellowed as he slid the pamphlet for the zoo into her immediate view:
“Yes. All right.” Sherlock slipped on his oxford’s but didn’t bother to lace them. His face remained blank as he yanked on his leather gloves. As if having invisible strings snipped, he dropped to the floor and landed on his knees with a thud, narrowly missing a sizeable piece of glass.
“Would you like to go again, Sherlock? Because, if you would, I would like to be inside you again. Last night was marvellous.”
“I distinctly remember removing you from a fire with my bare hands.”
Through a mouthful of biscuit: “I’d love to see Rose right now, but I’m not awake enough to see her and I don’t want to scare her with this monstrosity hanging around my neck until I’m properly awake.”
“I’m thinking of The Queen, and it’s your fault.” Sherlock completely lost his rhythm and began to chortle
Sherlock lowered his head and got to work. As he slipped the last button from its hole, John slid his right hand from left to right, shoulder over his upper chest to the other shoulder, and pushed off Sherlock’s dark blue dress shirt. It joined his dressing gown at his feet. Sherlock shivered at the sweep of John’s gentle hand across his body. John grabbed Sherlock’s left shoulder and pulled him forward. “C’mere.”
“No, John. I’m fine, really. Some ibuprofen and a lie-down, and I’ll be fine.”
Sherlock sighed. “I suppose this is going to happen at some point in the next fifty years. All right.”
“I knew it. I could see it on his face that afternoon when you came to visit Sherlock after he’d come home. His face when he saw you, John; I’ve never seen that look on his face before. I’ve never seen him look at someone like that. I’ve never heard him speak of someone as fondly and he has of you and now your little girl.”
“Just ‘fine’, though?”
“It makes me feel like shit, Sherlock. This is not okay. My cock is inside you and it’s as soft as that pillow under your head.”
“Are you all right, John? Sherlock whispered a few minutes later; his hand still in John’s hair, but he dared not move it. But the surprising softness of John’s hair was tempting him to do just that.
“All you did was take it off of me and throw it not all that far away from me. Then you wanted to shoot it, therefore killing me.”
“I think I’ll unwrap you in a bit. I want to be inside you, too.”
Even in dreams, John was able to sense the change in Sherlock’s breathing; he stirred behind him.
“How could you do that? Why? Why do you always do stupid things like that?” Sherlock’s right hand moved to cover the scarf, and with it, John’s shaking hand.
“If I didn’t know better, he was being a responsible father trying to keep body parts not attached to living people, out of the flat where his daughter lives. Seems pretty legitimate to me, Sherlock.”
“BUT SHE CAN HEAR YOU!”
Sherlock pushed his forehead against John’s neck and inhaled. John’s arms went around his back and pulled him close. “I’m supposed to be taking care of you.” Sherlock admitted.
“Except when you’re with me?”
“I know how good that feels, Sherlock. Every time you’ve done this for me, I can feel the pleasure fizzle in my toes.” He looked up at Sherlock’s face and pushed further inside, twisting his finger, getting the lube spread around to make Sherlock comfortable. John spent a few more seconds preparing Sherlock and then slicked himself up.
“It’s all right, John. I’m doing this for you. Always for you. I love you. I love you more than everything. Come, John. Please. I need to see you come in my hand.”
“I know you are, but there’s no need for it, love. Accidents happen.” They managed to disentangle themselves. John watched Sherlock rise with an unsettling unsteadiness. As he stood and peeled off his gloves and handed them over to John, he watched Sherlock shake his two hands out at his sides.
“I’ll never tire of you saying that word to me when using it to describe something I’ve done. My first choice for a word to describe what just transpired would be miraculous, but to each their own.”
“That affection you have for him. The ease you two have with one another. I read your blog. I listen when you talk about him at work; which is a helluva lot, by the way. And even in that short interaction I just witnessed today, Mary would’ve had to have been blind to not see what you both mean to the other.”
John shook his head as the appalling memories conjured themselves in his mind.
Nine hours later, John awoke lying on his back with most of Sherlock draped across him, his back resting against the right side of John’s chest and between his right arm and side. He was snoring. The sun was beginning its morning ascent and John could see the room turning pink and orange. A song came to him then, and as he held Sherlock, and watched the sunrise over the pale walls of their bedroom, he smiled and hummed himself back to sleep.
“She died on the floor, in front of me, and then in my arms, as sharks swam around us. Looking back on that, the sharks now seem apropos. A bit of a homage to the shark that swam into my path and preyed on me and those I loved. The only things I can say about Mary, with any positivity? She kept me alive long enough for him to return.” He shoved his right shoulder into Sherlock good-naturedly and continued: “She also gave me, us, all of us, Rosie. As far as I’m concerned, the best parts of her and I made Rosie. Mary took that bullet to save him. I hope she did it for me, but I’ll never know that for sure. I think she did it for herself, as well. She told us, posthumously, if you can believe that, that she knew what Sherlock and I could become when she was gone. She wasn’t all wrong. I just wish it hadn’t taken us so long to get here.” He put his arm around Sherlock in an act of supporting love that stunned the elder Holmes’. Sherlock let himself be pulled to John’s side and rested his head on the proffered shoulder. Mary’s death devastated them both, but for very different reasons; reasons they were both still trying to understand.
John glanced at Sherlock who nodded.
I released him from my embrace and raised my cheek from his hair. He lifted his head from my chest. “This,” I nodded and then waved my hands around ourselves, “was a wonderful start.” I smiled at him as best as I could. We were both a bit wobbly.
“As soon as I said I want to be the man she thought I was, she told me to get the hell on with it, and then she vanished. And then you know the rest. Big, sloppy tears and a bit of snot. Sorry about your shirt, by the way.”
John’s surprise pushed him further back against the raised bed. "Sometimes, we're chalk and cheese; most times, we're tea and biscuits. But I mean it. You mean too much to me to have an argument about something that two months from now will be moot. ‘We’ mean to much to me. Things are going to be tense enough, without me having a tantrum. Just tell me to pipe down and leave you to it. Whatever ‘it’ may turn out to be.”
Sherlock could sense that John was getting to something important, so he laid there, and said, “You’ve mentioned a few places here and there, but nothing very specific.”
“Is there something else bothering you?” Sherlock got his elbows under him and tilted his head.
“Don’t you ever leave me again, Sherlock.” John gasped the words against Sherlock’s shoulder. “Not like that.” He kissed Sherlock’s neck.
After a few moments of loaded silence, John gasped in surprise.
“She’d flip-flopped on her opinion of him for decades. Every day, it could be something different. For the better part of my life, she rarely had anything nice to say to me about him. Most of it was telling me how he treated her abominably. She wouldn’t leave. No matter how bad it got. No matter how many times I told her she didn’t deserve to be treated the way he treated her. All I ever wanted was for her to have a happy, peaceful life.”
“You’re not a consulting detective for nothing. Good on ya.”
“Yes. All right.” As he jogged past John, John let out a guffaw.
“I hope you do.” Sherlock set down the fork after John’s last bite and placed the plate on the night table. They locked eyes, their gaze becoming loaded as the seconds ticked by.
“I am more than fine, John. Is your shoulder okay?”
He left the bed and walked into the bathroom to dig around in John’s medical supplies. After a few moments of frantic searching, he clapped a hand on the mesh sling they had for emergencies such as this. He went to the bathroom cabinet and found a tube of ibuprofen gel and walked to the sitting room, sat on the couch, and waited for John to come back downstairs.
Sherlock shimmied across the bed into John’s arms. “I wish I could say I didn’t understand where you were coming from. I was invisible in my family. Harry came out and all my parents and she ever did after that was fight. Invisibility in your own life is a hard thing to overcome. Especially when that continued into adulthood. I always had a problem with being able to look forward because people never looked back. They moved on with their life, and never gave me a second glance as they walked away from me. I was always a stepping stone to something better, something greater than I could ever be for someone else.”
“I don’t think there’s another with an ‘M’ as their first initial if that’s why you’re pausing.”
“John? What’s the matter?”
“Have you just made our daughter complicit in a crime?”
“I’m not going anywhere, Sherlock! No need to sprint! I’ll meet you in bed.”
I tossed my own serviette onto the picnic table with a bit more force than I’d intended. “What is happening? Have we time-travelled back to sixth-form?”
“She did something to Sherlock, and I don’t think I’ve ever really forgiven her for it. He landed in hospital not very long after he’d come home. I’d just gotten him back and he was in hospital because of my wife. She almost killed him, and I’d almost lost him, AGAIN. I could barely look at her, and she was pregnant with our daughter! We’d just been married. She knew how much he’d meant to me before we’d met and she knew how utterly overjoyed I was to have him be resurrected. And she tried to take him away from me anyway!”
miraculous, Sherlock. We have been this whole time but weren't ready. But we are now. This? Us? It’s going to be tough, but we’ve proven to be tougher than just about everything that’s ever been thrown at us. We’ve got this.”
At least John was able to joke.
“I’m going the speed limit. I’m not speeding. Shit. I can’t see her now. Where the hell did she get to?!”
As if on cue, the door to Sherlock’s bedroom opened. Fifteen minutes must’ve passed by already.
“Welcome.” John’s arms waved about the flat. ”This is how it feels to be me when dealing with you.” John’s sarcasm was slowly returning.
"First, don’t make yourself seem unimportant. I don’t like hearing you speak that way about yourself. Secondly, yeah, I’d have to say I do feel all right. I don’t miss that sling, mind. It’s nice to know if I need it, the doctor told me I could use for a bit if my arm becomes achy. Nice to have a bit of a backup plan if I doing something stupid and hurt myself a bit. I’m just glad I don’t have to ask you to do so much for me as I had been... Driving us home this morning was a treat I was expecting to have to wait for at least a week or so longer.”
Sherlock hadn’t known he wanted to be a part of a family until he already was.
“Oh! Don’t bring Rosie into this! You’ve been this way since we met! I have you both! At least I hope I have you; especially now.” The look on John’s face could best be described as beseeching.
The surgery lasted five and a half hours. He was kept company by Lestrade, Mycroft, and Rosie, who came home from the first term of her first year at university, despite John telling her not to disrupt her studies. Sherlock and Rosie took him home and helped him up the stairs to the flat. His sciatic pain was relieved by the surgery. John wasn’t allowed to lift more than two and a half kilograms: no bending, twisting, squatting, or climbing for at least eight weeks, pending a follow-up and a series of x-rays.
John picked up his pace, chasing his own pleasure, but wanting to prolong Sherlock’s.
“We’ll call you when it’s ready, Rosamund.”
“Come on, Sherlock. Harder, love. Take what you need but give me all that you can.”
“Fine.” Acquiescence.
“Had no other immediate plans.”
“Yeah, love?” John’s pain meds were starting to work.
“Don’t do that.”
“Oh, Rosie. I was calling Sherlock ‘love’.”
With a bit of contortion and a few grunts of pain, John was able to escape the confines of his sweatshirt. Sherlock tossed it on the pile of clothing that was accumulating on the bathroom floor. They both grabbed at the waistband of John’s sweatpants and shimmied them down his thighs. John stepped on the elastic at each ankle and pushed them over his heels and feet and kicked them away. John was standing there in his pants. Sherlock just blinked. John broke the silence.
“She almost put you in a grave, Sherlock!” The subject was still a poorly healed wound. Sherlock thought it would always be prone to be scratched open to bleed for the rest of their lives.
“Just talking! No chasing! No danger.”
“He just sat on his chair and stayed quiet.”
And they did.
“If you were surprised I was still here when you woke up, you better get used to it. I’ll be here every night and every morning that you’ll have me.” Another kiss was placed on Sherlock’s neck, but this time, there was a nip added to punctuate his point.
“You figure out your issue while Molly and I go into the kitchen and gather some plates and make some coffee.”
“Stay here with me until help arrives. Okay?” A pallid expression washing over John’s face.
John clenched around Sherlock and smiled at him, a wicked curve to his lips.
“Weird that we’re talking about how we smell. It’s nice, though. That we’re beyond all the ridiculous shit we did to censor ourselves, before.”
Tonight was their last night there. They’d already cancelled one of John’s physio appointments so they could stay two additional days, and they were hesitant to cancel the one scheduled for tomorrow afternoon.
I watched my words land, and John’s resolve crumpled.
“Yes, John?”
“Jesus Christ, Cara.”
John smiled up at him and saw the concern, worry, and fear slide across his best friend’s face. Every time he saw Sherlock’s emotions so clearly written there, John is reminded how far both of them have come.
“You really don’t.” He laughed anyway.
“I have the bite marks under my jaw and across my chest to prove you were there. I can’t wait for someone to see them.”
“Don’t make me have someone pass you a note with ‘Do You Like Me’ and underneath, a ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to circle and have it passed back to me.”
“I know I’m not an easy person to help. But, how about this? How about I promise you that I will let you do anything I need you to do for me, after I find that I’m unable to do it after trying for myself?”
“That’s it. Keep your foot behind us; give me the room I need to make this good for you.” John’s right knee pushed Sherlock’s right thigh forward and then his left hand found its way back to Sherlock’s warm skin. He dragged it in circles over his chest and belly, scratching his nail across the coarse hair around Sherlock’s leaking cock. The right half of Sherlock’s body was on the bed, his left half against John’s heaving chest. His hand settled over Sherlock’s heart and he pressed his hand against it, feeling it pound against his palm. As the ferocity of John’s thrusts increased, Sherlock went limp in John’s arms. Each forward press lifting Sherlock off the bed.
‘Please don’t remember the aquarium. Please don’t remember the aquarium.’ John silently thought.
“I do fancy you.” Objectively, at any rate.
“I am very sorry that you weren’t sure of your place in this family, Sherlock. I will do better for you. For us.”
John looked confused. “I don’t think I do. I’m not really sure.” It was then that John gagged. He dropped his chopsticks on the table and brought his right hand to his mouth and pressed against it. Sherlock let go of John’s left hand as John raced to the bathroom. Sherlock was right behind him as John fell to his knees in front of the toilet and forcefully vomited up his dinner. Sherlock placed a hand on John’s back, slowly rubbing in comforting circles.
“Good morning!” He noticed Sherlock’s phone. “Case? Lestrade? Kind of early for Lestrade to be texting, but the criminal class doesn’t keep to regular business hours, I suppose.”
Sherlock turned slowly, his arms to his sides. John’s face looked hopeful. Hopeful? That couldn’t be right. His eyes were certainly playing tricks on him.
All at once, John seemed to be able to make himself the doctor instead of the patient.
“Is there anyone else around? Do you think someone’s already called the police?”
"John?"
“Sherlock. This surgery is serious. My range of motion will be compromised for the rest of my life. There is also a chance that the fusion won’t work. At my age, bone regrowth isn’t always guaranteed. There’s always the chance of a non-union result.”
“I’ve already lost the plot with this thing, and I’ve only been wearing it for three hours.” He tipped his head forward and it landed on Sherlock’s shoulder. “This really sucks, Sherlock.”
Sherlock stepped forward and cupped John’s chin with both of his hands. “If there was ever any doubt that I am yours, your disbelief will be quelled before we exit this shower. I’ve never loved anyone before. Not like this. And I’ve certainly never loved them enough to be in a situation of this magnitude. I didn’t know I had an ‘it’ before I met you, but you’re ‘it’ for me, John. No one else. Not before you. Not now. And not ever.”
“This is such a common procedure, they’re going to let me go home in a few hours. I’m going to be fine.” Something about what John said snapped Sherlock out of the revolving scenarios that were playing across his vision.
“I grew tired of breaking off pieces of myself and giving them away and no one ever giving me any part of themselves in return. There are parts of me that, I fear, will always be incomplete. Every time I snapped off a piece of myself, there were fissures and cracks left behind. You’ve been the glue that’s mended me, John. I don’t think I would be here if I hadn’t met you. I owe Mike Stamford a great debt.” Sherlock inhaled sharply, trying to keep the growing wetness from spilling from his eyes.
John got up from the bed to retrieve an old shirt, then got back on the bed and wiped off Sherlock’s chest, as well as his own. He leant to the foot of the bed and pulled the kicked-away duvet up and over their bodies. They laid side-by-side and just looked their fill.
“Gweg!!!”
“The way he was sat on his chair… He only ever brings his knees up like that when he’s upset. Anxious or angry.”
“I’m not a twit, John. I know I’m a good-looking bird. I’ve had plenty of people tell me so. But not you. You tell me how much I remind you of Sherlock. I see it a bit. I also have my own eyes, and the blind would be able to tell that Sherlock is more than fit. He’s downright gorgeous. And I know that you know that.”
“I don’t understand.”
Sherlock’s brows raised almost to his hairline.
“Oh. He’s got it. The genius finally got it.” Molly’s grin was entirely smug.
“Da? Can I sit wif you on da sofa?”
“Yeah. All the time actually. But, something seems a bit different with you tonight. You’ve got a look in your eyes. Are you all right?”
But, before all of that? Cake.
“Jesus fuck!”
“Oh. I’m sorry, Sherlock. That just really feels nice.” Against his better judgement, John’s neck went limp and his head tipped forward until his chin met the base of his neck. Sherlock decided to massage John’s other shoulder at the same time, sans gel. The top of John’s head tickled Sherlock’s chin. Sherlock spoke into his hair:
“At the first hint of danger, we leave. We’ll have her with us and I’m not up to snuff right now. Might not ever be again.”
“Christ, John. I should hope so. I’m quite looking forward to it.”
“Wowsie ohduh!” At the mention of her name, Rosie decided to join the adults in conversation.
“Speaking of, I also brought the other ice pack with me. Let’s get you back down here and settled and I’ll swap out the packs.” The pain sapped all the fight out of John. He let Sherlock help him back down to his back, and he tucked the new ice pack around John’s shoulder. This one was a bit smaller than the other.
John shook his hands dry, flinging cherry-scented droplets around the small room. He jogged towards the kitchen and barrelled into the room, with no regard for his own safety.
“What?”
“And if a little bit of you should happen to rub off on her, I’d be all the happier. Although, having two geniuses in the house for the rest of my life sounds a bit daunting at the present moment.”
Sherlock’s left eyebrow raised. “Be careful about promises you can’t keep.”
“John?”
game on the coffee table and ran over towards Molly. Sherlock was able to intercept and put himself between Molly and Rosie and take the pie box from her. He rose it over his head and walked right through the still-opened door to the flat, into the hall and then through the door that led to the kitchen. He tiptoed into the room and put the box in the refrigerator. That could wait until after supper. Molly distracted her by shaking the pastry bag. “I have Parkin and Shrewsbury Cakes!”
John and Sherlock received the news a short time after John regained consciousness. They stabilised him, got him into a room, and Sherlock was there waiting to see him while the nursing staffed fussed with his IV and got his pain medications sorted.
“I’ve never properly thanked Mike. For introducing us.”
“I’ve bumped my head, is all. Can you make sure she’s all right? I really don’t want her to get all worked-up over this.”
“I don’t need you to feed me, Sherlock.” John’s lips became a straight line. Sort of like the emoji he sends to Sherlock when he disapproves of one of Sherlock’s life choices.
“Could you grab the keys and give them to Sherlock for me, sweetheart?” John’s breathing was laboured and his right hand was palmed against the door.
“Firstly, the medication is to help a chemical imbalance that’s been exacerbated by trauma you’ve experienced. Please stop dismissing yourself as weak. It took more strength of will and character to tell Ella about how you were feeling at your last appointment. Secondly, I always feel loved when I’m with you. Your penis is usually irrelevant in most cases we’re in each other’s company.”
“It was. Mary. My wife, Mary. She shot him.”
“Oh no. John. I’m so sorry.” Sherlock’s stunned reaction to the situation was suddenly replaced with a knot in his belly.
“Usually?”
“Easy with that kind of talk. I won’t be up for any of that for a few more weeks. At least not the good stuff.”
“She sounds wonderful.”
“Yeah, yeah. I know. Fucking hilarious.”
********************************
They stood simultaneously and took a step forward. John tried to lift his arms to go around Sherlock’s shoulders, but a grimace passed over his face. “Nope. Arms will have to go around your waist. Can’t get them up that high, you ostrich!”
“I meant that. Mean that. What I said. That wasn’t just heat-of-the-moment stuff there.”
John was given his surgeon’s first surgery of the day, at 07:30. Despite the early hour, he’d already been admitted and was lying on a narrow (and not very comfortable) hospital bed; an IV cannula was inserted and taped down on the top of his right hand. A pulse oximeter was clipped to his right index finger. The patient information, and allergy bracelets hung loosely around John’s right wrist. About thirty minutes ago, a nurse hooked him up to all the necessary machines, which included getting him wired up to a heart monitor. They attached compression pump stockings to his calves and ankles and also put a soft pair of yellow anti-skid socks over the stockings. If someone walked in the room not knowing any better, it would appear to be a serious situation facing the room’s occupants. But Sherlock didn’t seem to realise that the situation wasn’t nearly as severe as his emotions were leading him to believe.
“Da?” She looked around the room for her father.
As soon as they were in their most comfortable positions, John began to move. John’s left elbow pressed to the mattress, his hand went to Sherlock’s right cheek, his thumb dragging across his cheek.
“Could’ve happened a bit sooner, but I suppose I should just be happy with things as they are now, yeah?”
“Shit. I can’t. Shit.” He inadvertently broke the sexiness of the moment. Sherlock laughed. “I can get the other side; get in while I finish disrobing.” John turned towards the shower but looked over his shoulder at the picture Sherlock made:
Sherlock knelt on the floor of the car and held John’s hand. He wanted desperately to put his arms around him, but there wasn’t enough room to do so, and he was also wary of hurting him in his current state. He brought John’s left hand to his mouth and kissed and kissed it until the sound of sirens cut through their tense silence.
“No. I want to do this out here. May I?” John’s breath caught in his lungs. His body refused to move. He was only able to nod his head, once, and briskly at that. It was enough to get Sherlock to move.
Sherlock woke first. At the realisation that John was still there with him, and that his arm was draped across his torso, Sherlock’s sigh was a mixture of elation and relief. Last night had been the first time he’d ever engaged in a sexual situation with anyone. He was forty-three years old and John Watson was the first person he’d ever slept with, both literally and figuratively. He’s also never woken with a bedmate before this morning. The warmth of someone else in his bed a completely foreign, but apparently welcome, occurrence.
“Since we’re both up right now and have nothing on for the rest of the evening, would you still like to take a shower tonight?” John turned to face Sherlock at the bottom of the stairs. Although Sherlock couldn’t look John in the eyes, the right side of his mouth and face quirked up into a smirk, clearly giving himself away. John was delighted.
“So you were listening earlier.”
“We wuz wookin at fwowers!”
“This is your fault.”
“You were just trying to help her escape him, John. That was an almost impossible situation. You were a teenager, your early 20s. There was only so much you could do for a grown woman who wouldn’t accept your help.” That didn’t seem to deter him.
After their encounter the night before, John didn’t need to use too much of the lube, but he didn’t want to make Sherlock’s second-time painful if he could help it. He rolled to his back and slicked himself up and spread a bit around Sherlock’s hole. Sherlock gasped at the sensation.
"Can we crack on here, please? I’d really like to get some sleep tonight. I’ve got physio tomorrow morning, and I told Rosie we’d take her to The Science Museum after." Sherlock just stared at him. The look resembled awe.
“You absolutely were, John.” Sherlock’s breathing was becoming laboured in spite of his attempt at indifference to John’s efforts.
Sherlock's eyes went wide. He moved further into the sitting room and sat beside John. He took his left hand. “You banged your head while playing with Rosie two hours ago. You don’t remember?”
Rosie was unfazed by the commotion happening in the kitchen. “I wuv him, too. Iz fine, Daddy. Can I caw him wuv, too?” Sherlock dropped the spoon he was using to the floor. It bounced off the linoleum.
“What for?” John got up and carried Rosie into the kitchen on his right hip. The four of them were now huddled at the back of the kitchen; Rosie at eye level with all the grownups, looking at each of them as they spoke.
"You just did, you cock."
“We’re very lucky, John. To have finally found this with each other.”
“John, please don’t say such things.”
Sherlock tightened his arms around John’s torso and pushed his mouth to John’s left shoulder. He mouthed against the three scars there, kissed them all, and moaned John’s name as he began to thrust.
We winked in unison, and it was then that I knew that we were both on the path to the light that we’d both been searching for our entire lives.
“Most of my memories of you and me continue to make me smile. There are a few I’d like to forget, though.”
“I don’t know what this means, what I’m about to say, in the grand scheme of the world. With over seven billion people on this Earth. But. The man that you are? Is the man I need, John.”
It was their third anniversary. Sherlock made a point, on all of their anniversaries, to adhere as closely as possible to all wedding gift traditions. John liked traditions. So Sherlock learned to like a few of them, for John’s sake. As always, Sherlock delivered.
John closed his mouth. “Fucking Christ.”
“Thank you for taking care of me. And Rosie earlier. You’ve been wonderful.”
Sherlock’s soporific voice pulled him to the other side. “I LOVE YOU! SHERLOCK!”
John felt the tears burning behind his eyes. “I’m so proud of you, Sherlock. For letting yourself be loved. For letting yourself feel worthy of it, even if you don’t believe it some days.”
“I have seen many beautiful places in this world. Have I ever told you?”
“Oh, dear! I’m so sorry! She just wanted to see if the petals were soft or not! My apologies!”
Sherlock lowered his head. To the woman across the street, it would most likely appear that John shared something and he was further investigating John's theories.
“I think I am.”
“Always.”
“What the hell is wrong with him?” Sherlock whispered to Molly.
Sherlock settled on a frozen lasagne. He walked through the bathroom door to find John sitting on the toilet seat lid, cradling his left elbow, his left temple against the cool tile wall. Sherlock closed the door behind him.
“Sherl, Sherl-ock. Faster. Please, sweetheart. I’m close. That feels so, OH! good. Oh, I’m sorry, love. I’m not going to last much long-ger.” John stretched his neck to try to kiss Sherlock, but he missed his lips and got the tip of his nose. The sound of the water pounding on their bodies as it rained down the slopes of their skin was drowned out by the sounds of their hard breaths and John’s moans.
“Our landlady? Mrs Hudson? The evening I met Sherlock at the flat to see it for the first time? She insinuated that we might not realise there was an additional bedroom upstairs.”
When they regained consciousness, their suspect was gone, and their car was wedged underneath an off-duty double-decker bus. The bus had toppled over and was lying on the side and hood of their car.
“I don’t deserve your compassion.”
“I’ve literally never heard you say that while we’re pursuing a suspect. And not in many other instances, come to think of it.” A sly grin.
“Not to diminish what you’ve both just told us, but I believe I can speak for my wife when I say we’ve always considered Rosie to be a part of this family as soon as she was born. Our boy loved that girl as if she was his own from the moment he met her. Don’t concern yourself with the formalities, John.”
“I’m a doctor, Sherlock. I know all that. But sometimes, the symptoms don’t go away. They’re there for the duration someone takes it. You either learn to live with it, or get on the antidepressants carousel and try and find a med that works for you, while also not having life-changing side effects.”
“That’s right. Everything’s okay!” John’s thumb continued to caress Sherlock's stubbled face, across that diamond-cut cheekbone, and the angel-made curve of his lips. He pulled Sherlock by the chin towards himself and placed a modest kiss to his dry lips. “Go get her out of the tub before she wrecks the place!”
"Christ, Sherlock!” John’s neck tilted forward as his body wilted and then he tipped toward me. I rearranged myself and mirrored his position on the sofa. I pulled him against me and he pressed his right ear to my chest. It seemed that holding each other was something we were going to do now.
“Instead of being a detective, you should have been a physical therapist or a masseuse.”
I was so stunned by his sudden proximity, my limbs robotically did as he’d requested. He sat down beside me and turned to face me.
“Come with me. Please?”
“I usually am.”
John brought his right hand to Sherlock’s face and scratched his nails lightly across his cheek.
After weeks of sleeping next to one another, touching each other over the top of their clothes, and kissing as chastely as they were able, here they were.
