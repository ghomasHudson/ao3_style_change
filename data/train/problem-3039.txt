“And? Is that the entire story? You had to interrupt me for that?”
“’Course I did, Cas,” Dean replies, rubbing circles on Cas’ back.
“Heh, sure.  Claire might not be the most graceful thing on two legs, but boy can she book it when she wants to.  How’s Jack doing?”
“But, Balthazar,” Cas cried, “I don’t know anything about party planning!  Isn’t that usually what Anna does?” He had come into the senior partner’s office thinking they would be talking about a recent case and instead had been handed a project that had nothing to do with practicing law.
“Well, did you ask your mama?”
“Emma!”  Cas hurries towards the customer service counter and his baby girl.  “Mama!” Emma turns and reaches out for him.  How lucky could Castiel be that a nice man, a decent man, has found his daughter and kept her safe.  He grabs her from the man and envelops her in his arms.  “Oh honey, you had mama so worried!”  He discretely scents his daughter while kissing her forehead.  “Never do that to mama again,” he whispers in her ear.
“Dean, I know how frustrating this is for you that I haven’t told them yet.  To be fair, I don’t tell anyone at the firm anything about my private life. It’s not you, it’s just” Cas paused, clearly looking for the right thing to say in this moment. “I want to keep what we have between us.  I still don’t feel like I know everyone at the firm well and I don’t want to be the talk of the office because of my personal life.”
“Yes, I haven’t seen you and Amelia at the Roadhouse for months,” Cas replied.  It had been Mother’s Day the last time Sam had brought Amelia into the Roadhouse.  The couple did not have kids but Sam liked to joke that Amelia mothered all the pets and pet owners in the area in her job as the local veterinarian.
“Dean Winchester!  You’re a sight for sore eyes!”  Cas watched as Jo Harvelle ran over and jumped into the man’s arms.  He’d never seen Jo act that way over any man.  She was usually the girl with the “take no shit” attitude that would smack down any man or woman that couldn’t keep their hands to themselves.  To see her acting like a high school girl was quite a surprise.
“No more arguing, Cas, okay?  I’ll be over in twenty.”  Dean smiles as he hangs up his phone and throws his bag over his shoulder.  The overnight bag might be a little presumptuous since he’s never stayed at Cas’ before, but he can crash on the couch if necessary.  Won’t be the first time and, considering his sister-in-law is about to pop with her own pup, won’t be the last time either.
Later that night, after Cas comes home with the shopping, after Dean shows him the letter to Santa that Emma has written, after Cas cries into Dean’s shoulder while hugging the stuffing out of him, after Cas proceeds to kiss Dean silly, after Dean puts Emma to bed with the promise that he will make her the special pancakes in the morning, they lay on the couch and talk about what this means for their future.  There may or may not be more kisses.  Okay, there are totally more kisses, who is he kidding?  Dean doesn’t want to spoil anything, but he thinks he might just have to accelerate his plans to propose to Cas since he’s going to be Emma’s dad and all.  Best Christmas ever.
Dean and Cas both talked about what they wanted out of a relationship and maybe out of a life together.  Dean confessed that he’d have to keep doing public appearances for the next 6 months or so but he would be done with riding after the current rodeo circuit season.  Cas confessed that he didn’t really like waiting tables and would endeavor to get his teaching certificate in Texas before the school year started.  They talked about moving in together but agreed that 3 weeks was too soon to consider a change that big.  They both agreed that they would reconsider when Christmas rolled around.
It is strange listening to Dean describe his own small family.  With only one brother and a father that was absent more often than not, Cas can see why Dean and his brother Sam have such a close bond.  They also moved around a lot as pups which meant new schools and a merry-go-round of friends.  Dean doesn’t seem to have many happy memories of his younger years.  Cas can hear the wistfulness in his voice as he talks about Sam’s pregnant wife and their soon-to-be pup.  Dean wants that little pup to have a better life than he and Sam had.  It makes sense now why Dean has bonded to Emma so quickly.  Dean wants a family but hasn’t apparently found someone that wants to create one with him.  Cas doesn’t understand; Dean is everything an omega should want in an alpha.
“Mama, noooooooooooooo,” Emma cries.  Dean can clearly see that Cas is exasperated.  He can’t blame Emma because he knows that the medicine the pediatrician gave Cas probably doesn’t taste good but it appears that Emma’s antics over the few sips she needs are starting to wear on Cas.  She wiggles in her mama’s arms and Cas tries valiantly to keep her limbs from knocking over the bottle on the kitchen table.
“Are you okay?”  Dean might not appreciate being awakened by the sun in his eyes and the sound of the tractor at the butt crack of dawn, but real concern flashes in his gut to hear that Cas hadn’t been able to get any rest.  He is responsible for half of the care that Claire needs throughout the day.  Dean has started taking over a lot of the morning and nighttime routines, but Cas picks Claire up from afternoon daycare while Dean is at work.  Cas has been making her dinner Tuesday and Thursday nights since Dean had his parenting class the court was requiring him to complete before they would consider giving him full custody of his daughter.
Cas smiled and nodded before walking into the classroom. He went to his usual seat only to be greeted by Victor, one of the star football players, sitting in his seat.
"I was joking!" Cas exclaimed, still laughing.
The alpha smiled softly at his omega. "Okay. Then let's try some of these pies."
"Out," Dean growled, pulling his arm away.
"I guess not," the alpha shrugged. "I just still feel weird being the oldest one here."
"Don't worry too much over it. You guys will be fine," Benny tried to convince his friend.
"Wait. Really? You want me to do that more?"
"Or what, Dean?"
Cas raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean by that?"
Suddenly, Cas was pushed against the locker, a heavy body holding him. The omega turned to look and saw Dick's ugly smirk.
"Come on, Cas!" Gabe yelled, about to knock on the bedroom door again, but hit air when Cas opened it. "Oh, you're awake."
The omega laughed, looking down at his feet shyly. "Were you too into your music again?"
Cas started grabbing his suitcases and putting his clothes in one.
Cas shook off the fog clouding his brain from his omega instincts. He cupped Dean's face in his hands. "Yes, Dean. I really want this. I've never wanted anything more in my life. I love you so much and I want us to be permanant."
"No, it's okay." Cas smiled, folding his napkin in his lap. "This is really nice. Now I don't have to look through this whole menu."
Dean backed out of the driveway, leaving an annoyed and angry Michael standing there. The older Winchester drove to the closest Walgreen's store.
Cas came so hard he thought he was going to blackout, his orgasm tearing through him. He collapsed on Dean's chest, come and sweat sticking the both of them together. Cas twitched every so often, still coming down from his amazing orgasm. They both stayed there, trying the catch their breath, both still on cloud 9.
Cas wrapped his arms around Dean's neck. "I never tire of hearing that." He softly kissed the alpha. "I love you too."
All day was filled with fun; dress up, tea parties, coloring, tag outside. The kids were overjoyed with having their parents home and playing games.
"Gabe, I love you," Cas said, gripping both of his brothers shoulders, looking him in the eyes. "I really do. And you were more of a father to me than dad was, but I need you to loosen your reigns. I'm 22. I'm not a kid. I can handle this stuff. If anything bad happens, it's on me. I'll take the blow and try to move on. But it's my mistake to make."
"I'll remember that."
"Um, I've been doing good," the omega answered. "The morning sickness has started going away. I'm just constantly tired."
"6 fucking years, Dean Winchester!" Cas exclaimed, hitting Dean in the chest with a fist. "You didn't think of trying to contact me in those 6 years? You abandoned me, you dick!" He gave the alpha a shove. "You reassured me that
"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to give you my back story," the omega said, shaking his head at his own stupidity.
"How did you get so dirty?" Cas questioned.
Dean chuckled, leading Cas to the table where John, Bobby, Sam, and Jo were sitting. He pulled out a chair for his omega before sitting next to him.
"Yeah," Dean moaned, tugging at Cas' hair. "Just like that, sweetheart."
A knock on the car window broke the two apart. Cas straightened himself up. Dean looked out the impala window to see a woman with short dark brown hair.
They both moaned at the feeling. Dean startled at a slow pace, lazily fucking Cas. The blue eyed teenager breathed little moans, wrapping his legs around Dean's waist.
The sound of skin slapping, the bed creaking, the loud moans and groans from the couple filled the room. The air was filled with the thickness of sex and hot breath.
"I know, baby," Dean kissed the top of the omega's head. "but we're gonna have fun and relax. It's been pretty stressful these past couple of weeks."
Sparks and shivers ran down Cas' back at Dean's gruff, commanding voice, almost cumming instantly, but he had enough control. Not a lot, but enough.
The pregnant omega waddled over to him, running a hand down his abs. "You look sexy, daddy."
"Just peachy," Dean muttered. "How about you?"
Cas smiled at Dean's thoughtfulness. "What are you thinking then?"
"Okay, okay," Dean chuckled. "Let's get you in bed."
Dean easily pushed back inside Cas, starting at a slow pace again. He brought Cas' legs up to rest on his shoulders as he pounded into the omega.
Dean licked the spot on Cas' neck where his mating mark would go, his knot starting to swell. Cas was basically putty in Dean's hands. The omega was fucked out, still moaning from the over stimulation.
"Obviously." Cas rolled his eyes.
"Yes, ma'am," Dean answered.
"Cas, buddy, I really am sorry," the alpha apologized. "That was personal. That's your own stuff."
The alpha pulled Cas into him, resting his hands on the omega's waist. "This is the beginning for us."
Cas nodded. "You're right. I'm just so embarrassed about this."
"That sounds like a good color. We can always try different shades."
"Thank you," Sam says before going back to his room.
"Hey, sweetheart," a voice drawled from beside Cas. "Can I buy you a drink?"
The pace Cas kept was slow and sensual, not wanting to burn too much energy just yet. They moaned in each others mouths, their tongues wrestling for dominance.
"Well, I'll let you get back to your alpha. I just wanted to check in."
"Is there any news yet?" Dean asked.
"That's normal," Ellen told him. "Your pup is going to take a lot out of you later on."
"I think so too," Cas agreed.
"What class do you have next?" Dean asked, trying to keep the conversation going.
"Good," Dean said, putting the battery powered lantern by the top of the bed before laying down next to Cas. "How are you feeling?"
"You guys should have a gender reveal party," Charlie suggested.
"I won't be."
The double doors opened to reveal Cas and Chuck standing there. All the guests turned to watch Cas. Dean's heart skipped a beat watching Cas slowly approach him. The alpha couldn't help the tears that started falling. Cas looked at Dean, standing there waiting for him. Cas felt like he just ate thousands of butterflies.
"I am thinking of her," Cas raised his voice a bit. "She deserves to know who her father is. She deserves a family. I want to give that to her."
Once inside, Sam went straight to his room, talking about finishing homework. Ellen and Jo were at the bar working, so the brothers had the house to themselves.
The three of them focused back on the news. The governor and mayor had a press conference regarding the mess that was currently happening.
"Be careful," Gabriel warned the two, getting up from the couch to greet Cas and Dean.
"I can fuck that tight, beautiful ass of yours," Dean stated.
"You gonna show me off?" Dean asked, his eyebrow arched.
Gabe got up, grabbing Cas by the arm, dragging him into the empty dining room. "So? Are you prego?"
"Damn," Meg sighed. "You better watch him tonight. Drunk people around a gorgeous alpha like that is not a great combination."
All Cas did was nod. Eileen and Sam exchanged a quick glance before looking back at the omega.
"Are you two...y'know...mated?" The older Novak asked.
"Just go see who it is and if it's not important then come right back," Cas offered.
"What's wrong?" Dean yelled back
Dean led them to their bedroom. They got changed into their pjs before laying down. Cas laid his head on Dean's chest, while the alpha watched Tv.
"Then let's make it happen. We'll cut the guest list down."
"This is the realtor that's been helping me with the apartment search," Dean explained.
"Dean," Cas giggled.
Balthazar smiled knowingly. "Someone a little fancied?"
"Not since we announced our engagement," Eileen pointed out.
"Papa!" Claire exclaimed, reaching out for Cas.
"If you want to go through with this, then I'll be more than happy to oblige, but if you're not ready yet, and want to wait, then that's completely fine too. I'm not going to pressure you into getting mated right now."
"I told you a million times, babe, I love your pies. I know you put so much work into making them," Dean praised, rubbing Cas' thigh.
The alpha quickly put his hand on Cas' stomach, feeling the kicks. "Wow. Maybe she'll be a good soccer player."
The beta vice principal led the students in a line and motioned for them to sit on the chairs in the very front. Cas turned in his chair to find Dean and his older brothers. Michael and Gabriel were sitting next to the oldest Winchester. Cas waved and Dean and Michael waved back while Gabriel gave him two thumbs up. Then, Cas saw them. His parents sitting right next to his brothers. The happiness Cas felt now turned sour. What were they doing there? He didn't want to see them. He turned back around in his seat, not giving his parents any recognition.
"Yes. It's been so tiring. But my due date is getting closer and closer and it's kinda freaking me out," Gilda admitted.
Cas leaned down, kissing Dean softly, letting their tongues dance together, still rolling his hips.
The omega smiled. "I like the sound of that."
Dean laughed and hugged the omega tightly. Suddenly, his phone vibrated in his pocket.
"Do I need an exam?" Cas asked, facing Dean.
"Hey, you don't know. Maybe you'll find a boyfriend," Gabriel added, whispering.
Once breakfast was over, Dean cleaned up their plates, taking them to the kitchen. He started rinsing the plates while Cas stood by watching.
After they ate, Gilda ended up passing out while they were talking. Charlie wasn't too far behind. The mates succumbing to their exhaustion. Cas and Dean looked at each other, amused. They figured they would stay there just in case the newborn woke up and let their friends sleep.
"Castiel, look at me," Dean ordered.
The beta rolled her eyes, shaking her head. "No. My roommate decided to bring her 'boyfriend' over while I was finishing my last class. I walked in, and let me tell you, I have that image seared in my brain."
"Are you sure you're okay?" Dean questioned, putting his hand on the small of Cas' back as they continued walking to their 2nd period.
Dean chuckled seeing Cas' cheeks full, like a chipmunk hiding nuts, and sat next to him.
"See, Cassie? You have nothing to worry about," Gabe added.
"Oh my god," Cas moaned, his heels digging into the alpha's back. "Dean."
"Hi, daddy," Cas bubbled, bouncing up to Dean innocently, looking up at him with big blue eyes.
The older Winchester moaned as Cas pushed his ass harder against Dean's dick.
"What do you mean?" Cas questioned.
"You brought your camera?" Dean questioned. "It's not going to be too dark to take pictures?"
"How was school, sweetheart?" Dean asked, reaching for Cas' hand across the table, squeezing it.
Cas grabbed Dean's hand, squeezing it. "I'm...uh... I'm pregnant."
Cas smiled up at Dean, leaning up to kiss his jaw. They walked back to Dean's room, as Sam was walking out of his.
Cas hung up with Dean, still sitting in the nurse's office. He grabbed his things, walking up to the nurse.
"No, thank you," Cas deadpanned, eyes still on the menu in his hands.
Dean walked in, looking at Cas with concern. "Are you sure you're okay?"
"That's not fair!" Claire declared. "You can't hide in your room!"
Dean swallowed the lump in his throat. "Y..yes, sir."
"No. I'm working on the seating chart for the wedding. I need to finish doing this. My mom needs to confirm everything," Cas explained.
"Nothing happened, okay?" The omega snapped, crossing his arms. "Leave it alone, Dean."
"Now, Dean, place the ring on Castiel’s finger and repeat after me: Castiel, I give you this ring..."
"Thanks, Dean," the younger alpha smiled.
"Burgers it is," the alpha agreed, pecking the omega on the lips.
"Perfect," Cas commented, strapping their daughter into her high chair and wrapping a bib around her neck.
"I really thought this was going to be your breakthrough moment," Charlie muttered, taking a sip of her water.
"I know," Cas breathed out, running a hand through his messy hair. "I just don't want to face my brothers. My parents will still be at work, thankfully, but I know Lucifer will for sure be there."
"Coolio," the guy says, giving them finger guns.
"That's a little weird."
"Dean-"
Dean started tickling Cas' ribs. The omega started laughing, trying to push Dean away.
"Looking at the directions?" Dean scoffed, then tried finding the instructions from within the mess of tent. "I saw the directions already," he lied, trying to look like he knew what he was doing.
"Why are you here, Gabe?" Cas asked.
Sam walked over to the living room, taking a seat opposite Cas, a water bottle in his hand. Cas looked up from his sketch book, smiling at the younger Winchester.
Cas smiled. "I guess you have a point."
"Ding, ding, ding! We have a winner," Cas teased, kissing Dean softly.
Cas' eyes lit up. "You liked me too?"
They both got out of the car. The alpha shook hands with the omega woman. Cas stood beside Dean, not wanting to get in the way.
The mattress squeaked with every thrust Dean made, the headboard hitting the wall. Both of their moans filled the room and the scent of the alpha and omega mixed together perfectly.
The light from the rising sun came through the window curtains, shining into Cas' eyes. The clock read 7:28 a.m. Cas grumbled, turning to bury his face in Dean's chest, but realizing Dean wasn't there.
"Where were you? I was looking for you," the omega said, pulling away for the hug.
"But it was good, wasn't it?" Dean hinted jokingly.
"Let's just eat dinner first so we have the energy to have sex nonstop."
The alpha gave Cas some juice while he grabbed a beer. He put everything they needed to make chicken salad sandwiches. Cas brought some chex mix too.
After grabbing his possessions from the classroom, he started walking the empty hallways to the nurse's office. Once there, he knocked on the door before opening it. The nurse sat on a stool, tending to a beta male that looked like he got into a fight.
Cas quickly obeyed, turning over to face Dean hovering over him. Dean's eyes flashed red, seeing his beautiful, naked, omega, ready to be fucked and bred. Cas' eyes turned gold, watching his big, strong alpha tower over him. The omega whimpered, turning his head to show his neck, submitting to Dean.
Cas got up from the dining chair across Dean and went to sit on Dean's lap. "You don't have to worry. I'm always going to be yours."
"I'm always hungry," Cas mumbled. "If I get fat, will you still love me?"
"Cas was the one that came on to me first and begged me to fuck him," Dean pointed out.
"I'd love that," Cas stated. "I love you so much, Dean."
"I think Castiel Winchester has a better ring to it."
"Hey!" Dean exclaimed, splashing Cas back.
Cas crashed his lips against Dean's, forcing the older Winchester to fall back on the couch with the omega on top of him. Dean forced himself to pull away. He should not be kissing his brother's best friend.
"Yeah, sweetheart?" Dean turned to look at him.
Cas looked at his fiancé, confused. "What do you mean you don't know if you want to? It's a bachelor's party. It's your last 'horrah' as a bachelor. You're supposed to have fun."
Cas groaned. "No. We were all so busy. She must be exhausted from such a hectic day."
Cas shook his head, amused by his soon-to-be husband.
"Can you at least tell him that I came by? I just want to apologize for everything."
"So, you told Cas all of this?" Eileen spoke up.
Cas smiled. "Kind of. I feel... I don't know... Complete now. Like nothing could hurt me. I feel safe and loved."
"Good morning, alpha," Cas replied, putting the stuff he needed on the counter. "What have we talked about?"
"Shit," Cas cursed, jumping out of bed to grab his clothes. "Shit, shit, shit."
Ever since Cas invited Dean to get dinner with them one day, the alpha has been socializing with them, considering he doesn't know many people at school.
The omega clenched his fists. "They are doing fine. And I actually want to announce something, if that's okay."
Cas giggled. "Dean!"
"What do you think is going to happen with us? Are we going to build up a relationship again? Or is this just an apology dinner?"
"Sweetheart, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have snapped at you," Dean apologized.
Dean smiled. "I know. I'm excited."
"What? No way," Dean stated. "I'm not having my pregnant omega working. After you have the pup, of course you can get a job. But only if you really want to."
"Oh, nothing," Dick sang. "Just thought I'd check in on you."
Cas leaned into Dean. "Thank you, alpha."
"I love you so much, sweetheart," Dean whispered, caressing Cas' hair.
Later that afternoon, the couple walked, hand in hand, to sight see. Cas saw a cute boutique that had nothing but clothing for omegas. He quickly dragged Dean inside. Dean didn't mind shopping with Cas. He just wants to see his omega happy and smiling. Especially now that they're newly mated. The alpha loves Cas even more somehow, if that is even possible, and he feels this sense of needing to be with Cas and protect him and make sure he's happy and healthy.
"Do you want to see what I drew?" Ben asked.
As they ate dinner, Cas asked how Dean's day was. Dean talked about a customer with a really screwed up car and how one of his coworkers, Cain, fell asleep under a car he was working on.
"Oh, yeah and she wants to be in the delivery room when the pup comes," Cas shrugged.
Dean chuckled, putting the remote in his lap. "What's the matter, Cas?"
"What are we, in high school? Do you want me to pass you a note in study hall? 'Do you like Cas? Check yes or no,'" Charlie joked. "Come on, Dean."
"Yeah," Cas breathed, wiping his bottom lip with his thumb. "Do want to try some more?"
"I want to know, but if you want to keep it a secret, then I'll wait," Dean added.
Dean chuckled, kissing Cas softly. "I wanted to try to make our first Valentine's day to be special and romantic and perfect. Just for you."
They both stilled when they heard crying coming from the baby monitor Gilda had beside her. They looked at each other, tiny flecks of panic going across their faces. Dean turned the game off, standing from the couch, Cas following suit.
"Gabriel!" Cas chided.
Dean snorted. "You are not a morning person."
"Who says we have to spend a lot of money for a vacation?"
"Hey, you two." Their friend Meg sauntered over, smiling. "I didn't see you yesterday. I was looking for both of you."
Cas blushed more than he did the whole night. "You're really sweet, Dean."
Cas didn't realize he was crying. He wiped his tears with the back of his hands and smiled, looking at Dean's watery eyes.
"Nice to see you, Mr. Novak," Dean shook his hand.
"Yeah?" Dean asked, his face lighting up.
"You know what, Naomi?" Dean started, gritting his teeth. "Cas made his choice. Now, you're allowed not to be okay with it, you're allowed to not like me, but at the end of the day, Cas is happy. He wants to be with me. So, we may not like each other, but we need to be civil when we're around each other because like it or not, we're going to be in each other's lives for a very long time."
They ate and caught up on everything going on. Mary started her rambling about Sam and Eileen getting married there, at home and not back in California.
"I know. But I'm scared of you not coming home. I'm scared of you coming home not yourself anymore. I'm not gonna stop you, but I'm just scared," Cas blurted.
"Please, alpha," Cas whimpered.
"I didn't say no."
There was a knock on the front door before it opened. Meg waltzed in wearing a dark green bridesmaids dress.
Cas stifled his laughter in Dean's chest, cuddling closer to him. The alpha rested his chin on the omega's head, rubbing his back.
Dean led them to the living room to sit and catch up while they drank coffee and ate donuts.
Cas wore a teal t-shirt dress with black leggings and some black boots. He made sure to fix his hair. The omega loved going out with Dean. It gave him a chance to dress and look nice.
"Yeah," Dean sighed. He handed over the bowl of dry cereal to Sam. "Here. Eat something. I'll go get ready for school."
"Oh, I know," she said cheekily. "He's an alpha."
Cas pulled away, breathlessly. "What are you doing? We're in public."
Cas smiled a little and nodded. "Okay."
"Here. You can hold my hand," Claire offered her hand.
"I, uh, I love you too," Dean said, hesitating a bit. "Yeah. I love you."
"Good for you, Sam," Cas added, impressed. "I hope you two used protection. We don't need another pup just yet." He rubbed his stomach.
"Harder, please, alpha," Cas whimpered, moving his hand to grab at his untouched omega cock.
"Well, it looks like we'll be alone soon. I guess I scared that guy into leaving with his friends."
"Yeah, it's been good," Benny said nonchalantly. "I already got drafted. I'm leaving to the middle east next month."
The door connecting the kitchen and the dining room swung open, Michael waltzing in holding to bowls.
Cas let out a small giggle, kissing the alpha, finally bouncing slightly on Dean's lap. Dean moaned deeply, grabbing Cas' ass with both hands harshly, squeezing the globes of flesh.
"You like it?" Cas asked, twirling.
The oldest of the brothers went downstairs to the kitchen of the Harvelle's house, right next to their bar. He saw Ellen already up, making coffee and Jo eating a bowl of cereal at the dining table. .
Cas smiled a little. "He's very attractive."
Dean chuckled. "I think you're just hungry. We had a pretty long, stressful day."
Richard got up. "You'll regret that," he says, walking away.
The alpha helped Cas out of bed. They went to the dining area to eat their dinner. Cas couldn't help but moan at how good the burger was. Dean thought it was adorable.
"Baby?" Dean called out, still half asleep.
Dean chuckled, placing a kiss on the omega's head. "You don't need to be sorry, baby."
"It's okay. You'll feel it sooner or later," Cas said, trying to reassure Dean.
Later, as the sun was going down, the couple sat at the fire pit that Dean started. Cas cuddled up to Dean, wrapping the blanket tighter around him. Dean wrapped his arm around Cas, rubbing his side. The omega leaned up to kiss Dean's cheek.
"Yay!" The two youngest Novaks cheered.
Cas nodded. "So? Dinner?"
"I didn't fight for you or our pup! I ran away like a fucking coward. Alphas are supposed to be strong and protect our families. Why would you even want a weak alpha like me?"
"No offense, Dean, but I think I'll do better on my own," Cas joked.
"What are you doing out here?" The omega asked, crossing his arms.
"Is it working?" The alpha asked, trying to hide his smirk.
Cas looked over his should at the alpha. He chuckled, shaking his head.
Cas' jaw dropped, stunned at how handsome his alpha looked. "Dean, you look so sexy."
Eileen chuckled a bit. "It's okay, Sam. I know you're still learning how to sign, but you signed something way different than what you said."
The owner nodded and cut slices of the pies; dark cherry, caramel apple, pecan, and strawberry rhubarb. Cas smiled watching his fiancé enjoy every bite.
"Don't you think your mom and dad should be there? This is their grandchild," Dean pointed out.
Cas groaned. "Mom, don't start. I'm not in the mood."
"I'm sorry if it's not a fancier ring," Dean murmured.
"No, it's okay," Cas said, dismissing the issue. "Um, thank you, I think."
Cas relaxed in Dean's arms, burying his face in his chest, basking in the alpha's calming scent. He explained what happened at school with Dick and with the principal. Soon, Dean was contributing to the angry scent in the apartment.
"You like the way my cock feels, don't you sweetheart?" Dean purred, nibbling on Cas' neck. "Stretching you wide."
Cas grabbed his bag and keys as he headed for the door.
"Well, yes," Naomi hesitated. "but I want your wedding to be special and elegant."
"Mhm." Charlie pursed her lips. "A little fancied are we?"
"Of course, sweetheart," Dean answered, placing a kiss on the omega's forehead.
"Oh," Dean sighed. "I'm guessing mom didn't tell you."
"That sounds great," Cas agreed. "Come here," he wagged his finger towards him.
"Dean, I'm still in high school. I'm still a child in my parent's eyes and my older brother's eyes. I can't just not tell them I'm having a pup with the alpha next door that's 10 years older than me. I think they need to know," Cas explained, looking down at his stomach, placing his hand on top of Dean's.
The Winchester started kissing his way up to the omega's face. Cas moaned through the rough kiss, feeling the itching of Dean's beard. Moving his hand towards Dean's crotch, Cas rubbed at the hardness in the alpha's underwear.
"Births are -fuck!- they're spontaneous, Dean!" Cas said through gritted teeth.
Claire went with Anna and Charlie to ice skate while Cas waited for Dean. He watched Claire holding hands with her aunts, laughing and having fun. Cas smiled fondly.
"I mean, yeah," Dean shrugged. "We're on good terms. We're picking up where we left off."
The alpha took out a piece of paper and wrote his number on it. He slipped it in Cas' back pocket, almost pressing up against him.
Dean tore his eyes away from the waiter to look at Cas. He surged forward to capture Cas' lips. Cas hummed in surprise, but quickly melted into the kiss, allowing Dean's tongue to explore his mouth. The omega held one of Dean's cheeks, moaning. Dean finally pulled away before they started getting too heated.
"It'll be fine either way, right?" Cas looked up at him, running his hand through the alpha's hair.
"Doesn't your family have Sunday dinner together?" Dean asked, a eyebrow arched.
"Well, I have a feeling it's a girl," Cas added, rubbing his stomach. "Gabriel wants a niece."
The young omega straightened up, swallowing. "I, uh, I'm really not sure. I just took a pregnancy test this weekend."
Dean chuckled. "Go ahead, baby. Its not going to be as good as the original."
"Okay. It doesn't look that bad," the alpha stated. "At least not enough to need stitches."
"You did it!" Claire exclaimed.
"I found Dick Roman forcing Cas to blow him," Sam whispered, trying not to get angry.
Crowley saw the tears falling from the omega's eyes and the helpless begging. He pushed Dick back away from Cas.
Dean raced upstairs and checked on Cas. He just finished throwing up in the trash can by the bed. The omega wiped his mouth, looking up at Dean with an apologetic look.
"There's always a reason behind your blushes. So what is it this time?" Gabriel continued to push.
Dean lovingly watched his new mate fall asleep. He smiled to himself, rubbing Cas' back soothingly.
Slowly kissing his way up, Dean stopped when got to Cas' head. The alpha pushed one finger in the omega's slick covered hole, pumping the digit in and out. It wasn't long until he added a second finger.
"Hmm," Gabe hummed. "So, is it another omega?"
"We just want you to know that we support you and Dean," Lucifer continued.
Maybe going to the bar & grill next door to the college wasn't that great of an idea, but Charlie and Cas were hungry and they didn't want to go too far.
"What?" Dean blurted out. "I don't want your mom in there. It's supposed to be just you and me."
The alpha got up from the bed, quickly shedding himself of his clothes. He kissed Cas, dominating it, while Cas stroked Dean's cock.
"I'm pretty sure the French don't have problems with it," Cas retorted, smirking.
"I wanted to surprise you." Dean shrugged.
So, Cas headed to Dean's locker, not giving it a second thought. But he wasn't there either. Maybe he was running late. Or maybe he skipped school. But he would've texted Cas.
"I'll be there in ten minutes," Dean declared, hanging up.
"Don't make me take you right here in the kitchen," Dean challenged.
Cas got off of Dean's lap, both of them walking to their bedroom. Dean flopped on the bed, breathing a sigh of relief. Cas got on the bed and straddled Dean's hips, kissing the alpha roughly.
Cas rolled his eyes and turned around to a pair of jade green eyes staring at him. The pair of mesmorizing green eyes belonged to a tall, muscled alpha with freckles splayed across his nose.
"I'll worry about that," Dean stated.
"It's fine." Cas smiled. He looked back at the knothead that was hitting on him. "As you can see, my mate is here. I don't need you to buy my drinks."
"Cas, you are the most precious thing in my life and carrying our precious pup. I can't think of living a single day without your beautiful face laying next to me. I know it's only been six months, but I know you're the one I want forever. Castiel Novak, will you marry me?" Dean proposed.
"We'll finish this tomorrow," Dean promised.
"Damn, you've got an arm on you," Dean said, rubbing his chest.
"Sounds perfect."
(See the end of the chapter for
"No, I'm not," Dean defended.
The alpha looked over at the young omega, eyes scanning his porcelain skin, dark, messy hair, bright blue eyes, and his small, young, frame. He ran his thumb across Cas' cheekbone, making the omega look at him.
"You look so fucking gorgeous," Dean answered.
"Wow," was all that Dean could say.
"Of course this is what I want. I love Dean," Cas said as it was obvious.
"Good question," Cas pondered. "We can go with a gender neutral color. I don't really want to stick to gender norms anyway."
Cas sat next to Dean on the couch. "Can we talk?"
There was a pause.
"What happened?" Dean asked, wrapping his arms around Cas.
Dean kissed Cas softly before sitting at the dining table where Cas had his coffee and toast.
The Week of Christmas
"If I ever say no to that, just kill me," Dean joked.
"Interesting choice," Cas joked.
Dean spooned up behind Cas, his and the omega's hands on Cas' stomach. Cas sighed contently, melting in the warmth of Dean behind him.
"I should've known," Dean chuckled before pulling almost all the way out to then thrust up harshly. "I know you like getting that sweet hole of yours abused."
"You're getting big," Michael commented, looking at Cas' stomach.
"Yes," Claire smiled. "Uncle Gabriel twirled me in the air."
Once Sam found out where the voice was coming from, he ran over to the scene. He barely saw what was going on before tackling Dick to the ground. Cas quickly got up, moving away from the two alphas on the floor. When Sam started throwing a few punches, Cas quickly went over to pull Sam off.
Cas made a high pitched whine as his toes started curling and knuckles turned white by holding the counter. "Dean...alpha...I need...I..."
Cas let go of Dean and went to hug his older brothers. "Thank you for coming. It means a lot."
"It's okay. I know. Besides, I think she likes you too." Cas smiled confidently up at Sam.
"Daddy?" Cas croaked out, lifting his head to look at the alpha.
While Dean was out, Cas finished up his history homework and decided to grab a bowl of ice cream, snuggle up in bed, and turn on Netflix while Dean was out with Benny.
Dean drove them to the high school. There were kids in gowns roaming around by the auditorium entrance. Parents were taking pictures of their embarrassed children. Cas got out of the car and saw his friends. He pulled Dean along to meet up with them.
"Oh, I'm sorry," Gadreel shook his head at his assumption.  "It's just, I've seen you two together. I thought maybe...," he trailed off.
"Castiel, we're sorry," Chuck started. "for everything."
"If you don't go, I'm still going," Cas said, turning his back towards Dean. "Can you zip me up?"
"You're a disgusting asshole," Cas exclaimed, slapping Dick across the face. "Those were private. Why the fuck are you doing this to me?"
The Winchester sat there on the couch, starting to think about what was discussed before the couple fell asleep. He wanted to go back in the army. But knowing Cas was scared of Dean leaving and potentially not making it back home left him feeling guilty.
"Hmm. I guess you're good at handling Cas then," Meg teased, winking at Cas.
"Okay, I get it. He's a lot younger than me," Dean replied, not even fighting it. "but dude, you don't even know how hot it is to be fucking a twink like him on a daily basis. Especially now that he's pregnant, he is sensitive everywhere."
"She told me I should come talk to," the alpha said, shrugging, his hands in his pocket. "She said I should try asking you out to dinner this Friday."
Cas pulled away from Dean, wiping his bottom lip with his thumb. "Sorry, Sam, but your brother is very attractive. Inside and out."
"Yep." The beta nodded. "Name's Garth, by the way."
"I thought you wanted a part of this," Dick objected.
Cas snapped out of his head and turned to face Dean. "Yep. I'm definitely ready."
Cas rushed out of the kitchen. Everyone was staring at him, hearing the mother and son fight back and forth. The omega grabbed Dean's hand and pulled him towards the front door.
After parking a block away from the party, Cas and Dean walked the rest of the way, holding hands.
"It's tradition to sleep in separate places," Cas informed.
Gabe sighed, his face softening. "Just be careful. I don't want to see you heartbroken."
Monday, when they went back to school, Cas was excited to see Dean again. The Novak got to his locker to grab a couple of books. He smiled when he saw Dean, but the smile didn't last long. A very attractive girl walked up to Dean, flirting and touching him.
When the waiter left, Dean leaned over to caress Cas' cheek and grabbing his hand to kiss it. Cas smiled, blushing.
Cas squinted his eyes at Dean before punching his arm. "You're an idiot!"
"It's not going to happen. He's changed. I can see it. He's not that 18 year old that left me. He matured. I know he's going to stick around."
"Sorry," Cas muttered.
"Do you think you're ready for this?" Cas asked, looking up at Dean.
"How do I look?" Cas asked.
Cas stared at Dean with disbelief. "Why....why didn't you just tell me that? You could've called me or texted me. I mean....I hated you for 6 years when I should've been hating your dad."
"That's crazy," Dean says, his hands still on his fiancé's stomach.
Cas rubbed the back of his neck. "I technically didn't have a mate, just a very serious boyfriend. We dated all through high school and our freshman year of college. We wanted to mate, but...it's a long story."
"Not a chance in hell, you pig," the Omega growled.
Cas rolled his eyes and looked at Balthazar. "Any help?"
"No, you didn't."
"Hey. Are you my roommate?" The alpha asked.
Mick didn't look at the other alpha. "Um, hey."
Dean pressed his forehead to Cas', pushing in until he was fully seated inside the warm channel. Cas cradled Dean's cheek with one hand, both of them looking at each other lovingly, as Dean waited for him to adjust to the intrusion.
"Yes, daddy," the five year old complied.
"So pretty, baby," Dean purred, feeling at the stockings.
The alpha looked over at Cas and smiled, watching Cas stare at his ring. That smile is what Dean wanted to see, even if he has to pick up extra shifts to afford it. The ring wasn't all sparkling diamonds, but Dean got the next best thing and he was so happy to know Cas loved it.
Cas' woke up quickly, his head shooting up from his desk. When he realized he fell asleep and now everyone's eyes, especially the annoyed teacher, was on him, blood rushed to his cheeks in embarrassment.
Dean rubbed the back of his neck. "Well, I guess both. I mean, if you're willing to. I would understand if-"
"Yeah," The brunet said, smiling. "I'll see you around. I'm sorry again."
Dean noticed how shy Cas was. He thought it was cute. He wanted to keep talking to the beautiful boy. Dean knew it was kinda wrong, but all he really wanted was to get in Cas' pants.
Cas smiled, running a hand through Dean's hair. "It's gonna be a long time, Dean."
Cas narrowed his eyes skeptically. "What are thinking?"
Dean chuckled. "These were outside my door. My mom left them with a note saying to give these to you."
Mary hugged her son, tearing up. "I'm so happy for you two."
"Hmm," Dean hummed, kneading the globe of Cas' ass. "Let's see how well you suck daddy."
"Of course. We wouldn't miss it. We had to see you walk the stage," Naomi said.
"Chill," Gabe reassured him, but then winking at Claire.
The two of them were entangled together. They didn't leave space between them, just skin sliding on skin. Everything felt amazing. Cas could practically feel all the love Dean was radiating. It felt so good to be feeling that again.
"Dean," the omega chided, rolling his eyes. "I'm happy at my life right now. I, just, I don't know. I love you, Dean Winchester."
Cas finished changing Claire's diaper and got her dressed in a pink dress with cherries printed on it. He brought her to the dining room where Dean was setting the breakfast down.
"I don't know," Cas scoffed. "I thought you meant like staying in a cabin or even a camper or something. Not a tent on the ground."
When Cas got home, he got undressed to one of Dean's t-shirts and underwear. He decided to do some homework while Dean was at work, but before he did that, he whipped up some dinner. While the chicken cooked in the oven, he went to the bedroom to do a little bit of homework.
Michael nodded. "I will."
Dean loosened his grip, letting his hand fall back to his side.
The two roommates walked to the cafeteria passing alphas and betas looking at Cas and staring jealously at Dean, thinking they were together.
"Hell yes," Dean breathed out.
The omega shook his head, not looking at his brother or daughter.
"What about that beige sweater?" Cas hinted.
"I'm hoping not the dirty pictures of us," Dean joked.
"You did what daddy told you. Good boy," Dean quickly texted back.
A waitress walked over with a bottle of wine and two menus. "Compliments of Abner."
Cas nodded, smirking. "Definitely."
"Is everyone ready for your tiger football team?" the announcer asked, his voice booming with the microphone.
The sound of the timer going off separated the two boys. They both looked over at the nightstand where the pregnancy test sat.
"Right. Okay. Here I go," Dean breathed out. "Castiel, the day I came back from training and saw you in my parent's house, it was like I got hit with a million cupid arrows. I fell head over heels in that moment. I knew then and there that I was going to marry you and you would be my omega. And not in my wildest dreams did I think I would be right. Now here we are. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me. I promise to keep you safe and loved every single day of our lives. I promise to never break your heart and to take care of you no matter what. Castiel Novak, you are the love of my life and I'm so glad to be able to call you my husband."
"Yeah. That wasn't one of my strong suits." Dean shrugged, rubbing the back of his neck. "How have you been?"
"What would you do if I decided to go back into the army?" Dean asked hesitantly.
"Looks like we have 1st, 2nd, and 6th period together," Dean added.
"I've been wanting to see you guys again. I've been missing you too," Cas replied.
"Wow," John finally said, nodding. "We're gonna be grandparents."
When they finally made it home, Dean and Cas both breathed a sigh of relief. The omega carefully carried Claire to their apartment, with Dean right by his side, making sure the newborn was okay.
"Oh, fuck," Dean groaned as Cas licked up his length.
"Cas, buddy, what's wrong?" Dean asked, motioning for Cas to come in.
Cas' stomach was in knots. He pushed his food around on his plate, trying to find the guts to just come out and say it.
"It doesn't matter, baby. I'm just glad you're the perfect omega for me," Dean admitted.
"That can work," Cas replied. "A couple more days and we'll be married."
"I know, gorgeous," Dean grunted, pulling Cas' hair back to expose his long, tan neck. "But you're gonna cum when I tell you to cum."
"This is ridiculous," Dean groaned. "My fiancé needs me. He's scared. I can't leave him alone."
Cas nodded, chewing on another bite of the baked good. "I'm just happy I got accepted into the university 25 minutes away."
"Did you tell that bastard that you're spoken for?" Dean lowered his voice a little after seeing the fear in Cas' eyes.
"We can change that last part," Dean hinted, moving to kiss Cas.
"You have an attitude today," Dean mentioned, grabbing his jacket and keys. "Do I need to spank you again?"
"Mine," Dean growled, finally sinking his teeth into Cas' neck, breaking the skin.
"Good. My dad and Bobby were talking about opening some more stores and if I wanted, I could manage one by myself," Dean told him.
"Damn," Dean whispered to himself.
"Thank you, Dean," Cas said, smiling up at the kind Winchester.
"I'm sorry, Cas," the beta Winchester apologized. "I'm just excited for my first grandchild."
Cas chuckled, rolling his eyes. "I didn't think it was such an aphrodisiac for you."
"Wait. What? Why would he even say or do anything like that?"
"I know you're going to look at me different and won't want anything to do with me, but I didn't leave because I was scared. My dad kicked me out and threatened me not to come back or..."
Dean walked back towards the bed, seeing Cas rubbing his eye with one hand while the other was holding his neck where the bite was.
Luckily, Luke calmed down and was now looking up at Dean with big light brown eyes. Dean couldn't help but smile, his mind wondering to the thought of holding his and Cas' pup in about a couple of months.
"We're taking a trip to Ellen and Bobby's place. They're hosting this year," Dean said, kissing the omega's hand.
"Yeah. How can I forget? I hope she's an alpha," Dean insisted.
Luckily, their table was in the back, away from most of the noise. Dean pulled out Cas' chair before sitting across from him.
"Hey, beautiful," Dean greeted from behind the omega, wrapping his arms around his waist.
"I'm guessing you like it," Cas said, wrapping his arms around Dean's neck.
"This is Gabriel, right?" Cas jokingly said. "Last time I checked, my big brother didn't want a job. He was trying to 'find himself.'"
With a heavy sigh, he unlocked the door and walked in, closing the door behind him. Gabriel was sitting on the couch watching tv with Samandriel and Hannah.
Cas stuck his tongue out at him, grabbing one of the bottles of juice Dean was putting in the ice chest.
Michael and Gabriel stood up also, shouting encouragements. Cas couldn't help but smile at his family and wave. He shook all the school staff's hands after grabbing his diploma.
When the movie was over, Dean drove them to a crowded restaurant he made reservations for. Dean helped his pregnant omega out of the car. They walked hand in hand into the restaurant.
Enjoy chapter 3! I hope everyone likes it. Sorry for any mistakes or confusion. Keep the kudos and comments coming! It makes me so happy to see everyone liking something I wrote.
"Thanks, mom," Dean replied, hugging his mom.
"So, what are you saying? I'm still a dork?" The omega asked, narrowing his eyes at Dean.
Mary pulled away from the hug. "We'll leave you to get settled in. If you need absolutely anything, don't hesitate to call." The beta hugged Cas, rubbing his back.
"What can I do for you, Castiel?" The alpha principal asked.
"I can't say no to you," the alpha shrugged. "You always give me your puppy dog eyes just like Sammy used to."
The thing is, Dean just knew his father would be back to get them to go to another town. Hunting was more important to John than his own children, or so Dean thought. The Winchester's father was obsessed with finding revenge for his wife.
"I know," Naomi sighed. "I came here to apologize and try to get you to come back."
After everyone ate, they gathered in the living room by the Christmas tree to exchange gifts. Wrapping paper littered the floor as everyone opened presents.
Gadreel smiled widely. "Great. Awesome."
"You're right. I shouldn't be this upset about it. It's something your passionate about," Cas admitted.
"Stupid Dick Roman harassed me. He thought he could just use me as some kind of sex toy. But Sam came and scared him away," the omega explained, still not looking at Dean.
Another member of the football team bumps into Dean and he goes stumbling, grimacing in pain. I'm the only thing keeping him upright from that hit and last nights anger rises again but I force it down and grab a sign from the janitors closet. I put the out of order sign in front of the boy's toilet and drag Dean inside.
I bounce over to my dad and slid into the car with a silly grin on my face. He scratches his beard and raises an eyebrow at me.
*         *          *          *
I swallowed and closed my eyes again, hoping that if I couldn't see everyone it would be easier to talk about. I felt dirty, like a had just rolled through mud and then landed in dirt. But I could only feel fear, nothing else, that's why I needed Cas here, he grounded me.
"You guys are the single most adorable thing I've ever seen. Oh my god why did you wait this long to get together?" I blush a dark shade of red and Dean just rolls his eyes, squeezing my hand against his.
"I leave you all alone for two minutes at my house, and someones already screaming." We all laugh and Ash pipes up from his position on the floor.
He sits sown inside it and I rumage around in the glovebox to pull out the first aid kit. I begin to dress his wounds and when that's done I gently kiss each knuckle ending with a kiss on his lips, slow and soft.
Chuck walks in with a cup of coffee and freezes at the sight of the room. Sam, hugging a grown crying man that Chuck has never met. Me laying in bed with Cas sprawled across me and hugging me tightly.
"Does anyone know what they said to Dean?" The room falls silent, then Lucifers voice quietly answers.
Dean squeezes my hand.
"Well, the doctor said that there's nothing broken and I don't need stitches, I just need to take some pain medication and keep these bandaged." He smiles and touches his knuckles lightly.
"Hi, I'm Dean Winchester. Who are you?" I ask, cringing internally at how awkward that sounded. I hadn't really ever talked to anyone outside of Dad and Sammy, and if I did it was an absolute necessity. This was weird, starting a conversation just for the fun of it, I liked it.
Then she kisses him and my heart stops. Dean stiffens and tries to pull back but the demons behind him keep his head and shoulders still. He squirms in his chair and Abbadon pulls back, running a hand through his hair.
"I thought you said no inappropriate questions!" Dean says while flicking my hand, sending sparks down my arm. Keep your cool, Cas. It's only been a few days.
He knees me in the stomach and I double over, then he kicks my knee out from under me and suddenly I'm on the floor. The kicks follow soon after and I curl into a ball trying to protect myself from their anger. A stray boot connects with my ribs and I hear a crack, followed by a scream. The scream was coming from me and I try to crawl away but someone kicks my face.
Sam gives Dean one last squeeze and pulls back, leaving Dean looking like a lost child. I frown and limp over to him, holding my arms out. His bottom lip wobbles and I see him try to mentally pull himself together, sighing he drops his shoulders and holds his arms out.
"Ask your big brother what he did last time I took the money and he couldn't get a paycheck the next week. It wasn't the first time and it wasn't the last either. I close my eyes and avoid replaying those memories, but in doing so I didn't see the king hit my father threw at me.
"Castiel tells me that you like straight black with two sugars?" I blush and he grins.
Cas, Sammy, Bobby.
"I don't know, Sam. When I'm done with you I'll go grab some food and call my dad. Can you patch Dean up while I'm gone?" He nods slowly and I finish cleaning his face and hand him an ice pack. His lip trembles and I sigh, leaning in I wrap my arms around his shaking frame and let him cry into my shoulder.
I feel Dean's choice of memory slip away and suddenly we're somewhere different.
"They-" Sammy stops abruptly and glances down at me, I give him a nod and my dad looks at us, frowning in concern.
I can't wipe this cheesy grin off my face.
All of his equipment, healthy complexion, hands full of food and a grin on his face. Why was Dean different? I decided I'd follow him next week and see what happened.
"Yeah, De, am I allowed to go to friends houses?" I ruffle his hair affectionately and push him towards to door, one day and already socialising.
I continue to pound into the trunk as my screams of anger turn into sobs of fear, I slow my punches down and continue to sob. I feel a hand on my shoulder and turn to see Dean behind me, I lean into his touch and he holds me under the willow as I cry.
"She leaned in and whispered 'We're going to fix you both, you just can't see it yet. Me first, then the big boy over there.' She pointed at one of the jocks and I freaked, tried to get out of her grip but the guys behind me just held me down and dug into my scars, I assume you saw them." I feel Cas start to stiffin in realization at what had happened.
I smile at his words.
I sigh, knowing today is going to be the same as every other day. Go to the new school, put on the popular guy mask, come home, put on the obedient son mask, go to bed and try to sleep. I frown at the thought of another wasted day but smile at the thought of Sammy at school.
"He's in a private room, no one knows what happened, not even Sam." Lucifer shakes his head and my heart thumps in worry. I take a deep breath in and wince, causing everyone to panic and ask if I was okay. I hold my hands out soothingly and they go silent.
"I forgive you. I know you're tearing yourself up over the fact you didn't stop them, but Cas, you would have gotten your ass kicked as well, then we'd be in real trouble. Thank you for staying with Sammy." I open my eyes to his sincere face, so different from the usual grin that was plastered there.
"When I was younger I was captured by a Wendigo on a hunt, it thought it would be fun to hear some screams. Dad saved my ass before it really got started, but these never healed fully." He shrugs. I pull him towards the bed and he hugs me gently. He takes a deep breath and I feel him smile against my shoulder.
He pulls me closer and I deepen the kiss, loving the feeling that it bought. He pulls back and rests his forehead against mine.
I groan and slouch down in my chair.
It's a very confusing concoction of feelings.
"Well Dean, this had been incredibly fun but looking at the time, I have to get home." I resist the urge to frown, instead glancing sadly at the empty milkshake glasses.
"Yeah, it's me Dean." He opens his eyes and scootches across the bed, lifting up his blanket. I smile warmly and climb in next to him,  shivering when my skin comes in contact with his hospital clothing. I wrap an arm around him and he puts his head on my chest, still curled in a ball. He grips my clothes tightly and breathes deeply, causing me to wince in pain.
The room froze for a second before erupting into madness, people were yelling but all I heard was the rustle of sheets as Cas wrapped me into a hug and the words of comfort he whispered into my ear as my emotions drained out of me, replaced by nothingness.
"Cas, calm, okay? You stress and you'll have a panic attack then both of us will fail, okay?"
"Please Cas, just go to cl-" I press my lips to his briefly to shut him up and then move so I can sit on the bench next to him while he explains. He sighs and closes his eyes. When he speaks his voice is hollow and monotone.
"I love your son and I don't want to see him hurt, okay?" My dad nods before smile sadly and leaving, passing a shocked Chuck on the way out. I give Cas a quick squeeze before waddling over to Sammy, avoiding the pain.
"Right, well. I have good news. Guess what Sammy? I finally was able to buy an apartment, just five minutes away from Cas!" Everybody cheers and Sammy gives me a hug. I had been working really hard the last few months to try and get this apartment and I finally saved up enough.
I blink my eyes open and try to focus on the layer of pain, hoping it would wake me up. I squeeze my eyes shut and hear cruel laughter and a person's sobs. not just anyone's sobs, Deans.
"Are you okay? What's happening? Why are you both so tense right now? Sorry, I invited my dad but I needed help and medicine. How's your head now Sam? I also got dad to bring some food cause I know what's..."
"Well, sometimes he comes home sober and is the best father you could wish for, he's interested in our lives and he shows affection. We talk until midnight and play games like a normal family, he doesn't remember the bad stuff he's done. But this dream, this version of my father that I love? Is only about thirty percent of the time." I close my eyes and adjust my position a bit more, which causes Cas to cease stroking my hair and move on to tracing the lines of my face.
"Jesus, Dean. When did you learn to cook like this? It's incredible." Sammy mumbles through a mouthful of food, I give him a look and he swallows his food before repeating the question.
"Unfair."
Abbadon pulls away, biting his lip and then giggles.
Cas' POV
"I could kiss you right now Cas but we're in public. I'll do it when we're alone." He pulls the jumper on at it fits, it's even a little big on him. Black, with ACDC splashed in red across the front, perfect for him. He snuggles into it and shoves his hands in the pockets, proabably trying to warm them. I smile slightly at the sight of him in a big jumper.
"Now boy, tell young Sam that all he has to do is keep talking to this girl of his and everything should follow. Just do what feels right for him, okay?" I smile and nod, that was reasonable advice.
"Be careful Dean, take care of yourself for once." I roll my eyes and shoo him out the door before climbing out of my own, swallowing a wince.
"It's either me or you Sammy. And it sure as hell ain't gonna be you. Go." I look away and nod my thanks to Cas who is dragging Sam to my car and pushing him in. I turn around and everyone on the football team is standing ahead of me.
"Well, after Cas was knocked out, they all just waited for him to wake up, so that was thirty minutes of me worying he wouldn't take the next breath in." I feel a squeeze from beside me and I smile into Cas' shoulder, glad he was there.
"We did indeed, Dean."
1- get into the football team, stupid jocks
I take off my shirt and groan, the pain from the movement sending spikes up my spine.
"Come on, there's room for you next to us in here." He smiles gratefully and snuggles into my side, his head facing away and his back against my ribs, just like when he was younger.
of people touching me and I have to lock it up to keep working in the diner because I need the money. Cas moved in and I have to pay for him now, the extra water, electricity and gas. Don't get me wrong, I love having him here, it's just hard because he's paying for college."
I freak out and quickly try to dry my tears before he comes any closer. He strides forwards and I find myself scrambling backwards, pressing my body into the couch as much as possible and squeezing my eyes shut. I brace for impact, anything, and jump when warm arms surround me. I pause before realising what was happening.
My breath leaves my body as I survey the area. It was a small clearing with fairy lights strung up in the trees, and right in the middle was a large mattress covered in blankets and pillows. I cover my mouth with a hand to cover my huge smile. I walk over to the matress and see a radio next to a large basket filled with food.
I cover my mouth with a hand, my eyes wide in shock. My best friend had gone through so much already and yet he still hid it well. I watch as he drops his head again and stares at his hands, I slowly lower my hand and touch his shoulder. He looks up at me and I almost cry at the look on his face, pure fear. I soften my voice and whisper
"You two make an adorable couple, just make sure your bedroom door is always open Cas, otherwise you two have to hang out in the loungeroom." Dean turns a vibrant shade of pink and dad just laughs at him.
"Just kiss already, the news told us you were boyfriends." I open my mouth mortified but Dean shrugs and turns to face me, a grin on his face. I narrow my eyes at him and he leans in, ensnaring my lips in a passionate kiss.
I struggle as Alistair and Azazel walk up to Cas and grab his chin.
"We did, Dean"
I grin and instantly accept, that means a pay rise. I slouch in my chair and laugh softly, covering my face. Bobby smiles at me and gestures to move onto the next problem, I rub my eyes and sigh, The happy laughing mood vanishing.
But being the arrogant idiot he is, he was probably just partying too hard and just fitting in at the new school.
But Sammy was behind us and I couldn't do that to him, no matter how much I wanted to.
I open my math book and begin my calculus homework, then my English essay and then my chemistry assignment. About five minutes into advanced chemical equations a body plops down into the chair opposite me. I jump, startled and a little dazed but grin when I see Cas.
We pull out our history and I lean over, explaining how we should display the art. We talk for what seems like hours and when I look outside, it's dark already.
Sammy glares at me and then his expression softens as he takes in the sight of my face, which was probably bruised everywhere. Then he bites his lip and leans back on his heels.
We eat the dinner I'd made while talking softly and listening to the radio. I bite my lip and smile at Cas again, loving the way his eyes light up when he talks. I grab his hand and kneel in front of him, he smiles vaguely and I grin. He has no idea.
I decide to wait in the car for him and instead turn on my music, the song going to one of Deans favorites, Highway to Hell. It suited him, especially with all the unknown fights he seemed to get in. Every few weeks he would come to school with some other injury from a fight, I just supposed his cocky attitude was that irritating to everyone. I smile to myself and open a book on my phone, beginning to read.
It was bad.
"Thank you, there are a few allegations. Did your father leave you for long periods of time to care for your brother? Did your father leave you insufficient amounts of money? Did your father abuse you?"
I grin at him and nod my head to whatever the principal was saying.
"Sorry Charles but I gotta agree with Cas. Steve Rodgers is pretty good." Charlie sighs and crosses her arms.
"First off, sit down." I follow his instructions with shaky movements and the brothers stand in front of me. Sam with a hard expression and a gun held steadily, Dean with a gaping mouth and a pale face.
I reach over to tie my shoelaces and hear Sammy's groan of annoyance from next door. I grin, knowing exactly what my little brother was about to say.
Collapsing onto my bed, I fell asleep instantly, worrying about what I would tell Cas tomorrow.
Because she deserved it.
"Sure Dean, as long as you don't ask anything inappropriate." He just laughs and shakes his head.
We slow dance to Elvis, his breath tickling my ear as he sings softly. I bite my lip and sigh, relaxing fully into his arms, letting his words wask over me, and when the song ends I pull him in for a kiss.
I walk over to my wardrobe and pick out today's outfit, feeling slightly silly as I realize I want to impress Dean a bit more. I pull out my black jeans and baggy jumper with the Twenty One Pilots symbol printed across it. I put a singlet on, then a shirt, then my jumper, to top the outfit off I place my navy blue beenie on my head and my black and red converse on.
"So, Cas, we got clownfish." I give him an incredulous look, secretly happy because I did the same species last year.
Dean turns to face me, looking guilty. I try to ignore the way he bites his lip by looking around, I notice the students rushing to their next class. I grip deans shoulder and tug him towards our classroom so we won't be late. He smiles and talks to me on the way, Benny had his class in another room so we're meeting him later.
He was alone, in a motel room full of strangers, talking about his past and future.
"I have to drive to my date, wow, classy Cas." I roll my eyes and kiss him gently again, savoring the feel of fireworks before we have to leave. My mind begins to tick off date ideas until I come up with the perfect one, I grin and we leave the school.
Okay, maybe I liked him a little, maybe.
I try to shake the ever growing feeling of hopelessness and heave myself off my bed, rubbing my face dejectedly. I sigh again and stretch, wincing a bit at the ache near my ribs. I would have to be careful at tryouts today. I weave my way around the junk littering our motel room and manage to reach the kitchen, which is the only clean thing about this place. I insisted upon a fully functional kitchen wherever we stayed so I could cook for Sammy and keep him healthy, even if I had to go without.
"Why are you holding a gun to Cas' head?" I freeze at his words and my eyes widen, they couldn't be, could they? Hunters? My heart thumps wildly in my chest and I try to control my erratic breathing. I'm technically not a supernatural being, just descended from one, but hunters usually shoot first and then ask questions.
"Either if you play football? We're holding tryouts after school and we're looking for two newbies." I smile, remembering my old school's football team.
"I...um...sold myself?" I pose it as a question and flinch violently when Sam and Cas gasp and begin yelling at me.
I was so whipped by this blue-eyed boy.
The cool air bites at my nose but I needed the privacy with Dean as Abbadons and the football teams words bounce around in my head. I reach the willow before Dean and the second he races in after me I grab his face and crash my lips into his, needing to feel him. He kisses back with the same desperation and the rest of the world slips away into nothing, until its just us.
"I feel like the one thing I had control over in my life, has been taken and I don't know what to do. I feel lost and scared and I don't want Cas to feel the same." I notice the tears forming in Dean's eyes and I quickly interrupt.
I'm frozen still, overwhelmed by the beauty and care placed into the scene before me. Dean smiles again and gently pulls me onto the mattress where we sit close together.
"I don't object! He's yours! All yours!" We all laugh and Chuck calls us in for dinner. We sit down and I smile at Sammy when he walks into the room with Gabe and Lucifer. We laugh over dinner and I stand up at the end.
On the other hand, nights were the worst for Dean. He had confessed that he knew I was in his dream and he blurred a lot of things so I wouldn't see them, which made me worry. Dean had nightmares every few nights, some of the demons, some of the monsters he's hunted and some of Sam and me dying.
"I know, Ben. But it was crooked." I grin and Ben smiles back, I hear heels behind me and Dean groaning.
He runs a hand through my hair and traces the line of skin showing between my pants and shirt. I caress his face with one of my hands and weave my fingers through his hair, he moans slightly into my mouth and I push him into the trunk of the tree, briefly pulling back to growl at him.
The Diner was completely full and the kitchen was in full swing, yelling everywhere and chatter from the guests. I take a quick break, leaning back onto the bench and taking a gulp of water. I sigh and my head droops forwards a bit, the food smelt so good and it was not helping my hunger at all.
We turn and face the daunting day ahead of us.
"Everything here is in order, but we have to question your choice of residence." I sigh, knowing that I would have to explain my life story.
Castiel Novak, my guardian angel, at it again.
"I love you, Dad. Thank you for everything." Claire cries, tears streaming down her face.
Thoughts weaselled their way into my head, poisoning my mind and preventing me from believing that Cas could care that much. That I could have a best friend, that I could have someone that cried for me. Another sob escapes my throat and Chuck casually walks back in, freezing when he sees my tears.
I'm so proud of him.
"T-There's more, De." Sam begins and my breath leaves my body. I frantically look at Cas and he nods grimly, my worries ease a bit and I know Cas won't leave me.
Crowley sneers and lunges at me, knocking me right on the jaw, I stumble back and he lunges again, but this time I pull my hand back and punch him straight in the nose, knocking him to the ground. The rest of the team growls and races towards me. I throw punches and hit a few people but they keep coming, my adrenaline wears off and my head swoons, sending me stumbling.
"Can you pass me my shirt, Cas?" I sigh and pick up his shirt, worrying about him again.
"Why must we do exams at the end of the year! We have one day to study guys, one day! Our exams start tomorrow and Charlene is giving Dean's face a massage." I throw my pencil at his face and we all laugh when he splutters and glares at me.
I watch Cas walk off with an open mouth and wide eyes. I slowly swivel back to Sammy and see that he's biting his lip and staring intently at the ground, I slip Cas' number into my pocket and instead make my way over to my little brother.
"I don't own a laptop so I kinda can't do" he gestures towards my laptop "that. Sorry man, I usually do my work at the library." He laughs and I try to join in genuinely but I can't help but observe his soul, quiet and reserved.
"I remember this," Sam whispers next to me.
"Already working on it." I wink at him and move to stand next to Cas, who was staring at me weirdly. I try to block out his look and focus on my breathing. Crap. My chest tightens and I try to control my breathing to stop the brief panic attack before it happens. Memories flash through my mind and I try my best to bottle it up and save it for when I'm alone.
I take another deep breath and breathe out slowly, trying to calm my racing heart. My pulse manages to slow and the tears stop long enough for me to stand up and wander back to Sam and Dean.
"Whatcha gonna do, kid? Nothing, that's right, nothin'. You're a freak ass nerd who's clothes don't even fit. No one cares if we beat you up."  Azazel sneers and throws Sammy to the floor at my feet. I see a black eye and a bloody nose and the tears threatening to spill over his lashes. I reach down and pull him up, letting him lean on me for support. I give him the once over and deem him able to walk.
I feel hands grip under my arms and suddenly I'm on my feet. Cas starts to move towards my car and I whimper as I breathe in.
"No." he whispers.
"I can dig Elvis, you?" He nods, a slow smile spreading across his face. I smile softly back and bow to him, holding out my hand.
I shake my head at the memory and tip toe downstairs, quietly making breakfast for Sammy. The usual morning routine, except this time I had to avoid passing out.
"No, no, no. You couldn't have seen that you weren't meant to see that. Goddammit Cas, please tell me you didn't see what I saw." He turns to me and stares at me pleadingly.
That night was one of the worst nights of my life, waiting for Dean to wake up.
Dean! My eyes fly open and I frantically search for the blond haired boy, looking everywhere for his green eyes. When I find them my whole body freezes.
So here I am. I tap my fingers across the steering wheel and try to calm my breathing as I trail their car to where they lived. I was excited and scared at the same time, I was following my best friend but I was intruding into his life. The nervous flutter in my chest turned into a full on thumping as we pulled onto a familiar road. It was my street, the other end of my street, and that was my house up the road.
"Dean, we should probably keep this on the down-low until the football team relaxes a bit." He frowns but releases my hand. I smile at him and he grins back, I grab his hand anyways and drag him to class.
The class goes crazy and Dean blushes bright red, smiling at me warmly. One by one the students come up to us and apologise, shaking our hands and congratulating us. By the end of it, I just want to sit in the corner and sleep, but the bell rings and we make our way out of the classroom.
I watched as he bent his knees and held his arms out slightly, I was eager to see what the boy could do. Crowley lunged at Cas and Cas grabbed him and threw him to the floor without changing his deadpan expression. My mouth dropped open slightly, Cas was a lot stronger than I originally thought and I was grateful that we would get him on the team.
"Good morning, Dean. Breakfast will be ready in about 10 minutes, Castiel is currently showering and Sams in his room. Get cleaned up after Castiel and then I'll bring you some breakfast okay?" He shuffles the newspaper before turning down to read it again.
He waves goodbye to me and wanders off to engineering while I collect my things for advanced biology. I was stuck with Azazel, who I swear only had this class to learn where to hit to cause more pain. I sit right at the back but unfortunately Azazel walks in and smirks at me as he strides over to my desk.
Chuck lets out a breath of relief and pulls Cas into a firm hug before sending him inside. I smile and give him a kiss before Chuck pulls me in for a hug as well, I gently hug back and he mumbles his thanks before shuffling back inside.
"I'm feeling creative tonight, what's the challenge, Cas." Cas grins at the game we started playing a while back. He would give me a list of ingredients and I had to make dinner out of them, it kept things interesting and Sammy loved to watch us bicker in the kitchen.
"Cas got 95.4 and Dean got 88.9, oh my god you guys that's incredible!" He hugs us both, making us all sink into the couch slightly. I grin over his shoulder and survey the lounge room with happiness. It was small but it was homey, clean, neat and perfect for us, the apartment was the best decision I've ever made, except maybe Cas.
The second Cas asked me on a date, my stomach soared and I actually felt my knees go weak, I'm having trouble concentrating on anything right now. I pack up my homework with a groan, deciding that a combination of a Friday night and a date was a perfect excuse to ditch the brain boredom.
"Come on Cas, class is about to start, we can talk at lunch, okay?" I frown and reluctantly agree. We walk to class together and a few times I had to subtly keep him upright, it was terrifying me. We hurry into class and Dean practically collapses into a chair. I hear him groan and flinch when I touch his shoulder, pulling my hand back quickly I frown at his hunched figure.
"I'm from New York actually, my dad wanted a break from the city so we moved up here. What about you?" He pauses for a second before answering,
As black dots sweep across my vision, I try to keep my eyes open but fail miserably, falling into a deep sleep.
"Look at me, bitch!" I open my eyes and see him clicking out a pocket knife. I swallow the lump in my throat, he's only ever pulled that out about seven times in my life, and none of those were good.
"See that Dean? Even Sam doesn't want to see you." He sneers and punches my ribs causing me to double over in the pain lancing across my chest. He then grabs the back of my head and pulls it down onto his raised knee. My cheekbone collides with his kneecap and I drop to the floor.
I feel a gaze in the back of my head and glance around, noticing the boy's gaze on me.
"I thought you said no inappropriate questions!" Dean says while flicking my hand, sending sparks down my arm. Keep your cool, Cas. It's only been a few days.
And I can't take it.
*          *         *          *
Over the past few months, we'd both begun to heal together and we were happier than we'd ever been, Dean especially. I have never seen him so vibrant and healthy. Our therapist told us to stick together as we grounded each other, multiple times I woke up screaming and only Dean could calm me down. But that didn't happen much anymore, occasionally I heard the demon's laughter in my dreams, but Dean's smile soon calmed me.
"He called me and said that he'd like to come over and catch up. Normally that would be great but I'm scared of what he'll think and he claims he's seeing a therapist. That's the only bit I believe, and that's cause the cops told me. So apparently he's sober and gonna try and make amends but I'm stressing over it."
A lot.
"Rest, Cas. You need to heal." He whispers before he begins running his hands through my hair. I look up at him sleepily and see how the white light in the room illuminates his eyes, making the green appear fluorescent. My eyes flutter closed and I smile at the feeling of comfort he brings whenever he's near me.
Get us out of here, I don't want to watch this!!
"She, uhh, basically, um, well, they both..." I trail off and open my eyes, looking at Cas' bandaged foot peeking out from under the covers. A deep voice echoes throughout the room, the police officer.
"You're eighteen now, Dean. I'm letting you be Sam's legal guardian, I know that he'll be better with you as his father. But please let me visit, and we can share stories."At this I glance down at Cas, smiling softly. My dad chuckles and I look up at him, all ideas of revenge for the things he's done, gone.
* * * *
"Your dad gave me pizza last night but other than that....about five or six days ago." I gasp, that's why he's so weak, he's starving. Before I can even think, I'm wrapping my arms around him and murmuring soft words.
"I-I'm not really okay at all," I admit quietly. Chuck just wraps an arm around my shoulders and leads me to the comfy chair in the corner, he sits me down before grabbing the plastic chair from beside the bed and sitting in front of me.
And I feel happy.
"Good! Alright, can you flex your toes and move up your body?" I do as she instructs and wince when my chest tightens in pain. I study my room as I move various parts of my body, white walls with photos of nature, seas and forests, mountains and sunsets. The bedsheets are scratchy and plain white, with a pale blue trim, the equipment is all silver.
"You're never home, Dad! Why can't you just let mum go and actually look after your kids for once! I just want you to stay home!" I rush through the front door at the sound of Sammy's distressed voice, still high pitched from youth. I yank open the door and drop my bag on the floor, practically sliding around the corner into the kitchen.
I was slightly scared, and by slightly scared I mean terrified. I was worried for Cas' safety and I was worried someone would jump out and yell 'kidding!' at us before we got picked on again. I hold onto his hand tightly and try to relax, letting myself fall into the conversation, finding that I liked it.
"Abbadon? She's his apprentice, they find happy mediums with each other." I close my eyes and I feel Sammy sit up slowly, but Cas stays sprawled on my chest. I open my eyes, trying to avoid crying. Sam glares at dad and then hisses quietly,
"Look, Cas, sorry about what I said earlier, it's just a touchy subject" he grins and we walk into the classroom, my mind twirling at the though if his dads work being touchy.
"Yeah, I better get going too. You need a lift?" My heart lifts at his kindness.
"Who did it? What did they do? When did they do it? Where did they do it? Why did they do it? And how did they do it? Oh, and show me as well." He swallows nervously and wrings his hands together.
I try to avoid staring at their souls and instead try to focus on their faces. That was my angelic ability, seeing the souls of others. The downside of it was, well...it made it hard to see their faces sometimes. I was able to control it mostly, but when I'm nervous it shows up again.
"What's your biggest fear?" He leans back with a raised eyebrow. I chew my lip and contemplate my answer.
I hug myself tightly and felt a blush creep up after my confession. It wasn't meant to come out, it just did. I sigh and apologise quietly, guilty for dumping my problems of Bobby. He smiles and then runs his beard.
I kick dads papers and bottles out of the way and ignore the feeling of guilt crushing my chest. I'm tough goddammit! I don't need to feel, I need to do my job!
He cries quietly with a huge grin on his face, he just nods quickly, his voice failing him. I kiss him and pull him in for a hug. He sobs into my shoulder and starts talking.
"De, how are you holding up?" He slurs, his voice slow from exhaustion.
Cas grins at me from across the table and I feel a foot rub against my calf, I narrow my eyes at him and he pushes against my toes. I smile and push back, it starts off a silent war underneath the table with Cas and I trying very hard not to laugh out loud.
The Next Day
Dean started sliding the ring on Cas' finger. "Castiel, I give you this ring..."
Cas just nodded his head. Naomi sat at the head of the table on the left of Castiel, setting the bowl of salad down.
Cas nodded, trusting Dean's words. The alpha placed a soft kiss on Cas' forehead before extending his hand for the omega to take.
"Why didn't you tell me earlier? Don't try to keep things from me. I don't want that, especially since we'll be married in a couple of months."
Since the cafeteria was almost empty, they had their pick of tables. Once they got their dinner, Cas led them to a booth away from the people that were there.
"Then why?"
"Stop texting me," Cas muttered.
"What? How the hell do you know?" Dean questioned.
"How have you been feeling, Cas?" Mary asked, sipping at her beer.
"Why?"
Dean chuckled, shaking his head. "Your hair has a mind of its own. It's always going to make you look like you just got fucked."
"Great," the Novak mother said, standing up from the chair. "Then we'll see you at Christmas."
"Sure," Dean answered, chuckling.
"That's up to you."
Cas dropped the towel from his shoulders as he grabbed a pair of pink cotton panties from one of the drawers Dean gave him for his clothes. He pulled them on before sitting on Dean's bed.
Cas grabbed Dean's hand and put it on his round stomach. "Our pup is moving."
Dean led Cas back to their table, pulling out the omega's chair to sit. Cas smiled and thanked him. Dean kissed the top of his new husband's head and sat next to him.
Before he knew it, Cas was on his back, legs spread open. He looked up at the lust filled eyes of his alpha, sending a shiver down his spine. Dean positioned himself, his cock poking at Cas' entrance. The alpha pushed in slowly, the omega's panties still pushed to the side. He watched as his cock disappeared into Cas, finally bottoming out.
Dean hummed in agreement and pushed his face back into his pillow. Cas smiled at his mate, caressing his hair.
When the game finally started, Charlie was holding up a sign that said, "Go Benny. Go Dean," while Cas and Sam just cheered anytime they made a touchdown.
"Yeah, but a phone call beforehand would've been nice," Cas retorted.
The omega stomped to the bedroom and slammed the door behind him. He sat on the edge of the bed, angry tears starting to fall. This is unbelieveable. Dean can't possibly be this naive.
"Can he come with us to see the Christmas lights tomorrow?"
"Can I have it? Please, daddy," Cas begged.
"What?" Dean asked in disbelief.
Once back at their apartment complex, Dean practically dragged Cas to the elevators. The doors closed and the alpha automatically pulled Cas close to him, kissing and nibbling at his neck.
After getting a layout of where everything was going in the venue, Cas pulled Naomi aside while Dean looked around, pushing a happy, babbling Claire.
"Please," the omega snorted. "You would have complimented yourself nonstop and slap your own ass."
The couple started getting ready around 1. They enjoyed a sensual shower together, trying not to get too heated. Cas started getting dressed while Dean was still in a towel, looking through the closet.
"Hmm," Dean hummed, thinking about the question. "Maybe to start making a better effort to save money for the pup."
Also, instead of using Google translate to write some of the dialogue in French later on in the chapter, I just put the dialogue that is meant to be spoken in French, in bold and italics. I didn't want to butcher anything.
The omega got up from the floor and went to sit next to Dean on the couch. Dean went over to the tree to grab a present and brought it over to Cas, sitting back down next to him.
"You never told me that," Cas pointed out. "All this time you never mentioned Lisa or even having been in a relationship prior to what we did the night you came back from training."
"We have to leave," the omega said.
"I don't know what I'll do without you."
"Cassie and I broke up."
"I should've listened to the part of my brain that kept telling me that you wouldn't do something like that. That there had to be something wrong. I'm sorry for doubting you."
"I thought so too," Dean said, chuckling. "So, you just up and decided to come over for me to fuck you?"
Cas fell backwards into the fluffy bed while Dean put their suitcases aside. The alpha chuckled at his boyfriend's excitement.
"I want you to have it," Ben said before turning back to start drawing again.
"You had to make pancakes," Cas joked.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah," Cas huffed, crossing his arms over his belly, not really mad.
"Yeah, hello?" Dean answered.
Cas hit Dean's shoulder with the journal playfully. "You're so mean."
"Dean! I need you!" Cas called out, almost doubling over in pain.
It didn't take as long as he thought for Gabriel to arrive. Cas grabbed his backpack and descended the the bleachers. As he turned the corner, he ran face first into a person. He looked up to see who it was.
The alpha was taken aback, not expecting Cas to actually say that quite yet. Who was he kidding? Dean had feelings for Cas for a long time. He knew in the back of his head that he loved Cas back.
"You are pregnant," Dick announced. "Someone fucked you full of pups, didn't they? Damn, I wish I could've been the one to do that."
"What?" Cas breathed, feeling like his heart shattered.
"I don't think sitting on your face counts," Cas smirked.
"Babe, where did you put the leftover candy?" Dean asked, wrapping his arms around the omega from behind.
"I'm so proud of you, baby boy," Dean praised, tucking hair behind Cas' ear.
"You look amazing, baby," Dean replied.
"He's glowing isn't he?" Mary added, squeezing Cas' shoulders.
"Shut up," Cas laughed.
"Please, alpha," the omega begged, voice hoarse.
"You're not getting fat, sweetheart. You growing our pup," Dean explained, chuckling at his boyfriend's pout. "Didn't you buy a couple of slacks that were supposed to be bigger?"
"Who do you belong to?" Dean asked, hand kneading the pink flesh of Cas' cheek.
Cas smiled a little. "At least I know I'm better than her."
"Oh, God, did you two take a shower together?" Sam groaned, stopping in front of the bathroom door.
"Get out of here. I don't want you," Dean growled.
"If we get caught once again, I'm not sleeping with you for a week," Cas said in defeat, knowing he wants his alpha just as bad.
"Yes," Naomi and Chuck said at the same time.
"Yes," Cas muttered, looking through the notebook. "I totally forgot about my journal. I haven't written in here in so long."
"Trust me. You will love this place. I'm paying for the cake," Naomi replied.
"Yeah. I decided to transfer here. I heard that this was a decent art school." Dean shrugged. "I'm kind of paying out of pocket."
After dinner, Dean and Benny went out to the balcony to drink a bit while Cas excused himself to the bedroom to finish his essay.
The three of them resided to the dining room where Cas set up for dinner. Dean and Cas sat on one side of the table, Benny sat on the other.
"Hey, you two," Cas smiled. "What's with the flowers?"
"Speaking of Sam, did he say he was coming?" Dean asked.
Dean chuckled. "You're an insatiable omega, you know that."
The alpha pushed the omega against the lockers, boxing the littler boy in. "Come on, sweetheart. Just a quick fuck."
"I feel bad though. They're struggling in the kitchen and I'm just sitting here," Cas mentioned.
Dean nodded, looking down sadly. "Yeah, I understand. I get it."
After all the thank you and goodbyes, the front door closed, leaving Dean and Cas by themselves in their new home.
The Next Day
"I... I'm pregnant," Cas stuttered, tears welling up in his eyes.
He heard a shuffling before he saw the green eyes he saw earlier. Cas faltered a bit, but tried not to show any emotion.
As the alpha was grabbing medicine and a few bottles of ginger ale and carbonated waters, he passed by the condom, lube, and pregnancy test section.
"Oh, god," Cas exclaimed, arching his back, scratching at Dean's back for leverage. "Right there, daddy."
"Hi," Cas muttered.
"Does my hair look okay?" Cas frowned up at Dean, unhappy with his untameable locks.
Lisa was getting irritated. "It meant something to me. I really liked you. I thought maybe we could start a family."
"Wait," Cas called, stopping the alpha from walking.
Dean started focusing on Cas' scent. It was calming and soothing. Cas petted Dean's hair, trying to get him to relax. Soon, the alpha started to unclench and loosen up. He sat up and blew out a sigh.
"Seek! Seek!" Jack mimicked, slapping his hands on the table.
"I love you," Dean said, tipping the omega's head up to look at him.
Cas was taken aback by the term of endearment his mother used, never calling him that before. He pulled away from the hug as Naomi let the couple in.
Cas nodded eagerly.
"Can we go now?" Dean whined.
"Fine," Cas mumbled against his pillow.
Dean heard Cas groan loudly out of frustration. The alpha went to the bedroom only to find his omega struggling to button his pants.
"Come quick!" Cas replied.
The newly married couple pulled away to face their friends and family before walking back down the aisle, holding hands.
"My new roommate," the omega stated. "He transferred here since the classes aren't that expensive."
"Is this what you're looking for?" A voice asked.
"Okay. Be careful coming home. I love you."
Cas quickly went to the living room, still in view of the front door, but where Dean couldn't see him. Gabriel opened the door with an angry, protective-older-brother look.
"Thank you," Cas replied.
"It's okay, it's okay," Dean said, pushing the omega's hair back from his forehead. "I'm gonna go out and get you some ginger ale and some stuff to settle your stomach, okay?"
"Shall we finish?" Dean asked, putting his hands behind his head.
"Well, finding myself doesn't pay me," Gabe retorted. "I'll be there in like 20 minutes."
"Mick," was the only thing Cas could say.
"This isn't funny," Cas whispered loudly. "Quit it."
Cas and Dean finally arrived to the party, Mary greeted them and let them in. Everyone was outside in the backyard, talking and laughing while John was grilling some steaks. The couple greeted everyone before taking a seat. All of Dean's family was there, but Cas' wasn't. It disappointed Cas a little, but he figured they would come later.
"Castiel?" The alpha knitted his brows together.
"Hi," Cas replied.
Dean helped Cas up, sitting him on the bed. The omega sighed, wiping his hair off his sweaty forehead.
"Yeah, I know."
The omega got up from the table of his friends and walked to the crowded bar.
"Of course I'll marry you," Cas finally answered.
Cas groaned, sitting up, rubbing the back of his head, luckily not finding any blood or wound. Dean quickly helped him. The alpha sat next to him, pulling Cas into his arms, kissing the top of his head. Cas relaxed in the warmth of his boyfriend, sighing and starting to scent him.
"I can't even read the menu," Dean groaned. "How can anyone?"
"It was a joke, Dean," Cas said before walking off to find the restroom.
"Get another suit. This is an important meeting. We need to expand the business," John reminded him.
The omega booked it to the Winchester house, tearing spilling down his cheeks.
Cas smiled, leaning back into Dean. "Hi, handsome."
"You'll be Castiel Winchester."
The alpha ran to the bathroom and found Cas holding his stomach. Dean didn't notice the puddle at Cas' feet. He was focused on why his fiancé was hurting.
"Looks like we have the same classes," Cas stated.
"I love you too, Gabe," Cas said, rolling his eyes playfully.
"I miss you guys too. But mom and dad wanted me out. They couldn't accept my pup and my boyfriend. Until they're fine with everything, I'm not going back," Cas retorted.
"Ah!" Cas gasped.
"Thank you guys, but we can't take these," Cas said, handing them back.
Cas and Dean were making out in the alpha's car. Dean found a little secluded place where they can have privacy. Not that they needed that much privacy. It never went further than a heavy make out session. Dean was fine with it. Completely fine. He just went home with blue balls after every date.
Cas caressed Dean's cheek. "I hope I'll be a great omega to you."
"You're getting bigger," Gabriel said, pulling away from the hug to see the baby bump his brother was sporting.
"Dean, you're working 10 hour days now. I can't have you do more work at home."
"Merry Christmas, babe,"  Dean said.
Cas bit his lip to stifle a laugh. "Do you need help?"
"A new camera!" Cas exclaimed. "I love it. How'd you know I wanted a camera?"
"We wanted to see if our plan worked," Mary added.
Cas bit back a smile. "Great. Um, I should go check on Claire. Thank you again for the medicine and soup. That was very sweet of you."
The older Winchester did just that, helping Cas in the passenger side before getting into the driver's seat.
Meg and Balthazar made their way to the dance floor. Charlie stopped before Gilda could pull her away.
"My alpha's huge cock inside me," Cas purred.
"The guys a douche," Dean muttered.
"The new kid?" The young Winchester's eyebrows shot up.
"Yeah. Of course."
"I can hear you thinking," Dean joked, tucking a tuft of hair behind Cas' ear.
"Jerk," Sam muttered.
"Everything smells delicious, baby," Dean complimented.
"I gotta carry my new husband over the threshold," Dean informed.
Instead of going faster, Dean pulled all the way out making the omega sob.
"Already got that covered handsome," Charlie said, walking over with two beers in her hand, handing one to Cas.
"I'm so sorry, baby," Dean apologized. "Are you okay?"
"You're welcome, Cas. Be careful walking home," Mary said, hugging Cas goodbye.
"Dean," Cas whined. "I need to come."
"No, of course not," the omega scoffed. "But what if Dean is? What if he decides he doesn't want to get married? What if he regrets our relationship and runs off? What if-"
"The one with Tessa Thompson and Chris Hemsworth," Dean answered.
"Shut up," Cas laughed.
Dean pulled his fingers out. He stroked his hard cock, covering it in the omega's slick. He positioned the head right at Cas' entrance, slowly pushing his throbbing member in.
"Fuck," Dean breathed out, running a hand through his hair.
Cas rolled his eyes at the alpha, turning back to Charlie. "We brought food. I figured you wouldn't want to cook."
Charlie snickered. "I'm sorry, but he texted me telling me to keep an eye on you. He really doesn't like the idea of you bunking with an alpha."
"A promise to fuck me good and hard by the fireplace might do the trick."
"What?" Cas questioned, confused, before seeing what Dean had in his hand. "Dean! Where did you get that?"
"I know, sweetheart, but we need this," Dean proclaimed. "I love you."
"God no," Cas breathed. "I never thought that would feel as good as it does."
"Okay, you two," Cas said, chuckling. "You both are big alphas."
"Cas, you know this is a small town. It's going to be near impossible to avoid him," Gabe pointed out.
They stayed there, holding each other, breathing in each other's scent. It wasn't until Cas started snoring that Dean decided they should move to their bedroom.
"Not here. My mom would kill me if we ruined her couch," Dean said, getting up from the couch. He grabbed Cas' hand and led them upstairs to his bedroom.
"No, you don't need to. Just stay here and I'll be back later."
"Well, I've never fucked someone that was 10 years younger than me. I definitely liked doing that," Dean retorted.
"Yeah?" Dean smiled, taking his shirt off. "Happy enough to fool around?"
"Okay." Dean clapped his hands together. "Now your dad was the champ at hide and seek. I used to play all the time with uncle Sammy."
The pregnant omega was pressed against the lockers. "It was 3 years ago. I dumped you. Just get over it already. I don't like you and I never will."
"It's a little too late for that. My life is here with Dean now. You can't just drag me back home."
"Yes, I was and I don't want to hear all of your complaints."
Dean shrugged. "I don't know. What do you think?"
"How was school today, sweetheart?" Dean asked.
"I bought handcuffs and some other lingerie too," Cas mentioned.
It was strange. Dean figured there would be omegas, few betas, and maybe some female alphas, it was a baby shower after all, but he did not expect there to be a lot male alphas. He followed Cas to sit on the couch, in view of everyone. People came over and congratulated them on their upcoming pup.
"Five minutes, Dean," Cas warned.
Dean nodded and went to work, making sure not to be too loud, moving the crib to the foot of their bed. Cas decided to let Dean put Claire in the crib. The omega watched as Dean kissed the pup's forehead then gently laid her down.
"Sam is a good name for both,"the young alpha hinted, jokingly.
With that one sentence, blood rushed right to Dean's crotch. "I'm sorry, what?" The alpha stuttered out.
"Yeah, I'm fine," Cas answered, sitting on Dean's lap. "At least my brother actually came over, even if he still doesn't approve."
Cas was still extremely shocked that this gorgeous guy is talking to him. He can't stop blushing everytime Dean looks at him.
Dean ignored Cas' plea, continuing to fuck the omega with his tongue. His chin was covered in slick as he licked and sucked his boyfriend's ass.
Charlie grabbed the paper. "Cas, I can't tell you what to do. It's your choice. I would understand if you swore off dating all together, but you're thinking of dating again, so that's good." She smiled, tucking the piece of paper back into Castiel's hand. "What do you think you should do? What do you really want to do?"
"Come here, baby boy," Dean said, helping Cas to stand.
"Answer the door while I finish getting ready," Cas told him.
Dean chuckled, picking up the 14 month old. "What is it sweetheart? You miss dada?"
I thought since it got positive feedback, I would try adding on to this.
Dean smiled softly. "I love you too."
The omega had to admit, he wish his mom was that protective of him. His mom, the head brain surgeon at the state hospital, was always busy. He guesses that's the reason why Gabriel felt the need to protect him.
Cas smiled up at Dean. "I like that idea."
Cas smiled, kissing Dean softly, letting their tongues dance together for a little while before he pulled away. He got off of Dean's lap and sat next to him.
"Holy shit!" Dean exclaimed.
"So wet for me, baby," Dean breathed it Cas' ear. "So eager for my cock. You love being fucked, don't you, gorgeous? Always ready for a good fucking."
"Yeah. I could use some loud thumping and grinding," Balthazar joked.
"I'm fine. Thank you." Cas affirmed.
Dean pulled his shirt off and took his jeans off, tossing them in the corner. Cas laid back on the bed, after taking his shirt off, rubbing Dean's chest with his foot.
"If you don't stop now, this is going to be over way sooner than either of us want," Dean said, trying to regain his breath.
Dean handed the younger Winchester half of the list. "Here. Get the last couple of things while I get the vegetables mom needs."
"Your name," The alpha said quickly. "I meant I like your name."
"So, I guess you and 'what's his name' are doing well," Dean commented, trying not to let his bitterness come through his words.
"No. I want to have pies since they're your favorite. I don't want this wedding all about me. I want you to have a say in things," Cas said.
"Fuck off."
"I'm not afraid of airplanes," Dean muttered, crossing his arms.
"You're so beautiful," Dean said, kissing Cas softly. "You're perfect, Cas."
The couple resided to the dining table and started eating their breakfast. The alpha flipped through the sports section of the newspaper while Cas ate, scrolling through his phone at the same time.
"See you later, Sammy." Dean gave his brother a hug.
"Well, I think I know just how to treat that. Why don't we step into my office," Dean added.
Dean started kissing his way down the omega's body, paying special attention to his sensitive areas, like his nipples and sharp hip bones. Before he went any further, the alpha shed himself of his jeans. Cas' eyes drifted down, seeing the big bulge in Dean's boxer briefs. The omega swallowed, the nerves getting worse.
Dean smiled. "Well, you're welcome. At least we can spend time as a family now that you don't have to worry about the wedding stuff."
"Grab a controller and play with me," Dean suggested, eyes focused on the TV.
"Here," the alpha said, giving Cas his leather jacket before getting into the car.  "It will keep you warmer than that trench coat."
"It was nice." Dean shrugged. "I was blackmailed by my little brother. He knew I was hungover."
"Since its our first time alone tomorrow night, what do you think we should do?" Cas asked flirtaciously.
Dean pulled his fingers out, replacing them with his mouth, roughly kissing him. The alpha started pushing into Cas' tight heat, slowly inching his way before bottoming out. Cas already looked fucked out and Dean loved that look, especially knowing he's the only one that can do that to him and the only one that gets to see it.
"Of course you forgot because you don't listen to me," the omega snapped, getting up from the couch. "God, Dean. How hard is it to listen when I talk to you?"
"It's it nice to see everyone here," Chuck said, side eyeing Cas. "Now that we're all here, let please grab hands for grace."
"Please."
Dean shrugged. "I've always thought you were beautiful. Even now, I look at you and I see how stunning you are."
"Nice to see you again, Dean," Eileen smiled.
They found an empty picnic table and sat down. Cas took Claire out of the stroller and sat her on his lap. Claire pointed at the swings, sputtering something.
"We don't have to go anywhere. We can have it here. You and your friends can drink since we'll be here looking after you and we'll play some games," Michael added.
"You would do that?"
Cas smiled, biting his lip. "I finally get to have sex with Dean Winchester in his famous room."
"Since tomorrow's New Year's Eve, I thought we would go find a nice place to go watch the fireworks with a bottle of sparkling cider," Dean suggested.
"In the meantime, I'll ask Sammy if he could keep an extra close eye on you."
Cas smiled, kissing Dean again before walking to the bedroom. Dean cleaned the table, gathering the dishes, putting them in the sink to wash later. There was a few things to do before the couple went to the party. One of the things being picking up Cas' dress from the cleaners.
"You're so much bigger than my fake knots," Cas breathed, arching off the bed.
"Yeah, well, I couldn't handle the idea of leaving you and Claire by yourself while I was in another country," Dean admitted.
"What? I'm just assuming," Meg defended.
The alpha shook his head. "I'm not giving anything away. You'll see it in a few days."
"Okay, okay, you've made your point," Sam exclaimed, rolling his eyes. "Really, Cas? You had to start dating my brother?"
The omega felt his husband smile and chuckle against his ass. Dean started pulling Cas' panties down with his teeth until they got stuck around his legs. The alpha proceeded to rip the underwear off with little effort.
"I love you," Cas stated, caressing Dean's cheek.
"Hey, Sammy," Dean chimed in, making the younger brother jump with surprise.
The alpha was not going to take advantage of Cas while he's desperate and heartbroken. No matter how many times Dean thought about it. Cas was 18. His brother's best friend. A kid Dean saw growing up.
Cas sat up, looking up at the alpha. "I'm just happy."
Dean stood up, carrying Cas towards their room. The alpha lowered Cas onto the bed softly before he undressed to his boxer briefs and went to lay next to his fiance. Cas cuddled up next to Dean, putting his head on the Winchester's warm chest while Dean pulled the comforter on top of them. It didn't take long for both of them to drift off to sleep now that they were back together after a painful, sleepless night apart.
"I'm in the kitchen," Cas called out, bouncing slightly with Claire in his arms.
"DEAN!" Cas yelled.
Dean pulled away. "Hey, baby. You ready for our date?"
"Maybe we should do that," Cas agreed.
"What the fuck do you want?" Gabriel growled.
"I'm fine. Just thinking," Cas answered.
Dean sent a quick 'I love you' back before going back to the auto shop with his father and uncle.
Cas pulled off of his husband looking at the door. "She asked if everything is okay in here."
Castiel changed into an old shirt Inias left him and a pair of pajama pants before laying back into bed.
"Okay," Claire agreed happily.
Cas ran out of the bedroom to see what was going on. Once he turned the hallway light on, he saw who was standing there.
The Winchester grabbed Cas' hand, pulling him up in one swift motion.
As soon as Cas got in the car, Dean asked how school was.
"We're gonna have a pup." Dean smiled, caressing the omega's soft cheek. "You're gonna have my pup."
"Sister!" Jack exclaimed.
"No!" Dean snapped. "Absolutely not."
"Wait, wait, wait," Dick cried out, his hands up in defense. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
"It's okay, baby," Dean cooed. "I'm right here."
: want 2 talk abt stuff...dinner here 2mrw?
“I’m well, Sam.  How are you?”
“You sure don’t get your looks from mama, though, do you?”  Dean runs a hand down Emma’s hair.  She giggles and bats her eyelashes at him again.  He smiles because she’s flirting again.
“Well?” he asked.  “You’re not usually this quiet.”
“Yeah, I know. It was cute. I would think your Secret Santa is Charlie except she’s sworn on Leia’s bikini that it isn’t her.” Dean was both impressed and surprised to see Cas open his locker to see the cat nurse mug last Friday. Surprised because it was in Cas’ locker and he thought he was the only one with the combination other than Cas and impressed because it was something that Dean had planned on buying Cas after payday. Either Charlie knows the person that picked Cas or that person is just very observant. Dean hopes it is the former.
“Lisa’s son.  He’s about fifteen now, I think.  Ben was seven when Dean and Lisa met.  Dean’s always wanted a family and this one was ready made for him.” Of course, Dean wanted a family.  Dean wanted the one thing Cas wasn’t physically able to give him.  Maybe he should just step aside and let Lisa have Dean back.  She seemed like she was still interested in him after all these years.  Dean was older now, and ready to retire.  Maybe he would be happy with his ready-made family back.  As much as it hurt to admit, Cas was questioning his commitment to a relationship as well as Dean’s desire to stay with him.
Dean and Eileen are in the kitchen trading recipes, leaving Cas and Sam to sip expensive bourbon in front of the fireplace.  Spending time with Sam and Eileen is always relaxing for Cas.  He always tries to take extra days off during the Thanksgiving holiday since he doesn’t really take time for himself at any other time of year.  This year he’s tried to keep his vacation stress-free, but it has been difficult considering the party is less than one month away and there is still so much to be finished before then.
“Heyyyy, Cas,” Dean drawled.  “Sam, have you met Cas?” Castiel stared at Dean with his head tilted a little to the side.  Was Dean drunk?  It didn’t appear that he’d had anything more than a few beers tonight.  Sam laughed.
“Oh, no that’s…” Castiel’s eyes are wide and he looks somewhat startled and chagrined at the assumption.  Castiel clears his throat and tries again.  “She doesn’t have a father.”  Dean raises his eyebrow at this.  He’s pretty sure he remembers that part in sex ed about how babies are made.  He’s sure this isn’t what Castiel meant so he waits.  He could stand here all day talking to the striking yet shy omega and his adorably charming daughter.
Dean had mentioned that day about wanting to retire from the rodeo but didn’t know how he would help Sam pay for the ranch without the income.  Cas was surprised to hear that Dean had been considering retirement and wondered if it meant Dean sticking around in Blue Falls or if he would have to find somewhere else to settle down.  He was hopeful that the last three weeks of dating had been good enough that Dean would consider staying so that they could see how their relationship progressed. Cas told Dean at the barbecue that they must get through the rodeo before making any big decisions.  He’d gotten his hopes up before and had them dashed on the rocks of reality when things didn’t turn out as expected.
“We’re – wait, what are you talking about?”
“Yes?” Cas tried not to let his voice break as he responded.
“How did you know, Dean?”  Cas said shyly.
Emma comes running out of the double doors of her preschool clutching a light green piece of paper in one hand, a cookie shaped like a Christmas tree in the other and a giant smile on her face.  Thoughts of Dean fade into the background as he prepares to take his little girl home.
“And who, may I ask, is Ben?”  Yep, way to go Castiel.  Just keep digging at that wound.  He wasn’t sure he wanted to know but if he didn’t get the whole picture now he was afraid he wouldn’t never find out.  It was obvious Dean hadn’t wanted to tell him.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Lisa.” Cas didn’t want to say that Dean hadn’t mentioned that his manager was a woman, but he was tempted.  He was tempted to say many things to this woman who was sitting so close to Dean.  He was tempted to say some things to Dean as well.
Cas stays gone for a few minutes and Dean is starting to think he screwed something up when Cas walks back into the kitchen with a wet washcloth.  The expression on his face is stoic and he’s locked down his scent to something entirely neutral.
Jo turned back to Dean and Cas took that opportunity to escape to the kitchen.  He grabbed a couple plates and took them out to the customers.  A few drinks needed refilling and he stopped to make small talk with Rufus, the surly vet that like to come in on his lunch breaks and give the Roadhouse servers a tough time.  By the time Castiel had return from his rounds, Dean had moved to a booth and Sam had joined him.  He went back to the bar where Jo was filling a couple of pints.
“Will you see if she will sit still long enough for you to wash her face?”  Cas carefully hands the washcloth to Dean without touching him.  “She’s got soup and juice all over her face and maybe it will help her calm down if I’m not ‘attacking her’ at the moment.”  The frustration in Cas’ voice is still evident but Dean knows he has this sappy look on his face when Cas’ eyes soften.  Cas must not have realized he was doing the finger quotes thing again.
*********************
“Is that what you were going to do?”
This scenario is melting Cas’ heart.  Emma and Dean continue to color.  Dean and Cas continue to ask each other questions as Cas finishes his coffee but Dean never stops finding ways to keep Emma involved whether it is handing her another color crayon, flipping the page, or grabbing a new book from the small stack in the middle of the table.  Castiel has always hoped that he would find someone to appreciate both him and his daughter.  He has been on dates in the past where at the first mention of his little girl his date was signaling for the check and hightailing it out of wherever they had been.  It had made Cas reticent to date in the past six months.  Emma gets plenty of time with her uncles if Cas needs to work a weekend shift but he keeps hoping for something that could potentially become permanent.  And truthfully he wouldn’t mind giving Emma a sibling sooner rather than later.
“My daughter…she…she wandered away for a moment.  Please…if she comes back just keep her here.”  Cas leaves the bag of groceries with the store clerk and sprints to the last place they were before coming to the front of the store.
“Yeah, I know.  He doesn’t like to show it.  He thinks it ‘tarnishes his spotless reputation’.”  Dean laughed at Cas’ use of air quotes.  “How much does Sam know?”  Cas quietly asked.
“Nope, just running after the rugrat.  You know how it is.”
“Balthazar, why are we even having a party this year if Anna will not be here to plan it.  Surely we could take one year off from the holiday festivities?” He could hear himself pleading, but the look on Balthazar’s face isn’t changing and the pit in Cas’ stomach is growing as the seconds tick by.
“Just so you know, I’ve never taken anyone to that diner that we went to on our first date.  I’ve never brought anyone to a family barbecue before.  Ask Sammy.  Lisa’s been to Blue Falls before.  She came to meet Sam once when we’d just started living together.  I didn’t take her to that diner.  I didn’t throw a barbecue at Sam’s house when I brought her to town.”  Hope and insecurity flowed through Castiel at Dean’s confession.  Dean looked sincere but his past was trying to convince him that Dean was lying.  “Cas, this whole thing where we date?  I’ve told you that relationships are not my strong suit and I mean it.  Of course I’m afraid of screwing it up.  Who wouldn’t be considering my history?  But this matters – you matter.”  Dean stepped closer and brought his other hand up to Cas’ face, cupping his jaw carefully.  Cas felt cherished by the gesture – something he hadn’t felt in a long, long time.  “I don’t know how it happened so fast, but you matter to me Cas.  Please believe me.”
“I dunno, Sam.  There’s this thing that goes beyond Claire.  And it may lead somewhere and it may not. I don’t think his anger was primarily because I skipped out on playground time with Claire.  That happens on Saturdays when I go to group and he’s fine with it. I think it was more that I went out with my friends from group.”
“Cas, wait, what?  I don’t get it.”
“Since Thanksgiving,” he replies.  “Sam and I had a talk while you were heating up the pie.  That conversation clarified a lot for me and our relationship.  I don’t know what I would have done if you hadn’t been here to help me plan this party, Dean.  And I don’t mean that any friend would have done in this situation. You’ve always supported me in anything I do and I really don’t want to face any of life’s challenges without you.  I think it should be you and I until the end. Don’t you?”
Dean rolls out of bed and shuffles to the kitchenette to start coffee.  Thankfully he remembered to set up the coffeemaker last night before falling into bed.  That was a habit he had gotten into just days into his stay at the Novak Orchard.  It isn’t that he can’t wake up early.  Years in the Army taught him to be a light sleeper and he hasn’t lost that now that he’s finally out.  But he’s not used to the unfamiliar space even if it is just one large room on top of the 3 car garage next to the large Victorian house where his daughter now lives.
“Was that a statement or a question, Cas?” Dean replied.
“Aw shucks, Cas.  You sure know how to make a guy blush.”  Dean says it like a tease, but Cas can see the tips of his ears turn pink and he knows that his neck and chest are probably starting to flush as well.
“Well, now, that’s where you’d be wrong.  He doesn’t really talk about it much because he’s caught flak for it in the past, but he’s attracted to all kinds. Go for it.”  Jo winked at Cas and took the two pints delivering them to Dean and Sam’s table.  Cas remained behind the bar staring at the three of them as Jo said something to make the men laugh.  When Jo returned to the bar she whispered to Cas to close his mouth.  Cas’ jaw snapped shut but his mind wouldn’t stop spinning.
“Dean, please don’t take my hesitance in responding as some sort of negative reaction.  I’m just trying to wrap my head around the fact that you want both me and Emma.”  It is exhilarating and scary at the same time; Cas has never expected that he would find someone this close to perfect.  He’s not ruling out another pinch just to double check that he’s awake and that this is really happening.
“Right, yeah. So, I got my gift and…” Dean tries not to watch Cas too closely but he is very interested in seeing how his friend reacts. He’s been seeing little things for the past few months that make him think he’s going crazy. Cas has never been a touchy-feely type of guy, but all of a sudden he started making sure Dean knew he was there by lightly pressing his fingers or his shoulder into Dean when Dean felt like he needed the support.
“What, uh,” Cas hesitates. “What was your gift?” He’s not fidgeting, really, but Dean sees him drawing circles with his fingertip on the desktop.
It isn’t that Cas doesn’t date, but he usually waits until he’s known the person for more than 15 minutes.  Dean seems to have a way about him that not only charmed Cas in that grocery store but Emma as well.  Dean comes to the table with a tray that includes two coffees, a hot chocolate in a kids travel cup, two ice waters, a cookie and two large muffins.  Dean places the cookie and the hot chocolate in front of Emma and the muffins, water and coffee in front of himself and Cas.
“And how exactly does Sam know how I ended up in Blue Falls?” Cas’ heart sped up a little at hearing this confession from Dean.  He didn’t want anyone to know how he ended up in this little corner of Texas.  He didn’t even want his brother to know but since Cas had needed a place to crash Gabriel had become his only option.
“Emma!”  Dean turns to see someone running up to him arms outstretched towards the girl.  “Mama!” The girl, Emma, cries, her arms reaching out to the man hurrying towards them.  “Oh honey, you had mama so worried!”  Emma practically jumps from his arms and the man, omega by the scent of him, kisses her face and whispers to the girl.
“Her ‘father’ left before she was born.”  How cute, Dean thinks.  Castiel used actual finger quotes.  Could this man get any more adorable than he already was?  Dean would just have to find out.
“Wait, sister?” Cas didn’t realize he had spoken out loud until he saw Dean’s glass pause halfway to his mouth.  Dean and Jo shared a look before Jo turned to Cas and leaned against the bar.
“Whoa, hey,”  Dean says. “It’s okay, Cas.  I’m here.” Dean starts running one hand up and down Cas’ back while cradling the back of his head with the other.  “Breathe for me, babe. It’s all gonna be okay. You wanna tell me what’s got you this wound up? Is it a case?”
“You got your second gift from Secret Santa last Friday, right?”
“I’m sorry, Cas.  Group ran late today.  Jillian needed us to all stick around.”
“All right,” Dean grumbles.  “I don’t like it but I guess I can accept it.  I’ll get started on the party crap this weekend, ‘kay?”  He leaves the door open as he walks back to the kitchen. Cas stays in his home office for another five minutes or so until he feels calm enough to join Dean for dinner.
“Knowing Dean, he’ll kick your ass for it, but it would make for a great story.  You think I could slip in the back if you tell me about what time you plan on popping the question?  I’ll have to come pick up Eileen anyway since she’ll be photographing the party for you.”
Dean gets home late that afternoon after working half a shift at the garage and attending his Saturday afternoon PTSD support group.  He ends up staying late to rally around one of their members that had a bad episode. He was supposed to go with Cas to the park with Claire and feels guilty that he missed it.  He’s been trying to create memories with Claire both for his sake and for hers. Any time that he can’t make one of those activities makes him feel like a bad parent and like he needs to go to confession, even if he’s not Catholic.
Cas is also happy that the brewery agreed with Dean that a white and green theme would be best for the space.  It will be perfect for the pictures that Eileen will be taking later on when Cas gives his speech. Almost absentmindedly, Cas’ hand slips into his jacket pocket for the present he has tucked away for later.
What Dean wants to know is why. If it’s the same reason Dean is trying to figure this out, then he’s got all the reason in the world to feel hopeful.
There’s no stage, but there is a clear area close to the entrance so he walks over and stands quietly until the whole room as quieted down.  As heads begin to turn in his direction, he clears his throat a couple times, now feeling like he won’t be able to get a word out when it’s time to speak.  Cas looks down and then up again, finds Dean’s eyes through the crowd where he stands at the back of the room, and takes a deep breath.
Another of Dean’s fantastic ideas was to have teams at the firm compete for prizes by decorating a tree with different themes.  The winning team gets a paid lunch at the brewery and a donation to a charity of their choice. The trees will all be donated to families in the area that cannot afford to buy and decorate a tree of their own.  If Cas didn’t already know how big Dean’s heart was, that would have been a dead giveaway. As someone who didn’t always have a tree or presents when he was growing up, Dean always tried to go the extra mile during the holidays.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t hear that.  What did you say?”  Cas walks into the dining room to ask. Dean looks at him with confusion, but Cas can tell it’s a little bit of an act.  Maybe he didn’t mean to say it that loud, but it’s too late to take it back.
“Lisa came to town so we could talk about that whole retirement thing.  As my manager she’s the one that knows the most about the contracts I have with my sponsors.  All I do is sign where she tells me to.”  Dean hugged Lisa to him with that confession.  Lisa laid her head on Dean’s shoulder and laughed softly.
“He’s hot, right? I know you noticed earlier.”  Jo’s voice was low and teasing.  She had obviously seen the way Cas blushed earlier and had taken it as interest on his part.
“Hey, Cas.  Yeah, me and Lis here thought we’d get a bite and I could introduce you at the same time.”  Dean looked happy as he nudged the woman next to him.  She smiled politely at Cas.  “Cas, this is my manger, Lisa.  Lis, this is the guy I was telling you about.”
“My name’s Dean and it was no problem…” He pauses like he is waiting for something.  Once again, his brain freezes and Castiel doesn’t quite know what to say.  The alpha knows he is an omega so why isn’t he just using their designation titles?
“Really, Dean, you and Cas need to talk like adults with no threat of children getting in between you.  You may find out that what you want is exactly what he wants. You won’t know until you give it a try, right?
“You know I did, Dean. You were with me when I opened my locker to find it there.”
By the time they are done picking out the fruit snacks and some vegetables for a stir fry the front of the store is empty.  Castiel walks straight up to a checkout counter, places their few items on the belt, picks up Emma from the cart and sets her down next to him as he reaches for his wallet to pay for the small back of groceries.  He reaches back to grab her hand but she isn’t there.  Cas turns, sure that she has just moved a little out of reach but she is gone.
Cas’s head is spinning and he doesn’t quite know how to process the events of the last few minutes.  “Your mama can come too if he wants.  They’ve got fabulous coffee and the finest pie in town.”  Dean is holding out his hand towards Cas.  This is it.  An opportunity to see where this goes with the alpha who is already half in love with his daughter and may grow to be half in love with her father too.  Castiel lifts a corner of his mouth into a smile and reaches for Dean’s hand.
“Yeah, I guess that’s true.” Dean feels momentarily deflated, but he’s not going to let it get to him. He’s pretty sure that Cas is his Secret Santa and if that’s the case, then he’s going to surprise Cas when he gets his last gift if it kills him.
It isn’t until Saturday afternoon that Emma remembers her project and she loudly tells Dean about the letter she is supposed to write to Santa Claus and take to school on Monday.  Cas has gone out to run errands without Emma because taking Emma always adds at least an hour to any time he budgets for getting things done. Dean is always happy to stay at Cas’ with her.  They are at the kitchen table with a couple of Christmas themed coloring books and a tub full of crayons when she brings it up.
Cas is mortified that his daughter has called Dean ‘papa’.  He can’t tell if she is being deliberately cheeky to get something that she wants but it is a little unsettling.  She has never warmed up to an alpha like this before and it seems like Emma has done nothing but embarrass him on this date.  “Honey, Mr. Dean isn’t ‘papa’.  And mama already said no.”  Cas removes the cup from Emma’s little hands and sets it to the side of the table.  Emma pouts but Cas isn’t ready to give in.  Maybe if she is good for a little while he’ll get her a bottle of juice before they go.  Instead he pulls out a few of her favorite coloring books and her little box of crayons from his bag.  Dean’s eyes light up when he sees the coloring books come out.  Emma must scent his excitement because she climbs right out of her booster seat and into Dean’s lap.  Dean chuckles as he rearranges the little girl so that she has plenty of room to spread out.  Emma hands him an orange crayon and he gets to work coloring an underwater scene of Aquaman.  Emma is attacking some seaweed with a purple crayon.  Dean is murmuring to Emma about the “right” color to use.  Emma huffs and tells Dean to “use his ma-gi-na-tin.”
In some ways growing up with a big family was nice but in other ways Castiel couldn’t wait to get out of the house.  His family hadn’t kept him from having a social life in high school, but he wasn’t the most popular kid.  He had friends and dated but still felt like he struggled when it came to social interaction.  College was a revelation to him.  Suddenly he found himself with no adult supervision (“It was liberating and a little scary to find out that I was the adult,” he tells Dean as they continue to learn more about each other.) and he went a little wild.
He should feel blessed that his daughter was placed in such nice circumstances.  Foster kids aren’t always this lucky.  The Novak Orchard is over 100 acres of mostly fruit trees but it also seems to be a haven for not only his baby girl but for other foster kids that are continually cycling in and out of the place as well.  He’d been worried when he talked to the DHS case worker about Claire’s placement.  How could she get attention if she was one of many?  What if she needed special care and the foster parents were too busy dealing with other kids that her issues fell through the cracks?  It took about 15 minutes of being on site for Dean to realize that while he didn’t yet trust Cas Novak entirely, he did trust his daughter in Cas’ care.  And at least Cas wasn’t alone.  His sister lived at the orchard and helped care for the children.  It wasn’t the normal foster set up.  But Dean would now agree that it works.
“Hello,” she says.  Dean opens his mouth but nothing comes out.  This girl can’t be any older than four but here she is standing next to an unknown alpha looking like she wants to be his friend.
They also stop by the butcher counter.  Another must see in any grocery store for the 4 year old is the lobster tank.  Emma was captivated by the “ugly fish” the first time he brought her to see the lobster tank.  Now she begs Castiel to “take her to the fish so she can set them free” any time they go to a store with a tank.  She has yet to accomplish their freedom, but she does enjoy talking to them and it makes Cas smile to see her engaging with the world around her.
Dean rubs his eyes and grabs his phone from the nightstand.  Waking up the screen, he remembers why he is doing all of this.  Claire’s sunny smile shines back at him.  His daughter.  The one he didn’t even know about until about 6 months ago.  His daughter who looks nothing like him but sure acts like a miniature version of him even though she’s only 3 years old.  His daughter who lost her mother to a drunk driver at a too young age.  Dean knows this from experience.  So he’s resolved to give Claire everything he can because every child deserves to grow up happy and healthy.  There’s a lot he’s discovered in the past half year that he would do for this little girl.  And he guesses that getting up early is just one of them.
“Thanks, darlin’.  So are yours.”  She responds with the biggest smile her little face can wear.  Her eyes are pretty, he thinks.  Light cornflower blue with long strawberry blonde eyelashes, her eyes slowly blink at him like she’s trying to flirt.  Dean briefly wonders where she learned that move because it’s working.  He’s falling a little in love with the girl and he’s only known her for about two minutes.  “Where’s your mama, sweetheart?”
Cas is quiet for a while, contemplating what Sam has said.  He and Sam talk for a little bit longer about work.  Sam shares with Cas his day-to-day and suggests that it may be worth it for he and Cas to consider opening a practice together if the gig with his current firm doesn’t work out.  Cas asks Sam if he thinks they could make a decent go of it, maybe enough to support Dean if he and Cas decide to get married and start a family?
Of course, Cas hadn’t really shown that he was all that trusting off the bat.  It isn’t like Dean abandoned his daughter or her mother.  He hadn’t even known about Claire until her mother, a one night stand for Dean during a rare trip stateside during which he thought he and the woman had been safe (maybe it wasn’t the best idea to use a condom that hadn’t seen the light of day in years, but Dean hadn’t been thinking with his upstairs brain!), had died in a car accident and her will revealed that Dean was the father.  She hadn’t known Dean’s last name, but knew he was in the service which is how DHS was able to track him down.  She’d had a life insurance policy that would take care of Claire for the rest of her life but had somehow depended on Dean to be the trustee of that money.
“She’s a talker.  She doesn’t get that from you either, I bet.  Is her dad a schmoozer?”  And here it is.  The moment when everything starts to go south.  Cas realizes that in the few moments that he’s stood here with Emma and Dean that his scent has been waffling between hesitantly interested and cautiously wary.  But one thing Dean probably has scented is that Cas is unmated.  Well, this can only go two ways really and he hopes Dean does not devolve into caveman status when he finds out that he is raising his daughter alone.
“It’s hit the ball outta the park, Cas,”  Dean says with a laugh. He shakes his head and wanders off to check on some other aspect of the party.  Cas watches him go with a smile. He knows the phrase but always chooses to mess it up because he loves hearing Dean laugh.
“Dean, you…I mean…why…”  Cas doesn’t quite know how to put into words what he is feeling.  On one hand he feels like he’s known Dean far longer than just one afternoon.  They already seem to fit together well and Emma, the little traitor, already treats him like another parent.  On the other, it has been just one afternoon.  Is he moving too fast?  Is Dean moving too fast?  Will Dean regret taking on not only Cas but his daughter as well?  Cas takes a deep breath and closes his eyes while he tries to quiet his mind.  He’s really never been the type to jump right into things, but all internal signs are pointing towards accepting the alpha sitting next to him and he thinks this might be a great time to start trusting his gut.
“Hey, you wanna turn and look at me for a minute?” Dean sees Cas take a deep breath, remove his glasses and rub his eyes for a moment before turning and giving Dean his full attention.
“Pfft, everyone here already knows who you are.  You’re the local celebrity, remember?”  She pulled back and wiggled.  Dean put her gently on the ground and returned her hug.
As this starts to make him feel a little uncomfortable, he quickly turns and walks back to the steps up to the apartment.  Of course, the fact that he is barefoot makes it difficult to do this quickly and he’s sure that his blush has now spread to his neck and upper shoulders.  But he’s not going to look back at Cas.  He’s not.  He feels Cas’ eyes on him all the way up the steps.  Dean slams the door and leans back on it and takes a deep breath.
Castiel didn’t know if a family barbecue qualified as an official date, but he couldn’t deny the fact that Dean looked good standing next to the grill talking with his brother, Sam, and flipping the burger patties.  It was a gorgeous summer day in Blue Falls, Texas.  The Winchester brothers had felt like hosting a barbecue before the rodeo crowd descended on the town and had invited their entire extended family to the ranch for the occasion.  Cas could hardly believe the last three weeks were real and that he was standing in Sam Winchester’s backyard with family and friends surrounding him.  If someone had told him a month ago that he would be dating one of the US Rodeo Circuit’s most eligible bachelors, he would have laughed in their face.
Dean’s heart gives a few painful thumps as he realizes how domestic this day has become.  He knew that he would be helping Cas with Emma when he came over and he brought the food in order to make sure they both had something to eat, but prior Saturdays at Cas’ house always felt like play dates or date nights.  This feels different.  This feels like caring for his pack.
, he thinks.
“Your car was in the parking lot at the Roadhouse, Dean.  Thankfully Claire didn’t see it or she might have put up a fuss.  Instead we came home and I explained to Claire that you must still be having some “alone” time.  It’s hard to explain to a child what that means. I know you know that. But her life right now is based on routine and for you to take “alone” time during the day instead of after she goes to bed confuses her.”
“C’mon Cas, you’re a smart guy, right?” Dean continues.  “I hope you’ve figured out that I don’t want anything from you that you aren’t willing to give.  I’m not the kind of alpha that thinks you should stay home and raise a family unless that is what you want.  Heck, I would love the opportunity to cut back some hours at work in order to split time at home if it should ever come to that.”  The earnestness in his expression is quietly destroying any red flags Cas has set up for himself.
, Dean thinks fondly. Cas’ glasses are sliding down his nose and he’s run his hands through his hair so often that it’s practically standing up on end.
“I thought it was you that swore on Leia’s bikini, not Charlie.” Cas says with a smirk. Dean tries not to blush because he told Cas in confidence that he wouldn’t balk at wearing the Leia costume as long as it was only Cas and a few others that saw him in it. He wouldn’t be stupid enough to wear it to a party or out in public.
“Not as much as Gabriel does, that’s for sure.  Gabe clamed up once he realized he’d been spilling the beans.  Sam told me it was a bad break up and that the cops had to get involved but that is really all he knows.  So that’s all I know.”  Cas hummed but didn’t say anything.  Truthfully, he didn’t like to think about the events that had driven him to Blue Falls.  He’d been in Texas for almost 7 months.  The nightmares surrounding the events that led him to Blue Falls had almost disappeared.  His hesitation must have shown in his face because Dean pulled him closer.
“You mean less for me to decorate,” Dean whispers under his breath.  Cas tries not to hear it, but Dean says it just loud enough that Cas can’t ignore it.
“You are a charmer, sweetheart.  You must get that from your mama.”
“Dean,” Cas says solemnly, reaching into his pocket and then lowering himself to one knee.  Dean chokes a little once he understands what’s happening. “You are my rock, my foundation, and everything that I need in order to sail safely through the storm that is our lives together.  Would you do me the immense honor of making me the happiest man alive and agreeing to become my husband?” Cas removes the ring from the box, a gorgeous platinum ring with a band of lapis lazuli running through the middle.  He holds it up to Dean, who nods vigorously and grabs for the ring.
"He's so cute," Cas commented, coming to stand by Dean.
"He'll be fine. He's in good hands here," she reassured Dean. "I need you to fill out some paperwork."
"So, why were you at my dorm?" Charlie asked, piling a forkful of spaghetti in her mouth.
Dean grabbed some antiseptic to clean the wound out, causing Cas to hiss in pain.
Dean helped Cas back up and went to the living room where their dinner was still sitting.
"Why are you here?" Sam walked over with Eileen.
Cas helped Dean to their bedroom. Before Cas knew it, Dean fell face first onto the bed, taking up the whole bed. Cas groaned, deciding to try and undress the drunk alpha. He started to take off his boyfriend's boots and pulled off his leather jacket.
"It's fine. I'll be okay."
His euphoria didn't last long when he realized Cas would be going out with another alpha in a couple of days. He groaned, covering his face with his hands. Why does he have to feel this way?
"Hey," Dean greeted trying not to sound rude.
"Will we really be sleeping on the ground? On the dirt?"
Cas smiled. "Thank you."
"Goodnight, baby. I love you too," Dean replied, giving Cas another kiss.
"Your family doesn't know?" Dean pulled away to face the omega. "Is that why you're here?"
"I was just thinking. Plus, we went to sleep early, so I wasn't tired enough to go back to bed," Dean replied.
Samandriel got up and hugged Cas. "Hey, Cas."
Cas gasped, holding his stomach. "Dean! I felt the pup move!"
"That was amazing," the omega said, still breathing heavily. He looked up at Dean, kissing him, tasting himself on the alpha's lips.
Cas stifled a moan when Dean kissed his mating gland. "I want to go further tonight."
"He's gonna skate with us, okay?" Cas told Claire, kneeling down in front of here. "We might need to teach him how to skate."
"I....I don't....I'm....," Dean stuttered.
"I like making you blush," Dean chuckled.
"I feel like there's something between us," Dean said looking down in-between them.
"I'm sure you made quite the impression on him. I really don't think he'll try anything. He only tried it the first time because he didn't know about you. He doesn't seem like the type of alpha to be pushy," Cas defended.
"Welcome, family and friends," the alpha pastor started. "I'm glad everyone is here to witness the union of Castiel Novak and Dean Winchester. Today, they will take their next step in life. They will be bonded for the rest of their lives.
A moan rumbled in the alpha's throat, pushing into Cas' hand. The young omega pulled the alpha out of his underwear, his mouth watering at the sight of the towering cock in front of him.
"We have time. We're still young," Cas answered.
"Oo, a bag," Cas stated.
The omega was about to grab another present that was in a medium sized box, but Dean quickly stopped him.
"Do you have anything to wear for the investor's meeting?" John asked Dean.
"Oh, come on, baby. One drink won't hurt," the voice pressed on.
Cas was speechless. "I... I don't know what to say. Thank you so much. This is an amazing gift, but Dean is afraid of flying."
Cas snorted. "Well, yeah, but they don't need to see your possessive markings on me."
"Dean, where are you?" Sam asked on the other end of the phone.
Dean may be the dominant one in the relationship, but once Cas called him daddy, the alpha was putty in the omega's hands.
"You know you love it," Cas teased, leaning up to kiss him.
"Hey, what's going on?" Dean asked, walking over from the living room.
Dean sat back down, unable to think of a response. How could Lisa keep this from him? He could have visited to spend time with his son.
Dean raised his eyebrow at the way Cas reacted. A low growl came from the alpha's throat.
Sam side-eyed Dean knowingly. "Yeah. We found out a couple of weeks ago."
"Your roommate is an alpha!" Gabriel exclaimed. "You can't live with an alpha. What if he does something? All those college guys are drunk knotheads."
"Can I at least open one?" Cas whined, looking back at Dean.
The omega nodded, hugging Dean. "Why is she texting you?"
The French alpha's eyes lingered on Cas, looking him up and down before walking away. Cas swirled the wine in the glass and took a sip.
Dean wrapped his arm around Cas' shoulders, kissing his temple. "Eat your food, baby."
"You're such a fucking moron," Cas thought to himself. "What the hell is the matter with you?"
Cas sat on the couch with Claire sitting on the floor in front of him. He was combing his daughter's hair after taking a bath. They ended up watching a Christmas movie in Gabriel's living room. The couple in the movie just had their first kiss since moving to different towns. The omega on the tv smiled lovingly at his old flame.
"Look, I know you and him were serious, but he's gone. Start dating again," Charlie pressed on.
"We have about 4 months left till we meet them," Cas said excitedly.
Dean's cheeks heated up. He rubbed the back of his neck, looking away. "I was gonna get some dinner. Did you want to come with me?"
Dean nodded. "Maybe it was kind of a blessing we're quarantined. We finally get to spend time with our kids and relax after working so much."
"Hey, Dean-o," Gabriel greeted first. "We know it's early, but we wanted to drop off all of the baby shower gifts you guys got. There's more in the truck."
"You bitch!" Cas yelled, struggling against Dean's hold on him.
"I love you too," the Winchester stated, kissing his boyfriend softly.
The five year old was looking through every nook and cranny she could find while Jack double checked her work. The three of them searched high and low.
"Good. Now go away, fag," Victor said, loud enough that the kids near by heard him.
"Come on, omega. I know you still have feelings for me. Just admit it. We were pretty hot for each other when we were dating," Dick said, pushing closer to Cas.
Cas chuckled and got up to slide in the booth, sitting next to Dean. He kissed the alpha's cheek, smiling at him.
"It doesn't matter, Dean. I'm just happy we're having date night," Cas replied.
"Yuh nphh to goff unghrss," Dean mumbled into the bed, not making any sense.
"Yes, we did," Cas answered, kneeling next to Claire. "Hey, honeybee. Did you have fun with your uncles?"
A growl rumbled out of Dean as he captured Cas' lips in a tender kiss. Cas automatically kissed back, opening his mouth to let Dean in. Dean hovered over the omega, starting to pull down the straps of his lingerie to help him out of it. Dean pulled away quickly, Cas chasing his lips.
"Baby, what's wrong? Is it the pup? Are you okay?" Dean questioned, sitting next to Cas, wiping his tears.
When Dean added another finger, Cas started pushing back of the alpha's fingers, wanting more. Cas pushed his hand away before grabbing Dean's cock from behind and slowly sitting on the hard length.
"First, I want to get this out of the way before I start my speech. Dean," Gabriel paused, turning to face his new brother-in-law. "I'm glad you're part of our family. And I've grown to like you, even though you're screwing my little brother daily."
Cas got up from the couch to get a beer from the fridge and walked over to the pup's room. Dean put down the paint roller, wiping his forehead of sweat with the back of his hand, smearing a bit of mint green paint on himself.
Sunday Evening
"How long have you known Charlie?" Dean asked as he held the door of the cafeteria open for Cas.
Cas rolled his eyes, smiling. "Yeah, maybe."
"I love you too, babe," Dean responded.
The alpha waved and left, not bothering to say goodbye to Lisa.
The omega nodded, rubbing his eyes. Dean gave him a kiss on the forehead, rubbing his back.
Cas smiled, kissing Dean's cheek. "I'll always love you too. You know, until you start going gray. Then I'll have to trade you in for a younger model."
The alpha began to work Cas open with his tongue and fingers, making sure not to rush and hurt him. To ease any pain, Dean would alternate between lapping at Cas' hole, sucking his cock, or kissing his inner thighs.
"Well, they didn't keep their deal very well, did they? They still hurt Dean." I gape at Sammy, he was usually so quiet.
He smiles shyly and shuffles his foot on the floor, I can tell he's nervous. I know how he feels, I'm feeling it as well. I take a breath and try to look at the other boy, avoiding his glowing soul and looking at his face.
"I'm from all around really, my dad travels a lot for work." He replies abruptly and frowns a little. We walk in silence the rest of the way to class and we go to head into homeroom when he spins around and stops. I run into his chest, hitting my forehead on his teeth.
"Hmmm, Angelina Jolie and Thomas Brodie-Sangster." He whistles quietly.
I could get used to living here.
When my next breath releases it shudders and my eyes widen in shock before a sob escapes my throat. I slap my hands over my mouth in surprise when another sob breaks through and tears stream down my face. I'd never had anyone other than Sam care about me, and Sam had stopped crying when I was hurt long ago.
"He's only agreeing cause he wants to impress his girlfriend." Claire taunts and I see why Dean groaned. She was in a skintight black dress and high heels, she looked gorgeous, but she would attract a lot of attention.
"Hold on, why would you fail?" I ask curiously. He rubs the back of his neck and blushes.
That being said it was almost impossible to move away from Cas after that, even though my face hurt from the hard contact of his lips. We stared into each other's eyes and his hair was sticking up in every direction, his cheeks bright red. I pull back slowly and glance at Sammy who's grinning from ear to ear.
We sit down around the table and Cas kisses me before we start eating. Man am I good, this tastes awesome. I hear a moan from Cas and Sammy and I start grinning.
Sam's eyes light up and he snatches a plate before sitting down opposite my dad and calmly eating his meal. After the first bite his eyes widen and he gives my dad a wary thumbs up, his posture stiff. My dad slowly grins and looks at me with triumph, but his grin slips when he spots someone behind me. Dad slowly gets up and makes his way over to the person behind me.
"I was torn between taking you back to the forest where we had our first official date or making it a surprise. I decided to mix the two." At this, he opens the basket and pulls out a full meal. I cover my mouth with my hand and my heart swells, he did this for me.
$20,457.68
I do the only thing I know.
I felt a small tap on my shoulder and snapped out of my thoughts, instead focusing on Sams' face. He smiles slightly and offers his hand, I take it and he pulls me up and into a fierce hug, whispering into my ear
I pull out the ingredients for pancakes and notice our depleted stock of food that consisted of milk, butter and half a can of beer. I make a mental checklist of the things I need to do today.
"Uhh, no. You?" He waggles his eyebrows and I reply with a grin.
"I can't help falling in love, Cas. With you." I smile softly and kiss his nose.
"Your daddy still thinks you're a failure? Well, he's right."
The last thing I see is my dad leaving my side and picking Dean up.
"Hey, Cas." He whispers.
When we get there I head straight towards Dean's room and immediently climb into bed next to him, ignoring the fact that him and Sam were sleeping. He subconciously wraps an arm around me and I fall asleep to his steady breathing.
"Care to tell me now, boy? Don't give me that 'I'm fine' crap, cause I know your not. Now spill, we have no other cars today." I sigh and look down at my hands before mumbling under my breath.
I chuckle while trying to ignore the pain in my torso and squeeze his hand, rubbing soothing circles into the back of it. My heart flutters at the contact and I take a deep breath in, tensing as pain lanced through my ribs. Tears start to fall from Cas' eyelashes and I automatically sit up to wipe them away. I quietly comfort him and open my arms, one hug couldn't hurt anyone.
I grab both sides of his face and crash my lips into his. For a second he doesn't do anything, then his arms are wrapping around me and his kissing back with a passion. It feels like fireworks and dizziness, it feels like nerves and fire. It feels perfectly right. My heart thumps and my stomach tightens, I move my hands to the back of his head and curl them through his hair. He rubs a thumb along the line of skin between my shirt and jeans and goosebumps follow his every touch.
"Alright Clarence, everything seems to be in order. You have three broken ribs, a twisted ankle and a minor concussion, take some pain meds, grab some some crutches, and you'll be good to go." She smiles kindly at me, her brown hair falling in front of her face. Her phone beeps and she pulls a message out, frowning at something on the screen.
"Oh, Cas. We need a medic ASAP! What hurts, why were you screaming? Was it these kids?" He frantically asks and I nod, watching his face contort in anger and he talks to the police standing at the door. I watch the medics run in and I whimper when they move me to put me on a stretcher.
"Are you a virgin?" Dean chokes on his drink and begins laughing hysterically, I join in not long after and he tries to answer through fits of laughter.
"What hurts, De? Mr Novak bought some pain medication over for us so you have to take some." I ruffle his hair and wonder how he was so amazing. He was kind, selfless, happy and serene all the time. I was lucky and incredibly proud to call him my brother.
He was shivering and grimacing, his face covered in blood. Sam must have been in too much pain to clean him up.
And he smiles because it was a life well lived.
I allow myself one minute of emotion, just one, before Chuck comes back. I lightly touch my ribs and find comfort when I don't need to pull back, I had heard a crack but I don't think it's too serious. I mentally thank Sammy for not taking me to the hospital, I couldn't have afforded it and then dad would have had to come home.
The next morning we drag our feet downstairs and greet the rest of our group, Dean pours himself a coffee and pulls me in for a hug, kissing my temple softly. We hear a coo from the doorway and smile when Charlie walks in.
A year, he had only lasted a year longer than Dean.
I bite my lip, debating and I decide that I should probably tell someone who won't make a big deal out of it. I close my eyes and take a deep breath, preparing to tell him what really happened a year ago.
The wiry boy in front of me smiles and replies "Castiel Novak" I'm throw off by his voice, which is, woah. Like super deep.
I pull into the motel and when I walk inside there are already people in there.
How could I make it go away if I didn't know what was causing it?
"Dad's coming home tomorrow morning, and he's visiting the hospital." I close my eyes and mentally pull myself together, opening them again I beckon Sammy towards me.
"It's okay, it's gone. It's over, Dean, alright? I'm here, just breathe." I look into his eyes and try to lose myself in them, wanting to spend forever with him and just forget everything.
"Nope." We both just start laughing again.
"You two are too cute! It's not fair. Hey, has anyone seen Ash?" Just then Ash stumbles into the kitchen with his mullet sticking up in every direction. He salutes us before downing a cup of straight coffee.
He smiles gratefully, his breathing starting to even and I kneel in front of him. He lowers his eyes and I grab his chin, pulling his face up so he looks me in the eyes. I almost cry at the pain reflecting in his eyes but instead, I kiss him gently.
We sit down in desks made for only two people and the jocks sit around us again, Mr Cain puts on a history movie and the room darkens. I hear the whispered insults begin again and my patience boils thin until something warm slips its way into my hand.
* * * *
I tidy my hair and straighten my clothes before I walk in the front door and head to one of the waitstaff. She was a petite thing, with wavy blonde hair and a cute smile. I grin at her and ask if there were any job openings. Same deal as every place I would be visiting today, I had to get as many jobs as I could to pay for Sammy, without him knowing of course. The girl smiles and runs off the get the manager, she soon returns with an older brunette.
I walk up behind Dean and hug him softly, he turns around and smiles when I kiss him. He leans back onto the trunk of the willow and I pull back from the kiss, resting my forehead on his.
"This is beautiful, Dean. Thank you." I grin at him, keeping my voice hushed as if speaking any louder would ruin the moment.
"You love chick-flicks," I whisper.
"Tonight, pick me up at six and you can drive us to your surprise date." He just laughs and pokes my nose.
I glance up a Dean shocked and he just grins at me before giving my hand a gentle squeeze. I bite my lip and squeeze back as we turn to watch the movie. The entire time I can feel the heat rise to my cheeks and it almost completely distracts me from the words being hurled at us.
Four hours later I was still shocked, so was my silent family as we watched movies in the lounge room.
