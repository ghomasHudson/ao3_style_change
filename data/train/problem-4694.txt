The next day, he was greeted by the light, streaming in through his window. He sighed, just another day. He was already late, as he pulled the thick covers off his bed, wincing as he did so. The bruises to his ribs making themselves known, the sharp pain inside him greeting him like an old friend. He imagined he was a warrior, with battle wounds. Maybe that wasn’t so far from the truth. He imagined that today, he would fight and win. Yeah, maybe that was going too far.
. Dean looked at him, and yeah he looked pissed. Cas swallowed, he waited for the inevitable fist; but wait, how had this even happened? And why did his head hurt so damn much? Dean saw the other man wince, like he was expecting to get hit. And his anger dissipated.
And then he heard his father’s footsteps. He could tell immediately what sort of mood he was in, panic gripped his chest in a vice;
And he was pushing into him more forcefully again and again, fucking him into the mattress, their bodies slapping together, the bed’s headboard violently hitting the wall. And he could feel the tsunami-like build up inside him and then he was cumming, violent hot spurts inside his son. And then he was kissing his son’s shoulders, his back, turning him over, his lips, his chest, saying over and over
Castiel felt confused, embarrassed, redundant. Of course, why would someone like Dean want to touch dirt like him? But then, it had seemed like Dean was flirting with him. At one point, he could have sworn Dean brushed his hand over his thigh.
By the time his father walked through the door, it was late. The casserole he had made was still warming in the oven. The house spotless and smelling strongly of bleach. Castiel hadn’t eaten yet, would only eat when his father gave him permission. He was upstairs in his room, lying on his bed, exhausted and staring at the ceiling. Even when his father wasn’t there, he never played music or watched TV. It was like the house didn’t allow him to make noise; it felt wrong to break the tension that this house seemed to breed. He thought again about Dean, the kiss. So gentle. He had never been kissed like that. His experience was that of stolen, brutal kisses or kisses given to keep peace, to keep him safe. He touched his lips. He wanted to feel that kiss again. But Dean had pushed him away, hadn’t wanted him. It should be a relief, it would be bad enough if his father found out that he had been in the same house as Dean, let alone that he shared with a kiss with him. God, Castiel did not want to think about the punishment that his father would give him for that. He just hoped no one had seen anything. He knew how people in the community gossiped. Just thinking about this possibility made Castiel's chest tighten. But then there was also a part of him that was desperately disappointed that Dean hadn't wanted to continue the kiss. Perhaps he found Castiel disgusting or dirty? Castiel sighed. That was probably it. Besides it was stupid, there was no room in his life for anyone but his father. He was surprised at himself for not feeling more guilty that he had basically cheated on his father......god he hoped his father didn't find out. And so his thoughts went around and around like a washing machine on a speed cycle.
After Dean had gone, Castiel crawled back up onto the bed and breathed in the pillows. They smelt of Dean. He couldn’t believe he was in Dean’s bedroom, in Dean’s bed. He momentarily wondered if Dean did anything to him while he was passed out last night. But then he knew the answer to that, Dean didn’t seem to want him in that way, even when he offered himself on a plate. God, he was desperate. Just like his father said. Castiel thought back to his father, lying on the hospital bed. He had to be ok. He just had to be. Because although his father terrified him, life without him surely terrified him even more.
Dean grimaced and sat down gingerly at the breakfast bar, the smell of bacon and eggs that Bobby was cooking, turning his stomach.
An awkward silence. Castiel couldn't quite believe that he had been so insolent. He looked around, desperately trying to think of something to say before coming up with....
Castiel felt his skin crawl; just wanted to get away, to get away from all these men that just wanted to fuck him, use him, destroy him.
Dean took a swig of beer (yeah it was 2pm, but that was practically the evening, ok?), he was staring at some photos from his latest PI case. Husband X (lets call him, Gerald) entering a “certain type of establishment” (i.e. a brothel). Gerald leaving 1 hour later, smile on his face. Jees, what a sleeze! Dean had had his fair share of women, but never gone as far as paying for it (ok there was this one time, but that was completely different...). He guessed Gerald’s wife (lets call her Tamara), would be happy, this would certainly help her divorce settlement (prenup violated, so she gets half). Dean sighed, this was not the reason he had got into the private investigation business (hmmm although maybe helping rick people screw each other wasn’t that bad). Shit, he looked at the time, he was gonna be late. Taking a last swig of his beer, he grabbed his car keys (drinking made his driving better) and headed out.
And Dean hadn’t wanted to fight. Had been so full of apologises and gratitude that Castiel felt embarrassed, hadn’t known where to look, had felt himself blushing profusely. Dean’s aggression and disgust toward him eagerly forgotten; he was just so relieved that nothing would get back to his father; that Dean wasn’t mad at him. And much to his surprise, Dean had invited him to go and get a coffee and pie with him. And even more surprising he had agreed to forego the lecture and go with him. As he followed the taller man out of the corridor, he could barely believe that Dean actually seemed to want to spend time with him. A bubble of excitement rose in his stomach. Sure Castiel didn’t know Dean well, but there was just something about him; he just felt drawn to him. But then there was his father. He felt confused and guilty at thoughts of his father; why would he need anyone else, when his father loved him so much?
He stepped out into the cool night air. Alone at last, on the street outside the gallery. He looked up at the stars.
. Silence. Dean was now getting really irritated. This stupid guy best not waste his time and just let him in.
Dean was escorted through the hall and through a set of doors, into another room, and then another; each room as white and clean and bland as the one before. And then he was led through some French doors onto a patio, where he was then presented with the garden. Dean let out another whistle. It was huge.
Castiel whispered, knowing that’s what he wanted to hear. His father pounding inside him, hitting his sweet spot. Castiel gasped, his traitor cock, hard now, jammed between their bodies and leaking precum.
his father collapsed on top of him. He stayed inside, could feel his father’s cock softening, but still maintaining its grip. Finally, Zachariah released him, and lay panting on him, before rolling over. Castiel lay, afraid to move away, gently wiping the tears he did not know had fallen. Could feel the cum and blood dripping down his legs. He was disgusting, dirty, worthless. His father rolled back over, pulling him close, spooning. Castiel’s body complied.
He pulled out slightly, gripping onto his son’s hips and then pushed himself further, starting to set up a rhythm. His body pressed over Castiel, his son taking all his weight. He pushed Castiel’s head into the pillow, stifling his cries and then he was digging his nails into Castiel’s back, drawing blood. And he felt himself going over the edge then, losing it, saw his boy crushed, could hear him calling his name, his muffled and strained;
And then of course, that happened. Dean leaning over him. And he was breathing Dean in, a faint smell of leather, tinge of whiskey, oil, the outdoors, masculinity. Castiel felt terrified and excited all that same time. And then Dean pulled away, and Zachariah was standing there, with that smile, that smile that didn’t reach his eyes. And then Castiel was just terrified.
He pushed at Dick again, who was momentarily taken off guard by Castiel’s outburst. And then Castiel took off, running as fast as he could, away from Dick, away from his father, away from them all.
The remaining coffee was cold and the pie long ago eaten; the date or whatever it was, was coming to an end.
Bobby Singer shouted up the stairs. Sam grinned into his cereal, Dean was definitely not a morning person.
The nurse who inspected his head was gentle, said he needed some stitches but that he would be fine. And yes, temporary memory loss was normal. And no, he didn’t need to stay in the hospital but yes, it was important that someone kept an eye on him. Dean shifted uncomfortably, not sure how he was going to explain to Mr Novak what had happened. Castiel grabbed up the prescription for painkillers enthusiastically as the nurse departed. Head injury aside, he could only imagine what his father would do to him and he knew he would need all the painkillers he could get.
They walked silently to the car, Castiel still trying to hold back the sobs and Dean wondering what the hell was going on. But no sooner had Dean got himself settled into the car, he found that Cas had swung from weeping damsel in distress to psycho seductress. He literally jumped on him, desperately trying to kiss him and grabbing at, and rubbing Dean’s groin, before he could be stopped. Dean was shocked but not afraid. He struggled and pushed at Cas hard, trying to get away and with one last shove, Cas’ head hit the window with a loud crack and then he was out cold.
.His voice low, barely audible, looking away. Castiel didn’t understand. But of course, he wasn’t good enough for someone as perfect as Dean.
And he wanted to hurt himself, embraced the pain, like an old friend, he deserved the punishment. But in the end it didn’t feel like punishment, felt more like a release. And he admired the way the razor left long bleeding cuts on his arms and legs, so beautiful. And it felt like the pain had ended, felt like euphoria. But it was never really gone. The demon came back, bigger and stronger. And so Castiel had to keep cutting and burning, until his arms and legs were scarred, reminders of the demon that would not die.
He offered no resistance as his father plunged the needle into his arm. He watched as the clear fluid was pushed into his body. And soon he felt lighter and further away; his body was not his own, he could no longer even control his limbs.
The ambulance sped through the town. Sam lay unconscious inside, an oxygen mask attached to his mouth and nose. Castiel sat next to him, trying to keep out of the way of the paramedic. He hadn’t known what to do but Sam had become increasingly unresponsive. So he had decided then that the only option was to call an ambulance. He used Sam’s phone, which he found in his jacket. It was too risky to use his own; Zachariah checked his phone records every month. It felt like a betrayal, he knew Sam could get into a lot of trouble, but the way he was looking, Castiel knew he was already in trouble. Sitting in the back of the ambulance, the paramedic had eyed Castiel suspiciously. He knew he looked terrible. Eyes still pinpricks; pale, sweating and still chewing the inside of his mouth. He looked down at Sam’s phone, he knew he should call Dean. But he was afraid, didn’t know how he was going to tell him. They ambulance arrived at the hospital. The paramedics rushed off with Sam. Castiel took a sharp intake of breath and then he called Dean.
Dean jumped out of the car as Cas all but fell out of the other side of the car. There was nothing for it, he would have to accompany him in to the hospital. It really was going to be a long, long night.
He was still lying on the sun-lounger, when his father came and sat beside him. His father’s friends, Ralph, Urie, and Michael sat silently, watching him.
Sorry, soooo late with this chapter, life got in the way as usual. Will be aiming to write a longer chapter next time (and soon!). Much love x
His father drove him in, the shiny grey BMW glistening in the sun. His father’s hand on his knee, light but a reminder, a reminder of his claim. His aftershave as suffocating as his overbearing presence. Castiel stared out of the window, watching the beautiful houses, all behind their large gates, go past. No people, just beautiful buildings. They lived in “Eden”, a large gated community, (the community tagline: “heaven on earth”). In the community, his father was well-known, might be what could be considered “powerful”, working as a lawyer for a highly reputable company in the city. He knew the “right people” and had strong links with the “Christian Voice” political party and local church. Zachariah Novak was indeed well respected, or perhaps it was more of a case of, well-feared. Castiel was simply known, as the quiet obedient son. He would have possibly even been considered a catch, from a wealthy family and attractive too, with those dark curls, light skin, and crystal-blue eyes that seemed to see into the soul. But well, most girls considered him “kinda weird, or rude, or boring, or whatever”. Not that Castiel minded, he simply wasn’t interested. Anyway his father would never allow him to date, so what was the point? The other brother, no-one could remember his name (possibly Gabriel?) was not discussed in the community, at least not openly. If anyone had an opinion about his whereabouts, it was vague, maybe he gone to find himself in India or maybe he was prison for smuggling drugs, or maybe.......whatever it was, the general consensus was that this brother was simply ungrateful, doing nothing but causing pain to his poor father. He had always been trouble that one. But of course no one mentioned him. Zachariah had made it clear he was to be forgotten. And what of the boys' mother, Zachariah's wife? She had left so long ago, many couldn't remember her at all. Poor Zachariah, it was almost like he was cursed.
He shifted his carcass out of the bed. His father would be home soon. He needed to think. He needed to work out what to do. He took some medicine out of his drawer (hidden in between the pages of the bible, a gift from his mother). He took one pill and then another, dry swallowing. And things felt better. Things were better. Everything was fine.
He walked quickly down the stairs. Truly he didn’t know whether he wanted to find his father or avoid him. Then he heard his father calling his name
After Dean arrived from dropping Castiel off that day, he headed to the shower. He felt sweaty, on edge; needed the cool water to refresh him. Standing under the spray, he thought again of Cas....imagined telling Cas what a rich-ass loser he was, that there was no way in hell that he would want him....imagined Cas’ crushed face, imagined him crying....and then he was wiping away those tears, hugging him, lightly kissing those full lips, touching him everywhere, exploring with his hands and mouth.....Dean felt the blood rushing to cock and reaching down, grasping his hard flesh in a fist, feeling his arousal. He groaned at the pleasure of his touch combined with his thoughts of Cas underneath him, begging for it.....moving his hand faster in a firm rhythm, his breathing erratic as he imagined himself thrusting into Cas’ tight ass; and then saw Cas moving above him, riding his cock,.....oh god, it was ecstasy...could feel the painful tension within him and he was riding the waves. He came in his hand then, shouting Cas’ name as the water poured over him...... the pleasure dissipating before the guilt and disgust edged in......but the image of Castiel straddling him, kissing him, rutting and rubbing himself remained imprinted in his mind....Dean needed a drink., needed several drinks. In the morning, Sam found him passed out in the front room.
Castiel had run until his legs ached and his lungs burnt with the lack of oxygen. He wasn’t all that fit but somehow the adrenaline burst had kept him running and the champagne had kept him oblivious to the pain. But he had reached beyond his limit, leaving him panting and almost vomiting on the side of the road. And now he was lost and panicking again. The buildings towered above him and the streets were empty and dark. Castiel began to imagine the shadows were watching him, he could almost feel someone behind him, reaching out to grab his shoulder.......he squeaked in fear and tried to run again, but his muscles refused more than a fast gait. He was terrified as he began to think what his father would do when he found out his son was missing. He couldn’t even call him, he had left his phone in his coat back at the gallery. He knew he just needed to find his way home, but he didn’t have a clue where he was. He had realised he was going around in circles when he passed the same dumpster with the same graffiti tag
As he drove home, thoughts of how beautiful Cas was, arose uninvited, unwanted, like extra guests at a wedding. With great effort, Dean pushed those thoughts down, no, not beautiful, Cas was weird, far too serious and annoyingly quiet, probably thought he was too good to talk to Dean....but then other thoughts lay waiting, pushing forward, like eager children. Thoughts about how mysterious Cas was, a mystery that Dean found himself wanting to unravel...and thoughts about how gentle Cas appeared, almost vulnerable and with that thought, Dean felt his cock twitch. In record timing, Dean lent forward and turned on the radio, loud rock music drowning out his intrusive thoughts.
His father smiled before leaning down between his legs. Castiel whimpered again, as his father’s fingers brushed over his abused hole.
Seeing Dean had been difficult. Castiel wanted to go over, just wanted to be near him. And he also desperately wanted to know if he had found anything out about Gabriel. But he knew he couldn’t go over, not when his father was there, watching his every move, testing him. And Castiel knew he couldn’t make a single mistake, couldn’t look at Dean, couldn’t show any interest. But how he wanted to! But he knew Dean didn’t feel the same. And that thought made the cracks and scars in his already broken heart hurt that little bit more.
Dean breathed a sigh of relief at this information, Sam was definitely not gay then, but who the hell was Ruby??
Dick’s hands reached forward, playing with the waistband of Castiel’s suit pants. He continued in a low whisper
But Castiel never bought much from Balthazar, he could never afford to. For whilst his father was rich, he certainly never trusted Castiel with money and certainly never allowed him to get a job. So Castiel had used his intelligence in order to procure his medicine; completing the homework of other students for a price. And so his business of “student support” continued into university, along with a growing appetite for all things in a powder or pill-like form. And so he was never able to save his earnings no matter how hard he tried. It all went to Balthazar.
He was brought back to the present moment by Zachariah’s breath on the back of his neck. He had apparently come over to have a “chat” or rather, to point out Dean’s many mistakes in the gardening department.
They arrived at the university, Castiel unclipped the seatbelt and turned to get out. “What no kiss goodbye for your father?”the voice low, needingly, “of course”, Castiel turned to peek him on the cheek, withdrawing quickly. Zachariah smiled, leaning in, breath hot and sugary, “when you finish your classes, return home immediately, I will be back this evening”. He squeezed Castiel’s thigh, just a bit too hard, “be good”. Out of the car, Castiel realised he had been holding his breath.
Of course Cas said he would pay and even though Dean needed the money, he felt obliged to waiver the fee. After all he had said that he owed Cas a favour. One brother for another. And so he set to work, didn’t have much to go on though. A name, a date of birth, a well-worn photo of Cas’ brother at 15, just before he left. Dean wondered if this was all just a wild ghost chase. But damn it he was gonna do this for Cas, he was gonna find Gabriel.
Dean edged himself slowly out of the bed. He was half way though dressing when he heard her mumble his name;
, his arms opening and Castiel walked up the stairs, slowly climbed into his father’s embrace. And then his father was kissing his damp hair. Smothering him. Breathing him in.
, his father’s voice heavy and thick. And then he added a further two fingers, stretching Castiel out as he writhed beneath him. Zachariah knew it was hurting him, knew that Castiel’s ass was sore and torn from their previous playtime together, but Castiel was his, to do as he pleased. Besides he could tell that the dirty little slut wanted it.
A part of Castiel was wondering where the hell this was all coming from, he had never talked to Balthazar like this before, but he couldn’t seem to stop himself. It was fun. Watching Balthazar’s eyes light up, his smile increase. Yeah this was fun, Maybe a part of him had always known that Balthazar had, well a ‘soft spot’ for him. So he was having fun. And didn’t he deserve that?
But if you asked him now about his regrets? Well now all you would receive as an answer would be the beeping of the machines as they worked to breath for the once formidable man, Zachariah Novak.
his voice serious, with just a hint of interest. And so during the rest of the trip, Dean had continued to babble away about his PI job, pies and anything else he could think of, whilst Castiel nodded and made the occasional comment. Dean even noticed him smile once. It changed his whole face; it made him radiant.
It was a cold night, and not one that Castiel wanted to stay out in. But there was little choice. The rain had not yet come, but there was promise of it in the air. He was alone, beneath the one street light. If he was human, he would have shivered.
Sam left him at home to recover, said he would catch the bus to university. He had tried to help Dean up, had tried to offer him a drink (
Cas wasn’t looking at him anymore, he was holding up a photo that they had got from the school, a photo of Gabriel, 14 years old, must have been taken near to the time he had left.
But before he could finish, his father strode across the room, straddling Castiel on the bed, leaning over him, stroking his face, running his fingers through his hair, staring into his eyes. “So beautiful, my boy”, he whispered. Castiel just lay there, familiar feelings of sickness overrode him, his hunger gone now. His mind, his body felt like they were slowing down. Zachariah swung off him and lay next to him on the bed, still staring into his eyes, stroking his face. It would have been romantic, if it hadn’t been his father. He swallowed and tried to look away, but Zachariah just grabbed his face and turned it toward him.
More memories of the night before flooded back; Sam feeling too high nothing made sense, his head hurting, feeling ready to explode, blood and sickness, everything speeding up, going too fast. It had felt like the devil and god had been raging inside him.
Castiel looked at Dean, genuine concern apparent in his ocean blue eyes. Dean felt his stomach flip, had this guy really propositioned him? Since when was he the one who got propositioned? And then thoughts of pushing Cas into the grimy toilets in “the Pit”, grinding against him, pushing into him, taking back the control. Oh god he HAD to stop this.
And then he saw him. Standing outside the lecture hall. Hands balled into fists in his leather jacket. Jade greed eyes scanning the corridor. And terror gripped the insides of his stomach, “oh god, what if Dean is here to fight?”. The thought flashed through his mind. But Castiel knew he had to face him. Besides would he really start fighting him here in this crowded place? Feeling slightly more confident Castiel walked toward Dean.
Sam looked at him, fragmented memories coming back to him. Of Ruby pushing him to do that extra pill, because hey, one or two wasn’t going to be enough to get that high; to get that rush. And all he remembered was the feeling of power, it had been divine.
He wondered what it was to be normal human being. To have choices. But all his life he had been told what to do and that’s what he was used to. That’s what family was. That’s what love was.
Castiel really didn’t want to go the hospital, but Dean looked and sounded serious. He didn’t have a choice. He slipped back into the impala, being careful to avoid the vomit on the floor. When they arrived at the hospital, Castiel felt confused again. Wait, why was he here?
. Castiel had been close to hysterical, knowing what would happen next. His father grabbed at his flaccid, bloody cock, squeezing it and attempting to coach some interest, with little success. And with that his father had climbed on top of him and unzipped his pants. He spat on his hands and rubbed it on his cock. Castiel had known that this was all the lube he could expect his father to use. His tears had stopped and he had turned his head to look out of the window at the blue, blue sky. Just waiting for it to happen, waiting for it to be done. And then his father had been fully inside him with just one thrust. Invading him, taking him, violating him, tearing him, moaning in pleasure as he pushed further and further. And Castiel had screamed, but his voice was horse and he barely made a sound. And as his father continued to pound into him, he lay lifeless beneath him. Almost numb to the pain, his mind was elsewhere, floating. Everything was distant. When finally Zachariah had reached his orgasm and tired of him, he had dragged Castiel’s semi-conscious body to the empty cupboard in the basement, that that was used for such punishments and shoved him in.
After a coffee (white, 2 sugars) and some bacon (yeah he forced it down), cold water splashed on his face and a change of clothes, Dean was good to go. Sam had been ready for hours, already excitedly going though his extra reading for his philosophy class that day. His major was in Law, but hey it didn’t hurt to do some extra classes, right? His brother Dean couldn’t understand it, all that studying. Why stay indoors reading a load of boring books, when you could be out, meeting girls, getting drunk, whatever. He also seemed to have an inborn dislike of university students (“freaking students”). This was unfortunate given that the cheapest bars were on campus. As a result, he came across students on a regular basis (which of course was a regular reason to complain about them as much as possible). Sam sighed, he loved his brother more than anything, but he wondered how they could be so different.
Zachariah leant down to kiss him, his fingers resuming their attack inside him. He pulled them out again, fingering Castiel’s stretched rim;
But if Dean was flustered, the man before him didn’t seem to notice. Dean realised he was slightly swaying, hmm was he drunk?! Dean gave a slight cough,
In the end, it had all been quite easy. Sam hadn't had access to a car (apparently Dean had taken the impala somewhere) but had lent him money for a taxi to Balthazar’s house, no problem. It all had been more difficult getting his substance needs met by Balthazar due to a severe lack of funds. But he had managed to use his father’s accident to his advantage (ok the tears were genuine, but they certainly helped to soften Balthazar up to his plight). Plus then promising he would pay interest on what he owed ultimately seemed to sway Balthazar to giving some meds up for free (
And yet he carried on, carried on breathing, even when it seemed like this simple act was just like climbing Kilimanjaro. He carried on silent, cold and unchanged, like a statue, impervious and watching the world dance and living it’s life, knowing he wasn’t invited. He was just an observer, an outsider. And sometimes he stared at himself in the mirror, trying to see himself, trying to know who he was. But all he saw was the emptiness that lay beyond his irises. And he was numb, as cold inside as a northern winter, keeping his feelings locked away and somehow he had lost the key. But then there times, in unbidden moments, they would come back, his feelings, crushing in upon him, drowning him, holding him down. He just had to keep running....keep on breathing.....keep on running.
Castiel trailed off and resumed his stare. Was Cas nervous? Was Cas blushing? Dean wondered. Surely not! Suddenly Dean realised he had been standing on the porch of his own house for what seemed like forever, participating in a mutual staring competition....Dean stomped into his house, pushing past Cas. Stupid Cas, with his stupid blue eyes, the last thing he needed was some stupid, jumped up rich kid student hanging around his house, he thought angrily.
It was late when they finished. Dean had offered Benny a lift, which was politely declined, and so he left the studio alone. Standing by his impala, his baby, he shivered in the cold night air. He took a swig of rum from his flask (he had been drinking discreetly all night, knowing that Benny would disapprove but hell, he was most creative after a few drinks). That’s when he heard him.
It was an hour later, Dean was shifting through his notes in the office; going over the information (or lack of) in relation to the Gabriel search. He sighed, that high school teacher, Mr Devlin, there had just been something about him; he had been too relaxed, too charming, almost as though he was practiced in answering awkward questions about Gabriel Novak. But then, the teacher had still given them some insights into Gabriel’s life, more than Cas had been able to remember – according to Luca Devlin then, the teaching body was under the general opinion that Gabriel was a
He felt Dick’s grey eyes looking him up and down barely containing his lust. He felt naked before him. He quickly averted his gaze looking down at the floor, his eyes catching on Dick’s shiny expensive shoes. His father pulled him in closer; could feel his father’s displeasure. Zachariah had never liked Dick looking at him. He had never even let Dick touch him. The only man he hadn’t. He never knew why. Dick had certainly wanted to.
he told himself. His father opened his bedroom door slowly, leaning in the doorway, taking Castiel in. He looked dishevelled, tired even.
Castiel had known of Balthazar most of his life, just from living in the community. There had been some sort of banking scandal. His father had been implicated in the corruption and later imprisoned. His mother had a keener business sense, and promptly divorced Balthazar’s father and remarried into old money, moving the family into the community. So everyone knew of Balthazar’s family and the scandal which held them like a dead man’s grip, refusing to let them go. But for Castiel, it wasn’t until seventh grade that he actually spoke to Balthazar. It had been after school. Balthazar had found him crying and alone in the boys bathroom, not wanting to go home. And he had offered him the only comfort he knew – marijuana. The first moment Castiel had inhaled the thick toxic smoke (after he recovered from coughing) he had felt peace wash over him. And so it began; their business arrangement. It meant he had some control over his medication, didn’t just have to rely on his father’s good will, didn’t have to beg....
Castiel went back to the study group. Sam, Ruby and Jess sat in various positions in the Singer-Winchester front room. Notes and books scatted about along with a large pot of (now cold) coffee and biscuits (and oh yeah some beers, definitely necessary when doing work about whether God exists or not). Sam looked up as Castiel came back into the room,
It was 3pm on a Thursday afternoon. Castiel found himself standing outside Sam’s house. It was the first time he had left the house since the punishment. His face had healed so it was ok to go out. But movement was still difficult, but no one needed to know about that. He clutched his phone (I-Phone XX, latest addition) and his bag (weighed down with philosophy books). He rubbed his wrists together nervously. The marks from the rope binding were still visible and so he pulled the sleeves of his trench coat down to cover them. Castiel hadn’t been to another student’s house, not ever. In fact, the last time he had been to one of his peer’s house was when he was 10 (and that hadn’t ended well). True this wasn’t a social call (the study group had decided to meet at Sam’s house to catch up on some work). However, for Castiel, this was still a big deal, a really big deal. He knocked (maybe more of a tap really) and almost immediately Sam flung open the door. His huge frame taking up the door way.
As soon as Dean had arrived, Castiel knew he was screwed. He knew he could either let the guy in and his father would get angry that he had entertained a guest alone or he could refuse to let him in, and his father would get angry that he had turned
He sounded insistent? Irritated? His father was at the top of the stairs, and Castiel found himself at the bottom, looking up.
He could feel hands on him, their sweaty, needy grasps gripping his face, his wrists, his hips. Fingers twisting his nipple; could hear himself whimper, but he somehow could not pull away. And he couldn’t breathe as he felt the dark shape holding him down, pressing into him. He didn’t want this, no he didn’t want this! But he couldn’t stop it. The unbearable sense of complete powerlessness. And he was so utterly alone. There was no one to take him from this hell. All he had was his father. And he needed his father to love him, and there was only way that he would. His father, his only connection to the world; was the man, whose mouth was on his, pushing his tongue in, a brutal intrusion. And his father inside him; his big adult cock pushing and intruding his narrow channel, stretching him unnaturally. He was trapped beneath the weight, he couldn’t fight it. But he tried, was thrashing around, it was hurting so bad. Now he could feel the hot breath on his face, his father’s whispers, how hot, how tight, how wet. He could feel his father moving slowly in and out, his hole twitching and burning, his father building up speed for the real fucking. And pleasure and pain held hands inside him like childhood friends. He was begging for release....please daddy, please......completely undone on his father’s cock. He was a dirty whore. And he was crying, please daddy please. I don’t want to do this, don’t want to be this. His father’s rough hands pressed over his mouth, he couldn’t speak, couldn’t breathe, couldn’t scream. Fat tears on his cheeks. But they didn’t feel like his cheeks, none of his body felt like his.......
Arriving at the house, his father not yet there, Castiel made his way to the kitchen. He would need to prepare the evening meal for when Zachariah returned...and he also knew he would need to clean the house. Despite the fact that every room was pristine, sterile even, Castiel knew that his father required a heavenly standard of cleanliness, which meant that cleaning every day was a necessity.
It was the afternoon when Castiel heard the front door slam. He was still in the shower; still numb and peaceful from the vicodin. The terror couldn’t get to him. But part of him knew it was there waiting on the sidelines to attack, patient, like a spider. He stopped the shower immediately, even in this state, knew he had to keep it together, had to keep his father happy. He dried himself quickly, dressed quickly. Just simple black pants, a shirt; he had no preference, they were just some clothes his father liked. He walked past the long mirror in the hall, without checking his appearance. Knew what he would see there. So ugly. So broken.
Castiel was standing awkwardly next to his father. The sound of light chatter and laughter mingled with expensive perfume. He sipped on the champagne, the bubbles going to his head. His father absent-mindedly stroked his back, while he stood, transfixed by the enormous painting of a battle scene hung on the plain white wall. The central figure laying bloodied and dying beneath the paw of a lion, whilst all around him, angels and demons fought. Castiel shuddered and looked away. The painting was hideous and glorious all at the same time.
After the conversation about Gabriel, Castiel had wanted to leave, had been insistent that he should go back to his house. Privately, he feared being alone in that big house of his father’s. Besides he wasn’t even sure he would be able to get in; his father changed the key codes regularly, and he wasn’t sure if Zachariah had changed them again without telling him. But he couldn’t tell Dean that – it might seem.....weird. But then Dean had offered for him to stay
, his hand trailing up Castiel’s body, over his hips, stomach, coming to his nipples, pinching them hard so that they raised to attention. He moved his hand further up, coming to rest on Castiel’s neck, imposing a slight pressure, pushing on Castiel’s Adam’s apple, pushing harder again, so breathing was slightly more laboured. Zachariah kissed him lightly. He looked at Castiel, his hand still on his throat;
Dean sat chewing his large ham and egg sandwich slowly, barely tasting it. The events of the night before weighing heavily on his mind, God, Cas had been so sad. God, it sucked his dad was in the hospital. And now this morning.....so sad and yet still so damn beautiful. Dean shifted uncomfortable at just how natural it was to think of Cas as beautiful.....god, no, Cas was just some stupid little druggie rich boy. Dean sighed, he was tired of this internal fight, he knew that as much as he tried to convince himself that Cas wasn’t worth his time, that feeling was there, that desire. But Cas wasn't the only concern on Dean's mind that morning, there were also all the other worries he carried daily by himself; the money he owed, the additional bills he needed to pay, the fact he still hadn’t got any closer to locating Castiel’s brother, his own freaking brother (was Sam really not taking drugs anymore? Was the health kick and extreme health eating any better?)....man, he wanted to get wasted or laid, maybe both. He couldn’t handle it. But as he sat in the kitchen, slowly chewing his sandwich, he showed no indication of any of the stress he was carrying. To a casual observer, he might have even seemed carefree.
Sometimes it just felt like this loneliness was a living thing, chasing him, devouring him whole. And sometimes in moments of clarity, when he was in the state between sleeping and wakefulness, he could feel the edges of it, the great dark emptiness that lived and breathed inside of him. His greatest fear being that he would fall inside it’s blackness and be consumed by it. He was just so alone with these demons that sought to feed upon him. And there was no one to care, no one to save him. Because there was no saving him.
he said before trailing his fingers along Castiel’s hardening cock; and then reaching down to pull Castiel’s balls, massaging them into his hand
, Castiel startled at the sound of the familiar voice above him. He looked up to find a concerned Dean looking down at him. He tried to hide his sniffling as he edged himself up the wall into a standing position.
His father hadn’t risen from his room and it was growing dark outside. Castiel hoped that maybe his father would just sleep through. But then he knew even if his father did, he would just be worrying, waiting all night for his door to gently open....knew his body wouldn’t allow him sleep, would be in constant threat mode, a heightened state of panic, preparing him for the worst. He just wanted the tension to end. He just wanted it all to end. But he knew it wouldn’t. Knew that there was only one thing he could do.
”, it struck a chord the first time he saw it and the second, and now seeing it again the third time, he knew he was lost. His mind on all the punishments his father would concoct. He had been running low on money and he knew the pills he had weren’t going to cover for what his father was going to do to him. He started shaking, his thoughts spiralling out of control, he couldn’t work out what he needed to do, he couldn’t move. He sank down next to the dumpster, half-sobs escaping his lips, he just needed to calm down, he just needed to work out where he was.....why the hell had he run? Why was so fucking stupid? His mind felt slow and heavy, further addled by the champagne he had forced down earlier.
The worst of it wasn’t the cuts, the bruises, the blood, that covered his body, but his eyes. Dark, empty, soulless. It was like there was nothing left of him.
He was doing his best to sound in control, like it was perfectly normal to wake up in some random guy’s house. He just wanted to be home. Just wanted to see his father. But then, he also didn’t want his father to hurt him, to fuck him. He just wanted everything to be ok. And then he just started to cry. Loud and messy, this was not sexy crying, this was just a man, completely alone, letting out deep and painful guttural moans as he recalled his nightmare, the night before and the reality of his pathetic and sad little life. Dean could see that Cas was just about turning into a hot mess on his bedroom floor. So he did all he knew how, got down on the floor and encircled the man a tight hug and rocked him back and forth. Hell, it had always worked when Sam had fallen over or whatever.
In fact Dean had begun to wonder if he should start charging Cas, god, he was in so much debt, Bobby didn’t know the half of it and Sam never had a clue. But he had promised Cas, had told him that he owed him. He couldn’t go back on that now, but secretly he had begun to wonder, maybe he could just slowly drop the case and concentrate on catching the usual cheats and liars. Hell, he didn’t have a clue where to find Gabriel or even if he wanted finding. But looking at Cas’, his excitement at the possibility of finding his brother, hell he just couldn’t do it, couldn’t tell him he didn’t want to do it anymore. Hell, if it was Sam, he would never give up. So instead Dean said
he repeated, breathing faster, just getting his words out, his father’s body entrapping him. Zachariah slammed into him, the pain mixed in with this wave of pleasure. And then his father was cumming inside him, spilling his seed inside him, panting and kissing him, forcing his tongue inside him.
. And then he was pushing inside slowing, could feel the way that Castiel’s tight walls gripped him, leaning over and whispering into Castiel’s ear
And then one day, when Castiel was 6 and Gabriel was 14, she was gone. Zachariah never had informed them where, just carried on, like she had never existed.
. After Dean had left the bedroom, Castiel had sunk down onto the bed. He had pulled out the photo of Gabriel, his fingers tracing the outline of Gabriel’s face. He wondered what he looked like now, 14 years later. He had had so much faith in Dean, had been so sure that he would find him. But now? Dean hadn’t seemed so certain that he could find him and Castiel couldn’t help but wonder - what if it took too long to find Gabriel? He just needed to find him so bad. Castiel sighed quietly to himself – what if Dick Roman really did know where Gabriel was?.......
he trailed off as he realised Dean was not even listening, just staring morosely at the small pile of vomit on the impala floor
He liked to think that, liked to pretend that he wasn’t human. Sometimes he even imagined he was an alien or even an angel, it was his only explanation for why, why he never quite fitted anywhere, not even in his own family. Now, that really made him shiver.
He knew he had to get up. Pushing himself off the floor, whimpering quietly to himself as he moved slowly on all fours to the bathroom, could feel the sticky mess of cum and blood between his legs, in his hair, on his body. He wanted to cry but the tears wouldn’t come. He just needed to get himself clean.
). Balthazar had barely retrieved them from his special hiding place (the air vent in his room), wherein Castiel had snatched them out of his hand, crushing them under a glass of water and snorting them as soon as possible. The feeling of euphoria and gentle giddiness quickly swept over him; along with a strong need to communicate how much he loved Balthazar. Smiling, he lent over to a bemused Balthazar, lightly brushing his lips against his. He was sure that he could see a halo surrounding Balthazar.
And Gabriel had got more and more defiant upon her leaving, arguing openly with his father, earning him more bruises and more trips to the closet. But he didn’t seem to care. Castiel remembered one of the last times he saw his brother, that memory was the clearest of them all. Castiel had woken to the sounds of his brother’s screams, the sound echoing through the house. His father had been beating him again. He had wanted it to stop but he hadn’t known how. Just crawled under his bed and prayed to a God that never came. The next day Castiel had crept into Gabriel’s bedroom.
Dean was at the Novak house, doing some hoeing and other gardening stuff (seriously what did he know about gardening?) He had hoped he would be able to talk to Cas privately about the progress (or lack of) with the “Gabriel search”. However, Cas was sitting with his father and his father’s friends on the decking next to the pool (annoyingly still wearing his usual covered-up formal attire). He definitely got the sense that Cas didn’t want to speak to him. Besides, Cas had made it clear he didn’t want his father to know about the search. Dean had guessed Cas didn’t want to upset him if it wasn’t possible to find Gabriel. He guessed Zachariah must be pretty cut up about the whole thing. But then again, he was curious, what had happened? Cas seemed pretty certain Gabriel hadn’t gone to Canada. So had Gabriel run away? And if he had, it begged the question – why?
As they continued to walk in silence, thoughts of Dean’s kiss came back to Castiel, could this be a date? Would Dean want to fuck him afterwards? That’s all he was good for after all. But then would Dean even want to fuck someone as corrupted as himself? Or was that kiss a mistake? After all Dean had pushed him away, rejected him.....Maybe Dean just feel guilty about what happened with Sam and feel compelled to buy him coffee as an apologetic gesture?
But when they arrived at the community gates, Castiel’s face had closed like a cupboard door. They sat awkwardly for a moment. Castiel didn’t want to leave the safety of the car. Wanted to stay here, with this man with a goofy grin, who talked too much about pies and who smelt so damn good. And part of Dean didn’t want him to leave either. And then without realising what he was doing, Dean lent forward and kissed Castiel. Softly. Lips brushing gently. But before Castiel could gather his thoughts, Dean was pushing him away.
a steely voice behind him stated. Dean turned to find a middle aged man standing by the patio doors. He was tall, well-built and would have been attractive, had it not been for the sharpness in his face, the cutting coldness of his blue eyes and the faint hint of cruelty in his thin lips.
They ate breakfast together, and he watched his father, pour coffee (black, 1 sugar) for him and feed him the croissant. And all this time, it felt like he was far away somewhere, with only the lightest touch holding him to this moment. Like a balloon at the end of a string, he could just float away, if only he just let go. But maybe that was just the medication. He needed it, but he couldn’t remember what for. ADHD, depression, anxiety, psychosis? His father gave him the medication every day, for as long as he could remember. And if he was really good, he would get more. And today Zachariah said he had been really good.
Castiel felt panicked, he hated hospitals, hospitals meant doctors and doctors meant uncomfortable questions and paying for treatments, which always pissed off his father...oh, his father.....details of the night were coming back now. Castiel touched his head gingerly, could feel the blood. He didn’t think it was that bad, he had had worse. Besides he had deserved it, launching himself on Dean like a whore in heat. It had seemed like a good idea at the idea, pushing himself on Dean; the champagne (and yeah, lets face it, those lines of coke he had done earlier) had annihilated his (many) inhibitions. The part of him that told him that Dean wasn’t gay; wouldn’t even look at him, even if he was, had been conveniently forgotten in the moment, in that moment of need. The need just to be close to someone and to forget; forget himself and what his father would do to him. He had just been so afraid. That was all he ever was.
They arrived at “the Pit”, the only place Dean knew on campus (besides they made great pecan pie and they probably served coffee). They had walked in silence; Dean was just relieved the apology had gone so well. Cas had seemed to forgive him so easily, he had expected to have to work harder. But when he had simply told Cas that he was sorry about his behaviour and that Sam was doing ok; Cas had just smiled and accepted it. Dean had wondered if this acceptance was too good to be true. So he had tried harder to explain why he had made the mistake and how truly sorry he was. But Cas had just looked embarrassed and gone a rather charming shade of red. It was almost as if he didn’t think he deserved an apology. All he seemed concerned about was that Dean not tell his father that he had been in “the Cage”. Dean could understand that, he knew all about homophobic fathers. At that point, it had seemed that the conversation was going to end, that Cas was going to leave for his class. And Dean had just wanted to talk to him a bit more; hadn’t wanted him to go. And somehow he had ended up asking him for coffee. What the hell? Had he really asked Cas on a date? He quickly shook his head at that thought. Dean Winchester did not date and he certainly did not date men! He decided that this was just a friend-thing. Just two guys, who may have kissed (briefly) but who were now just going to have a friendly coffee....yeah this was definitely just a friend thing. Definitely.
But Naomi, his mother had found out. He had seen her standing in his bedroom doorway, while his father had rutted into him, sweating and groaning. But she had silently slipped away, had done nothing. Castiel had just been relieved that she had not been angry.
He didn’t have class today, but he had reading to do, assignments to think about. But he could do that later, right now he just wanted to lie down, could feel the medication taking hold. Everything was good, really. His father was talking “so, I'm going to hire someone to come and do the landscaping and he is coming today to have a look, so I should be back early” Castiel nodded. Just so long as he didn’t have to speak to anyone, not without his father present. He knew where that could lead.....jealous accusations, threats....
Sam was looking around the room, almost as if he expected Castiel to jump out from his hidden place.
. Cas looked at him again and Dean felt his piercing eyes upon him, almost like he was truly seeing him. Could he know that Dean couldn’t stop having all those wrong thoughts about him?
t was 9.15am and Dean was standing outside the philosophy lecture theatre. Uncomfortable. All these geeky nerds rushing around him like minnows made him itch to get the hell out. But he was waiting for Cas. Didn’t know what he was going to say. But he knew he owed him this much.
Dick smiled, closing the space between them. Castiel stepped back only to be met by the wall behind. Dick reached forward, tracing a finger along Castiel’s face. The gentleness at odds with the brutal nature, which Castiel knew lay underneath the expensive suit and mask of civility.
Dean awkwardly made an attempt to initiate conversation (he had got the call yesterday, confirming his employment). Castiel just turned to look at him, doing his head-cocking thing (arrahhh, so cute). Dean rubbed the back of his neck nervously,
Seriously, Dean didn’t know how someone as sweet as Cas could be related to such a dickwad like Zachariah. He looked over at the small party at the pool, could see that Cas was lying on the sun-lounger, it looked like he was just trying to ignore his father and his friends, despite the fact that they kept trying to drag him into conversation by making jokes about him and prodding him. Weird. He wished he could go over there and......hell he didn’t know. Cas had entirely freaked him out the other day, propositioning him and all that. It’s always the quiet ones you gotta watch. But hell, it was for the best that he had rejected him anyway, Castiel clearly wasn’t that interested. He hadn’t even looked at him once since he had got to the garden. Besides that girl Lisa from the bar the other night had called him and they were going out later. Not a date though. Hmmm he might even get lucky.
Castiel approached the lecture hall. He had already decided that he would catch the bus to the hospital after the first lecture. Go and see Sam. He hoped Dean would be there, hoped he would be able to explain everything.
. Sam was worried about Castiel. It had freaked him out, one minute this guy seemed normal (albeit as normal as this guy would ever be) and the next he was on the floor, struggling for breath like, well, like a fish when it had been pulled out of water.
He sat down on the bed next to Castiel and lightly carded his hands though Castiel’s hair. Castiel could feel the blood rushing around his body, everything was wonderful, amazing.
His father smiled at him. His father was in a good mood. Castiel wanted to make sure he stayed that way. He would do anything to keep his father happy. He leaned in to kiss his father.
Dean was at the student bar aka “the pit”. It really was a dive, but hey it was cheap drinks and even cheaper women. Despite all this, he was pretty fucking depressed. Damn it, he was in so much debt right now. And there was that other thing that was bothering him, those blue eyes, that Cas. He was keeping him up at night. Hell, he had been woken himself up the other night, moaning and writhering over a dream about fucking this guy. His sheets a mess of sweat and stickiness. This was definitely not cool. He needed to get himself some pussy, like yesterday. But the pit was pretty dead at 3pm and besides he had some stuff to do for Bobby, so he downed the rest of his whiskey and went to find the impala (yeah drinking definitely made his driving better). He pulled up outside the house. He knew it looked a bit like a shambles, all faded blue paint and dirty windows. The wooden porch looked like it had decidedly better days and there was a rusty car on the driveway (Bobby’s pet project which had never quite got off the ground). But hell, it was home, which was damn sight more than he had had growing up. Hmmm unhappy childhood, check, daddy issues, check, god he was such a cliché. He went to open the front door, only to find it was locked. What the fuck? And oh shit, he had forgotten his keys. He banged loudly on the door. He wondered if Sam had locked the door because he had a girl in there. He had mentioned someone recently. Lucky bastard. The door opened and for a second time, Dean was greeted with an intense pair of blue eyes. In. his. doorway. What the fuck? He was almost too stunned to say anything. The man in his front door continued to stare at him, he tilted his head as if trying to solve a particularly complex puzzle (god, that was so cute, Dean noticed absent-mindedly). And oh god, what must Cas think of this shit pile?
Dean had left the house that afternoon, mumbling something about getting his baby ‘properly’ cleaned. Cas really hadn’t understood this, but hadn’t questioned him. He was starting to feel just a little bit edgy, restless even. He looked down at his hands, could see they were starting to shake. Could feel his stomach curling and retracting, the hunger he had been ignoring spiking. But even though his stomach was empty, he still felt like he was gonna throw up. He knew he needed his medication and maybe a little extra something. The painkillers he had taken for his concussion, just weren’t hitting him hard enough; he could start to feel the edges of the shadows. He wondered if he should just take more painkillers, maybe they would help him just pass out. As he was contemplating his rather limited options, he suddenly heard the front door bang shut, the sound of someone running up the stairs and with that, he was confronted with a Sam, as he ripped open the bedroom door. A moment of silence followed as Sam attempted to comprehend what Castiel, the quiet guy from his study group and oh yeah his saviour from
Castiel’s cries had become slower, quieter as he sucked in air slowly. His face was red and covered in snot. But Dean looked at him and sighed quietly, the man was still divine. Cas was pulling away slightly now, looking around at the room, taking in the mess, clothes lying on the floor, posters of half naked women, papers in a big pile in the corner, photos of Sam and Dean, several empty bottles of whiskey and rum lying on the floor and the small table by the door, the duvet on the floor....Cas realised Dean must have slept on the floor, he must have given him the bed, he immediately felt ashamed, he didn’t deserve this sort of kindness.
He trailed off as he saw the disappointment in her eyes. She knew he wouldn’t want to see her again. She wondered what she had done wrong. He left her apartment feeling jaded, tired. Knew that if he had woken up to blue eyes and not brown, he would never have left. He sighed. He really needed to book another appointment with that therapist to get rid of these wrong thoughts once and for all.
