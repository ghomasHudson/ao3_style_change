Sam gives him that "but I just wanna talk about our emotions™" frown that Dean loves to roll his eyes at, but he gets up after a moment and crosses the room to his own bed.
Dean can finally breathe again, taking refuge in the pain. He calmly fastens his shirt, smearing blood all over each button.
Dean gets hooked on the video calls before long. He feeds on the brief moments of happiness it gives him. He sleeps better. Phone sex is a lot more fun. Dean's got no idea how he lasted until now without seeing Castiel, but he certainly can't do it anymore.
Cas stays silent, but his eyes travel down to Dean's bleeding hands, which he's not doing a great job of hiding.
his emotions actually, until he feels like he's still dreaming. Like he isn't properly attached to his body, ready to come loose and float away, away to a place that's just like this, but...not.
When the morning comes, Dean doesn't get up right away, because he knows he hasn’t done his body any favors by crashing on a hardwood floor. He can already feel the beginnings of aches that will probably stick with him all day, and the slightest movement of his shoulders causes them to crack. Meanwhile, his mind is swimming, turning in circles, trying to make sense of the night before.
"That's my boy," Cas said, and for some reason Dean had felt violated rather than reassured. There was something so
Dean is about to reach for another, when he realizes he's been disturbing the pile with every note he pulled out. In a rush, he returns them all, hoping it looks at least close to the way he found it, then spins around and hurries back to his own room.
"Yes. I am." Cas said, and then he caught Dean off guard. "Dean, do you miss me? Don't you? Haven't you been lonely?" He sounded strained, rushed, like he was trying to open a pickle jar and also late for something. But Dean brushed it off. Those questions were too potent to be pushed aside.
"This doesn't feel real," Dean admits. "I don't want it to be real, Cas, I…I got so used to–to still having you, and that made it all so much easier but now…" his voice falters. "Now I—I don't know what I'm supposed to do, I don't want this to…I don't want—I just don't want this!"
When Dean reaches his bedroom, he ducks inside like the cops are on his heels and shuts the door, leaning against it and letting his breath come shivering out.
Dean's breath hitches and he shivers, from the intimacy of the unexpected action as much as how fucking
Before Dean can get his brain back online, Cas pauses for a second, and then he just pulls Dean close to him, gently guiding Dean's head to rest on his shoulder. Dean is frozen, all at once forgetting how to breathe, how to move, how to do
Dean isn't going to get better. He can't. Day and night, he agonizes over Castiel, imprisoned forever in a living death. All alone in his grave.
When Dean wakes in the morning, he tells himself, decidedly, that the shadow in front of his door had been a dream. Just a really nice dream.
The days feel long and lonely, and Dean counts the minutes until the evening, when he can finally step back into what's starting to seem like an entirely different world.
An eternity of a moment passes, and then all at once Cas drops his anger, but rather than backing off, he steps closer. Cas tilts his head slightly with a look of realization, but he keeps their eyes locked, and for the life of him Dean can't look away. He's captivated. He never won’t be.
Dean's just too overwhelmed, the fear and misery and self hatred devouring him in a raw moment of vulnerability.
"You're okay," Cas tells him. His voice is low and soft, and Dean is embarrassed by the amount of relief that floods his senses when it's only been a
if you love when Dean is sad like i love when Dean is sad put your motherfuckin hands in the air \o/
"I miss the sun," Cas whispers. "I miss seeing you in the sunlight. Your skin always smelled so good when you were in the sun all day."
Dean's head is swimming, and it feels like the room is expanding, leaving him alone on a vast plain of static, deafeningly quiet save for the sound of the fabric beneath him straining in his clenched fist.
They talk during the drive. Oddly enough, about regular things, as though trying to stem the tide of grief they both know is coming. Dean fills Castiel in on current events, brings up memories they can both laugh at, tells stories and anecdotes of his life before they met. It almost feels like it could be a normal long drive. Except the seat beside Dean is empty. Only Castiel's voice keeps him company. And soon, he won't even have that.
What must've been several minutes pass by at an agonizingly slow pace, but Dean eventually begins to feel his breathing even out, frayed nerves knitting back together. That’s always been the effect Castiel has on him. Dean feels safe when he's nearby, and frankly it's fucking scary in a way.
After all that, only Cas called first, at the same time every month. And if he missed it, Dean was not to call him, because it might not be his Cas that answered.
Dean's hands are shaking as he tries to button up the flannel and he groans at the ceiling in frustration.
to be pissed because his normal coping mechanisms aren't working and that terrifies him. Dean wants to break something. Kill something.
Castiel, more than he should, more than he has any right to ask for. More than anything else he wants this to really be what it feels like. Because an ever-growing ache has begun to blossom in his chest whenever he looks at Cas, and thinks about how much this feels like love.
"It's alright, Dean," he whispers. "It's alright. No matter what happens, I'll be with you. I won't let you go alone."
Dean feels as if his insides are crumpling in on themselves, calcifying into tiny, cold stones in his chest.
And because no matter how plastered he was, there were always those moments, as he grasped for purchase at dirty tiles, felt a stranger's hand grip his hair and yank his head back, heard a stranger panting in his ear, that he would imagine he wasn't with a man whose name he didn’t even bother to know.
Dean sighs unevenly, and with shaking hands, he grips the edge of Castiel's coat and doesn’t let go until he falls into a fitful sleep.
Before he can think twice, Dean snatches his phone and accepts the call. Slowly, he lies back down and brings it to his ear, heart still hammering in his chest. He doesn't say anything. He can't. He just listens to the faint white noise until Cas speaks.
Sometimes, though, their eyes will meet, and for the briefest moment, something unspoken is communicated between them. Something that words can't express, some kind of understanding that feels peaceful and intense all at once.
Castiel's face is unreadable in the dark, and Dean can't get himself to speak, so instead, he moves just slightly closer.
Cas sounds worse every time Dean hears from him. Occasionally he breaks the rules and sends Dean a tiny text, usually just one sappy emoji, and Dean's heart can't decide whether to swell or to break all over again.
Pale light from the hallway spills in, stretching across the room to creep up Dean's shoulder. Dean can see a figure in the doorway, just a silhouette, but he knows who it is. Of all the people to catch him like this. He looks away, shame burning his face.
After getting clean, Dean is feeling just a little bit more normal. He wraps himself in his dead guy robe and snags a bottle of whiskey from the kitchen table before retreating to his room. Because being clean doesn't fix everything. Admittedly, neither does alcohol, but out of the two it definitely does a better job.
Defeated, Dean just curls up after that and cries, cradling his bleeding hands to his chest, shaking with emotion, and he wishes he were dead.
Dean has no memory of the past few minutes, much less actually falling asleep. In the sudden stillness, Dean stares at his brother for several seconds, eyes glazed and unfocused. Then all at once, his whole body just deflates, hands slipping from the wheel, shoulders sagging pitifully as the tension abandons them. He blinks a few times and looks away.
another chapter down! I am seriously over the MOON that this fic already has a few kudos and even a bookmark. stay tuned clowns!
Dean closes his eyes for almost two full Mississippi seconds, swaying into Castiel's touch, chasing the warmth that it spreads over him. He doesn't have the energy to make believe he doesn't want this, much less to offer even a halfhearted protest. As soon as he'd felt that contact, Dean gave up his objective to avoid this interaction. The truth is he’s been starving for someone to touch him since before he was even home.
Cas makes his way across the room, footsteps soft and slow. He doesn’t turn the lamp on. He just carefully sits on the bed, same as he did that first night.
Dean pulls back, staring at Cas. "What? Wh—Sam told you about the fucking box, didn't he?" It comes out a lot more accusatory than he'd intended, and Dean instantly feels bad.
There's a pause, and then a small thump next to Dean's ear as Cas rests his head on the other side of the door.
"Why didn't you warn me earlier?!" Dean suddenly cries. "So I could've—I could've…" he's not even sure. What
"Cas, hey," he says, squinting at the screen. "Shit, sorry, I um…I guess I was more tired than I thought."
"You don’t have to be," Sam says softly, and Dean grinds to a halt. He sets his jaw, exhales slowly, doesn’t turn around.
The familiar rumble of his baby interrupts his thoughts. Sam is back from a dinner run. Dean turns over and shuts his eyes, pretending to be asleep, because he started this day not wanting to talk to anyone, and he is damn well gonna end it that way too.
Dean winces, a raw cry escaping through his teeth. He nearly doubles over as jolts of pain stab into his temples, and he starts to stagger away, pressing both palms into his forehead. Following that deep-seated instinct he has to isolate himself when he's in distress.
They don’t speak about any of it during the day. They carry on as if nothing has changed, and everyone else in the bunker is none the wiser.
"I'm sorry, baby," Dean almost sobbed, his emotions seizing control. "I'm so sorry, I thought I didn't have a choice, I thought we'd tried everything—fuck, you're right, this–this was never a good idea! Cas, I love you and I—I'm on my way, okay? I'm on my way, I'm gonna come get you, okay?"
He watches it until his eyelids get so heavy, he can barely keep them open. He was so sure he hadn't wanted anyone to be around him tonight, but this...he can make an exception. This, he can handle. This is okay.
"Cas?" He answers, trying to cover up the relief and drowsiness that are still tugging at him. "What's up?"
When he jolts awake this time, he's hanging halfway off the bed, disoriented and naked, his ears ringing.
Dean wakes earlier than he should've. The storm has passed over, and the morning sun still shines pale and thin. Dean hears birds chirping and the occasional car rush by.
"The Mark," Dean said numbly as his heart hit the ground, dragging with it all the foolish hope that had warmed his lonely soul for a short while.
But nothing is okay. Dean can feel despair swallowing him up, flooding his lungs, drowning him. Still he forces himself to listen.
Dean feels like he should be opening the door and dealing out apologies, or at the very least saying
He was wrong. The end is here, and his mind is a mess. He still harbors some ridiculous notion that this could all be a dream, still prays that he'll wake up and find his angel lying peacefully beside him. It's not like stranger things haven't happened.
"Do you, um, do you wanna…tell me about it?" Sam sounds like he knows what the answer will be, but can’t help trying anyway.
just come here. We can pretend none of this ever happened tomorrow, okay, like how we already been doing? Like that. We were gonna do that anyway, yeah? So get. Over. Here."
Dean smiles back and tries to keep it together. "You ain't so bad yourself," he says, but it still comes out with the heavy shade of sadness he was hoping to hide. Maybe there's no point in hiding it anymore. This is the last time he will ever do this, the last time he'll ever speak to Castiel, the love of his life. His angel.
Dean drags himself back up, and feeling horribly exposed, he gathers up his towel and hugs it against his body. Then he just lies there, panting, too tired to move any more. In his periphery he can see Cas outside the door again.
The phone is ringing. Might've been for longer than Dean's willing to admit. He's not even sure what time of day it is. Dean rolls over and frees one hand from beneath his blanket to accept the call. It's a little past 11 PM. So he's actually sleeping at an appropriate time today, who knew. He puts the call on speaker.
"At least let me heal you," Cas says, and as soon as his hand drops from Dean's chest, he kinda wishes Cas had kept it there. Okay, he
In the paper thin safety of the bathroom, Dean pries damp clothes from his body and stands in front of the mirror, avoiding his own red-rimmed eyes in the reflection. Rain keeps falling outside, a dismal staccato pelting the roof.
to kiss the bastard. The long drives with his brother snoring obliviously beside him, when his lonely mind pines for something he doesn't quite have, and tears well up in his eyes as he watches the dark road in the headlights.
"I'm not." His voice grits out through his teeth, low and hoarse, but thankfully steady. It takes every ounce of self control he has left to crush down the lump in his throat. He finally turns.
Would Cas really have reciprocated? Dean doesn’t know. Cas deserved better anyway. But it doesn’t matter now. Dean is simply finding whatever dulls the grief, if even for a minute, and chasing it like a drug.
Sam's mouth twitches in that way it always does when he wants to hug you, but doesn’t know if it would even help.
The room is cast in a warm golden hue, lit by a few more lamps than Dean remembered, a couple of them squeezed in next to the bedside lamp, one on the desk, and one just plugged in on the floor. A tangled pile of Christmas lights are plugged in on the other side of the bed, not arranged in any way, just sprawling. Every shadow is soft and hazy, giving the room a dreamlike quality.
"Dean," Cas replies, and he's trying to hide the joyful side of his voice, trying to keep from encouraging this, but Dean can hear it. "Is everything okay?"
"Will you…just rest for a little while? I want to watch you sleep beside me one last time. If you would."
"Just go get the fucking food so we can bring him home." Dean's voice falters on the last few words and he curses himself internally. He sure isn’t making a good case for not needing any comforting. "And don’t waste cash on me, I'm not hungry," he adds hoarsely.
"Dean." Cas stops him. "It's alright. I understand your fear, but you don’t have to worry. I'll be very cautious, and I
Dean nods, then turns away, because he wants to stop crying, to stop making this about himself, but he can't. The tears just keep on falling. He tries to steel himself and push the sorrow back, as he gets a blanket from the car and lays it down on the golden-tinged grass. It's stiff and dry, that grass, and Dean can still feel it poking at him through the blanket in a few spots. He props up his phone on a crumbly gray rock, and he finally meets Castiel's eyes again.
Instead, he dreams of possession. Michael breaking free, taking back the control Dean so stupidly gave to him, using Dean's hands to slaughter everyone he loves.
"Dean. None of this is your fault. I promise you that. What happened to Cas, that’s all Lucifer. And we'll kill that son of a bitch, okay? We will. I'll be fucking
Dean doesn’t want to sleep. He just wants to keep driving, to bring his angel home for the last time. But willpower could only carry him so far, and the intense fatigue he's been battling eventually comes out on top.
The golden light spills out, illuminating Castiel in stark detail and jagged shadows way too angular for the soft glow.
to. He turns onto his side to face the door, curled up, and wishes, or maybe begs, for Castiel to come back.
Alone now with nothing but his thoughts for company, Dean wonders why the fuck he'd actually asked for this. The silence in the room is stifling, strangling. The air is stale. Dust motes drift in slow motion, glowing in the stripe of sun coming through the curtains. The occasional noises outside sound far off and fake, like he's been placed in his own little cell of quiet.
Dean sleeps a lot more than he used to. Being awake makes him tired. And sometimes, he dreams of a different world. Just mundane things, like waking up with Cas beside him. Or just going about a regular day, and passing by Cas. Dean's mind doesn't hesitate to remind him of what he's starving for. He wants to live in those dreams all day. So most days, he does just that. Sleeps off a day's worth of fatigue from doing absolutely nothing.
Dean raises an eyebrow, looking around as he wanders to the bed and perches on the edge. He feels an odd calm being here in Castiel's glowing sanctum, an almost unreal sense of peace. He brushes his fingers absently over the pillow, then yanks his hand back in embarrassment.
"You'd do anything to have me back, wouldn't you, Dean? If there was a way, you would dig me up, wouldn't you?"
The road stretches out, endless and dark in front of the Impala. Dean has been driving for hours, non stop. It's past midnight, and Dean's body knows he needs a break, but his mind keeps screaming in protest. He can't, not with Castiel lying cold and dead in the back seat. He won't take a break like this is any old regular fucking day. He doesn’t have the right.
Dean decides that he only imagined hearing his name as he walked away, because he's pretty goddamn sure he heard Castiel's voice break, and he
Dean slips painfully back to his senses as his brother pads to the bed and takes a seat beside him. Sam doesn't say anything, just sits there. Dean draws in a shaky breath.
Dean shakes his head, covering his eyes with one hand. They just got here and he's already crying. Great.
For the first time in probably ever, Dean's thoughts, or at least the one thought he can comprehend right now, is entirely drowning out Michael.
Dean scolds the part of his brain that wants so desperately to lean in and kiss Castiel. Just to try it. Just to see if he'll kiss back. Because what if he did? What if, what if,
both pause, and Dean realizes he's not the only one who feels like he's just stepped into another world.
"Yeah. Fine. I am," Dean admits. Fuck it, if he can't confess his feelings he can at least practice with stuff that isn’t so high stakes, right?
Caving to the guilt, Dean withdraws his hands from Castiel's grasp, curling in on himself, putting his walls up, guarding himself from facing his emotions in the only way he’s ever known how.
"You can't sleep," Cas states, and once again it's not a question. He knows what's going on. He always knows.
"Yeah," he breathed, feeling weightless as his hopes had taken off far higher than they ever should.
For the first time since this…thing started, Dean enters to find Castiel already waiting for him. He takes a sip from the bottle to hide his surprise.
"Dean. You drifted to the wrong side of the road. Get out and switch with me. Now," Sam says firmly. "I'm not losing
" He mutters, twisting to work out a few more spots in his spine. Damn, does his head hurt something fucking nasty. The pleasant sunshine mercilessly stabs little needles into the backs of his eyes. The pain in his hands is still dull but insistent.
Paralysis. Dean is familiar with it. He knows it's not real, tries to focus on keeping that thought at the front of his mind, but it never works. The utter helplessness is too much.
After a few minutes of silence, Cas gently lays his hand on Dean's back, just below his neck, tracing small lines with his thumb.
Numbly, Dean watches as rust colored liquid runs off his body and circles the shower drain, gradually turning clear again like muddy tap water after a storm. He can still smell the scent of the blood and miscellaneous filth that was splattered across his arms and chest only minutes ago.
Dean silently yells at himself, as he sits there, still as a frightened animal, listening to the soft receding footsteps in the hall.
Dean thinks, and the thought leaves him a little paler. It's too accurate, too real. It makes too much sense to be okay.
Dean can't speak. Even now he knows that he's wasting precious minutes he will never get back, but he's paralyzed. He thought he had been prepared for this. He really fucking wasn't. Slowly he shakes his head, lower lip trembling between his teeth, eyes screwed shut.
But inevitably, in classic "good thing" style, it ends, and the nightmares claw their way back in. And then Dean's in Hell again, the terror returned to tear him up again. And then he's waking up in a panic.
are what finally bested him? Just because the feelings were for a guy? Because he was sure that guy was way too good for him anyway? He should've been able to push the past and his stupid insecurity away and man up.
It's not long before Dean's calls with Cas get even more spaced out. First it was once a day. Then, they started to skip days. Then, as if they could both sense exactly how fast their time was dwindling, there was an unspoken decision to change to once a week. That became once a month.
It started with the night that Dean called, and Cas answered, and something was off but Dean had ignored it. He didn't want to believe it.
"Alright, alright." Sam rolls his eyes and turns the laptop towards Dean. "Looks like a pretty simple vampire problem. Not too far either, like 40 miles out. Multiple vics found with their throats ripped out, blood drained, you know the drill. Authorities are claiming animal attacks."
Dean gasps desperately when he finally breaks free, breath hitching, taking in huge gulps of air like he's just nearly drowned.
He finds Cas settled on a sofa in front of a low table. It looks like he's been here long enough to get comfy, probably hours, because Cas just isn't a "get comfy" kind of guy, especially not when he's doing research.
Dean usually avoids the library whenever he can, because when he can't, he's stuck there for way too long. But he knows that’s where he'll find his angel, so he makes a beeline for it, vaguely wondering when exactly he started thinking of Castiel as "
"Well let me know if you ever figure that one out," Cas says with a grin that's bittersweet, but mostly just bitter. Because if Dean ever does figure that out, he won't be able to let Cas know, not anymore. Maybe he could pray. But Cas won't be able to respond.
Dean sighs wistfully and opens his dresser drawer, fishing out a soft, thin cotton tee with the sleeves and collar cut off and the faded logo of some bar in Tennessee. He shrugs it on and drifts out to the hallway, barefoot.
Cas just stares in disbelief for several seconds. Impatient, Dean lifts his eyebrows, waiting for an answer.
All the blissful dreams he's had, dreams of sunshine lighting up those eyes, making them shift from a rich, deep Midwest lake to the soft shade of a clear morning sky. Dreams of a trench coat tossed idly on the corner of his bed like it had always belonged there, of combing his fingers through messy dark hair. Dreams of his hands caressing warm tanned skin, or clinging to it, that body arched over his own, damp with sweat…
"That all happened," he whispers, praying he won’t get a confirmation, his voice so small he had to double check it actually came from his own mouth. Sam leans forward and looks at him.
That day was painful, for all of them. Cas had finally swapped his sadness and quiet concern for anger, and Sam just fucking combined them.
Before long, the terror comes back as it always does, haunting images robbing him of sleep again, and Dean drags himself to the door, bringing a blanket this time.
Dean's phone is dead now, though he'd conserved it for as long as he could. It's so dark and so small in here,
A look of sadness crossed over her face.  “Oh, Sam.  Dean isn’t coming back.  He can’t.  He’s gone.  It’s not that I won’t let his soul cross back to the realm of the living.  His soul is gone.  The blade that killed him destroyed his soul.  I didn’t collect it when he died because there was nothing to collect.  I’m sorry, but your brother really is gone.”
“I wanted to do something nice for you,” Dean told him as he guided the angel to his chair.  He turned away to light the candles to hide the building anxiety.  “I haven’t
CHARLIE: There is an email from you with several attachments.  They look like pictures.  Are they       pictures Dean?
“I must apologize for my actions,” Gilda started the moment they stepped into the room.  “I had lost control and I am grateful that you didn’t slay me like the beast I was.”  She squeezed Charlie’s hand.  “I cannot thank you enough for your help.  Things would have gone badly if you had not intervened.”
He continued to let his mind wander over this while he set about digging where Benjamin had pointed.  The lone mace wielding man kept appearing and going through the motions of attacking, but was alone now.  It was surreal to watch.  He ignored it as best he could.  It helped that he didn’t have the best tools for digging, just a small spade that Benny had always insisted he pack and his belt knife.  Focusing on the digging helped block out the man swinging a mace over his head.
“Not even ghosts really,” Rowena said.  “More like shadows.  Spirits of the long dead.  They fight the same battles, die the same deaths and then do it all over again.”
Castiel looked over to see Gabe and Lady Gilda watching him and the hopping birds.  “Mostly ‘bread’ over and over again.  There’s some bashing of the birds who aren’t here and how stupid they are.  But it’s mostly just ‘bread’.”
“But you did it for me,” Dean said quietly.  “None of this would have happened if it weren’t for me.”
Castiel stood on in the door and watched his brother for a moment.  Lucifer was facing away from him and leaning on the railing.  Castiel guessed he was watching a large bird fly away.
“I like that title,” Dean said.  He pulled Castiel into a hug, though not too tightly, he hadn’t had a chance to change and hugging against armour wasn’t comfortable.
“Did you hire some new help?”  Dean asked.  He gave the description of the man he’d tossed aside a few minutes before.
The darkened space inside the archway rolled in on itself and Dean was suddenly felt a blast of heat.  There was a large room made of stone on the other side of the archway.  He heard the clanging of metal against metal.
“Why would the faeries take Jack,” Cas asked.  He clutched Dean’s arm painfully tight.  “Did she come and take him?  Why?”
“Mother is going to be very angry when she gets to the Summer Court,” Gilda said.  “Zachariah is pulling some of her kingdom into this world.  He’s warping the area around Bender’s castle to be more like the Faerie Lands.”
Castiel stood and walked over to where Dean was muttering over a piece of armour.  It was pinched between his thighs and he grunted as he pulled on the leather.  Castiel thought it might cover the lower leg, but it might have just as easily protected the arms.  He would leave the armour to the specialist.
Dean bit back a laugh when the statement was punctuated with air quotes.  “Well, let’s go see what our werewolves thought was so important to lock up in an abandoned cabin and leave it all alone.”
Charlie found Castiel during the celebration held after the ceremony.  She had a flustered looking Dean in tow.  He smiled when he saw Dean, he couldn’t help himself.
When he had first met Rowena Castiel had been willing to accept whatever deal she made to save Dean’s life.  He hadn’t questioned the specifics at the time and promised to do what she asked.  He hadn’t questioned the specifics over the last few days either.  Dean had alternated between being near death from his injuries or being near death with his injuries and delirium.  There had been brief moments of lucidity, or at least cooperation, when they could feed the man some water and thin broths.  Most of the time Dean had been unconscious or else screaming about things only he could see.  All Castiel could do was sit nearby and hope for a moment of lucidity.  They had not been frequent enough.
“You boys are right on time,” she said.  “Have a seat.  I have to be heading on soon if I want to be able to see my granddaughter.”
Dean didn’t look up when he asked his next question.  “Do you have any other siblings?”  He moved his pawn to the edge of the board.  “I’ll take another queen.”
Missouri had told them that their journey was going to slow down.  It was vague enough at the time, but Castiel wondered if this is what the seer had meant.  He didn’t voice his question though. Dean was already focusing on the areas of the map that Rowena was pointing to.  If he said anything Dean might notice that there was a lot of green between where they were and where the elven ruins were.  He might ask how they covered several hundred miles while he was dying.  He might even ask why the trees across the road were shaved as if by a giant sword or about the deep footsteps leading from those trees to Rowena’s gate and back.
“Face value,” Lucifer told him.  “Your husband loves you.  And I don’t think it will be threats of harm that will keep him in line.  I think he’ll do that all by himself.”
Castiel’s head was pounding and his entire being was wracked with pain.  The ropes kept him bound inside the circle.  He blinked the blood from his eyes and could make out the dimly glowing symbols painted along the rope.  They were enchanted against angels.  He wouldn’t be able to break them.  And even if he could that circle kept him pinned inside.  He pushed against the pain and looked around.  He was in a room without windows and only one door.  There wasn’t anyone or anything else in the room with him.
“You’re Michael right?”  Dean was stalling.  He knew it and the other man had to know it.  He needed a plan and nothing was coming to mind.
“Today,” Dean said.  He turned to Gilda.  “We think your mother might have something to do with it.”
A horse sized piece of rubble from the wall crashed down to his left and went bouncing through the line of attackers.  A few managed to get out of the way, but several of them were crushed.  Without really thinking about it he threw up a magical shield.  It went up in time to deflect several more chunks of the wall.  He felt the spell shudder each time the rocks connected.
“Good.”  Kevin turned to step away.  “Claire will be so disappointed you didn’t run.  She was hoping to start a wild hunt on you.”
“New drapes?” Dean asked, tilting his head. “But these are fine.” He shrugged. He didn’t really care about curtains, as long as they didn’t wake him up before he needed to be, he was fine with any.
Rolfe chuckled softly and set a hand on top of hers, “Well, you’re such a baby!” That, definitely not something a girl wants to hear from someone they like.
Castiel nodded, grumbling, “Yes, you can help it!” The Germans were gonna take over Austria if no one did anything. And that’s what he hated, no one was really doing anything about it. It disgusted him. “You must help it.”
Kurt and Jack jumped to the top stairs, Krissy and Claire jumping to the bottom one. Dean stepped up one as they sang. “So Do.”
Castiel’s eyes widened as he watched them then opened the gate, “Come out of that water at once!” He yelled at his children. They were still laughing and having fun though, Claire helped Gretl since she couldn’t swim yet. Mick rushed to be by Castiel.
“You will see to it that they conduct themselves at all times with the utmost orderliness and decorum.” Novak went on as if he didn’t even hear Dean. “I’m placing you in command.”
Gabe looked at Mick and nodded at him, “You needed a chaperone, and I needed a place to stay where the cuisine is superb, the wine cellar unexcelled and the price, uh, perfect.” And by perfect, he meant free. He loved free things.
The other man pursed his lips as he thought, “They’re good.” He observed. “Very good.” Gabe sighed as he looked at the others in the car. “I must explore this new territory in the next few days. Somewhere, a hungry little singing group is waiting for Gabriel Novak to pluck it out of obscurity and make it famous at the Salzburg Folk Festival.”
Dean’s eyes widened, becoming angry for a moment. Now, he was definitely not a damn dog. “No, sir! That will never happen! I am never going to answer to a whistle.” He said, completely disgusted that he would even try that. It would be so humiliating.
Castiel pursed his lips before he said to his children, “Don’t go away.” He walked to follow Dean. “Winchester. I… behaved badly.” He felt suddenly nervous as he talked to him. “I apologize.”
Dean smiled, ruffling Marta’s hair as he told them, “Now, put it all together.” They all started to sing together, “So Do La Fa Mi Do Re So Do La Ti Do Re Do.” Dean smiled back at the kids as he sat down on a bench. “Good!”
He ran about, twirling even. Dean wasn’t sure why, but he started to sing, he couldn’t stop it. Or that’s at least how he felt about it. “The hills are alive, with the sound of music.” Dean sang, a smile on his face as he walked about, his trousers were a bit dirty, but he barely cared. “With songs they have sung, for a thousand years. The hills fill my heart with the sound of music.” He stopped to admire the mountains once more, smiling as he pushed a hand through his brunette hair.
“Yes, I am.” Dean replied quickly, nodding earnestly. He didn’t want to be kicked out of somewhere that he felt at home, at least, not again.
Castiel realized, “Ah! You mean me. I’m exciting.” He really didn’t think he was that exciting but if Mick did, he guessed he was.
Castiel looked up at him with mild adoration in his eyes. “You brought music back into the house. I’d forgotten.” How great it sounded from how good it felt to listen to it.
“Well, I’ll see that you get some material. Sooner rather than later.” Novak said with a thin smile. “Now, Mr....” He looked back at him.
Dean nodded back at Novak and bit his cheek. “Yes, Captain.” He watched as the Captain closed the doors to the ballroom. He sighed as he did so, longing to dance with a willing partner. “You don’t look at all like a sea captain, sir.” Dean admitted with a small smile, internally laughing.
“Children cannot do the things they’re supposed to do if they have to worry about spoiling their precious clothes.” Dean argued back at Castiel, turning to him. NOw this was making him angry. They were children for crying out loud! They should be able to act like it!
The nuns sang all together again, “Many a thing you know you’d like to tell him. Many a thing he ought to understand.”
“Good evening, children.” Dean said to them, looking at his seat before he sat down. He discreetly took the pinecone off his seat, looking to the children again.
“Yes, of course. I’ve missed you, Krissy.” Rolfe said quickly, grabbing her hands again. He never wanted her to doubt him in any way. But he had a few doubts himself.
“I shouldn’t be saying this -- not to you,” Frau said as if it was a secret that she needed to keep to herself. This should be good then. “I mean, I don’t know you that well,” I am very charming, thank you. “But if you ask me, the Captain’s thinking very seriously of marrying the man before the summer’s over.” Wait…. The Captain likes women and men? Did not see that coming….
Now they were going through a tunnel with vines and roses all along the outside, the sun peeking through. “Me, a name I call myself.” Dean was having fun, himself. This is probably the most fun he’s had since he joined the abbey. “Far, a long, long way to run.” They now ran through the tunnel, laughing happily.
Gabe looked at Mick and rolled his eyes, “Yesterday, Sascha Petrie stole them first.” He kept eating his strudel angrily. More frustrated than angry though. “If there’s one thing I hate, it’s a thief.”
“He could throw a whirling dervish out of whirl.” Another sister said. They were all basically testifying against or for Dean.
Dean went to close the windows, sighing. That thunder was so loud. He was in his sleep clothes, it wasn’t anything that special. A big white button up with matching sleep trousers.
“How many clothes does a governess like you need?” Frau asked him, cocking her eyebrow as a window banged against it’s hinges.
Dean started to walk on the path, his eyes soft. “I’ve always longed for adventure, to do the things I’ve never dared. Now here I’m facing adventure....” He looked over at the city, his eyes admiring the little house on the hill. “Then why am I so scared?” Dean almost whispered. He loved the idea of adventure, to do things he’s never done before. It’d be so exciting!
He wondered what it'd be like for a moment, especially with that Captain. What would the children look like? How old would they be? How would the Captain look like? Would he be nice? Dean hoped he would. Not that he couldn't handle that though, he handled Sister April pretty nicely every single day.
Krissy let go of his hands and frowned, “Isn’t this why you’re here? Waiting for me?” Rolfe, or boys in general, were so confusing at times.
Dean hummed for a moment before he looked at the window Krissy climbed up to get to. “How in the hell did you climb up here?” He asked as he looked out the window. For a nun, he had quite the potty mouth on him.
The Captain sighed and looked at Marta. “It just so happens, Marta, that you are going to see the Baron. I’m bringing him back with me to visit us all.” Well, maybe then Dean would find out who that man is to the Captain. See, Dean was always a curious person but he wasn’t sure he wanted to straight up ask the Captain about this.
“A needle pulling thread!” The kids sang after he did. “La, a note to follow sew. Tea, a drink with jam and bread. That will bring us back to Do.”
Then the group went to the mountains, skipping along by a riverside. They went on a train to get to mountains safely, the kids waving at one of the conductors. They all ran through flowers to get to a nice spot for their picnic.
“Make that an uneven three.” Gabriel said as he grabbed another one and put it on his plate. The maid chuckled again and nodded before she left to put the tray away. Castiel and Mick stepped up onto the stone porch with Gabriel.
“I know. I don’t worry about him, but I do worry about his daughter.” Rolfe said with a gentle smile, rubbing Krissy’s shoulder.
Frau looked Dean up and down and smirked for a moment. “Yes. Well, Goodnight.” She left now, Dean closing the door to his room.
Dean watched them with a gentle look in his eyes before he looked down at his hands and sighed. Perhaps he argued with Cas a little too hard. Gretl then gave some white flowers to Mick, smiling at him.
Dean’s eyebrows furrowed before he looked at the Captain and smiled at him. “Well, I find it very unlikely they’ve had a male governess before. And especially one like me.” He said confidently.
Dean nodded, pursing his lips a little. “Of course I do, Mother, but seven children? They must be a handful...” He explained with a shrug.
Frau sighed then looked at Dean. “Ah, well…. How do you like your room?” She asked him softly. “There’ll be new drapes at the windows.”
“Now, when I want you, this is what you’ll hear.” The Captain started to blow on the whistle again to demonstrate.
“Why would he want to see you?” Kurt retorted back at his sister. Suspicion complete. Dean was right in saying the Baron was a man, but why is he so important to the Captain?
Krissy held her hands together in front of her, “I am sixteen goin on seventeen, innocent as a rose.” She twirled then sat on a bench inside the bungalow. “Bachelor dandies, drinkers of brandies, what do I know of those?” She shrugged innocently.
Lucifer checked his work carefully.  The symbols had been etched into the dirt around the circle he’d drawn.  He had cast this summoning ritual before, but it wasn’t one he was every careless with.  Carelessness was a good way to end up dead when it came to demons.
He let Cas take the lead with his brother and just stayed by the horses while the two men talked.  He couldn’t hear much of what they were saying.  Not that he was trying, that would have been rude.  He was sure that Cas would tell him anything he needed to know.
“Won’t work,” Michael said.  “Bogarts induce madness.  Just a few of them could turn an entire army on itself.”
“I can’t speak to his skill in combat, but he has the intelligence to not immediately race into battle with an unknown foe.”  Michael pulled a large chair over and flopped down into it.  “He was obviously stalling, but it showed intelligence.  Most of the idiots I fight charge head long into whatever trap I’ve set.  I think this one would see the trap.  A fast learner too.  He turned away from my exit.”
“Your after hunt pie.  The whole point of the hunt was to replace the pie that Crowley stole from you.”
Billie shook her head and continued in the calm way she always did.  “Limited time travel Sam.  It’s a cursed item, they always have a catch.  The hourglass will send you back to the moment of your birth and you can live forward from that moment.  You know everything you knew when you went back, but you can’t change anything.  Trying to change anything and the hourglass destroys you.  Castiel has gone back in time, but he can’t stop your brother’s death.  And he knows it.”
The other Dean scoffed.  “You get over yourself.  You let them have what they need, not what you want for them.   And you actually let yourself have what you want.”
He laughed to himself and considered his options.  The Princes stood off to one side chatting like they were guests at a garden party.  He needed to call another if this was going to work.  He had failed his father by not finding a cure. He had failed his brothers by not saving their father.  He was not going to fail his brother.  He would do his part and bring down that wall.  He couldn’t give Castiel his father back, but he could give his brother his son.
Cas flicked his gaze between the ring and Dean’s face.  “I am confused Dean.  I thought we were already a couple.”
CHARLIE: I’ve helped you.  We’ve all helped you.  You picked a ring already Dean.  Use it.  Cas will love it.
“I’ll do it,” Cas said before Dean could interject.  “Send the spell and supplies.  I’ll cast the spell.”
“Oh you are good,” Gabriel said.  He pushed Dean to one side.  “I almost believed you.”  His brother in-law snapped his fingers.  “But our full party isn’t here yet.”
The water calmed and he bobbed gently.  Whatever had happened seemed to have stopped.  Though he thought he could hear gently sobbing.  It seemed to come from all directions.  He wasn’t even sure it was coming from any place at all, it might just be echoing in his head.
Dean started to eat his pizza with delight. “So, are you still down for Thursday night?” he asked after swallowing his first mouthful.
After they finished eating and put everything back in Dean’s bag, they resumed their walk. They arrived at the parking lot by the end of the afternoon, around 5 p.m.
However, when Castiel found himself alone at home in the evening, every bad feeling he had had came back to him. He wanted to text Dean, to ask him to come over but another part of himself was still mad at him and told him that it was a bad idea. Dean couldn’t be trusted anymore and might hurt Castiel again even more in the future. The best thing was to move on now, now that nothing had happened between them, to forget that he had feelings for him – those would go away with time. But he couldn’t think about anything else and that was starting to get on his nerves. He picked up his phone and started to write a text, then pressed “send”. Less than half an hour after someone was knocking on his door.
“You can’t, Dean. It’s not right.” His tender lips had just contradicted his eyes and this light golden glow that Dean swore he could touch.
“I think I saw one for you.” Dean said softly to her, making a sign towards a young woman drinking at the bar.
For a dozen of hours, Dean had been dreading to come home, knowing that he would find himself alone with his phone and thus compelled to answer Charlie’s text which he had been carefully ignoring throughout the day. And he knew that with every minute passing by Charlie was getting more and more pissed at him. He collapsed in his sofa, exhausted, opened their conversation on his phone and chose to do what he did best: be in denial.
“No, I’m fine. I just live nearby and I come here pretty often. I even got the cinema card, in case you wanna check.”
“Oh, I hadn’t seen them.” He looked down. “There, this one will be fine” he added, picking a lighter as blue as his eyes. But definitely, the man didn’t seem like someone who smoked, Dean thought. He looked like an overworked lawyer, or maybe a producer, he couldn’t make up his mind. He was wearing a long pale trench coat and had dark messy hair (which tipped the scale in favor of the producer hypothesis). He had a serious expression on his face, as if he was really focusing on each and everything he did, or constantly got lost in his thoughts. He paid for the cigarettes and for the lighter, thanked Dean and went away.
“Oh, I do. I love them. Did Dean tell you that? I’m already impressed that you know my name. He usually doesn’t share such details from his personal life so easily.” she declared, teasing him as she always did.
He handed her a fresh bottle, opened it up for her and took one for himself. Yes he was on shift but yes he was the boss and it was his birthday. None of the customers would care anyway, he was just overruling one of his personal principles and no one would hold it against him if not the opposite.
They spent the night together and didn’t sleep much. Dean thought she was beautiful and it seemed that she found him handsome as well.
Dean didn’t mind the rain either. The cold drops of water only made Castiel’s lips feel warmer. His heart was pounding under his ribcage. He hadn’t expected Castiel to be so tender, so considerate and so surprising; he craved more of him. And now he was kissing him under the rain and he thought that if he only could put some old rock on the Impala radio they would be in a perfect scene of some old sappy movie. But better. He pulled back just a little, panting, not letting go of Castiel who he still held tight in his arms. “Oh Cas…” He rubbed his thumb against his cheek, diving into his wide blue eyes. Castiel looked back at him, patiently, ardently. There were droplets strewed over his face like freckles. “…” Dean was about to say something but paused. “Can I call you sweetheart?” he asked hesitantly, afraid that Castiel wouldn’t like it or laugh at it.
“We have the exclusivity for the new products they come up with. They will organize a special first night here each time they’re launching a project.”
“Please, say something…” he added in mind. He was desperate to get a text, from Hailie, from Castiel, any of them. Or even from Charlie. Someone he could talk to. He didn’t even know if Castiel had been wanting to kiss him as well. Maybe he had just been a drunk douchebag who forces people to kiss them by taking them by surprise. He hated this thought. And maybe Castiel hated him as well now. He couldn’t stay like this, doing nothing and texted Charlie because she was always the best and he needed her help once more.
“Pretty well. I’ve had like four customers, the usual.” he said. There was no music playing – they only put it on in the end of the evening, when people began to be noisy.
Castiel sighed with a little smirk and shook his head. “I don’t even know how you can be so fit when you’re eating like that every day and that you don’t even work out.” he stated.
Dean didn’t smile, he almost imperceptibly stiffened and Castiel thought that he looked pale in the darkness of the room.
“Cheers, partner.” he said, raising his glass and clinking it with Dean’s. “Oh wait, I forgot your papers, they’re in the backroom.” he said, too tired to get up.
They sat down again for dessert who Sam served in tiny plates with little pink flowers painted on them and Dean was sure that he and not Jess had been the one to buy them. A silly smile passed on his lips. “Thanks Sam.”
Something stirred inside of him, telling him that this was all he had ever dreamed of, deeply, even when he had tried so many times to deny it and downplay it all by getting laid as often as he could by the most beautiful girls he could think of: he dreamed of being loved by someone he could share his life with, who would be there to celebrate every moment of joy with him and support him through the tough ones, and for who he’d give everything because he would care so much that nothing else would matter. He wasn’t jealous of his little brother, of course. He just ached somehow; and drank some more wine to prevent his mouth from tasting the sour taste of his repressed emotions.
“Well…” He didn’t have time to finish the sentence in his head as a hand was laid down on his shoulder. He turned back.
Once it was over, the three of them got out of the cinema, Charlie was talking loud, Hailie was laughing, and Dean was watching them. The girls were still rambling on about the terrible special effects of the movie. Dean had almost not said a word since the movie had started, or since it had ended. He was a few steps behind them, he let them talk, maybe he needed space. He tried to think. To see if seeing Hailie meet his best friend made him happy. But as far as he could tell, it let him numb and indifferent, and kept him wondering whether he was just pushing back his feelings as he often tended to do when it came to relationships, or if he just didn’t care at all. Maybe his inhibition was just playing tricks on him. At least, when he was with girls who weren’t worth it or didn’t appeal to him, it was easier to figure out: he just never presented them to Charlie, didn’t even feel like it. But this whole situation appeared a little more complicated than it should have been.
Castiel stood up. “How about I take you home with me instead?” he asked seriously, matching Dean’s eager energy. But Dean grabbed him and pulled him tight against him and kissed him hard, pressing him against the counter, the red lights on their skins. There was nobody left to watch. Nobody left to hinder them to have each other. Dean’s hair was getting messier as Castiel ran his fingers through it while Castiel’s shirt felt lighter on his skin since Dean let his hands wander wherever they wanted. Castiel took advantage of Dean’s moment of weakness to make them swap places and have him pressed against the counter instead, and he began to kiss his neck, which drew a whimper from Dean. Then he pulled back, leaving Dean confused and frowning.
“But I was told I’d see the elves.  I’ve always wanted to see elves.” Dean began riding Baby inside.  “Ever since I was a little kid.  Bobby told me stories about them.  Said they were good peoples.”
The creature placed the sack down and opened it.  It reached inside and rummaged around for a moment before pulling out a slender volume that it held out to Castiel.  He knew it was a grimoire, but it looked like it should contain poetry instead of spells.  He accepted the book, being careful not to make contact with the creature’s skin.  He wasn’t sure what type of demon it was, but it was definitely demonic.
A flash of green light caught his attention.  Cas was peeking around the doorway and looking at the staff glowing staff in his hand.  The light was already fading, but Dean wasn’t the only one that had noticed it.  The dragon had turned away from Dean and was staring at Cas.  The wizard hadn’t realized he’d been spotted yet.
Sam glanced at the necklace and blinked.  He looked at Castiel expectantly.  “It’s a necklace?  I’m not sure what the problem is.”
The kelpie bucked and threw him off.  Dean landed in the mud and rolled to avoid the attack he expected.
They rode along for another hour before Castiel spotted the hound.  He pulled his horse up and pointed it out to Dean.
Dean stood by and smiled at his son in his arms.  He was wearing his formal attire as Charlie’s champion.  His armour was polished, but mostly hidden beneath a green surcoat with Charlie’s crest embroidered onto it.  Jack was dressed in an identical, though much smaller, outfit.  He had just passed his first year and anyone who saw him fell in love.  At least Dean thought they did.  He didn’t care if they didn’t.  His son was the best.
A neighbouring knight had looked to expand his lands.  He had moved the land markers far enough into Winchester land that an entire village had suddenly moved to the other knight’s territory.  When the villagers protested many of them had been killed.  A young girl had managed to slip away and came to Dean’s father to beg for help.  John Winchester had been a great knight in the past, but by the time that girl arrived he was a drunken wreck.  He could barely stand.  It fell to Dean to fulfil the obligations to the people.
Sam has started to watch Dean, keeping a worried eye on him constantly, checking in with him way too often, and Dean isn't naïve. He knows what it's about. Sam is afraid he's going to lose it, and if he's being honest, Dean doesn't exactly disagree with that assessment. His whole being feels like it's been smothered in guilt and loss and grief, and it's only getting harder to breathe.
Dean is gazing at the ceiling now, as if Cas could hear him somehow. He's praying, more desperately than he ever has, except maybe in Purgatory. He halfway expects to hear that familiar rustle of invisible feathers behind him, feel the breeze that carried the scent of Castiel, a scent that doesn’t exist now.
Cas doesn't speak. Instead, he carefully lifts one unsteady hand to Dean's face, his thumb brushing over Dean's lips, leaving unbroken skin behind with that familiar, brief golden glow.
Castiel doesn’t sit outside Dean's door anymore. That domino already fell. Now, he comes in, around the same time every night, and perches on Dean's bed to watch over him.
Dean takes Cas out for a drive. It's the best way he can think of to spend their last few hours. He drives in silence for the first 4 or 5 before he calls up Cas. The true scope of this finality hasn't fully registered in Dean's mind yet; he's still riding on denial and avoidance, but he can feel it there. At the edges, hovering in the periphery of his awareness, Dean can feel the dread where it lies in waiting. Waiting until he's off guard, powerless and truly alone, before it comes plummeting down on him, breaking his will and his heart and everything he has left to believe in.
Recurring nightmares steal away what little sleep he tries to get. Night after night he jolts awake, panicked and trembling, unable to fall back asleep for fear he's going to watch Cas die again, see the Devil's smug fucking grin, see his mom being dragged to another world.
Cas has been quiet for a while. Now the sunset's fire has smoldered down to soft gray ashes, and Dean hears him sigh again.
It was a sulking Dean that gave him the idea.  The man was in a funk because it was raining too hard to go out for another grocery run.  He wasn’t sulking for the lack of groceries.  Dean was sulking because he’d dropped one of the bags.  Specifically the bag holding the pie he had bought.  It rolled off the table and splattered on the floor.  It wasn’t salvageable.  Dean was miserable for the rest of the night and made sure that his mood spread out to both Sam and Castiel.  It was unpleasant, but it did provide him with he solution he was looking for.  He would make Dean a pie.
“I am not sure,” the dwarf admitted.  “This has never happened before.  I can only promise more mortals will not be affected by it.”
Castiel ran out through the hall and into the clearing.  The moon was just peeking over the trees.  He could hear the nighttime forest coming to life.  Despite what people though the forest was as much alive during the night as it was during the day.  There were creatures he could ask for help.
She started to laugh.  “Oh, I wouldn’t want to ruin the surprise.  You boys are going to be mad about that.”  She returned to the stones to her pouch.  “Just do what comes natural to you Winchester.  I’m not worried about you if you keep your shield at hand.”
Dean darted in to slash at the dragon exposed neck.  The blade slide along the scales without penetrating and doing any damage.  There was a snort from the dragon and it pulled away from him.  A large leathery wing obscured his vision for a moment.  He stabbed into the tight membrane of the wing and felt his blade cut through.  There was no blood at all, but it might keep the dragon from becoming airborne again and just roasting him when its fire had built up again.
“Well, Cas took the tray and put a little on his plate.  It was weird, angel’s don’t eat.  Than he passed the tray away from Dean.  The long way around the table.  And Dean didn’t say a damn thing.  Just watched it go around the table with puppy dog eyes.  Funniest thing I’d seen in ages.  If I hadn’t been so shocked I’d have laughed.  The tray was almost entirely gone before Cas gave Dean the plate he’d set aside.  That’s when I knew.  I’m positive the only force on earth that would separate Dean Winchester from bacon would be love.”
Getting out of his blankets took more effort than he’d have liked.  He was tired.  Both physically and emotionally.  Manifesting his staff had taken a lot out of him and it would take time to recover. The spell he’d cast also took its toll.  On top of that was the emotional rollercoaster of dealing with his brother.  He needed another nap and he just got up.
Even during the early afternoon the hall was dark.  Castiel felt a touch foolish holding the spoon aloft to cast enough light to see clearly.  He regrated enchanting it, but it was practical if silly.  There was no point in enchanting something else to shed light when the spoon still worked.
Lilith watched him go before turning back to the table.  “Keep planning.  Give me three days and I’ll get you your damned army.”  She turned and strode away.
After it was done four men had been killed and the rest scattered.  Dean had slain one of those men.  When the adrenaline wore off he started to feel the weight of his actions and began to shake.  It was Bobby who took him aside.
“Or you could talk to his daughter Barb.  It’ll be hard on her, she and Simon were as close as a daughter and father could be.”  Chester pointed down the street.  “She works the desk at the clinic.  Doc. Harris finally got her to go home this morning.  She’s as stubborn as her father was.  Lives on the edge of town.”  Chester gave them directions and told them that Barb should be home now.
“Good.”  Luke took a deep breath and slashed the palm of his hand with a nail sticking out of the chair leg.  He tossed it aside and smeared the blood on his hands.  The spell he cast spent tiny motes of green light into the air around Cas.  They hovered until Luke clapped his hands together and pressed them down onto Cas’ blood soaked shirt.  The lights danced along his skin and winked out.
“I mean it Dean,” Sam told him.  “This is the last time.  No more questions about rings or I am going to stab you.”
“I’ve worked in a few remote locations where I was sort of all there was for medical care.  Also worked with a few doctors who liked to teach and a few who didn’t want to do anything.  Picked up a few things here and there.  But I’d appreciate it if you don’t mention any of this to my licensing body though.”
Barb shook her head and walked over to one of the shelves and took down a pair of headphones.  She handed them to Dean and gestured to him to put them on.  He slid them on and the world went silent.  He watched her take an old jacket from behind the door.  She walked over to the table and pointed at the bronze tuning fork.
“You are even more stubborn to reason than I was at your age.”  Naomi exhaled violently.  “Just talk with him.  Let him explain why he did what he did.”
“A few days.  Maybe four,” Dean said.  “It took us two days to get this far, but both of us were riding.  It’ll take longer with me walking.”
A thin vertical line appeared when Cas clapped his hands.  It looked like someone had drawn in the air with silver ink.  The line spread out to the left and right as Cas pulled his hands apart and extended his arms.  Once Cas’ arms were fully extended he spun them in a circle.  The line responded but spinning around like a wheel leaving a large silver disc suspended just above the ground.  Cas waved his hand over and the silver faded away to show Rowena’s cottage and her yard.
Jessica narrowed her eyes in fond annoyance.  Apparently she was going to have to ask what Dean was planning on wearing in the morning before settling Jack to bed.  It would save on laundry.
It took time, but he found her.  After all, Heaven is a big place.  Her soul looked like her laugh sounded.  Helen was still Helen.
Cas gave him a hug and Dean felt a little better about the situation.  “Guess we’ll just have to apologize for stabbing her.”
Rowena had agreed to let the horses graze in the part of the yard that didn’t have a garden attached to it, but had lectured both at lengths about eating from the garden.  Castiel had offered to translate for her, but she had waved him off.  Apparently she hadn’t wanted him to down play her threats.  She had explained to them in frank detail what would happen if so much as the top of a carrot was missing.  Both horses seemed to have taken the warnings to heart and had carefully avoided the garden’s edges.  It had been tense at first, but the witch had agreed to let them have whatever apples fell to the ground.  She had then referred them to her earlier threats if they decided to knock apples to the ground to get more.
“Not quite perfect,” the dwarf said.  “But no mortal could create that ring.  While he wears that ring, you will always be with your beloved.  So long as your heart beats in your chest your beloved will feel it.  You will be with him wherever he goes.”
Dean snatched up the fork and tucked into the pie.  “Best way to start the day is with pie.  Besides I earned this pie.  It’s post-hunt pie.  The best kind.”  He grinned happily to himself as he took another bite.
Once he had received the approval to travel, they began making plans to leave the following morning.  Clothes were washed, dried and put away.  Saddle bags were checked and packed.  Castiel couldn’t find the spoon for his meal kit, but thought he could do without it.  The meal bag never made anything hot anyway.
Princess Charlene hadn’t moved from where they’d left her a few minutes before.  The only change that Dean could see was that she had torn her dress to make a bandage to press against Gilda’s side.  He doubted the safety of using such dirty cloth for the task, but there weren’t a lot of options.
Castiel sighed and rolled his eyes.  “Fine.”  He took the potion and knocked it back.  It tasted like a custard with a hint of cinnamon.  He was impressed.  He’d tasted potions that tasted like a burning building before.  “Happy?”
Lilith’s army didn’t need that.  It just marched forward.  When an enemy came within reach it was stabbed at by spears of swords.  Arrows rained down among the combatants, striking friend and foe alike.  The dead didn’t care whether they were struck by arrows or not, but the bogarts did.  The creatures were pushed back.  No matter how many skeletons they struck down there were always more to take their place.  Lilith kept fielding even more soldiers.  Thousands had already marched down to the castle, but there were always more coming from the fog.  The tide seemed endless.
The worried look crossed Cas’ face again.  Dean didn’t like it.  He decided not to bother Cas for any more water.  He had other things to worry about than getting Dean a drink.
“Gosh Cas you gotta stop being the perfect boyfriend, we’ve only be together for like a day and I’m already getting way more used to being spoiled than I should…” Dean chuckled.
It was actually good, though much different than what he expected. The actress he liked had had a role jarring with what she usually played, and oddly enough it suited her very well. He didn’t think she would have been that comfortable with playing a villain since she had more or less always been the pretty girl, or the adventurous one, who always wins in the end, or meets the perfect guy.
“Tell me, what did you bring us to eat?” he asked, “I hope that everything is homemade.” He joked. But for the few times that Dean had invited him over and cooked for him – that is to say that he had invited him plenty of times at his home but that they usually ordered takeaway – he could say that Dean was rather a good cook.
“Was I? Good for me then. I was worried that you were someone who I had met before and couldn’t even remember.” he replied with a laugh. “So, did you follow me here? Are you a dangerous stalker? Should I call the police?” he kidded, as he didn’t really know what to say in this particular situation or what she wanted from him.
“Mountain.” It was more challenging in a way, since you had to go up while the river path was flat, and it was quiet, the sound of the stream wasn’t there to disturb your thoughts, but if you listened carefully enough you could hear it chant in the distance.
“But I lied to you. On purpose. To hurt you. Because I was mad and –… I promise to never to this again.”
He was about to end his shift – his colleague was to arrive in a few minutes –, when a man came in. “Hum, hello. I would like to purchase some cigarettes.” Dean thought that he had a peculiar way of speaking. And assumed that he must have been smoking for a long time given the depth of his voice.
Dean seemed even more puzzled and sighed. He sat down and opened his computers, taking his time to answer thoroughly to each of his mails – a thing he really wasn’t used to doing. Charlie was usually the one handling the written exchanges with the clients or with their associates. Dean had tried to do his part before but he was so engulfed in the other tasks that he had to perform for the brewery – and that he liked better – that he used to often forgetting to answer in time to some important e-mails. He wasn’t doing that on purpose. That was just how things were. They had therefore settled things as follow: Charlie would be the one answering all the e-mails – that gave her the opportunity to work from home and thus spend more time with her girlfriend which was a benefit for her – while he would be the one to welcome everybody and show them around the brewery when they would come to visit it. That was something he liked doing – he was proud of the brewery and it was every time a pleasure  for him to see people’s admiratives look while he walked them through the different rooms.
They spent the day in their sweatpants, chilling, kissing, eating snacks and rambling over and over again about how they had felt about each other from the beginning, how their feelings had evolved, how Dean had been so desperate to know if his love was requited as to follow Castiel in the night the evening of the brewery party, and they laughed about it.
The first days after the argument were tough on him, but he gradually got accustomed not to see Dean anymore. But he couldn’t prevent his heart from rushing whenever someone opened the door late at night just before the closing, hoping that it would be him – of course, it never was. Everything seemed to fade; Castiel was becoming calmer; his life slowly transformed into a bland version of itself with dull colors and joys.
As he drove back home, he knew that he wouldn’t talk about it to Charlie although he couldn’t exactly tell why. It was just a weird feeling that he couldn’t shake off. He just couldn’t talk about it; not yet. It was too weird. She was gonna ask to many questions that he wouldn’t be able to answer, which would just make him more confused. One subject at a time. And for now, the subject was Hailie.
“Come here you’re not working anymore tonight. I got you.” Dean said. He slipped behind the counter and wrapped his arms around Cas for a little while.
Dean smiled. The lights weren’t the only reason why his cheeks were red, the alcohol he had drank had something to do with it as well, it was getting to his head. “Cas I - …” he said, and without thinking about it, he put his hand on top of Castiel’s which was lying on the table. He didn’t finish his sentence and looked up at him. Castiel straightened up and his face came a bit closer to Dean’s.
“No, no, I’d be happy to see you.” Dean hastened to say. “Come over. I’ll go check in the fridge if I have some beers left.”
The door closed behind him and he walked in a light step to the Impala. He settled in his seat ready to go home when a bad feeling washed over him. The phone in his pocket was getting heavier, trying to remind him of its presence, letting him know that the short period of time he had been allowed to forget about it and his text messages was over. He reluctantly took it out and turned it on.
“Cas, we have a room set aside for spells,” Sam jumped in.  “You should practice in there.  Not,” he gestured around the kitchen, “where we make our food.”
The woman was walking forward faster than the dragon was retreating.  She walked right up to the beast.
“It’s a beautiful morning to be summoning fiends,” Lucifer said dryly.  “I’ll take that wall down.  Don’t worry about that.  And don’t worry about the bogarts either.  Lilith will keep her word.  She’s almost here.”  Lucifer pointed to a dark fog bank that was building on the western edge of the valley.
Raphael was a very talented healer.  A raging ass-hat, but an amazing healer.  The wizard swooped in at all hours to check in on him.  He didn’t think he was above dressing wounds and performing more menial tasks like assisting Dean to eat in the early days.  You wouldn’t know it form his personality, but Dean found that Raphael was a very caring man.  His treatments worked and Dean did find himself gaining strength day by day.  After his trip to the floor though, he decided that he would wait for permission to engage in more activity.
“Huh?” Dean looked up and smiled and than frowned.  “You’re awake.  Are you okay?  Do you need anything?”
Cas turned the ring over in his hands.  The dwarf said it was perfect, but he knew deep down it wasn't.  Not yet.  It wouldn't be perfect until it Dean wore it.
“All Bobby’s doing,” Dean said.  “He did most of the day to day stuff when my father was still alive, and taught me what I know about it.  But he’s the one that keeps everything going.”
“Thank you,” the youth stammered.  “We would have died out there if that creature hadn’t been killed.”
“I don’t want your money,” Missouri told him as she upended the bag over the table and multiple small black stones fell out.  She turned them all face down and swept them around to mix them up.  “I’ll tell you what I see and then we’ll both go on our ways.  The only cost to any of us is our time.  And it won’t take much of that if you both actually listen.”
He shook his head to clear it and noticed that Lucifer was staring at him.  Dean felt uncomfortable under that gaze.  He didn’t feel like it was a malevolent look, just uncomfortable.  He felt like a kid having gotten caught doing something he shouldn’t.  It was a relief when Lucifer looked away again.
Castiel ignored it and kept trying to stuff his blanket into his bag.  A moment later Dean came back and knocked something against his arm.  He looked down and saw the knight was handing him a small vial.  It was one of the potions Rowena had given them when they’d left.  He looked up questioningly.
Castiel ran around the creature at a distance in case this was a rouse.  When he saw Dean he realized what had happened.  The knight had sunk his sword to the hilt in the creature’s body.  The angle of the sword would have put it through several vital organs.
Dean glanced down at the small box next to the computer.  A simple gold band stared back.  It was a nice enough looking ring.  It was plain and simple.  Like he was.  Nothing fancy.  Didn’t pretend to be anything it wasn’t.  But it wasn’t good enough.  It was a ring that was good enough for Dean, but not for Cas.  Cas deserved better.
“No,” Castiel said.  “I do like it.”  He did like it.  It just made no sense.  “I’m confused.  Why?”
“I did,” Garth said.  “Though it was at the same time.  They said they were going to be married.  They asked directions to Brightwood Abbey.  It’s a few days south.  I gave them direction and sold them one of my dogs for protection.”
Dean began walking back toward the Impala and let his mind drift.  His thoughts wandered toward the ring he still didn’t have for Cas.  Or the design he still didn’t have for the ring for Cas.  He had tried finding inspiration during the hike, but nothing had really came together for him.  In his frustration he picked up a small rock and threw it at a large rock formation.  The rock connected with a satisfying thud.
“Could get it engraved,” she offered.  “A quote or something special that way.  Or you could find someone to make a ring just for him.  Couldn’t get more unique than that.”
“Fine,” the man grumbled as Dean gave him half the coins.  “You can send whoever you want with the horses, but I suggest your unarmoured friend go first.  You look heavier in all that metal.”
He was so lost in listening to the song that he hadn’t noticed the rain had begun to fall harder.  He was startled into noticing it when he felt himself wrapped in warmth.  Dean’s green cloak settled around him and the knight pulled the hood up before he could react.
“Actually, I can.  I am a grand wizard Cassie.  I outrank you.”  Gabe looked smug.  “Besides, I could always get mother to back me up if I wanted to.  But I’d rather not.  This will good for you.”
He snatched the baby up and retreated inside.  Once the door was closed he took a closer look.  The baby seemed healthy and was somehow asleep, despite having been out in the rain.
The man blanched and finished the contents of the cup in a few gulps.  He made a face at the taste.  The sister pulled some bandages and some sticks to act as a splint.  She set them next to the knight.
“Come human,” the dwarf’s voice rumbled from the other side.  Dean couldn’t see him, but it sounded like the dwarf was off to one side just out of view.  “your ring awaits.”
Castiel carefully drank exactly half of the potion and handed the rest to Dean who upended it and drained the bottle.  It didn’t take long for the potion to take effect.  The fatigue drained away and he felt almost alive again.
Castiel looked down at the field to see the two knights who were currently fighting.  From this distance he couldn’t tell anything about the armour, but one wore a green coat and the other had yellow one.
Gabe returned a few minutes later with a worried look on his face.  “I don’t know if I’m reading it right, but it looks like this Zachariah is in the Faerie Lands and not here.”
“No human, everything does not.”  The dwarf rumbled a sigh.  “I do not belong here in Midgard.  I belong home in my forge.  This realm is killing me.  I wish only to return to Nidavellir.”
Jack fell asleep first, but Dean knew he wasn’t too far behind.  He reached over and pulled Cas in even closer.
“Tired, but better.”  Cas pulled himself into a sitting into position.  “I take it you found the armour.”
“Um, I’m going to go make that coffee now.”  He stood and went to leave.  “It just didn’t seem right to leave him all alone.”
“Fine,” Charlene snapped.  “You can have a royal pardon for all crimes, except murder.  If there is blood on your hand you will hang.”
“I’ll be asking her for protection against the Court when she wakes,” Rowena told them.  She looked at Cas.  “I’ll be expecting you to keep your promise if she refuses.”  The witch turned and walked back toward the cottage.  “Bring her inside and I’ll see what I can do.”
Michael stared at him in silence.  The stare continued long enough that Castiel wanted to turn away.  Eventually he did.
“Just a few questions about what’s happened to your father in-law,” Sam explained.  “We saw the papers and thought it was a bit odd that so many people came down with the same symptoms.”
Castiel nudged Dean to one side of the room and then into the hallway.  “So, Champion, eh?”  He liked how Dean smiled and blushed.  “Bit of a promotion from Rescuer Of Soggy Wizards.”
She sighed deeply.  “Father wants me to marry.  He has for some time now.  He keeps bring these just awful knights.”  She looked at Dean.  “Sorry, no offense.”
Things had not gone according to plan.  Dean sighed and stared into the cup in his hands.  He was not a heavy drinker normally.  His father had shown him what could happen when a man was consumed by drink.  Though in his father’s case it was more of a man pouring drink on after being consumed by grief.  Despite what people said, drink had not killed his father.  It was the loss of his mother.  His mother had died 10 years before, shortly after Sam had been born.  A sickness in her lungs took her and she burned up with fever before the healers could even get to her.  His father had never recovered.  Eight years later Dean had to bury his father next to his mother.  After the funeral guests had left Dean had returned to the crypt and changed the date of his father’s death to the same date as his mother’s.
