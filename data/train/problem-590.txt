“The only feature of interest was a very handsome young team captain.”
Sherlock would very much like to devour John in public. John’s inventive streak in the bedroom aside, he’s still a very private man. They’ll probably need to work up to it. He could start by snogging John under the weeping willow by the lake. There’s not many days left until the green leaves will explode and cover the bare black branches of the old majestic tree. Squirrels, still unconcealed by foliage, run hurriedly about the tree trunk.
"Parnate!"  John is sure, given the pink lettering.  "That's an MAOI."
She stares back at him. “What do you mean?”
He puts away some earrings and her wedding ring with the dress. He’s not sure what to do about his own, so it stays on his finger.
“I wanted to stay here, too. But it was easier at home when you weren’t there. Not as much conflict.”
Anything else is lost when a fluffy substance is slathered onto his skin. This massage is like a breeze compared to the harsh scrub. A frothing cloth sweeps over his body, up, down and side to side with long strokes, covering every limb in soft suds.
“I was thinking,” says John reluctantly. “Maybe you could- it’s helped me before so I thought- could you maybe play for her?”
.  Why?  "Miss Cushing, um, Sarah was it?"
“I-I do have a cup of coffee once in a while,” he tries to smooth it over. He scrabbles in his mind. What on earth were they talking about before his silly embarrassment? Hippies, right!
, named after the excellent pea-shooting properties of it's hollow stems.
Why is he afraid of Harry figuring it out, now?
"Seems to be a theme," says Sherlock laconically.
"Of course it's not impossible, but with the code, there's no need anymore."
That settles it.  John acquiesces and they meet in a somewhat unbalanced kiss, where Sherlock is keen and passionate, while John is a bit slow to answer with the same fervour, seemingly dumbstruck by the sudden shift.
He huffs.
Within ten minutes, they're in the back of a warm car, picked up by the manager of Bennet's Bed & Breakfast.
Maybe you could learn something from them.”
“What are you implying? That I’m
Sherlock shrugs. “Could have been interesting, since I lack the experience with women, but there’s only so far you can go.”
She huffs.  "What do you think?  After nearly twenty years in nurseries and preschools?  Of course I have bloody tinnitus, and of course I told you the truth about wearing noise-cancelling headphones at home.  I told you and the officers the truth when I said I don't know what happened to Brian, and that I hope you catch the killer.  How's that going for you?"
John sits down on the bench to strip himself of his jeans.  The lower part of them are still moist from being soaked in seawater, clinging to his calves.
John doesn’t know what to do with that. He chuckles and smiles a bit,
Sherlock gives him a fond smile.  "I found a perfect sample to keep in my pocket."
Sometimes he wonders why she asks these questions she already knows the answer to.
"What's wrong?"  John stops touching him immediately and takes a step back.  "God, Sherlock, sorry.  What did I do wrong?"
"Where are we?" Sherlock scoffs.  John isn't stupid, and not really that drunk anymore.  Sherlock's earlier suspicion has now turned into downright certainty, because John apparently has something up his sleeve.  "We're at the Marina, beneath the cliffs and the A259."
Rosie is unperturbed by the attention. She promptly starts ripping wrapping paper, more interested in the delightful texture and the sound of ripping than her gifts.
She cocks an eyebrow.
Sherlock is bored, sitting with one of the multiple laptops littering the desk, scrolling restlessly when he hears the lock turn downstairs and the sound of John’s unmistakable gait storming up the stairs. He glances at the clock. John should still be at the surgery, but something is apparently out of sorts.
John drags his thumb along the plump flesh. It’s soft and yielding. John is dizzy with tension, anticipation and dread. What if he pushes too far?
“Yeah,” John breathes.
“Amazing!”
"Yes, convenient, isn't it?  It seems she has a blotchy memory."  Sherlock stifles a yawn.  "She said Brian used to muck about in the shed, but there were no traces of such activities, only the lawnmower had been used recently."
Sherlock bores his eyes into John's.  "But
reasonable to not cheat on your wife,” he snaps. “Especially with a newborn baby. I don’t understand why I do such things to those I love. Why I barely manage to reach the minimum expectations.”
"A fall.  I.O.U.  I owe you--it's just words and riddles.  I've never liked riddles."  Sherlock glowers.  "Moriarty said '
Sherlock squints at John, continuing that thought.  "It's always been
Is he trying to convince himself again? Another self-deception? Smoothing things over to cover up his hurt feelings.
. Catherine chose this stone for them both. And look-”
Sherlock flies out of the room, compiling a list of melodies that might appeal to an infant as he goes.
“Internet research. Properly sourced, science based. Don’t worry, it’s not bogus.”
That’s not a word Harry uses lightly. “Stupid of me to assume.”
So Sherlock has to remove the ring, and make a decision about where to put it. He could just drop it on a dresser in John’s room. But then John will see it, and there’s a risk that he will reconsider the symbolic gesture he made earlier.
Miss Cushing's quite delighted to have Sherlock on the case, since she hasn't heard back from them in months.  She's invited them into her small sitting room, serving tea and ginger nuts, which John knows to be Sherlock's favourite biccy.  She sits perched at the end of her seat, in an armchair filled up with several cushions to support her back, hair wispy and soft, like a halo around her head.  She wears both a cardigan and a shawl wrapped around her tiny frame, in spite of the heat--a clear indicator of her advanced age and the concurrent changed metabolism and loss of body fat.
Ella doesn’t press the question further.
"Yeah, it was stored under his bed."
“I can’t take this lightly, Sherlock.”
There’s traditional woven modesty towels intended to be to wrapped around their middle for the treatment sessions.
Ella raises her brows.
Sherlock chuckles, then runs his finger slowly down his own cheek.  "Still smooth."
Rosamund Mary
"Ah.  And Brian seems to have had loads of them."
It had been an evening with several bands on a makeshift stage. The audience danced wildly, the adrenaline high. John had seen the lithe boy on stage. Most singers had been highly energetic, jumping around on the stage, sometimes mixing with the audience. This boy was rather still in comparison. He played the bass and was the lead singer, not straying far away from the mic stand. He had dark hair in an overgrown haircut and a white shirt with a dark tie. The tie was eventually loosened, the shirt soaked through and opened up at the neck, sleeves folded up to reveal strong forearms with rippling muscles. John couldn't look away, he was transfixed.
John swallows, his eyes drop to Sherlock's mouth.  He licks his lips, tilts his head.
They’re nearing the end of a weeklong case.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry snatches up the jug, goes to the window. The windowsill is full of seedlings covered by plastic bottles cut in half. She lifts the bottles one by one, watering the plants.
a lovely man.  It's a shame, really."  She shifts in her seat.
"And then there were the letters, the cardboard box with Miss Cushing's jewellery and finally the beheaded flowers, which not so incidentally grow on the other side of this hedge."
“Then I can hitch a ride with you back to London. I’ve got a class at 7pm.”
“Don’t stay in too long. It’s freezing.”
John doesn’t budge. He’s still standing like a soldier, at attention, provocatively quiet.
When he approaches them again, already playing a longer variation of the wedding waltz, he notices John’s eyes are glossy. He excuses himself with the promise of making tea, and leaves Sherlock and Rosie to themselves.
Of course Sherlock would have figured that out.
“So, how’s Sherlock?” she asks, innocently.
"Yes, that's been proven in a lab test," Sherlock lies effortlessly. "Since you're an amateur at burning things, there was one pickle jar left intact which allowed us to analyse it."
Sherlock sighs deeply.  John expects a snarky remark, so he does what he can to keep the interview going.  "How would you describe the box?"
Would it have made a difference if he’d decided he never wanted Mary back after she shot Sherlock?
“No!” Sherlock glares at him.
"Oh."  John rises, brushing off his knees.  "Right. Gardening tools, white lilies, homemade pickles--I'm sensing a pattern, here."
The pressure has been uneven, so there's not many legible words, mostly traces.
”Sorry for not having the guts to beat you to a bloody pulp and throw you out.”
Suddenly, John can’t stand it, watching Sherlock frozen in his most energetic state. He’s overcome with a sense of being back where they were, years ago, always fighting his impulses to touch Sherlock.
Then Sherlock is forced to say what he doesn’t want to say, because he knows how it will affect John and his continued struggle with guilt.
John has to take a moment to regain his breath.
He huffs and squirms in his seat, and if that doesn’t tell him there’s truth in her words, nothing will.
"Fucking fight me, you coward!" he provokes, shouting into John's face, and there's a small gleam of resistance in John’s eyes, though his body is still.
John mostly doesn’t see the scar on Sherlock’s eyebrow. It’s faded to a thin, almost pearly white, line. He’s kissed it plenty of times, when he occasionally falls back into despair and doubt.
"I can't deny everything, though.  I need to help out with the knotweed."
Never again.
you!”
The next song is familiar. One of those almost symphonic ones. He’s tried it out on his violin many years ago, in one of his rare forays into popular music. It has many dynamics, from soft pizzicato to intense arcos.
Then again, many years in completely different circumstances, deployed and instantly charmed by a superior. Nothing he’d dare to pursue, even if there was a hint of something there, maybe an acknowledgement, maybe even the suggestion of reciprocation.
John and Harry have been clearing out the shed. It was a mess and took a couple of hours work.
This time John thinks the young man is close to being indiscreet, but he realises that it's probably all in his own mind.
He picks her up and sweeps her into a towel. There aren’t enough clean ones. He’s falling behind his washing schedule. Again.
He closes the distance and nudges his thumb at the corner of Sherlock’s mouth, until his lips are slightly parted. Then slowly, he presses his lips to Sherlock’s. Sherlock keens and the sound is like a firework, an ignition, a miracle, an aphrodisiac all in one. John hadn’t expected Sherlock to reciprocate, but when Sherlock opens up his mouth only to lick deep into John’s, he’s hit by a wave of arousal. He feels drunk; there’s a static noise rising in waves in his ears and everything feels languorous.
John gives her a name. The name he’d always wanted her to have, but didn’t have the strength to argue for.
The song Sherlock had played along to is
John smiles, kissing the offered neck and slowly rolling his hips once, twice. Sherlock digs his nails into his back, arching against him. John takes his time, letting Sherlock set a pace and following his movements, and soon they're both panting into each others mouths with each rock of their hips. Surprisingly, Sherlock is the one to request they take off their pants, right now, and John obliges with a laugh. But the sound dies off as soon as he's pushing Sherlock's pants down his legs slowly, every sound coming out of Sherlock's throat making it hard to focus.
Violet keeps the conversation going all through lunch, going from Rosie to the cases to Mrs Hudson’s health. John answers most of the questions, letting Sherlock fills some of the details here and then. Strangely, or not if you believe Sherlock, they don’t ask a single question about them or their relationship. They are delighted when John asks them if they can take care of Rosie this evening, but that is all. No questions about where they are going or what they are going to do. Sherlock casts him a knowing look as they take back the dishes to the kitchen, which John chose to ignore entirely.
John offers him his best smile, nodding.
“I didn’t,” Sherlock replies, actually quite impressed with the fact himself, and leans down to kiss John, quick and smiling.
“I’m sorry,” John laughs this time, feeling more and more stupid about the entire matter. “I just thought you should know that I’m not asking for-”
Sherlock hums lazily, starting to rock into him and when earlier had been too much, he's the one now to moan for more against John's lips. Without stopping their movements, John slides a hand between them and around Sherlock's erection. "Yes," Sherlock pants, shivering. "Yes." John strokes him slowly, feeling himself grow harder each time Sherlock thrusts into his fist. "I want to..." Sherlock says, shifting so he can close one hand around John too.
"I wanted to tell you," Sherlock continues, having no idea how to stop now. "I almost did so many times, but it always felt impossible, it always felt as if it would only make it all... worse."
"But you're mine," Matthew continues, and John lets out a deep breath. "Your lips are mine, your body is mine. Your skin."
"If I agree to eat," Sherlock says, looking smug, "then we go trick or treat afterwards."
“Not at all,” John smiles.
"Not always," John smiles, stroking Sherlock's chest very, very slowly. He circles one nipple, Sherlock's breath catching, before moving away again. He repeats the motion without ever changing the pace, going as slow as he can manage, and by the time Sherlock is moaning every time he brushes one nipple, John is beaming at him.
John smirked against his lips, “You will get more, believe me.” He had decided for himself that he would definitely work up to all four fingers. There was no way he wanted this to hurt even the slightest bit for Sherlock, plus it was a delicious feeling being able to observe the thus for so collected person fall apart. John could see the need and want slowly winning over the marvellous self-control and he couldn’t think about anything else but the fact that he had caused that. Already he knew that any future lover would have to compare directly to Sherlock and he wasn’t so sure anyone could be better.
"Hello Mrs H," John replies, her presence somehow making it easier already.
Soon.
"I..." John begins before shaking his head. "I thought I had something to do here, but turned out I don't."
“I’ve messed up,” John rushes out, eyes roaming all over his face. “Earlier, I did it all wrong. I didn’t mean to sound like a proper jerk, telling you it was only to warm up, to feel better. God, I’m a complete idiot.”
“Seven,” Sherlock corrects.
“I’m not hungry,” Sherlock replies, not having even thought about eating yet.
Don’t worry, I have a
“You chose not to come.”
Sherlock doesn’t reply, the house now in sight, and they walk the rest of way in a somewhat comfortable silence. Toby heads for the garden directly, and John realises he hadn’t closed the gate earlier. Sherlock doesn’t mention it, opening the front door and slipping off his shoes. “You can leave your suitcase here for the moment while I show you around the house.”
John squeezes his hand, smiling softly, "We can't live in the past, not with all we already wasted."
“That’s ri-”
“What if you stop me?” he asks, leaning in until he can feel Sherlock’s breath on his mouth.
think it might be
"Are you saying we should stop? Give up entirely?" John asks once he manages to find his voice again. Sherlock remains silent, staring back at him. Only then does John realise neither of them has bothered to turn on the light, and he wonders just how lost in their own head they must have been. Still are. "You're right," he whispers. "I'm tired, too."
“No,” Sherlock breathes out, feeling naked in every sense of the word.
“I didn’t know you were here,” he finishes, deciding honesty is his only option. John has always been bad at reading between the lines, and if Sherlock can now see it all clearly on
This is the real Sherlock, the one whose mouth doesn't know how to linger against his, whose hands don't know what to hold, whose body doesn't seem to be able to obey anymore. And John falls in love all over again. He raises his other hand to Sherlock's curls, holding him close for another moment before breaking them apart, "Sherlock?" he whispers, but Sherlock's eyes are closed and his hands that are still around his face bring him back for another kiss. John chuckles softly, letting Sherlock tilt his head to the right and deepening the kiss with a tentative stroke of his tongue against John's lower lip. John parts them slowly, searching for Sherlock's tongue and making them both moan again.
“I’m sorry. I’d rather be at home too, but this is how it is. Better make the best out of it.” he shrugged and let Sherlock into the small lift first.
“John,
"He'll follow right behind," Lestrade replies, pulling him away from Horsen. "The sooner we close this case, the better, don't you think?" They remain still for another second, "Go, John."
Sherlock laughs, “I’m fairly sure they won’t be quite as shocked as I still am.”
02:35
"John, are you finished?"
John releases a loud breath, licking his lips. His turn. "One of my most recurrent dreams involved coming home to find you waiting for me, silent and mysterious, and without a word, you would undress me and deduce all the touches and kisses that would drive me insane with desire."
Thank you for all the amazing comments, you are absolutely amazing!
“What about the questions?” John says.
Sherlock's eyes flutter closed for a second, then focus sharply on his again. "You know the way ou-"
"He's busy right now," John replies, smiling back.
“I don’t know what I want,” Sherlock replies after a moment longer. “I thought that was fairly obvious.”
"Alright, let's see. I remember wanting to kiss you a little while after I moved in. You were working on an experiment that involved yelling on the phone at three in the morning. I was trying to sleep, and failing obviously, and I remember thinking I could shut you up with a kiss, and maybe even convince you to sleep if I took you up to my bed and found ways to tire you out."
“Oh no,” Lestrade smiles, “you need to read it for yourself.”
) Then I’ll be happy to read it.
) I was telling the truth, John.
John doesn't have anything to say to that, so he keeps quiet. Somehow, he understand that perfectly. After meeting both of Sherlock's parents and seeing the constant worry in their eyes every time they talked about him. Surely believing he was now part of a family must reassure them.
"About?" Rosie asks, leaning ever closer.
“Yes,” Sherlock replies, not meeting his eyes.
When Sherlock finally manages to put down John’s letter, night has fallen. He casts a quick look at the window, trying to deduce the exact time, and rewards himself with a small smile when he checks the clock. He forces himself not to read John’s words for the thousandth time, having learned them all by heart now, and really, there isn’t much more he can do by simply sitting there, reading.
XX32: I know you don’t. That’s why I’d like to read about your own thoughts on… sex.
“Rosie’s fifteen's birthday,” Sherlock answers.
Sherlock nods, “Yes, and you should know, you stole my pillow as soons as I left the bed.”
Act like they always do. Right. And that's supposed to be simple surely. John can't remember the last time he felt this warm happiness when he wakes up every morning, knowing Rosie is safely sleeping in her cot and listening to Sherlock moving around downstairs. Only to, right after, realise that you're going to spend your day with the man you're desperately in love with without being able to tell or show him so.
John strokes his cheek softly, "Tell me."
“It’s just that- Christ, it’s just that I actually think there is a point when it becomes too late,” Greg sighs, and for just a second, John sees him as he really is:
John watches in awe as Sherlock’s cheeks manage to get even redder, “You’re making it harder with all the blushing, you know.”
Sherlock leans close as the mayor makes his speech, “Really John, forgetting the rings.”
"Is it now?"
thing, and I didn’t. So I failed them, and let my father beat them up until he decided he was better off without us and left, and even then, I wasn’t able to repair the damage he caused. I watched my mom become more and more silent, watched Harry sneak out of the house only to come back drunk. And I continue to fail them, unable to pick up the phone and meet Harry for coffee, unable to even tell Rosie about her aunt, unable to apologize.
“Why don’t we finish that documentary on BBC, “ John offers. “We’ll have time to finish all this later.”
“I didn’t… notice.”
"It's not your fault," John replies, offering her his best smile.
"But why did they leave it here?" John asks, taking his phone out. "Why not get rid of it?"
John takes a step back, looking alarmed all the sudden, glancing at Sherlock for the briefest second. His voice is shaking as he says, “Yes, yes, of course, he chooses.”
Goodnight, John.
Sherlock doesn’t say anything but John doesn’t need him to.
Sherlock nods, "Really."
Thank you for all your nice comments on my previous note <3
"Over there," Lestrade replies, nodding towards a closet. "I didn't know you'd be here," he says, looking at John. "I don't have any for you."
And I know I did. I remember perfectly each birthday, each school celebration, each evening spent laughing over dinner, each walk in the park and late-night crime scene. I had a childhood every kid in the world hopes for, and that is all thanks to them. These two grown men acting like teenagers, hiding their joined hands under a restaurant table in the hopes I won't notice. The wrinkles don't matter, nor the years that put them there. Right now, I only have to look up to know they both haven’t felt this young in decades.
XX32: I... Yes, tomorrow.
“Good, I could need some help.”
John nods, "Sherlock asked me to remain close and wait for his signal, so I waited by the alley before interfering."
No murder weapon on the crime scene.
“I’ll show you your room now,” he declares, taking John’s suitcase on his way, and John choses not to comment on it. They climb the few steps upstairs, Sherlock pointing to the different doors, “Bathroom is here. That’s the guest room, where Rosie sleeps when she visits, and over there is my room.” He stops in front of the last door, “And here’s yours.”
He throws his head back, his entire body arching against John’s as seconds stretch into hours. He vaguely hears John moan louder, move ever faster until he’s crying out his name, coming too. In a sudden flash of lucidity, Sherlock looks back at him, not wanting to miss a second of John’s orgasm. He finds him still looking back, eyes wide and the hand still in his hair tightening. They stare at each other in silence, still panting, still dazzled, and Sherlock loves every second of it.
How could I ever give you what you want if I don’t know what I have to offer?
He finds Sherlock sitting on his bed, having abandoned the suitcase in the middle of the room. John hides a smile, going to sit at the desk and turning to face him. How can a grown up wearing suits and solving crimes can still look so ridiculously adorable sulking.
"But?"
“Sherlock,” John’s voice came from behind him and Sherlock turned around, not used to being interrupted during his deductions, “A little nicer maybe?”
Not in the moment, no.
“Die of boredom?”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Have you researched this?" John asks.
He’s busy. Text me when you’re at the crime scene.
“Toby, let’s go,” he calls, turning to walk back home.
(...)
"Steve Horsen over here wasn't easy to find," Sherlock explains, starting to pace around the alley. "But once Lestrade realised who Horsen was exactly, he made sure I could have everything I need to frame and catch him."
“I should say it now before I lose all sense of speech,” John says, quiet and soft, “I love you, Sherlock Holmes.”
"I know," Lestrade sighs. "You keep reminding me."
“Oh,” John breathes, realising what he’s not saying. “You were…”
"What?"
The rest of dinner is a mixed of cases, quiet laugher and deduction on which disease has the patient who left a stain on John’s shoulder - amazing. By the time Sherlock offers to take care of cleaning everything, John has almost forgotten the whole bed situation. Almost. He spends half of his shower and evening routine wondering if Sherlock will sleep at all tonight, and the other half wondering what he’ll do if he does. The kitchen is empty when John is finished, just as the living room, and when John comes to realise it could only mean Sherlock is already in his bed, air leaves his lungs entirely. He takes the stairs up slowly, each sound of his step echoing with his pounding heart.
“They’re going to ask us questions, Sherlock,” John sighs, rubbing a hand over his face. “They are going to want to know how we got together, won’t they?”
Finally getting his thoughts back in order, John manages to reply with a hoarse voice, "I'm sorry, but you are?"
I need you to do something for me, without questions.
C6nH12nO6n
It takes another long minute before Sherlock finds the courage to reply, heart sinking inside his chest and head spinning with the mere realisation of speaking it all out loud, “I meant everything changed, John. From the way I allowed myself to look at you to the shattering need to have you by my side constantly. What I had failed to understand facing you at Angelo’s, I’ve learned to analyse and accept over the years.”
“I’ve taken an extra day at the clinic,” he explains. “I’ll be back around seven.”
Sherlock nods slowly, surely considering the question very seriously.
"Yes?"
He returns to Baker Street barely thirty minutes after having left Sherlock upstairs and Rosie with Mrs Hudson. He choses a bench, sitting down and forcing himself to calm down while keeping a careful eye on the front door. Surely Matthew didn't manage to both shower and get ready in the meantime, and there is a good chance they won't come out for several more minutes. Just the time John needs to reconsider his plan once more, just the time for him to go get his daughter and spend a quiet, nice evening with her instead of watching any more kissing and touching between the man he's desperately in love with and his bloody fiancé.
Sherlock has put down his half full glass, balancing it in a pile of rounded stones.  He's back to touching shells and pebbles, his fingers seeking out the ones that in some way differ from the rest.
This is a new development. Something has changed.
“Tell me.”
It’s not very long yet, messy and uneven in the back, where it’s rubbed off every night when she turns her head in her sleep. John is not a fan of starting the day by chasing a half-naked toddler across the flat. So he sneakily changes Rosie’s nappy while she’s only half awake and brings her right from the bed into her highchair in the kitchen. Sherlock sips his coffee, squinting at her appearance.
John swallows and clears his throat.  "She was a remarkable woman.  And rather good-looking."
“Hmm?”
“Oh God, I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” John pants.
He dabs his nose with a tissue to accentuate the fact. “It’s a very important trip with my work, but now I’m afraid I won’t be able to go, since I’ve felt quite bad for a few days.”
Sherlock asks him to dinner, after. It’s early in the evening and Rosie is at Stella and Ted’s for the night, so there’s no hurry. They eat at a Chinese place on Marylebone Road. They even share a bottle of wine and order dessert. It’s plum wine, made especially by the owners. So smooth, you wouldn’t even realise you were under the table until it was too late. Sherlock has a sweet tooth, though, and John is happy to indulge him.
written all over it."  He triumphantly presents a slightly blackened, but otherwise intact, jar.  "Now this might give us some answers.  I'll bring it to Barts for a proper analysis of the content."
Harry calls. It’s been over a month since John last visited.
, John.  Never doubt it."
”Yes, of course you know where I’ve been and with whom. We’ve just defiled the steam room. Doctors have very steady hands, you know, and John's fingers- oh. He's hung up.”
But it only feels like half a home without John.
John jots down the last statistics, gathers the receipts from each row and puts them back in their respective envelope.  Agitated voices drift down from the upper floor. John glances at his watch and grimaces.  It's nearly gone midnight and he's sent an irritable Sherlock to question a witness.  Not his brightest idea.  He quickly refills the plastic bag and brings it with him out into the hallway, locking the door behind him.  As he ascends the stairs, it sounds as if Sherlock has managed to get into an argument with Wendy Badu.  John stops to listen to the conversation.
"I'm fine," Sherlock says, showing off his hurt hand for good measure.
He’s crying openly now, not hiding his face, just letting the tears run slowly down his cheeks. He sniffs. His stomach turns on what he’s about to say next. He needs to say it.
His voice is suddenly raw, he’s blinking back tears.
She looks away, shifting her feet, as if she might feel contrite, but John doesn't believe in such fast changes of conduct.  Still, he tries to relax and goes for levity:
“You mean you were. Snoring at the barbers’.”
Sherlock considers this.  "Where does he keep his gardening tools?  There's no shed here."
John."
Ella gently pushes the ever-ready box of tissues towards his side of the small table between them. She waits, as always.
They’re alone in a relaxation room -
But this, here? This Sherlock, who must be aware of the long lasting sparkling tension between them, who is sober and not confused by a ridiculous Rizla game, contrary to the last time they sat like this. This Sherlock, who now must know what John wants. This is home and familiarity and somehow safety. Safety enough to plough on and take that last step that’s been eluding him for so long.
"Oh, God!"  The relief is imminent.  John doesn't know what this means, but it's- it's
“So you consider treating me to a spa day as suitable atonement?” Sherlock turns over too, his bent legs still long enough to end up in John’s chair, bumping his knees. “I’m not disagreeing, if it works for you, then it’s good, very good. I’m just saying, to me it’s unneeded. I forgave you long ago. If I still had an issue with it, do you really think I’d ask you to move in with me?
John is incredulous.
“Okay, what are you thinking?”
That whole night had been about nostalgia, as arranged by Sherlock. With it had come, unexpectedly, drunken horny John Watson. The physical attraction that had been evident from the day they met had returned, transformed from sparkling electricity between them to open lust, treacle slow and dangerous, because acting on it could have ruined the life John sought.
The room is a bit kidney shaped, with three open showers in a recess. It’s flowing, curving and sparsely lit, a beautiful blue-green mosaic covering the walls, floor and seating benches. The benches are curved with high reclining backrests, that follows the curve of the room, creating separate niches.
"John, really, you needn't worry about the cost-"
Sherlock has taken his shirt off. John longs to touch him.
Then came the usual morning routine, with Mary running water in the bath, himself seated with the paper and a cup of tea in the kitchen, eventually packing the lunch box. The familiarity of a farewell hug, the scent of Mary's damp hair in a towel, the warmth of a kiss on the cheek. It was all so very comforting, making his doubts seem like ingratitude.
John clears his throat.
"Listen, the most reasonable explanation is that Sarah Cushing bought the flowers at a florist, and then chopped off the rose heads by herself.  I'll ask Donovan to check her receipts and bank withdrawals," John promises, feeling the need to somehow fix this for Sherlock.  "There's a chance Sarah Cushing forgot about those things, even if she was an expert at not leaving fingerprints."
"That's an understatement."  Sherlock smiles.  "
"Um, we'll figure something out," he tries to conclude.
“ You know - the old lesbian living alone forever after the love of her life died scenario. I’m not saying she didn’t live a good and rich life after Dorothy passed. I’m just saying it’s not for me. It did feel as though it was the end for a while, after Clara. We were so young when we got together, it was hard to imagine life without her.”
"I have no view on the matter," he mutters, moving his jaw as little as possible.
“I intentionally used my medical knowledge to sprain the arm of a junkie when he tried to stab me.”
It’s slow and delicate, Sherlocks tongue exploring his scar. John breathes deep and heavy, the warm moisture filling his lungs, expanding. Sherlock’s tongue flicks against his skin, downwards. He shifts, leaning over in front of John, puts his hand on John’s thigh, slides it in just beneath the towel.
Harry’s got a spray bottle. It’s see-through plastic, tinted a sickening artificial green, contrasting sharply against the lush, organic green of the back garden.
"I can't believe Greg let you in on this!  Miss Cushing wrote to you about being threatened, and you just ignored the woman.  Now that her tenant is dead, you're suddenly interested?"
So, when he goes about booking a spa day for him and Sherlock, he's very aware of the challenge he will face.
to keep things from John. But they are both clearly lacking in communication skills, and he’s never wanted to burden John with topics that seems fairly trivial in the grand scheme of things. After all, he’d lived, and come back to London. It had been a bump in the road, unfortunate and utterly unpleasant, but he had lived through it. He’d suffered worse when John had turned his back on him with that letter of misguided excuses. But he can’t make himself say that to John. Maybe some time in the future, he will be able to find the words to communicate his feelings in a way that John can understand. When it won’t hurt him as much.
“What’s really detestable is when you see a family, where the mother’s already pregnant with the next child, they have a toddler running around and
John blinks.  He's suddenly feeling warm and fluttery, like an infatuated schoolboy, as he remembers the kiss in their little humming tunnel of love.  The memory of his blatant demonstration of desire makes his cheeks heat in reminiscence.  He was ready to take things further right then and there.  He can't be sure, but it seemed Sherlock was in a similar mood just now, on the roof, before John tried to be cheeky and made stupid remarks.
After Sherlock's toes have become uncomfortably numb, he ambles back to where John is sitting, and wiggles his foot in front of his amused face.  John shakes his head, but decides to strip down to his vest and uses his own shirt to dry Sherlock's feet, and then helps him into his socks and shoes, tying them off.  John points out powdery smudges on the back of Sherlock's trousers.  It's rusty red-brown residue from the pebbles, and he insists on helping rub them off.  He puts his shirt back on, full of wet patches, and proceeds to rub off their coats too.  They put them on and grab their things.  Sherlock rests his hand across his chest, tucked inside the coat, ducking his head a bit as a brisk wind is picking up.
He was overcome by terrifying impulses that worked themselves into his dreams, ones containing cocks and come between his fingers, or in his mouth, the tantalising curves of muscular thighs and arses and the scent of sweating bodies. He went to bed with his hands firmly placed under the pillow. Luckily the training in itself provided plenty of exercise in control. He learned to keep his head clear and hands steady.
"Huh."
Sherlock tilts his head.  "So that's what this is about?  You're literally holding a blade to my throat while trying to force me to make some kind of statement about women in general, under the guise of speaking about Irene Adler."
"Never mind."  John shakes his head.  "Just a silly theory."
, soon she will start to ask really uncomfortable questions, he can feel it. She’s always been too clever for her own good.
"I used to come up here to have a smoke."  Sherlock nods in the direction of the stairway.  "No disturbances, only the whirr and rumble of ventilation units, and the sounds of the city.  As peaceful as it gets."
"Well, that audience is usually you."  John gives him a crooked smile and takes a sip of his wine.
It's a need he's reluctant to admit; the need of John's physical presence to think more clearly, the need of his touch, which provides a distinct focus point and helps him not to get sidetracked by nonsensical details his brain wilfully deems necessary to process.
“Why are you calling me?”
did you burn them?  I have my theories, but I would like to hear it from you."
"Well, if she'd paid any attention while searching the flat, she would have noticed them too, long before I texted Lestrade about it."
Sherlock has no idea where that terrible sentence came from, but the words are spell-breaking, because now there's a giggle inserting itself between the sobs in the bathroom.
"We should check with his prescriber as to why he was put on them, and if there's been any issues."
He puts his hand over his chest. Now he’s getting all maudlin. Stupid wine.
“What is?”
"It may not need to come to burning."
John doesn’t do casual touches. Practical, part of his training. Friendly but not intimate, never charged.
Lestrade wipes the sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand.  "Yeah.  But according to his landlady, he usually uses the clogs by the back door, when he's in the garden.  And, his bath robe was hanging on the outside, thrown over that wall-mounted garden lamp beside said door."  He points to the article of clothing still draped on the lighting fixture.  "That's how she thought to look for him in the garden."
Now the rising tide is evident.  There's a dramatic shift in temperature when the sky starts to turn grey.  Seagulls are soaring high in the sky, riding the buffeting winds.  Sherlock wraps his scarf around his neck against the chill.
"No, that's my sister."
"Shut up," says Sherlock, trying to focus.
"No, I mean it," Sherlock insists.  "Apparently I drew the wrong conclusions.  I thought it meant I should keep you at a distance, as to not endanger you further.  I could not have been more wrong."
"Either way, I want to be sure there's no lethal additions.  Pickled asparagus doesn't usually warrant to be burned in a futile attempt to conceal it's content," Sherlock says.  "John."  He indicates one of his coat pockets.  John sticks his hand in there, finding a zip bag.  He pulls it open for Sherlock to gingerly lower the jar into it and then zips it up.
, couldn’t keep a secret.”
. That’s a proper, weighty word. And he wishes Sherlock good luck with upcoming cases in his career.
“You think I have a cold?”
Sherlock lights his cigarette as they walk around a bit, slowly approaching the parapet.  He notices John dawdling and turns back to him to find out what's wrong.
, and now he’s getting a second chance at making things right between them. Get back to normal, without resentment and constant doubt. They’ll figure it out. How to be best mates again.
Molly sighs and rolls her eyes.  "While I'm happy to dig around in stomach content, pickles in a jar isn't exactly within my field of expertise."  She stands up to leave.  "And I don't have time for it, I need to finish the report."
“But you
He huffs. She’s got him.
Sherlock eyes him suspiciously.  "What business do you have in Brighton?"
"Hungry?"  says Sherlock.
“Can I touch it?”
"The flowers John, those are significant."
John reaches the landing. The woman stands in the open door, arms folded across her chest, dressed in a nightgown and a silk scarf wrapped around her hair. She's clearly ready to go to bed, and not at all in the mood for a chat with an obnoxious, dubious-looking nutter.
He feels the anger rising. He has never been able to deny Sherlock when he asks like this. Or rather, he’s never
.  John flicks through the photos, then hands the phone over to Sherlock.
She sits down beside him.
Somewhere, out there, are the shores of France.
and in particular
He can’t imagine Sherlock clubbing. Actually, he can, but not in his usual posh suits. He can vividly imagine a junkie-Sherlock clubbing. But that’s an uncomfortable thought. Stunning beauty and devastating disaster, like when John had shut him out, only younger.
“Well... the timing suggests this
John stares. The bricks look identical, the same kind of brick all over as far as he can see. Sherlock lets out a theatrical long-suffering sigh and points at the mortar in-between the bricks. John sees it now; there’s an area, roughly the size of a bin lid where there are white spots on the surface of the bricks. That’s not out of the ordinary. He’s seen thousands of variations of brick surfaces with and without spots, with algae, moss or simple dirt coating the surface.
John is reminded of something.  "There's one more thing."
“Maybe, just maybe, next time you could try to use your brain before coming here. Do you know how many old ladies come in here, apologising for taking up my time, when they should have gone straight to the A&E? ‘
"He's got a knife."  Sherlock notices the instant change in John's demeanour.
John can be pushy when it comes to keeping Sherlock fed, watered and rested, but he's yet to see John persist when it comes to courting.  He's never seen him fight for any of his short-lived relationships, simply accepting the breakups without fuss.
He follows them to the police van to hand over a lidded plastic box, containing the gardening tools, and then they head towards Barts.
God, what has he done? What madness has he destined himself to? This is foolhardy. Sherlock wants this so badly, but it can’t really be as it was before, can it?
It's nearly ten in the evening, and Miss Cushing is exhausted after having gone through roughly a year's worth of receipts.  Sherlock hasn't actually examined the contents yet, just help sort the envelopes according to date.  But, with a near constant yawn, Miss Cushing is clearly ready for bed.  She's arranged for her sister to pick her up, and will stay at her place, but Sherlock and John have access to her rooms if need be, so the investigation can continue.
“Yeah, we’re already doing that, actually,” John interrupts, not very keen on being reminded of the fact that he and his baby daughter has moved in with a recently relapsed ex-addict.
wouldn’t be
“Not a drop, truly. I’m trying to be supportive, you know.”
“Three months plus ten weeks, that’s- that’s nothing,” Sherlock says, bemused.
. You can leave, you can choose differently, you can decide for yourself.”
John was used to correcting her, for her own protection, make her less intimidating to narrow minds. Harry didn’t care if he made excuses for her or not, that it was his problem, not hers.
"Really?  How come I never knew?"
Sherlock smirks.
"Right."
He inhales shakily, suddenly overcome with emotion. This was his second home for so many years. Or rather his only home. The other place never felt like it. No comfort there, no safety or trust.
"What are we celebrating?"
"It's just, as your friend, as someone who... sometimes worries about you..."  John pauses, licks his lips.  "You are a living, breathing man," he starts over, not sure how to proceed.
Mary’s death still keeps him up at night, when he feels the weariness of being so very alone. Alone with his motherless child.
“I’m not very good at waiting.”
“How could she? Yes, I know she wasn’t prejudiced, but how could she ever understand me having these- these urges?”
“What are you afraid of, John?”
"Thank you, Molly," Sherlock says, polite, but dismissive, and turns to John.  "So, a late lunch, you say?"
"Well, you've certainly put yourself in a bit of a predicament," says Sherlock.  "However, it seems like I was being indiscreet when I, against all protocol, spoke
"Nothing else?"
"Ah, vaguely.  No, she's not dead," Sherlock says reassuringly. "But one of her tenants is.  Look up exactly what she wrote while I dress!"
“Yeah?”
Sherlock’s eyes go wide.
John follows.  Inside the thicket, in the shadow, shielded from the world, the low hum nearly overrides the constant soughing of the sea.  The sun falls in between leaves, creating variations of green.  The bees work over the tiny blossoms, disturbing minimal petals which fall down like snowflakes.
Sherlock's mouth is tight.
"Can you read the label?"  John hands over the phone.  "I can't."
“I didn’t think you meant that. It’s just…”
. People didn’t remember me, didn’t remember I used to be his blogger. It wasn’t
"Right-handed, as indicated by the writer's callus on his right middle finger."
“We should ask Rosie, she couldn’t get enough of you even when she was just a toddler,” John says, the memories coming back to him nonstop ever since he got here. “There were days when she didn’t even care about me at all when you were in the room.”
John Watson loves us, Sherlock. He loves us to a point that he will forget to be mad sometimes, to a point where he would jump in front of bullets for us, to a point where he would find a million ways to try and prove it.
Sherlock smiles, rubbing his nose along John’s just because he can.
“There,” John smiles, warm and pliant against him. “Perfect.”
Yes. We are.
XX32:
“Sure, yeah.”
"What are you doing in there?!" Rosie's calls, once again forcing John not to crash Sherlock's lips against his and kiss the breath out of him. "Let's go!"
498 words.
“Told you,” John almost grins, “We’re not too old.”
Sherlock glances at him, “You mean about us.”
“There’s a high chance it won’t,” Sherlock replies, a barely hidden smile in his voice.
John wakes up alone the next morning, no longer facing the wall but Sherlock’s side of the bed. He wonders, just for an instant, how exactly they were lying when Sherlock woke up. He sure would have prefered to be the one waking up first. It takes a second more to remember the day before and Victor. Well aware of how much his attitude yesterday betrayed, John doesn’t waste another minute in bed. The last few days had been particularly perfect, bringing them closer than they had ever been, and he intends to make sure this Victor Trevor isn’t going to ruin it all.
“Seems like one, yes,” John replies, accepting the coffee and letting him in. “You were in the neighborhood?”
“Yes.”
The urge to kiss those tempting lips taking over again, John gives in, and they both wait for the shaking to stop with long, smiling kisses. And when Sherlock declares, long minutes later and with a sharp comment about the stickiness, that next time they’re definitely taking their trousers and underwear off, John doesn’t even think of arguing about it.
Sherlock breathes out slowly, his voice almost too quiet as he asks, “Yes?”
Sherlock's eyes find his again, and this time linger there for a long moment. John forces himself to look back at the road, fingers curling into a fist and he breathes out slowly.
"You’ve had your share of sex, Watson," he breathes to himself, closing his eyes as the regrets come flooding to his head. "Just not with him."
Rosie looks down at herself, "Bee."
John taps his finger against his seat, "It's been awhile since I last saw them."
“Don’t be like that,” John says, stopping just in front of the door. “If you want to improvise, then fine. You’ll be answering all those questions when they come, I’ll follow your lead.”
I think I’m nervous.
I gotta to go, talk to you later.
And even if it was all
The only thing now was that Sherlock couldn’t properly tell if having sex with John tonight, leaving him in the morning and never hearing about him again, was what he wanted. Sherlock was certain John wouldn’t say no, his attraction to Sherlock obvious since the beginning. But the soldier’s reaction to Sherlock’s attitude all day had been a constant surprise, and somehow, Sherlock felt as if having sex with him would put John at the same level as the other people Sherlock had gone to bed with.
"So soft, so very soft."
John nods, about to say something again but choosing to roll to his back instead. Sherlock almost protests, almost. He remains on his side, the evidence of what just happened wet in his pants, but he can’t think about this now. Not when John is right here and apparently slipping away all the same. A silence that could have been comfortable stretches into something much heavier, filled with all they should be saying, and Sherlock wants to pull John back to him and whisper it all against his neck.
Sherlock’s hand is shaking when it meets John’s arm, sliding up, up, up to his neck and remaining there. Owning. John kisses him just a little harder, pushing against those ever tempting lips only to have them open for him. His moan, this time, echoes in the room, loud and craving more. Sherlock’s hand moves to his nape and up his hair as their tongue meet again and again. And with the dazzling thought that he’s allowed to, John goes and touches him. Curls. As soft as expected, curling around his fingers.
John holds back all the questions rushing to his head, and settles for the easy one: “Cases too boring for him?”
“Well, since we no longer will, no other choice but to teach me then.”
“I’ve missed you,” Sherlock whispers, having learned by now that he’s allowed to say such things.
Sherlock peeks at the paper. “We have two separate lists?”
“Forensic Science” came the mumbled reply while Sherlock was clearly focussed on something else, namely scanning the security footage.
surprising fact, receiving a letter from another version of myself, or that other version of myself is married to John?
"Internet," Matthew replies, smiling fondly, probably at the memories and John watches in defeat as Sherlock’s own lips curl into a similar smile. "I couldn't believe the great Sherlock Holmes was looking for love, and so we chatted for several months before finally agreeing to meet."
It takes another long minute before Sherlock finally confesses, "Mary." John swallows with difficulty, remaining silent to encourage him to continue. "I know it's my fault, that I'd gone away and you couldn't just wait for me when I had no idea myself when I'd be back."
“I love you,” Sherlock whispers because he can’t recall having said so today, because John needs to know that he’s there too, all the way.
John pushes in slowly, so very slowly, watching Sherlock’s face tensing up. He kisses his cheeks, soft and reassuring.
John closes his eyes, still smiling. It only occurs to him as he drifts off to sleep that he is much, much too relaxed.
“Ok, heading to bed now.”
“Celebrating?” John asks, looking down at the drinks on the table.
* * *
XX67: A shock?
Sherlock is about to contest that when he comes to realise what John is implying. Feeling himself blush again, he breathes in slowly, “Interesting?”
No questions.
Sherlock’s eyes drop to his lips as he says, “You still haven’t done it.”
John waits until the sound of her footsteps fade away before asking, “Who is it?”
“Rosie called me this morning,” John says suddenly, forcing Sherlock to focus back on the two of them again. “She couldn’t believe I was really here, I can’t remember the last time I heard her so excited.”
“It’s not that cold,” Sherlock points out, finishing his tea in one sip.
"I was happy you came back home," Sherlock breathes, refusing to meet John's eyes again. "But the years that followed only made it harder and harder to remain silent."
John wakes up feeling incredibly warm. It only takes a second to identify the source of such heat, Sherlock’s entire body being currently pressed against his own. Unlike yesterday, John is the one who traveled all the way to the left side of the bed, having locked one arm around Sherlock’s wait and brought his back directly against his chest. Slowly, he register the plant of Sherlock’s foot against his, his nape barely millimeters away from his mouth and the addictive scent of him. John smiles, unable not to do so, and closes back his eyes. He silently thanks his mind and body for the lack of morning erection, letting him enjoy a few minutes more of
His phone chimes again, and this time Sherlock searches for it blindly by his side. It’s probably Montgomery inquiring about the cold case he gave him two days ago, and Sherlock isn’t surprised to read two different curses in each text, the man having lost patience a long time ago it seems. He replies quickly, assuring him that he’ll make sure to come by the office later today. He puts his phone away, one hand rubbing his eyes, and makes another mental note about going to the ophthalmologist as soon as possible.
I’m happy we did too,
“Prick,” John smiles, shaking his head. “How did you find out about this place?” He asks, choosing a more easy subject to talk about.
(See the end of the chapter for
All the air leave John’s lungs.
That's all it takes for Sherlock's orgasm to explode between them, his muscles contracting around John and sending him over the edge in just two more thrusts. He's not sure how long they remain suspended in a state a pure bliss, but suddenly there is Sherlock's hot and ragged breath against his neck, and John is certain he's never going to be able to move again. Still, he forces himself to slide to his side, Sherlock turning in his arms to curl around him immediately, head nestled against his neck.
ruin it all. I’ve done it before, so really, there’s nothing stopping me from doing it all over again.
It’s not the first time he’s gone to a club. He used to go every week back when drugs were so easy to find in such places, but he has to admit it’s been a while since he indulged in simply
“We’re really the lucky ones to have her,” John breathes, closing his eyes, and Sherlock can’t look away. He needs to remember him like this, relaxed and lost to his own thoughts, the years having only brought out the smiling lines around his eyes, ones Sherlock finds himself now desperate to trace softly. “I looked through your cupboards by the way.”
But in the meantime, another version of ourselves is living in his own universe, and that’s what I’m going to focus on now. I’m sure you’ve already guessed which major event in our past could have brought you and John closer. So yes, in the fourth universe, Sherlock and John finally find their way to each other after Sherlock’s return. John still meets Mary, but the night Sherlock comes back, he decides to go see him. Their first kiss is full of relief, standing on the pavement, and John leaves immediately after without saying another word. It takes them a full week before they face the fact that it happened, and another three days to get a second kiss. They don’t wait that long for the next one.
I take it they’re celebrating.
“I have to be in London tonight!” Sherlock practically yelled and the woman stepped back marginally. “You understand this is a matter of national security?”
“Maybe,” Sherlock murmurs.
"She'll come back for the holidays," Sherlock says, not a question.
“Everything alright with you?”
You wake up next to him and it’s like all winning numbers on your lottery ticket, it’s like bursting into bright laugher at the most unexpected time, it’s like pushing the door open and thinking with a smile
“Ladies and Gentlemen, the flight 432 to London will be a few minutes delayed. Thank you for your understanding.”
"I never liked her," Sherlock confesses. "I tried, but I just couldn't-" he chokes on the words, and John holds him tighter.
Here’s what I can tell you of the Pool universe:
He kissed me.
“I’ve missed you too,” John murmurs back. “Oh, I’ve got you these.”
“No”, John shook his head, eyes wide, “Not by a long shot. That was amazing.” John paused, still staring at Sherlock before smiling as he asked, “If I bother you with how you did it, will you give me some evasive answer again or will you answer?”
John closes his eyes, on the verge of storming in and breaking the two of them apart.
, but all the possibilities were now crashing down his shoulders.
John bursts out laughing, Sherlock joining after a beat. God, how he loves this man.
Sherlock, I feel
“Yes,” John says, glancing up. “He’s unpacking.”
John, please, I
Sherlock reaches for him before he can think twice about it, one hand coming to settle in the crook of John’s neck, fingertips brushing hair. “I haven’t deleted a single thing when it comes to you, John. I’ve kept it all, the bad and the good. The times when I could barely hold back from pulling you into my arms, and the times when I found myself thinking maybe it would have been better if I had never met you. I’ve kept it all, right here, and I don’t plan on ever forgetting about it.”
John pushes the door open, his breath catching at the sight of the double bed perfectly made. He wonders if Sherlock takes care of it himself, if he comes to this room regularly to clean everything and make sure the sheets are perfectly made just in case he showed up.
go meet Greg for that
Enjoy,
In the Pool universe, John’s kidnapping changed everything. They went home that night and kissed the second they were both safe inside the flat. From what I’ve been allowed to see, desperation drove them together in the best way it can.
“Surprised,” Sherlock continues, John’s word echoing against the wall of his mind palace.
"I know you said you never joined Horsen in bed," John pants when they pull away for air, "but i'd rather take you upstairs, if you don't mind." Sherlock nods his head, not bothering to reply and choosing to kiss him again instead. The moment John's hips begin to roll on their own volition, he pushes Sherlock away and asks, "Are you absolutely certain?"
“There are civilians in this airport,” John began and Sherlock’s lips twitched into a smile, waiting for John to continue. “We don’t know if this man is armed. We have to be careful.”
Sherlock opens the door, fidgeting with the car keys. “We’ll see you tomorrow.”
“You must be John, I’m Victor.”
John licks his lips, the finger stroking absently the armrest of his chair coming to a halt, “If this is too much.” He hesitates. “If this isn’t what you had imagined.”
Come on, just admit you enjoyed
“You didn’t!” John laughed, maybe two hours later as Sherlock explained how he confronted the chief of police on national television. “You’re completely mad.”
Thank you for all the amazing feedback on the first chapter, I hope you'll all like this one just as much!
“John,” Sherlock interrupts him. “They’re beautiful.”
“Right now.”
“I know,” Sherlock breathes, wishing he could find the words to make John understand. “I had years to study my reactions to your touch, voice or mere presence. Just like I had years to think about what I would do if the occasion presented itself. I trust you and am ready, John, for all you’d like to experience with me.”
“Yes?”
“John…I…”
Sherlock nods quickly, letting one hand slide down John’s back, hoping to be obvious enough, but John stops him, “Hold on, love. There’s no need for that now, is there?”
“Why did you go in there?”
"But I liked talking to you that night," John says, one finger tracing the line around his eyes. "It allowed me to realise I was truly back, with you."
Another kiss; soft.
I refused to reread it. But
But I promised to explain everything, so let me start with that.
"I can wait," John asserts, pushing his two fingers deeper and smiling broadly when Sherlock's entire body arches.
“Sir, I really need you to turn around and leave this private area.”
The man laughs quietly, “I used to be much better at this before.”
You can choose to believe me or not, and I’m going to give you the time I know I would have needed to make a decision before sending another letter. I promise to explain all there is to understand then. But before you make up your mind, let me tell you the only reason I choose to write this letter in the first place.
John represses another laugh before shaking his head, “Sorry, it’s just that… well, you’ve got some sauce on your chin.”
12:35 Is there another you out there in a parallel universe
“Sherlock,” he says, half breathing. “Look at me.”
- Letter read sitting in his chair -
“You did?”
, he would have murmured, shaking his head and rubbing a hand on his nape (he does so whenever he’s feeling compassionate with another human being).
So here it is, Sherlock, the letter I now wish to tear apart and start over. But I won’t, because I trust you with those secrets, trust you with so much more too.
“You’re looking too in case you haven’t noticed,” he replies, his own eyes scanning the people gathered in the overly crowded pub while desperately trying to fight the urge to turn around.
Sherlock lifted himself up, resting on his elbows for a moment as he watched John get up. He let his eyes run over the detailed muscular chest in front of him, not quite missing the way John smirked when he caught him staring. Sherlock shook his head, his hands already unbuttoning his trousers as John searched for the supplied they needed. He efficiently removed both trousers and pants in one smooth movement, John’s words still echoing in his mind. He barely had the time to lie back before John turned to face him again. Sherlock let one of his hand slide down his chest, the other tightening in the sheets. He smiled as John licked his lips, the habit giving away John’s obvious thoughts.
Sherlock takes a quick look around them. “You want me to deduce them?”
"Sorry," Sherlock murmurs. "I didn't mean to-"
“Is she usually that stubborn?”
“Right, yes, sure,” John says, glancing up at him.
"Yes", he replies quickly, clearing his throat. "Coming."
They aren’t talking, not quite breathing either.
“I’m sorry to come so early,” she apologises, “but I was wondering if I could get some more of your honey, we sold the last jar yesterday.”
“I am still not sure today how I would have reacted if you had kissed me that night,” Sherlock replies, searching his eyes. “I was trying really hard to impress you and make you move in, but at the same time, I was realising it might be more complicated than first planned to live with you. You were a mystery to solve back then, still are today really, and most of that came from the fact that you were making me experience feelings I didn’t understood.”
: 15:02
Three knocks on the door interrupts him.
"No," John asserts, meeting his eyes again. "But there are things we need, and I'm hoping that the time it will take us to get them will also allow us to cool down a bit."
He goes to the bed instead, knowing Sherlock needs this time alone just as much as he does. He pull the covers down the bed, and moves to open the window just a little. Casting a quick look around the room, he decides to only leave the light on the bedside table on. He's just about to sit down and wait when he hears footsteps on the stairs. He smiles, feeling as a bloody teenager right before his first time. He can't imagine what must be going through Sherlock's head.
“Yes.”
His hands are shaking.
He shrugs it all off, turning around to head for the stairs, but can’t help to glance one last time at John, finding him staring back, and they both giggle at the same time. And when Sherlock finally makes it up the stairs and into the bathroom, he has never felt so light in his life.
John was a bit shocked, he had to admit, but it was still incredibly extraordinary. He had practically told Sherlock nothing about himself or his background and now it seemed like it had all been written onto his forehead from the get-go.
“Yes,” Sherlock says, clearing his throat. “I’ve also taken care of Rosie’s bags. I’m not sure Mycroft would approve of what you’ve done with his room.”
elements unknown found.
“They’re back at the house already,” Sherlock says, pocketing back his phone. “We should head back too.”
John represses a laugh at the confusion on Sherlock’s face, and he kisses him softly, “We’ll deal with that later.”
“Goodnight, love,” he whispers.
“You’re her father, John, of course she cared about you,” Sherlock replies, leaning back against his chair, still not looking away from him.
Sherlock had to repress a sigh once they arrived the restaurant. Christmas decoration were hanging everywhere. Two santa claus were watching Sherlock, their frozen smile rendering them more scary than welcoming. Every table was covered in green and red, the usual Christmas song resonating inside and Sherlock almost considered waiting for Marks to walk out to catch him.
“What?”
"Then he can say no himself if he doesn't want to go with us tonight," John snaps. "Sorry, I didn't mean-" He rubs a hand over his eyes. "Can I go ask for myself? You can't tell me to leave now."
I meant what I said earlier, this is a lot to take in, and I am truly starting to believe it will somehow make sense at some point, but in the meantime, I can’t just not talk about it. To you.
“Someone is framing me,” Victor explains. “The police is saying I’ve stole millions of dollars which, of course, I haven’t.”
“I do not ca-”
“No,” Sherlock cuts him.
Sherlock is still gazing at his lips when he says, "At the tarmac, I almost told you. Would it have changed something if I did?"
Simple attraction based on Uniform was an easy thing to exploit, so John made sure that his jacket was open with its sleeves rolled up just past the elbows and his military t-shirt was tucked snugly into his fatigues. It should feel wrong to utilise his rank like that but then again they had already been treading on the verge of wrong for quite a while.
Sherlock let the door slam shut behind them, his eyes fixed on John. He was still smiling, his face completely open for Sherlock to read and yet Sherlock couldn’t understand the, surely simple, reason why John had not walked away yet. Yes, he was worried about the tourist’s safety as well as for Sherlock’s. But he could just go find the police at the airport and let them arrest Jason Marks. He didn’t need Sherlock to do it and yet here he was, waiting patiently for Sherlock to give the next instruction and smiling. Always smiling.
"You bought a razor kit and shaving gel at Tesco," Sherlock states.  "You didn't buy this at the pharmacy.  Is there toothpaste and toothbrushes in the backpack as well?"
Sherlock looks like Jesus on the cross. Arms spread, hands high up, white-knuckled from holding on to the headrest. Shoulders lower, head fallen to the side, neck exposed. Only Sherlock’s legs go on forever, thighs spread wide. John opens up the towel, letting Sherlock’s erection spring free.
John holds up a finger.  "Yes, hello!"  He half turns away from Sherlock, pressing the phone to his ear and blocking the other with his hand to shut out the sound of the storm.  He walks away for a bit, and Sherlock can't make out what he says, until he raises his voice.
It's a rare moment, but John is certain that Sherlock is nervous about the answer.  Or shy, he's never quite sure when it comes to Sherlock's more unreadable expressions.  "It's an, um, a special interest of mine, since a young age."
“Sufficiently similar for a viable comparison.”
“Bee?”
“Good God,” Sherlock blurts out. “
He walks to the door, his last sentence echoing in his mind. He can feel tears rising, swallows hard.
Sherlock has already handed Rosie over to the sitter, so it’s just him and John. He waits in his chair for John to come back from changing his clothes. He’s prepared tea for them both.
“You can’t run off like that. It’s too big a risk.”
They had talked long into the night - about Catherine and Dorothy, about how they had been able to fly under the radar. How lesbian and gay experiences differ due to society’s expectations. How the contempt for femininity affects gay men, how the sexualisation of lesbians makes them a target for straight men. How bisexuals are largely invisible, leaving people like John feeling isolated, without role models. About the crushing loneliness of being on one’s own, trusting no-one, fearing everyone’s judgement, wondering - fearing - if they might be right. About ignoring it, pushing it back into secrecy until you meet someone who can’t be reduced to a quick shameful shag in the dark. About choosing conformity, just so you can label it and get a grip around something. Something tangible, traditional, safe. About still feeling lonely and then losing it all.
John holds him like that, watching Sherlock’s beautiful mouth open on a moan. He clenches his fists, tugging on soft curls, and Sherlock’s eyes fall closed as he lets out a trembling sound. John does it again, and this time, Sherlock shudders and draws in a sharp breath. His hands slip off of John, scrambling for a grip on the wet mosaic. John catches his wrists, firmly guides Sherlock’s hands onto the seat for support. Sherlock keens.
John moves to the lobby and the fireplace. He orders a brandy.
“In what situations have you turned to violence?”
“Pest control,” she says with a wicked smile before attacking the plants.
“Yeah I did. I had good grades, so medicine seemed viable. But I didn’t get into med school on my first attempt. So I signed up for basic military training. If I saw that through, I’d have succeeded where my dad never could. Also, the Balkan War had made an impression. The reports were jarring, and going there would have had a clear purpose.”
"Well, you would know from Afghanistan, I presume."
Sherlock's had enough of John's tip-toeing around this topic.  "You want to keep talking about Irene Adler?  Well then, I have some important conclusions to share."  He takes a deep drag on the cigarette and then lets the words surge out of his mouth, along with the smoke.  "One, I know for a fact that Irene Adler is exclusively attracted to women, never mind the performances she puts up in her line of work.  She and I are very similar; it was a bit like looking into a mirror, a form of validation.  She could read people in a way I can't.  But she read them all the same, with her own methods of deduction.  I felt a kinship, and I think she felt the same."
That's when Mary came into his life. He was indebted to her. He should be thankful that someone loved him, saw him at his worst and didn't pity him or find him repulsive.
“Let’s have a look at this and see if there’s any description you feel resonates with your experiences.”
Sometimes, when they fell asleep on the sofa in front of the telly, and John woke up to hours of insomnia at half past two, blaring lights all still on, and the telly had shut itself off - those times he felt that emptiness, as if he existed in a distant dream, a non-state.
"Aaah!  I'm getting too old for these all-nighters," John groans and stretches, sitting down on the edge of the bed.  "I mean, it's not much trouble going on little sleep if there's a case, but these stops and starts, naps and
“It’s fine, John. I understand why you didn’t talk to me. It would surely have made a difference, for both of us. But I realise it could have been conflicting too. Those were messy years.”
"The silk scarf you were wearing would have burnt slowly, only dying flames and embers.  You probably didn't even notice until you smelled it.  But the grey ash, crumbling to a powder, would have told me the whole story."
He purses his lips to stop his face showing the disgust he feels.
“Oh. A yogi. So you’re a hippie now?”
“I think he forgave her in an instant. God knows why.”
“So, what does it mean then? That someone removed and put back those bricks with an inferior mortar?”
"How come you know so much about bees and plants?" John asks as they crouch in the low-growing  foliage behind a hedge while dusk is descending.
There she is, balancing upside down on a tilted wooden board, hands on the rubbery surface and slowly lowering her legs to rest her knees on her elbows, the group following her movements. Her strength and control is quite impressive. Hopefully it’s only physical, or else he’ll be in for a match. Wouldn’t be surprising.
XX32: Are you certain? I meant what I said, Sherlock. I want us to take our time, but as the same time, I need you to know how I feel, how I always felt. I really, really don’t want to ru-
I should have listen to Mycroft. Just the fact that I'm writing this down is the only proof I need that I'm going out of my mind with all this. Alternate universes do not exist. No matter the facts, no matter the inconstances. This Sherlock Watson-Holmes can't do anything to
In control.
XX32: How so?
At least he stayed for lunch. It was almost just like it used to be.
"Well, so far we've done a thorough search of the garden.  They're just finishing up behind the shed.  We've not been able to find any tracks from any kind of struggle, or dragging the body after death.  No signs of forced entry, as I told you on the phone.  The curious thing is, why is he only in his pants, but dressed in socks and shoes with properly tied shoes?"
They speak, but only about the food and the wine.  The, rather lovely, young innkeeper serves as a waiter too.  There's no grounds for any complaint; he's professional and polite.  But every little glance or smile he lets slip tells John that this, obviously queer, young man sees a couple on a romantic seaside retreat.  John's heart sinks.  Because that is so close to what he hoped for, when he bought the bloody champagne and asked the cashier at Tesco for advice on any small scale Bed & Breakfast, out of town but still close to the sea.  He saved the number in his phone, just in case things would develop that way.  But he was scared and drank too much, looking for an excuse to stay the night, and to dare to book that room.  When he'd sobered up he found the courage to ask, to prod around for any hint of interest in romance.  Only, he pushed things too far, and now Sherlock is barely speaking to him.
This is different. John is different.
“How is the drinking now?”
"Yes, and just- just being here, relaxing, fresh air... and the company."  He grins, feeling a nervous twitch in the corner of his mouth.
"John.  There's
She and John had struck up a relatively smooth path of renewed friendship. She’d invited him to concerts. It wasn’t John’s usual music taste, but he appreciated the raw energy, so he actually chose Straight Edge concerts over med student parties a few times.
"I think it's everything.  It's
“M-hmm.”
Sherlock makes a face of disappointment and doubt.  "That's impossible."
An odd look crosses Sherlock’s face before he pivots the focus back to John.
The dining table folds out, so Sherlock and John had put on gloves to start to spread out the envelopes on top of it.  They all have printed stickers with the name and address.  Inkjet printer, probably printed in a home, at least not in an office or any official setting.  Though that could have been a deliberate choice to confuse.
, Atlantic slipper limpets."
The pubic hair resembles dark moss covered in dew, small and tightly coiled. John can slowly rake his fingers through it and relishes when Sherlock trembles, the mix of sweat and condensation covering his body gleaming in the low light. John cups Sherlock’s balls and leans in, licking up his neck.
“I’m happy to have you back in my life. Very happy. You can tell that to your therapist.”
John softly traces the shape of his mouth, from the cupid’s bow downward, letting his thumb catch on the lower lip, feeling the heat of the moist inside.
If he’d been suicidal after Afghanistan, which he actually could admit to himself that he’d been to some degree, any thoughts approaching the subject was tainted by Sherlock's precedent and effectively stopped. So that road was practically closed.
Sherlock shifts.  "Good luck, Molly," he says sincerely, which makes Molly roll her eyes, before she turns around to leave.
"Right.  It was an accident."
"Sleep then," Sherlock murmurs.
"Of course I want a bloody-" John exclaims, then instantly reins himself in.  "Sorry!  Yes, I want the sea view.  We're here to see the sea."  He giggles, mouthing '
"Because
“Right.”
“If you’d only show Mrs H the same courtesy,” John mutters.
. He’s missed it, he’s missed her so, so much. He just didn’t know it, didn’t stop to let himself feel any longing.
Harry meets his diversion with calmness.
She follows John's gaze.  "Oh, he doesn't mind, truly.  I usually do that when I need something from him.  He comes down within a minute."
“Of course not. I was thinking we should do something about the damp in 221C. There’s room enough down there for both a proper laboratory and a honey extractor."
That's way out of line.
"I'm sure you have your reasons," Sherlock says.  "What I'd like to know is, how many lies you've told me and the officers."
Sherlock squints.  He then puts the phone down on the narrow table between them and starts to ruffle around in his coat pockets.  "John,"  he says with reluctance.  "I'm in need of some assistance."
“Oh, look who’s talking!”
They change in separate cubicles, and as soon as John has put his things in the locker, he hurries into the shower room, feeling jumpy. The showers have partitions, but no doors or curtains. It’s all nice and fancy. There’s beautiful mosaic patterns on the walls and the showerheads provide a rainfall effect.
"John," Sherlock says, his voice a bit shaky.
“How could I not? It’s the only- the only thing left of my daughter’s mother.”
"Dear Lord,
"John, see?  The old Bailey.  And to your left, Saint Paul's Cathedral."
"The allotment, of course.  Dusk is near, we have no time to lose."
John gives him a weak smile, lets go of the door and claps him on the shoulder.
“I cheated, I lied and didn’t forgive her although I told her I had!”
The small seedlings in Catherine’s window, planted by her right before she had the fatal stroke, cared for by Harry and John, had produced tomatoes, and Harry took care of their seeds, for Rosie.
Sherlock paces the narrow front yard, puffing smoke, when John eventually joins him.
They need to put the kitchen chairs on top of the table and let the remaining chairs lie down on the floor all across the flat.
“I never got any flower fairy dolls. I only got old, hand-me-down
John knows Sherlock’s been texting with Irene Adler. Besides, he hasn’t yet made amends for what he’s done. So he gets into a cab, watching Sherlock head back home to Baker Street.
"An appreciation of your brilliance.  And your mouth."
“What’s your responsibility in this, John?”
How fucking unfair is it that these versions of ourselves get to be happy. Why them? Why do they get to be married and waking up next to each other every morning? Why do they get to kiss, hold, and love each other without restraint when I can’t even send you a single text without wondering if you’ll ever want to talk to me again.
“You just said my name for no obvious reason”, Sherlock points out, and John can easily guess the frown on his face.
Sherlock shuts his eyes tighter, nails digging into his skin.
I’m obviously an idiot thinking that sending this picture would make it easier.
“Not really an accident, no.”
Sherlock smiles. “I love you.”
"I kept the same photograph in Baker Street, just better hidden," Sherlock confesses. "I placed it in my bedroom after moving in here."
But now there's Dad's wide eyes at the sight of molecular food, and Pa's bright smile watching him.
Sherlock moans into the next kiss, and the one after that. They settle back against one another after a few more, John’s lips not leaving Sherlock’s skin for long. Leaving trail of kisses up and down his nape, he lets his thumb stroke Sherlock’s chest as well, slow and soft.
Sherlock doesn't reply, turning the water off and wandering off to the living room again. John waits, a minute, two but it appears Sherlock is done with brunch. Deciding his own dishes can wait, John heads for the bathroom, desperate to clear his head. Too much hope had always been dangerous, and waking up pressed against Sherlock is definitely -
"I still stand by my words, Sherlock," Mycroft suddenly says. "You should have told John a long time ago."
Sherlock felt his cock pulsed and he wondered how John would react if he were to touch himself right now. Would he punished Sherlock with strong pushes against his postrate? Or would he chase Sherlock’s hand away only to replace it with his own? The thoughts made Sherlock bite his lips, hoping his face wouldn’t betray his fantasy but John was concentrate on driving him mad with lust. Sherlock just decided to find out when John added a fourth finger, Sherlock losing the ability to think properly.
Sherlock is holding his hand tightly as he says,
I bet he did! Reading your
John asked that you give the second envelope to the John Watson you know. He also asked that you do not read it. I trust that you won’t.
WARNING FOR THIS CHAPTER
“John!”
“I know.”
John repressed a smile and shakes his head, “You know exactly what I mean, Sherlock.”
“You should,” John starts, clearing his throat. “I mean, it’ll be more efficient if we’re both in just our pants.”
“Got those,” Montgomery declares.
“Perfect,” John says, turning to tell Sherlock but he’s already climbing up the stairs.
"Since you didn't take my advice at the time," Mycroft continues, sounding all too serious now. "I was wondering if you would consider it once more, now that the two of you are reunited."
Sherlock stares, and stares some more, until Lestrade shakes his shoulder, “So, that’s you right? That John is the man from the pub? Come on, it has to be!”
He really knows you - the other you. I’m jealous of their relationship. They have no secrets. They tell each other everything. That’s what I want for us. I want to know all that’s going through your head each time you look at me for long minutes, not talking, not moving. I want to know what you see, what you read on me that’s so mesmerizing. You’ve always looked at me so differently than everyone else, and I always - always - loved being under your studying stare. It made me feel special, somehow. But yesterday, the two of us sitting at that table in a crowded restaurant, your stare made me feel as if we were completely alone. You’ve stopped hiding, Sherlock, and being able to read it all on
As I told you before, I am not going to keep secret any of the things this other John wrote. I actually believe he wants me to tell you, or at least, I know I wouldn’t have minded. So let’s start with the obvious, the one fact that’s even more unreal than this whole other universe thing: this other John is married to you.
"I've been waiting for the both of you this whole time," Sherlock declares, dropping a smiling kiss on Rosie's forehead. "Now come on, I know just where to go."
“It’s alright.”
“How was the ride?”
02:36
Sherlock nuzzles back against him as an answer, and John breathes out deeply as he searches where to begin.
. Sherlock could take care of it quickly, invent a convincing lie and get inside the staff area without any disturbance.
He could always call Mycroft and ask him to confirm that his suspect’s plane was also not going to take off. But then he would owe Mycroft a favor, and Sherlock knew too well the kind of events Mycroft would want him to attend. No, Sherlock had begun this case by himself, and he would find a way to finish it here.
Sherlock,
John feels his heartbeat quickening as he says, “There is only one bed at your parents.”
“I want to stay in bed all day.”
Oh and surprise, for this final chapter, we're switching to John's pov!
Four different universe where John and I exist. And he knows about them all. He's observed them all, maybe even contact them all.
So I’ve been thinking of doing Interlude chapters where it’s not epistolary, here and there, what do you think?
At least until John does something kind of wonderful with his tongue.
“Ladies and Gentlemen, the flight 654 to London will be delayed indefinitely. Our flight attendants are at your service for any question. Thank you very much for your understanding.”
“I’m not saying it would have been easy,” John replies, knowing all too well just how hard it all can be. “It’s just that, in their case, talking would have save them years.”
“We got that, yes,” John says, helping Timothy to get back up. “Hi, I’m John.”
John,
“I should go,” Sherlock says, knowing perfectly neither of them will be able to say nothing of importance. Not at this hour, not so soon after John’s first attempt at “fixing” things. “There’s this experiment waiting at home.”
“You know which part,” John replies, lips curling into a shy smile, eyes still not quite meeting his.
Could we, i mean, would
John smiles, turning his back at them to hang his jacket and remove his shoes.
Pauline
Quentin, stunned to complete silent next him, glances at John with wide eyes. John smiles, shaking his head and whispering, “No worries.”
“John, I have a question,” Tom says, walking in and stopping dead when noticing Sherlock.
it all again.
he explained the third
In the cab, yes.
“What are you still doing there?” John sighs, walking closer. “You’re not even wearing your jacket.”
One page.
John chuckles, actually turning around this time. Sherlock makes sure to keep breathing.
“Alright.” John nodded, already shifting back to his military posture.
“I take it that you found him?” John’s voice came from behind him, startling Sherlock a little.
“- our bed until the said later.”
“I was chasing a suspect,” Sherlock replies, already feeling more at ease with the change of subject.
I did too, John.
John remains still for a moment too long, Victor clearing his throat.
There is no other option really. I revealed all of my deepest thoughts to Sherlock, told him all the things I never dared to tell anyone, and I trusted him with all of it. And he trusted me too, he told me secrets that made me angry and sad and bloody mad sometimes, but he told them to me, and for that, I’m so very grateful.
"You said so already," Sherlock points out.
“Sherlock,” John says, nothing having felt so right in his life. “I’ve thought long and hard about what I wanted to tell you today. It feels as if everything has already been said, in letters or in whispers. But I realised it doesn’t matter if it’s all been said before. I love you, and I want to tell you so every day for all the days to come. You saved me a lifetime ago, it feels like, and you keep on saving me with every kiss and touch and look. You gave me a life I never dared to imagine, and I want to spend the rest of it with you, with cases, experiments, chases and stakeouts, but also with dates and evenings in our chairs and dancing in the middle of the night. I love you, Sherlock Holmes, and I plan on loving you for a very, very long time.”
“And so it begins,” Sherlock sighs, unlocking his seatbelt.
“Congratulations!” Tom immediately exclaims, a wide grin on his face. “This is marvelous!”
Sherlock exhales loudly against his neck, and John shivers at the faint touch of tongue against his skin. "The stag night," he whispers, and John had been wondering if either of them would be brave enough to talk about it.
“Our talk earlier was rushed,” John replies, having raised himself just a little higher again, their erections no longer touching. “And I’d prefer if-”
5) It’s only fair that I share a secret about you, and if there’s many to choose from, I think this one is the right one for now. I could have dated men after I came back. After the army, after what I experienced there, after realising there was really no shame in being with a man, I could have chosen to date both men and women. But I didn’t, and it has to do with you. Before you start jumping to conclusions, I wasn’t afraid of what you’d say or do - after all, I did tell you it was all fine that first night. No, the thing is, I’ve come to realise that dating women was easy because it wasn’t actually serious, not with any of them. I know, Sarah seemed like a serious enough relationship, but trust me, it was anything but. Dating women was not complicated, while dating men would have started up a conversation that I wasn’t sure I wanted, but mostly because I knew that if I were to seek out a relationship with a man, it would be a serious one. And there was really only one person I’d wish to engage with in such a relationship at the time. Still now.
(020) XXXX XX32
“The guests will understand,” Harriet says, stopping at a red light. “I’m sure most of them bet that something like this would happen.”
_________________________________________________________________________
John turns to smile at him, “Good.”
“Good thing indeed.”
It could be due to Rosie’s recent state of health, but then John is used to dealing with sick patients all the time. But his patients do not sleep at his home and wake him up in the middle of the night. Still, it isn’t the first time Rosie is sick. Shouldn’t he be used to it by now?
Sherlock looks like he’s about to decline but sets the files he’s got in hand on the table instead before sitting down. Breathing in slowly, John places the food on the table and sits next to him, looking down at his plate. “Cases?”
“You’ve only took one sip, John.”
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Sherlock replies, not bothering to look away from his experiment.
“You can say it was, yes,” Sherlock replies, smiling all the same. “The clinic?”
Sherlock and Victor both sit down there, leaving John on the chair.
“Listen kid,” the security guard repeated with a slight german accent and clearly annoyed by Sherlock’s refusal, “this is none of your concern. Please step away.”
“If one of them would have just say someth-” John falls silent,

Sherlock stares at him for a long moment, eyes roaming all over his face, and John lets him read there everything he's feeling in this very moment.
Sherlock pulls away, letting him stand up but not without another kiss first.
tonight. So I guess
His phone buzzing startles him, and John takes it out quickly, unable to repress a laugh when he reads the text.
Christ, I’m nervous
"John only took care of keeping him secure," Sherlock declares, standing up. "That's all."
They've been sitting quietly for a while, John engrossed in his book and Sherlock lost in his mind palace. It has been nice actually, enjoying this unusual silence coming both from the flat and the street. Even Mrs Hudson has let them be despite her usual weekly visit each Tuesday. Sherlock has, of course, used this excuse to go down and check on her. John suspected it was only for the pure pleasure of saying, “I’ve been outside the flat.”
If you wish to continue,
“Stop,” Sherlock looks back at him, shaking his head. “I would have done the same.”
To hell with him and his unconditional love and damn picture!
John hums, leaning back against his chair and letting his lips stretch into a smile when Sherlock stands up. Music fills the air, and with his eyes never leaving Sherlock, John lets all the love he feels for this brilliant man submerge him once more. Only when breathing properly gets harder and harder does he allows himself to close his eyes, letting the music lull him to the edge of sleep.
"Huh."
“Not literally, you fool!” She bumps his elbow.
Whoever Mary really was, the things she left behind were few. Her documented history is short, her paperwork fake. He doesn’t even know if the things she’d brought into their home were things she genuinely liked or if they were there to add to a persona.
"Well of course I can't know that!"  She gives Sherlock a pointed look.  "That's more your job to find out, isn't it?"
He looks as debauched and giddy as John feels. Sherlock’s head is lolling, he brushes his cheek against the inside of John’s thigh, inhaling him. John’s cock jerk at the sight.
This part he knows well, if only clinical and non-sexual.
Damn pickpocket.  He'll need to immobilise Sherlock's thumb so the mild sprain won't become a full-on ligament tear.
He holds his breath, struggling. She’s got him pinned.
John shoos him out of the room.
begins at a young age. If Rosie wants to only wear dresses, when she’s old enough to understand the concept of appearance, that is her prerogative. But he vows to always have trousers on hand, to give her the choice. He picks out the acceptable items and proceeds to order trousers as well as replacements for the clothes he’s discarded.
an abuser. You made an awful but human mistake and you’ve been ready to face the consequences and do better. That’s more than enough for me. So please, for my sanity, let’s move on.”
“Oh, God.”
"Yes, that is interesting," Sherlock says, seemingly unaware of the gravity of the moment.  "
She flicks some ash in the general direction of the neighbour’s lot.
He’d never mentioned it to his therapist. He just couldn’t put it into words. And he felt it was private, too private.
John pulls him up, smiling.
She looks so much like their mum, he thinks, a pang in his chest. Except for the tattoos he knows are hidden under the long sleeves, and piercings gleaming on her eyebrows, in her nose and curling at the edge of her lip. Even though she’s dressed in the loose cardigan, he can tell that she’s very fit, arms muscular.
“I did,” John reiterates. He knows exactly what he did and what it’s called, whether Sherlock sees it or not.
"Too easy," mutters Sherlock.
John twists the wire off the bulge at the top of the bottle and turns to the sun, ever the marksman, to pop the bottle open.  He doesn't see where the cork lands.  When he turns back, he's met by Sherlock's warm smile.
“I’ve never wanted anything more in my life.” He hesitates, but the words jump out of his mouth anyway, ruining it all. “Except cocaine.”
The mats are swapped for dry ones and they lie down on their fronts again.
“I’ve got plenty of scars,” Sherlock murmurs, voice low. “They would make for interesting stories if anyone cared to listen.”
She shrugs. "It's the very items I usually buy."
After bad days, John will provide him with bodily sensations, a piercing focus eliciting a rush of hormones that makes one tension fall away after another until he’s languid, like a piece of clay, held and manipulated by John.
"Won't that make it worse?"  He yawns and rests his eyes for a moment.  "It's like jet lag--you need to stay awake until it's proper bedtime."
Sherlock only smirks and locks himself in a changing cubicle.
"What are you after, John?" Sherlock says, fiddling intensely with the broken shell in his pocket.  "A night of passion?  You know you can find that elsewhere."  He braces for John's answer, pressing the sharpest edge of the shell into the palm of his clenched fist.
Greg gives him a questioning look.  "Pickling club?"
“Sorry, what?”
Sherlock texts him about cases.
It’s a repeated hunt after this little crawler who is gone in an instant, as soon as you blink an eye, already on her way to create the next disaster.
He throws his hands up.  "I don't know!  All I know is that, if there were pickles in all the empty jars, and he's been on MAOIs, then he'd be severely risking his health if he's eaten all those bloody gherkins!"
Catherine had been like a fond, but distant memory or dream. Now she will never be any more than that. He thought he knew the pain of regret. It’d been a constant in his life since the day Sherlock jumped from Barts.
He lets go of John’s hand. He’s being mean. He doesn’t want to be mean to John. But he doesn’t want this- destruction. He’s about to cry.
"And you're positive these are all your receipts?"
Little by little he touches Sherlock’s cheeks, following the cheekbones to his temples, up over his forehead, circling around the scar, then following the brow ridge, and back down all the way to his jawbones, resting his fingertips in the hollow below Sherlock’s earlobes. His left thumb lingers on Sherlock’s bottom lip, feeling the warm huff of breath.
"That was very thoughtful of you," Sherlock says, almost admiringly.
Rosie is at Stella and Ted’s for the night, which Sherlock surely has sussed out. There’s even a cab waiting at the curb. And Sherlock is aglow, enthusiastic about the case, and he wants to share it with John.
John nods.  "Right. I asked her to check for any records of Brian James having an allotment."
“Yeah, it was a pretty fast decision. I had intended to come to your wedding, but you could say a crisis arose. Alcohol poisoning.”
there are several skylights, with the shades open to allow sunlight to filter into the chamber, while the sound of sea waves emanate from hidden speakers, their only company a couple of big potted palm trees.
"It was an anonymous call, probably one of the neighbours," Lestrade says.
”Nothing. Deft hands.”
Then Sherlock texts him even more. Details, clues, the clever solution.
"Bastards!  There's no way I can see the sea from here.  Maybe you can, you tall git."
