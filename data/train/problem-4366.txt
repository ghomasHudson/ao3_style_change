Sam was there. Sam was perfectly fine and smiling at him. Sam had a tail.
anything!’ Gabriel said as he took the towel off his head and wrapped it around his hips. ‘I was just out here taking photos of the island and the reefs. I just wanted to go somewhere that wasn’t a swamp or…or in the middle of the woods. When I heard about the sightings, I came right out. It’s the middle of winter. I didn’t care what it was. I just… I wanted to be warm. And then…’ He moaned helplessly as he buried his face in his hands. ‘It was supposed to be a whale carcass! I had a whole episode planned on rotting whale carcasses and trash being mistaken for sea monsters!’
,’ Azazel growled before leaving the room, shutting the door with a little more force than was necessary.
‘Very.’
Castiel breathed in sharply. His legs shook as he stood. He quickly and quietly made his way back to Dean. He crawled into bed and clung on to Dean.
‘Right. Gonna cut you off right there,’ Sam said, pushing off the counter. ‘Look, Dean… For the most part, humans don’t move as fast as mermaids do.’
Castiel stopped and looked back at Dean. ‘Yes?’
know where Castiel is,’ Crowley said quietly.
‘Not allowed to check on my baby brother?’ the merman asked. His eyes ran over Sam’s body, and he pulled a disgusted face at Sam’s legs. ‘You look awful.’
‘Castiel’s
the only one.’

‘I know what you’re planning,’ Gabriel said.
Castiel straddled Dean’s tail and licked his lips as he wondered where he should start. He startled as fins lightly brushed his sides and Dean’s hands ran up his thighs. He lightly grasped Dean’s hands, stilling them. ‘Just so we’re clear… I’m not having sex with you in this form. We may be able to negotiate handjobs or blow…er…
‘Then how did you and…?’ Karen trailed off, glancing at Castiel and waving her hand in the air in a vague motion.
‘You sayin’ you didn’t like the impromptu bondage?’ Gabriel asked. ‘Never knew pants could be used like that.’
Dean frowned at Castiel. He cleared his throat, and when he failed to gain Castiel’s attention, he reached out, his fingertips barely grazing Castiel’s coat. He huffed in irritation. ‘Y’know, this’d be a lot easier if you’d at least look at me,’ he grumbled.
. He wouldn’t do that,’ he said before stalking off.
to fix the cuff. After he fixed it, well…after was something else altogether.
the funeral director!’ Gabriel cried out. ‘Cas, this is—’
‘Maybe…we could trade a few over a drink sometime,’ Castiel suggested, his smile returning.
'Is this about uh...' Sam trailed off, waving his hand in the air.
Castiel broke down into heaving sobs as the door shut. He hugged himself, wrapping his wings around himself, praying that no one would find him.
‘What? Why?’
‘Dating, proposal…usually with a ring. Mm… Then a wedding and honeymoon,’ Castiel said. ‘Ceremonies can be extravagant or simple. Depends on the couple.’
‘Dean—’ Before Sam could say anything else, Dean was gone. He sighed hopelessly and looked to Gabriel. ‘I’m sure it’ll all work out,’ he said and wrapped his arms around the angel.
your colors with clothes. It’s...I dunno. Weird. Different. But not
Castiel paused at the door and glanced between Sam and Gabriel. ‘I’m used to reading upside down. I’ll borrow the boat again on Thursday.’
‘N-no!! I won’t—hah! Won’t betray Dean! Never!!’ Castiel glared up at Lucifer, his eyes glowing brightly. He reached out with his hand, intent on smiting the other angel.
‘Got it. Um…what’s this hole for?’ Dean asked, poking his fingers through the part in the front. ‘Wait. Is it for fucking around?’
Gabriel paled as he quickly got up. He winced at the crunching sounds as Castiel pushed himself up. ‘Shit, shit, shit… Please tell me it’s something we can fix…’
‘What?!’ Bobby leaned forward and looked from Sam to Castiel. He watched as Castiel hid behind his wings and leaned even further into Dean.
Castiel went back to pulling out the rest of his costume, setting the boots aside. ‘Okay… I’m not ruining my boots, but besides those, what do you want me to wear?’ he asked. He looked up as he heard a splash and watched as Dean squirmed under the water’s surface. He smiled as Dean settled on the side of the pool, resting on his elbows.
Some dialogue lifted from S5E17.
‘What?’ Dean sat up straight with a confused look. ‘What are you on about?’
Balthazar threw his hands in the air as everyone around them laughed. Grumbling about the unfairness in the world, he left the dining room.
He backed away, babbling. ‘Y-you’re a... ‘S’not real! You can’t be… Fuck! A fucking
’ Castiel screamed and leaned into Dean’s chest, cackling. ‘He
'I already know. What I'm getting at is that you didn't hide. I don't know what the future holds, Dean, but things would probably be easier if you went back to not hiding.' She exited the car and waited for Dean.
‘We broke the TV while he was fucking me against the wall, and the hotel is demanding reparation,’ Castiel said evenly. He raised a brow as Gabriel shrank back.
‘I can only imagine what you learned from
‘I have to go!’ Castiel cried. He hugged Dean tightly as the lights softly flickered. ‘I’m sorry!’
‘I’ll have to get new furniture… Nothing matches his color scheme,’ Castiel mumbled as he lightly stroked the fin nearest him. Just days before, he had touched them for the first time. A new species that had gone about courting him the human way
‘Do you think he’ll like me?’
Castiel wished he had his brother’s positive outlook on life.
Castiel stared ahead. ‘Why would I need a whip?’
Charlie swatted at Dean’s tail with her own. ‘

‘Well,
Sam and Gabriel reached the table, and Gabriel forced a smile as they sat down.

‘Hey, I forgive you,’ Gabriel said as he sat up and lightly punched Castiel on the arm.
‘You—’ Gabriel broke off, shaking his head. He didn’t want to get into this conversation with his brother just yet. He was still too worked up about Sam, and Castiel was on the verge of a mental breakdown. When they were both back in their right minds,
‘We don’t need your help,’ Gabriel spat out. He tightened his grip on Sam and pushed their way into the house. Sam shot Dean a worried look as he was dragged out of sight.
'You're missing the point, Cas!' Dean shouted as he turned and took a step towards Castiel. '
Gabriel woke up with a loud snort. He was having such a good dream, but he was pulled out of it by Castiel's anxiety. He wrapped his arms around his brother and snuggled closer. 'I'm tryin' to sleep here, Cas,' he mumbled. 'You can have your stupid panic attack in the morning.'
‘So’s Triton.’ Adam grinned as Lucifer glared at the whited-out sign. ‘How’s about you put the name
Dean cautiously opened another door. Leading with his shotgun, he made his way around the room, rummaging through drawers as he went. If Sam's angel was going to prove useless, then they had better find some information on their ghost. As he exited the room, he was pushed from behind and flattened against the wall.
He gasped as an arm wrapped around him.
Sam stared on in shock. Why couldn’t Karen sense what Crowley was? And, for that matter, why did the demon’s eyes look human? Was he possessing some poor human? And, if that was the case, why were Castiel and Gabriel perfectly fine with it?
He grinned sheepishly at the guard and rubbed the back of his neck in embarrassment. ‘Promiňte…’
Dean laughed and stepped away. He looked over the group in the lobby and locked eyes with the man that fit Castiel’s description of Balthazar. He tilted his chin up and smirked. ‘Have fun, you two,’ he said.
.-.-.-.-.
Dean gently rubbed the area he had just spanked. ‘Face forward and try not to move.’
‘She wouldn’t want you to mourn her forever,’ Dean said.
He was obsessed. As Sam was quick to point out, Dean was getting distracted from the task at hand. He had brushed off Sam’s criticisms, but, now, he wished he had paid Sam’s warning a little more heed.
‘So if we angel-proofed the place, would you let Cas and Gabe stay?’ Dean asked. He had his hand resting on one of Castiel’s wings, lightly scratching it.
Dean laughed. ‘Why are you questioning it?’
‘But you just put it through your skin!’
‘This feels weird,’ Dean replied, constantly shifting and tugging at the loose fabric.
Gabriel sagged. ‘Oh. That’s good.’
Dean could just make out blue eyes, and he grinned to himself. It was the same person! His smile fell as he actually thought about it. He slumped back and rested the binoculars on his knee. So what? Some hot European guy runs around Europe. So what if Dean had kissed the mystery man? So what if he had kissed back? The most Dean could ever hope for would be a drink and a one night stand. Not the worst outcome, to be sure.
‘Well… If that’s what you want.’
power?’
Castiel suck in his lower lip and looked away. He rubbed his hand across his mouth and down his cheek before looking back at Balthazar. ‘More like…seven.’
‘Seriously?!’
Gabriel looked around and pulled Balthazar aside by the elbow. ‘Wait, wait, wait… He

time he stopped hiding.
.-.-.-.-.
‘O-okay… Um…could you keep doing that? With your thumb, I mean?’ Gabriel asked shyly. He bit his lip and offered a shy smile for extra measure. ‘It’s…comforting.’
‘Shooting some scenes,’ Castiel replied. ‘I still have to work while I’m here, but I will make time for us.’ He groaned miserably as he dropped his head onto Dean’s chest. ‘Balthazar’s gonna want to go back to our original schedule…’
‘For what?’ Bobby asked, not bothering to hide the suspicion in his voice.
Castiel pulled Dean’s hand closer to his face and examined it. ‘And what is it? Is it more like spit, nasal mucus, or vaginal fluids?’ he asked as he sniffed at Dean’s fingers.
‘You put this in that stuff you made,’ Castiel said quietly. ‘My back looks a lot better than it should.’
.-.-.-.-.
‘I think so. Gabriel’s completely against it.’
‘Oh, yeah. Dean. Sam’s brother,’ Gabriel said with a smile. ‘Sam’s pissed that he’s here. I intend to comfort him.’
Ellen nodded as Jo buried her face in her hands, shaking her head. ‘Him and his brother are pretty well known in the Hunter world.’
could?’ Castiel asked.
Sam sighed as he stared down at Gabriel. Asleep, the agent looked sweet and innocent. It was a drastic change from the playful smile. Now that Dean was safe and no one was threatening him, he could take the moment to appreciate how the man looked. Soft, golden hair, lightly tanned skin, perfectly manicured nails… The agent definitely took care of himself. A far cry from Castiel’s mussed hair, five o’clock shadow, and ragged nails. There was something else… He could have sworn he’d seen the man before. He shrugged the thought away, believing that he had probably seen the agent in the background on occasion.

the cameraman. I’m here to do my job.’
‘So… Gabriel says Castiel killed three. One right after the other. On accident.’
Dean reluctantly let go. ‘But it feels good. A lot better than normal me. And it looks weird. Do they all look like this?’ he asked in a worried tone.
Alastair leaned back and casually wiped the spit from his cheek. He clicked his tongue as he shook his head. ‘No, Dean. I intend to do my best,’ he replied. He brought his arm back and swung out, slamming the pliers against Dean’s jaw.
‘And what’s that?’ Dean asked.
things about being on TV?’ Dean asked as he settled next to Castiel.
Castiel stared at Anna for a minute before his coat and jacket vanished. ‘We’re going slow, right?’ He gasped when Anna surged forward, grabbed him by his tie and shoved him to the ground. He scrambled away, wings raised and spread. Shakily, he stood, keeping an eye on the other angel. His eyes flicked to Crowley, who watched impassively. He frowned when Crowley tilted his head and raised a brow.
‘Even if there
‘None of them lead to Castiel’s room,’ Michael pointed out in monotone.
‘I wouldn’t consider it minor,’ Anna grumbled, crossing her arms.
‘Dark blue and eight-inch teeth? The crap that guy was pulling outta his ass… We’ve reached the point where stories are starting to conflict,’ Charlie said as she sat across from Gabriel and grabbed a glass. ‘I mean, it’s annoying, but it
‘First and last name… I was named after the uh…Winchester Mystery House,’ Sam replied. ‘I chose “Sam” for myself. I guess…you would be “Winchester,” too.’
‘Hey…I’ll be careful.’
‘Balthazar’s one of
‘Well, when I leave,’ Castiel replied. ‘Long distance relationships don’t always work out.’
For two hours, Dean had Castiel perform simple, stupid tasks. They ended up sitting on the floor of Sam’s bedroom. ‘Touch your nose! Touch
‘Ready? Or are you having fun down there?’ Sam teased as he pulled out his fingers.
Castiel stared at Dean. His outbursts had never harmed electronic equipment. Sure, if there was glass involved, it was more susceptible to damage, but the wiring remained unaffected. The computer screen had no glass. His feathers ruffled as he realized what was going on. But he wanted to make sure. ‘Balthazar asked me about our relationship… Did…did Anna speak with you?’
Anna avoided Karen’s gaze and stepped out of the room. ‘We should get back,’ she said quietly.
‘Can we watch Hellraiser next time? I love the designs of the cenobites! I painted a few pieces inspired by them. Apparently, I traded one for some ink.’
With Mary's death, John took up the title of Hunter. He needed to find the demon that killed Mary and avenge her death. His two sons were living the life that every young boy wanted. Traveling, seeing the world, and hunting monsters. John quickly earned a name for himself. He was an excellent Hunter. And he did it all without the aid of an angel. At least, that was what the outside world saw. What Sam and Dean saw was another story. Their father was desperate to find an angel. An angel would be able to help him track down the demon that killed his wife.
‘Muffin! Shoo!’ Castiel hissed as he pushed the cat away with his foot. ‘Sorry, he just likes to…investigate. Um…he’s… Muffin’s…a uh…good cat.’
Dean had a shit-eating grin plastered on his face as he waved to the angel. He didn't envy Gabriel one bit—he knew how his brother could get with research.
Sam returned with the food. Dean happily took the pie off his brother's hands, guarding it from potential thieves as he ate his cheeseburger. And then it was back to the monotony of sorting.
‘I don’t wanna hear it. I’m a slut. I know. And you know what?
‘What? No, you haven’t!’ Dean argued. ‘Sure, you’ve been kinda annoying, but… Well, you’ve made me feel so…so special. I don’t get much of that, so it kinda balances out, I guess.’ He laid his head on Castiel’s knee and smiled up at him.
‘It did,’ Michael admitted. ‘So I sent Balthazar in to find out why a demon would go to all that trouble for an angel.’
Castiel clicked on the ‘reply’ button. He wished he could come up with some way to let his brother down nicely, but it was impossible. There was no nice way of saying ‘no’ without Gabriel actually
Dean smiled back. ‘Nice favor,’ he replied. He chuckled as he watched Castiel’s wings slowly fade back to black. ‘Hey, you’re wings are going back to normal!’
Dean stared at Benny for a minute. ‘Uh… One’s a thingy that’s uh…’ He tried to show the shape with his hands. ‘Like a… Just…things. Please?’ He shrugged helplessly as Benny laughed.
Some Dialogue lifted from S4E3 and S4E4.
Castiel closed his eyes and turned the corner. ‘I’m taking this,’ he raised the camera, ‘and these,’ he raised his other arm where he had his wetsuit draped and shook the keys to the boat. ‘I’ll be back later. Don’t worry about me.’
'Castiel.'
‘And he gave me strict instructions to stay the fuck away from you.’
‘Really wish I’d known about this side of you sooner,’ Balthazar said as he sipped at a beer. ‘Drinking games… Think of all the strip poker we coulda played!’
control it.’
,’ he managed to say as he peeled off with renewed laughter.
Castiel stumbled into the water, blushing brightly. He couldn’t remember if he had told Dean about his short stripping stint or not. ‘W-what?’ he asked, trying to come off as if he didn’t understand the reference, but his voice shook too much to come off as casual.
Gabriel let out a self-conscious cough. 'Ah...'
Castiel reached back and brushed off some of the crusted blood. ‘That’ll wipe off…’
Dean suddenly felt very self-conscious of his own tattered wings that would never heal, so he kept them well hidden. How did a lowly soldier end up with such beautiful wings? It made him so angry and jealous. He lashed out the only way he could. He lashed out like a human. Bullets did nothing, but he didn't care. He wasn't thinking straight.
Some dialogue lifted from S5E09.
‘Do I even want to know what’s in the box?’
‘You’re lying. Dean… I can’t fight. Not like this.’ Castiel’s wings dropped as he rubbed at his wrist. ‘I can barely even fight using my powers.’
The front door opened with a soft chime, and Castiel and Dean entered. Castiel was frowning at Dean as he spoke. ‘You keep calling her that. Why? I don’t get the reference.’
‘Shh… It’ll be fine,’ Dean cooed as he hugged Castiel’s legs. ‘We’ll grow old together and shrivel up into little…wrinkly…things. And get grey hair together and go bald…and have really bad eyes.’ He smiled as Castiel lifted his head, still a picture of pure misery.
‘Fan mail?’ Castiel asked uneasily. He had only been on screen a few times for the various documentaries he had worked on. He preferred the behind the scenes work: research, location scouting, and animal wrangling. There was one documentary where he had actually spoken on camera, and he had received one piece of fan mail. It had been addressed to ‘the guy with the sex hair, blue eyes, and bedroom voice.’ The contents of the letter had him worried over the sender’s sanity.
Charlie quickly brought up her tail and smacked Castiel on the side, pushing him over. ‘Let’s see
anything with it, but if you’re not comfortable with me seeing him, then I understand,’ Castiel explained.
‘Dead,’ Dean slurred. ‘Numb…hungry. Haven’t eaten since yesterday.’
He frowned at his feet. Sam was still the man he fell in love with. The only thing that had changed was the packaging. And even that was temporary. It was like finding out his lover was actually bald—which had happened once, and after ten minutes of laughing and wearing the wig, his romance had carried on as if nothing had happened. This was just a little more…surprising.
‘Get your elbows off the table!’
‘And you called me
Sam laughed. ‘Dean falls fast and hard,’ he replied as his fingers dug deeper into the golden feathers.
Castiel reached the dock where the ferry to the Four Seasons regularly stopped. He sat on a bench and waited as he mulled over his possible options.
All eyes turned to Karen, and she puffed her wings slightly. ‘We’ve never had a problem until you. And, yes, I should have kept a closer eye on those two,’ she said, indicating Anna and Balthazar. ‘But I did a sweep of the property after finding out about you, and the only tampering that’s been done has been on the main path leadin’ up to here. My home
Dean placed his hand behind Castiel’s neck and pulled him down. ‘Yeah. Wanna feel you deep inside me,’ he softly replied. ‘Then

your roomies!’
‘You’re just jealous!’ Castiel gasped as the pillow was wrenched from his hands. He lost his balance as Gabriel twisted beneath him and soon found himself beneath his brother. He squirmed and immediately froze as he felt something beneath him break and push into his back.
cowboys,’ Dean grumbled, crossing his arms.
'But...I don't like wendigoes,' Castiel said.
‘That’s why
Karen walked past the four boys and up to Crowley. ‘I’m so sorry for their rude behavior! I’ve taught them better,’ she said glaring over her shoulder.
Gabriel tentatively knocked on Sam’s door. He rocked back and forth on his feet as he waited. The door opened, revealing Dean. ‘Hey…uh…Dean-o. Sam in there?’
‘Castiel. And again, thank you,’ Castiel said as he shook Benny’s hand.
.-.-.-.-.
Dean clapped Gabriel on the back as he walked past and headed towards a hallway. 'We'll get icecream after, short stack.'
‘Purple and green. He’s your sea serpent,’ Castiel explained.
‘Dean’s soul is pure…’
Castiel nodded. ‘Since I was thirteen. It was part of the sex talk, so I assumed it was in some way related.’
Castiel hurried to edge and peeked over, seeing no sign of Dean. ‘Dean?’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Like you?’
Sam moaned as he kept himself from thrusting up as his cock was surrounded by lightly clenching warmth. Almost immediately, Gabriel began rocking his hips, and Sam thrusted in time. He tugged Gabriel down and kissed him deeply, cutting off Gabriel’s new line of begging.
‘Whatcha hidin’ down here for?’ Balthazar asked as he sat next to Castiel on the cot.
still alive… You look disgusting,’ he croaked.
‘Unicorns? What does that have to do with anything? No, it’s…,’ Sam trailed off. He didn’t want to use the ‘it’s not you, it’s me’ line. He reminded himself that Charlie worked with Gabriel, and the two seemed to know each other fairly well. He could try dating Gabriel for the short time that the crew would be there, see if it went anywhere. If Gabriel was worth trusting. ‘Actually, I guess…I could show you around the island tomorrow,’ he said. ‘Private tour?’
'I have to say, I was not expecting that,' Pamela said, breaking the tense silence.
name?’ he said and began sucking on Jimmy’s neck.
'Down.'
Gabriel stiffened at Crowley’s name. ‘You’re…on good terms with Crowley?’ he asked, not sure if he’d like the answer.
‘What are you talking about?’
‘Dean Winchester…’ Dean floated back a few feet as he stared up at the darkening sky. ‘Okay. I’ll take it.’
to smite.’
Sam blushed and smiled awkwardly. ‘That’s one reason…’
Castiel smiled and leaned back on the bed. ‘And then he just flopped up on deck. I went off on him. Thought that he and Benny were behind a hoax. And then I realized…it wasn’t,’ he said, trailing off. ‘…He’s… His patterns follow the inconsistencies of his skin tone as a human.’
Sam slowly shook his head. ‘Sorry… I just know what Dean told me.’
Dean recalled one of the pornos that Castiel had listed, and hoped he could hit two birds with one stone—learning from what the other did, and possibly giving Castiel what he wanted. ‘Well, I wouldn’t mind feeling your cock inside me,’ he replied, running his hand up Castiel’s thigh and under the soft, light colored boxers.
‘The sort that keep my boys
here?!’ Gabriel cried out over his brother.
‘Then why didn’t you—‘
Dean stared at Bobby with his mouth hanging open. ‘What the fuck? They sends

‘What have
?! Oh, my God! He was right! I’ll never live it down!’ Castiel broke down in a fits of sobs. He flinched away as Dean tried to touch his hair again. ‘Don’t look at it,’ he moaned.
Dean nodded as he threw his arm around Castiel, pulling his angel close to make more room on the couch.
‘Thank—The fuck?! That’s
‘I’m sure it’s not as bad as you think,’ Sam said. Even he didn’t buy the words that came out of his mouth.
‘I can’t swim. Will this be a problem?’ Gabriel asked.
‘And what am I pretending to be?’ Castiel asked as he turned to face Balthazar. His good mood from earlier was quickly fading.
Sam shook his head and glanced back up at Gabriel. ‘Don’t I wish. No. You can book a room through our site or other travel sites, but it’s a fixed price. We’ll usually work with you if you actually call or email us. Uh… That’s how you guys got such a good deal. I think we were the third place that uh…Alfie tried.’
‘Then let me repeat myself. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?’
. We’ll retire for drinks and dessert back at the bungalow,’ Crowley replied. He smirked and nodded to himself. ‘I think it will be more fun to watch them stew before then. Hm… Casually slipping the reveal into conversation. Like when I found out about the orgies. The look on your face…’
Castiel shifted his stare to Dean. ‘Really. Good looking guy like you?’ he said incredulously. ‘I find that hard to believe.’
owned. ‘Yeah… Might just have to do that…’ He glanced at Sam, and caught the dismayed grimaced. The shirt was quickly pulled from his grasp, and he stared at Charlie in confusion as the redhead clutched the shirt to her chest.

to recognize him. He just jumped right out.
Dean grinned at his brother. ‘Both?’ he picked at a loose thread on the couch before looking back up at Sam. ‘So, you finally asked that weirdo out?’
‘And this has to do with…’
Dean frowned in disappointment. He brought his legs to his chest and stared at his ankles. He knew he would have to spread his legs apart at some point. He tried wiggling the toes on just one foot, but it wasn’t working. He sighed in irritation as he grabbed one of his legs, placing a hand between his knees, then tried to straighten the other.
Balthazar let out a laugh. ‘Sure, you’re not. You’re fantastic at keeping dust bunnies off the couch,’ he said as he ruffled Castiel’s hair. He turned away and entered the house, leaving Dean and Castiel alone on the porch.
‘Wait, wait, wait!’ Charlie jogged up to Castiel’s side and nudged him. ‘So you and Dean are a thing? Like, a…real deal thing? He doesn’t have to worry about stupid ol’ Bal ruining everything?’
‘Stand up, Castiel.’
Castiel settled back against his chair as Anna gave a determined nod. He tried to reach out to Gabriel, but received no response, so he sent his misery Dean’s way. His wings got ruffled as Dean replied with happy thoughts.
With a few beats from his fins, he was hovering just above the ocean floor. He stretched his fins as far as he could and grinned. He couldn’t compete as a human, but he could definitely compete as a mermaid. And he would win.
Charlie tilted her head and smiled softly up at Sam. ‘That’s sweet…’
Castiel stared in awe. None of the stories did the older angle justice. The inner light from his Grace was dim, certainly not enough to overpower the light cast by the holy fire. His wyvern-shaped body was sleek with scales that glittered like the night sky and spotted with peacock feathers; his belly shone brightly in the palest hue of blue, the same color as the feathers shaping his ears. Castiel could just imagine what the blood-red wings would have looked like untouched.
Castiel stared ahead. ‘I-I’d rather not talk about it.’
Sam gently patted Dean’s arm and smiled encouragingly. ‘That’s nice, Dean.’ He jumped when a poppy tune erupted and watched as Gabriel fumbled with a small phone.
‘And since you’re in good mood, we can tape you stripping,’ Balthazar said. He laughed at Castiel’s grimace as he stood. ‘Think of it this way: you can show your boyfriend later. Maybe
‘They can have their little…wedding or whatever in the middle of the ocean,’ Crowley argued. ‘They had their chance to do it here.’
‘Everything in the right place… Good size. Nice color and markings,’ he said as he ran his finger along the inside of the slit. He pulled out his finger out and rubbed his forefinger and thumb together, spreading the thin mucus he had gathered. ‘Right amount of this stuff.’
‘I’m sorry,’ Castiel said between giggles. ‘Really, I am. If it makes you feel any better, I get quite passionate about inaccuracies in movies when I’m drunk.’
your dad?' Dean asked.
Sam shook his head. ‘Sorry. I have a few things I need to do that are guaranteed to get me dirty. I was gonna take a shower after I finished,’ he said. He was only partly lying.
He said the first thing that came to mind. 'Who are you?'
Crowley scoffed and held the gun out. ‘It’s not loaded. I’m making an offer, you imbecile.’
‘I don’t get it.’
Balthazar looked doubtful. ‘And what about you?’ he asked, looking between Sam and Gabriel. ‘Are
exist!’ Gabriel said, waving at Sam’s tail. It was no wonder his brother had reached the breaking point.
‘I thought you wanted him to be happy?’ Samandriel replied with a shrug. ‘Aren’t we supposed to be making his transition to film nice and easy?’
Gabriel smiled brightly at Sam and gave him a quick nod and a thumbs up. ‘Great! So he fits right in, huh?’
A soft knock drew the brothers’ attention to the door. ‘It’s open,’ Gabriel said as he set the binoculars on the windowsill.
Jo lightly punched Dean in the arm. ‘Shut up!’ She looped her arm through his and leaned her head on his shoulder as they descended the steps. ‘You set everything up all right?’
‘So the filing cabinet would keep it shut,’ Gabriel proudly replied. ‘Smart, right?’
Sam kept pace with Dean and, in a hushed tone, asked, 'Was it that bad? It couldn't have been worse than Gabriel's first hunt, right?'
‘Nice…,’ Balthazar blandly repeated. ‘Not cute? Hot? Sexy?’
Castiel glared at Anna as he laced his fingers tightly through Dean’s. ‘Everything
‘Ever had pool sex?’ Castiel asked.
‘What?’
‘Oh! What shape is the head? What sort of species would you compare it to?’
not ashamed of him!' Dean declared as he marched out of the room.
tested? Had Castiel been sent to tempt him? Did it even matter? He felt like he was so far gone that nothing he did would ever redeem him in his Father's eyes.
‘I don’t know!’ Benny shouted. He took a deep breath and gave Dean an apologetic look. ‘I don’t know. You look fine. You look…normal.’
His legs felt like jelly, and he stumbled as he stepped onto the pier. Warily, he made his way back to the hotel. Even if he wanted to go somewhere else, he would need to get his stuff first. But how would he justify it to the rest of the crew without sounding crazy?
Castiel shook his head. ‘Just…saying goodbye.’
Dean gave Castiel a sidelong glance. ‘Really? Y’know… Indiana Jones?’
Dean glanced around the barn. What was taking so long? He closed his eyes and prepared to make what would rank high up on the list of stupid things he had done. If Anna thought Castiel wasn't truly sorry for having to obey orders, how would she feel about Dean's complete lack of regret for using her? If she felt any remote semblance to human emotion, how much would she regret kissing him? He exhaled slowly.
‘Well, I was pretty drunk at the time,’ Castiel replied, ducking his head at Balthazar’s annoyed grunt. ‘I either forget things or make them up. Or uh… Look, I am so,
‘Dean—’
have tried saving Jess, instead of focusing on Sam. But Sam was with him now. He could keep an eye on Sam. Keep him on the right path. Make certain that he made the right choice in the end. It did not help that Sam was a constant reminder of the brother he once knew. Lucifer, brave and beautiful, so loving, and always questioning Father.
Did someone pull him out? He remembered being on the pier, soaking wet. Green eyes. He remembered beautiful green eyes and a great smile. And…Dean. Dean was the man’s name. He had made out with a hot stranger on the old pier. A hot, naked stranger. While he was completely shitfaced. Right. Of course.
‘I don’t know what you’re talking about,’ Jimmy replied.
Castiel huffed in irritation. ‘Gabriel, I’m fine. I…I
Ms. Skrims brought her other hand to her mouth and blinked rapidly at the new information. ‘Oh! Oh, yes. That explains so much!’ She smiled as she leered at Dean. ‘Your husband is a lucky man… Will you introduce us?’
know that?’ he asked.
Gabriel groaned in frustration. He stared at the engine and frowned. He could feel traces of Balthazar’s energy lingering. ‘What’s wrong with your car?’
‘Oh, yes! I went by there this morning looking for you,’ Castiel said, then ducked his head when he realized what he had just admitted to.
get his, and, well, neither do you, but sometimes the sacrifice is worth it for the other guy to suffer. Right?’
‘Really? He didn’t come back, Sam. And that…that other guy’s with him!’ Dean was sprawled across Sam’s bed, staring up at the ceiling. ‘I knew I shouldn’t have bothered… I can’t get a mermaid. Why the hell did I think I could get a human mate?!’
‘What? Sam’s fine,’ Dean replied. He looked over Castiel’s shoulder to see Sam and Gabriel entering the room with surprised expressions.
nuts on me,’ Charlie replied, pinching her fingers together. ‘Eventually made it back to the water. Well, enough to get wet. And I…broke her.’
‘And it won’t work… Wait!’ Sam grabbed Gabriel’s wrist and inspected the sigils. He ran his fingertips over the outer edge of one of the minor circles. ‘These are for channeling. The cuff…the actual binding
Charlie and Samandriel grinned at the baffled expressions they were receiving, along with an agreeing nod from Dean.
‘I’m not giving you a choice,’ Crowley said in an exasperated tone. ‘You begin tomorrow. Anna, do what you have to. If you need any targets, I’ll arrange for them to be sent.’
Gabriel snatched the case away and clutched it to his chest. ‘I’m not going to
Castiel was trying desperately to be quiet.  He resorted to covering his mouth with a towel to drown out the sounds he was making. Unlike Dean’s last exploration of his wings, Castiel felt no guilt or embarrassment through the cuff’s link. It was just pure need and want. And every time he made a noise, it would intensify, sending waves a pleasure and anticipation through his body. He gasped as Dean reached under his wing and began stroking the inner side. He leaned back against Dean with a low groan and rested his head on Dean’s shoulder.
Gabriel looked over his shoulder and gave Sam a grateful smile. ‘I just… I never knew. Even…even
Gabriel’s legs gave out, and he shouted as he came, Sam’s cock buried deep in his ass. He spasmed as Sam pulled him forward and hugged him close, fucking him to completion.
‘I’m okay,’ Dean said after he shoved Benny off. ‘Just…uh… Weak ankles. Or something.’
‘Me neither. If it’s any consolation… I never thought I’d be attracted to a human. You think
Charlie looked up, grinning. ‘I love body glitter! Dean, you’ll love it! It’s the best invention
.-.-.-.-.
Karen stared ahead at the wall, pausing from kneading the meatloaf. She never thought Dean would be able to come up with something like that on his own. Or anyone. No Hunter had ever attempted to change the spellwork. She looked back at Dean, clearly impressed. ‘The cuffs haven’t been changed in centuries!’
He shifted his gaze to Gabriel’s hands, busy with turning the beer bottle to face forward. He reached out and took Gabriel’s hand in his.
touch him.’
Castiel shrugged as he nodded. He trusted Dean not to accidentally drown him, but he didn’t know just what was expected from his end. Were there words? Squeaks or whistles he was supposed to make? ‘I’m sure Dean would have guided me along just fine,’ he said as Dean nodded along.
‘But I like this shirt. The front’s still okay.’
a cot under my bed,’ Sam said.
‘Word of advice, Sam: Keep an eye on your idiot brother before he gets himself killed,’ Gabriel said.
‘You can’t do it here?’ Dean asked, disappointed.
‘The hell is that?!’ Bobby shouted, covering his ears. He looked over to see Castiel staring at nothing, a soft smile on his face.
Dean looked around, panic and uncertainty creeping into his stomach.
The angel sighed before sticking his hand out in greeting with a big smile plastered across his face. 'Name's Gabriel.'
Charlie smiled and gave a bashful shrug. ‘I’m still me,’ she replied. ‘Uh, how are—oh!’ She was pushed out of the way by Dean, and she threw him a glare.
Crowley looked away in thought and back to Dean. Nothing in the paperwork had mentioned coming across other mermaids—and he knew the agreement inside and out. ‘I suppose you’re the exception,’ he relented.
'I-I had no idea. … I understand. … I'll do that. … Yeah, you, too. … Bye.' Gabriel closed the phone and stared at Castiel. 'Dad's sending bodyguards,' he finally said.
Dean smiled and lightly kissed Castiel’s lips. ‘Won’t tell you not to worry about it, ‘cuz I know you will anyway. But…I think things’ll be just fine.’
mermaid looks like,’ Dean said, unable to keep the bitterness from his voice.
‘Well, everyone reacts to stress differently,’ she replied. ‘He’s probably just running things through his head. Figuring everything out.’
Castiel growled in frustration at the cuff’s tug. ‘Advice on flirting,’ he quietly snapped.
‘I’ve seen it done, yes.’
Gabriel paced back and forth in Sam’s bedroom. ‘Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry,’ he chanted as his wings flicked out in distress.
something?’
Dean sat on the cushions lining the bay window of his hotel room. The window looked out on a small market square. They had another five hours to wait until their appointed meeting, so Dean was entertaining himself by watching the people pass by under his window.
Sam stared ahead as his grip on the steering wheel tightened. He refused to be baited by Dean. Again.
Sam followed Dean’s gaze. ‘Yeah… I don’t know when they’re planning on filming,’ Sam said. ‘They’ve booked their rooms until the end of next month.’
mad at
‘What? Lucifer?’
Castiel felt lighter at Dean’s  excitement running through the cuff’s link. Lucifer didn’t know what he was talking about. The Winchester brothers were not going to enslave angels and demons. They were going to make things
Sam waved Dean over as he headed to the partially opened door next to his closet. ‘C’mon. I’ll explain toilets and save you some of the embarrassment of figuring it out on your own.’
As Anna explained how things worked in Heaven, he began to have doubts. Nothing seemed right. You weren't
Castiel jumped and looked up, shocked to see Dean standing there. ‘Hello, Dean.’
Balthazar dropped his fork and stared in horror at Castiel. ‘What did you do?!’ he hissed.
‘A lot better than human me,’ Dean admitted. ‘How can you stand i—oh!’ He bit off a cry as Castiel’s fingers pressed along the sides of his slit, and he slipped down, sending Castiel falling forward onto his chest.
Dean clicked in reply and backed up to get the same running start.
Sam looked up at Bobby then to Dean. 'Elm Creek? We were just there,' he said. 'Do you think...do you think Seraphiel was there because of us? Could he be working with Lucifer?'
‘It’s different,’ Sam replied. ‘It’s not rubbing your cock against another and fucking their uh…er…pouch?’ he said, struggling for the right words. ‘You might not like it…’
Sam sighed and nodded. ‘I still think this is a bad idea.’ He shook his head with a sigh and looked around his room. ‘I guess I can find a mattress or a cot or something for you… Uh… How much did Benny explain to you about…well, everything?’ he asked. If his brother was intent on ‘chasing a mate,’ then Sam needed to make sure that Dean wouldn’t end up blowing his cover. And certainly not around the marine biologist.
It was so different from kissing Anna. There was no emptiness, no wrongness. Surprise and desire flitted from Castiel into Dean, egging him on. Dean smiled into the kiss as Castiel tried to participate. He caught images of how much Castiel had seen humans do with each other, and he sent little promises back. He’d be more than happy to be Castiel’s Sex Ed teacher. It was when Dean’s hands made it to Castiel’s belt that he felt Castiel’s distress over his inexperience flare up.
Karen looked from Castiel to Crowley and back. ‘I’m not going to kill him, sweetie. I’m just going to detain him,’ she explained. ‘You’re father’s possessed.’
‘Then why don’t ya’?’ Bobby asked.
it was to make sure no one found out?’ Castiel asked, raising his head. He let Balthazar pull him into a hug as he closed his eyes. ‘I’ve tried so hard to leave everything behind. To be the proper scientist I’m supposed to be. All this…’ He waved his hand at the camera equipment and scuba gear. ‘I would have been all for this during college. Going off on adventures…’
Some dialogue lifted from S4E22.
Meg rolled her eyes as she nodded.
!’ Castiel grabbed Gabriel by the collar and tried to shove him out the door.
A soft glint caught Karen's attention. The boy was holding the remote control, and on his wrist was a binding cuff. Her eyes shifted back up, and she gave the young angel a warm smile.
‘We need to work on the soundtrack,’ Samandriel said, keeping his eyes glued to the ceiling. ‘Charlie’s got everything set up in your room, and I already have some breakfast waiting.’
‘Sorry!’ Sam apologized, dropping the cotton ball onto the desk. He ran his thumb across the side of Gabriel’s hand as he pulled out the bottle of alcohol. ‘Now…this
‘Human custom,’ Crowley replied. He sighed as Dean began clicking at him again. ‘Oh, do stop. You’re not impressing anyone.’
‘Of course I could!’ Dean said more forcefully than he’d intended.
‘That must be nice,’ Anna said. At Dean’s scoff, she went on. ‘I’ve never experienced it myself, but I’ve heard that it is one of the most satisfying connections an angel can make with another being.’
Castiel slowly trudged back into the living room and slumped onto the couch next to Dean. ‘I…I’m gonna just sit here…’
Castiel squeaked and almost dropped the remote. No one, other than family, had ever touched his wings before. He didn't think anyone even wanted to. The few other angels he had met always stared at his wings and did their best to avoid him. He turned to look at Dean, but found himself alone. He sighed and fiddled with the remote in his hands. A soft ringing drew his attention to his pocket. He turned off the TV and set down the remote before fishing out the cellphone. 'Hello, Father.'
Gabriel stared dumbly at Dean. He looked up at Sam, who gave him a shrug. ‘Er… He likes fish?’ he said, looking back at Dean. ‘Hey, up until a few days ago, I thought my brother was this super-innocent, naïve, little angel that liked dive bars for whatever reason. Turns out, he’s a man-whore. A kinky one. Even Bal didn’t know about the weird crap he’s into. So, uh… Fish and sex?’ He pulled a face as he mentally repeated what he had said. ‘That came out wrong. He likes to study fish, and he likes to study human anatomy in the most intimate way possible.’
‘You’re not exactly a prime specimen, now, are you?’ Crowley countered. He tilted his head and smirked as Dean deflated under his gaze. ‘Ruined fins, bad coloration… Granted, you’re a rare one, but not a good choice for publicity. If I were to go public with mermaids, I would want a perfect specimen. Not
Castiel ignored Crowley, lost in his own world of misery. How was he going to make up his behavior to Dean? As his thoughts drifted back to his apartment, he realized he wasn’t prepared to bring home a mermaid. It wasn’t very large, and all he had was a fifty-gallon fish tank. And
He smiled to himself. It would be great, but not perfect. Perfect would be if his romantic interest was a little shy. A small fantasy played out in head.
'No! You need to test it. Act out, force him to snap at you. If it's meant to be, if he
‘You’re
‘He’s with Dean,’ Sam replied with an amused smile.
Dean smiled and kissed Castiel. ‘Good to hear.’
‘What?’
Castiel stared at his feet. ‘Dean isn’t like that,’ he insisted. ‘His soul is pure. He wants to help.’ He shivered when Lucifer lifted his chin. The sad look he received made him feel confused.
about this, I’ll…I’ll do something drastic.’
Dean nodded and kissed Castiel’s knee before laying his head on it, waiting as patiently as he could.
‘Oh, and your boyfriend called.’
Dean pushed Sam towards Castiel and gave him a pleading stare.
‘I finally have something in common with my brother, and he’s managed to out-whore me,’ Gabriel complained before taking a long swig of his drink. ‘Something’s wrong with me. Sam, what’s wrong with me?’ he asked, tilting his head back as Sam passed by, collecting empty glasses.
‘Besides you?’ Gabriel replied with a smirk. He laughed as Sam rolled his eyes. ‘Okay. Um… Nothing I can’t get away from. I don’t need to be there for interviews. And we can always reschedule my scenes. Yeah… That might actually be better. Get all the new
‘I’m fine, Sammy.’ He sighed as he sat up. He stood and headed toward the door.
Castiel pulled a confused frown. ‘That doesn’t make sense. You don’t like me, but you wouldn’t hurt me. Nothing that I wouldn’t be able to recover from, at least.’
‘I’ve been researching these damn binding cuffs and their spells for a week!’ Dean replied. He scooped up some potato chunks and set them in the bowl of water. ‘I know way too much about the spells that go into them.’ He shrugged as he started on another potato. ‘But…it helped with coming up with a new spell.’
.-.-.-.-.
season two if we get signed on,’ Gabriel said in a rush as he darted for the door. He didn’t stop as he heard Castiel screech and Muffin hiss. He burst through the door and threw himself down the hallway toward the stairs. He half-fell down the wooden steps and kept running when he reached the bottom. He was almost to safety. Someone was bound to be in the lobby. A few more feet and… He looked over his shoulder, relieved to find that Castiel was nowhere to be seen. His foot caught the edge of a rug and he went flying, taking a vase of flowers with him.
‘Fine. Dean. You can’t trust that…that pirate,’ Sam said. ‘He’s been to prison.’ Dean stared at him in confusion. ‘That’s where humans send people that do bad things.’
Gabriel licked his lips and giggled. ‘I’m not exactly stopping you…’
thick,’ Gabriel said lewdly. He squeaked in surprise as Sam pulled his legs up and ground hard against his ass. ‘Oh…fuck…’
Castiel got into sitting position and crossed his legs. He leaned forward and narrowed his eyes. ‘Are you skinny dipping?’ he asked suspiciously, his eyes dipping down.
?! What the hell?! This isn’t real! This is a joke! God, please let this be joke!’
‘Hey. I know this guy, Zachariah. Okay looking, but not exactly gonna be winning any beauty pageants. Way off the deep end on documentaries. In person, he’s normal. Still believes everything he says in interviews, but he totally plays it up for the camera. We’re not actors, but we’re still in show business,’ Gabriel said. ‘My looks may have played in my favor for getting my own show, but I got
‘So we can get to know each other better,’ Dean replied. He stuck his tongue out and lightly licked Castiel’s lips.
Dean followed Castiel’s lead, matching and imitating movements. Castiel’s tongue dipped into his mouth and swirled against his own tongue, and he groaned loudly. He was leaning over Castiel, covering half his body with his own, his fins spread as far as they could go.
Dean grinned. ‘I figured it out,’ he said smugly. ‘Now, come here and hug me!’
‘Oh! Yeah. That, too!’ he agreed. ‘And a shot of you pulling your goggles off and shaking out your hair.’
Sam, Dean, Gabriel, and Crowley looked over at Karen, none of them surprised.
‘Of course!’ Gabriel shifted in his seat and pulled Castiel towards him
‘Do you feel better?’ Castiel asked.
Castiel flinched away as Balthazar stalked by. He rubbed his shoulder where they had touched. ‘Um…They need you to sign for the rooms,’ he said. His eyes fell on the CD case Gabriel held. ‘Is everything all right?’
Sam looked between the man and woman in confusion. ‘What’s going on?’ he asked, lowering his gun.
be too suspicious.’
Lucifer smiled as he recognized Michael. His brother was safe and with him. ‘I’ve missed you,’ he said softly.
know about it is because Cas walked in on Crowley watching it so many times, he’s pretty much seen the whole thing! And who does he bitch to about it? Me!’
the sea serpent?!’
Licking his lips, he leaned forward to press his lips against Sam’s in an effort to distract himself as he wrapped his hand around Sam’s cock. His brows furrowed at the slick and unfamiliar feel, and he shut his eyes as he threw himself into the kiss, letting muscle memory take over his hand.
sorry about that! Dean’s…not exactly the best with people…’
‘You’ll be fine,’ Sam called back from the bathroom. He leaned over the edge of the tub and tried to catch Gabriel’s eye as the other passed in front of the door. ‘The boat won’t capsize, and you’re not gonna fall in. And even if you did, I’d just jump right in and save you.’
Castiel appeared directly in front of Dean. When Dean made no move to fly off again, Castiel reached up and plucked a small twig from Dean's hair. He kept his eyes trained on Dean's and slowly, carefully touched Dean's Grace. But he was quickly shut out and physically pushed away. He stumbled as he regained his balance.
‘Why’d ya’ shoot ‘im, anyway?’ Dean asked. He managed to pull Castiel down again and began entertaining himself by running his fingers through Castiel’s hair.
Castiel nodded. So
The rain didn’t last long, and the sun was setting by the time Benny pulled his boat up to a dock near the Four Seasons. ‘This one? Are you sure?’ he asked. He turned to find Dean pulling on his shoes. They had stopped near a secluded area where Dean had hidden his clothing. Fortunately, the rain hadn’t gotten to them.
Castiel could feel confusion through the link and could only imagine what Dean was feeling from him. ‘All right… L-let’s hide in your room,’ he stuttered. He started up the stairs and looked behind when he noticed Dean wasn’t following.
my freedom?’ Gabriel asked, standing as tall as he could.
Gabriel shoved another spoonful of cereal into his mouth before answering Castiel’s silent question. ‘They left super early and took over our Hunt,’ he replied. He swallowed and grinned at Castiel. ‘Something about keeping us out of trouble.’
Castiel smiled weakly at Dean, wondering if the Hunter would be able to carry him out. Just as he placed his hand in Dean’s, a loud shot rang out.
Gabriel sighed in frustration as he hung up his phone. He gasped when a hand clasped tightly around his wrist. He looked up to find Sam glaring down at him.
The angel nodded and waited patiently while Dean hurried away. He tilted his head in question when Dean returned without Gabriel.
Gabriel gave Castiel a hard stare. ‘Why did you get it?’
, now!’
‘Hiding from what?’ Dean asked.
.-.-.-.-.
‘Lateral malleolus,’ Castiel replied. ‘Medial malleolus is on the other side. Ankle bone. Bottom of the fibula and tibia.’ He watched in bewilderment as Dean gently flexed his foot before bringing his own up to compare their toes. ‘You’re…you’re studying
‘Gabe said he left you with champagne. Did you drink the whole bottle?’ Charlie asked.
‘W-what did you do?!’ he demanded.
‘How so?’
‘I don’t know,’ Crowley admitted with a shrug. ‘Castiel’s birth shouldn’t have been possible.’
Castiel stared expectantly at his brother. When it dawned on him that Gabriel had nothing else to say on the matter, he turned his gaze to Dean. 'Dean?'
‘Why didn’t you ever do this with me?’ Balthazar whined drunkenly. ‘You’re fun. More fun than I thought! You’ve been holdin’ out on me!’
Dean gave Castiel’s ass a squeeze. ‘Can’t wait to get you outta these clothes,’ he said quietly.
any more pathetic?’ Anna said with a laugh. ‘Look, it’s none of my business, but if you wanna go crawling back to that asshole, go for it. No one’s stopping you. Definitely not him.’
Castiel looked around in confusion. Where had that warmth come from? He thought it was rather nice. He looked to the cuff on his wrist then to Dean. That must be it. They stared at each other in silence for several minutes.
Dean nodded and bit his lip. His mate had been very adamant about wanting to study Sam’s behavior before and after learning about Castiel’s knowledge, and he thought it would be fun and exciting to keep it a secret. He let himself relax, and his erection slipped back into hiding.
Dean’s brows rose. ‘What? I thought… I thought you were sleeping on my bed or something.’
Sam laughed as he leaned his elbows on the table. ‘He’ll be fine. Dean can take care of himself.’ He looked down at the glass between them and licked his lips before looking backup at Gabriel. ‘Are you…planning on sleeping on the floor again?’
‘Sex tape?’ Dean repeated in confusion.
Dean felt his face heat up but refused to be baited. ‘So? That doesn’t explain why he ran off.’
Anna nodded and led the way. She stopped in front of a closed door. She recognized it as leading to the building’s electric supply. She narrowed her eyes as she cautiously opened the door, expecting a trap.
‘Uriel…’ Anna knelt down for a closer look.
Castiel choked back a sob as he was forced to stand. He stared miserably at the struggling demon. ‘I’m sorry,’ he whispered as he pressed his palm against the demon’s forehead. He shut his eyes, refusing to watch the demon burn from the inside. If he could have chosen, he would have rather shut out the screams.
‘Hm… He’s a little tied up,’ Jody said. Movement and the sound of bedsprings could be heard over the phone. ‘Has my Roddy been a good boy? Has he earned a phone call?’
Dean ignored his brother’s voice and was about to signal him for his out when someone caught his eye. There, in a far corner, was the man in the tan overcoat. Dean almost didn’t recognize him. He was in a tuxedo and looked very sharp. Even the post-sex hair was tamed.
Dean sat at the table across from Sam and watched him sleep. After a while, he started feeling tired. His body wanted him to sleep. It would seem that an angel was trying to get into his dreams. He let sleep take him, hoping that Castiel would make it quick. He felt a little bad that he was about to use Castiel. He could just tell Castiel the plan, but could Dean trust him?
Castiel sighed heavily and nodded. ‘Yes. Humans do have difficulty with our real voices… I’ll ask him to stop. He may not be in his body, so I suggest the two of you remain up here,’ he said before vanishing to the basement. He reappeared just outside the panic room and stared at the sight that greeted him.
‘I took your advice,’ Castiel said, opening his fist to show off the roll of game tokens before letting it vanish. ‘Although, I had to substitute the quarters… Was that all right?’
‘Mom said it was the power of love!’ Gabriel said around a mouth full of food.
Castiel frowned. 'Is that really necessary?' he asked.
for this! Oh, God, I’m
‘What?!’ Karen cried out.
took it! I was the only one there! I know I was…’

unaffected? Do you feel
'C-Cas?!'
Sam frowned down at Gabriel in confusion. ‘But, he just said…’
‘Unless you’re proposing to him or breaking up with him, it can fucking
Karen nodded with a big smile as she rested her chin on her hand. ‘I just might be one of the ones sending you letters,’ she said. She laughed at Castiel’s lost stare. ‘Be sure to get a lot of headshots made. I’m sure your brother can explain it to you.’
He brought wars and plagues down upon his Father’s favorite creations. His corruption tainted his very being. He no longer needed to ask his vessels for permission. He simply took who he wanted. He destroyed God’s flock from within. A silent, creeping wolf who infected those around him. His anger became legend, and his vengeance against perceived slights, moreso. His acts were lauded by the wicked. And still, his Father remained silent.
Charlie nodded sadly. ‘
If He ever deemed him worthy of attention.
Balthazar narrowed his eyes at Dean. ‘I’m sure you would…’
.-.-.-.-.
‘C-can you…’ he trailed off, not sure how to phrase his thoughts. When Dean looked up, he quickly looked down. ‘Can you make one that’s stronger?’
‘Yeah… Uh… I’m gonna go lock everything and put up some devil’s traps and angel warding… So uh…sorry if no one can get inside…’ Gabriel pulled the door shut and locked it. He began looking through the kitchen drawers until he finally found a piece of chalk.  ‘And tell Karen I’ll clean up all the chalk and paint later.’
The next day, Sam and Dean saw neither hide nor hair of the film crew. When the crew returned, sans Balthazar and Castiel, Charlie had given Dean a sad look before darting down the hallway toward her shared room.
Bobby shut Crowley up with a glare. ‘All right. I get it. So why doesn’t Cas use them to escape?’
Dean was deliriously happy. No one had ever called his scales ‘beautiful’ before. ‘Thanks,’ he breathed. ‘They’re for you. I…I was hopin’ you’d like to wear them…’
'...And the next, he's ridding a town of a demon problem.'
'Y-yeah. She's good. She's fine. Hiding out somewhere,' Dean replied.
‘No shit!’ Dean snapped. ‘How many angels do you know that can smite something and prance around like nothin’ happened?’
‘At least it’s not the original ending,’ Castiel said.
‘Big decision.’
Gabriel quickly looked away. ‘Y-yeah…’
‘Where ya’ headed?’ Benny asked as he pulled the ladder back up.
‘You, me, Star Wars, Chinese?’
‘What’s a…non…dis… The thing you signed?’ Dean asked, almost sulkily. Castiel was useless at the moment (crying about not being trusted), so he looked to Crowley for an answer.
‘I knew it!’ Dean said as he stepped forward.
He could feel Dean’s presence in the other room. That was probably why his dream had felt so real. The cuff’s connection was stronger the closer Dean was, and the Hunter’s emotions were a vibrant, jumbled mess.
Sam watched the pair leave. He wanted to go with them, but he felt like it was too much of a risk. It was bad enough that Dean was in and out of the water, and Charlie was already heading out for midnight swims on her own. He just didn’t see how they could risk everything so easily. Especially right under the noses of people actively looking for proof of a mysterious creature.
?! He stared at his lap, trying to wrap his mind around the idea. His father had become a mercenary in his need to hunt down Mary’s killer. He never did find the man. ‘The…the man that killed my mom…’
‘Fighting back, I should assume,’ Michael said, and Anna nodded. ‘I never counted Uriel as a trusted member of my faction. He was useful, but far from anything that could prevent a smiting.’
‘Is there… I dunno… Demon Nicorette or something?’
Charlie rolled her eyes and placed a hand on her hip. ‘In case someone comes along,’ she replied as if it were obvious. ‘Then you can pop out and say we’re skinny dipping. Scare ‘em off.’
‘You okay there?’ Benny asked.
Meg grinned knowingly at Crowley. She hurried away as he rounded on her.
,’ Castiel snapped. ‘He’s my…my…mate!’
kinda long. Hey! It looks like I’m not wearing pants!’ He noticed the broken glass on the floor and stooped to pick up the pieces. He heard a choked sound come from behind him as he gathered up the larger pieces. He looked back and saw Sam rummaging in the first-aid kit and Charlie staring at his ass. ‘Something wrong?’ he asked as he stood up and dropped the glass on the desk.
‘Sweetie… Are you okay?’ Karen asked, rubbing his shoulder.
Dean sagged. ‘Yeah?’ he quietly replied.
‘I could tell,’ Sam replied and bent down to kiss the shorter man as he fumbled with the door knob. He shot up as he felt someone brush against his back.
Castiel reached up and wiped a tear from Dean’s cheek. He hugged Dean tightly as Dean buried his face in Castiel's neck.
Gabriel tightened his arms and shook his head. ‘This is good. In the morning…yeah. We’ll hunt down that stupid brother of yours and see what he knows.’
Castiel chuckled as he nodded in understanding. ‘I understand. You wouldn’t be the first mysophobe I’ve dated,’ he said. He looked over to see his laptop still on the coffee table. ‘That will…actually work out quite well for now… Um… You take over the bathroom for a bit, and I’ll set you up with some breakfast and a movie.’
‘Aww, but the movie I had in mind’s got pirates and pretty girls, and an epic battle against skeletons!’ Gabriel pouted.
Dean wrapped his arm around Castiel and pulled him close. He glared at Crowley. ‘What’s it to you, anyway?’
, more lollipops, a small, fully stuffed envelope…
Castiel frowned at Dean. ‘I’m strictly forbidden from hunting snipes,’ he replied.
Castiel shook as he raised his head and glanced back at his wings. They were still the pristine white of his dreams. ‘I-I don’t…I can’t control it,’ he stuttered.
‘Yeah. Sorry about that.’
‘Benny’s not like that,’ Dean said softly.
‘What?’ Castiel asked uncertainly.
. For when he’s gone on long trips. Fuck. Before he went to the Caribbean that one time, he said he wanted to get you something special. I guess he got drunk enough that he thought this would be a better idea than the ring.’
‘Doesn’t address relationships, either.’
‘You were
‘That’s in a different box,’ Castiel automatically replied.
‘I’ll be right here tomorrow night!’ Dean said, grinning at Castiel’s nod.
‘I’ll help,’ Karen offered. ‘If you don’t mind.’
‘I dunno, Bobby… I don’t think I’d be able to fit in,’ Sam said as he sat at the table. ‘I still make mistakes.’
Castiel stared at the small laptop screen in horror as he set down the small glass of whiskey he held. He had absolutely no recollection of the events he was watching.
‘Then why are you following me?! Who sent you?’ He pressed harder, making Jimmy cough, then let up. ‘Answer me,’ he growled.
Castiel’s eyes focused on the ferry that was slowly approaching. It was true that he needed to get back to the hotel, but the ferry ran fairly often. He could always catch a later one. ‘Actually,’ he said softly, ‘I would love to meet your brother.’
He looked over as a soft crunching grew louder. Samandriel appeared, followed closely by a young man.
just after talking to your mother,’ Jody said. She lightly touched Crowley’s shoulder and smiled—all traces of teasing gone.
to know there’d be a chance of getting bound to a Hunter if we were discovered.’
‘Hoax?’ Sam repeated. He glanced down to see Gabriel staring at the photo and nervously chewing his lip.
Balthazar guided the small boat toward the dock, staying a good ten feet away. ‘Sorry. We’re running late.’
‘Ah!’ Black wings suddenly stretched out, shedding a few feathers. Castiel moaned as Dean stroked his feathers and kissed at his neck. He was a panting mess when Dean slowly guided him further back on the bed. He turned and caught Dean’s lips with his own. He straddled Dean’s lap as he pulled at Dean’s shirt.
'So, Cas,' Bobby said, 'do you think you'd be any good on a hunt?'
morning,' Castiel replied, not taking his eyes off of Karen.
'I...I think it headed north,' Castiel said.

doing that ass-butt a favor. Ever. Again.’
Sam crossed his arms and rolled his eyes. Whatever Gabriel had chosen had to be better than the atrocity he had witnessed earlier.
'I cannot believe you just did that,' Dean said, completely unamused. 'No one does that.'
Crowley stared at Gabriel in shock. He looked to Sam. ‘No, he doesn’t,’ he quickly said. ‘Ask him. It’s not true.’
‘Yeah, you should probably wash up before dinner,’ Sam said.
‘Yeah, why wouldn’t I be?’
‘Maybe she didn’t want you to worry,’ Sam said as he rested his hand over the center of Gabriel’s wings.
Castiel awoke to the sound of voices and laughter. He rubbed at his eyes as he sat up and glared at the morning sun pouring in from a window. He shifted his glare to his fingers, now smudged with mascara and eyeshadow. As worried as he was over what the conversation outside was on, he refused to be seen in his current state. He stretched and popped a few kinks from his neck before making his way to the bathroom to wash his face.
Gabriel sighed and quietly closed the door. He turned to find Castiel sitting up in the bed. ‘Why didn’t you just take him back to your place?’ he asked.
‘Not you. Him,’ Jimmy replied, pointing his knife at Dean.
. I uh…still don’t wanna take my chances. One time was enough.’
Sam almost missed his step and hoped Gabriel hadn't noticed. And he was
a next time.
Dean pulled himself up onto the pier. After a small struggle, he managed to get into a sitting position with his tail trailing back into the water. He stretched out his primary and secondary fins, showing off new tears. ‘This,’ he said, ‘would have been a lot worse if Benny hadn’t killed that jerk.’
...' He trailed off when he looked down to see Gabriel's shining smile. He let out a sigh and led the way.
‘Chlamydia? Syphilis? Gonorrhea?’
Sam stood and backed away. He watched as Gabriel scuttled around the bed, not once letting go of it. As Gabriel reached the other side of the bed, he eyed the distance to the pile. He clutched his scrubs and hugged them tightly around himself before quickly hopping over to the pile. He crouched next to it and snatched up the envelope then stuffed it into his front pocket. He picked up a gun next then stood, looking much more confident than before.
Castiel nodded jerkily, blushing brightly as he remembered his fantasy from the motel bathroom. Dean’s hands traveled along his back, settling between his wings. He panted heavily as Dean settled behind him, and he could feel just how hard Dean was, rubbing against his ass. ‘Should I… Do you want me to undre—’
‘I had a nice time, Sam,’ he said softly.
Castiel looked up at Dean, tears forming. ‘Lucifer… Or Michael. Both… I don’t know…’
Jody raised a brow as Crowley looked away with a loud huff, crossing his arms. She turned her face back to Dean with a triumphant grin. ‘You can do whatever you like wherever you like,’ she said.
Gabriel sat up and pushed his hair back as Castiel went on about the shape and color of mermaid scales. He should probably get over his freak out before Castiel started
Dean found Sam waiting for him inside the small motel room. 'Ready to head out?' he asked, as nonchalantly as he could manage.
Gabriel didn’t answer right away. His breathing became ragged as he clutched at Sam’s shoulders.
Everyone else looked blissfully unaware of Crowley’s choice in phrasing. Everyone except Castiel, who just looked put out and would occasionally send Crowley dirty looks. Anytime Gabriel tried to catch his brother’s eye, Castiel would shrug and busy himself with food or drink.
‘No, you’re just playing with yourself,’ Sam replied. ‘Put Sugar and Spice away. I promise we can play with them later if you really want to.’
‘Do you like that?’ Dean asked, and Castiel nodded. ‘You like showing me your wings? Letting me touch them? Showing them off…like a little peacock attracting a mate?’
Castiel snuggled happily against the warm chest he rested on. He relaxed further as a hand gently stroked his hair. ‘Mm… Good morning.’

‘Liebling!’ he greeted, stopping a few feet away. Shocked blue eyes looked up to meet his. ‘Liebling, this is Scarlet Skrims, one of the most beautiful and interesting women here,’ he said.

'What?' Bobby and Dean spoke at the same time. Bobby in interest, Dean in dread.
she had received a set of deep scratches on the back of her hand.
,’ Sam pointed out as he crawled onto the bed next to Gabriel.
‘But I like watching you squirm,’ Sam said as he turned Gabriel to face him. ‘You do it to me. Why can’t I do it to you?’
‘Taking my mind off things,’ Castiel grumbled. He scratched his head as he sat up, looking around. ‘Dean?’
‘Does that mean you’ve set your sights on Balthazar?’ Samandriel asked with a small smile. ‘I could schedule you two for shooting some interviews.’
‘I’m sure you do, but please. If you wanna get laid tonight, then
Balthazar raised a brow and cocked his head to the side. ‘And what would that be?’
‘The only thing I’m jealous of is your paycheck,’ Anna replied, earning grunts of agreement from the other three.
‘Cas is…Cas is different. It’s like…he sees
‘It’s fine,’ Dean said easily. ‘I’m just not mate material.’
Dean turned to Castiel after the door shut. ‘So, what did you wanna talk about?’ he asked, scrutinizing Castiel’s every move.
‘It’s kind of hard to administer this when your hand’s over there,’ Anna replied. ‘I suppose I could always jam it in your neck.’
like my scars. You like my colors. You...you like me for me. And I like you for you. I love you, Cas.’
‘Fancy that. So does Cas,’ Crowley said. He looked up and caught sight of Gabriel and Sam. The pair looked lost and out of place at the restaurant’s entrance. He raised his hand and waved them over. ‘Remember: no fish-talk,’ he said quietly.
Dean nodded. With a sigh, he ushered Castiel up to the house, Gabriel close on their heels. The moment they reached the porch, Gabriel latched onto Sam and glared at Balthazar.
‘Huh?’
Dean frowned uncertainly as he trailed off on his threat. He could just make out the sound of an engine in the distance, and it was growing louder. He growled as he pulled his fins close and submerged his tail, glaring up at Crowley.
Dean licked his lips as breathed in slowly. ‘Not vibrant enough,’ he admitted as he let his fins drop. He breathed in sharply as he felt lips press against his own.
Castiel frowned as he stared at his brother's cuff. He brought his wrist up and inspected his own binding cuff. It was similar to his brother's, but there were slight differences. Both were a of dull silver and had the same spellwork carved into them, but the handwriting was different and his own seemed to have been stained by blood and grease.
‘J-Jimmy…’
‘Gonna make me
Sam watched as the pair walked along, occasionally stopping to take a photograph or laugh. He really needed to speak with Charlie and make sure that she would help keep everyone away from Dean. But first, he needed to make that map.
Castiel was having a lot of trouble thinking straight. Everything was so bright and vivid. So intense. So much better than any dream. Better than anything he had ever felt. He was drunk off of Dean’s lust for him, and he was feeling lightheaded. He was uncertain where his thoughts ended and Dean’s began. He just wanted more of the Hunter. Wanted to hear him cry out in ecstasy.
‘Fine. You’re excused
It was wonderful.
Jody stared at Dean before looking at Castiel for confirmation.
‘Well, hello to you, too.’
‘That you liked me,’ Castiel said petulantly. He sighed sat back, staring at the path that had brought him do the pier. ‘Sorry to ruin your evening. I’ll just…go.’
‘Uh…okay?’
‘Okay, um… How about this: What are some
Castiel set his things on the ground and began to pull his shirt off. He paused and gave Charlie a wary look. ‘Wait.
like you… It’s just…I’ve never kissed anyone before,’ he said.
‘It won’t start.’
Karen blinked and looked over her shoulder. ‘It’s just a…decoration. I like tiki bars,’ she explained and looked back at Dean. With all the mermaids in the current vicinity, she wondered if she should change the name of the hotel.
Castiel excused himself and hid in the panic room.
‘Why’s it matter?’
He removed Gabriel’s lab coat and pushed up his top and stared slack-jawed at the sight. He had been expecting the holster and guns, but not the handful of small explosives and detonator taped to Gabriel’s stomach. He ran a finger over a scar that rested near Gabriel’s heart. After removing the weapons and setting them aside, he turned Gabriel over and checked his back. Another small gun and a couple spare magazines greeted him, each carrying the delicate wings marking them as Angel Corp property.
Sam narrowed his eyes at Crowley and placed both hands protectively on Gabriel’s shoulders. ‘I might have the power to release Gabriel, but the choice is up to him. If he wants to stay, then he stays.’
‘You did a good job. I sent a picture to Father, and he was quite impressed,’ Castiel said. He nibbled at Dean’s earlobe and smiled as Dean moaned softly. ‘Forget about them. Forget about the cuff. Tonight it’s just you and me. Nothing else. No problems. No worries… Just us.’
Sam nodded and went back to looking over the calendars.
‘It will let me see your bones without having to cut you open,’ Castiel explained distractedly as he made his way down Dean’s calf.  He looked up as he held Dean’s foot in his lap, and his eyes settled on the merman’s penis. He tilted his head and pursed his lips. ‘Is it traditional for mermaids, er, folk to get cut?’
‘Okay. If we’re gonna make this work, then we need to set one thing straight,’ Gabriel said.

He couldn’t keep the smile off his face. At least, not until he recognized the car parked outside his apartment building. All because of a stupid 80s movie… The moment Castiel had turned eighteen, he pulled his inheritance out and spent it on a black ’67 Camaro and had it fixed up. Every last cent meant to put him through college…wasted.
Castiel handed Dean over to Sam before following Bobby into the kitchen and to the set of labeled phones.
For some reason, the

Dean cocked his head to the side. He brought up his tail and spread his tailfin.
‘I don’t know, but it’s definitely distracting. How do you… Y’know what? I don’t wanna know how. Not yet.’
‘Castiel. So nice to hear from you,’ Crowley said, his accented voice not quite clear. ‘Darling, did you forget something? Mmm, thank you. Now, Castiel. To what do I owe the pleasure?’
‘Okay, fine. It was me!
knows?!’ Gabriel wailed.
‘It’s okay, Castiel,’ Lucifer whispered. ‘I forgive you for your little outburst. It’s quite understandable.’ He stood and stared down at Castiel for a moment before heading to the door. He opened it and waved in a pair of angels holding up a struggling demon.
‘Gabriel, no,’ Castiel said, turning away. ‘I’m not interested in your aliens or mutants or whatever you think it is.’
Michael barely stifled a laugh and quickly covered his mouth.
‘What? No!’ Castiel quickly shook his head. ‘Archangels… Gabriel does it all the time with…with Father. It’s uh…er…a display of power,’ he said, stumbling over his words. ‘I shouldn’t be capable of… What’s

‘You practically are! You
Dean sighed in irritation and got out to walk her to her door.
Dean winced as he watched Castiel get his ass handed to him. ‘C’mon, Cas,’ he said quietly. ‘Fight back…’
Dean frowned as he processed who he was staring at. It wasn’t Jimmy. He let his disappointment show and pulled his hand away. ‘Go ‘way, Sam,’ he slurred.
Castiel rolled his eyes as he set about pressing his fingers against Dean’s stomach. He slowly made his way down, and Dean giggled and clicked beneath him. ‘Shh! I don’t want them to know that I know!’
Gabriel glared back and pushed Castiel behind him.
Castiel shank away and he pulled his wings around himself. ‘Lenore was…unkind.’
‘Oh, those! Yeah, I speak that. It’s easy,’ Dean said proudly. He gasped and quickly unwrapped his tail, accidentally knocking Castiel aside. He flattened his fins and hugged his tail to his chest and he forced himself to breathe slowly.
‘So who’s going out there in the morning?’ Karen asked.
Balthazar leaned over and gave Castiel’s cheek a quick peck. ‘Never shoulda let you go…’
‘They must be quite a sight,’ Lucifer said conversationally as he stood in front of Castiel, assessing the younger angel. ‘I would love to see them in person.’
Sam smiled when Gabriel leaned forward and pecked his cheek. He hooked his hand behind Gabriel’s neck and kept him close. ‘Don’t lose track of time,’ he said before kissing Gabriel, gently coaxing the other’s lips open.
‘I’m asking

‘How bad is it?’ Castiel asked.

‘You were always happier just before a trip,’ Balthazar pointed out. ‘You never had to say when you were leaving. I just knew from the way you acted. Then you’d come back and be unbearable for a couple weeks.’
, stop encouraging him.’
And then he was back. In the body he had claimed. He was once again Dean Winchester. He was in a coffin. He was in a coffin, buried under six feet of dirt that made him wish he was back in Hell. He had to dig his way out. He was so exhausted from fighting against that stupid angel that he could not fly out. Then that pesky angel tried to speak to him, but with his Grace so corrupted from his recent stint in Hell and he was so exhausted, he could only hear through human ears.
Crowley watched as the boat sped by then knelt beside Castiel. He leaned back, narrowly avoiding an open-handed swipe from Dean.
‘Are you…stuck?’ Gabriel asked as he watched. There was a bit of amusement to his voice. Sam was already too big for the small tub, and with the added length of his tail, the sight was almost comical.
Gabriel pressed his finger to Sam’s lips. ‘No. Don’t you dare start that. Leave the cheesy humor to me, thank you.’
Dean felt the tingling in his tail and scooted back to the edge of the boat, quickly dunking his tail back into the water. ‘I don’t really want Sam to know,’ he admitted, looking away. ‘He thinks I’m being…what did he say…impulsive.’
Dean waited patiently for Castiel to recover. Even though he should probably be embarrassed, it was worth it to see the way Castiel’s eyes and nose crinkled as he smiled and to hear his laugh. He looked over as the front door opened and a small group entered. He smiled when he recognized Charlie. ‘Hey, Spot!’
Castiel nodded and continued to pull his shirt off. He heard a pair of chittering clicks and whistles, and couldn’t help but feel like he was being catcalled.
‘Sam Winchester,’ Sam replied. First his brother, now his childhood friend. Was the entire colony just waiting to appear at his doorstep? ‘Wait…you’re with…this?’ he asked, gesturing to Gabriel and the rest of the crew.
It was early the next morning when a high pitched noise drifted up from the basement. Sam and Bobby looked around in confusion as the sound grew higher and louder. The windows began to vibrate, and the lights flickered.
‘Y-yeah. Sorry. I get it,’ Gabriel quietly replied, clutching the first aid kit tightly. ‘I didn’t mean to scare you off.’
Sam gave Charlie a confused look before he made the connection that she was speaking of Gabriel. ‘
Charlie shook her head as she stooped to collect Castiel’s shirt and help him stand. ‘Hey, Freckles,’ she said to Dean. ‘Wish I could stay and chat, but…I have babysitting duties.’
to fight, not beat him up,’ Sam said.
Dean’s fingers loosened around Castiel’s hand, and he readjusted his grip. ‘Hey,’ he said, ‘while I’m still sober… I don’t want you to leave because of what you are. I just want you to be open with me. So…you up for a date later?’
‘It was
‘It won’t be much longer,’ Lucifer said, twisting the cuff around Castiel’s wrist. ‘Soon, we’ll have found a way to free you from his hold.’
The next day, everyone was gathered at the table for breakfast. Anna and Balthazar were keeping a close eye on Castiel, and Gabriel desperately wanted to see everyone’s  reactions.
'I-it's gone,' Gabriel replied as he stood up, still a bit shaken. He quickly sidled up to Sam. 'Are they supposed to do that? Just pop up and vanish?'
‘I could see that,’ Castiel said with a quiet smile. ‘Okay, so… Come what may, I stick with the show. We’ll talk to Gabriel about getting you on as Charlie’s assistant, and… Wait.’
‘That bad?’
‘No, it’s going great!’ Dean happily replied. ‘But I think I need to up my game.’ He looked around himself until he saw Benny’s toolbox. He dragged himself closer as Benny watched.

'Yeah... Illusions, tricks. You need a sewer gator? I'm your guy.'
quite secure. Just not with Gabriel for the specific reason of needing to get back in undetected. The basement is the only floor of that building that does not record the movements of my…more trusted employees.’
Uriel made his demands, showed off his trophy, and, with Anna's kiss still fresh in Dean's mind, assumed Dean had gotten 'a slice of angel pie.'
! And so’s Dean and Charlie! I’m surrounded by fish-people!’ he wailed. As he stared at his brother, something clicked. Castiel didn’t seem at all surprised. Or even doubtful. It was the same look he got whenever he stated the obvious.
He reentered the bungalow, Muffin right on his heels. As he got ready for bed, he wondered if he would dream about ‘Dean’ again. For a drunken hallucination, Castiel certainly was hung up on him. He decided to enjoy his privacy while it lasted.
He got in with no problem. No weapons to sneak in. Just a bug hidden within his watch, and a small earpiece that went undetected. The moment he was in the main hall, he began seeking out his target, which was a lot easier than he thought it would be.
‘No.’ Gabriel crossed his arms and glared up at Castiel. ‘The sooner I get you out of the safe house, the sooner I can get a good night’s sleep. Believe me. You wouldn’t be the first to sleep with their target,’ he said.
‘Again, I ask:
'Don't worry,' Sam said as he walked past Gabriel. 'Just keep close, and you'll be fine.' Sam almost tripped when Gabriel latched onto his arm. 'Er...not
Dean shuddered and gasped as Castiel hit it again and added a third finger. He hadn’t noticed that Castiel had stopped sucking on his cock and was surprised when he was pulled into a kiss. ‘Cas… Oh, fuck… Please,’ he moaned. The fingers within him stopped moving, and he twisted, trying to feel more. ‘Please, Castiel. C’mon,’ he whined pathetically as Castiel withdrew his fingers.
Bobby shook his head as he sat next to Karen. ‘They’ll keep ‘til mornin’. Gabe’s got the property on lockdown, and Crowley’s sendin’ PR agents. He already emailed Sam a prepared statement.’
Dean laughed and shook his head. ‘All right, but if you do it when everyone’s watching, you’re on your own, you little peacock.’
'I don't get it,' Sam said after a while. 'Seraphiel's all over the place. One minute he's starting orgies at convents...'
‘Your mother was one of our best assassins.’
‘But it’s so fresh,’ Charlie said as she poured herself some orange juice. ‘We’ve got a couple tourists and fishermen as witnesses. Most of the episode is gonna be filler narration. Look at this pretty island. Here’s what we think the sea monster looks like. Ooh…’ She waved her hands around for emphasis and rolled her eyes.
Castiel nodded miserably. ‘My brother found out,’ he whispered. ‘All the one night stands… My tattoo… Just my deviant nature in general… God, he saw the
Gabriel’s eyes darted around the table and caught Michael’s interested stare. He pressed closer to Sam and relaxed a little when an arm wrapped tightly around him. ‘I, uh… I can do a lot more than you’ve seen…’
‘And the cuff didn’t fall off?’ Karen asked, confused.
'Yep.' Dean turned the power on.
Gabriel looked up at Sam, wiping his nose on his sleeve. ‘I don’t want you to go,’ he said softly. ‘Besides, Cas’ll know something’s up if you guys leave, too. Bobby and Karen can use a hunt as an excuse, but you guys have to stay here.’
Dean frowned as he looked at a pair of jeans and a pair of shorts. ‘So…scars are…okay?’ he asked uncertainly. At Benny’s nod, he tossed the jeans aside. He would get used to the sensation of shorts first.
‘Of course not!’ Gabriel held out his hands as Sam pulled out a bottle of peroxide. ‘I got them from the juniors’ section. C’mon, Sam, make with the fizzies.’
Muffin finished and hopped off the bed to sit in the window, and Castiel pushed himself up onto his elbows. He looked around the room in dismay. It was still a mess from when he had torn everything apart, searching for the contract. He felt a pang of guilt, but refused to clean the room. He looked at the other bed, finding it vacant, and wondered how long Gabriel would be avoiding him.
Gabriel gave a laugh as he turned to Dean. 'Did you really think
.-.-.-.-.
Dean looked out the window and ran his hand along the worn steering wheel. ‘It’s not your fault. I’ll get back on track again…’
Gabriel frowned. He had only ever used his powers to play tricks and keep hidden. Finding supernatural entities wasn't one of his primary talents. Whenever he
go seeking out humans. Besides, maybe they actually believe in the show? Or are gonna make a lot of money from it.’
‘Pretty blue fins?’ Dean shook his head, looking away. ‘We had our fun, but she found someone else. White tail…bright orange fins.’ He shrugged. ‘They look good together. The have a cute kid. Light orange and blue spots.’
Samandriel nodded as he tipped his glass to Gabriel. ‘Best job I’ve had so far,’ he replied. ‘For once, I don’t have to fight for time off. I just schedule you around me!’ He laughed at the indignant look Gabriel shot him.
Dean shook his head. ‘I’m guessing it’s about a mermaid? What’s she look like?’ he asked.
‘You kids may have grown up around this shit, but you didn’t have to join up,’ Bobby replied. ‘They…they’re selected. They get their first mission around the age of ten. Not anything easy like surveillance… Straight up assassination.’
.-.-.-.-.
Charlie led the way as she, Dean, and Castiel hiked along an overgrown trail. She glanced around, looking for a familiar landmark.
‘With how much I paid, they’d better look good,’ Benny muttered.
‘Then I guess I won’t be sending you any fanmail,’ Sam said as he slid off the bench and settled next to Gabriel.
‘Surveillance, huh?’ Sam had been trying, albeit unsuccessfully, to get Gabriel to confess to having his personal collection of Sam-centric photos. ‘Take any good pictures lately?’
‘Cas, I’m concerned for you,’ Balthazar said softly. ‘You can talk to me.’
Sam kept from laughing and took pity on Gabriel. ‘We sorta grew up together. She’s like a little sister.’
Lucifer headed to the door and paused, his hand on the doorknob. ‘Oh, and Castiel… You are forbidden to warn them.’
Gabriel shook his head, staring at his feet. ‘Not there.’
‘Those are pretty,’ Dean said. He made a happy whistle as he took an earring and looked at it from every angle, admiring how it sparkled under the sunlight. Seeing the earring in his hand, he had to wonder just how it would be worn—he had forgotten to ask Charlie how hers were attached. ‘Earrings and…wear my scales instead of
Castiel’s mouth opened and closed as he tried to comprehend what Gabriel was asking. ‘Why would you…?’
‘What’s it like jerking off?’ Gabriel asked before he could stop himself. Why did his mind have to jump right into the gutter at serious moments? ‘Sorry.’
‘I have to agree with Dean,’ said Sam. ‘I mean, that was one fucked up movie…’
Sam gave an unsure smile. 'So...you're not mad?'
‘Vous allez bien?’ Sam asked, feeling concern over Gabriel growing confusion. ‘Gabriel?’
Dean smiled incredulously up at Sam. ‘No way! I thought she just moved to the southern…uh… What word do I use?’
Castiel gave an unhappy sigh. ‘This isn’t what it looks like,’ he said simply.
wanna trade?' he asked as he let his gaze fall on Castiel.
Sam smiled uncertainly as he pulled out a set of tweezers. He couldn’t keep his eyes from wandering up Gabriel’s leg. He choked on his own spit when he noticed Gabriel twisting to give him a better view.
Dean swallowed as his eyes traveled over his dreams’ obsession. He turned his attention back to Ms. Skrims. ‘I’m so sorry, Ms. Skrims, but I believe I just located my husband!’ he said. He took her hand in his and raised it to his lips. ‘It was a pleasure meeting you while I waited.’
‘You’re not real!’
sleep somewhere else? I thought that’s how that was supposed to work.’
Karen shrugged and moved to the sink to clean her hands. ‘If it ain’t broke… But…yeah, I can see what you mean. It…’ She glanced over at Dean and bit her lip. ‘It’d be nice to have the connection, but not the compulsion,’ she quietly admitted. ‘Bobby’s real careful, and he takes it back when he does slip up, but…I wish he didn’t have to.’
Castiel stared at the large flatscreen mounted to the wall. He was back at home. Back in his bedroom. Back with his collection of old cartoons. As much as he missed it all, it brought him little comfort. He sat on the edge of his bed and hugged his pillow tightly as the door to his room opened and Lucifer entered. ‘Please leave me alone,’ he mumbled, not taking his eyes off the screen.
'Well, Sam? Does it say anything about any signs? Anything to give us a heads up in case we do run into him?' Bobby asked.
Sam ran after Gabriel. From the angel's expletives and shouts, he gathered that Dean and Castiel were in trouble. He was surprised at how swift and agile Gabriel actually was. He was having trouble keeping up. He refrained from asking Gabriel to slow down, knowing it would only make the angel even more frantic.
‘He kinda said that he wanted to come with,’ Castiel admitted with a shrug. ‘Muffin likes him.’
‘I have never been so traumatized!’ Gabriel moaned as he paced back and forth in the lobby of the Singer Hotel. ‘I’ll never be able to look at him again!’
‘Yeah, I get that,’ Castiel said bitterly. ‘It doesn’t matter anymore. I’ll stay out of everyone’s way. Just… Let me borrow the camera, and I’ll drop off the footage as I get it.’
‘Cas can be a little manipulative,’ Gabriel admitted.
Castiel rubbed the cover of his notebook self-consciously. ‘I’m not nerdy,’ he quietly argued.
Gabriel gripped Castiel's shoulder reassuringly. 'For
‘Cas?’ Gabriel eyed his brother warily. He had seen the same look before—feared that he would have to deal with Castiel being in this state after he had tricked him into signing on for a second season at the same time he had been canned. Apparently, finding out about Dean had been the tipping point.
Sam shut the door as he fully entered the room and grimaced. ‘Not everyone likes snow globes,’ he replied.
‘Our little Cassie wanted you think he was normal,’ Crowley cooed.
‘You never asked! You never asked me how I was doing!
'And, hey! We also have a VCR!' Dean declared as he slapped Castiel on the back. He let his hand linger, then gave up on self-restraint and ran his hand along the ridge of one wing.
‘You’re gonna love it, Sammy!’
‘Well, you guys have your thing, so uh… I’ll catch you later?’ Dean asked as he pulled up his pants.
The barn doors flew open, and Castiel and Uriel entered.
‘No,’ Castiel replied, confused.
‘I’ve lost everything because of this. I don’t blame Gabriel, but he did set things into motion,’ Castiel said tonelessly.
'Y'know what you should do, Cas?'
‘I believe the correct term would be Ichthyo Sapiens. Though possibly
‘You broke it, you fix it,’ Bobby explained.
Castiel's head shot up in time to see his brother give Dean a shrug. He quickly made his way to Dean and pulled his phone from the unresisting hand. 'Please don't ask about it,' he mumbled.
‘I’ll get a doctor,’ Castiel said and was already at the door by the time Dean was voicing a protest. He opened the door and quickly ducked behind it.
Dean had been hoping to speak to his brother again, but, instead, some other person was on the pier. He didn’t think twice when the stranger fell into the water. He darted forward and pulled the human to the surface and helped him back onto the pier. He hurried to the side and clung to edge, making certain to hide his tail and fins. ‘Hey, uh…you okay?’ he asked.
Bobby frowned at Dean. ‘When did it start?’
He flinched at the knock behind him.
The soft trill was back, and Castiel smiled as he listened. It wasn’t exactly a song or particularly pretty. But he found comfort in in nonetheless. If he had to pick a sound that it was similar to, he would have to say it was like a constant, chirpy purr. He breathed a soft sigh as he closed his eyes. ‘I’m fine.’
‘I am so,
.-.-.-.-.
‘What about this?’ Sam asked, pointing out a particular set of sigils set within a circle. ‘Rework the compulsion. Make it less heavy duty…’
'Is that...?'
Dean shushed Sam as Jo began to speak.
Samandriel held up the clapper in front of the camera. ‘Teaser take two.’
, and how Dean was this perfect, wonderful… What was the word you used? Oh, yeah! Asshole.’ He raised his brow at Castiel as he looked at his brother. ‘Besides just initially mentioning mermaids, I was kinda impressed that you
‘Both,’ Crowley quietly confirmed. ‘They each have so many spies…if one knows, you can count on the other knowing.’
‘I’ll lose the tail,’ Dean said. ‘I’ll have legs like a human. So…I want clothes. Clothes that are good for attracting a mate.’
'Dammit, Cas! It's tradition,' Gabriel insisted.
Castiel stood and gestured to the body on the floor. ‘Everything is as it should be,’ he said. ‘Dean, I… I would be honored.’
A large bottle was thrust in front of him, and Castiel looked up to give Gabriel a dirty look. ‘I’m busy, Gabriel,’ he said. ‘I will
Anna certainly wasn’t the best fighter that worked for his father, and Castiel knew it. Balthazar was so much quicker than she was. Castiel could only imagine just how good of a fighter Lucifer was. If he didn’t stand a chance against Anna, then what would happen when he ended up facing Lucifer? Even if Lucifer had no sway over him, Castiel would lose. He would lose, and Dean would die. And it would be all his fault. He didn’t know how to fight. He didn’t know how to fend off even the simplest attacks.
Anna looked down at Gabriel. ‘How long until he’s conscious?’
‘Then stay by the phone,’ Bobby said as he motioned for Castiel to follow him.
‘My car’s been making an odd noise,’ Castiel said. ‘I have to make a quick trip home tomorrow morning, but I really don’t want to drive very far when it’s making that noise. I’m…surprised I made it here without it dying on me.’
Gabriel pouted as he slouched forward. ‘Oh…’
Dean rolled his eyes. ‘No, but I’m sure we can figure something out.’
‘Why…’ Sam trailed off, uncertain of how he should broach the subject. ‘Never mind.’
Castiel’s brows furrowed at the thought, and panic seized him. ‘Then… Why haven’t they gone public?’
Sam laughed and kissed Gabriel. ‘He sent us approved answers to give the new stations,’ he said. ‘I think he saw this coming.’
Karen smiled softly. ‘I knew takin’ those boys in would be the best decision we made.’
‘According to merfolk beauty standards, that’s considered very attractive,’ Castiel happily explained. ‘The more contrast, the better.’
Bobby paused, staring at Crowley in confusion. ‘Then what sort of
He knew he had at least a few broken and cracked ribs. He had more than enough cuts, burns, and bruises. A few broken fingers…a couple missing nails. Torture sucked. It had been four days, and no sign of rescue. He doubted Sam would just give up on him. Not without a body as proof. His brother had to be out there, somewhere… He could hold out a little longer.
on protection detail?’
‘What if it’s Cas?’ Dean asked as he got up to investigate. He reached the door and cracked it open to find his competition for Castiel’s attention slumped against the opposite wall. He opened the door wider and looked up and down the hallway, finding no sign of Castiel. ‘You okay?’ he asked.
'This oughtta be good. All right, then. Enlighten me. What does a TV look like?' Dean asked as he crossed his arms, giving Castiel a patronizing look.
‘Say again?’
‘No!’ Castiel shouted, slamming his fist on the table.
‘But—‘
Sam opened the bag of gummies and popped one in this mouth.
For the rest of the day, Castiel was extremely nervous. He jumped at everything. Even Gabriel was beginning to worry. Castiel had shut Gabriel out of his thoughts, and it was making Gabriel worried and nervous.
‘Both, actually. I pick up on languages pretty easily,’ Sam proudly replied. ‘Kinda runs in the family.’
‘This is awful!’ Gabriel gave a frustrated growl. ‘I can’t deal with this right now! Good night!’
‘I’ve been charged with keeping it out of Charlie’s hands.’
’ Dean asked.
‘What did he mean by “make things worse”,’ Dean asked, crossing his arms. His heart pounded harshly in his chest, and he could feel himself shaking.
‘You need to get up,’ Sam whispered. He smiled as Gabriel grumbled and nestled against his chest, leaving soft kisses.
‘Comin’ to bed?’ Dean asked.
‘How in control are you?’ he asked.
‘Do you…want me to break the link?’
‘He’s lying, of course,’ Crowley pointed out. ‘I always pose a threat. Just not in the…conventional way.’
There was a soft splash of water behind him, and he looked over his shoulder at Castiel. ‘Cas?’
Castiel narrowed his eyes and frowned. ‘I don’t—’
marathon.’
‘If it’s like Crowley and Jody’s, then…yeah.’
yesterday,’ Balthazar said.
By the time Benny had caught a decent amount to call it a day, Dean had finished dressing. He was impressed that the mermaid had figured out how to tie his shoes on his own.
Dean nodded jerkily and pushed himself upright. He flinched as Benny grabbed his arm and helped him. ‘I’m fine… I’m…’ He trailed off as he looked down to examine his new legs. He groaned and sagged forward as his eyes landed on the large scar on his left thigh. ‘I won’t be good enough,’ he whispered.
Castiel sniggered and shrugged. ‘Usually…
Dean ignored Michael as he went up to the door and banged on it. ‘Put the dog and strippers away and get some clothes on!’ he shouted.
Gabriel gasped and sagged as the cuff’s spell ended. He wrapped his wings tightly around himself as he cried into his hands. ‘Don’t tell anyone. Please don’t tell anyone!’ he begged. ‘Don’t let them kill him. Don’t let them take him from me! He’s all I have left!’
‘Everyone is lying to me!’ Gabriel wailed. ‘I really shouldn’t be surprised. First Cas, then Sam, and now
Bobby looked away briefly. He had killed his fair share of demons over the years, and none of them had presented themselves as calmly as the shorter man that stood before him. He had to keep reminding himself that the man was a demon. ‘I take it “natural selection” applies to the crazies, too?’ he said.
‘Don’t worry,’ she said when Castiel looked up. ‘We’ll take it slow.’
Dean squinted at Bobby in confusion before remembering what he had said earlier. ‘Oh… Huh. Good one,’ he mumbled.
Gabriel sullenly stared back.
‘What happened?’ Karen asked, voice barely above a whisper.
,’ Charlie replied with a shrug. ‘
‘I’ll never get over it! He’s supposed to be this sweet, stuck up, innocent, nerdy, stick-in-the-mud! Not a…a…
Castiel frowned, but looked forward, enjoying the rush of pleasure that rewarded him for obeying. ‘What do you want me to do?’ he asked.
Dean drove Pamela home while Sam and Ruby looked for a way to find Anna's Grace.
Castiel shrugged and sipped at his beer. ‘It has its uses,’ he admitted. ‘But diving equipment would have to be
'According to Dad? It's more than necessary, and he should probably be sending an army, but he'll settle for a few minions,' Gabriel replied.
‘Friday…I’m in love,’ Dean giggled at his failed attempt at a joke.
Castiel slapped his hand against his neck, blushing brightly. ‘Y-you gave me hickey?!’
Jimmy looked down, shifting in embarrassment. ‘I…I like being called his husband,’ he quietly replied. ‘Where we live…same-sex marriage has not been legalized…yet.’ He looked back up at Ms. Skrims, his eyes shining with hope.
, not Castiel. ‘I know what pot smells like. You never smelled like that.’
‘Tonight?’
Sam sighed at the nickname and shook his head. ‘Dean’s my
They looked over as Castiel burst out laughing.
Sam felt a smile tug at his lips. ‘I’ll keep that in mind.’ He looked down the hall and caught Dean staring after Castiel with a worried expression. ‘Dean?’
‘It’s cursive,’ Castiel mumbled self-consciously as he set the box down.
‘So she’s all…dried out?’ Dean asked. ‘Do the rest of them know?’
‘Doesn’t take much,’ Dean replied. ‘I’m ridin’ a damned good high of demon energy myself right now. Only reason I’m able to keep it together is the thought of Sammy…’
Castiel let the quilt pool around his hips and stretched out his wings. 'I don't think she'll like me.'
Dean hummed softly as he held Castiel in his arms. He had found that humming and clicking helped to soothe Castiel and calm him down. ‘I know it’s hard to believe,’ he said quietly. ‘But I’m real, and I’m not going anywhere. Not gonna leave you.’
Gabriel pouted, letting his lip quiver. ‘But…Naomi already approved your time off,’ he said. ‘She says it’ll be good for you.’
Dean paled. People paid attention to that sort of stuff? 'So, uh...interrogate everyone with green eyes?' he said jokingly, hoping his voice wasn't wavering as much as he thought it was.
Balthazar raised his brow at Dean, clearly unimpressed. ‘Believe me. We will,’ he said, brushing past Dean. He wrapped his arm around Castiel’s waist, grinning ear-to-ear on the inside as Castiel melted right into him, as if the past four years hadn’t happened. He glanced at Dean as he gently ushered Castiel to the door. ‘Don’t wait up,’ he said with a wink.
makes you uncomfortable?’
Dean sighed and stared at the ceiling before looking back at Castiel. ‘I don’t care,’ he said carefully. ‘You’re worth more than that to me.’
‘No!’ Castiel shot upright. He gasped for breath as he looked wildly around the kitchen. He had fallen asleep at the kitchen table listening to Karen’s humming. He flinched when Karen set a slice of cherry pie in front of him.
Dean stood straighter and met Gabriel’s stare.
‘Do…do your uh…fins spread out when you’re more relaxed?’ The word ‘fins’ kept running through his head after he said it.
‘I highly doubt Sam would “go crazy,” and he needn’t worry about being possessed,’ Castiel reasoned. ‘Gabriel told me about the tattoo.’
Castiel shrugged. ‘I…I don’t know.’
‘You’d think I’d be able to do better,’ Castiel said grumpily as he let Muffin crawl to the space between him and Dean.
Sam shook his head. ‘I…I’m happy here. I’m used to it.’
‘C’mon, Gabe. It’s not that bad,’ Balthazar said.
Dean laughed as he set the bag aside and rubbed his hands over Castiel’s shoulders. ‘I don’t think so. Here. You tell me why your love spell isn’t working, and I’ll try to explain what it is,’ he said.
Gabriel had to admit the island was a lot more beautiful than he had remembered. Of course, he had spent his last trip triple-checking his scuba tank and camera to distract himself from the fact that he was in the middle of the ocean with only Samandriel by his side, so he had missed out on a lot of the scenery. Now, his only distraction was a nice view of Sam’s butt in khaki shorts—and his need to keep his hand tightly wrapped around the railing. He looked perfectly relaxed, except for his white knuckles.
It had been a while since he’d been in the ocean. He hadn’t realized just how much he had missed it. Even if Gabriel was right, and he did belong back in the water, he wouldn’t admit it to his older brother.
‘Cas, I already told you,’ Gabriel said as he fiddled with a loose manikin arm, ‘I didn’t tell him. I just threatened him not to hurt you.’
In an instant, Castiel was bare, moaning helplessly with his face buried in his arms. He was having a hard time not moving, but the longer he stayed, the more intense the cuff rewarded him. ‘P-please,’ he begged. ‘Can’t hold on… Can’t… Please, Dean!’
Gabriel grumbled as there was a knock on the door. ‘No…stay…ignore it,’ he mumbled as Sam wiggled out from beneath him. He heard Samandriel’s voice and groaned as he pulled a pillow over his head. ‘Lemme alone!’
Castiel downed another shot as the dorsal fin skimmed the surface of the water. He coughed when Balthazar leaned into him and rested a hand on his chest.
‘Er…depends… If we were hired to get them, we give the pictures to the client,’ Gabriel replied. He shifted in his seat. ‘Do you…um…’
Karen viciously stabbed at a potato. There was a demon in
Sam jumped and turned his head, his nose brushing against the nose of the speaker. 'Uh...hello,' he replied uncertainly. He could feel his cheeks burning. His vision was filled with the face of a young man with golden hair and eyes.
Castiel sat down and ignored Gabriel. ‘When will I be scheduled to shoot the underwater scenes?’ he asked Samandriel.
Castiel pulled himself from Dean’s arms and leaned toward his father. ‘I don’t need training,’ he insisted. He looked over to Anna and narrowed his eyes. ‘And certainly not from an amputee.’
He sighed as he watched the man leave the market. He really hoped the man wasn’t another spy. He was sick of all the pretty eye candy rival and enemy organizations sent his way.
Dean was instantly reminded of cuddling up to Castiel. He shifted uncomfortably, tucking and hiding all thoughts of Castiel away. Especially the thrill that went through him.
Castiel shook his head as he smiled lightly. ‘Given the evidence…because merfolk have bad taste.’
could smite an angel,’ he replied. ‘Apparently, he couldn’t get it right.’
Castiel hugged his knees tighter. He wondered if he should have kept the door locked. Kept Dean out. He almost didn’t catch the question, but he had felt a slight urging from the cuff. Dean had kept the orders and questions to a minimum so far, and Castiel was beginning to wonder if he would ever feel the pull that Gabriel had described to him. ‘I…I don’t quite understand what you mean,’ he quietly replied.
‘Yeah? Well,
‘Bal,’ Gabriel said in a warning tone. ‘Please don’t…do anything.’
Gabriel spun and faced Sam with wide eyes. ‘Y-you’d do that? Let me go? Just like that?’
‘I’m…with a…a film crew,’ Castiel said with some difficulty. ‘And I’d rather do my share alone.’
'He started at least fifty wars between peaceful nations, and that's what he admitted to,' Sam replied. 'Burned down hundreds of churches—'
‘The angels will live, of course. I can’t say the same for anything else.’
Balthazar grimaced and shook his head. ‘Well, that was a little better than I was expecting, to tell the truth…’ He looked up at Sam’s flabbergasted expression. ‘You owe me. He
‘The money’s decent,’ Castiel admitted with a small shrug. ‘Travel and housing is paid for. It opens doors to the same sort of stuff. But…they want me drunk when I’m on screen.’
didn’t know that,’ Castiel said, interrupting Sam. ‘It doesn’t matter anymore. What’s done is done. Now, give me
Dean stared at the ceiling. He wasn’t okay. Castiel hated him. Sam was drinking demon blood, and Dean was high as fuck on demonic energy. He could feel the corruption seeping through his Grace. He wanted more. He’d have to suffer through withdrawal. Again. It hadn’t been fun the first time, but at least he didn’t have centuries of addiction behind him this time around. He glanced at Sam. He could worry about it later. Right now, Sam needed to be stopped before it was too late. There was still a bit of blood staining Sam’s shirt.
Dean stared at Karen. ‘Fall off? No, he… He took it off himself a while ago, but it never fell off. Um, why?’
Gabriel groaned and covered his eyes with his forearm. ‘Was I too mean?’
Gabriel set his beer on the table. So far, so good. He gave a tentative smile. ‘Uh… Five years ago? It was your twenty-first birthday, and Dean took you drinking. They called in some extra angels to keep you guys safe, and that’s when I first saw you,’ he said fondly. He looked down when Sam’s eyes widened in surprise. ‘I was assigned to be your waiter.’
Sam looked away, slowly shaking his head. ‘
in a good mood, you should see Castiel,’ she replied.
‘Uh… I guess,’ Dean cautiously replied. ‘Don’t know why you’d want that… But uh…sure.’
‘Yeah, and then
‘I’m sorry?’ Balthazar’s smile slipped. ‘Wait. Has this just become some sort of
Karen breathed deeply. She took Bobby’s hand in hers and gave it a squeeze.
Gabriel’s shoulders dropped as Sam started laughing. ‘It’s not funny. I’m mentally scarred for life,’ he said miserably.
Gabriel pouted. It was a great story, and Sam didn't care. Maybe Sam was more of the fiction type. 'Okay. New story!'
He didn't have to fake the nervousness of a young man approaching a pretty girl. He even fumbled and dropped his binding cuff. He could only stare in dismay at the thin, silver cuff that lay on the ground. He was completely red-faced and shocked when the pretty blond angel picked up the cuff and handed it to him with a friendly smile, asking if he'd like another go. The week that followed was absolute hell.
Castiel sputtered as Gabriel shook him excitedly. ‘What?! What did I do?’
‘Some sorta scales,’ Castiel replied. He pulled them free from Balthazar’s fingers and stared at them. ‘Dean gave ‘em to me. They’re from a f…’ He trailed off as he turned them over. He hadn’t really taken the time to examine them properly, either too busy or distracted. They weren’t like normal fish scales. They held a slight iridescence on one side, but the other was dull and more of a pale earth tone. He squinted at the scales as his mind supplied a similarly shaped scale. ‘Pangolin,’ he muttered aloud.
Charlie thought for a moment, bouncing her fork on the table. ‘
‘Impossibly amazing!’ Castiel ran his hand down Dean’s chest and paused before lightly touching where skin turned to scale. ‘How do you change shape? Do you…shed your skin? Does it hurt?’
Sam leaned forward and kissed the tip of Gabriel’s nose. ‘I promise it won’t blow up.’
‘We dress ourselves up and lie,’ Castiel said bitterly. ‘I’ve lied to everyone about who I really am. I’m
Castiel hoisted up the camera he held, and Balthazar took it. He climbed onto the ladder hanging off the edge of the rental boat and out of the water. He didn’t think as he pulled his goggles off and shook the excess water from his hair until he heard Balthazar grunt in approval. He pushed his bangs back and looked over at the camera filming his every move. Irritation raced up his spine, and he could just imagine the
listening! Good. Anyway, it's tradition.'
Dean gave Castiel an uncertain look. ‘Are you sure? I mean, I don’t think now’s the best time for that.’
Dean’s brows furrowed in confusion, then he curled over in pain. He didn’t even see the other spy move. One moment he was fine, the next, his knee hurt like a bitch, and he was gasping for air, clutching his stomach. He still had one hand on Jimmy’s sleeve and refused to let go. He squinted up at Jimmy to find him staring down at him with a sad look.
‘What? No! If I have to choose between a cameraman and my brother, I’m going with my brother,’ Gabriel said.
Dean woke up slowly. He blinked blearily at the lights above him. He had a hard time recalling the previous night. Had he dreamt it? Did he dream up Castiel…Jimmy?
Balthazar rubbed his hand along Castiel’s chest and frowned as his fingers ran over a tough bump under the shirt. He reached through Castiel’s collar, ignoring the annoyed grunt, and pulled out a pair of scales on a length of leather cord. ‘Wha’s this?’ he asked, raking his nail across the ridges.
‘Huh?’
Sam blinked and looked away. It wasn’t Dean. I
Dean nodded.
‘Agreed,’ Dean replied.
Sam looked lost. ‘Do…do you love me?’ he asked. He was almost afraid of the answer. There was the possibility that Gabriel only thought he loved Sam, but if he really did love Sam… He still wasn’t sure how he felt about the angel. He knew he cared deeply for Gabriel, but he didn’t know if he actually loved him yet.
Castiel nodded and followed Gabriel into the kitchen.
Gabriel fell back against the pillows of the lavish king-sized bed he had summoned. ‘Fuck…’
Rahiti looked at Gabriel, then back at Samandriel when Gabriel pointed at the PA. ‘I suppose it could have been a dark blue, but it certainly looked black. It is hard to recall… It turned on us. A dark shadow under the water… It charged our small boat.’
‘Now, hurry up and get wet!’ Charlie said, giving Sam a light shove. ‘Gabe’ll be here any minute!’
You could hurt yourself!’
‘Castiel! Ki—!’ Lucifer’s mouth hung open in surprise.
behaving more calmly. But he was still himself. He still smiled the same. Still acted like he was one step ahead. He calmed down for Sam. ‘He’s in love.’
They ducked just as a blast of energy shot over their heads, blowing up dust and debris.
‘Yeah… I uh...had a friend tape me… I trust Balthazar not to
‘That’s the gist of it.’
Dean winked as he swam backward. ‘Hey, one good thing about my colors,’ he said, ‘I don’t stand out like you would.’
‘B-but…’
Dean paced restlessly. ‘But he’s spending his nights with you,’ he said. He looked up, and Sam nodded reluctantly. ‘Then why can’t Cas spend
‘An angel going through puberty is…quite the event,’ Michael replied. ‘Demons even more so. I can only imagine what a half-breed would do.’ He looked at Crowley and was surprised when the demon looked up with a solemn expression.
‘I know,’ Castiel ground out bitterly. He watched his brother in suspicion. ‘You already told me this.’
Dean nodded as he ran a nail over the engraved wings on the cufflink.
don’t kill him,
‘For ruining our mating ritual. Our wedding.’
After the last page was signed, Karen handed over several sets of keys and pointed to the right. ‘Just head on down that hall and up the stairs. Your rooms are the first three on the right. Dinner will be served at seven in the dining room, which is through that door,’ she said, pointing to the door on the left. ‘Don’t be afraid to ask for anything.’
‘Well, sharing your favorite music would be a better next step compared to sharing your bed,’ Sam said with a warm smile.
'I'm surprised you're aware time exists before noon,' Karen commented.
Bobby whistled and nodded. ‘That’s damned useful.’
Castiel turned the box and looked at where Dean was pointing. ‘Um… Writing? Can you… I thought you could read?’
.-.-.-.-.
‘It’s called “magic”,’ Crowley said as if speaking to a child. ‘If you use the right spells, then you can—’
‘I can see that!’ Balthazar glared at Dean as the other bent over to grab a pair of discarded jeans.
'It's the closest motel to the job,' Dean eventually replied.
Gabriel grinned happily. ‘Oh, I’ll say!’
‘No, you’re right. First, my mom…then my mate… My father…he got it in his head that it was the same shark that killed mom, so he went after it,’ Sam said, shaking his head. ‘Dragged me and Dean along.’
Castiel hesitantly reached up and cupped Dean’s cheek. He nodded when Dean looked at him. ‘I’ll stay,’ he promised.
‘What was?’
‘That’s Ash,’ Sam replied as he sat on the couch. ‘Really smart. Jo’s mom caught him about ten years ago and handed him down to her when she turned sixteen.’
Castiel groaned in frustration as he pulled at his hair. He liked Dean. He liked how Dean looked at him. He would lose that the moment Gabriel told Dean the truth. When people found out about his compulsion, they never looked at him the same way. There was always mistrust behind their eyes. They always questioned what he said, whether or not they were justified. Castiel didn't want to see Dean go through that transformation. He quickly left the living room and exited the house, ignoring Dean’s call for him to come back.
‘Cas…’
Dean loved their waitress. She was everything he thought a truck stop waitress should be: round, rosey-cheeked, slightly graying hair, and flirty. She was perfect. Even though the meal was being comped, he was going to leave her a great tip.
biologist. Emphasis of the “marine.” You can’t pull one over me when it comes to anything fish related.’
Gabriel ducked his head and laughed nervously. ‘I-I’m not cheating on you?’
Dean cut in before Castiel could argue. 'More like a low end hotel,' he told Castiel. 'Beds, bathroom, TV. The essentials.' He patted Castiel's back when he noticed the angel still looked miserable. 'It'll be fine.'
‘I’m okay!’ Dean said as he popped up on the other side. He was blushing brightly, still not completely in control of his fins. He didn’t know why, but he couldn’t bring himself to swim away and leave the human. No, he knew exactly why. He had found that he liked how humans looked. How different their legs were compared to his fins. And their voices… Especially
Dean ran his eyes over the panties. They sparkled brightly, but they would cover Castiel’s crotch. He licked his lips and slowly shook his head. ‘Maybe later,’ he said. He watched as Castiel gathered everything into the skirt and stood. ‘Where are you going?’ he asked as Castiel turned away.
'He got it from Dad,' Gabriel said before Sam could ask. 'I take after Mom; he takes after Dad.'
‘And what’s got you in such a good mood?’ he asked.
Bobby’s eyes softened. ‘Someone had to take care of you kids.’
‘Yes, but I’m not getting up,’ Castiel mumbled.
‘We have another nosey agent in the next room,’ Alastair whispered. ‘You could end this right now. All you have to do is get him to talk. What do you say?’
That’s it! Was going to end it sooner, but figured I tag and epilogue-type-thing on the end. Don’t have personal experience with heavy duty pain meds, so I only know what mini-searches provided. Please forgive me if they don’t work like that. Thank you for reading this weird, little thing and sticking with me!
A commotion came from the kitchen and Dean was pushed backwards through the door. ‘Just one more slice!’ he pleaded.
‘See? You don’t just shoot me down! Can I just take you with me? Ever thought about show business? I’m sure I could justify a gopher on the budget,’ Gabriel said, turning to face Sam. ‘Pretty sure I can at least match whatever you’re getting here.’
, tell me Balthazar doesn’t know.’
Castiel looked back at Dean with a displeased frown. His expression changed to confusion as Dean offered him an apologetic smile while emitting a quite squeal. He leaned back a bit as Dean sat up. The violet fins spread out, framing Dean. ‘This isn’t real,’ he insisted.
Castiel breathed in sharply as coolness hit his back. He relaxed as Dean rubbed it in and a tingling sensation took over. He moan appreciatively as Dean applied a little more of the mysterious goo. ‘That feels nice… What’s in it?’ he asked.
‘No,’ Dean whispered into Castiel’s ear. ‘Keep ‘em on for now.’ He ran his fingers along the seam of Castiel’s jacket where the black wings poked out, dipping them in to rub along the joint.
‘I guess I’m not on the same page,’ Sam said as he watched Gabriel start to dress. ‘Is this Crowley guy good or bad?’
He sighed and looked over at Dean, who was still asleep. He wondered if he should wake the Hunter. He settled on pulling out his phone and sending a text. As he waited for a reply, he watched Dean sleep.
Sam turned away after Dean disappeared into the water. He wondered if he should warn Bobby. Maybe the older man would turn the television crew away from their small hotel. He sighed to himself. He couldn’t ask that of Bobby and Karen. They had given him so much and asked for nothing in return. They had kept his secret when they didn’t have to, and even asked him if he was comfortable with the crew staying at the hotel.
The voices vanished, and Charlie bristled, glaring at the hall. ‘Cas is a nice guy,’ she muttered. ‘He made
Castiel fled the panic room and ran out to the junkyard.
A cough pulled him from his thoughts, and he turned to find Gabriel leaning against the doorframe. ‘I wanted to make certain that he was going to be all right,’ he said.
‘What?’ Castiel was thrown by the sudden change in subject.
‘Okay… That’s…good?’ Gabriel chewed on his lip as he stuck his gun in the back of his pants. It didn’t seem like Sam was lying. His memories were a little fuzzy on the moments before Castiel had shot him. He stepped up to the bed and grabbed a pillow. He removed the pillow sham and went back to his pile. Looking over his shoulder at Sam, he stuffed everything into the sham. He quickly looked away and stood.
‘I wish I were…’ Lucifer looked around as the light in the room intensified. ‘Unfortunately, our conversation must end. You will tell no one of this, Castiel.’
his wings. Sam was polite, but Castiel could tell the younger brother was still wary.
‘Oh, my.’
‘Well, I just passed him in the hall, and he uh…went on and on about how it’s your fault he got fired… After he flirted with me,’ Samandriel said before picking up his glass of water. ‘He said he won’t be joining us for dinner.’
Sam stopped and stared at Gabriel. ‘W-what? Are you…?’
boat.’
‘So… You’re saying that we shouldn’t simplify the spell so much?’ Sam said, turning back to the pile of notes on Dean’s desk.
‘Who are you dating? Him or the car?’ Sam said with a laugh.
'...You're jealous,' she said in revelation. '
‘Or…I could always gag you,’ Sam said as he lay back, pulling Gabriel with him.
Sam was leaning over one of the dining room tables, preparing it for the next meal. He set down the last glass he had been carrying and shot up straight as a hand sharply met his ass. He let out a high pitched chirp and spun to meet Gabriel’s amused stare. ‘G-Gabriel! What…?!’
Gabriel looked at his clipboard and replaced his sucker. ‘I can release him…Tuesday.’
‘I’m doing okay, too. Got myself sorted. Thank you for your concern,’ Gabriel said to the spot where Castiel had been standing.
took it?’ he eventually asked.
as my mom,’ Dean said as he entered the basement.
‘We can leave, so you two can finish,’ Jody offered, still not taking her eyes off Dean.
‘As entertaining as this is, Cas and I have somewhere to be,’ Balthazar said. He gave a dismissive glance to Dean and smiled at Castiel. His smile froze as his eyes landed on the dark bruise just on the left side of Castiel’s neck. His eyes quickly flicked to Dean’s neck to find a matching love bite in almost the same spot. His lips thinned as he closed his eyes and took a deep breath. When he reopened his eyes, he smiled brightly at Castiel. ‘Shall we?’
‘W-what?’ Castiel swallowed. Did Balthazar know?
Dialogue lifted from S5E01.
‘You know what I mean,’ Gabriel snapped as he lay back and stared at the ceiling. He sighed as Castiel looked away. ‘Sorry I flipped out on your fish.’
Castiel shot up and stared ahead in shock as his perfect world crumbled away. He watched, first in horror then bemusement, as Balthazar barged into the bedroom with a very naked Dean trailing behind. ‘Good morning, Balthazar,’ he said, schooling his features. He had trouble maintaining eye contact with Dean’s bare legs and chest tempting him.
‘Dean…’
Castiel gasped and twisted to lean over Dean. He struggled to pull Dean onto his lap and held his Hunter close as he sobbed helplessly. There was commotion outside his room, and he heard his door swing open, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. If Lucifer’s minions were there to defend their leader, then so be it. He didn’t want to live. Not with what he had done, and what he was unable to prevent.
Out of fear, the humans sought a way to control the angels. They created a spell and inscribed it to a metal cuff. The spell would bind an angel to the human that placed the cuff on the angel's right wrist.
‘Excuse you! I’m a
Castiel stared in dismay at his computer screen. His brother had sent him yet another photograph and article on a mysterious animal that had been washed ashore. With a sigh, he scratched at his day-old stubble and set to writing his brother a strongly worded letter on whale carcasses. Photographs included.
Benny followed Dean’s gaze and gave his shoulder an encouraging squeeze. ‘It’s just a scar. Pretty good lookin’ one, too.’
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel pulled Dean’s arm over his shoulder. He ran his hand over Dean’s rear before resting it on a hip. ‘You passed a Thai restaurant this morning,’ he said as they made their way to the entrance of the building. ‘I thought we might try that for dinner. The restaurant is clean, and the employees have passed the background check.’
‘Good. Now that

Dean rolled his eyes and slouched even further in the chair.
‘Dean’s not my
‘Good!’ Gabriel replied. ‘Glad to hear it.’ He searched the younger angel’s eyes. He tentatively reached out and felt reassured. Satisfied, he nodded and clapped Castiel on the back. ‘Now let’s introduce you to a genre if film I
‘Job’s yours,’ Crowley said as he checked his phone. He grimaced at one of the messages he had received. ‘Lucifer’s found his way into my private library.’
Dean threw their bags on the beds. 'Alright, me an' Sam'll take this one, and you two'll take that one,' he said as he pointed.
Castiel nodded before swimming off to the shore.
‘Well, that’s good news,’ Anna said. She raised her own camera—a beat-up looking thing with small, plastic film canisters taped to the strap. ‘Do you think you could point us in the direction of some good views?’
Sam sat next to Gabriel on the bed as he listened. He grunted as Gabriel leaned heavily against him.
‘And if fighting the spell is like fighting the cuff, then Cas is putting himself through hell,’ Dean pointed out. ‘We gotta get to him, quick.’
Dean leaned back and pulled Castiel along with him as he lay back. ‘I’d like that,’ he said as he pulled Castiel on top of him and kissed his neck.
Castiel blinked and desperately grabbed for the out Anna had unwittingly given him. ‘Ye—’
‘Hey, there!’
‘If you’re gonna get me in the water without a tank, I’m gonna be wearing floaties or a life jacket or
‘Cas,’ Balthazar hissed as he gently took Castiel by the arm and led him a few feet away. ‘You don’t know anything about this guy!’
‘Thank you,’ Castiel whispered.
‘I’ll say,’ Castiel moaned. ‘I have whipped cream and a list of my favorite porns,’ he said as he lifted his shopping bag. He groaned as Balthazar nipped at his neck. ‘H-here…’ He held out the bag to Dean.
Crowley shot her a glare. ‘Anna, bring me the box.’
Sam stared at the ceiling. He knew he was hallucinating. He tried to ignore the visions, but they kept coming, kept saying the right things, the things that hurt him most. He turned his head away from the latest one to find Dean leaning against the door.
have to give him a reason to be here.’
Castiel’s breath caught. His cock was touching Dean’s entrance, ready to plunge in. There was something about the way Dean had said it, and possibly Castiel’s own fantasies, that made him think that Dean meant more than just wanting him for that night. His eyes softened as he tilted his head to the left, brushing off the insane thought. ‘All yours,’ he said as he pushed into Dean, moaning at the tight warmth of Dean’s ass.
Castiel blushed and looked down. ‘That might be part of it,’ he admitted.
‘That’s…impossible,’ Karen insisted. ‘I’ve only met two angels capable of smiting and they… They’re…’
‘Do you really think this’ll work?’ Sam asked.
Dean narrowed his eyes at the small angel. ‘What do you mean?’
Karen turned back to Crowley and held her hand out in greeting. ‘My name is Karen. You must Gabriel and Castiel’s father. It’s good to meet you!’
'Why not?!' he yelled. 'My...
‘I would offer to help, but…I don’t want anything but your own power to be flowing through you,’ Castiel said. He traced his fingers along Dean’s jaw and to his lips. ‘I…I really do think this will work.’
. He rushed to the kitchen in time to see the pretty redhead approach
Once Gabriel was sure that Charlie was well out of earshot, he flinched and hissed sharply.
‘My boyfriend’s brother owns this place,’ Gabriel said through gritted teeth. ‘Cas, I need a word with you.’
Dean laughed and ruffled Castiel’s hair. ‘Hey, it’s not that bad. You’ll get better! I promise. You just need some practice. Your uh…dad said he’s havin’ some easy monsters shipped out for you to practice on, so…that’s good, right?’
to go. One night was bad enough with him hanging off me like nothing happened. I don’t think I can handle much more.’
legs. Apparently, they were somehow interchangeable? How the hell did
Gabriel stared at Sam in disbelief. Sam had a long, pale yellow tail with deep blue markings.
‘Yes. No. Er…’ Dean stared at the shell-like earrings. They framed Castiel’s face, and he looked beautiful in them. ‘Keep them in. And I mean
'Great. We've got a homicidal angel on our hands,' Dean said as he crossed his arms. He looked up at Sam. 'So, what do we do about him?'
‘Striped?’ Gabriel watched Castiel warily.
‘Just a patch. Gilda stopped me from going all out,’ she explained.
Crowley shook his head in disgust. ‘Yes, yes. We were the talk of the company.’
‘Hey. Don’t knock it ‘til you try it,’ Dean said defensively.
'You don't think you deserve to be saved.'
,’ Crowley said.
‘Oh. So tomorrow…?’ Dean asked, his disappointment clear.
Castiel let out a short laugh as he stood. He turned and leaned over the railing, staring at the water below. ‘I guess I didn’t want to come back to my “normal” life…’ He glanced up as Balthazar settled next to him.
. And he won’t remember it in the morning, so there’s nothing to worry about.’
.-.-.-.-.
‘What do you want? What am I going to owe you?’ Castiel asked as he paced the bungalow. He stopped as he exited onto the terrace and looked out at the darkening sky. He had to admit, the view was amazing.
.-.-.-.-.
Castiel took the box from Dean and tossed it aside before grabbing the collar of Dean’s shirt and pulling him in for a deep kiss. He moaned loudly as Dean’s hands roamed over his body. ‘Oh, God…’
Castiel muttered to himself as an insistent pounding grew louder. The bed shifted, and he rolled over, smiling as soft fur pressed against his face. Everything was perfect. For once, his life felt like it was going right. There was nothing that could go wr—
‘Adam,’ he growled, throwing in a threatening series of clicks.
Castiel’s eyes followed Benny, not missing the irritated look Benny gave Dean. ‘So…Benny is your brother?’ he asked.
The song faded into more of a low hum, and Castiel turned to face Sam and Bobby. He frowned at the pained expressions the humans wore. ‘He was singing,’ he explained. ‘You may not fully understand, but…to hear Dean…
Gabriel cocked his head slightly. ‘Winchester… Sounds familiar. Well, Sam, how about them worms?'
to answer it,’ Dean said with a tremor of desperation. ‘How many times have you lied to me today?!
Castiel nodded and sat at the table, and large bowl of cereal was set before him, and he looked up to see Karen’s smiling face.
The moment Castiel felt Dean’s thoughts slip back to focus solely on Anna, his wings flapped out aggressively. ‘I asked you politely.’
Gabriel looked over at Dean. In his distraction, he missed Castiel coming out from behind the door. He doubled over when a fist connected with his stomach. He didn’t bother fighting to keep hold of the gun as Castiel wrenched it from his hand. He coughed as he grinned up at Castiel. ‘Cheater.’
Bobby grunted in reply.
‘Oh, um… Yes,’ Castiel said uncertainly. He had fully been expecting Balthazar to say something. He looked up at Dean. ‘I guess I’ll see you later.’
‘No shit!’ Dean rolled his eyes and left the kitchen, hoping to find Castiel soon.
Dean leaned back and flattened his fins. He had prepared himself for a wide variety of reactions, but he hadn’t been expecting to be accused of being a hoax. He gasped as a bucket of water was tossed over him and Castiel.
to add to the spell and make it stronger than to pick it apart and use certain bits.’
Dean shrugged. ‘I just wanted to know if he meant coffee as in the drink or coffee as in sex,’ he explained. ‘Never had coffee, and he didn’t believe me, so… I thought he meant sex?’
can answer ‘em when he’s awake. The only one you need to worry ‘bout is this one,’ Bobby said as he placed a cordless phone into Castiel’s hand. ‘You uh…you
‘Shut up,
‘Gabriel… Wait. Gabriel Novak?’
‘He takes after his mother,’ Michael softly replied. ‘She could adapt to any situation, but she…’
‘Jody…hello. Um, yes. It’s…very nice,’ Castiel replied. ‘I’m trying to reach Crowley.’
‘Since when have I ever had a good idea?’
Sam stared down at the broken angel. Castiel could smite three supernatural beings at once. It was unheard of. And he did on
‘I’ll take the cuff off in a minute,’ Dean promised. ‘I just wanna see something first. If any of this makes you uncomfortable, let me know, and I’ll stop. Okay?’
Dean nodded, not trusting his voice and hoping he wasn't blushing.
‘Present?’ Samandriel repeated. He looked to Charlie for a clue when Gabriel left the room. Charlie shrugged and shook her head. ‘Guess we’ll find out later…’
‘Cas?’ Gabriel offered a smile as he pushed his sunglasses on top of his head. ‘I thought you were leaving?’
‘One week. If I can’t do it, you’re free to go.’
Some dialogue lifted from S4E22.
‘Next time, I’ll schedule you some extra time,’ Samandriel said as he sat down on the bed and pulled up the script for the episode they were working on.
'Um... I was...watching you sleep,' Castiel said.
‘Huh?’
‘Then get over here and let’s
Benny was enjoying himself, lounging in his foldup lawn chair and fishing quietly. He jumped when he heard a loud thump come from the stern. He sighed wearily as he set his fishing pole aside and turned to look at Dean. ‘I thought you had someone else to bother,’ he said. ‘Or did it turn sour?’
to do, I just don’t know
The years wore on. At first, he was angry and spiteful. He led the virtuous astray in an attempt to get a reaction from his Father. He started wars between peaceful peoples; a rumor here or a stolen treasure there. When he found out that the demons were changing...recruiting humans into their ranks. He learned from them and shared his newfound knowledge with humans just how easy it was to summon a crossroads demon. The demons became so overwhelmed, they had to reorganize. But it was all for naught. His Father remained silent.
Dean frowned as Castiel’s tone shifted from frantic to monotone. ‘Well… It’s more intuitive… But uh… Hey! Let’s do it later. In private. Sorry, I uh… I got caught up in the moment,’ he said as he unwrapped his tail from Castiel, his fins going down to his sides and only flaring out enough to keep him afloat. ‘You’re supposed to be measuring us, not getting freaky with me in the water!’
. Unfortunately, my belief doesn’t make me exempt from being in charge of underwater shots.’
‘Um… We need to talk…’
Castiel pulled back, staring at his brother in shock. ‘W-what?! No! I just needed to calm my nerves! I didn’t mean to… I wasn’t supposed to get
‘Not planning to,’ Crowley muttered. He looked from Dean to Castiel and back. Castiel was sobbing uncontrollably. He had seen his friend like this before, and he had ended up with a black eye. That was the last time he had offered any form of physical comfort. ‘Though I am a bit surprised that he’s letting
Dean vanished under the water, and Sam watched as the dark shadow of his brother faded into the distance. For Sam, it was too much too fast. Dean, Charlie, and the film crew. He could have probably handled two of the three. With a heavy sigh, he headed back to the hotel, intent on making his map.
Castiel blushed deeper and jumped at the sound of cutlery slamming into a plate. He glanced up and saw his brother glaring at Dean, fork stabbed into the small pile of french toast.
with me?’
.-.-.-.-.
Dean frowned as Castiel leaned into Balthazar’s touch. ‘Well, I’ll be helpin’ out Benny… So…’
Gabriel was straddling Sam's lap, one hand buried in Sam's hair. Sam's arms were wrapped around the small angel, fingers laced through golden feathers. They both wore shocked expressions and were staring at Dean.
Both Hunter and angel gasped at the sensation that fell over them. It was much stronger than the easy warmth they had felt before.
‘It’s not exactly...culturally acceptable.’
‘That’s why I make the big bucks,’ Gabriel smugly replied.
‘I wouldn’t expect you to,’ Castiel said.
Dean grinned as he held up the pizza box. ‘Got your order right here. One meat pizza.
‘Come on!’ Dean shouted as he limped out from behind the table. He raised his gun and shot the man Castiel held in the head. ‘I had it under control.’
Dean cocked his head to the side as he regarded Sam. ‘You’re so helpless, Sammy. All of you are, really.’
boyfriend,’ Balthazar reiterated as Dean shook his head. ‘Crowley.’
Castiel sighed and wished he could be as positive about it as Gabriel. He supposed he shouldn't worry about Karen's reaction until morning. He turned off the TV and was about get comfortable when Gabriel tugged on his wing.
‘Not every…’ Gabriel trailed off, recalling just how many supposed roommates he had met. The number kept going up. ‘You slut!’ he shouted, throwing one of his pillows at Castiel.
'I can feel you,' Gabriel said with a hinting tone. He quickly back pedaled at Sam's unamused glare. 'Er, sort of. I mean, you, yeah. But that's this thing working,' he said as he showed his binding cuff. 'Other humans...they're more...blurry. If you're asking me to find Dean-o, then... I'm guessing he's the only other human here, so...that way?' Gabriel pointed at the wall.
'Just eat the damned thing, Castiel!' Gabriel shouted in annoyance.
up the ass!’ Sam exclaimed in annoyance.
meant for each other,’ Crowley said with a snarky grin. ‘The, ah…
Lucifer backed away, shaking his head. ‘You’re quite the fighter… Very well. You don’t have to tell me. Not that it matters. I already know where to find you.’
! God, Dean… You can’t take advantage of people like that.’
Dean pulled back, admiring the shy smile Castiel gave him. ‘Sure thing,’ he promised. ‘Now, let’s test that flexibility of yours.’
Castiel sat on the edge of his bed, wondering how far he could make it if tried to escape. He looked up as Lucifer entered the room. He quickly cast his eyes downward and hugged himself. ‘What do you want?’ he asked in a hoarse whisper.
Dean yelped and curled in on himself as his good foot rammed into his broken ankle in an effort to shift his position. He groaned as the movement only caused him more pain. He was vaguely aware of a concerned voice calling his name and gentle fingers running over his hair. He looked up and gave Castiel a pained smile. ‘I’m good,’ he said.
‘Merfolk can hold their breath for a minimum of thirty minutes,’ Castiel said, his voice evening out. Facts were safe. Facts didn’t involve the future.
The popping of the bulb calmed Dean slightly, and he grinned at Castiel. ‘That’s just…wow! I’m sorry, Cas, but… That’s priceless!’ He roughly wrapped an arm around the angel’s shoulders and guided him toward the stairs. ‘Tell ya’ what, we’ll hole up in my room.’
.-.-.-.-.
‘That’s
‘I think he’s doing pretty damn good,’ Jody said, smiling and nodding at Dean. ‘I can’t imagine what the culture shock was like for you. I went to Scotland to meet Roddy’s mother and that threw me through one hell of a loop. And I had warning!’
‘Out here, dear!’ Jody’s voice called out.
When Charlie mentions ‘locals,’ she means the local wildlife. A stab jacket is also known as a BCD or buoyancy compensator.
Jody casually sipped at a glass of orange juice before giving her husband a side-glance. ‘You think you’re being clever, Fergus, but you’re not. Remember, I read your diary, and I’m fluent in asshole.’
Gabriel gently pushed against Sam’s chest and tried to give him a stern stare. ‘I’m still mad at you, though.’
‘Clive Barker is amazing,’ Castiel said enthusiastically. ‘He’s got a horror video game. The atmosphere in it is great, and the designs are...not great, but like everyone dies!’
‘No, not yet,’ Castiel replied. ‘I’m still getting settled in with my brother.’
‘Yeah, I kinda noticed,’ Sam replied, flexing his fins.
Castiel looked up at Dean and vacated the chair. ‘I was reading what you had found,’ he replied. ‘I didn’t touch anything.’
‘Cas…’ Dean sighed and reached out for Castiel again. ‘Will you get over here?’
‘You can’t control--’
‘Uh-huh.’ Charlie shifted her gaze to Sam as he joined Gabriel on the boat. She caught Sam’s eye and raised her brows in question. She let out a long breath when Sam gave her a slight nod. ‘Well… Good luck, you two,’ she said. She waved as Gabriel started the engine. ‘You’re gonna need it,’ she added under breath. She reassured herself that hitting Gabriel over the head with proof of mermaids was the best way.
Gabriel sat up as he let Sam scoot back and out of his shorts. He licked his lips at the sight of Sam spread out on the bed. ‘I think…I’m gonna ride you tonight,’ he declared as he slowly kissed and nipped his way up from Sam’s knees to his neck. He paused and reached into the nightstand, pulling out the small container of lube. He tried to ignore the smiling cherries on the label as he handed it to Sam. ‘Here. You get me ready while I work on you.’
Gabriel shook his arms out before facing the camera again. ‘Right… Okay… Bora Bora…’
mating rituals very well, but he knew mermaid rituals inside and out.
Sam rubbed his neck in embarrassment as his fins pressed closer around him. ‘Poor planning on my part…’
.-.-.-.-.
‘What are you gonna…owe him?’
‘Oh. Good.’ Castiel smiled as he licked his lips. He couldn’t wait to show off his costume in front of Dean. He hoped he was still the same size.
and Crowley?!’ He broke off in another wave of chuckles.
Castiel frowned and tilted his head. 'That's not a TV.'
‘Thanks, Sammy,’ Dean said, looking gratefully at Sam.
Sam looked away, unable to come up with anything that could possibly comfort his brother. As much as he didn’t like Dean courting the marine biologist, he didn’t want to see him miserable, either.
Dean looked up from inspecting his fork. ‘Uh, yeah. He’s been dry a few years and has it down.’
'W-what's wrong with your wings?!' Karen exclaimed.
expecting.’
.-.-.-.-.
‘I don’t need it,’ Dean insisted. He could already feel the fentanyl kicking in. He yelped and stared at Castiel in betrayal. ‘I have a high pain threshold when people aren’t fucking poking me!’ He sighed and thrust out his arm. ‘Fine! Get it over with.’
Castiel’s heart beat quickly with anticipation as he reached in. His fingers brushed against something hard. At first he thought it was a guitar pick, but it was too rough. He grasped it between his thumb and index finger and pulled it free of the pocket.
actually took self-defense courses.’
‘Dammit, Dean! I’m a threat to you and your family!’ Castiel shouted. ‘Release me!’
Gabriel rolled his eyes. He caught the change in tone. The man believed his story. At least, the parts he wasn’t exaggerating. He turned to Charlie and nodded his head toward the path. She rolled her eyes as she shook her head before waving him off.
When Sam and Dean entered their motel room, Dean threw himself onto one of the beds with a groan.
‘You been really into studying your merman?’ Gabriel asked.
‘I wish things were different,’ Sam said as he took Gabriel’s hand in his.
Dean leaned back down and kissed Castiel hard. ‘Just left a little note for the competition,’ he said softly.
Dean stared up at Castiel. He wasn’t quite sure what he was feeling from the angel. Embarrassment, uncertainty, lust…a large helping of lust. What did Meg say to Castiel?
Dean laced his fingers through Castiel’s hair. He let his hand slide from the top of Castiel’s head to cup his cheek. ‘Cas, I…’ He broke off with a soft smile. ‘Here,’ he said, handing Castiel a small plastic bag.
,’ he pointed out.
Dean nodded as he trailed his hand over the doorjamb. ‘Well, when you feel like it…I’ll be in bed, waiting… Sam and Gabe are in the living room watching God knows what.’ He sighed and turned toward the stairs, leaving Castiel alone in the basement.
Through the years, Bobby began noticing emotions that weren't his own. Small at first, but with each passing year, they became stronger and more distinct. He then realized the cuff's connection was giving him a small glimpse into Karen's thoughts.
Castiel stared at Dean with wide eyes. ‘Really. You don’t like my soap, so you’re trying to barter a shark dive? Isn’t that a little disproportional?’
Gabriel laughed and took a sip of his drink. He set the glass back on the thick, wooden table and shook his head. ‘Well, he sent the other guy to the hospital. Not as heroic as it sounds,’ he said. ‘He kicked the guy in the knee and dislocated his kneecap.’
Castiel took a quick look around the kitchen. Sam and Gabriel were nowhere to be seen—more than likely, Gabriel had escorted Sam well out of Anna’s range. Bobby sat the table across from Balthazar, both watching with interest. Karen was stirring a sauce, staring at the wall with a look of mild confusion. And Dean was back to staring at Anna. No one would defend him.
'Besides,' Dean continued, looking to Gabriel, 'he can help us find this Trickster.'
Castiel nodded and groaned.
, and then the Daphne character slaughtered Shaggy with an axe!’
‘I’m a compulsive liar,’ Cas replied with a grin. ‘He thinks you’ll hate him for not telling you.’ He turned to look at Dean. ‘I fooled you,’ he sing-songed as he crawled completely onto Dean’s lap.
of. Were there others? Just how many times had Castiel smote something or someone?
‘Oh, that’s it. We’re getting pizza, and I’m making you watch Indiana Jones. All three of them. In a row.’
Dean nodded as he hopped in the car and adjusted the seat.
‘One…? Oh. Oh!’ Gabriel’s eyes darted down, remembering what Castiel had told him. ‘This is gonna sound weird, but… Um… Er… Fuck. What’s your cock look like?’
‘Huh? Wait, what are… Where are we going?’ Gabriel whined. Sam’s smile did little to put him at ease. He was quickly led inside and turned in time to see the few scattered raindrops turn into a heavy drizzle. ‘What’s wrong, Sammy? Don’t like being caught in the rain?’
! Inias, I could probably understand, but
‘I don’t know. Why do you—’
‘With
Castiel searched for words to describe what he felt. 'Nice...pure.'
Castiel hugged himself and edged along the counter to the door to outside. ‘I-I’m sorry,’ he whispered. ‘I tried… I-I can’t… Please stop me,’ he said, no longer able to fight Lucifer’s command. He darted out the door, leaving Gabriel alone in the kitchen.
‘Protection
Castiel smirked and leaned against Dean, running his hand down Dean’s chest. ‘I can arrange that…’
Anna sighed. ‘I didn’t know he was that attached to you,’ she admitted. ‘And…he knows just what to say to piss me off.’
Dean cringed, his fins going flat against him. ‘That’s not natural.’
‘There. That’s better.’ Gabriel flicked the lights on, and his attention was immediately caught by a shelf lined with sparkling snow globes. Another shelf was lined with sea shell creatures covered in glitter. He quickly turned the lights back off. ‘And that’s
Dean rested his tail against Castiel’s back, gently pushing the biologist forward. ‘I’m very real.’
‘When will he be back?’
Crowley nodded and waved her away. ‘Don’t answer any of the older Hunter’s questions. Or anyone’s questions, for that matter.’
Karen nodded. ‘He was testing the bond. Anything to make Sam snap at him, order him to stop…’ She smiled to herself as she cracked a couple eggs. ‘I burned the house down during my first week with Bobby,’ she admitted. ‘We stood outside, staring at the smoking remains… I hadn’t meant to burn it down. I
‘Cas?’
sex tape! Your brother is
Dean sagged. 'Aw, c'mon!'
, I understood and expected. I… I broke up with you because I thought you had cheated on me with Crowley. …Um…Cas? Castiel? Are you crying?’
‘He does that?’
‘Yeah,’ Sam said with a nod. ‘Same thing happened with Bobby. After the first year of being here…I got caught in the rain.’
'Do you know anything about what happened in Elm Creek?' Sam asked when Ruby walked into view.
Castiel shook his head. ‘Of course she wasn’t,’ he replied.
'Oh. Sure,' Sam replied and looked to Dean.
Two more men entered the room, one wheeling in a small cart full of pristinely glittering tools. The other man pulled the heavy chair in the corner forward before moving to unchain Dean.
‘Shh.’ Sam pulled Gabriel forward and lightly kissed his lips. ‘I think I do remember a little…’
making a fool of him.’
Dean laughed and took a step to the side. His ankle gave out, and he went down, fast.
‘I guess you’ll be needing something to tie it with, too,’ Benny said as he bent down and pulled a small drill bit from the toolbox.
'Huh? Oh...uh, yeah. Sure,' Dean replied, snapping out of his musings. He led Castiel up the stairs. The door to the computer room was shut, which was odd. He brushed it off as unimportant and pushed the door open. 'Hey, Ga—!' He halted at the sight before him.
it! They think you should do all of your segments drunk!’
.-.-.-.-.
‘Yeah…I’m good. Just…keeping an eye out,’ he replied.
‘I assure you, whips were not part of 30s and 40s casual wear.’
‘Castiel, go…stand in the corner,’ Dean said, not once taking his eyes off the angel.
‘Gabe? Gabriel? Is that you?’
‘Three…’ Dean could have sworn his heart stopped. ‘Three years?’ he repeated, his voice wavering. ‘Did you follow me…everywhere.’ At Castiel’s nod, he felt his cheeks heat up. ‘I-including the Roadhouse?’
‘We already spoke to him, Gabriel,’ Sam said as he stroked his angel’s hair. ‘Michael’s not going to kill Crowley
‘A demon is not your… Never mind. Gabriel…’ Michael shook his head and pointed at the door. ‘Come out of that room this instant.’
