When Cas arrived, Silla was delighted to inspect the house and grounds. Dean had a bag of gourmet doggie biscuits for her, and he poured a big bowl of water in the kitchen and didn’t bat an eye when her lapping made it slosh onto the floor.
He usually had better decorum when informing the families of murder victims of their loved-one’s death, but seeing
“This was the end of the original house. The rest of the rooms from here on down were additions. Dad said when the wall was open he hid a treasure box—an old cigar box with baseball cards and half dollars and chewing gum wrappers with jokes on them—he put his treasure box in the wall so it was boarded up.”
In preparation, he finally traded away his precious etui for a tattered great coat to cover himself with when they left the tropical waters and inevitably hit a frostier climate.
The stranger smiled and then bowed to offer introduction: “Castiel Milton, at your service. I’m something like a fifth cousin of Princess Jessica’s, and since I’m single and literate, the family decided to add me to her dowry.”
Dean scratched at the back of his own neck and searched for something to say to the guy that would pull him out of his sad headspace and into the helpfulness. Before he could speak, though, Novak looked up.
Dean huffed but did as he was told, but not before dumping a generous amount of hair oil over Castiel’s head. “Scrub yourself, alpha,” he insisted, as he squirmed out of his shirt.
His sister-in-law was not cowed by pregnant omega fits of temper, and she spoke out first. “It is simply not done, Dean,” Jessica insisted.
Normally, even Castiel might be eager for a few days’ interlude in the city, just to escape the now-crowded castle. Plus, Castiel had an important letter to deliver to the palace. But he was in no mood to deliver it personally. Though he had written it, painstakingly and precisely on the day after Dean had raced to Crowley’s with the pertinent news from the Regent, he had not sent it by the mail coach because he technically still had need of a discussion with the duke before doing so, and he had hoped there might be some delay before any of their party went to the capital in order to deliver it anyway. But alas. It seemed the delay was destined to be very brief, indeed. Castiel would prepare the letter for his brother to deliver on his behalf as he prepared himself to talk to Dean’s brother about its contents. He gingerly touched his bruised eye and sighed.
When Colonel Milton looked over Dean’s shoulder at the nervous looking omega footman, the alpha growled louder, possessively.
“Yes,” Castiel ground out. “You are a grown man. It is outrageous that you are expected to contribute to the household in the way that you do and then earn nothing for it!” Castiel seemed truly outraged.
Mick was harried and grumpy. He didn’t have stalls for so many horses while the stables were still being repaired. Ketch was completely focused on his husband’s concerns. Charlie had no idea of the answer to the question, and Gabriel was busy fending off new equine friends who were attracted to the carrot still dangling from his pocket. Balthazar looked to Castiel, who finally focused on Dean.
Inside, he found that Missouri and James both had massive smiles on their faces. Dean was ushered to her table while Missouri, who was evidently using her large hearth to bake bread for the evening’s feast, made him a plate of bread and cheese to match the one already in front of James. Though he had just eaten pudding, Dean was constantly hungry and did not protest the snack.
“Yeah, me too.” Dean pulled his tobacco pouch out and tapped and rolled a cigarette, looking up to meet the stranger’s eyes as he licked the paper. He watched the man’s eyes follow the progress of his tongue.
Castiel is pliant under Dean's hand as the Righteous Man drags the angel to the sink in Bobby Singer's spartan kitchen and washes the blood away. The pink swirls down the drain on white suds.
Dean did wonder, however, when his husband saw Sir Rafael on his way back to the capital to attend his business, what Castiel had meant when he told the man to, “Let me know about the name!”
Dean needed no more prompting than that to throw his arms around Castiel’s neck and smile his own bright smile. Castiel crushed Dean in his arms and touched his cheek and then, before Dean could have a hope of backing away to save himself from the onslaught, Castiel crashed his mouth onto Dean’s smiling lips. The kiss was like a wayward boat buffeted against a jagged shore: at first all teeth and surprise. But soon Castiel’s tongue plunged into Dean’s open mouth, and the omega’s knees went weak. Castiel chased the kiss and moved his embrace to support Dean flush against his body. He kissed as a starved man who had finally got a taste of the world’s sweetest fruit. He couldn’t get enough and wouldn’t stop for the world.
“It’s been rather wet, hasn’t it?” Castiel asked, as though everyone hadn’t heard the thunder all morning.
Cas nodded. “He’s the oldest, so yes. But I’ve been trying to reach him for two days, and I’ve got no answer, so I’m calling Sam.”
The pause went on long enough that Gabriel got an inkling of his misstep. “You have seen someone deteriorated by this drug, Mister Singer.”
Through the years, Dean thought back on it sometimes— to those days when Baby Jack was brand new, and when Castiel did not yet have streaks of gray in his hair. Before Samantha and Bobbie were born, the twins with opposite personalities, before Colt, who was supposed to be their last, and before Alexander, who really was their last… Dean thought back to those early days with Castiel when they wrapped themselves around each other and supported each other through the days of uncertainty, through letter-writing battles against the crown’s greed, through not knowing what to do when a baby would not stop crying, through being knocked awake in their bed when any resident’s cistern sprung a leak in the night, or through crowds of worried people flocking to their door when news of a faraway railway accident reached the town.
“What?” Sam demanded, stepping into the room fully with a gesture to his wife to remain in the corridor.
Dean ran a hand down his face, and the fire in his eyes went out. “Yeah.” He reached for the car door handle. “Yeah. It’s … you’re just doing your job, man, but to me, it’s family.”
Normally not one to comply with typical omega stereotypes, Dean was helpless against the wedding fever.
The joint was lively. A band played from an elevated stage where a young woman with rouged knees sang a somewhat racy song about everybody loving her baby. Dean figured most of the lyrics were double-entendre or slang, but the only slang he really knew was from the detective stories he read.
On that pronouncement, Castiel swiftly bid everyone good evening and practically carried Dean to bed.
As Detective Novak drove to the morgue, Winchester sitting silently beside him, he forced himself to work the case. He didn’t believe in coincidences. What were the odds of the musician playing in the same town, on the same night, when Singer was murdered? Yes, he had an airtight alibi as thousands of screaming fans could attest, but his brother... not so much.
bed with them and their boyfriend. You’re a casual-bi. You actually committing to a man will kill the sales.”
"Detained? Did we not have a meeting scheduled? Did we not agree to an exchange of gifts and promises?"
Despite the beard and the wild mane of hair, despite the tattered clothes and the pronounced limp, Dean would know his mate anywhere.
Castiel approached and leaned forward to peer at it in the light from the window. It was two letters intertwined with a delicate vinework of wildflowers.
Sam tore open the letter and gasped, “It’s from Bobby,” he muttered. “Mr. Singer,” he clarified for the younger ladies. “He’s in the capital doing some recruiting to bring more people to Winchester, and he says the entire community is a tinderbox. Since he is no longer an insider among them, he isn’t sure of when, but he says the citizens of Glassblowers Street are planning to riot against the landlords and the soldiers who demand higher payment or immediate eviction.”
Eileen accepted this information but asked a different question, “How did the feather call you? Is that how you put it before?”
Gabriel’s eyes lit up. “I’ll bet you five pounds that Balthazar will purchase a steam pump for the town! We can have the townsfolk pay a subscription for their fresh water to come in and the foul water to go out.”
, ate virtually alone. Lost in his own thoughts, the meal was all but over when he realized he had used the same fork for every course and the same knife to cut his meat and to butter his bread. Mortified at his flagrant misstep in table manners, he felt obliged to eat absolutely everything on his plate so as not to appear wasteful and frivolous with the household goods in front of Ketch and Adam. His belly was achingly full when he belatedly remembered the sow out back with her piglets that would have wanted his table scraps. If he had a shiny penny for every time he was filled with mortification during that meal for how he sat, how he ate, how he wallowed in his thoughts—especially for assuming Castiel would be as eager as he was to spend more time together—well, Dean’s pockets would be heavy, indeed.
Dean’s ire was piqued. “I came out here for my own purposes. If you followed me, then I must ask you to go back where you came from.”
Dean finally looked up, and there it was. Unmasked and raw from laudanum and emotion, the look of bald and overweening adoration on Castiel’s face was enough to make Dean’s hands shake and his stomach churn. No one had ever looked at Dean this way. No one had ever shown him bare affection, not since his mother had died, not since little Sammy had trusted Dean with his heart’s secrets as a small boy. In all the years Dean had spent raising up his brother to be a strong alpha, to be a good student, to be a young man poised to escape the life of poverty and degradation they had known all their lives; in all the lonely years since knowing he was nothing but a poor omega and believing he would rather die alone than be some rutting alpha’s bitch; in all his wildest dreams in the throws of heats and in the shame of the days that followed them, Dean had never dared to imagine a face like Castiel’s, a man like Castiel, a heart like his, belonging to him. It shook Dean to his very core, and he fell to his knees at Castiel’s bedside and took the alpha’s hands in his own as wetness clouded his vision and he was so overcome with want and love and hope that he could scarcely breathe.
Soon enough, in regards to a house party, a plan began to form, and Castiel agreed to play the first quadrille of the evening. Even Charlie confessed to being able to play some “old tunes” passably well for the second half of the night.
The omega blushed, “My Charlie,” she hummed with a delighted smile, “only must be her clever, joyful self, for she has already won my favor.”
“I merely count things and prepare the inventories for—well, I used to do it for Vice Chancellor Lucifer, and at the current moment, I am helping my aunt to prepare a particular report for the Prince Regent.”
“It’s a black, late model sedan,” Cas narrated. “From here it looks like the plate matches your UFO.”
Having gifted his earnings to Dr. Franklin, Castiel had no means of buying his passage, so in Kingstown, he took to gambling. He began with the meager currency of his silver and mother-of-pearl waistcoat buttons, which he removed himself, replacing them with simple shell buttons he picked up for a penny in the market. At that point, he attempted to post letters to Winchester, but it came down to choosing to give his scant coins to the Royal Mail or keeping them to feed himself. He kept the letters in his breast pocket.
That Sunday, Dean asked Ellen to prepare a cold lunch for him to take into the town, and Castiel loaded one of the wagons with the food and drinks, as well as the people who wanted to go along. He drove Dean, Ellen, Gabriel, Balthazar, the stable boys, Kevin, Claire, and two of the puppies into town. Charlie and Patience had taken their phaeton in earlier that day to help Missouri arrange her new home.
“I think she’s fine,” Dean murmured fondly, scratching her neck. “Thank you, Mick. It was kind of you to send the lineament.”
At that moment, a loud bang sounded in the street, and a moment later a breathless young woman entered the shop, causing the cheerful bell above the door to tinkle. Even the bell was elegantly made from delicate glass.
After taking care of business, Dean paused at the sink to toss water onto his face. In the mirror he could see that his eye was half swollen.
Chuck looked aghast. “Pay me? What would they pay me? They work for food to feed their little ones, just as my own mate does in the fields. I keep the pups because someone must, after Claire’s baby died from a bad burn because there was no one to leech her.”
“Oh, Dean, you should have seen the crowd of angels in the basilica when you sang a gloria for the old priest.” Castiel was obviously lost in his own memory and a deep scowl overtook his features, his blue eyes clouding. “I had to chase them away from you.”
They, however, did nothing to stop Castiel from throwing a brutal punch with his right. Dean was blindsided and unbalanced, despite Castiel's handicap, and he raised his hands in a gesture of surrender while exclaiming, "What the fuck?"
At first Sam said nothing, his eyes locked on the way Dean’s hand was wrapped around Castiel’s, holding on tight. But when Eileen took Sam’s hand in the same manner and jiggled his fist to make him look up into her eyes, Sam relented.
Mankind is God's favored creation, and he is not meant to be treated roughly by an abomination. Then Castiel bites his lip at his thought. It has recently become treason to consider God at all.
When the weather began to cool, Dean surveyed maps to determine the best means for fueling the town with coal through the winter. There was bound to be a supply-train burden whether they received coal from the mines in the west or from the city in the east. The delivery that the town received already, to fuel its fires and its water engine, was costly. He didn’t know if, given the fact that the new town was still just getting off its feet, Winchester would be able to afford the extra coal that winter would require. Dean was discussing the prospects over a map with Charlie and Jessica one morning when a lone rider appeared in the yard. The gentleman’s top hat declared that he was not the express rider, so the trio carried on with their tea and conversation until Ketch showed the gentleman visitor in.
So Dean found himself relegated to lying in the spring grass and feeling sorry for himself. He had spent the morning with the ladies and the puppies in the garden, delighting them with teaching the rapidly growing little dogs simple tricks. They laughed and marveled at his ability to charm the pups, but he knew they truly preferred their own company to his, so after lunch he had gone off alone to stay out of everyone’s way.
. Dean gagged, and thank God they had pulled up at his place, and the cop had remembered the gate code because it meant Dean could open the car door and upchuck into the grass.
Castiel’s expression was not far off from what little Sam’s must have been that day as he listened to Dean’s tale. The room, by then, was suffuse with the early spring sunset, casting golden halos around the room. Neither man could remember passing a better day within the confines of a single room in their lives.
He hummed and slurped and gagged and swallowed, and Cas held on for Dear life. When he tried to get Dean’s cock in hand afterward, Dean laughed at him. “Quit your fumbling, you gimp.”
Everyone was glad to see he was well, thrilled to hear he would be a father (news which prompted some of them to hug Jessica, suddenly one of their own), and grateful to him when he directed them to follow Kevin and Kaia to the north wing of the castle where their meager rooms were waiting. Growing crowded, the north wing housed the former residents of the stables, a few of whom had pitched in on construction for doorframes and doors on the old rooms. Others sewed modest window coverings or in other ways helped to make the previously abandoned rooms of the castle habitable.
At a traffic intersection, Dean paused for a few cars to pass, and just for a moment, he thought he saw a man in a pinstripe fedora over his shoulder, but when he looked back, nothing was there but a lamppost and a garbage bin with a newspaper flapping desperately on top of it. It must have been the flutter of the paper that caught his attention.
The mirth dropped instantly from Dean's face. "I know," he said. "It's my city, too. They were my family."
The undertaker’s house was at the edge of town, so it made Dean’s first stop convenient. Plus it saved him the inevitable awkward stares that would accompany hauling a body through town.
Dean sighed and slapped Castiel’s hands away before pulling the tabletop back down over the tub. He patted it with one hand in invitation for Castiel to sit there. “You, sit. Take off those boots while the water is heating. I’ll let you look at my hideous belly all you want once you’re in the water.”
“Oh this is quite thrilling,” one of the ladies murmured in anticipation as Charlie retrieved an item from the corner of the room that was twice the size of a breadbox.
Dean took her point and drained his coffee cup as he scrolled through his texts. Still nothing from Sam.
Castiel remained silent, seeing there was no reasonable conclusion to such an argument. Instead, he picked at the sand under his thumbnail until the fish course arrived. Then Castiel picked at that, too. He was eager for the vegetable course that was sure to be served next. He had eaten nothing but fish for so long that he barely remembered what vegetables tasted like.
He had never considered twenty-eight to be old, and much of the time, Dean thought of himself as a young man. But when he watched the kids dancing and realized he was more than a decade older than them, and the polka he had danced with Rhonda Hurley at his first dance was tame compared to the way the kids danced now, well Dean watched, bemused, and figured he ought to recalibrate is perspective on himself. He was a grown man, not getting any younger. The back of his neck began to tickle as he watched the kids, and Dean turned his backside to the stove for warmth so he could scan the room.
Dean stood in confusion looking at the little trays. The man pressed a sliver of something into Dean’s hand, and the scent of vanilla bloomed in the humid, ammonia-riddled miasma of the room.
Not wanting to alert all the guests to the incident that would surely be a household scandal and would possibly frighten the ladies, Dean calmed himself outside the French window before slipping back inside. Nevertheless, the high color in his face attracted Castiel’s immediate attention, and Dean gestured to the attached parlor in order to talk to the alpha alone.
“Oh right,” Gabriel murmured, not at all concerned about a mere mortal cutting in on the conversation. “You might be glad to know that Crowley, the old demon-magnet, is still cozy in his cell and the convergence of demonic energy of his former minions who want to kill him and takeover his place as the King of the Crossroads is also attracting convergence of exiles who are picking the demons off by the dozens and sapping that loose demonic energy before it can do Crowley any good. He’s getting weaker and might actually serve out his 80-year sentence at this rate.”
Dean longed to stay and watch over Castiel as he slept, hold his hand through the pain, and comfort him through what was sure to be an uncomfortable night, but he knew it was impossible for an unmated omega to spend the night unchaperoned with an alpha. So Dean retreated to his room, his cold bathtub long forgotten, and his weary eyes itching to close.
Castiel had put his sunglasses back on, but Dean could tell he was looking. He brought his tea glass to his lips and sipped without answering. Dean shrugged and did ten more.
Maybe that happiness on her face would be Castiel's to give once more when he got on his knee to propose to the love of his life later tonight.
Jessica leaned forward and Dean placed her hand on his belly, and they smiled at each other when she felt the baby kick against her fingers.
One page was an old broadsheet, disintegrating along the creases where it had been folded and unfolded for years, smudged with greasy thumbprints here and there, and yellowing on the outside quadrant of paper — from exposure to the man’s sweat, Dean imagined. Once unfolded, Dean’s eyes went wide at the small illustrations that decorated the page in between the two columns of type.
Very soon, the bearded surgeon held up a deformed chunk of metal, dripping in red, and showed it to the patient, a burly man, presumably the smith, if his blackened hands were anything to go by.
“Thank you, Ketch.” Dean wrapped a cloth around the silver pieces he had been working on and stood from his bench. As he traversed the corridors, he rubbed at the grease on his fingers with his handkerchief and then ran a hand through his hair self-consciously.
Castiel was a work of art, from his blue eyes clouded and focused with lust to the muscles of his abdomen highlighted in sweat. Dean dug his heels into his alpha’s ass and spurred him forward, deeper, harder.
Castiel stepped out of his slacks, and Dean forgot his second point altogether. The guy wore navy blue briefs, and not only did he have an ass you could bounce a quarter off, his thighs looked like fiberglass models of what thighs were meant to look like. But his claves… those were unreal, thick and round and cut from burnished marble. When Castiel stepped into his jeans, Dean nearly complained aloud about it.
Castiel fucked into his mate fiercely, finding the spot within that made Dean howl and then slamming into it over and over. No one had ever touched Dean there, but now his alpha drove so deeply, so relentlessly within that he sent the omega into a state of madness so acute he understood nothing but his mate and his pleasure. He reached down between his own legs, where his soon-to-be-husband disappeared inside him and brought his fingers back glistening wet. Castiel pulled them up to his own face and sucked them clean.
The silence in the car was oppressive through Lampasas and half way to Comanche. They’d stopped in Goldthwaite for fuel and more coffee. Dean popped the license plate down on his ’67 Chevy Impala to fill the tank, and he almost drenched his shoes in gas because Cas stood right there behind the car with his hands on his narrow hips and his hair fucked up from driving 80 with the windows down. Jesus, the man was distracting to look at. Too bad he was so quiet, but Dean tried not to press because the guy had just lost his dog and dredged up a boatload of old family memories in that story he’d told.
“It’s Sam,” Dean’s brother sighed, taking Eileen by the arm and petting his baby moustache as they crossed over to the shady side of the street.
“Charlie let them burn down a little so their light would spoil her show,” Dean replied, his voice monotone, and his manner subdued.
The betrothed walked arm in arm into the southern pasture where the horses still lingered, unhurried about trekking back to the stables for the night.
“I was told to call for him at the castle there, but the boy at the castle said to look for him here, instead.”
“Your man is not dead, Dean Winchester,” Dr. Franklin insisted. “Did you forget that I am a doctor?”
He hadn't expected to see Dean's classic '67 Chevy parked on his street, and he was especially surprised when he entered the back gate that led to his carriage house because Dean Winchester himself lounged by his pool with a little hibachi grill set up beside him with roasting onions wafting a mouth watering aroma into the air.
Balthazar told Castiel about the burning of Glassblowers Street and the relocation of many of its former tenants to Winchester.
Some time between midday and evening, a wagon pulled up to the barrier created by the brazier and half a dozen or eight large dark-skinned men disembarked. Most newcomers to Winchester were from Glassblowers Street or known by someone already in Winchester, so the sight of strangers quieted the boisterousness of the tavern as all eyes turned toward the window.
Out on the street, Castiel watched Dean stow his stuff in his Impala's massive trunk while the streetlights flickered to life. "So, what's next on the agenda?" Dean asked.
Dean found the loud music annoying at this point, though his companion did not speak. The table the man had chosen put Dean’s good ear toward the room, and if the man did start talking Dean would have to face the wall just to hear him.
In reality, Castiel was beside himself with frustration over his desire for Dean. The only way he kept himself from grabbing the omega and ravishing him ten times a day was to exhaust his body with long runs into town and back, long swims in the little lake, and constant romps with the puppies, with the horses, and even with Sam.
Touching his new brooch, Castiel leaned over to kiss his husband before snatching the cravat pin from his hand and pulling Dean’s own new superfine summer wool frocked coat off the heap of clothing on the floor. “I could never forget you, my love,” he smiled serenely as he pinned his sapphire on the breast of Dean’s coat, over where he hoped his husband’s heart would rest once he put the garment back on.
Dean drank the water and remembered, too, to take a breath, and he closed his eyes and enjoyed the utter quiet of the room, the stillness. Then he heard the cop, Novak, shifting around, and he looked up to see him removing his trench coat, and it pulled his suit jacket a little off his shoulder, and there was a soft brown leather holster looking hot as fuck. It was like the guy had a laundry list of Dean’s weaknesses and ticked them off one by one. He pulled up a chair to face Dean.
“Nonsense, Lady Charlie,” Lord Milton broke in with Lord Balthazar smiling over his shoulder. “I have a five pound banknote right here,” he reached into his breast pocket and began unfolding the paper money.
Sam's ears perk up. He's heard the whole story with a lot more background than even Dean had been privy to. The tale spilled over with intrigue and politics and probable shady dealings between Michael and Hell. The inconsequential demon in the mix, a crossroads demon named Crowley, was obviously making a power grab by playing heavenly delivery boy with Michael's Sword.
Jessica is the very embodiment of generosity,” he said. “Just look at how kindly she treats my brother.”
“But, I think to myself that the customs man, the coast guard, and the port authority will not simply allow a ship to sail across that blue, blue water. But then I see there is a second page within that letter. He has drawn this map there,” Dr. Franklin points to the tabletop, “and the paper says what time and what place we men were to go. It tells how to fix that cannon so it cannot fire, how to hobble the schooners that chase smugglers’ ships, how to pass the dock man while the soldiers happen to be distracted with chasing the little boys in Road Town who torment their horses, and then, to keep himself from being arrested, it also tells how the men must fight against the soldiers who are not chasing the little boys.” Dr. Franklin nods. “It says how I, personally, must take Colonel Milton’s bayonet and run him through.”
Everyone was glad, of course, but Sam wanted to know if Dean was all right. He was about to ask when Dr. Franklin came down the stairs, his eyes as bright and cheerful as ever.
The town’s citizens benefitted, too, from the clean water in every courtyard and the paving stones along the high street and the sparkling glass panes upon the windows that kept the cold outside. Fortunate as they were, they welcomed the newcomers warmly.
Jessica giggled and dragged Dean closer to the wall. Beneath the wainscoting, recessed iron pulls, which Dean had always mistaken for decoration, opened deep drawers revealing maps of the Winchester estate going back centuries. When the first drawer failed to provide whatever Jess was looking for, she dragged Dean a yard further down the gallery and pulled another handle. Thus they spent the better part of half an hour, at times becoming distracted by the documents they discovered, until they found the item Jess was searching for.
Dean blinked. He had known Missouri a long time, ever since his family moved to Glassblowers Street, but he didn’t remember anyone named James. However, the framed portraits on the wall behind the new man caused things to fall into place.
After a moment of deep breaths and a tight grip on the wheel, Dean replied. “That might be pretty keen, Cas.”
“Well then,” Charlie said as though reading Castiel’s mind and daring him to follow through, “it is time you post the banns.”
When they came across the normally solitary vicar speaking to a heavily pregnant man surrounded by small children in the only outlying cottage on this side of the lake, they stopped to greet him, and Dean handed a bright penny to each child before pulling a walnut, of all things from his pocket. The vicar, having evidently concluded his chat with the lightly bearded omega, tipped his hat and set out toward the town while Dean introduced Castiel to the young father. “This is Chuck. He’s the closest thing the town has to a school master.”
Later, he would blame a flick of his own wrist lighting up the face of his watch for what happened next: before he could even see the enemy in the front yard, a shot rang out and struck Cas in the left arm. He cursed and peered into the darkness and took a shot of his own at the first movement he saw by the car. A voice cried out, and then Cas saw Dean, and for a moment he thought he had done the unthinkable and shot his lover.
Dean reached out to the glass and noted it was hot to the touch. Charlie sighed and waded back in to retrieve her waterwheel and set it on the trestle table while she laced her boots back on. Dean bent to inspect it and noticed the core of the wheel was solid copper. He hefted it and was surprised at its weight. To make a bigger wheel that would support more lighting would potentially get very heavy and be impossible to mount or to turn without a raging river.
“Dean,” Castiel murmured, rising from his desk to walk around it and take his omega’s hand to kiss it fondly. “I haven’t seen you today,” the alpha stated.
“Like what?” Dean prompted, suspicious that Cas might suggest something stupid like being able to breathe.
“Maybe we should,” Dean suggested. “I’ve never been much of anywhere. First time I left the mountain was when I found Crowley’s discarded meatsuit and took off for New Orleans.”
Bobby’s Singer’s compound, for want of a better term, however, was a wreck. There were as many bottles of whiskey in there as he had seen in back stage at Winchester’s show. The residence at the salvage yard was above the garage bays, and the number one witness was a mechanic who worked there. He had seen Sam Winchester pulling into the compound after closing hours the on the evening of the murder. Nothing unusual about that, since the Winchesters were Singer’s only family, but since that was the last activity on the scene before the 911 call came in, Sam needed to answer quite a few questions.
Dean, not having read any letters from his husband, felt his gut burn hot with jealousy at hearing that Crowley had letters from Castiel. He had to tell his ridiculous emotions to calm down. Castiel and Crowley were in business together; of course they were in correspondence. When Dean did not answer him or move to inspect the purse, Crowley noticed the work spread out upon the table and deduced that they had been discussing coal sources and supply options. He seamlessly transitioned into a conversation with Lady Charlie and Princess Jessica about a coal supplier that used the river towpath through the southern counties.
“Oh, Castiel.” Dean was the one who lifted his palm then to rest against his true mate’s cheek. “Oh, how could I not?”
Dean chose to ignore the leer and greeted them as Sam would do. “Welcome to Winchester. Can I offer you refreshment? It appears as though your horses are helping themselves,” he gestured to the destriers that were sucking noisily at the trough while Mick patiently held their reins.
Gabriel rose from his seat and went to the street to summon one of the boys loitering by the cheese monger’s shop. He selected a ha'penny from his pocket and held it high as he spoke with the lad. After having the boy repeat his instructions back to him, Gabriel handed the coin over with a promise, “I’ll give you a shilling when you return if you get everything right and thriftily.” The boy’s eyes went wide as his mouth went slack before he took the coin and ran off to complete his mission.
Rowena spoke up to show that she was of a similar mind. “Have you come to the estate to reclaim your place, Your Grace? You know we would all support you.”
“But I got you off track,” Jessica said. “You wanted to speak with me about something else, I think.”
“Good morning, Colonel,” he said brightly, leaving the door open widely for propriety’s sake. The man on the bed growled a bit, and Dean could see that his eyes were deeply shadowed and his brow drawn in pain. “Rough night?”
Ellen threw her head back and laughed at Dean’s genuine distress. “One thing I can say for your upbringing, lad, you’re decent, through and through.” She tilted her head and regarded him. “How old are you, Dean?”
“Eh, you know my concept of time on earth is fuzzy these days. Lucy gets bored easily. My guess is that he’ll find a new vessel, for which the shelf life will be predictably short unless he takes the time to find a good match.” Gabriel scratched his chin thoughtfully. “Before the seasons here turn twice, he’ll be so far away and so deep into some new shit that he won’t be thinking about you.”
Castiel watched as his mate’s face went from trusting and open to firmly shuttered. Dean said nothing more.
When they returned to the table, they found Sam had ordered a Family Feast for three, upon the waiter’s suggestion. Dean said that sounded fine, and Eileen picked up the menu to read more about it. Dean had never wanted a cold beer more in his life.
He ducked his head to catch the ring before it dropped to the dusty floorboards, so he wasn’t looking when the sound of wings whispered past the window. He fisted the ring and quickly glanced outside, wondering what fool bird would be flying in this fog, before snagging on the crease on Meg’s brow.
The colonel stopped in the foyer to don his hat and pick up his stick while Dean pulled himself into his coat. Dean was unaccustomed to wearing a hat, as he had never been able to afford one, so he went out bareheaded. If the spring sun on his face brought out his freckles, he was not so vain as to worry about it.
When they shared a supper with Sir Rafael in the tavern, Dean tormented them by asking, “What if it’s an exceptional growing season, and we cannot bring in all the harvest because the peas are just too heavy? Or what if the carrots are so large that when we pull them up, they take days to pull because their roots go all the way to India?”
"You've seen his cock?" The last word was uttered in a whisper. "Cassie, is it pierced? Is it tattooed?"
Their transaction done, Dean went back to the cramped little hallway where he had left Eileen and nearly bumped into her as she withdrew from the Ladies’ Lounge at nearly the same moment, looking refreshed with powdered cheeks and neatly pinned braids.
Dean nodded, suddenly unable to speak, and Castiel waited on him. Flocks of sparrows that nested in the cattails on the lake flew in like clouds of swarming bees to light upon their tiny beds for the night. The din of chirping distracted the men momentarily and afforded Dean a chance to think. He knew he was being asked a question, but he was uncertain--
"Don't," Dean snaps then looks up. Bobby sits a room away at his old desk. "I'm not talking about that, Cas. Not now, not ever."
It was more than a month before another such letter came, but this time the paper was thicker and tied with a hemp string beneath its seal, indicating it was actually more than one letter delivered in tandem.
He moves to exit by the door behind Castiel and passes off the handle of the leash to Castiel on his way past. "Take care of this thing, soldier," he says, and then he is gone.
“What news of the hunt, your grace?” he began, hoping that by redirecting the duke’s focus, he could calm Sam down and make him forget to be annoyed with his brother. Dean, meanwhile, was clearly set to be annoyed with Sam until an apology was produced, but Castiel had no power over that.
Throwing his head back to laugh in delighted relief, Castiel let his hands drop to his sides. “The birthday party!” He stood awkwardly a moment, just smiling, and Kaia stayed frozen in place the entire time, smiling awkwardly, too, before Castiel shook himself out of his wonder.
Dean collected his brother, sister-in-law, and, rather quickly, a tail in a striped Fedora as they made their way up the boulevard back toward the Winchesters’ little rental cottage. Sam started to look back, sensing something, but Dean hissed, “Don’t look. I’ve got him.”
So it was decided that each person would exchange a story with Castiel for one about his time abroad.
After a night of leeches and herbs on his eyelid to stem the swelling and staunch the blood, Castiel was feeling none too chipper in the morning.
“Did you hear him, my darling?” Sam asked, aside to Jessica. “It is ‘Your Grace’ already!” Sam’s eyes danced with excitement at hearing his new title.
For his part, Dean only crowded in closer and slid his hand around Castiel's back, and he lost track of time in Castiel's mouth.
Castiel merely squeezed Dean’s hand and suggested the soldiers follow them inside for the refreshment they had been offered.
The group was on the move, heading in a swirl toward the open doors of the castle. There was a pause in the commotion as the household staff presented themselves to their master and mistress, and then the trunks and packages were handed down to the footmen and dragged up the back stars. French wine was popped open and glasses were handed round while everyone talked loudly, each of the party barely hearing himself over the din of the others.
Pausing with the water bottle at his lips, Dean looked up at the cop. His eyes were blue. Like, so blue.
One of the men, who had been watching Dean and Dr. Franklin, turned sharply at hearing his name, and in the same moment, he vaulted down from the wagon and fell to his knees in front of Missouri.
Bobby had brought along all of the past month’s broadsheets from the city, which Balthazar, Gabriel, Castiel, and Dean read and discussed throughout the sunny afternoon. When the politics made Dean anxious, he busied himself with the puppies, old enough to start learning to obey commands. He had brought them to keep Benny and Missouri company, but also to watch out for them. Considering that much of the town was still vacant, they had no neighbors to watch their backs, and Dean was still shaken by the events of Brady’s prowling and the vague murmurings of footpads in the area. The puppies weren’t good for much other than barking and eating scraps, but that would be better than nothing.
The sheriff herself was roused from her night off with her family to listen to the story and tell the deputies how to handle it. In the end, Luc and Mike and Cas were put in cells for the night because Luc insisted on pressing charges against Cas for the purpling nose that deformed his face. They couldn’t get the judge until the next day, no matter how much Dean tried to impress the sheriff with his shiny APD badge and detective business cards.
The traveling party was jolly along the road, but Charlie was tired from riding by the time they reached a livery that would take in their horses in the capital, and she vowed to buy a speedy but comfortable rig for the journey back out to the country.
Dean allowed himself a brief, languid respite, lying chest to chest on his lover, before pulling up and taking care of the condom, sloppily. When Dean got back to the bed, Cas was on his back looking up at him with a beautiful smile on his face. Dean mirrored the smile, “You like it rough and dirty, Cas.”
The tune was simple and low in a minor key. The words were place fillers, mostly. They always were at this point. His stomach growled as he rinsed it off, and Dean hit the taps off. He toweled his head and shoulders before wrapping it around his waist and stomping wetly onto the fuzzy moss rug.
Dean looked up in interest at his alpha’s name and took the slender glass of water clouded with two drops of the laudanum.
Castiel wondered what other lurid nonsense Jesse wiped his bottom with, but he had learned all he needed for the moment and bowed out of that conversation.
Dean had lost his greatcoat along the way, having wrapped it around a wounded man on the journey, and his shoulder was locked up from the cold and the strain of holding the heavy hunting rifle up all night. As he had predicted, the gun had not been required. Using his torch to light the road at night had kept anyone from approaching them, and the annotations in his little notebook about the number of hours the light bulb had yet burned gave Charlie a bit of hope amidst the darkness they had witnessed.
mate. As such, I expect you to come back to me whole and alive once you have played the regent’s foolish game.”
So were the others, who were hesitant to approach the fine ladies, whom Dean could tell were not dressed in their usual finery but in their simplest frocks, but the newcomers greeted Sam, dressed today in an old coat without a hint of lace anywhere, with smiles, hugs, and pats on the shoulder like he was the prodigal son.
Bobby and Dean both look on as Castiel regards his destroyed clothes. A thousand tiny tears riddle his ugly trench coat and suit jacket. Dean considers this might be a blessing, as they can get the angel into some normal clothes. Bobby, on the other hand, is dazed at the fact that the guy he just blew a few thousand holes through is still standing on his porch.
As luck would have it, Dean was outside when Charlie drove up to the castle. When she was still too far away to hear anything other than his shrill whistle and make out the slow arc of his wave, Lady Charlie could not stop her smile. Soon, she could see that Dean was pretending to play with the puppies that were flocked around the princesses and the duchess on a blanket on the grass, but it was obvious that all of the omegas were actually entranced watching Castiel and Sam fencing shirtless in the late sun.
Dean was the first to comply, and he said, “Cas, get down.” Cas copied Dean’s posture with his hands on his head and the stones digging into his naked knees.
Dean watched Castiel take the bundle stiffly. “Is it your officer’s coat?” he asked his husband-to-be. “Are you wearing your uniform for the wedding?” Dean had envisioned Castiel at their wedding in his blue tailcoat, but if his alpha wanted to wear red, well, the colonel would surely be dashing in his uniform.
“The fact that we can’t find him is causing me to focus on him, so if there is anything you can tell me about where Sam is, it would really help things.”
“Well, good luck, you two. Don’t go breaking any laws that actually count,” Gabriel shot finger-guns at them, and Castiel nodded once, in understanding or as a promise, Dean did not know.
. The bruise would last a while. At the moment it was deeply red and starting to purple a bit. Otherwise, he was pale as a sheet of paper. From behind him in the mirror, he saw a portrait of
“I shall become very busy on the estate,” Castiel mused. “The town easily has enough residents now that we can sow all the fields north of the river road this year.”
"You are my Father's greatest creation, and your soul burns so brightly, so beautifully. You are a joy to behold, Dean."
“I assure you our relations have remained entirely chaste,” Castiel cut in, although his face heated a little as he recalled pressing Dean against the wallpaper at Crowley’s.
Dean made his move quickly, noiselessly skittering across the hall to the back staircase. He descended a few steps, enough that only his eyes peered above the top step. His own breathing sounded loud alongside the thumping of his heart in his ears when Brady crept closer. Dean intended to wait for him to pass by the staircase, and then he would follow the fiend to his destination.
Castiel disappeared into his office with his old friends, the dragoons, and Dean returned to his workshop to finish the wedding gift he was making for Castiel. Dean was no silversmith, but he had his little crucible and a great deal of patience and determination. Over the years, both Bobby and Benny had taught him a thing or two about metal work, and it had served him well in fashioning his little clockwork creations. This gift was simple in its mechanism but delicate in its design; he hoped Castiel would like it.
She began to turn to leave when Dean stopped her again by asking, “One other thing. The colonel won’t say so, but he has been in quite a bit of pain from the circumstance, and I wonder if you keep opium on hand?”
Dean grimaced wryly, “I do hope I never meet her, or I will be sorely tempted to scratch her eyes out.”
Meanwhile, Castiel bathed and prepared himself to meet with and dine with his brothers when they arrived. He was eager to find out if the Prince Regent had agreed to his request to delay his departure to the West Indies until he could establish his household with his husband. When he had tentatively broached the idea of delaying the wedding awhile, Dean had shut that talk down swiftly and decisively. He hadn’t even gotten round to mentioning his idea was delay it two years, until his return from service, which Dean certainly knew nothing about yet.
"Fine," he relented and shrugged his coat off. It really had warmed up over the course of the day, but he was so used to wearing the trench coat that it rarely occurred to him to take it off unless he was home. Well, he was home. And there was Dean Winchester in black jeans and a gray tee-shirt with a charming grin despite the trauma of the past twenty hours, the lack of sleep, and the worry he must be carrying. Cas reminded himself that Dean is a performer, after all, and he unknotted his tie with his shoulders squared. He would not be played by this man.
Castiel stood abruptly. “I must go. I thank you for the tea,” he bowed to the cook, “and I thank you humbly for the ride,” he bowed very low to Rufus, “but as you must return home before nightfall and you do not have time to drive me further, I really must take my leave of you now.”
On the evening of the fourth day, after a good scrub in his tub, Dean felt in control enough of his senses once more to allow himself out of his room, despite Kevin and Ellen urging him to wait for the next morning, at least. He set his jaw, squared his shoulders and did not walk straight to Castiel’s door. He knew that the alpha would still be able to scent the heat on him as if he had rolled in rose bushes, so he headed out of doors instead to stretch his legs and shake off some restless energy.
It’s true that Dean Winchester seemed guileless but that didn’t wash. He was a performer by trade, so he had to have some larceny running through his veins, just to deal with the shit fame must have thrown at him on a daily basis. Still, he had been entirely upfront since the very beginning, and he had handled himself well through a rough ten or twelve hours that no one should ever have to go through. But why was Cas’ gut rooting for this headstrong rockstar who thinks with his dick, fucks groupies backstage, and would flirt with a fencepost if it had a face? Cas had been in observation mode since the investigation started, and he had noticed quite a lot about Dean Winchester.
Inside the kitchen doors, Dean paused long enough to draw a cup of cool water from the sink pump and quench his thirst. With a deep breath he continued his path into Ellen’s domain to steal a scone and whatever meat was turning the air to ambrosia. Before bursting into the hearth, though, he calmed himself; having been taught his lesson by Mick already, he didn’t need to hear it from Ellen, as well.
Eileen gestured wildly while talking about how fast and exciting it was, her words jumbling together in her enthusiasm. Sam smiled down at her as she talked and laughed, and that tightness clutched Dean’s heart again.
When Bobby's door flies open, Dean and the angel are nearly nose to nose on the stoop, staring each other down like bitter rivals.
“And the fact that there is no proof of the origins of the treasure, other than a hundred year old hearsay—I mean even the Revenuers at the time weren’t able to pin anything down—means my statute of limitations worry is moot.”
“Benny, I need to borrow your little hibachi and pick up some beers. Can we head to your place?” In addition to playing bass in Dean’s band, Benny owned a craft brewery.
“No matter how you couch that, Sammy, the regent will hear you speaking directly against him.” Dean warned. “You’ll be declaring yourself a Whig.”
Dean shrugged one shoulder. “Apache, I guess. Coroner said it was Indians, anyway. Ten years ago, now. I took Sammy out to catch fish on the river one day, and when we got home Ma was burnt up and Pa had his guts half tore out. I went for the doctor, leaving Sammy to keep Pa still and keep towels on the wounds. Day later, Doc sewed him up, left me a bottle of morphine to feed him till he died, and hightailed it back to town. Sammy couldn’t look at Pa’s pale face and seeping wounds any more, so every morning, I sent him out to dig a hole by the blue spruce. Next day I sent him out to dig it deeper. Next day, deeper still. By the time the hole was deep enough, Pa was dead enough.”
If Castiel briefly mused over why the young princess had been riding her Arabian in Lord Crowley’s direction and whether she was bored enough and husband-hungry enough to settle on Crowley, well he did not voice these ideas nor even entertain them for more than the briefest moment.
...but Dean's soul burns so brightly, brighter even than many angels' grace. If Michael were to wield the sword, that soul would cease to glow, and such a loss would be an abomination to God.
Castiel shook his head. “I don’t mind being shot, and I don’t mind hacking a man’s limbs apart in battle, but I am a coward when it comes to hurting Dean. When I received the news from the Regent, I told Dean half of it: that the crown will allow us to marry with your consent.” He looked at Sam with eyes the color of the vast oceans he must cross for his omega, “But I could not tell him we must wait two years to marry.”
Castiel is impressed by the human's bravado. To order around a being that could smite him with a breath is terrific. To actually expect Castiel to obey the order is hubris.
“Ain’t that the right word? Sometimes my da’ brings a newspaper from the capital, and it’s always got an exciting story about escaping lunatic alphas murdering poor omegas in their beds.”
The butler bowed stiffly and retreated with a, “Right away, Colonel,” and Dean just knew Ketch would piss in his pillowcase if he could.
As the villain reached around to grab at Dean’s backside once again, Dean took a swing at him. Unfortunately, fettered by his tight layers of superfine wool, his fist only grazed the man’s chin, and Dean was disappointed he could not leave a bruise. By the subsequent moment, the smarmy alpha had his arms wrapped around Dean’s squirming torso and both hands kneading at Dean’s buttocks while his wet mouth left disgusting trails along Dean’s sideburns, since his high collar prevented the beast access to his neck.
Gabriel smiled, “Well, that’s astounding really. That could make you Cassie’s de-facto uncle, and to hear Dean tell it, you’re like a father to him, so you can choose which side of the table you want to sit at for the wedding luncheon!” Gabriel laughed at his own joke and didn’t really notice that Bobby wasn’t laughing, too.
"Sorry I wasn't here. But I got the paperwork from the funeral home, and I'm working on the funeral."
“Colonel,” both men said in unison, snapping to attention and losing the joviality of their expressions.
Suddenly the feather was no longer in segments. It was one solid, beautiful, shimmering length, as long as Dean’s arm from shoulder to wrist. He reached for it as Pamela swept the old bits of leaf into the fireplace and sprinkled Holy water on her tea tray for protection.
“Don’t pin this on me, Colonel Milton. I have only asked one thing of you, ever, and it was not for you to bend to the regent’s bidding!”
Dean smiled and leaned forward to rest his brow against Castiel’s shoulder, content to be in his lover’s orbit and sure of his feelings.
Before he could produce a figure for Dean, however, Lady Charlie and then Sir Rafael arrived for dinner. A moment later, Ketch opened the doors to the dining room so that everyone could sit and be served.
The SUV rumbled up the quiet lane of West Lynn and rolled to a stop outside a three story stone house.
“I’m not sleeping in the wet spot, you heathen.” Cas reached for the lamp with his bum arm and hissed. Dean leaned up on his elbow to reach the light and turn it off.
Absently lifting another piece of meat to his lips, Dean’s tongue poked out as his eyes scanned the text on the page. He wasn’t a fast reader by any stretch, but Mary Winchester had spent many long nights with her sons sat on top of thick boxes at their old trestle table to make them tall enough to see the Bible, and while the work of reading had come easy to Sammy, Dean had learned by sheer force of will. Once earned, however, reading was a gift he held to his heart; many a long, lonely winter’s night in his cabin had passed in the company of characters from his favorite detective stories.
Dean picked up the thread, “And one visit, a little one will stow away on our boat, and we’ll take him to see the mummies in Egypt and the kangaroos in Australia, and all his brothers and sisters will be jealous.”
The handsome man was back at the same little table he had sat at before. No cup of coffee sat with him this time. He merely sat still, watching Dean, and making no bones about it.
“I know you’re here, omega. I can smell you and the alpha.” Brady said. “Does Castiel know you’re whoring yourself around the castle? I believe it’s my turn to feel you on my knot.”
Dean ducked back inside his own doorway to watch the interloper’s shadow make a hand motion at about hip-height. From the turning of the shadow’s wrist and the sound of a mechanical click, Dean knew that Brady had turned a key in Castiel’s lock. Was he letting him into Castiel’s room?
He heard footsteps above his head and looked around the room a bit more. There was a cupboard with soap flakes and tooth powder and all manner of household items he did not recognize. He briefly opened a small casement window at the end of the room and stuck his head outside, which he discovered was not outside at all, actually, but a little semi-attached outhouse fitted with a painted commode seat!
“What makes you think he’s ‘missing,’ Dean?” Castiel make airquotes with his fingers, and his eyes met Dean’s and just stuck for a few beats longer than was strictly reasonable.
which sounded delightful, but the scent of it was strong. Dean didn’t want to show up to the card game smelling like a middle-aged lady. There was also a
Charlie made an O with her mouth and then was distracted when the dingy sign for Glassblowers Street came into view. Gabriel rolled his eyes when his friend’s pace increased, but he followed her without comment.
When Dean accidently brushed his boot against the man’s outstretched foot beneath the table, he could have sworn he felt a warm tickle along the line of his chest where the feather was nestled under his vest. Up close the man’s eyes were as vibrant blue as the sky after a storm. Clear and shining. Hungry.
Dean sighed and straightened himself up. He knew when he was being schooled; he’d had enough of this sort of lesson in manners and tact and other such tedium from Bobby. The
With an eyebrow raised, she leaned in, “You been rode hard and put away unsatisfied. I can see it all over you.”
Dean felt the slick begin to dampen between his legs and ran a frustrated hand down his face. He had to keep himself together.
Castiel handed off his bags and dug out his key. When he went inside, Dean stayed at the doorway and handed the bags over. Silla nosed into the bag that held her food until Cas snapped his fingers loudly and she trotted over to her bed by the French doors. Both Dean and the dog looked heartbroken, and Castiel sighed again. “Give me strength,” he mumbled. Then louder, “Stop pouting, both of you. Dean, come in.”
James?” Dean was agog. “Why, Missouri, you said he went into the army after… after your—It was your husband in the colonial wars, so James must have been in the Indian Wars,” Dean surmised. “In Canada?”
Castiel simply smiled and pulled the bell rope. Dean was puzzled, but that turned to shame when Ketch appeared at the doorway. “Ah, Ketch,” Castiel greeted. “Have you, by chance, seen Mister Winchester’s coat around?”
“Patience?” he choked out, covering his eyes until his thumb found the button on the torch that killed the circuit for the mechanism.
Balthazar eventually had to return to his own estates, and he decided to take a bride with him for good measure. Thus Princess Daphne became his wife and lady of his estate as he built steam pumps for villages all over the country. After the diphtheria epidemic, he advertised his Pure Water Engine in the W-C Country Catalog as a sure-fire preventative of the disease and could barely keep up with orders. He employed Gabriel to draft the design plan for each installation, since each village was different, and together they became wealthier than the king, especially when W-C Shipping was able to source the materials from every corner of the realm.
something,” and Dean noticed that Castiel handled it flawlessly while ignoring Dean’s own fumbling and mumbling. Dean grumbled inwardly at all the pretension. Sitting back down to a new course of fine food, Dean noted that every damn part of the meal was pretension.
“Rabbit,” Dean pointed to the rear view mirror where, even if it were angled correctly, Cas would not be able to see a rabbit that narrowly survived the Impala, because there was no rabbit, and it was a lame excuse. Dean cleared his throat and went back to his thoughts. Not about the blue of Cas’ eyes and the adorable crease beside his pink lips.
“They are not natives, though, are they my lord?” Castiel interjected. “They were stolen from their homes and brought here to labor, against their will. No matter if they lived in mud or in palaces before, if you take away a man’s opportunity to create his own life, you kill his soul. Is this not why the stories of zombies and fantastical beasts abound here? Soulless men who have no drive for good because their will has been removed.”
Dean groaned in relief as his back began to relax, “But everybody’s from the city. None of Winchester’s residents knows how to sow or plant or weed or reap.”
Dean stepped backwards, away from Cas a pace, and stared. “You’re fucking breathtaking, Cas. I need a photo of you just like this.”
Castiel coughed and looked away under the scrutiny of Dean’s earnest gaze. “When my father died, he left sundry investments to me as my inheritance. All told, they do not measure up to much any more, as his business dealings were mostly plundered by the crown. But with that income and my wages from managing the Winchester Estate, I have just under a thousand pounds a year, which, though not very much, is sufficient for us to establish a modest household, especially here, out of the city.”
"Oh, indeed I do," Missouri smiled. "I once made a chandelier for a wedding, and every day I was blowing the baubles for it, little Dean came into my shop to watch. He loved the small pieces that danced in the sunlight.
At hearing that, brow furrowed in confused alarm, Dean stepped inside the room, but took care to leave the door open widely. It would not do to give the maids fodder for gossip or for Ketch to jump to conclusions about the goings-on in his house.
The park was exceedingly warm, though, with all the light heating the area, and Dean soon grew uncomfortable lingering there. He moved on, stumbling upon his destination immediately around the next corner.
Cas leaned forward, mirroring Dean’s body and pitch. “I’m having dinner with my daughter at my ex’s house at six,” he replied as he rose from the table and draped his coats over his arm. “Thanks for the tea.”
Soon, Dean was panting and pulling at Castiel’s hair as the alpha dug his fingers into the globes of Dean’s ass and pressed their groins together. A low rhythmic alpha growl vibrated both their chests, reverberating through Dean and lighting his every molecule aflame.
Cold dread washed through Dean’s bones as he realized the truth. Brady was not going for Sam. He was going for Dean. This was not a story of vengeance but one of lust. Dean heard a whispered curse fall from his doorway and knew that Brady had discovered his absence. Dean willed his frozen limbs into action and fled silently down the staircase. His head swam in panic as he tried to think of where to go and what to do. If only he had fled up the stairs instead of down! He could have run to Ellen or… No. What good would another omega be? He should run for Ketch in his little cottage by the stables.
A nearby uniformed officer chimed in, “Apparently the band got in late and made quite a bit of noise as they settled into their rooms. There were seventeen noise complaints last night, according to the manager.”
Both men were hyper aware that the other patrons had left. Dean's hand found Cas's thigh. Castiel set his empty glass back on the bar. He didn't protest or throw up a hand when Dean stepped in closer and hovered near his face. He said nothing when the singer's scent enveloped him and his breath warmed up his neck.
Before turning off to his own room, Castiel paused beside Dean’s door with him and buried his nose against Dean’s neck. “For what it’s worth, Dean?” he maneuvered himself to face his mate, “I think you smell delicious.” And with a saucy half smile that left Dean’s mouth agape, Castiel disappeared behind his own door. Dean grinned as he changed shirts and buttoned his cleanest waistcoat.
Castiel merely nodded and sipped his rusty nail on the rocks. Balthazar made the best ones in the city.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel mumbled, realizing he had been mean. “It’s late and we’re both prickly from exhaustion.”
Seeing Charlie discouraged, Dean began to generate mathematical equations of his own. When Charlie’s phaeton first arrived at the castle, Dean had spent weeks marveling at the swan’s neck springs that suspended the chassis over the carriage’s overlarge wheels. He had drawn them in detail in one of his notebooks, calculating the torque of the springs, the weight they could bear and still bounce.
Castiel examines the heavy gold handle in his hands and follows the chain to its end where it is attached to a collar around the man's neck. He half hears the murmurs around him as angels crowd in to see the man. "It is supposed to be Michael's sword? Where are its wings? Why does it shine?" Castiel, having been to Earth many times in his capacity with the garrison, knows the answers but does not speak them. Instead he watches the man wince when someone's wing reaches out and brushes against his chest.
Pamela Barnes invited him inside to warm himself by her fire as she led Esther around back and had her hired man, Ashley, unburden the mule of its load.
“You’ll do better than that,” she murmured as she added a second cup and saucer to the tray. You’ll change those dressings on the poor man’s feet while you’re there with him.”
“I daresay I was very rude last evening,” Castiel said after greeting Rufus good morning and following him out to help tend the animals.
“Jesus fucking shit,” Dean articulated when his orgasm hit. He spurted onto Castiel’s stomach and then felt Cas claw at the back of his neck as he came next on Dean’s hand. Cas brought their mouths together again and they devoured each other’s passion until they settled there under the skylight in Castiel’s bed and simply held one another in the silence.
Dean scoffed. “I shall ride.” Dean turned on his heel to fetch his boots from his room (Walking barefoot in the grass was a small pleasure Dean indulged in his solitude.), and cast instructions over his shoulder to the footman. “Have Ketch bring the dispatch to me as I saddle Baby.” He knew it would be unthinkable to go into Castiel’s private office and take the dispatch from his desk, so, since Ketch liked excuses to visit his husband in the stables, Dean betted on Ketch’s compliance and thus tacit approval of his plan.
Feeling very dull with his empty glass tapping against his thigh, Dean smiled blandly at the passersby and well wishers, and he tried to learn names when the opportunity arose to do so. It mattered not a fig that he had argued his complete unsuitability at being included in the management of the great household at Winchester castle; Sam insisted he needed an ally in his new position, and one thing about those Winchester brothers was that each always had the other’s back.
The foreign gentleman had turned by this time to Castiel, and Dean could see he held a paper in his hand, which he was still waving wildly as he spoke.
Dean scoffed. “I’m not alright, okay. My father, for all intents and purposes, is dead, and you want to talk to my
Feeling a hot prickle under his eyelids, Dean looked toward the window and willed himself not to shed a tear. It was stupid, he thought to himself, to be upset about this now, in front of a stranger, no less, when it was a truth that had been in place for more than a month already, a probably much longer.
As the music lifted and the mortals below ceased their scurrying, Castiel too raised his voice, incapable of letting the song remain a solo praise to God’s glory. For music, God’s music, it was meant to be shared. It was meant to bring the creatures of God into oneness, one to another. And Dean’s voice rendered so beautifully, no creature could remain unmoved in its echoes.
“Cas—Colonel Milton is very interested in the insights I have managed to gain about the local community.”
Dean would give anything for a cellphone right about now. He doesn't even know what state they're in, let alone what town. He wonders if Sammy stayed in Kansas. How will he find his brother? Well, he knows where Bobby is; Bobby never moves. Maybe it's best to start there.
Dean slapped his old friend on the shoulder and stood with him until chimes of laughter beckoned him to the nearest table.
Jessica dragged a finger over the broad sheaf of canvas upon which the design of a tree was painted with names upon every branch. “Do you know Castiel’s father’s name?”
Once the sun had fully set while they were seated around the edges of the hall with their plates and cups, the room grew very dim, and Princess Jessica called for more candles to be brought in.
“Chuck keeps the ones that are too little to stay at home or who don’t have older siblings to mind them,” Dean explained. “Since the estate currently has no barber surgeon and the littlest ones are wont to injure themselves on the hearths or tools when they’re home alone, Chuck keeps them to save them from hurting themselves.”
Restless still, his back aching too much for him to find comfort in his bed, Dean stole down the corridor to the nursery. As he knew it would be, the fire burned cheerfully in that room as the nursemaid and Princess Jessica fussed over little Lady Victoria Marie. Dean quietly crept inside, sharing a motherly smile with his sister-in-law as he admired his niece.
A litany of whispered swears flitted through the humid air between them, punctuated by the slap slap slap and pant pant pant of two men in the throes of passion.
"All the host of Heaven will be searching for you, Dean." Castiel tilts his head in contemplation and then reaches out to touch Dean's chest.
And so Castiel had stayed: rigid back, broad shoulders, and silent wings, until a new population had begun to refill the room.
“I can imagine the telegrams waiting for us at every port we call to,” Cas mused. “‘Dean. Stop. Bring my child home. Stop. Make sure he brushes teeth. Stop.’”
“Considering he used to live on Glassblowers Street, we won’t hold him accountable for his warped sense of smell, then.”
“You’re going to be challenged one day for your flirting, and I, for one, will not feel a bit sorry for you when you die in a duel like a fool,” Charlie harassed him.
“With our portion of the money we could go anywhere,” Cas hummed, voice low and dozy, the taste of Dean still heavy on his tongue.
“You said that before, weeks ago. That’s why I had globes made to keep air out instead of using the hurricane lamps like I started with,” Charlie was frustrated.
Dean turned away from the mirror, reached into his pocket, and withdrew a silver dollar. This he held, visible to the attendant. “How much is it for an enemy of Mr. Crowley’s?” he asked.
“The draught horses. They’re beautiful and majestic ladies, so kiss them for me before you mount up.”
"Where did you say he lives, Dad?" Claire asked as Castiel navigated along the green-banked Colorado River. They were nearing the country club, and the cars were more expensive here, the houses bigger.
Dean nodded yes each time Dr. Franklin pointed out some geological feature, even though he had no knowledge of the geography whatsoever. A stray bean became a cannon, and a splat of jam became an outpost where the doctor slept and kept his supplies for doctoring the maroons of the island.
Dean's car roared to life with the vital odors of leather and exhaust. He tapped out the rhythm to the tune playing inside his skull as he maneuvered toward Lake Austin and downtown. Heads turned as he rumbled along the boulevard, and occasionally someone recognized his arm resting on the open driver window and shouted his name or his lyrics at him through traffic. Even if it made him feel loved, it didn't erase the hole in his chest left by Bobby's death or this new death that somehow figured into the puzzle, and it didn't ease his mind about what he was going to find at Sam's.
About half way into his beer, Cas finally loosened up enough to ask, “What happened last Friday night, Sam?”
The only waiting Dean could do was to shift his concentration back to Castiel’s throat for the moment, and he latched on and sucked a deep, throbbing bruise.
It was Dean, of course, who got to Sam first and threw his arms around his brother. For his part, Sam squeezed Dean just as tightly and laughed as Dean teased him about the outrageous shrubberies growing along his jawline.
Finally Castiel’s hand shot forth to intercept Dean’s, and when he had the omega’s wrists held tight, he said, “I’m doing this for you, Dean. I am betraying my friends, too. I am betraying my principles, too and I’m doing it—all of it—for
“Before I ask you, though, I must confess my indiscretions.” He cleared his throat and fidgeted, very much unlike the alpha Dean knew and loved. “As a young soldier,” he began before glancing up and back down again, “there are certain traditions—Or, I don’t mean that. I mean I am a weak man, Dean.”
“He is alive, Dean. Do not be sad. Colonel Milton will be home soon,” she whispered to him, ignoring the nursemaid’s presence.
“Oh! I shall seek her out then.” He stood and then paused and turned to face Dean with wild excitement in his eyes. “But that gives me another idea.” Gabriel looked to Dean with eyebrows raised.
It had crossed Dean’s mind that Castiel spent all his time in exercise, writing, and contemplation when he was not with Dean or accounting sums with Sir Rafael. The omega simply reckoned that, as distracting as the impending wedding was, the colonel had redoubled his efforts to keep his cool head and stoic demeanor.
Before Dean can finish the thought, his stomach has lurched again in a way that makes him wonder if he'll lose his tacos, and when he reaches out a steadying hand, he finds he is touching Bobby's door.
He also made it his business to settle the new tenants as well as he could, making sure they knew where to get the goods they needed to start their own homes and how to get the money they needed for those things if they were broke.
being the next victim. His phone pinged, and Castiel took his bare arms off the table to check it. It was Claire texting:
He had been entirely correct in his early assertion that they must not kiss until they received a blessing on their union. Now that Dean had experienced Castiel’s mouth, his passion, he longed for it every moment. He needed it like air.
A young man with a bow tie clipped to his collar and an apron around his hips came up to the table with a couple of menus. “Hi gents, I’m Adam. Y’all know what you want?”
He mulled it over through the first course which consisted of pots of very sweet hot tea and a tangy soup with unidentifiable floating bits and branches in it. When Dean remarked as much, Sam said the branch was not a branch but a stick of green onion, and the other bits were egg. Somehow this news made Dean eat more heartily.
With some strength he hadn’t imagined he possessed, Dean sat still on the edge of the chair and leaned forward, his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands. It did not feel mild to him. “What do you mean ‘mild’?”
“But the next morning,” Dr. Franklin continued, “there he is again, swimming in the water by my little hut, and he strides out of the water, brown as one of us by then, and he shakes out his hair and smiles at me. ‘Good morning, doctor,’ he says, and I bid him good morning, too. ‘I was running,’ he says, and I ask him who was chasing him. But he laughs at me and says, ‘I find it a beneficial exercise,’” and Dean chuckled at Franklin’s imitation of Castiel.
Needless to say, the elevator down to the morgue was silent, too. Castiel took the time to look over the man with him. A few gallons of dried sweat gave him a shipwrecked appearance, along with his red-rimmed eyes and the pallor of shock. Clearly, Castiel was not seeing this man on his best day. Still, his best day must be breathtaking because, my God, was he handsome in person. The posters on his daughter’s bedroom wall that he had never given more than a glance to did not do justice to the sensual mouth. Dean’s lips, even thinned out in a pressed frown were still beautiful and inviting.
After an hour or two of this pattern, they turned out of the town and toward the back acres of the Winchester estate, facing long stretches of empty paths. In their solitude, Castiel cleared his throat once or twice as though about to speak, but then said nothing, leaving Dean with an itch of discomfort that the impression he had seemed to make on Castiel back in the parlor had been erased by his filthy familiarity with the common folk.
Castiel felt his heart plummet into his boots as Dean rushed out the door to go down to the yard to greet the newcomers and relieve Mick from having to deal with anything other than their horses.
Dean sat in the tense silence as Castiel pulled his boots off, and he watched as the man pulled away his elegantly knitted socks with a dragon pattern adorning them. He admired the shape of Castiel’s manly calves and then blushed and averted his eyes, not wanting to be caught staring. Quieting his own breathing and willing his fluttering heart to slow, Dean fixed his eyes on the yellow dandelions dancing in the grass until Castiel, once again in total control of himself, stepped around him to the lake’s edge, apparently determined to continue as though he had not just experienced a flare of desire.
"But there were two murders recently, and you're the best detective at APD, so obviously it's your case."
Things carried on in this way. A greengrocer was next with vegetables and fruits. Then a dairyman arrived with milk and eggs. The cheesemonger was summoned for some of the “finest cheddar in the capital.”
Dean followed the sound of his brother’s voice in the darkness and found him hunkered down between some old bookcases behind a desk.
A hush fell when the verse was done. No one was certain what he had been doing a moment before. The ladies looked around to see that they held bundles of flowers. The altar boy discovered a candle snuffer in his hand. No one spoke nor moved aside from glancing around, eyes rolling wild, taking in the cathedral like eyes newly opened somehow.
Now, he spent days on equations and drawings of the mechanics of the large lamps that Charlie and Gabriel wanted to see placed strategically throughout the town. Dean calculated a spring like the one used in the suspension working of the phaeton to create a clockwork that could not only keep spinning for an extended period (any watch can do that) but also do so at great enough torque to create electricity. When Charlie mailed Dean’s work to Gabriel, he ran through his equations and returned them with notes, and when Charlie eventually showed the specifications to Benny to see if such a spring could even be made, they were overjoyed at the possibility.
"Will-do, Chief," she hollered back. It was a good relationship. He paid her a king's ransom, and when he didn't want to deal with the world, she dealt with it for him without complaint.
If all went well, Dean hoped to return by nightfall so the animals wouldn’t have to suffer full udders and empty bellies through the night. With that in mind, he grabbed a lantern and a small bottle of lamp oil and added them to his pack, in case his trip ran into the darkness.
“No, he’s right. In Heaven I am a multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent. If my wings were visible in Heaven, they would be multi-colored and luminous.” Castiel turned to Sam, specifically. “Only exiles have black wings,” he explained.
Over dinner, talk continued in the vein of the financial stability of Winchester. Dean learned that when the 12th duke (whom Dean now understood to be Castiel’s father) died a few decades ago, his son (Castiel, though no one names him in this conversation) had been stripped of the lands and titles, and Winchester town and estate had been left alone to fall to seed. Most of the tenants departed if they could, but without a duke on hand to collect taxes from the tenants, the crumbling town became a haven for layabouts with no incomes to speak of.
“More, alpha. Give me more,” Dean breathed into his alpha’s chin, and once Castiel had Dean’s wrists in his hands again, he planted them alongside Dean’s sweaty head and gave the omega more.
When the game took a break, Dean stood beside the open window to smoke and peer out through the low sea fog. Light swam in swirls upon the heavy air, and the sound of the sea waves was silenced on the thick mist. Meg sidled up to him, just as he’d expected her to, dipping her hands into his pockets from behind. Dean caught her wrist before she could pocket the sapphire ring that came up dangling from her fingernail.
Neither Dean's reactions nor his answers were suspicious in the least, and Castiel was more certain than ever that Dean knew nothing about the crimes. Of course, there were some things in the photos that Dean couldn’t see. He couldn’t see that there was yet another person of interest in Sam’s photo who was taking pictures of something at the Citywide Garage Sale that day, and he couldn’t see the reflection Castiel had trimmed from the gun’s glass case. He had decided to ask Dean about the former and save the latter for his facial recognition expert. He pulled one more photograph from his breast pocket.
“No, Charles. Unlike you, I am not currently thinking with my knot but with my head. You did not see the quality of the materials in Benny’s smithy. Winchester needs a man like him, and we need him hale and hardy.”
He turned off the water taps and unbuttoned his clothes with one hand while using the other to dig out clean socks and undergarments from the wardrobe shelves. He opted for the green herringbone socks and the soft green neck tie.
The other goons in the gallery were not quite so notorious; at least Dean hadn’t heard of them in advance, so he paid their intros less attention.
Rowena put a stop to his efforts and ordered Castiel to move the omega upstairs. When Cas bent to pick Dean up, he squeaked, “Don’t you dare! Just walk behind me on the staircase, alpha.”
Castiel turned off MOPAC Expressway onto Enfield Road. "You turned off too early to get to my house," Dean said, puzzled. The cop knew he lived on the lake by the country club.
“So, you’re telling me the only thing missing is a Polaroid of you and your brother from 1980. In the background of the picture is a framed painting that your grandmother painted of a place called The Hidden Grotto where you believe your great grandfather hid treasure in 1934 when he declared bankruptcy to avoid the IRS. The supposed treasure was amassed in the 1910s and 1920s when the infamous Dr. Baker fleeced a bunch of sick people of their life’s savings.”
Following that, the town of Winchester was utterly giddy on New Year’s Eve at the prospect of receiving its master and mistress and their wonderful friends who had made the town such a gift of a place for them all to live.
At the gate, Dean had to tell him the code to enter the property, and it was like a miracle he had the email from Charlie on his phone to get this month’s numbers. Charlie took care of the place, which included security, opening his mail, and sorting junk from stuff she could answer to stuff he had to deal with himself. She also stocked the kitchen and kept the maid service scheduled for laundry and cleaning.
“Willow and aspen,” the bald man lisped through his gums where teeth were missing and gestured with his hands. Gabriel handed over another shilling and waited for the packet of powders.
Dean Winchester was a tall man. He wasn’t as tall as his younger brother, but he was exceptionally tall for an omega. He split his days between physical and mechanical labor, so he was also fit and dexterous. After the ceremony, in the cavernous hall, awaiting the wedding luncheon, Dean gained curious attention as he stood up straight by Sam’s side.
Ketch’s eyeballs drifted toward Dean while his face remained rigid. “I believe it is draped over a chair in the back kitchen, sir.”
Dean wiped his hand on the cuffs of the dead man’s striped trousers and took a steadying breath before carefully folding the paper back into its compact square. He tucked it neatly into his shirt before making quick work of the man’s other papers. There was a claim for a silver mine over in the Elks on the Crystal River. Dean figured that must be why he was up above the pass: some foolish notion to check the mine in the middle of winter.
Castiel’s strong arms held his omega down while touching every scrap of skin his hands could reach. When his fingers gently played across Dean’s brow, the omega whined, and when those same callused fingers plunged into Dean’s hot wet mouth, the omega sucked.
Castiel stepped forward on his single stockinged foot, “Dean—” He stopped when he noticed Dean tense as he drew close. Standing still, he attempted to correct Dean’s miscomprehension. “Mr. Winchester, I think you might agree that I would be a fool not to defer, at least, to the woman who keeps me fed. I shall ask Ellen’s permission, of course.”
Castiel flopped over and lay flat on his back a moment with wide eyes contemplating the deep shadows on their ceiling, and Dean used the moment of distance between them to reach into the drawer at his bedside and withdraw a stack of papers.
. Charlie did all the things. That’s what BFFs were for, though. Her words, not his. Too bad Charlie wasn’t there tonight. He could have used a friendly face. But she was in Houston, the next stop on the tour, taking care of final details for him before the band got there next week.
“We may be able to speed Mr. Singer’s work by showing the craftsmen that there will be money for them in Winchester if they will come.”
Meanwhile they explained that Castiel had brought Lord Milton and Lord Balthazar along to invest in the town and establish independent businesses therein which might attract industrious tenants. Dean wondered why, with ten thousand pounds already, the estate even needed outside investors like Lord Milton and Lord Balthazar. The gentlemen laughed, but then Gabriel answered.
“Yes. In the small globes, it is a strip of tin, but in the large globes, it’s a strip of platinum, actually,” she explained. “Platinum can get very hot without melting, which, in theory, makes it ideal.”
Pausing beneath one blue eyed Winchester with an elaborate wig and even more elaborate shoe buckles, Dean said, “This one reminds me of Cas. The chin. The eyes.”
They were images of men. Bare men. As bare as they day they were born, and proud as hell of it. Dean inspected the page with his mouth open mid chew and his cheeks hot, looking at each image and looking away in shame and looking back again in wonder. The headline on the sheet said “STORYVILLE has what you like. Tell your barber it's Time to Shine and Mr. Crowley's boys will do you fine. Mr. Crowley is a good card who always helps his friends in need.”
“Do you recognize this man, Dean?” In the photo, there was Derek again, and now Dean could see what he was taking picture of: vinyl records. He was at a collectors’ booth, and right behind him stood the collector. A former DJ from KUTX who had been semi-famous for his weekly two-hour round-up show of alt-pop hits from near and far— a mix of local acts and international independent labels, mostly from UK, but also Sweden, Canada, and even more exotic locales.
Everybody but Sam got beers and puled up chairs. Sam was in a wheelchair for a few weeks and still on antibiotics and painkillers, so no booze for him. Dean tossed tennis balls all over the property and watched Silla run like a maniac to retrieve them all.
“If there is someone willing to silence your dog like this out at that lake looking for treasure, you can’t just go storming in with your… calculator. You need backup.”
A reflected beam of soft light cut through the shadow as it turned, and Dean deduced that it was from a blade glinting in the villain’s other hand as the shadow reached up to the lamp and turned the gas off, plunging the corridor in darkness. Brady then turned toward Dean’s hiding spot.
Charlie also supplied more of the same details for the Mineral Wells iteration of Dr. Baker and his Baker Hotel, which was such a famous curative spot in its heyday that silent screen starlets to would-be presidents flocked to it to take the waters and gifted their host, Dr. Baker, very generously.
Dean said nothing for a long stretch while Ellen petted his hair, and she was about to stand and put out the last light when he sighed and looked up at her with his blown-out eyes. “What if I’m not enough for him?”
He caught sight of Sam and Eileen returning to the area of the cotton candy vendor and he waved at them with one arm while dropping his cigarette end with the other hand. Sam’s hair was wild, having escaped its usual carefully combed and waxed stasis. Eileen’s braids were still a tight crown around her head, sweetly old fashioned but elegant, and her face was flushed and bright. They both smiled, though, in that thrilled kind of way one might have after being caught in a sudden spring rain.
Gabriel took the seat across from Singer’s and picked up the abandoned broadsheet. Glancing over it, he asked, “One of these shops yours?”
“I see,” Dean said. “You are hoping for Winchester money to make more globes and be able to perform more tests,” he surmised. “But, the light is made by heating the metal and it consumes the filament too fast, right?”
Ellen’s daughter Jo, a reclusive alpha who kept a small herd of goats in town and sold their cheese and milk door-to-door, was even on hand to help her mother stir the pudding. Dean delighted in making her blush by asking about which omegas in town she had kissed, until Ellen slapped him with a spoon to make him stop.
As for Gabriel, he met an Indian Maharani named Kali who was in England on a tour of the Empire and fell in love. She was exotic and tempestuous, and he was a fool for her. Becoming enamored of her entire culture, he built a
McLeod snorted. "I should be thanking you, kid. But notice that I'm not. Now get out of here. I've got paperwork to do."
Cas told himself to breathe. He was going to sweat through his suit at this rate. At moments like this he missed Silla's deep brown eyes that trusted him implicitly, as if to say, "You've got this." In his mind, the brown eyes morphed to green, and the trust was still overwhelming. Dean Winchester was by no means a light weight to carry through life, but he was never a burden. Cas couldn't remember the moment when he had realized that he finally understood one of his favorite books by Milan Kundera:
Castiel Novak shrugged. “My aunt is getting older, and she may have only just told Luc and Mike the story.”
Dean tipped the tumbler to his mouth and let the whiskey roll over his tongue. It certainly wasn’t the good stuff, but that was okay. He didn’t deserve anything good tonight.
Mistaking Dean’s wide eyes for fear, Castiel was quick to offer evidence that a thousand would be enough for them to live on, “I know it is nothing compared to what you have as a member of your brother’s household, but--”
Dr. Baker’s shtick was healing waters. Before he got to Mineral Wells, Texas, and founded the booming business of bottling the locale’s so-called restorative spring water as “Crazy Water” to sell, he had been run out of Eureka Springs, Arkansas, for trying it there. Not only that, but his Crescent Hotel in Eureka Springs had been the venue for some dozens of suspicious deaths of patients under the doctor’s care, most of whom had bequeathed their fortunes to the good doctor shortly before expiring. The “Haunted Hotel Tour” there today encourages its more sensitive customers feel the disquieting vibrations in the hotel’s basement, which had been the morgue when the building was Dr. Baker’s first “hospital.”
Having deposited the horses with Mick and then finding Castiel still shut away, Dean wandered into the blue parlor to make use of its wide windows and superior light for drawing. He wanted to create a plan for the gift he wished to make for Castiel from the broken silver spoon that had come into his possession. Gabriel was there, writing in his little book with additional sheaves of paper spread out before him.
Gently, his sister-in-law sat down beside him and drew the lid open once more. She let one delicate finger slide along the elegant ivory before hefting out of its velvet casing.
Castiel turned to Dean and deliberately ran his fingertips through the omega’s hair at his temple, letting the lace at his wrist hover near Dean’s nose for a moment, Castiel stroked his omega’s face and looked into his eyes in such a way as to communicate the import of what he was about to do.
Dean looked somewhat helplessly back at the hand of photos splayed like playing cards in his tenuous grip.
Dean shut the shower off and dove right into the deep end of the pool. For a moment, he stayed submerged, and Castiel watched his body move under the surface. He wondered how cool the water was. Maybe the pool was heated. When Dean’s head and shoulders emerged, Dean shook himself like a dog and then swiped his hair back from his forehead. He glanced at Castiel before making a couple of laps.
"Nah. Bobby was circumspect. He didn't let things bother him in such a way that he would be inclined to complain to me or Sam."
“Morning, Detective. Didn’t think you were going to make it in today,” Trina greeted as she poured his cup of coffee.
Silla hopped up and trotted to the kitchen where she nosed the oven door down and open. The oven racks were completely gone, and Silla hopped in and curled tight into a ball.
Both men stood frozen a moment as the sounds of feasting and festivity faded away. Dean stared at Castiel’s face, cataloging the new lines beside his eyes and the unfamiliar brownness of his skin, the hope in his expression, and just as quickly as he had been frozen, his body thawed and then melted into Castiel’s arms. They held each other tightly, then, murmuring each other’s names, and several moments later, as Castiel began to push Dean away, his ears re-accustomed themselves to the din of the room, which had truly faded, by then, after all. Everyone was watching them, quietly whispering to each other, some wondering who the scruffy stranger was, and others watching the reunion unfold with watery eyes.
Sammy, on the other hand, had delighted in the tales, and just look at him now! Dean looked up to his brother’s face, his untamable hair, his broad shoulders, and his wet eyes. Sam gazed down the aisle of the grand cathedral as the music changed and Jess began her slow march toward them. Toward Sam, that is.
Once she was blanketed and saddled, Dean began to worry that Ketch wouldn’t appear after all, but as he led the horse to the doorway, he saw Ketch sitting with Mick as they enjoyed a smoke together. The dispatch was resting on his knee. Ketch took it up and stood when he saw that Dean was ready to depart.
Jeffrey's had a dress code, and Castiel had wondered if he should text Dean to warn him. Then he had wondered if, where Dean was concerned, Balthazar would bother enforcing it anyway.
Dean’s eyes began to glisten in the sunlight, and he pulled away. Tucking his own cravat into Castiel’s pocket, as the alpha only nodded gravely. In the silence of agreement, their hands intertwined, Dean fiddled with the sapphire pin in his pocket as he strode purposefully up the familiar lane toward the castle as if daring his husband to try to slow his progress.
Dean then toasted his husband, saying that he felt better than he had in months, just having his whole family back together again. The wine glasses were raised and emptied, and Castiel yawned spectacularly.
“Yes, I had hoped to dig a narrow trench and bury wire all the way to the house and construct a larger waterwheel, but the line was simply dead when I tested it on a small scale.”
Dean threw his head back and laughed long and loud. "She's really, really not going to be in the frame of mind to cook, Cas. Do you even
He cursed himself for drawing their attention to him almost immediately, as it caused the ladies all to notice the awful purple and green of his eye. Like a flock of frightened chickens, their voices quickly took on an alarming quality once again, but this time the noise was directed at him.
Cas smiled at his daughter's text. Dean looked up at him but said nothing. He knew it had to be a text from Claire because it always was on a Sunday around this time. Dean went back to reading his emails.
Cas must have passed out for part of the drive because they arrived at Seton-Smithfield Medical in no time. Once inside, the good meds were administered, and Cas was in and out of it as the emergency surgeon removed the bullet from where it had lodged against his humerus. He was set up in recovery with his arm bruising like an old banana. After obediently resting for a coupe of hours, he was alert enough to want the bathroom and in pain enough to not want to lie still any longer.
“Dean,” Charlie whispered. “Wind that thing up and punch the button when I say. And stand away from the door.”
Eventually, Castiel seemed to remember himself and he finally explained to Dean and the others that the man was Giuseppe Fierro from some northern region of Italy. Dean’s eyes goggled at the very idea of traveling so far. Then Castiel explained that the Duke of Winchester had met Giuseppe at his farm and fallen so enamored of his horses that he bought some on the spot.
Castiel listened, rapt, to the swell of aural ecstasy his Dean brought forth. Castiel had never heard its like, certain that Dean’s voice, confident and humble in perfect balance, wrought all the beauty of this plane into one flawless manifestation of love and praise for a Father whose presence Castiel missed desperately. If Castiel’s spiritual form had possessed eyes and face, he would have tears coursing down his cheeks. As it was, he felt bereft and exalted all at once, ensconced in the rafters above an ornate chandelier that did nothing to illuminate his celestial form.
The man with the snakeskin boots turned up dead on the first of February. Dean had been out checking his bear traps and rabbit snares, hoping for a few more skins to take down to town on his next trip. He had a rabbit in a snare off the deer track, so that was lunch, at least, even though he was damn sick of rabbit and squirrel meat.
Both alphas exclaimed in outrage, “What?!” And Sam turned to Castiel, whose sole focus was Dean, so he didn’t see it coming.
If he spent his dozy hours in the morning sun daydreaming of Castiel’s kisses, well that was no one’s business.
Castiel took a deep breath, looked up into Dean’s eyes and then studied the grass as if he had never seen its like before.
Luckily for Castiel, the lighting at the mahogany bar was dim, so he counted on Balthazar missing the way his face heated up. However, he made the error of looking away as he blushed.
His entire body shivered as he thought of the feel of Castiel’s muscled body against his own, of the taste of his mate’s sweet mouth, of the hot, wet, all-consuming kisses they had shared.
His heart clenches when he thinks of Sam. It's been thirty years since Dean has seen his brother. Which makes him wonder... He looks around the town again to see what future cars look like and is disappointed to see they look exactly the same as cars looked when he died.
Dean’s eyes widened, and his heart kicked up at hearing his given name fall from his alpha’s lips. Castiel must have thought Dean’s expression belied a fear of such an enterprise because he edited the suggestion. “I mean nothing untoward. I assure you. Perhaps we might lunch together daily, amongst friends, of course?”
Dean marched back down to the stables where Gabriel and Balthazar were catching the stallions out of the herd so they could be stabled in the stalls that were already appropriately outfitted because Mick was keen on keeping the gentleman horses apart from the ladies. Meanwhile, Mick was hauling down bundles of grass from the garret to feed them, and Charlie and Ketch were filling buckets at the creek. Dean deduced that those last two would be more likely to need his help carrying the buckets, so he set to fetching the pails up to the stables. He even got a look of thanks from Charlie for it.
In a little embroidered pouch, Dean found a variety of small bones, from a young cat or rabbit, he reckoned, and seven teeth. Human teeth. And not the man’s own, either. These were milk teeth. Baby teeth. And finally, there was a dark feather, a long one, by the looks of it, but it was cut up into short segments, about an inch each. The rest of the bag was just stuffed with some crunchy dried leaves, aromatic, but not like rolling tobacco. Dean had heard enough stories from the other fur traders to know magic when he saw it, and no way in hell he was storing this kind of danger in his barn and burying it in his own yard.
“That’s not how true mates work,” she said. “If he had been killed, Dean, you would have felt it, instantly and brutally. You probably would have lost the baby. Perhaps even lost yourself.”
No, the soundest choice was to ring the bell and ask for the second footman, Kevin, who Dean was fairly certain, was omega. If he wasn’t, then Claire would do to bring him bath water, but despite their shared designations, it still would not be altogether well in a house as fine as this one to impose frequent visits to his bathing closet upon a female.
Those too blue eyes filled with tears and that beatific look of awe returned to his face. The man leaned forward, the hard edge of the copper tub digging into his chest, and placed his face against his baby, just as he had done in those first moments in the tavern.
The husbands spent every moment together, making memories to think back upon once the child was born and their time together was inevitably cut short by familial duties of other kinds. Frequently, they lay awake together late into the nights while Castiel rubbed his poor husband’s aching back, and they spoke of the myriad things they had to do once winter took its leave.
Duval Street was north of the UT campus, north of the hospital where he'd seen Bobby's body, north of the venue where he'd played his show. Was it only a day ago? The impala rumbled up Sam's driveway and coughed to a stop when Dean cut the engine. He'd have to check the spark plugs soon. It would be good to get some grease under his fingernails.
When Claire emerged in her silky white cocktail gown, her bright blue eyes lit up Castiel's heart. "Hello, Claire-bear."
Dean grinned. “You might, Mick. Just wait til you see how things change around here by summer. You might even have the horses shod
Silla was in her bed and hardly looked up when her master stumbled in, fumbling with Dean's pearl buttons while the singer's mouth stayed attached to his throat.
Castiel finished his food startlingly fast and stepped inside his house to change into fresh clothes, even if he didn't take the time to shower. It was after seven on a Saturday evening, so he didn't bother with a suit again, instead opting for gray slacks and a royal blue button down. He might go for a drink at the bar at Jeffrey’s across from the drug store if he left his desk before they shut at two tonight. He walked back outside, checking his personal email on his phone to see if Claire had said anything about her report card. The evening was feeling fresher in the gloaming than it had in the balmy afternoon, and Dean had his little cooker packed up to go.
Dean studied his notes for a few minutes, flipping back and forth between pages of his notepad, his coffee long gone cold. He reached absently for the mug then grimaced when the tepid beverage hit his tongue. With a sigh, he decided to recap the story for clarity’s sake.
“Oh, do be reasonable, Castiel,” the governor scolded. “We have improved their savage little lives a thousand fold. We feed them, clothe them, house them, and teach them the King’s English.”
Dean wanted to leave, wanted his own bed and his own quiet memories of Castiel, but before he found a space on a wagon heading back to the castle, he had one other question for Dr. Franklin.
Meanwhile, Castiel was at his desk downtown. His eyes blurred as he squinted at his screen. Samuel Winchester liked taking pictures with his phone. As far as this type of surveillance went, though, it was pretty tame. There wasn't a single dick pic in the bunch, and there were relatively few selfies. Sam had hair approaching his shoulders and deep dimples in his cheeks. One thing was certain: these brothers had hit the genetic lottery.
Gabriel shrugged and took his friend’s arm to steer her around a dozen little piglets and their fat sow. “It’s fine if you do not take it raw, I think,” Gabriel said. “I have smoked it dusted over hashish, myself. I understand the attraction, but some men are so lured to it they become like the Lotus Eaters.”
Dean clapped the man on his shoulder and accepted a key to a replacement room while the mess was cleared and his belongings inventoried to ascertain what was stolen. “Don’t fret, Arnold,” he soothed. “It happens. I would like my room back once the cops have seen to it, though. I’ve grown fond of that bathtub.”
In exchange for mortgaging some people into Gabriel’s new houses, Balthazar was to front the money for skilled craftspeople to get the town on its feet, in general. Together, Sam, Gabe, and Balthazar stood to make a great deal of money in the venture. They had tried to convince Castiel to throw his small inheritance into the scheme, but he preferred sitting back and watching Dean as he scribbled numerous notes about which persons from his old neighborhood they should call upon in the city.
“If it were Sam--” she paused, censoring whatever she had been about to say. When she sat with a sigh on the edge of Dean’s bed, the princess said, “It is well that he left you with child.”
She took a moment to bask in the glowing smile on Patience’s lovely face, but then she said, “And last, but not least, to complete my quest of devotion for the lovely lady Patience, I present a kiss, born on the wind to her.”
Their grunts and ragged breaths were a symphony, and Dean knew the guttural sound of his alpha’s filthy curses would feature in his fondest dreams for the rest of his life.
He paused a moment on the word, and Dean watched his face expectantly. He couldn’t help but focus on the man’s slightly parted lips, dark pink and puffy from him chewing on them; they looked utterly seductive.
Castiel sat in the other chair with the set of scrubs in his lap. He was eager to change, but this conversation needed to happen. "How do I know that, Dean? I like you. We definitely have chemistry, but like you said, you're heading back out next week, and how do I know you're not going to pick up where you left off?"
call me by my given name, sir,” Dean tried to pass the alpha on the path, but they were at a narrow spot confined on either side by thorny roses, and Dean was loath to tear his expensive clothes. “You may not call me anything at all.” He pushed the alpha, trying to make way on the path. “Do not address me,” he grumbled in his frustration.
“I’ll have what he’s having,” Dean smiled to Balthazar, who nodded, completely disaffected and cool. The faker.
Castiel stood, leaving his eggshell unbroken, and counted his breaths in order to keep his movements unhurried as he bowed politely and elegantly to the small congregation. “My ladies, as much as I have enjoyed the delights of your company at my breakfast, I feel it is my duty to excuse myself and look into the state of things after hearing your very reasonable concerns about omega protection. I assure you I will make certain your safety is guaranteed while this villain is at large.” Without giving them an opportunity to delay or doubt him, Castiel disappeared through the doorway.
kitchen and making himself at home on my stove? I’m tempted to take that young man over my knee and teach him—”
Panting shallowly with eyes blown black, Cas didn’t object to the objectification of a photo, despite the bandage on his left arm and the purple-black bruise slinking out from under it. As soon as the picture was snapped, Cas stalked closer to Dean, backed him right up to the bed, and pushed him down. “Dean Winchester. I want to know what every inch of ink on your skin feels like against my tongue.”
When Castiel deemed himself fully healed and ready to don his boots again (which Adam had taken and stretched out for him by inserting warm stones from the hearth and steaming the leather), he declared he wanted to spare himself a full morning’s walk by riding the route that he and Dean had traversed previously. Gabriel thought it a capital idea and volunteered to join his brother. Since Castiel did not currently have a horse stabled at Winchester, it was decided he would make use of Lord Balthazar’s destrier, since that gentleman needed to write letters that day. Dean could not subdue the burning jealousy he felt that not only would the colonel ride their route (on a horse!) he would do so with Gabriel, Lord Milton.
That evening, after an informal dinner of cold meats and vegetable cakes, Castiel’s face wore a strange expression when he offered his arm to Dean for a stroll through the gloaming. It had been a clear, hot June day, and the unploughed fields bloomed in wildflowers as far as they eye could see.
When a wagon of omegas and children arrived in the yard the following day with a note from Gabriel, the stables were hastily cleaned and cleared out so the newcomers would have a place to sleep. Ellen and Claire got the kitchen working full tilt to feed the hungry new mouths, and Rowena had all the kitchen maids and footmen stuffing mattresses with straw and laying blankets on makeshift beds in the stables until she could get the castle’s north wing cleaned properly over the next few days to house people better. Sam adamantly argued that homes could be made livable in the town, amidst the construction, but Dean told his brother to stop trying to evict people who had just been evicted from the city. “What would they eat in town? How would they heat water? There’s no coal, no food, no stores. They’re staying right here until the town can take care of them,” Dean raged in fiery righteousness, and Sam said nothing.
The first thing Castiel did was open his Ale and pour the 40-ounce can into two iced tea glasses. He offered one to Dean, who took it with a small smile and a salute. They both drank deeply. It was cold and refreshing, but Dean grimaced at the herbal undertones. It tasted like drinking a bucket of wildflowers.
His eyes were doubly blind in the dark, his vision covered with black splotches left over from the bright white light of the headlights now gone. Cas reached the black sedan without being able to get off another shot, not knowing where Dean was, and miraculously without getting hit again. His arm had begun to burn and throb where the blood escaped him. He had to finish this before it became too much and he ended up out for the count like Sam.
Dean recounted the story of finding the man to Pamela as she fixed tea. He refused her offer of sandwiches, though, his heart set on a thing they started serving at the cafe since The War ended: hamburgers.
Castiel raised his eyebrows into an impressed expression and dis as bid. With the coat off, he decided to lose his suit jacked as well, and he sat rolling up his cuffs and loosening his tie while Dean swam. He didn’t really have more questions for Dean, and he should go ahead and leave; but he wanted to enjoy the tea and a nice sunshine for a few minutes anyway. At least that’s what he told himself.
From his cot beside the hearth, Benny muttered, “If you need a ring, you’ll have to wait a week or two for me to hammer it.” Everyone laughed and Benny chewed through another bite of the bread, his eyes clearer and his body more relaxed that Gabriel had seen him so far.
Once Eileen deemed her hair acceptable for dining out, Dean parked along the seawall adjacent to the Pleasure Pier. He pulled something out from behind the back seat before the others tumbled out of the car, and he tucked it into the back of his waistband beneath his jacket. They strolled past hot dog vendors and barkers touting sideshows, and all the while Dean scanned the area, looking for a place to piss. Before he found any place promising, the bright flashing green and red sign that said Chop Suey loomed above them, and Sam was asking Eileen if she wanted to sit indoors or out.
When the doorbell rang, Dean didn’t have a chance of hearing it with the tools buzzing and grinding away on top of the metal playlist he had on for ‘atmosphere,’ so Charlie answered the door. Detective Novak wore aviators and a trench coat, which was a bit much for March, but she conceded in her mind that there
After that late dinner, Dean took a spot in a wagon pulled by Baby that was heading back to the castle. Walt had told the wagon driver, Mick, who had spent the afternoon at the castle instead of in the town, that all the lights in the town were lit, so Mick detoured the wagon throughout all of Winchester for everyone to see them. Beside him on the driver’s seat, Ketch held Mick’s hand tightly as they wondered agog at the marvel of electricity. The twitchy draught horse, unaccustomed to the faint ticking whirr that the mechanisms made, was glad to be shut of the town and back on the road to her stables and the hay that awaited her there. Dean imagined that Baby, at least, was hoping for something other than dried hay as a New Year’s treat that night when she got home.
When an express rider rang the bell during breakfast one morning, Dean’s heart dove into his shoes. He felt the blood drain from his face as he heard Ketch open the door, and he clenched his fists in the tablecloth waiting for the letter to make its way into the breakfast room.
Benny, with sweat beading on his brow and his body shivering harshly, made no sign that he heard or understood Gabriel, but when Lord Milton pulled the packet of drugs from his pocket, Singer was there to grab them.
Several alphas swooped in to catch him, and he soon found himself in bed with his feet propped up and his sister-in-law holding his hand.
Benny grinned despite the fact that Dean looked like he was barely holding his eyes open. “You had me at beers, brother. Maybe you can get a nap in the hammock out back, too.”
“Two hours’ ride, Mr. Winchester! I shall be back for dinner.” He slapped Dean’s shoulder on his way out into the corridor. Charlie looked bemused at Gabriel’s enthusiasm and the pair of them listened as Gabriel clattered down the steps and slammed the door on his way to the stables to embark upon his mission.
Dean said, “Next, take that piece of paper and pencil you put on the pantry shelf back to your desk before it’s misplaced and you make yourself mad tomorrow trying to find it.”
"Don't be impressed. I rent the carriage house in back. It's one big room, but it includes the yard for my dog, and the yard is half an acre."
Good thing she brought four big men, too, because Benny was a beast. His bulk and muscle made him heavy, and his leg made him delicate, a troublesome combination. Still, with a great deal of grunting and sweating and a bit of cursing, they got him through the back door of Missouri’s shop, which opened to her living quarters, and she pointed to a spot by the hearth for the men to deposit their load. After shooing the men away with her thanks, Missouri raked the ashes in the fire, checking to see if any burning coals remained. Her activity caused Gabriel to look around, and he noticed several things.
He took a seat at the tea table, since Gabriel was at the writing desk, and set to work. Dean may not have known much of Castiel’s background, but the alpha had revealed to him that he was wildly fond of the summer wildflowers that bloomed in the churchyard at the Milton estate. Castiel had described poppies and pimpernel, cornflower and dog rose. Dean had envisioned the enchanting blue of the forget-me-not in Castiel’s eyes.
“Well, Your Grace, has no one ever told you to listen to your body when it sends you a message?” Ellen asked.
If Dean was disappointed with the way the detective closed himself off, he didn't let it show. He was exhausted and didn't need to be thinking about sex anyway. His problem was just that his dick was holding the earlier interruption against him. And this guy was making it difficult to not think about sex.
On that first night that Castiel was home again, the reunited couple slept over in their old room in the castle for convenience’s sake. It was bliss simply to bask in family (and because Castiel was so smitten with baby Victoria that he fell asleep holding her), but at the end of the following day they officially moved into their house at the Winchester general store.
“He didn’t feel much like walking,” the man replied in a vaguely Yorkshire accent and a very gruff voice. “Who’s the new man?” he threw in, never having even looked up from his bloody task.
“Oh you poor boy,” Dr. Franklin said, when he saw Dean. “You think I killed your man. I know that now.”
Missouri assured him that she and James would be over to the tavern shortly, as soon as the last of the loaves were ready. So Dean left with another hug and a hearty handshake that reminded him of the days before people bowed to him.
They were both insensible with lust and frenzied with passion. Each man chased his pleasure in the other’s body unabashedly. Dean’s hand grew slick with their combined precum, and Cas panted onto his chest as he thrust at a rhythm in harmony with Dean’s own.
He also noticed that every time he tried to steer the conversation around to Castiel, he turned the tables flawlessly and kept Dean talking about himself.
The cop walked Dean to his door, and it was like an awkward high school date for a moment. Dean’s brain suggested asking the man if he wanted a goodnight kiss at the door, and that thought made him look at those lips again. Luckily, his brain-to-mouth function was still offline, so he just stood there staring for a few seconds which gave the cop the opportunity to talk at him some more.
They were exhausted by eight o’clock, so they dragged themselves back up the pier toward the parking area. When Dean paused to light a cigarette, turning abruptly to his right to cut the breeze off the water, he spotted a pinstripe fedora ducking behind a newspaper.
A brutal sounding commotion, like a bout of fisticuffs, followed and by then Dean was half standing in the water, on high alert and ready to jump into the fray when the snarling growls abruptly stopped with a clamor against the door that rattled the items on Dean’s dressing table. Dean froze, even holding his breath, for some moments, listening for more, but no further sounds came, save for footsteps retreating in the hallway.
After the sinful treats from the feast, after the bubbling wine, and the lively songs, the grooms were allowed a few hours in the north wing of the castle, in the bed that had been prepared for them, before Castiel would have to ride for the capital city and the ship that readied there to take his regiment across the ocean.
At the whimsy of the breeze, the tables turned, and Dean caught Castiel’s scent for the first time. Instantly, he felt his nostrils flare, his gut clench, and he sensed, as if far apart from his own body, his breath turn shallow and rushed. His mouth watered and his head swam with a sudden rush of blood and dizzying want that gnawed deeper than any winter’s hunger he had ever experienced. Never had Dean been so utterly possessed of a desire this deep, not even in the throes of his tumultuous adolescence when he first learned he was omega. Never since that life-altering fluke of biology had Dean felt so unbelievably complete as in that moment when his being was suffused with Castiel.
The jolliness and frivolity carried on until dawn when the wagons were lined with saddle blankets to carry everyone the mile and half home again, and the host and Dean, standing in for the hostess of the party, blessed every hand they shook with a real golden half guinea. As they left, some folks cried and all of them thanked the good Lord for the grace that had brought them such fortune after so recently having known such disaster.
“Ellen!” Dean scolded mildly. “There’s no need for all that. I’m sure he’ll explain once that foreigner is sent upon his way.”
Castiel, looking like his old self again in his blue tailcoat and a decadently white cravat, proudly clung to his omega’s arm as Ketch greeted him and walked away to announce their arrival.
In order to save himself from making a scene, he decided to make conversation. "How was dinner with your daughter?"
Castiel regards the chain. Michael's Sword belongs to Michael. Zachariah ordered Castiel to take charge of the man. Castiel has removed him from the source of his pain and healed his wounds, and now he should deliver him to Michael, but...
Apparently roller coasters work up a thirst, so they stopped to buy Coca-Colas. Dean refrained but took a swig from Sam’s bottle in the end, earning him a classic look of annoyance from his brother. Somehow, Sam’s expression summoned Castiel’s image again in Dean’s head, and he nearly spewed his mouthful, choking it down, wondering how both his baby brother and the man who occupied his thoughts had utterly perfected a look that admonished Dean to his very toenails without speaking a word. Afterward, the trio strolled through the carnival midway where Sam and Dean competed at some of the games, shooting at paper ducks and throwing balls through holes. Eileen ended up with her arms full of Kewpie dolls and stuffed toys, but since they impeded her from communicating with her hands, Dean let himself look ridiculous by carrying them all for her. He charged her with teaching him various and sundry words in hand signals. She proved a patient teacher, especially since his efforts were hampered by his burdens. But they laughed like family, and lonely or not, it warmed Dean to feel her acceptance.
This honeymoon was the longest stretch of time that Dean had been parted from his brother in his life. He missed having someone to confide in; though he longed to confide in Castiel, he was hesitant to open himself up too fully in case the prince regent ultimately objected to their union. Keeping his true mate at arms length was his only means of survival if they were to be thwarted in their love. So Dean kept much to himself, despite the alpha’s attempts to spend every available moment with him.
When they reached the Winchesters’ little home, Eileen urged Dean to come inside for cookies and a game of cards, but Dean feigned exhaustion. The mention of cards reminded him of the address burning a hole in his pocket.
and smelling the alcohol and the lingering, unmistakable odor of pot told him all he needed to know about Dean Winchester. He wanted to scrub that image out of his mind and focus on catching a murderer.
Dean couldn’t stop a grin from taking over his mouth as he replied, “As far as I’m aware, sir, you outrank everyone in the house, save the princess and the duchess. No one needs permit you to lunch where you will.”
If reading detective mysteries taught him anything, Dean was certain that no one hangs around a park like this amidst laughing crowds and amusements standing in the dark of night, alone, reading a newspaper, electric lights or not.
“By summer, I think he said. But Crowley also says not to bank on it because these things are always delayed.”
"You were shot, and instead of running to the hospital where the police could keep an eye on you, you ran and tried to dig the bullet out of your own thigh. How'd that work out? You'll be lucky to be walking with a cane!"
“Cas!” Dean screamed when he was overcome with a feeling like nothing he had ever brought upon himself beneath his threadbare blanket in the night. Cas watched Dean unravel with his kiss-swollen mouth wide open and his lust-dazed eyes half closed before he, too, was overtaken with exquisite bliss. Incapable of shouting his mate’s name, Castiel merely yelled a syllable of nonsense before collapsing onto his mate and allowing the waves of ecstasy to wash over him, hips still working of their own accord.
