At that John laughs, and then he's trembling and shaking in a whirlwind of hysterics. For some reason it's funny to imagine Sherlock next to the woman – she's just... kind of has too much of everything... too large breasts, too full lips, skin a shade too dark, rather thick eyelashes...  And Sherlock's all... He's so scrawny, pale. And covered in bruises to boot, and when naked-
“You've been injected with L-311, Mr Watson,” says an unpleasant, disembodied voice from behind the wall of  white light. “Don't fight it or it will damage your cognitive faculties. Using this serum on free citizens is not usually allowed, but in your case there are extenuating circumstances. In a few minutes you will experience the full force of the serum and speaking an untruth will not just be painful, but impossible. Please, don't torture yourself.”
“I thought that maybe you hypnotised me or something like that.” John looks away. “I remember you were interested in the technique at one time.”
“I'll write a monograph on the impact of social stereotypes on professional skills,” Sherlock continues in the same calm voice, “and you're going to publish it.”
Sherlock doesn't let himself think about the nature of this necessity, once and for all marking that scenario as 'absolutely impermissible'. By whatever means possible.
Once home, though, John blows up. At first he manages to hold it together: puts on a kettle and the water for pasta. The pint he all but forced down at the pub has ruined his appetite; he doesn't even want tea, but Sherlock spent too long in the cold - he needs it.
Well, it doesn't matter if he listens to what his sentence is – it has been obvious from the beginning. Was this what you meant, Jim, when you told me you'd burn my heart out?
Of course. John hadn't slept, because he was busy filling application forms. It's possible he even had to bribe someone: everything had been done very quickly.
So in whose interest is it to besmirch such well-known names of this century of Britain’s difficult history? Let’s take a closer look.
Despite wanting very much to throw the yellow slave garb into the rubbish, Sherlock makes himself fold it carefully and put it in the bag instead of his own clothes. First, he doesn't have this kind of disguise in his collection yet, and second, there is no reason to leave evidence.
So now Sherlock is sitting alone in a semi-empty flat stripped of almost all signs of their cohabitation. Thinks of making a cuppa, but is too lazy to get up. A dull blue twilight slowly seeps into the room, drop by drop, like a morphine into a tube.
“I killed a guy once during an arrest. No one found out and nobody would ever. It was... five years ago now and Mycroft never once asked anything of me. Even helped me with the hospital for my daughter.”
Mrs Hudson smiles, her eyes suddenly wet with tears. “They are in the fridge, darling. I'll pack a stack of  cookies for the house-warming. I've been cooking whole evening; almost done now.”
“The moron fell down the stairs,” John answers the old lady. Perhaps he's a bit abrupt, but is he really to blame given the circumstances?
And still Sherlock hates the feeling of dependency. Worse than childhood. Worse than when Mycroft managed to stick his nose into Sherlock's affairs. Mycroft is physically unable to stick his nose into anyone's affairs these days, but that only makes it worse.
Sherlock suddenly remembers the unpleasant episode he had while in Desai’s flat for the first time. It was almost three years ago now. It hasn’t happened since - Sherlock monitors his psychological reactions very closely and crushes any inappropriate stirrings momentarily. He’d always remembered that he was not a slave but an autonomous human being and that he was only play-acting as needed. And now, when it shouldn’t at all be an issue, it seems to be happening again. In its multicolour beauty.
“Oh no.” Sherlock shakes his head. “If the body were mine, he’d be more likely to hold you for even more thorough interrogation. Tucker’s body, on the other hand, showed him that it was military intelligence who betrayed him to the abolitionists, because they didn’t need his intelligence any more. The abolitionist would hardly have given him away - they still needed him.
Being socially crippled and having limited access to public places hasn't helped either. John can't always accompany him and they haven't had the chance to acquire appropriate fake documents yet. Disguises are not sufficient. His connections have turned ephemeral like smoke going through Sherlock's fingers. He's started thinking that he'll not finish this before winter. Unpleasant, but he has to be realistic about his options.
Sherlock hasn't been to see Mycroft once since his hospitalisation. Until today. It's their first visit since their fight and the new balance they've found. Perhaps that is the reason that Sherlock feels the need to change the established rules. Or maybe he just has poor impulse control. They say it's quite common among sociopaths.
The man with the walking stick lets out a put-on sigh, as if wanting to snicker, but being too well raised to actually do so. “I know Holmes,” he continues then. “The little mise–en–scène, we just witnessed, means that he really is broken. Holmes is too proud and arrogant; there is no way he would step on the throat of his own dignity and just play at being a slave, especially under such a master.”
Despite his enthusiasm, the fate is decidedly against Gregory Lestrade passing the next inspection successfully because just as he’s achieved his peak in whipping up some serious statistics about sexual assaults, there's a knock on his door jamb – a decisive knock – some blockhead of a subordinate, no doubt.
Sherlock, however, doesn't hear it. His perception is floating, crystallising into the familiar, unbearably lucid mode where he sees and observes everything: from the crack in the lamp shade to the calluses on the guard's hands; from a new wrinkle at the corner of John's mouth to a small speck of sauce near the official's thumb fingernail. He notices the room they are in, a cardboard box in a labyrinth of similar cardboard boxes as seen from above, sees tiny people-ants inside, and how one of those ants, a figurine representing so-called Sherlock Holmes, thirty-three of age, steps forward, lowers himself to his knees before another figurine, which represents a John Watson, thirty-nine years of age. It's only a matter of topology, just a change in position and coordinates, insignificant on the grand scale of things, the planet or even London. It has no meaning whatsoever.
John's mind goes blank. Fuck. It's happening again. Again. He thought he'd never have to... John wants to punch Sherlock - hard; put all his strength behind it, to shatter him against the opposite wall. Why is Sherlock doing this to him? And at the same time he wants to pull Sherlock up off the floor and press his nose into the other man's neck, breathe him in (even if he has been crawling through gutters for two days) and hold him. And not let go.
Sherlock doesn't plan on wearing a disguise. They go to the A&E before John's shift begins: Sherlock's posture is tense, he walks slightly behind John, instead of next to him – which has now become customary, but usually he’d go on talking and generally behaving as if the pavement were narrow and it was too crowded. Today, though, Sherlock is silent and even keeps his eyes humbly on the ground. John has to constantly turn round to check if he's still there.
“What?!” John takes a step back, but Sherlock follows him. “Do you seriously believe that? How can you even...”
“Couldn't stand him. Never in his corner, that one. I've... a sister too, I know how it is. Doesn't matter... Who can live like that? And now he’s in a coma, the son of a bitch.”
“Did they really leave...? They left... now what? … are they going to press charges? ...they make people slaves for helping a slave escape. ...but I haven't helped anyone...”
“Too much talk. And too much distance,” John says, panting. “I can live without a blowjob this first time. Come here.”
The dentist raises her eyebrows, but leads John into the kitchen without an argument. Sherlock has to stamp down an unpleasant feeling of unease. One part of it is the same primitive crap about his
“John!” the cheerful voice of Lucy Riddle, the head nurse, peals out. “There was a phone call for you.”
Then suddenly everything stops. That continuous noise of thousands of hateful thoughts, of thousands of condescending voices whispering to him how to humiliate, to betray, to destroy even more effectively – all of it stops.
Amazingly enough, at the other end of the ice-covered plank is an attic very similar to the one Lestrade just left behind. The difference is that the room is filled with all kinds of radio- and communication equipment, behind which – again – a fairly young lad is making himself busy. What is this operation – run by a bunch of bleedin' kids?
“That would work,” Sherlock contemplates. “Good thinking, John! You have a wonderful ability to play along without having a clue as to what's going on.”
“Did something happen, Mrs Hudson?” he asks. “What did you want to talk about? I assure you,  it’s perfectly safe here even if John and I are away...”
Sherlock sits easily, naturally, not trying to seem more relaxed than appropriate in the company of mere acquaintances in a comparable social situation. He takes out the key and with a practised movement unlocks the collar, putting it on the coffee table in front of the sofa.
As for the pseudo historical speculations about the three years that they were gone from Baker Street and the judgemental public eye, then Holmes himself has addressed the matter in his memoirs. [JMorstan: judgemental public eye? XD Mum, your grandiose style is going to ruin you and your article!] I’ve read articles that suggest that the memoirs have been either custom ordered or written under psychological influence. The book has even been called a product of a demented old fool regaling his old glory days through rose-tinted glasses, which could be considered a weird interpretation since the text itself shows a great deal of self-criticism and Holmes’s own attestation to being a short-sighted egotist. But the current work has not been written to defend against those works, so if the reader had been visited by the ghost of Doubting Thomas with similar concerns, it would probably be helpful to read “Lionheart” for themselves. [JMorstan: Gentle hand there, mum! XD I sometimes get the impression that if you hear about Stockholm syndrome or Sherlock’s escape to Newcastle and that runaway slave form Uncle John had to fill one more time, you are gonna breathe fire!]
For some reason, in the court house lobby John walks straight past the exit and towards the toilets. Since he doesn't say anything, for a moment Sherlock stops at the doors. He really doesn't need to go, but John holds the flap for him and points with his chin to the doors. Sherlock obeys. Before the stalls John thrusts a bag into his hands.
After a brief hesitation John nods. “But I want to know everything you can tell me,” he tells Sherlock firmly. “I don't want to go into it blind.”
“I'm brooding? Yes, of course, because you prefer not to think at all, don't you? Let Sherlock do all the thinking, why not? You'll just whistle a tune and all will settle by itself!”
“Sherlock, it's... it's unbearable, I can't... Let's just leave, and to hell with everything! The court's prohibition on travelling expires in two months and then...”
“We don't actually have to go far. We can just... move to another town where nobody knows us! Cardiff for example. We'll get fake documents, remove the tattoo. The traces of the collar will disappear within a couple of weeks. Bloody hell, Sherlock, you just have to gain ten pounds and get a buzz cut, and nobody would recognize you even in London if you apply your acting skills!”
Next, John is led through a narrow hall and ushered through an unpainted wooden door with a small square window. Sherlock is inside. For some reason John expects him to be sitting on a cot, but there is no cot to speak of – only some mattresses on the floor. Sherlock is the only one inside though. He's lying in a foetal position on a mattress in the corner. When the door opens, Sherlock jerks and lifts his head in the same motion.
Greg’s room is right under the roof and one of its walls tilts under an angle. The tiny balcony has a flower box with what he assumes to be pansies behind the ornate window fence. It looks as if the next moment Gerda will wave at him from the window opposite and invite him over. Or perhaps she'll even push a wooden board over the gap between the windows for him to climb in...
In truth, the elder Holmes, the bane of DI Lestrade's existence, looks like hell. His pallor is greyish white, there are bags under his eyes and his forehead is covered in sheen of sweat and he seems to be shivering.
Sherlock's tone perfectly conveys what he thinks of the relevance of one's reputation, the lack of it and all the rest of the tedious mundane rigmarole. The situation was so familiar that John wants to weep of joy. Even so he has the presence of mind to intone, “First, you'll have shower. And I'll have a shower and then you'll tell me everything.”
“John, I don't like to repeat myself. What are you thanking me for? For not putting up a fight while you save me for a change?”
An unfamiliar male voice answers him, “Are you all right, sir? What did this slave steal? Do you know where his master is?”
“Clean this up,” the same voice says with disdain. “Give him an antidote and ditch him somewhere. I'm sure we don't need to worry about him causing us any further trouble.”
“He was wearing a golden collar.” Desai's shoulder jerks as if in a half-shrug. “He didn't even talk to me – fell to his knees in front of his master and tearfully begged not to be sent away. He rubbed Mr Osmani's boot with his cheek like a faithful dog. He was... very beautiful, our Arvind. Just like our mother.”
At times, it is difficult to reconcile himself to his reflection in the mirror. Sans bruises it seems as if something is missing. And on the street he has to make himself walk in front of John, because what he really wants (wants with inexplicable fierceness) is to walk a step behind him. John’s also obstinately helpful in this matter - he tends to determinately walk behind Sherlock’s left shoulder and if Sherlock sometimes forgets to monitor his behaviour and falls behind, John stubbornly slows his step or even stops all together. Sherlock is keenly aware that they probably look quite foolish when that happens, perhaps it even looks funny, though he never feels the desire to laugh himself.
Wherever they went, somehow, Sherlock always managed to guess the destination – he counted turns and listened for the smallest changes in the London noise. Or at times it was just the turns, because they sometimes agreed for Sherlock to wear ear plugs for the bet (or training). A couple of times John had tried to do it too; unsuccessfully. The sixth or even the fifth turn always proved too difficult a challenge for him. It's the vestibular system – it starts acting up the moment you close your eyes, and coupled with the vehicle movement... Somehow Sherlock is able to counter-effect it, but admittedly, he is a genius.
John wants to wake up, but can't, because Sherlock starts speaking, and he speaks in a way that he's never spoken awake – with a deep, pleading intonation.
“Perhaps I should have,” John wonders in a fit of acrid sarcasm. “Just say the word, Sherlock, and I will.”
Later, after several kicks to the ribs and kidneys, after he's finally realised that he can't break free, John only begs and pleads, smearing his blood and tears of rage all over his face; he's jerking this way and that, oblivious to the hands holding him, to walls surrounding him. The cold voice in his ear is still asking something about Mycroft, but John can't, won't listen to it. Bloody Mycroft... The hell with him... What does he matter, when Sherlock's missing and they won't let him... they're...
Some aspects of human communication would always remain a mystery to Sherlock. He’d known from the start that John would like Desai, had even been afraid he’d flirt with her, but it’s three years later and they’re still maintaining a respectful distance, while her husband is greeted with all the warmth of the deepest affection, sans a hug for some reason.
“You're brilliant,” Sherlock chuckles, arching up with the grace of  gymnast. “I've had a positively degenerate effect on you.”
Deep down Greg recognises slaves as individuals and therefore feels distinctly uneasy when one is present. He was taught at school that slavery was economically justified and deeply rooted in human nature, therefore will always exist as established by Marx and Freud. And still the concept has always unsettled Greg. In his teenage years he and his friends often talked about some day a cheap robot finally being invented which would make slavery magically disappear. Just as the assembly-line production drastically decreased the demand on slave markets: grandpa had told Greg about the ease with which people could plunge into slavery previous to that .
With this mysterious phrase Sherlock continues cleaning. How happy John would have been to see that only a half a year ago! And how deeply he felt the injustice of the situation now. Wrong motivation. Wrong time.
Alas, despite trying to distance himself from the mix of barely controllable emotions, called forth by the adrenalin and thyroxine boiling in his blood, Sherlock can't escape into his mind palace.
At this point Sherlock has to shut up because John turns to him, pushes him down on the bed and rolls himself over Sherlock, supporting himself on straight arms on the pillow on either side of his head.
Finally they stand. The man helps his companion into a coat and they walk through the door discussing the game. The attendant opens the cage and the girl rushes after them, waving Sherlock her goodbye. They get into an Audi – like the one Mycroft used to have, no more nor less, but blue – and speed off. Couldn't they have let her sit in a car while entertaining themselves?
“Bloody hell,” John moans, “So that's why I didn't tell them about Rohan and her lawyer! I thought it was a miracle or something. I even thought...” John halts, embarrassed.
John undoubtedly had wanted to save him. He doesn't have (can't have, it's extremely unlikely that he does) other motives. John hates slavery. To own his best friend is as humiliating for him as for Sherlock to walk after him. Every look he gets must feel like a sniper's red dot on his body – that's why his hands are steady.
There was a radio playing downstairs earlier, Diana Ross's voice singing, or some other insignificant blues singer that for some reason has evaded deletion. Smells like fresh pastry. Sherlock can hear an anxious shuffling of Mrs hudson’s slippers; she feels too embarrassed to speak to them these days, especially John, although it should be the other way around. She even looks at him only from the corner of her eyes.
Sherlock freezes, and pointedly staring at the receptionist's left ear (slaves are forbidden to look free citizens in the eye, but no one has said anything about ears), he utters coldly, “Tell Mr Pound that Sherlock Holmes is here to see him.”
“You told me you trusted me,” Sherlock says in a voice devoid of any emotion. “I admit, might have abused that trust.”
“You're a treasure, Lucy,” he unwittingly tells her. “One of these day's I'll steal you from Mr Riddle, just so you know. Who was it? The police?”
Sherlock almost hears John's irritated and weary voice in his head, and then as if for a purposeful contrast, John starts whistling “Somewhere over the rainbow”. Ineptly.
“Care to share your amusement?” he asks in a seemingly neutral tone, though the corners of his mouth have also turned slightly upwards.
Sherlock rises. Feels his neck. The temporary collar and the heavy one from last night have already left their traces. Soon they will become permanent unless he figures out how to get rid of the humiliating slave status. Immaterial. It's just appearances, because John intends it to be so. Because he could- no. John couldn't.
John is not Myroft. He had no choice. Sherlock won't allow himself to hate John even for a second. He doesn't own Sherlock. No one can own another human being. It's just that
After an uncomfortable silence where he restlessly shifts on the bed, he's sitting on, Greg says, “So... What happened then? How did you escape? Sherlock...?”
On his way out, Greg habitually grabbed a coffee from the stall, Sherlock, of course, didn't, and now Greg has no idea what to do with the cup. It warms his fingers quite comfortably though, so Greg's not really motivated to abandon it.
“... It's all because of you, from the beginning, you buggered brain idiot! You are the one that got involved with that sodding maniac Moriarty, and from then on failed to see farther than your own nose! Solved his puzzles like an donkey with a carrot on a stick! Hell, your face would scare every damn carrot! The donkey would have nightmares about it!”
Then he immediately has to wake Sherlock who, heavily panting, is tossing around in bed. John is ready to be flung halfway across the room, but it isn't a post-traumatic nightmare, just an ordinary one, and so, when Sherlock wakes, he just jerks and stills.
“He can't breathe on his own. Couldn't before either, not a breath of fresh air around the man... and the ties he used to wear... If Sherlock weren't a slave he'd pull the plug. But it's his family, you know... I'm glad that Sherlock's a slave now... I'm glad.” John laughs hysterically and almost misses the slap they try to bring him back to his senses with. “I go forth and Sherlock follows...”
“Yes, you are Mr. Equality yourself.” John snorts. Not on edge then; or he pulled himself together really quickly. “Same as always?”
It's over in a moment: the hallway is filled with broad-shouldered guys with black ski masks that leave only their eyes and mouths open, who wrench John’s arms behind his back, take his gun, gag him (with a professional, rubber gag), pull something impenetrable over his head, drag him down the stairs and push him onto a back seat of a sedan.
The first week at the new flat passes, as can be expected, quite peacefully, but the inner turmoil  turns John into a wreck. The removal van delivers all the boxes first thing in the morning, after which John goes to work and then spends his time irrationally worrying about how Sherlock is doing. Idiotic of course. And how is Sherlock doing, indeed? The flat is empty, no one there aside from Sherlock himself. Absolutely nothing to be afraid of.
After John has opened a couple of the first of such letters and falls silent for almost a whole twenty-four hours, Sherlock takes to burning all the irrelevant correspondence. The postman comes at eleven when John is usually already at work.
The TV set right in front of the bed is one of the definitive advantages of the new flat. And the telly itself is a newer model than the one they have on Baker Street – a colour TV. If only there were  more programmes in colour too!
“Have to?” Words seemed to be crawling towards John’s consciousness. “You mean… You don’t actually feel guilty?”
A sharp, almost childish resentment rises up in him, and bitterly he wonders why everybody – yes, everybody, even Sherlock to some extent, – seems to suspect him of having less than noble intentions. As if he asked for any of it. As if he'd somehow arranged for Sherlock to become his slave. As if he's...
She looks up at him again. “Are you reading my mind? By the way, what's your name? I haven't met you before, have I?”
He's had a similar feeling before – a feeling that the next second a bullet will fly just over his shoulder – but usually it was instantaneous, like a hammer to his head, tying his insides into a knot and making him leap forwards, aside or backwards. This time though, the premonition was like a tiny ice shard stuck somewhere deep inside his psyche, somewhat similar to a half forgotten childhood memory about sneaking into the cinema at night.
“However flattering it might seem to your self-esteem, you are not the one to have created the modern society,” he states shortly and drops onto the sofa.
“Could you describe the thief, sir? Let's try to catch him,” the guard responds in a business-like manner. “I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.”
An ordinary middle-class establishment, not a crime scene to be brilliant in. The only thing he needs here, from this undeserving hell hole, is to find a specialist able to fix a problem of physical nature which is neither significant nor urgent. There is no need to prove... What was it that he was trying to prove here just now? That he's still dangerous? That he's perfectly capable calling in old debts?
He has of course heard homilies on the ease and comfort of a slave life, but he would never have believed that Mycroft Holmes would subscribe to it.
… A wide hall of a shopping centre; crowds of people rushing by on their tracks like ants, each minding their own business. Three figures are frozen on a square of white tiles on the South-Eastern side of it. One figurine is on its knees. Some ant-people are starting to gather round; it's always interesting to see how a runaway slave is punished. Or maybe he is not a runaway? Perhaps he just misbehaved?
But on the brighter side - I bet most of you didn't think there even would be an update, right? Surprise!! :)
Lestrade takes a moment. And then says with admiration, “You’re one bloody ingeniously cold-hearted bastard! And your brother is the same.”
Twice? Really? No, don't think about the second time! They went very late and Sherlock insisted that they stay until past midnight, and then they took a taxi home.
Then suddenly he can smell colours – it's an unpleasant odour, somewhat similar to ammonium. 'That's what it feels like,' John realises, 'a cognitive disorder. So, an idiot for life, huh? I bet I'll be wetting myself and stuff... Harry will probably send me to some kind of institution...'
The room Greg is staying in overlooks a narrow street, paved in cobblestone, and opposite, a stone-throw distance away, several picturesque houses are huddled together, looking as if copied directly from a colourful biscuit tin. The whole of Basel seemed to be weirdly biscuity.
“Just don't tell me it's good.” It is possible that John is on the verge of explosion, and he needs to explain. “It is not good. It can't be. Should be entirely unnecessary. I know that you've never cared about the institution of slavery, but...”
“The bruises are fading. I've been giving myself new ones – our kind landlady lent me some jars and spirit, but this method has its limitations. Besides, another visit to A&E wouldn't go amiss – the new flat is in a different part of town.”
Further she presents her case, which in itself, isn't worth much. She has a nephew who's been living with her since adolescence (the aunt saved the child when the separating parents were trying to force their parenting responsibilities onto each other). Their house is a small building at the edge of a village, and their neighbour is an elderly gentleman, extremely reclusive, thought weird by the rest of the village because of his perpetually plastered fingers.
“I know that Sherlock managed to get in touch with the abolitionist movement and do them a great enough service to ensure their help in transporting me out of the country. It was reasonable of him; they have worked out routes and procedures and have experienced operatives. I also know that he organised my escape entirely remotely while setting up a number of misleading manoeuvres himself. One of them was the murder of Lawrence Tucker, whose name you probably won't have heard. The fact that I am here right now and also that Winston's people let you go after a relatively short and painless interrogation shows that Sherlock's plan was at least partly a success.“
The result is an excess of energy spent on a roundabout way of acquiring the injuries where Sherlock has to be careful not to hurt John in the process, because any stiffness in his movements would be noticed by his colleagues as well as by a certain Mr M's spies, who, Sherlock hopes, are still watching them.
“Ah…” Mycroft taps his fingers on the arms of his chair. As always he seems to have caught on without Greg having to elaborate. “Yes, of course. Tell me, Detective Inspector, can you really see my brother in a role of an abused housewife?”
John's voice is pointedly calm when he says, “I don't see anything strange in that. There a plenty of slave owners with weird kinks.”
John tries to hide his feelings at the mention of The Woman, but he's actually hoping that even if Sherlock notices a trace of guilt on John's face, he'll attribute it to some other reason. On the other hand, it's Sherlock. He did ask for the woman's notebook; he must have realised that John had been lying.
'I'm afraid I'll get used to it,' John thinks with growing feeling of despondence in his chest. 'I'll get used to talking about you as if you're a thing. I'll get used to you as my property. Not you as a person, not as Sherlock Holmes – I'll never think of you as less than what you are. But to accept that your body is a commodity... decide that it is quite normal... to live it – no, I can't do it´.
“What?” Despite being enraged just a minute ago, John winces, even pales. “But Moriarty is dead! He killed himself when he found out that you knew about his organisation, his plans and his secret code, didn't he? I saw the body. And his network can be unravelled from somewhere else, right? You told me that if you haven't found it in London thus far, it means it's not in London...”
John nods. A kiss happens again, this time more successfully. John, having the better position, shows his strategic initiative and skilfully exploits it: accurate bites and light sucking turn into a significantly more forceful invasion in only a couple of seconds; half a minute more and they're kissing almost roughly. Then Sherlock utilises his superior height and weight and practically shakes John out of his T-shirt.
At the end Sherlock suggests she calm her neighbour: in the British Empire it is not illegal to keep smuggled birds if they pass a veterinary inspection.
Usually he removes the loathsome contraption as soon as he comes home (John has given him the key), but this time he didn't – no idea why.
“John!” Sherlock grabs his shoulders and shakes him. Then, remembering that he doesn't have to hold back any more, he succumbs to the urge and fiercely kisses John on the lips. “We've caught hell, John,” he continues, turning away and feeling that despite of everything (or even because of it) his lips are spreading into a wide grin. “I've been unbelievably stupid. It's because of me that we are in it up to our ears.”
He could, of course, do both even in the woman's presence. Sherlock is his slave, his possession. People do get furious with their things and sometimes they get attached to them. The thought sobers him.
“Price fluctuation on baby foods for the last three months,” he answers shortly. “Irrelevant. I'll try to forget it as soon as possible.”
“Hm...” John pauses, apparently digesting what he's just heard and trying to calm down. Then he continues, “But this person, whoever he is, is probably somewhere high up in the government?” His voice is soft. “Sherlock, I... I hate to say this, but is there anything we can actually do in this situation? And it's not as if Mycroft actually needs it. Grown-ups don't wake up from a coma after several months – it's all TV show fairy tales. He can't even breathe by himself.”
Sherlock knows that many personal slaves, especially those owned by millionaires, visit ordinary clinics for the middle (or lower middle) class. Sometimes they even have their own health insurance. Ergo, he needs an establishment that offers decent treatment and accepts cash from anyone whether they're wearing a collar or not.
“A century ago marriage was practically a contract of ownership in our country. There was a time – not a long one, granted – where in certain counties husbands even had the right to sell their wives into slavery. So I guess, in a way, we could view our circumstances in the light of...”
First, there's pavement under his feet, then gravel. Then there are corridors, stairs, corridors again... They ascend a couple of flights, then descend some and John has no idea if they are above ground level or below. Then the sack is ripped off his head only to be replaced with a blindfold. He merely has a chance to glimpse at some concrete walls. They put John onto a stretcher and try to tie him to it. Sensing that that's it, they are going to open him up next, John makes the last gigantic effort to get free. Not a chance. They succeed and he's twisted, mangled, pressed down without even breaking a bone and for the most part without inflicting any serious damage. John wants to howl with despair and impotence, but then he feels the prickle of a needle in his arm and suddenly he's sleepy and indifferent.
“Of course,” Morstan replies instantly. “It’s still relevant. We still have no usable plan. Are you going to help us? In terms of payment, I can-”
It seems that Sherlock has cause for self-admonishment the second time today. He had pegged the salesperson to be Rohan's abolitionist contact. He should have seen that the cosmetics seller, displaying all the signs of leading a lonely life but with a wedding band on her left hand, was  not trying to mislead her clients, but a widow who followed East Slavic traditions; and therefore she's of the same ethnic origin as the nurse, which is the reason for their close relationship (neither the nurse nor the doctor were interested in the goods she was selling).
This is the moment John suddenly realises what Mrs Hudson had thought and feels light-headed. He closes his eyes and takes a couple of deep breaths. How the hell did it get to this point? He’d only tried to do the what’s best.
“Slavery is bliss!” Sherlock announces triumphantly, taking a step towards the woman, who is now backing away from him, throwing frightened looks around her, but no one seems to be rushing to her aid. “All of us have been brought into this world to serve the Lord, but the object of my service is so much nearer -  I can touch him, gaze at him and inhale his blessed odour. Is this not the ultimate joy of my miserable life? He's my universe, and I am happy to live my life just as the powers that be have thought wise to set the world order: for some to govern and others to obey. Oh, if only I were allowed to experience such a wretchedly harmful emotion as pride, I would undoubtedly be proud – because what could be more noble than my current situation?”
“Oh?” Sherlock seems to be oblivious to the fact that John is already straddling him. “Any suggestions?”
John's tone is unusually soft, and this is exactly the thing that helps the dark and scorching hot something in Sherlock's chest, which he's been fiercely suppressing for so long, to burst into life.
John's fingers are around Sherlock's member and he can't breathe: he's almost forgotten how it feels to have someone else's hand on it, not your own; someone he's–
“You started it,” Sherlock notes. With a sense of loss tears he himself away from John and quickly removes his own clothes. And now boxers... neck – a distracting manoeuvre, then a shoulder - the right one (the left he'll look at the next time, when it's light)... nipples? No, bad idea; John tenses up, and not in a good way. Pity: feeling the soft tissue under his tongue was rather pleasant. To cling more tightly, to press closer... Fine, there's plenty of time for that later. Sherlock rubs his face to his friend's stomach, inhaling the familiar, but a lot stronger smell now; he wants to groan, wants to laugh, to bury himself under John's skin and stay there; he wants to climb on top of him and kiss him again, take those thin lips between his teeth, taste John on his tongue – and then he does, without hesitation. No method to his actions, though.
Then without any noise or commotion the door under his hand opens and the room is quickly and quietly overtaken by persons in urban camouflage. Before Greg even has a chance to recover or realize what's happening, his arms are twisted behind him, one sleeve roughly pulled up almost to his elbow and he feels a painful sting of an injection on the inner side of his forearm. Greg's not sure if the cold shiver under his skin is real or imagined.
Sherlock, too, stands up straighter. He opens his mouth to spit out a biting threat twirling on the tip of his tongue, to remind Pound of his connections in different spheres of London society which haven't gone anywhere, to point out that his master is perfectly capable of filing a complaint or two, bringing into public view the schemes of buying confiscated materials for prosthetics through third parties –   although the Dentist isn't even aware that Sherlock knows about the last...
“Winston would have suspected me in any case, that was a given from the start, so it was essential that he would not find anything that would confirm his suspicions. Which means that I had to look like the most ordinary of slaves: beaten and broken. But with you as my master? No one who knows us both - and thanks to The Strand, it’s the whole population of London - would believe it.”
John, however, has always had the silliest ideas about the nature of duty, and in the current circumstances Sherlock prefers to compromise. Besides, what he can't admit even to John is that as soon as he crosses the threshold of the medical facility he starts feeling the pull towards his brother's room as if drawn by a magnet.
The note was brought to him by a homeless person the day before yesterday, and today, after by-passing the German border (a roundabout route, but it couldn't be helped), he's already here, suffering unpleasant tinglies from the unfamiliar language and strange continental behaviour of the locals.
Squinting at the corporal, the sergeant asks, “Hey, doc, is it true what they say, that human guts are a tad more complicated?”
Inside, it’s an ordinary bedroom – a bit larger than the one Greg just left, and less impersonal. On the wall it has a round rug, covered in fancy embroidery, and in the corner there is something that looks like an old sewing machine hidden under a white sheet. Greg's granny used to have something similar. By the messy bed there’s a two-tiered side-table on wheels, which is cluttered with drug bottles and syringes in tubes, apparently serving currently as a medical trolley.
“During your service you reported the violations in storing pharmaceuticals twice within a six month period. Name the reasons for your report the second time.”
That early the only people present are the night shift. He is offered to fill in the missing slave form, but John declines. He waits as long as nine o’clock, gradually becoming more and more feral. At first, he paces the corridors made out in a fake marble, then leaps out to the park round the corner, there's a fountain and the plague - Christchurch Gardens. Right. He perches on one bench, then another; watching office workers with their cases and purses going by. A municipal-collared slave is shuffling along, morosely moving his broom back and forth on the pavement. Judging by his appearance, he's also barely slept, though he doesn't look like a drunkard.
John's throat spasms, convulses, and for several seconds he seems to forget how to breathe. When the air comes, it feels like sandpaper in his throat. Breathing's boring? Painful, more like!
“Providing myself with an alibi and covering my tracks,” Sherlock all but snorts. “But I haven't told you that.”
“Why not? It's the middle of your work day and no work in sight. I'm interested, and in any case I need to wait for the sedative to wear off. And you clearly want to talk about it.”
“I didn't agree to anything!” Greg stubbornly contradicts. “I know that Sherlock Holmes used to solve crimes and that he still does. I had... fuck, good reasons to assume... that it had something to do with one of his cases! And I haven't been on a vacation for the past three years, wife's been whining that I need to rest, so...”
“I said that it was hypocritical of you not to remind me of the dishes, not that I will actually bother with washing up until there's a piece of clean crockery in the cupboard.” Then out of the blue Sherlock accidentally touches his loose tooth and curses.
If the cabbie wasn't too outraged, John got to witness a fascinating spectacle: totally focussed, Sherlock sits up straight, his head turned primly ahead, his thick brows furrowed. Sooner or later he starts smiling triumphantly (God, how John misses that smile right now!) and John already knows what's going to happen next – “Come on, John! Battersea South? I was hoping it would be something challenging this time!”
“You're a good copper, Lestrade,” says the dark one who Greg has already labelled an investigator, although a mere police investigator wouldn't use such unorthodox methods. “You can clearly hold your own, but right now, you can't lie. You can tell half-truths, omit certain facts, but to lie outright is impossible. Tell me, Lestrade, what did you really think? What were your conclusions?”
In the most ancient way possible. In the only way that matters. Blood and loyalty. Two against the world, backs to the mast (Sherlock snorts at that thought). Brotherhood of arms, partnership, unity. Does John realise that?
Sherlock has always been interested in cognitive bias and attribute substitution, particularly in how good people (generally speaking good people) - despite being obviously hypocritical - so readily justify their actions or inaction with moral considerations that only lead to more problems.
In truth, one of his lower teeth is a bit loose and aches unpleasantly. Sherlock had just been in the process of feeling it with his tongue, tasting blood.
“It's hair mousse! Mousse! For men! Look at you! You can't even dress yourself! Even my homelss network wouldn't take your jumpers!”
Sherlock almost said it out loud. Pound knows nothing, nothing about him or his friend – master – John.
There is no way he can tell the police about the kidnapping. Not all of his and Sherlock's recent actions have been strictly speaking lawful and should they start digging... The cold-blooded fiend with a cane was right about that.
“No, of course not. But that the set-off date of their trip as well as their return were contingent with my approval has always been a part of my deal with them. I disliked the idea that they could be apprehended because of the Movement; they could very well give us away. It would be a shame to work so hard and then fail because of stupidity of others.”
Sherlock turns away from the window and makes eye contact with John. John is not smiling, but it’s plain to see that he approves.
At this point Sherlock finally sits down next to John, embraces him. He takes the gun out of John’s unresisting fingers and kisses his temple.
Sherlock gets up very slowly as if in pain or discomfort. Banged up? He's wearing a grey, out of shape t-shirt (John's), extremely bright, but dirty windbreaker (unfamiliar to John), track pants and trainers. He steps up to John and the woman, his eyes on the floor and frowning in visible discomfort, kneels down -  first on one knee, then the other.
“A dream where I...” Sherlock breaks off, waves his hand as if to wave the matter off, then sighs and rubs his neck. “I'm a child there. Maybe ten or twelve years old. In real life I was actually bigger and taller than my peers, but there I'm small and weak. That's especially annoying, because I remember that it's wrong and remember myself as adult. Anyway, in the dream I'm kidnapped and taken somewhere in India. I'm sitting at the feet of some rajah and...” Sherlock smirks, but it's not a happy smirk; John imagines he can see something childish and even hysterical in that smirk.
John blushes. His answer is a swear word, fortunately delivered in a low voice, because at the same moment a man appears in the kitchen door. He looks a little over thirty and is introduced as Martin Morstan.
“I've boxed you in,” Sherlock repeats grimly. “You can't start a family or even a relationship.” He slides off his coat and hangs it behind the door. “You can't move flats because it would be problematic to find a landlady with a similar attitude to slaves and me in particular.” He draws a key form his suit pocket, swiftly unlocks his collar at the back of his neck, and carelessly deposits the device on the shelf. “You can't lead your own life, because I neither have proper freedom of movement nor can I act independently without you, both of which I need for my work. You can't even have any guests over, because every woman would immediately start wondering about your life choices and the way you manage your movable property.” There's contempt and bitter irony in Sherlock's tone. “It's a dead end, John Watson.”
“But you do own me,” Sherlock corrects him calmly, even though his heart is beating violently. At this angle, in the twilight, John's face is strange, unfamiliar. “And you do want to. But it is normal, John, because I, too, own you.”
Her push at her instrument case is a bit harsher than necessary. “Do you expect me to tell you my life story now?”
John gave up looking for a permanent position a long time ago. As a result, he has no social security, but as a substitute GP he is well-paid, always in demand and it's less time-consuming than regular shifts. Combined with his army pension he has just enough time and income to run around after Sherlock and he doesn’t need more.
Still, the need to cry from helplessness persists and it seems that John has given in. At least the blindfold, when removed, feels wet. He's untied from the stretcher and put on a hard chair with armrests, his hands and feet fastened to it with metal cuffs – inescapable. Almost relaxed,  John tugs at his restraints, but there's no give. Nope, he won't be getting out of it. Perhaps they'll kill him soon. It's too painful to think of how he let Sherlock down...
The door opens and a nurse (about thirty, divorced, a young son, lives near-by, comes to work on a bike) comes in, glances at him. Fear. Pupils dilated. Of course. Slaves are not supposed to be here at all, let alone without their master.
Thankfully the corner of their desk turns out to be quite a useful tool for inflicting damage. In a decade or so when it will be possible to publish a paper about self-inflicted injuries, he'll make sure to recommend the company that made this piece of furniture.
Mycroft Holmes does, indeed, look ill and broken, especially wrapped in that god-awful grey blanket. Still, when he mentions his debt, the predatory smile on his lips makes Lestrade shiver. It’s not the first time Greg thanks his good luck that he’d found a way to cooperate with the Holmes brothers all those years ago; that he hadn’t gone against the the pair: the younger, so incredibly annoying and the elder, the other’s obscure, but threatening shadow.
Moving back to Baker Street was difficult after three years, even though Mrs Hudson welcomed them with open arms. As a part of his role as a slave, Sherlock always did the groceries (unless he had more pressing matters to attend) and when they were back at Baker Street, he also, almost went that first night. Then he thought, no, we’re back, it’s John who has to- no, he then realised, John doesn’t have to do anything. And if Sherlock chooses to, he can go to the grocers himself. Or he can choose not to. But maybe, John would like it if Shelock did…?
'Stop it!' John tries to tell himself. 'It's Sherlock. You know Sherlock – he's doing this on purpose, right? Just look at him – is he helpless? His shoulders are wider than yours, his muscles are all there even if he has lost some weight, and he fights better than you, even. When by the rules – definitely better – or with a sword or something. He was right, Watson – you are a hypocrite. You're thinking of him as a slave, you are making him helpless in your thoughts, destroying his willpower. Just put the collar on  - that's what he wants.'
Sherlock walks through into the kitchen, managing not to disturb John. The doctor is almost comically focused conjuring coffee out of his new, rather simple coffee pot, which he's obviously bought some time during the last week and hasn't used once.
“Yes, exactly. I do read your mind.” Sherlock nods. “That's how truly brilliant I am. On this occasion however, your meaning has escaped me.”
leaving him alone with a strange man, a threat. The second part is even less rational and thus irritates him even more: John and Sherlock are friends first and all the rest second (at least that is how John might view it; they've never discussed their relationship). Rohan Desai is, objectively speaking, a beautiful woman, and unquestionably John's type. Besides there would be no complications in the form of a slave collar which Sherlock has...
He returns to their flat without beans, barely holding on to his temper, and starts with punching the door frame.
“Sherlock, I...” Greg struggles to find words and feels terribly anxious which makes him ferociously angry with himself. Thankfully, he soon remembers that Sherlock and John still take on cases. John has even published a story recently in The Strand. Even though it was an old case, from before… before the trial. “I don't think... I don't think I can help you. It's a homicide department and you...  If it's about... any of your cases, John has to come himself and then...”
“Call me Dr Watson,” John finds the strength to utter in an ordinary tone, squinting and wetting his lips. “Or Captain.”
Sherlock, being the horrible person that he is, has the audacity to nod approvingly. “Later than I anticipated, but you are interpreting the evidence correctly.”
He doesn't want to let go, he wants to bury his nose between Sherlock's neck and shoulder, slide his palms over the hard planes of Sherlock's back, gradually calming down his own racing heart – in short, do all those normal things people do when waking up from a bad dream next to their significant other.
“The passion for tidiness is not mine, it's yours,” Sherlock truthfully, although also confusingly, explains. “Subterfuge. It has to looks like it's your living space shared by me, not the other way around.”
John wants to ask, 'Are there any letters from clients?', wants to say, 'Sorry, no provisions today. How about a sandwich?' Instead, he just comes up to Sherlock, embraces him from behind and presses his cheek to the detective's shoulder.
At times though, his perception expands into an additional, third dimension. The feeling is suffocating, as if a two-dimensional plain, full of steroids, is hopelessly trying to plunge up into unreachable heights, but lacking the required neurons it is utterly impotent to fulfil its desire. Right now, for instance, everything around Sherlock has turned void and hollow; a map of thin threads, an image as if from a bird's view, is laid out before him, absorbed through his skin: the room, framed with walls, floor and ceiling; the building's plan from above, the roof removed; the web of the streets outside. Multiple bodies bundled up into synthetic materials, linen, cotton, plastic and steel. Tiny, puny people.
“No. I was given a choice.” Sherlock’s voice is hard. “It was either standing before the court of law with a predetermined result of being convicted, or fleeing the country and getting you, Mrs Hudson, and Lestrade killed. I knew that until I destroyed Moriarty’s web, there was no way I could have changed my name (not even illegally) or travel to Kenya, as you so kindly offered. The problem was that I had no idea who was watching us and how. I couldn’t put you all at risk like that. It was only later that I realised that there was no such a web and that Moriarty really was just a lone consultant for hire who had occasional dealings with Winston.
So whose corpse was found in Clapton...? Can't be Sherlock's. It just can't... And if it is... They'd found Irene Adler's corpse once too, so what? Later it turned out she'd been alive – died only after – and bad habits can be addictive. No, Sherlock's alive, until proven otherwise... Until John sees his body with his own two eyes.
“Does anybody know who his master is?” the older guard asks (single parent, three children, loves chocolate, which he's allergic to).
Exiting the room requires passing the steel cage containing personal slaves of some of the audience. There are only three (keeping a slave is not inexpensive, and thus uncommon) and they are not unpleasant or anything: the usual lot of groomed household servants. Even one slave-bodyguard with a typical subservient gaze. Nevertheless, when confronted with the cage, John's gaze stumbles. He leaves without a backward glance.
Determinedly, he strides to his bedroom and dives under the covers, to John. John puts away the book he was reading, shuts off the light. And once more starts giggling.
“It's very important.” Sherlock stresses the word 'important'. “It's about...” He hesitates. “It has to do with Moriarty's network. I need you to behave naturally and you're not an especially gifted actor, but you are excellent at suppressing your emotions. Suppressed confusion and anger will benefit us in this situation. All right?”
“I…” Sherlock apparently had some decency to look slightly guilty. “I’m afraid that I have been, so to say, putting certain ideas into your head, John. All this time… It was one of the two distracting manoeuvres.
Dear readers that have subscribed: THAN YOU for sticking with me! And triple thank you to those who poked me and motivated me to finish. I hope the epiloge will be quicker. I told myself that I'm not allowed to dedicate myself to Avengers realm and write Hawkeye before I finish this. So I have motivation.
For the first fifteen years of my life I practically lived at 221B Baker Street, this is how often my parents visited its famous occupants. That is why it is so painful for me to see Sherlock Holmes‘s name gets dragged through the mud on the boots of so-called revisionists; and that in numerous popular articles, his and Dr Watson’s contribution to abolishing slavery in Great Britain tends to be depicted as inconsequential or even having a negative impact; and it is true: their contribution might not be crucial, but it is still unarguably significant. [JMorstan: Too long and complicated, rewrite. What does it even mean, “to drag through the mud on the boots “?] Despite having retired in the mid ‘30s, Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson remained in London. Their residence still tended to gather a most peculiar set of individuals, starting with Scotland Yard officers and ending with international ex-criminals. If one were to pay attention, attending these gatherings was an excellent opportunity to observe how history was made outside of the whims of the royal family or parliamentary sessions. [JMorstan: delete ‘outside’ and after.]
His reward is an almost inaudible relieved sigh and a barely there smile. John even seems to stagger a bit.
Lestrade has a feeling that he can hear a slight parental envy underneath the calm tone, but he ignores it.
Sherlock is standing at the window and looking down at the city. London is just as it always has been: masses of people milling pointlessly around in narrow, ancient streets. Their whole lives, their work and pointless little pleasures of the so-called respectable sort could be described via series of meaningless equations that dictate their choices, all similar with little variation. It’s an anthill activity where every ant seems to have its own goal, but the dead beetle will still inevitably be carried to destination. Despicable.
Sherlock knows that Pound is not like that. The Dentist's motivation is fear. On the other hand, Pound is a professional – even with a discount his services are not cheap and justifiably so.
Moving to Camden is scheduled for the end of the month. The new studio apartment has a view on a park and a nice-looking lawn and the flat itself is quite decent, because why the hell would John Watson, who earns enough on his part-time job at the clinic be economising on his living conditions, especially when Sherlock also makes profit on the stock market and his detective work has finally started to pick up?
“My master,” Sherlock stresses the words. “Can't come. Please, Lestrade, we need to talk... privately. Not here. In the park, perhaps?”
Furthermore, these ‘revisionist’ works are not only obvious attempts to blacken the efforts of those who have experienced the ‘joys’ of slavery and are now doing everything in their powers to help their fellow people. They are even more than that; their desire seems to be to ridicule even a mere idea of supporting the North American abolitionist movements. Now, when Europe has finally overthrown the oppressive shadow of legislative servitude, an even more terrible beast has raised its head - illegal slavery that North America is still one of the main black market suppliers of.
Despite the subconscious feeling of disgust all slaves invoke in him, Greg suddenly experiences a mix of intense pity and deep sorrow. How the hell did that happen? Some altercation on the street, no doubt - a result of the ordinary Sherlockian disrespect and the rest is his habitual lack of sleep and malnutrition? Or... No, Greg doesn't even want to think about that. John is a regular guy. Besides, Sherlock's his friend. Was a friend. Damn, as if he hasn't got enough things to worry about...
When Sherlock realises the reason he hasn’t sat down, he feels an ice cold shiver of fear run down his spine. It's not that he's really still deducing the room, it's just that it seems to be impossible for him to be the first one to take a seat on a battered sofa (someone probably has a habit of reading with their feet up and leaning on the armrests) while there are
John doesn't stop to admire the view. Forgetting how to breathe, he scrambles down the stairs himself; his knees hitting the floor next to Sherlock, one hand checking for a pulse in the loon's neck and the other pressing down on his shoulder, lest the maniac try to rise.
“We have a very interesting discussion ahead of us, I see.” Morstan sits down, smiling only with his mouth.
The second visit to A&E would have been positively tedious if a young, fair-headed woman hadn't started talking to him. At first she seems so dull and uninspiring that Sherlock doesn't even bother to deduce her aside from the obvious: she ate a hamburger for breakfast and her younger brother's an addict.
Holmes expression almost resembles amazement. “ECM is Electronic Computing Machine,” he explains after a pause. “A device capable of storing and analysing large quantities of information. It's an experimental project and I am the only one to have access to one of the information banks of the device. It's... difficult to explain, but the important part is that it is impossible to access without a password or destroying the device, which stores the information.”
“Slavery is paradise!” is his parting, now calm, sentence. “Isn't that what you wanted to tell me about?”
His eyes hurt something awful. He can't even tell if it's from the injection or the unbearably bright light flooding the concrete room with bare walls.
Finally, Sherlock lowers the newspaper and growls, “For God's sake John! Take the underground to Euston or Liverpool Street, find a couple of second-hand shops and buy me clothes.”
John's lips form an uncertain smile. He clears his throat and his voice is hoarse when he says, “How long?”
Strange to be in his own bedroom again after four months. Sherlock falls asleep still numb with the realisation.
Life on Baker Street is back on its usual track. Indeed, very little has changed; John continues doing the shopping, making tea, and grumbling about Sherlock refusing to eat. There are some particulars, but Sherlock decides not to draw John's attention to them just yet; it could be a case of simple statistic anomaly. Besides, he's really not interested in John getting back to nagging at him about whose turn it is to do the dishes again.
“I think I'll read something,” Sherlock says. “By the way, there should be a letter for me tomorrow. Could you deliver it somewhere?”
“All right then. All’s well that ends well, I suppose.” Morstan sighs. “I’m glad for you, although I have to admit that part of me hoped that it would still go to court.”
Cool water does clear John's head a bit, so when they come out of the shower he demands an explanation from Sherlock, who seems to become so disgustingly domestic that he expropriates the only dressing gown they can find in the room. John doesn't let himself be irritated for long, however, and wraps himself into a blanket (it's not Sherlock's prerogative to walk around pantless in a sheet, is it?). Unless the room is bugged...
“But I don't need help,” Sherlock utters in a quiet voice, feeling a cold fury boiling inside him. “Every blow he delivers I receive with joy, because it is delivered with a loving hand. I love my master, I love everything he does to me. I'm a slave and that is wonderful: I don't have to make decisions, think about the future or worry about food and shelter. All I need is to please my master, and isn't it great that I can help him relieve his stress and help him let out his frustrations on me, instead of on himself?”
“Right. Thankfully, with restoration the psychological evaluation is not required, so it went rather quickly. And Sherlock also got a substantial compensation, so that’s something at least.”
“What would you say if I kissed you right now?” he asks, hoping his voice betrays nothing but cold, clinical curiosity.
His tone is strange, making John cringe internally. Sherlock doesn't speak entirely like a slave, but not as a free man either. His voice is hanging on a thin thread, words free-falling off it and hovering in the cold air forming a spiralling staircase into the abyss. Hell, if John didn't know it was just a game, he’d...
'And what of it?' an inner voice, which sounds exactly like Harry, laughs. 'Aren’t you one already?'
“Watson has no such talent. No, I believe that this primitive little soul is, in fact, all there is to see – a possessive maniac with a fixation on Sherlock Holmes.”
Not the best legacy for John. In that case Moriarty's people would get to John, no problem. Actually, they can do it now, and it's not only John under the hammer. Sherlock has to unravel this damned Jim mess before dealing with his personal little grievances.
That night John doesn't get a wink of sleep. He's taken apart and reassembled his revolver several times, checked the extra bullets in it's hiding place behind the fridge, has done push-ups - one hundred and fifty plus (has to force himself to stop when he loses count, because the last thing he needs the next day are trembling limbs), then paces several miles worth of carpet circles.
The Russian (or a Pole?) makes a face, a judgement either on his confidence or on his slave status, but says nothing. The saleswoman pointedly stares past him.
Sherlock regards him closely. Fear. Tension. Uncertainty. Awkwardness. But the most important – fear. Almost terror, though well concealed. The only other time Sherlock had seen John like this was at the pool, in those short seconds they both thought that Sherlock would have to shoot the vest full of explosives.
He'd been wrong. Not enough data: no independent source for general information. Libraries and available periodicals are woefully incomplete.
John groans into his mouth and tries to say something – Sherlock isn't terribly bothered: he's not protesting, is he? No, John's definitely not protesting: thrusting his hips to meet Sherlock's, whispering something, his hands stroking Sherlock's back. And his hands are sure, strong - a peculiar contrast to the helpless trembling of his shoulders, the surrender of his head, bent backwards as far as it can go. The sight of it hits Sherlock right into the centre of his wildly beating heart.
“Why did we even come here?” John inquires, his fists clenching of their own volition, his patience almost run out. What he really wants is to punch the closest frozen wall and the hell with his fingers.
“Well, about that…” he says. He pauses, thinking of how and even if he even should talk about it. “It’s… I mean, the way he was when he came to me… and the reason he sent me here…”
One would need a very attuned ear to hear the faint condensation in her tone. Also, she's sincere in her compassion. A volunteer. A seamstress who helps people in her free time. As well as she knows how.
“Let him come in too,” she tells John in a neutral tone. “Can't leave him in the corridor now, can we?”
“Correct. I exposed him to the Movement - provided them with definitive proof and they dealt with him.”
If John found out about it he'd probably pull his lips into a polite smile and say, “You've never liked rules, have you?” Or perhaps he wouldn't smile. Perhaps he would sympathise – what a waste of emotion.
Sherlock squeezes her hands, feeling as if something hard and cold is melting inside him. Irrational relief. Psychological reaction to realisation of being trusted.
'It's fine,' Sherlock tells himself, 'it's for a case.' For an investigation. It's not him, it's another person lowering his head and walking near the walls, evading constables and drunken bullies. It isn't him  talking in a low voice and abasing himself in front of the bookie, placing a bet in John Watson's name. It isn't him standing at attention in front of a strange woman of forty (a journalist, successful, hiding an affair, probably with the editor of her magazine) and waiting until she finishes staring at him and puts a card with her phone number into the pocket of his jacket.
“The only thing they'll do is to escort me out of the slave-free zone,” Sherlock states. “Perhaps fine my master. With a sum roughly equal to the one for half an hour of illegal parking. I'm sure he'll survive. The question is, can your clinic survive after something I know becomes public, Derek?”
Sherlock has no intention of venting his anger on John. It would be absolutely irrational, futile, and not to mention ineffective. Besides, he knows very well that John shouted for help in the heat of the moment without any subconscious (or conscious) wish to humiliate Sherlock. He also understands that the 'ice incident' was a perfectly normal response of care for John, and that four months ago he would have acted in exactly the same way.
John tries to blink away the terrible ache in his eyes, along with the pain in his previously twisted arms. No. There's no way out, not a chance, only an unbearable voice behind the light.
Sherlock meets his gaze. “You said you trusted me,” he says with a put-on calm. “Do you take it back?”
“Before you moved out of Baker Street in December Sherlock Holmes was treated at the A&E twice. He paid in cash; who was responsible for the injuries?”
“I have this dream sometimes...” he says in a distant tone. “It started after I talked to Dr Desai.”
“Your property, Dr Watson,” the official says in a pleasant voice. “Are you sure you don't want to implant a tracking device under its skin? Former civil servants have a discount for this advanced procedure. As a soldier you fall into that category.”
The lad anxiously glances at Greg and the girl and says something in German. The girl answers in a soothing tones, lowers the window frame and gestures for Greg to follow. She leads him one flight down and leaves him before a half-open door. She motions him to enter, but walks past the door herself.
A strained chuckle comes from the other side of the bedroom. Then the door creaks and John is alone.
“Unlikely,” Sherlock snaps, but then he starts giggling. Soft, happy chuckles that emerge when adrenalin makes you dizzy and the bloodstream is full of endorphins.
On the fourth day, after a disgusting prison lunch, he is ordered out of the cell and led under guard, most probably, to his stationary placement. Where is he being sent then, Sherlock wonders. Municipal slave... perhaps into cleaning services? That could prove beneficial, more opportunities. It would be amusing to fall pray to the shortage at the Yard... But no, even if Lestrade had applied for him, the application would hardly be approved, since all Sherlock's achievements are now regarded as fake. Perhaps somebody has bought him?
“What do you think?” Mycroft sighs. “About freedom from society. About being finally able to shrug off all public sensibilities. Sherlock has always tried to put Watson between himself and all the other people, and now it has happened almost without him lifting a finger to make it happen. I think he might already have learned to appreciate the situation and will hardly put an effort into breaking down these particular walls.”
“Don't talk like that, Mr Holmes!” Greg shakes his head. “He's your brother, family. I'm sure even he understands that.”
And it's all truth, of course: Sherlock did tell him that Dr Desai was his type and said she was unhappy. And John did contemplate giving her flowers, but the words are coming out his mouth  by themselves and he's experiencing blind panic – what's happening? Is he actually losing himself? Are these false memories? Or is this how the fucking drug is playing with his brains?..
At that moment Sherlock's hands are wrenched behind his back by the hospital security someone summoned. Or well, to be more precise, an attempt is made at wrenching: Sherlock stands quietly and doesn't resist, which kind of takes the wind out of all the initial aggression.
Once she's finished, Sherlock turns to her (thank God the sedative hasn't affected his tongue much).
John didn't even have a heart to admonish him about crumbs like his mum did with him and Harry when they were kids. Only chuckled quietly and resolved to buy more sweets in the future. John has never had a sweet tooth, not even as a child, that's why he forgets. Sherlock, naturally, doesn't remind him of such common substances and rarely goes to the grocers himself. And in his current situation he can't go to a restaurant and order a double dessert for himself either. Not quite a hardship, but one more nuisance nonetheless.
“Not actually that rare for an ex-military. Especially if you take into account the repressed homosexual tendencies...” a third voice adds. Or should he call it the first voice? The four-eyed interrogator.
The next time Sherlock wakes in the middle of the night from a nightmare, he finally deigns to admit that something is wrong.
“It's about you too!” Sherlock says with passion. “Stop doubting me. All of this -” he slightly touches the traces of the collar on his neck. “- means nothing. We agreed on the very first day that we won't let it come between us. And what do I see now? You're still thinking in old paradigms. That's where your true hypocrisy lies! If not for this minor inconvenience, what would you-”
“John.” There are warm hands are on John’s shoulders, Sherlock’s lips touching his ear. When did he rise from the armchair? John hadn't heard. “Don’t forget: I’m a genius and you are rather good at everything else. If anyone can do it, it's us.”
A quick response time in a critical situation and a good tactical thinking – it was just like John: boring and tedious in a daily routine, utterly destructive in battle. It must have been imperative to draw the money the very same day, and the only time he was allowed to visit Sherlock in prison he hadn't said a word. He'd either suspected their enemies to be listening in (not entirely improbable), or simply hadn't got the time: Sherlock had practically buried him with various instructions. At that point he hadn't yet lost hope of uncovering whose strings Moriarty had been pulling in the government to take down Mycroft at the same time with his arrest.
To top off the night, the weather had taken a turn and he found himself in a simple overcoat, ill prepared for the rain and bone-numbing chill of a London night.
Certainly, Gregory thought to himself, a detective would pay for this bums travel fare. That seemed as believable as the Queen emerging from the fog next.
The voice of the approaching man carried through the fog, chatting with the driver about the many injustices he had faced this night, and how fortunate he was to find a coach at this hour.
John shook his head crossly, as if clearing the clouds from his mind. Such folly. He was no young boy, staring star struck at the tall shadow of an imposing general standing in his parent's entryway. He was a grown man, a veteran of wars, a hero according to some.
“Sherlock dear,” the old lady starts, then purses her lips and runs her troubled eyes over his bruises (including the ones hidden under his shirt – Sherlock's always been astonished by her keen insight that doesn't seem to be a result of intellect nor even life experience). “I understand, dear, I do. I know it's some kind of a plan of yours that you are moving out and everything... But tell me honestly, are the two of you really... okay?”
“You... can help me?” Sherlock asks, trying to make his voice waver in the right way instead of snickering acidly. “But how?”
The bed coverlet is snowy white, the cushions wine red – that and all of the décor somehow evoked an uneasy feeling in Gregory Lestrade. Or perhaps it was just that he hasn't been able to have a proper shuteye for the last two days, or maybe it’s the time difference... Damned Holmes! No, damn the both Holmeses! Greg knew how to handle himself in dangerous situations, but he wasn't a damn adrenaline junky like John either, so all these spy games, all those MIs – whatever their numbers -, all of it was simply too much for him.
“For some reason you are harbouring a delusion that I'm careless with my health. You're wrong. I take care of my body as is needed.” He snorts. “How I sometimes wish I were a bodiless spirit. My body’s so tired, though the brain's working as usual. Damn transport!” Sherlock exclaims and slams his right fist into his left forearm.
Suddenly Sherlock feels an icy stab in his solar plexus. For a second he can't even recall how to breathe.
“For not... not doubting me when I turned up there, with a collar in my hand,” John says finally. “It's just that when you fell on your knees, you had such an expression on your face that I... Well. It scared me. Doesn't matter...” The mug is almost banged down in front of Sherlock. “Drink your coffee.”
“No, stop.” John feels himself go numb, rubs his forehead. “Stop. You’re talking rubbish. First, why the hell would you even need to seem like an abused slave, and second... Why do you need to do it inside the flat? Why the things... the talk about the cot near the door? You weren't joking, were you?”
At length the dentist studies his teeth, frowns, then gives her opinion, “Number six is chipped; easy to fix. Seven is salvageable, I think; oral cavity is fine, but you need an X-ray. Can you pay?”
“I'm confused.“ Greg rubs his head. “I'm sorry, Mr Holmes, I'm getting too old for all this new nonsense. Access and passwords... What is this... device? Some kind of adding machine?”
Pound can't hit him without John's permission. Corporal punishment of another's slave is the strictest taboo of society. Sherlock almost wishes that Pound wouldn't hold back.
Sherlock doesn't stop to admire his accuracy; he grabs John by the shoulders, turns him around and growls into his face, “Stop that!”
Nothing, that's what. Because even Sherlock himself has succumbed to stress apparently; namely his instant capitulation before John's refusal to hit him. Astonishingly Sherlock didn't even try to persuade John. Instead he promptly offered a compromise, and it's only because he remembered the expression John had on his face when The Golden Ram owner was opening the slave cage. Like a coward, Sherlock preferred to avoid the repeat experience. The archaeological holidays in Devon will indeed benefit them both.
Sherlock has such a permit for Greater London, so John isn't too worried, until... until, while sipping a beer and watching the closing credits for another rerun episode of Doctor Who (The Ninth and Rosa have successfully exposed a man who invented tiny short-wave telephones and used it as an excuse to place a net of satellite transmitters around the planet to control the population) he realises that it's almost midnight. And still no Sherlock.
“Please, Mrs Hudson,” he responds as gently as he can allow himself, “How could we possibly forget about our not-a-housekeeper? And her special recipe tarts?”
Before, in this kind of situation John would have given Sherlock hell about the dishes. At least half of the mountain had appeared as a result of Sherlock's tests on mould samples, so
“On your knees,” she says quickly and his knees obediently hit the floor before he figures out what to do.
“Exactly,” Sherlock utters almost softly. “You're working tomorrow and we are going to A&E. After that – The Golden Ram, where you'll have a pint or two. And then a couple of other places. It's for a case.”
“It was the safest way.” Sherlock’s tone is flat. “Winston has almost unlimited resources and his intelligence is almost equal to mine. Or Mycroft’s. Otherwise he’d never have got us. The only advantage I had was because of his biased understanding of a slave automatically being powerless and harmless to him. Besides, Winston can’t stand Mycroft, and his dearest wish is to see me broken and lost; that is why he gave Moriarty the idea of forcing me into slavery.”
I have already shared my view on the enormous amount of work done by the London Movement and Abolitionists of Britain (check A. M. Morstan,
“Holmes.” He jerks his head - 'no'. “Irrelevant. So who got lucky with their master and why don't you want to talk about it? Come on, I hope it's at least mildly entertaining.”
If he answers a question, the pain will stop. The tentacles will go away. But then the body ocean will close its icy waves above him and suffocate him.
Sherlock kisses him. It's only a peck, but it still goes through John like a powerful blast after which there can only be silence.
John can hear a sincere amazement in her voice. Strange. He was sure the whole hospital knew. On the other hand, when asked, he always teld them that the J. Watson writing in The Strand is merely a namesake. Perhaps they believed him?
“I don't,” John replies, all but shouting at her 'Where is he?!' His heart rate is working overtime, trying to break out if his chest. “He's my sister's. She's asked me to... look after him.”
“Where did you get this?” Dr Desai asks without any preamble, deliberately glancing at the letter in his hand.
Inspector Lestrade isn't having a pleasant day: a nasty murder, an obvious dead end and then the boss sicks a (mostly) paperwork-related inspection on him. In the afternoon there's some improvement: first, he receives the lab result for another nasty case and with clear conscience he sends Donovan to conduct the arrest (she's been eager to do that since forever), then he loses a battle with his conscience and decides to skip the half-hour nap in his armchair in favour of tackling his quarterly report.
It isn't difficult to slip off John's radar while he's talking to Mycroft's doctor, nor is sneaking into his brother's room. It's a high-class institution with attentive staff, but the soft carpet muffles his steps and even the most competent nurse needs to leave their post some time.
Turning his face towards the windy sky Sherlock grimly thinks it's a shame that Pound had managed to hold back. If he hadn't, Sherlock would have...
“This farce will have to go on, of course. We stay at this bloody modern monstrosity of the apartment and keep a low profile. Probably for some time.” Sherlock tone is fast, but measured, and John is not fooled for a second about his deliberate show of tranquility. “I don’t think Mycroft’s return to the political scene can be fast, especially considering that most likely he will soon be declared dead. But there’s no chance in hell he will leave it like this. It might come to the two of us having to cooperate.”
Sherlock raises his eyes from his newspaper he's been glued to since stepping into the flat, and wipes his face of any expression.
“Neither. It’s just that recently we’ve had so little time to spend together that I thought I’d manage to mix some work with my pleasure,” Morstan answered in the same vein.
“You were looking at my collar with almost painful interest, which I must confess you hid very well. Not well-enough for an experienced observer, though. You probably don't have much contact with personal slaves, as you don't get them as clients very often, but your interest is clearly a bit more than idle curiosity. You obviously realised that my slave status is a recent development and it's made you deeply sympathetic. One of your closest has undergone a similar experience. A fiancé, or more probably a sibling. It happened a while ago and you've lost all contact with them and know nothing about their fate. But the feeling of guilt hasn't abandoned you and you continue seeing them in every slave you meet.
John nods, biting his inner cheek, Sherlock is silent and looks down, glancing up and away from time to time, to make it more realistic. Fresh bruises are blooming on his neck: some of them are a result of creative provocation in bed (Sherlock had to hold back from giving John corresponding marks – although they are lucky in John having somewhat less delicate skin), and some come from various experiments with his collar and other household tools at hand.
The waiter welcoming them at the entrance opens the cage and closes it after Sherlock. Stepping over the threshold, John hears the friendly greeting of the chilled girl.
My special thanks go to Charlotte who beta-read the chapter and made it readable. All the remaining mistakes are mine.
The freezing cold of deep space, the icy chills of a new-found awareness paralyses his body; a queasy feeling is pulling at him with a hellish force, pulling him down towards mere mortals. Frantic, nervous energy pierces his body like a lightning. Mistakes happen. Even geniuses make them, but realising them gives you an opportunity to rectify them.
John grabs the animal under its belly and turns towards the stairs with intention to return the cat to its owner. And there it is: his note is lying on the floor, John just didn't noticed it in his hurry.
“I don't understand what you're talking about,” the woman replied firmly. “Slavery is the basis of the British economy.”
Sherlock's nose and cheeks are still reddened from the cold. And his fingers. For some reason he’d dashed out without his gloves; maybe because he’d wanted to seem downright pitiful. Nevertheless, how you appear to people is one thing, but hypothermia, quite a real thing, is another. Of course, forty minutes in the London cold are not going to kill a healthy adult, but the shame and guilt for his own little grievances John suddenly feels is intense.
“It's more than a partnership now,” Sherlock states, because it's the truth. “Now our union has become a vital necessity, and not only for me. Modern society's hypocrisy is becoming less and less bearable to you.”
She sighs. “My father was a dentist and wanted for me to get my education in the former metropolis, so we could expand our business. He'd had a sizeable inheritance, but by the beginning of the nineties the business had diminished. Still he managed to send me to live with my uncle in Great Britain. It was only later that I found out he...” She falters.
“Well,” John offers with feigned indifference, “it depends on what kind of bruises you need. Or scratches.”
He returns to the Yard, where a young lad, who seems vaguely familiar (and going by the way he's overcompensating on friendliness, the lad has the same feeling about John), tells him that Lestrade is on vacation, has been for two days, and it’s absolutely impossible to get in touch with him. This is a dead-end: John has no interest in talking to any of Lestrade's team since they were the ones that so unanimously sent Sherlock to the block.
'Cognitive faculties?' Panic, a thousand times stronger than the previous, hits him with its multi-ton hammer. 'Will it turn me into a retard?'
No longer paying Sherlock any attention, she glances at the readings on the machines and copies them onto the chart. Then she starts checking the equipment, wiping it clean, changing the air tubes... That's how John finds them: Sherlock in the corner on his knees, the nurse fixing a plastic bag of parenteral nutrition to an IV stand.
The incident was a simple one and in Sherlock's opinion not worth thinking of, but when they reach their Baker Street home, John explodes. He's pacing the room, taking turns to rub his temples and clench his fists.
Automatically, a trained response. With a grim satisfaction he tells himself that his body is once more obedient, that the tension of the past several days, when he was close to a breakdown, has almost entirely disappeared.
The X-ray is done by the blonde nurse, not Russian after all he decides, but still from somewhere in the USSR. Perhaps Yugoslavia. Married, two children, husband works in construction. Clothing and make-up are very cheap - from sales in the supermarket; all for the sake of her children. Definitely not an abolitionist – she avoids looking at his collar (and Sherlock himself) as much as she can.
A helpful, although very obviously hurrying to finish up her shift, woman explained to him that his slave was caught while trying to board a passenger ship to France without a ticket. Since the slave refused to identify himself, the standard protocol was engaged – they checked the tattoo and found the owner in the record system. The missing slave form had already arrived in the morning, that's why everything happened so quickly, Mr Watson… Medical check-up showed the slave to be in a satisfactory condition, so he could be retrieved within the week in working hours, but Mr Watson should be forewarned that they start counting the cost of the slave's up-keeping from the moment they identify the owner and at the moment it amounts to... Yes, they are open on Saturdays, but only from eight to five and unfortunately they are closed on Sunday... He can either bring them the ownership certificate himself, along with his passport and the fine for his slave having been caught without a collar, or mail them the request for having his slave sent up to their London division. After receiving the request with the prepaid check for the fine and the slave's up-keep we will send the delivery within three weekdays. Though you should also let us know over the phone, I can make a note right now if... You'll come yourself? Very well, Mr Watson, we will be expecting you...
One more dim corridor (Sherlock remembers the layout of the building perfectly well, but what's the use – he won't be escaping), one more anteroom, this time somewhat more civilised. It reveals an unfamiliar official in a brown woollen suit, plump and seemingly good-natured,  – and John. He'd grown rather haggard in three days as if he were the one forced to eat prison gruel and stay up at nights to keep all his bits intact.
The hotel itself also vaguely reminds him of pictures from a fairytale book by H. C. Andersen. There are antique armchairs in the oblong lobby and a porter (a bespectacled old woman writing up the guests into a ledger) is knitting in a dim light of a floor lamp.
John expects Dr Rohan Desai to be a proud-looking Indian with an aquiline profile. The name Rohan somehow leads him to think about ferocious horsemen and archers. Instead, he gets a short, curvaceous woman, not especially dark and not very obviously Indian even. Seeing the letter in his hand, she pales even more, bites out, 'Come with me,' and leads him into a smallish room, which is apparently a cross between a kitchen (there's an electric stove and a loudly humming refrigerator) and a tech support station.
Sherlock's not too worried when John is silent; in some ways it is even more comfortable. He'd just prefer not to deal with the aftermath of a heart attack if it's avoidable.
There are no cases. Absolutely none. No calls from Scotland Yard, no letters nor telegrams from private clients. Or well... There are some letters and telegrams, but none of them request their help. Mostly they are complaints, mostly addressed to John, and from the readers of The Strand Daily and fans of his
“I'm a dwarf now, am I? And the girly locks – is that a family trait too? You spend more time on spraying your hair in the morning than I brushing my teeth!”
He's even thinner now. There's a bruise on his cheekbone and a dark line visible under his loose collar (seems to have been put on too tight at some point and then left on for too long), the bags under his eyes from the lack of sleep are blue and the pale, feverish skin doesn't add him any beauty either.
It is very difficult to argue that everything was exactly as written: all memoirs and autobiographical works are subjective by definition. However, through all the years (and there have been many) I knew Holmes and Watson, they proved time and again that absolute honesty is at the core of their characters. If a detail in their published autobiographies is imprecise, then it is only because of the need to protect the persons involved or (more often than you’d think) to protect the state. I am convinced that the spirit of what they have written is the truth. Even now, every time I reread ‘The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes’ I feel like my dear Uncle John is actually speaking to me, and the dry, darker shade of humour seen in Holmes’s short autobiography brings his manner of speaking to the forefront of my mind. I have absolutely no doubt that neither of them would knowingly sin against the truth.
John closes his eyes. The icy nausea is receding; the walls of the sanctuary were shaken, but they still stand. How long until they crumble?
John had no intention of eating them; he doesn't like sweets, especially the cloying variety. Decided to let Sherlock have them. The detective perked right up, but did his best to hide it: after returning from making bets at the racecourse once again, (also from, as he so vaguely put it, 'meeting his contacts',) he snorted happily and having grabbed the pastries rolled straight into bed to watch TV.
Strictly speaking, the law doesn't forbid slaves roaming wherever at what ever hours if they have their owner's permission, but in practice it's a covert curfew: if a slave appears somewhere after dark they have to have a notarized permit from their master for freedom of movement in a certain area.
“Irrelevant.” Sherlock waves his hand. A thousand thoughts are rushing through his head, thousands of scenarios, thousands of women with a million dazzling smiles, tens thousands of hands, billions of words – said and unsaid – in tens of alternative universes. “I find our circumstances just as distasteful as you do, although I still find myself indifferent to the lives of strangers. However (and I don't want you to take this the wrong way), the idea of you being unable to do anything else but accept me in your life sounds rather appealing.”
“What?” At first John doesn’t even get what Sherlock is talking about. “Don’t be an idiot. You haven’t slept in fuck knows how long and I had a shut-eye on the train. I’ll keep watch - in this same bloody chair.”
Sherlock has – the door is wide open, the note missing. With his friend's name on the lips John bursts into the living room... only to find a grey cat on their bed, obviously well-fed and his coat shiny. John knows the cat: it belongs to their neighbour and despite home-breeding and a certified pedigree has an arrogance of a stray and an almost canine ability to open doors.
Among other things he visits the library, makes a couple of inquiries via phone, sends two international letters and one telegram. At least at the post office no one pays him any attention: it's quite common for slaves to send letters for their masters. They even have a separate 'slave window' so that they don't have to queue with their betters. Sherlock remembers that the slave queue sometimes moves even faster during the rush hour, because personal slaves mostly belong to influential people and therefore it might be potentially dangerous to keep them waiting. At this moment, though, it is of no consequence since the post office is empty.
“Temporary. You guard your doctor from knowing about your most dangerous operations too, do you not?” Sherlock states. “Although she's informed in general.”
‘What? A body!?’ If John would have any strength left he wouldn't waste it on screaming. He'd leap up from the floor and go straight for the jugular of that... the one with the cane. But there's not even strength for a whisper.
“And look what a fine job you've done,” she snickers. “They found him, uncollared, in a somewhat  shady situation, I was told. I have a number for you to call back from eight-thirty to six.”
The last thing Sherlock remembers is John whispering “vile thing” while unbuckling his collar, and forcefully throwing it aside. Lying down is a lot more comfortable after that, and not only because noting prevents his head from falling on the pillow.
‘Yet, it’s still on me. In my mind,’ Sherlock thinks, resigned. It’s a close thing; he almost repeats John’s gesture.
Sluggishly, John tries to remember if he has to be at work today. Theoretically everything is clear: Sherlock went missing on Thursday evening, he’s supposed to be free on Friday and most of the Saturday, Saturday evening to Sunday he's on duty. The rest of the Sunday, he probably has off... But John has no idea what day it is. Seems to be Friday evening, but who knows, it could be Saturday.
John knows that he's overreacting and that it will pass. During their walk home John mentally takes apart and puts together a Browning once and a Sig Sauer twice. It helps.
“The second manoeuvre was necessary for you and Lestrade to be released as soon as possible. I made sure that suspicion in kidnapping Mycroft from the hospital would fall on alternative parties who are also interested in gaining access to the database: military intelligence. There was this man, Lawrence Tucker. He worked for the military and the abolitionists both. The first he provided with intelligence and from the second got their discarded weapons. On the side, he also ran some errands for Winston.”
“Sherlock. Would you stop taking me for a bloody fool? What the hell are you trying to do? Why the falling down the stairs? The demonstrative sitting in a cage? And the A&E visit...” Suddenly it dawns on him. “You did that in A&E too! Made a spectacle of yourself, acted all slave-like? And you sent me away, so I wouldn't see! Did you humiliate yourself in front of them? The vitamins... Something even worse must have happened there or you wouldn't have told me about them, would you?” At this point John finally pieces it all together. “God, you're acting up on purpose, aren't you! For some damn reason you want to be seen as a real slave, and not just a slave, but a slave who's being abused by his master! Beats you, humiliates... That's why you've removed all your stuff from the living room. Am I right?”
Later that evening Sherlock sends his tactful correspondent a reply, informing her that her neighbour is keeping parrots, including specimens illegally imported from countries of South American Protectorate, thus hiding his passion. Now apparently, the geography of his illegal refugee saving exploits has spread, and Mr N has received a talking mynah from the Soviet Far East, which he'd been desperately trying to exchange for the birds in his collection for quite a long while.
“And the rest of it? How...? I…” John thinks it through and then spits it out, “I don’t remember much of what happened, but what I bloody well do remember is that apparently I did behave as a ‘maniac with a fixation on Holmes’ as that - what’s-his-name - Winston put it. I thought about it on the train - if it wasn’t hypnosis, then what was it?”
“A few.” John nods, biting the skin that just happens to be on a neck within his reach. Then he grabs Sherlock's wrists and twists them roughly over the other man's head. ”Any objections?”
“You'll be useless in this state anyway. Better call in sick. Or I can. You've got a good reputation there; they won't think any worse of you, if that's what you are worried about.”
In the end John Watson makes it home. It's not easy: East End is an area of business, very active. A well-dressed man sitting on a sidewalk with a blank face is discovered almost momentarily; they want to call an ambulance.
John  shakes his head, realises that he doesn't need the Underground, and sits on the wrong bus - he almost makes it all the way to Baker Street. It's only one incident though and he barely loses half an hour over it. Still, on the whole, the fog is starting to fade. When he reaches the flat, it's not yet all clear, but gradually his brain is starting to come online.
Almost unnoticed by the sparse morning crowd Sherlock manages to guide John into the public toilets.
John doesn't notice when, but somehow Sherlock has already reached the bathroom, taken the pills out of the cupboard and is now handing them to John along with a glass of water. Mechanically, John swallows them, walks to the bedroom (Sherlock's), and only when dragging the unusually cool blanket over his head does he realise that although The Golden Ram is not an upper-class pub, it's still far from ordinary: slave owners bring their slaves there, but they're not allowed in. Is Sherlock planning on wearing a disguise?
“Relax, Mr Lestrade,” says a voice in a perfect London accent with a slight Welsh lilt and a familiar professional air of somebody on the field of law enforcement. “If you cooperate, you'll come out of it unscratched and in one piece. I'll give you a second to think of your daughters... Done?”
“No, leave it. I've always liked it,” John replies and goes to make himself a cuppa. “Let's not overdo it. Otherwise we might as well move my stuff into your bedroom and leave you on a cot near the door.”
“He's mine!” John screams, trying to break the handcuffs, the bonds; alas, they hold. “He's mine, do you hear me? You can't touch him! He didn't do it! He's my slave! A slave! He couldn't have done anything! Let me go, I have to find him! You bloody bastards! Damn arseholes! Leave him alone!”
An hour later, when John returns from his walk with nicotine patches, a bottle of paracetamol and an anti-inflammatory ointment (a minimal set necessary in case Sherlock's thinking becomes so intense that any cohabitation in the flat automatically becomes an irritant), the living room is utterly silent.
Since the door lacks the sign of the crossed out collar, Sherlock enters – and instead of finding himself in the lobby with a reception table, he appears to have stepped into a rather cosy room with a small table holding a Russian samovar. Sitting at the table are three women: one obviously from India (the owner) in a blue medical gown, one from Eastern Europe somewhere (probably the owner of the samovar), wearing a white gown over a blouse and a skirt, and one in ordinary clothing (salesperson, selling cosmetics). The tea is drunk from Arabic bowls.
Sherlock waits until the pot is on the stove, and asks, “How did you manage to pay for a slave? My accounts are frozen.”
He bumps into Mrs Hudson half-way down. Apparently she is coming up: dressed with caution, as if for a serious talk. Why? What about? Everything important has already been said. Sentiments again, no doubt.
This is where John breaks down. He moans and almost cries, “Me! It was all me...” He wants to say that he hadn't wanted to, that Sherlock had asked him to, that he's not some kind of a sadist, for God's sake, but somehow, almost against his will, it gets out a bit differently, “He asked... I did it for him! He was bloody... gagging for it!” Then John remembers how Sherlock fell down the stairs, but manages to hold his tongue: a vague sense of Sherlock preferring them not to know is somewhere at the back of his head. John doesn't remember why, but that's somehow less important.
The girl is new, Sherlock doesn't remember her from his previous visits. She's appraising him – probably evaluating his coat and trying to determine if he could be the property of some business partner or potential client. Her doubts are resolved quickly and unequivocally: Mr Pound himself jumps out of his office, in a white robe and with a surgical mask crumpled under his chin.
“Don't!” John shouts, darting after Sherlock. Too late -  his fingers close only a tenth of an inch above Sherlock's shoulder as he tumbles towards the ground floor. John can only watch helplessly as his friend and partner somersaults down, his arms protecting his head.
“That the son of a bitch is manipulating me.” Greg lets out a string swear words. “That he's forcing me to break a law to organise his escape. That he wants me to do his dirty work for him.”
“I don't understand...” Greg mutters. “But you were... in a regular clinic. A private one, yes, but still, just a hospital. I heard that John... John Watson visited you regularly. And well... The newspapers wrote about it.”
Sherlock hates losing. The limp body of his prostrate brother under the sheets is the silent testament to his defeat. Back at the beginning, during the ongoing process when there still was a chance to fix everything, he kept looking for the connection between Moriarty and someone form the government. It would have been that much easier if he'd just admitted that Jim, despite all his flair, was not a player, but a pawn on the board. It wasn't Mycroft falling along side Sherlock, but Sherlock himself used as a distracting manoeuvre to once and for all get rid of the elder Holmes.
“Got lucky with the master?” Her dark chocolate eyes under thinly plucked brows watch him cautiously, carefully.
“Fuck, Sherlock! You sodding cocky bastard! Everything, fucking everything, revolves around you, how could it not? Oh, my fucking God, he's become a slave! The whole bloody world is standing on its head! Do you even understand what it cost me?! Do you even get how it feels – to walk the streets and know that you are somewhere behind me, and that every bloody kid can spit on you for no sodding reason, just like that, for fun? Do you have any idea how people at work look at me now?! Oh, he's bought his best friend for a slave, interesting, what for? Oh you know, a confirmed bachelor that Dr Watson, isn't he? Yes, yes, that's what I thought! Sherlock, you bugger, I had to change the clinics! You think that was easy? There's an economical crisis going on, if you'd care to look around you! And now with that bloody loan, you have any idea how much crap I had to take before Harry even agreed to help us? Did it even occur to you?! No, of course not! What am I thinking? Not when the great Sherlock Holmes is bloody immersed in his bitter bloody brooding!”
She's rather tall, nice-looking, but with a double chin – in short: not a pleasure slave. The tattooed cheek doesn't add to her attractiveness either. It is obvious that she's been waiting for a while and that the shapeless coat, warm gloves and even the scarf tied on top of the collar (against The Dress Code Regulation) don’t seem to be helping any more.
Right now though, Sherlock's irregular behaviour is more or less understandable: he always behaves strangely after visiting Mycroft. John wouldn't make them go if he didn't know that no one else visits the elder Holmes. No one at all. And it's weird if no one visits you; John wouldn't want to be in his position.
For a moment John even has this batty idea that Stacy must be the purpose of their outing. But what kind of interest could a young female slave be to Sherlock? Perhaps it’s her owner?
