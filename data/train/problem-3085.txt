She’d agreed to leave with him after her shift, the product of some well-timed winks and flirty one-liners on his part. Dean had planned to wait until they slipped somewhere private to make sure that his hunch was right. She’d tried to kiss him as soon as they’d made it five steps from the bar. Man, that had been a close one.
“‘S fine, buddy,” Dean said quickly. He pulled his eyes away from Cas so that he could watch the road as he backed out of the parking lot. “I should’a let you know what I was doing.”
The only thing visible in Dean’s eyes was the blatant way that he blinked them closed to avoid Cas’s gaze. He turned his head back to the barista.
Dean tried to take a deep breath. He let his head fall back, watched the ceiling fan spin, and dropped to sit on the now-empty side of the bed. He tried again to take a calming, deep breath. Damnit, that meditation crap Sammy was always on about never worked when it needed to.
In the morning, once the sun had risen and the snow had become nothing but icy brown patches at the edges of the road, they wouldn’t talk about this. Dean would put on the same leather jacket and lace up the same heavy boots, and maybe he’d have to look away from water on the floor if snow had melted off of them, but they wouldn’t talk about it. They would never bring it up. Cas would sit even farther to the edge of his seat in the Impala. Dean would pointedly avoid his gaze for days.
The clouds above rumbled and shook, as if they were plotting, murmuring. The strong wind that was their motor spiraled downwards, shaking around Castiel and sending dust and water droplets spinning through the air.
Everything. Castiel would give everything he had left to save Dean. No matter what it took.  He pulled his soaked dress shirt sleeves up to his elbows, and rubbed his hands together to generate some heat, to awaken his strength. He closed his eyes to search inside of himself, to call for all that he had. To tell himself to use everything that was still at his disposal, no matter how badly he needed it to keep himself alive. Dean needed it more.
She shifted back away from him, beginning to turn around. Cas withdrew his coat, and said, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you.”
They stepped apart, parted, and a chasm opened between them. Dean clasped his hands together, to keep them to himself, but it wasn’t necessary, because suddenly he couldn’t imagine ever being able to so much as to touch Cas’s hand while passing him a mug of coffee, or while righting his upside-down FBI badge.
They really shouldn’t have been standing so close together. Dean had hardly noticed taking the steps away from the bed to arrive in front of Cas. Now, their faces were close enough together that Dean’s shallow breaths rippled the fabric cascading over Castiel’s face.
If they noticed the difference in Sam’s behavior, they didn’t mention it. But any little help that Sam could give in their star-crossed love, he gave gratefully. It wasn’t often that one got the chance to help bring together two people who meant as much to each other as Dean and Cas did.
A girl had gone missing. Cas knew from the picture of her face, the one from the website that Dean had printed off. He hadn’t seen the picture because of any desire on Dean’s part to show him; no, the only time Cas had gotten to look at it had been a quick glance as Dean had folded it up and slid it into his wallet.
Cas’s hand brought him back, straightened him up, but didn’t leave its place. Dean ghosted his finger over his own cheek, not quite wiping the snowflakes away, just feeling the wetness that they had left. Cold and fresh and alive.
“I’m going to find a way to bring you back, Cas,” Dean said, to Castiel, who may or may not have been able to hear him through his own stolen thoughts, or to the darkening world around them, or just to himself. “You’ve just got to hold on until I do.”
Not actually nothing, of course: Cas’s room looked exactly like every other uninhabited room in the bunker, but that was what Sam always found so strange; Cas’s bed sheets were never rustled, his shelves never crowded with any sort of objects. The chair was still overturned as it had been for storage, and the lamp remained unplugged — everything about Castiel’s room felt vacant. No wonder he hardly spent any time in there.
“Because it is,” Cas said, voice breaking. He really was trying to make this their goodbye, the selfish bastard.
“I love you,” Cas continued, and Dean’s heart stopped. He shook his head to one side. He must have heard wrong, because this- this was not how it ended. He and Cas, this was not how they ended, some half-completed thing, unreciprocated. Dean’s mouth wouldn’t work, he couldn’t think, couldn’t get his lips to make the words that would return Cas’s confession. But he wanted to. In a different moment, Dean would have been able to. This wasn’t how they were supposed to end.
Dean sputtered, a hundred different explanations trying to rush from his mouth. “The barista was a shifter! I didn’t want to tip her off to us, that’s why we weren’t talking ‘bout the case. I was working her, Cas, I swear. It wasn’t about you.”
Dean pointedly lifted the half-full bottle to his lips and took a long sip. When Sam didn’t leave, and only stared at him harder, Dean groaned, “I’ll think about it.”
Cas stood in the doorway, lit from behind. His head was tilted to the side in an expression that Dean had learned to read as ‘fondly disappointed.’
Cas flipped his middle finger up over his shoulder, his black gloves nearly blending into the skyline. Dean sighed, pulled the ring box from his pocket, and flicked it open. Lisa’s ring, that Cas had been holding onto; its white stone shone a buttery yellow in the sharp morning light. Dean slipped it into a different, deeper pocket. He rubbed his bare hands together, trying to warm them, and watched his breaths form small clouds. When his watch read 7:30, he returned to his car.
“Cas,” Dean said, hovering the thing he’d gotten from the store up towards their faces. “You remember where we’re goin’, right?”
“I said no more shots. The rest is up to you.” She winked over her shoulder as she turned to get a drink for someone else.
He fell quite squarely onto the hard ground, the jolt shaking up to his injured shoulder and his pounding head. He was almost grateful when his skull hit back against the floor, if only to let him rest for a moment. Something felt off, however. The ground under his head was… softer, somehow, than what the rest of him had landed on.
“Oh,” the woman said, leaning one dainty wrist against the elevator handrail. “The guest list specified that we were waiting for two gentlemen. I assumed, from the way you were standing, that you were the couple on the list.”
“What do you want me to say here, man?” Dean’s throat had been tight since he’d woken up, like something was stuck right where he was supposed to be able to swallow. He ghosted his fingers over the tight spot, trying to relax it away. A wall of light blue passed by outside the window—the bridesmaids, in their dresses. Somewhere, Lisa was getting ready, getting ready to marry him.
A strong hand caught him around his shoulder, pulling him back to sitting. A second hand clasped underneath his chin, tilting his face up. Dean did not worry. He found he trusted the hands that held him.
But Castiel was getting ahead of himself. The cliff under his fingertips grew slicker as the salt-bitten rain came again and again against it. Castiel’s fingers, numb from the cold and bleeding from the rough rocks, slipped out of a hold, causing the shoulder of the hand that had remained in place to crash into the cliff side. With no coat to soften the blow, the rock scratched mercilessly into Castiel’s arm, cutting into him from the top of his shoulder to his elbow. He hissed out a breath between his teeth.
With one last shake, Castiel let the coat go. The tan trench coat, which Dean had saved for him and kept in the Impala after Cas had died, which had belonged to Jimmy Novak, who had given up everything for Castiel to have an earthly body, fell into the abyss. It billowed as it caught in the wind, and for a moment, it appeared to float back upwards. The return was short lived: the soaked coat dropped away, and sank steadily towards the ocean, seemingly untouched by the swirling wind. It became nothing but a blot of light in the darkness, and then, as it dipped against the ocean, it became tinier and tinier as it sank below the freezing water.
In the Impala, with everyone settled and ready to commence the final portion of their drive, Dean brought their attention back to the ice cream bars that he’d “stolen” on behalf of Castiel.
“I’m going to keep looking until I do, Cas. I promise. This is my fault and my failure, and I will keep lookin’ until I figure out how to bring you back. Don’t give up, okay Cas? You’ll see that stupid plant again yourself.” He managed to smile against his knuckles. “Alright, that’s all for now. Over and out, buddy.”
Castiel’s mouth opened as if he was going to reply. His head shook just slightly back and forth. The sun’s first rays split through the trees, catching like sparks in the tips of Cas’s unruly dark hair. Finally, Castiel’s hand flew to his pocket. He pulled out a small black box, shoved it into the breast pocket of Dean’s coat, then turned on his heels and began to retreat through the cemetery.
"Ever since the mark made Cas go crazy, ever since I had to bury him in a Ma'lak box." (Chuck's alternate ending, 15x09. Includes some SPOILERS.)
He came across a piece of information rather quickly, and without thinking, read it out loud. In the empty bunker, only Sam’s own voice reflected back to him. He rolled his eyes at himself before flicking his phone from his pocket and texting the tip to Cas. He didn’t want to encourage Dean’s habit of texting and driving.
Hungry lips pressed to Dean’s and the weight against his chest—Cas’s arm—held him back tighter. Dean opened his mouth up to the embrace, otherwise unmoving, letting Castiel take what he wanted. When Castiel’s hand finally released him from the wall, moving up to wind its way into his hair instead, Dean wrapped his arms tightly around Castiel’s shoulders. He wasn’t looking for anything, wasn't asking for anything. He just wanted to feel the angel against him, solid and alive.
And rightfully so, because when he had fallen, it had been straight down onto the unyielding ground.
Cas had been doomed from the moment he’d found Dean in Hell, even if he hadn’t known it then. As if it hadn’t already been reckless enough to fall so hard for a human, he’d just so happened to pick one who apparently had all of his own species neatly in the palm of his hand.
Anger and indignation pulsed to the tips of Sam’s fingers as he pulled the tab of the envelope open. So Cas had been hiding something this whole time… if he was putting Dean in danger by being with him… Sam tipped the envelope over and what seemed like a million hand-written pages fell across the bed, along with a few mismatched pens and pencils. Sam took one of the pages into his hand with enough pressure to crinkle its edges. His eyes scanned madly back and forth, looking for any tell of the type of danger Cas had put them in.
“I have duties to Heaven. If we aren’t working on the case, then I’m wasting my time here with you.”
But at the same time, that didn’t mean that Dean wanted Cas to be gone forever. Dean hadn’t been able to give Cas a reason to stay. That didn’t mean that there wasn’t one. The problem was that, while all of the reasons for Cas’s leaving were easy to list, the reasons why Dean wanted him to stay revolved more around some deep pulling deep inside of him. He didn’t want Cas to go because he just didn’t.
He grunted as he heaved the Ma’lak box from the trailer bed and across the grassy ground, letting its back end drag. If the thing was built to contain something as strong as an archangel, surely it could withstand some rough handling.
As the last of the gold light dissipated into the air, Cas’s hand dropped onto the bed and he let his head fall forwards, recovering. He’d given Dean all that he could manage, and his grace would need a moment to recover. He hoped that Dean’s sleep had become slightly more restful, his dreams just a touch more pleasant.
“Do what you want, man.” Dean tossed the ID to the end of his bed. It got caught in a current of air, and flip-flopped over the bed to land instead on the floor. Sam watched it falling with his lips pursed.
Dean took a bite of the sandwich, chewed, and with his mouth still full, said, “so you’re all healed up, then?”
Cas hugged the metal bucket against his chest and started down along the side of the building. Each room that he passed had its curtains drawn and its lights out. He could sense the souls inside each room, sometimes one, usually two. None as bright nor as strong as Dean’s; none even close.
He ducked his head to read the labels off of a short freezer, charmed by the faded images of rainbow popsicles and ice-cream sandwiches. The cold that came from within the freezer did not pain Castiel, as temperatures hardly affected him. It did, however, send a pleasant tingling sensation across his hands. He picked up a box from within out of the want to continue on with the sensation even after closing the freezer. He held the box lightly, fingers scratching against beads of ice.
Cas used Dean’s spread arms as an opportunity to press their bodies together. Dean quickly reciprocated the hug, pressing the palm of his right hand into the center of Cas’s back.
“You need to lift your hand a little higher, or the ornaments are going to slide off.” Cas used his elbow to lift Dean’s arm to a height at which the ornaments would stay in place. He’d used his elbow as his hands were busing untangling a twisted string of lights.
They stopped beside a potted tree, the young plant only about three feet tall. The needles, beginning green closest to the stem, were faded to a dull brown at their tips. Castiel let his fingers fall to touch the tree, and the green slowly seeped up to cover all of each needle. Dean moved in beside him, their arms touching all along one side. He waited, breathing softly, hovering, patience ebbing.
“Are going to go in there, chop some heads off of some vamps, and laugh about it over drinks tonight.”
“Quickly,” Castiel answered. And then, after a moment’s deliberation, “gently.” He stood from the bench, his bound hands held loosely in front of him. Dean averted his gaze. The cemetery, with its greenery and the dark-blue twilight sky above, presented too serene a backdrop to properly suit what they had come to do.
He stumbled into his own room, fell onto his own bed, and turned in one smooth motion to force his fist into the wall above his headboard. The impact of his skin against the wall worked to clear his mind, yet unfortunately, the thoughts that fell away in his new clarity were not the ones that he would have liked to see go.
Dean groaned and waved Sam’s worry away with his hand. He pulled the cereal box back towards him, flipping it around to look at the back. “Hey, did you know they still put jokes on these things? Listen to this-”
By the time Castiel’s fingers felt the top of the cliff face, he had fallen against the rocks many more times. His scratches were bleeding, his white dress shirt soaked in salt water and sticking to his shaking body. The tips of his fingers scratched against the top of the cliff, trying to find a hold to use to pull himself up.
“How did you know it was us?” Dean asked, coming back to himself. He realized he’d been leaning on Cas and quickly pulled himself away. Only the sides of their arms stayed together. If the vampires were onto them already…
Dean bit his lower lip. Having Cas here, in person, slowed his thoughts on the matter. He needed a moment to process. Cas watched him expectantly, his never-blinking gaze not really helping Dean’s thought process.
“I may be biased,” the barista sipped at her drink, eyes trained on Dean’s, “but yeah, I’d say so. Only thing better than the booze in this place is the patrons.”
Castiel jumped to run his hands over where he’d seen terrible thrashes in Dean’s flesh. His fingers were met by healed skin. “How do you feel?”
Dean opened his eyes. The storage room of the bunker still stood around him. The scent of dust and old books still hung in the air. Without lifting himself off of Cas, Dean swung his head around. Where the Empty had opened up, there was now only solid wall.
He reached for his knife once more, this time freeing it from his belt and holding it loosely around in front of him, circling it in his hands. The silver of the blade caught the light like splotches of blood.
Cas’s hands held him steady. “You may feel groggy or tired, but you should try and stop yourself from falling asleep. You are recovering from seeing my true form.”
Dean’s head turned to the side wildly, his closed eyes tightening. He moaned unhappily, his mouth forming a grimace, then he turned around onto his other side. Dean’s hand clutched his blanket tight enough to whiten his knuckles. From the way that his muscles were tensed, he was going to wake even up more tired than he’d been before falling asleep.
Castiel— because of course it was Castiel—stepped up to Dean and waited. He waited with an intense air of importance that wafted across Dean and nearly forced him to flip his attention immediately upwards to Castiel’s watching face. Instead, he managed to drag his eyes up slowly, scanning across the few loose roses Castiel clutched in his hand, the swipe of makeup over one of his eyes, the tight set of his lips.
“Not the Impala. Look again.” Cas guided him back to the window, then left him to walk across the room. A moment later, the buzzing lamp between the beds was clicked off.
“I know I told ya’,” he started again, “that I’d tend to that stupid plant that you keep in your room, but Cas, I… I still haven’t been able to go in there. I’m pretty sure that Sammy is looking after it. He’s not the type of guy to let a plant die. I’m… I’ll keep trying.” Each day, Dean thought of cracking open the door to Castiel’s room, and each day his hand became pins-and-needles at the thought. He didn’t know what he’d do after opening the door and seeing the dark, empty space. He was sure he didn’t want to know.
There is one other thing that I’ve been devoting a significant amount of thinking to. This one was in the back of my mind even before I walked into the river and died, but I’ve never allowed myself to think of it before. It’s wrong. I still know that it’s wrong. It’s not in the plan. But you see, Dean, the plan is imperfect. Isn’t that hilarious! The plan, which I have devoted my centuries and centuries of life to is imperfect! Incomplete!
“Dean?” He called, and his voice sounded like cracking electricity. He coughed towards the ground, and tried again. “Dean?”
Inside, unfortunately, they were greeted by more than just the music and the lights. Cas squinted his eyes and looked down. Beside him, Dean’s grin widened and his chin tilted up confidently. A woman with light brown hair pulled up into a high ponytail moved towards them.
Without really thinking about it, Dean fast-forwarded tracks until the same song played through Baby’s speakers. He sang along loudly, the words rumbling from his chest. He pulled into the driveway of his house like that, and kept singing as he pushed the front door open and stomped his boots off.
“Dean, if she’s seen the angels here then maybe they have something to do with the missing girl.” Cas tried to make Dean listen, but Dean seemed to have forgotten that they were at the bar for a reason.
The hit of Death’s scythe against the ground echoed louder and louder, as if it was repeatedly being lifted and dropped right beside Dean’s ear. Finally, it stopped.
“‘Little no-name bar’? You’ve got to be joking.” The barista flipped a clean glass from the stack behind her, and filled it up with clear liquid from a tall bottle. “For that, you’ll be buying me a drink.”
“Cas is here?” Sam’s voice carried in from the hallway seconds before he appeared. He’d been cleaning a wound; one sleeve of his shirt was rolled up past his elbow. A smile broke across his face as he stepped up to Castiel, greeting him with a hand on Cas’s shoulder. “Hey, buddy. Good to see you made it out alright.”
Cas turned away from Dean’s bed, stepping back and pivoting to face the opposite direction. He nearly hit his knee against the back wall. He touched one hand to the side to steady himself, resting it atop the small counter top/sink/TV stand combo which was the only raised surface in the room. Cas’s eyes were caught by the silver glimmer of their empty ice bucket, pushed to the back of the counter. Sam’s voice ran through his head, complaining that Dean hadn’t gotten ice before he’d gotten ready for bed, meaning that they wouldn’t have any in the morning.
Castiel ran his fingers through Dean’s hair, his nails scratching gently against his scalp. He didn’t say anything, only waited for Dean to collect his thoughts and try again. He was humming lightly, a song that Dean almost recognized.
Castiel’s coughs eventually subsided, and Dean helped him back against the headboard. He pulled at the pillows until they were even under Castiel’s head. Castiel took a long sip from a glass of water.
Cas closed his eyes, gauging the respective loyalties inside of him, and trying to sense if he could commit himself fully to Heaven. Overwhelmingly, all he could think of was Dean. His soul, which illuminated his side of the room, shone on unhelpfully.
Cas held his coat forwards once more, and this time the girl took it. She squeezed it between her hands before tucking it against her shoulder and leaning over once more. “Thanks,” she whispered as she closed her eyes.
Cas’s attention, which had been straying away from Dean and the barista out of disinterest, snapped back towards them. “You’ve talked with angels here?” Perhaps there was a door to Heaven close by that Cas wasn’t remembering properly. He’d gotten so used to using the one near the bunker.
Cas opened his eyes, not remembering having closed them, and was met by a pair of very worried, very intense green eyes hovering right over him.
Castiel took a step back, releasing his hold on Dean. He tilted his head back, gaze floating up towards the dark sky. Dean wavered and caught himself with the palm of his hand against the rough ground.
: Castiel struggles to climb back up a cliff face in time to save the only thing he's always fought for. Angst. Mostly AU.
Without paying for the ice cream, Dean led them all the way out of the store. Castiel used some of his grace to place the same amount of foregone cash into the cashier’s tip jar. Outside, the grey light turned everything to shades of black and white: the car tires, the pavement with splotches of dripped gasoline, and the shining body of the Impala.
The woman chattered at Cas as she led them through an equally decorated hallway and onto a shiny elevator. Dean registered bits and pieces.
Power thrummed through Castiel’s body, awoken by the lightning. He lifted his hands, held them an inch from Dean’s chest, and spread his fingers wide. He called for his grace, and golden light exploded from his palms. It began towards Dean’s chest, and quickly spread through his whole body, winding and twisting like a growing vine. Dean’s form glowed from within, his features blurring until he was a beam of light, until the air around him, the drops of water, the rocky ground, were all a beam of light.
The sign included no indication of when the bus may be making an appearance. Cas paused, dipping his fingers into his coat pockets. He’d never ridden on a bus before, although he was fairly certain that to do so, as with most human activities, would cost him money.
Dean hit his palm against the table, rattling the empty bottles. “You don’t give up on family, Sam,” he growled incredulously.
: Castiel is wary of allowing Dean to help him after he's hurt on a hunt (ft. Cas accidentally bursts some light bulbs). Angst to fluff. AU/CC.
“Heaven is losing,” Cas said, words just as quiet. He didn’t elaborate, and Dean didn’t press. He just continued tracing his finger against Castiel’s skin: alive, solid. Here, for the moment if nothing else, here.
The whole time, Castiel watched him from his place on the bed, his eyes the same shocking blue that Dean had never entirely succeeded in forgetting. The lighting in Castiel’s second-story bedroom was dull: grey walls, weak lamp alighting their faces from one side, and daylight muffled by an off-white curtain tugged across the window. Although the poor lighting greyed Castiel’s skin and darkened his hair, it did nothing to dim his eyes.
“Fuck, man.” Dean said. He knelt down, and traced one finger lightly around the largest of the bruises. It spanned from the bottom of Castiel’s shoulder bone and across his spine down to his lower back. Another semi raced by on the road, growling like a hungry beast.
The smile had returned to Castiel’s face, but it did not reach his eyes. He looked, in his eyes, as if he was close to tears. “I was waiting for you to come back. Like you sai-”
“You ready to go, man?” Dean asked. As always, Cas was wearing his tan trench coat over a full suit, which would work fine for the party’s dress code. That was a bonus, as Dean wasn’t sure he could get Cas to change clothes if he’d tried.
Dean turned over in bed loudly, moaning indistinguishable words into the pillow before settling in again. Because of how he’d turned, he lay facing away from Sam, towards the wall. He’d pushed himself onto one side of the bed, leaving a large empty space in front of him.
“Yes, I capisce.” Cas sat back against his seat, resting his hands in his lap. Perhaps, now that they were getting closer, Dean would give Cas some more info on the case. It would be hard to be helpful when all that Cas really knew was the tagline. “Where are we going?”
“Tell me you don’t want me,” Cas dared. His blue eyes shone like stars through the veil, framed by his dark eyebrows. He looked like an angel, like he would stay forever the same, like he was too good to be touched, too good to be true. He also looked a bit ridiculous, with his hair spiking against the fabric and his black suit in distracting contrast with the white veil, but that was besides the point.
“What good'll that do?” Dean fell to the side, sitting down against the wall of the diner. “The deed’s already done, Cas.” A car lumbered by on the road, its yellow headlights filtering through the fog. The low rumble of a baseline shook the air as it passed.
Dean’s shirt was damp and malleable, shaping underneath Cas’s hands as he pressed them down into Dean’s chest. He kept his eyes closed, letting his head knock forwards. He focused on sending health and healing into Dean, trying to burn up the last traces of his grace to do so. He could feel it within him, fighting against his demands, clinging to Castiel. He pushed for it to leave him, to bleed out through his fingers.
“Everything will be okay,” Cas mumbled into the ground. The wet rocks were somehow more comfortable against his cheek now than they had been before. His eyes dropped heavily closed. His fingers, which had been tensed, melted gently against the ground. “It’s okay now.” The last of his grace fizzled and died somewhere deep in his chest. Given to a better purpose than himself. "You're saved, Dean."
The barista returned to stand once more before them, having somewhat recovered her composure while serving drinks to another table. “Can I get you anything else?”
But that wasn’t fair. The way Dean had grown up, will the way that John had joked, had made fun of people who were different in that way… it was no wonder that Dean had so much trouble opening up that part of himself. The jealousy faded into regret for his brother as Sam considered how much shame must cloak the feelings Dean had for Cas.
Next chapter, Sam finds a way that he might be able to help push Cas and Dean towards an understanding.
“Alright! Here we go.” Dean said, grinning as he walked around the side of the car. He thumped Cas on the back as he passed, and led them towards the bar. Cas’s shoulders tensed, and he pulled absently at his tie. He followed Dean.
“I command you to look at me,” a deep voice boomed, at once coming from everywhere and nowhere. It was easy to discern from the shrieking, however it did not quiet the noises in any way. The wind continued to howl and billow, circling Dean as if he'd been caught in the middle of a tornado. The rain pelted him from all sides, harsh and stinging. His breath caught in his raw throat. He forced his eyes open and raised his head.

Soon, in a moment, he would use his wings to get far away from here. For now, the bite of the air and the weight on his feet each time he stepped took up the part of his brain that he knew, without distraction, would go back to thinking about Dean.
“Is this better?” Cas traded hands and held the coins forwards instead. The bus driver counted out a selection of the coins from Cas’s hand, one of his eyebrows raised questioningly the entire time. Once he’d collected a satisfactory amount of the change, he let it fall into a little machine, which spat out a ticket in return.
He tapped his socked toes against the floor, his whole body wanting to move but unsure what to do about it. He stayed seated on his bed, his bed that he shared with Lisa. He brushed the tips of his fingers along the material of her dress, laid out on top of the sheets. He traced across the lines of white lace with his eyes as the door to the bedroom swung open.
“You’re Cas.” Dean supplied easily. “You’re a soldier, and a warrior, and one frickin’ terrifying angel when you wanna be. I’m very aware of that now.”
: A case at a corporate Christmas party requires Dean and Cas to pretend they're a couple. Fluff. AU/CC
Cas left. All Dean would hear would be a flap of his wings, and then he’d be free to forget all about what had happened. Cas took himself to where Dean couldn't follow, stepping quickly through the gates of Heaven and continuing towards the offices of his superiors. Right now, Heaven had to win his loyalty. There was no other possibility.
After changing into his suit, and a silent ride in the Impala with Cas, the two arrived downtown. At least, Dean was pretty sure that he’d taken the right turns to get them down town. The street seemed to have transformed into a million tiny, colourful lights and decorations. Dean had to alternate watching the road and resting his eyes on Baby’s dark steering wheel so that he didn’t get dizzy as they parked.
“Cas, man,” Dean said towards the windshield. “Keep your hands and feet inside the car at all times.”
“It’s not that complicated, Cas,” Dean sighed. “Now that I know that death is a, a real possibility for you, I worry. About you, and losing you, I don’t-” He swung himself around so that they sat facing each other. “Dammit, Cas, I can’t lose you again. So don’t go making some stupid show of leaving just because you don’t wanna seem weak. Be weak, fuck, let others help you!” Dean's voice had raised to echo through the kitchen, and his eyes were wild with something like passion or fear.
Dean tiled his head backwards again, to feel the cool press of the snowflakes to the flushed skin of his cheeks. “What is?”
By the time Cas realized that he wasn’t entirely certain how he was meant to get ice for the bucket, he’d run into a large white machine with multiple large labels marking it as “ICE.” Some humans must not know where to get ice from, either, then. The motel had decided they would need to make it as easy to spot as possible.
“Are you getting on?” Called the only person Cas could see. He sat on the far side of the machine, on a raised seat. The bus driver, it took Cas a moment to remember.
Mentions many plot points from canon and so includes SPOILERS. Dean's letter from around episode 13x01 and Cas's from around 7x23.
“Yeah, man, ‘course. I’ll, uh.” Dean scratched at the back of his neck. His fingers reminded him of Cas’s finger in the same place. He dropped his hand away. “I’ll see you in the morning?”
“I think so,” Cas repositioned his angel blade back into his coat sleeve how he liked it. “Although we are currently in a disagreement.”
The coat finally fell from his one side, and immediately caught in a gust of wind, pulling Castiel around so that his back pressed to the cliff face, his face exposed to the wind. The view downwards was dizzying, even though he’d known what to expect. The ocean was far, far below, white-caps like bubbling dashes of white across a wine-dark abyss. It stirred and thrashed, as if the water itself were alive.
No matter how long and hard the day’s hunt had been, no matter what new monsters they’d have to face tomorrow, Dean would never let Cas help him like that. It wasn’t what Cas was there for, not really. He could heal their battle wounds when it was the difference between life or death, but something like this, something that was more for pleasure than necessity, there was no way Dean would allow it.
The question of what Cas actually did in this room, then, remained. He certainly did spend at least some time alone there, with last night as just one example.
“What’s the rush? Something you’re eager to get to out there?” Dean dropped the half-eaten sandwich onto his plate dramatically. “Something better than staying here with me and Sam?”
Dean put out the dregs of his cigarette with the heel of his boot, then moved to stand behind Castiel. The pale skin of his bare back looked as if it had been painted in rich purples and blues. Bruises, like the wounds of a hundred lost battles.
When he’d told Castiel to wait for him, Dean had meant it as more of a politeness than a promise. He’d turned away from Castiel without a second thought.
Dean stepped up to Cas, leaving less than a foot between them. “I’ve never known what to say, Cas. Each time I thought about telling you, the words got all twisted up, or I talked myself down. But I know, I know that when I say, ‘I love you too,’ I mean, ‘there was no way in Hell that I was letting you die without getting to tell you that,’ because I want you to know, man. You deserve to know. Even if I can’t frickin' say it.”
It was lucky that they had each other, the deer. If the mother hadn’t rushed her babies across the street, then the car that passed would have run right into them. The world was much easier to navigate with a family. At one point Cas had considered the other angels his family. That had been before he’d learned the true meaning of the word.
This letter, then, was from around when they’d found Cas again, had helped him regain his memories, and had very promptly left him to be watched by the demon Meg in a mental hospital. Not a great way to treat a friend, looking back on it.
“Oh, there’s nothing that compares,” Castiel said softly. He seemed to have come back from his thoughts, and after clearing his throat, he continued. “I bought this house during my second year at the museum. Until then I’d lived in our apartment on 7th. I like this new house because of the high ceilings, and the spiral carved into the handle on the staircase. I thought that you would appreciate the two-car garage. I adopted a cat three years ago. You may have seen her when you came in.”
“Yeah, sure. But do ya’ remember what I said about this place specifically?” Dean asked, and if Cas hadn’t remembered he would have been able to guess from the glow behind Dean’s eyes.
“I should go.” Cas’s face had frozen over. No emotion showed in the set of his lips or in the curve of his eyebrows. Only in his eyes, and only because Dean had seen it there many times before, did he betray his discomfort. Dean had made Cas uncomfortable. Uncomfortable enough to leave.
If Cas had been asking if he should stay, then Dean had certainly led him to believe the opposite. And it was true—Dean would be happy to get a couple of days away from Cas. The guy had blown down every one of Dean’s expectations and then some, and not in a good way. What Cas had done, it brought his judgement into question. He’d put too many things above everyone’s safety.
With the ice-cream bars hugged against his chest, Castiel leaned against the side wall, his eyes fluttering nearly closed. The ray of sunlight had stretched, fallen across his toes. Dean’s light words filtered like honey through the air. The cars outside made low noises like the tide lapping on the shore. The door opened, a bell tinkling with the motion.
“Alright, but don’t say I didn’t warn you.” Sam tossed one of the bars into the back seat for Cas. It was, according to the wrapper, birthday cake flavoured. Castiel placed it to the side and leaned forwards to watch Dean biting into his. The expression on Dean’s face turned from happy anticipation to disappointment as soon as the ice cream touched his tongue.
He snapped his gaze to the touch, and found Dean’s hand holding him in place. A look to Dean’s face revealed the driver’s attention still glued forwards.
“I'm not gonna say what you did was perfect, Cas, because it wasn't; but everyone’s got their stuff! You think me or Sam never done anything stupid in the moment?”
“Something like that,” Dean said. “Hey, hold onto that drink for me, ‘k? I’ll be back.” Dean flicked the bartender a grin over his shoulder, and descended from the bar stool. The weather outside had shifted towards rain, and Dean popped his jacket collar up as the bar’s door closed behind him. He could feel the raindrops already seeping into the denim.
He looked sharply away from her, clutching a hand to his mouth. The regrets hadn’t actually gone anywhere while he’d forgotten them, it seemed. They had only grouped together, creating a tidal wave to hit him all at once.
Castiel agreed with Dean’s assessment — he had gone soft. He was wearing a whole array of injuries to prove it. The near-smiting of Ruby had thrown him off of his game, left him too deep in his thoughts. When the sigil had been drawn, Cas had hardly even noticed it before he’d been banished from the fight. It had been a mercy, in some ways, to have received the free pass out, loss of healing abilities notwithstanding.
So there was nothing to worry about, here, and nothing more sinister to focus on. Castiel could let himself forget, could focus on the ridiculously bright candy packages, or the laughing child a row over. He could let his thoughts stretch outside of the store, listen for the rumble as cars pulled in and out of the gas pumps. He could let himself be nothing, nothing, with the complete trust that Dean would retrieve him and bring him back to the world. There was a peace, in the gas station dollar store, that rebounded off of the white walls and traded between the beige and orange tiled floor.
The veil was off of Castiel’s head, smoothed out, and hung back on the mirror before Dean had managed to remind his eyes that the room was, in fact, bright enough to see in.
Cas’s eyes flicked upwards as he responded, the red lights turning his irises the colour of sin. “That I’m the reason for Heaven’s unwinding? No.” He shrugged one shoulder. “It’s not as if there are any bodies for them to use to identify me. Most of the higher ups are refusing to even acknowledge that an outside force is trying to bring them down. They’re trying to say that there’s some fault in the coding, or with the function. As far as most are concerned, no crime-”
Dean threw his body overtop of Castiel’s, blocking him the best he could from the oozing tendrils of the Empty. Cas thrashed underneath him, trying to push Dean off, to do the valiant thing and sacrifice himself. Dean pushed all of his weight down, trapping Cas against the floor.
Dean had breathed the words into Castiel’s mouth, and followed them with a low hum, and then a whine of disappointment as Castiel had pulled away.
The words hurt worse than the sting of reapplying the washcloth to his open wounds. The words, though, were a necessary pain. What would happen if Castiel allowed himself to believe, for only a second, that his relationship with Dean was anything like that?
The truth was, Cas hadn’t known, in the moment, that he was going to spare Ruby. His hand had been raised, his strike ready, but as he’d started to call his power forwards, he’d pictured Dean in Ruby’s place.
Maybe Castiel was too sick to remember. Dean had heard of that happening, people so out of it that they forgot who they were talking to, or what year it was. Perhaps Castiel wasn’t even aware of the terrible things Dean had done, all of his selfish decisions. If that was the case, it would only be fair for Dean to excuse himself and let Castiel be watched over by someone who hadn’t hurt him.
Dean kicked his heel back against the thin tree behind him, antsy to get going, to get it over with. He lifted his wrist, pulled back his sleeve, glanced at his watch without really registering the time; he waited for Castiel to finish crossing the cemetery.
Cas clicked the lamp back on. He searched Dean’s face, and seemed to find something satisfactory. He dug an extra jacket out of Dean's bag, tossed it to him with an expression that left no room for argument, and led their way down the staircase, through the empty lobby, and out the double doors. Dean sorted his clothing out as they walked, his jean jacket under his leather jacket, with both collars flipped up.
Out loud, back in the present moment in Castiel’s bedroom, Dean repeated the same words again. “I said, ‘wait for me to come back to you, Castiel’.”
“Well, yeah. If they do, they could call for more to arrive and help them, or leave with hostages instead of attacking them here where we could stop it.”
“But it’ll be safer if we go as a group.” Cas’s head was tilted to the side as he tried to read more information from Dean’s face. Dean squirmed under the scrutiny.
“Sammy?” He called out into the empty space. No answer came. The walls pressed in on Dean as he walked through the hallway, each empty room he passed like the graves of all the people he hadn’t been able to keep by his side.
. I don’t know how to bring him back. What if he doesn’t come back this time. Everything has been taken from me. I don’t know if there’s any point anymore. Why have I been left here? Why do I have to stay?
The operation, it appeared, was going well. Dean’s tone suggested interest, approval. He spoke slowly, letting the vowels linger in the air. He complemented the cashier’s haircut, and when her hands twitched up to pull at her ponytail, he shifted seamlessly to noticing her painted nails. Judging from the cashier’s pink cheeks, she was only a few moments away from either giving Dean what he wanted or from throwing him out of the store.
Perhaps he’d just sleep here, for a few minutes. Just a brief stop to rest his eyes. Dean began to fall sideways, letting his body relax.
Sam comes across secret letters and realizes that his brother's feeling for Cas may be more complicated than he'd thought.
Cas tentatively moved his hand away from where he’d almost touched Dean’s fingers, and stilled it in front of Dean’s face, instead. He let the power seep through his palm weakly, to ensure that the golden light didn’t become bright enough to awake either human. With the help of his grace, Cas pushed everything calm and peaceful that he could imagine towards Dean. He pictured long, empty highways and Dean’s beloved Impala; he thought of lazy days spent watching old western movies. When Cas ran out of things that Dean would like, he imagined his own peace, and pressed that into Dean as well.
Dean’s arms fell in on themselves and he pressed his forehead to the table, eyes still closed. He almost wanted to sleep.
Cas’s footfalls sounded at the base of the stairs, the echoing of shoes on metal, and Dean knew that it was his last chance to stop him. If he didn’t get up, push himself away from the table that supported his weight and march himself across the bunker, then Cas would reach the door and he’d turn the handle and he would be gone.
Ruby and Sam’s relationship had been flawed, completely, and Cas wasn’t about to make any claims that it had been anything close to love. But when he looked at his feelings for Dean from the perspective of the angels, Cas couldn’t help seeing similarities. Where Ruby had tainted Sam with her demon blood, the angels believed that Dean tainted Castiel with his humanity.
“Huh?” Cas had pressed his face into Dean’s shoulder, and he took a second to reposition his head so that he could hear.
“Yeah, exactly.” Dean’s eyes were shining with something akin to childlike excitement. Castiel could have stared into them forever.
“Oh, uh,” once again, the barista seemed to have just remembered Cas’s existence. “Two nights ago? Maybe three? She lives with our mom a town over.” By the end of her speaking, the barista had turned back towards Dean.
In the mirror’s reflection, the gashes across his chest and stomach shone a murky burgundy. They were not deep, but they were numerous, and Castiel gritted his teeth as he pulled the washcloth over them. The demon wielding the angel blade had failed to get in a good attack, but he had not missed his mark completely.
Cas had been right, of course. Without him around, Dean had been able to convince himself that he could be happy with Lisa. He’d pictured a life for himself, for the first time in a long time, that didn’t include Cas at every turn. He’d started to feel okay with it.
“And I’ve enjoyed hanging onto them, for the same reason.” Dean pulled Cas’s hand back out flat, and pushed the second ring onto his pointer finger. This one was thinner, a black band with a line of deep red circling along one side. It was made of minerals from the grounds of Hell. One ring to represent above, one for below, and somehow together they made Castiel think of him.
“Hey there. Looking for something?” She asked. Cas thought to answer her, but her attention was undoubtedly pointed towards Dean, who, for his part, rolled his shoulders back and gave her a sideways smile.
“I’ve been busy planning a wedding, Cas.” Dean flipped his hand towards the wedding dress beside him by way of example. Outside of the window, colours visible through the thin curtain, the archway and rows of chairs were being arranged in the garden. The people setting up moved like ants, back and forth, never stopping. Everything they had to do was clear and obvious. How Dean wished he was one of them.
Giving up on the dresser, Sam lowered himself to his knees and felt around under the bed. He found a spare angel blade and a cracked coffee mug, the latter probably a left over from a former inhabitant. Brushing his hands together to ease the dust off, Sam stood. He shook his shoulders out, and wondered if Cas had just been waiting for Dean to sleep. It wouldn’t have been the first time that Cas had waited for a whole night for Dean. Sam sighed, wondering if he would ever be able to trust as openly as Dean could.
“You were trying to sleep, but the movement of the bus was keeping you awake. When Sam sleeps in the Impala, he uses a sweater balled up against the door. I thought you might like to use my coat.”
Yes, it was good that Dean and Cas were getting some time alone. Maybe, if Sam had even a smidge of luck left in the universe, they’d talk some things out. Some big things. Some things that would mean Sam could go back to doing things for himself instead of acting as the buffer between his brother and the feelings that he wouldn’t dare say aloud.
Dean lowered his head and pulled himself against Cas, tucking his head into the curve where Cas’s neck joined with his shoulder. The folded collar of Cas’s trench coat buried itself into Dean’s cheek. Because the material was thick, and because he was sure that Cas wouldn't be able to tell, Dean pressed his lips to Cas’s shoulder. He kissed the rough material of the trench coat, taking what precious little he could get. It was all he deserved. It was more than he deserved.
“We can follow him,” Cas said. He raked a hand back through his hair, pulling at the strands. The circles under his eyes seemed to have darkened.
Back then, their kisses had been often and enthusiastic. Dean had taken them for granted, and had gone nearly the whole twenty years trying, in vain, to find something that would heat his chest in the same way. He wondered what it would be like to kiss him now, if it would be the same after all this time.
Dean dropped his head down, both hands coming to clutch at his ears. He hardly registered his phone falling to the ground, skitting against the concrete. He yelled out loud, just to drown out a tiny portion of the screeching with something of his own. The wind knocked Dean onto his knees, the ground wet and hard. His hands clutched his face, his fingers scratching against his skin. His eyes, squeezed shut, felt like they were dripping. He told himself that it was just rain water lapping over his skin.
“Ok, cut it out.” Sam stepped away, out of reach. “Just, let me know if the… situation gets out of your control.” The almost apologetic look Sam used to accompany his words was enough to send a spark of indignation through Dean’s veins. Why the Hell did Sam think Dean deserved his pity?
“No, I’m not. I’m sorry that I didn’t reassure you sooner, Dean. I was unaware that you were under that impression. It must have been quite a burden.”
“Yeah, but I’m pretty sure I got some drool on your coat, so you can pretty much tell me anything now.” The girl shrugged. She slid her backpack along the floor as she moved a seat closer to Cas, one empty spot still between them. Her bag was open at the top, just enough for Cas to catch the title on her textbook: 12th grade Economics. She was still in high school.
“Holy fuck,” Dean breathed. He let his head fall onto the mattress again, now for an entirely different reason. Colours and sounds began seeping back around him: the rustle of windchimes outside, the tapping of little paws against the floor below. A large, shaking breath fled from Dean’s lungs, pulling with it a low laugh. “Oh man, Cas. Shit.”
But if the paper hadn’t been folded and shoved into the old book by the Men of Letters, then that left only a few possible suspects, and Sam couldn’t imagine either Dean or Cas having any reason to do such a thing. The last time this particular book had been opened… Sam’s gaze drifted upwards as he searched his memory. The last time they’d used this book for research had been on a rugaru case shortly after… Oh. Shortly after Cas and Mary had died.
Cas pulled his trench coat sleeves off one by one, and twisted in his seat to pull it the rest of the way off. He folded it up into a pillow-sized bundle, careful to remove his angel blade and anything else sharp from the pockets.
“The girl was last seen leaving Freezie’s. We’re going to check it out, see if we can’t round up a few witnesses.”
“This will never exist again.” Dean only realized he’d spoken the words aloud when Cas raised his face to answer.
“I know, Cas.” Dean took a step forward, his feet moving without his asking. “When I said, ‘I need you,’ I meant it as in, ‘I die everyday that you’re not here.’” He took another wide step forward. “When I said, ‘I’m not leaving here without you,’ I meant, ‘I’ve been looking for you like a lost past of myself, and I didn’t know relief until I'd found you again.’”
“Why does this sound like a goodbye?” Dean asked, the fear automatic. He had to be wrong, because there was no way Cas would just leave him, not after saying those words that made Dean’s head spin, made his heart race. All of Dean’s insecurities, his thoughts of himself, spoken and dismissed as Cas had smiled all the while.
Dean’s eyes fluttered open. His thoughts were slow to come. The world in front of him took a moment to come into focus.
“I’m confused.” Cas leaned to the side to look at Dean. Dean’s head was turned stiffly forwards, his profile to Cas. He was studying the ground with a great interest.
“No, it does. 't was just nice t' have something of yours.”  In the grey light, Cas's blue eyes shone like visions of crystal waters. Their clarity, although beautiful, was guarded. Dean couldn’t tell if Cas had heard the way his voice had shaken.
The thump of the Ma’lak box hitting the bottom of the grave broke down the hastily-constructed peace in Dean’s mind, and he remembered what he was doing. He turned and kicked the stump of a fallen tree with his heel. He bent over, supporting himself with his hands on his knees.
The last bits of daylight withdrew slowly through the white curtains across the window, casting the two beds deeper into darkness. Sam, on his bed against the far wall, remained motionless. He'd fallen into an unmoving sleep shortly after his head hit the pillow, and Cas was certain that he would awake well rested. Dean, however, continued to move. He would toss his arm onto the pillow over his head, stay still for a few breaths, then turn over to lie the other way. His legs tangled in the blankets, then untangled and disappeared beneath them once more. His breaths were uneven.
3...2...1… The crashing of the scythe, the oozing of the Empty, everything stopped. Silence vibrated eerily against Dean’s ears. Was this what it felt like to be dead? Perhaps the pain had been quick enough that he’d missed it.
Dean placed a knee onto the bed, leaning forwards, until he could see the dark world through the window. He blinked, squinted his eyes. All he saw was the faint outline of where the parking lot met the cement fence. He’d parked the Impala directly under the window. If someone had- If somehow- “Is Baby-?” Dean was three steps towards the door when he was stopped by Cas’s palm against his chest.
“‘Course.” Dean nodded, tried to smile. He waved, but that felt stupid so he pinned his hand back to his side and led himself stiffly to the hotel door. The snow beneath his feet didn’t make a single sound louder than the pounding of his heart in his chest.
But Castiel had always been illuminated by his own private, internal light source. Dean used to joke that, since Castiel kept so much to himself, all of his secrets and unshared opinions buzzed inside of him, loud and numerous enough to emit a light and a warmth. Castiel had called him judgemental and kissed him to shut him up. He’d never been good at taking a compliment. Or maybe Dean had never been good at giving them.
“Will you be heading back to Heaven now, then?” Sam asked. He’d retrieved the broom and was sweeping up the burst light bulbs.
A voice that had once put Dean at quicker peace than any form of liquor sounded from the house’s entryway, soft over the distance. Now, instead of calming, that voice made Dean’s pulse jump and his fingers curl. Castiel had arrived. Dean’s watch told him that the time had somehow become 9:30 am, and Castiel had arrived, because he had a place in the ceremony, because Dean had thought he’d want Cas there. Now he wasn’t so sure.
They were not the letters of a spy, nor of a betrayer. They were, if Sam had to put a name to them, love letters, although not the teasing, passionate letters that existed between Mary and John. These were more like diary entries, addressed to someone never meant to read them. They spoke of one-sided love, of a lover resigned to go on unnoticed.
Dean had taped extra batteries to the back of the Walkman. As long as Castiel didn't rewind too many times, it should last him a while. Maybe long enough for Dean to find a way to save him.
“Good.” Cas replied. He slid his shirt back on and lifted himself to standing, reaching down to help Dean up as well. He didn’t drop Dean’s hand once they started walking. The warmth of Castiel’s skin against his released tension from Dean’s shoulders; his headache, too, had lessened significantly.
The book, if it could be called that, was at least a foot long by a foot wide, and several inches thick. The cover was solid black, its plastic sheen shining blue and purple. Sam flipped it open and the book flattened itself to a certain page as if it had been waiting to do so.
The course of whispered apologies had slowly subsided, buried in Dean’s silent tears. Each shovel of dirt that he'd dropped into the grave seemed to suffocate the entire world. No noise came from anywhere, no colour either. Everything was empty.
Sam was planning to drive up on his own in a day or two if they hadn’t yet made ground on the case. Dean and Cas were more than capable of investigating on their own, and they’d all agreed that it would be useful to have someone remain at the bunker to have access to the Men of Letters books. Sam drank his green smoothie down in big gulps as he made his way from the bunker’s kitchen to the main room. A stack of books, selected by him and Cas the night before, were already laid out across the table, waiting to be cracked open.
After many false starts scratched out with a dark pen, Dean’s angled scrawl was legible. The lines were oddly spaced, as if written at different times, or in different bursts of thought.
Beneath Castiel, Dean sputtered and choked. His breathes grew further apart. Castiel grasped his hands into the wet cloth of Dean’s shirt. He threw everything he had into the saving, the one thing he would always do. The one cause he would be always loyal to. He tried. His hands glowed weakly from his palms, the light more pale and washed out than the golden splendour of older days.
Dean’s mouth fell open despite himself. “Oh, yeah. A’ course.” He looked past Cas, through the doorway, then shifted his gaze towards his hands. “So, then-”
Have you ever seen the ocean, Dean? I’m sure you have; you’ve been on Earth for a decent amount of time, as far as humans go. Of course, I’ve seen the ocean many times. I watched as a little grey fish lifted itself up out of the water, too curious to stay in the dark any longer. I never did, however, see the ocean as I did just the other night. The way that the sun reflects in the water, the way everything shone orange and white—you should have been there. I wish you had been there.
Dean had suggested Cas stay. Throughout the meal Sam had made passing jokes about crashing their date, which Dean had pointedly laughed off. At the booth where they’d sat to eat, Sam had been alone on his side, leaving Cas and Dean to squeeze together on the opposite bench. Seeing that there wasn’t much room, Cas had offered, again, to leave. Dean had asked him again to stay.
He let his head fall back to rest against the wall, his gaze pointed up at the sky. He could just make out the outline of a glowing sign across the road. It was a sign for the diner, but he wouldn’t have been able to tell if he didn’t already know. Dean didn’t go there anymore, to the diner. They recognized him, connected him with Sam and the ungodly amount of non-human blood that had painted the bathroom walls.
The first ring he retrieved was the silver one, its thick band cool against his skin. He brushed the pad of his thumb over its texture—feathers, carved with delicate lines into a pair of wings. Dean held Castiel’s hand flat as he slipped the ring onto his middle finger.
Castiel’s muscles tensed and pulled, working to control the raw power within himself. His arms shook, out of his control. He was merely the conductor, and Dean the receiver. The wind spun and spun around them, the only thing that could not be turned to light. Castiel’s eyes squinted as he fought to see in the brightness. He finally had to let them close, and allowed the energy to find its own way.
Perhaps angels weren’t meant to have families. Celestial beings, it was likely, were just too inhuman. Cas had been the closest out of all the other angels to actually joining a family, and despite all the good that it had brought him, Cas had watched it fall away. He’d caused it to fall away.
Castiel pressed the cloth deep against his wounds, catching the breath of pain before it moved past his lips. Just look at what the notion of love had done to him! He pulled the cloth along the length of the wound, and dabbed it to the skin on either side. Catching his eyes in the mirror once more, Castiel was surprised by their watery state, like tears were seconds away from falling. “And anyways,” he reminded himself, “love is not your purpose.”
It had been a rainy day, stormy enough that Dean’s phone was constantly forced to refresh the airline’s website and check if the flight had been delayed. Dean had decided that, for each hour the flight got delayed, he would drink four glasses of whisky. Castiel had called the decision laughably stupid.
The bus driver moaned and lifted his head. He was still not fully conscious, but he would be fine. Cas sighed and turned to the girl. She handed him his coat.
inside the car, Dean,” Cas said, tilting his head as he considered what Dean could have meant besides the obvious.
Castiel’s eyes were buried in deep circles, his lips pale and chapped. He looked as he always did when he returned from Heaven: the set of his mouth was just off, the tick of his eyebrow just a fraction lower than normal. He looked as if he’d been turned inside out and then set right again, but something had gone wrong along the way.
Dean’s first step outside the door was onto cement, the ground protected by the roof over the doorway. His second step was into at least an inch of snow. It stuck to his boot, dusting the toe and digging itself between the grooves.
Somehow, Castiel didn’t get it. Dean had thought this would be easier, that Cas would get why Dean had done what he’d done, as he and Cas were in the same boat, anyways. “You’ve gotta get your head outta dreamland, Cas. Don’t you understand?”
Cas leaned forwards farther towards the impala’s windshield. He wanted to watch the road disappear beneath the front tires. One of his legs was moving up to get underneath him, to push him further forwards, when he felt pressure against his shoulder.
Once all of the police files had been consulted and any hacking completed, Dean was pretty much looking to be done his part of the research. He sometimes picked up a book, but only to flip through it while mumbling the lyrics to a song with his thoughts elsewhere. Dean liked to accompany Sam, he was sure, as he saw it as an extra opportunity to annoy his little brother. Dean would snatch books from Sam’s hand or close pages that he’d been keeping open, just to watch his face turn from annoyance to desperation.
Dean obliged, holding the shovel so tightly that his knuckles turned white as he dug the grave deep, deep into the earth. The Ma’lak box weighed too much for him to really be picking it by himself, but he couldn’t ask Cas to help drop his own cage into his own grave. He could hardly even stomach himself doing it. Every movement felt wrong, like he was breaking a promise.
Oh, oh. Dean was nervous. Castiel could fix that. He took the hat from Dean’s hand and placed it onto his own head, fairly certain that he was doing it right based off of the movies that Dean had made him watch. Or perhaps not quite, as Dean chuckled and leaned forwards to help him adjust it.
“Are you tired? You can stay here, man. I don’t mind.” Dean’s eyes were steady on Cas’s, and this time, it was Cas who had to look away.
Cas let his hand drift upwards, ghosting it over top of Dean’s. Dean’s face drew slowly closer to his, his eyes floating downwards to Cas’s lips. Cas let himself lean forwards…
Cas didn’t need to know that Dean slept with his hands pressed to his mouth, breathing in the faint scent of the trench coat. Cas didn’t need to know, and if Dean was lucky, he would forget by morning.
Dean let his legs carry him towards his car. He rubbed his hands together, thinking about the music he’d play on the ride back to the bunker. He slid his hands into his pocket for the keys, pressed them into the lock in the driver’s side door, and then used his free hand to knock against the side of the hood in exasperation.
“Alright, sure” Dean put his hand palm-down onto the bar. “So you’re telling me this is popular with the locals then, this place?”
“Speaking of what to do, why don’t you take this old thing off.” She pulled at the collar of his flannel shirt, visible under his open jacket. “Our clothes for the ceremony are laid out in the bedroom. Why don’t you go get changed while I see if there’s anything I need to do in here.”
Cas slid his hand off of his face, and tried to smile at the girl. He held his coat up, nodding a thanks for the return.
The bed groaned as Cas slid himself off of it, and he grumbled right along with it. He walked shakily across the room, using the walls and furniture to his advantage. Once he’d made it into the adjoining bathroom, he braced one hand onto the sink as he took in his reflection in the mirror.
“No, not that. I’ve actually been, uh,” Sam placed the TV remote back down on Dean’s bed and drew his fingers into his jeans pocket. He withdrew an ID card and held it towards Dean. “I’ve been cleaning out-”
Those words from Dean's lips were like a shot of adrenaline right to Cas's heart. The world through his eyes turned bright white. A great crash sounded from above them, shards of glass scattering down from the ceiling. Literal sparks flew as the lights burst apart, first alighting the room, then plunging them into near darkness.
“You’re in a good mood,” Lisa greeted him once Dean had made his way into the foyer. She came to his side, brushing his hair back from his face before kissing him on the cheek.
Inside of the book, tucked half-way into the binding, was a piece of lined paper. Its edges were uneven, as if it had been ripped away hastily from somewhere else. Judging from the crumpled bit of the paper that Sam could see, it was too white to have been left there by the Men of Letters, not darkened by the time that it would have had.
“Just because he left,” Sam took a step to the side, and reached towards the ground. He straightened back up with Cas’s badge in his hand. “Just because Cas left, doesn’t mean that he isn’t going to come back.”
Castiel, out of habit, tucked his head to the side in self-protection. In the garrison, weakness was not rewarded, and the routines ingrained within him way back then had yet to entirely fade. He pressed himself flush against the wall, imagining someone with celestial strength coming towards him, their intentions to teach and to punish.
Dean tightened his arms around Cas’s strong back. He bunched the thick material of the trench coat within his fists. He followed Cas’s slow sways back and forth, let him turn them a quarter ways around, then around again. Their footsteps left tracks in the snow, overlapping and uneven.
The air in the bedroom was like thick putty, pushing against Dean’s every movement. His eyes were having trouble focusing. His thumb stroked over Cas’s lips. He thought he heard Lisa’s voice from somewhere outside. The light seemed to have lowered. Surely, he could hardly see.
“Now, what did you want?” Cas asked as he used one finger to adjust the lights looped around Dean’s shoulders.
“Why won’t they heal?” Dean asked, letting his words fizzle into the thick air. Castiel had, at one point, been untouchable. Neither bullet nor blade had been able to leave a mark, and if anything had, his celestial power would have healed it within seconds.
Cas’s fingers at the base of Dean’s neck surprised him. Dean paused, found Cas’s face through the snowy air. Cas’s skin shone a pale, sunken white. The snow falling behind him seemed to circle him in a halo. Specks of water shone in the tips of his hair.
Cas’s head tilted, and even from behind him, Dean knew that Cas was giving him a calculating stare-down.
With the bucket still hugged against his chest and held there with one arm, Castiel used his other hand to pull open the heavy door to the ice box. A tumble of many, many ice cubes and a waft of frozen air greeted him from inside. He used the bucket like a scoop, filling it nearly to the top. The sides of the ice bucket became cold to the touch almost immediately, and the sides began to grow slippery with condensation.
I had so much fun writing this one and focusing on the aesthetic. I hope that you enjoyed it! I'd love to hear your thoughts <3
Dean brushed snowflakes from Cas’s trench coat, once, twice, his fingers never straying far from the firm curve of Cas’s shoulder.
As the form drew the light back towards itself, the alleyway began to darken again. The glow receded like the shoreline, pulling away from the walls and the rain gently, as if it kissed each ugly thing as it left them. The wind died down, and the rain let up; Dean slumped to the side, his hip landing heavily against the ground. His eyes dropped closed as the air rushed from his lungs. He felt like he’d been running for days.
Snow fell onto Dean’s exposed fingers where they held around Cas’s back. Snow tickled as it landed in his hair, and caught like rain in his eyelashes. It was easier to close his eyes, to hold his breath. He only realized that they were swaying when Cas began to hum. The notes were hardly loud enough to make it through the dense quiet.
The contact spiked pain throughout the left side of Castiel’s body. He grimaced and tried to pull slightly away from it.
Something about Cas’s hand felt just a little off, though. It took Dean a second to remember what it was, as if his mind was working through the same thick fog that their bodies walked through.
“If I tell you, you have to promise to not tell anyone else,” Cas said. The girl nodded sharply. “Alright, then,” Cas slid one arm into his coat, pulling it back on. “I’m an angel of the Lord.”
“Maybe if you put the ornaments in a better place, then I wouldn't have to hold my arms out like a damn scarecrow,” Dean mumbled. Somehow, he’d drawn the short straw and taken the role of Christmas Tree. He didn’t even remember talking with Cas about the decision. Frickin’ angels.
Despite the hands-on importance of door-to-door questioning and exploring the scene of the crime, there was still use to be found in good old research. If Sam was honest with himself, he sometimes liked the research better than the kill. It was nice to get the opportunity to flex his skills from university, in whatever way he could. It worked out well, really, as Dean would rather fight some vamps two-on-one with his bare hands than spend a day with the books.
“Awesome,” Dean said hoarsely. He leaned heavily against the wall as he lifted himself to his feet. His footsteps echoed too loudly against the cement floor with every step. He brought himself to where the Empty had appeared, and traced one finger down the lines of the bricks. “How do we know that it won’t come back and get you later?”
Sam flipped to the last page of the little book, realized that he hadn’t been paying attention for at least the last few pages, and placed it closed on the table near his elbow anyways. He reached towards the center of the table, pressing his palm down onto the top of a large, heavy book and used the pressure to pull it towards him. Its shiny cover squeaked against the table.
If what the angel had said had been true, the Empty was here only for him. He’d felt true happiness by confessing his love for Dean, and completed the deal he’d made on his life. A delicate beauty existed in naming the joy and openness of admittance, but that wasn’t what Cas deserved; he deserved to feel the complete happiness of having his love reciprocated, and of knowing that someone in the cold, broken world loved him back.
“This is Cas’s.” Dean pulled the card from Sam’s fingers and held it up in front of himself. Castiel’s face stared back at him from the small image on the left side of the card. Sam had handed him Cas’s fake FBI badge. Dean turned it around in his palm, smiling softly as he remembered Cas’s first time using it, holding it upside down. Dean’s smile fell as he turned back to Sam. “Why are you giving this to me?”
“Freezie’s,” Cas repeated. He tried to think of a place he’d heard of before with the same name. “What’s ‘Freezie’s’?”
“I know Dean. That’s what you’ve been doing all day.” A note of judgement coloured Sam’s voice. Dean glared back at him with an expression that he hoped conveyed all of his older-brother authority.
Feel free to hop around and read these in any order. Only a few are related to each other, and even ones that are can be read alone :) The table of contents includes a brief overview of each one-shot, whether it's more angst or fluff, and whether it's AU or Canon Compliant (CC)
Each time that the bus turned a corner or drove over a bump, the girl’s body hit against the side. She didn’t seem to mind, but human bodies were so delicate. She could get hurt if she hit her head too hard.
Out of more habit than any real suspicion, Sam patted his hand against Cas’s single pillow, fluffing out a crease. The pillow made an odd crunching sound. When the sound happened a second time, Sam flipped the pillow over, revealing, underneath it, a manila envelope, thick and stuffed to the brim. Ah ha!
Cas leaned his head to the side so that his face aligned with Dean’s. He slid his knee away from himself, farther down the bed, so that his hip could slowly, slowly touch down onto the mattress. Nothing made a noise. Nothing moved. Cas lowered his head until it hovered inches from the pillow.
With his head tilted upwards like this, Dean could see the path that each snowflake took, streaking from the dark sky in a smooth, sloping line. He could only watch them for a second -- too many fell into his eyes and he had to close them, but that was almost better. The snowflakes fell onto his cheeks, his chin, his forehead. Each one was like a kiss from cold lips. He opened his mouth to catch some on his tongue. He opened himself up to them, throwing his shoulders wider until the muscles in his low back began to protest.
As such, Dean had pressed deeply against Castiel, moved them together, wrapping his arms around Castiel’s back and angling his head so that they had fit against each other. The rain pounding against the window had done nothing to cool the warmth emanating from Castiel’s body.
Someday soon, he would stand down from hunting. Without saving Cas, there was no point. No amount of saved lives would amount to that loss.
Maybe the Walkman, and the music within it, would make Castiel’s sentence slightly less agonizing. Dean placed it beside the flashlight, hanging the headphones overtop of it. It was his own Walkman that he’d bought with a pocket full of change many years ago. He’d tried to teach Cas how to use an iPod, but the guy had been better with the older tech. Dean hadn’t been able to stop himself from smiling each time he saw Cas walking through the halls of the bunker, headphones over his ears, Walkman clutched in his hand, mouthing the words to one of their songs.
So God was back in the game, and everything that Dean had ever done or would do in his life had only been fulfilling his role in God’s favourite TV show. Nothing mattered. He was fine, otherwise. He’d gotten over Castiel’s departure. Dean was fine.
Dean tightened his grasp around Cas’s hand. His Cas, this creature that masqueraded as human but really was so much more. Castiel had known the risks and he’d chosen to weaken Heaven anyways. This would not be the end for either of them.
“Congratulations on your wedding,” he said, fake-brightly. And then the door was opened, and he was gone. He was gone. Dean sat back on the bed, his face in his hands. The chime on his phone, counting down hours until the ceremony began, chimed once. A ripple of laughter drifted through the closed window. Dean allowed himself five minutes to grieve, then he stood, slid his tie from the dresser, and continued to get ready. He couldn’t meet his own eyes in the mirror as he flipped his shirt collar up and settled the tie around his neck.
“Forever,” Castiel said once more, into the stale air of his bedroom. He said it with just as much conviction now as he had then. “And I did. You showed me true happiness. You showed me paradise. I would wait for that forever.”
Dean nodded, knowing that Castiel wasn’t really waiting for a response. They continued moving forwards through the fog, boots crunching on the gravel of the parking lot and stomping louder once they’d reached the road. They passed underneath the diner sign, the red lights casting blood-like shadows under Castiel’s eyes and into the dips of his cheekbones.
Maybe I'll start giving little teasers for the coming chapters: next one, we're gonna see Cas struggling to convince himself of something he'd up until recently accepted as fact.
Sam glanced sideways at Dean. “You know, I could-” He rubbed his palms up and down his thighs. “I could go with Cas. He and I aren’t as close, so it might be easier to-”
Since Cas couldn't seem to succeed in getting through to him, there was no reason to stay any longer with the Winchesters. Seeing Dean, being near him but unable to talk to him, was slowly eating a hole into Castiel’s heart. Dean’s expression dropped into cold disgust every time his eyes landed on Cas, as if Dean saw in his place a rotting corpse; perhaps he did, the dead body of Dean’s mother. He still blamed Cas for her death.
There was no time to waste mourning a piece of fabric. Castiel feared he was too late already. He sprang back around, propelling himself with a new rush of adrenaline up the cliff side, reaching his arms, digging his fingers into any holds that he could find. His breath forced from his lungs in desperate gusts, creating white clouds of air that were quickly whisked away by the swirling winds.
Even Sam, leaned against the passenger-side door, reading something on his phone, appeared in monotone colours. Cas started towards him, but Dean caught at his elbow, pulling him to the side. It was the contact that Cas had been waiting for, and he leaned into it, allowing Dean to lead him a ways down the side of the building.
“Uh, I guess because they are related to me, but that’s not really what you asked.” The girl tugged at her sleeve. “I know that I consider them my family because I love them, and although some days I’d rather have some distance between us, I wouldn’t want to live without them. I guess that I know they’re my family because I can tell that they feel the same way about me.”
Ok, next chapter: it's a fix-it for a certain episode. Since the next song album-order wise is called 'happiness,' I feel like you probably have a pretty good idea of which episode that may be. Ttly!
“Dean, the case.” Cas said slowly, the words stiff. He moved his face closer to Dean, watching his eyes for a hint that somewhere in there Dean was listening to him. Any sort of sign that Dean had brought Cas along because he’d wanted him around.
A tear ran down Dean’s cheek, leaving a red hot trail behind it. The air throbbed with adrenaline, with the promise of the end. A whooshing sound, like a weapon being positioned to strike, sounded from right above them. Dean tensed his shoulders. He counted silently backwards from ten. The world dropped away.
The holes in the shelf, little ones, perfectly circle, at the end of each panel, began to dig into Cas’s wrist. He leaned over more, trying to nudge the holes under his sleeve where they wouldn’t scratch at his skin. His arm, having been moved forwards about two inches too far, hit against a bag of cheddar cheese potato chips and tried to knock the whole row of them to the ground. Castiel leaned quickly to catch them all. They swished into his arm as if they felt sorry for him.
“No, not in pain, actually. More-” Dean struggled to find his words. “More like my adrenaline has been working way overtime. My hands won’t stop shaking, and my head is pounding like no one's business.”
lipstick to you, Dean? I must know. I still do not understand why they test it on the monkeys. I cannot think of a reason why lipstick would be a reasonable thing to put on monkeys, and I’ve devoted quite a bit of thought to it.
Dean moved his hand to cup behind Cas’s head, and brought their faces closer. He closed his eyes as their lips pressed together. Somewhere against the floor, Dean’s phone buzzed. He let it ring.
Careful footsteps alerted Dean to someone else’s presence in the room. He turned away from the window, brandishing his knife before him, ready to swing.
Cas frowned slightly. “They are planning to attack a corporate event in the penthouse on the Grisley building downtown. Yes, I know.”
Perhaps love was not always easy for the humans, but it was beautiful. It was as much art and poetry as anything that Castiel had ever seen them create. He could be happy for them, watching and never having. He could, he tried to convince himself, even be happy to watch Dean fall in love. Dean deserved love, even if it would break Castiel.
Dean shuffled his weight between his feet. The snow crunched, and even its gentle sound was sharp in the snow's blanketing quiet. Although there was a road right beside them, and although there were people in the rooms facing them, all Dean could hear was the soft falling of snow onto the ground, and all he could feel was alone. Unwatched. Only him and Cas existed; the rest had fallen away. Had been buried under the snow.
Sam bit his teeth into his lower lip, obviously fighting back a retort. “You aren’t going to find a fix today, then, can we agree on that? But there are people we can save right now, and cases that need our attention. Get yourself cleaned up, and come with me on a vamp hunt in Oklahoma. When we get back, you can look at the books with fresh eyes. It’ll help, even.”
“An angel with no juice, Cas,” Dean bit out through his teeth. He motioned with one hand towards Castiel, opened his mouth as if he was going to say something, but stopped himself. He crossed his arms over his chest, and dropped Cas’s gaze. “If you leave, I’ll be worried about you, and that’ll- it’ll… distract me. On hunts, okay? So you’re gonna stay here.”
Cas’s eyes strained from how wide he held them open as he tried to see everything. Each freckle and line on Dean’s face was so important, and deserved to be catalogued in Cas’s memory. His body tense, Cas lifted one hand and hovered it over Dean’s own, splayed beside him atop the blankets. Just one touch, just long enough for Cas to know if touching Dean would be as lovely as he imagined.
Dean’s expression had opened up into something like shock: his lips were parted and his eyes wide. His hand continued wiping at his demon knife, although the rag was coated and at this point he was mostly just smearing the blood back and forth.
The crashing of breaking glass alerted Dean to movement behind him. A vamp had climbed up onto the table, knocking over one of the white vases. It showed its eerie teeth and poised to leap at Dean. Dean held his blade up in front of himself, and dug his heel into the ground, ready.
“Other options,” Dean laughed in a short, joyless way. “Maybe in another life there would have been an option that ended with us together. Maybe.” He kicked his heel into the ground. To his left, the gravestone of an E.R. Ritchie watched their hushed argument with little sympathy. “I wish it was different,” Dean added quietly.
If he drove fast enough, turned the music up and focused on the feel of the steering wheel under his palms, Dean could make himself stay awake. It wasn’t too long until the next town, where the streetlights would force his eyes to stay open. It wasn’t too long until morning, or until the next place that sold caffeine.
Would Dean have cared if Cas hadn’t made it back? Surely he would have. He’d known how dangerous the task would be, and he’d  known that Cas was perfectly capable. Dean didn’t speak of it often, but he’d taken Cas’s deaths hard in the past. He wouldn’t have sent Cas down there to die. Dean wanted Cas alive, as family does.
The thing in his hand, the object he’d flirted his way into getting for free, was a tan cowboy hat, obviously made of plastic that was supposed to look like hay. It had a red band just above the rim. Castiel tilted his head, hardly containing the joy that flooded to his heart.
Sitting down on a stool, however, rebooted Dean’s brain once more. He’d unintentionally chosen the same stool he’d sat on before, and the missing presence of his case-partner became immediately apparent. Where had Cas gone? He’d said something about wasting time...
Dean's frozen fingers couldn't possible hold around Cas any tighter. “You don’t mean that, Cas,” Dean said. Snowflakes caught in his mouth as he spoke.
The beat of Death’s scythe hitting the ground echoed ominously with each step that she took towards them. It grew louder as she drew closer. While the Empty was looking for Cas, it was Dean that Death wanted. Dean’s back was open to the ceiling, the back of his neck completely vulnerable. Maybe he hadn’t thought his plan out the whole way through.
“What, because if you’d been around me as much as usual, you would have remembered who you actually want to be with?”
Dean pulled his wrist up and checked his watch violently. Five hours to go until the preparations would really begin. People had been in his house already even when he’d snuck out, setting up big white flower vases and turning all the lights on in the kitchen. “So what, Cas, you’re expecting me to run away with you? How d’ya think that’d go, really?”
Dean’s expression resembled too much the lazy grin that he employed before asking off-topic questions for him to have remembered the case. Cas stepped in to get them back on track himself. “Where did you last see your sister?”
The easy smile sitting on the woman’s face did nothing to quell the drop of discomfort that hit Dean as she said the words. The elevator suddenly felt much smaller, and void of air. Dean couldn’t put enough space between himself and Castiel.
His trench coat came slowly off of his shoulders, and he let it fall to the floor. It landed in a heap around his feet, patches of it darkening in the small puddles of water that had dripped over the sink. Castiel removed his suit jacket and button-up shirt in much the same way, trying to ignore the painful pull as he maneuvered his arms, and letting them all fall to the floor.
Humans found it odd, apparently, when Cas stood and stared at them for hours at a time. Unfortunately, at the moment,  there wasn’t really anything else for Cas to do. The motel room that Sam and Dean had rented was too small for Cas to go anywhere that wouldn’t point him staring in their direction. He’d sat himself on a chair in the corner—sitting was probably slightly less odd than standing. Cas still watched Dean. He didn’t understand how more humans didn’t want to leave their attention on one another for hours at a time; they were always moving, onto the next thing. Cas could watch Dean all day.
“Okay, maybe it does look a bit tacky like that,” Dean moved closer to pull the red band from the hat, balling it up and shoving it into his pocket. Their chests were nearly touching. “Alright, that’s better,” he breathed.
His throat was raw as he drove the Impala back, the trailer bobbing behind and reminding him, at each turn and each bump, of his failure. Of his misery. He’d ignored Sam’s attempt at a conversation upon returning to the bunker. He’d locked the door to his bedroom and fallen onto his bed and had stayed like that for some amount of days.
“It’s me” the angel assured him. “Well, more or less.” Cas looked around him. “It’s interesting that you’d choose the barn” he added.  That confused Dean, for a moment, but then understanding dawned.
He rolled that idea around in his head, trying to wrap his brain around it. He expected to feel the weight of regret over his delayed realization, or an abiding sorrow over Cas’ death – or whatever it was. And those things did hurt, deeply. But to his shock, they were tempered by a sense of peace.
It was a promising start to what turned into a shit-tacular evening. They'd had a few drinks over the next hour, and then Dean found himself in the kind of cheap motel he knew so well. They kissed frantically, and made their way toward the bed, shedding clothes as they went. It should have been amazing, but the more Dean tried to get into it, into her, the more he felt removed from the situation.  Eventually he found himself naked on his back, as she kissed her way down his chest....only to find him less than ready. And the more she tried to arouse him, the less he was able to respond.  After several minutes, she paused, and sat up in bed.
Cas’s hand had moved on from Dean’s hair to rub soothing circles into his back. “You would have come all this way just to say goodbye?”
He arrived next to Cas just as the angel sliced the head from a second vampire. Dean blocked an attack at Cas from behind. The vampire grabbed Dean by the shoulder, pulling him forwards. Dean ducked out of its grasp and used his momentum to spring back up and cut its head from its shoulders. He killed his second one easily moments after.
“Hey, buddy,” Dean said softly. He ran his knuckles up and down Castiel’s back, bumping them gently along his spine. “Take it easy? Ok? Let me do the heavy lifting, huh?”
“As I was saying,” Sam continued carefully, “I’ve been cleaning out Cas’s room. He didn’t keep many possessions. Actually,” Sam motioned to the badge, “that was about the only thing there. I thought maybe you’d want to keep it.”
Again, Dean looked to Sam for an assist and immediately regretted it. This time, Sam’s apologetic look was back, joined now by something like humour. Dean wanted to slap the look off of his face. He continued talking instead. “Charlie managed to hack into the system and get us one invitation, but,”
: Jealous Cas tries to stop Dean from flirting with a barista while they work a case. Light Angst. CC.
“I’m sorry I doubted you, Dean,” Cas said, making sure that his eyes were locked with Dean’s the entire time.
For a moment, with his body heaped onto clifftop, Castiel couldn’t move. His fingers tangled in the short, sparse grass underneath him, his face pressing into the ground. Each breath that he took rattled into his lungs like it would be his last. What had he been fighting so hard for? The ocean below crashed loudly against the cliff face. Seagulls called from overhead. Would it be so terrible, to just lie here a while?
“So we’re all good to go, then?” Dean finished wiping his knife clean, and quickly concealed it before any of the party goers noticed.
If Dean was dead, it would be Castiel’s fault. There was no one else to blame. Castiel would do whatever he could to bring Dean back, even if it meant sacrificing himself. Especially if it meant sacrificing himself. They would be better, safer, without him.
“We’re not here for party games.” There was no way Dean was letting anyone get that close to him, especially not someone who couldn’t tell a human from a Christmas tree.
“Oh,” Cas said, buying time. Here it was, the wedge sliding back in between them. He knew what Dean was referring to, and had been anticipating this line of conversation; the memory of that snap decision tugged at his mind just as his cuts tugged at his body. “The demon in the woman’s vessel, with the brown hair...”
The weariness of Dean’s arms and the rush of air in and out of his lungs as he worked nearly clouded his mind. He nearly forgot how much he hated himself for allowing this to happen to Cas, when Cas and Sam had found a solution for Dean’s plan to lock himself in the box. With the effort of moving the Ma’lak box into place, he nearly saw himself as a person again, instead of this worthless, incapable failed thing which was letting Cas give up on himself.
Now, after working his way through many more relationships, Dean understood that what he’d determined as the fizzling out of his and Castiel’s relationship had really been the beginnings of comfort and true familiarity. When he’d been younger, he’d been too quickly bored. He’d given Castiel up for the next shiny thing that had passed in front of him.
“Dean,” Cas said hoarsely from underneath him. He’d wrapped one arm around Dean’s chest, and one leg had looped around Dean’s knee. Cas was trying to flip him onto his side. Dean leaned heavily against him. As long as Cas was hidden from the Empty, Dean wasn’t giving up.
It’s easy, when in the presence of something as beautiful as that, to forget everything that has gone wrong. Is it terrible, to occupy my mind with the world’s beauty when I was almost the one to destroy it? When I could still be the one to destroy it? I have messed everything up, and I don’t even know how it happened. I don’t believe that any of this pain was ever my intention. I was trying, well, what I was trying to do is not important anymore.
He walked slowly back to the table, taking his sweet time, the bastard. Dean held his breath as he waited, using his thoughts to send threats to the star should it feel like making any attempt towards the ground.
: It's the morning of Dean's wedding, and Castiel, the best man, is not at all in favor of the union. Angst. AU.
Dean dropped his head into his hands, squeezing his eyes shut as the pain throbbed. Cas lowered himself down beside him, his rings clinking against the pavement when he put his weight onto his hand. The morning was still hours away.
‘That can’t be a thing.” Dean grumbled as he pulled the Impala out of the parking lot. He continued complaining, seemingly set to do so for the rest of the drive. But when his eyes landed on Cas in the rear view mirror, sliding up to the cowboy hat that Cas hadn’t removed, Dean’s lips stretched into a grin and stilled. He didn’t speak again for the rest of the drive, only humming pleasantly along to the music. Cas caught his eyes flicking across the rear-view mirror plenty more times, and if he wasn't certain Dean could drive while somewhat distracted (as he'd done it many times before), Cas would have told him to pay more attention to the road.
“I wouldn’t have it any other way.” Dean said. He’d moved half way across the bar before Cas realized that they were actually going to sit down and have a drink. Cas stepped into the building from the doorway, and caught up to Dean.
And to think—Cas breathed out a rough laugh—to think that Dean may have wanted Cas around for any reason other than his help. As Cas spent time wondering what he meant to Dean, so did every human spend time thinking the same thing. Cas would be a fool to consider the future where Dean picked him out of every other countless option.
“We don’t,” Cas said simply. He’d stood as well, and was making his way towards the open door. He began clearing the smudged sigil off of the door panel.
The heavy coarse material of his trench coat, with the added weight from the sea spray, was nearly dragging him down on its own. Castiel shook one hand away from the rocks, moving his shoulder around in an attempt to remove the sleeve. He used the rock wall to brush against, forcing the coat off of his one side. He had to push hard to force the material off of him, it being sticky and wet. He shoved his shoulder against the rocks until he was sure they would leave red marks.
“I’m s-” Dean blew an exasperated sigh out through pursed lips. He pulled back off the bed, only enough to breathe freely again, not raising his eyes. “I shouldn’t have asked you to wait for me. I can’t believe you wasted your whole life waiting-”
“They had a history.” Cas said, emphasizing each word breathily. “If it were me in Sam’s position, I would have wanted a chance to see her.”
If the angels were to capture Dean, to have him in their grasp with the possibility of killing him, Cas would beg them for the chance to say goodbye. He couldn’t strip that from Sam, the possibility of speaking once more to someone that he’d long had to leave behind. He couldn’t be the jury and executioner for a story that he had no real part in.
Dean and Cas had solved the case and killed the monster by the next day. They made a crack team. When they returned, Sam stopped himself from making jokes at their expense the best he could. He stopped himself from laughing when a waitress mistook them for a couple, and he didn’t say anything when Dean fell asleep with his head on Cas’s shoulder in the Dean Cave.
“My true form.” Cas repeated. “You forget that I am, above all else, an angel of the Lord. There are rules for me to follow, standards I should uphold.” His hand slipped slightly away. “Standards that do not include accompanying you on a hunt.”
Alrighty, next chapter will be an AU which I am SO excited to share with you! No more hints bc idk how to describe it more w/o giving it away. Thanks for reading!
That wasn’t the reaction that Cas had been expecting after being caught sneaking onto Dean’s bed. He would have expected yelling, maybe, or no words and tense space kept between them for days. In his surprise, Cas nearly fell from the bed. Catching himself, he moved shakily to standing. His hand darted forwards to fix Dean’s blanket where it had been tugged down, and Dean caught Cas’s wrist. His grasp around it was tight, as if he actually wanted Cas to stay.
Next chapter, Castiel tries to live in the moment and Dean attempts to leave a store without paying for his item.
As soon as Dean had seen Cas walking through the cemetery, all that he’d managed to convince himself about that future had gone up in smoke. He thought he’d be able to have Cas at the wedding, with everyone else around. They hadn’t been supposed to be alone, in Dean’s bedroom. Cas wasn’t supposed to have put on the veil, to look so long, unblinking, into Dean’s eyes.
He closed the door softly behind himself. Outside, a sharp gust of wind cut through him, rushing like a current under the motel’s awning. Surely, this kind of wind would make a human cold. He would need to make sure that Dean wore his coat when they left in the morning.
“Like I said I would.” Dean pulled his hand out from under Castiel’s and instead used it to cover his own face. He’d told Castiel, all those years ago, to wait for him. Dean’s big break—a fancy big-time lawyer gig in New York—had pulled them apart. And Dean hadn’t even considered turning it down. Hell, he’d been happy to get some time away from Castiel.
Should. Would have been able to without a doubt if he hadn’t lost most of his grace. If he hadn’t allowed himself to become so weak.
And the barista… why was she looking at Dean like that? Her eyes tracked his every movement, returning often to his lips and his hands. She had pulled a strand of hair from her ponytail forwards so that it framed her cheek, and she let it sway forwards and then back as she leaned over to pour drinks. Her cheeks were slightly pinker than they had been before.
“I haven’t told you,” Dean started. He toed the sleeve of his jacket again. “I don’t need to sleep tonight. I didn’t tell you, but, I’m tellin’ you now. I’m not tired, so we-” his mouth stopped moving. Dean swore he’d had more of a point when he’d opened it in the first place.
Cas set his elbow on the arm rest, and bent his head so that his fingers could run easily through his own hair. He watched Dean, unblinking. He made himself breath at the same rhythm as the rise and fall of Dean’s chest. He pulled his hand from his hair, tracing it down his neck and onto his own collarbone atop his clothing. He imagined Dean’s skin beneath his hand, how it would be warm and smooth.
“Uh,” Cas looked down to watch his feet as he stepped up the stairs into the bus. He held the fifty dollar bill out to the driver.
“Yeah. Um,” Dean’s hair was wet, and his hands were freezing. He had no idea what Cas was apologizing for. The snow was only snow, only frozen water, only weather. Dean stepped back again, starting towards the hotel entrance. “I-”
Dean’s efforts at entertaining himself at the expense of Sam had increased exponentially lately. It was because Dean was avoiding Cas and trying to keep his mind off of it, but if Dean realized what he was doing, he’d certainly never acknowledge it.
Cas smiled at the girl, and found her smiling back, both slightly hesitant. “Thank yo-” Cas started, his words cut off by a loud grinding sound, and a violent shifting of the bus sideways. Cas’s hand flew forwards to hold on to the girl as the bus shook and continued swinging sideways.
Cas was close enough for Dean to hear his breathing. Dean was overwhelmed by a whole new spinning sensation as he eyed the reflection of the Christmas lights in the glass door. He ended up passing his phone to Cas for the invitation, while Dean’s mind rebooted. Too many bright lights around him for him to think straight.
Dean licked his lips, and dropped his gaze to the drink she had poured for him. Cas slid off of his bar stool and fixed his trench coat around his shoulders. Dean only noticed him when he started to walk away.
Castiel had been asked to watch over Dean. He’d been asked to do many other things, and failed on most accounts, but protecting Dean, keeping Dean alive, was the one responsibility that Castiel would never abandon.
Castiel couldn’t let himself forget what he was: an angel of the Lord; Castiel was anything but fragile and needy. He could never be loved by something as vital and human as Dean. He was fairly certain that he’d never been loved at all. Angels, he’d long told himself, were just not meant for love. That was something that had been created afterwards. Angels, he had to believe, were built only to serve. Devotion was loyalty and commitment, but it wasn’t love.
She watched him with undivided attention, her hands collected in front of her and her lips slightly open. She watched him like she wanted to give him all of the shots in the world, if they would make him happy. Like the shots were filled with gold, or bottled laughter, or anything else that would drive the fear and trauma from Dean’s tired eyes.
This was... fluff? I wrote something with more fluff than angst?? Wow guys, better enjoy it while it lasts.
Relieved to finally be alone again, Dean flicked the TV back on. His eyes kept straying, for whatever reason, towards Cas’s picture on his ID card. Dean flipped the card over. He forced himself to pay attention to the TV. If the first person he thought of when the jokes made him laugh was the same person whose ID badge he was steadfastly ignoring, that was only a coincidence.
Dean smiled into the kiss. He was so light he could have been floating. Happiness. He realized, this was happiness. He’d missed it for so long.
“Cas,” Dean repeated. He’d pushed himself up to his elbow, and seemed much more awake than he had only seconds ago. “Where're you going?”
Next chapter, as promised, will be a follow-up to chapter 4. What happens after Cas gets jealous and runs away in the middle of a hunt?
A slight weight landed on Cas’s lap, and he clutched at it with his free hand. The material of his trench coat scratched against his fingers. The girl had returned it to him.
Sam pivoted in a slow circle in the center of Cas’s bedroom. If he were an ex-angel of the Lord trying to hide something from his adopted-family of humans, where would he choose? With Dean’s letter tucked into his back pocket, Sam pulled drawer after drawer from Cas’s dresser, each time met only by the dusty bottom of an empty space.
“'You will never be lovelier than you are now. We will never be here again,’” Cas said. “Homer. Ἰλιάς. The Iliad.”
“The pie!” Dean grinned, catching Cas by the hand as he walked on towards the table. ‘Now, tell me which one you were going to get me, and I’ll tell you how poor your taste is.”
Dean touched his hands greedily to the world around him, trying to determine where Cas had dropped him. Into the Impala, he realized. His hands had found her steering wheel. Something small was pressed between Dean’s thigh and the seat—he shifted his weight to grab it, and found that Cas had managed to transport Dean’s phone back with him as well.
“You’re wasting your… with me?” Dean’s fingers slid away from the still-full shot glass, and he turned on his bar stool towards Cas. For a second, Cas thought that Dean would ask him to stay, like he had at the restaurant. Instead, the barista returned and asked Dean what he was waiting for. Dean turned around and picked up the shot, drinking it under the mesmerized gaze of the barista.
The letter in Sam’s grasp now was older than the first, marked in the top corner as written in 2012 — the year after Cas had released the Leviathans and they had taken over his body. Dean had been broken after Cas’s death then, too. He’d lugged Cas’s dirty trench coat around with him, moving it into the trunk of each new car they drove.
“Occasionally,” the barista said smoothly, “men tumble through those doors lookin’ like they made a wrong turn on the way back to Heaven.”
“What the Hell happened? It looks like Santa Claus threw up all over this place,” Dean said as he closed his door behind him.
“What situation? The vampire nest? I’m sure you don’t need to worry, Dean. The tip said that it was only a few vampires.”  Cas’s low voice sounded from close beside them. Dean turned immediately, tugging his hands behind his back as if he had something to hide, to face the angel.
Castiel’s eyes had been wide open, filled with bright joy, as he’d asked Dean to repeat what he’d said.
The washcloth came back dripping red after a few swipes, and Castiel rang it out over the sink. He ran the tap water until all the blood had washed away down the drain. He squeezed the cloth in his fist, letting beads of water run over his knuckles. He raised his gaze to meet his own eyes in the mirror.
Cas leaned his own elbow against an empty spot on one of the metal shelves, tilting his head to position his gaze. He let his attention to Dean’s every move play obviously, unbothered. If any of the few other customers in the store noticed his staring, they would surely only follow his gaze and commence in staring, themselves.
How had they gotten to this loveless place? It wasn’t entirely either party's fault, Cas told himself. Dean had obviously shifted all the blame onto Castiel, unwilling to listen to Cas’s arguments that he’d only ever tried to do the right thing. Dean had always been stubborn. It was endearing when it wasn’t directed at you.
Without raising his gaze from the blankets, Cas began to move off of the bed. His attention snapped to his own hand. Something warm and solid had pressed on top of it.
I have gone off track. I apologize. I have so much to apologize for, don’t I. Here’s one more thing to add to the pile, then: I’m sorry that I love you. I haven’t allowed myself to write it out until now. There it is, now. Words on a page.
While on the way to Dean’s room, Sam’s attention was pulled towards the only ajar bedroom door — Castiel’s, left open in his haste, no doubt, to follow Dean out of the bunker that morning. With Dean’s folded letter pulling him forwards like some sort of homing device, Sam entered Cas’s room. He was met, as expected, by nothing.
Her fingers worked in tandem with her mouth, drawing the bow of Cass’s arousal ever tighter, until finally, it snapped. Cass’s head thrashed and then she cried out, hips jerking up off the floor as she ground her cunt toward Deanna’s face. Deanna worked her fingers deeper—even adding a third to heighten the pleasure—and sucked harder, until Cass was nearly screaming as her orgasm crashed over her in wave after wave of bliss.
"Fuck, didn't know how bad I wanted this," Dean said as he captured Cas's cock in his hand for the first time, thrilling at the heat and hardness of it in his hand.
“Did you call me ‘my love?’” Dean asked softly, pulling Cas close again. His gaze dropped to Castiel’s lips and he licked his own. “I thought you would hate me... because I love you, Cas. I’m so in love with you I can’t stand it.”
His ankle hit against something soft, and Castiel nearly toppled over onto Dean’s body. He managed to angle himself to fall to Dean’s side, bringing one hand at once to ghost over Dean’s wrist, checking for his pulse, and the other hand finding his mouth to feel for breaths.
“Good, he’s got the just of it.” Dean opened his hands to his sides, turning to face Sam. Sam narrowed his eyes. “Fine.” Dean tightened his jaw and pointed his gaze back towards Castiel. “The party, uh, it’s difficult to get an invitation to, so...”
Apology after apology fell from Dean’s lips as he completed the unthinkable, unable to stop the “sorry, Cas. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” Castiel didn’t ask him to stop. He didn’t speak at all. He took his sentence silently, stoically. He'd held his hand to Dean’s shoulder from inside the box, his eyes dry and emotionless, but his fingers tight enough to leave a bruise. Dean’s own eyes had dripped tears onto Cas’s chest. He’d nuzzled his cheek into Castiel’s hand. He’d apologized, and he’d apologized again as he’d closed the box.
“Back then you called me ‘Cas’.” Castiel ran a light finger down Dean’s arm, asking silently for Dean to lower his hand back to him. Dean complied and placed his hand down to rest beside Castiel’s atop his blankets. Castiel slipped his fingers loosely between Dean’s.
Cas kicked his foot against the pavement, hitting a pebble and sending it scurrying sideways. The pebble came to a bouncing stop against the base of a thin metallic pole. A bus stop sign, Cas realized as his eyes followed it upwards. He’d found a bus stop.
He took a step back once he’d finished, letting the door to the ice box drop closed with a thump. The ice bucket fell from Cas’s hand seconds later, clanging against the concrete. It had slipped out of his fingers, urged on by the ripple of the closing door. Cas kneeled to the ground, shoving the spilled ice back into the bucket until it was nearly as full as it had been before. He straightened up and held his hand over the top of the bucket.
don’t want to believe that that’s goodbye. I couldn’t watch as I threw the lighter, either. We’ll find a way to bring him back, and all the rest of them too. We’ve done harder things before. If we can fight God, Hell, we can bring Cas back.
Castiel hadn’t been a big fan of the classics to begin with. The first thing he’d ever said about rock music had been that their ‘voices sounded unpleasant.’ With time, and many forced listening sessions to learn to appreciate it, Cas had come around. The first time Dean had caught Cas singing along to one of his records had been on a lazy sunday evening, back when Dean had still lived in the crappy little apartment on Laszlo Street. His couch had taken up nearly the entire living room. Dean had left Cas to grab them both a drink. He’d come back to Cas stretched out with his head on the arm of the couch, eyes closed, singing softly to “Whole Lotta Love.”
The alleyway had exploded into light, illuminated by the glowing, changing form. Even the trash bags and litter scattered and wet against the concrete shone as if they were holy. The grimy walls reflected a white glow, as if they were at once clean. The puddles in the pavement glittered like white gold, and the raindrops transformed into jewels as they fell through the air.
As Cas took his damn sweet time, Dean’s teeth worked into his lip until he almost made it bleed. His foot tapped back and back against the tree. He threw his arms up as Castiel finally approached, hissing “I told you 7:10 am.”
In the letter, Castiel did not seem to hold any grudge. Although Sam doubted he truly ever could, with Dean. The letter read:
As Dean’s eyes adjusted, he noticed the scrawl of graffiti along the grimy walls, and the trash bags thrown outside of closed and barred doors. He thought that maybe he could pick out the line of light where the alleyway came to an end, but he blinked and it was gone.
, and when Dean’s mouth stayed shut, he let the veil fall over his head. He tugged it gently into place, the longer back section with the details in lace and jewels, and the lighter fabric laying over his face.
The worst thing was that the room, realistically, wouldn’t even look that different. Cas hadn’t slept, so his bed had always been unused, and he’d hardly had any possessions to either leave behind or take with him. The only real difference would be the knowing that Cas was truly gone.
“We were gettin’ torn to bits out there, Cas. After they used the sigil to blow you away, Sam and I hardly got out,” Dean cut in. He’d managed to regain control of his expression, although the worry line in the center of his brown had yet to smooth out. “How’d you make it through? You were pretty bloodied up.”
Castiel cupped Dean’s cheek with his hand, the newly returned rings like the blunt edge of a knife where they touched his skin. “Then, my love, we must find something of mine that you can keep for yourself. Thank you for taking such good care of mine.” He trailed his nails lightly against Dean’s jaw as he pulled him in for another kiss. He broke it off after only seconds, dropping his hand to entwine with Dean’s once more. “I would like to go for a walk. Care to join?”
Have you seen the flowers? This time of year, I have found, they are at their most glorious. The red ones, in the garden of the hospital, they have five petals each. The petals are yellow on the inside. I would have never noticed it, because you can’t tell unless you’re looking right down into them. I was following a bee, a great bit one, all yellow, and it landed in one of those flowers. How lucky! I looked right down on into it, and I saw the bright yellow smiling back up at me, like the kind, bright summer sun.
The barista placed them in the center of the bar. The barstool Cas sat on was stiff and squeaky if he tried to turn; he’d mistakenly tried to rest his elbows against the bar top, and now the sleeves of his trench coat were sticky. The bear bottle that had ended up in front of him seemed to taunt him.
“I hope so.” She stepped back from him, holding him by the shoulders and she moved to meet his gaze. “I’ve heard that today is supposed to be the happiest day of our lives.”
Castiel’s voice floated through the closed door, speaking sweetly. He’d moved closer. His words were hard to make out, his deep voice not made to break through walls. The sound of Lisa’s answer, then her light footsteps towards the side door, the thing sliding open, and then coming closed once more was enough information for Dean to get by on.
Judging from the sandwich that Sam had shoved towards him about half an hour ago, it was more likely closer to lunch time than midnight. Dean eyed the sandwich, with its green lettuce leaves sticking out, and pushed it to the edge of the table with the tips of his fingers. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt hungry, and he certainly didn’t feel so now.
His pockets produced a handful of coins—mostly pennies and dimes—as well as a fifty dollar bill. One of those options ought to do. He decided to wait for a few hours, and if the bus hadn’t come by then, perhaps he would have thought of somewhere to go on his own.
“Is it so terrible to be human?” Dean asked. Cas’s trench coat billowed around him in the breeze, drawing Dean’s eyes. “Most of the angels I know are dicks, Cas. Do you really wanna be like them?”
“I’m-” Cas mumbled. He’d been caught, and like the idiot that he was, he hadn’t thought to come up with any excuse. “I didn’t mean to wake you.” Cas pulled his hand away from beneath Deans, and it hurt like an angel blade to the heart. He started to push himself off the bed.
When the bus stopped at a red light, Cas lifted himself from his seat and moved carefully towards the girl. He sat back down two seats away from her, and held out his coat.
“What do ya’ mean by that?” Dean’s hand trailed over the bar towards Cas, and Cas felt himself leaning towards it. Dean didn’t reach for him though; his fingers found Cas’s untouched beer bottle and pulled it over to himself.
Dean’s hands found their way onto Cas’s shoulders, wider and taller than Lisa’s. He drifted them up towards Castiel’s face, hiking up the veil, scrunching it in a way that he was sure, in the back of his brain, he wasn’t supposed to do. He placed one palm onto Cas’s exposed cheek, feeling the scratch of his stubble and the cut of his jaw bone.
The splattering of blood across his cheekbones, he determined, was only splashes from other injuries. Cas wet a washcloth under the tap and brushed it over his cheeks, the course material pricking his skin. His scrubbed until his face was red, long after the blood had been washed away.
“I think they’re pretty.” Cas stood still, scanning his eyes over the Christmas lights as he waited for Dean to finish. The colours from the Christmas lights reflected in Cas’s blue eyes like stars from another planet, giving his whole face a youthful, wonderstruck glow. Perhaps Dean could grow to like the city’s holiday décor after all.
Puddles formed between the cracks in the pavement, and Dean’s eyes had become glued to the ground in an attempt to save his shoes when he caught a glimpse of something fluttering and beige out of the corner of his eye. Lifting a hand to shield his face from the rain, Dean peered across the road and down a side alley. If he wasn’t mistaken, someone was standing against the shadowed walls. Someone in a trench coat.
The wind whipped against Castiel’s face, cracking through his lips and forcing a taste of the ocean into his lungs. He coughed, ducking his chin towards his chest, while he shook his arm where the coat was still clinging to him. Eyes closed, Castiel turned his face to press one cheek to the cliff face, shielding the most of himself that he could. One hand clinging to the rocks until his fingers were numb, he shook the other arm out violently beside him. The sleeve of the coat slowly, brutally fell towards his wrist.
Snow. The tiredness that Dean had been trying to force away receded on its own. He spun away from the window, grabbed at Cas, at his wrist at his waist. Or he imagined doing so. Dean had really only stood against the window, his arms stuck against his sides. Cas was still over between the beds where he’d turned the lamp off. Dean took a steadying breath through his lips.
“Oh.” Dean raised his gaze towards Sam and scanned his face for the signs of excitement or anticipation that usually showed when he’d found them a case. “Did you find something?”
Dean brought his hand back towards himself, and flipped over to lay his head on his pillow. Staring at the ceiling, Dean’s memory supplied him with replay after replay of Cas’s face as he’d turned to look one last time. Cas’s eyes, always large and sad, had appeared especially sad, especially sorry. His eyebrows had been turned up, as if he’d been asking a question.
“Shit, Cas. How'd this happen?” Dean doubled over, his hands on his knees. His headache had returned, and his head felt like it was about to spit in two. Beside him, Cas knelt to the ground. Dean followed his eyeline to the splotches of dark blood in a line down the sidewalk.
Castiel smiled with half of his mouth. It was an expression that he’d learned from Dean, and it always caught Dean off guard. “You mean what did I do to them? They are weak, Dean; Heaven grows weaker everyday. Blood was running through the halls, I had to wade through it like a stream. They are losing.”
Cas didn’t give Dean the chance to turn around; he walked past Dean, stopping in front of the rectangular window and spinning the rod until the shutters were as wide as they would go. Cas pressed his face towards the glass. His dark hair was mused in the back; he'd been sitting in the Impala with one elbow up, wrist angled down, his hands splayed over the back of his skull. Apparently, he’d been trying to tie as many knots into his hair as possible.
He lifted his beer bottle to his lips, unsatisfied by the few drops that dripped down. The empty bottle ended up on the ground a few feet away, split into three pieces. Dean didn’t remember choosing to throw it. He debated rising to clean it up, but his legs felt numb underneath him, and besides, he wasn’t even sure where the broom was.
“You said it yourself, Dean: I can’t be trusted to make the right choices. I’ve changed. I couldn’t even smite a demon because of some… emotional hang up.”
Castiel’s head fell to the side, his sad eyes bearing into Dean’s own. “There is something viscous inside of me, worse than the leviathans. Worse than Lucifer. I can feel it taking over my brain, not just making decisions, but altering my own.” His hands rattled the angel cuffs as he moved ever so slightly closer to the freshly dug grave. “I don’t know if ‘that point’ will come slowly or all at once. And I’m not willing to take that chance. Not with you.”
“I can’t,” Dean said. “I can’t say that, okay?” He let his head fall forwards, resting it in the crook of Castiel’s neck. The veil tickled against his ear. “But I have to do this anyways.”
The case in Iowa, which was decidedly weird enough to warrant an extra news article or two, really didn’t need Sam staying behind to conduct research from the bench. He’d agreed to stay more out of a want to do so than the belief that it was the most useful place for him to be. He probably wouldn’t have stayed -- would have just lugged an extra book or two into the car before leaving with the others -- if he hadn't thought he was helping Cas and Dean out by staying back, as well.
The smile lines on the outside of Dean’s eyes deepened. He took the box from Cas’s hand and waved it to the cashier, “perfect fit for an angel, don’t you think?” He called to her, causing her to blush once more and nod her head. She would think, Cas assumed, that Dean was referencing her. He and Dean, however, both knew that when Dean said “angel,” there was only one person he was talking about.
“That’s not true, Cas.” Dean tried to stand, but his legs felt bloodless underneath him. “You have me.”
“Is it?” Cas tried to catch a glimpse of himself reflecting off the metal siding. “I’m your huckleberry,” he murmured to himself, repeating a line from one of those cowboy movies. He turned back to Dean in time to watch his Adam's apple bob as he swallowed thickly.
Sam held the letter between his fingers as he walked the distance between the library and Dean’s bedroom. He meant to return the letter to Dean, both to save his brother from having someone else find his despairing ramblings, and to give himself the opportunity to make fun of Dean to his face about it. If Dean and Cas were going to put Sam in the middle of their unspoken feelings, then the most Sam could do was create some amusement for himself from it. He wasn’t allowed to
The position, from someone else’s perspective, may have looked like that of a drunk man trying to steady his headache. Certainly, from the empty bottles littering the table, it would be an easy assumption to make. But Dean knew, and he was sure that Sam would recognize as well, that Dean had taken the posture to pray to Castiel.
“It’s ok, Cas. We’ll talk about it later.” He nodded his head dismissively before turning back towards the barista.
Castiel frantically drew himself up off of the ground, stumbling onto his feet. His whole body protested the movement, aching and tired. Through the moonlight, he pushed forwards, fighting against himself, fighting to stay awake. He listened for the voice, but it didn’t come again. He moved towards where he’d watched Dean go down, heart spiking in fearful anticipation.
Cas made it, wavering on his shaky legs, through the corridor. Seeing no one, he thought he might even manage to leave without having to explain himself, but the hope was swiftly betrayed when Dean called out to him from the kitchen. Cas’s shoulders tightened, and he fought the urge to continue forwards. He turned around to face Dean, bracing himself against the kitchen doorway.
It wasn’t that Sam didn’t trust Cas. On the contrary, he would trust the angel with his life. He was, currently, trusting him with Dean’s. However, it hadn’t been so very long since Castiel had stolen the colt right from under Dean’s pillow because he'd believed that he was doing the right thing. Cas’s heart was always in the right place, whereas his choices, occasionally, were misguided.
Sam had been caught up helping a few other hunters out with a pack of werewolves near the bunker. So Cas, like an afterthought, had been asked to accompany Dean with the missing girl’s case. Dean had asked him to go as if he hadn’t really cared whether Cas would say yes or no.
“Are you sure you’re ready, Cas? There must… We can wait a few more weeks. Keep looking for another way.” Dean let his shovel fall to the ground, its metal clinking against stray pebbles in the dirt. He wiped his arm across his brown to catch at the beads of sweat.
Dean’s body was stiff where it lay against the cold ground. Castiel placed one hand on either of Dean’s shoulders, sending one leg over top of him so that he straddled Dean’s torso. He slid his hands over Dean’s chest, feeling more than seeing the torn fabric, the sticky blood from his wounds, and underneath that, the shallow rise and fall of each breath.
What do I do now? So many of my people have died, but it’s never felt like this. I don’t know. I don’t know why I
Sam’s face shone darkly near the bottom, something covering or dripping from his mouth. His wild eyes caught Dean’s only for a moment, before he bolted in the opposite direction.
The waitress’s dull eyes were open towards the ceiling. Dean shuttered as he finished stepping past her body. He’d almost had to kiss the thing—not that it would have been so terrible to kiss the waitress—but the thing wearing her face, he didn’t ever want to be that close to.
“So we can keep goin’,” Dean added quickly. He leaned forwards with one shoulder over the bed to squeeze the collar of his leather jacket between two fingers. He could put it back on, they could get back in the Impala.
Ah, it had been opened by Dean, who now stood half-in and half out of the store, face turned to Castiel, grin stretched across his face, his “purchase” held tightly in one hand. Castiel felt his lips move to reciprocate the smile. He found his feet taking a step forward.
“Do you remember when you took my angel blades away?” Castiel didn’t wait for an answer. “I hardly let you. I wanted to kill Sam over them, over him taking them from me. Even without them, there are too many ways that I could hurt you, too many ways that I could hurt all of you and not even think twice.”
I will always be here if you need me. For as long as you want. As long as I can. If you need me, call out for me and I will come. Otherwise, I will leave you alone. You deserve to have me leave you alone. I have destroyed everything, Dean. I am sure that I will only do it again. I killed so many souls, so many angels. I feel their absence like a hole inside of me. When I took on Sam’s burden, it only magnified my pain. It showed me how much of a monster I became. I have no idea how you can even look at me. You saved me from a life of not being myself, and in doing so returned me to you. Do you regret it? I understand why you left me at the hospital; I wouldn’t have wanted to stay with me, either.
against the metal. That was the last apology he would give. It wasn’t his responsibility to apologize for the same thing a hundred times, and not his fault that it kept falling on deaf ears.
“Oh no, not at all! Most people arrived early. I wasn’t expecting to greet you at the door, but I just so happened to check as you arrived.” The woman paused as the elevator doors opened. Dean felt Cas’s arm in his pull as Cas began to move, but the woman stopped them. They still had many more floors to climb.
“Sam?” The word fell from Dean’s open lips. He dropped his fists, began running towards his brother. “Sam!”
When we burned his body I think I forgot to breathe. I don’t remember the smell of the smoke, or of the gasoline. I think of that night and it’s just his limp body in that curtain, how I had to tie him and leave him atop the pyre. I couldn’t even look at him, lying there on the kitchen table. I couldn’t look at his dead body. Couldn’t believe it was him, even though I saw him die. Fuck. I saw him die. That’s burned into my brain like a constant reminder. I don’t remember watching him burn. I only remember this knowing that he was gone, like a noise in the back of my head. He’s gone. He’s gone.
Cas’s face melted into an apologetic grin. The otherness that had surrounded him, the power and strength that had been wafting off of his presence, seemed to blow away with the wind until he felt like Cas again, like the bee-loving, Netflix-watching, awkward human-angel that Dean had grown to know. He lifted one hand towards Dean’s forehead, offered him a shy smile, and zapped them both from the alleyway.
