Bruce's voice jolted him out of his thoughts. They were ready for him. Bucky and Sam stood off to the side, looking at him with concerned eyes.
“You can trust me, Tony,” Steve said.
His breath hitched when the courtesan blinked up at him. The kohl made his eyes more prominent and so soft; doe's eyes. This close, Steve could see flecks of gold in them and his hands itched for his paints and canvas.
Steve held down the clutch and pushed the start button and with a beautiful, satisfying purr, his bike roared back to life.
“No, it’s not, quite frankly. It’s American business.”
“Forget about him,” Tony said. “It’s still your day, and I, for one, am ready to see the rest of Brooke’s famous game park. What are we waiting for?”
The circumstances were different, but he didn’t want to take his or the Barnes’ chances with Madam Natalia.
Idly, Tony realizes this is the first time they've messed around in an actual bedroom, especially
“I learned from the best,” JARVIS sniffed. “Mr. Stark himself can be quite persuasive when he wants to be.
“Does Tony have any food in his kitchen?”
fine; his heart was a battering ram, banging against his ribcage with a skull rattling force that had Tony wheezing.
He shook his head. “They’re not just machines, Pep. They’re a part of me.”
Looking back on it, 2012 had been the birth of something new. The birth of something
. Oh, God. Oh,
"Do you want me to beg for you, is that it? Is that what gets you hard? Having a man at your mercy?" The words tumbled forth from Steve's mouth unbidden, and gods was he prepared to beg.
Pepper let out a laugh that had Tony’s heart racing. “No, I wouldn’t know.”
“…Yes?”
. And
Tony leans into his side. Steve stiffens, and for a moment, Tony thinks he made the wrong move, but then Steve slowly, almost like Tony's going to scamper off, wraps his arm around Tony's waist. His palm is hot against his side. The warmth seeps into his skin through the thin fabric of his shirt.
, Shellhead, are going to take yourself a nice, long nap.”
Tony flushes and takes a sip from his hot chocolate to cover himself—and buy himself time. The chocolate soothes his nerves a bit, and Tony tells him what to type in. Steve's eyes light up at the results, nearly thousands of posts, thousands of works of art that people, young and old alike, poured their hearts into, and Tony wishes he had his phone on him if only to take a picture for himself.
In no time at all, Steve had Tony bent over his desk, pants around his ankles and two fingers grazing against his prostate.
"I'm sorry," Tony blinks. "Are you actually considering this?"
See you guys soon!
His father approached him first, clapping him on the shoulder. "I'm surprised to see you up and about," his father said. Joseph looked Steve up and down, his eyes pausing on Steve's swords. "Eager to break it in?"
“And you are?” Tony asked politely, Rumlow forgotten entirely.
The experience of having a mouth on his cock was unlike any other. It was so wet and hot, hotter than his own hands. He felt hyperaware of everything around him. Tony's sinful tongue tracing patterns along the length of Steve's cock, the honeysuckle in the air, the bubbling stream to the right of them. Tony sucked him in earnest now, bobbing his head and slurping indecently at Steve's cock. His knees trembled with the effort to keep himself from crumbling. He tugged at Tony's hair, needing to ground himself, and Tony
and him alone. Rumlow could kiss his ass. The thought of Tony with that brute damn near sent him into a frenzy, and the next thing he knew, he had Tony shoved up against a tree. Tony's cock pressed against his own through the confines of their trousers.
Steve’s hands briefly left Tony to help him out of his clothing. Prince or not, explaining why his clothes were ruined would be mortifying.
"Me neither," Tony says. "Howard...he'd tell me all these stories of Steve and the 'good old days'...Steve single-handedly storming a HYDRA facility. Throwing himself on a grenade to give others the chance to live. I always thought he was embellishing a little. Making war stories more digestible for a kid, you know? But seeing him,
give it a chance.”
“If you need anything else, let me know,” Tony said, wiping his hands off on a towel. Steve should have taken that as his cue to leave but something was holding him back. He didn’t want to go just yet.
he can feel how hot his skin is from being out in the sun and—
Steve rose to his feet and, at Bucky's inquiring glance, held up his waterskin. Over the smattering of voices, the rest of the party talking freely amongst themselves, he heard the gurgling of flowing water. He
He followed the staircase in the main foyer up, up, up until he reached the roof. A tall bald woman dressed in yellow robes was waiting for him.
“You’d like that wouldn’t you, all fucked out and leaking my come,” Steve said. He pulled out slowly, his cock dragging against Tony’s prostate in a way that had him curling his toes.
"Gross," she laughs, wrinkling her nose. "I'm sure it'll be fine. I meant what I said, you know. I'm glad you guys showed up. You know how much
Despite being on opposite sides of the country, Tony and Pepper talk more often than people think. Pep’s an early riser, and Tony hasn’t gotten a good night’s sleep since he was born, so it balances out.
“I’m actually a fan,” Natasha says. “I saw your work this February while undercover. Very nice.”
Steve just nods, not trusting his voice, and Tony makes his way over and sits down stiffly next to Steve. It’s a tight fit. Tony’s thigh presses right against his own. Steve can feel the heat of Tony’s skin through his pants. JARVIS dims the lights and starts one of the movies on Natasha’s list of Necessary Pop Culture she had created for Thor and Steve. Tonight, it’s Legally Blonde, with Elle Woods in all of her pink glory, gracing their screen.
"I'm dropping Cap off," Natasha says. "The north side is too small to land the jet."
"Tony," Steve says, eyes burning. "Don't hold back on me, baby. I can take it."
," he thinks. He hopes that maybe she'll loosen up by the end of the day, preferably without anyone getting hurt.
"I'm not...Steve, I'm not afraid of
“That whore of yours…was he any good?” Rumlow asked, wetting his lips.
They change the sheets together; Tony doesn’t feel like sleeping in a wet patch if he can help it. It feels intimate yet routine. Like he and Steve have done this a thousand times already.
Tony felt Steve smile against his neck. “I think I like you right where you are.”
“That’s exactly it,” Chris said, pointing at him. “Sometimes I find myself smiling at something or laughing at a joke and my brain freezes like, ‘Why are you smiling? Why are you laughing? Pay attention! You’re in danger!’”
It's a far cry from the "aw, shucks" wholesome Irish Catholic mask Steve dons, but Tony shouldn't be too surprised. This is the same man who got him off at the dinner table. And the shower. And the helicarrier.
“Yeah. Well, so I run his credentials, I make him; Aldrich Killian. We actually met the guy back in…where were we in ‘99? The science conference?
"And the charity, A Helping Hand, was it?" Natasha says. "One of yours?"
“It’s still not right,” Steve said softly.
“Obviously you’re feeling fine, if you’re finding it in yourself to joke, Captain.”
Tony pointed at Mark 42, “He was just—”
"When?" Tony demands, his voice rising. "I thought going off on a half-cocked mission was my thing?"
“Of course,” he said, hoping that the super-spy didn’t pick up on the frustration in his voice. Or at least read it as frustration towards Tony’s antics, which was more believable than anything.
And as if spending the night alone after that god-awful nightmare wasn’t the worst part, in the morning, things weren’t better. Although the sun shone and the birds were chirping, life wasn’t
Steve's thumb traces the outline of Tony's mouth and pushes at Tony's bottom lip. Steve gasps when Tony parts his lips and takes Steve's thumb into his mouth. He recovers quickly, pressing his thumb deeper into Tony's mouth. The salt of Steve's flesh coats his tongue, but for once, Tony feels like the hunter.
DUM-E had retreated into a corner.
, I needed your cock, it’s been so
“Can I?” Steve asks, his eyes darker than Tony had ever seen them.
“I’m yours,” Tony replied raggedly. “I’m your bitch, sir. I’ll fucking be anything you want to be if you just give me your cock.
“I’m sorry,” Steve huffed out, energy pulsing through his veins. “That was rude of me.”
He could go for some tea. “Yes, ma’am,” he replied.
“That’s fine. Anybody else?”
“Clint, you’re riding with me on the Ferris wheel,” Natasha declares when everyone makes it back to their table, and Steve has successfully made Tony as red as his suit.
Tony’s eyes had shot open and later on Rhodey would tell him that he had looked like a bull frog.
“I’ll send him away then,” Steve said, nodding to himself. “And pretend this whole incident never happened.”
"Fucking hell," Steve groaned, his voice coming out strained. Tony did it again, digging his tongue into Steve's slit in a way that had him swearing under his breath.
“Not talking baby? This too much for you?” Steve’s words carried a sharp edge to them like he liked seeing Tony broken down and desperate.
“Yep,” Steve said brightly. “So can we keep them?”
“Well, why don’t I run to the garage and see if I can’t find a crowbar to shimmy that thing open?” Pepper grinned wickedly before sauntering over to the stairs leading down to the workshop.
Tony had missed lunch and their daily team dinner. Steve knew he shouldn’t have been too worried. Tony kept food in his workshop for nights like this when the call of invention is too strong to ignore. It’s not enough, though, not to Steve. Tony’s a grown man; he can take care of himself. That doesn’t stop Steve from wanting to do it for him, to pick up where Tony slacks like a…friend
Tony shifts in his seat and hopes that Steve won’t notice, but of course, when do things ever work out the way Tony wants them to? Steve’s eyes track his movements with all the purpose of someone used to analyzing situations. Is that what Steve thinks is about to happen? A battle?
“You’re gonna come at me like that?”
Thor steps up next and, in true princely fashion, bows, bringing Carmen's hand to his lips, pressing a kiss to the back of her palm. "A pleasure to be here, my lady," Thor says.
Tony ducked down, narrowly missing another piece. Before he could catch his breath, one piece slammed into his crotch, another hitting and enveloping his back, the force of it throwing him forward and off the platform. Tony yelped and fired his repulsors at just the right moment. “Cool it, will you JARVIS?” Any later and he would’ve been a Tony pancake.
Tony shook his head. "Don't be. This wasn't about me."
"One more thank you, and you're going to rupture my eardrum," he says, holding his phone to his ear. He's making breakfast, which for him consists of swiping a yogurt cup and spoon from the kitchen.
"And why is that?" Tony asks like an idiot until he remembers that this base is located in the Alps, where so many things went catastrophically wrong for Steve.
It’s strange holding someone bigger than him, but not unpleasant. Especially when it’s Steve. It’s hard to shut off the part of his brain that can’t help but wonder what it would be like to hold Steve under normal circumstances, but since when have their lives ever been normal.
“Well,” Tony said carefully, meeting Steve’s eyes. “As long as it pleases his Majesty.”
“Alright fine,” he replied, raising his hands. “I surrender, Iron Patriot.” Tony lowered his hands and leaned in closer to Rhodey. “But…what’s really going on, Rhodey? With the Mandarin? Seriously, can we talk about this guy?”
“Let me tell you something, you know what happened when I told people I was Iron Man’s body guard? They would laugh in my face.”
Silence again.
“Thor,” Steve said, stepping forward.
It was lonelier in Malibu than he was wroth to admit. Especially in his workshop. Tony kept on waiting for Steve to wander down, sketchbook in one hand and a plate of food in the other. Those had been some of the best moments between them. Just the two of them in the beautiful chaos of Tony’s workshop, both of them lost in their respective art. Tony had never asked what Steve was drawing while he sat in the workshop, but whenever Tony had resumed working, he couldn’t help but get the sneaking suspicion that a pair of eyes was fixed resolutely on him the entire time. But why would Steve ever draw him? And in the workshop of all places?
Clint and Natasha had only dropped by the tower occasionally, stopping in between missions for a few nights of rest before disappearing off to who knew where in the early morning. No, it had just been him, Bruce, and Steve.
“Tony!” Steve admonished. “And you’re still planning on drinking coffee?”
A clever, calloused hand traced its way up Steve’s bare chest, leaving goose bumps in its wake.
The rest of the session had gone smoothly after that, Chris and Jackson and Hailey all sharing their collages and getting feedback from AJ.
He tries again. “Winter Soldier ringing any bells?”
In the meantime, Tony needs to figure out what he can salvage.
is a bad influence?” Pepper had asked, crossing her arms in front of her chest.
“Stop when you feel like there’s enough,” Jarvis instructs, standing next to the dark haired little boy who can’t be no older than eight.
. He’s still trying to figure out how to add the “boy” in front of that in a way that won’t run Steve off.
“Yeah.”
“You’re

be anyone else for Tony, not as long as Steve still loved him.
"Please tell me Fury knows that you're playing around with HYDRA tech."
Thor chuckles, some of the fierceness in his stance deteriorating. "He's alright," Thor says. "He can still joke."
“Oh trust me, I know.”
Tony moaned at that, his eyes fluttering shut as he focused on bobbing his head along the cock stuffing his mouth. The vibrations traveled along the length of Steve’s cock who cursed and bucked his hips upward, shoving even more of him down Tony's throat. Tony reveled in the the cloying scent of sweat and musk that assaulted his senses.
For some reason, Tony thinks of the kid he met not even a year ago when everyone thought he was dead: Harley. Tony didn't hug Harley. He didn't have it in him to hug Harley. The kid deserved it, though, for dealing with Tony's shit. Tony liked kids well enough, but having one of his own? He would never admit it out loud, but it scared him. And Steve...Steve deserved more than a coward.
“I miss you, Happy,” Tony said, voicing his thoughts.
“And why should I trust a word that comes out of your mouth?”
“I’m sorry, Cap.” Tony shook his head. “But I can’t stay here. Not anymore. It was fun while it lasted.” He gestured to Steve and Bruce, “You two are both welcome to continue to stay here, but I gotta go.” And with that, Tony stalked out of the room, leaving Steve and Bruce behind.
“Biggest mistake of your life. I’m quite the handful.”
Peter blushed all the way to his ears before telling him the truth. “I haven’t eaten yet.”
They laid in silence for what felt like hours before Steve finally worked up the courage to speak.
“Aye,” he said. “Steve. I prefer Steve over Steven.”
“Well, we’ll just have to be ready, won’t we?” Romanov says, her voice cutting through the silence.
"No, it's Bruce," he answers immediately, his voice deadpan.
Bucky had
“No,” Steve said, his voice sounding rougher than before. “Use your teeth.”
As they swayed together, the dulcet tones of the jazzy record wrapping around them, Peggy leaning into him, Steve could almost pretend that this was his life. That he had never let Bucky fall. That he had defeated the Red Skull before they both could even step foot on the
Tony breaks the kiss and pushes Steve's hair back from his forehead. Two bright blue eyes pierce him like hooks snagging his skin. "I don't expect you to be. Sorry that is," he clarifies at the look of confusion upon Steve's face.
He contemplated staying and trying some of the life Tony had been telling him to get. But it wouldn’t be
“You’re not hurt?”
"Please?" Tony asks. "I don't...I don't want to be alone. Please stay with me."
An inn would be preferable. Somewhere far from the castle and far away from Steve where he wouldn’t have to face him.
His heartbeat quickens, and he's not sure why. It's not like it's a public declaration of love to ride with someone on a Ferris wheel.
“That’s fine. More than fine, actually,” he says and he means it.
when Steve wasn’t there to protect him.
“It’s called an aerie, you ass.”
“Yes,” Tony babbled. “Yes, thank you,
The Ancient One—Brita—placed her hand atop his. “Steve,” she said softly, “I’m sorry. But it was necessary. This timeline, it would have been doomed if you did not live.”

Laughing, Tony said, “Alright, I think we got this. Send ‘em all, J.”
Skull continued, “it is too late. It has already been acquired.”
to do, Steve thought Tony Stark
having an entire floor to himself, so used to hanging around Tony’s penthouse suite or his workshop in the original timeline, or sparring with Natasha and Clint in the communal gym. He even missed the days where he and Bruce would cook dinner for the Avengers, Steve wanting to try something new every week that (thankfully) wasn’t boiled potatoes. He missed the movie nights which had started for both his and Thor’s sake to get them caught up on Earth’s culture and had slowly evolved to the chaotic, yet fun family events they had been.
“You know what, Legolas—”
Steve’s answering chuckle made him want to sink to his knees once more.
Steve wasn’t ashamed to admit that he laughed for an unbearably long time. “Oh my God,” he gasped out, tears running down his cheeks. “Tony, what the hell?” He said incredulously, not even realizing that he had slipped up and called him by his first name.
Steve tugged at the collar of his thrice-damned doublet, the air in his chambers suddenly unbearable. Even though it was the peak of summer, his servants had lit his fireplace casting his rooms in an amber glow.
“I’m not going to let that happen,” Steve whispers with a fierceness to his voice. Steve frees one hand and grabs hold of Tony’s chin, forcing him to meet his gaze. “You hear me? I’d die before I’d let them get to you. To any of you.”
“Big brain, and she likes it. Here, let me show you. Hold on. See?” There was a fumbling noise and all Tony could see was…Happy’s forehead.
“You’re a baby!” Rhodey had said brightly.
“I figured I’d take you up on your offer,” he said, looking Tony in his eyes. At least he tried to. Those sunglasses were damn near impenetrable. “That’s if I’m welcome, of course. Wouldn’t want to intrude.”
I'm also cool with you reaching out to me on my
“Are you lost?” Rhodey had asked him.
Tony never thought a smile could be sad, but that's the only way to describe the look on Steve's face; a mixture of anguish and fondness and love, so much love he has to look away. He didn't mean to make Steve upset, but it's too late now. He's already opened the floodgates.
I don't own anything related to Marvel Comics or Marvel Studios, but if I did, this is how I'd do it. Readers be warned, Steve does experience a panic attack in this chapter and if that may end up triggering you, it starts at
“Good boy,” Steve said softly like he meant it. Feeling his cheeks grow hot, Tony glanced down, unable to meet Steve’s gaze. “Oh, it’s too late to be shy. I think we’re past that, don’t you?”
They miss out on lunch too. JARVIS is absolutely miffed.
Tony grumbles, “Same difference,” making Steve laugh. His laugh soothes something inside of Tony; it’s like a balm for the soul.
“Once I corrected the anomaly, your body for lack of a better word, poofed into non-existence. You’re in your younger self’s body. His conscience is completely gone. It’s just you in there.”
“Tony, you of all people definitely deserve happiness and I want that for you so bad, but going to Malibu…call it a gut feeling but I don’t think that’s gonna end well.”
Tony hums, signaling that he’s listening.
A short, middle-aged woman answered his knock almost immediately, leading him over to a makeshift circulation desk with a kind smile. The brownstone was a two story building that been built in the earlier 20th century and remodeled about two years ago for a more contemporary look. The building was outfitted with large bay windows allowing for golden shafts of sunlight to illuminate the house and bounce off the freshly polished cherry wood floors. After signing in, he was told to take the stairs and the first room on the left was where his session would take place. Only three other people had attended the session. They all sat on the opposite side of the room, facing the doorway so Steve’s form was immediately under their scrutiny as he walked through the door.
“What? No, I—”
,” he says, not recognizing his own voice. His cock pulses in Steve's hands. “Please, I need your mouth.”
“I don’t know what you mean,” Tony says, his voice coming out thin.
"Steve."
“Sure, you will, sir.”
Tony's glad the Avengers are helping him out, honestly. It's just...the thought of six Avengers...around young, impressionable children…
The meeting is agonizingly slow and painful, and Tony wishes they all would leave. Barton and Thor almost come to blows over what they’re to do with Loki, but in the end, they decide to let the Asgardian face punishment in his own land, far,
“Let her in, J,” Tony says after staging the room. A gauntlet and soldering iron take the place of the gun.
There was a rushing in Tony’s ears. New York. Rhodey had said the Pentagon was scared. Good.
“Well, shit.”
?” Bruce said once he had stopped choking on his coffee.
“Or you’re stuck with me,” Tony had said. “People tend to get tired of me.” He meant for it to come out as a joke but the words had sounded hollow to even Tony’s ears.
“I’m sure you do,” Romanov says. “Pass them along to Thor and see how he takes them.”
," he thinks.  He'd never make Steve feel like that again, even if it killed him.

Bucky shook his head. “My gift wasn’t entirely a joke,” he said in explanation at Steve’s questioning head tilt. “I want you to remember your 21st birthday.”
The others had noticed his sudden silence and Steve
Tony walks past Steve into his kitchenette and pulls out two mugs, a saucepan, and a whisk. If he's staying up tonight, at least he has good company. The least they could have are some good drinks to accompany them.
“Nine.”
"You make him that way," she says, shocking him again. His stomach drops, and whatever peace between them quickly disintegrates. What does she mean by that? What could she possibly know about him and Steve and all the complexities of their relationship?
doing,” he said, striding over to the couch. “
The hard set of Steve’s shoulders cements his decision to remain in the cabin. He doesn’t like that far away look in Steve’s eyes either.
He finishes his shift with little fanfare, the carnival-goers opting for the rides and fair food after loading up on prizes for the day.
Horror trickled over him and Steve’s body tensed as if someone had poured ice water down his back. There was

Steve has lifted the veil off of his face, and Tony can see the reverence in his gaze untempered. Tony's stomach clenches. He feels like an animal, like some feral beast has taken up residence in his skin, wanting to claim and be claimed.
“I’ll ask,” Tony says, caving. “And if they say no, I’m not forcing them to go. Tell Carmen she’s getting one Avenger, at the least.”

He was running out of time. The others could only hold off the Chitauri for so long before they would eventually be overrun. He felt like Atlas, bearing the weight of the world upon his shoulders as he carried a nuclear warhead powerful enough to level all of Manhattan and then some into the heavens. The air got thinner the higher he climbed but still he pushed on, activating the thrusters hidden in the calves of his suit.
On one such upstroke, when Tony dipped his tongue into Steve’s slit, Steve lost what little control he had left.
"I'm sorry."
at the sight.
“Shit,” he said. He knocked on his forearm and raised his arm, willing the suit pieces to come to him. “Come on, baby.”
It’s not like Steve was expecting things to fall perfectly back into place. He knew life in the tower wasn’t going to be like it was before Thanos, before the Accords, before Ultron. But he still hoped. There were days where Tony would waltz into a room, bright-eyed and fidgety despite spending nearly the entire day in his workshop, and say one thing or another that would send Steve’s mind flying back to his past and it would be like he had never left his original timeline. Other times, Bruce and Tony acted like complete strangers, and he supposed they were complete strangers to each other at this point, which made it even harder for him to pretend he didn’t know nearly everything about them.
“I,” Pepper began turning around in the armchair to face the suit, “appreciated the thought very much.” She rose from the armchair gracefully, hands teasingly sliding up the torso of the suit. Even outside of it, Tony was having a hard time catching his breath. How could he be so lucky? “So why don’t you lift up that face mask and give me a kiss?”
Steve’s eyes narrow like he knows exactly where Tony’s brain went, and isn’t that a terrifying thought that Steve can already read him so well. Steve doesn’t call him out. Instead, he kisses Tony.
“You were meant to,” she replied, smiling sweetly.
. The detonation propelled his suit backwards, his thrusters about as useful as a bonfire would be in Hell.
"I just got you back," she said softly.
Follow me on
Steve’s hand leaves Tony’s thigh and slides up to the small of his back. Some of the tension leaves his shoulders as he leans back into Steve’s touch. Tony doesn’t know what Steve wants. He doesn’t know if their little tryst was just that or if there was room for more. Tony doesn’t like not knowing things. But he’ll let Steve have this, for now.
"I can do that," Steve whispers, stealing the words right from Tony's mouth.
“Hmm?”
“Colonel Rhodes did it during his last visit, sir,” JARVIS replied smoothly. It was still a culture shock to hear his voice again after all these years, but if JARVIS had noticed Steve’s odd behavior, he hadn’t made any mention of it to Tony.
Tony had crossed his arms and straightened his spine, ignoring the sting of tears that threatened to fall from his eyes. Lifting his chin, he said, “Do I look like I’m lost?”
“He’ll give us food poisoning,” Steve said.
, lips swollen, eyes blown wide and begging to suck Tony off.
“Different how?”
And Tony…he had been happy. For a little while anyway.
It's supposed to be a run-of-the-mill ambush, so of course, they're met with the modern-day equivalent of hellfire and brimstone—in HYDRA's case, a volley of gunfire. One second, Tony's flying over a mountain pass, thanking his lucky stars that his flight suit is insulated, the next a bright blue bolt of pure energy strikes him in one of his thrusters, sending him spiraling. Another shot sends Tony plummeting towards the earth in an ironic facsimile of the Battle of New York.
“Aldrich Killian? Are you
The answer is nothing. The Hulk alone takes out ten agents, tossing them about like a child would a toy. Clint's converted his bow into its bo staff form while they're enclosed, keeping close to Natasha's side.

him back.
Steve's shivers. Tony doesn't know if it's from the shower or if it's the thought of Tony's heart stopping. Either way, it's time for them to get out. If they stay in here any longer, they'll shrivel up like raisins.
He had managed to isolate the gun’s core, a pulsating egg-shaped thing, and what he had observed made his stomach turn. The core operated off what seemed a limitless supply of thermal energy. HYDRA had basically made fucking blasters like they were living in some cliché sci-fi film. He had wanted JARVIS to do a diagnostic scan but had remembered from earlier lab trials done by SHIELD’s team of scientists that the cores reacted negatively to radiation. The last thing he wanted was to be Tony toast. What intrigued him most was just how compatible alien technology was with earth’s technology. Was all alien tech this adaptable, or was it just unique to the Chitauri?
“I know you’re awake, Steve,” Tony whispered into the shell of his ear sending a shiver down his spine.
Tony's not going to argue with her, mostly since the others have stopped talking amongst themselves and are looking
Sometimes he would do something for one of them without them even asking, or reference an inside joke that didn’t exist between them yet and Bruce and Tony would stare at him like he had suddenly sprouted another head. (He wondered if that was another side-effect of time travel he hadn’t known about. He’d have to ask Brita.)
was scared after what he had seen.
When Steve's hand strokes his cheek and comes away wet, Tony realizes that he's crying. Steve kisses his cheeks and his forehead and his nose, and when he finally goes for Tony's mouth, Tony lets out the softest, "Thank you."
"I'd do it again," Steve says firmly. "I know we didn't speak for those two years, but I needed to talk to you. In person." Steve's arms fall at his sides, and Tony wraps his arms around Steve's neck. He knows he's giving Steve all kinds of mixed signals. Pressing up against him one moment and pushing him away the next, but Tony would have to be a heartless bastard to push him away right now.
Tony blinks. "I can...get us normal shirts?"
Tony wasn't heavy by any means, and the feel of him pressed directly against Steve's groin was undeniably pleasant. His face grew hot as he pondered how much better it would feel had they been bare.
that his brain didn’t even want to consider at the moment. Until he figured out what the hell was going on, he was going to proceed as he would normally. Normal. As if anything in his life was something as mundane and boring as

With Steve still jerking him, the arousal hit him like a punch to the gut. Tony could see it; bound to their bedposts, Steve filling him up again and again, not even giving his come the chance to leak out of Tony.
Murray’s Bar and Grill was the most popular beachside hole-in-the-wall this side of the Mississippi. The restaurant was a squat, low building made nearly entirely out of wood. Real fishing nets and life savers and fishing lures adorned the walls. Offering live music, greasy food, and cheap alcohol, all tied up with a magnificent view of the Pacific Ocean, it was easily the last place one would expect to find a billionaire. On a normal day, Tony couldn’t get enough of the place.
Tony hates how his skin still burns at his touch.

. The mists permeating the land seemed to part for him as he made his way up the summit of a cliff. Two towering pillars of rock interrupted the otherwise monotonous horizon he had grown accustomed to and Steve knew deep in his soul that this is where Natasha had died. The urge to breakdown and sob hit him with a quickness and he came to a stop. He wanted to fling the briefcase off that very same cliff or crush all of the stones in his fists for taking everything and everyone away from him.
“No?” Steve asked, ignoring the fire in his belly at the words “my prince” falling from the courtesan’s lips. “What’s all this then? The crown prince has to pay just to get someone to sleep with him? A man nonetheless?”
“That! Would you like one?”
," Tony says. Steve's still looking down. He doesn't know where he gets the courage, but he cups Steve's face and makes him look at him. "You hear me? I'm not afraid of you."
Rumlow recovered swiftly. Steve would give him that. “My apologies…”
A chance meeting between our prince and his courtesan.
“I’m sorry,” Steve starts.
“You know I can help, just ask,” Tony said instead. “I got a ton of new tech. I got a prehensile suit, I got a…I got a new bomb disposal. Catches explosions mid-air.”
They could come together, just like this, hell they
There was a twinkle in her eye. “No one has called me anything but the ‘Ancient One’ for nearly 600 years.”
“Sorry,” Tony said unhelpfully.
Bucky winced, his eyes following Steve as he paced from one corner of his chambers to the other. “I think,” Bucky said slowly, no doubt gauging how much patience Steve had left, “you might be overreacting.”
“And if I wanted to find out for myself?” Rumlow asked, giving Tony an oily grin.
“Alright. Steve. Do you have any questions?”
"No," Tony says, pointing a finger at them. "The last time you two arm-wrestled at this table, you split it in half. You'll be assigned whatever booth is available."
“That’s between the prince and me,” Tony demured.
“Traitors. I’m literally surrounded by traitors. This is it. This is my villain origin story.”

Tony grumbles. His ass

Bucky huffed and slouched into his seat. "I was just trying to liven things up. I saw you at the feast. You can’t tell me that you weren’t miserable."
for more marvel content.
Tony stood behind him and had the good grace to look bashful. "I'm sorry, I thought you heard me."
“Tony?”
But Tony remembers how Steve fought by his side like a demon, like the god of war himself. What he saw today scratched the surface of how far Steve Rogers would go for someone he loved.
“God, that is creepy. Did you two practice that? I feel like you did.”
“You’re telling me,” Steve says carefully. Always so careful. Except for when his hands are shoved down Tony’s pants.
“Happy birthday, soldier,” Tony murmured.
“I love you,” Steve said against Tony’s neck. He wrapped a hand around Tony’s cock.
Despite it being a prestigious school, the food at MIT, like all school sanctioned meals, is crappy and inedible. And after the whole debacle with Sunset, Howard had cut Tony off until further notice. If Tony saved up his measly check he got from working in the school’s post office, he could
He looks at Steve out the corner of his eye, takes in his features shamelessly and selfishly, the allure of being above everyone reeling him in. He loves Steve's face, the cut of his jaw, and his long, pretty lashes and those
He continued, “I’d be happy to come to an arrangement with you…depending upon Madam Natasha’s approval.”
A muscle jumped in Tony’s jaw. “A gut feeling, huh? That’s your excuse?”
experience with therapy; he had observed a few of Sam’s sessions at the VA and led his own support group after the Decimation but he had never done something like this. He had never been the patient. And that’s what he was, wasn’t he? A patient? Because his mental illness was just that, an illness. And it didn’t make sense to let a physical illness like a cold or the flu go untreated, did it? Why would a mental illness be any different?
asked them, dumbass. They're your
“Stop what? Doing my job?” He snarks. The Chitauri gun he had uh,
"Can it wait?"
. It has to be from the cold.
Tony kisses him back, parts his lips and presses his small, lithe body against Steve’s. His arms wind around Steve’s neck and Steve’s settles his hands on Tony’s waist.
"I'll stop shouting," she says, which is a complete lie. "I just can't believe the Avengers are going to be at my fundraiser!" Case in point.
“Eight.”
"Make sure you're at your booths in ten minutes! The kids are going to be arriving soon!"
Pepper looked over her shoulder at the suit, her strawberry blonde hair swishing with the movement, and winked. “I’ll take my chances.”
“Does too.”
"Just got a headache," Tony says, stepping out from his booth, giving Jake a wave. Jake waves back, trying his best not to look starstruck at the sight of the other Avengers.
“What?” Tony said, crossing his arms in front of his chest.
Returning to 2012 had done nothing but sadden him and he was ready to just hurl the remaining stones as far from himself as he could and go…somewhere. Anywhere but here. The time bracelet had made him reappear mere seconds after he had battled himself the first time around for the staff and Steve wanted nothing more than to slap his younger self and tell him to pull himself together.
“That’s all we’ve got on Zola’s experiments dating back to 1934. You’re welcome.”
Rhodey looked frustrated, although some would argue that was his perpetual state while around Tony. “It tested well with focus groups, alright?”
“People are concerned about you, Tony. I’m concerned about you.”
After living together for several months and bearing witness to many of the man’s brave (and stupid) exploits, Tony, Steve decides, is an enigma. He’s a contradiction, a logic puzzle that sits at the back of Steve’s mind and in his idle moments, he wants nothing more than to piece him together and make sense of the puzzle.
. Tony never missed movie night these days, not even after spending entire nights the day before in his workshop. He’d always show up, even if he ended up falling asleep five minutes into the movie, his head lolling onto Steve’s shoulder. Steve had an awful feeling those nights were the only times Tony actually got sleep.
“Two weeks,” Tony points out.
He damn near started
It's cliche, but Tony swears he can see fireworks going off behind his eyelids. Steve's lips are warm and soft and pliant against his. Tony deepens the kiss and slides one of his hands into Steve's hair, the other remaining on his face. He can taste the remnants of cotton candy on Steve's mouth.
Seventy years and HYDRA was still the scum of the earth.
“Both,” Pepper says. “Your sleeping habits are abysmal.”
When he opened his eyes once more, he was sitting in a shallow pool of water. The briefcase was still in his hands. Opening the case, Steve counted three stones and breathed a sigh of relief. Looking more closely at his surroundings, he realized that Vormir had disappeared completely. Good. He couldn’t exactly say that he’d miss the godforsaken planet. The real question was, where the hell was he
Tony ducked his head, rubbing the back of his neck. “I meant what I said. There’s plenty of space. For all of you.”
“Are you okay, Mr. Stark?” Erin asked.
"Prepare to drown in files, Barton," Natasha says, catching Tony's eye.
Steve’s face is devoid of all masks, his lips pink against his flushed skin.
“Seriously,” Happy said, eyebrows raised.
“Tony, if you go, we’ll be down to only having two Avengers in New York. I—
“Can we talk?” Steve asks, leaning against the wall with his hands shoved into his pockets.
Steve, bless his heart, blushes but doesn’t say anything, and Tony’s just reminded of how he looked when he came down Tony’s throat; head thrown back, mouth open, and skin flushed.
to let me work on her. At least once,” Tony pleaded looking at him with his bright brown eyes and Steve’s breath caught in his throat.
“Really, there’s one basic one. You can’t remain in proximity of any younger version of yourself for more than 24 hours. Even if you’re on completely opposite sides of the universe. Granted, the effects are slower the further away from your younger self you are, but they don’t stop completely.”
Tony thought of his own inventions. Missiles and guns and bombs. But he also made intellicrops to feed the hungry. The arc reactor sparked a revolution in clean energy technology. JARVIS, the closest Tony would ever come to bringing another life into this world, growing and developing with every day. How would history judge
Tony paused to survey a Pinot Noir. It’d pair well with fish, especially salmon. Tony could make fish. He hoped. “What? Harassing interns?”
“She gets a couple of sweet potatoes and peels them and cuts them into slices. She lets them soak in some water then she throws them in a skillet with butter, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Tones,” Rhodey groans and flops back them, his hands clutching at his stomach. “I’m gonna die if I don’t eat real food in the next twenty-four hours.”
Tony chuckled. He knew keeping himself out of trouble was about as easy as wrangling cats.
Bruce had damn near spat out his cup of coffee and Steve hands fumbled the plates filled with pancakes he had been carrying to the dining table.
One night they had been plowing their way through their list and Tony had fallen asleep about halfway through
“Yes.
“Okay, you
“We?” Tony arched a brow. “
“Enter,” he called out, damning the wine at that moment as he tried to piece together who could be visiting him at such a late hour.
“He loved you,” she murmured, her voice softer than he had ever heard it. “He always loved you, even when you fought. And trust me, I would know.”
"Iron Man? Iron Man, do you copy?" That's Steve's voice. There's an urgent note to it, almost like he's trying to stop himself from shouting.
“My name is Tony,” the courtesan—Tony—said.
of all people have come in search of the Soul Stone.”
“Hopefully Ms. Potts won’t suffer from food poisoning.”
"Don't worry, Bruce." Steve knew the mission like the back of his hand. Return the stones. Don't get caught. Haul ass back to the present. What did it say about him that
"And you've already skipped breakfast, sir," JARVIS says. "It is recommended that humans eat at least three meals a day."
“For what I said on the Helicarrier,” Steve elaborated.
Tony's brows furrow. "What new additions?" he asks.
, and another, crossing his arms over his chest, still trying to protect his long gone arc reactor. As he gets to his feet and slowly, almost mechanically starts to gather clean clothes to change into, a part of him recoils at having to clean himself with wipes like he's a child.
Comments, kudos, bookmarks, etc. are much appreciated. I love seeing what you guys liked, what you think is going to happen, etc. Not only does feedback make me a better writer, it also makes my day. Thanks for reading!
“But he never spoke of what you looked like when you came,” Steve continued. Steve titled his head looking so much like a golden retriever, had Tony not been so drained, he would’ve told the man how cute he looked.
“Love you too, Tony.”
“No entourage?” Steve asks, pushing through the silence that had settled over them.
“It won’t,” Thor said darkly. “If Loki doesn’t want to be found, he won’t be.”
“Thought this was what you wanted, hm?” Steve murmured all soft and gentle like they were cuddling in bed. “You came in here, interrupted my work. Now you’re gonna take what.
Somewhere, where ever they are, Sarah Rogers and Maria Stark are smiling.
," he says aloud, burying his face into his hands.
He pushed it open slowly and poked his head in through the gap. The office was sparsely decorated, consisting of a bookcase bordered by a brown leather sofa and a desk. Steve’s desk was parallel to the door, yet Steve didn’t glance up from his computer. Tony took that as a sign to enter and shut the door behind him. Steve had come straight to his office; he was still dressed in the understated stealth uniform Tony had designed for his more discreet missions (aka doing SHIELD's dirty work). His cowl and shield lay discarded on the sofa.
He took a sip, relaxing even further as the sweetness of the jasmine melded with the sourness of the lemon and overwhelmed his taste-buds. Maybe she had been onto something when she had made the tea.
that left a metallic taste in his mouth.
“Oh, you’re so saying ‘I told you so.’ Your whole body language reeks of ‘I told you so.’”
He remembers the nights when their rations ran low and his mother would scrape whatever was left from their pantry and seemingly make a meal out of thin air. He remembers the hotdog-and-potato plates, and the creamed chip beef, and the thick sliminess unique only to egg drop soup. Sometimes when they craved something sweet, his mother would make fresh soda bread with dried currants and caraway seeds.
By the time Tony registered the sound of a stray suit piece firing up, it had already jetted his way, shooting into his back. Tony toppled forward, the suit falling to pieces around him. He tugged and yanked at his helmet until his head was free and surveyed the damage. Two of the glass panes sealing his suits away from the rest of the world had been shattered. Steam billowed steadily from the broken pipes embedded in the wall and…was that smoke?
death experience, but he got the all-clear from SHIELD's medics themselves. If he sustains a concussion, that's on them.
“I am not weak,” Tony replied, his voice hard as castle-forged steel.
Peter shrugged as he set Steve’s table for his morning meal. “Perhaps his Majesty has more planned and wants to make the most of the day.”
of you now."
“Other side, Rogers.”
But what could a prince ever be in want of?
"Bet Fury was happy to score that," Rhodey says.
They come together, oddly enough. Steve’s teeth sink into Tony’s throat, and Tony’s throwing his head back as his come lands on both of their stomachs, and it’s so. Fucking.
Tony repeats what she had told him all those years ago. "Us orphans gotta stick together."
"I've got you?" Steve asks. His voice sounds small, unsure.
Skull was the one still kicking. That was just his luck.
Steve, unsurprisingly, volunteers to stay behind and clean up while everybody else leaves, and Tony follows his lead.
Slowly, Steve opened the briefcase. The stones glowed vibrantly within their case. Such tiny, beautiful objects and yet they had caused so much death and destruction. Steve hated the mere sight of them. Meanwhile the Red Skull’s gaze focused in on the stones, a deep longing making itself known in his face. Steve held the briefcase closer to himself.
He stayed behind on his horse while the rest of the hunting party got a headstart. He would catch up with them later. Bucky and Dugan stayed behind as well, unwilling to leave their prince. Any other time, he would have appreciated their loyalty, but their remaining behind had prompted Rumlow to stay back as well, more so out of nosiness than a sense of loyalty.
Tony’s smile got wider and nodding his head at Steve’s motorcycle, he said, “A motorcycle, huh? Isn’t that a little, I don’t know, wild for you? I was thinking you were more of a Beetle man.”
Follow my
But no, Steve...Steve wasn’t his friend.
Tony’s the last to arrive like always, holding his own bowl of popcorn because he’s the only one who prefers caramel corn over kettle corn like a heathen. His eyes go wide as he surveys the room, sees that there are no seats open.
. That familiar coil of pleasure in his groin was practically singing.
“Later,” Steve promised. “I swear when I’m done with you, you won’t be able to fucking walk. Count on that.”  And then Steve pushed the head of his cock into Tony and it was like coming home. He missed being full, feeling Steve inside of him like they were becoming one person.
“Damn it,” Steve growled under his breath, stalking after the courtesan. “Wait! Wait, damn you, wait!” The courtesan paused right at the threshold, allowing Steve to catch up to him until they were face to face.
“I mean no offense,” Rhodey had begun, sitting down on his bed. “But who leaves their 12 year old kid alone at college?”
"No," he says. "I want...I need to hear you."
When this…thing between them had first started, Tony had fully expected that we was going to choke on Steve’s cock. And not in the fun way. Although, the first time Tony had blown him, Steve had been surprisingly gentle as opposed to their heated, damn near vicious kisses, keeping a firm but almost kind hand on the back of Tony’s head as Tony had taken on as much of him as he could. Despite lacking the ferocity that had decidedly marked every other one of their past encounters, Steve had still come that first time, his fingers tugging at Tony’s hair.
As their friendship had progressed, Tony had started making an effort to take care of himself and he had seen the look less and less. But all of his progress went down the drain in the winter of 1991.
Steve had called him a handful of times since Tony had moved. Tony never answered. Not a single one. But if Captain Steven Grant Rogers was anything, it was persistent, Tony could give him that. So Steve left voicemails. Tony listened to each one. They weren’t too long, usually about a minute and only consisted of updates on Steve’s life.
"And why not?" Thor, of all people, asks. The god levels Bruce with a heavy stare. "You deserve to amuse yourself like the rest of us."
Sam stepped forward. "You know if you want, I can come with you." The utter sincerity in Sam's eyes nearly made him choke up. Waking up in an entirely new century was enough to drive anyone crazy, but having a friend like Sam, who had always been there for him, who had fought by his side, no questions asked, Steve was thankful for every day he spent with the man.
With all eyes on him, Steve worked to keep his voice steady. “I don’t see why you can’t stay.”
“Tony,” Steve whispered. “I don’t think you could give up Iron Man even if you wanted to.”
Tony shrugs. Hill already thinks he’s a jackass, and he has no issues playing the part. “Sue me for working on the thing that saved your life, my life, all of New York—“
“It’s the Cap shtick,” Bruce said. “It has to be.”
"You know, I tried." The words were quiet, almost too low for even Steve's enhanced ears to hear. "When I had the gauntlet…the stones, I  really tried to bring her back."
She pulled away from him. “And you’re gonna join me.”
“Tony—”
The final patient was another woman, named Hailey, who couldn’t have been no older than twenty-one. Their therapist, AJ was a sprightly woman with dark blue hair cut into a pixie cut and wide, innocent looking eyes. Once they had all introduced themselves, AJ had thrown her hands out wide and said, “Welcome to art therapy! And yes, it is a valid form of therapy, your doctor wasn’t pulling your leg.”
"I'm alive," he says. "I'm alive, and I'm here with
“Not you, too,” Tony said, then narrowed his eyes. “Despite the sleep deprivation and the fact that I’ve eaten nothing but smoothies for the past 24 hours, I’m 99.9 percent sure you’ve never even come up to the penthouse before. And you haven’t called me, ‘Stark’ which is double weird. Are you here to yell at me?”
"You too, Stark?" Natasha says, arching a brow. "Since when do you clean?"
Tony sticks his tongue out at the screen, and in true Rhodey fashion, Rhodey flips him off.
“Dude, your dad’s a dick.”
"I wonder," Tony started, his voice going low, sending a strange tingling feeling down Steve's spine. There was a shift in Tony. He was no longer the bored-looking courtesan forced to entertain yet another self-obsessed nobleman. Steve recognized the change from countless excursions into the woods with the court.
. Who even smirks in real life?
Tony was at his worst right now, drunk and snappy and full of self-loathing, and he would say anything to push him away. “Tony,” he said. “You don’t have to do that. Not with me.”
Steve knows when he’s beaten; “Fair enough, genius. I know that’s soda bread,” he says, gesturing to the loaf sitting on the counter. “But what else did you cook?”
, it doesn't do him any favors. They're almost at the top of the wheel. A stray breeze rustles a lock of Steve's hair, and Tony feels like he's on a cliff's edge.
Steve sets his tablet down. "What we're going to do," he says, his voice colder than Tony's ever heard it, "is go for the head."
“Nope,” Tony said, shooting himself with the needle gun one last time. “Forty- eight. Micro-repeater implanting sequence complete.”
“Oh, you like that, huh?” Tony didn’t know when he started leaning forward.
Tony’s head was reeling. According to JARVIS he had just had an anxiety attack and a severe one at that. But what had set him off? Rhodey…Rhodey had mentioned New York…and then the kid had asked him about the wormhole…
," his therapist was fond of reminding him. "
“This is a new level of lame,” Pepper said and—oh no. Her hands were on her hips. She was mad. She was really mad.
Now it was Steve’s turn to be bashful. “Eat up, Tony.”
“I’m sorry, Captain,” she said genuinely. “Nothing about this process will feel good.”
"Am I your favorite?" Clint asks with a shit-eating grin on his face.
“Sir, Agent Hill is waiting,” JARVIS says.
The hunting party consisted of his father, who simply arched a brow at the sight of Steve, Rumlow, Bucky (thank the gods), one of Steve's favorite guards, Sir Timothy Dugan, and various other lords of his father's High Council.
Steve let out a breathy laugh at that and the grin Tony gave him was beatific. “Six,” Steve said.
“No!” Steve whisper-yells, his hands wrapping around Tony and—
“Tony! Tony! Tony—”
me, Steve."
As Steve made his way to the Sanctum Sanctorum, the pain in his head began to subside to a dull ache versus the throbbing roar it had been before. He followed the directions Bruce had given him as closely as possible and soon found himself outside the front of a three story building that had somehow sustained no damage from the battle. Bruce had told him to look out for an ornate townhouse with a copper-green roof and a dome window with a strange sign emblazoned upon it. This had to be the right one.
Steve flushed. He hadn’t realized he had said that out loud. God, how out of it was he?
“I know you didn’t send for me,” the courtesan said. “That much was obvious.” His voice was deeper than Steve expected and oddly accented. He spoke fast and enunciated, whereas Brooke’s natives had always favored a slower form of speaking, letters getting mushed together or lost entirely as they spoke. To his shock, he liked it. It was something different.
“And that’s where I come in,” AJ said. She turned to look at every single one of them and said, “At the end of the day, my main goal is for you guys to walk out of this room feeling relaxed and
and you’ve been avoiding me ever since I stepped foot in this place.”
Steve scrambled towards the case, his hands fumbling over the latches that had snapped back shut, and tugged at the stone. He ignored the searing pain racing through his hands and pulled until the stone finally came free. The woman grabbed the stone from his hands and placed it in the necklace around her neck.
“Of course we can. Dinner first.”
And now he was…where was he? He blinked, willing his eyes to adjust to the lack of light until he could make out…a bucket? He blinked again. That was most definitely a bucket. An old mop was leaning next to it. Something was digging into his back and with a shock, Steve realized he was slumped over in…a closet. A scarily familiar closet. Faintly, he could make out the sharp, sickly sweet scent of bleach and other various household cleaners.
The lamb meat falls off the bone. Steve dips his soda bread into the broth, lets it soak up the flavor. The sweetness of the currants and the savoriness of the stew are like a symphony of sensation in his mouth.
"They needed a day off," Tony explains. "I offered. Nothing else to it."
He can’t stare at her picture for too long, not without smelling putrid flesh.
“So you look for the next best thing,” Steve finishes. “The staff. They’re using Loki’s staff to make super-soldiers or something close.”
He followed Tony’s instructions down to the very last word, and Tony turned the key in the ignition. “Start your engine,” Tony said.
"I told you not to mock me," Steve said. Hopefully, Tony hadn't heard his voice crack.
“Really?” he asked. “You don’t look a day over thirty.”
And there was Steve offering him a way out. If Tony didn’t already love him, that surely would have tipped him over the edge. So what else was he supposed to say except for yes?
If anyone's still reading choke on me at this point, thank you so much for your support, it truly means a lot to me 💖💖
“I have to say I didn’t see that coming.” Natasha’s voice dropped, “But Captain…there’s always a place for you at SHIELD if you want it.”
There’s something wet running down his neck and in the midst of his orgasm, Tony realizes Steve is crying too. He’s transported back to their first time, both of them reeling from the aftermath of a dangerous mission. Tony remembers that
“You’d like that, wouldn’t you? Walking out there, letting everyone in this building know I fucking
“This has got to stop,” Rhodey says as soon as Tony answers his video call. Tony had heard that phrase a lot throughout his life, but never about something he was
“Hey, girl,” Tony had said, running a hand across the bike’s handlebars as if it were a startled horse. “Let’s see if I can fix you up.”
Tony avoided his gaze when he said, "You looked troubled. I thought to check on you. Excuse me for presuming."

“What kind of carnival?” Clint asks, breaking Tony out of his reverie.
"No," Tony says immediately, putting an end to any questions before they can begin. "We've been friends since high school. It'd be like dating my sister." Not to mention Carmen had known him when he had still been under five feet and had a mouth full of metal. Any attraction on her part had either never existed or died as soon as Tony had opened his mouth.
"Turn around," he murmurs to Steve. Steve does as he's told, and Tony grabs a spare loofah and his body-wash, working it into a good lather. He scrubs Steve's shoulders and his back, his fingers working on loosening any knots he comes across. Steve carries so much tension like he's Atlas, forced to bear the weight of the world on his shoulders for all eternity.
nonsense. Whenever Happy was with Tony anything could happen.) attitude and his overprotective streak that was a mile wide.
Steve nodded.
He didn't blame her, though. Had he not jumped at every chance to hook up with Steve like his teenage self would have wanted?
that, ma’am, but it still needed to be done—”
Tony, Steve decided, was a goddamn hypocrite.
Tony’s eyes grow round and pleading, “Ooh, Jarvis can we make that for dessert?”
“Hello,” he had cooed at the tan-and-white pup as it had wiggled it’s way out of the cardboard box he and all of his brothers and sisters were living in. It’s fluffy ears flopped forward as it struggled to find its balance on its too big paws.
“Spell?”
"We're sticky," he says against Steve's lips and wriggles his hips. Steve pulls away from him and glances down, observing the mess they’ve made of each other; Their come and the lube is starting to dry on Tony's skin, leaving it tacky.
Steve tilts his hips just slightly, but the change in angle is enough to make Tony clench around him as his cock presses incessantly against that sweet, electrifying spot inside of Tony.
Tony gripped the arms of the chair as he did what he was told. From this angle and with Tony controlling the rhythm, every downward thrust had Tony’s head spinning. He could barely make sense of his thoughts, but in some ways, it was welcome. Tony’s brain was always working, always theorizing. Sometimes the only way he could get it to shut off was when he was with Steve.
Steve Rogers was a mouthy, stubborn little punk from Brooklyn who went after what he wanted with a single-minded focus.
“Okay, I
They're off to a good start. Even Natasha looks pleased, or as pleased as she can be, with her arms crossed in front of her. She's taking in their surroundings too, but Tony knows that a part of her isn't doing it for fun. She's looking for enemies, escape routes, any possible threats to her and the others.
“Not forever,” Steve corrected. “Just indefinitely.”
Bucky grinned far too brightly for Steve’s tastes. “Tony,” Bucky said in place of a greeting.
Afterward, Tony blames it on his approaching orgasm, but in that moment, all Tony can say is, “Yes,
The wail of Brian Johnson’s rendition of Rock and Roll Ain’t No Noise Pollution was replaced by a funky rendition of Jingle Bells. Tony closed his eyes, letting the music wash over him. His hips took on a life of their own, swaying to the smooth rhythm.
him and having kids that
Tony remembered their teeth clacking together painfully and Rogers biting down on his lip until they bled and coming so hard in his uniform until he was seeing stars behind the lids of his eyes. After that it had become a regular occurrence. Whenever Tony, or in some rare cases, Steve, had fucked up on a mission, somehow, someway they’d find each other and spend the evening tearing each other apart. A small, dark part of Tony that he didn’t want to acknowledge secretly looked forward to their little clandestine meetings.
“I…I probably shouldn’t be saying this. Hell, I don’t even know if you’re getting these, but, uh,” Tony had heard a ruffling sound, almost as if Steve had sighed into the phone receiver. “I’m leaving. For a SHIELD mission. Absolute radio silence. I don’t know how long it’s gonna take, but when I get back, I was hoping we could talk? In person?”
“I’m going to kill you,” Steve repeated his words from earlier, albeit with less heat.
"Okay," Steve says.
A sigh of relief escaped him as he entered the main lobby of the tower, greeting Fred the receptionist with a quick nod, as a cool breeze washed over his body. Steve had to give it to the 21st century; air conditioning was literally a godsend. He entered the elevator swiftly, swiping the special key-card gifted to him by Tony that gave him access to the upper levels of the tower, and tugged at the collar of his shirt. All he had worn was a simple pair of jeans and a t-shirt, yet the sweat-soaked clothes clung to him like a second skin. His hair wasn’t any better, weighing down on his forehead and getting into his eyes.
“We’ll see,” Tony had said dismissively. Everyone always left eventually.
As if summoned, Steve comes bounding back to their table looking boyish and vibrant in the evening sun before Tony can process her words.
Tony presses forward, nudging his cock against Steve's lips, who gladly takes him back into his mouth. Steve's mouth is so
A muscle in Steve’s jaw jumps. “I’m not going to storm a HYDRA base by myself,” he mutters.
beginning to think that I could stay here. That I wouldn’t have to run. Guess not, huh?”
With shaky fingers, Tony continued to unzip his tac suit only stopping to shrug off his shoulder holster. The leather holster dropped harmlessly to the floor with a light
"We don't know that," Tony says, his voice muffled. He looks up to see Steve raising a judgemental brow at him. "I'm letting not one, but two master assassins, the Hulk, and a fucking

For a man on his knees and a fist in his hair, Tony looked far too smug, that same wicked smirk emblazoned on his face.
"I have to go," he whispered, his lips ghosting over hers.
Pepper padded over to him now, concern blooming on her face. The anger was still there, he could see it in her eyes, but at least she was willing to listen.
The bug-eyed look on Steve's face as he hurriedly tries not to spit his drink all over the dinner table is satisfying, to say the least.
And well, if they end up making out against Tony's marble countertops, that's
His heart speeds up again, and given their proximity, Steve can surely hear it, how crazy he makes Tony. With a declaration like that, how can he not love Steve with everything he has?
. That they were at
He arched a brow, prompting Tony to continue.
Their dorm building has a community kitchen that’s only ever used for late night experiments by the Chem majors. Tony swears he’s heard explosions from the kitchen before, but that doesn’t deter him. And he’s so
. Tony doesn’t say anything, though. Barton’s eyes have a faraway look; the archer’s mind is on anything but social etiquette right now. Even Thor, who’s a supposed god, looks a bit winded with one hand on his hammer and the other propping up his face. Bruce is full-on asleep, not that Tony blames him, with a shock blanket strewn about his shoulders.
. For Natasha, for Bucky, for Tony, for every single person he had let down over the years. But then, like a miracle from God themself, Thanos and his legions had started to crumble, blowing away like dust on the wind. Hope had soared in his chest only to be fucking obliterated as soon as he had realized
Pushing Rhodey away, Tony activated his thrusters and jetted away from Murray’s.
“Hurry up, Rogers,” he says going for boredom, but his voice is just a little too breathless for that as Steve’s breath ghosts hotly over his thighs. “Some of us don’t have all day.”
, like he hadn’t come at all. He and Steve had always talked about seeing how far they could go while in the heat of the moment, but they never truly attempted…
unassuming but Steve of all people knew that looks were deceiving. He had finally caved and Brita (he hated when she was right) had slipped him a pamphlet for a local art therapy session during their last morning tea time.
Thank you to everyone who's stuck with this fic even though it's been a hot second since I've updated. You mean the world to me 💖. Again, chapter four should be up before the month is over. Chapter five needs a little bit of tweaking but it'll probably be up in early February.
“Strange,” Tony murmured when Steve filled his goblet.
Tony looked down at the drawing and his heart nearly burst at the sight. The picture was a crude drawing of him in his suit with the nuke…strapped to his back? He squinted his eyes. The nuke was most definitely strapped to his back and the coloring of the suit was a bit off but Tony loved it anyway.
“I’d like the whole damn pot.”
"You are, and I will literally owe you for the rest of my life," she replies.
He can't help but feel like there's a hidden meaning to her words, and knowing her, there is. She leaves before Tony can get the last word, her hair swaying with every step.
Basketball. He can do basketball.
and ends at
life, Steve was determined to see things through right to the bitter end. But first he needed some answers.
Tony pokes mindlessly at his food at the repast; the food tastes like ashes in his mouth.
Being with Steve...is not like that. If the others are a fireplace, then Steve is a wildfire. Tony knows that he'll end up burned if he gets too close, but he can’t help but be drawn in by his light anyway.
“You’re thinking about moving in with him?” Natasha asked, arching a finely plucked brow.
“Count?” Steve heard himself saying.
It’s got Romanov’s attention. And everyone else’s, apparently. Bruce is still sleeping, but Barton’s turned his eyes onto them, that faraway look receding slightly. Thor’s sitting up now, his arms crossed in front of his broad chest.
more vicious, more bloodthirsty than any other foe they had fought combined.
to teach Tony how to cook and Tony being well,
"I will," he says, aware that they're watching him more closely now. He hopes that he doesn't look as unsound as he feels. "But why leave just yet? Don't you guys want to check out some of the booths or rides before we leave?"
Tony shivers, and Steve wants to hit himself. So much for not making Tony comfortable. But then, Tony does the unthinkable. He takes a deep breath and slowly sinks into Steve’s side. Steve freezes like a deer staring up the barrel of a shotgun.
Tony and Sam and Bucky. He missed waking up and actually feeling like he had belonged somewhere. Maybe he would always be the man out of time. He wasn’t the same man who had put the Valkyrie in the ice all those years ago, nor did he think he was the same man who had stepped on that platform merely a month ago.
But as Rhodey’s laughter, ringing brightly like a bell, warms Tony from the inside like the sun, he can hardly bring himself to care.
“The man jumps out of planes without parachutes, Pep,” Tony had said, astonished. “If anything, he’s a bad influence!”
Steve groaned and buried his face in his hands. As the Crown Prince, he didn’t frequent brothels himself, there was too much risk involved, but even he knew of the fierce madam who ran Brooke’s most prominent brothel, the
"Sorry," Tony says. "Guess I'm out of it. You...you don't have to wait on me, you know."
This fic is still mostly vibes but I'm excited to see where it goes. Thank you to everyone who very enthusiastically let me know how much you wanted to see more of this fic! Your comments really do help motivate me to keep going.
about the mental toll Bruce’s snap would have on everyone.
. Sir Brock Rumlow, one of his father’s more brutish knights, had gone back on a payment after one of Madam Natalia’s girls claimed that he was far too rough. Steve hadn’t seen the girl, but rumors of how badly Sir Brock had beaten her had made their way to court as gossip was wont to do. Bruised ribs, a black eye, and even missing teeth. Hearing the rumor had made him sick to his stomach but seeing Madam Natalia’s revenge curdled his blood.

Home was…home was…
At first, Steve didn’t want to go near the New York Sanctum with a ten foot pole, but in those early weeks after the Battle of New York before he and Tony had had their breakthrough, Steve had ached desperately for a friend. And seeing as his current friends had still been stuck in their “Oh my God, it’s Captain America” phase, his options were sorely limited. He actually liked Brita. She had a sharp wit to her that Steve enjoyed. One moment he’d be peacefully drinking his tea and the next nearly choking on it as his brain would register whatever Brita had said.
Tony looked down, slowly taking a seat on the nearest work bench. “Cap, I’ve been asking myself that for years.”
Things get more complicated after that.
" but nothing ever comes. It's hard to be afraid of a man in bunny slippers and who's currently turning so red he could resemble a strawberry.
“Steve?” Bruce asked, a hand tentatively reaching out towards him. “You okay there? You just froze out of nowhere.”
soul?
For once, he had the time and the materials and the semi-peace of mind to draw again and Steve found himself drawing anything and everything. From simple reference drawings of things like bowls of fruit or the silhouette of the tower against the Manhattan skyline, to memories from the other timeline, smudged at the edges, their was always one constant figure in Steve’s drawings; Tony. Tony wrapped up in his Iron Man blanket and Tony with eye bags and dark circles and Tony with sunglasses and sharp Tom Ford suits; it seemed as if every other page was dedicated to Tony. But how could Steve
He didn't know whether to push Tony off or pull him closer.
"Do that again," Tony somehow manages to gasp out. "Fuck, Steve,
The boardroom falls silent as Steve’s words sink in. Tony’s stomach practically drops to the floor, and he has the strange urge to vomit. Using the staff to make weapons? The engineer in him could fathom that. But to tempt those in need with stability and shelter? To subject them to unimaginable horrors for the sake of world domination? How could anyone be that heartless?
“More like
Tony’s lips find their way to the shell of Steve’s ear. “Hold me, please?” he whispers. Steve tenses, every muscle in his body coiled like a tiger ready to strike.
