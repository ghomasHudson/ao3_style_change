eventually they do untie him though, and after bobby's locked all the alcohol away in some secret safe god-knows-where cas comes downstairs. he apparently learned things like showering and shaving without them, which dean's vaguely grateful for, except for how he'll have to pottytrain emmy soon so he didn't really escape. cas and emmy learn to eat at the same time, and he starts off about as unsteady on his feet, though he sits out on the porch steps or wanders around the junkyard. one day dean wakes from a nap to find cas leading her back through the door, two of his fingers clutched in her little hand. dean is up immediately and scooping her up, but he throws cas a nod and a grunted "thanks."
Cas shrugs. “Someone needs to take up Bobby’s role as information collator. I know a great deal about most of the things you hunt.”
cas was the youngest of five children, all adopted by a good, well-off christian couple in the mid-70s (somewhere in the bible belt because names?). nick and michael first, who swiftly became inseperable; gabriel next once the boys were settled, who learned to amuse himself when michael and nick shut him out of their games; then anna, when michael and nick were teens and falling out, michael taking her under his wing and nick turning to gabe; and finally cas, who his parents weren't really looking for but who they heard about on a thursday like it was meant to be. the boy next door, balthazar, moved in when he was about six and balthazar was about ten and they quickly became best friends and went to sunday school together (balthazar is also who taught him to swear, to question what he's told to blindly believe, to kiss). hester, rachael and inias are friends from college; alfie is one of his graduate students who worships the groud he walks on. once cas was at college and happy his parents announced they were becoming missionaries and disaster relief aid workers; sold their house and most of their stuff and left. modern tech is not really their thing and in any case 95% of the places they go don't have wifi, so they write letters every few months, and send parcels back full of local trinkets and a few polaroids.
She presses three fingers to Cas’s temple and he shivers to a stop, head rolling to one side and hand falling away, leaving a bloody smudge on Dean’s shirt. The wounds in his hands and feet close up but don’t disappear entirely, leaving round pink scars behind. “They were angel swords,” Emmy explains, lower lip trembling a little, eyes wide. “But Da, I don’t know how to- his
“Our deal was, I would go in his place. At the happiest moment of my life, the Empty would come and take me away. The price was my life, the best moment of my life; when I experienced true happiness, the Empty would be summoned. I made the deal, because it was for Jack, and I waited, wondering what the moment would be,
Dean hands over the Impala’s keys with token reluctance, then goes and sprawls out on the cheap orange couch, which sags under his weight. Cas lurks where he is for a minute, then comes over to crouch between Dean and the ancient TV, claws still kneading at the carpet. Dean flicks it round, seeing if he can find anything that looks remotely interesting, then gives it up as a bad job and leaves it on some news report or other, distracted by the constant movement in his peripheral vision.
," Cas murmurs, knuckle dragging over Sam's nose as he drops his hand, and Sam catches it, blinking the tears free.
“Sam, it’s me, you gotta get your ass back home, now. The angels have got Emmy, and Cas is gone with everything smashed to shit, and I just- I need you back here, okay? Like, now.”
"I seriously do. Where'd you say yours was, anyway? I'll get it off the road and into storage for the night."
Cas in hanging on the wall above three more angels, the silver swords through his hands and feet glimmering in the firelight. There are crimson tracks over his skin and down the wall, but worse than that is the faint glow around the wounds, the last remnants of his grace bleeding away.
'the old routine' also means that...weirdness between dean and cas, now less complicated by the whole 'oh, he's an angel' thing. cas still stands too close, stares too long and leans into dean when dean teaches him to shoot, and it's worse with emmy, especially when sam catches dean watching cas with her and jokes about telling her she has two daddies. dean tells him to shut the fuck up and shoves him hard enough to unbalance him, but it doesn't stop sam laughing or cas and emmy's scarily identical curious faces.
Dean eyes Cas speculatively where he’s completing his millionth circuit of the room, tail lashing furiously and ears tilted half-back, clearly pissed as hell but stuck like this.
Connor shrugs, losing interest in the conversation. "Sometimes, when I say stuff. Mostly it's quiet though." He scoops a bunch of soldiers together, drawing them towards him. "You wanna play?"
Bobby looks like he’s been pole-axed. Very gently, he reaches out and runs a finger down his namesake’s cheek. “Dee, I...”
“Time for what? And what’s with the meat-market routine?” Dean asks, twisting to follow him, and Cas’s hand lands on his shoulder, holding him still as he circles him. “Dude, seriously, ow. You just healed all my bruises.”
in bed, and then twitches again and draws in a slow breath because fuck if he isn’t getting hard anyway.
Dean tries to be offended but gets distracted by Cas’s thumb rubbing over the head of his dick, slick and so good. “Yeah, but- but not being able to get it up again so soon is normal. A-also, my dick is not a, a ‘physical infliction’.” He rolls his head back into the pillow, arching into Cas’s touch. “Fuck it, keep doin’ that.”
uh, some kind of gen Glee crossover, where they have to stop at Burt's because there's a problem with the Impala and Kurt and Blaine (and Finn and Rachel) are around and Dean has to reevaluate his opinions of gays when Kurt shrugs into a pair of overalls and wriggles his way under the car to pass Dean some wrench or something and Blaine's off to the side all "Oh, yeah, he's good at this sort of thing *__*"
, okay, I’ll probably get burned at the stake if they see you acting like-” and waves a hand at him.
,” and she tears it deftly open, dropping the packet to the floor, “that in nine months there won’t be any cute little baby angels running around.”
Cas has the sense to bring Novath in over the sea, so when the blue drops him at the water's edge Imp and Kaz have already been persuaded up to the ridge, where there's some scanty grass and the shade of the wagon to rest in. They both flinch when Novath dives into the water, but they dismiss it pretty quickly and return to grazing, though they stick close together.
“Think you already did,” Dean drawls, and watches Cas duck his head, smile flashing across his face, “but yeah. Can you mojo this back together? Cause otherwise I’m gonna have to start sending you my shopping bills.”
"Man's handy with a hammer and no mistake," Bobby agrees from behind them. "And unlike you two idjits, he don't assume bed and board means he gets to criticize my cooking."
castiel is firm in the belief that humans are scum, the earth is corrupt and the apocalypse is the best thing for it. when the croatoan virus is released he dispassionately watches it spread across the earth like a stain, and shakes his head at the small and dwindling pockets of human reisitance. then raphael is sent to fetch the human dean winchester, who is to be michael's vessel on earth, but he is the opposite of the righteous man he is meant to be, spitting and swearing and attacking any angel who comes near him. they leave him in a holding cell, but he overpowers one of the guards and escapes, and for some reason he can't name castiel, when he feels the power of the manifesting door and goes to investigate, lets him go. the same curiosity prompts him to follow the human back to earth, where he loses track of him but encounters anna and balthazar, both of whom he had been told were dead for their rebellion. he tries to ignore them, but they were his friends and they urge him to question why zachariah told him they were dead. he confronts michael, who finally tells him that his ex-friends were dangerous and cas was in danger of falling ("oh castiel, they were clearly broken"), but he's better than them. cas is confused, because anna used to be head of his garrison and a good, faithful soldier, as was balthazar. michael tries to show him that the rebels are scum by letting him watch the torture of samandriel, who's been found to have links with the fallen, but cas can't stand it and, when his protests fall on deaf ears, kills the torturer. stunned and afraid, he flees and hides himself on earth, subduing his grace with various illegal rituals - only to be picked up by dean winchester and his brother, who investigate this kind of weird shit for a living. dean is sceptical at first, but sam seems delighted that they have an angel on their side and insists on keeping him. cas learns how to be human in this little hunter enclave, and eventually dean comes round and they fall in love.
The handprint on his shoulder prickles. It’s nothing, the lightest feather-brush, but it tickles down his arm and he twitches a finger against the rough brick of the wall. It sends flares of agony needling back up, but he can move. He flicks his eyes away from Emmy’s in case the angels notice anything, and across the room he finds Cas looking back at him, eyes barely open but showing a sliver of blue.
"Hey, woah," Dean reassures her, a hand on her arm, "chill. Angels are real but they're 99% douchbags, and jury's still out on on the Big Cahuna himself. Bible's...uh, well, it's kind true in some bits-"
Dean raises an eyebrow, pushing himself back upright. "You didn't know war was exhausting? No offense Cas, but what, didja think Raphael was just gonna roll over and give it up? That's not how it works, dude."
“Because I do,” Emmy says enigmatically, and Dean rolls his eyes. Even when it’s his own kid, angels don’t give straight answers.
The bird-daemon cocks his head. "God is with us," he translates, matching Cas's careful tone. "It's a good name. It fits." He twists to look at Dean. "Thank you, Dean."
"Show me," Cas says, and Dean shuffles closer, squirts a generous amount down the length of Cas's (long, slim) fingers and wraps his own around them, smirking as he twists his wrist, spreading the lube around, then drags his fist up and down Cas's fingers, making sure they're coated in the stuff. "I'm sure manually stimulating my fingers isn't necessary," Cas says dryly, and Dean snickers.
I have a giant soft spot for Bobby/Rufus being gruff old hunters together and never letting each other get too bogged down in the horror of the job
His intention is not truly to express gratitude for his redemption, but Castiel takes it as such anyway and reaches out to the rest of the Host, exhausted but satisfied with a job well done. The Host receive the news with joy, pass it among their ranks, and soon every angel there ever was or is knows and rejoices.
Cas doesn't answer, but he stays rigid, shoulders straight and chin up, and Destruction smiles at him as he slings a ratty bag over one shoulder and heads for Bobby's gates.
Dean thunks his forehead into Cas’s shoulder. “We’re being ordered around by a voyeuristic plant,” he groans, and Cas pets his hair. “Just so you know, this was
The Hufflepuff common room, once Dean had squeezed through, turned out to be big and circular and full of big squishy buttercup-yellow armchairs and wooden tables surrounded by chairs upholstered in black and gold. Candlelight was reflected in the burnished copper hanging on the walls, and the windows were wide expanses of blank black glass that, in daylight, would obviously light the whole room. It was pretty full, people obviously meeting up with friends after the summer break and filling them in their lives, sitting on the tables or huddled in the armchairs, with the little knot of first-years bunched nervously together in front of the entrance eyeing everything with interest and a little apprehension.
, tie loosened and shirt barely unbuttoned but it’s more skin than he’s ever shown before and she just wants to...
And then their daemons untangle themselves and get to their feet, Vim shaking like she’s just been swimming and Tsalia pausing to stretch, and the moment is gone. Vim says something, nudging at Cas’s arm, and Cas refastens his jeans and rolls back up onto his feet, apparently unconcerned by the wet stain on his shirt. Dean strips out of his own shirt and pulls on a new one, already acting like nothing has happened, and when he goes back to the table and its maps Tsalia settles, sphinx-like, at his side. Cas reclaims his bottle and swigs the remainder of the contents in one long swallow, then sketches Dean a mocking salute and heads for the door.
"She is no such thing," Castiel objects, humour in his voice, and Dean grins over his shoulder at him.
it sang, far too relieved to have the rest of the school’s attention off him for a moment, but he knew it involved talking about how awesome each of the houses were and almost managed to sell him on Slytherin, and then it stopped and the eyes were back on them and Professor Flitwick stepped forward.
“Marked?” Dean squints down at himself like he’s suddenly gonna see some kind of glowy graffiti. “Well can’t you just, y’know, bathe it in holy light or whatever and wash it off?”
"They are merely impressions, the closest human eyes can come to seeing the glory of my true form," he says quietly, and Dean rolls his eyes, smirking a little.
Cas is also a surprise; the way Sam tells it she’d been expecting some kind of uptight, prissy-looking librarian type, probably wearing a shirt with his jeans and maybe even a tie. But Cas is wearing a blue t-shirt and has bare feet; several of his toenails are painted pink and purple. He’s got a serious case of bedhead going on, and his eyes are creepily similar to Emmy’s, blue and intense.
The slam of the front door makes the cows shuffle uneasily, and Dean hears the milkmaids muttering among themselves, but they don’t get hustled out onto the porch so obviously Bobby just meant the marching band. In any case, kicking those poor girls out in the middle of the night would be cruel.
Once he's done Dean takes a second to sit back, pleased with himself, and to admire the sight of an angel so blissed out he looks like he'd sink into the mattress if he could. Then he leans back down and rolls his thumbs just under the points of Cas's shoulderblades, and Cas makes a soft grumbling noise and rearranges himself, the bones shifting under his skin. Dean bends further forward, arms braced on either side of Cas's body, and bites gently where one of his thumbs was just working, then sucks over the tip of the bone, and Cas shudders helplessly, spine arching, Dean's name spilling from him on a breathless gasp.
Dean stands and comes to hold the pad against the wound, fingertips brushing against warm skin. “Come here, I’ll do it,” he offers, taking the bandages from St Claire and looping them underneath his arm and across his shoulder and then down around his upper arm.
“I’m sure I won’t,” Cas says, but there’s no annoyance there, only fondness. “You be careful though.”
"Soon," Sam says, playing with Iope's tail, winding it round his hand and letting it flow through his fingers. "If you're so eager, go set the table."
He almost hits some chick in a pastel blue minivan on his way out, but fuck her, she got her kid safe in the back, sprawled against the seat with legs too short to reach the floor. He guns the engine the moment he’s out and the Impala thunders forward; normally he’d be exhilarated but right now he’s just glad to be moving. The library should be pretty empty this time of day, with the older kids still in school and the nerds still in class or at work, so he’ll be able to just get in, grab Cas and go. Fuck Bobby for going out to help with that fucking suspected werewolf pack on the other side of the state, and fuck Sam for being in freaking
out there, no damn wonder you were shivering, Adelaide. Your car's fine by the way, it's in the shop. Haven't got much to do right now, so assuming it's not anything weird you should be off again tomorrow." He offloads everything into the fridge, shuffling some stuff around to make it fit, then shrugs off his jacket and tucks his fingers behind Mariah's ears where she’s trotted over to greet him. "Hey sweetheart, I promise I was only out for fifteen minutes, nothin’ to worry about."
"You seriously do fix cars?" It's out before she can think to filter herself, and she winces at the rudeness of it, but Dean just laughs, low and genuine.
Crowley smirks. "Now see, that's a little intangible for me. Normally it'd be your soul, but regrettably you don't have one. What about a millennium or two as my
Dean blinks at the ceiling. It’s white, and kinda swirly, and there’s a chandelier hanging from it. He’s pretty sure the kinds of rooms that have chandeliers are out of their price range.
"No, no, we're just gonna-" Sam says, jerking a thumb at the door, because yeah, much as he'd love to just sit here and stare at his nephew forever, the kid has needs and he's already seen Dee shirtless
"That is unfortunate, though you’ve come to the right place for assistance," he says, coming down the steps to meet her, and the dogs apparently take it as permission and come scuffling after him. He's backlit by the warm glow of the house lights like some kind of angel, hair messy and eyes warm as he watches her crouch to say hello to the dogs, which are snuffling enthusiastically at her feet. "Please, come in."
[I don't remember where this one was going either. Nowhere darker than it's already been though, and it would have ended up like the show episode. I think]
"Yeah, well, this is Purgatory, Dean. We gotta think bigger," she says, almost fond, and nudges at his arm. "Keep pressure on that."
It takes Dean maybe three tries to get the key in the lock, and then once he manages it the inward swing of the door almost pulls him off his feet where he’s been unconsciously leaning on it. He manages to shut it behind him and tips his forehead into the cool glass, just for a moment, and listens to his own breathing; lets his eyes finally close until it’s just him in the dark, safe at home and letting something else hold him up.
"Our realms are not shut to angel-kind unless we require them to be," Daniel says, which isn't an answer at all, but then his fingers close around Dean's wrist, light and cool, and suddenly they're not in the diner any more, but a garden, paths winding away in every direction and flowers clustering neatly and colourfully alongside them.
“Well maybe you should try harder.” Dean leans over the flames, ignoring the way the heat of them burns at his face, his throat, his chest, and drops the next match. The next concentric circle lights up, smaller than the first, and Joshua sucks in a startled breath.
“This sort of, of fraternisation is what I’m supposed to be preventing,” Cas says insistently, but it lacks conviction and his eyes have dropped to Dean’s mouth, and Dean smirks at him.
Dean can only gape at him and make vague spluttering noises, then stares down at his left hand. It’s still bare.
After a moment, Dean draws his arm out from under Cas’s head with a groan. “Damn Cas, you need to lay off the burgers,” he murmurs, shaking the pins and needles out, and Emmy zaps away so he can slide carefully along the couch and off, leaving Cas there. He goes to join Emmy in the armchair and they sit there in the quiet and listen to Cas breathe, smooth and even.
Dean scrubs a hand through his hair. "Uh, yeah, about that. Ol- Destruction said you guys sorta...had a bone to pick with us. But if you knew what was gonna happen all along...?"
and a click of his fingers. "Are you alright?" he calls, voice rough like he smokes several packs a day or something, and she clears her throat before she answers.
So Dean is maybe twenty minutes late to work, whoops - but Cas’ll still make his flight and now at least they’ve both got some good memories to tide them over for the next five days. It’s not like there’s anything important he has to do right now anyway, just a bunch of paperwork he’s been putting off and failing to palm off on Jo.
There's nothing to say to that, so Dean doesn't, only inches his hand a little further out until it brushes Tsalia's shoulder.
This time, there is no garrison backing him up, no brothers and sisters to help him carve a path to the soul flickering but defiant amidst all the horrors of the Pit; there is just Castiel, alone but for the purpose singing through his Grace, in what he cannot help but think of as his heart. Last time he was just another angel; this time demons flee before him and cower from the blaze of his conviction.
“Yeah, Amelia says she learned it from her grandma and it’s an old family recipe, even though we keep telling her if she sold it she’d make millions.”
“That a wand in your pocket or are you just pleased to see me,” Dean murmurs, nipping at his lower lip, his hand curving around Cas’s hip and down to the front of his trousers, and Cas hitches in a breath as Dean’s palm smooths over his cock. He surges forward, hands falling from Dean’s hips to smack onto the desk with a faint sizzle, and the kiss breaks so he can bury his face in Dean’s shoulder as his wings snap out with a rush of air and the dry, silky rustle of scales. “Mmm yeah, there you go baby,” Dean purrs, dropping his other hand down to stroke the bottom edge of one of the wings, the scales soft and smooth under his fingers, and Cas chokes off a moan and sucks at his neck, probably hard enough to leave a mark and thank god it’s winter and he has an excuse to wear a scarf-
“Gabriel said it was traditional,” Cas says quietly, looking at Dean with that little half-smile and the particular kind of openness and affection Dean’s never seen him direct at anyone else.
The kiss deepens, as much as it can, and then Cas wrenches himself away, pushing Dean harder against the wall, making sure he’s safe, and the darkness takes him too.
“He declared himself a false god,” the same angel says, eerily, insanely calm. Though it’s wearing Mrs Graham, it’s obvious she isn’t home right now. “Precedent says that this is the punishment to fit such a crime. He has chosen to live amongst humans, so by human rules shall he die.”
“We won’t outlast her, she’s gonna break through. And then she’ll kill us; you, me, them, in whatever order we throw ourselves at her. One of us is gonna have to watch the other one die again, and I’m- Cas, I’m sorry.”
Dean narrows his eyes at him. They’re about the same height and roughly the same build, but St Claire’s injury would probably allow Dean the upper hand in a fight. “How the fuck did they let you into the Corps?”
He takes the car up to Bobby’s near the end of the second week and tries not to treat it like a pilgrimage. Jody had told him gently when asked that nothing’s happened to the property, no one’s bought it or anything, and that she’s pretty sure no one will because it’d be too much work to clear it up and start over when there are empty houses closer to town. Sam leaves the car at the gate and walks in under the Singer Salvage sign, stopping to take it all in. The cars are all still there, rusting quietly away under the open sky, and if he keeps the house in the corner of his eye he can pretend it’s still whole, that Bobby might come out at any minute and scold him for standing around like a poleaxed chipmunk where there’s shit to get done. Eventually he gets up the courage to turn and look at it properly, blackened and broken open and empty, like a harbinger of its owner’s doom. The wallpaper inside is charred and smoke-damaged, the carefully-labeled phones melted and dead, all the books reduced to ash. The staircase to the cellar doesn’t look like it’ll support his weight anymore, but Iope drops down and picks her way past the wreck of the washing machines and all Bobby’s other detritus, and reports when she comes back that the panic room seems perfectly intact.
Also, for anyone wondering, Vim's full name is Telocvovim, Enochian for 'of him that has fallen'. In the absence of anyone else to do it, Cas named her himself.
Cas's skin is warm under Dean's hands; he always runs hot, probably something to do with the Chrysler building-sized angel all coiled up inside. Sometimes, it's a little hard to remember that the angel Castiel is merely borrowing this body, that the windswept hair and the curious eyes and the low, deliberate voice aren't his; that this creature Dean has grown to care for so much is really insubstantial and unbearable, a flare of light and raw power.
“Pastor Jim understands that you worked late last night and that, as a consequence, I might also be late today.”
Eventually they collect themselves and head down the road in front of them, and shortly a very familiar building comes into view.
"Dean," Sam says absently, most of his attention on the local paper spread out in front of him, "we don't know it even
“Come on,” Iope says softly, reaching up to wrap her little fingers around his and tugging him away, and he lets her lead him back to the car.
“Doves are white,” Dean scoffs, resolutely ignoring the bowl full of plump ripe pears in favour of some left-over take-out.
“Oh, I’m not-” Dean starts, ducking his head, and St Claire huffs, then draws a harsher breath as he begins to work at the dried blood crusted at the edges of the wound. “What does it mean, Conesta?” Dean asks, to distract him. “Sam - that’s my brother - he’s the Latin scholar in the family.”
Charlie closes her eyes, sagging in relief. "Oh thank god," (she looks guilty for a second, then shrugs it off) "after everything else you've told me I don't think I could handle tentacle porn being real too."
the 7.21 AU where they come back to get Cas only to find him huddled in a corner of solitary, the material round the walls shredded, furniture smashed, and the bedframe twisted and warped while he mutters to himself about bees and chews nervously at the sleeves of his straitjacket. Debris crunches underfoot, and they turn stunned, furious eyes on Meg, who shrugs. "What was I supposed to do? Stop him?"
That’s why he’s deliberately not thinking about it now, blanking everything from his mind but the skin under his mouth, the slope of Cas’s back and the final curve of his spine. He slides his hands down after him, Cas gone still under them, cautious and disbelieving, and it’s that which finally gets Dean; he smooths his palms over Cas’s hips, round to the tops of his thighs and up over his ass, and when Cas even stops breathing Dean huffs a laugh and dips his head down.
“Back seat,” she says, releasing his thumb with a gentle nip of teeth, and stretches over him so she can pop the door. He makes a quiet little amused noise, and then there’s that rustle of displaced air and he’s there. She twists so she can glare at him, and even in the dark she can hear him smile.
and grab Cas by the hip, roll him over and kiss him breathless, hands running out over his wings. But no, Cas needs this and he'll damn well finish what he started, and before he can think better of it he pulls Cas's nearest leg up into his lap and spans his hand over the top of Cas's thigh, rolling his fingertips and kind of kneading a little at the flesh beneath them. Cas exhales in a muffled rush, twitching under Dean's hand like he was expecting something else, and Dean can't help a smirk. That makes two of them then.
"Cas!" Dean yells. "Cas!" and only the wind and the whooping howls answer him. "You get your feathery ass back here, you bastard, we gotta stick together in this shithole!"
"It waits for me to get back from school, and it kind of jumps up and down when it sees me, like a dog." He beams down at it, patting it gently with his whole hand. "Sometimes I even think it knows what I'm saying."
also Ellen was probably going to have dated Annie, the lady hunter from S7 who died within the first five minutes but spent most of the episode teaming up with ghost!Bobby to help with the case - and who it was revealed had slept with Bobby and both Winchesters, sigh. Her arrangement with Ellen would've been semi-permanent (ie always had an expiration date) but they spent a good few years and a significant chunk of Jo's life happy, and parted on good terms.
Finally he’s done, and he steps away and throws the bloody water out over the hillside, where it stains the grass briefly brown. “I don’t think there’s any way to properly secure the bandages,” he calls, and the aviator waves a hand, composure restored along with his beast’s.
Cas won’t wake. Dean calls his name, shakes him, feels him still warm under his hands and that has to mean something, right? But there’s no pulse under his frantic fingers, no rattle of breath as Cas mumbles that he should stop shouting, and the gashes across his chest and that central red puncture are bleeding sluggishly at best.
dean grows a beard when emmy’s about five, as an experiment. cas complains and dean tells him to suck it up, but shaves it off again. he lets his stubble get heavier after that though, and eventually cas just stops complaining. he grows his own beard intermittently though, in protest, until he can’t bear it any more cause it itches too much/makes him feel like a hobo/reminds him of his time in russia.
"Nah," Benny says easily, leaning back on his arms. "You're not that kinda person, brother. Takes a special kinda human t'end up in monster hell with his daemon intact, lookin' for an angel. And that kinda person don't have a daemon that trots around following the pack and the rules."
“Yeah. Like I said, I was gonna do it right, candles and champagne and, and rose petals and shit, but...” she shrugs. “That hooker hadn’t really unwrapped you, but she’d got started and since you normally look like some repressed tax accountant it was a big deal.” She slants a look at him. “I don’t think you get how much willpower I had to not just grab you by the tie and ravish you right there.”
Turns out that the parents aren't much help either; all they know is their precious little darlings never came home from school four days ago. They haven't noticed anyone acting strangely lately, no one new skulking around the neighbourhood, and the weirdest thing they've seen recently is the frogs that keep turning up on their front porch.
“Guess that answers that,” Dean remarks, not taking his eyes off Cas in case he misses something, and Sam nods.
“He didn’t choose, your fucking God kicked him out!” (Keep them talking, keep them talking and away from his family.)
Cas is definitely amused now, mouth quirking and eyes crinkled. “Forgive me if I don’t join you in this one, Dean.”
It would be an understatement to say that Dean isn’t expecting the Cas that he finds past the bead curtain, sitting cross-legged on the floor and apparently conducting some kind of tantric yoga session. He tips Dean a wink when he sees him, tells the women grouped around him to go get ready for the orgy and grins wide and dopey as they leave, and behind him a scruffy tan, black and white dog-daemon stretches herself playfully out on the floor.
“Cas?” Dean repeats stupidly, then looks around, expecting that rustle of wings right behind him. “He’s here? He’s- he got out?”
Under Alistair, this place was full of the damned, hanging from racks or nooses or crosses; the floor was soaked in the gore of unnumbered souls, the walls running with blood and filth. Some of them called out to Castiel as he passed, or cursed at him, or pleaded with him for forgiveness; demons had thronged amongst them, whispering and caressing and taunting, glancing up at the approaching angels with manic glee or undisguised intent. Castiel remembers how many were lost here, overpowered and set upon, necessitating others to go to their rescue and themselves fall victim; he remembers what was done to them, how they screamed, the dying flare of their Grace and the fall of feathers through the air. However righteous his mission, he would be unwise to continue traveling alone here.
“Cool,” the boy said, and disappeared, reappearing a few moments later with a loud scraping noise as he dragged his trunk over to the the storage area.
, and stumbles over to her crib. she blinks back at him, lifts her arms towards him, and he grabs her up and cradles her to him, burying his face in her fine hair. "emmy, sweetheart, jesus you just saved our asses, knew we kept you round for a reason, emmy emmy
The kid is eyeballing them, a second away from opening her mouth and screaming the house down, and then Cas starts towards her, hand extended, going for her new toy, and she rears back, eyes wide, swings it up to point at him and yells "NO!"
“Yeah okay, so he made some mistakes,” Sam counters heatedly, “but he doesn’t deserve to be handed over to Crowley on a platter, Dean. We’ve both been to Hell, think...think how much worse it would be for him, for betraying the
“The point is,” Bobby continues loudly after a second, as if Dean had never spoken, “stop naturalizing my yard!”
bobby has some news about weird gas explosions/etc. something something alphas. on the drive, sam hums ‘stairway to heaven’ even though it’s not on
sam's got his monkey-arms wrapped around both of them and bobby when there's that whisper of wings and dean's got the sword out faster than he can blink, sam and bobby too, and joshua holds both hands up and stays where he is.
“Hey, sweetheart no, it’s okay, it’s not your fault,” Dean tells her, lifting an arm away from Cas to pull her into his side. “You healed him, right? So he’ll be fine. I mean, he’ll probably be asleep for a while, but then he’ll be fine, okay? I promise.”
Okay, so this fic is my baby. It has been in my head for 3 fucking years, and I have vowed to write it out so many times, but as always my ambition is larger by far than my ability. Nevertheless, I love it too much to leave it unpublished, even if it is just scraps and bare bones.
it takes another few weeks before they properly touch on the fact that emmy is cas's child too, and from there, the circumstances of her 'birth' and everything associated. it's not a happy conversation, and there is a lot of shouting and a few days of tense silences which confuse and irritate emmy, but finally they both agree to disagree and they both admit they may have been stupid and then they resume the sex thing.
“That some of your magic angel mojo?” he asks, shifting his hips forward as Cas pushes himself up onto an elbow and wraps his hand around him again, and Cas hums an affirmative, though with his voice it comes out almost a purr. “Huh. Neat.”
” says the voice in his ear, staticy and too loud, and Sam swallows down the nausea and makes himself say clearly, “Yeah, I think my sister’s in premature labour, she’s like six weeks early. We’re out at All Souls Church?”
When Dean starts working in earnest, flicking his tongue over the muscle, Cas jerks hard enough to make the bed springs squeak, something rasping and ancient spilling from his mouth. Dean flicks his eyes up and finds him braced on his forearms with his head bowed, wings half-spread and quivering, shoulders drawn tight, and closes them again so he can concentrate on lapping right at the centre, insistent and heavy. He can pick his name out of the stream of Enochian swearing or whatever it is Cas is saying, and the rest of it is making the back of his neck prickle so he’s half expecting the bedside lamp to explode or the windows to blow out.
“No, you don’t.” Cas’s eyes are almost glowing in the darkness, the faint promise of fury shining through. “I can’t just ‘stop it’, Dean, because the deal has already been made. Fifty thousand souls have already been loaned to me to prevent an immediate apocalypse, and despite my best efforts, that debt can only be re-payed with souls from Purgatory.”
"You think I would want you in the middle of this?" Cas snaps, suddenly right back in Dean's space, the trenchcoat catching against his shirt. "I'm
A sleek black car is parked off to the side of a road, in a clearing between trees. Above it is the wide open night sky, dotted with stars and never truly dark. Nebulae bloom slowly across it, and the aurora flickers and dances. Occasionally, fireworks take their turn to pop and burst into the blackness.
“sam, i did not tell you wonder off like some child distracted by cotton candy, okay? now get in the car”
“Well jesus, if you’re still talking like that then you clearly aren’t,” she says, and leans forward to cup her hand over him, squeezing a little. Cas’s whole body jerks, a breathless little noise escaping him and his fingers twitching against her, and she rolls absently down against them and hums, smoothing her palm up over his length and back down, then looks up and grins at him. “Clothes off then, Mr Expert.”
“’S not a problem,” Dean says, not quite truthfully but honestly enough. “The Corps do enough for us.”
“I doubt anyone ever got denied entry to Auror training just for sneaking into the Prefect’s Bathroom,” Dean retorted. “And everyone knows Potter spent half
He’s almost okay, Sam finds, if he only takes shallow breaths, doesn’t try and expand his ribcage too far and come up against what feels like a vice around his chest. In the dark he can see better too, the only light coming from the moon and maybe a little from the long trailing flares of the falling angels. One actually goes right overhead, crashing into the water nearby with a heavy splash, and Sam wonders if it’s like Cas, heavy clothes, suit and shoes and long coat dragging it down, impeding limbs that don’t even really know how to function in the first place.
“Don’t do this,” Dean says, urgent, but behind him he feels the horrible sucking void of the Empty come into being, the absolute cold of nothingness that pulls at him steadily, seeking out his life, his warmth.
"Dean," Cas says, almost a growl, and when he opens his eyes to smirk at him Cas grabs him by the scruff of the neck and kisses him, lubed fingers wrapping around his cock and making Dean's hips stutter forward.
“Please don’t call me that,” the spaniel says flatly, opening her eyes. “And you can’t help, it’s not- you can’t fix it.”
"I don't want to put you to any trouble," Adelaide says dutifully, even though hot chocolate sounds amazing right now, and Dean snorts.
"Yes ma'am," Sam says smoothly. "We hear your husband hasn't been into work all this week, and with all these neighbourhood children going missing we thought it best to check up on any other potentially similar cases."
"I've been told I'm good with my hands," Sam agrees, not bothering to keep the smirk out of his voice.
Cas's nails scrabble against the couch cushions, keen building in her throat and legs shaking, and Sam presses his calves carefully further back against the couch, trapping her ankles so she doesn't brain Dean with her thrashing or wrap her legs around his head like she'd so clearly like to and suffocate him. Not that Dean looks like he'd care, eyes closed like he's completely zen-ed out as he does whatever it is he's doing that s making Cas's voice break and her whole body tremble. Dean rides the bucking of her hips easily, his hold on her keeping her from fucking his face too wildly, and when she finally stills he opens his eyes and looks up at her.
Cas glares at her, but doesn’t reply. They lie in silence for a while, and Dee reaches up to drag her fingers through the fog on the window above her.
cas is a theology/religious studies professor with a focus on early-middle eastern religions. he speaks (well, reads) like six different languages, enochian and aramaic and hebrew and old egyptian and probably some old arabic, and he's passable at latin and ancient greek. he turns up at dean's work because their latest killer is a religious nutjob who's relying on satanic/esoteric rituals as settings for his killings, and who leaves messages in enochian(?) at the kill sites, and cas is in the area giving a talk to the local university.
you have also been transformed into a vampire and held captive by a goddess. You are rash, Dean, and heedless of the consequences should you die, not least of which is that Sam would not longer be constrained by your morality and free to do as he pleased. I am no longer at liberty to sit on your shoulder, and there may come a time soon when I will be unable to protect you at all. Perhaps you should think about that before you choose to throw yourself into any further danger.”
His fingers are warm and she snaps her hand back around his wrist, already so close, and just grinds down against them as her thighs start to shake. Cas, miracle that he is, just goes with it, fingers molding against her cunt with just the right pressure and palm right fucking perfect against her clit, and she fucks down against his hand and tries to remember to bite back all her usual seriously blasphemous curses as pleasure goes slamming up her spine.
, and that being near him made her feel wrong too, and from then on, even when they’re out in public, Sam’s been acting like she doesn’t exist.
“Are you, um-” Dean stops, clears his throat, tries again. “Do you want me to fetch you a spare shirt?”
“Give a guy a little warning, Cas,” Dean manages once Cas is settled, and in answer Cas surges forward and kisses him hard enough to knock Dean’s head off the headboard and wraps his hand over the scar on Dean’s shoulder. That familiar jolt of heat goes straight down to Dean’s dick and he rolls his hips up without thinking about it, and Cas makes an approving noise that buzzes against his lips and takes it, then rocks back down.
Cas turns to him slowly, like his head's heavy to move. "You still will," he says, pronouncing each syllable carefully like he's checking he's still speaking English. His face softens, open and unbearably fond. "You can't save everyone, Dean."
, and God likes you so much he keeps bringin' you back from the dead. What the hell do you need some smarmy bastard like Crowley for?"
Castiel frowns. "It's where monsters go when they die, and also serves as a prison for those creatures too old and powerful for Hell."
"A whelp," Crowley answers. "Born a few minutes ago - you have to take them away or they'll get eaten. They don't make very good mothers."
Cas inclines his head, then goes over to Sam and touches his hand. The bitemark disappears, but the dog goes fucking
you” and “you don’t even fucking care anyway” and “this is all just a bad trip to you, right?” - and Cas answers, quiet and reasonable but with a smirk lurking on his mouth, and under the table their daemons are tensed, not looking at each other but coiled like springs.
“And somehow I still find your predictability endearing,” Cas says dryly as he pulls the sheets down and manhandles Dean under them, and Dean makes smug noises, grabs for the nearest part of Cas he can reach and presses a kiss there. Cas huffs, but it’s fond, and shuffles around until he can curl up behind Dean and Dean can turn over and press his nose to Cas’s collarbone. He must’ve ninja’d his t-shirt off, sneaky bastard.
Sam levels a look at him. “Would you want to eat that stuff if you were suddenly turned into a cat?” Dean grumbles but subsides, and they both look over at Cas, who’s standing up with his ears pricked forward like a dog. “Uh, you can just dig in, dude,” Sam says, and Cas scuttles the length of the couch, leaps down off the arm and back up into one of the chairs and up onto the table, and tucks right in, swiping the top bun away with a paw and chowing down the burger and cheese. The best part is watching him hook the meat in closer with his claws, and the cheese, which gets stuck all round his face.
Dean barks a laugh, thwarted hysteria or just overflowing glee he doesn't bother to dam. “Me? I’ll be fine, I’ll be fucking
Cas stand up too and roots around until he finds a t-shirt, shrugging out of his shirt to pull it on. “Is that a tattoo?” Dean demands, zeroing in on the patch of ink low on one side of Cas’s stomach, and Cas lifts the hem of the t-shirt to show him.
This man is robed and hooded, eyes in shadow and a large book cradled to his chest and bound in chains. Neither of these things exactly inspires confidence. Dean opens his mouth to ask
“Bethany,” he says, just like his daughter, and smiles a little, soft and welcoming. His voice is unexpectedly deep, and rough like he’s been slaving over the barbeque and breathing its smoke for hours. “It’s nice to meet you.” He comes round to their side and holds out a hand, but when she takes it he doesn’t shake, just squeezes a little then lets go again. His hands are soft and warm. “Sam’s told us a lot about you.”
“...And fuck that, what about me? Can I get in?” he adds after a period of frosty silence, and Joshua’s mouth curves, small and mean and kind of triumphant.
Dean gives him a quick smile. "Nah, that's okay, I'll leave you to your game." He ruffles Connor's hair like he just can't help himself, then stands up and takes Sam a little way off. "So, you still think it's not witches? Cause I'm pretty damn sure that toad is actually Connor's big brother."
"Don't think so," Cas said, stealing another brief, searing kiss. "Maybe I just want you to shut up."
Dean shrugs, quick and angry. “If you want. You’re the ones he sent tripping into la-la-Lucifer land.”
the one where cas has been watching humans for long enough to get bored of sex because seriously there are only so many configurations guys, and he knows what to do kthx (even if dean doesn't)
“When I call your name, you will sit on the stool and place the hat on your head while you are Sorted, then remove it and go to your assigned table,” he said, flicking his eyes up to them and smiling encouragingly. “Avery, Nicholas!”
“Yeah, but it’ll be good for like, falsifying records, IDs, whatever we need,” Sam says, getting animated now. “We’ve still got some of Bobby’s books and there's still all the Campbell stuff, we could rebuild his library, get Dad’s journal properly organized, get a proper hunter network up...” He turns to Cas. “Sounds good, right Cas?”
"Ow," Sam says succinctly, climbing down to soothe a panting Kaz, who's staring wildly at the sea like it might try and attack her too. He unhitches the wagon while he's there, and free of it Kaz stumbles a few more paces, then seems to realise that she's safe and stills, shuffling in the sand and lowering her head warily to sniff it. Imp is still trembling finely under Dean's hands, so he strips off her tack and spends a few minutes talking softly to her until she calms, going to tuck herself against Kaz for comfort.
is and Cas apparently can’t tell him. And Dean...it seems logical to believe that he and Cas are in Purgatory, together, with Dick and all the other monster souls Cas coughed back up, but without Cas or Death or Crowley and his ritual Sam can’t help him either, and in any case he might be wrong and Dean could be anywhere, Limbo or Hell or even Heaven.
Cas’s hands come up to cradle her hips. “I had worried that what you said earlier meant that this was a one-time occurrence.”
-and then Cas’s hand hauls it away again and is pulling him up and backing him up against the wall. Dean sinks both hands into his hair and kisses him, filthy and wet and trying to rub off against his stomach because he’s
“Don’t be stupid, the post won’t go ‘til tomorrow by now. I’m not gonna make you sleep in the barn or anything. I was just...” Dean looks away from that bright, unwavering stare. “C’mon, we should check on that wound.”
"Cas..." Dean put his hands on Cas's shoulders, warm even through his jumper, and dropped back down to sitting. "I'm serious man, you're goin' a bit Carrow with the power thing, even Balthazar's noticed."
She hunches down on herself, unable to argue with that. “He wasn't himself,” she mutters, but it's hollow.
Dean makes a non-committal noise. Not because he doesn’t want to pop Cas like an overblown balloon, but because the guy is actually being kind of useful for once. Okay yeah, the miraculous drought-ending and sudden and smitey death of a bunch of crazy religious groups was good too, but this is something for
and dean throws the wrapping paper at him while he cackles, then tries to persuade emmy to smite him. emmy frowns between them, then bobby tells her it's just her da and uncle sam being idjits and distracts her with her other presents. she's intrigued though, and later she makes dean read it to her, sam sniggering from the other end of the couch and cas coming to lean on the kitchen doorjamb with his stripey apron on (dean prefers him clean-shaven).
"Stay down," Tsalia snaps, and then something huge and furry and bellowing erupts from the trees and she throws herself to meet it, while a second comes hurtling out as soon as she's gone and heads straight for Dean, mad red eyes glinting in the dull light.
michael, lucifer, balthazar and gabriel are cas’s cousins of varying degrees etc etc. Gabe once says that their family tree is less a tree than it is a bramble patch - tangled and twisted and hostile to intruders. they all kind of live in one huge ancestral mansion/castle thing, but by the time dean visits in the summer of their fifth year michael and lucifer are gone and it’s just cas, balthy and gabe. chuck and becky only live in a few rooms though, cause chuck hates rattling around in the house. (this means dean and cas can slip away easily...)
Dean pulls away, point made, and Cas sighs, then there's a rustle, so quiet it's almost subliminal, like leaves in a slight breeze. The bed creaks with the new weight, and then Cas's wings are carefully unfurling on either side of Dean, slowly opening out until they're fully extended, feathers on one side catching a little against the wall.
He gives Crowley the barest nod and resumes his journey, the guttering flame of Sam Winchester's soul glimmering ahead of him and Dean's helpless, agonized shout of his brother's name echoing in his mind.
Imp shuffles herself round to watch, not letting the dragon out of her sight, and Dean keeps her on a tight rein but lets her, then coaxes her around in a full circle so she can get over it. With the wind blowing at them, she won't catch the scent, and with nothing to see either she'll settle down soon enough.
Finally the lesson was over though, and Dean bolted out of the classroom and hightailed it to the Hospital Wing, where the other assistant opened the door and reluctantly allowed him in.
The hand he extends over Cas’s injuries glows, warm like lamplight after a long day, and Tsalia’s stillness is a different kind now, as tense and furiously hopeful as Dean, her claws rasping out and catching on the chair arm, over and over like the beat of their hearts.
“Alright,” she’d said, and unspoken had been everything she’d been kind enough not to mention. She’d pulled him down to press a kiss to the crown of his head the next morning, and whispered “You take care of yourselves,” just loud enough to hear, and he’d had to fight down a sudden upwelling of something too distant be be properly called grief that his mom had never had the chance to do this, and the much sharper sorrow that Jody will never get to say that to her own kid.
Finally Castiel is forced to accept that Dean will never respond, and ceases trying. Now that it’s so close to completion the importance of the mission is humming through  the angel’s grace, and Castiel’s attention turns to the body in its simple wooden coffin six feet below the ground. The first things to reconstruct are the internal organs, each restored to perfect working condition and linked back together into the systems that allow and sustain life. The cells and molecules that have eroded away in the mortal months Dean’s body has been empty of life are still present in the surrounding earth and it is merely a matter of reintegrating them, for which Castiel, already weary, is grateful.
Cas shrugs awkwardly, looking over at the daemon in question. "She knew I was...different." The bird-daemon rustles his feathers, settling deeper into his living pillow.
“I am not intending to allow either you or Sam to die in this war,” Cas says sharply, and Dee bites out a laugh.
All of which is to say: caveat lector, because Dean spends a good chunk of this being violently triggered back to his time in Hell and the sexual abuse he suffered there.
“Dean,” Cas says, low and final, and then Dean’s got wet, body-warm fabric plastered against his front and slick tiles at his back and yeah, okay, so he’s been half-hard since he heard Cas’s wings, Pavlovian and inevitable. It’s not like he’s never got off in the shower before. Sam can just deal with the wait.
“We shouldn’t be in here,” Cas answered from behind him, and Dean twisted round to find him chewing on his lower lip and glaring at him. “You’re not a prefect, and I’ve got work to catch up on.”
Sam bangs on the door. “Dean! Don’t use all the hot water man, some of us still have to shower, remember!”
“Yeah yeah, happy Santa day,” Dean says dismissively, eying the pear skeptically. Nothing grows in Bobby’s yard, probably because it’s scared it’ll get shot. When he goes to the window though, the tree is pretty hard to miss, growing as it is right smack in the centre of his line of sight and loaded down with fruit. In
There’s also the part where he is very, very naked and there is an honest-to-god white, frilly garter digging into his thigh.
"Yeah. Uh, it's a right out your drive, it took me maybe fifteen minutes to walk? It's green, a '15 Chevy hybrid."
The Winchesters find out because with Rufus visiting they offer to go find a motel or sleep on the couch or something cause Bobby's only got two spare rooms "and I don't know if you've noticed, but we're kinda too big now to bunk up together"
Dean headed for the first boat he saw, and got there at the same time as a blonde girl, who grinned at him and clambered in before he had the chance. “Guess we’ll find another one,” he muttered to Ash, but all the boats around them were already claimed and Hagrid was carefully folding his bulk into his own boat, making it roll alarmingly.
“He’s not gonna break, even from your giant sasquatch hand,” Dee says, her voice scratchy, but she’s smiling as she says it, wider than Sam’s seen for a long time. Her hair’s still mostly pulled back, but the usual crazy bits have escaped and are stuck to her cheeks and neck. Her colour’s high, eyes glittering, but she seems fine. “Bobby, the hell are you lurkin’ for? Get over here.”
"Oh, now none of that," Ollie says, waving a hand dismissively. "If you can't bring yourself to use less than the old names, then Olethros will suffice. What name do you go by, defiant one?"
Dean waves a dismissive hand. "Nah, 's fine. I was just gonna- I'd let you have the barn, but the horses..."
"Nice of you to join us," Dean snarks, and Cas ignores him, glancing round the room like a caged bird. He maybe looks even more windswept than usual, but it's pretty hard to tell with Cas.
Definitely ex-military - and maybe Cas was something too, since there’s definitely history there. Dean smiles at her though, a little tireder and shadowed that before but taking some of the bleakness out of his words, and she smiles back. Her Aunt Ellie was out in the Middle East until '11 when she lost half her leg, and she gets that it's a thing that has to be talked about, but at the same time can't be dwelt on or treated too carefully or it becomes a black hole you can't escape.
The trees around him sway in the breeze. Crickets chirp and unseen birds call. Tsalia pricks up her ears.
- in which dean and cas move out, because bobby loves them but now they're no longer under imminent threat of doom and emmy's older, they should gtfo and find their own house and their own bed to have sex in. sam moves out too, but he goes to law school and rents a place down there.
Dean stares at him, taking in the shadows under his eyes, the tightness of his mouth and the craziness of his hair, which looks like he's been running his hands through it a lot, helpless and frustrated. He can only imagine what that means for the angel under the skin, wound tight with worry and fear but putting up a strong front for the troops, having to shine bright and fearless when he's actually flickering with doubts. Clearly Cas needs a goddamn break, a little reminder that there are good things in the world too, that life can be awesome.
Sam makes a complicated face and flicks his head at the window. “The tree. And happy Christmas to you too.”
. I-” Dean scrubs a hand though his hair, helpless and furious with it. His voice drops to an angry whisper. “It’s just, he’s
"That is intensely aggravating," Cas says from right in front of him, flat and clipped, and Dean does
dean snorts. "yeah, i know, you're just a fucking hammer. so, great, no more angels divebombing us and the big man's back upstairs, good to know. you can go on back to daddy now."
One hand lifts and Sam catches it, folds their fingers together. Tsalia finally reaches them, collapsing at their feet with a rattling sigh, and a tiny bit of the tension goes out of Dean’s frame.
a couple of months in they talk about maybe leaving, but aside from the difficulty of warding the impala, sam reminds them about the demon in the semi and it doesn't get brought up again. bobby and one of the boys start going round warding the whole property, hoping to stop the angels getting so close. they found the sword that killed balthazar to add to the other two, and all three of them carry them everywhere. the only good thing is that emmy clearly can't get possessed, being an angel and all. crowley assures them that angel swords will work excellently on demons too, being forged in heaven with holy fire.
of such creatures. Bigger than houses, he's heard some dragons are; which means their teeth and claws...
(It makes a terrible sucking noise as it comes free, resists, grates against Cas’s ribs, and Dean apologises to him silently and darts a glance at the bird-daemon, still there, a splash of white feathers on the dark floor.)
“Then He should get His holy fucking ass down here!” Dean explodes. “It’s His fucking law they’re breaking, they’re His kids, He should sort it out!”
Dee doesn’t realise she’s made the decision until the Impala’s purring down a dark road, flanked by trees either side and lit only by her headlights. Cas in the passenger seat is just so damn
"Dean." Dean makes a noise that's caught between a sob and a laugh. Cas looks silently at him for a moment, then reaches out and gets a hand round the back of his neck, tugs his head down so he can press his lips to Dean's forehead. "
“Look, Cas,” Dean says, because Cas is looking like Dean kicked his puppy and then ran over it several times just to be sure. “This is all really...uh, nice, but you could’ve just got me some mistletoe and had done with it.”
His eyes flick over her, assessing, and then he kind of...relaxes and smiles at her, eyes crinkling. And okay, so he's maybe not gonna make her drop and give him twenty or handcuff her to the radiator or something after all. The smile becomes a concerned frown, and he looks past her at the first guy. "Cas, the poor kid's shaking. Get her a blanket, jeez. What's your name, sweetheart?"
one day after their NEWTS, dean, who’s been lying in the sun with the rest of his class and throwing his chicken bones for the squid, sees movement over the quidditch pitch/forest/grounds. he’d know cas anywhere, especially destressing after his exams, so he goes in/over and just watches, leaning against the rail that blocks off the seats/a tree. he knows cas has seen him, but it takes him another ten minutes or so to come down. the conversation is stilted, awkward like they haven’t been since fourth year, and then as dean turns to go cas grabs his arm, says “dean” and kisses him, clumsy and rushed and electric.
Someone taps on his window, and he blinks Sheriff Mills into focus, the band around his lungs easing a little.
[Jen, sitting in her chair while not needed on set and drinking coffee. She looks terrible, eye bruised and cheek red and blood down her chin. When she grins at the camera, her teeth are crimson.]
“Winchester, Dean,” squeaked Professor Flitwick, and Dean made his legs work and walked forward, picking up the hat and putting it on and sitting down on the hard stool.
and Muriel turning up all 'I've got this friggin'...bison with three legs, you got room for one more?'"
"Son of a bitch, he did it," Dean says, low and wondering, as they hesitantly lower their arms and blink away the spots, and Sam glances over at him, confused.
"she is...unique," joshua says slowly. "castiel no doubt meant to simply rehouse his remoulded grace in a new vessel and leave the child in your care to learn free will as he did, but in making a new life he also created a new human soul, as in all acts of creation. when he added the grace, which had rebuilt itself anchored by dean's soul and had so recently been ripped from that support, it sought this new soul instead."
Crowley raises his eyebrows. "What do you want me to do about it? Possess a brain surgeon and have a good old root around in there? It wouldn't do any good."
"what?" jen asks, matching her expression, then, louder, "there! you got it! can we have lunch now?!"
Tsalia is sitting bolt upright, tail twitching. Jac huffs something that might be a laugh, warm and fond.
"Hey, it's alright Adelaide. We don't bite, and neither do they," and he gestures to the dogs. "We do, however, fix cars." There's that smile again, his eyes flicking behind her, and there are footsteps that prompt her to turn just in time to take a neatly-folded knitted blanket from the other guy, 'Cas'. Unfolded, it's got Stitch on it and a bright Hawaiian backdrop, and when she burrito's herself into it it's soft and warm, if faintly scented with dog.
This isn’t the first time either - ever since Sam came back from Hell, he and Iope hadn’t been quite...right, and pretty much as soon as Dean had agreed to start hunting with them again they’d given up the pretense and stopped even trying to pretend they wanted to be anywhere near each other. All Cas had been able to tell them was that some part of Sam - his soul, or the other half of whatever mystical energy had manifested itself as Iope, or whatever - was no longer there, and as such Sam didn’t give two craps about anyone or anything; not Samuel, not Dean, and not even his own daemon. She, in turn, said he just wasn’t
Dean knows Iope blames herself for not trying hard enough, for getting angry at him, for not fighting harder to get back to Sam when he had kicked her away towards Dean and thrown himself and Lucifer into the Cage, which is bull-fucking-shit - Sam is the one with the problem, not her. Dean hates even the memory of that day; kneeling on the ground with his ears ringing and bruises throbbing and the smell of warm grass while Iope screamed and sobbed and choked in front of him, yelling Sam’s name until her throat was raw, tearing at the ground in a frenzy like she could dig right down to Hell and be with him again. Cas, when he showed up, had crouched down looking surprisingly wretched and told her that she wouldn’t find Sam that way, hands hovering like he wasn’t sure if he should touch her or not, and she’d flung herself at him and got in several nasty scratches to his face and neck and a real shiner of a black eye before he’d lifted her away again.
"Are there?" Cas murmurs, mouth quirking wickedly, and Dean can only swallow hard, the rest of his objections crushed under the onslaught of images of how the next few hours are gonna go.
cas is just a baby, playing with gabriel and anna and his flying horse balthazar on earth's beach when a bunch of high-level demons ambush them and somehow poison cas to remove all but one tiny sliver of his grace, then leave him on earth. his freaky healing abilities disturb the other kids and allow him to get beaten up with no evidence, but one day, when he dawdles home and passes the church, he goes inside to ask why he can't just be normal. gabriel is the one who answers the prayer and tells him what he is and reintroduces him to balthazar and tells him that due to the circumstances the only way he can restore his grace is to become a 'true hero'. he is sent to bobby singer, who is grumpy and disillusioned and reluctant until cas mentions his name. after a year or so of training, bobby declares him ready, and they're heading vaguely for detroit when they see a struggle below. that would be the winchester's fighting a minotaur, and though cas is laughed off when he offers to help, he is the one that eventually kills it. balthazar takes an instant dislike to dean and an instant like to dean's horse imp. when they get to detroit, there's two kids trapped in a rockfall, and while sam and dean get them out and to safety, cas has to face the hydra. neither winchester is happy about that, but bobby tells them the kid needs experience and they can step in if he dies; then it looks like he does and they charge in, and then cas heals and the three of them manage to kill it together. they become famous, and sam starts dating this chick ruby, who dean mutters mutinously is just a fame whore; dean and cas end up hanging out together a lot as a result, and neither of them really minds. sam skips out on some stuff one day, and in a fit of rebellion dean gets cas to follow his example. when a furious bobby finally finds them he starts yelling about inter-office relationships and idjits and hauls cas away to do everything he missed (the horses can only take two at a time and balthazar flat-out refused to go after cas) and when he comes back dean is talking to alastair about paying off his debt and sam's soul and giving alastair cas. bobby waits for him to leave then pretends he didn't see and takes dean back, then goes to tell cas. cas doesn't believe him and thinks he's trying to break them up, so bobby throws his hands up and says he washes his hands of all these idjits and storms out. that is, of course, when alastair appears and reveals it's all true, that sam got hurt on a hunt and died and dean made a deal to save him, which was to bring alastair cas. cas offers himself up and has that last shard of grace removed in exchange for dean's safety. alastair and his demons and the leviathans stage a takeover of heaven, while cas is chained up and guarded by hellhounds. dean went to sam and told him everything and sam realised ruby had just been keeping him occupied, and they take a horse each, dean going after cas on balthazar and sam after bobby on imp. dean finds cas and talks him into fighting, with him and balthazar helping, but both of them get hurt and dean especially badly, stomach ripped open. sam and bobby arrive just in time to watch dean die, and cas gets that bit of grace back. it allows him entry to heaven without being dead, so he helps lead the resistance until alastiar yells at him that's he's got a swell consolation prize and smokes out. cas goes plunging through the hellgate and into hell to retrieve dean's soul, and finally proves himself a true hero, emerging from the pit shining bright and cradling dean's soul in his arms. he still has a hand free to punch alastair in the face though (or possibly sam's there and does it), and then to cast him down to the mercy of the souls he tortured. then he restores dean to life and gets lifted to heaven, where he chooses to remain on earth. and then everyone lives happily ever after.
Sam laughs, tired and maybe a little hysterical. “Well that’s the age-old question, isn’t it? What do you do once you’ve saved the world?”
dean is a homicide detective, like his mother, because these people need to be brought in before they cause any more destruction. cas and his name and his glasses and his smoker's voice and his precise fingers and his easy slip into enochian and his braaains intrigue him, so when he finds a post-it covered in familiar symbols stuck to his case paperwork that translates to, essentailly, "call me" once it's all over, he keeps it.
“Not that much, as I believe public fornication is frowned up,” Cas points out, and Dean rolls her eyes.
"Emmanuel," Iope says, jumping over onto Sam's couch and scuttling right up to the arm closest to Cas's chair. "Yeah, I like it. Suits you."
Dean manages to wrestle his shoulders free too, then wraps his arms around Tsalia’s neck and lets her pull him the rest of the way out, tugging her down and burying his face in her chest, murmuring “Tsalia” and “thought I’d never-” and “don’t you ever fuckin’ leave me again” into her fur while she wraps her limbs around him and revels in the life in him. Eventually they sit up and Dean cradles her head in his hands and looks her over, running gentle hands over the scar crossing her eye, the notches in her ears, the other scars hidden under her coat.
Pretty much as soon as he’d been old enough to understand what Dad did when he went away and why, he’d realised there was nothing stopping the same thing from happening to him too, and Tsalia had spent the nights as another wolfhound, curled up tight to him and licking away his tears. Each time time John left them, Tsalia stayed a wolfhound until he came back, then pretended she’d been a cat or a hawk or a dragon, Dean too embarrassed to admit that he had worried for his father and already knowing that John wanted to see him as the strong one, the one he could trust with Sammy’s care.
when he blinks back colour, he finds himself face down on the floor of the panic room, everything eerily silent. he shoves himself up, still seeing spots but fuck it,
They might be crazy serial killers, but at this point as long as their house is warm they can skin her as much as they like.
cas wonders out into the main room, wrapped in a towel but with something off- and then she says “dean, what’s the currently accepted method of dealing with menstruation?” and dean makes a noise like a squashed duck and chokes on his pancake. he hurries off to find their first aid kit and the bandages, and sam tries not to stare at the smears peeking out from the bottom of the towel, at the unabashed blatantness of it all, and tells himself there’s really not a sour-sharp metallic scent to the air, it’s all in his head. cas’s legs are pale now she’s in her own body and doesn’t expose them much, and the crimson stands out, and ruby used to make those ridiculous smug purring noises when he licked the blood from the warm rounded softness of her inner thigh...
“I can’t do this without you,” Sam whispers into the dark and bloody space between them, an agreement and a plea.
Dean leaves his hands hovering for a moment more, both savouring the moment and struck once again by the vague idea that there's actually some kind of taboo he's about to break, then gives in and buries his fingers in the feathers, raking his hands backwards to comb through them and then doing it again palm-up. The underfeathers are pure white, but the top ones have a greyish tinge, like they're covered in dust, and Dean sometimes wonders if that's a sign of what Cas's been through - retrieving him from Hell, becoming human, killing his brothers - and then if maybe the wings are therefore kind of his fault, since y'know, Cas wouldn't have done any of that without knowing him.
"yeah? and how're you gonna do that?" dean sneers, glancing theatrically round the warehouse, and cas smiles that creepy smile of his.
Emmanuel guides them into one of the records rooms and Cas slams the door behind them, settling Dean gently up against the nearest shelf. Emmanuel darts around the perimeter and Cas follows him with his eyes, shoulders tightening. They’re trapped in here and they all know it, but where else could they go?
Cas’s fingers, still slightly sticky, settle on the inside of Dean’s thigh, right above his knee.  His skin’s still sensitive, nerves sparking feebly at the touch, and he laughs and blinks away from staring at the ceiling, pillow rustling under his head.
“Yes, perhaps they will,” Dean agrees, not even entirely sure what he’s agreeing with, and hastily removes himself upstairs.
He opens the door, and it’s like Narnia or some shit, a whole ‘nother world that hits him like a physical blow, the sudden blast of sound like turning on a radio with the volume all the way up. The drummers and pipers are back, kind of playing together, and the noise is making all the animals go nuts; couples are doing some kind of swing dance in the free space where the animals aren’t, and right smack in the middle is the familiar trenchcoat, Gabriel beaming behind him with his arms spread wide.
Curiosity overcoming him, Dean swings out of bed and goes to the window, and finds that Conesta has somehow dragged herself up from the field to the house, bandages trailing behind her and trampled hopelessly into the mud, and is currently burrowing her head into Castiel’s chest like any dog with a returned master. Dean has for years known how to open the window without it making noise - the better not to alert his parents to his nighttime excursions to the village - and he cracks it open now in time to hear Castiel soothing her like a frightened child.
“You will do what, Dean Winchester?” not-Mrs-Graham says flatly, zapping over next to Emmy, and Dean twists desperately against the angel holding him, until his vision starts to go bright around the edges and he gags from the pain. The angels watch dispassionately, looking faintly disgusted.
“She’s a keeper, Sammy,” Dean stage whispers, winking at her, and Sam rolls his eyes and steers her away from Bobby and towards the grill and the man standing behind it.
“He’s trying to make the world better,” Tsalia bites out, ears flattened and teeth flashing with every word.
Sam stops flailing and closes his hand around thin air, evidently prying the thing off, and holds it gingerly several feet away from him. The squeaky growling, which had gone silent, starts up again.
“It’s already forgotten,” St Claire assures him seriously, looking up to make sure he catches Dean’s eyes. “You are hardly the first person I’ve met to have made such assumptions, though you have been one of the fastest to apologise for them.” He smiles slightly. “And call me Castiel, we are neither of us standing on ceremony.”
Castiel would never allow that to happen though. None of the angels would allow that to happen. God might even come out of hiding to prevent it. It would never be allowed to come to pass. He raises his head.
“Okay,” Bobby says flatly, smacking both hands down on the table. “I was fine with the tree, cause I figure a little fresh fruit never hurt anybody, not to mention you can make pear cider and the wood’s good for carvin’, but I did not sign up for a complete remodel. I got a business to run here, and while one little fruit tree makes it look all homely or whatever psychology shit, this ain’t a botanical garden.”
He stops anticipating the touch, stops shivering away from it, and in response it becomes gradually longer, more certain, until Cas is following a careful, unbroken line, up and down the cleft of his ass, fingertip slip-sliding easy in the trail of lube.
“So, no white light or bleeding eardrums?” Sam asks, stroking a finger down the baby’s arm and over the back of his tiny curled hand.
charlie finds them a case in a gay bar, where an incubus/succubus has been snacking on the clientele. she despairs over their attire and amuses herself listening to them (well, dean) arrange 'protection' for each other. she also introduces them to the barman, donally (who's also part-owner with his husband, oliver), who's genial and blue-eyed and shameless and would be played by john barrowman
Everyone clapped and whooped, and then she sat down and suddenly the tables were full, every available space covered in food and even the
dean manages to kick in a locked door in one blow. “hey, what can i say, eat your veggies sammy and one day you too could...grow up...more...to be this awesome. spinach, man, it’s all in the spinach.”
, Cas," he hisses, digging both heels into the bed for better purchase to shove up into Cas's hand, and Cas makes a vaguely disapproving rumble low in his throat. "Sorry, fuck, don't you dare stop, this is all your fault anyway, magic - nuhhh - mojo whatever, fuckin'-"
“Yeah,” Sam says. Everything’s spinning again, so he closes his eyes on the darkness and the blazing trails of dying angels. His mouth feels like it’s detached from his body, like he’s hearing stuff and replying to it later. “She’s only about 32 weeks. It’s not- she hasn’t been tested for anything, she hasn’t had any check-ups.”
Time runs different in Heaven, so at some point there is a later; months or decades, hours or years, moments or lifetimes.
"Then it's even more pathetic that you haven’t even got the balls to tell him to-" and the rest of the sentence is lost a coughed-out gasp as his back hits the wall.
.” Sheriff Mills is shaking him, voice low and commanding. The forensics guys are looking at him funny, obviously wandering why he’s there. “Come on.”
“My parents married long before Bonaparte came to power,” St Claire says sharply. “I am as English as you. I was born here, this is my home. Now, if you will kindly provide me with writing materials I will inform the covert of our situation and we will shortly cease to trespass on your hospitality any longer.”
Cas had put a hand on his arm, eyes compassionate. “No Dean, you know I can’t, and Sam didn’t want either of us to try.”
“You, uh- you gonna introduce us?” Dean asks once they’re alone, gesturing awkwardly at the new daemon, and Cas stops doing impossibly bendy things with his limbs and blinks at him.
"Which is why I won't linger, now that these two are here. Just a friendly warning, boys - the rest of my family take their roles very seriously, and you aren't necessarily their favourite people right now. And if you are, you probably don't want to be." He takes a step back and tips Bobby a salute. "I enjoyed working for you, Bobby Singer. And your cooking is truly delicious." He turns to Cas. "Have a care, Castiel. You cannot keep my brothers and sisters from what they seek, and you would be unwise to try."
The other him has Cas by the hair, all gentleness gone and knuckles white as he fucks his mouth, head tipped against his supporting arm. He’s got Cas up at an angle that must be uncomfortable, but Cas doesn’t seem to care, is watching him with the same sly satisfaction he displayed when he goaded Dean into kissing him. His hands are still restless, but they stick to Dean’s lower back and thighs now, smooth strokes at odds with the increasingly fast, hard thrusts of Dean’s hips.
“Promise me than once you have caught him you’ll come home and sleep for a week,” Cas says finally, halfway through unbuttoning Dean’s overshirt, and Dean hums an affirmative.
Cas’s head is lolling like a puppet’s, and every breath he takes sounds like a struggle and chokes off into a gasp. “It’s okay Cas, we’ve got you,” Dean tells him, yanking at the sword impaling his foot, but all that does is make Cas wheeze harder, almost a whimper, and in the end it’s Emmy who gets them out, lifted up on Dean’s shoulders to get the ones in his hands too.
Iope finds them like that, later. She skitters off to call to Sam and then comes back, little hands flexing, unsure. The tears stopped some time ago and now Dean’s just staring blankly ahead, he and Tsalia breathing in sync. She’s curled around him like a huge house cat, her head on his shoulder, one big paw on his chest.
Her eyes are suspiciously bright, but then so are Bobby’s. Sam huffs a soft laugh. “Hey, no chick-flick moments.”
they get engaged two years later, cas technically proposing first by mentioning [some ancient marriage ritual] and then repeating it against dean's skin in the dark, but dean's the one that makes the rings becasue he's a sap like that and does it while cas is away. also done while cas is away is the tattoo of said ancient marriage ritual across his hip, copied exactly from where cas wrote it in his valentines card/last note before he left. the wedding isn't legal but seven years later it becomes so; it's held in cas's local church, which gives no fucks and believes marriage is a promise made betwen two people before god, and the reception is in balthazar's back garden because there are good memories there. they send  several pictures to cas's parents: one of cas and his family, one of dean and his, one of everyone, formal and posed, and another of them laughing and throwing confetti, one of the cake-cutting, one of them outside the church beaming (cas wears a dark (pinstriped?) three-piece suit and a blue cravat and dean almost feels bad for having such inappropriate thoughts in a church; dean wears a light grey suit and an off-white shirt open at the collar, because fuck ties this isn't even legal, though his pocket square matches cas's cravat), and one of them at the reception, dean in a ridiculous headband with attached veil gabe had snuck onto his head and being dipped by cas, caught so his flailing hands actually look like they're fisted lovingly in cas's waistcoat. (they don't have a photographer, just several friends with cameras)
rachael still finds out about the deal, but this time it's not as serious because cas isn't after the souls, it's just the demon factor, and she takes him up to heaven to face his peers - they don't tell raphael, that would be stupid, but that's why he almost wasn't there to get the boys back, and he gets dragged back soon after, but that's their first inkling something's wrong. prayers to cas redirect to rachael, who tells them he's currently on trial but won't tell them why. balthazar doesn't know either, though he promises to snoop. they know cas and crowley got sam back, but that can't be it - balthazar does his whole "are you in flagrante with the king of hell" thing, and cas admits to the deal. this time though, balthazar being on his 'side' means busting him out of heaven's prision or whatever (raphael's found out by now and it's not good). balthazar does get him out, though that’s how he dies this time, and Cas almost dies too. there's no holy oil trap, just dean and cas having a serious conversation when cas wakes up. "it was all for you" is still there, though cas means it because it was all to get sam out to make dean happy. "did you kiss him?!" etc is still in, because dean. the late-night conversation might also still be there, and there might be sort-of declarations of feelings.
Dean opens his mouth, trying desperately to think of a way to explain this away, when Cas says, low and dangerous, "Get away from them."
Cas doesn’t answer, still staring at the spaniel, face pale. Dean can sympathise - Cas is still new to this whole feeling-pain thing, and then Jimmy’s daemon has to go and
“When I went to pick Emmy up from kindergarten today, she wasn’t there,” Dean says finally, pacing the perimeter a hair’s breadth away from the fire. “What
He falls into some kind of stupor, mind replaying over and over again all the things the angels could be doing to Emmy, to Cas. Both of them are still susceptible to holy oil, and to angel swords, but beyond that there’s just the sheer
[Jen climbs back up from her knees, smiling, and pushes playfully at Misha as she passes her. Misha hip-checks her back and Jen half-bulldozes her into the wall in return, both of them laughing.]
It was actually originally just going to be D/C, but then literally I wrote that bit with Dean hearing Sam giving Cas a quick massage and Sam knowing exactly what it did to Dean, and then I sat back and said to myself "Self, that sounds awfully Wincest-y I can't believe you just accidentally wrote that...but like, since you
“Stop talking and breathe.” But her fingers clench around his, rubbing absently over her bump like he’s seen her do sometimes when she’s been thinking about Cas and Naomi and all the weirdness that’s been going on up in Heaven this year. The baby kicks under the touch, hard enough that even Sam feels it, and Dee hisses. “No squirt, it’s fine, sssh. We’re fine.”
Dean follows her to the break room, where the TV’s up loud and full of smoking debris, metal and grass, and everyone else in the room kind of twitches towards him as he comes in, faces blank.
They don’t have anything designed for dragons, and the cows and sheep so rarely need doctoring beyond the superficial, so the best Dean can do is bring everything they have and hope that combined it will be enough. If not, he supposes they could always sacrifice a horse blanket or two.
From all this she’d kind of assumed he’d be a slightly coarser version of Sam, in ripped jeans and a well-loved t-shirt with hair maybe long enough to tie up and a battered old tape player never far away, bandana in his back pocket and a twinkle in his eye.
, seriously, what the fuck, he shouldn’t be seeing this, it’s their moment not his and that’s not even
"I can't prove it was him," Cas said finally, almost lost under the roar of the water filling the  pool, and Dean squeezed his fingers to show he'd heard. "I wish he'd just...get over it. This isn't a damn competition, and I'm not a, a
“Thank you, Dean,” St Claire says quietly, and Dean sets the rest of the bandages back on the table and steps back to allow him the space to re-dress.
time passes. dean starts feeling kind of beat up, drained, and bobby tells sam that sounds like how he felt when cas soul-sucked him. they're maybe running out of time. dean, feeling particularly crappy but unable to sleep, curses cas out in a whisper and gets graced with his presence.
Joshua looks him straight in the eye. “I cannot tell you while you insist on keeping me trapped like an animal in a cage.”
Dean glances down at his hand, already knowing it isn't there, lost in the slippery gush of blood when the thing caught him on the arm, and shrugs. "Dunno."
“Jesus was baptized fully clothed,” Cas says absently, already crowding in closer with a squeak of shoes on the bathtub floor, and Dean darts a glance at the closed door through the shower curtain then gives it up as lost cause. It’s not like arguing with Cas usually gets him very far anyway.
“Iope, c’mon, we gotta go,” he says, holding a hand out for her and already turning, and she bounds over and grabs it, her momentum swinging her up to his shoulder as surely as the upward pull of his arm, and he’s off and running, broken glass crackling under his feet and shoes slip-sliding in the black smears. Iope coils her tail around his throat and directs him back the way they came, almost strangling him when they take a couple of wrong turns, and then the exit door bursts open and they’re out, and the car’s surrounded by broken glass but intact and not too far away.
when emmy is about 26, cas is killed in a freak hunting accident, and whatever passes for his soul is either in hell or purgatory. naturally, his daughter is really not into either of those ideas. mostly she’s kicking ass and trying to rescue him (which might involve giving him back some of his grace), but she also meets demon!bela and also maybe crowley.
He goes slithering down the wall, after, and Cas regards him with a certain amount of smugness, still kneeling all innocently in front him. “Guess you holy mojo’d the water, huh?”
“We were pursued,” St Claire answers cagily, unbuttoning his shirt down to his breastbone. He shrugs out of the torn sleeve, hissing, and peels the scarlet-stained material away, baring his shoulder and upper arm and the dark crimson gash bisecting both. “Oh, it's not as bad as I feared.” He gropes for the cloth Dean put in the water, wrings it out one-handed and begins cleaning the dried blood from his skin. “We managed to evade the Chanson-de-Guerre, but the two Honneur-d’Or’s caught us off the coast.”

“If they did get zapped back to Purgatory with Dick...well, it’s a kind of Hell,” Iope says quietly, after about the tenth unanswered prayer. “It probably will take them...a while to get out.”
him like he’s some waif of a chick. Dean almost pulls away to boggle at him, but then Cas’s dick is nudging at him, slick and hot, and he’s sliding back inside, and Dean has to concentrate on not moaning like a porn star as all his nerves light up like Christmas.
Emmanuel flutters ahead and Tsalia follows behind, bulling herself into Dean’s legs to keep him moving every time he falters, ears flat and teeth bared. Billie is following, relentless, and Tsalia snarls at her approaching shadow on the wall as they round another corner.
there would have been dean getting increasingly comfortable with cat!Cas, and telling him "y'know, i kinda like you like this - you're a lot more expressive, and it's way easier to figure out what the fuck you're thinking about", probably while cas is sprawled over his chest purring and being stroked. balthazar would have turned up and changed him back, eventually - though not before suggesting a kiss, just to see if dean'll do it. he does.
cas turns up in the middle of the night, and presses something small and glowing into dean's chest, eyes and mouth shining weirdly - dean thinks it's a dream, a mix of death resouling sam, cas having saved him from hell and cas going nuts.
Not for the first time Sam regrets that Dean insists on driving such a recognizable model, but he doesn’t even want to think about Dean’s face when (
all the dangerous jobs to piss you off. And hey, we managed to get yourselves out of the whole vampire situation
If you didn’t know him, Sam thinks, you’d think he didn’t care, but it’s obvious that he’s just still kind of in shock at the whole experience - Sam doubts childbirth still looks like a miracle from the business end of things and with Dee cussing a blue streak at you the whole time - and having to once again deal with his whole world shifting sideways. There’s still something faintly stunned about his expression, but his eyes are bright.
Cas flicks a dismissive ear, turning back to the TV. A beat later though, he does fold experimentally down on himself, tucking his front legs under his chest and looking like a rather boney cushion. The look he shoots Dean is definitely smug.
“Thank you, so much,” the aviator tells him as they watch her curl her head round onto her foreleg and close her eyes.
“Oh shit,” Dee says, breathless, the hand not on Sam’s shoulder dropping to her stomach, though for protection or reassurance Sam doesn’t know. And again, more desperate this time, really meaning it, “
