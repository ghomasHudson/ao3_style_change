at the same time as he praises his brother for always making sure the room only has two beds.
Their foreheads rested against each other, Cas’s hand cupping Dean's face, gently stroking those beautiful freckles.
“Hm? Yeah. Yeah, sure.” Still distracted, Cas picks up a book and pretends to show interest in what story the pages are telling.
Slamming shut his book in frustration and anger Dean gives a heavy sigh as he leans back in his chair, his eyes wandering over the shelves on the wall. This was going to take forever to figure out. But he would figure it out, even if it would take years. The thought makes him feel helpless and hopeless. How was Dean supposed to survive that long without him.
«I can’t sleep.» Cas´s whisper is soft against the darkness of the hallway, his bright eyes the only light Dean can see.
«You know I’m taller than you, right?»
The first day all alone in the bunker consisted of the same procedure as yesterday. Wake up. Breakfast. Research. Dinner. Research. Sleep.
«You’ll find me by the ´alter´» Dean smiles brightly down at him, the thought of actually marrying his love, still making him a little dizzy.
Learning each other, again. There was so much to learn, so much to learn differently. Kisses to learn. Bodies to learn. Feelings to learn. Slowly, they were figuring it out. Slowly they
“Life is good, Sam, it’s perfect.” He raises his cup of coffee as if toasting before bringing it to his lips, his free hand fiddling with his necklace which always stays hidden beneath his shirt. “It’s a beautiful morning.”
“Four days? Really? I didn’t know four days could feel that long.”
Sam stands there crying, the only thing holding up his big brother. His hero. He stopped breathing several minutes ago. The last tear dried up, on its way down his beautiful face. His green eyes never to see the sun again. His brother. Dean. Gone.
He should have taken the road he hadn’t dared to take. A road that would have led him to warmth and love that he had only ever dared to wish for.
Sam had spent most of his life on the road. Usually just him and Dean. They’ve been through so much together, the two of them. On the road, always on the road. Highway after highway. Coming from nowhere, not going anywhere.
Thank you so much to everyone who has read / commented / left kudoss so far, I really appreciate it! :)
Frozen, laying beneath Dean, Cas stares at him, not able to move. He can feel Deans short breaths on his lips. All he has to do is lift his head slightly, and Cas would finally get to know what those lips feel like on his own. Instead, Cas closes his eyes.
They speak a single word at the same time, breaking the deafening silence.
«I don't know how I do that, but I'll stop it if you stop coming to me as him.»
“I don’t want anything to change betwe...” he doesn’t get to finish as Dean interrupts him, finally finding the courage to speak.
He didn’t care about anything else. Not his brother coming to the top of the stairs. Not Jack standing down by the war table wondering what was happening. Nothing mattered.
Trapped in darkness.
But, they were still careful around the others. They acted the way they always had, but now Dean could see what the others probably had seen all along. The feelings. Dean was very protective about him and Cas, at least now that this thing was so fresh. He also found it unnatural to show such emotions in front of his people, his family. Dean had always hidden his feelings, to appear tough and strong, and that still lingered with him. He shouldn’t show emotion, shouldn’t make himself vulnerable in front of others. But with this, he felt even more protective, not daring to be too vulnerable with them. With this thing between them. Dean had lost so much in his life, but this, this he could not lose. Not this, not
«When are you guys leaving?» Dean asks, not wanting to talk about Cas or Jack.
«Did... something happen?»
Finally looking out over the room, Dean is filled with even more happiness and love, even though he didn’t think that was possible at the moment. It's the happiest moment of his existence. He laughs as his family keeps cheering, the room exploding in even more love as each moment passes.
That stupid, stupid angel.
Turning over on his side, he studies the angel for a long moment. Memorizing the peaceful expression of sleep. But not for too long. He’s not leaving this room until he’s said his words. Even if there is lasagna and pie at stake.
But now they had set it on fire.
Sometimes in Cas’s room.
And then almost inaudible he’d heard them whispering a sweet “I love you” to each other. So, Dean and Cas might not showcase their feelings the same way the other couples in the bunker did, but the way they showed their love through the simplest things, the smallest gestures, were just as beautiful, if not more.
«Yeah… Yeah, I'm ready.»
But then all rational thoughts disappeared.
«Yeah…»
There were several other pictures too, of Dean and Cas. Dean and Sam. Of Sam and Eileen. Sam and Cas. Cas and Jack. Dean and Jack. Cas, Dean, and Claire. Sam, Dean, and Bobby. Jack hadn’t counted how many decorated the long sideboard, or hung on the wall above it, but there were lots of happy memories from their life, showing that even though they had been hard, their lives had held love and happiness too.
«All mine.» He says into the kiss.
And then Cas opens the door, almost crashing into Dean as he’s about to walk through the door. Wide-eyed they look at each other, not saying a word for a long moment.
And then.
«Way too short! It's such a beautiful day today, but I didn’t wanna wear out my Baby on her first ride in weeks, although I know she would handle it perfectly.»
“NO!” Instantly, Dean drops to his knees, pulling the angel closer, resting his back against Deans thighs, supporting him and getting him away from the evil creature who is laughing at him with an amused look in his eyes. “Cas!”
He slowly manages to pull away from him, quietly standing from the bed, looking back at the still sleeping man in his bed.
Tomorrow they would drive back home, getting everything ready for the new hunters to move in. They’d sought out the once they knew, and through them, they had found some more. Together they made quite a gang. Six new hunters, six new residents in the Men of Letter bunker. Six new friends, and hopefully sometime in the future, family.
That all up to us. To take care of each other. To be there when needed. To be a home for each other. We live on the road, but the road don’t care. So we have to.»
Eileen was his home.
«Get out! Or I'll go get the others.» Staring at the two of them tangled up on the bed, she raises her eyebrows, waiting for him to get out of bed.
“Tik... tok...” Dean pretends to look at the time, raising his arm to show his watch. “Time’s running out on you, bitch.”
“What’s his deal? Grumpy cat much?”
«It’s so beautiful.»
The Shadow narrows his eyes, a sour look on his face.
“It’s okay Dean.”
But sometimes, he would wake in the middle of the night and feel a presence in the room. He never had to turn over to know that the angel was sitting in the chair in the corner, and Dean came to long for Cas to stay with him like that. He never dared imagine anything else though, as he knew it would hurt more than the moment of joy it would bring him. Dean knew nothing would ever happen between the two, as Cas was a cosmic being, and Dean wasn’t exactly a lovable person. But he would dream and wish for just the presence of his best friend. Having him beside him like that was better than nothing at all.
It's almost a little comical. The New God sitting in a bunker, comforting a broken man that once was the most faithless of them all. Dean was a fallen and broken man afraid of faith, who fell in love with a fallen angel driven by faith and fear of falling. They had both fallen into and from faith, both somehow healing each other as they fell together.
(See the end of the chapter for
He says his name right.
The sound of his heartbeats in the silence.
This is the third night in a row that Sam has had the same dream. The first night he woke when he and Dean arrived at the barn. The second night he woke when he and Dean had killed all the masked creatures. But this time it seemed that Sam woke after the dream had ended. That’s what scares him this time, so much that he runs down the hall to check on his brother. The bunker is too quiet.
“Me?”
Cas, left alone in the empty with no way out. There’s no way the empty would send him back, again.
soul.
“Dean, don’t. You don’t have anything to apologize for. I chose it, saving you. And I would have done it again if it meant you’d live. And I know you would’ve found a way to get to me.”
Finally answering his kiss.
It’s a beautiful night.
«I'll take them all, as long as you’re the one painting them on my face.» He knows he’s the one wearing that stupidly cute smile again. A smile that turns even more stupid and wide as Cas leans forward to place a light kiss on his nose. Kisses him lightly as he holds him close. Dean closes his eyes against the kisses as the angel's lips move across his face.
«So you manage to replace the… brake-thingy-part that made that weird sound?»
The red eyes of the Shadow glows even stronger now, and the figure of darkness starts to dissolve.
Dean made a little humming noise as he leads his head atop Cas’s continuing to watch the stars as they stood there in silence. A weak breeze picked up as they stood there, making Dean pulling his red and black plaid winter jacket tighter across his chest. He pulls Cas to him, his back resting against Dean's chest, his head on Cas’s shoulder. Quietly, they stand there, holding each other as they watch the stars shine above them.
, Cas declares.
For a moment, surprise appears on Sam's face, then the expression morphs into understanding. "Ah."
"What? Come on, the way you look..."
"My queen, may I ask what kind of creature it is we are talking about?", Castiel inserts before Dean can talk over him again.
He sees the pain in the boy's eyes when he turns back from the bed where Amy Pond lies. A part of him wishes he could take back what he just did. But of course he cannot, and instead he tells the boy to look him up in a few years, and leaves.
When they are standing on the sandy street, Mary lets out an exhale. When she speaks, her voice is not as steady as before. "Why does it take one so long to arrive at the truth sometimes?"
"Yay!", three voices exclaim in unison.
"Hmmm", the Doctor says."Not good. Not good at all."
She starts to speak in a foreign language.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good. -
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore -
"I can't die, but you..."
"Yes, you
"Shut up", Dean brings out. "And do it again, noble sir."
Dean steps closer, tears in his eyes. "For crying out loud, could you
I wanna hold your hand"
Then another voice appears, from a point close to Dean and Cas "
"You had no idea what you did to me when you dressed up as one, did you?"
I wanna hold your hand-
Castiel is smiling at him. "I do believe you heard me the first time."
Dean smirks, now close to the voice. "I see."
Dean's grip around the plate tightens. "Yes?"
At this, Cas laughs. "Indeed."
"So what do you do for a life?", Jack asks.
I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live. -
'Cause you still don't know what I never said...
emerges from the wall, charging at Billie and Cas.
Cas laughs. "No. Absolutely none."
, Dean agrees.
"Yeah. Well. Because you love bees. And it's sunflower honey, you know... I mean, uh..."
If there is a lesson here, it is this. Do not underestimate witches. Even if you happen to be a celestial being.
"I...", Dean stammers. "Yes, I did." Slowly, he regains his countenance, taking the situation in, looking at Castiel's face, at their hands and back. He swallows. "Cas, can I..."
And so, they spend the rest of the evening baking two miniature apple pies. Those also almost burn because they manage to distract themselves with a lot of kissing, but in the end all works out well.
"Maybe they just think I look funny."
After making out for several minutes, Cas decides to take up it a notch and pushes Dean into the direction of the bed, gently, but determined.
A quiet gasp escapes Mary, but she does not say anything because she senses that the angel is not finished with his speech.
"A lot of crap as well", Castiel completes the sentence.
Dean pulls him into a hug, looking over the crowd standing there to greet him. A wide smile flashes over his face when he recognizes someone else. Pulling out of the embrace, he approaches her to hug her as well. "Hey, kiddo", he greets her, pressing a kiss to her forehead. "I missed you."
"If you insist."
"Well,
"That he... was 'hitting on me', as you said", Castiel elaborates.
Because Castiel cannot cook, he instead helps Dean with the dishes afterwards. "Dean...", he starts.
"Right. Right. This is enough. Down, boy", Dean mutters. He turns around with a triumphant smile. "Sir Castiel! I tamed the dragon!"
"Well, the thought counts", the queen determines. "You shall have your reward anyway."
by dying. Frigging roller coaster."
"Of course, when you found me again, you were mostly preoccupied with Sam."
"Sorry, Dean. I know it's New Year's Eve, I know you are feeling lonely, but you just cannot show up, say you love me and expect that to make it all right. It does not work this way."
Hands raised, Dean enters the cave. Even if it is only a game, his heart is pounding a bit. Because either way, this is a challenge. "Hi there", he exclaims.
Dean chuckles. "All right." He waves at Eileen. "Eileen, could you take over the BBQ?"
"I don't know. Uh..." He swallows, trying to imagine what Sam would do when facing such a situation. "Uh... talking?"
I didn't have any clue what had pulled me out of Hell and why. I... I thought it was probably something evil, especially with what happened with Cassandra and with all the bursting windows. Way to make a first impression, buddy."
"No. Nothing at all. Everything is frigging peachy."
"Dean... Jack would have died otherwise."
"I am sorry."
"What?", John asks, looking at Dean in confusion. Castiel also turns to Dean with a raised eyebrow.
Dean can feel his own eyes rolling back and hear himself scoff.
She nods. "He did not care about me at all. I thought he did, but..."
"Dangerous creatures!", Dean exclaims. "Our specialty." Instead of letting Castiel speak, he declares "We would be happy to solve this problem for you, Your Majesty."
Castiel laughs. "So that's what you were worried about." He shakes his head, smile on his face.
He sighs, stops. "What, Cas?"
„Come on. Don‘t tell me Metatron didn‘t cram this movie into your head.“
"Yes. Lead the way, Jack."
Cas laughs. "I see you and Charlie have been having a good time."
Another woman chimes in. "Time And Relative Dimensions In Space", she explains. After a small pause, she adds. "And I'm Yaz, by the way. Hi."
Dean laughs in delight. "Of course you did. That's awesome."
"Likewise, buddy." Charlie,
Pretty soon, Dean is sent hurling over the edge, shouting out Cas' name.
"Shh", she says with a smile, not taking her eyes off Castiel and Dean. "I call this tradition 'helping out friends'."
Sam blinks in surprise. "What? It's not like Dean
"I'm leaving too", Mary throws in, already standing up. Her voice does not reveal much emotion when she adds "I think I'll go over to Bobby's for a bit."
She nods. "I will. Just come over if you would like to talk with me. ... I have the feeling you boys have a lot to talk about."
"Okay", Cas says.
I wish you would...
"Me?", Dean sputters. "I'm okay. Why... why wouldn't I be?"
He feels a hand on his shoulder. "It is fine, Dean."
"Yes?"
A voice interrupts him. "Cas? Is that really you?"
"I, uh, I... I never told you that, but..." He can feel heat rising in his cheeks. But now that he
I can't hide"
The figure steps closer to him, giving him a death glare. "
"John...", Mary begins, but John does not let her speak.
And Cas is smiling at him.
Dean turns around, confused for a moment, since the voice is the same one as Cas'. He swallows, staring at the Shadow. "I sort of hitched a ride", he replies, managing a small chuckle.
"What... What sort of pain?"
Dean laughs out, but there is a layer of pain to it. "Yeah. Well. Look, this crazy-ass angel here... Picture it. Death at our heels, crushing my heart, we're literally facing Death, and he..." He brings out another tortured laugh. "He... He makes an elaborate speech. A full-blown love confession. Man, I..."
"This looks good", the Doctor assesses. "Now we have to wait until the TARDIS is full charged up, and then we can close the rift." She turns towards the others. "Feel free to make small talk in the while. Or. Or big talk. This is also always good."
"Yeah. Just... Blow off some steam, get drunk, have some fun."
And please, say to me-
", she nods. "The TARDIS homed in on you. It sensed we would need your help. You are the only one who can step outside the TARDIS and into the rift without being instantly vaporised. You're a celestial being. You need to go out there and unstick the ship, and then the rift will close."
Dean is looking at him with a grin. "So...", he begins, "what do you want to do tomorrow? ... Because, you know, we can do
"Now", Amara says "There's an easy solution to make sure Castiel will not bother you again."
"Do you think he can hear us?", Sam asks, wiping over Dean's forehead and cheeks with a wet cloth.
The queen inhales. "No. But there is a tradition, you see." Her eyes are resting on Dean, gauging his reaction. "Whenever someone noble tries to protect this realm, he shall have a kiss. Since I do not have offspring in the form of a princette, the next closest thing would be my fair handmaiden."
And then, without further warning, the world blinks out.
"Of course you do, but... not that way. I mean, angels aren't supposed to..."
"Hey, guys", Sam greets them the the next morning, sitting down beside Cas and smirking at Dean, who is sitting opposite them. "So... I see you got lucky as well", he says. It is not a question.
"... wrong approach."
"How..."
"Ah." Recognizing him, the creature flashes him a grin. "Dean Winchester. ... You know, you don't seem
This mad mad love makes you come running -
The Captain shrugs his shoulders. "She's a bit chaotic at times."
The Empty looks at Amara, who, in turn, snaps her fingers as well. The Shadow smiles. "Thank you." It changes into a shape of black goo which disappears through the tear with a gurgling sound, closing the portal behind itself.
""I, uh, I… annoyed an ancient cosmic being so much that he sent me back."
, he thinks, and sits down again, smiling at both of them.
He hesitates, but not for long. "Sure."
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish..."
Castiel starts to say something, glances over the faces in the room around them and stops. "Right."
While they talk, Claire is joined by the rest of the wayward sisters, who apparently accompanied her.
"Maybe it just means we should remember that we forgot them, or something", Cas replies, smiling. "Anyway, it is about old friends." He leans in to kiss Dean again.
"Speak of the devil", Dean says. "Or, rather, speak of the queen."
That's
"I heard there's a party at the motel's bar tonight."
"Well, how does it work?", Dean asks.
"No, you do not."
"I don't want to be human!", Chuck squeals.
insist."
"Not intentional. I know, right." He smirks. "You know, at first, I was
Cas pulls back after the last word, muttering in an unhappy tone "But I
Sam puts down his phone, smiling as well. "Eileen is okay", he declares.
He swallows, trying to remind himself that Cas probably does not even care. He even might not know what the date signifies, aside from its original meaning as Christian feast day.
"Sure."
Cas just smiles, not saying anything.
On the table and on the floor, Sam can see several empty bottles. When he looks closer, he glimpses something blue between Dean's arms.
"It was not important", Dean replies, trying to brush it off.
I wanna hold your hand-
"Anytime", Dean replies.
“Hello, Claire”, Castiel says, only now noticing the package Kaia is holding. “What’s this?”
"Well, anyway, I do not want to keep you from dancing, so go ahead."
listen?" His voice is barely understandable by now. "Of course you
"By now, yes. I am sorry."
"Jeez. You are supposed to have heaps of popular knowledge, after Metatron pulled that stunt on you."
Sam inhales. "Look. You know, of course, that Dad tried to do his best. But..." He swallows. "His best was crappy a lot of times." He waves his hands. "He, uh, instilled a lot of crap into Dean's mind. Always be strong, always be merciless, always be..."
"Exactly", Dean exclaims. "Hunting without being actually in deadly danger. ... As I said,
Cas raises his eyebrows. "I don't know. ... Mary, look, I am not sure if you know that it was my fault that... I knew that Jack was not fine. If I had told Sam and Dean..."
"Sounds good", Dean replies with a short nod. With a wide smile, he adds "It's a date, then."
"Don't worry about it, buddy", Dean says, giving him a friendly clap on the shoulder. "I'm sure you'll be awesome."
„Sure.“ Castiel looks down onto himself. „It does look - cool, I think. Thank you, Claire and Kaia.“ He smiles at them fondly.
"Hold still for a second", Cas says, putting his hand on Dean's forehead.
Dean swallows, confused about his reaction to this invasion. The man is decidedly too close, with his dark brown hair, his brilliant blue eyes and his aftershave, which smells sort of like... With a jerk, Dean moves out of Jack's space.
The figure raises its eyebrows.
"Sam told me much later that you picked up the trenchcoat and folded it. Like... Like they do with flags at funerals."
Sam sighs. "I know, right. It has been driving me crazy for years."
Dean chuckles. "We had this enormous apple pie..."
He had not realized he had started crying. He chuckles. "Yes. I... I'm just a bit overwhelmed, I think. But... It's... It's all fine, angel."
"H- How did we get here?", Sam brings out.
"Home."
He is interrupted by Cas, who is moving closer to him. "Don't apologize. Your words may be rude, but I can see the intent. And this... is enough."
Somewhat belated, panic sets in, and Dean's mind is trying to find a mitigating addition, something, just
"Oh, that. Yeah. I don't see why not." Castiel places his cup on the table, looking at Dean with his usual intent glare. "Right now?"
, he thinks while running his hands through his hair. "Yes, Cas?"
"Yeah. Yes. Together with your namesake. Bullets, knife. Nothing making a dent. Wait, I literally stabbed you in the heart when we first met. Tell about foreshadowing."
The figure in front of him says nothing, gives him a hateful glare.
Meanwhile, the Empty is sleeping peacefully, completely missing Cas' moment of true happiness.
loud, boy."
Jo is dying, and there is nothing he can do. And she is dying because she protected him. Because she saved him. He wishes so much there was a way to save her. But of course there is not, and instead he kisses her goodbye.
I couldn't comprehend it. And then..." His voice breaks. "And then you were gone, and it was too late." For just a moment, Dean feels the despair as if it happened yesterday.
"Welcome to Moondoor, noble Sir Castiel."
He glares at the human, saying "I pulled you out of Hell. And I can drag you back."
Sam shoots Dean a glance which seems to say "Whoa. It has been a long time since we heard Cas this scornful, hasn't it?"
"Oh!", Jack exclaims. "That sounds cool. And... maybe even romantic, if you ask me."
For a moment, there is absolute silence.
"No. No. It's not okay", Dean brings out.
From the back of the cave, there is a threatening grumble. At least, it is meant to be threatening.
At the war room table, the other Dean -
"What?", Cas asks, bewildered.
When he comes back to the table, they are still discussing. He can hear Dean say ".... that's one way of saying it, too."
For a while, Cas is occupied with petting Miracle. Finally, he stands up again and turns towards Dean.
"Can I come in?", Castiel asks.
"But we are here now", Cas reminds him, putting a hand on Dean's shoulder in his usual way.
"If you insist."
"I know." Jack nods. "All, in all, it has been a rather good run, wouldn't you say?"
"This is a nice dream", he mutters, gripping the coat fabric tighter.
Dean is running again, this time along with Cas.
Sam is just staring at him, not saying anything.
"I rematerialized in Dean's bed."
"Right", he corrects himself. "Greetings, my queen", he adds, curtsying.
Forcing his voice to stay calm and even, Dean replies "Maybe. You might. But see, there's a flaw in your thought process."
When he sees Castiel's raised eyebrows, he exclaims.
Dean smiles, frowning. "What does this song mean? I never got it. 'Should auld acquaintance be forgot' - should we forget old acquaintances? Or if we forget them, should we remember them? Which is not possible because we already forgot them!"
"Hold on to something!", Jack screams, grabbing Dean's arm to prevent him from being sucked out into space.
"If you don't mind", Dean replies, suddenly feeling very tired, tension starting to leave his body.
Before Cas can answer, there is another voice booming. "I DON'T BELIEVE THIS." The voice seems to come from everywhere at once.
He flinches, but does not duck away. After all, it is his fault. Not Sammy's. He will not have Dad taking it out on his little brother. Not for the first time he wishes Mom was still there.
Finally, it sighs. "Fine."
"If something happened to Mary, you are dead to me. You are dead to me."
"Of course", Cas replies, pulling Jack in for a hug. "Take care."
"Yes. Yes", Dean mutters. "I'll..." Just as he takes out the phone to dial Sam's number, he receives a call. "Speak of the devil", he remarks as he sees Sam's name on the display. "Hi, Sammy." He frowns. "What do you mean, they're all gone?" He listens for about a minute, then hangs up without a word.
He is yelling at Mom, telling her that he hates her. And he hates himself for yelling it. Of course, he also whispers at her "I love you." But still.
Unimpressed by the glare, Sam replies "All right. I'm not saying anything, man. In fact, I'll go over there and stare holes into the sky or something." With this, he turns and walks off.
Cas tried to do.
"I'm right here", a voice says, indignant.
"Stop. Yes, for quite a time, Heaven was rather boring, but ever since Jack took over, it has been a really neat place." She smiles, spreading out her arms. "What's cool is that you can do
"See you later", Dean signs. "Have fun at the steakhouse." As he looks after Sam and Eileen, his hand wanders to the package sitting on the library table, fidgeting with it.
The smile widens. "No. You're awful."
John scoffs. "Who
The angel glances at him from where he sits, not saying anything, which Jack takes as an invitation to continue.
"Not that. It is just..."
"Ahem." Sam coughs slightly. "Who did you imagine the tomato was?"
John opens his mouth as if to say anything, but then closes it again, gaze wandering to the floor.
Between his teeth, Dean presses out "... because this is where the ashes were, okay."
"Yes?"
"Cas...", Dean starts, intending to beg Cas to save himself. But there is no way out for either of them both, he realizes. His mouth goes dry.
"Yes. ... Poetic, isn't it? When we first met, you pulled me out of Hell. And over a decade later, I pulled you out of the Empty." He turns to Bobby, a grin on his face. "Anyway. This is how I met your Uncle Cas."
"Well, look at it like this. Even with the mark screaming at you to do it, you did not kill me."
At some point, the Doctor and Jack find themselves alone in the control room.
Cas glances sideways, trying to recall. "Ah. I see. I remember now. Yes, let us hope he does not forget if it comes to that."
Dean raises his eyebrows while contemplating the tent, but does not say anything.
"What I'm trying to say is, that I saw interest in Dean's face, his look when he saw me for the first time. I wouldn't have hit on him otherwise."
"What sort of danger?", Cas asks.
I wish you would come back, -
Castiel sighs. "No, of course not. It's just that it's ... very restricting, as you said."
"Yes, okay...", Dean mutters and tries to say something more, but she is gone as quickly as she has come in. He turns to Jack. "Couldn't she have told us over the intercom?"
"The people...", Dean mumbles...
Before he is even aware of what he is doing, Dean is propelling himself upward and forward. It is only before in the instant before he hits the black goo that he has a conscious thought.
He blinks. "Thank you."
Sam almost chokes, snorting out coffee through his nose. "You... wait, what?" He stares at Cas, then back at Dean. "I thought you were trying to pick up some chicks."
"Oh." Jack blurts out in laughter. "So you are not only devastatingly handsome, you are also a badass
"It... it was good. Cleared my head a bit. ... Where's Cas?"
The anger boils over, and Dean grabs Cas' arms, in a manner which has to hurt. But he does not care about that in this moment. He is shouting from the top of his lungs now, even if Cas' face is only a few inches away. "WAKE UP", he yells. "I'M NOT LEAVING WITHOUT YOU."
"Oh yeah, I'll tell you something-
"I meant, the... What's a TARDIS?"
The door opens.
Can't we have a frigging break for once?"
Mary just shakes her head in a dismissive gesture. "It's fine, Cas. I... You know, the whole time I was alive again, I felt ... out of place." She puts her hand on Cas' arm to squeeze it. "It's fine, really."
With all your faults, I love you still -
"Do you have still some of the ingredients left?"
"Dean. You eventually forgave me, remember."
I can't hide-
Sam raises his eyebrow, watching Dean as he takes a tomato from the fruit bowl and chops it in half with one violent motion. "Sure", he mutters, pretending to turn his attention back to the newspaper.
Cas scoffs. "How do we know you are no danger to us? What is this trip about?"
"Love is but a song to sing-
Dean chuckles. "Well. Yeah." He clears his throat. "Thank you."
"Still, I shouldn't have told you you were dead to me. And let you leave. That was..."
"I see. It's never easy, is it?"
Trying not to choke, Dean swallows down the rest of his bite. "Like what?", he asks, while nervously fumbling with his plate.
"What the hell?"
, Dean thinks.
Cas takes it from him, opening it carefully. The first item is a jar. "Honey", Cas mumbles with a small smile.
, Cas reminds him.
Cas shakes his head, unsure. "I... I do not know. Maybe..." He pauses, looking at Dean with his usual, intent gaze. "Maybe I was wrong. Maybe just being is not enough after all."
Cas nodded and offered a small smile in return. “Okay.”
recall sharp burgundy horns curling from the alpha’s skull, as was common for most Infernal beings. Oh, and he was quite young, which had somewhat surprised Castiel. Still, it wasn’t as if he’d had any especially rigid expectations, regarding the king’s age or appearance. And considering everything he’d been put through over the past day or so… well, it would have taken quite a bombshell to
Nothing happens.
Dean scrubbed harshly at his eyes. “Fuck. Well, like I said before, I ain’t gonna be the one responsible for your death by the elements. So, I guess you’re gonna be staying here. Still don’t know how comfortable I am just handing off a
And they aren’t even an official couple yet.
, of all topics. Actually, no, the thing was a goddamn
To his luck, Charlie continued, “Like I said, I’ll get right down to… it. ‘Cause it’s kinda a lot. Unfortunately,” she said, planting her hands on her hips and entering an inadvertent power pose. “Cas here, just like the unlucky bastard that he is, managed to go and get himself
Castiel cast a smile in Dean’s direction. “Yes, of course I would like to be your “real” husband.”
Cas held his breath, anticipating the sharp-eyed witch’s professional assessment. She continued to squint upward, claw-like hands finding their way to her hips.
“So you’ll be burning this? Just the hair, right? I didn’t get the locket until after Elizabeth’s death. Still, it reminds me of her,” Alfred said meekly.
“My first question. Listen, you don’t have to answer. I was just wondering why you’re having trouble sleeping.”
Dean shrugged. “Honestly? I don’t know. We’ll just have to wait and see. Don’t worry, I can handle it, okay?”
Dean rushes over, falls to his knees. The Shadow looms, quiet.
“Yeah, Cas?”
than spending his life cloaked by the opaque shadow of whichever alpha his father handed him off to.
Oh, now that the "multiverse" is no longer on the brink of swallowing itself whole?
Castiel had furiously psyched himself up and was prepared to be jumped as soon as he entered the bedroom— if not before then. But, to his more than mild amazement, Dean restrained himself. The alpha was perched on the edge of their bed, knuckles turning white as his grip practically tore into the mattress. His gaze was plastered to the floor in the room’s far corner.
“What she said,” Dean grumbled, clearly disappointed that he’d lost the opportunity to raise the point, himself.
Full battery, good signal. Probably have Jack to thank for
MACIE
The room went silent. Castiel closed his eyes, temporarily escaping the situation. How was Dean possibly going to answer?
Benny sighed, as if the conversation were exceptionally draining to him. “I know. I wasn’t gonna tell him. Maybe give away a hint, but that was all.”
"Dude, the fag is overtaking you."
Dean nodded. “Thanks, man. See you tomorrow morning.”
(then)
Castiel took a few calculated steps closer.
“Then why take me on as a partner? Since you obviously weren’t planning on telling me about whatever sort of
Maybe, the story just...
“Yes,” Castiel said. “A friend of mine reached out to me after the recent death of his second wife. By his account, he watched as she was thrown off of a third floor balcony. By what he believes was the ghost of his first wife.”
EILEEN
Dean, finally, met Castiel eyes. Another deep breath. “I like you, Cas.”
Assuming.
There was a pause.
“Don’t you have more hunting gear? Shouldn’t we take advantage of that?” Dean asked, entirely thrown off by the other hunter’s decision.
"You never answered me," Meg mutters, her voice still void of any clear emotion. Which, frankly, makes Dean nervous as hell.
shit. Calm as ever and ready to have a terrible time.
“The guy’s not human,” Dean said quickly.
Dean pauses the movie, causing Cas to release a full-body sigh.
That might offer an alternate explanation for his father pushing a scent-inhibiting tonic onto him— rather than being used for Castiel’s own protection, it would ensure no one found and
The Shadow finally notices, is ENRAGED. Shoves Dean out of the way, TACKLES Cas to the ground.
“So, what? You’re some kinda hyper-advanced, rogue demon? Or are you something else? Just… what the hell are you? ‘Cause I’m sorry man, but I gotta know if I should be hunting you right now.”
As Dean begins to stroke Cas's hair... awaken, he does.
After a minute, Cas is the first to pull away.
Castiel passed a quick glance over toward Mary. She looked as if she were on cloud nine.
Dean chuckled. “Just wanted to make sure.”
Eileen chuckled, butting in, “We were intending to visit you today, Dean. But we showed up to yours, and Benny kindly explained to us the hokey romance novel you’d gotten yourself tied up in. It only seemed fair that we’d get to sit in on your
Castiel is rummaging through his locker after school the next day, attempting not to be late for the bus (once again) - particularly because he doesn’t want to deal with Gabriel’s teasing when he picks Cas up.
Seeing as Dean was beginning to work himself up, Castiel laid a hand on his shoulder, hoping to ground the demon. He gave the hemp-covered flesh a soft squeeze. Fortunately, Castiel felt the alpha release his rapidly tensing muscles, albeit just by a smidge. “Dean, I’ve already told you, King Chuck isn’t exactly the pinnacle of fatherhood. I know that his actions sound terrible, and that’s because they
“Nothin’,” Dean said, followed by a sigh. “Doesn’t matter.”
“N- no…” Castiel managed to stutter. Dazed as he was, nothing else seemed to come out. Castiel let out a sigh and pulled Dean back in closer, pressing their lips together once again.
At the uproar, Dean was quick to jerk upright, brow furrowed. Castiel was certain he had a similar look twisting up his own face, briefly holding eye contact with the demon king. Until Dean stood, turning away.
The pair of hunters headed up the final set of stairs, Castiel just ahead of Dean. The shorter man was still carrying both canisters of salt.
Castiel’s smile grew. He was standing just a few feet from Dean, now. “Well, I
Dean looked toward the oven for a moment, then back at Castiel. “Hm?”
(warm)
involve either work or… meaty disappointments.
(squeezing Claire's hand)
Dean laughed again, clearly growing more at ease with the situation. “Dude, of course I was comfortable coming out to you. Only problem was that I wasn’t comfortable enough with myself to accept it, y’know? The problem was coming out to myself, I guess.”
Cas hadn’t seen Lucifer once in the past four years, despite the occasional phone call.
For many Christmas Eves to come.
Arrogance was sure to be a legacy of Chuck’s rule, or at least, Castiel could certainly hope. He sure as hell didn’t deserve to be remembered for his tax policies, which were flimsy at best and regurgitated from the maws of monarchs prior.
(oh, fuck it)
“What do you mean?”
Dean in order to sleep.
“Is that all you wanted to discuss?” Cas inquires plainly.
Dean chuckled. “Actually, Cas here asked me out.”
With a concluding grunt, Dean began to yank fresh beef and a head of lettuce from the fridge.
Castiel hadn’t been so eager.
Castiel didn’t return the kiss immediately, which allowed Dean a second or two to panic. When Castiel did began to move his lips against the green-eyed boy’s, however, Dean felt every molecule of his body relax. He sunk into the kiss, enjoying the feeling of Castiel’s arms woven around his neck.
“You carry everything in there?” Dean asked as Castiel unlocked the door.
Dean smiled back, hesitantly, before opening the motel room door. Castiel followed shortly behind him.
“Setting my alarm,” Castiel replied. “I forgot to earlier, so I suppose I’m thankful I didn’t fall asleep. Also, I don’t have class until later, remember? So I can’t rely on you to wake me up.”
They lay in comfortable silence for a bit longer, listening only to one another’s breathing.
Castiel’s mouth hung open just slightly, expecting Dean to speak. Instead they were silent for a moment.
Mary hummed. “And why is that?”
I promise, I'll tell
Dean held his breath for another moment. “I just… I have some news. Thought it’d be better to let you know sooner than later.”
Dean pursed his lips before responding. “Honestly? I just like the environment. Can’t drink tonight, don’t have a designated driver. I wanted to play some pool maybe, but my uncle’s still pissed from the last time I gambled. And yeah, I’m pretty regular here.”
“Wait,” he said. “How exactly are you checking out at five in the morning?”
“Uh, yeah. I live with my uncle. Surrogate uncle, technically. But he’s just as much family as a blood-relative, trust me.”
Still, he was tempted to drop some kind of half thought-out retort on the demon. Dean continued, ignoring the urge:
galore, too.
“I promise not to freak out,” Castiel said, attempting to meet Dean’s averted gaze.
The aforementioned pair lay in Dean’s bed that night, shoulders brushing and hands intertwined. Cas had suggested that they watch the stars that night, although Dean had adamantly refused. Dean’s defiance had surprised Cas, but he knew that if Dean wanted to do what they were doing, there had to be a good reason.
“Is something wrong? You not out to your brother yet?”
'Course I know that. You don't gotta remind me.
Guess that's my ride.
“I know,” Jimmy said. “You’re like, the fifth person to go over this with me. I get it.”
Castiel’s smile faded.
Seeming to sense the silence that followed wasn’t a comfortable one, Dean pulled away from Castiel’s neck. “Cas? Everything alright?”
startle Castiel, at that rate.
Mary scoffed. “Now, how many times have I told you not to call me that? It’s Mary.”
Charlie squealed. “Okay, I’m just throwing this out there, but you guys should totally kiss.”
“My name. It’s Castiel.”
And up first, the less-than-honest edition.
“Nice to meet you,” Lucifer says, tone relaxed. He holds out a hand, which Dean begrudgingly takes.
“Yes, Dean?”
Turning to his brother and tapping him on the arm, Castiel spoke. “It’s fine, Gabe. Just… you can just wait right outside, okay? This needs to be done, and I promise that I can handle myself.”
now. Sight would’ve definitely been useful, that much he knew.
“Sammy…” Dean said, sighing heavily this time. “I don’t know why. I always have, and I probably always will. Believe in Uncle Bobby’s lore, I mean. Part of me… it wants to go out there and find it, y’know? Maybe even be one of the ‘hunters’ from Bobby’s stories.” Dean paused to chuckle. “I sound fuckin’ ridiculous right now, don’t I?”
Oh, SHUT UP!
The omega sucked in air through his teeth. “Wow. That’s… wow. You were right, it’s certainly a lot to process.” He frowned. Wait a second— “Do you still have the Mark, then?”
The demon jerked in his seat— clearly, he was just as baffled by this development as his mate. “Huh? Who is…? How would— uh, how would anyone even know that I’m here?”
“How’d you kill the thing, anyway?”
Dean held his breath for a moment, mulling over his words carefully. “Cas,” he said. “I still don’t think I can say for sure.”
“Nice to see you two,” John said from a chair in the back of the room. Dean nodded in his direction.
I'm not even
Clark is PISSED, CHUCKING the paperback to the floor-- SLAM!
--pulls him in, clutched tight, for a short KISS. Barely a peck. Then pulls away, ever so slightly. Inches between.
Through an archway to Cas’s right, a man appears. He is fully dressed, donning a pale blue button up shirt and just slightly worn-out jeans. Cas makes sure to flash the other man a grin.
“Baby,” Dean says softly. “I have something important to tell you, but first I need to know what’s wrong.”
Cas became flustered immediately. "No," he had said quickly. "I'm visiting a friend. That is all."
“Of freakin’ course.”
Castiel had to admit, there was something incredibly off-putting about referring to a demonic ex-warlord turned Infernal King as “Dean.” Although, Castiel could also see a perverse humor to it. He really wasn’t sure
Dean takes a deep breath. He
"We got stuck", the Doctor replies, running from one control to the other. "We're trapped in the rift."
"What?", she mutters, staring back.
"Heart attack", Cas replies. "Sam was there and rushed me to the hospital, so I was not alone. ... Could have been worse, I guess."
"And this makes all the difference. Of course. Did you ever consider that you're a bigot?"
"Excuse me", Sam says, jumping up. "Going to look for some scrambled eggs."
Dean looks up from the plate he is holding. "Yes?"
You are as old as the stars, as old as the universe, and... And then you go and lose your mind over one human? That's
" Dean raises his eyebrows, pretty sure where this is going. "Are you telling me..."
"Yeah, why does that something always seem to be..." Dean breaks off and blinks because something is different. This
"What were you thinking? ... Were you
"What just happened?", Sam says in a loud voice, trying to speak over the noise. "This rumbling doesn't sound good."
The angel knits his eyebrows. "What sensation? There should just be the pain disappearing."
"Unusual to see you without your trenchcoat. ... And your tie."
"Yeah", Dean mutters, waving at Cas. "Some bullshit about me being the most caring man on Earth, and..."
"Me?", Cas asks, confusion showing on his face.
"Sam...", Yaz begins. "Not that it is any of my business, but... Your brother and your friend, are they..."
"Awesome", Dean mutters, but the tone does not match the message.
"Yes, I know. I mean..." Cas breaks off when he sees a familiar figure between the tents, wearing a brown outfit with a chain maille top. "Dean?", he mumbles, already moving towards him. Louder, he calls out "Dean!"
"I know, Dean. Eileen mentioned it to me three weeks ago."
. ... You changed me, Dean."
"Oh."
"Hi, kiddo", Dean greets her.
The other Dean frowns innocently. "What?"
"Yeah. Just... just give him time to process. Dean's not the best one at processing emotions, you know?"
"Uh... Yes. I was there when he made it."
"Hmm", she says, thinking. "Matter of fact, we have had issues with a dangerous creature lately. A few miles north of this place."
Realization hits Dean.
"I'm sorry, I..."
... Idiot."
"If you ask me, there are better ways to have fun."
"Good."
The death glare does not change, and Dean's throat goes dry. "Listen..."
"I disagree. Even soldiers need breaks sometimes."
Cas shakes his head in disbelief. "How about I am leaving?"
", the Doctor exclaims, relieved to be able to change the topic. "Yes", she agrees, scrunching up her face. "There seems to be
I wish you would, I wish you would...
"No", Dean interrupts him. "No hulking out here, buddy, ... sir." Shaking his head, he adds "No, sir. I think your first impression is right. We need another approach here."
"Hello, Dean", he hears the familiar greeting.
"Thank you for telling it again", Bobby says.
gave up."
I wanna hold your hand-
"Ah. Of course. I see", Sam murmurs. After glancing from Dean to Castiel and back, he finally pulls Castiel into a hug. "Boy, is it good to see you."
"You always knew how to push my buttons -
Bobby does not address his wet eyes. Instead, he says "It's gonna be fine. It's just a scratch. Let's get you a bandage, boy."
Cas obliges, positioning himself so that he lies on top of Dean, interlacing their hands together.
With a knowing glance, Amara looks at Dean and sighs. Raising her hands, she starts mumbling in Enochian. Behind her, a portal opens.
The grumbling stops.
"Welcome to Heaven, idjit. Took you long enough", is the first thing he hears.
"Uh, the whole waking-up-in-my-arms thing? Because you know, that seems awkward."
Cas is still looking out on the water, and Dean takes a moment to contemplate his profile. His angel is older now, of course, but still beautiful, not to say devastatingly handsome. "Hell of a story, isn't it, if you think about it?", he mumbles, not taking his eyes off Cas' face.
"Torchwood?"
The Shadow changes it strategy, morphing into another form, and Dean has to remind himself that this is not real.
“That he is”, Dean agrees. “Constantine’s a badass.”
Amara shrugs. "I think that should be possible, yes." She smiles. "I am the Darkness. It will come when I call."
“Nice. Very nice”, Dean says. He frowns, looking at Claire. “Constantine, isn’t it?”, he asks.
"I haven't laughed so much in years", Dean brings out, his sides still aching from running and laughing.
"I didn't say I didn't care. I didn't mind it, is what I'm saying."
"Yes", a voice behind him confirms.
"Again?", Dean asks, his expression amused.
, he is going to be damned if he will not address it. "Uh... every time you heal me, I feel this... uh, sensation and..."
"And then you had to make it
stop now, cowboy."
"You too."
Castiel's voice is but a whisper when he addresses Dean. "Y- You don’t need to."
, Dean thinks, groaning.
. Soldiers do not need to dance."
"I always wondered, ever since I took that burden, that curse, I wondered what it could be? What my true happiness could even look like. I never found an answer because the one thing I want... It is something I know I cannot have. But I think I know... I think I know now. Happiness is not in the having, it is in just being. It is in just saying it."
mean it. Every word."
Dean frowns. "So, as Sam said... what now?"
Dean turns around. "Jack." He raises his eyebrows. "I thought getting me was a reaper's job."
One of the servants approaches the queen, whispering into her ear. "Uh, excuse me, my queen, but... what tradition?"
I wanna hold your hand"
Before he can do anything at all, however, the door of Mary's and John's house opens with a loud bang. "
"It's 2 AM in your car -
The creature pouts. "Oh? Do tell. This better be good. Because the last time I saw you, you made it
Its finger wanders around, pointing at Cas. "You make sure this obnoxious angel does not bother me anymore, ever. Because otherwise, if we call off the deal, the next time he dies, it is gonna be loud again. And I have had enough of that." It steps closer to Cas, circles him. "In other words... make him human. Take away everything that makes him an angel and I will agree to your deal, nullifying the old one."
1. It is all faux leather, mind, since Cas insisted.
"It seems so", Amara replies. "Thanks to Jack giving up his power."
?", John snaps, practically yelling at her.
"Dean, wait", Castiel exclaims and rushes after him. "Dean."
Pieces of broken glass fall down on him from seemingly everywhere, and he cowers in fear.
"I wasn't talking about me." Jack pulls back, out of Dean's personal space, to emphasize his point. He raises his eyebrows. "Look, that angel of yours..." He pauses. "How did you two meet anyway? Must be hell of a story."
Sam in his arms, he stares hopelessly as the house burns down.
"No. It's not", Castiel disagrees, visibly upset.
"It is decided, then", Dean determines with a smile. "We will take care of this nuisance for you, my lady."
"I have a suggestion", Jack begins. "We could rebuild Heaven together. I'd like to leave humanity alone, but you and me, we could remake Paradise. ... Of course, you should take the lead. I'm still a four-year-old, after all."
Dean nods. "Do you think you could nullify it? I mean, you're God now..." He glances at Amara, stammers "...or God's grandnephew at least, or whatever."
Jack is smiling broadly. "We got them all back", he exclaims.
At this, Dean finds his voice again. "God's dad."
When I say that something-
"Or is it something else you want?", Dean asks in a soothing voice, moving a bit closer to the back of the cave.
"Likewise, Sam", Castiel replies.
Afterwards, they are lying face-to-face when Cas mumbles "So that is what it means to have a kink."
"Er... mixed. ... Dean, what is this?"
"Dean, angels are
He sees realization form in the angel's eyes. "Dean?..."
"Oh." She smiles. "So you're okay, more or less. That's a relief. ... I'm going to make a wild guess and assume that you want my help with getting back into the other vessel."
Cas shudders at recalling. "Yes. She... she did that."
, Dean thinks, crossing his arms and closing his eyes.
Dean obliges only too willing and lets himself being pushed onto the bed, his brain almost short-circuiting with the thought
"Good." Cas resumes moving, simultaneously showering his neck with kisses again.
"I don't want to pressure you, but... I was wondering..."
"It's okay."
"Hi there, again", Dean greets her.
"Well, yeah... It was a title she gave me some while ago and it sort of stuck", Dean explains.  "Yes. I'm the Queen's loyal handmaiden."
It shoots Sam a grin. "Hello Sam. Nice to see you again."
You can make mountains ring-
"Of course I can't... uh, I can't expect you to, and I don't expect you to.."
"Hello, Sam", Castiel greets him.
I wanna hold your hand-
Dean feels a hysterical fit coming on. "Oh... Now that's crappy timing, Billie." Laughter rises up in his chest, mixed with sobbing. Helplessly, he lets himself slide down the wall, laughing and crying so hard that it almost feels he could die from it. He does not, of course.
Even without looking, he knows that the angel is staring at him with a bewildered look.
"I need your help, Dean", says Castiel, his voice a mere whisper.
"Oh no", the Doctor sighs. "Jack,
, Dean thinks.
John grumbles. "No? Because to me, it sure as hell sounds like you
?" Before Cas can answer, he holds up his hand and shakes his head. "No. Never mind. Don't answer that."
"Nice. I do hope it pays more for you."
Dean laughs, tears in his eyes. "Yes, that's what I said, you idiot."
"Brilliant!", the Doctor exclaims, hurrying to the lever. "Let's go!"
The door opens. "She's here", Donna announces.
"Fuck. Cas... wait, we need..."
The Doctor turns around, throws her arms into the air. "Jack. There are things I can control, and there are some I can't control. Like this. It's, sort of welded into my genes. I wish it wasn't like this, but I literally can't..."
Castiel's eyebrows wander even higher.
He can already feel himself fading, growing weaker. Desperate, he hovers above the motionless body, trying to find a way back in.
Dean shakes his head. "
Staring at the bathtub, he is filled with dread and horror.
"We were friends for a long time."
"Here we are", Jack says, gesturing at the field stretching in front of them.
Wracking his brain for something which could possibly calm John down, Dean gives an awkward, nervous chuckle. Of course, this is the wrong response, since John is now moving to stand up.
"Of course he is", Dean remarks. "After all, all dogs go to Heaven."
Dean scoffs. "It’s a tradition, she said. Not gonna break it." He pauses, carefully assessing Castiel's expression, which betrays nervousness. "Unless you don’t want me to, of course", he adds. "Wouldn’t want to make you uncomfortable."
Dean halts. "I, uh... Bobby, I'd actually like to skip the next part. I..."
"I know."
"Right. Right. I'll..."
"Dean", Cas interrupts him. "It is a feedback loop. It is true that I would not initiate this sort of intimacy on my own, but giving you pleasure gives
"Hey, angel", Dean greets him, meeting him about halfway and pulling him into a tight embrace. "So what was it?"
„You‘re welcome. Happy Birthday, Cas.“
„Hi, Claire", Dean hears himself say in a gruff voice.
Some weeks later, on a hunt, Dean manages to get banged up again.
Dean reaches down to get rid of his pants and underwear, so that the suede pants are now directly rubbing against his legs and groin. The sensation is almost too much. But only almost. He stretches out his legs to maximize contact with the leather boots as well. It feels... He has no words or thoughts for how it feels.
What comes out, instead, is this.
"Uh... No." Dean shakes his head. "I... I think I was quick to open up to him, but falling in love... That came later."
Remembering what John said about tears, he tries to bite them back.
"Can't I?"
"Shouldn't have treated you like that, though", Dean mutters. "I'm not proud of saying that I... didn't care you were broken."
"What are you talking about, man?", Dean asks, desperate to comprehend what Cas just told him, trying to understand what Cas is getting at. He definitely does not anticipate what comes next.
"What?" He opens his eyes to see the scythe on the ground and Billie gone. "What?", he repeats, voice shaking.
So, without any further words, Sam, Dean, Castiel and Mary leave.
"Yeah." At this remark, Dean laughs again.
The creature raises one finger. "On one condition."
"What? Dude, no, that's not..."
Cas nods. "It was beautiful."
Instead of answering, Dean stomps towards the Impala.
"You're right about that. ... We'll join you and Bobby later, all right?, Dean asks.
, man", Dean snaps. "You didn't want to add to our burdens? What the hell did you think you dying would do to us?" He has talked himself into a hot rage. "You... You always act as if you don't matter. As if you don't matter to us." His voice cracks. "As... As if you don't matter to me."  He goes quiet, staring at the floor as well. Then he takes a deep breath. "Because... you do, you know. Matter to us. Jack, Sam, me, we all need you. ... I need you."
"You're hitting on Cas? Really?"
"I know. I know how you see yourself, Dean. You see yourself the same way our enemies see you. You are destructive, and you are angry, and you are broken. You're “daddy's blunt instrument.” And you think that hate and anger, that is... That is what drives you, that is who you are. It is not. And everyone who knows you sees it. Everything you have ever done, the good and the bad, you have done for love. You raised your little brother for love. You fought for this whole world
Cas briefly breaks eye contact to let his gaze wander over their surroundings. "Uh... What are you doing here?"
"What, dying and being resurrected again?"
And Dean steps into the light.
Jody and Donna briefly look at each other. "Sure", Jody says. "What were you thinking of?"
Sam and Castiel stay back in the corridor, looking after Dean.
I wish we could go back -
"I'm sorry about my friends. They think one needs drugs to have fun."
, Dean thinks, desperate.
In front of the kitchen, Dean hesitates, taking Castiel in from an angle where Castiel cannot yet see him. He bites his lip.
"But you seemed... disgusted", Castiel explains, his tone full of sadness.
"Well, so is this", Dean replies, patting his chain mail shirt. "You don't hear me complaining, do you?"
Truth be told, the animated Castiel is not looking too well, his outline being somewhat blurry and his skin tone very pale.
Suddenly it feels like Dean has something lodged in his throat, and he swallows hard.
Dean blinks, blinded by the sun. A few blinks later, he realizes that he is standing on a meadow. When he turns around, to his relief, Cas is standing there. He pulls him into a hug. A long one. He only pulls away when his cell phone chimes. It is Sam on the other end. "Hey, Sammy. I'm afraid you have to pick us up. Wait, what? All of them?"
"Yes."
Dean laughs. "Oh, come on. I'll admit that it is heavy and not as cozy as a trenchcoat, but come on. You're an angel. So... the weight shouldn't be a problem for you, should it?"
"I don't believe it", Dean laughs out, then pulls the angel in for a kiss.
At this, Dean stops, just now realizing the state of the kitchen counter.
"Yes, Dean?", Cas asks, his look showing nothing but utter adoration.
Jack shoots Dean a smile. "How's the engine coming?" He scoots closer to the engine, right into Dean's personal space.
Of course, Cas protests. "It was not bullshit."
Sam clears his throat. "Yeah, right."
They are both leaning into the touch, awfully close to each other, and Dean can feel his throat going dry.
Cas sighs. "One minute." He faces Jack. "I trust we will see you around?"
"I can see that", Sam replies. "Good for you", he says with a nod and moves to leave.
"Like kiss someone", Jack replies with a wide grin.
To stand back where you stood -
"Yes!" She jumps up and down in excitement. "I recreated Moondoor!"
"Nah. I was attracted to her, but... No. And in hindsight... I think she actually
Cas shakes his head again. "No. I made a deal.
Now that the two of them are alone in the bunker, Dean cannot hold back the question anymore. "Why didn't it work?"
"Uh... Really?", Dean sputters, looking at the mug with a frown.
"I suspect it was actually around the time I betrayed you and Sam", Cas says, quietly. "You were trying to be so loyal."
Dean has turned around to face Cas. "Cas..." He swallows. "There has to be another way."
It is Dean's turn to step closer. He raises his eyebrows in a questioning way. "So, can I, or...", he points upward, then corrects himself by making a sweeping gesture, "...or is this a violation of heavenly decency rules?"
He stills, a thought making its way into his mind.
"This was a cool afternoon." Charlie smiles at them. "I hope that you two will come around another time to play again."
"Oh."
"Yeah, right. But this... I mean, you can't..."
"By now, yes. Dean, are you telling me..."
"The wall is giving way", Jack determines, voice strained. "I'm sorry. It's not fair."
The first spell knocks Castiel out flat on his back. Before he can get up again, the second spell hits him.
THE END
"I don't care." Taking Cas' hands into his, he smiles at him. "The thought counts."
"About that", Jack begins. "I... We have a proposal for you."
He is cut off by Cas, who has moved between Dean and the man in the coat and is now staring - no,
"We need to pimp up the TARDIS", the Doctor announces. "Otherwise she cannot close the rift. I need someone here to move heavy parts."
"This? The package? Uh..." Dean lets out an awkward chuckle. "Uh", he stammers, "... I thought, it might be a nice idea to get something for... uh, today." For no reason at all, his throat has gone dry. "Because, you know, today's..."
Jack nods. "From time to time. ... Will you give me a call when Dean has cooled off again?"
"Love, I mean."
"Jack, not
"Huh?", Dean asks, turning back to look at Sam. "Who was..." He breaks off. "Yeah. I know", he mumbles and leaves the room.
Sam chuckles, awkwardly. "Um... I don't think you did anything wrong, Cas."
Dean chuckles awkwardly. "Yeah,
Sam tosses the keys on the table. "Successful. Did I miss much while I was away?"
"I decided to make an exception."
"She died", Cas mutters. "She
"Lovely. Where's the catch?"
For some reason, Dean can hear the following words in his mind even if John does not say them aloud.
His voice is hoarse when he addresses Cas. "Come here, cowboy."
to be here."
"What?" Dean chuckles, his eyebrows raised. "LARPing, of course."
"I was so happy when I found you. So relieved. And then... you
"What do you say, angel?", Dean asks with a radiant smile. "Small vacation?"
"12 years and three months", Cas corrects.
"Ah. Good." It turns out he had not needed to worry, after all. "It's a very silly pun, though. I mean, 'we bee-long together'? Silly and sappy."
"That's a long story, too. I..."
"Yes?"
His internal monologue is interrupted by familiar steps coming from the corridor. "Dean?"
"Don't know what you're talking about", Dean replies, not making any move to cover up his neck.
him", John repeats.
"You always knew how to push my buttons -
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good. -
It is not Dean who answers. "It was, yes."
"See, the main reason you are here, despite the way you treated your children... You are here in Heaven mainly because Dean wants you here. Because he thinks you
"What, Dean?"
For auld lang syne, my dear -
What did you have in mind?"
Cas sounds rueful. "I did, but... the third time we met we became friends."
"Yes", Cas agrees while he heals Sam and Dean (at the last moment stopping himself again from taking hold of Dean's shoulder).
A figure appears over him, and Dean hangs his head to hide the tears.
Thinking of Cas' hand hovering over his some minutes ago, Dean replies "You know, that tingling sensation whenever Cas heals you?"
, Cas asks.
Amara nods. "So you are." She takes a moment to think, looks around at the remade Earth. "Hmm. ... I accept your suggestion, nephew. If you promise me to never lock me up or attack me in some way. And I promise to not got against any of your wishes."
I think you'll understand-
"Cas, come on, buddy", Dean begs, cradling Cas' face in his hands. "Please be okay."
"I know, right. ... I guess I always more expressed my emotions by actions, huh?"
With a bang, the door of the TARDIS opens, and Cas falls onto the floor.
"Do you have to call me th..."
impressive at all." She smirks at Cas. "What's up? Can't wait to come back to me, lover boy?"
"Let's get you out of here, boys", Jody says. "Donna and I are gonna vouch for you."
"Yes, it is." The Doctor frowns, then adds. "What is, exactly?"
I wanna hold your hand-
"Dean, I... I didn't realize."
"Ah." In Dean's mind, it clicks. "No dance schools in Heaven, I assume?"
"I see. That explains it, then. Castiel's reaction to Jack hitting on your brother, I mean. Because he seemed... somewhat ...
Dean glances over to Cas, who is still reading on the laptop. "You coming?"
Dean takes a deep breath.
At this, the door leading to the corridor starts to glow, so bright that Dean can barely see the outlines of the people in the room.
Dean feels something violently contract in his chest and then unclench again, enabling him to breathe more freely than he has in the last hours. "In that case... In that case, I... I need to tell you something."
Finally, Dean clears his throat. "No. No. Actually, it's... jealously."
The voice gets even louder. "I will find a way to throw you out, you
"You... you do?", Cas asks, stammering.
I wish you would..."
", Dean protests. "Cas,
He is interrupted by Dean kissing him.
"He was flirting with Cas!", Dean exclaims.
"That is a good question", she says, frowning. "It seems that somehow, the TARDIS' vortex sucked you all in." She whirls around to look at the console. "Now why did she do that? ... Of course, she... ... No. That's not it. I wonder..."
The Captain's face lightens up. "What a coincidence! We do that too. At Torchwood, I mean."
"Time Lord. Trip. No Invasion."
Eyes tightly shut, he waits for the blow. But instead of feeling a blow, he hears something clatter to the ground.
). They seem harmless enough, but then again, a lot of monsters do look harmless at first glance. "So, you're... what? Aliens?"
"Don't you ever think it's weird?", Dean asks, flexing his fingers experimentally.
Desperate, Dean exclaims "Doesn't what I said mean anything?"
"Oh, do give yourself more credit than that, Sammy. Go ask her to dance."
"I see", Dean brings out, still engrossed in laughter. "You can't
Why did he do that? He remembers what it is like to be afraid of a father figure. Why did he yell at the boy? Ben was just curious.
handmaiden", Dean protests, good-humored.
For a moment, Dean just stands there in silence, staring at Cas. Then, in a swift movement, he leans forward, grabs Cas by the collar and kisses him. Almost instantaneously, he pulls back again. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't..."
"Yeah. And let's get the body out of the morgue without your colleagues noticing", Kaia adds.
We'll take a cup of kindness yet-
At all.
She takes a deep breath. "Ah."
Sam sniffles. "I wonder what he is thinking. If he is thinking anything at all."
And remember what we were fighting for. -
"Get out of the way, angel", Death murmurs. "I'm going to make you watch."
I wanna hold your hand"
When Cas comes up to wrap him in his arms, he manages to bring out "This was... amazing." He turns to face Cas, his hand wandering towards Cas' thighs. "Let's take care of you too, shall we, cowboy?", he says with a grin.
"Sorry, what?", Dean asks.
"This... This what you said when Billie chased us. Why didn't the Empty come?" He tries to keep his voice level, but fails. The invasive thought haunting him for the last hours finally makes it way out there into the open. "Did... Did you not mean it? Did you not mean what you said? Because, unless I misunderstood something, if you
Bobby nods, and Cas agrees "Sure, why not?"
crack in the chassis you have there, Cas." He exhales, inhales several times before he continues. "And this nonsense about 'It's something I know I cannot have'. ... You're
"Greetings, loyal handmaiden", she replies, giving him her hand to kiss.
"Pardon me?", Dean asks.
With a heavy sigh, Sam closes the door as quietly as he can.
".... Dean, what are you doing?", Cas asks.
Dean chuckles. "And then we fell in love."
"Of course I'm sure, dumbass", Dean replies, cupping Cas' face in his hands.
Cas frowns, contemplating the tents standing on it. "What is this place?"
"And she
"He... He's disrespectful."
"Didn't realize what?"
"Mhnm", Dean mumbles, clinging to the shape in his arms.
Dean can barely see through his tears, trying to understand what is happening as Billie comes closer and the...
Dean frowns. "Go where? I don't understand."
"Look, I'm sorry I tried to hit on Dean", Jack tries to open the dialogue.
"You think I don't care about you?"
"Too bad for you", Cas remarks. "You know, the irony is, if you truly loved the creation you made, you would appreciate it, this existence. But you are just too pathetic to do that. Well, goodbye."
Dean thinks, panicking.
You'll let me hold your hand-
"I will let you know that I am a
"Hello, nephew", she responds, still a bit disoriented.
"Cas, just forget it. It doesn't matter."
"Space?", Dean asks. "Does that mean we're in space?" He contemplates the three people in front of them. Two women, a man (a
I wish you would
Dean can feel something catch in his throat. "So that's what you did the last four hours?"
Trying not to laugh, Dean continues talking. "You know, there are people out there who are scared of you. People who you hurt. And I..." He clears his throat. "And I was, I was wondering if hurting people is what you want at all?"
"Dude", Sam mutters, "you are literally describing
"It's okay, Dean", Castiel says.
"Okay. Why not."
"Don't psychoanalyze me, Sam", Dean says in a threatening tone.
Dean's heart starts racing for several reasons at once. He turns to the door, his voice somewhat shaky. "Cas?"
"If you say so", Cas responds, standing up. "Er... We should probably let Sam and Jack know about Billie. Call them and..."
"So, uh, I failed", Sir Castiel concludes. "You gave me a task, and I failed." He sighs. "Your handmaiden had to do it for me."
Dean is still lagging behind, trying to stop it. "No. Wait. That's..."
"For auld lang syne -
"Wait. Hang on. What?" Dean brings up his hands in confusion. "You're accusing me of being homophobic?"
- THE END -
"Really? Because it seemed to be a very strong internal conflict. One part of your mind pulling you towards telling me, the other pulling you towards hiding it from me." He frowns. "I wonder what you could feel so conflicted about."
But Cas is already at the door. "We're out of time, Dean", Cas responds, opening it and stepping out.
"So how was your solo mission?", Dean asks the next morning when Sam is back.
, Dean hears a voice in his mind.
"Uncle Dean, Uncle Cas, please tell me how you two met", Bobby begs.
"Dean?", Sam asks, startled. "Is something wrong?"
The warded door busts open, and Billie stands behind it with her scythe.
"Let's not got there. Then... oh boy..."
"Did... Did I just say that out loud?", Dean asks, panic in his voice.
Castiel chuckles. "Yes, you did."
"Amara...", Dean begins, but stops when he realizes that she has vanished. Together with the Shadow and the portal.
The queen laughs in a benevolent manner. "I think it would make a good title, fair handmaiden."
"Is your brother all right? I mean, he seemed angry", HunterCorp Dean asks, glancing at Sam.
, Castiel thinks. He blinks. Or rather, he tries to blink and finds that he can not, as the vessel he needs for blinking is lying there below him. A feeling of fear rushes through him.
"You were just cranky, huh?", Dean grins.
I think you'll understand-
, Dean lies. Which is a challenge, of course. Lying inside your own mind is not easy.
You guessed it-
"Pull my finger", Cas says, laughing.
It took him a year to find him, but he is all right.
Castiel's reaction, however, is different. "W- What?", he stammers.
"By a hair", Dean mutters, recalling the sight he saw in the mirror back then. He forces himself to smile. "Anyway. On to Amara. And..." He cannot bring himself to say Lucifer's name.
At this, Dean gasps. He removes one hand from Cas' grasp to slide it under the leather vest and cling to Cas' back.
"Well, Sam's predicament was my fault. I suppose I did deserve that treatment, after all."
"The urn", Dean mumbles through his fingers. "I... I took it with me to bed when I went to sleep."
For a moment, Castiel just freezes. But then he leans into it, bringing up his hands to Dean's hair.
So, Cas might not even be aware. Still.
to die."
"So what do you say?", Charlie asks in an expectant voice. "Would you like to be my handmaiden again?"
Dean stares back, gulps.
"Huh?", Sam looks up. "No. Not officially, at least."
"Yes?", Jack asks.
When Cas just stares at Dean instead of responding, Sam chimes in, muttering "Dean, dude, is that your way of telling him that you love him back? Because if it is, it is hell of a rude way to do that."
"Way to go", Dean says, chuckling.
About you or anyone else. You think he'll put you to sleep out of the goodness of his heart? Think again. ... On the other hand, if you let us go, Jack will take over Chuck's power and be able to put you to sleep. ... How about that?"
it, it should have come, shouldn't it?"
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did. -
"They're all gone", Dean explains. "Bobby, Charlie. Everyone except Sam and Jack is gone." He sighs. "Chuck is upping his game, it seems." He wonders why he is so calm about it. He should be despairing about it, should he not? Then he glances up at the figure in a trenchcoat standing in front of him.
I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live. -
"Yes", Dean agrees.
, Dean thinks.
Cas frowns, thinking. "A bit. Not very much though."
He hugs Charlie tightly.
I can't hide"
Yaz moves closer to her. "Do you see him on the displays? I... I don't see anything", she whispers.
