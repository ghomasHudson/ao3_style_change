Ah, so Moriarty did want him for something. And now he knew that, but there was still some information to wrest out of these two imbecciles. Guessing from how quickly Ern had corrected the other man, Sherlock guessed that he would hate to be wrong. Now, time to prove it that theory.
A flash of a memory came in the musty darkness. The flat. Sherlock's head against John's leg, humming when John would run his fingers through his hair as he worked on his blog. Contentment. Peace.
"Pull over, I said. Man has to relieve himself. I say let the other one out too, why not? Not like they're going anywhere but the house."
"You had better watch it now, Sherly," Freddy growled. "I have a gun in my pocket."
John was not in the car with him. He was lead into another car, that much he could tell. He supposed it was a security measure, but also a ploy to isolate them both from each other.
There are footsteps behind him. John is a little ahead, but he can see a pursuer close behind, and he can see him loading his gun.
"Ten! Nine! Eight ---"
He spotted John close by, standing behind a tree. He took note of four men, two armed with small handguns. The road was busy but not crowded. Through the trees he could see the faint outline of a cow pasture.
Would they ever make it back to the flat? Back to their lives again? No, he couldn't have those thoughts, not now, stupid sentimentalities that got in the way of what he needed to do.
"And what if we don't get out?" John asked.
He could practically feel the cogs turning in the man's head. Both of them. Thinking for them must be such hard work.
"Terribly sorry, if I ask, where are we going?" Sherlock asked. "I'd like to be home, see, I'm expecting someone at my flat today, I'd really rather not keep them waiting."
"Don't you try any funny business with us." He sneered. "We have the guns." He laughed and threw the rope away. "Now be quick about it."
One of the lackeys up front decided he wanted to speak. " Ey, would you look at that, eh, Freddy?"
And they're off, feet digging into the ground as they take off, shouts of alarm sounding behind them. He is flying, panic digging into his chest as his feet pound the dirt, cracking sticks and leaves so loudly he can hear it ringing in his ears. He is so used to being the predator, stalking out a mastermind with finesse and ease. Now he truly knows what it is like to be the prey.
"Thirty seconds!" Freddy called.
"Boss wants him alive, Fred. You had better not do that." Ern said.
"No, he promised me my money. Showed me it all before I went to take you. Now, I've said enough, you stay quiet." Freddy growled.
"You get one more minute!" The man called.
Focus, Sherlock, focus. You'll see him soon.
"Pull over." Freddy said into what seemed to be a radio.
"Resisted. Seriously, we don't have much time, what is your plan here?" John asked in a panicked whisper.
"Seven! Six!"
"Ninety, as your teachers never saw fit to mention to you. Really, is that the best thing that could go through your head, or are you just that stupid?"
He lunged towards the gunman, knocking him to the ground, miraculously. Unaware, John kept running.
"One!"
"Terribly sorry, sirs, just a few more moments, please." Sherlock called.
Sherlock mouthed the number five.
Ah, so this was a paid job.
He took a place beside John, pretending to be doing his business. John wasn't doing anything, just standing with his hands clasped in front of him. As if he was waiting.
It's not really a surprise to Sherlock when the hoods are thrown over their heads that day, at least, not to him. Given the circumstances, investigating a case against him, a run in with the boss was sure to happen at some point. Moriarty always had a flair for dramatics, and this kidnapping wasn't going to throw him off.
So that tactic wouldn't last much longer.
John caught him in the eyes, expression lined with trust.
Of course, Sherlock didn't know where they were or where they were going due to the hood, but he did know some other things. They were, of course, in a car. It was going thirty-nine miles per hour, and it was a nicer car, possibly a Mercedes due to the feel of the leather seats. He had no doubt that the car had tinted windows. There were two men at the front of the car, and one of them held the gun.
But I
Sherlock flexes his hands, willing himself to speak, utterly baffled but determined to explain himself:
And the funny thing about Lestrade is that, for all his buffoonery, in a very real way he represents the proper English gentleman. When Holmes isn’t busy destabilizing Lestrade’s self-image he is confident, assertive, and takes the lead. His manner (when he feels in control) is dignified and polite. He has the socially sanctioned “correct” opinions about gender and class and English superiority. And granted much of this is a facade which interferes with his accomplishing his job justly and well, but it has been sanctioned by the symbol of the police cap and the power of the Inspector. He has been chosen as the protector of a society whose cultural ideal he (superficially) embodies.
“Yes,” John’s voice actually squeaks, and Sherlock giggles again before hesitating, almost doubting again in the face of the momentous request he is about to make:
) and Sherlock has to keep him far enough away so that he doesn’t see, and as Sherlock dials his number he thinks,
and suddenly he knows that sometime during the past frantic minutes he had ceased to merely cycle John’s words through his mind and begun to declare them in return.
At that, John turns toward Stamford with quirked lips, a knowing and grateful smile. As he does so, the tension born of having his long-disguised adoration on display and waiting for Greg’s next barb or revelation momentarily fades from him. And for the first time in their acquaintance, the falling mask reveals purest joy beneath.
Stamford felt himself smiling. “Someone would. They’d just have to be interesting.”
And it would be easier if Mycroft wasn't the only one who seems to regard Sherlock's life as secondary to the Work. John is used to being significantly more invested than Sherlock in the business of keeping the man alive. Much as it isn’t his preference, he can live with being the substitute for Sherlock's survival instinct. Or at least, he can when Sherlock isn’t running away from him. To John, being cut off this way feels like Sherlock declaring both that the current problem is more important than John's partnership, and that it is more important than Sherlock's survival. The former conclusion hurts John deeply; but the latter terrifies him.
“No!” At Sherlock’s ill-placed exclamation, John jerks his wrist away, and Sherlock hurries on: “you don’t understand!”
Later that day they went out on a case, and John acted as if everything was normal and Sherlock tried to do the same, (that was the day Sherlock said
And then John drops to his knees and takes Sherlock’s numbly unresponsive hand in both of his own. And John’s voice is no longer angry, but neither has it lost any of its desperate force.
That was a strange thought. "The worst"? Obviously Moriarty and the maybe dying part is the worst; alienating John is just a necessary side effect. Stupid brain. He clearly hasn’t filed all those emotions correctly and his mind is misinterpreting them.
But here’s the thing about being pleasant, steady, and inoffensive: people let their guard down around you. That’s not to say that they impart their deepest secrets; they tend to assume you wouldn’t be able to do them much good there. They simply work rather less hard at disguising the boredom or the melancholy or the annoyance they happen to be feeling in the moment, because your easy manner suggests that you are unlikely to judge and even more unlikely to gossip, and your very boring ordinariness keeps them from being overly concerned about your good opinion, anyway.
He had hoped they were done with this charade—ever since the drugs incident in Baskerville Sherlock had been so much better about not cutting John off in the middle of the work. Sure, he still gets distracted and forgets or just doesn't bother to communicate essential details; but he no longer involves John through deceit or (intentionally) abandons him for the climax. John had suspected—or at least, hoped—that this was Sherlock’s way of saying ‘sorry.’
At the time, Stamford found the whole thing rather ridiculous. For the first time in his life he’d taken it into his head that he’d like to play matchmaker, and then had been all but commissioned to do so, and yet all he could do was sit on a park bench and think that even if Sherlock wasn’t Sherlock, Stamford is Stamford, and that was sufficient to put the nail in the coffin of this endeavor before it began.
Yet here I was, having lived with a fellow-madman for less than a week, and my facades were crumbling. I was badgering my flatmate into making an impromptu trip to Sussex because an interesting murder had been committed, assuming my presence would be wanted, and reciting train schedules as dutifully as good little boys recite the Bible. My lifelong disguise was evaporating, and the terror of being discovered at long last was being countered by laughter.
About a month later they did go out for drinks. John’s eyes met Stamford’s, and they were empty. Stamford clasped his hand silently and ordered them beer. They sat in the bar for an hour. Not speaking. Not hiding.
Also, normally I won’t write more than one meta per episode, but I feel their first meeting and first case merit separate treatments.
something had happened—that first time he told himself that it was alright, that he just needed to trust Sherlock. But of course he remembered the cabby, the speckled pill hovering before those sensitive lips, and he knew that he would indeed trust Sherlock with the protection of almost anything of real value, anything at all except himself.
“You know exactly what I mean, Sherlock.”
But that story will come later.
—Sherlock waits until John has taken one step beyond him so that he doesn’t have to see his face, then he darts his hand back and gently grasps John’s wrist.
Sherlock has been watching John ever since he lay his head on his arms, hiding his face. He's hardly even been thinking, just watching. Memorizing. It’s not much of an angle, but he’ll take what he can get. Not that he allows himself to ask how on earth he can stare at an objectively uninteresting mess of sandy-blond hair and the uncomfortable curve of a spine for thirty minutes without an ounce of boredom.
That morning, John had yelled at him. Sherlock had been careless, distracted, he’d misjudged the hydrogen/chlorine ratios and his compound had exploded in the kitchen, flying glass narrowly missing his face. That’s when John started shouting, and at first Sherlock was angry because didn’t John understand that he needed the work and sometimes things would go wrong? Yes he’d been careless and made a mistake, but he didn’t deserve to be shouted at. But then John said, “if you keep this up you’re going to make this flat unlivable” and anger was forgotten in fear, because John couldn’t leave, not again, please no. Then John cut himself off and stormed out, and Sherlock turned away and said nothing, knowing that he looked cold and unrepentant and that wasn’t good; but if he showed any emotion at all he would show too much and that would be worse.
Still, John isn’t exactly in a relaxed state of mind himself, and his responses are . . . less then gentle. When Sherlock declares him “Useless!” and for the first time in their friendship John has to restrain the sudden urge to bite back “Freak,” just to see if he can ring out proof that Sherlock cares for
“my dear fellow, I have sublime confidence in your ability to extricate us from any predicament in which my rashness may place us.”
The entire 1954 Sherlock Holmes series is available on YouTube here:
After his initial start upon finding John Watson sitting on the couch in his apartment that night, Stamford realized that he really wasn’t surprised. That John should have added “housebreaking” to his considerable list of skills over the past years seemed only natural. Stamford spoke first.
It is also just as well, because if he had been standing he’d have quickly found himself seated again when John bursts back through the doors approximately 39 seconds after he left. And this isn’t the obedient soldier John who entered twelve hours ago. This John is seething and not—in any sense of the word—compliant.
“You are correct. I am not cutting myself off from the people I care about, because I do not have people I care about.”
Then John is back (
and he is not at all what John expected.
“Sherlock,” John snaps.
It hurts.
Sherlock has no answer, none that will sound reasonable at any rate. Not to a man whose female companions are as easily acquired as a new toothbrush. The dossier on the Tsvetkovs did not mention their involvement in anything like human trafficking, but the broader SIC certainly dabbles.
“Excellent,” Mycroft says, his tone like a cat who is waking from a languid nap in the sun. “I’ll alert the local extraction team. Where can they pick you up?”
The boy looks ruined, cheeks flushed and eye makeup running. But he also looks like everything
, but it'll do.
He lies on his back and stares at the ceiling for another fifteen minutes or so. Then he hears a small sound from beyond the door and knows its time to go. He forcefully rubs his forehead and lets out a long, slow breath.
Sherlock sighs, petulantly.
? There are too many variables, and this is not the real John. That smile will not mean anything more than Sherlocks’ subconscious trying to tell him something. Trying to drive him towards some conclusion. The clock is ticking.
It’s moments like this when Sherlock misses him like a limb; misses him like he misses his violin and shortbread biscuits and Ms Hudson’s cup of tea. He would hesitate to call it
Then, the silence.
“No.”
Yana remains slumped against Mihael’s side and doesn’t respond, though her fingers twitch where they rest in her lap. Her hair is hanging heavy in front of her face, obscuring her eyes from view.
have said. Thinking about it, Sherlock would probably read the crossed-out lines too. Whatever. More importantly, Sarah had come
the boy for doing that to him.
"Shut up, Sherlock!" interrupted John, who needed to get some things off his chest. "Just so you know once and for all, my name is John. J-o-h-n. And right now, I don't will either call you a freak or tell you to piss off. I just want to tell you that if all of this is true, your brain is fucking amazing." he looked at the smarter boy, expecting a snob answer regarding ordinary life forms in general and stupid humans in particular.
I would really like to
"Very good, John." Sherlock looked at him and paused. "How the hell did you know that? I didn't give you the medical report! There's no way you can possibly know about the lungs and the heart problem just by looking at the pictures!"
"Yes, well, music bores me to death. I'd start shooting the walls if I didn't have something to distract me." Sherlock answered. John sat next to him, leaning on the chimney as well. "This place is nice. How did you get here in the first place?" John asked, genuinely curious.
"Wow your brain! How did you even! Seriously man, why are you not in Uni already? For all I know, you could be doing rocket science or being a consultant to the Queen or something! Just, wow"
"I'm not following you, I'm walking to my house. You're not the centre of the universe, you know. I sincerely hope that we're not neighbours, cos I really don't want to keep meeting your annoying face on the street", he answered harshly.
Sherlock spent the next day at school purposefully ignoring John. He was still angry at the other boy. It would've been more dramatic if John had actually tried to talk to him, so that Sherlock could've used his best expression of disdain on him. Even though he expected some kind of apology from the always amenable John, it turned out that the other boy planned nothing of the kind. Every time Sherlock glanced at John sitting at the back of the classroom, waiting for a disgruntled glance in his direction, the other boy was looking critically at a sheet of paper on his desk, or writing furiously on it, completely ignoring everything around him and not paying attention to either English class or Geography after that.
On the other hand, in Music class, Mrs. Colin just needed to hear Sherlock play his violin once in a while, let herself be reduced to tears and give him A+ for the rest of the year. Easy.
So I'm leaving this here *anxiety attack*. It's possible that I continue writing on them, since the plot is fairly out of nowhere, but I think I'll wait for feedback first. Hope you enjoy!
Sherlock couldn't process what he was seeing at first. Why would John bother? Why was he doing that? He had never received an apology letter before. He usually just got insults and afterwards was told to sod off or something similar.
"Let's see what is keeping our dear Watson, who I believed to be a good student, of joining us both physically
Okay, so this is my first post in the Archive and I'm really nervous about it. I keep writing some random ficlets (till now only Johnlock, but I'm more and more working myself into some serious Stucky material) and don't know where to put them.
If it was worth something, there would now be two sitting on that roof.
"I'm curious, when did you put it in my bag? It must've been either in arts or music, right?" John laughed at the other boy's inquisitiveness. Of course, it'd bug him that something escaped his notice.
"And you are a waste of valuable oxygen", came the answer from the other side of the room.
To his utter dismay, he hadn't really acknowledged her today, too preoccupied with writing that letter in a Sherlock-friendly and comprehensible way. Which means, crossing out a lot of stuff he would
"Certainly looked like it." Mycroft scoffed whilst walking out of the room again.
Update 2k19  d o n e
"Say whaat?" John blurted, sounding like a 13-year old girl. He cleared his throat and tried again "I mean, what makes you think that?"
I have decided to take this story up again and am currently working on correcting language errors and trying to fill up plot holes that 16-year-old me didn't notice. Being in the Sherlock fandom nowadays is probably very different than in the post-Reichenbach fever times, but it's still fun to be in it <3 Enjoy!
John’s interest spiked to a new high, Sherlock’s snottiness all but forgotten. He had whipped out his phone to google “Wills family”, and promptly reading up their entire Wikipedia article. “Wow, a 1977 Doctor Who episode had even been filmed in one of their factories in Bristol Sherlock, isn’t that cool?” He looked at the other boy. “It’s a show about a Gallifreyan time traveller, in case you haven’t heard of it.” John expected Sherlock to be oblivious to anything related with pop-culture that wouldn’t help him in solving cases or showing teachers that they’re dumber than him. Sherlock smirked, and stood up.
Sherlock was looking amused at his outburst. "Well, first of all, Miss Hooper had said that the case was "easy". That doesn't sound right to me. Why would some perfectly respectable, middle-aged man turn up dead in some alley if there wasn't something bigger behind it?  Second, he died in August. But he had had the flu before dying. Who gets the flu in August, John? Statistically speaking, perfectly healthy people don't get the flu in the middle of August. Or die from it afterwards, for that matter. So yes, I think it was murder."
with a healthy undertow of
) might have discovered his plan during the past 39 seconds, Sherlock flashes back to Baskerville and John pulling rank on a number of duly cowed officers.
This episode features Holmes at his best, but I was initially bothered by the fact that Watson spends the first half of the episode being rather stupider than normal. Now, characters needn’t be intelligent to be loved and lovable, and the fact that Holmes and Watson take their turns being played for fools is frankly one of the strengths of the series. But given the history of adaptations erasing Watson’s capabilities I get touchy when he is being underestimated, so when in the span of 10 minutes he has fallen for a transparent lie from Lestrade, mocked Holmes’s experiments, taken 24 seconds to process a perfectly straightforward sentence, and flat-out forgotten how bullets work, I start getting defensive.
“Come, hang with us. Indulge yourself.”
“As a child your hands would be small enough to hold a spanner in hard to reach places. Your wrists bear the faint but distinct marking of chemical burns. You see there is a distinct difference to the effect that battery acid will have on skin, I once wrote an entire…”
“Who’d want me for a flatmate?” a twisted parody of the old suggestion of a smile.
Besides, it is what happened there that finally snapped me out of my deuced inattentiveness. I am not fond of violence, but I value courage and skill and decency quite highly. So when Watson didn't flinch upon being held at gunpoint, nullified the threat with quick efficiency, and then instead of employing his apparently considerable skills against the new flatmate who had nearly gotten him killed, turned to me with mussed hair and a smile that was almost shy in its pleased eagerness for approval, I was lost before I knew I had begun.
) has been wheeled, curiously ignored by the hospital staff. His head is between his knees, and he focuses his weak energy on trying not to see, think, feel, putting every thing on hold until he knows for certain; but he sees nothing except the bloody, limp, empty shell of the most vibrantly alive man he has ever known, and he hears nothing but those words, “It’s a trick. Just a magic trick.” Sherlock had spoken them once and John had dismissed them entirely, believing them to be part of the nonsense about Sherlock being a fake, but then Sherlock had repeated the words, and there was something so urgent in his tone that all at once it gave birth to a desperate, angry hope.
beloved.”
Freezing in the doorway, Stamford had the unfamiliar experience of being quite literally incapacitated by emotion. Delight, confusion, dismay, shock, and an unexpected rush of anger on John’s behalf coalesced in a single thought which Stamford rarely allowed himself:
“What? No! You were drugged that time, I know you wouldn’t—no, I was afraid you’d leave, that I was too much, so when you went out I came up here and I was smelling your bed because I can’t let that smell disappear and then I heard you coming and panicked,” by this time Sherlock is grinning, and to John’s evident consternation he actually giggles, “and I hid under your bed.”
Sherlock snorted derisively. “Really Stamford, who’d want me for a flatmate?”
Heart pounding (
An untracked expanse of time later, eyes turned.
• Nothing more to say…
My theory, counterintuitive though it may seem, is that Lestrade is the sort of man Watson believes he ought to be. I think there is evidence that this Watson, regardless of his actual personality and inclinations, thinks he ought to be a traditionally proper English gentleman. Throughout the show he continually protests Holmes’s eccentricities, and yet far from meaningfully attempting to abate or escape them, he not infrequently joins in wholeheartedly. To me, this seems indicative of a pattern: in this series Holmes and Watson are both eccentric madmen, but whereas Holmes is perfectly comfortable with the fact, Watson has put effort into appearing ‘normal’ and ‘correct’, and periodically struggles to maintain or reclaim that image—both in the eyes of others and himself.
And so if I experienced a measure of distress the morning before the ballerina case when Holmes offhandedly designated females the more fascinating sex, I was ready to understand it merely as annoyance at the possibility of having to re-adopt that particular facade. And if I watched his interactions with females a little more closely that I was normally wont that day, I believed I was merely attempting to gage whether or how much I must adjust my own behavior in the future to avoid … well, in all frankness, at the time I don’t think I could have clearly identified just what I was so eager to hide.
My parents, you see, were decent and affectionate folk, but rather firmly attached to social approbation. As such, my education was as much concerned with ‘proper’ behavior as mental development. And having discovered how much more kindly the world treats the conformist, I learned my lessons and played my role. It was not so painful as one might imagine; but neither was it patriotism alone that drew me into the army.
“You … were smelling my bed.”
• So. Much. More.
“OKAY? In what universe—what were you—how could you think—Jesus, Sherlock!”
Following the title sequence (a simple and heartwarming scene of Holmes and Watson walking as close as possible down the street followed by a still of their coats hanging together next to a lamp), the episode begins with Watson gazing cheerily out a cab window while his voiceover narrates his return from war and pleasure at being back in London. It is clear at once that the series intends to elide the depression and ill-health that burdens Watson in canon—a passing mention of “long and difficult times” and the trials of war are all but forgotten.
John lays down beside him.
All things considered, the resemblance is uncanny.
The boy's eyes are drawn to it like a moth to a flame. Then he tenses and looks suspicious.
Sherlock says nothing. He flings himself dramatically onto the bed. Yana startles but does not otherwise move. It’s another minute before he realizes that she is shaking.
“She won’t,” John says quietly.
John jerks, pushes his hand down, watching the pale back descend with every press, the knobs of the boy's spine standing out in sharp relief. Everything sounds wet. He pushes harder, lifts his hips higher, teeth clamping and feet straining. He's being pulled apart from the inside out, a soldier reduced to a quivering, pathetic, desperate mess only the way pale pretty boys with incomprehensible eyes are able.
" John starts to say, then breaks off in a hiss as the boy presses gentle, wet pressure against the cloth, licking up and down with an expression on his face like he just did something to win the upper hand and he knows it. John's hands fist in the bed sheets.
“Do you?”
Yana says nothing, but the subtle tightening in her jaw is answer enough. He imagines she has played through several scenarios in her mind, weighed them each in turn and dismissed some out of hand. Given the severity of his crimes against her, it’s likely she’s latched onto one of great violence. Not some simpering poisoner, this girl. She’s envisioned one which will cause him great suffering, that that will coalesce with her standing over him in his final moments as he watches helplessly, succumbing to death and seeing that she is the one who sent him there.
When she’s left the room and closed the door quietly behind her, he lets himself slump over and fall backward on the bed. He stares at the ceiling.
He stops.
He is all at once so exhausted he can hardly keep his eyes open and terrified of closing them, afraid that if he does he may never wake up. This is the matter, one of many, that his brother and all the rest could never get through limited little minds: not all substances are created equal. Hypocrites, the lot of them. So eager to sit and sip their Glenlivt out of crystal glasses whilst presuming to lecture Sherlock on the merits of sobriety
“After,” he says, rolling it around on his tongue. “After, I will help you escape this place.”
"John."
He doesn’t need to give more detail than that.
He walks by her to kitchen counter and tears off the corner of an old takeaway advert. Some rummaging in a drawer unearths a pen, which he then uses to scribble a phone number on the page. She sets the car keys down and cautiously accepts the bit of paper from him.
I would do it all over again in a heartbeat.
Know what was fake?
One of Mycroft’s minions, undercover, a set-up of a bad job of dealing counterfeit RPK-74M’s, meant to establish his cover. Fake bullet, fake blood pack, fake drugs, fake fake fake fake –
They wait for what feels like forever, Yana and Sherlock sitting side by side on the gaudy quilt while the sun sinks ever lower on the horizon. Sherlock is a tall man but not a large one, especially after almost a year on the run, and the drug haze has almost receded entirely by the time they hear raised voices from the sitting room, followed not long thereafter by the sound of the door slamming. Something heavy crashes into the wall – a thrown beer bottle, most likely – and then the television clicks on at an alarmingly loud volume.
“You all right, love?” the young man asks. The
John grunts, twitches, tries to warn. It's almost uncomfortable, the way his hips dig into the edge of the bed. His eyes are half-lidded in pleasure, shoulders hunching forward while his hand presses down, faster and faster, wetter and wetter, the little nose puffing short breaths against his belly, and god, he hadn't even noticed the freckles -
It was worth it. To never see John again except like this, to keep him safe.
Time passes slowly and in an instant. When he comes back to himself – minutes later? hours? – Anton and his wife have begun to kiss, slowly at first, but soon they fall into a languid rhythm, their bodies twisting together in an amorous sprawl that eats up two-thirds of the sofa. Anton begins to part the folds of his wife’s low-cut dress. He reaches inside with one big hand to fondle her breast and she squirms. Less than a foot away, Mihael seems oblivious. His girlfriend shifts uncomfortably – embarrassed, aroused, hard to tell, he was never good at telling the difference anyway
Stamford restrained an entirely inopportune urge to laugh.
And as the weeks passed, there were occasional glimpses of something beyond the performance. Like the time he heard Sherlock mutter ‘damn’ over a failed experiment with an undercurrent of genuine sorrow. Or the day he glanced over to see Sherlock looking at his phone with an expression that could only be described as
and Guy Ritchie Watsons. I haven’t decided the extent to which I read canon Watson in a similar manner, but the potential for such a reading is there in the way he paints himself as a deeply normal man while engaging in highly abnormal behavior.
Sherlock’s head snapped around, mouth falling open slightly, and—
• Like I said, this show doesn’t take itself too seriously. It is unabashedly delighted with its characters and its world, and if you’re looking for angst, this isn’t the place—although be prepared to be smacked with a rush of emotion when you least expect it.
Stamford felt his face softening with compassion and a tinge of fear for the man who could hold that depth of pain his his eyes. And he didn’t have to be told. The detective had not been welcomed home.
John keeps talking for perhaps another thirty seconds, something about “I care” and “they care” and “can’t leave,” and then he is charging out the door at full speed.
“Shut up, shut up,
All in all, their first two scenes together are simple enough. And yet there is something masterful about them, for they tell you just about everything you need to know about this iteration of the characters: that this Holmes is capable of the rudeness and disconnection adaptations often highlight, but rather than heartlessness its primary source is an overabundance of absent-minded enthusiasm; that Watson is decidedly more inclined to push against Holmes’s actions than he presents himself as being in the canon, but that he ultimately loves and is willing to trust the wild dance of Holmes’s proceedings; and that they are instantly, endlessly fond of one another.
And the fear and the smell overwhelmed him until his genius brain betrayed him, as in days past he had almost wished it would but
Any other time he could have manufactured a thousand excuses for being found in John’s room, but today he froze, terrified anew at his lapse in thought, and with blank mind and no time he convulsively flattened the sheets and slid under the bed.

His defense mechanisms had shifted, Stamford realized. Or perhaps he simply no longer had the energy for his old ones. Every now and then he seemed to be making a vague attempt at his old cheery demeanor, but all he could really manage was straight-backed tight-lipped stoicism. He would not meet Stamford’s eye for more than a moment. He transparently wished to get away, to be alone. Stamford wondered whether the very fact that John had allowed Stamford to see him in the past made him appear all the more threatening now.
just loud enough for John to hear the sound but not the words; the day Sherlock made him feel like an idiot by telling him he hadn’t heard anything after all), but those words—
It’s true that Watson has his moments of buffoonery—as early as episode 5 the poor man is convinced he has twice been accosted by a corporeal ghost. But this show isn’t one to take itself too seriously, and everyone—Holmes included—has their bouts of foolishness. Far more significant is the fact that, episode after episode, Watson earns his place: whether with his physical capability, groundedness, or scientific/medical expertise, Watson is consistently invaluable.
After John leaves, Sherlock doesn’t move. No need until John is away from the building. Which is just as well, because it would have been hard to move when
Stamford smiled.
Returning to the episode: although the case in this episode bears no resemblance to A Study in Scarlet, it does closely replicate Holmes and Watson’s first meeting, moving from Watson’s reconnection with Stamford through to Watson’s list of Holmes’s fields of knowledge and ignorance. As for the dynamics of their meeting, if you have not seen the series I urge you to stop reading and watch minutes 3.33–7.44, because in my eyes their meeting is magic. Holmes is wrapped up in his discovery of a test for identifying hemoglobin and begins regaling Watson with his delight the moment he enters. His sporadic intermingling of greetings with rambling about his findings is hardly polite, yet it is impossibly endearing insofar as it springs from what appears to be an equally genuine delight in his discovery and the stranger in front of him. Besides, the initially scattered proceedings do add a level of weight to the moment when Holmes stills, stands very close, and gazes intently at Watson while explaining his deductions.

You see, in these first episodes there is an utter freedom to their affections; an unadulterated delight in one another’s company that is free from the anxieties they must feel upon realizing they are falling for their flatmate of unknown orientation in an society where such affections are dangerous. Yes, Watson is frequently exasperated and wonders what he got himself into; yes Holmes is so distracted by his experiments and his cases that he almost fails to notice how deeply integrated Watson has already become in his life and heart. But the prevailing emotion is delight. This is the honeymoon stage; this is the dance. There are troubles ahead before the final joys, but for now there is freedom.
While calm, Sherlock decides it would be beneficial to catalogue his emotions. They are being . . . invasive. He will use his current stability to take each in hand and put it in its place.
I don’t have much to add to what I said in part 1. However, if there is a moment in which Holmes begins to fall in love, it is when Watson rescues them from the actual murderer. Obviously Holmes liked Watson enormously from the start, but when Holmes realizes he has led this poor innocent man into mortal danger, only to have said ‘poor innocent’ neutralize the threat with quick efficiency, he looks at the man like … well, like he's really rather smitten.
A short, sharp nasty bark of a laugh. Anton has pulled his mouth away from his wife’s chest long enough to cast an inebriated but forceful punch at his brother’s arm.

And then he's moving, slinking his pale skinny body down John's like a coiled snake, hands pressed to John's legs spayed wide, pushing up so his fingers rest on the juncture between thigh and groin. He looks up at John as he reaches for the zipper, fingers teasing across the hardening bulge and, god, it's all too much. John closes his eyes. He reminds himself that he isn't doing anything wrong here, not really, other than the obvious. This boy makes his living by fulfilling the fantasies of men not half as old as John, not half as generous. Whatever scars will be made from this encounter are John's to bear, alone, with as much history and conviction and love as the knife that wields them.
“She won’t be taking him head-on,” Sherlock corrects.
Mycroft falls silent. He won’t offer what he knows Sherlock really wants.
She won’t. Sherlock can tell that much by how she is reacting. Another man might feel quite differently in the face of a young woman in such a terrible position, but Sherlock has always thought that pity is possibly the most useless of emotions. He always rather favored action.
Inside the flat are two sons of an SIC éminence grise, one’s wife, and the other’s girlfriend. Both men are accomplished killers with several murders to their name, foul tempered and prone to unpredictable fits of violence.
"Hmmm." The boy takes the zipper and pulls it down. He reaches inside and grasps John's pants, starts tugging them down. "Do you want to give me one?"
a man stands and smokes a cigarette.
“Stubborn git,” John huffs under his breath.
It occurs to Sherlock then that there is something else about Yana that does not quite fit with the frightened-child theory he’d been harboring, uncanny ability to parse accents aside. The way she watches him, her gaze never faltering. She’s calmed slightly now that she doesn’t perceive him as an immediate risk, but she hasn’t let her guard down entirely. She is smart, and there is simply too much awareness in that one eye of hers. The placidity beneath the storm, a calculation, the gleam that comes from the fervent dedication of one who is committed to –

John expression is exasperated. He sighs, like he can’t believe he has to say it aloud. “You’re not going to sleep with her, are you?”
, John reminds himself, because there is no way this creature is as older than eighteen, nineteen possibly, though like his...friend, he too wears a face of one who will always be mistaken for younger than he is. It’s the eyes, John thinks. One never gets past the first impression, and a reasonable (sane) man would hesitate to go back for seconds in case they started looking – really
“What is your name,” he asks Yana in thick, slurry Bulgarian.
She says nothing but the disbelief is palpable.
"You alright, love?" Other than his face, the boy is as suave as ever, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. John nods.
Emotions are like overripe cheese, offensive and overwhelming on the palate. Not his area.

Inside the bedroom is just as nondescript and modern-cliché bland as the sitting room. The lack of furnishings puts all the attention on the bed, which is made up with a garish red quilt. It has the vibe of an action sequence about to unfold, blood sacrifice on an altar.
Sherlock tears his eyes away from the vision of John. Reluctantly.
There are slight differences to what John remembers, of course. His hair is shorter, for one, shorn closer to the scalp, curls packed tight to his skull. They bounce a bit when he twists his head to the side, that long neck pulled taught. His lips aren’t as full, mouth not quite as wide. But that smile is a devious one, and that’s all that really matters.
“I will give you this because I am generous,” Mihael is saying. Sherlock looks up just in time to see Yana, towering on skinny legs and six-inch heels like a newborn foal. Mihael shoves her in the back and she stumbles forward, barely missing the table and landing with a hard thump in Sherlock’s lap. His arms come up reflexively, to shove her away or hold her he isn’t immediately sure. Her head is close enough that he must crane his neck down to look at her. Her eyes are squeezed shut.
Sherlock’s mouth turns up in a small smile.
John swallows, brings his hand up and cups the back of the boy's head, runs his fingers through the dark curls, moving him so he looks right into those eyes. Not quite as brilliant, not quite as
safehouse and stay with them while they wait for a trusted SIC contact to come and retrieve the footage. The waiting has been like the long, slow diminuendo of a symphony; his hands practically ache from tuning the strings, and anticipation has curled itself a ball in his belly and set his nerves aflame. His fingers itch, tensing as they near the crescendo: the final violent, climactic, loud finale.
"No. Thank you."
Sherlock knows suddenly, like he knows chemistry and London’s seedy underbelly, that Mihael is erect under his trousers.

For a moment everything had cleared—one glorious moment when he thought he had managed it, thought he could save John and Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade and have time to solve the impossible enigma of those three words—and then Moriarty had blown his own brains out, and Sherlock hadn’t seen it coming, has been too
“I’m sorry, by the way,” John adds.
• 20:17–21:36: Honestly, few scenes better encapsulate this iteration of the duo than Holmes proposing illegal means of investigation and Watson objecting every step of the way without once raising a finger to stop Holmes or remove himself from the situation.
Now John momentarily considers chasing after Sherlock, trying to follow him; but it’s no good. No one knows London better than Sherlock, and he is quite capable of losing John if he is determined. Perhaps it would be better to search his common haunts or—

Fifteen minutes later they were seated in Regents Park with ceramic coffee cups, and it was transparently clear that John Watson was not fine.

The revelation comes with less relief than Sherlock expected, because that means it's TIME and there's no excuse for delay, no need to run back through Baker Street and be sure he’s absorbed every detail. So he slides his fingers from the cold countertop and turns, ensuring as he does that John's attention is fixed elsewhere (
I confess that when it comes to Holmes stories I tend to neglect the cases in favor of examining character and relationship dynamics. Certainly I didn’t think I had anything interesting to say about the case in this episode apart from the ways it continues to reveal aspects of this Holmes and Watson’s relationship. But as I watched it again, I realized that I had nearly missed out on one of the best parts of the episode. For although this case is not in itself especially compelling, its framing contextualizes Holmes and Watson as not merely crime-solvers, but as defenders of the innocent and the unheard.
And so much for dignity.
“No.”

“No worries.”
Despite how little anyone except Molly Hooper, the new mortician who Sherlock belittled as much as anyone but tolerated more than most, actually saw of the pair, within a fortnight lunchtime gossip moved from impassioned discussions of whether the arrogant detective could possibly love and be loved, to bemused acknowledgement that, feasible or not, it was most certainly the case.
The observation that prompted my re-evaluation of Watson’s behavior was realizing that in every instance his slowness is directly related to his following Lestrade’s lead or being more focused on Lestrade than Holmes. This is a curious thing, particularly since I think it would be far too simplistic to infer that Watson is simply looking for someone to follow and imitate. After all, even though Holmes has a deep effect on him, Watson frequently challenges Holmes’s conclusions and never adopts his manner. So of all people, why would Watson choose to imitate Lestrade, a man who is frequently the butt of the joke and at times seems to care about his own image more than the justice he has been given the authority and responsibility to protect?
John spends the next twenty minutes asking questions, trying to stumble on the right prompt. But Sherlock responds without epiphanies, only insults. It isn’t altogether unusual, but these feel different. They’re calm, not spoken as if in the midst of frustration. And they’re more targeted—not the generalized “idiot” Sherlock usually opts for. Almost as if he isn’t simply blowing off steam this time. Almost as if he means it.
As will become apparent, in this fic I am writing Watson as gay, not bi. As I general rule I definitely read Watson as bi, so I hesitated over this choice. However, in the 1954 adaptation Watson's statements of romantic/physical attraction to women are so entirely performative, and he is so deeply uncomfortable with actual interactions that imply romantic involvement with women, that reading him as gay felt truer to this series.
“Sherlock”—voice tight—“you know you don’t have to—”
Stamford was too pragmatic to feel guilty, exactly, for the loss John was suffering. He was realistic enough to know that a man as scarred and alone as John had been that day in Regents park might not have lived long without a mad detective to bring him to life, and humble enough to know that he was in no position to judge whether John would have been better off never knowing the detective. But while he didn’t feel guilty, he did feel … involved.
Through the plodding ups and downs of the next two years, the doctor and the detective were a periodic source of satisfaction. Sherlock spent rather less time in the lab, and Stamford found that he missed him; but when the detective did come his still-mercurial manner was alternately tinged with a peace Stamford had never perceived in him and an anxious excess of energy easily attributable to unresolved, erm, tension of a promising sort at home. Periodically the doctor accompanied Sherlock for quickly-resolved visits, and in these instances Stamford felt obliged to quietly vacate the room with the others to avoid gawking at the two of them for the entirety of their visit. But the glimpses he caught—John striding quick and purposeful behind Sherlock, the detective practically glowing with the consciousness of it—were quite sufficient to improve a less-than-stellar day.
It would also be easier if this current separation was more like that one—involuntary on Sherlock's part. Of course, John hadn't known it was involuntary that at the time, but on the third day Sherlock was found bound and guarded in an apparently deserted garage—captured three days ago and starved since then, but not, thank god, tortured. And John was furious with the attackers but equally furious with himself, because how could he be so relieved that his best friend had been captured and starved for three days rather than hiding away of his own volition? But of course John knew the answer—he was relieved because it meant Sherlock hadn't deserted him without a word and maybe he never would; it meant John could still stay by his side and protect him from every attack; it meant they were partners; it meant Sherlock hadn't decided that the Work was more important than John's petrified heart. But now? Now he is doubting everything he'd hoped he had learned that day.
I did have confidence; oh how I did! From the day a highly intelligent and well-trained army doctor moved into my flat and began accompanying me on cases, I felt and behaved as if we were invincible. And if that confidence had been temporarily shaken when I got him held at gunpoint that first night, it was only strengthened a moment later when he took the danger in stride and efficiently nullified the threat.
“Sorry, mate.”
Nonsense. Of course I could and should have been. Seeing through facades is my business, and that crucial morning I was too distracted to take note of the best man I have ever met.
• While I personally find most of this show’s flaws to be part of its charm or at least easily ignored, it does occasionally announce itself as a product of its time in a decidedly unfortunate manner. With one glaring exception it’s treatment of women tends towards the progressive, but I’m afraid I’ve nothing positive to say of its portrayal of race—its glaring whiteness is only occasionally altered by painfully stereotyped side-characters.
] I was suddenly struck by the difference between the character in that book and that of the stage and screen. Here, Holmes was a young man in his thirties, human, gifted, of a philosophic and scholastic bent, but subject to fateful mistakes which stemmed from his overeagerness and lack of experience.” You see, when it comes to interpreting Holmes, Reynolds is one of the good ones.

• 22:41–22:46: I briefly discussed Watson taking out the murderer, but I have to mention this eloquent exchange of looks:
Although he hadn’t consciously noted it, that decision had slotted into place with the others—this is his death, he will control the conditions, and John will have no part in it.
Tentatively, the boring, predictable, trusted man lifted his hand and rested it lightly on his friend’s shoulder.
"Got your message," John says as he strides through the door, and there is a question in his voice. No accusation for Sherlock's sudden desertion, no doubt; just "What do you need? I'm here" (
Last year I discovered a 1954 TV adaption of Sherlock Holmes produced by Sheldon Reynolds and starring Ronald Howard and Howard Crawford, fell irrevocably in love, and promptly hunted down all the meta, gifs, and fic I could find on tumblr. It took about 10 minutes. I moved on to the internet at large—thanks primarily to one website this provided 1.5 hours of bearable material, tops. I dug for fics, which occupied another delightful but troublingly brief hour or so. Five minutes more were devoted to a short blurb in a book about Holmes adaptations, and I found with dismay that I had exhausted my sources.

“Ah.”
So when I gathered my courage and took advantage of some factoids regarding female tigers to make a broad and nonsensical comment about females being more fascinating than males, his noncommittal grunt added considerably to my increasing hope. And if I ignored the fact that my reaction held as much joy as relief, I can at least say for myself that the monumental self-deception of the past month was nearly drawn to its close.
And Mary herself? Her manner was cheery and charming and intelligent and kind, and Stamford could not for the life of him explain why she put him on edge. Then John was called off for an emergency shift at the hospital and Mary stayed a half-hour longer, and she didn’t change. Not one whit.
—“but you do care! Jesus, Sherlock, I’ve built an entire mind bungalow to prove it!”
Stamford wasn’t sure what time the news that the detective was alive had aired that day. But he never checked the news before work, so he wouldn’t have known, anyhow. As a result it was entirely without warning that he walked into the lab to find a dead man leaning over the desk he had once claimed as his own.
That narrative also inspired several chapters of an episode-by-episode fic, which is essentially a more embellished version of that story. It is currently unfinished because I’m bad at completing things, but I’ll attach the relevant chapter of the fic to this section for the episodes that have been finished, and with luck I might even continue the fic as I work on this series—but don’t get your hopes up.
I am aware that this is somewhat long for a single installment of a 41-part meta series. It should naturally become more succinct after the groundwork has been laid, but I'm also still considering taking out the "my story" and/or "highlights" portions. If you have an opinion on the matter I'd love to hear it in the comments. Thanks!!

Subtlety isn’t a highly valued trait in this series, bless it’s heart. As a result, the first episode gives a pretty clear sense of what you’re getting into: the story of a wounded war veteran who has miraculously escaped without physical or psychological scarring, and an enthusiastic-if-distractible chemist/detective who shake hands in a lab, simultaneously think: “I like this human. We shall spend the rest of our lives together,” and proceed to do just that.
Stamford doesn’t like making predictions, but this whole escapade had been a series of actions he wouldn’t normally take, and he would bet hard cash (figuratively speaking) that Sherlock Holmes would be gone on the rugby captain-turned-army doctor by the end of the week. John, as ever, he found harder to read. Certainly he was intrigued, invested, even somewhat trusting; but falling in love? Stamford couldn’t be sure yet, and he grimaced at the possibility of having condemned Sherlock to an unrequited affection—
There’s little to add to this episode, because the joy of their meeting and instant compatibility is so on the surface that it needs no interpretation. But insofar as it is the beginning of a romance, I do have this to say: I’ve never pinpointed a moment when I believe them to have fallen in love—crossing the line between falling and fallen rarely comes with fanfare. However, in my eyes, during those early days neither of them recognized anything romantic in their affections.

And in that moment Sherlock solves the puzzle he had been unable to identify, and he knows the pain of loss, and he understands the shame he had tried to lock so deeply away.
He nods. Which is
The messenger boy’s announcement was not precisely a surprise. Still, there is a world of difference between knowing you are mad and having others see it, so I stiffened at the words. But then Holmes laughed, and in a moment I was chuckling myself, feeling as happy as I had in the whole of my life.

into the bargain? Well that, frankly, was just unnecessary.
But that is wandering from the point; the point is that Stamford is the sort of bloke to whom the occasional student will casually confess that they are bored out of their minds, which will earn them a hum of sympathy and an unspoken increase of affection from their dull chem teacher. He is the sort who understands that his mate would really prefer to be home rather than out drinking, because the man hides his tired expression from the others but doesn’t care if Stamford sees it (at which point Stamford will presently hem and haw something vague about preparing for tomorrow’s class, thereby breaking the ice and allowing the other man to likewise make his excuses and escape, usually without any suspicion of the good turn that has been done him). For a time he was also, to the confusion of all and sundry, the sort with whom the universally well-liked captain of the rugby team chose to spend a good deal of his time while studying at Barts. And while he never vocally confided in Stamford, it is only around him that the captain dropped his cheery facade enough to implicitly admit that he had something to confide. Stamford didn't ask, and the captain continued to appear in his room at all hours to study and occasionally stare blankly into the distance with eyes that were desperately sad.
He starts to lean forward, but Sherlock suddenly realizes he still hasn’t said it, those words he’s been whispering too quietly for years, and he can’t wait, not even for a kiss, and he gently holds John back with hands on his shoulders—
Despite the long Christmas (and post-Christmas) break, I am still working on this series! I wasn't particularly looking forward to writing this chapter, in part because I didn't think I had much to say about it. But a lack of conciseness has never been one of my more pressing issues, and so this chapter became a somewhat lengthy analysis of Watson's character in this series. Enjoy!!

Stamford was perhaps the only one who wasn’t surprised when John asked him to be his best man. Nor was he surprised when the offer and the wedding announcement arrived simultaneously over text.
Fortunately, fandom has taught me a great deal about the potential for audience interaction with texts to be transformative as well as analytical, so I’ve brought my stubbornness to bear and found an interpretation that (mostly) satisfies me. I do not know whether the reading I have to offer was in any way intended, but I do think it is consistent with what exists on the screen and adds depth to Watson’s characterization. That being said I don’t suppose I’ll ever entirely forgive them for implying that John Watson, a fricken doctor
It was the most revealing confession Stamford had ever heard from the man. He hesitated. Breathed. Wondered. There was no evidence that his first long-ago interference did anyone good.
If nothing else I ought to have noticed the way I had already fallen into treating him as a partner. It was he to whom I addressed my observations, he to whom I turned for a second opinion, he who I kept by my side when I wanted Lestrade out of the way. And when I accused the criminal in the absence of the police, I was factoring his skill and steadiness into that choice. I think that if anything had happened to him, even then, I might never have stopped feeling an inexplicable void in the space where I nearly had a trusted partner.
But first, a brief introduction:
As you may be aware, in 1954 you were lucky to have any Watson at all in your Holmes adaptations, and and if you did he was doomed to be a cardboard tag-along at best, and a straight-up buffoon at worst. But Reynolds and Crawford weren’t having that. Crawford was determined his Watson wouldn’t be “ the perennial brainless bungler who provided burlesque relief,” and he succeeded: Crawford’s Watson is not Holmes’s trailing sidekick, he is his partner.
“Oh! I thought you were afraid I was going to hit you again.”
“Thanks.”
The words clatter through me, every letter clanging, jarring, threatening to cut and wound me if I don’t let them out but I can’t, god, I can’t.
bungalow, and it’s all devoted to proving you care! And do you want to know why? Why I went to all that bother?”
Instead, thus far he hasn’t even managed to to identify the question he is so frantically posing.
“No, not a word, Sherlock, not a word, you have no right—no, fuck that. Not again. I’m sorry, I should let you explain, though I can’t imagine …” then, unaccountably, he chokes out something like a laugh, and the next words sound almost affectionate, although they can’t be because that makes no sense—“Personal boundaries, Sherlock. I guess we still have to clarify a bit, eh? I assume it was some experiment requiring my ignorance—“ voice breaking again he collapses against the wall, dropping his head into his hands.
If there’s one thing I love most about this series, it is it’s unapologetic joyousness. It’s a quality I respect wherever I find it, but it is all the more welcome amidst the endless procession of dark and mechanic and gritty and heartbreaking Holmes’s. Whenever I see a post expressing exasperation over the way so many adaptations and readings of the character have blown Holmes’s darkness out of proportion and hidden his light, I first agree wholeheartedly, and then wish I could sit the OP down in front of this show.
