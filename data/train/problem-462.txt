He clears his throat, clogged with sentiment as it is. He knows that this is the most he'll ever get with Sherlock. Sherlock doesn't do relationships. Oh, sure he loves and can be so soft, but it's not a romantic sort of love. It's just platonic or familial.
Sherlock's cooking and occasional baking are literally the best food John has ever eaten. He doesn't taste much of Sherlock's emotions when he makes the food, but whatever it is he's feeling makes every meal simply divine. John told him that exactly once which was received with a look that said, 'Of course it does,
John runs his hands down Sherlock's back and brushes up against his tail. Sherlock gives a full body shudder and cries out. "Again, John, again."
Sherlock's mind is becoming foggy with pleasure, but he still feels a sick dread within himself because he knows this is the end.
Sherlock's purr intensified, but that was the only confirmation John got that Sherlock would like that very much indeed.
He opens his eyes. John is watching him with concern and, now that Sherlock knows to look for it, unreserved love.
"It's just me. Don't worry about it. Probably just the short days getting to me." John knows the reassuring smile he gives is anything but reassuring.
John drops his hand from Sherlock's face and gently pulls Sherlock's hand to lead him to Sherlock's own bedroom.
Sherlock feels like his whole body is being held with that touch. It makes breathing just a little bit easier.
When he returns, Sherlock is in his chair rubbing his body all over it. John stands in the doorway a moment, then, "Another symptom, is it?"
"Mmm..when I'm aroused it becomes nearly as sensitive as stroking my prostate. Almost too much really. If you pet it now it'll just feel
"Hey, you." John's smile becomes something more without really changing. There's a depth to it now that was missing a moment before. Sherlock has always loved this about John, his expressive face and myriad of expressions that convey everything and nothing at the same time. John's hand moves from resting atop Sherlock's to gently sliding into his palm and holding firmly.
"The husband described his wife as quicker to fight after the change. So that bit sounds like it's partly down to character...I'm surprised it's not fight for you too."
He was nearly done when he heard Sherlock give a shout of frustration. He turned down the heat on the hob and headed to Sherlock's room to see what was troubling the other man.
John let's out a pained sound and reaches toward Sherlock, but only lets his hand hover near Sherlock without touching.
Harry comes out after Bethany and let's her eyes go wide at the sight of her brother on the couch with Sherlock. "So can I say it was a lovers quarrel now?"
He can feel Sherlock half hard inside of him, ejaculate slowly seeping out. The almost too rough feel of Sherlock's hand on his cock, lubed by only his own prejaculate. And finally, the feel of Sherlock's violin callused hands stroking and pinching his nipples.
Sherlock ducks his face into the covers so the only thing visible is his eyes, the tips of his ears and his hair, "No."
Sherlock swallows heavily. He wants to cry some more, but the adrenaline from the nightmare and then from being caught by John has left him exhausted.
Sherlock gives John a dubious look and takes a sip. What he tastes causes him to drop the cup and grab John by the face to kiss him passionately, which John accepts wholeheartedly, smiling into the kiss.
John hangs his head and gives a loud sigh. Did everyone fucking know about his one sided pining for his emotionally unavailable flatmate? He removes his coat and follows Bethany into the family room by the kitchen where Harry is cooking.
He listens in amazement for a moment before getting up onto shaky legs and going to his dresser drawers.
He looks back down to his belly and rubs at his belly button which has popped out from lack of space. He touches and flicks it and feels his cock give a thick throb of arousal at the sensation. He lets one hand play with a nipple, pulling and squeezing it and uses his other hand to play with his belly button.
John purses his lips. "What would be the point Sherlock? We're old. We've wasted all of our young years."
He thinks back to the day before, when a similar feeling compelled him to rub up into John's chair. John had left and Sherlock needed to make sure he smelt of John and that when John returned he would smell of Sherlock. An overwhelming urge to ensure that everyone knew John was part of
His body is consumed with the fungus. It's a peculiar sensation, almost like when one's limbs fall asleep from inactivity.
Oblivious to any tension between the adults, Rosie climbs onto a dining chair and looks expectantly at John.
Him naked as the day he was born and Sherlock barely covered in his lingerie, yet somehow still more obscene for what John can't see.
They eventually got out of bed. Sherlock hopped into the shower and John went to go make them a hearty breakfast.
Sherlock said he doesn't feel things like that and John suspects that whatever it is growing between them is more instinctual on Sherlock's part and less a deliberate choice. More a response to the increasing fondness John has been directing his way. Mirror neurons and all that.
John's smile starts small and then grows until he's grinning. His heart is racing, but he feels so light.
Sherlock dawdles a moment and listens to the sounds of John rustling through their menu drawer for something to order; then realizes that he can
They look into each other's eyes and Sherlock can feel the tension draining out of him as the warmth of John's palm soaks into him with every gentle caress of his thumb. "Sherlock. You know that I love you right?"
Because it would happen. John would want kids and he would leave Sherlock to have them. So the solution was obvious, Sherlock needed to find some way to have John's child. Adoption was out as there was no way any government agency wouldn't be appalled by their life and its constant dangers.
His hand has begun shaking and he feels like he has worms crawling through his muscles. His bones ache and he's consumed with a terrible feeling. He feels as if the world is ending.
Sherlock takes a sniff of the air and smells bacon, sausage, eggs, beans, and hash. The smell makes him realize he's ravenous.
John opens his eyes slowly and feels his chest tighten at the look on Sherlock's face. He's never seen him look so unsure before.
"Yeah, physically you're stronger, faster, and more resilient now. Night vision will be better. You'll probably want to sleep more though, too. Tradeoffs and all that."
John doubles over with laughter at the look on Sherlock's face as Lestrade suggests he take his breasts off.
John watches Sherlock across the room. He watches as Sherlock's long fingered hands gently manipulate the knobs to focus whatever he's looking at. He watches as Sherlock stares unblinkingly into the dual eyepiece, the light from the stand coming up and illuminating his ever changing eyes.
John stands from his chair and then settles onto Sherlock's lap, straddling his legs. Sherlock brings his arms up and caresses John's back. They meet in the middle for their kiss. John is elated that Sherlock actually does like him and wants him like this. Romantically and sexually.
John turns around with the plates and says in a deep voice, "Obviously, Princess Rosie," and then looks with Rosie to Sherlock, who smiles and says in his deepest voice, "Obviously."
He can feel the baby moving through him. An odd sensation that quickly becomes overwhelmingly pleasurable as the baby seems to be pressing against his prostate as it makes its steady way out of him. He writhes on the floor and sinks to his back. He hikes his legs up and starts bearing down. For as quickly as everything else has happened it feels as if this, the birth itself, is happening in agonizing slowness. He's sweating and panting with the exertion and the unending stimulation.
Sherlock forces air and words out of his lungs again, "I have everything to be sorry for. Because of me you've lost everything you've ever loved. All I am is darkness in your life."
"Well John? All these years you've supposedly been stalking me and you still can't just reach out? That was always your problem. You always were more concerned about how people perceived you rather then just simply accepting yourself.
After a few moments of sitting together half embraced, Sherlock relaxes a little. John has always steadied him. John takes a deep breath when he feels Sherlock melt into him slightly. Then he begins to speak softly, intimately into Sherlock's ear.
He walks to the edge of the frozen pond and takes a seat and then carefully lies back onto the ground. He's chilled, but not dangerously so yet. Presumably that'll change when it begins to rain or snow.
John freezes as a surge of adrenaline runs through him. He has no idea why Sherlock is hugging him and says as much.
Once the doors open John heads straight for the break room and the coffee machine. He dumps the grounds and makes a new pot. Once it's brewed he pours some into a cheap Styrofoam cup and hands it to Sherlock.
Sherlock watches as John's so very expressive face changes slightly, it softens, almost imperceptibly.
It's not enough to make him come but it is a beautiful sensation of teased arousal, like scratching an itch. He moans again, this time at the sight of his body. He hadn't known what that concoction would do, if anything, but this is beyond anything he thought possible. He, a man, is very much pregnant and ready to burst with a
John jerks his head up and sees Sherlock watching him intently, worriedly. "Sorry. It. It still hurts to think about that time." He takes a deep breath and smiles sadly, softly, "We're past that though. Let's not dwell on it. How about you? When did you know you wanted, um, me?"
"Good. Thank you." Sherlock relaxes and gives a gentle pleased purr. He cringes internally at the sound, but is helpless to stop it. He hasn't entirely determined the reflexive muscles that control his purr and what it is that prompts it. He picks at his food for a minute. "So what else can I expect?"
He pulls out an older pair of pajama trousers, grabs a pair of scissors from his bedside drawer and cuts a hole in the bottom for his tail. He doesn't bother with pants. Why ruin more than one piece of clothing?
"Ha," Sherlock scoffs, "that's why you left with Rosie all those years ago and never spoke to me again. I found out about your
John smiles at Rosie with one of his big open mouth smiles. "Oh I can, can I? What if I don't want too? What if I want to keep you in my arms forever and ever? Hm what then?" John lifts Rosie high in the air and then brings her down, gives her a big hug and lots a kisses on her face.
John purses his lips but doesn't comment. "Ok. Do you have any idea at all what may have caused this?"
Sherlock however cooks for John regularly. Which honestly surprised him the first time it happened. Given what Sherlock could taste from others and his natural reticence to share anything personal (John quickly learned personal questions of Sherlock's past were pointless as they only earned him a blank stare.) John had assumed Sherlock would be disinclined to cook.
John takes a sip and wakes up some if only to bask in the deliciousness of the drink and the warmth of unidentifiable emotions John always tastes from Sherlock.
Sherlock ears perk up and the end of his tail twitches, "Oh, there's an idea. Can we go home and have sex on
John is rewarded with his answer by Sherlock's face slowly shifting from uncertainty to a cautious joy. Sherlock ducks his head, but John can see the blush reaching the tips of his ears. John squeezes Sherlock's hands in his and gently questions, "Sherlock?"
Sherlock's look changed to one of puzzlement, "Whatever for? His visit will be infinitely more bearable with you by my side."
John shakes his head. "Finish eating, we'll talk after breakfast. There's a bit to go through and I don't want you getting distracted."
Sherlock crawls up onto his bed and turns to face John, his lips red, plump, and parted. "Take your clothes off for me John."
After a moment they break away and Sherlock looks at John with a combination of astonishment and wonder, "Why did you never say anything or simply make me something before?"
"Ah. Ok. Did you forget you should probably confess your undying love for someone before you start snogging them senseless?"
Sherlock gives him an inscrutable look, then takes a deep breath, "I've always wanted you John. I just didn't realise for a long time all the different ways I wanted you were really the same. I wanted you to move in. I wanted you to like me. I wanted your attention. I wanted your presence. Then, like you, when I no longer had it, I realised exactly what kind of wanting it was."
John manages to catch up before the doors fully close and he bullies his way onto the elevator. John catches his breath and looks at Sherlock.
"Daddy! Are you done eating? We have to put the star on the tree." Rosie calls impatiently from the living room.
John uses his right arm on top to gently brush Sherlock's curls as he whispers quietly, "I don't know what your nightmare was about, Sherlock, but whenever I had one of mine I always woke with the wish that someone, anyone, would hold me and tell me it was going to be okay. So, yeah. Whatever it was, it's okay now."
John chokes on his laughter and rushes to Sherlock and pulls the man's jacket closed to cover his exposed breasts.
"Because I didn't think it was possible for you to be even more beautiful than you are, but that blush does it. It makes me want to kiss you. Can I kiss you?"
John's eyes are closed as he pulls back from Sherlock's face. He feels like his heart is cracking open as it beats an erratic tattoo against his ribs. The kiss was so sweet, so tender, he feels his face tighten as if he's eaten a sour candy.
John knows that he can't bear to be separated from Sherlock right now and so he blurts out without thinking, "I want to sleep with you tonight."
He's so exhausted, but he feels safe here like this with his face in John's neck, John's arm around his back rubbing small circles, and John's other hand in his curls cradling his head.
He's still in the clearing, but it's clearly late spring now. The water is unfrozen and a still tranquil blue. The sun is shining and the clearing is covered in dappled light filtering through the nearby full canopy of leaves from the trees. He's surrounded by warm earth, dewy grass, and fragrant wildflowers in bright, cheery colors.
They stare at each other for a long moment before John clears his throat, "So, let's go over the medical facts first. How are you feeling? What other symptoms are you experiencing...besides the obvious?"
It's late and they and Lestrade are deep into research for a cold case that may or may not be relevant to a recent spate of burglaries.
He thinks to the mangled body of the man that started all this. His body found in his bedroom. Pods upon stalks bursting from his back.
John looks down at a spot next to Sherlock's head, "Why don't you put something on and I'll order in?"
Sherlock hears the sound of the ground floor door closing and realizes with a shock, so absorbed with his situation, that he has no way of warning John.
John takes in a deep breath and feels himself calm back down. He turns back towards Sherlock and catches him quickly looking away.
John sees it for what it is. Sherlock is nervous and he's falling back into habits. Posh habits for keeping a stiff upper lip.
John looks at him a moment processing what Sherlock has just said before grabbing him in a fierce hug.
The meal is easy and when they finish John makes them both more tea since they never really got to drink it earlier. They stay at the kitchen table and simply exist with each other for a while. After half of John's tea is gone he clears his throat.
Sherlock starts blinking rapidly and gaping at him. John's seen this a couple times before. He privately refers to it as a 'reboot'. He knows if he waits a moment Sherlock will finish processing and continue the conversation.
As someone who prides himself on his ability to conceal, to hide everything behind a mask of cold indifference, this is the true horror. He can get used to a tail and extra ears, can even rationalize their value, but they leave him so vulnerable.
Sherlock gets up then carrying the cocoa mugs and comes over and stage whispers to Rosie, "Wizard," then wanders into the kitchen.
He's a man of science and here he is stirring what basically amounts to a potion. But it's a necessary evil. He couldn't find what he needed elsewhere. Every lab or research facility he called (and there weren't many to begin with) who were studying male pregnancy gave him the same disappointing answer.
"To practice, of course. I can't learn to use my new appendages or develop new skills if I'm cooped up in the flat. I'll just throw my coat and that damnable Deerstalker on and we'll go to a secluded place I know. I'll be able to work on myself and you'll be there to help me." Sherlock could feel himself beaming, his ears perking towards John and his tail wrapping around his own shoulders caressing himself. He couldn't figure out why his plan was making him so darn happy, though. It was just exercising under John's watchful eye.
Sherlock gives John a glare before continuing, "As I was saying, please don't be alarmed, but I have grown a cat tail and ears this afternoon."
Sherlock is smiling down at Rosie, a wholly tender look that John realizes is frequently on his face these days.
It is a night of revelations as Sherlock sees the data rolling off of John. Deductions he previously chose not to make.
It curls around him and despite the fact that he abhors it touching him, reminding him of how he's changed, it's also comforting in a way. It eases him in the same way as crossing one's arms.
John is at work and Sherlock is feeling sick. He writhes around naked on his sheets, his body hot and sore. His spine feels like it's on fire and his head is throbbing.
John takes the couch in the living room with the Christmas Tree. It's a beautiful sight and he wishes Sherlock were there to see it in that moment because it is truly lovely and he would appreciate it.
John picks up his tea and stares into it's murky depths. No help from the tea leaves for this. He's on his own.
Sherlock is equal parts pleased and amazed to watch the dopey grin John gets as he processes Sherlock's question.
"Sherlock. You went through so much for me. If anything, I'm disappointed in myself for not realizing you needed me sooner."
"Well thank God for that, but we don't 'moon' at each other. We are of an intellect above normal people and are communicating without actually speaking to each other."
Sherlock can't look John in the eyes so he focuses on a water stain on the coffee table before telling John neutrally, "I'm no good at this John. You are better off staying away from me. I'll hurt you no matter how hard I try not to." Sherlock swallows tightly, "I already have."
Rosie begins chatting about the food and the movies. John answers appropriately where necessary.  He's distracted though and can tell Sherlock knows he's distracted.
Before John can say anything, ask anything, Rosie comes thundering down the stairs and into the kitchen. "Daddy! Sherlock! Elsa and I are ready for dinner." Rosie has put her Elsa dress on over her regular clothes and made sure Elsa was wearing her blue dress as well.
. The belstaff is long gone, worn and mostly impractical here. He takes one last look around his cottage before exiting out the door and carefully locking up.
"John. You heard Rosie. You have to kiss me. It's the rules." Sherlock smiles at John one of his truly happy eye wrinkling smiles.
Sherlock watches as blood splatters onto John's face and begins oozing in a thick foam from John's mouth.
Suddenly he feels dizzy and collapses slowly to the bathroom floor, first to his knees and then completely, feeling the coolness of the tiles. He clutches his head as a burning intense pain rips through him, starting in his skull and then continuing down his spine. He convulses and arches. It feels like the pain will never end, but suddenly it's quiet except for his heavy panting.
John gives a huffed laugh, "Pretty sure that's my line." He reaches up to explore the planes of Sherlock's muscles. Sherlock leans down and they kiss again. Tongues gently sweeping into each other's mouths.
He turns and looks towards the small gathering of woods at the edge of his property. There are no proper forests in England anymore, but one could still get proper lost in the trees near his property.
He pulls the drawer of his dresser open, grabs some clean pajamas and slips them on. He looks into his mirror and frowns at what he sees.
He slips the trousers up and works his tail into them. He forgoes a shirt for now because he's still pretty warm. He also, for some vague reason he can't explain, just knows putting a shirt on would be very uncomfortable. If he's being honest with himself, the trousers are already almost borderline too much.
Sherlock is quick to comply and comes inside. John shuts the door behind him to stop the cold from sucking out all the warmth of the room.
They sit there quietly, looking into each other's faces. John revels in the closeness of Sherlock. He knows what he wants next.
John looks back over to Sherlock again. He has no idea what John is thinking. No idea the thoughts going through his head.
They both need the moment to decide how the conversation will go from here. They've both admitted their big secret. Now it's all a matter of logistics, so to speak.
John wrinkles his forehead and quirks his lips into a half smile, "Want? For a fairly long time, but I didn't really consciously acknowledge it until..." John coughs awkwardly and continues roughly, "Until you. Um. Died." He looks down at his hands and frowns.
He feels (both with his fingers and with the skin being stroked, which is an odd but not unpleasant sensation) the new soft moist folds of skin. He can feel himself dripping. He smears his fingers around and gathers some up so he can bring it up to his face. It's clear and slightly viscous, with a musky scent.
"That had more to do with you suddenly begging for me to fuck you then with you suddenly having quite lovely breasts. Quite honestly if you had begged me to have sex with you before the breasts I would've said yes."
John feels the familiar tightness in his chest as he continues to casually stare at his flatmate. The choking feeling that always comes with thoughts of Sherlock and how they are here together, but not actually
John pulls out a chair and sits next to Sherlock, and in a soft voice speaks, "Hey. It's okay. I mean, yeah this happened and we can't change it, but. We'll get through it. You just need to adjust and I will help you every step of the way."
It does not affect his mind, and, true, he had sometimes wished to be just that, a mind, to remove the burdens of his transport.
They lie like that, just breathing, for a few minutes, until John looks over at Sherlock and quietly asks, "How did you know I'd prefer to sleep on the left?"
He's old and so tired looking. His face isn't fresh and youthful anymore. His body is dense, a combination of leftover muscle and Mrs. Hudson's leftover cakes. He isn't lithe and gorgeous like Sherlock.
"Now that we've kissed and made up quite literally, let's get some sleep. It's still early and I'm tired."
He can feel Sherlock's body pressed up behind his, a single lanky arm loosely draped over his waist. John gently strokes Sherlock's arm and hand. He traces the veins that pop up from Sherlock's thin hands. They're  big and strong and yet so delicate.
Sherlock wakes in his bed, his sheets thrown completely off onto the floor. His body soaked in sweat. He rolls onto his side and curls into the fetal position and gives quiet sobs.
"Ah. This is a hallucination. My brains gasping last pulses. I suppose this is preferable to a recap of my life."
And that's how John knows Sherlock is very much not fine, but he goes to fetch the food from the courier anyway.
Sherlock is lounging in his chair one leg artfully thrown over the side causing his legs to be spread wide giving John a full view of Sherlock from his very erect satin covered cock to his barely contained breasts.
John moved in with Sherlock the same day he saw the flat. It took him nearly two weeks though to meet Sherlock's boyfriend. He had said at dinner when Sherlock returned from his outing that singular evening that it was all fine. Sherlock claimed to be married to his work and that was that, or so John thought.
"You were a soldier John. I put you closest to the points of egress, as well as between potential attackers and someone you'd like to protect. Paradoxically, you'll sleep better."
John cracks open one eye to see Bethany standing in her Pjs, smartphone in hand, clicking photos of him and Sherlock together on the couch.
Rosie is holding the star for the tree waiting for John. "You have to put the star on the tree daddy and make a wish."
Rosie picks up on Sherlock's tone and gives a shout, "Obviously, daddy" Its very different them when Sherlock says it; for starters, Rosie hasn't got the sarcasm tone right yet so it sounds overly joyful, but she has decided that part of the amusement is in how deep Sherlock's voice usually is when he says it and she does her best to imitate that. Its become a game, a tradition now. When someone says 'obviously', everyone else has to too.
This twisted thing inside Sherlock which consumes him and steals his agency, forces him to act in ways he would never under his rational control.
"I." Sherlock swallows, his throat tight, "I did not know that." His voice is raspy and he can hear himself choking on the words. "Could you please clarify what you mean?"
"I always did say you were an idiot," he says bitterly. To think. All those years ago John left him out of some skewed sense of morality.
The set up a slow rythym and the moment is perfect. John looks up at Sherlock. His hair is a riot of curls and his cat ears are velvety black in the low light of the fire. Their eyes meet and John is certain he has never met a man more beautiful in his life. And he's made all the more gorgeous by the look of pure wonder on his face, as if he's the lucky one.
They lie like this for a while, until their skin has cooled and their sweat has dried. Until Sherlock decides to break the silence.
Rosie gives John a kiss on his cheek, "Thank you. Love you daddy." She then runs off upstairs to fetch her doll.
He can feel every movement. His tongue in John's mouth, the coarse friction of John's jeans, and the steel of John's muscles where Sherlock's hands pin his arms.
He's on his knees hunched over grabbing his middle, his head pressed into the floor. He's panting hard as he feels a weird squirming in his abdomen that makes him nauseous. The squirming subsides into a dull tightness and he collapses onto his side on the floor, breathing hard. After a few moments he collects himself and leans against the cabinets.
Sherlock's ears, which had been flat during most of John's explanations, betray his inner thoughts as they flick forward, alert, and then press back down. "You know me. I don't actually seek out other people unless I have to," he explains delicately. "But back to the summary. Anything else?"
"Yes, John, ruining the moment. I get all dressed up like this and lie down in my chair all sexy-like and you come in and have sex with me.
"John, John, John!" And just like that Sherlock is coming all over John. The sight and feel of Sherlock coming has John falling over the edge as well.
Sweat soaks him and he is so thirsty. He carefully pushes himself up and out of the bed and takes a couple of steps into the bathroom. His body is pale save for two red spots high on his cheekbones. His hair is a mess and stuck up in odd angles. He runs his hands through his hair and gasps at how sensitive his scalp has become.
He realises he's standing, but he doesn't remember standing. Doesn't remember thinking he wanted to be standing.
John watches in fascination as a gentle blush graces Sherlock's cheeks and Sherlock looks away for a moment, clearly proud, but very much not wanting John to know it.
John doesn't face Sherlock, staring unseeingly at the counter before him, but he tilts his head in acknowledgement that he's heard what Sherlock has said.
Sherlock suddenly feels irrationally angry. He stands up with a huff and looks down at John confrontationally. John stares a moment before slowly standing to face Sherlock.
"Holy shit, John. Do you not have any tastebuds?!" Lestrade pushes John's coffee back over and wipes his eyes.
He closes his eyes as John knocks on his door and calls his name again, then after a moment slowly opens the door.
John complies before Sherlock can finish asking. He's kissing Sherlock. Open mouthed and messy, panting.
"Sherlock. I need you to listen to what I'm about to say. I need you to know that I have not lost everything I've loved because of you. You have given me everything. Everything Sherlock. If you are darkness, then I'm the corner that embraces you. You are my world.
John made it halfway down the stairs before Sherlock came barreling down after him and stopped him with a hand on his bicep. "John. Wait."
"Well, bully for you!" And with that he slams the front door to 221B and heads out into the cold slushy snow.
He picks it up gingerly and shudders at the sensation. The fur is soft, silky, and dark brown like the hair on his head, but shorter and slightly stiffer.
Slowly, centimeter by centimeter John feels himself being filled by the girth of Sherlock. His own cock rests between them, rock hard and slowly dribbling precome. After what feels like an eternity, John can feel himself seated flush on Sherlock.
Their synchronicity is hypnotising and beyond erotic for John, almost more so then the act itself. John feels as if he's no longer in control of his body. He is Sherlock's to do with as he pleases. It's heady and subsuming.
Now another two weeks have gone by and John has seen the man several times. Mostly as Mycroft is coming or going, though once he turned up at the outskirts of a crime scene. Just watching. John had pointed him out, in case Sherlock hadn't noticed (unlikely, but not impossible). Sherlock merely waved John off and said he'd talk to him later.
John brings his hands up and runs them through Sherlock's curls, grabbing them, ensuring their kiss doesn't break for a moment.
John could kick his past self 1000 times over because he knows that he's the one who crushed Sherlock's self confidence regarding this. He's the one who made it so even the great Sherlock Holmes with all the evidence in front of him couldn't believe his own eyes.
"Well. After you went to bed I did a bunch of internet searches and I also called up Mike to see if they had anything in the hospital library. He dropped off a book this morning, and between that and the internet, I've got a general idea of what's happened to you and what you can expect."
He brews a pot of Folgers coffee. Absolutely bland stuff, but perhaps Mycroft will leave more quickly because of it and John can still salvage his brunch plans with Sherlock.
Specifically, John is staring at Sherlock's rather generous cleavage and the cherry red bra clearly holding his breasts under his white blouse.
He feels as if the whole world exists right there among these four walls. With the curtains drawn as they are, he can pretend there's just them.
John frowns and he lets out a long sigh. "I get why you would think that. I really do. But I'm here. I've always been with you."
He feels as the fungus controls his limbs and opens the fridge. It gorges itself on whatever food is in there, not bothering with utensils, but simply using his hands. Then it heads to the sink and begins drinking from the tap. Swallowing mouthful after mouthful of water until Sherlock feels his stomach distended in pain. It stops then and holds Sherlock's body perfectly still.
Admittedly, he's always been a bit touchy about the possibility of John leaving (and there's that aggressive feeling of possession again), but not like this.
John stands and notes the time. It's late and they've unravelled a lot. Honestly, he's exhausted. He looks back to Sherlock and Sherlock smiles.
"I mean that you're the only person for me Sherlock. I love you in all the ways that matter. I want to be with you. I want to grow old with you."
Sherlock looks up at John and cuts him off, "Please don't bother denying it. We both know how much you like them."
Soon John is taking pulls of milk from Sherlock's breast in time with the slide of Sherlock's cock in and out of him.
Ah. That explains his dark look a moment earlier. A lover's spat. It was probably a bit much for John to hope Sherlock breaks up with Mycroft.
For the life of him he hopes that Sherlock has a moment like this as well to hold on to. He hopes Sherlock has countless moments like this. He hopes
John reaches around Sherlock and grabs his  butt and pulls him down until their groins are in contact again. They rut against each other until Sherlock breaks away with a moan, "John. John, we have to stop or I'm going to come in my pants. I'd much rather take them off and come on you. Are you amniable to that?"
"Of course I do. I love you, you brilliant man." John watches as Sherlock's mouth does a funny wiggle, like he can't decide whether to smile or cry.
The pub was a good idea John thinks to himself. He's much more relaxed now and ready to face Sherlock.
Sherlock stills. He looks up from his thumb into John's face. John is leaned across the table and smiling weakly.
Sherlock stirs the pot. The room is filled with a scent similar to cherries, but somehow sweeter and more delicate.
"That's. That's very good." Sherlock blushes again. "I also realised I wanted all the affections that come with it."
John thinks about the two of them standing there. Red faced from blushing, absolutely ecstatic at the turn of events, and completely ridiculously in love. So much so he's gone completely stupid with it.
Out of all the possible reactions he foresaw John having, this one is unprecedented. Somehow his mind could not fathom this single act of kindness.
Sherlock shakes his head and growls in frustration, "I'm not being clear. Mycroft isn't my type. You are."
Rosie comes into the room. She takes Sherlock's hand and John's and puts them together. "When people say 'I love you' you have to kiss them."
symptom. I know you and you'll get so distracted by the information and, I'm sure, questions you'll have, that you'll forget all about your food. However, you've just been through a major biological change in many ways akin to puberty, and you need all the calories you can get. Eat. We'll talk after."
After a while John's knees begin to hurt and he shifts and they both separate slightly; John to lean back on his calves and Sherlock to lean back slightly in his chair. They don't let go of each other though, their hands are clasped once again.
It's early in the morning, the sun is still not up yet. They've probably only been asleep a couple of hours. It's quiet save for Sherlock's even steady breathes.
It's been a couple of weeks since the last time John came by. Sherlock has been avoiding doing anything around the flat and he knows it's a mess.
Sherlock clutched his arm where the cat had scratched him. It had left five neat marks on his arm. He grimaced, but determined they would be fine.
Princess Rosie have decided to grace us with their prescence this evening." John smiles down at his daughter and then up at Sherlock.
When John comes home, he comes in through the kitchen and sets down the groceries and takeout and turns into the living room to the heartwarming sight of Sherlock and Rosie watching a movie snuggled up under a blanket and half empty mugs of hot chocolate.
He's still hot and achy, but most of the searing pain that had consumed him before has dissipated. He lays like that for hours, or possibly merely minutes, he doesn't know.
He's pretty positive he even blacks out for a second. It feels as if it goes on for ages and yet at the same time it's over too quickly.
Sherlock woke in the early hours the next day. He was on his front, his lower back aching. He had refused to sleep on his back, to avoid acknowledging his new form, but now, he was paying the price. He rolls to his side and curls up into a ball. He can feel where his tail moves between the sheets.
Sherlock pulls himself out of John's grip, fixes his bra, and does up his shirt, "Seems rather antiquated of you John." Then walks off the crime scene in a huff.
I feel like their characterization is all over the place. Please let me know if I've screwed this up somehow.
It's been quiet the last few days. John suspects something will come up soon; it's been snowing nonstop since yesterday evening and people in close quarters are dangerous.
John swallows and feels his throat constrict drily. It appears his words are dry too, but he's a soldier and where Sherlock can't press forward, he will.
His floundering is stopped in it's tracks however when Sherlock stands and soundly kisses him again. This kiss is much less chaste, though still tender.
John lets go of Sherlock's hand and gets up from the booth. It kills Sherlock to drive John away, but it's for the best.
If she really didn't want him to take any samples though then she wouldn't have left him alone in the viewing room.
The concoction has been at a roiling boil for 17 minutes and it's now time to add the final ingredient. He double checks he's done everything accordingly and prepares to add it, which, as silly as it seems, is the breath of a virgin, which was the easiest ingredient to get- his breath. He's never been more thankful for his past self's disinterest and, currently, John's insistence they take things slow.
"Oh my God." John smiles and sits up, careful not to knock Sherlock to the floor. "Yes. We can go now. Harry. Bethany. Thank you for dinner and having me over. Apparently, I need to get home."
He'll wake with a scream of terror stopped in his throat, his body covered in a night sweat so bad it's as if he stepped out of the bath, and if he passed out somewhere other than bed, then the likely destruction of whatever was breakable within reach of his thrashing.
? Why? What do we gain from this?" John takes a deep breath amd wills the tears in his eyes away. "No. Do you know? Do you
"Don't be absurd. You wouldn't agree to sex with me unless you were overwhelmed with lust. Ergo, the outfit and the breasts."
John could feel his face turn hot and red, "You absolute wanker. You absolute. Fucking wanker. God, I actually fucking hate you sometimes." John steps to the door and aggressively puts on his coat and shoes.
Lestrade takes a deep breath and let's it out slowly, "John. That is the purest cup of pining and unrequited love to have ever graced this Earth."
Sherlock steps over to join in the placing of the star on their Christmas tree. He leans in close and places an arm behind Rosie resting on John's back.
John listens and contemplates Sherlock's words, stated so simply and plainly as they were. John hears the genuine reflection in his tone.
Sherlock is the first to recover. He splutters, "What are you talking about?! How could you think I would ever. Ever." Sherlock waves his hands in the general direction of Mycroft. "With him!"
There's something about their light banter that makes John's heart squeeze and his stomach flip. He feels like he's flirting. Suddenly he can feel his face flush.
John feels his face go soft and he's sure that if Sherlock looked to him in this moment he would see nothing but love on his face.
"Yeah, the woman who looks like the child in The Ring. She is on the 7th floor, she was moved and put in a new, bigger room. And now she has a telly too. Here are your access passes." She was staring at the luggage that Sherlock had with him. "What do you have there, Mr. Holmes?"
"Here, it’s about two hundred. The damage is less than in MI5 or Piccadilly, but we have more deaths than in MI5. St Barth’s is permanently blocked." said Greg. "We have no record, no way to trace the people who did this action so far. "
"Good. Do you have anything then?" asked again the director in a quieter tone. " You know that Mycroft Holmes will be arriving at any time and I want to avoid a moment of embarrassment at all costs."
"Sure they would agree. They knew that Mycroft would eventually contact them. Yet, they are as surprised as we are."
Sherlock left the room, his thoughts were troubled. The terrorist was telling the truth, it was certainly stimulating but he would get nothing from him. He returned to those who had called him, Lestrade looked at him and John seemed worried after this "he" as if he had understood.
"It has changed quite a bit, and that must change you from the main DGSE." She replied. "It has changed since the former director of our department is dead and Marie-Jeanne has resumed his duties but you must understand, I imagine, if you are here now Hazel it's that
This attack was too singular, it was not like the one France had experienced, it was not of the same type as the one that had attacked the New Zealand and it was certainly not like the one that Mission Impossible had dismantled a few months earlier. It was a new kind. Between the press starting to talk about it and the public personalities starting to get tangled up, the less time went by, the ideas went elsewhere. Scotland Yard was starting to get back on its feet, as was MI5, and by attacking four strategic locations in London, the whole country was paralyzed.
"You’re late." Eurus' voice was cold. Sherlock sketched a smile and Mycroft walked towards her. "Is it just the two of you? Not Dad, not Mum?"
At the agreement of this voice, Holmes turned and ran towards the voice, Anderson followed him and the two fell on Lestrade’s limp to reach them.
In the distance chatting with R and 006, Q seemed to be in complete control in front of the side screen that hung over the wall. All looked at the screen pointing at different messages, Mallory recognized some. They were the ones that the various cyber-attacks had left, at least their resolutions. Mallory has advanced a safer step beyond Bill, a curious look on his face.
or rather a clandestine was an honor and that only the best of the best were recruited, so it was always interesting to see what a new agent has to prove.
"John and his bloody hat. Sorry, it burned in a fire." Sherlock glared at his brother. "Are you new here?"
"Ugh ... Well, John and I will do our research on our side, if we get something, we'll come back to you, in the meantime, contact Mycroft and do what you have to do. I’m sure your men will be very happy not to see me on this big case any longer." Sherlock replied the most seriously and ironically in the world before resuming his way to the exit.
"He?" asked Sherlock perplexed. What could he be talking about? Sherlock was no longer really following.
"Eurus Holmes." added Mycroft by cutting it somewhat impatient and at the same time totally amused by the new host secretary.
"So the biggest terror of this world in reality? Yes, you are not uninteresting otherwise you would not be there, especially when you carry out an attack."
He looked up at Madeleine. She had closed James' suitcase with such annoyance, the blond thought she was going to start a fight again. He sighed softly while Madeleine breathed.
"So this is the office where the Colonel sometimes comes to check that everything is going well between us and that no one is killing each other. Otherwise, in general, you will find him in Marie-Jeanne’s office, in a crisis cell or in his office at the DGSE. In fact, we don’t see much of him. Now I think I’ve told you everything about our department." The young woman paused a moment and looked at her future colleague, making sure that she had followed.
In the rubble of the explosion, they were looking for him. Sherlock and John were on the lookout, they both thought the explosion had to come from the room where the terrorist had been left. They were indeed right, the explosion generated by the suicide bomber arrested in Piccadilly had caused part of the Scotland Yard offices to collapse. It was weird. Scotland Yard attacked. Scotland Yard joined the other three places. It was the drop of water that broke the camel or the icing on the cake.
"I’m coming, darling. I absolutely wish to finish this now or Mycroft will come tomorrow and I’d like to avoid Merlin having a migraine." he answered calmly as the young man had already entered his office.
"Oh, I see ... I hope the change is that the office is more inclusive now !" She said smiling. Marina laughed at Hazel, who was right, the BDL, finally Bureau des Légendes, had meanwhile become more inclusive since her arrival and the return of Malotru.
Sherlock turned to him. He knew that after the attack, the recovery of the victims, Lestrade was not to be at the top of his physical form. And he also knew that yet he had returned to work despite this.
"If we have a baby, one day, I should be sweeter with them." Eggsy's voice was innocent, as was the look he gave to his lover.
Once we get to the station. They had a quick walk and talked about what was going to happen next and finally realized that everything was a complete mess.
James knew that Madeleine would eventually die at his side, either from danger or from old age. She would end up dying like Séverine. Or by leaving him because she wouldn’t want to have to face this somewhat broken man anymore. So he preferred to do like Camille, he preferred to put an end to all this.
"They just want to be wanted, and then when they come here, we’ll learn that one of their best agents is messing around..."
"From the beginning, we had been prevented of the situation, indeed, but nobody understood that this was what it was about."
How could this have happened? In such a short interval. It was unprecedented! Everything was temporarily blocked, the police had started their work and the civilians were hardly supported. M sighed thinking of the call he had just received, announcing nothing good. He was about to get up when Bill Tanner furiously entered his office held up by Eve Moneypenny.

It was an extremely hard blow to swallow. The number of dead and wounded had been shared by a Prime Minister under pressure in the press and knowing that the operation had caused 409 deaths and about 520 wounded, 170 of which between life and death had only made things worse and the collective frenzy. For Mycroft Holmes, it was a picture of a situation he was increasingly unaware of. Even though, as Sherlock liked to say; he is the British government. He was so busy that he hired another assistant. Plus, he had another problem to deal with, his siblings.
"Yes, them." Eggsy’s narcissistic smile seemed to display a childish joy. Knowing what that means, Harry looked at Eggsy slightly surprised.
John came back to Lestrade and Sherlock to help. Sally came behind them by holding a piece of cloth on her arm. The four were headed straight for the exit, at the passage, seeing that the help was already there. Greg was totally overwhelmed, not by his injuries, but by seeing his men on the ground, by seeing Scotland Yard touched by this fucking terrorist operation. He was still struggling to continue to lead and assist his teams even though it was almost bloody.
"Over 7 years of working together and you still can’t call me Mycroft. How heartbreaking, M." He said, shaking hands with Gareth and then moving forward to greet everyone. "Mr. Tanner. Miss Moneypenny. R. 006. Q." He said, shaking hands and finally standing beside Q to give him a slight smile that Q gave him back. "I’m listening."
Marina was the most recent clandestine. She had never seen an officer go through the same process as her. She was thrilled, she also knew that becoming a future
"For London, nothing new, time goes by but nothing gets better. They are always completely confused. That’s why Kingsman asked for Hazel as soon as possible."
She glanced at hze again before leaving the canteen. She crossed the premises and stopped in the yard to smoke a cigarette. Balmes had noticed her change of attitude, still happy that she thought it was because of the Russians and everything that had happened because of the FSB. After all, it's true that being a hostage was a traumatic experience, but that was to be expected with a such job.
"Don’t care, I don’t trust them." added Eggsy before getting up from Harry’s knees. "We'll see how the arrival of their agent will happen, but .. "
"I have something!" exclaimed fervently Q, which caused almost everyone to stop. "I have something. Look."
"They've already sifted me, you know. He looked up at one of the cameras in the corner of the room, smiling. "I have nothing more to say."
He took out his violin, Mycroft sat down and watched his brother and sister play in harmony as usual, while coguing on his words. Even if their siblings were the strangest, they understood each other, they supported each other and maybe they really loved each other. They knew they had to protect the one thing that really connected them, a person, their little brother who also turned out to be the young Quartermaster of MI6.
"I was protecting France. I was not breaking the codes. Much less the code of loyalty, thank you. I know who she is and you’re not answering my question. Good to see you again, Odelair."
After all, getting to the BDL even when you're an experienced agent is always a little complicated. So, for a new agent who has only been through the DGSE before that can be complicated.
Eurus was not wrong. Mycroft was obviously concerned about everything that was going on in London right now, he didn’t really have a choice but he was calmer than anyone else in this room. He was just worried about it.
Lestrade looked at Sherlock with incomprehension, he left in a hurry and was quickly caught up by John and his brother-in-law. Greg seemed tired and yelled at Sherlock.
"The government has called in the intelligence services for a special request. Thinking that with the geopolitical tensions exploding recently in the UE, France had to take a lead for its security. In order for this to happen the government decided to place clandestine agents in the main cities of Europe of major interest to France, such as London, Rome or Berlin and other neighbouring countries. Thus was born the program Peace Under Control known as UCP, conceptualized when Henri Duflot was still director of the Bureau but finalized with Marie-Jeanne. This new program will serve both diplomatic and political interests, as well as the protection of national secrets."
"I’m not talking about them. I’m talking about Sherlock." Eurus took her violin. "Neither Scotland Yard, nor MI6 or Kingsman will be able to support this work by being dispatched. Collaborate."
"You know it’s going to continue, don’t you... ? Mycroft, you can’t rule out any help, I see, we’re offering you help."
"Mycroft and Sherlock Holmes!" she said, looking at the card on her screen. "You are the Beyoncé of crime! The famous detective with the cap.. that you do not wear today. It would almost be hard to recognize you without it." the young student who was at the reception was smiling at the top of her teeth, which caused a muffled laugh from Mycroft.
Indeed, it was complicated the traffic being blocked with these numerous detours put in place but the taxi had managed to find a way and in thirteen minutes, the duo had arrived. Sherlock gave the driver 50-pounds, and then they both took a quick step to the secure location where they came across a Sally Donovan not surprised to see them.
"Who spits in the sky, it falls back on his face... Soon to come on you." Mallory finished, frowning.
"I think those who are aiming at us were trying to get a message out. That seems to be the last of the 10." Added Q looking at his superior.
"For the French... That’s okay. They’re going to help." threw Eggsy in the middle of the movie, caressing JB.
Having almost all been decimated, the remaining four had succeeded in eliminating those who sought to destroy their inheritance. This reviving their rivalry with the MI6. Of these four agents, Harry Hart became the new Arthur, Merlin resumed his Quartermaster's duties, despite his infirmity. Roxanne "Roxy" Morton also known as Lancelot, who had managed to survive the explosion of their headquarters, remained the best knight of the agency. And Gary "Eggsy" Unwin had to go through a lot of twists like saving the world again or being dumped by the Princess of Sweden on their wedding day. Maybe it was crazy but at least he was staying at Kingsman and Harry was back in his life. Today, the agency was stronger than ever, and had new recruits, both knights and simple agents operating for Kingsman had everything back in their hands. A whole new era was present since 2016.
When she heard that name, the young woman turned to the voice calling her away. The glance of a piercing blue finally captured her interlocutor, walking towards her, the young woman combed her hair, placing her strand of hair on her side in the wake of her short hazel hair. Once arrived in front of two women, displaying gracious smiles despite eyes slightly tinged with fatigue, Rocambole smiled to them followed by a "Hello Marie-Jeanne, Hello Rim."
"Well ... do I have to remind you how many cars you owe me?" he said, grabbing his chin to tease him.
A minion noted the sentence that had just appeared on the screen in the notebook he was holding. There were other unreadable sentences in the sight of Bill, Eve and Gareth.
"Not yet, but let us not dwell on it. We have to do here, Marie-Jeanne." replied the colonel. "Rocambole."
"It’s me we’re waiting for." The voice was too familiar to their ears. Greg sighed of both frustration and relief. Sherlock looked at Mycroft with a distrust.
After a duel of eyes that Eggsy won hands down, Harry was forced to join him and they ate and talked about everything and nothing. Harry had not insisted on knowing the answer of the French secret service and Eggsy knew that he had not forgotten either. After dinner, the two men shared, as usual, their dessert on the big couch in front of a movie. Eggsy was happy because he had the choice of tonight’s film and he chose
He sketched a smile, knowing perfectly the meaning of such silence. Madeleine wouldn’t change and that was the confidence he needed when he knew he was leaving for this life, this adrenaline, that was what he was missing.
Sherlock stepped back without losing his guard. He did not know why but this "he" had made him feel a strange feeling.
He caught up Sherlock who was already out of the station, John was slightly out of breath and stopped Sherlock. The man looked at him with a look both empty and determined. He approached his lover slowly, who was still out of breath.
Marina turned to the man, with an inquisitive look. Both seemed to communicate like this, the new recruit could only observe them without really feeling invited. This exchange of glances seemed to last yet an eternity before Marina dares to break the silence.
"From the beginning, we've been knew." Q’s voice cut the silence between them. All turned to him. His tone was dry but feverish. He drank a sip of tea and changed a look with Eve.
"As always, it makes you wonder if she doesn’t feel anything for him. But, I take it." She sighed before shooting her cigarette. " I hate him for it."
Eggsy could only smile. He put his lips on his lover and engaged a kiss that quickly became languorous with desire. He was no longer thinking about the film, the bombings, or France, in his mind there was only Harry, the man of his life.
The subway was crowded, as always. However, at this time, there were not many people, it was rather between 7am and 9am, the big rush hour. Fiona had chosen to take the Piccadilly Line in Hammersmith, it was not better than taking the bus but no the choice. The closer we got to Piccadilly Circus, the more people there were.
Then if Guillaume had the "redemption" he hoped for, Marina continued to think that she should not have endangered her career to save him. He would have learned the lesson better. But the office needed him and needed the office, especially if he wanted to see his daughter, Prune, again. That was why he had agreed to share their discovery with Jonas, who had researched and provided the video surveillance of a woman named Irene Adler. Remained one last person that Marina wanted to inform before informing the management.
Very quickly, everything stopped. Fiona and Sarah too. Their tears froze as the bullet passed through their bodies already on the ground. It was the end, no one has ever seen that. Piccadilly Circus touched, in the distance, other dull noises had been heard. It was not Hyde Park, nor St Pancreas, it was the MI5 offices. A man had begged, begged all the gods that the man in the earpiece would not do it, but it was too late. The same noises, more amplified, the smoke suffocated the men and the sky. A huge hole was visible in the landscape and the tears of bystanders did not help. What exactly was going on ?
Marina nodded, it was not complicated for Hazel, she was a real born actress. She was as talented as Guillaume, which is surprising somewhere. But she was still far from perfect.
Raymond seemed to be getting better, but he was terribly tired. This reassured Marina, she knew that the hunt for Debailly and covering Jonas with Iodine 3 had been hard for him.
Mycroft continued to fix Sherlock who resumed his seriousness. He knew that when we spoke of Q, it was always tense. Always sensitive. Always complicated. All three held on to Q more than anything and even Eurus. Even if she only saw him from afar or in a covered way, he was his favorite.
The young stranger in the room stood up and she was beautiful, indeed. Her hair was slender, well in the flesh, pinned in a bun, and baby hairs were also pinned to her forehead. She was in her twenties and had a minimalist style that was too stylized for a DGSE officer. It was obvious that she was noticed with these many rings on her fingers. Her eyes were fixed on Marina, they were brown and gave her an intense look. It was almost fascinating.
"Here. Talking to yourself now? Although it turns out to be an excellent practice for mental health."
Mallory sketched a smile for Moneypenny, who gave it back to him and waved to Bill to turn to Mr. The relationship between Eve and Gareth really seemed to have improved. The two had come to know and even appreciate each other.
John and Sherlock were already a few meters away when a last sound was heard, the two looked at each other before turning back to the place from which the sound came. John opened his eyes and looked at Sherlock, who, the second he crossed his eyes, began to run. John followed him and the two stopped where they came from, Scotland Yard had been the victim of the last explosion.
Since these past events, there was a secret service was experiencing this remote collapse. The advantage was that they could think of strategies, look for help, move forward with the support and solicitation of the government. No, contrary to what you might think, it wasn’t MI6. The MI6 who was far too preoccupied with gathering the ashes of MI5, while managing his own problems. They were Saville Row’s luxury tailors. Harry Hart and Kingsman, 'the independents'' as Gareth Mallory liked to call them, were for once quiet and able to handle what others could not. Amazing, when we knew their agents had been through hell.
Sherlock sighed, it was hard to know what Eurus really thought because of the cold tone of her voice, but most of the time even though she was meticulously controlling her facial expressions, she was happy.
Four years, that’s right. It was a long time, four years trying to find a way to live peacefully together, to establish stability, to love each other, to make love. But also four years of thinking that retirement, while deserved, was boring. He should have been there, he should have experienced the attacks in London, the deaths of the MI5 agents with them. He backed away and looked at Madeleine before opening his suitcase to finish it.
"I see ... The cyberattacks. They affected his department." asked Sherlock as Eurus exchanged a look with his brother as if to read it. "He did not told me anything."
"My violin. It has already been checked. Thank you... Lea!" She nodded and had stars in her eyes when Sherlock said her name. After that, the two brothers went on their way.
When she was about to speak again but gets interrupted by a tall, slender, thin man with brown hair, tired features and grave eyes. It was him, Malotru.
"Thank you Greg, we'll be back to you soon. Say hello to Mycroft for me." John shouted before shaking his hand.
"I have her legendary file if you want, I can give it to you when you're done, I thought MJ gave it to you."
"You have not had a real consultation for some time now ... I know that these last days were complicated, and since your two failed missio ..."
She wanted to stop him, to ask him to be calm, to stop trying to avoid a confrontation by moving in all directions. Madeleine was not disappointed, she continued to watch it but this show began to tire her. She had managed to hold him off long enough since they heard about the attacks, but now James had snapped.
We don’t know yet. We were trying to put the sentences in order so that she could say something more meaningful." answered R with annoyance. She looked at the minion and gave him the signal to give the notebook to 006 who watched with calm Olympian Q in his maneuver.
"He’s in this room." Launched Greg by getting Sherlock and John into the room before the one who had the terrorist.
Little by little the Latin text was subtitled by the translation of each sentence. Bill began to read them aloud while waiting for a sign from Q, who carried his cup of tea to his mouth as if to tell him to start.
It was raining international tributes since the Queen spoke publicly to reassure the public. The government had planned a national tribute and MI6 had to stop its own activities to devote itself to it. The press took great pleasure in feeding both fear and hope, which meant that everyone had their opinion on the situation. The headline of the Sun read, 'Are we still safe today? '.
Goosebumps, thanks for reading ! If you have anything to tell, feel free to comment this post, i'll answer for sure ! Hope you've enjoyed this first chapter.
Eve sighed at Tanner. She stood back and watched Gareth Mallory glare at his Chief of Staff. Bill could only throw a discreet "Excuse me." before turning to Eve who raised her eyebrows as if to tell him she had warned him.
"Of course he needs help, dark fool. Even in the worst moments, you are not able to have an ounce of intelligence." spit out Sherlock by picking up Lestrade and moving him forward.
Lestrade and other policemen, including Sally who had not left him, and experts exchanged with Sherlock before he entered the room. Sherlock had nothing against all that heavy atmosphere, he could deal with it. He felt all of John’s benevolence with him through his eyes so it had to be okay.
It was necessary to admit that Dr. Balmes was of a great help, like all the military doctors but she was also very intrusive. It was strange because she was extremely respectful towards the entire team. She was the one who insisted on taking care of all the agents.
The two men began to walk towards the building. They had not seen each other for some time. Both were far too busy and Sherlock was solving cases that people would leave him on his blog or via Twitter to pass the time and ignore Mycroft.
"Are you worried about our brother? You see Mycroft, I would like to help you but I still can not see him, since you've forbidden me."
No one imagined that action and words would eventually merge. It left a bitter taste in Mr. He thought that the person who orchestrated this triple attack was certainly the same person who had been harassing Q-Branch for a month. He had heard from MI5, their numbers were definitely reduced. The country’s internal security was compromised and the losses were substantial.
"Rocambole, you will be in charge of Hazel’s training at the Bureau. Malotru will be able to assist you in this task if necessary, he will be Hazel’s chief reference in her mission." Marie-Jeanne added.
Hazel looked at them without understanding, and their glances simultaneously posed on the young woman before Marina shot her to chase Guillaume Debailly.
He was almost offended that so many people came to watch these buildings burn. Scotland Yard had arrived a few minutes ago and had already begun to secure the streets. They knew the firefighters were on their way to Piccadilly Circus, too. He had first passed through the premises of MI5, virtually all of Scotland Yard had been mobilized for. And when there wasn’t enough people for St Bartholomew Hospital, it was the off-duty police officers who took their services to get there and secure the premises. But, Mycroft had expressly asked him to go through St Barts' before visiting the teams placed in Piccadilly and Greg would prefer by experience not to oppose her husband.
"She's fine, Guillaume is working on it too, I get the feeling that at two it's going faster and she's learning fast." Marina smiled at her as she finished her sentence.
He delayed his business to come to the young woman. Once in front of her, his hands stroked her cheeks with infinite tenderness. For her, he was doomed. The two had loved each other, but as the love faded, and their routine, which had taken place when the two had moved to Switzerland, he bore it less and less. It had finally reached its climax during the holidays they were on in Jamaica. In the end, the two had nothing but affection for each other. Bond had come to understand that he loved Madeleine but was not in love with her.
"You’re in deep shit." He said in a cold tone before looking at his colleagues. " Take him. I want to have him a little bit before the intelligence takes it away."
It was strange how a person could come into your life and change everything, destroy everything without warning. But if Rocambole had returned from Iran, or rather, had been removed from Iran, it was also for this reason. Every time she stepped into the office, something was going on, and there she felt something was going to happen.
The fascination was present on the faces of passers-by who came to hurry to try to see the scene, the dead, the police securing the place. All this, this morbid voyeurism, this fascination with horror, Greg Lestrade didn’t understand it as much as he could understand it.
"He had the opportunity to work with her, it seems that she is quite surprising. I don't know what she did to him, but he loves her."
"Thank you Rim. The UCP program has been affiliated with the BDL, so the Bureau is in charge of its new clandestines. UCP is a program of surveillance and espionage, but also of alliance and aid." continued Colonel MAG looking at Marina who was totally focused.
John is confused by Sherlock's reaction for a full second before he replays what he said in his head and feels himself blushing hard, "Ah! No, I didn't mean that. I mean I would like to. Eventually. But-uh-,I mean-" he's floundering for the right words, absolutely lost in his mortification at how rude he just sounded.
He gets out of bed and slips on his pajama bottoms, still too warm and too sensitive to put on any other clothes.
"Brilliant." John smiles at Sherlock and is pleased to see the return of the blush on Sherlock's cheeks. He reaches up a hand from under the covers to touch the pink skin high on Sherlock's cheekbones. "Are you going to blush everytime I compliment you now?"
"Good evening John." Sherlock's voice is impossibly deep and husky and John is simply too stunned to speak.
A short while later he wakes to a quiet tapping sound. Disoriented at first, he remembers he's at his sister's. It's clearly the wee hours and then he hears it again. A tapping against the sliding glass door to the backyard.
"Still. I haven't said and I would like to let you know John that I've been in love with you since the first time we met as well."
Sherlock listens to him with a placid look, sipping his tea. He waits until John finishes what he has to say before setting his tea down and responding, "Then when did you know? When did you want...?" He trails off before finishing firmly, "When did you want?"
Sherlock reaches out a hand and touches John on his cheek. John is solid and warm. Sherlock pulls his hand back slowly. "But. You're dead," he says dumbly.
Sherlock for his part is equally startled and looks at John helplessly, "I'm not sure. I told you. I had a fever this morning and then I
John gives a rueful laugh, "Yeah, we are. But that's another reason we're here, now, talking. We have an option."
John sets his coffee down and steps to Sherlock pressing their bodies together, "Bed does make more sense. Best idea you've ever had." John reaches up and places a soft kiss on Sherlock's lips.
Their kisses go on for a while and then John shifts and presses himself down into the hard bulge in Sherlock's trousers and it's like a fire has been lit in his veins. Their kisses deepen and Sherlock begins nipping at Johns lips and- oh! John likes very much being snogged within an inch of his life by the world's most observant man.
And then Sherlock looks down to his mouth and then slowly back up to his eyes. And John must telegraph how open he would be to such a gesture, because Sherlock leans in.
John looks down at his smaller hands in Sherlock's larger ones. He grips Sherlock's hands tightly and looks up into Sherlock's face, meets Sherlock's eyes with his own moist ones, and watches as Sherlock gives him the biggest smile he's ever seen before whispering, "Thank you."
Sherlock blinks at him and makes a small frown with his mouth, confusion clearly painting his features, "Why do I love you? Because..." Sherlock's eyes look around the room like he'll find the answer written on the walls. He does that a moment and then locks eyes on John again, "Because I do. Because of everything you...are. To me."
"But that doesn't matter now, because now we have each other in our arms and we both know how the other feels."
"Well, not consciously. I mean looking back on it," John leans back in his chair and scratches at his chin idly, avoiding eye contact with Sherlock, "I suppose I was attracted to you, physically. You've always been handsome to me. Beautiful even, sometimes. But, that night, I hadn't been saved by you yet. Going along with you, to a crime scene and then dinner, at that point, it was all still a bit of a lark to me. So, no, really, I hadn't been asking you out."
"Ah, so you say, but yet you spend all your time following me around, babying me, and generally mooning after me."
"So. I may have an idea of what happened to you. Granted it's been nearly 20 years, but I believe I may have heard a case of something similar in class. I'll have to look it up, but, yeah."
Eventually he reaches his destination and it's as he expected. The water is mostly frozen with a bit of overflow on the far side where the sun hits most of the day. The grass around the pool is brown and dead. There are no flowers. No sign of life at all, save for himself.
within your power to try and make me happy and all I kept doing was hurting you. So I did the only thing I could think of and left."
What's the point? Why does he keep torturing himself like this? He should just leave. It'll be better for both of them.
They finish and set their cups aside and John leans forward to carefully place a hand on Sherlock's knee. "So, where were we?"
He can feel the swelling of his belly has stopped and he feels the sensation of a baby moving inside him. He rubs at his taut belly and then moves his hand lower until he can shove his trousers and pants down and grasp his cock. He gives a few strong tugs and then slides his hand lower, but startles with the shock of what he finds. Distracted by all the other sensations of his body he hadn't felt the very distinct change to his anatomy. Behind his cock and balls is a new opening into his body. He sticks his hand back down and wishes he could see the new change to himself but exhausted and aroused as he is he can hardly stand to find a mirror; an exploration by touch will have to suffice for now.
After a couple of moments kissing silently, enjoying the intimate press of each other, they separate.
"I would be delighted to share my bed with you tonight." Sherlock says this with an exgerrated posh tone, before continuing much more sincerely, " I'd much rather have you near as well."
What can he write? Their most recent case wasn't terribly exciting and the only other thing that occupies his thoughts is Sherlock.
John's face does multiple things at once but settles into a softly fond expression and he smiles, "Of course. You're my best friend."
John levels his gaze at him, "I can think of a few reasons to be concerned. Cats carry more than just rabies, Sherlock."
"From the account I read, you'll likely experience a quicker fight or flight response, a more possessive take on things you perceive as yours, supposedly a craving for more meat in your diet, and an increased need for attention. Though of course all of this is for one person told from the perspective of another. We can't be sure how much of this was unique to her and how much of this is common to cat people in general."
Which is how things are when Christmas finally rolls around. Sherlock had spent most of the month of December sulking and complaining that Christmas was a pointless holiday (Really, John knew he loved it because of all the fairy lights and baubles and whatnot. No, what he really disliked was that the number of violent crimes and murders went down and the incidences of petty theft and simple assault went up.)
John gives a gusty sigh laced with fondness, his eyes go impossibly soft as he searches Sherlock's face. He carefully moves his hand from Sherlock's waist and very slowly, almost hesitantly, places it on Sherlock's face, cupping his jaw. "Is this okay?"
- he'll be able to have John's child. He's not sure how he'll explain his sudden ability to conceive a child, but he's also not even sure this'll work so, whatever.
John sits impaled on Sherlock's lap and can feel tears coming to his eyes as Sherlock relentlessly strokes his cock with one hand and his nipples with the other. He's so stimulated. It's a painful pleasure.
John catches a glimpse of what looks like bags and bags of items in Sherlock's arms. John is curious, but figures Sherlock will show him what he bought if he wants John to know.
He had snapped at him and stomped off to his room. He didn't come out until dinner and John had wisely let the topic drop.
I'm not saying you didn't hurt me, but you were a net good in my life and we could have worked together to fix our problems. You thought leaving was the best option? You coward.
Sherlock clasps his hands together and looks down at them, "I-I don't know what to do next," he laughs wryly.
Dinner is a delicious affair and they sit around the fire for a bit sharing stories: Bethany and Harry telling John funny stories of gift shopping and John of Sherlock. Eventually it gets late and they all decide to go to bed.
John wasn't sure if the feeling in him at that moment was intense embarrassment, anger for having that flung in his face, or sadness that Sherlock could be so callous about his feelings. Probably a combination of all three.
John throws his hands up and grabs Sherlock's upper arms, but just holds on and doesn't push him away. He's kissing Sherlock back before he remembers that he's mad at the git and they're not in a relationship, at least that he's aware of. He gently pulls his head back, but he doesn't release his grip.
Sherlock gives him a wary look, "You've been off and on giving me forlorn looks whenever I'm with Rosie. I'm not sure you realize you're doing it."
It is a man in his 40s, fairly fit, but not someone who works out regularly. His profession keeps him trim.
Perhaps Sherlock was right to 'delete' all his knowledge of space, because all John can do is make ridiculous comparisons in his head. John is here and Sherlock is the closest star. The time separating them is too vast, John will die before he ever reaches him.
Sherlock blinks multiple times and turns bright pink. He looks away from John and, to his own mortification, begins purring quietly which only makes him turn a brighter shade of red. He puts his face into his hands and gives another groan at his body's betrayal of his inner emotions.
"John, I love you." Sherlock leans forward and kisses John soundly on the mouth. The kiss is passionate, but he quickly leans back, "Also, we're idiots."
The fungus is aiming their gaze right at John's face and Sherlock watches as John smiles lazily up at Sherlock, encouraging him.
Standing in the back yard is Sherlock. He's forgotten his hat again and John can see the way his breath curls out with every exhale.
This gets Sherlock's attention. He sits straight up, his ears perked and his tail lashing agitatedly. "Where are you going?"
Sherlock freezes looking guilty as anything, his newest appendages reflecting a sense of contriteness as they curl and press into him.
"I only got involved with Mary because at first I needed to get over you and after you came back I wanted to hurt you for hurting me. If anything I'm the one who has taken everything you've loved.
Sherlock smiles back, licks his lips, takes a deep breath and says in a quiet voice, "You're beautiful too, you know."
"Are almost entirely focused on the chemical changes which occur, and not on the actual physical and behavioral changes you can expect. It's interesting and definitely worth a read, but not valuable to the day-to-day. Which is why I already emailed you the links and you can peruse them on your own. However, I went ahead and read the book and made a small list of things to expect. You can read the book too, but given its flowery language and your general demeanor, I thought you'd prefer me to summarize."
He looks in the mirror one last time before turning around, flicking off his lamp, and heading down the stairs.
"It's true we're older now. Older then when we first met for sure and only made older by all that we've been through. However, I don't think we're too old for this. Quite the contrary, I feel young in my love for you.
He feels something soft brush against his leg and startles. He's weak from whatever that pain was, but he still manages to scramble to a seated position up against the wall. He looks down between his legs and realises there is a long, black tail leading from his backside. He stares at it and it twitches. He feels the twitch. He realises it's a part of him.
John lifts Sherlock's hand to his lips and gives it a kiss as his eyes well with happiness and spill over. He cradles Sherlock's hand back against his chest.
John's eyebrows go up a tick. Sherlock usually just decides through whatever deductions that John isn't okay. He rarely ever actually asks. John wonders what Sherlock expects him to say.
