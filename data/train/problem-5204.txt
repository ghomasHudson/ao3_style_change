Hours later, it was starting to get dark outside and Thor felt a little cold in this winter evening, but it wasn’t surprising, he only had a black sweatshirt to keep him warm after all.
If you read all that, contragulation, you are now like my friends, able to listen to my infinite rants about everything and nothing at all.
Okay so I spent a bad day, my cat is sick and it's ugly, and if he dies I'm killing my dad (kidding. I'll just yell  A LOT because it's him who doesn't want to bring him to the vet) but anyway i'll just keep calm because I have other things to worry about and really Sarah have some perspective at least you're not secretly dying from Palladium poisoning. And your dad is not a god planet who wants to dominate the universe. and you little brother isn't loki (oh god that would be so exhausting but amazing at the same time but mainly exhausting so I'll keep my little demonic blond nerd thank you) or other bad things that happen to superheroes.
But he didn’t care at all. It was Loki’s sixth birthday in today and he would not give him another shitty drawing. He wanted to see his brother smile this time. He wanted to give him something his brother would love, and in order to do that, he needed money.
Anyway, as you can see, I didn't publish the natasha thing yet... Because I can't find the time to write with all those orals to prepare ! I have four of them in spanish and three and a half in english ! It's for the first week of june ! I am going to diiiieeee ! But at the same time I don't want to abandon you guys, and writing makes me forget about all the stress, so I'll try my best to give you one chapter a day, or every two days. Sounds okay with you all ?
Meanwhile, Thor wasn't paying attention. His eyes were on Bucky's. The soldier was standing in the shadows, listening to their conversation, and he looked utterly destroyed as he stared back at the god, silently pleading him not to reveal his presence.
Sometimes, Steve wondered if the genius loved Steve or Captain America, and if he wasn't just another trophy for Tony. However, he quickly dismissed the thought. It didn't matter anyway, he loved Tony. If the inventor only loved one side of him back, it was alright, it was already more than nothing.
Anyway see ya tomorow, I'm sorry about chapter 8 and I'm sorry about Steve having fucked up so badly and I'm sorry the hate on Steve upsetted me a little, it shouldn't have but I'm emotional ^^"
And you probably don't care, because it's Steve's chapter, but hey, please, remember. He's not okay. Plus, after chapter 10 you get chapter 11, and chapter 11 contains bucky cuteness and Thor overprotectiveness and uuuh Tasha protecting Tony and uuh yeah other things. Bruce I guess. Don't remember what he does in that chapter, he is quiet for the moment and will have a stronger role later.
PS : Wanda and Pietro may seem very much older than five years old to you, but remember that they have been raised by their parents to be independent kids, capable of looking after each other and themselves ^^
Bucky still refused to look up. He felt so guilty, Tony's black eyed face and sad eyes refused to leave his mind.
One day, Bucky doesn’t truly know when, Clint had come in during one of Thor’s stories. At first, the super soldier hadn’t known who it was, because the archer had stayed silent. Then, at the end of his story, Thor had greeted him.
XD speaking of puppy eyes, you're gonna love chapter 14... Or maybe not. Ok no more spoilers I always spoil everything.
Bucky's grey eyes darkened as he went quiet for a few seconds, staring at the white wall in front of him. He looked troubled and confused.
“I called to tell you to never get close to Bucky again. You triggered his flashback today. It's your fault. Always has been.”
Bruce's expression was cold, and annoyed. But there was a spark, something in the man's gaze. There, in the genius' eyes, was a hint of concern.
Oh. He must have had a blackout for a few seconds. He didn't even remember what had triggered the flood of memories.
“But I’m sleeping” Replied Steve in a monotone voice. He didn’t want to go, but he knew he had to. Bruce never gave up.
The door was kicked open and in less than a second, an utterly terrified Clint was grabbing his arms and looking him in the eyes.
Bucky just kept staring at him, expression blank. They had made plans in case the Winter Soldier came back ? He felt like he should have been angry, or defensive, but it only made him feel safer, somehow.
So I wanted to tell you that from now on I will announce the next chapter's title in the end notes and I will probably post everyday around the same hour as right nowe, and that (WARNING FROM NOW ON ALL THIS IS A RANT OF PURE SPOILERS) the avengers will show up in chapter 7. I know, it's a long time to wait, but I swear it's worth it, coz, you know, so much angst.
A sudden wave of pure fear went through the boy and he ran to his sister’s room as a huge noise, like a whistle, resounded through the garden and towards the house. Before Pietro knew it, an explosion had occurred in his parents’ bedroom.
Steve had not understood why this man had chosen to work in an orphanage, because he clearly hated children. The blond had often been worried that the man would hit or even kill one of them.
AH AH WHO THINKS HE IS DEAD AND HOW THINKS HE'S STILL ALIVE ? BECAUSE I KNOW AND I WILL NOT TELL YOU ! Clint will. Next chapter is from his pov. He gets Pietro feels from Bucky running amongst robots to Save another hero. Yeah it's gonna be ugly. I wish I could bring pietro back but.. maybe in another fic. Wanda isn't even in that one. (too much characters, I'm sorry I can't handle everyone I'm not an infinity war writer (yet, I'll get there one day) )
“No. No it's okay. Stay.” Tony told Bucky, not looking the soldier in the eye. “Steve's not here, it's okay.” He then mumbled under his breath, staring at the broken cup again.
“Steve woke up and unplugged himself from the heart monitor. Clint thought he was dead and ran into the room. I don’t know what happened in there, I left them alone as there was no emergency.”
The blond felt the Soldier lift him on his feet. The Asset was carrying more than half of his weight, but it was still too heavy for Steve.
There was a short silence during which both men just looked at the city below. People down there looked like ants from up here. It made Bucky realize once again how insignificant he was. His life is so short, and there are so many things he cannot do, so many things people made him do. He, Bucky Barnes, is insignificant, so insignificant that his body was turned into a weapon and his mind, almost erased.
Bucky frowned. He didn't want to leave the inventor alone, and it didn't look like anyone was spending time with him these days. They might be all worried about him, but he didn't see anyone making him food or coming to the workshop to check on him.
Tony took a seat on the chair that had been put next to the bed, and sighed. Seriously, Bucky had to choose the ONLY week when Steve wasn't available. And now he was stuck here, waiting for...
The most shocking thing he discovered, though, was that Steve had left those bruises. Or well, the other Avengers believed it was Steve. Bucky would investigate by himself later. He didn't really want to confront Steve, because if it wasn't Steve, it would hurt his boyfriend's feeling that Bucky doubted him like that.
“Truth is… Even if I spent the last two months trying to get him to socialize, to connect, to understand that I care about him… I don’t know if I can do it. He doesn’t seem to react to anything. He is either numb or full of pain and anger, and in both cases whatever I say just doesn’t seem to… Reach him at all.”
Now something was wrong. He knew the blond had gone silent these past months, but when someone called for him, he usually replied instead of hiding.
Bucky opened his mouth, and closed it. He was still pressed against Thor and he felt protected, accepted even in his vulnerability. He felt like a little brother.
There was a short silence during which Tony just stared at the supersoldier, wary eyes full of unreadable emotions. And then, he slipped the mask back on.
All he could think of was 'Survive. Survive. Survive.' And he wasn't thinking that to himself, no. He was thinking that to the Winter Soldier, to Bucky.
If anyone wants to contact me because they want to help me with this story (like, giving me their opinion on what happens and pointing out consistency mistakes) my mail is in my profile ^^ if you're lazy just write "a single man tear" at the end of your comment and I will put my mail at the end of my reply ^^
Bruce looked at the supersoldier’s face. His blue eyes were dull and dry, his mouth closed and resigned.
Steve opened his eyes. The light blinded him and hurt him for a few seconds, but he kept them open. He didn't really know why, but hurting himself felt good, in a twisted way.
Hey everyone, guess what, I'm exhausted. That's what I get from going to sleep at 2am. Go to sleep early, kids. Grown ups too, actually.
He opened the door with a scowl on his face and glared at the stranger. However as soon as Loki recognized him, his eyes widened and he called Steve again.
As I write this, there are 471 hits, 29 kudos, and 11 comments on this fanfic.  I can't even describe how happy I am to see this ! Thank you ! Thank you so much !
“Brother !” Thor cried as he ran to Bucky, falling on his knees next to the soldier and gripping the soldier's shoulders, starting to pull him into a hug.
I am slowly preparing Loki's arrival. And I'm wondering... Do I do it the funny way, or the dramatic way ? Or both ? What do you all think ? Don't forget to comment, it's the comments that keep me going you know !
Steve shook his head no, feeling his eyes watering. How fucking weak. Couldn't he stop crying for a minute ?! He wasn't the victim here ! Tony was. Bucky was.
He hadn't been able to sleep that night after fleeing Clint's floor silently. JARVIS had taken him there when he had asked where the others were, instead of answering him. Bucky had decided to step out of the elevator and go see what everyone was doing on one of the other's private floor.
Another child walked down the stairs, and after a few seconds Steve heard Clint whisper something, but all he could make out was ‘Tony Stark’.
Bucky stood right in front of Tony now. It had been a while since they had been that close. The last time was when he woke up. Even when they had played mario kart together Tony had sat as far away as he could. He extended his metal arm to put the ice on the genius' eye.
“Oh no I was just surprised, since he is hm.” Tony paused, eyeing him carefully. Bucky understood before Stark told him. “He is dead. I try not to think about him too much.” Bucky frowned slightly. New Stark was lying about the reason why he didn't want to talk about his father.
Why did it have to be so complicated ? Why did Tony have to hate Bucky ? Why was this Steve's life ? Having to protect one of his loves from the other...
Memories of the fight sounded in his head. The explosions. The Winter Soldier’s shouts, his demand for him to stay awake.
“I try to include him in team activities, but he always finds a way out of it. He doesn’t even try to make any excuses, he… Oh Bucky, I don’t think our Steve is there at all, not anymore. It’s like… It’s like he died. Like we killed him. Or maybe he killed himself. No, that’s not it. We… We made him kill himself.”
“You'll stay with me ?” He asked, really hoping the answer would be yes, but he knew Steve wanted him to handle it on his own.
When Tony hung up the phone, he knew this was only the beginning of Pepper's wrath. Someone had hurt him, and she didn't care if it was Captain America. He just hoped she wouldn't tell Rhodey. Rhodey fucking loved Cap, she wouldn't do that to him. Right ?
Steve tried to open his mouth to sob, maybe apologize, but water filled his mouth and suddenly he was very aware of the fact that he couldn’t breathe.
“What ?” Barton asked. Bucky was about to repeat what he just said when he felt a hand clap on his back, making the soldier in him flinch and prepare to fight. “Of course we're not afraid of you, Barnes ! Why would we ? We'd see it if it was the Winter Soldier in the room, and we would handle it. Tasha and I made plans to contain him if he ever came back, but really, since Tony made the tech that cured you, I don't think he will ever come back, and that was a LOT of talking help me out Nat I think I broke him.”
“Bruce, it happened five minutes ago, and Steve is a supersoldier, I told them he could wait for you, who knows his medical file by heart, to get there.” deadpanned Natasha. The physicist could see she was really tired of everyone’s shit.
“No Tony, I cannot be certain. There are good chances that he will make a full recovery, but only because he was injected with a serum similar to Steve’s. However he was as heavily injured - if not more - as Steve, and his healing abilities were badly affected by the number and severity of the injuries, and as a result, functioned with a lot less efficiency. If Bucky’s healing abilities did the same, well…” Steve. Something was not right. “It may take,” Steve.” Hum, a long time for him to recover, if he ever does. However we shouldn’t forget that he is lucky to be a supersoldier. He would be dead otherwise.” Bruce told them as he grew more and more anxious of the well being of the other supersoldier.
It killed Steve to say all that. But it was necessary. It was for Bucky's safety, because Tony must hate him : Bucky stole his parents, and his lover. Who wouldn't hate someone who did that to them ? Tony was a threat to Bucky. Tony wasn't even getting that hurt, because Tony never loved him, he loved Captain America. Captain America was a prize for the inventor, the hero from the past that Howard surely never stopped telling his son about. Tony would never have loved him back then when he was just a kid from Brooklyn.
“Oh. Thought you were older. Hold this.” His daddy extended a gloved hand that was holding a smoking test tube. Eager to help, Tony grabbed it and...
It had been a month since Steve hit Tony. A month since Steve Rogers had stopped opening his mouth for something other than strategy or what was necessary. He gave short answers, and his voice stayed quiet. Ironman and Black Widow had taken the lead of the team, and no one had discussed it. Thor had been offered the post but the Prince had refused, saying that it would spoil his fun while in battle. A month since everyone on the team started being cold and distant with him. Well except for Clint. Clint was aggressive. The archer spit his venom on the supersoldier at any given occasion.
Suicide attempt. A lot of blood. Self harm. Please do not read if you are easily triggered, and if you get triggered, you can talk to me, I will listen and help you the best I can ^^
“Sir, I believe Captain Rogers is not feeling well” JARVIS informed Tony as he shot robot after robot. Those things were weak, it was ridiculous, however there was so many of them that they still constitued a huge threat for the city.
PS : THERE IS A MUSIC VIDEO TO GO WITH THIS CHAPTER ! PLEASE LISTEN TO IT IT IS NOT POPULAR ENOUGH : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk22HeEDbuE
The door opened a few seconds later, and he heard light footsteps heading to the bed, before he felt Natasha's weight on the bed as she sat next to him.
And I know. Angst. So much angst. But you're addicts and Natasha centered fics are quite rare so I know most of you are interested. x) (or maybe im wrong and you don't care)
“Bucky, this is important. You need to know that you're not a prisoner here, you can get your own place.”
Bucky looked at his left arm and smirked. He could always say that his arm hurt. He didn't want to cry wolf though.
Bruce didn’t answer, and Clint looked at his phone. “Yup, she just sent a text, she’ll be there in less than an hour ! When do we start making cookies by the way ? Because now they sure as hell won’t be ready for when Natasha arrives… Maybe we can wait for her to get here and bake them with her, they’ll taste even better !”
“Listen Steve, I know it has only be two days of this new thing, but if you want us to give you another chance, you should stop drowning in self pity. Maybe do something to fix your mistakes, I don't know. Have you appologized yet ?”
There were robot killers everywhere, in the streets, in the sky, both in and on the buildings. He couldn't quite figure out what was happening. Someone told him to go fight somewhere, he went there. Everything was so confused. He hit robot after robot, but it didn't make any sense.  His vision kept going black for a few seconds and then coming back to almost normal, only to do it again.
So here he was, Tony Stark, behind the one-sidded glass, refusing to let his ex-boyfriend's BFF wake up alone.
It had started the day Thaddeus Ross had arrived at the orphanage. He had presented himself and then declared that he had heard about a smart boy being up for adoption here.
Steve seemed then to finally truly look at him, and to see the damage he's done. His furious expression turned into a horrified one, tears filling his eyes. “I'm sorry” He breathed, and he fled the room, leaving the inventor laying on the floor, covered in forming bruises.
Yeah I know that title sucks. I don't know, it just sounds so stupid.. But I can't think of any better title. Tomorow when you'll read it you're welcome to try and think of a better one :)
“JARVIS, scan.” Said Tony, voice trembling. He had taken off the faceplate and was kneeling next to the supersoldier's heads. His eyes were wide and full of fears.
“I can't eat all this.” He protested weakly. He knew he was inferior to them now. He was barely tolerated by Bruce Natasha and Clint, and the others avoided him.
The night was going to be beautiful. It was a shame they weren’t old enough to stay up and watch the stars. Their dad promised them to let them watch once they reached ten years old.
Clint was about to push a little more, ask another question about what was bothering his best friend so much that she, of all people, had stopped paying attention to her surroundings, when the Avengers Alarm went off.
When they entered their home, they were greeted by the warm smell of their diner and the welcoming smile of their mother, who asked them about their day. Pietro was very happy to tell her everything about the games in the parc and school, but he chose not to tell her about the policeman. He wasn’t sure if he had done something wrong or not, and he didn’t want to risk not having dessert.
Tony was curled up against one wall of the corridor, shaking, eyes and cheeks wet with tears, and his breathing was jerky. He wasn't really there. Thor knew that look, he had seen it on way too many warriors : his brother of iron was stuck in terrible memories.
One the other side, there was Tony. His charismatic mask that hid a caring but scarred heart and a mind more brilliant than anyone could imagine. There was the man who dared show him his true self and trusted him more than he trusted anyone.
Lunch passed, and the kid didn’t appear to be hungry since he didn’t buy himself anything and just kept going through shops. Tony couldn’t stop to buy something for himself either as he would instantly lose the kid. So he kept following him, and ignored his hunger.
‘Black eye, three broken ribs.’ Replied Natasha’s icy voice as Tony kept looking him right in the eye as he started crying before disappearing in the darkness too.
The men frowned. What was on Natasha’s mind didn’t seem like ‘nothing much’ at all. She had looked very worried, actually.
He didn't have to wait too long. Merely an hour later the supersoldier was standing in his workshop, looking a little lost. He was looking around at all the robots and screens and Tony could see the confusion and wonder in his eyes. Bucky was way too cute, it almost hurt to look at something so perfect. Just as the thought went through the genius' head, Bucky's eyes narrowed on him, and for a moment the inventor seriously feared that Barnes had mind reading habilities he never told anyone about.
“ JARVIS took me there when I asked where the others were. Steve told me to socialize and make friends. I was just trying to spend time with you guys.” Bucky mumbled, voice quiet. Something about Thor made him want to trust him, he felt protected and entirely accepted, which was weird since it was their first conversation.
WARNING : I think that Cap not eating is considered anorexia ? Yep, he's captain self destructive right now.
“I TOLD YOU NOT TO GET CLOSE TO HIM ! I TOLD YOU NOT TO TALK TO HIM ! YOU WILL NOT HURT HIM” Steve kicked him in the ribs. “YOU CANT HURT BUCKY ! HE IS EVERYTHING TO ME”
“I found an interesting one in Sokovia. The name is Pietro Maximoff. Five years old. Twin sister is worthless. I recommend killing her and the parents, and then get the boy.”
Oh and Bucky won't be "Steve's Bucky" when he wakes up. He will be... Someone else, well.. I don't know how to explain, chapter.. 5 I think ? Deals with that. And chapter 9 proves it too.
“Pepper ! No ! Don't do this ! It's not like that ! Oh god pepper do not kill captain america and do not kill me i swear i didn't mean to keep that from you ! I just forgot !”
So, are you a ghost or a living human being ? If you are the latter, prove it please by commenting, subscribing, and leaving kudos :) I swear we reply to each and every comment <3
The blond thief came running down the stairs. Tony crossed his arms, ready to look as mad as he could even though all the anger had left him a long time ago, if there ever was any.  The boy quickly noticed the man in the doorway, who was looking slightly angry, even if his eyes stated otherwise. The kid’s face turned blank and then guilty afraid and ashamed as he recognized the man.
“Hold that for me would you ?” Tony and his daddy were in the workshop. Tony was not allowed in if he wasn't useful, so he offered to hold things and clean things and do all that. When he had nothing to do, he could observe and learn, as long as he stayed away and he didn't make a sound.
Bucky nodded. He felt like Thor was treating him like some sort of kid... But it wasn't really that. He could not find the word, but Thor was acting strangely. He was pretty sure Steve would have mentionned it if Thor had a big brother thing going on.
“He’s coming right now.” He announced, holding onto Bucky’s hand with even more energy. “I truly hope you are waking up, Buck.” He murmured.
Tony actually cringed at that one. Thank god he decided to train and try a few things out before actually going to talk to the soldier.
It was more like, these past few months, and they both knew it, but neither of them really wanted to acknowledge it. The redhead sat beside him on the couch, and put a gentle hand on his shoulder.
“Well my name is Ivan Vanko, and I am with the police, so you actually should answer, kid. Your mama would want you to.”
Thor walked around until he found an art shop. He went in, chose a book that read “learn to draw mythical creatures” and another that read “how to draw for beginners”. Then he took a whole pile of drawing paper and some pencils as well as an eraser.
PPS : and do not hate on me for Cap's farewell, you don't even know what's gonna happen yet ! x)) Hate one me later, children, when you will have truly suffered x) *drinks tea made of your tears*
He didn’t know if he really wanted to go in now. If the caretaker learned that the boy had stolen something, he might write it on the kid’s file and then the boy would see his chances of getting adopted drop.
“You. The Target is not able to fight right now. The Target's energy levels are too low due to lack of sleep and food. Mission : protect. Target's status : too weak to fight. The Asset recommend for the Target to step inside and find shelter while the Asset fights any threat coming too close.”
“JARVIS, you heard her.” Said Tony. He trusted the spy with his life. If she said the Winter Soldier was safe for now, he trusted her. The question was, how and when did she find out ?
Thirdly, I think it's not going to have any effect even if I beg you not to want to murder Steve. You're going to anyway, if you don't want it already.
That being said, you might have a good surprise tomorow if I get inspired tonight and write a lot, which have 60% chances of happening. It increases with the positive reviews I get because yes, honest compliments will get you anywhere you want with me, I know, I'm so weak.
Steve stood up, feeling his throat tighten. The choice he had just made resembled the one that led him there in nothing : it was not hard at all, and was made for others, not himself ; but it did not mean that it was less painful.
“Who’s it then ? Tony ? Steve ? I hope you’re not worried about Natasha ‘cause that’d be ridiculous, you know that mission Fury sent her on is like a vacation for her. She’s supposed to come back in like, half an hour anyway.”
He drank as much as he could. He didn't know one could feel so thirsty. Steve decided to ignore how good it felt to have Clint's hand on his, stabilizing his grip on the glass.
“Brother of Winter ? What's wrong ?” Thor tried to whisper, but he was never good at being quiet, and the man winced.
“YOU !” Tony took a few steps back, dropping the bottle, letting it shatter on the floor. Steve forced himself to take a few steps forward. “YOU WERE ALWAYS THE PROBLEM ! I NEVER WANTED TO DATE YOU !”
On top of that, Bucky still hadn’t woken up, except from a change of heartbeat from time to time. The other Avengers still avoided Steve like the plague, but at least Clint had stopped being cruel. Steve wondered why, but he wasn’t about to look a gift horse in the mouth.
How could they have come to this ? How could they do something so cruel to a member of their team ? Of their family ? All of this out of anger ?
Sad blue eyes that had seen horrors most people couldn’t even imagine, more blood and tears that needed to fill an ocean, more smoke and embers than necessary to burn the whole world, revealed themselves to the room, diving into brown, intelligent but clouded by anger ones.
“Winter Soldier, can you hear me ? All of the robots are coming to you and Cap. Now I don't know how badly injured Cap is, but if he can't run, do not risk carrying him to safety, do you hear me ? You hide him under the rubble, you run towards safety, and we hope the robots get distracted by you. Do not try to carry him.”
He swallowed and looked at Bruce, who seemed to enjoy his pancakes quite a lot. He had a bowl full of apple slices next to it, and when he noticed Steve looking, he pushed it closer to the blond. The soldier took a slice to be polite.
And then Tony's eyes widened comically and finding himself speechless as he opened his mouth once, twice, and a third time before finally talking.
“Oh no, this one you love ! Because he is Captain fucking America and he can hit his boyfriend if he wants to !”
“By the way, anyone knows why they broke up ? Is it because of Bucky ?” Questionned Bruce, and it seemed like he already had his opinion on that.
Now, a comment, kudos, bookmark, whatever to make me know you exist and you want me to keep going, is very much appreciated, really, it makes me smile one of those dumb smiles that won't go off your face no matter how hard you try ^^"
If only Bucky was there to comfort him. But he didn't deserve it after what he had done to Tony, and he hadn't seen the other supersoldier last night anyway. His lover had never come to bed. Bucky probably already knew.
Bruce would also ask him if he wanted to spend an evening or an afternoon with him once a week. They would play cards, talk, watch movies, order something or cook together.
“You need to get yourself together, Steve. Manage your emotions.” With that, Bruce stood up and left the room.
So Tony and Steve used to date... Bucky frowned. Steve never told him that. However it would explain the tension between the two. But did Tony know that Bucky and Steve were together ? The two supersoldier wanted to stay private about it, out of habit. Back in the 40s, their relationship had to stay a secret, it was a matter of survival.
Bucky breathed in, and out. Now, he talks to Tony, tells him the truth, and he avoids fucking up or running away. That's going to be hard. But rule one, fake it 'til you make it.
However, he was apparently still too loud, because everyone in the room tensed, their eyes darkening in anger.
Tony was late. Again. And as always, he did not give a shit. They could all go to hell with this business shit. He just wanted to invent things not manage the whole selling them thing, it just bored him to death and wasted his time, time he could use to make better computers and phones. Or maybe he should try putting that AI in his hair dryer, it seemed like a funny idea.
He turned his head to talk to the girl running after him. “Wanda ! Catch me if you can !” He was smiling with assurance, but when he saw his sister laughing face turn into a scared one, looking at something over his shoulder, he turned back to look where he was going, but too late.
“Your brainwashed Hydra assassin self killed my mom.” The brown haired man finally blurted out, but it didn't look like he was upset. He was stating facts, reasons to... What ? Stay away ? Not get attached ?
Steve is going to fix it. He's going to do it and it will fix his mess, or at least it will prevent him from messing up even more.
Also, do not hope too much. Only Bruce is going to be a little nicer to Steve, and all this is sadly not going to last.
Clint was about to keep going when Tony entered the room. The archer murmured under his breath in a dark tone : “Go away. Now.”
Suddenly everyone  was dead. Their lifeless eyes stared at him accusingly as he kept sinking deeper.
After that he saw a perfume store and went there to buy a heavenly good smelling perfume for Pepper, because he knew serious women had very good smelling perfumes, and Pepper wants to be very serious when she grows up.
PS : who do you find the cutest for now ? It doesn't have to be a kid, I find Tony pretty cute too even though I'm making myself melt when I write Thor and Hawkeye_girl just dies everytime Clint says or does something XD
This was one of the worst points of the story, and this is about as violent as it's gonna get. I consider suicide more violent than sacrifice battle and murder by the way so everything's not over yet kids ^^
They changed the subject, then, and Tony Stark started talking about his arm, as well as all the new technologies in the future, and then he told Bucky about the super heroes, and he was half way into explaining the Hulk and Bruce Banner when the door slammed opened, revealing Captain America.
So during this summer I had the opportunity to write (if you go on my profile you'll understand what I'm talking about ^^') So the reason why this story hasn't been updated in so long is because I have struggled a lot with deciding what to do with chapter 18. So much that I have ENTIRE deleted scenes about what was supposed to happen but never will. I don't know if I'll ever publish them, they're crap. Well no they're not really but I don't like them so they're crap and I wanna burn them but you can't burn a google drive file. Well yes you could by printing it but yeah you know what I mean did you miss my rants ? I bet you didn't. xp
“The question now, Tony, is what do you want to do, kick him out ?” Bruce seemed to be for that option.
Steve stared at the back of the bowman for a few seconds, throat tightenned, before getting up, head spinning and nausea rising, and going back to his floor.
“Keep talking to him” He told the men before turning back to the door. He had a bad feeling. Some sort of intuition that he should be with Steve right now. That it was urgent.
Here is a very, very short extract so I don't spoil too much but you still get prepared for the violence of the feels. Civil War kind.
Following an impulse, Steve had followed Ross quietly. Ward’s office door closed behind the man, and Steve had silently went to stand behind it, listening in.
Bucky stopped at the entrance of what seemed to be an open space composed of the kitchen, the dining room, and the living room. Tony was ranting to someone on the phone, pacing.
Ok so... This is for you, Stucky fans. Enjoy, it won't last because it'll get worse before it gets better.
“Understood, J’. Now where’s Cap’ ?”  Asked Iron Man as he flew towards the giant octopus, which was currently destroying building after building.
When Steve finally poked his head out of the armor of sheets he had wrapped around himself to block out the world, there was no one in the room.
“Fuck, it's always during the week-ends isn't it ? Do the bad guys have school or something ?” He grumbled as he jumped on the ground. He grabbed his beloved bow, and ran to get suited.
Wait, would you guys enjoy that ? The chapters getting longer I mean. (It's not like you have a choice but I can cut them if it really bothers you)
“No one else would want to pair up with him anyway” Snickered Clint, earning a punch in the shoulder by Natasha. Looking behind him, he realized the supersoldier had heard him, but didn't seem surprised or even offended. Simply... Hurt.
Two hours later, the kid exited a toy store, a soccer ball under his arm and his old backpack even fuller than it had been before, and started walking towards the exterior of the city. Tony hesitated for a second, but then decided he had to talk with that kid parents about the proper education and care that any parent should give to a child.
He heard a young voice coming from inside, but no one went to open him, so he knocked again after a while.
“Bad.” Answered Steve, looking bored. Tony frowned, wondering what was wrong, but decided to ignore it.
“JARVIS. Did you deliberatly let him in ? Don't answer. I know you did. I should give you to the nearest university, you know that ?” He threatened.
This is why Bucky was currently watching TV without being able to focus on it, on the communal floor, alone, waiting for the avengers to arrive. And that's how Clint and Natasha found him.
“NO ! Don't touch him !” Exclaimed Bruce and he crouched next to Steve, examining the supersoldier. “You might make it worse if you do. Thor. Don't touch him.” He insisted when the god looked at him with defiance and tears in his eyes.
He could hear people around him, and the steady, regular beeps of his heart monitor. Sometimes he drifted off and lost himself in his thoughts, seeing flashes of his past and of what could be. Time seemed to fly as if in a different dimension, both so fast and so slow.
And then I will create a serie where Steve comes back. And Bucky and Tony forgive him, stuckony ending, but not necessarily happy, it'll depend how you look at it.
Bucky’s hair was as dark as ever. It looked soft. Steve hesitated, then carefully extended a hand and started caressing it.
“It's like... They were made to be weak, intentionally. But look at these. Cameras and microphones. They were observing us.” Tony Stark was saying. He sounded tense.
Steve felt his heart stop, and then, he felt nothing at all. Nothing but a both distant and intense pain.
Tony let himself fall on the ground and just sat there, watching the two supersoldiers walk out of the workshop.
“I'm eating it. I'm eating it all.” Decided Tony, too excited about finally feeling the taste of one of his favorite things to care about the fact that he was being fed by the Bucky fucking Barnes.
Clint could see more and more robots landing near the supersoldiers and approaching them slowly. They only had a few seconds lef to live if they didn't move.
Clint sat down next to him on the couch and put his legs on his lap. Bucky tensed at the unexpected contact, but it felt nice, so he slowly relaxed.
He was currently walking as slowly as he could in a very busy street, so busy that no one even seemed to notice that Tony freaking Stark was right next to them.
So that was it. Steve found out and he was worried Tony would hit on his best friend. Or were they more ?
Silence. Bucky felt like crying, sobbing loudly. Screaming at the world that he’s sorry, so sorry to have let Steve, his best friend, his love, come to feel so utterly alone and broken. But nothing came, and no matter how much he tried to, he didn’t move, didn’t make a sound.
The Winter Soldier seemed to circle around him, killing a maximum of robots becfore they got near him.
“They request immediate medical assistance, sir, but they're going to live.” Announced the AI just as Thor came running, Bruce clode behind him. He was fully closed, they hadn't judged Hulk's presence necessary for this mission.
The kids would always sit in front of it and ask questions about the weird long words the reporters used. Pepper would always explain everything to them before Steve could even open his mouth, or a dictionary, because even he didn’t know as many words as Pepper.
Feel free to comment, if you're nice enough I'll leave clues, and if you're really really nice you'll get uuuh... Idk. a rant. about chapter 17.
Bruce's expression was cold, and annoyed. But there was a spark, something in the man's gaze. There, in the genius' eyes, was a hint of concern.
oh and i might edit the first chapters in a few weeks, I'll tell you when I do it if you want to reread the story.
Tony stood there for a few seconds, and then left the room, stopping at the door to say "I love you"
They ate and they played a card game next to the chimney and then they went to bed in their separate rooms. When they learned that they would be getting twins, their parents decided to make two separate rooms for each of their babies, in order to let them know that they truly were both special to them, and different from their twin.
.AU 1 : Steve talks to Tony about Bucky being his boyfriend back in the 40s, and Tony, with that information, decides that he's not worth almost a century of love, and breaks up with Steve. : Stuckony happy ending, the cliché stuckony where Steve and Bucky try to help Tony with his self worth issues (and the rest too)
“And you two ! Especially you Natasha ! Couldn't you see that he wasn't fine ?! And you Bruce ! I can't believe you let him out of medical when he could barely stand !”
The Asset tensed when the spy from the Red Room approached him. He knew she was very good, he had fought her before. She could hurt him really bad.
Clint grinned at Bucky “Mario kart is very useful because it's the only game on which I can beat Natasha without her saying it's because I'm a sniper so it doesn't count”
The robots were shooting at them, and the Asset's metal hand left him for a moment. The soldier shot twice and Steve heard several metal bodies falling.
“Winter is not the season of the sun. I came to talk to you, son of Barnes. I believe we should discuss last night's events.”
“Captain Rogers, I believe it has been a week since you have not eaten. I recommend you eat something as soon as possible” JARVIS' voice broke the silence of Steve's room.
“Brother of Winter, I do not believe the cakes of pan are supposed to look like this.” Thor informed Bucky.
Bucky knew that the billionaire was trying to come up with a believable lie, or a half truth that would get the soldier off his back.
So, this chapter is very very cool. Like, so cool. I loved writing it. But I might have to publish chapter 12 in two days.. I publish one chapter a day. On the whole profile. So if i publish the first chap of two can keep a secret tomorow, there will not be a chapter 12 for you all. I'm sorry, but I'm at chap 13 on the writing process, so I need to write faster, or have a little more time to write at least chap 14.
He took a bite of the food, holding back his nausea, forcing the pasta down his throat after chewing with difficulty.
I also had a lot of ideas today... My friends almost killed me when I told them what I was about to do to everyone. And then I said that I'm bringing Loki in this mess. As a good guy (mostly, he's on his own side ya know, but sometimes that means Thor's too and Thor loves Bucky so much and Loki is like I PROTECC TOO LOOK BROTHER HE'S SAFE) That idea actually saved my life. Because today I decided of the chapter 16, and you will hate me when you read it. But for now, enjoy the almost fluff and let me live. ^^
This whole thing felt so forced. Steve found it unbearable. He wanted to be left alone, but also craved for someone, something, anything, to finally end his loneliness. He busied himself by reducing his pancakes into crumbs.
Flashes of the past kept haunting him, dead memories full of warm sunshine and laugher, but also darker ones, and those were the only ones that felt real.
Natasha had wanted to investigate on this and had asked him questions, but he wouldn't answer, he kept his face blank and he didn't even seem to be there with her. She had finally told him : “Mission :  sleep”
Well if aliens did exist, and he was hearing about the time Loki had turned his brother into a snake and the familiar steps of his favorite inventor, then he needed to find those winchester brothers when he woke up.
“You already knew.” The blond realized, horrified. “You knew and you never did anything ?!” He had roared.
“Wasn’t Steve supposed to join us ?” She asked the genius softly. It seemed like the subject of the captain was even sorer than usual.
“Is that how Steve treats his guests then ?” Asked Hawkeye, making Bucky startle and turn around quickly to assess the situation.
Steve whimpered. He was a monster. A fucking monster who should have stayed in the past, should have died in that plane.
He was abruptly thrown to the ground and vaguely heard a body fall next to him, just as the shootings stopped. Was Bucky okay ? Were they safe ? Steve could faintly hear voices shouting. There were hands on him, removing his suit, ripping it. He desperatly tried to open his eyes, to see what was happening, to check on Bucky, on Tony... Oh god was Tony alright ? He opened his mouth, but couldn't hear himself talk. He felt himself drift, and then, nothing.
“Will our brother of Winter ever wake up ?” The thunder god’s tone was so sad, Bucky wished he could open his eyes and tell Thor everything would be alright.
However his logic told him that he had to. So he got dressed and went to the communal kitchen. Clint was making french toast.
Hey guys I hope you enjoyed this creepy chapter ! I didn't want it to be so dark buuuut I am a very influencable person *looks at Zeyra*
“Steve would hate me if he knew that I am telling you this, but I don’t think you can hear me anyway.”
The blue eyed supersoldier opened his eyes, a weird light shining behind them. “Yes I am ! I hurt people. I am a danger. You hate me. You all hate me. I’d rather be dead and know that I am not hurting the ones I love anymore.” Steve closed his eyes again. “I just want you to let me go. To let me.. Die. Am I asking for too much, Bruce ?”
“I don't know, Bucky. I don't know. But let's focus on the fact that you are, alright ? Plus, you got a new arm.”
Tony and Clint throwing cookies at each other, the inventor hiding behind Steve and stealing a kiss from the blond as they all laughed.
“Yes.” Steve's voice was hoarse. It sounded like he had spent the day crying. Bucky would have comforted him, had the situation been any different. Now ? Steve deserved it. He would feel better in a few days anyway.
“No let me finish ! I’m not asking you all to care for real, because I don’t want you to, and you won’t anyway ! I hurt Tony. I hurt Bucky. Hell, who knows if Bucky will wake up one day ? Maybe I fucking killed him.” Steve’s voice broke.
“I care deeply about him. He is almost as important as Loki to me.” Confessed the blond. “I don’t think I would take it well if he happened to die.” He added in a surprisingly low voice.
Hi guys ! you know I'm not kidding when I say comments are motivation.. This is hard to write when you get 7 poor kudos and  only one comment from a friend.... It's like you readers don't even exist !
I would like to thank Every_Fandom_Trash too, she is the one who motivated me to write this fanfic, and she will most certainly be the reason I finish it, so everyone go on her profile and read her fanfics, she's awesome !
Thor's smile disappeared, and he stared at Bucky in confusion, his whole body going tense and preparing to fight the Winter Soldier.
“So was yours” Bucky shot back, a grin growing in his lips. He was enjoying this. The man in front of him was adorable, and this was easy. For a few seconds, he just felt like he had felt back in the 40s when he was flirting with a very oblivious Steve. And for a second, the inventor started returning his smile, before a look of realisation dawned on the genius' face.
“Bucky, why were you listening to us ? Were you spying on us ?” Questionned Thor, but it wasn't accusation the man from the 40s heard in his voice, it was genuine curiosity.
And on top of that, the only week on which Steve had been called on a mission he could not refuse, also happened to be the week that Bucky decided to wake up.
“What is my mission ?” He spoke in russian again. He could speak english, but it felt wrong. English was Bucky's language, just like russian was the Winter Soldier's.
“Bucky, Bucky can you hear us ?” Tony’s voice was trembling with nervousness, and he was talking way too fast.
Clint and Bucky, who were now eating, choked and looked at him. Barnes was blushing, and Tony looked at him in complete confusion and wonder, because oh gosh, what a cutie when he blushed and...
Bucky stepped back into the shadows, silently thanking the AI for never announcing his presence when he found himself spying on his new friends.
Thor, Bruce and Tony knew not to push and risk to anger the potentially very scary woman in front of them, but Clint Barton knows no such fear.
Bucky stared at him for a moment, searching for an argument, and then nodded slowly, a small smile in his lips. “I can't really deny that.”
When they arrived at the battlefield, that was once again right at the foot of the Avengers Tower, the Asset turned to Clint and Natasha.
The blond punched him playfully and they laughed. It reminded Bucky of how they were before it all, and he should have felt pain, but all he could feel was hope.
Tony was startled, and for a moment he didn't know how to respond. No one ever looked at him long enough to notice anymore. Not even Pepper, or Rhodey. Or maybe no one wanted to notice, because then they'd have to take care of him, and he would become even more of a pain in their ass.
He was blind, and it should have panicked him more than that, but he didn't have the energy to care. He was exhausted, he wanted to just sleep.
Tony was his favorite visitor. He wouldn’t do much, except sit by the window and work, muttering to himself as he did so.
She seemed to notice she was being watched, though, because he snapped back to reality and stared at Clint, who had called her name twice already.
“Yes. Are you okay, Tony ?” She replied, putting a hand on his cheek and another on his shoulder. She knew friendly touches from people he trusted comforted him.
“No, you know what, I have had enough of you. I thought I could make you better, but you look at you !” Steve pointed to the bottle Tony had just grabbed from the bar, and held in his shaking hands. “How many bottles a day, uh ?”
PS : please do not kill me if you see any plot hole in here, just kindly point it out, because I just most likely genuinely forgot and will rewrite everything again as soon as you tell me !
And then the door flew open to reveal a very angry looking supersoldier. Tony put his glass down, regretting intensely giving in to Bucky's puppy eyes that morning.
“And before you ask, yeah, I think I pretty much heard it all. Come out now d-Tony. I got something to tell you.” He said in a voice that almost sounded like he was assured.
Also, for all the phans in need of angst, I posted an angsty one shot this afternoon (so while you were sleeping if you're american), go check it out if you're interested !
“You really thought we wouldn't figure it out ? Tony. You shouldn't try to hide those things. We want to help you. And right now you need to stay away from Rogers.” Natasha answered.
And it never failed to end the discussion, since they both knew Tony blamed Bucky, they didn't need to ask the genius to know that.
Bucky was terrified of what the government would decide to do with him. Execute him ? Throw him in a maximum security prison ? Torture him for information ? Experiment on him ? Bucky shivered. The last one was the worst.
The first session had been a huge fail. Bucky had sat in a chair in front of Natasha in the Hulk Room, which had been locked by Clint, who was watching from the exterior. He had then closed his eyes and called the 'winter guy' – because apparently other guy is for the Hulk – out. When the Winter Soldier had awaken to find himself in a metal chair, he had panicked and screamed, and it was clear that he wanted to get up and as far as possible from the chair, but he didn't, he forced himself not to move and seemed to brace himself to suffer.
Tony heard something shatter in another room and he saw Loki put his hands over his ears and close his eyes tightly.
“I fucked up, Bucky. Messed up so bad. I don’t think I can fix this. Bruce won’t even let me k-kill myself. I need to end this, Bucky. I can’t take it anymore. Even you don’t want me in your life anymore. How can I ever live with that ? What purpose do I have ? That of a soldier ? There are so many enhanced people out there now, no one needs Captain America anymore.”
And Steve starting to act very self-destructive ? I bet all of you are going to be mad in the comments again because I'm doing it wrong. And yes I know, any normal human wouldn't be able to stand and fight for that long after a week of not eating, but I think Steve, being a supersoldier, can last longer, but not much longer because he has a fast metabolism.
The infirmary was deserted. Not even doctor. No one but a note : “you are expected to leave as soon as you wake up.”
“I take it we're still together then, punk ?” Bucke's tone was playful, but Steve could see the worry in his lover's eyes.
You should check it out, though don't worry, I repeat, my fic ends well. But this music video.. It's so heartbreaking ! I just love it. Sometimes I watch it on loop because the feels are so intense and I am so addicted to them that I can't. look. away. Oh, that'd make a good title for.. I don't know yet XD
I just think this is important that you know, people can make huuuuuge mistakes, and sometimes you don't understand. Sometimes the pain they cause, is not even close to the one they feel. I SAID SOMETIMES DONT YELL AT ME FOR BEING STEVE'S ADVOCATE SOMEONE HAS TO TAKE HIS SIDE (says the one yelling sorry)
He wanted to say 'I love you' over and over. But it was probably too soon. Or too late, it depended of how one would look at it. However one thing was certain : it was not the time. So instead, Steve settled for : “I missed you”
“Listen, I trust them with my life. I trust them with you too. I swear, everything will be fine. I just want them to meet you, and only you. Not the 'Captain America's best friend' you.”
Suddenly he could feel the strong hand holding his left metal one, and another, smaller hand grabbing his right one, and pressing.
“Cap ? Lost your tongue ? Did it disappear with your valors ? Because, you know, you had everyone a little confused. You did say that you don't like bullies, right ?”
“Goodbye, Bucky.” Had whispered the god of thunder softly before leaving. “Come back to us soon, brother.”
The bowman smiled approvingly.  “You heard that JARVIS ? Take him to Shellhead.” The elevator started moving. “Oh and Bucky ? Call him Tony, he doesn't like to be called Stark by his friends.”
Chapter 12's title : .... It has no title. Shit. I forgot to name it. Wait a few minute imma read it again.
Bucky had trouble hiding his blush. They were talking about him. He didn't like being the center of attention, but at the same time it meant they cared.
Machines were beeping around him. He didn't know why there were so many machines in a hospital... Or at least he supposed he was in a hospital, and ouch, this was too much reflexion for his head.
He wanted to stand up, but as soon as he started moving, pain shot through his whole body, and his chest and right arm started feeling wet. He ignored the pain to twist and look at the damage. His hospital gown was getting soaked his blood. He lifted at arm and tried to tear the cloth to have a better look at the injury.
“Maybe he knew and liked the person who did this to him, and he didn't want to hurt them.” the archer said in one breath.
‘I already decided who I am trusting. Clint is nice to the Asset. Doesn’t hurt. Says I do a good job.”
When they broke the embrace, they both had wet eyes, and Steve wondered if Bucky had been listening to his heart too. He smiled sadly, and Bucky returned it.
His choice was made. Steve decided to choose Bucky. They had been together for years, while his relationship with Tony had only started a few months ago. Bucky knew everything about Steve's weaknesses and he still loved him, even before the superserum, while Steve could never know for sure if all Tony saw in him wasn't only Captain America. Plus, Tony was a playboy, he would be alright, Steve was pretty sure Tony never loved him anyway. (And if that was a
Oh and I have an announcement to make in the end notes, if you would be so kind and read them too... :)
“Will he live ?” Asked Steve, his voice, weak and trembling, made a huge contrast with his blank exterior.
“Ouch, can’t you get out of the way ? Couldn’t you see I was runn-” The silver haired boy stopped talking as soon as he saw the man he was speaking to.
His voice was softer than what he had wanted it to be as he lied through his teeth, but he decided to ignore it.
The kid was having fun with Tony’s money, buying a bunch of different books and toys and even… A few dresses and some perfume ? Well maybe he had a sister. Or weird tastes. The inventor wasn't judging though.
“I don't think it would be a good idea, Tony. The soldier is a part of him now. He is not who Steve used to know. It's pointless to try to turn Bucky back into was he used to be.” Natasha said, squeezing Tony's shoulder in a comforting way.
Thor and Tony were the ones who visited him the most. Thor would sit next to him, hold his hand gently, and tell him stories about Loki, sometimes imagining out loud how it would go if he took Bucky with him to visit Asgard.
Bucky sat in the living room, watching the Lord of the Rings. He had been really happy to learn that Tolkien's masterpieces had been made into movies. The soldier hadn't seen Steve in the last couple of days, but he was ok with that. It had only been a dozen of days since he woke up, and he wanted to discover things and make friends by himself now. Maybe the other supersoldier had figured that out too.
They were managing the flow of evil robots just fine, until the bots' blue eyes turned an aggressive kind of red. Suddenly, the robots became ten times more powerful, making Stark shout warnings over the comms as the rate of fire of the things got faster.
Everyone but the redhead felt way too uncomfortable with giving the Winter Soldier orders, so she had decided that she would be her 'handler' as long as he struggled with free will. She hoped he would understand soon that he can make his own choices as long as they don't hurt anyone.
Now you maaaayyy have also read the text between those song lyrics.... And... Let me say... I'm almost sorry ? I mean I had to reread my whole fanfic yesterday so I wouldn't write nonsense today, and I almost cried at my own words, and literally cried from the angst and pain... I was like "When will the author update this !!! Oh wait."  So yeah, I guess that at least, you readers get the satisfaction of knowing that I suffered too. At least twice : when I imagined the story, and when I had to reread it XD
“WANDA !” He cried as  he entered her bedroom and started pulling his sister out of her bed. They had to run away out of the house, and fast.
Now wide awake, Tony decided he needed to socialize. It was absolutely not because he seeked comfort from his team mates. His team would never take the time to comfort him, he had made it pretty clear that he didn't want them to. Really, he did not want them to hug him and put a hand on his shoulder and just make him feel they're here. No. Nope.
It's four am where I live (France) but I really really wanna publish this TONIGHT so here you go everyone !
“The bank ! I'm in the bank !” Clint felt his hands shake and looked at them. They were covered in blood. It was all it took for him to finally break. “Oh god Tony, Steve... Bucky... There's blood everywhere. Oh god.” He sobbed.  “help me !”
Somehow, while he slowly ran his hand through Bucky’s hair as memories of the 40s danced in his mind, the solution appeared to him, loud and clear.
Steve was curled up under his sheets. He didn't want to see the world outside, he didn't want to talk to anyone, not even Bucky. He was so full of shame, of self hatred.
After a while of Steve trying to swallow as much pasta as he could, and only succeeding at taking a few bites, the physicist sighed.
Thor laughed loudly. “Of course I know that brother ! I really wish you two could meet one day. My two little brothers” Thor seemed lost in his own dreams for a few minutes, a soft smile on his lips.
“Bucky, I bought you an appartment, yeah one just for you, and you can go live there if you want, even though I'd really like you to sta- What ? No ! Fuck !”
“Then why aren't your knuckles at least a little damaged ?” Asked Bucky, trying too sound genuinely confused, but it came out sounding like an accusation. He turned to the inventor to see his reaction.
Since he woke up several weeks ago, Bucky had heard a lot of things about the avengers. He knew they were powerful, he knew that Stark and Steve were on the team, and he knew that they were probably going to want to recruit him once he was proved stable.
“No.. I mean, you. Tony Stark. I don't want to stay away from Tony Stark.” Bucky wanted to hide and allows himself to be shy, but he needed to do this. This was important.
“Hey Stevie, don't be sad. Don't regret the past. We are not who we were before. I am not the Bucky you knew.” 'But I still want to protect you and mother hen you and I love you so, so much' he almost added, but decided otherwise at the last second.
“I’m sorry sir.” He said as he stood up and started going back to Wanda, who seemed to feel the same way about that guy and was staying a safe distance away.
What else... uh. Nothing except I'm tired. Oh wait, there is that one thing. I put lyrics at the beginning of the chapter, please go check out the song ! Even tho I wanted to use it for another chapter.
Bucky put his chin on Thor's shoulder and returned the hug while observing the two spies, who were sharing glances.
“You ? What ? You didn’t mean to do this ? Then what, exactly, did you mean to do by starving yourself to the point where your boyfriend, or should I say EX-boyfriend -because there is no way I’m allowing you near him again- is between life and death because of you ? Did you mean to get everyone’s attention ? Because let me tell you that endangering your life and others’ is never the right way to make some friends or to seek forgiveness.”
“I mean smarter than you, because apparently you can’t even tell when a child is a genius. I want to adopt that one.” Upon stating that Ross had showed steve a black and white picture of the little Bruce Banner and oh, smart like that, okay.
Steve opened his mouth to talk, but a warm liquid came pouring out instead, streaming down his jaw and throat. He heard rocks fall around him, and a body curled around him, as if it was protecting him. But Steve couldn't really tell, because he couldn't see anything, everything was black.
'Well, shit.' Thought Steve as he heard the genius walk out of the room in quick angry steps and close the door.
Tony's mind paused for a second. Bucky wanted to protect him from Steve ? No. It was just out of jealousy.
“What happened ?” Tony was watching Thor and Bucky, who had fallen asleep and was now leaning against the god.
The blond kept his eyes tightly closed. He wanted to go to sleep. Forever. He never wanted to hear anything from anyone ever again. Because all the persons that ever mattered to him hated him now or would hate him if they knew, and they were right to do so.
“Loki would love you, I am sure of it, brother. He always dreamed of having a little brother to protect, even though he would never admit it.”
“I wish Bucky would go away.” Sighed Bruce. “I like the guy, but Tony's not the same. It's like all that's left is an empty shell.”
So angsty. But also very very sad. I think I made myself cry while writing that chapter ? Cry inside, at least.
Steve started to sink as memories of better times, times when it was easier to exist, played in front of his eyes.
Clint ran to the edge of the building, trying to see past the damn pile of rubble. Robots were shooting at the supersoldiers, but the archer couldn't shoot at them, they were behind a building and neither Thor nor Ironman were in sight.
He always had a huge crush on this celebrity, but he hadn’t thought about Stark since he was sent to the Shield Orphanage.
“No !” Steve protested instantly, grabbing Bucky's flesh arm and pulling him down again to crash his lips against Bucky's in a rough, but meaningful kiss. The kiss then softened before they pulled back a few moments later. They were both smiling, and their faces were so close that Bucky's dark hair was tingling Steve's cheeks. “No.” Repeated the blond tenderly.
He had also grown used to JARVIS. He liked the AI, it was one of the things that made him feel like he was in a science-fiction novel, but in a good way. He asked as many questions as he could. Everytime he was alone in a room and felt confused about something, anything, he could ask the AI and it would answer. What was the most amazing was that it was almost as if the AI actually liked Bucky back.
This is after those two weird but kind of okay in the end days that Bucky decided to go see Tony and talk to him, maybe tell him about his growing feelings, or ask him out on a date. Or.. Something. He missed the genius. He'd find an excuse to spend time with him.
The genius stopped for a second, running a hand through his hair. He looked wild. And tired. The inventor had bags under his eyes.
“You okay, Stevie ? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that. Kissed you, I mean. Let's forget it, yeah ?” Bucky said while getting off of Steve.
“Ok, so the cure will last longer than expected...” The inventor really hoped Steve wouldn't take it badly.
“I WARNED YOU !” Roared Steve before punching him in the face, sending him to the hard floor. Pain shot through his whole face and back and he grunted, trying to get up.
Tony glanced at the door. He wanted to run away. That was what Bucky made him feel. Bucky made him want to run away.
“Bucky,” Natasha sighed and waited for the soldier to look her in the eye. “This is about you. You need to know that you're free. You can get your own place and spend your days at the tower, or get your own place and just stay there all the time, or simply stay at the tower, and no one will judge your actions. You're free, Bucky.”
Bucky laughed as he sat on his bed. He felt strangely fine considering he just woke up in a hospital. “So you're a joker ? Bucky Barnes, by the way.” He said, extending his right hand towards the man, who took it.
Clint opened his mouth to answer but a dozen of robots attacked him. He fought them, stabbing the robots with explosive arrows and sidestepped to avoid the blows of the machines.
“You know, you shouldn’t be telling such stories to Bucky. Because if he can hear you, then he will believe that it is safe to be around Loki.”
And Steve took it without replying. Because there was no use, the archer wouldn't stop. And Steve deserved it.
“I never wanted you” The super soldier heard himself spit. “You're just a playboy who wanted to add Captain America on his list !”
“Well they can't find out every single time I mess up. The media would only be about Tony Stark if they did.”
He had no right to refuse the food. But he knew he could not physically eat it all... He wasn't refusing it, he was just telling the truth.
“Captain Rogers seems to have fainted and is on the ground. The Winter Soldier is killing any robot that comes near them.”
Steve is going to pay. But not in the "Steve gets beat up by some bad guy" way coz that's just cruel and i don't see the point. No, I believe Steve is very much able to realize his mistakes... sometimes. Anyway he can, and he will, here. And he will regret it deeply and try to redeem himself, etc, etc.
I am currently writing a fanfiction named "Two can keep a secret" and it's Natasha centric because there are not enough of those fics out there. I don't think I ever read more than ten of them, both in english and french.
I also got a lot of comments about how Steve was being a total jerk to Tony and how they hoped he wouldn't get away with it so easily. Do not worry, dear readers,(ialmostwrotedeadreadersandisn'tthatsotrueafterinfinitywar)
There was a short silence, and Loki knew it wasn’t because Steve hadn’t heard, but simply because no one had ever knocked on that door. The only people who ever visited the Orphanage had a key.
Tony and Steve loved each other. There was no questions about it. Even when they disagreed on things, even when they woke the other up in the middle of the night with their nightmares, even when they had to battle their demons, even when they lost. Through it all, there was always one constant : Steve and Tony loved each other.
He followed the man and when he was close enough, quickly dug his hand into his pocket and grabbed everything he could, before running away.
Bucky had woken up in a relatively good mood that morning. Which was strange, because it had been two days since Tony had yelled at him and they still hadn't crossed paths. Bucky missed Tony, and actually, that was the reason why his good mood wasn't so weird after all : he had decided that today would be the day he goes to Tony and appologizes.
Tony's face grew surprised, hurt, and then defensive in half a second, and the mechanic took a step back, his eyes darkening.
It was truly breathtaking, to see Bucky like that. He looked like a male version of Snow White after she bit the apple. His face was completely free of any tension, as if he was peacefully dreaming of a place far away from their messy, oh so painful, reality.
Oh no ! Winter is paralyzed ! Oh no, HYDRA stole all your pokemons except pikachu ! What will Pikachu do now ? Oh what are you saying, go to the pikachu realm and seek help from his father ?  Okay sounds like a cool plan !
PPS : I also had, since chapter 5, the idea of publishing a sort of bonus thingy where you get to read all the scene I deleted (as if they didn't happen), and where I will write scenes I didn't show (like, in chapter 11, a bucky&tony moment I totally ignored in order to maintain the angst), as well as ideas that could have been or rants to explain the characters. If it interests you, comment about it, and I'll be sure to publish it sooner.
It was Thor's turn to be surprised. “The others didn't tell you ? Well I guess that's better. They don't know him. They saw him while he was at his worst, and from what little informations I could gather, I think he had been tortured into submission by an entity far greater than all of us.” Bucky shivered.
But maybe he should just have made pancakes. A wave of anxiety and insecurities went through his chest. What if it was the pancakes that Tony enjoyed, and not Bucky's cooking ?!
Clint was chilling in one of his self made nests, playing video games, when he heard the Avengers call.
“Oh, you're gonna cry ?? Booh fucking hoo. Poor you. What do you think Tony felt ? You abandonned him ! All this because Bucky came back ! You really thought Tony would just be... What ? Fine ? You made him miserable !”
And that's how he found himself outside of Tony's private bathroom. JARVIS had let him in, telling him Mister Stark was planning to talk to him anyway.
Anyway, the plot is, Natasha has a secret she is so ashamed of that she won't even tell Clint. A woman from the Red Room, Darya, arrives  and use the secret to blackmail Natasha into making the others think she is an old and trustworthy friend.
“Thanks for the food.” He mumbled, turning his back on the soldier. He wanted Bucky to go away, but he also already missed the supersoldier's arms around him. He had felt so safe for a few blessed seconds.
The second time Tony tried to talk to Bucky, it was out of concern. He wanted to check that the arm was working well. So he told JARVIS to wait for Bucky to be alone before asking him to come down to the workshop.
PLEASE READ THE BEGINNING NOTES THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND WATCH THE TAGS THEY ARE GOING TO CHANGE !!!!
“Hello Bucky, so I wanted to tell you that since I'm sorry and I like you and want you to be safe.. Shit, no, absolutely not.”
The Target's expression showed panic and then determination. “No, I will not sit this fight out.   They need as many soldiers as they can. This is the only thing I have left. Don't tell anyone I'm not feeling well.” The Target seemed to see the Asset's hesitation, because he added : “It's an order.”
At that moment, a dirty blond kid walked down the stairs with a purple sweatshirt. And Tony Stark was pretty sure it was the one Thor had bought earlier with his money. The kid looked at Thor’s scared face, then at Tony.
Hulk growled, and Bruce took a deep breath as he entered the hospital and ran towards Steve’s room without even bothering to stop and state his identity.
“Tony ! We need to help him ! I know you can invent the technology to erase all the brainwashing !” Steve pleaded.
So here he was, Tony Stark, behind the one-sidded glass, refusing to let his ex-boyfriend's BFF wake up alone.
SPEAKING OF MY FRIENDS every_fandom_trash and I are writing a clint whump (i think it's called like that) thingy. It's awesome. I gave the idea and she used her writing skills and I swear you're not holding your breath while you read you have a serious problem because I do not know of an angstier way of writing. It's beautifully painful x) I love it ! It's called (Don't) hold me. Prepare to see it pop up sometimes soon with the Natasha thing "Two can keep a secret" remember about that one ? Yeah it's coming, give me time.
“Nothing really. Could you leave me alone please ?” Steve asked. He sounded even weaker than the first time he had talked.
‘there is no way I’m allowing you near him again’ Bruce’s voice shattered the warm memories, Bucky’s face faded into the dark, and the water went cold.
Clint was heading to the kitchen on the communal floor to see if he could steal some of Bruce's food – the scientist's food was the best – when he saw Thor and Bucky sitting against a wall. They seemed to be leaning against each other. Clint smirked when he realized they were asleep, and silently left the corridor to go get a few things.
Oh and Déjà-Vu is a french expression, you english thieves (kidding, we stole words too sooo...) and I love the way you guys pronounce it !
Bucky then glanced at his right, and there, sitting next to his bed but turning his back on him, sat Howard Stark. Of course. The man must have invented some sort of new prosthetic made of metal. He was a genius. But something looked.. Wrong. The man next to him was Howard... But not quite. Was it an hallucination ?
The hand didn’t move. He sighed. “No. Of course not. Why would I, of all people, make you wake up, uh ?”
Tony Stark was curled up on his couch, eyes fixed on the big screen on one of the walls. The screen was split in two. One of them showed Bucky playing video games with two superspies, and on the other, Steve was drawing.
The blond punched him playfully and they laughed. It reminded Bucky of how they were before it all, and he should have felt pain, but all he could feel was hope.
It hadn't been Steve's fault, it hadn't been anyone's fault, it was an accident, a consequence no one could have ever seen.. Coming. Pietro. That guy was the reason why Clint was acting like this. This had felt too much like Sokovia.
Without a word, Stark stood up and left, stopping in front of Steve to glare at him for a few seconds.
Bruce entered Bucky’s room to find it just like he had left it several hours ago : Tony and Thor worrying over a lifeless looking Bucky.
You might be angry at clint's behavior in the next chapter. Just warning you, you know. Coz they're all being idiots so Clint thought "oh yeah I'll joing the party" But do not worry, it's all gonna get worse before it gets better.
I'd like to tell you all that Bruce is going to keep his promise and not tell anything to anyone :D Now you can try and imagine what I prepared for them next x)
It had been a little more than two months since the events in the hospital, and since then the physicist had decided that they would at least take one meal a day together, just the two of them.
And it's mainly from Steve's pov but there is some tony stark and bucky barnes interactions in there, especially at the end (the not yet written part that is tony FINALLY calling pepper about the situation)
Have you noticed how the chapters keep getting longer and longer ? Yeah, me too. I don't know why I do that, but I'll end up published 10k words chapters if I don't stop XD
“Loki ! I’m so sorry  ! It’s just the sound of a broken plate, you’re here, you’re alright, everything is alright.”
Natasha smiled. She was so happy that the man took his life in his own hands. She would miss him, but she sure as hell was going to visit as often as she could. She liked Bucky, and had grown to consider him as a friend, or at least a potential one.
He tensed, blushing furiously as he tried to break the embrace, but Bucky was holding onto him and didn't want to let go.
The supersoldier wondered briefly where the other avengers were, but quickly figured they had decided not to crowd him.
When he arrived in the corridor where Steve’s and Bucky’s room were, he almost ran into Natasha, who instantly grabbed his arms.
But i'm not sure yet. so it could be minutes later. what's sure is that bucky isn't awake yet. Oh I should... shit i got a problem right there i need bucky not awake but i also need bucky awake.
Steve lifted his head to look Bruce in the eye for the first time since.. He could not remember it. He kept his head down at all times now.
The man let him go instantly and Tony tried to pretend he didn't see the flash of hurt that passed on Barnes' face.
“Bucky, you think too loudly, I can't sleep” Mumbled a very cute looking and very sleepy Captain America next to him.
“Ok. Alright. We can work with that.” Breathed Tony, already thinking of ways to totally and finally get rid of the Winter Soldier.
And just like that, all the remaining anger in Clint's chest flew away, leaving behind a huge void, the weight of guilt and regret, as well as a pain that was so unbearable it was hard to breathe.
On one side, there was Bucky, his charming and overprotective personality, his sweet smiles and courage. There was the broken man from the past who needed him to help him get up and live again in a world that wasn't their own.
“I found you and our brother of winter in the corridor, you both were trapped in your pasts.” Explained Thor quietly, so he would not wake Bucky.
“Yes, but not quite. He was listening to orders, he didn't care that we weren't Hydra.” Replied Natasha.
Bucky seemed to understand that this was a battle already lost. He held his hands up jokingly and changed the subject, asking about Peggy. They both decided that Bucky could move to Steve's room, at least for the next few days.
Bucky stared at him for a moment, and then decided that his life was just crazy like that. So he was in the future, and Steve was still as young as he had been last time he saw him. What about that guy who looks like Howard ? Howard didn't seem like the kind of guy to want kids...
That night, Bucky woke up from a nightmare he could not remember. Steve, by his side, watched him with sorrowfull eyes. Noticing that, Bucky directed a sad smile at him.
The genius turned around just in time to see a blond boy who looked like he was twelve running away.
During that month, Steve refused to step away from the one sidded glass of the medical room, where Bucky sat on a chair, under a weird machine he could not begin to understand, but he knew he could trust it to cure Bucky, because Tony made it.
Also, yes, I plan on updating this more often, so don't be scared to read, please don't abandon me I worked hard for this ^^"
Something went cold in his chest. In his head, a voice that sounded just like his own spoke in russian.
Thor sighed and evelopped the other man in a hug. Hopefully his brother of winter would feel better soon.
“You don’t look like he’s fine. You look worried. Don’t bullshit me Bruce, I’d rather you tell me the truth, even if it’s not a easy one to hear.”
“Just as soft as in my memories…” He sighed. He did not feel as conflicted as before. “Remember when we used to climb in that apple tree ? I was always the one who climbed the highest, somehow. Maybe because I a bit too reckless..?” He laughed. “Okay, way too reckless, and that never changed.” Steve caressed the back of his love’s hand with his thumb. “Although we did change a lot, didn’t we ? I guess some things always stay the same. You’ll always be a jerk, and I’ll always be a stupid punk.”
“No way. My brother of iron is not the kind of person to hold hatred in his heart, nor is he one to blame the innocent.”
Some may notice that the chapter's title has changed, well it's because the former title is for another chapter.
“I’m sorry it took so long for me to finally fix it” He apologized both to no one in particular and to the whole world.
I just put "mama" by MCR on and now he's like "oh, what is that, I don't know that song" *gerard starts singing* *nicolas (my best friend) starts dancing*
Steve had told him about the other members, and Bucky looked forward to finally meeting them. However the team had judged it better and safer to let Bucky adapt to the new century in peace, without the pressure of social integration, so they had left for Barton's farm.
“Bucky, you think too loudly, I can't sleep” Mumbled a very cute looking and very sleepy Captain America next to him.
“Yes you can” He grumbled. He heard the genius jump and a few things fell. That's when he realized he was very very anxious about the whole situation. And now it was too late.
Natasha sighed heavily. She was tired too. No one had had much sleep since before the battle, three days ago.
“The Captain of America told me things about you. You have been forced to fight for your enemies. Soldier of Winter. Is that how they called you ?”
Bucky had often heard people say that sometimes when someone is in a coma, they’re not really unconscious, and they can still hear. He had believed that those people where the same sort of people who believed in ghosts and aliens.
As they ran away towards the woods, they heard a second explosion. Wanda stopped running and turned to see.
However he could see that a lot of robots had decided to focus on the Winter Soldier and Captain America.
My best friend is currently dancing on some epic japanese party music. And no, it's not MCR's dangerous days album, unfortunately for me.
He had already told them multiple times but all of the avengers needed to hear it again regularly. All of them except Natasha, who had just noted it somewhere and read it from time to time.
That night, Steve had left a letter in Tony's room. Tony had had to close his eyes for a few seconds to fight back the memories they had shared in that bedroom. Then he had picked up the letter.
“We're busy, Barton. We think we found the source of the robots. If we take it down, we destroy them all.”
He wasn’t high enough for the fall to kill him, he noted, before turning back to the rest of the room, searching for something, anything, that could help him cease to exist.
He stopped at the glass doors. From here he could see the inventor tinkering in his workshop. Tony's movements were slow, and from time to time he stopped, putting a hand on his ribs. Were they broken ?
He then went to a clothes shop and bought three dresses, a white, a red, and a black, for Natasha. He also bought a purple sweatshirt, because he knew that was Clint’s favorite color.
Steve was laying down, absentmindedly rubbing at his wound. He could feel his hand was wet from the blood probably pouring out, but he couldn’t bring himself to care.
He couldn’t hear anything but the Hulk’s growing growls and roars of pain, and his increasingly fast heartbeat.
So, I uh had that idea of publishing the deleted scenes and a few bonus scenes. There is a deleted scene in chapter 5, two bonus scenes that I could write in this chapter, and several other bonus and deleted scenes in the other chapters, and I think I told you all about it but you must have forgotten because I didn't get your feedback : would you like that to happen ? Or should I focus on the story ?
It was almost the same feeling he got when he thought of Steve, but with Steve, it wasn't  just dreams. It was memories, dozens of them, all of them sweet and warm and almost comforting, if he could forget the fact that they now belonged to a past he will never get to live again.
Tony followed the little blond thief for hours, wondering how the hell this kid hadn’t noticed him yet. Seriously, the boy never looked around once. He wasn’t a really good thief, he was really lucky he hadn’t  stole from that bastard of Justin Hammer. This guy would have had him put in jail for sure.
“Bucky,” Natasha sighed and waited for the soldier to look her in the eye. “This is about you. You need to know that you're free. You can get your own place and spend your days at the tower, or get your own place and just stay there all the time, or simply stay at the tower, and no one will judge your actions. You're free, Bucky.”
“Hello, soldier” He greeted, not missing how Winter's eyes sparkled a little at the acknowledgement.
Bucky stared at him. This guy was fearless. The bowman wasn't even tense at the idea of being sat right next to the Winter Soldier. Barton, who had focused on the screen for a few seconds, must have found the lack of answers weird, because he turned to Bucky again, frowning.
Natasha and Bruce would visit him from time to time, too. Natasha would read to him in russian, and Bruce usually simply said hi and checked his vitals, except for today. Today, the genius stayed for a while longer, and talked about.. Steve. Bucky missed Steve. The blond never came to visit him.
/The Winter Soldier. Let me take control. They need us to fight with them, and I am a better fighter than you will ever be./
The door opened slowly, revealing a flustered Tony Stark who was very careful to look everywhere but into Bucky's eyes.
On both sides, there was a man who needed him to love them and be there for them, but Steve could not choose both.
Okay, so, i'm sorry if you see any typos or other mistakes in the text, I have no time to reread the chapter tonight since I have to go see a drama play (is that how you say it ?)
“Wha...? How old is he ?” Bucky was just confused now. Steve must be around 100 years old now.. And people still sent him on missions ?! Were they nuts ?!
Bucky’s heart jumped, and the steady beep of the heart monitor went mad for a second, before going back to normal.
“Target : Captain America. Mission : kill. No witnesses. Ready to finish the mission, waiting for orders.”
As soon as his boyfriend left the room, Steve let out a sorrowful sigh. He had wanted to say 'I love you' back. It was at the edge of his mouth, his lips already forming the first word. But he couldn't. He didn't have that right anymore.
“My boyfriend.” He whispered silently to himself, tasting the words on his tongue. They felt wrong, knowing what Steve had done to Tony.
The two spies noticed him first. They walked towards him calmly, and their body language showed that they meant no harm.
“Because I like you almost as much as I like Loki. You and him are so much alike, it is incredible.”
“IT'S TOO HOT !” he cried, holding onto the tube anyway, because he knew that if he broke it he would be banned from the workshop forever.
And the Winter Soldier obeying the Avengers' orders ? How cool ? Sorry if you're offended that he's good in this fic or something, but I didn't want to bother with a wild Winter Soldier in the Tower when I'm trying to focus on feels, even tho it would have been very very angsty.
During that month, some things changed, and it almost looked like something disappeared during that time. Tony's world was slowly losing its colors.
“I thought I loved Bucky more. But I love them both just as much.” 'I want to die. I want to die. I want to die !' He wanted to add. But Natasha wouldn't care, she probably would tell him to go do it and release the world from the bully he had become.
Bucky’s heartbeat stuttered. Steve tensed, grabbing his childhood friend’s hand. “Bucky ? Are you waking up ?”
Natasha seemed to notice and she helped him sit, but her gestures were cold, nothing like they used to be.
Hey, a quick note to ask : HEEEEY SO WHO WANTS TO KNOW IF STEVE SURVIVED ? COZ HE MIGHT BE DEAD LOL I HAVENT DECIDED YET (wrong, i did, days ago) BUT THE REST OF THE STORY AINT WRITTEN
The messy haired scientist lifted his head and looked her in the eye. She was taken aback by the amount of fear and pain she could see, no, feel, in them.
“You couldn’t be awake for five minutes without crying out attention, hm ?” The doctor sneered. He removed Steve’s hand from his wound and started cleaning it, not bothering to tell Steve what he was doing.
They both froze, looking each other in the eye, one terrified and fragile, the other surprised and hurt.
Tony rolled his eyes and turned to Bucky. The man was holding a steaming plate of what looked like rice with vegetables and... Was that chicken ? Tony loved chicken.
“Oh.” He let out, a strange sort of relief washing through him as he understood what he had to do. “I know, now. Thank you Bucky.”
I experienced a little in this chapter, losing Steve in his mind in a weird way. I'm not sure what I did, it just looks like the dreams I get sometimes. I have freaking weird dreams, if you ask I'll tell you some :D
The five of them made cookies together, and it was an amazing experience, at first, and then, inevitably, the kitchen apocalypse.
“Bruce, it happened five minutes ago, and Steve is a supersoldier, I told them he could wait for you, who knows his medical file by heart, to get there.” deadpanned Natasha. She was really tired of everyone’s shit.
He remembered always having the news channel on on the tv of the level of the orphanage he was assigned to.  You never knew when Tony Stark would make another eccentricity.
“You will not tell anyone, because if someone else learns about this, then I will do it again, but this time, I’ll make sure no one finds me.”
Bucky frowned, trying to hold back his laugh as he assessed the situation. They had indeed been crowned.
Steve had thought that this guy why as far from adopting as he was from interesting romantically Tony freaking Stark one day.
Coulson looking at him like he is the best man in the world. Bucky smiling at him. Hugging him. Kissing him. Tony doing the same thing, calling him dear on accident then denying he ever used a pet name and blushing. Bucky calling him doll and smiling. Smiling. Smiling. Everyone was happy, smiling at him, at each other, at no one in particular.
“You're a funny guy, Barnes. So, I wanted to see you to check on your metal arm, would it be ok for me to open it and see if everything is in place ? I promise it won't hurt. Well unless something's broken, then I can't promise anything. By the way do you like it ? It can feel temperature and touch and pain, because most people think feeling pain is a flaw, but it's actually an asset.”
Horror paralyzed Clint as he saw the Winter Soldier bolt from behind the pile of rocks and run as fast as he could.
Steve stood up, careful not to do it too quickly. Faint memories of his pre-serum years came back to him : he used to cling to Bucky, or let the man carry him on his back. The soldier liked to make a game out of it so the blond wouldn't feel too embarassed.
During those two days, Natasha had approached and him and had asked him to let the Soldier out from time to time. She had claimed that she wished to speak to the guy, that the Asset was, indeed, an asset on the battlefield and that she wanted him to trust the Avengers. That it was important.
The title of the chapter might seem weird, but it's meaningful. In this chapter, Bucky starts to gain back control over his life, with the help of Thor, Clint, and Natasha.
Loki looked at him, pinched his lips and nodded, blinking a few times to chase the tears that had filled his eyes. He would be alright.
Anyway I love you and OH i almost forgot ! I had my Drama bac this morning (I'm in France so that was a few hours ago already) and I think I did alright ! You know why ? Coz when I woke up this morning I had nearly ten comments that showed you like/love my story ! And that warms my heart so much (even though some of you showed that by insulting Steve and telling me they don't know how the hell anyone could forgive steve after what he's done) (andshitIwroteforgetinsteadofforgiveandIgotthatterribleideathatwouldmakeyoukillmeifIwroteitbutImightonedayanywaycozImightbealittlesuicidal)
OMG MY COMPUTER WANTS ME TO KILL IT TONIGHT I CANT EVEN THIS IS THE HUNDRETH TIME I TRY TO POST THIS FUCKING CHAPTER AND NOW ITS THE INTERNET THAT'S NOT WORKING I HATE THIS COMPUTER THE ONLY THING YOU READERS CAN HATE ON IS MY COMPUTER AND IF YOU DO IT YOU WILL GET A FUCKING COOKIE BECAUSE I FUCKING HATE THIS FUCKING PIECE OF TRASH OF A COMPUTER.
As Bruce ranted about not picking fights in bars, Tony realized how much he had, indeed, messed up. He wasn't sure exactly when he had done something wrong, but he must have, if Captain America himself was so angry at him. Surely, it was about Bucky, but the genius couldn't help it, he felt drawn to the quiet man. And it felt very much like... No.
“Do not think that I am going to forgive him, but this is my business and mine only. The Avengers have nothing to do with this. I don't want to see Steve for a very long time, but we all still work as a team, and Captain America is an Avenger. No one is kicking anyone out."
Bucky was going to wake up in a new world, a world that hates him for things he hasn't done and probably won't even remember doing. Bucky was going to need him from the moment he opened his eyes again.
She obtained a nod, and Clint huffed. “Looks like you're speaking brainwashed Hydra assassin alright.”
But the grey eyed man couldn’t. Hell, he couldn’t even remember how he got there, in a coma, stuck in the darkness with for only company his own thoughts and the occasional sounds occurring in the room.
Tony had been focused on his Starkpad, trying to think of a more effective way of building Clint's explosive arrows, and avoid anything that had to do with any supersoldier.
Once he was battle ready, he called the elevator and stepped inside. Natasha and the Winter Soldier were inside too. Clint knew it wasn't Bucky anymore because the soldier's face was blank, and his usually soft eyes were dull.
Okay so today was very stressful but I coped by drawing loki strange and "giant grape from space" version of thanos with gamora sitting on his head. Oh, and Bucky, in a red star, asking who the hell is bucky.
The scientist glared at him before dropping his gaze to the blond’s wet hand. His eyes darkened even more, and Steve almost wished they had gone green. Hulk could punch and throw him against walls all he wanted, it was Bruce who inspired the most fear in Steve.
Bucky’s voice echoed from a place far away in his head. “I’m with you till the end of the line, pal.”
The inventor decided that it had been way too much time that he had been standing in the same room as his parents' killer and his ex-boyfriend, so he left, feeling the Soldier's eyes on him.
Pietro was woken up in the middle of the night by a strange noise outside. And there was a light that definitely wasn’t the moon lightening his house. He got up and tried to look outside the window, but the light blinded him. All he could make out was the figure of a man. The man waved at him.
“You're my personal chef now, Bucky” Declared the inventor jokingly. He didn't actually expect the guy to say yes, it's not like Barnes was going to spend his time doing his magic for someone like Tony.
“I just ran into an angry ex. You know, playboy and all that, it tends to annoy people a little bit.” Tony shrugged, but his tone was dark, and his eyes, clouded with violent memories. Bucky knew what it looked like, he saw it everytime he saw his face in a mirror.
Pietro barely knew how to read, but the letters were big and easy to decipher. ‘STARK’ and some other, smaller word, starting with an ‘I’ after.
Steve sighed as Loki instantly clung onto him, hiding his face in his shirt. He hoped that one day the boy in his arms would learn that it was okay to cry in front of his big brother.
So here he was, standing in a busy street after having escaped the orphanage and walked for hours to get to the city center. He was waiting for… Oh ! This one was perfect !
“Then I'll just go back to the Tower and maybe talk to him later. Tony said my place would be ready tomorrow, no ?”
And to all my regular commenters, I love you all so much, and can't wait for your comment ! I'm so excited to read what you thought of this chapter !!! <3<3<3<3<3<3
Bucky had been haunted by the cruel voices again, and the scream of terrified people. People he had killed.
“You could make it yourself, you cook way better than me. Look at my eggs, they don't even look eatable.”
Sitting on his left, between him and the door, a tall blond man was holding his hand, whispering softly about his childhood with someone called Loki, and smiling sadly from time to time.
Steve had told him that a serious Thor was a very rare sight. Right now, the god looked like someone had just died.
Steve had been the only person he had had any contacts with in the last two weeks, except for the doctors of course. They said that he seemed to be experiencing flashbacks of his life as the Winter Soldier, and that it was a normal reaction.
“What's wrong, punk ?” Had asked Bucky, confused, at the same time as Tony had shot back : “This is my tower, if someone should get out, it's you.”
And just thinking about it, Tony felt warmth in his chest and stomach, and his heart skipped a beat before going nuts as he remembered the moment of the dream where Bucky had kissed him.
It was Steve's turn to take a step back, scared that Tony was talking about Bucky. Tony took a step forward.
The bed was empty, but there was a stain of blood in the middle of it. Bruce would have worried if he hadn’t seen it earlier during his first visit.
The sight of the inventor was enough to make Bucky's smirk turn into a wide smile. He was so happy to see him again, even after two days.
Oh wanna be jealous of me ? I have those english orals to prepare for bac, coz I'm french and all, and I have four orals to do, and one of the notions is Myths and Heroes. I looked at it and I went "MARVEL." so now I am taking a break just to publish this chapter but then I go back to explaining how the marvel cinematic universe is a reflection of how our society is now. I am going to have so much fun doing this... Except the first part of the oral is about superman. And superman traumatized me with that woman who turned into a killer robot in one of those old movies. I was too young to see that ! Godamnit, parents !
Bucky had a warm plate in his hands, and Jarvis was leading him to... Wait, if they were going to the workshop, they would be going down, but they were going up right now.
Loki would want some drawing stuff. He was always forced to draw and then erase on the same piece of paper to economise for when he’ll be better at drawing, because Steve couldn’t afford paying too much things outside of the necessities.
“Hi Bucky, hi soldier if you’re in here too. Just so you know, Loki isn’t what Thor says. Loki’s evil. He made me… He… He mind controls people like us. Makes us turn against our friends, and kill people on our side. He seems like a great guy yeah, but he’s the god of mischief, don’t forget that. Now I don’t know if you hear me, I hope you do, because that’d mean your mind is alive in there,...”
Tony nodded and stood up, not even bothering to grab a gauntlet or any weapon on the way to Bucky's room. If the Winter Soldier woke up and killed him, it didn't really matter, no one would miss him. Not anymore.
It made Steve shiver. Anything relating to coldness, even behaviors, made him feel like he had felt for so many years. Asleep, but not quite. Dead, but only almost. Barely alive. Barely conscious. Just enough to want to scream. Not enough to feel time. Not enough to know if an eternity or a second had passed.
Hey everyone ! I love you all, I love you so, so much, I got so many hits and comments and kudos and it has barely been a week since I started publishing this story, but you all make me a little anxious, you know ^^"
The bowman smiled approvingly.  “You heard that JARVIS ? Take him to Shellhead.” The elevator started moving. “Oh and Bucky ? Call him Tony, he doesn't like to be called Stark by his friends.”
Shame tickled at the numb surface of his ocean of emotions. Steve could feel himself floating at the surface, face in the water, eyes closed. He could feel it. There was a tidal wave of self hatred coming his way. And it would not be the only violent thing this ocean would make him go through in the near future.
Tony had opened his mouth to start conversation, maybe ask Bucky if he needed anything, or if his metal arm felt alright, but at that same instant the door had slammed open, revealing Captain America, still sweaty from his morning run.
This chapter is not much, I tried to add some humour because heavy angst if very cool and addictive but you gotta breathe to go even deeper x)
Two minutes later the redhead informed the team with a bored tone that Captain America was able to fight, and Tony was about to go check on the supersoldier just to be sure, when JARVIS' voice filled his helmet. The AI sounded tense.
Bucky. Steve opened his eyes and lifted his head, looking at his boyfriend through his tears. A question burned his tongue. He needed to ask.
Also, I mostly ate pancakes in the past two days and I am very very stressed out. Meaning my writing may seem different. It's normal, it'll pass. (It'll show more in chap 14)
“You didn't answer my question. Who are you ?” The soldier insisted. Something was wrong. He could feel it. Something was so, so very wrong here.
I'm sorry this is so short. I just want more time to figure out what the hell im gonna do with the second part, it's about Bruce. Steve is supposed to do something stupid but I don't know how to make it at least a little realistic yet. Sorry. Your comments on this chapter (if you decide to comment) would help a lot. So please please please comment, I really need your support :(
He facepalmed at his own stupidity. Seriously, for a genius, he was the dumbest person ever when it came to people.
“I need weapons. SI guns aren’t that good, and this boy is a genius right ? He can improve them I am sure.”
“-ucking course he got sick ! Didn't anyone of you keep an eye on him ? No ?” The genius exploded. “I can't believe it ! You are his teammates ! And I understood, I got it that you didn't want him near me, I don't want to talk to him anyway, but you, you have no right to just what ? Abandon him like that ?”
Clint caved in within two seconds. And that was not normal. Tony needs at least one minute to manipulate Clint with his puppy eyes, and the inventor is very good at this art. All of this to say : Bucky's puppy eyes are a masterpiece.
I know the tags say Bucky has PTSD, but PTSD doesn't always mean flashbacks all the time, I know it coz I have PTSD. Thank whoever's listening tho, because it's not too bad, just some flashbacks and nightmares and wait why am I telling you all this XD I'm just saying, be patient, Bucky's PTSD will come.
He ran to the front door and found the dark haired boy with his back against the wall, staring at the stranger at the door.
“Steve woke up and unplugged himself from the heart monitor. Clint thought he was dead and ran into the room. I don’t know what happened in there, I left them alone as there was no emergency.”
Anyway, chapter 17... Well I haven't thought much about it yet. What about Clint's side of events and then it goes even after Steve... IM NOT SPOILING.  AH AH IS HE DEAD IS HE ALIVE NO ONE KNOWS BUT ME AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH *cough* hum.
“Well, there are a lot of papers to fill, and an investigation to be made, you should know that this is a long procedure, you will not be able to take Bruce tonight” Steve hadn’t meant to talk to the man on such an aggressive tone, but he couldn’t control it, he had really felt defensive.
And yes, Bucky calls Tony New Stark in his head, it'll pass in next chapter, but I found it funny and endearing somehow ^^
“Steve ! Steve stay with me you hear me ? I am going to fucking punch you in the face if you die on me !” Clint wanted to cry. This was not fair. He couldn't do anything, he was helpless, they were dying, the robots would figure out their location in a matter of minute, he had three or four arrows left, he couldn't do it. He couldn't.
As always, Bucky went mysteriously unannounced by the AI. It made the grey eyed man smirk and mouth his thanks to the artificial intelligence. He really considered JARVIS a friend by now.
short extract (did you know those are really hard to select, like, what the hell am I spoiling today ? Oh no not that, too spoily, not that, they'll get the wrong expectations, not that either it's boring...) :
I hate having so much work but at the same time I love my life because my english teacher (who is my favorite teacher) keeps teaching us about marvel (I don't learn much but it's the best classes I have ever had !!!! and he said he will cosplay as bucky barnes for next halloween. This actually got me nuts and I can't stop fangirling over it coz favorite teacher + fav character = death.
“I don't want him near you either.” Stated Bucky matter of factly as he entered the room too. “Breakfast ?” He asked Clint, his tone hopeful.
Steve layed on the ground, surrounded by dozens and dozens of drawings. His blue eyes where opened but not aware of the world around him. He was somewhere else. It felt cold. Icy cold. He could not move. He could not do anything. No one could hear him. No one would ever save him. No one would ever find him. If anyone even cared to search.
“Wait, Bruce.” Called Tony. And Bruce couldn’t say no to his science bro. Not over a stupid intuition.
It was a sunny sunday afternoon. Kids were playing in a snowy parc somewhere in a small town of Sokovia. Most of those kids were simply normal, laughing and running after each other and playing hide and seek. However anyone looking at this bunch of kids would notice one in particular.
“No, I’m not here to put you into jail, kid, I’m here because… Because… Uh.” The man eventually fell silent.
“The puppy eyes one ?” Clint seemed thoughtful for a second, and then smirked. “Why ? What was the other one ?”
“After analysing your recent interaction with the team and their vital signs at the time of the interactions, I believe they feel anger towards you, Captain.” Replied the AI.
“Is he going to be alright ?” Asked Tony in a small voice. He couldn't stop himself from caring, even though he didn't want to have anything to do with Steve. He hated it, but he couldn't stop loving Steve.
“If you’re not disposed to help me, then I’ll talk to someone else.” The man had said, before walking past the caretaker and climbing the stairs, towards Grant Ward’s office.
“Who are you ?” He asked in a soft voice, feeling like this man was terrified and ready to flee the room at any moment. And that wouldn't do because Bucky needed answers.
The man went back to his car and sat in the driver seat, before pulling out his phone and calling the contact named “AZ”. The person at the other end picked up but didn’t say a word.
“Bingo !” He whisper-shouted. There was so much money in there, he could buy gifts for all the kids of the orphanage now !
Ironman was somewhere in the sky, he had teamed up with Thor and they were now exterminating as much of the flying bots as they could. Natasha and Clint were on the other side of the street, the former Red Room assassin fighting on the ground, the bowman on one of the highest buildings, shooting a rain of arrows around his partner, and never missing.
Anyway, you're all so jealous right now x)) I know right. And he looks like Bucky, it's true, i had noticed it before. Oh and my physic and chemistry teacher is kinda like a skinnier bruce banner, he has the personality too, but more like a dad. My best friend calls him his spiritual dad (and yes, i'm talking about the captain america/deadpool mix of a best friend that I have)
“What are you cooking there, brother ? Is it for the man of iron ?” Asked Thor, looking at the vegetables over Bucky's shoulder.
The Asset nodded. “Current mission : keep target safe. Target status : injured. Doctors are needed.”
Bruce tries to help Steve. Steve doesn't want him to. The team minus two makes cookies. A secret is more or less unintentionally revealed. An octopus attacks the city. Bucky recieves a very unexpected but missed visitor. All in all, a normal day.
Steve frowned. He had theories, but he didn't want to torment Bucky. If the man had some time to adapt to the future before he started remembering the Winter Soldier, that was a gift.
Bruce looked at Natasha worriedly. She knew he had taken that in consideration, and she was lying to the archer. He didn't know if it was a good choice, because if one of them died during the trip to SHIELD medical, Clint would hate her.
He got shot by one of the robots. He couldn't bring himself to be fast enough to dodge all the shots, and he was getting hit more and more. He fell on his knees, and stayed there for a few seconds, trying to will his vision to focus. He stood up again and looked around, wondering why none of the robots were hitting him anymore. Strangely enough, the robots seemed to die one after the other, Steve didn't even need to touch them.
“You know, Bruce told us. How you haven't been eating. On purpose. I can't believe you did that to your own boyfriend. Oh well, I guess it has been some time since you two have actually been together, isn't it ? You know what, Cap ?” Clint’s voice broke. “I hate you. I hate you so much. You could have done better. You could have done so much better, if it wasn't for the weak human being you actually are. If Bucky dies, it's all on you.”
“Hm no boy, stay here please, I have a few questions for you.” Called the man as the child was turning away.
'I know !' Steve screamed inside, wanting to cry. But for once, he was the one wearing the mask of iron. Bucky needed him. Tony was going to be just fine. Right ?
Pietro ran back to his sister, who looked confused. The man stayed for a moment to make sure he hadn’t raised any suspicions that could endanger the mission.
/Sorry about that/ Whispered Winter. Bucky had grown more used to hearing the soldier's voice, but he wasn't used to hear so much regret in it.
“Target : Captain America. Mission : kill. No witnesses. Ready to finish the mission, waiting for orders.”
“Get. Out.” The blond supersoldier had growled between gritted teeth as soon as he had noticed Tony.
“No. But I didn’t tell him that he didn’t have the right to move yet and I’m pretty sure he already got up so now I’m gonna have to put stitches on him.” Bruce made up, before almost running to Steve’s room.
“Hey Steve, why aren't you getting along with Stark ?” Oh no. Steve didn't have any plan for this situation. Bucky kept going, seemingly thinking out loud. “I'd have thought you would make friends with Howard's son, I mean, it seems like he is a great person, a lot like his fath-” NO. Anger exploded in Steve's chest.
“I don't care, Tony. I don't want you near him.” Growled Bruce. “Or him” He added, pointed at the Winter Soldier, whose stare instantly focused on them, and... Was that fear Tony saw in his eyes ?
Bucky stared at him, surprised. Thor was the first one to talk to him about this. Most of the time he just pretended this part of his wasn't real, that it was just a big nightmare.
That night, Bucky went to Steve's room and stood in the doorway. Steve was curled up under the covers.
Hello. I'm dead inside. Too much orals to make too much, too much, too much. But at least I got to analyse Thor Ragnarok ! Yay ! So I said that Thor gets beat up by two women AND the hulk and basically loses all forms of dignity including his kingdom and in infinity war SPOILERS he loses his people too. And bro. Yeah I know too soon but Dan Howell triggered me yesterday with his comment to Phil. Dan or Phil, I don't remember, starts talking about Phil not looking dead inside or something like that and Dan stops, has that smiles that just TELLS YOU YOU ARE ABOUT TO GET TRIGGERED and asks in the sweetest fake sweet voice :  "Phil, how is Loki doing ?"... And that WAS TOO SOON OKAY ?! SPEAKING OF OKAY I'M NOT (i promise)
“Hey, Tone, no need to be so jumpy, it's alright, it's just us” Soothed Clint, and judging by the bowman's voice, the guy didn't understand the concept of 'leave Tony Stark alone he doesn't want your comfort' that the genius has tried to teach them all since they met.
The kitchen was crowded. Clint was sitting at the table, eating pancakes. Natasha was doing the exact same thing next to him, but she had more on her plate. Thor was watching Bucky Barnes make pancakes with interested eyes.
He remembered kissing those lips. He knew their taste by heart, knew how soft they were, how good they looked when Bucky smiled that teasing smile of his.
“Then why did you  ?” Asked Tony, and Steve hated how the inventor's voice was so small and stranggled. But what he hated even more, was the answer he was about to give him. It made him feel nauseous.
He wanted to say 'I love you' over and over. But it was probably too soon. Or too late, it depended of how one would look at it. However one thing was certain : it was not the time. So instead, Steve settled for : “I missed you”
I hope no one is crying too much. Or too angry coz I messed up. It kinda makes me feel weird to know that so many people read this. I have over 80 subscribers to this story, and we're approaching the 6000 hits. I just wanted to say thank you ! So you get a huge chap. With lots of angst. Coz you love that.
Bucky had long since stopped trying to talk, but he always mentally replied to his friends, because that was the closest thing to a conversation he could get. However this time he didn’t feel like replying. The new information about Loki bothered him, yeah, but it was not him who was bothered by this information the most. It was the Winter Soldier, who had been completely silent since the coma.
Thor smiled at him, sitting next to him on the edge. Their legs were dangling in the void, and it reminded Bucky of all the times he and Steve had sat like that to speak about everything that went through their heads and hearts.
“Mario kart is not useful, Clint” Natasha argued, sighing. It sounded like it wasn't the first time she said that.
In those last two days, he had spent time with Thor, listening to tales of Asgard and telling some of his own stories about world war two. He had avoided talking about Steve, though. Bucky felt like he needed some time away from the blond. He wasn't angry anymore, though. After all, a month had passed, and Bucky had barely seen Steve. The supersoldier seemed to have understood that Bucky didn't want to see his face, and had taken the habit to leave the room whenever Bucky entered. The raven haired man suspected that Steve did the same for Tony.
On a more honest note, it was not to get food. He didn't see the point of eating, these days. He didn't feel hunger, and food had no taste. He ate once a day, but only because he knew his body needed the energy.
Steve would have found it really nice and touching. Really, he would have. If he was able to feel anything.
I can't help but relate to Bucky so much these day. I got post traumatic amnesia and it's a true bitch. I wish I had someone like Steve, someone from the times that I forgot, to help me remember. But there is no one. I was alone. That's just my luck XD but anyway it doesn't matter that much, except that this story helps me feel better. and you readers and especially YOU commenters, motivate me to keep writing. So thank you everyone !! I love you !
Tony could see his science bro was concerned, really, he could, but he also couldn't tell the truth. No one wanted Hulk to run after Steve through the tower, and then kill Captain America, because that was how it would end if Tony told the truth. So he settled for a lie.
The other had dark eyes full of emotions, and was almost always drawed next to, using, or tinkering on a piece of tech. There were drawings on him, asleep on a couch, or on his desk, surrounded by metal parts, coffee cups, tools and tech cards. There were drawings of him, arms wide open, smiling with charism to an audience. There were other drawings where he smiled more secretly, almost shyly.
He quickly made the flower crowns and put a few petals on their clothes and around them, before putting the crowns on their heads.
Fuck, he had almost called him doll. But he couldn't help it, it was his way of well.. Show affection.
Steve did not speak again, for he was too weak to do so. He wanted to tell the AI that it's all he deserves for becoming everything he hates, but he was so tired. He wanted to sleep. He scratched at one of the burn marks on his body. His hand felt heavy. And he was sweating but he also felt so cold and he was shivering.
Tony jumped, dropping his coffee cup on the ground, causing it to shatter. The sound made memories of bombs and war and shrapnel tearing his insides appart play in front of his eyes.
He quickly checked the supersoldier's vitals and yes, the heart rate had augmented for a very short time right before Tony had called him.
There was something desperate in the assassin's voice that Clint didn't like at all. How bad was the situation exactly ? Why wasn't anyone else responding to the soldier's calls ?
“And before you ask, yeah, I think I pretty much heard it all. Come out now d-Tony. I got something to tell you.”
In a room not far away from Captain America’s, laid another supersoldier. The dark haired man was as pale as death, but his face looked as peaceful as if he was merely taking a nap.
Steve and Tony had glared at each other for what felt like hours, completely ignoring a very confused Bucky who didn't know what to do.
“Pepper, listen to me, they're so annoying ! There is NO logic in what they're doing ! It's not because I got a few broken ribs and that my face looked awful for a week or two that they have the right to treat him like that ! I bet he regrets it hell of a lot anyway ! I don't think Bucky even talks to him ! I am so DONE with them all ! I'm trying to keep this damn team together, and all they do is tear him appart everytime I trust them not to do so ! Can you believe it ? I can't leave them alone for a  month, because apparently, if I avoid Steve they ALL avoid Steve ! I...”
ALSO PLEASE DO NOT FORGET TO COMMENT, WHAT MOTIVATED ME TO KEEP WRITING CHAP 20 WERE ALL THE KIND AND AMAZING COMMENTS I RECIEVED ON ALL THE PREVIOUS CHAPTERS !!! <3<3<3<3
IMPORTANT INFO : We just created a bloopers and bonus work for this fanfiction ! Go check it out if you wanna laugh or see the orphanvengers' faces !
Bucky kept his face blank, deciding to hide the fact that he knew sign language for now. Deep down, he knew he was being sneaky, but he couldn't help it.
Bucky was sitting against the opposite wall, looking straight ahead, but not seeing anything. It was the same look. Thor wondered what happened but decided that it wasn't the moment. He needed to help them.
The genius closed his eyes for a few seconds then, and when he reopenned them, there was anger burning inside of them, like a wildfire.
Everything came back to him. The war, Steve, Captain America, Hydra experiments, the fall, and then... Then what happened ?
He felt needles in his arms, and, yes, that was usual. What had he catched this time ? Pneumonia ? Again ?
A first sob escaped the girl’s lips. And then another. Pietro took her hand and led her to a safe place into the woods, somewhere the agressive light couldn’t reach. Then he put an arm around his sister’s shoulders, and she instantly held onto him as if he was the only left that mattered for her.
The heart monitor panicked and then went flat, emitting a long insufferable beep that felt awfully painful for Steve's aching head.
He wanted to run in, hug his friend, tell him everything, beg him to wake up, come back to him, apologize to him forever and more. But he knew he had no right to even lay his eyes on his motionless ex-lover, let alone speak to him, even though the man probably wouldn’t be able to hear him.
Someone – a man, he sounded like Clint – outside the door screamed and Steve heard them running towards his room.
The moment Clint said it, the moment his venom was spit and the poison was in Steve's blood, the archer regretted it. He couldn't control himself. He was a monster. He saw the supersoldier's eyes widen in shock before his injured face fell into a blank expression. He saw the faint light in the blue eyes dim and die. The archer stood there, watching, not even able to move.
... So complicated. I hope you all get it, I'll think about it and sort it out later, though. You see I have a lot of exams starting from this week and until the 25th June. It's gonna be awful because I'm not even sure I'll pass, it's mostly sciencey stuff and I suck at sciencey things. Like, really. Why the L didn't I go in literature classes. I'm so dumb sometimes XD
They watched something about a man on a 'secret' mission with the maturity of a ten years old destroy eveverything all the time and give his name to everyone he met. Talk about undercover.
Seriously it wasn’t fair, he wanted to just do everything he wants today because it was his birthday, and okay he had done everything in order for everyone to forget it because he didn’t want people to feel forced to give him something. He knew they didn’t like him, having them giving him something with a fake smile would make him feel like he’s going to throw up.
Once they were away from any curious ears, Steve turned to Phil and whisper-yelled : “They’re selling our children ! Ward is selling the children ! We need to do something this isn’t right !”
Bucky put his chin on Thor's shoulder and returned the hug while observing the two spies, who were sharing glances.
He gently cupped Bucky’s cheek, and kissed his forehead slowly, closing his eyes. Taking his time. A tear rolled down his cheek.
The boy faced the man again. If he was with the police, he should answer his questions, that’s how it happened in the movies.
It was a slow process of course, but it had started a few hours after Steve's departure, and Tony had immediately been informed of the new progress. The doctors had estimated that Bucky would open his eyes on Thursday, two days later.
Everyone heard the name that the inventor almost pronounced, but no one commented on it. Natasha, however, noted how Bruce tensed.
Steve clenched his fists. He had to come in. He could bear it anymore. He missed Bucky too much. His former lover would never know he visited him anyway.
It was two hours later, when Bruce had cleaned Steve, the room, and himself, that the genius allowed himself to sit in the chair next to Steve’s hospital bed. He was exhausted. They were both exhausted. And it was a miracle that no one had came in.
But the genius was no longer watching him, instead, he was lost in thoughts. 'My' ? 'My Bucky'..? He fought back the sudden wave of jealousy. No, it wasn't like that, they were just best friends. Steve had said so.
Natasha was crouching next to Tony and speaking to him softly. She turned to nod at him before continuing to talk to the inventor about the date, the place and the recent events, then stopping and breathing loudly while JARVIS took over to speak about SI recent activities.
Their mom was probably cooking diner as their father was cutting wood. The sun has jud set and even though the western part of the sky was still on fire, the children could see the brightest stars starting to appear.
“I'm going to suit up and get the Winter Soldier out.” He called to Tony, who was already on his way to the workshop.
He has Captain's preserum looks, but he's taller, and has Deadpool's personality. It's explosive combined to mine. Our whole school thinks we're crazy, and 50% ships us. The other half thinks he's gay. One half is right, and I'm not dating him. x)
He hoped his healing factor had been numbed by the rest of his injuries, because otherwise it would be impossible for him to lose enough blood to die.
“Come on ! We have to run !” He shouted to his sister and he pulled her out of her room. They ran downstairs and then out by the kitchen’s door, which was on the opposite of the light.
So.. I'm gonna say it again : I'm sorry. You might be crying right now, it's okay, eat chocolate, cuddle something or someone, and remember : happy ending.. Or you might be furious. Then breathe with me. Deep breaths. Right. 1, you hold it, 2... Do it again. And again. Feeling better ? It's still too much pain ? I know, I know. Chapter 9 is all fluffy though. Well, almost fluffy. I mean, better than chapter 8, and there is a lot of progress on the Bucky/Tony side. And Bucky meets Thor. That's cool, isn't it ? Yeah, so cool x)
“Kill the robots.” The british voice spoke, and that's all the soldier needed to start moving. On his way, he grabbed an earpiece. He needed to be able to get orders if there was a change of plan.
A lot happened during the summer holydays... I got a boyfriend, he took me to many places and omg I never knew I was crazy enough to go to another freaking country with a man I had met less than two month before.
*big sigh* Anyway you just got that long speech because I'm tired of the reviews saying Steve is an asshole who deserves to be left out in the cold, beaten up, punched by rhodey (i like that one tho coz it wouldn't hurt steve that bad just bring him back to earth), and other hurtful thing, and that's when you don't want him to just die. So okay, I get it, my story, but your opinion, and you can have that opinion okay, I respect it. It just makes me feel like you're not getting it, and also.. Why so unforgiving ? Why ? It hurts to see humans so cold and unready to even understand.  But once again, I get it. Keep telling me how much you hate and want him gone it's okay, I'll work on trying to get you to like him as the chapters go :D
Next chapter is Steve and Bucky in the hospital. it contains bruce yelling, tony being sad and guilty, thor being overprotective, steve being suicidal, clint being a sad crying puppy, natasha being said puppy's pillow, and overprotective too. see ya im late for my math class (this sucks !)
Hawkeye looked at the target. “He's breathing. His pulse is normal, if not a bit weak. He looks paler than usual. He aslo have several wounds caused by the robots' lasers. We might need Bruce, the soldier is right.”
'Shit' cursed Bucky mentally. He was about to open his mouth to answer, to explain, but that's the moment the Avengers alarm chose to go off.
Tony really shouldn’t be feeling bad for a boy who didn’t hesitate before stealing his wallet and phone.
Behind them, Thor silently turned away and went back to the kitchen. It seemed he had surprised a conversation not meant for his ears.
Tony wanted him to stay. But this was bad. This was dangerous. He knew where his stupid heart was going with all this, and he refused to fall inlove again. It would only hurt.
So yeah, studying superman brings back bad memories, but I'll do it. *puts on ridiculously brave face* Because I can't go to germany til I finish my homework, uh Peter ? ;)
Because my friend and I are currently doing a project together. It's a Clint centric fic, full of angsty hurt/comfort. I give the ideas and plot, and she writes it. It is amazing guys. You are all going to love it if you read it.
My choice is to divide this story, this universe, in three stories. So I am gonna try to do it visually, so you don't get confused.
And yes, I decided that Bucky would take the thing about being in the future really well, fight me. The story does not focus on that anyway. I don't pretend to be writing something perfect, the characters are so much deeper than what I am writing, but I don't have the skills to do it like I should. Sorry.
Now, let's talk about next chapter. So chapter 15 is actually chap 14, part 2, because I split chap 14 in half, because it was too long. So chap 15 happens at the same time as chap 14, mainly from Bucky's point of view (spoiler, he's with Thor and Thor is just as oblivious about the whole situation) and then Tony's, when he is calling Pepper after the whole yelling at the avengers for not taking care of steve thing. And there is Bucky, and I won't tell you why you'll have to read.
So.. Yeah. I didn't get a lot of reviews on last chapter. Where are you all ? I can't write for anonyms, it's boring ! And pointless, I'm trying to get better at writing. If I don't get feedback, how am I supposed to know if you're liking it or not ? I get that you don't have the time, I do, but pretty please ? *puppy eyes*
He caught a glimpse of a metal arm before his vision blurred one more time, and then faded to black as he vaguely felt himself fall to the ground.
He then climbed up the wall. As soon as he landed on the other side, he grabbed all his stuff and entered the orphanage by the backdoor before quickly running to his room to hide the gifts under his bed. He’d put Loki’s gifts on the boy’s bed during the night and give the rest to the others the next day.
“You're a funny guy, Barnes. So, I wanted to see you to check on your metal arm, would it be ok for me to open it and see if everything is in place ? I promise it won't hurt. Well unless something's broken, then I can't promise anything. By the way do you like it ? It can feel temperature and touch and pain, because most people think feeling pain is a flaw, but it's actually an asset,”
“I'm awful, I, I had to choose, and I hurt him ! I hurt him and I'm still hurting him and I don't know what to do, oh my god I don't know what to do I'm so lost, I thought I was doing the right thing but now Ton-Tony is so broken and I thought he would be alright, I thought he didn't really love me, I tho-” Steve's voice died in his throat, and for several seconds he suffocated over the ball of emotions in his throat.
Bucky opened his mouth, closed it, looked away, and opened it again while studying the ground intently.
It was a normal evening at the Shield Orphanage. Natasha and Clint were nowhere to be seen, but if you asked anyone they’d tell you that they’re probably practicing their spying skills, because that’s their favorite game. Pepper was in her room doing her homework and the additional work she had asked her teachers to give her, because she wanted to be the best. Bucky was watching Steve, the only adult of the orphanage, cook diner. Those two were truly inseparable, Bucky followed Steve everywhere he went, and the caretaker truly didn’t mind.
“I do not wish to make you remember this, brother of winter. I just wanted to tell you that I understand, and I am here if you need me. I will not judge you for was they made you do. I don't think any of our friends will.”
Steve sat in his room, looking at all his drawings. They covered the ground now. They were mostly drawings of Tony and Bucky, but now the other Avengers had their drawings too. There was one drawing were everyone was sitting in the living room, reading, watching a movie, playing cards, or sleeping. Steve had added Bucky and thought that this could have happened, had he not fucked everything up.
/Iron-man ordered. The Asset no longer obeys to Hydra. The Asset is ready to comply to Avengers' orders. The Asset wants to keep us safe./
And then said secret arrives at the tower, and is found by Clint. The secret asks "Where's my mommy ?"
.AU3 : Steve stays dead, winteriron ending with Bucky dealing with Tony's issues after the trauma Steve left behind.
Okay so I know this chapter is short, and I'm sorry. I have a lot of work and it felt righ to stop the chapter there. It gives me more freedom about next chapter.
He was woken up by the avengers call. There was a bad guy in town. Again. It had been calm for the last few months. What was he hoping, peace never lasts.
Bucky resumed cutting the vegetables. He had decided to prepare something with rice, chicken, and some vegetables for Tony, he really hoped the genius would like it.
They stayed like this for a long time, just holding onto each other. Steve closed his teary eyes and listened to Bucky's heartbeat. Each beat seemed to sing Bucky's survival. Alive. Alive. Alive. Alive. Alive.
And I freaking struggled with it because omg wtf too many emotions to much stress I never at.. oh yeah.
The inventor’s voice was always low, a kind of quietness and vulnerability that Bucky had never heard before. It felt so intimate to be able to hear him, and to know exactly the kind of affection the Stark had for him… Bucky both felt like he shouldn’t be hearing any of it and like his chest would explode with warmth. He felt special.
For Pepper and Rhodey... I see them as.. kind of gone, like Sam. They're living their life away from all the actions of the Avengers. (It's a lot of characters to write, you know, and I suck at writing so when there are too many characters I tend to forget the plot or make it too complicated for my weak writing skills)
The blond had walked in on them playing mario kart in the common room. They weren't even trying to hide.
“You can make your own decisions if you have an idea that might help us win faster, but you'll need to inform us.” The arched told the Asset. He then turned to the redhead. “Tasha, does he have an earpiece ?” She nodded. “Do you know what we're up against ?”
The way back home from the parc was quite long and they were left on their own, but Pietro and Wanda didn’t mind. Their parents were way too busy to take them to town and even if they were just five years old, they understood that.
“Clint, watch your language.” Steve felt hope for a moment. Hope that maybe Natasha wasn't too mad after all, and maybe she'd defend him. “We don't want Tony to be any more upset, it's bad for his health.”
For a moment, Steve had just wanted to join them, sit next to them and hug them both. And then he remembered. The Winter Soldier. Howard and Maria's death.
Bruce smiling softly up at him. Thor walking towards him for a hug after returning from Asgard. Clint jumping on his back and hugging him from behind before making a bad joke. Natasha noticing his faint limp and insisting to wrap his ankle even though it would already be healed the next day.
The might make an appearance later in the story, though. Something like Bucky and Tony's relationship from their point of view, or maybe their uh.. OOPS SPOILER.
“Deal.” He said, before running to the bandages kept next to Steve’s hospital bed and starting to take care of the supersoldier.
“So I will get my Bucky back ?” He asked, hopeful, still staring at Barnes through the one-sided glass.
/Then I happened/ Replied a voice in his head... But it wasn't quite like a voice. More like an involuntary thought.
Bucky smiled widely at the mention of the arm, and he moved in front of him, watching the metal move smoothly and silently. Then, he turned to the blond.
Then a loud, cruel voice at the back of his head reminded him that he wasn't allowed near Bucky, and it brought him back to reality harshly.
“And I won't work with you on anything, not a single project, as long as you don't tell me what happened.” Replied the scientist, crossing his arms and frowning.
The Winter Soldier approached the Target. He assessed the Target's wellbeing and decided that the Target was barely able to fight and therefore shouldn't be out on the battlefield. Remembering Hawkeye's remark about sharing his ideas when it helps encouraged him to talk.
Tony, who had been staring at the shattered cup and spilled coffee until now, since he did not want to see Clint's concerned look, because as long as you don't see it it might not exist, quantum logic and all that, lifted his head and inspected the room.
“Cap ? Lost your tongue ? Did it disappear with your valors ? Because, you know, you had everyone a little confused. You did say that you don't like bullies, right ?”
Ok, before you start on the Clint hate, if you do spread clint hate in your comment, meaning : WHAT AN ASSHOLE or any insult, would it be towards me or any of my characters, your comment will not be approved. I'm sick of the hate, bad vibes are really what I need right now and I EXPLAINED, they're angry. They're going to calm down soon, and Clint will be regretting each and everyone of his words. You can say that he acted like an asshole tho. I mean it's not hate it's just stating the obvious... Just, don't insult anyone, kay ? My poor feels don't like it  at all ^^"
Tony, the Winter Soldier, Natasha and Bruce were all in the infirmary an hour later, watching an unconscious supersoldier. The Winter Soldier was holding one of Steve's wrist, feeling the soldier's pulse.
For the first time in what felt to him like an eternity, Bucky tried to struggle against his coma. Steve needed him. Steve. His Steve. His punk tried to kill himself.
For hours Steve would tell him over and over again that it wasn't him, it wasn't his fault, it was the Winter Soldier's, that no one blamed him for what the Winter Soldier had done – who he had killed - under the orders of Hydra.
And yes, right here, he could see all the raw fear melting into anger and violence. He knew that look. He sometimes saw it in the mirror, after a flashback, or a nightmare about the past.
For a few seconds, the genius didn't answer, and they just stared at each other while tension slowly filled the air.
Thor laughed loudly. “Of course I know that brother ! I really wish you two could meet one day. My two little brothers” Thor seemed lost in his own dreams for a few minutes, a soft smile on his lips.
The impact sent waves of pain through his body, and his vision went black for a second as he fell to the ground. He tried to get up, but couldn't.
