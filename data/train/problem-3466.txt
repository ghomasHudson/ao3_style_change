Jack was the first to grab the serving spoon and scoop himself a helping of the casserole and half a plate of greens. Castiel was heaving some pot pie, too, when Gabriel came back with three Bordeaux glasses and a bottle opener.
Hiding the fact that his heart warmed at Dean going out of his way for their not-date, Castiel nodded in acknowledgment.
Castiel deflated. Gabriel was one of the very few people he could tolerate freely and could tolerate him. He appreciated how Gabriel never made him feel like he wasn’t accepted. Balthazar was a good friend, too, but sometimes he could be overbearing. It was Gabriel who truly adjusted to Castiel, but at the same time made his own little nook in the older man’s life.
That day, Castiel quit his job and called his older brother, Gabriel, to tell him he’d figured out which craft he wanted to embark on.
It rang in his ears, over and over, causing not only a lacerating pain in his skull, but an unfathomable, dismal ache in his chest.
Castiel took him into his arms, engulfing him in a comforting hug, and Balthazar held onto it tightly, blinking the tears back. “Thank you, Cassie.”
Dean’s knuckles grinded on the steering wheel. “What are you on about?” Castiel’s eyes narrowed at the man. “Are you telling me you’re
“Gabriel and I are going to do our best to convince him, Jack. One way or another. We know how much this means to you.”
Dean was reeling, attempting to hide his pathetic response to Castiel’s revelation. Instead of dwelling on it, he hoped to unearth the becoming enigma that was Castiel, veering, “Why Lawrence, then?”
“I’ve known him since the day he was born,” Castiel confessed. Dean’s mouth parted a little as a fry in his hand fell to his lap. “Damn. That long?” Dean peered sideways to check if no one was looking and ate the fallen fry.
Castiel smiled slyly. “Unlike you, I didn’t make the mistake of leaving that information in the database. Good luck finding out.”
,” he drawled, “But those people—people you say I hurt—they deserved it! They were horrible people! They were mean, stuck-up little brats that needed a reality check. So, yeah, maybe they did fall into my trap, maybe I did love ‘em and leave ‘em, but I’m telling ya—they got what was coming to them.” Dean heaved definitively. He had never put what he did into words, and hearing them out loud, coming from his own mouth no less, it did give him a vague sense of shame.
The day was pretty much an excuse for sloth, just lounging around and picking a random film they could put on. Both of them had been entirely unproductive (Dean would beg to differ; apparently watching a movie is still
Dean had given the swing a few more shoves after that, to regale the brunette with a longer time on the swing and higher altitude to boot. Cassie had howled in exuberance, and every peal of laughter gave the small boy’s heart a persistent tug.
Laughter reverberated in the auditorium, like it usually does when its professor not-so-subtly expresses his disdain for anything kitsch.
“Are you—?” Castiel took a sharp breath. “Are you trying to get me to fall in love with you?” It was a good thing that Dean had already swallowed the food, or else he would’ve started choking again. “What? Nah, man,” he said weakly. “I, uh. I decided that you aren’t my type.”
Dean cocked a brow at him but said nothing. The engine burst to life and Dean placed his hand on the clutch, aiming for
Castiel was at an impasse. There were few moments in his life where he hadn’t known what to do next, no contingency plan, probably could be counted on his fingers, but this was definitely on top of that list.
Castiel had been curious. He hadn’t expected the man to use his actual first name. But then again, he hadn’t expected that there was another immortal wandering the earth apart from himself.
He felt conflicted, not really grasping why a feeling of uneasiness made its home in his gut. As he stood confounded on Castiel’s walkway, the box of all-meat-and-cheese pizza and bag of crisp, green apples sat quiet on Dean’s arms, and all of a sudden, made him lonely.
It was past 5 p.m., and Dean had left around 3, telling Castiel that he needed to run some errands—specifically food-related ones, as he was gone for an entirety of four days and his motel’s fridge needed replenishing. Castiel had asked if he could buy him some apples, because his kitchen was sorely lacking some fruits, and Dean had promised not to forget.
Castiel drew a long sigh as he went to the frontmost area of the sanctum. “I don’t understand. Could we have just. . . imagined it?”
He drifted back to the time he was held up in a departmental meeting, Dean telling him he had to swing by the grocery for some pie. Castiel had asked if he could buy some things for him, and it easily turned into a list.
He heard some shuffling before the door was opened by a man around his 40s with dark, cropped hair and a fashion style that was significantly gruffer than those of other faculty members.
Dean replied muffledly, “Used to.” He swallowed before continuing, “My little brother, Sam. Back when we were still kids, Sammy and I used to be left alone at home all the time. Our parents were always busy with their jobs.” He rolled a shoulder. “When they’re not trying to rip each other a new one.”
Dean kept humming to the song as Castiel let his temple rest against his forearm on the counter so that his view was the white-painted column of the kitchen doorway. “I didn’t get to jog today.”
“Okay. How about. . . Since I’m still studying the characteristics, how many times have you given a piece of your soul?”
“After? I don’t really know much about after. . . Except maybe that one of his closest friends built a school around Uncle Bobby’s plant baby. And made his soul piece into an artifact.”
To make matters more disturbing, he turned the small mechanism on the doorknob, effectively locking anyone out—or maybe locking themselves in.
Castiel turned off the engine, biting his cheek as he slipped a hand in his coat and pulled out the two admission tickets he procured two weeks ago. “Yes. The Douglas County Fair. It’s here for six days, and I picked the midweek because there are fewer people. To be honest, getting tickets was quite intimidating because I don’t really go to events like these, and it’s really embarrassing as a centennial but if I may say so myself, the difficulty was not unfounded—”
Then it was gone. Now it was a teenage Dean straddling his motorcycle and donning his helmet as he glimpsed back at his house—not home, but a house—as he kicked the engine to life. Every move a step away from the childhood he hated with a passion as a soft, familiar “go, Dean” reverberated in his mind.
“It just seems to me,” he juggled the words in his head, “that maybe you still feel like you’re on foreign territory. And I want to help you rediscover Lawrence.”
Reaching the floor landing, they tried to quicken their pace, but passing by the Chamber of History, it was Castiel who heeded the double-doors that were ajar.
“And now, a magnificent southern magnolia stands proud in the middle of KU campus—where Bobby Singer had given himself to the world.”
Mouth settled on a flat line, he dawdled to the doorstep, trying to peek inside, to find any indication that someone was home, and Castiel simply left his god-awful car somewhere else.
Dean continued arguing that he needed his brain food, but Castiel only insulted him with a “What do you need the brain food for, no-brainer?”
They’d spent the whole night just lounging around the TV and wolfing down the delectable, beautifully made pie.
“Really, Balt? Your pajamas were ripped and that didn’t raise any red flags or strike you as odd?” Castiel reprimanded exasperatedly at his friend, and said friend’s face fell.
Dean was already mentally cursing at himself, not noticing the sidelong look Castiel gave Jack, speaking volumes for him.
Dean didn’t miss the way Castiel smiled softly when a young boy around age 5 Naruto-ran to the grassland, his mother chasing him with a giggle.
“So, guess we’re back to square one,” Dean pierced the silence, tipping his head onto the glass of the window, the sunshine outlining him artfully.
And when it was well past midnight, with Dean’s large duffle settled in the guest room, he and Cas stood awkwardly by the corridor, trying to temper their nervosity at such a swift and monumental shift in their relationship.
“So, Cas.” Dean rubbed his hands together, somewhat excited. “I actually want a dandelion today. ‘S my mom’s favorite. I mean, she’s back in Kansas but I like to keep a reminder, you know?”
It chagrined him. But Dean wasn’t one to back away from a challenge. He prospered in it. So, Castiel Milton, Ed.D., Ph.D. who had merits that paralleled the chancellor’s, get ready for Dean Winchester.
When they’d met up that night at Castiel’s, Dean handed him two bagfuls of produce and when Castiel inquired where his pie was, only then did Dean realize that he forgot his beloved pie, cursing at himself in utter dismay.
“Are you okay, Dean?” Castiel asked in concern when Dean wouldn’t look at him as they navigated through the bustling fair.
By the time they’d taken notice to the dimness, they had finished the food, stuffed and sated. Castiel had pushed some of the leafy greens to Dean’s plate, and this time, he had accepted it without protest.
. Dr. Shurley and Dean remained outside as the chancellor narrated as though in a documentary, “Well, in the late 1800s, soul scarcity had been coined. It was a time of great despair, because people were losing pieces of their soul in a rather rapid pace. No one seemed to realize what spurred the occurrence, but most of them were either dead or dying. Until now, historians are baffled as to where given soul pieces went, because no one had been gaining soul pieces during that time.”
Castiel looked at Dean—really looked at him. He was still fairly young-looking. Minimal wrinkles, a stubble that complemented his cropped light brown hair, and oh, freckles for days. His eyes, emerald as ever, were pulled in a careful stare, as though a montage replaying in his mind, and suddenly it was easier to picture Dean as a boy; all gangly limbs and delicate features. A picture of a doting brother: him taking care of a smaller sibling and watching said sibling grow up and grow old, but not loving him any less. If Castiel knew anything more familiar, it was loss.
“Wanted a soul piece to yourself because no one could ever love you? That must be it, a stuck-up little virgin couldn’t take the perpetual dry spell, right?”
“I wasn’t sure you’d come,” the voice uttered, quiet, raspy, and somewhat unsure. Dean narrowed his eyes at the cryptic statement. “What do you mean?”
But he had his badge out before she could finish. “FBI Agent Smith. Please don’t finish that sentence.” Dean flashed his charming grin.
Castiel choked on his wine, setting it down and dabbing his mouth with a tissue, clearing his throat a bit. “Excuse me?”
“Unfortunately, not yet. But my associate and I are here to ask you some questions that might help.” Castiel leaned forward attentively.
“What do you mean ‘it’s locked?’” Castiel shouldered Dean, trying the handle for himself but also coming up empty. “No, no, this cannot be happening,” he mumbled under his breath as Dean’s palms covered his face in exasperation.
And Ash had not disappointed him. They had also found the sole person in history who had not yet achieved Soulshift past their 50s—aside from Castiel, of course—Dean Winchester.
With everything settled, Dean popped the beers open with his ring (mostly to impress Castiel), and handed him one which he took appreciatively. Dean held his bottle towards Castiel, and his friend reciprocated the gesture.
“Gentlemen.” He overtook Dean and Castiel, but not before grabbing the side of Castiel’s head and placing a chaste, thanking kiss on his hair. Castiel squirmed but it was too late, and Balthazar was already walking away with his briefcase, and Dean felt an unpleasantness at the pit of his stomach.
“Balt,” said Castiel placatingly before Dean could open his mouth. “I know. We believe you.” His eyes fastened on Dean, imploring
Castiel took the information in stride this time. “Then most of your soul-giving must have started and revolved during the normal adulthood. That’s good. At least we had something right.”
His business was only almost a year-old but it was quickly gaining recognition. The reviews for Eden’s Garden almost always contained a praise for the owner’s solicitous accommodations and ability to cater to every client’s needs. Anyone who knew Castiel would regard him as industrious and good-natured. He was the kind of person to wish a patron a good day and actually mean it. Castiel was a sweetheart, and the steadily lengthening roster of faithful customers was rewarding him generously.
Castiel sighed, sounding resigned. “No, I did not. I didn’t know the security footage was stolen early on, so when I found out before the cops could question me, it was in the spur of the moment that I had said I was home the night of the 11th. I knew it would just draw unnecessary attention to say that I had been here.”
Dean placed his hands on Castiel’s arm, attempting to judder him into awareness. When Castiel didn’t respond to his touch, he resorted to pulling Castiel into his arms for a semblance of comfort, but found the position quite awkward. He flashed his phone around and saw the nearest wall. Dean wiggled towards it, towing Castiel with him, and he stowed his back onto the concrete. Castiel was heavier than he expected, but he dragged him by his arms and carefully laid the man’s head on his lap as he continued to keen, so that the back of Castiel’s head faced Dean’s stomach.
, he mouthed to him, away from Garth’s view, but the man was already back on the floor, skimming the multitude of photographs.
“You good?” asked Dean, checking him for injuries. Castiel only nodded as they descended, careful with their footing.
But then Castiel’s eyes darted back ever so subtly at the cooing babe who had her arms up and flexing her wee fingers. Dean caught the curiosity and wariness that flashed ephemerally on the immortal’s face.
“You’re cold?” Castiel asked, but before Dean could form a reply, he had already begun shoving off his trench coat.
They exchanged back and forth opinions and angles about the topic of Jack’s essay, asking here and there about Castiel’s area of expertise, all the while walking to the South Park Gazebo as they usually do. The weather was perfect, too.
Dean furrowed his eyebrows. He felt like he was given a revelation but unsure as to how to interpret it.
She held the door open for Dean, moving with grace and purpose. He walked in to see the largest office in the building, and the most elaborate.
“You seem a little quiet tonight, little man,” Gabriel noticed when Jack didn’t speak the toast. “Is everything okay?”
• The original 1/2 of this chapter was actually lost to me because it didn't save in my documents. I was so upset and frustrated that I actually sobbed. I tried rewriting it while it was still fresh from my mind (it was 2 a.m. when I finished). Unfortunately, I feel that it isn't as good as the first time around. I tried my best though.
Dean regarded him thoughtfully. “Are you preemptively deciding that you don’t like babies because you’re scared of being rejected by them?”
The door opened to a blonde woman who seemed distressed, a patch of wetness staining her top. “Can I help you?”
It didn’t even matter. His perception of Dean Winchester might have evolved through the weeks, and he might be harboring tenderhearted feelings for the man, but it just goes to show how their friendship had grown. It didn’t mean that it
Castiel headed the opposite way Dean was marching to, ignoring the man’s directions. Dean saw Castiel’s back over his shoulder and dubiously followed. If he had been indisposed, then by the time they reached Castiel’s Lincoln Continental, Dean was thoroughly appalled.
He crossed the right aisle to the end by the entrance, picking up the strewn lavender rose, sniffing automatically and smiling when he smelled the faint fragrance lingering.
Castiel thought sullenly, as the fading light played on Dean’s features, highlighting his gorgeous freckles, and he wished he could run his hands over them and give each one a kiss.
Then Castiel turned his head, the blue meeting the green like an oasis trysting with desiccation, and with feet on the ground, he and Dean felt that second what it was to soar.
Dean breathed heavily in relief at that, like the air he was holding since the moment he slid into his Impala this morning was finally emancipated.
He arrived at the last office on the right, tiptoeing when he passed Castiel’s office, and politely knocked. He’d already interviewed Balthazar so there was no need to subject himself to that grievance again.
“C’mon, Cas. Let’s go get some hotdogs. I saw a cookie stand over by the water gun. Maybe a last game before we go? I’ma beat your ass in bumper cars.”
They almost went at each other before Dean clenched his fists, willing himself to relax, calmly remind the pestilent man that they made a truce not to drive each other crazy, said that he was going to order Chinese, and if Castiel didn’t want any, he could serve himself a large helping of malnutrition.
She snapped out of it and stepped aside to let Dean in. “Nothing at all. Dr. Davies and I were just going over the next term’s curriculum. Please come in.”
Castiel grimaced at his own image grimacing back at him, the dark blue shirt peppered with small white polka dots he had donned fitting him quite nicely, but he couldn’t tell for sure. He never really had much of a style worth a penny, what with his tan trench coat usually sufficing.
Dean nodded and offered him his card. “Don’t hesitate to call if you remember anything that might help.”
Castiel shook his head, but it was tinged with soft resignation. He was forming a reply in his head when the familiar honk of a particular ‘67 Chevy sounded from the driveway, jolting him upright, effectively forgetting the text altogether.
There in the photo were three men, all looking prime and young. A man that resembled the humongous portrait in the Chamber of History on the left, a man similar to the cogent painting in the chancellor’s office in the middle but younger, and a black man already sporting a mustache on the right. They were in front of a truck with what looked like a dilapidated junkyard as the background.
“Agent Smith. Castiel.” They stopped in their tracks at the rickety voice—speaking of octogenarians. They turned around and there was Chancellor Shurley slowly making his way to the pair. Castiel beamed (
They took Castiel’s car, and they arrived at the nearest ice cream shop at Massachusetts St. within 10 minutes. It was a quaint, little parlor, and it served Jack’s favorite, so they had made it a habit to go there once a month.
“Shit. I spoke too soon,” Castiel heard a voice near him say. He could see nothing but utter blackness, until a small glow appeared beside him, giving off a meager luminescence to Dean’s face. Then a ray of light shot from the back of Dean’s phone to the door.
who Dean was. And he couldn’t understand how that was possible. “A bit sanctimonious for you to solve crimes when you're committing the greatest misdeed of all."
“Oh,” Dean said with a cheeky grin, “I’m sorry, man—doctor, I didn’t see your name there. Let me get outta your way.” With that, he turned the engine on, put the car in reverse, and transferred to a slot where he made sure twice that no one’s name laid claim to it. When he got out of his car, the doctor had parked his Subaru Outback in its rightful place.
Dean had researched it and found bits and pieces, but where better to find an accurate account than from the school itself, and from the chancellor no less?
Dean shushed him again, louder this time, and coming in front of where Castiel was clicking his briefcase closed. “Do you want me to blow my cover?!”
This time Castiel laughed, and his shoulders moved with him, so it would seem, from what Dean could discern in the goddamn low lighting they’re struggling with.
“And I ask dad on a regular basis to give me 6-month vacations twice a year, but we can’t always get what we want.”
The day ended well, Castiel believed. His spirits had lifted because of Jack, and the adverse occurrences rooted on one Dean Winchester were buried at the back of his mind. Arriving at his office, his plan was to pull an overnight shift to get started on his keynote speech for Rome.
“Uhh. What is happening?” Gabriel asked, half his bearings gathered, as Chuck slipped a phone into his son’s pocket, while another remained on his hand. “Yes, do explain.”
Jack hissed a ‘yes’ and beamed gleefully. “Thank you, Cas. Really. I don’t know what I’d do without you.” Castiel shook his head, tittering. “Just don’t lose your head, okay?”
“I believe you said that I ‘owe you one,’” he finger-quoted, and Dean had to stop himself from laughing at the winsome motion. “How about some breakfast? I have no class today.”
They met one fortuitous Thursday when Castiel was scandalized by the amount of orders coming in through the shop telephone. His customers were varied from those commissioning him for a small wedding to reserving a get-well bouquet for pick-up tomorrow. It was unusually hectic because his hired help, Charlie, had asked for a personal day, and Kevin, the kid in advanced placement that part-timed for extra money wasn’t available.
“Alright, Mrs. Lopez, I’ll have them ready for you by opening. Of course. Always, Mrs. Lopez; you know me. Enjoy the rest of your day, and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.”
“Balt. Shut up.” Castiel reached an outstretched palm to Dean, and he placed his phone on it, the video ready to play, as he half-sat on Balthazar’s desk, with Dean by the window. “Watch this.”
“Balthazar. He was in this very building the hour of the theft. Funny how you and your friends tend to do something and tell the police otherwise,” he recounted, already pulling his phone and bringing up the file to show Castiel. The man’s head shook in repudiation. “Improbable. Balthazar would never—he couldn’t—”
“You’re being unreasonable. He’s unaware that he’s been roaming around unconsciously. I think he warrants a little more doubt than that,” Castiel argued, coming up behind Dean as he tried to work the door open.
“I know how badly you wanted to go. Well, let’s go,” he said, eyes twinkling in hope. Aaron had melted in reply. Lips tugged in a coy smile but eyes utterly and completely impassioned. It was inarguably one of the best sights he had set his eyes on.
“Well, that was the fastest aftershock known to man,” declared Dean and Castiel bowed his chin to his chest defeatedly.
“Dean, I. . .” he began, the man directing his head to him. “I know I said some things. . . Some hurtful things to you. And I’m sorry. It’s not right for me to judge you, especially as I don’t wholly know you. When you came into town, I admit I felt threatened by your strangeness and unfamiliarity, not to mention your immortality, but it had stirred old mechanisms and behaviors in me. That was unfair. For that, I apologize.”
“To existential, as well as essential freedom.” Castiel winked, plonking his bottle against Dean’s with a playful flick of his wrist, and Dean erupted into fits of laughter at the adorable motion. And he also got the reference due to being around the professor for days on end, so there was that.
Dean raised his hands in abnegation. “Hey, I’m not telling you what is and what’s not. I’m just answering your question.”
They ate their meals in a comfortable silence, and when Dean finished his, he fidgeted with his soda cup, his nerves buzzing in anxiety at what he set out to ask Castiel once he got back.
Unable to fully commit, Dean asked, “You really believe that? That people can be saved? That I—I can change?”
“I do.” Dean was surprised at the adamancy etched in the syllables Castiel uttered, and Castiel himself didn’t know where it came from. Despite it, he gave Dean’s knee a reassuring squeeze before returning his hand to his thigh, and Dean gave a flimsy smile in a silent thank you.
Mike drew back and placed her forearms on the sofa. “I lived my life here, agent. Graduated 1992. Got my Ph.D. by 1997. I’ve been a professor here ever since.”
“How very. . . existential,” he said pensively. “Existentialism holds that we possess the freedom and power to make choices, that we are not held down by our past, and that ultimately, we get to choose who we are. I’ve always had a proclivity for that perspective.  Though I do still discuss determinism with my students objectively. Give them the chance to decide what they want to believe.”
Castiel wanted to protest when the man told him to keep the change, but he grinned beatifically at him that Castiel was once more rendered speechless.
“How may I assist you today? This is your first time here, yes? My services range from flower arrangements to catering to small occasions. I don’t have the manpower for large events yet, so I’m afraid I’m going to disappoint you if—”
Benny’s lips quirked at the corner, a fragile twitch, before the blue was lost to the world forever.
“Dude, are you trying to kill yourself? We are going to fill you up with burgers on the way back. No nonsense about rabbit food or losing momentum.” Dean buttoned his suit jacket and they made their way to the front door. It was Castiel who rang the bell.
Remembering to buy cotton candy, he surreptitiously skipped his way to the candy stall, holding a squirrel in his arms.
She jutted her head forward between them, knowingly and expectantly, and the two men reflexively leaned forward to give each of Rowena’s cheeks a kiss.
Castiel beat Dean in talking. “Are there any historical facts that your ancestors passed down onto you regarding Bobby Singer and/or his remaining soul remnant?”
They shared a quiet moment, something they found themselves having more often than not; a soft, subdued exchange that needed no words. The blue meets green, the green meets blue, and they both implicitly know. Feel.
Jack laughed a little before taking his seat across Castiel. “Well, I just came from Uncle Gabe’s office. I had his help for the more discreet historical aspects, but I wanted to get some philosophical viewpoints from you. It really helps my essays.”
They ascended to the third floor, fortuitously encountering Balthazar exiting his office who spotted Dean and him together.
The bartender, Jo, got back almost immediately and placed the bottle in front of Dean, disappearing again to the back. He took a swig graciously before ambling towards Castiel, beer in hand, sitting himself on the chair rather unceremoniously, heat creeping up his neck, but he cleared his throat to push the unfamiliar anxiety down.
The man straightened until he was only slightly slouched, and made for the coffee with both hands, briefly brushing skin with Dean. “I only state the truth.” Castiel took a sip, his gaze steady on Dean above the rim of the mug.
“Anything specific you wanna know, professor?” Ash had asked him, continuously clicking on the laptop’s button, to which Castiel replied simply, “Everything.”
He nodded again, but this time he wore a precarious smirk. “What about you? Don’t you consider this a metal death trap, too?”
Thankfully, he didn’t seem to notice Castiel. He went backstage, encasing his guitar and going to the bar opposite to where Castiel was. Still, Castiel could see his figure slump down a chair and gesture at a bartender. The guy got him a tall glass of what looked like beer, and Castiel licked his lips as he shifted slightly to his right to stare sideways at him.
His whiskey-smooth voice pervaded the room like a blanket, and Castiel wanted to wrap it around himself and never be free. Dean definitely had the talent to go big. Plus, he was more than easy on the eyes.
“So how does it feel to live a hundred years and still be a virgin?” Castiel rolled his eyes at that, but the heat that usually accompanied their banter was truant, and he wasn’t sure that he missed it at all. It was now replaced by a vague sense of comfort, of levity. Castiel didn’t want to admit that he liked it.
Dean frowned. “You remember Dean but not Smith?” He narrowed his eyes at the professor’s goofy grin, but eventually caved in.
Rowena emerged from the arched doorway that connected the dining room and the kitchen, holding a round ceramic with dark mittens and setting it down at the center of the table. She placed her hands on her hips, mittens notwithstanding, as she turned to her husband.
Castiel’s gaze held onto Dean’s, and as an afterthought, Dean internally berated himself that it probably wasn’t the bro-est thing to say. But Castiel smiled shyly, looking pleased, and his self-scolding was derailed when he replied—
He didn’t know what to say, so he just speechlessly nodded and ambled to the booth the man pointed to.
She ushered them into the house, accepting Castiel’s bottle of wine wrapped with a bow, and into the dining area where Gabriel was already enjoying his first glass of the night.
Gabriel gave a harrumph of indignation. “I’ll have you know that in the duration of my existence, Cassie has never willingly spent that much time with another person who isn’t family. You’d have to drag him from the depths of hell to get him to socialize.”
“The size of Texas? That’s your retaliation?” But the guard in his voice decreased, and he seemed a little wary.
They hadn’t even noticed that the walls that they were wearing around each other had pulverized into nothing, not unlike the space between them.
He glided away from the counter at the farthest end of the shop, where the storage room was nestled, meaning to greet the customer, but a single stray of purple laid on the floor caught his attention.
Dean thought in rapture, the piercing blue eyes gazing back at him, intense and mellow at the same time. And like always, he wanted to believe that every single tender look Castiel had was solely for him.
“Remember that the world is made of dichotomies which give each other balance. Day, night. Fire, water. Yin and yang. Nature versus nurture. ‘For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.’ But we’re not here to talk about Einstein.”
“I meant the earthquakes. I trust you know what earthquakes used to entail before the 20th century.”
Dean expelled a sigh of relief at that, and Castiel looked at him with bemusement. He didn’t think Dean would pass up a chance to kiss a woman as easy on the eyes as April.
Dean’s lips quirked at the corner. “No, but I could send an email to Chancellor Shurley with all of these photos.” He pushed the folder towards Castiel.
He had talked about how Rowena and Gabriel fitted each other perfectly, and that no one would tolerate Gabriel’s childishness but Rowena, and he had found himself meaning it.
“Completing?” whispered Castiel, leaning closer to him unknowingly, enthralled. Dean’s everything held onto the word raptly with a faint, bated gasp.
“The Silver Fragment, as it is officially known, is a small glass orb that could fit in the palm of your hand that cocoons the remnants of Robert “Bobby” Singer’s last piece of soul. Mostly it’s just traces, swirls of silver. It’s not technically a soul piece, as most people erroneously call it, but it’s the closest thing we have to glimpsing the genuine form of a soul. People all around the states that come to visit the Silver Fragment often report differing feelings when facing it; mostly positive feelings like contentment or peace. It’s been a modern tradition that one must visit the Chamber of History in KU at least once in their life,” Castiel explained in what Dean liked to call ‘Professor Mode’ when he had asked him what he knew about the soul piece.
It was their third fight of that week. It was becoming unbearable. Dean could only take his younger brother Sammy’s clammy hand and assure his worried frown that everything was gonna be okay before they shot out the door faster than you could say custody rights.
, he had said, and told her to continue with the remaining five files. Charlie had told him to be careful. And Dean had told her that he was always careful.
A few 'oof’s' and 'that was close' resounded nearby, and Dean breathed through his mouth, calculating.
And as though completely missing it, he grinned at the sunflower. “Perfect. You’re a miracle worker, Cas. A bit big, but it’ll do. It’s perfect.”
“When Nietzsche published his book in 1872—The Birth of Tragedy—many contrasted its theme to his alleged nihilistic orientation. In his book, he introduced two creative energies: Apollonian, the rational, and Dionysian, the irrational—both derived from the eponymous deities. In other words, intellect and passion; mind and soul; thought and feeling; brain and. . . heart. For those who marvel in that kind of terminology.”
Now Castiel knew everything there was to know about the elusive Dean Winchester, from the Impala he had bought in ‘67 to the numerous victims and witnesses involved in mysterious and seemingly unsolvable crimes that had described a tall, brown-haired man, handsome and charming, that had introduced himself as FBI, later finding out from the real FBI that they had not yet sent their agents to them, but the man had helped them in their situations nevertheless.
Castiel saw the sort of tender brood that seeped into Jack’s feature at the sound of his words, albeit paltry. Castiel realized maybe that wasn’t the wisest response. So he sought to take it off Jack’s mind. “What will you be doing this summer?”
“I do, don’t I? But yours are larger than Texas,” he quipped. He nabbed a photo from the folder and showed it to the slightly shorter man. Castiel’s eyes grew at the photograph, but before he could study it further, Dean returned it to the compilation and continued nearing the desk. Castiel back-walked away from it.
“Thank you,” he whispered to both of them, and Chuck ruffled his hair affectionately, earning a smiling roll of eyes from Castiel.
He looked at Dean, shy as he extended it to him. “I thought, since we’re cutting down on our sugar, maybe we could just share one. . ?”
“What was that about?” Castiel asked once they exited the Fraser Building. “Huh? Oh, nothin’. Just wishing us luck. For the case,” he added hastily.
They were locked in an embrace that day, all lips and tongues and hands on each other. Dean was a sophomore then and Aaron a junior. They officially met at Lawrence High School’s first football game of the season, but they knew each other’s names before that; Dean Winchester being one of the most gorgeous specimens Kansas had the pride of breeding, and Aaron Bass being an all-around lanky geek who seemed to know everything from bizarre trivia to world history to calculus. Dean had been inexplicably drawn to the boy the moment he first laid eyes on him across the mess hall back in freshman year.
Dean snorted. “People would beg to differ. They talked about something a lot if they liked it, right?”
Dean huffed a little. “There are people who care about you, Cas,” he said, maybe even a little bitterly. “They deserve to know.”
Jack took in Castiel’s disposition and remained standing, reluctant. “You look tired, Cas. Maybe you should get some rest first. I’ll just come back tomorrow.”
A few minutes away from their destination, Dean finally spotted it; he could tell because they’d slowed down and
“Dean,” he whimpered. Another shot to Dean’s groin. He hooked his fingers through the taller boy’s belt loops and pulled him flush against his torso. Then, he put both his palms on Aaron’s buttocks and gave a good squeeze.
“But we’re gonna need your cooperation for the investigation. You went downstairs, and we still don’t have the other footage, so. Don’t go anywhere. We don’t know what might come in handy.”
Castiel watched him jog away, thinking how easy it was to bring out Dean’s inner child. Dean kept baring his soul to Castiel, over and over that he thought maybe he knew who Dean really was by now. It was a bit scary, the depth of Dean, but also thrilling, knowing he’d learned something new about him every day.
The professor’s vigorous typing was halted in the air at the three sharp raps on wood. He glanced at the door above the frame of his laptop before his shoulders slumped with a sigh and he swiveled 180 degrees to face the extensive table he had situated behind his desk almost three weeks ago, where books and papers were now scattered haphazardly on its length.
Dean tugged his wallet out of his pocket and handed April a generous sum, who accepted it with a harrumph, which pleased Castiel immensely. And then he hauled them both away from the booth faster than you could say
At the end of the atrium of the Chamber of Secrets, what appeared like a star glistened in the middle, ethereal and inviting.
Chimes of the shop bell interrupted his ruminations, the door swinging open as he heard the gruff pad of feet enter his store. Castiel could see the movement of the door shutting over the mass of flowers displayed in the middle of the space for convenient viewing, dividing the place, but it shielded the new arrival from sight.
“I just wanna thank you again, Cas,” Dean had spoken, a hand on the nape of his neck as he tried to maintain eye contact with his friend under the dim hallway light. “Means a lot to me. More than you letting me stay in your home—it means a lot that you trust me.”
Then Dean moved to the final office—Dr. Michaela Shurley, the chancellor’s begotten daughter, and the head of the History Department.
The park filled with the sounds of fireworks going off as Dean rose to his knees and opened the flap of the picnic basket once again, withdrawing two modest sparklers.
“Castiel,” Dean barked again, reaching the man and catching him by his arm. “We gotta get outta here!”
Dean declined with his hand. “I don’t drink on the job, professor.” But she was already pouring the wine to Dean’s then her glass.
When Dean had introduced himself, he caught Det. Henriksen’s narrowed gaze though he tried to mask it. He was more than reluctant to share anything with Dean, but the rule-conscious side of him (and Nancy’s overzealous insistence on helping Dean) won and ceded a folder of multiple reports regarding an earthquake during the night of the theft. Those who relayed such statements firmly believed it had something to do with the Silver Fragment.
“Gabriel happened,” he sighed at the memory. “He thought it funny to give me a fake burger. The patty was artificially made of rubber and when I attempted to eat it, it spurted water down my throat.” Dean choked on his soda and began hacking. Castiel looked at him in reproach. “It was a very traumatic experience.”
Castiel sighed, twisting the cap of his bottled water. “I don’t think I’m ever going to get it ready in time for the conference.” He brought it to his lips and took a sip, Dean’s mouth suddenly going dry at the bead of water escaping the corner of Castiel’s mouth and falling to his jaw, by the perpetual five-o’clock shadow (and it wasn’t even noon yet), then running defiantly against his throat and disappearing inside his collar.
If only Castiel had that in his agenda. To him, love was a sickness, a wolf in sheep’s clothing that had everyone wrapped in its ugly finger, desperate for love and to be loved. Everyone’s goal was to find their one true mate in soul, and achieve Soulshift: the giving of one’s soul wholly to their lover, and the reciprocation of the other, resulting in an exchange that will allow those two people to assume a permanently normal life span and live out their days with their better half.
A lot of people give him hell for it, for never experiencing heaven’s paramount gift, making him the only person to walk the earth whose soul was untouched—taintless and pristine. Still brand new and ready for the taking.
At the thought of Dean, Castiel caught a whiff of what smelled like bacon wafting in the air, sniffing at it until he sat up on his bed. He blinked the sleep out of his eyes and threw the comforter away to let his legs hang by the edge.
He probably didn’t articulate that right. Sighing, he let his eyelids droop to a close. “You looked like you needed some calming. Not that it helped. I probably didn’t do jack.”
, Castiel mouthed back, standing to take a closer view of the pictures. Dean rolled his eyes at the man and faced Jenny towards him.
Castiel rolled his eyes despite not looking up. “It’s usually the instructor that grades the student, not the other way around. Not that I expected you to know that. When were you last in a classroom?”
An eldest man with thick black hair and greying strands, sitting on a wooden chair in the middle, looked authoritative and cogent, but had an air of wisdom and weariness in him in his black, immaculate suit. A woman with ethereal blonde hair by the floor in a bright red evening gown, legs bent and an arm on the eldest man’s lap, with a soft smile and crow’s feet by her eyes. A young man with light brown hair standing by the eldest man’s right, leaning his elbow on the chair in a deep blue suit, his neutral smile only belied by the mischievous glint in his eyes. Another young man with blonde hair and a serious expression, accentuated by his white, crisp suit, standing beside the brown-haired man. And lastly, a young woman with dark hair on the eldest man’s left, wearing a flowing forest green gown and a similar expression to the man in white, the difference being her gaze not looking like she wanted you to burn where you stood.
And then just before Dean could say anything else, Dr. Shurley stood from his chair and buttoned his suit jacket, smoothing his deep red tie. He walked beside the desk to Dean, his gait slow due to his age. He looked like he was in his seventies but Dean wouldn’t be surprised if he was an octogenarian.
“No,” he whispered, a hand coming up to his mouth, an endless amount of salty wetness pouring through him like an unattended faucet. “Mom!” he cried in anguish, this time finally coming to her side and ripping the cloth off. Her mother’s pallid face lied still, eyelids closed.
“Do you know what this means? This. . . This changes everything! Everything we know about souls. A person can decouple his soul only so many times—five times in a lifetime, on average. And you’re telling me—that all of our research and findings have been inaccurate.”
Oh, yeah. Music was definitely playing. But a voice that didn’t come from the speakers blended with it.
“Why do the clouds get to have all the fun?” shouted Dean over the din of the fireworks, and Castiel shook his head fondly at him. Dean lit the Castiel’s sparkler with a gaslight, then his, and it quickly blazed with gleaming scintillas.
Shaking his head and trying to let go of those thoughts for now, he went to look for the cotton candy stall. When he spotted it near the bumper car arena (
“Let me help you, honey. I’ll get the glasses.” Gabriel rose from his seat, heading for the kitchen, but Rowena blocked the open doorway, forbidding him from entering.
After a heavy few seconds, Jenny babbled excitedly and reached her arms to Castiel, and he felt as though he could breathe again. Even Dean seemed relieved. And Garth was grinning.
Balthazar shook his head, but stopping in the middle of it at a realization, grimacing. “So this is why I keep waking up like I’ve run a marathon in my sleep?”
Dean took sight of the wide-eyed man and hummed nonchalantly, ambling across the office and opening the manila.
Dean had circled his motel room more than three times already, trying to find all of the reports and research regarding the Silver Fragment. He knew he was a tad disorganized, but he and Castiel had pulled an all-nighter and when he got back to the motel, he just let himself be pulled by gravity, forgetting that he had dossiers in his hands.
Dean turned with reticence. “Um, Gabriel has my card. You can get it from him.” With that, he descended the stairs and regretted leaving the wine untouched.
Blushing at the thought of Castiel talking about him and being regarded as such, Dean gave a nervous chuckle. “Am I that good of a regular, Cas?”
He exhaled sharply, catching the door before it fully shut and trailed after the man whose steps became hasty as he made it to the far end of the room. The doors snapped closed again as Dean flicked the light switches on, immersing the space in a soft illumination.
In the propitious summer of 1946, Dean situated a small town in Louisiana where he met Benny at the local diner. Dean frequented Guidry's Cajun Café, and he became fast friends with the Elizabeth, the manager, and Benny, the cook and Elizabeth’s older brother.
be unprofessional, but the chancellor was regaling him with brief descriptions of each item, and of course the pièce de résistance had to be at the end, the final and unparalleled showpiece, just in front of a large and superlative portrait of a cap-donning rugged young man with a Balbo beard, the Chamber of History’s most prized jewel. . .
Castiel never forgot because the recondite man returned the day after the next. Though implicitly, Castiel knew that if he hadn’t come back, he would still remember those electric moss eyes nonetheless.
So Dean and Castiel ended up on the long, white couch together, a tad too close yet a little too apart (as outside observers would assert). It was funny, actually. The more the movie progressed, the less the space between them had become, and Dean found himself exactly where he wanted to be tonight.
“I mean Dr. Milton. I keep forgetting,” he shook his head with a small smile. “Are you assisting our dear agent in the case?”
Castiel sighed. There can be no winning with this man, and frankly, Castiel didn’t have enough carbohydrates to argue.
It was the only time he ever engaged in such sentimentality and he would do it again in a heartbeat. For the inexplicably non-overweight man with the appetite of an elephant horde.
They became regulars soon enough that Ellen and Jo, her daughter, probably knew as much as they did about the development of the Silver Fragment case.
Dean didn’t know the extent of the Chuck’s role in Castiel’ life. Knowing what he did for him, it augmented the sense of respect he had for the chancellor.
Dr. Shurley sighed. “That soul piece has exceedingly pertinent value for all of the citizens of Kansas. I’m sure you’re well-read on its history?”
Castiel and Jack were immediately drawn to the smell of pot pie, wafting from the large dish, straight to their nostrils. They didn’t even notice Rowena disappearing and reappearing again, this time with a bowl of variegated roasted vegetables.
“Let me get this straight. Both of you were here in this building the night of the theft?” Dean clarified. They nodded slowly.
“No,” he sobbed, taking her cooling hands into his, “I’m here now, mom. Please, please don’t leave me.”
Gabriel peeked inside and saw Dean. “Oh. Dean. Fancy seeing you here. Again.” He smirked and Mike glowered.
Jack bobbed his head in zest. “That’s so cool! You’ll find ‘em, Cas,” he assured, and Castiel hoped so, for the sake of his sanity.
“Well, I wouldn’t say they’re unaware anymore,” Dean commented thoughtfully, and Gabriel grew ecstatic. “Finally!”
Dean felt a little lightheaded and queasy from the effort of giving away a part of himself, adjusting to the shift in his core. But it didn’t matter; Lisa’s grateful, wistful smile was enough compensation.
That was a pleasant memory, Castiel thought, before snapping his head out of Dean-thoughts, and hastily grabbing his stuff and bolting out of KU in his Continental to the Kline-Shurley household to pick Jack up.
He turned to Castiel, giving a charming smile and trying to get his voice to lower, “Hey, it’s Dean Smith.”
The months that followed were some of the busiest of Castiel’s life. But they were also the most driven. It was no easy task to open a flower shop, nor any kind of business for that matter, but he was adamant about his choice, so he studied extensively, both through the internet and the city library, about the floral industry (he knew he liked bees for a reason), got into contact with suppliers, and visited the farms to verify their quality. Gabriel had been extremely supportive during the process, and three months later, Eden’s Garden had been birthed.
“Did she, now?” Castiel took the outstretched box from Dean with a grateful duck of his head. “Maybe her missing me could mean free extra fries next time.”
Castiel paused at the side of the projector screen. “Is that the purpose of emotion? To make life worth living? Or does it only cancel the Apollonian out? Inhibit our full intellectual potential?”
Before Castiel knew what was going on, he was pulled to his feet by Dean who grabbed his wrist. Dean hoped the blood rushing to his face wasn’t noticeable, because he was holding Castiel’s hand as he gave him a sparkler.
Castiel felt a rush of empathy toward him, to his hurt, and then one of gratitude, the mistrust seeping out of his skin even though he wasn’t entirely sure why. His eyes stared straight at the scarcely lit hall.
The bungalow looked the same as when Dean first saw it—minimalist and clean. The vestibule led to a spacious living room, where an L-shaped sofa of considerable length was centered; an 88-inch TV mounted on the wall opposite it. The room ended with glass for a wall that usually gave a luscious, though currently dark, view of the greenery behind the house.
They glimpsed at each other again, and Dean was bothered. “Is there something I’m missing here? A lover’s quarrel, maybe—?”
She started when Dean rapped on the wood twice, flustered and her black-rimmed glasses askew. Dean peaked behind the counter and saw that she had been typing away before being spurred into reality.
“I have to ask, Dr. Shurley, does this soul piece have any sentimental value to you?” Dean queried. The chancellor stopped for a second, but continued as though he hadn’t paused.
He paused, and Dean remained silent as an urge for him to continue. Castiel shook his head at his reverie. “Chuck found me wandering by the campus in a trance. I hadn’t eaten for two days, so he brought me to a nearby café and treated me to two whole meals. I still don’t know what he saw in me, but he helped me put my life back together. He gave me accommodations at a small motel, made sure I adequately ate. Then he introduced me to the world of philosophy, and I fell in love with it just as he. When I told him I wanted to pursue it as a major, he took care of everything from my transfer credentials from Ohio State, to my financial aid, to my dormitory.”
“Fuck!” he growled, clutching his scalp in agony—his head surprisingly still intact—as he bent over. He suddenly caught the need to hold onto something sturdy and stable, and his eardrums were overwhelmed by a sharp ringing.
When they reached the middle of the fair where mostly the food stalls were situated, Dean halted, blood still pumping. “Dang, I thought for a second there I was gonna lose.”
There was a beat of silence at first as Castiel maneuvered the car to a right turn, before it snapped and Dean spluttered with laughter and Castiel cracked up along with him. It became uncontrollable, and Castiel willed himself to settle down from the simple hilarity.
He nodded in acknowledgment, and Castiel’s stomach dropped unpleasantly. He didn’t know he was still capable of feeling rejection.
Dean rounded the table and slapped the folder down, then sat on Castiel’s cushioned seat, slouching and linking his fingers on his abdomen.
They reached the line of carnival games, and Dean was filled with elated energy, wanting to try every single one.
Dean probably discovered every nook and cranny of the house by now, so when his friend asked him not to let the house burn while he was away in Europe, Dean could only smirk.
Dean pondered, especially that the door had no signs of forced entry. “Still, being in the same building, they could have heard or seen something. What departments are in here?” asked Dean as they entered the infrastructure, heading to the stairs as there was no elevator in sight.
He tightened his grip on Castiel. “It’s Dean. C’mon, we gotta go,” he yelled, but the man wasn’t fazed, a tear cascading down his cheek, eyes wide, blue, and grief-stricken. “I’m sorry, mom.”
“Smith, right. I knew that,” Gabriel said emphatically, “I have reason to believe that the stolen footage can be recovered.”
Castiel’s mortified face had them all laughing as Castiel and Jack parted from the couple and approached his car.
A few moments later, a lanky brown-haired man emerged pushing a convertible highchair from what Dean assumed was the kitchen, to the living room where they were.
“Balthazar has been telling me about his sleeping problems for a while now. I thought it was an issue with nonrestorative sleep, but seeing this, it might be actually somnambulism.”
When Dean and Dr. Shurley had been outside the Chamber of History, it had looked like any other room with probably. . . shelves? Pedestals? Dean didn’t know, he wasn’t a goddamn academic.
The LPD has assured me that they are doing everything in their power to bring the perpetrator to justice, and to bring Bobby Singer’s soul piece back home at KU. People of Lawrence, there is no need to worry.
When Castiel took the outstretched squirrel, they were on their way to the next one: the classic water gun game. Castiel stood a chance against Dean this time, but with the plush squashed in his armpit because there was no place to put it down, control was difficult. So Dean won again, this time bagging a stuffed penguin. In his peripheral view, he saw a small boy who couldn’t be older than 6 years old, eyes following the plush. Without further second-thought, he offered the penguin to the kid, who stared at the toy and then at Dean with hazel doe eyes. Dean gave him an encouraging smile, and the child took it with a toothy grin.
Castiel egressed, and Dean was following suit when the chancellor caught his arm, not for the first time.
“No one,” he gasped, a bucket of cold water pouring through him like a wakening alarm, everything speeding up into a normal pace. Suddenly he could see his surroundings, palpably feel the trembling earth, and the hurt was bearable as his feet began groping the pavement trying to find the entrance of Singer Hall.
He let the grin emerge by half, speaking through his lashes. “You don’t know how much that means to me, Dean.”
Castiel’s body was still coiled, and he was still shuddering, as Dean ran his hand up and down his back in what he hoped was a palliative manner, then leaned forward.
Castiel gulped, hearing his quickening heartbeat in his ears as the man lifted a hand and gestured with a pointer finger right at Castiel.
Castiel rolled his eyes. “I’m not sure if you noticed, Winchester, but I am an academic. A professor and a researcher. I lose myself when I get engrossed in my work and studies and I miss the passage of time.”
He moved away from the body-length mirror propped on the floor and leaning against his bedroom wall, nervously (and absurdly, at that) fumbling with the buttons of his polo, unsure if he could deal with Gabriel’s incessant and rather lewd remarks at the moment.
Seated, though, putting the gear into drive, Jack asked him quietly if he could spend the night at Castiel’s.
“Aha!” Dean yelped when he found a research paper about six pages lodged between his bed and the nightstand.
“I like to think I’m a prolific writer because of my father. He was also an author, you see, and a strong believer of the occult. When he died due to an unfortunate vehicular accident, a novel of his was published posthumously. ‘Extramundus’ was the title.” Castiel half-expected Dean to bob his head in a way that would give away his dispassion, but he seemed genuinely interested in Castiel’s tales.
Dean marveled at the gargantuan office with grey walls accented with gold throughout. It made the space look exquisite, which could only indicate accolade, seniority, and preeminence. The left side of the room was covered with a bookshelf that encompassed the entire west wall.
Castiel wasn’t listening. He slowly untangled his finger from Dean and teetered to the entrance, pushing the right door agape.
They talked more, about the scenic sunset and then the bees when they spotted one on a nearby flower. Castiel was smug that he’d instilled that zeal in Jack. After a while when the sun had gone, they got up and walked back to the ice cream shop where Castiel’s car was parked, and he dropped off Jack at Lucifer’s house.
“Have you ever even thought back about the people you’ve hurt? How much pain you caused them? I’ve read the stories. You come in a town, set your eyes on a potential victim, and leave once they’ve fallen into your trap. Do you even realize how
When he reached the chancellor, he flashed him his badge, but he didn’t give it a look. He was focused on the young man’s face—which of course, only looked young, because Dean sure as hell wasn’t young—ostensibly studying his appearance.
It was only when he found two news clippings crumpled beneath the door that he deemed he found everything.
Castiel was ambling up the stairs to his office with more impetus than usual. He couldn’t stop himself from shaking his head in disappointment at the escalation of events. And he couldn’t believe that he almost,
It still hurt him to talk about it, but taking a deep breath, he barreled on. “After her death. . . I was lost. She was the most important person in my life. I left and found myself in a bus headed to Kansas. I. . . I’ve always felt drawn here.”
Baby was revving through the asphalt road, Dean impatiently tapping on the steering wheel. He shook his head, replaying the video footage over his head trying to make sense of it. Still, he couldn’t.
“Oh, you mean those two lovesick idiots beside me? Yeah, they’ve been too chickenshit to man up to their feelings for three years now,” Gabriel sighed exaggeratedly.
“Good morning, Dean.” He took his seat on one of the kitchen stools by the counter, and he missed Dean’s smug smile before he continued fixing up breakfast.
Dean returned the badge in his black suit jacket, and before he could reply, the doctor continued, “If this is about the soul piece, I’m afraid you’re going to be disappointed. That thing is long gone.”
“Unfortunately, no. The thief was good in clearing evidence. But rest assured that he’ll be brought to justice,” said Dean firmly, opening his folder and clicking his pen.
, not deleted. That means the thief has a copy, and not just a personal one, but one that can be hacked.”
It was a relatively fruitless interview. Dr. Trenton had been a faithful faculty member for half his life, gaining his post-graduate education at the same university. No priors and no link.
The third time Dean rendered a piece of his soul was indelible in his memory, because someone had given a piece of their soul to him in echo.
The man spun around, a palm held up in question, completely missing their now first-name basis. Apparently, life-threatening events made you use someone’s given name. Castiel worried his bottom lip as he drew the phone away from his face and looked at Dean.
Shit, shit, shit. This was bad. Because Dean wanted it to be a date, and if this wasn’t. . . well, fuck.
“I’m not a kid anymore,” Jack said emphatically, if not for the edgy expression Castiel kept giving him.
Jack lapped on the dripping liquid at the side of his cone. “I did, yes. Thank you, Cas,” he grinned boyishly at him, and Castiel can’t help but feel warmed. “You know, for everything.”
Dean took an enormous bite out of his burger, earning a disbelieving look from Castiel. “How do you even fit that in your mouth?”
They fell into a tense silence after Castiel’s pronounced disgust, and the air between them reverberated with a severe energy.
And by God’s timing, the phone rang shrilly at the same time the door pounded. “Mike! Dad’s calling for a family meeting!”
“Dean.” Castiel sounded gleeful as he showed Dean a large bag of colorful cotton candy that was snug in his other arm.
Castiel gave Jack a final reassuring squeeze, then went to turn his key, the engine sputtering to life. He pressed on the gas, peeling away to the Shurley-MacLeod’s.
When the professor opened the door to Dean’s knock, her face shifted from one of surprise to one of a darker flavor enough to make Dean gulp.
“Well, those guys you can find on the third floor. But you’re going to the fifth floor if you wanna see my father first. He can help you with anything you need with the investigation,” replied Gabriel as they went through the glass doors of the edifice and traipsed across the hall past the lobby and front desk. The short man gave a wink to the attendant’s direction, making her giggle.
He grabbed his phone from the sheets, turning off the speaker and placing it by his ear just as he plopped on the edge of his bed. “Maybe it is a date, Gabe. A friendly one.”
When they had first seen it, the plants were sullen and slouching, but now they were upright and vivid. Dean couldn’t help but wonder if Castiel was a nature whispered, because quite literally, when Castiel crouched down to the brick edging, he began whispering encouraging words like “you look exceptionally beatific today” and “the bees must be enjoying watching you prosper” and “stay happy, little ones.”
And then, all too soon, the four of them were stuffed to the brim after dessert with Rowena’s cherry pie. If Castiel had asked her if he could bring home a slice or two, then that was possibly Dean’s business.
But the more he scrambled to get it out, the more the picture subsisted. Then it wasn’t just them sitting together at the dinner table; it became shattering chinas and shouting and screaming at each other with young Dean and young Sammy on the verge of tears.
After a compromise with his landlord, a resignation letter for his manager, Nora, and a last-minute plane ticket to NY, he was back in his hometown and in the company of his rambunctious sibling.
Castiel met him there after he finished with the dishes, catching Dean loading up Castiel’s dirty clothes first with his; it was almost strangely intimate.
“I eat fine, Jack. I’ve actually consumed two burgers just this afternoon.” Jack’s brows shot up his hairline. “Did Uncle Gabe tie you down and force it down your throat?”
“We won tickets to Hamilton?!” He was swept with incredulity, and then anticipation at the thought of seeing the musical again.
“You can just call him Castiel. It annoys him more,” he cackled. Dean shook his head and proceeded to change the subject.
Castiel didn’t reply, and Dean gave one short, callous laugh. “I swore to myself I would never be weak again. I left! I left and I began collecting souls to fill this—this bottomless pit.”
Dean slid a plate in front of him filled with pancakes, eggs and bacon, and would you look at that: hash browns.
Castiel laughed quietly along with him, and Dean couldn’t help but notice how much easier it was to tolerate the professor if he smiled more often.
The man had the nerve to look disappointed, as though expecting something more fit than what Castiel had said.
Then as if his bout of emotionality never happened, hope flashed in his chest. The beige monstrosity came into view, taking its place on the driveway.
“He was a good man, Benny, if not the best. He always helped me out whenever I needed it, and he accepted me for who I was. He was there for me ‘til the end.”
Gabriel considered him. “Now things like those need people to work it out. And people are working it out.”
“About the Cold War,” Jack replied. “More on political thought but you know I always like to add in a perspective or two.” He grinned, and Castiel chortled.
But he couldn’t. He never knew where his mother derived her courage, but Castiel was adamant he hadn’t inherited it.
archangel), and Kelly Kline. It’s a funny story how they met. It actually had been at Gabriel and Rowena’s wedding. Kelly was an old classmate of Rowena, and they had a lasting friendship after college. When Lucifer, all moody and imperious because his youngest brother was getting married before him, spotted Kelly alone at a table, he did his best to charm her ass off. And it worked. They hit it off, and two weeks after, it was them that were pregnant and not the newlyweds.
“Just because we don’t grow old doesn’t mean we can’t die, smart guy!” Dean had exasperatedly said, to which Castiel dryly replied, “People who haven’t Soulshifted die every day, Winchester. I’m not a simpleton.”
“Thank you, mister,” he piped, the adorable little thing, engulfing the penguin in a hug. “You’re welcome, kid.” The boy ran off to a man, showing him the plush frivolously.
“Exactly!” Castiel exclaimed, missing the sarcasm. Dean chuckled dryly. “Yeah, tell that to the jury.” He got up from Castiel’s chair and buttoned his jacket, leaving the desk and started for the exit. Castiel was swept with panic.
Dean took the last of his fries. “Hey, you don’t owe anyone who you are. People sometimes play a part in your life, but who you become—that one’s all you.” Castiel’s head tilted at Dean’s words, and this time Dean found it endearing. “What?”
Castiel sighed. He could recall a time when trivial things such as not-dates didn’t bother him. What was it about Dean that got him going bonkers?
“Didn’t bother waiting for us, Gabe?” Castiel clapped him on the shoulder, and he stood to shoot him a wink and ruffled Jack’s hair affectionately. “If it makes you feel better, I already ate half of Rowena’s cooking.”
Dean waved back, feeling his face heat up when he realized that Castiel was pointing to the fastened lock of the door before scrambling to release the lock quite pathetically.
Castiel rolled his eyes at that, but took Jack’s words to heart. He was right. He was no longer a child, Castiel reminded himself.
“Step right up! Play the High Striker! You get three strikes, and if you ring the bell like a man, you get the jackpot prize! The strikes, ring the bell and you get a prize!”
“I can’t believe you.” Dean met the man’s blue eyes, also glassy, and laggingly, the once-bright, ocean eyes that had constantly gazed at Dean with such fierce fondness, was now draining of color, and he saw it for what it was.
His friend placed his palm on top of Dean’s hand that was wavering on his lap, and squeezed consolingly.
“All relevant questions that Dr. Roché needs to answer. Now let’s get outta here. We don’t know how much damage that earthquake did.” He turned in his place and headed to egress, Castiel following reluctantly with the phone still in his hand.
Instead of heeding his mother’s words, he tore through the exit, the hurt dripping down his chin as his chest ruptured in the corner of the hallway and he huddled himself.
, of Dean’s attention rounded on the shorter man. He was still glimpsing above Gabriel’s head to look at the overcoat-wearing man.
“Please come here, honey,” her mother rasped, and Castiel fiercely shook his head. It was what she had said. That was what she always said, in Castiel’s dreams, in vacant headspaces, in the back of his mind.
Dr. Carroll and Dr. Trenton glanced at each other simultaneously. And then simultaneously looked away.
Castiel tilted his head curiously, and Dean didn’t know if he found it endearing or annoying. He went with annoying. “You haven’t heard about the earthquakes?”
And if Dean wasn’t too busy wrapping his head around the doctor’s age, he could have appreciated the way Castiel’s eyes gentled at the mention of Dr. Shurley.
Castiel couldn’t help but stare at his hips (read: ass), swaying side to side along the perky tune and sizzle of cooking bacon.
Castiel was tidying up his desks (well, not so much as tidying as stacking similar papers on top of each other) after spending the day cooped inside his office trying to get his speech done.
“Honey, the FBI are here!” Bess called to the house. Castiel tried his best not to turn his nose up at the endearment. Surely a bee’s produce deserved more accolade.
Castiel was still working on his cupcake experimentally, eyes widening when he took his first bite. “I keep forgetting how good of a baker Rowena is.”
Just as he asked, the dark mess of hair emerged from the storage room, face immediately lighting up. “Dean! You’re early.”
“Figures he’d be there for a relic but not his children,” he added, murmuring it more to himself than anything, bitterness crossing his features. But he straightened almost immediately when he remembered that he was accompanying a relative stranger.
Dean could remember a time when he only held friendly feelings toward the man, but more than that, he could remember the moment they timorously stepped across a threshold they didn’t know existed.
Dean remained fixed on the concrete, waiting, as Castiel exited the driver’s seat, and Jack from the passenger’s.
“Good afternoon, professor,” a female student greeted as she passed them. Castiel smiled and nodded to her. Dean let his gaze linger for a second longer at the young blonde before they reached the ground floor. “She’s cute. You’re quite famous with your students, aren’t you?”
“Well, Mr. Fitzgerald, I’m sure you know that you’re the last remaining relative of Robert Singer. Aside from sweet cheeks over there.” Dean shot a finger gun at the baby and she cooed gleefully, clapping her hands together.
“That was kind of you, Dean,” he heard a voice rasp into his ear, and he shifted to the side to look at his friend. Castiel was wide-eyed in reverence. “The boy looked happy.”
Dean nodded reluctantly, not wholly convinced. “Fine. Here, take my card. I’ll see what I can do with that information about the footage.” He handed Gabriel his card he pulled from his suit pocket. “And as I’ve told your father, I will have to talk to everyone who has or had access to this building the night of the incident, so why don’t you introduce me to your colleagues—” Dean gestured to the middle of the hall where the three men stood, but when he looked, there were only two left.
Garth looked at Dean and the baby back and forth, Jenny’s mouth still curved down in a cry. His face strained, he lifted Jenny up to Dean’s arms, and Dean took her in a measured dip. Jenny’s eyes peeked open at the shift and her caterwauling slowly diminished. “There ya go. You’re a cute wittle girl, aren’t you?”
“Oh,” she said in recognition. “Of course, please come in.” She held the door open and let the two men enter.
He smiled nervously at him, his heart beating erratically against its cage. “That’s me. Proud owner of Eden’s Garden.” Then grimacing, he appended, “But I already told you that.”
“I didn’t know you were coming over, Dean,” Castiel said, and if Dean didn’t know any better, he seemed to flit with new nervosity, his eyes flicking between Jack and him.
Dean positioned himself closer to Castiel. “Come here,” he ordered, and it was the first time he saw Castiel look mortified. “This is a bad idea.”
“A remnant of the soul piece,” Dr. Shurley amended, “Just a sliver, to remind us what it means to give a piece of your soul and to accept one.”
Castiel searched for Dean’s elusive gaze, trying to convey his sincere nonjudgmental stance. “I think you do, Dean.”
“Oh,” he intoned, suddenly feeling really, really stupid. “I didn’t know you had plans.” Dean gestured sheepishly to the box. “Well, um, good night, then. I got this large pizza to demolish.”
But he knew the man. Gabriel wouldn’t give up that easily, so begrudgingly, he pressed the green button and put the call on speaker.
“Well, yeah.” He bit his lower lip. “They’re your favorite. I actually. . . I was having second thoughts on getting them because what if you’re offended that I bought flowers at another shop? Took me three shops to find purple ones, and I think I paced for like, 30 minutes. But yeah, I wanted to get them for you, I just hope you—”
Dean stretched a little on his seat and tilted his head. “Holy shit, I still can’t believe you’re a century old. Didn’t think you were older than me. I didn’t think anyone was older than me ‘til I found out about Dr. Shurley.”
The sun was shining quite literally on Castiel when he sauntered into wakefulness in an unparticular Wednesday morning. Rays of light bled through the Venetians of the window perpendicular to his bed, and he thought dazedly that it wasn’t as vexing as usual.
“No, no, no, no.” Dean waved his hands in an undoing motion, and Castiel’s eyes shot back up at him. “I meant I don’t like anyone else. I like, well. . . you.”
When the auditorium was left empty apart from Castiel, he went to gather his students’ essays and chucked it into his leather briefcase, along with his memory drive.
“Well, the internet was very helpful, but I couldn’t have done it without. . .” He tapped his right temple twice with his forefinger, eyes boring into Dean.
“Ain’t that a fine rear, right there,” teased Dean, both hands slithering in each of Aaron’s back pockets. He had felt his cheeks heat up in response, and the taller boy mirrored him, fingers leaving their former position to also cup Dean’s ass cheeks via trouser pockets. Aaron felt something crumple against his right hand.
They hadn’t wiped each other clean off the face of the earth after that but if looks could kill. . . Well, they might as well have.
“Okay,” Dean responded tepidly. “Maybe you can help me Gabriel. Point me to where I can find your father. And while you’re at it, you can tell me why you think the Silver Fragment is ‘long gone.’”
“Dean!” bellowed Benny with his hoarse voice. “No, Dean,” he croaked, a tear slipping from his eye, before shutting them tightly with what little strength he could muster, willing the world to change.
Castiel gave him a deadpan expression before grabbing the leather strap of his case and aiming towards the exit. Dean followed his trail.
“That is an incredibly hurtful thing to say to your friend, Dean. I didn’t know you thought so low of me, because it’s absolutely true. I only invited you to stay so someone can look after my home free of charge.”
Castiel laughed; that beautiful, electric laugh of his that never failed to punch the air out of Dean. Though he was too busy analyzing what the laugh meant to fully appreciate it.
Taking the phone in his hand and automatically snorting at Gabriel’s candid contact photo, he contemplated if he should just let it direct to voicemail.
Gabriel huffed and sat on one of the two chairs in front of Castiel’s desk. “You’re just jealous that no one bakes you cupcakes, Cassie.”
“Your prize. Congratulations.” The operator handed Dean a small envelope, though he didn’t look too pleased. He accepted it, then gave him a two-finger salute and skittishly pulled Castiel away from the High Striker.
“So. . . You’ve never, um, like been with anyone before? In your century of existence?” he pried, the thought still seeming ridiculous in his mind. How can anyone, in a soul-oriented world, not have given a piece of his soul and accepted one in turn? Maybe he was aromantic.
“Now, leave, Dean. I expect you’ll be gone by morning.” He stood up and snatched his coat from the chair, leaving a twenty dollar bill on the counter before heading for the exit. Dean checked to see if the couple had heard their conversation, but saw that they were still preoccupied with their own.
They arrived at the Fitzgerald home after two hours. Castiel didn’t prod further about their travel time.
“Heh. Thanks, I guess. How much is it?” He pulled his wallet out of his back pocket, picking out a five-dollar bill when Castiel said, “$3.50.”
Castiel didn’t stop the relieved sigh from leaving him. He placed a comforting grip on Jack’s shoulder, and he sagged into it immediately.
“No, sorry, agent.” He shook his head. “I think, though, I still have some old pictures. How about that?”
“Don’t,” breathed Dean against his Adam’s apple, “I want to hear you.” The older boy must had been feeling extra obedient that day, because as soon as the words left the younger boy’s mouth, it was as though a muffler was removed and Aaron was making beautiful noises invoked by Dean.
“Who’s that man on the right?” Castiel was the one to ask, Dean pointing the man for him. “Oh, that’s Rufus Turner. Another best friend of Uncle Bobby. Not sure what happened to him, though.”
Could it be? Could this. . ? He mentioned it to Dean just this morning. What if it was just a pitiful coincidence?
The simple circumstance had rendered him stunned. Transfixed, his feet led him to egress, crouching down at the sidewalk to study the mystery of the lone daisy.
“Alright, fine. But you didn’t seem all that interested when I first asked. You even believed it was ‘long gone’—your words. What changed?” Dean glanced over Gabriel’s brown hair again, but the blue-eyed man had his back to Dean, engrossed in a conversation with the blonde man and the chancellor. He looked back at the short man disappointedly.
Aaron had done what he was told, and his eyes widened when he saw what the younger boy had in his pocket. Two tickets to the Big Six Conference at the Memorial Stadium.
Castiel bounced awkwardly on the balls of his feet. “The earthquakes; I don’t know why, but when they occur, I experience flashbacks of my worst memory. My mother’s death.”
Castiel exhaled defeatedly. “Your method isn’t going to accomplish anything because it’s not a standard knob. It’s a deadbolt latch.”
He exhaled harshly, bringing his forefinger to the backspace key and slamming on it repeatedly with more force than warranted until the last sentence had disappeared.
He faced him, taking another piece of candy just as Dean reach his hand to the bag, and they grazed hands, turning Castiel coy.
Bess went to help settle the chair immobile as Garth approached the men jovially, his previous anxious state shifting. “So, um, FBI, huh? What can I do for you?” He gestured for them to sit down on the sofa.
Dean and Castiel woke up to the sound of successive camera shutters. Dean stirred first, finding a weight on his crown, before registering the sight of Gabriel and Chancellor Shurley standing in front of them—the chancellor holding a phone up his hands and pressing his doddery finger on the screen, and Gabriel with his mouth hanging open, gawping in stupefaction at the sight.
Dean turned towards the window, scrutinizing the view where a gargantuan magnolia strewn with white centered the buildings in the campus. “Both.”
Dean also found Castiel’s research papers in the university, dating back to the 1960s, and ranging from the study of souls to the philosophical viewpoint of near-death experiences. He had been teaching in that school for almost 60 years. He was an accomplished, tenured Philosophy professor. No wonder he had credentials that could match the chancellor’s. He could be the
“The doctor—Gabriel,” he added, in case more than one of his children had Ph.D.’s. True enough, Dr. Shurley chuckled. “All of my progeny are doctors, Agent Smith.”
Dean sighed as he left the professor’s office, reminding himself to verify his alibi. The more he heard other people’s defenses, the more Castiel seemed to be a person of interest due to the contrast of his history and background. But Dean was in cahoots with the acidic professor now. And he (well, most of him) believed his story.
He clenched his fists at his sides willfully, and stormed to them. When he reached the booth, he took Castiel’s elbow where the squirrel was nestled. “Cas,” he said, clipped, though the hostility was directed at the ginger.
He took the stem from Castiel’s faltering grip. A good move, because if not for it, Castiel would’ve dropped the sunflower. It was definitely not warmth, what he was feeling right now. He could almost feel Charlie’s eyes burning on the back of his neck.
And everybody seemed to be okay with it. It didn’t look like Castiel was being run out of town for being around 80 years old and still looking as though he was in his prime 30s.
It was the ultimate deviance from the society which upholds a strict dichotomy; black or white, sleep or wake, Heaven or Hell, give love or take love.
So Dean had given the security his card, in case they had something to tell him, and acquired his own copy of the feed of that night. You never know what you might find.
The chamber was a long hall with divided clearances both left and right. It was adorned with wooden arches and the walls and columns were painted a dull aquamarine. The matted linoleum floor was a navy blue in the main hallway and progressed to more intricate patterns and colors within the recesses. All in all, it looked like a mini museum.
Menace started to build within Dean. He glared at the dark-haired man. “This is my hometown. You can’t run me out of here.”
The chancellor looked contemplative as he continued, “It has always been believed that nature had been angry because people were wasting souls, and as a result, wasted away. People in that era were on the brink of mass hedonism. Taking souls, unable to give in return. It was the ultimate transgression.”
The lanky boy must had registered the shiver because Dean could feel a smirk in the kiss as he explored the short expanse of Aaron’s hair. The older boy bit back a moan when Dean’s hot breath moved down to his neck, planting wet kisses all over.
Castiel mirrored it. “Don’t worry, Dean. I have faith.” He stood to his two feet, ducking his head, suddenly shy.
“Well, better prepare for my next class. Good luck again, agent. For the case and for Cassie.” He gave another mirthful grin before heading to his office and shutting it close, not giving enough time for Dean to protest.
He walked towards the doctor, intending to apologize again and maybe glean some information about the reason he was here.
he thought, but he tempered the rush, meeting Castiel’s eyes and almost missing the way they flicked up from where Castiel was also staring at his lips.
Castiel was seething. And maybe just a little bit unnerved. He had been pacing in his office all morning, asking himself if intimidating the immortal had been the correct choice.
Rolling his eyes, he took the ketchup bottle and squeezed some onto his plate. “Ketchup is most definitely not a vegetable.”
Dean got up from his seat, telling Castiel that he needed to get something from the Impala. When he returned five minutes later, a sizeable lamp was lit, hanging from one of his hands, the amber illumination swathing their space.
Dean sighed. “I guess it can’t get any worse than this.” And like clockwork, the lights went out, swathing Castiel and Dean in darkness.
So instead of heading to the entrance doors, he very surreptitiously sidled at the left facet of the construction, peeking by the third floor to check if the lights in the first room were on.
Dean got up for the refrigerator and brought back a bottle which he flippantly offered Castiel. “Here. Ketchup’s a vegetable.”
“You have balls harder than steel, Winchester,” Castiel snarled, moving away from where Dean was advancing.
They sat in silence for a while, unable to maintain an appropriate subject. And also, Castiel was still ashamed as hell. But he couldn’t deny what the immortal deserved. “I wanted—
Dr. Shurley smiled softly. “It wasn’t—couldn’t have been an easy path, Dean. I’m sure it took people time, maybe decades to right themselves. The important thing was that they tried and then they did.”
he thought. He had been avoiding that particular news story ever since it popped up on the TV screen of the bar where he had been hustling pool just two nights ago.
“I was—” The reason he returned to the university dawned back to him. “Charlie recovered the footage. Your friend’s got a lot of explaining to do.”
He calmed immediately, though he was still smiling as they brought their respective beers to their lips and took a swig.
“They completely missed you behind the door. Called us to report a broken exhibit, glass everywhere. Speaking of—the earthquake. You were in here the whole time?” Gabriel turned apprehensive.
“I have to be honest. It’s not going to be easy, Dean. But I find that, with a little help, anything is possible.” Castiel smiled at his direction, and Dean reciprocated it inwardly. It pained him how easily he could believe it.
Dean groaned, letting his head loll back. “Great. Just great.” Dean began grousing under his breath, tucking the lock picks back into the felt with his one hand holding up his mobile. The situation was more than inopportune, but Castiel felt like he needed to say something.
When Rowena settled the sweet potato mash onto the surface, she took her seat and let Gabriel pop open Castiel’s wine and pour each of them a glass.
“I don’t know how you are so familiar to me—or why it feels less like I am getting to know you and more as though I am remembering who you are. How every smile, every whisper brings me closer to the impossible conclusion that I have known you before, I have loved you before—in another time, a different place—some other existence.” –Lang Leav
“No, I haven’t. I’ve never really expressed romantic interest in other people. Really, I find them tedious. At least, I used to. Being an educator and having decades upon decades stacked upon you really alters your perspective.” Castiel started fiddling with his fingers as he talked. “I may be more open than I had been, but I still have not felt any attraction to anyone as of yet.”
Castiel searched his head. He didn’t know of any shortcuts that led Lawrence to Wichita in that time frame.
Dean was caught off guard. “Professor Milton?!” he spluttered, and the shorter man was gleeful at his reaction.
So there they had been, an hour after the final game of the season when people had filed out and were long gone. They had stayed behind, a pull of a hand on a hand, their feet led them to the back of the stands, and lips connecting the moment they were out of anyone’s sight.
Dean’s hand fell away from his back as Castiel shot up straight, whirling around to see the man exhaustedly reposed on the wall, the other hand on the phone giving off the only illumination. Dean’s head quirked at Castiel’s widened eyes. “I don’t know about you, but after that run-in with nature’s fury, I feel like I can sleep for a week.”
The heady stare that the man had given him in the Chamber of History had thrown him off, and he couldn’t risk another look lest he lose his mind in green.
Dean scoffed derisively. “Yeah, he gave up his remaining soul for me, and the first thing I did after the funeral was to drown in hedonism.”
“I have some asters, dahlias, carnations, tulips, you name it.” Looking back at the man, he saw him perusing the flowers with a bite of his lower lip.
They had the sparklers a reasonable distance away from their faces, gazes locked on the resplendent view of colors splitting the sky open, the multitude of luster and crackle after crackle overwhelming their senses. Still, Dean could hear his pulse in his ears.
Castiel pursed his lips. “Yes, that. But I guarantee that I didn’t steal it. Forgive me if I don’t feel the need to explain further.”
Dean Winchester had been through hell. It was going to take a lot more than threats and deductions to make him scram.
“Brothers,” was the last breath he took before the fragile grip he had on Dean’s hands faded into evanescence.
He had been in a different state by then, and still, it was as if everything around him was pointing to the direction of Lawrence—of course it could be that there was just a lot of controversy surrounding the theft that rumors reached across borders, there was that—but he swore that he did his best to avoid it. To eschew the case from his mind. But a force bigger and stronger than himself must have been at work, because now he was driving Baby towards his hometown, where he hadn’t visited ever since he first left.
“Um, hello, Agent Smith. Just peachy.” His eyes darted from Dean to Castiel, as though knitting them together with his gaze, trying to find something he couldn’t see quite clearly.
“Hey now, don’t you go on dyin’ before me,” warned Benny, coughing before turning to face sideways to peer at his best friend that no longer responded to him.
Dean scoffed. “This ain’t a classroom. This is a museum,” he said, looking up at the large expanse of the lecture hall, pausing by the last row as if expecting to hear something strange. “How the hell do they hear you from back here?”
“I’m sorry to hear that,” Dean and Castiel said at the same time. They looked at each other, Dean in surprise and Castiel in ‘what?’
“Chuck! Gabe!” he exclaimed, wide-eyed, clambering to a stand along with Dean, who very inconspicuously handed back his trench coat by their behinds.
“Believe me, agent, I’ve got no motive and opportunity to steal the fragment. I’m happily married and Soulshifted; my wife and neighbors can vouch that I was at our monthly gathering the night it was stolen.”
“I would like to hear your version of the story, Dr. Shurley,” Dean prodded. The doctor’s lips quirked at the corner, but it was gone before Dean could register it.
Dean had done his research. It was almost 4 a.m. in the morning, but the heavy bags under his eyes would be worth it, because now he was starting to figure out the enigma that is Castiel Milton.
Castiel slid inside, reaching to the backseat to place the blanket on top of the large woven basket sitting idly.
But in that bubble, no words were needed. He watched Castiel in rapture as the shades of incandescence danced on his features, a rosy hue overlayed maybe because of the alcohol. The man was taking in the sight with awe and fascination, as though it’s the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen.
Today, he was feeling exceptionally murderous. Sure, they now know everything there is to know about Bobby Singer’s soul remnant and they’d read some studies regarding things soul, but was it really worth the large bags residing below Dean’s eyes?
“Uh, yeah. Just came by to drop off your apples. You weren’t at your office, so I thought you’d be home.” He hooked the bag of apples with his finger, bringing it over to Castiel. The man took it graciously, but he nodded to the large, square cardboard in his arms.
Now the next morning after Castiel had launched his ultimatum, he couldn’t stay still. Something was bugging him, and he wasn’t sure what.
“You okay now?” asked Dean cautiously, and he was about to can it for asking such a ridiculous question, but Castiel actually looked like he was contemplating the answer.
Dean stopped writing and slowly looked up. Mike was leaning towards him, elbows crossed on her legs and smile twinkling impishly.
Unconvinced but not prodding any further, he gestured to his left with a smile. “It’s almost sunset, Dean. And I got us the best seats in the house.”
“Shhh!” Dean waved his hands frantically and traipsed briskly down the steps to Castiel’s desk. “Someone could hear you! Don’t call me ‘Winchester’!” he whispered in panic.
Castiel felt as though their surroundings darkened, almost imperceptibly when Dean lit the candle with a gaslight, squirming to avoid the man’s stare.
to thank you, Dean. For coming back to find me, and retrieving me from the staircase, and for. . . for helping me in my unfortunate reaction to the earthquake.”
“Phew!” exclaimed Dean, self-satisfied, only now hearing the small crowd’s broken applause over the din of chatter and continuous ringing.
He gasped at the intrusive image, stumbling backward and blindly grabbling the air for anything solid before he could hit the ground. He found the concrete wall of the building and roughly set his back onto it, focusing his weight on the surface, trying to blink his mother and father out of his vision.
To Castiel’s right, he could descry the entirety of the Douglas County Fairgrounds. The light was low on that side, and most of the stalls had their night-lights on. From above, it looked like an early Christmas. Different illuminations were spread across the grounds, and the noise was nothing more than faraway static.
“Apology not accepted, professor,” Dean clicked his tongue, “Didn’t you hear me say that I don’t believe you?”
He was about to give a green-light when it swung open and revealed a grinning Shurley holding a large tupperware of—are those cupcakes?—on his right hand.
“Yes, well, Kanye West also apologized for his uncouth behavior towards Taylor Swift but it still can’t delete all the videos in the world.”
As they made their way to the elevator, Dean spoke, “Good. Thanks again, Gabriel.” The elevator doors opened, and the taller man stepped inside, but the shorter man didn’t move.
“Yes, seismic activities plagued Kansas during that specific time. It was how nature manifested its anger,” the chancellor explained, before adding, “According to history.”
Castiel ended the call severely, groaning and letting his back fall to the mattress. He closed his eyes, ridding himself of unwanted questions.
“Winchester,” breathed Castiel, but it was lost to the cacophony of vibrations of the building. “Dean, look.” He pulled on the man, and Dean’s eyes darted to him, then to the door that Castiel was staring at. “What? Maybe it’s because of the frickin’ earthquake!”
“Cassie!” Balthazar’s shrill voice boomed in the hallway, making Castiel wince at the loudness. “You look more rumpled than usual. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you had se—”
, thoughts of Dean, thoughts for Dean, memories of him, and every emotion that he had felt since the man first came to town.
Castiel seemed to cease breathing. As though every second was concentrated on Jenny and what her next action was.
He bumped his shoulder to Castiel’s lightly. “Give yourself a little credit, Cas. All your sleepless nights and hard work: you did that. You brought yourself that success.” He shrugged. “With some help.”
Castiel stepped towards the highchair to sit her down gently, and she cooed curiously at Castiel. He laughed silently, an unfamiliar affection waving across him as he gave her a pat on the head. “Thank you, Jenny.”
He loved what he did, but it didn’t mean that it wasn’t exhausting. To him, it was worthwhile to be able to help people, and flowers aided him in that endeavor. It wasn’t easy at first, to find what he wanted to do with his life. After graduating with a degree in Business Management, he flitted from city to city, taking odd jobs while he sought what sort of trade he wanted to take part in. Then about 14 months ago, it hit him like a ton of bricks when staring at nothing in particular during his idle shift at a Gas-N-Sip, his gaze shifted into focus.
“He gave up that piece to the earth in a small town—now Lawrence City—and witnesses said they had seen the earth swallow him whole, leaving only a vestige, a memento that he had ever been there, a memory of what he gave up and what that meant—”
The two men had laughed boisterously, and only increased in volume when they saw Dean had been nonplussed.
Monday morning, Dean came in early. It was a month since he first frequented the shop with the blue-eyed owner that had Dean wanting to visit even if his vase was still good for another day. The peals of the bell signaled his presence, and he was greeted by an Asian kid that looked like a high-schooler.
“Fancy seeing you here, Agent Dean-o!” He strode up next to Dean and looked out the campus. “Enjoying the view? Although I have a much prettier view to recommend you, and he’s just a floor below us.” He winked.
With that, Dean held the ropes firmly in his grasp and began to tug using all the strength his tiny body could muster, and then let go. It had been enough to get the swing going, enough to make Cassie feel the wind blow against her stomach, and enough to get her to gasp and squeal in delight.
Suddenly, he spotted the road they were on, one familiar but new all the same, and Dean recognized that they were not on their way back to Castiel’s house.
Jenny held Castiel’s finger with both of her tiny hands and looked up at him, amazing Castiel at how shiny her eyes were and how her chubby cheeks were pink-tinged.
Her brown eyes that looked as sweet as chocolate must had shaken the boy back to reality, because Dean had planted a quick kiss to her left cheek before he even knew he did it.
resonated mellifluously in his ears, he might have thought Dean had spoken it in real-time. But no, both his eyes and lips were shut.
“Brought you some breakfast.” He advanced to the desk, before pausing in hesitation. “’M not disturbing you, am I?”
There was Castiel at the front, looking like a lost puppy in a trench coat, as a redhead flirted up at him.
Castiel found himself huffing at the irony. “I was actually supposed to start working on my keynote address tonight for the European Conference when the earthquake struck. Every time I’m invited to speak, I would always tackle the role of soul in philosophy. Or of philosophy in soul.”
At that, Jack piped up. “Well, my friends did ask me to come with them to this two-week-long cabin retreat in Washington. But, I don’t think dad’s gonna let me go,” he lamented.
“I have told you a million times, Gabriel,” he gritted out, though a faint pink hue had colored his cheeks. “It’s not a date.”
He offered Jenny to Castiel and he caught her by her armpits, poising her by his waist. She began to tug at his hair.
He replied as much. Gabriel had always been a supporter of his little brother, and they’d talked about him loaning Castiel money for a start-up when he finally picked a line of business. The elder of the Milton brothers by almost 10 years, he was already successful in his gig as a director and producer for an American cable channel, and he’d already spearheaded many television shows.
Dean’s brows were raised in soft surprise. “Huh.” He gazed at his empty plate and back up at the man in front of him. “That’s actually. . . really admirable.”
“Friendly, my ass,” he snickered. “No two people spend that much time together for friendly endeavors.”
Dean knocked on the first door of the 4th floor, and it swung open to reveal a woman in her 30s. Dark, curly hair, and a kind expression on her face. “Yes?”
“And as you know, then dying Bobby Singer had sacrificed his last soul piece to the earth, heartbroken from his lover’s demise, and had given almost his entire soul before they could achieve Soulshift—if she had even been his soulmate,” Dr. Shurley pointed out.
“Not when you’re on the receiving end, it isn’t,” Castiel muttered, and Dean shrugged in admittance. “Still. How long’ve you known Gabriel?” Dean asked, having finished his burger and was now picking his fries and popping them into his mouth.
The man knew instinctively that he should step back, step away, but his feet remained plastered on the floor, wide eyes focused on his friend who was now as close as he had been only a few hours ago.
He was halfway from being taken over by his pride and resorting to getting to the bottom of the footage all by his lonesome, when a searing pain ripped through his head as though someone with a katana or machete severed his crown.
He arrived at the KU campus that afternoon, reading up on the police report on the Silver Fragment theft inside his car when a loud knock against the window startled him. He looked to his left and saw a middle-aged man of short stature with light brown hair wearing a brown tweed suit and a scowl.
Castiel shook his head, positioning his forearms against the table’s side. “Nonsense. I’m fine and perfectly capable of rendering my services. Now what do you need?”
Gabriel waved his hand dismissively. “I wouldn’t worry about it. Things have a way of working themselves out.”
Until the day of Jack’s birth. Kelly died of complications. Instead of a celebration, they had to organize a funeral.
He rolled his eyes at him, their laughter slowly dying but still unable to fight off the smiles. “Eugh. What a rip-off.”
But inside, oh, nothing could have prepared Dean for the majestic room that is the University of Kansas’ Chamber of History.
Castiel had furrowed his eyebrows. “But I don’t want to give my soul away. Or take someone else’s soul,” he had wrinkled his tiny nose in disgust. But his mother only smiled fondly at him.
“Ditching us, Cassie?” He arched a brow. “Fine. Dad and I need to find someone to fix whichever piece broke, anyway.”
What kind of gift was love if it only leads to your demise? Good thing he wasn’t planning on giving up to love any time soon—or ever.
“Mm-hmm. Whatever helps you sleep at night.” Castiel could hear the sarcasm drip through the call. “If it’s not a date, then why are you fussing over your clothes?”
Dean had been fussing around his rucksack, fruitlessly looking for a pencil so he could start the math activity centered on fractions. He must had left it in his room in a rush to leave the house and avoid overhearing more of his parents’ arguments.
“Uh, excuse me,” he said to the bearded man wearing a dad hat that looked uncannily familiar. “Did you see a guy pass by here, about yea tall? Dark hair, blue eyes, sex voice that sounds like he smokes ten packs a day. . . Not that I ever heard it—in the context of sex—I mean. I never. . .” He laughed nervously, scratching his neck at his grating awkwardness.
So even as Castiel was undoubtedly worn out from the day’s events, he had it in his spirit to smile at the young, blonde-haired man whom he had practically raised, genuine and fond. “And what is your essay about?”
“How can it be locked? We just came in here not fifteen minutes ago!” ranted Dean, Castiel giving up on the lever and resting his head on the door that bolted from both sides. “Maybe security was locking up. I can’t tell. Nothing seems to be black and white right now,” he sighed.
“The earthquakes are getting worse. This one felt so debilitating. The last time I could still walk. Tonight, you’ve witnessed me in my most impotent form.” Castiel turned away. “I am sorry you had to see that.”
Dean shook himself out of it, taking a bite out of his burger. “You still got, what—two, three weeks?” he asked, muffled because of the food.
When he looked back up and into the room, there was an abrupt halt in movement. Dean leaned his head to see closer, and there was a man, mirroring standard professor fashion, standing in front of the wooden table.
“Hmm? Sorry, I couldn’t hear you over all the hypocrisy. . .” Dean drawled, an air of someone who had the upper hand pervading him, “And the felony that you’ll be facing.”
His eyes lit up with understanding. “Yup, absolutely. Dad’s gonna be giving him a piece of his mind, Jack.”
