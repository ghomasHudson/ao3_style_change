But he needed to get a break from the same four walls.  Muttering to himself, he rolled off the couch and grabbed his jacket.
“Why would that concern you?” Castiel asked, distracted by Dean’s neck.  He’d been aware that he’d missed or two marks, but he didn’t realize it was quite that many.
Dean nodded and walked away.  He looked good, a little tired still, but fine.  A tightness in Castiel’s chest finally eased after days of feeling like he was constantly holding his breath.
“Dean, “ Cas murmured much later, his hoarse voice soft in the soothing darkness.  He hadn't started out hoarse, that had been a gradual result from all the screaming.  Dean's skills as a lover had never been in question, but he never truly appreciated it the way a human could.
“Are you seriously telling me that you didn’t know?  I thought I was pretty obvious about it.  Sam’s threatened to write you sonnets on my behalf.”
But the situation was drastically different now.  Castiel had none of his former strength, and while he was a skilled warrior in his own right, becoming human had changed everything.
Dean went still, narrowing his eyes as he matched the Angel stare for stare.  This was new.  Even for Cas, that was an unnerving degree of focus.  Definitely weird, but there was something oddly familiar in that particular gaze.  It was a new look on Cas, sure, but Dean had been on the receiving end of that particular brand of intent plenty of times before.
“Dean.  You’re awake.  Why are you awake?”
It was what he’d been doing for over a millennia.  Interposed with the occasional smiting here and there, of course.  A few battles with renegade angels, rogue demons, whatever his Heavenly father required of him.  But mostly, he watched.
“You don’t say,” Cas responded coolly.
----------------------------
It was still discomfiting to see Dean Winchester in this fashion, purely in the flesh.  It seemed so… two-dimensional, when Dean was anything but.  Cas was accustomed to seeing the vibrant golden glow threaded heavily with swirlings of deepest jade and turbulent storm-cloud grey that was Dean's soul energy cascading around his mortal form, his overabundance of aura overwhelming the mundanity of Dean’s physical body.  He'd initially believed that his inability to view that glittering wave to be a crushing loss.  A mistaken viewpoint on his part.  One that had changed the first time Dean had found him, escorting his sadly mortal form to the Bunker.
Dean’s arm darted out as he walked away, flicking the Angel a firm bird before he turned the corner towards the bedrooms.
“I wasn’t hunting, Sammy,” Dean had replied shortly.  “I just, had to take care of a few things.”  As he’d walked by, Sam had caught the familiar odor of old sweat that meant his brother had gotten laid.
It was a gland guard.  The device was designed to rest right across the lower medial area of the neck, covering the fragile mating gland with the sticky-backed, heavy plastic shield.  The guards were actually quite effective, leaving the majority of the neck open for nips and licks while protecting that so-vulnerable spot from accident or temptation.
Dean took a sip from his coffee.  “Cas.  I need a favor.”
“What do we do now?”  Cas reiterated.  “Was that all you had planned? Because you still seem…”
The Alpha voice inside him faded, sated and content, allowing Cas full mental control over his body once more.
The fights were completely voluntary; no holds barred, no rules.  Sometimes you lived to fight another day, other times…not so much.  But that was the nature of the Fifth Ring.  If you couldn’t handle that particular flavor of heat, stay the hell out of the Ring.
“Alright, hop in,” Sam replied.  “The guards will make sure your car stays safe.”
“That we did,” Dean replied with a grin.  He leaned down to hug the petite Alpha.  “Not as good as when you are doing the wheeling-and-dealing, of course, but Sammy here did alright.”
“We need to discuss this privately,” Sam told her, handing the flask back.  “Why don’t you stay here, have some pie?”
Sam snorted; his slut of a brother was unbelievable.  “Of course.  And if your ass isn’t back by dawn we’re leaving without you.”
He stretched his arms high overhead, reveling in the chilly morning air.  A crisp breeze teased along the newly exposed skin of his abdomen, goose bumps prickling up over his warm flesh.  He was past the peak need of his heat, but it’d be a day or two yet before he was completely ready to rejoin the world.  Or maybe never; he thought ruefully.
“Okay.”  Sam scratched awkwardly at his mass of hair.  “I’ll be back.”
Castiel ducked into the deep shadows of the wraparound house porch and waited.
He pulled out a newspaper and leaned against the hood of the car to wait.  It wasn’t long until the couple emerged, arms laden with grocery bags.  Bobby folded the paper and walked past, deliberately shouldering Emmanuel hard as he went by.
And then instinct kicked in and Castiel had managed to yank his mind free of the Prayer, blocking Dean’s voice and coming fully back to himself with a gasp.  Castiel blinked his eyes open and looked up at the overbright halogen lights, pressing his hands against the concrete Bunker wall, craving visceral, tangible proof of his reality.  He wasn’t drowning, wasn’t buried alive in a never-ending expanse of black water.   He was alone in his own mind, safe in the Bunker.
But whatever he was doing, it was at least slowing things down, giving Dean’s giant-sized little brother a desperately needed respite. Cas probably thought he was being generous in helping Sam.  Rewarding his favorite pet’s good behavior, or whatever bullshit the Uber-Angel felt like spewing in the moment.  It would go easier on him if Dean could keep his damn mouth shut, but that just wasn’t his way.
Dean sat despondently on his bedroll, gazing longingly into the rich amber liquid teasing him through the hazy glass of the whiskey bottle.  The nearly full bottle.  His newly relocated shoulder throbbed like a son of a bitch, and his bruised ribs were quick to sing out their own grievances with every shallow inhalation.
“Fine,” Rowena replied crossly.  “Then a bit of angel should do well enough.  Hair, flesh, blood.  Any little piece, really.”
Sam was very sure that their father wouldn’t have seen omegas that way.  Dean had always idolized their dad. It wouldn’t take much.  A few words of disappointment in the fragile time just after a heat, voiced concern that Dean couldn’t do the job, a nudge about Sam’s safety, maybe a jab or two about weak spots.  More than enough for Dean to decide that his dual side was a personal weakness that needed to be shored up by any means necessary.  Dean would not only have agreed to the procedure; he’d have asked for it.
And then he was naked and Castiel didn’t really care what he was saying because damn, the Alpha was gorgeous.  Hot, smoking, beautiful, sexy…mmmm
Dean narrowed his eyes.  “ When I turned 21.  And I had my reasons.”
“So.  Do you know which way your man rolls?”  Sebastian asked.
“Yeah, he’ll be fine eventually.  I promise.  This is hardly his first rodeo.  The whiskey wasn’t the problem, but it was a catalyst.  Dean went into full battle mode to stay sharp through the intoxication, but he didn’t get a kill at the end.  The Hunter in him bucked at being denied its prize.”
The Mark of Cain had risen him, and his idiot demonic self had promptly busted out to parts unknown.  So Sam had to hunt him down, again.  Strangely, it had been far easier this time around.   Even with Rowena’s help, it shouldn’t have been this simple.  He’d caught up with Dean in less than 48 hours.  Perhaps without Crowley egging him on, Deanmon didn’t bother thinking about anything beyond his own amusement.  Or more likely, Dean had a private agenda all his own, though Sam had absolutely no clue what Demon Dean could want.  The last time the Mark had brought him back to twisted life, he hadn’t seemed all that intent on planning ahead.  Deanmon thought it, he did it, with little regard for what would happen next.
“No.  Never again.  You’re a Winchester, Dean.  You will act like it.  Winchesters do not do that.  No son of mine pulls that shit, do you understand me?”
Castiel straightened in shock, eyes wide as he took in Dean’s deadly serious gaze.  That was one way to fix things.  If Dean claimed Castiel, there would be no rejection, no illness.  They’d be a mated pair, free of reprisals.  It would save Cas’ life.
This, whatever it was between him and Dean.  It all seems very complicated.
“Everything,” Cas replied, his voice slightly awed.  “The trees talk you know, you just have to learn their language.”
Dean strode away from the other man back towards his people.  A moment later, he heard sounds behind him; apparently the male was coming with after all.  Goodie.  They walked together in silence.
**************
Dean was many things, dumb wasn’t one of them.  And he was almost supernaturally observant.  He must’ve read something of Cas’ hesitation in his body language or expression.  If Cas asked, he knew Dean would agree to switch roles.
He liked bees.
Cas felt the bed shift and Dean moved around, occasionaly stretching across Cas’ naked body with his own as he did...whatever the hell he was doing.  Was he whistling?  Asshole.
Castiel stood invisibly in the Winchester’s hotel.  This was one of the nicer ones; the smell was reminiscent of sandalwood rather than wet dog, and the furniture matched the walls, more or less.  Sam was out; he’d gone to get supplies and dinner.  Between that and the fact that he’d need to fix the spontaneous flat tire on his stolen vehicle, Castiel knew he’d be gone two hours at least.  Plenty of time.
It wasn’t like he’d wanted to do anything with that trucker.  And it was just a blowjob, no matter what his dad seemed to think.  And the man hadn’t hurt him or anything.  He’d gotten his rocks off; given Dean the money as promised and left.
Something in Dean's shoulder crunched as he landed on it with his full weight.  Ignoring the surge of pain, he rolled back to his feet, neatly avoiding a lethal stomp from his opponent.  Didn’t the guy realize his knee was toast?  Stupid knot-head fuck of an alpha.
If his chilly demeanor bothered Dean, the other man gave no indication.  He drove the Impala with the casual ease of long experience, no trace of tension in his slouched position behind the wheel.  Considering how much time he spent traveling with his brother, Dean was probably accustomed to a fair amount of sulking from the right side of the vehicle.  Not that Sam would ever admit that that was what he was doing, but it had always seemed that way to Cas.
“Dean,” she greeted, smiling.  Whatever he was now, she still harbored some affection for the boy she’d once known.
“Silver City?”  Sam asked, monitoring as most of his people fanned out, while others who weren’t going to be spending the night in the field made their way back to camp.
“At least you got one crate of the good stuff,” he added, watching as Jo flounced off toward the loading truck with their prize.
“Way I see it, there’s really only one way handle this,” Dean said with a fatalistic shrug.  “We treat the symptoms.”
It astonished Castiel how much intimate knowledge Meg had about the individuals on the list, especially for not being omega.  But betas had healthy sex drives too, and apparently that wasn’t something that got you insulted, or worse assaulted, in this pack.
“No cats,” Cas dissuaded, though he looked quite pleased with himself.  “Just me.”
“C’mon,” Dean growled. He leaned down; chest pressed against Cas’ back, and nipped him on the ear.  Hard.  Cas grunted.
“So, nothing will change.”
Ellen followed Sam across the way to the other identical house.  It was surprisingly spacious, neat and quite tidy for a single alpha male.  Dean was right about one thing; Sam did have a nice writing area set up.
Castiel’s house, like most of the pack structures was built with endurance and function in mind, with no claim whatsoever to aesthetics.  He had one major living room, with the far wall turned into a kitchenette.  A smallish side room held a large bed and some basic furniture, with a tiny attached bathroom and a squat, claw foot tub.
“Is this really how it’s gonna be?” Dean asked, gaze serious and maybe a touch hurt.  “You only want a piece when you’re the one holding all the aces?”
Chuckling, Benny saluted him with his cap and faded away into the night.
Walking away couldn’t have been easy for such an aggressive dominant.  Fighting his natural alpha drive that way had to have been difficult.  Most wouldn’t bother.  Dean’s behaviour was the very embodiment of an excellent, extremely controlled Alpha.  Which perversely made Castiel want him even more.  Stupid omega hormones.
Castiel looked at Sam. “You don’t seem to be mad at me.”
Dean went still, dark eyes running down the length of Castiel’s curled body.  After a moment, he turned and silently padded back up toward his tent, the silvery light unfairly bright as it glistened teasing across what had to be a supernaturally perfect set of gluteal muscles.
“Everyone but me, apparently,” Cas replied darkly.
Grabbing his jacket and taking a quick glance in the mirror to make sure he was presentable, he ducked out the door.  He was looking a little rough around the edges, but still, pretty damn good for a man who’d only recently dug his way out of his own grave.
Castiel glanced uncertainly at Naomi, who looked liked she’d just swallowed an entire orchard of lemons, but she didn’t object.  Shrugging, Gadreel took a seat on one of the two sideways crates a Winchester soldier and hastily supplied before fading back in with the other hunters.
Dean grinned as the lone figure stealthily approached. Looks like Sam’s belongings were safe.  Tonight, anyway.  Definite rain check on that, though.  Dean had plans for his brother’s toothbrush.
It took a good 20 minutes to reach the road, Winchester territory having slowly grown over the years.  Ten heavy motorcycles, each decorated with a distinctive set of enormous black wings down either side, waited at the designated meeting area.  The group was carefully overseen by a number of stone-faced Pack guards.  Ten Halo bikes.  It was an entire garrison.
Slowly he came back to himself, recovering from the jarring psychic hit.  Even after he’d begun to reason again it took a moment for Castiel to understand the true horror of what he was experiencing. When he did, he wasn’t sure if it was better or worse than his initial impression that Dean was swimming alone in some endless ocean.
“What was I supposed to do, Dad? Huh?  It’s not like I didn’t know what I was doing; I know you saw me under the bleachers with Monty last month.  I figured, why not? Two hundred bucks, that’s what that guy offered me.  More than enough money to hold us over ‘till you got back.  And for what, twenty minutes work?”
He was shaking too hard to stand, the world would not stop spinning, and he’d vomited so much he was reduced to dry heaves.  And he was so ridiculously horny that he’d fuck a fallen tree branch if he could find some way to manage it.  Even some of the more phallic shaped pinecones were beginning to look like a viable option.
Castiel ground his teeth.  This was a terrible idea.  There was only one logical candidate for the Winchesters to field.  Castiel would not allow Dean to fight for him against a Halo soldier.  It would be a slaughter.
--------------
Dean extricated himself from the clinging ginger.  “Charlie, would you do me a favor?  We need someone to play host for Cas, here.  He needs to a mentor that won’t punch him in the face.”
Jo sniffed, reluctantly pulling back so she could look her mother and Alpha in the eye.  She roughly wiped one arm across her eyes, swiping at the ashy tears.
“What, um, what do I need to say, or do, to get you to keep doing that?”  Cas finally stammered out.  “Please?”
The redhead slid down Sam’s overlong frame until she was back on land.  She spun to face him.  “The one and only,” Charlie replied with a wink.  “Who are you?”
Dean raised an eyebrow, meeting the angel’s steady gaze.  He grinned wickedly.  “Count on it.”
“Hello, Alpha Harvelle,” Castiel replied evenly.  “Thank you for taking me in.  It’s very kind of you all.”
“Dean…” Cas began weakly.  Because he did trust Dean absolutely.  And really, Castiel always wanted Dean.  Ever since that first innocent, curious taste, he’d found himself impossibly addicted to the other man.
Dean’s struggling against Cas’ iron grip elicited the desired effect; Cas squeezed tighter, his movement’s becoming rougher.  Exactly the way the hunter wanted it.  The way Dean’s hips bucked powerfully against his, and his groan’s of pleasure, interposed with grunted demands for more, spurred him on to even greater lengths.
Joining Dean with Michael once more, even with the tables turned, had other unfortunate consequences.  It became apparent that Dean was slowly recalling more details from the times he’d existed as an Archangel’s puppet.  He was sharing Michael’s memories, accessing memories of things that the Archangel had done while he had control of his vessel.
When they came out, they weren’t alone.  A dozen or so folk ringed the blazing fire, the flames lighting up the quickly darkening evening.  Dean stood among them, passing around the one bottle remaining of her moonshine left, clearly purloined from her jeep.  Not that it mattered, she reminded herself; the bottle, like the jeep, was his now.
Sam sighed.  Dean wouldn’t talk about it if he asked.  He hadn’t when he and Cas had first started going bump in the night, and he almost certainly wouldn’t now.
“Hey,” Dean interrupted.  “It wasn’t a big deal.  You didn’t hurt me, Cas.”  Castiel was aware that he hadn’t caused physical pain, but spiritually…he was shocked that Dean was allowing him anywhere near him again, much less with touching privileges.
Magicking a concealed knife into his hand, Dean clutched the other man by the hair, baring his neck.  He raised his arm to slash.
But at the moment, both he and his omega were in accord.  He’d screwed up, and nearly gotten people he cared for hurt.  Whatever Dean demanded of him in recompense he would agree to.
“Remember our deal, Cas,” Dean growled.  “No lies.  So I’m askin’.  Do you want to leave with them?”
Dean hadn’t always craved violence, but as a Hunter class Alpha he had the capacity for it.  His father had needed violent warriors when the pack was newly formed and growing fast.  Too fast.
This was exactly why he’d moved so fast.  Getting Dean to accept what they both wanted was, for reasons Cas didn’t truly understand, a daunting task.  Now was the moment where he found out if he’d succeeded in getting them there, past whatever ghosts plagued the hunter’s mind, or whether they both stopped, frustrated and unsatisfied.  He’d experienced both outcomes enough times in the past to know it could go either way.
Sam also recognized the lie, of course.  Dean’s younger brother knew the whole denial game by heart.  Sam was also astute enough to understand that Dean needed him to believe what he was telling them.  At least for the moment.  So he said the right things and made the appropriate noises.  Sam was a very patient hunter.
“I didn’t ‘sneak in’, I flew in.  But yes, that’s what I’m referring to.  What I did to you that night, Dean…”
“I remember everything, you know.  From before?  Becoming human didn’t rob me of a single memory.”
“Okay,” Sam agreed, gaze troubled.  Sammy was so smart.  Too smart, sometimes.  But there was nothing else John could say to reassure his boy, and he still had Dean to deal with.  Soul heavy, he walked out, securing the door behind him.
Dean hastily stood up from where he’d been lounging across his bed, his tone deliberately nonchalant.  “Hey, Cas.  What’s up?”
Dean wore a pair of soft, well-aged jeans that had to be more for lounging than anything else, the frayed denim hugging the perfect contours of his ass.  His long sleeved tan knit shirt was tightly stretched across his wide shoulders and the sleeves were rolled up to bare his forearms.
Their caravan was fairly small.  It included two large older trucks, their canvas-covered beds built to hold large amounts of cargo, two rusty open framed jeeps, one truly antiquated looking truck with an extended cab, and a number of bitsa motorcycles- vehicles coggled together with a bits a this and a bitsa that.
Apparently satisfied, Rowena slipped the piece of horn into a side pocket, smiling brightly.  She then hopped back up onto the tailgate, resuming her former spot while she continued to sip elegantly at her whisky.
“Right?” Dean agreed smugly.  “Eyes so blue they practically glow, power for days in those long legs, and don’t get me started on that ass.”
As yet, they still no idea about what, if any thing, could actually hurt GodCas, so there was no real point in trying to fight him.  And there wasn’t really any reason to bother, anyway.  It wasn’t as if what was about to happen was anything like new for Dean.
Dean nodded, gaze fixed on the ground.  “Yes, sir.”
Dean stood, tossing a number of bills on the table.  “Sure.  C’mon, let’s head out.  I don’t know about you, but I am bushed.”
And just like that, all hope of derailing this ‘O’ train went right out the fucking window.
Castiel nodded cautiously.  She swung agily over the railing, her long jacket flaring behind her, revealing a pair of fighting knives tucked in waist sheaths.
Two days and one long jeep trip later, Ellen parked at a dilapidated wooden outpost.  The rickety stand stood on uncertain legs, a good eight feet up.  Of course, the fragile state was a ruse.  Hidden below the weathered and creaky wood, solid metal beams held the structure solidly above ground.  A single guard watched her warily from his spot above.
Dean smiled.  “That’s because Anna likes me and wants me to be happy.”
Dean glared at him.  “No need to be rude. It was just a simple question.”
“Dean, no.” Sam barked out. “Stop!”
“Agreed.  So, we move on to plan B.”
In which GodCas isn't done with his pet, Sam isn't as oblivious as he seems, and everything sucks for Dean.
Dismissing the angel’s slightly erratic behavior as Cas being Cas, Sam glanced to his left.  The petite redhead he’d gone to some lengths to acquire sat curled up next to him, her legs tucked delicately under the emerald green ankle length cashmere dress.  Pure cashmere.  He shuddered at how much the little witch hadn’t paid for it.
Dean blinked, and in an astonishing display of will, buried the monster as if it had never been.  Ellen stared.  What she'd just seen was impossible.  Feral Hunter alphas were beasts; living weapons. Let off the chain and pointed at an enemy with no expectation of survivors.  She’d never heard of any with this degree of control over their inner monster.
He reached around to the front of Dean’s neck, pulling the key to the handcuffs off the leather necklace he’d hastily tied on earlier.  Dean bucked against him, making Cas snarl and press his cock against Dean’s denim-covered ass, pressing firmly with his hips.  “Be still,” he murmured, hot breath and soft lips dancing along the sensitive skin behind Dean’s ear.
“We’re fair, “ Sam promised.  “And as you said, we look after our own.”
Dean had managed to remove his pants back in the other room and already had one knee on the bed and was smoothly crawling up to meet Cas on the bed.  He slid his hips flush against Cas’ slick-soaked ass, sliding his cock between Cas cheeks and gliding gently.
“Please what?”  Dean murmured, pressing all of his weight onto Cas’ trapped body.  “You can have anything you want; all you have to do is ask.”
Dean’s eyes flew open and he rolled away fast, moving so far that he fell off the bed.  He hit the floor, landing hard on his ass and continued some sort of crabwalk backwards until he hit the far wall.
"I'm sorry, Cas."  Quiet words, but heartfelt.  "I shouldn't have left like that.  You're right; I owed you more."
Dean blanched, shame a red flush across his too-pale face.  “Yes, sir.”
The approaching vehicle held two people, both large men.  It came to a stop a few feet away, it’s occupants hopping nimbly out and striding casually towards her.  Ellen stared up, and up. Great Moon they were massive.
“Thank you,” he muttered, eventually letting go.  Cas took a deep breath of air now that his lungs were no longer compressed.
The cuff’s energy flared back at him, smashing against his power with all the force of a brick wall.  Cas grunted, stunned, and fell to his back.   Cas eyes sparked a few times as his aborted attempt to reach his grace died away.
When he came around the corner, Dean was loading their duffel bags in the trunk of the Impala, Sam handing him the lighter loads.  He didn’t know what Dean had said to his little brother, but Sammy was laughing, no sign of his earlier concerns evident.
The place would be missed.  But ‘missed’ didn’t put food in empty bellies.
Dean rubbed tiredly at his eyes with one hand, the other clenching into a fist.  “The sooner the better.”
“Now, in about a minute, I’ll have this open.  And you will be free.  Do whatever the fuck you want.  If you want a place to live, my pack will take you in.  We have a thriving territory a few days out and have more than enough room for you.  There are plenty of alphas and more than a few betas back home willing and capable of helping you through your heat.  Now generally, I’m on that list, but I am about fucking done with you, no matter how gorgeous you are.  So, if you want to join my pack, follow me.  If not, go. Be free.  Find your damn bliss or whatever.”
“Oh, excuse me.  Sorry about that,” Bobby said easily, tipping his hat.
“So,” Cas began once he’d settled down a bit.  “What’s next?”
“What?” Sam asked, clearly confused and unhappy about the fact.
He looked right at Bobby, his eyes not showing even the vaguest hint of recognition.
This was just Dean doing what he always did.  Whatever it took to protect his Pack.
Castiel kicked at his omega’s ankles to spread them, deciding he liked them staying bound by the pants.  He pressed one hand firmly between Dean’s shoulder blades, forcing him against the wall.  “Stay,” he told him firmly.
Castiel sat back and watched the decamping process.  Despite the occasional squalls from people woken too damn early, they worked well together.  He approved of the efficiency.
“Stop,” Castiel said, stepping around Sam.  “I’ll leave with them.”  Which wasn’t remotely the same as agreeing to return home with them, but they could interpret his statement how they would.
“I mean it, Dean.  I don’t want to discover anything like that ever again.”
Sam glanced up, his eyes seeing too much as always.  “You were gone a while.  Eventful walk?”  He asked, tone carefully neutral.  His gaze slid to the bottle of home made hooch in Dean’s hand, but he didn’t say anything.  Sam always was the smarter of the two of them.
“Sammy, you mind giving us a minute?”  Dean asked.
Dean didn’t love these periodic forays into any of the distant towns surrounding his territory.  Sure, when it had just been him and Sam it’d been one of favorite past-times.  But things were different now.  It wasn’t just him and Sam against the world anymore.  He had people now; friends and family that depended on him for their safety.
The two cousins glanced at each other, then dropped their gazes and began making their way out.  Ellen didn’t hold it against them; she understood their resistance all too well.  The elder of the pair’s sister had been badly injured in their last skirmish with raiders.  They needed every penny they could find to pay the medics that were overseeing her care.
---------------------
But not yet.  Right now he needed something else.  Cas rose up, gripping the base of Dean’s cock and holding it in place as he slowly teased his way down the Alpha’s length until his ass rested on Dean’s hips.  He clenched his hole, smiling when Dean grunted, the alpha’s whole body tensing in response.
So saying, he lowered his hips, smoothly taking the rest of the Alpha's cock until the firm cheeks of his ass rested on Cas’ hips.
Dean froze in position, the edge of the blade pressed against the unconscious man’s throat.  Dean met his brother’s gaze, his eyes still sharp behind the whiskey-induced haze.   A faint red sheen skittered eerily across his irises.
But what she saw wasn’t some beta blockheads kicking a fuss.  A dozen folk of all ages, sexes, and yes, apparently types, were sparring in an organized class.
“Fuck me,” He demanded, looking challengingly over his shoulder at his mate.
The idea sent a brief nervous twinge down Cas’ spine, an unpleasant reminder that he couldn’t just disappear at will, that if Dean plied his full strength on him, that it would be no illusion this time; he’d have to rely entirely on trust.  Just as Dean had done for him every other time when he willingly put his body into an Angel’s powerful grip.
Takes place during episode 5.3, Free To Be You and Me
He legitimately screamed, new wetness pouring out of him, soaking them both where they were connected, saturating the blanket beneath them.  Dean continued to fuck him though his orgasm, groaning as Castiel’s ass clenched around him.
Crowley wasn’t placing his bets on a winner of the fight; the locals all knew Dean would be victorious.  No, the real profit would be later, when the betting changed to which prize Dean would choose.  Crowley clearly had a death wish.
Sipping his coffee, he paid close attention, attaching the few names he knew to faces. Benny walked past with a heavy-looking crate slung over one shoulder.  He spared Castiel a glare as he passed.  Castiel could have behaved and simply dropped his gaze.  But he didn’t, choosing instead to glare evenly back.
Suddenly Castiel was hoisted over Dean’s shoulders as he carried towards the bedroom.  The man really was ridiculously strong.
Castiel nodded silently, dubious that they’d actually allow an omega into a fighting class.
Dean dropped his head back against the concrete wall, eyes closed.  “I quit having heats by 19.  I didn’t have another one until I dug myself out of my grave and realized that my reincarnation had been just a bit too thorough.  Thanks for that, by the way.
“Feels a little different, huh?” Dean asked from somewhere vaguely above him, voice teasing.
“Take this one,” Dean began, winking.  “I did, anyway.  Many, many times.”
“Please, Dean.  I’m asking you.  Give me the knife?”  Time froze as the a silent contest of wills dragged on.  And then something gave.  Sam sighed heavily in relief when Dean reluctantly loosened his grip, allowing his brother to take it from his shaking hand.
He didn’t bother with teasing; they had time to play and explore later.  Gripping Dean’s erection with one fist to hold it steady he opened his mouth wide to accommodate the impressive width and took it as deeply as he could before his gag reflex kicked in, forcing him to back off.
“Angel’s don’t have second natures,” Sam argued.
Satisfied that her friend and one of the few remaining fighters left to her was going to be okay, Ellen turned back, looking into the distant south.  They had a few vehicles.  Not enough for everyone to ride, though.  Even if they left everything behind.  And they’d never be fast enough on foot.  Running wouldn’t work.  Fighting was death.
Cass rumbled a frustrated purr deep in his chest.  His mate was so annoying. But Dean was worth it.  Mostly.  Well, at least he had a nice ass.
“Cas?” Sam asked the angel, pitching his voice to carry over to the other side of truck.  Castiel startled, as if he’d just been recalled to the task at hand.
Sam finished getting dressed, taking his sweet time.  For once, they weren’t in any big hurry.  Dean had nearly finished loading the Impala, but he could wait.  Sam was just so tired.  Sleep had become a rare and precious commodity, what with Lucifer playing Angel of Music 24-7 in his subconscious.
Castiel was cleaning his long knife after weapons practice.  It had been almost a week since the Halos had come and gone.  And since the pack had made a major windfall with the amazing bargain Alpha Ellen had worked out, Castiel was definitely in favor with his packmates.
Castiel stilled.  “You what?”
Dean fished his set of lock picks out of a pocket. He reached for the omega’s wrists and began picking the restraint’s lock.  It was trickier doing it with his off hand, but he'd manage.
“Yes,” the omega replied bitterly.  “Simple.  I’m going to make it even simpler.  Yes, despite my attitude I’m really an omega.  Yes, I’ll be going into heat shortly.  If you so much as think about sticking your knot in me, I’ll cut your alpha testicles off and feed them to you.”
Hmm.  That was odd.  Normally there were a good half dozen items available as enticement to fight, and the winner got to choose one.  They must have had a busy day in the ring.  Either that or these would be particularly high-ticket items.  Crowley was carefully to reserve higher value prizes for the biggest fights.  And now that he knew Dean would be coming in, he could expect one hell of a draw.  Winchesters always did; but none more so than Dean.
It wasn’t all that he smelled, but that was between Benny and Dean.  It wasn’t the first time the two damaged males had found a measure of peace in each other and it was unlikely to be the last.
He was long past chills and pain, the heat urges more than satisfied with the overwhelming rush of alpha pheromones and the most intense pummeling he’d ever felt.  He’d been with alpha’s of Dean’s length before, and his width, but the combination of the two was like nothing he’d every experienced.  His ass would never be the same.  So. Fucking. Worth. It.
Castiel gets his first clue of what it is to be a Winchester.  A wild Jo makes another appearance.  Dean pulls a Dean, Sam is Sam, and merrily we move along.
The hell it was.  “When? And why?” Sam asked,  “Why would you mutilate yourself like that?”
(Circa 5.3 Free To Be You and Me)
“I was on my way to warn you.  Marauders to the south.  Lots of them.”  Asa hesitated.  “They’re Black Eyes.”
He had just set a crate of ammunition down when Jo walked up, snagging several handguns from the shelf.  The petite blonde’s specialty was blades, but she was still an excellent shot.  Her mother would never tolerate sloppy shooting.
“Clan Fang offers a fighter! ” A deep voice roared.
“Dean.  It’s okay.  They’re right.  I was born a Halo and I need to go. “
Castiel’s hips snapped against the blankets as he humped the bed in time with his eager mouth.  They would have time for finesse later.  Now he just needed them both to come, and he needed it now.
And that was not something Castiel would allow.  First, there was always the chance that he could use that link to somehow find Dean should he go missing again.  Second, that connection, however terrible, told him that someplace, somewhere, Dean was alive and fighting.  It was a horrifying security blanket, but one that Castiel was unwilling to give up.  Third, well, Cas wanted to be with his friend, no matter what that entailed.
Not again.
“You’re different,” Dean continued after a moment.  His hand resumed moving along Cas’ shaft.  “I’ve never craved anyone the way I do you.”
His naked flesh was pebbled with goose bumps, cold and hot at the same time though the pitch-black chamber he was ensnared in was quite reasonably thermo-regulated.  He did his best to choke back a sob as another flash of sensation wracked him; it was best not to make noises; it only seemed to encourage his torturer to greater heights.  As it was, he felt he was very close to breaking.
Dean laughed.  “Kinky bastard.  Well, I’ll try anything once, twice if its fun.”
Without conscious thought, Castiel lunged forward and savagely bit into Dean’s mating gland, claiming the Alpha as his own.  Joy and pride, satisfaction and pleasure, saturated his body as he reveled in his prize.  Then he tasted blood on his tongue and the wall of reality came crashing down, clearing the possessive fog from his mind.  His eyes flew open with a horrified realization.
Cas reached up, taking hold of his own legs, helping Dean keep him bent over.  The move was a particular act of genius on his part as it allowed Dean to let go with one hand and wrap it around Cas’ cock, his hand wet with slick and precum.  He jerked Cas off in quick, rapid strokes in jarring counterpoint to his thrusts.
A cheerful female with bright red hair was leading the class.  Ellen watched as she easily took down a large male she’d been demonstrating on.  The alpha didn’t appear to mind kissing dirt, instead asking to be shown again so he could try it.
On the outside, the pack Arm House was nothing special.  It looked like any of the other small block homes dotting Winchester center.  One had to look closely to note the reinforced locks at all the doors and armed guards reclining on the wraparound porch 24-7 to realize it wasn’t what it seemed.
The first time Sam had seen this type of mark since waking up crazy, he’d had his suspicions, but no facts to back it up.  The second time he’d noticed, he’d made a point of watch his brother; noting odd moments or behaviors suggesting he was newly injured for no reasons that Sam knew of.
“Yeah?” Dean asked, his grin reminiscent of his Deanmon days. It was a fair parallel; he’d been a sadistic monster then, too.
The other members were nearly as welcoming, nosily curious about ‘that odd omega Dean had rescued’, but were quick to return to their own business at Jody’s warning growls.  Protective in the way of truly good alphas, she’d sensed his discomfort and settled him in a corner by the fire where he could watch the pack move about, the placement granting him privacy without feeling excluded.
“Whatever,” Dean growled. He turned and walked toward their newest pack member, Sam and Ellen just behind him.
Dean grinned to himself.  He had dedicated a good deal of time to teaching his oversized younger brother that particular look.  He smiled wider at the fat pile of crates that had yet to be taken.  They’d made a good haul this time.
“Well, I am irresistible,” Dean agreed.  The smiled faded.  “But I figured it was just your omega reacting to its Alpha, and not what you really wanted.  Otherwise why would you avoid me all this time?”
Half of the bikers behind Naomi dismounted as one, the single move disturbing in its perfect choreography. That was one of the most tightly kept Halo pack secret.  Along with a lifetime of learning fighting with their blades, Halos trained from the cradle to read a form of micro body language, giving them perfect symmetry of motion to the point it looked nearly telepathic.  Naomi’s ability to nearly invisibly direct the squad of soldiers was one of several skill sets that made her an incredibly lethal opponentl.
“Raiders?” Dean asked eagerly.  “Tell me they’re raiders.”
Dean rested his forehead on Cas’ shoulder, panting heavy gusts of warm air as he continued to ruthlessly work his tiring muscles without sacrificing speed.   But even he was unable to sustain such a brutal pace.
“Yeah, thanks Gandhi,” Dean growled in faked annoyance, even as something in him warmed.
--------------
“Enough with the woolgathering.  We doing this or what?” Dean asked, bringing him back to the present.
Dean strode forward, taking Castiel into his arms, pulling the omega’s back flush with Dean’s bare chest.  Cas didn’t fight the handling; rather, he leaned heavily back into his mate and tilted his head in invitation, readily baring his neck for his alpha.
She’d made this journey alone, much to her pack’s consternation and her daughter’s disapproval.  But Jo was needed back home to keep an eye on things, and Ellen didn’t want to take her on what would potentially be a suicide run.  If she was lucky.  It was no small thing for a pack Alpha to brazenly walk into another pack’s territory unannounced.
Castiel loved it here so much.  He clenched his fist, hoping against logic that there was some way this wouldn’t end in disaster.  But even if he somehow managed to evade the Halos, would the Pack allow him to keep his place among them?   Would Dean?
Cas released Dean’s cock so quickly the hunter staggered a bit at the unexpected loss.  Before he had time to complain, Cas slid his hands to Dean’s back, thrusting both hands under the fabric of his underwear, taking a firm grip on his ass, molding gently.
“This is pack central,” Sam told her.   “The outer ring of homes are private residences, but the more central ones are shared resources.  Dinner hall, weapons storage, supplies, motor pool, et cetera,” he explained, though he didn’t point out which was which.
Daisy-Ann killed with a carefree liberty that made even Bobby uncomfortable.  That she was asking him to stay his hand, well, that alone was enough to make him real curious.  He had to know what this thing was.
----------------------
-----------
“Men have penis’ while women have vaginas.  I’m aware of basic human anatomy,” Castiel told him, slightly annoyed.
A slight tickle against his mind warned Cas that he was being sought again.  Called by one of only two people alive who knew him well enough to forge such a connection.  He ruthlessly blocked the anguished Prayer, shielding his mind against the heartbreakingly familiar voice.
The sound of feathers rustling in the quiet night, and Cas was gone.
What was interesting though, was hubby may call himself Emmanuel, but he was the spitting image of a certain renegade angel that had disappeared on them earlier that year.   Bobby watched through the glass of the store he was currently staking out while the mystery man walked by his wife’s side, placidly pushing a grocery cart.
“That it.  The only thing my pack has of value.  No bottles, those are long raided.  But I got the recipe.” She tapped her head.  “I’ll write it all out to the last detail.  I know it don’t sound like much, but that hooch kept us afloat for years.  It ain’t nothing.”
“Alright.  Why don’t you hop out?  Not enough room up front, really.”  He’d managed in the past, but he wanted this to be more than some random quickie.
The long forgotten vibrator that had first teased his cock into hardness, his balls to clench in foolhardy anticipation, had been long forgotten, Dean’s hot mouth and talented tongue distracting him.  But apparently the toy had not been entirely abandoned.
Dean hopped the fence, ignoring the way his shoulder screamed and his ribs burned.  Maybe he’d managed to crack one or two, after all.  No matter, a good taping up and he’d be golden.
“Jeez, Cas.  Where the fuck did that come from?”
Looking distinctly green around the gills, he reached for the bottle, filling the glass until it overflowed.  He straightened his spine, and slammed the shot fast, stuttering as it burned its way down his throat to join its many, many friends.
Castiel was now completely certain that Dean wouldn’t allow himself to be buried alive in the ocean, not anymore.  Not when he knew Castiel might end up sharing his fate.
And now the man had just accused him of being a rapist.  Dean hadn’t done a damn thing to the omega.  Not even a little harmless scenting, though it was more than clear from the luscious scent wafting off him that the man was close to his heat.
Cas stood in the center of the room, staring levelly at the hunter, his eyes so blue they nearly glowed.  Yet, anyway.  They weren’t glowing yet.  Dean fully expected to get a full dose of the Angelic Headlight effect before they were done.
“Company’s comin’ in,” Ellen called down from her perch.  “Think they decided on round two after all?”
Sam sighed.  “I’ve found that it’s always easier for the person who was wronged to forgive than the person who has to watch the fallout.  But yes, we’re okay.  This isn’t your fault.”
“First things first,” she told him.  “Food and a shower.”
He didn’t, but the smirk on has face clearly said he was thinking it.
“I know that he has had sex with men in both of the positions you’ve described,” Castiel told him.  “I’m not sure what his preference is, though. We haven’t discussed it.”
Jody shook her head.  “Nah.  I appreciate the offer, but everyone here has specific jobs.  We’re a pretty well oiled machine.  Best to leave everyone to do their thing.  Next time.”
What was with Cas and the damn hickies all the time?  Of course, the dude always had been into marking.  And the impulse hadn’t exactly been curtailed when they’d finally started sleeping together.  He needed to remember to make Cas heal all the overtly visible ones when they were done.  Past experience proved he’d ‘forget’ to remove the ones that could be hidden beneath clothing, regardless of Dean’s requests.
Dean moved onto to his knees, giving his cock an absent stroke to ease the painful hardness.
Then his belly rumbled, his all-too-human body betraying him at the primal level.  Cas ducked away, refusing to acknowledge Dean’s knowing chuckle.
Castiel wouldn’t blame the Alpha for making a move, not with the way he was stinking up the place, but he would take actions to dissuade him.  Castiel was a being of more than simple instinct, and his mind was not on board with his body’s clear message of ‘Oh, hell yes’.
“I need to know the proper procedures and skills necessary in order to safely engage in penetrative anal sex with a human male,” he replied, looking expectantly at the screen.  Despite his clearly stated query, the screen remained still.
“Accident,” Cas replied, as he always did, opening his mouth for Dean’s probing tongue.  Dean chuckled.
“I’m Sebastian.  C’mon, Hot Stuff, let’s go across the street, get a coffee together and I’ll tell you everything you want to know.”
“Jimmy Novak was indeed an Alpha,” Castiel confirmed.  “But Angels take vessels with secondary natures all the time; our celestial essence overwhelms all of that.”
Then his wet cock was bare to world, no soft mouth cocooning it in soft, warm heat.  He glanced down, looking towards the girls askance.  Then he understood, they were taking it up a notch; that worked for him.
She climbed into car besides Dean when he slid behind the wheel, Sam in back.  “So, how many eyes you got in that grass?” She asked casually.
Sam loved their father.  But sometimes he hated the man.
“Please, alpha,” he groaned.  “Please fuck me.  I need your cock.”
“Really, it’s all about the build up,” Dean glanced at his phone, smirking faintly at the image looking so intently back at him.  He looked up into the distance, eyes flashing to demon black before bleeding back to their usual shade of fan fiction green, the transition so quick that the ladies completely missed it.  Not that they really mattered in the grand scheme of things.
“What, me? Well, staying for the end, of course.  The show isn’t nearly over yet.   And really Samuel, its best to keep me around, don’t you think?  In case your glowering friend fails?  A witch in the hand, and all that.”
The dude had literally died for them.  The least Dean could do was help a buddy out.  That excuse was so flimsy he could use it as a Frisbee, but he made the conscious decision not to overthink it.
Cas snorted.  Duh.
--------------------------
Dean caught Castiel’s interested gaze, grinning as he shook his head.  “Freaking angel voyeur.  Good to know some things never change.”
Dean knew exactly what was up.  He’d known since he got back that there was no of avoiding this particular conversation.  That didn't mean he was particularly looking forward to it.  Dean watched warily as the angel closed the door behind him with exaggerated care.
I should add a warning for slight non-con.  And tons of truly mediocre smut.
Most of them, anyway.
Dean locked eyes with him, baring his teeth slightly in playful challenge.  “So, your gonna drive this boat, huh?  Okay, omega.  Let’s make it interesting.  Who do you think will come first?  Loser gives the other a blowjob.”
Dean strode out of the shower in that tiny towel, barking something moderately offensive at his brother, laughing when Sam raised a middle finger at him without bothering to look up from the screen of his computer.
And still Dean fought, struggling to rise, endlessly swimming towards a surface that didn’t exist.  In desperation his mind had cried out for Sam, and Castiel, even God to hear him.
The rider tugged off the helmet, revealing a pale redhead with big doe eyes, wearing an adorable scowl.
Castiel went very still, wary of how the Alpha would interpret the scent.  He straightened his right arm, preparing to loose his blade from its sheath.
He was laying it on thick, but the farmer’s daughters were eating it up.  And as for that other thing…well, as best he could judge, this was going even better than he’d expected.  It wouldn’t be long now.
Cas pulled himself to the edge of the bed, stopping only when the chains pulled taut.  He wanted nothing more than to go to Dean, hold him, check on him.  Something.  Anything.  But he had the feeling that, even were he able, Dean wouldn’t allow him anywhere near him at the moment.
“Feel better now?” Sam asked dryly.
“Not so great with computers, huh?” She asked.  “I can help.  What are you trying to look up, exactly?” She leaned over him and placed a hand over the little device that controlled the arrow, eyebrow raised expectantly.
But it was a private thing.  Something he’d consciously decided not to talk about.  Not that he really believed Sam was unaware.  His big little brother was far too astute to miss the signs.
Grinning to himself, Dean spun back around and on near silent feet ran back the other way.  Ha.  It was a nice try, but his Alpha would have to work a hell of a lot harder to get him.
Bobby sighed.  That termite infested old pit of a house had been the last reminder of his old life.  Losing that, it was the final nails in the coffin.  He’d thought burying his wife the second time, after killing her of course, had put paid to all that emotional crap.  Apparently not so much.
Cas held very still.  “Is this what you need to make us right?” He asked, his choice of wording deliberate.  “Then take it. I won’t resist.”
Dean downed the rest of his beer in one gulp, desperately trying not to think.  It didn’t work.  He sighed, gazing longingly around the empty room for something, anything to hold his attention.  It was a fruitless endeavor; there wasn’t shit for distractions in the crappy motel room.  Sam was out, doing whatever the hell he did these days.  Dean had quit asking when all he got back was lies.
Sam watched them go.  “I should check in with a few things, and I definitely need a shower,” he reported.  “You two going to be okay?”
While the witch evaluated the new shiny, Sam slipped one of Crowley’s tracker coins into a fold of the dress.  He and Cas could catch her again later.
He was correct, of course.  “I’m sorry,” Castiel muttered.  He’d found himself saying that a lot lately.   “I’d appreciate that list.”
Dean smelled so damn good.  He always had.  Not remotely like rut and sour sweat, the typical reek of the alphas he’d spent so much of his life evading.
Dean groaned, eyes sliding shut as he thrust his hips into the teasing fingers.  “If…if you’re waiting for me to complain, you’re gonna be waiting a while,” he replied, gasping when the angel’s hand gripped his cock as best it could in the confined space.
And then he had it.  Benny.  Wonderful.
Dean spent another twenty minutes wandering aimlessly through the halls.  Even knowing what he was up to, and clearly in agreement with the plan, twenty minutes was all the time his omega was willing to spend away from his Alpha.
Well, that was one way to handle Dean’s feral side, Cas realized in amusement.  Fuck it out of him.  He’d remember that method in case he needed it later.
Whatever Sam and Dean needed to work out, they’d better do it quickly or put it of off until later.  Cas had some very important plans for that tongue.
Dean glanced back at the prize corral.  The omega was still standing straight backed and outwardly calm, though he was noticeably paler.  Poor guy.  Next to him, two betas wearing Crowley’s insignia hauled a fourth crate of ammo onto the enticing treasure pile.  Dean glanced over at Crowley in askance.
“Yes,” Dean replied firmly.  Apparently the angel had needed the assurance.  At least Dean’s instincts were intact, because his brain wasn’t exactly firing on all cylinders at the moment.
Rowena smiled.  “Well, now.  That didn’t hurt, did it?  I said it twas a simple spell, and it generally is, but with all this iron…” She twitched her bound wrists, sighing theatrically.  “I’m afraid it’s a might more difficult, trying to manage a delicate spell under these circumstances.”  She held out the cuffs expectantly.
“Son of a bitch,” Dean muttered.  He leaned back in his chair, sighing heavily.
These days he didn’t see visits to the outer towns as a fun chance to indulge in his favorite vices.  They were overcrowded, filthy and inherently dangerous.  And in a lawless, rough and tumble town like Persephone there were too far many variables that were out of Dean’s control.
Castiel devoutly hoped this loner lady alpha Sam cared so deeply for would finally come in from the wild.  Sam deserved whatever measure of happiness he could find in this world.  Both siblings did.
Dean, of course did not do as he was supposed to.  “Yes, Cas.  I’m sure.”
He returned from his first deliberant human hunt a day later, calm and collected.  Intent on doing this right.  But when he walked in the door and looked his fifteen-year-old son in the eye, Dean flinched from him.  And all that hard-won calm went right out the fucking window.
“You with me?” Dean asked, teasing with his voice, and now his hands as he stroked along Cas naked abdomen.
Home.
“No, of course that’s not what I’m saying,” Castiel protested.
Dean glanced down at the image on the phone with a faint smile, careful not to dislodge the fingers expertly massaging his scalp.  God, he loved head scratchies.
“Hey,” he said politely.  “I’m Sam Winchester; one of the three leaders of Clan Winchester.  Our third, Ellen Harvelle is back at home guarding the pack territory.  That’s my big brother Dean pretending he’s too tough to feel pain.  What’s your name?”
Castiel considered it.  This was so complicated.  It’s a wonder humans managed to successfully breed at all with so many things to consider.
Well, this was a mess and a half.  Sighing, Bobby yanked the decrepit Oldsmobile’s door open with metallic groan of protest and stepped out, waiting for Mr. and Mrs. Allen to emerge from the supermarket.
He nodded once, definitively.  “The Ma’lak box plan is out.  We need to find another way.”
Dean rolled his eyes. As if he’d stray from the pack for that long.  “As I recall, there’s a nice, soft field of clover to the northeast a bit.  I’ll be back in an hour.”
Not to say that his lover was burdened with a similar condition.  Cas’ chest was sticky, dry and itching with evidence that Dean had enjoyed multiple orgasms while riding Castiel into oblivion.  When he’d needed a break, he crawled up Cas’ bound body, sliding his thick erection down Cas throat.
“Let me move,” he begged, struggling against Dean’s grip.  “I need it.  Deeper, please alpha.”
“Do you miss it?” He asked quietly.  “The lost opportunity to bond intimately with your life mate?”
The mammoth flexed his upper arms, grinning viciously.  “I’m gonna break you in half, little man,” he growled.  “Then I’m gonna rip your heart out of your rib cage and offer it to my Alpha on a fancy silver platter.  Then I’m gonna rip off your head and skull fuck it till my jizz pours out of your eye sockets.  We’ll take what’s left of your corpse with us for show and tell when we take over that cute little pack of yours.  It’s almost a shame you won’t be there to see it.”
Dean swore and turned back to the steering wheel.  “I guess you want to ride along on the meet, then?  Say hi to your old pals?”
"Everyone, say ‘hi’ to your new Alpha.”
Dean didn’t trust this version of Castiel with a toothpick, much less his body.  Filled as he was with all the souls of Purgatory, the angel turned Deity was capable of anything.
A shift on the bed marked Cas settling back down beside him, both hands on Dean’s body now, caressing and massaging.  Dean squeezed the pillow under his head, senses on high alert as he listened for the Angel’s next move.  Another flash of heat, and the remainder of his clothing joined his shirt in a pile of ashes on the bed.  Dean winced.  That one, he regretted.  Those had been awesome jeans.
Part II.  Dean remembers, and to everyone's shock and awe, he's pissed.
“Sammy, I’m going to need you to let go of my mate,” Dean warned quietly.  “I ain’t asking.”
Dean Winchester and Castiel reach their climatic moment.
Sam squinted, staring off into the distance.  They were in the heart of Nowhereville, Nebraska, in the middle of a recently plowed hay field of all the stupid places.  But that’s where Deanmon had gotten it into his head to sneak off to, and Sam had dutifully followed.
Cas could have saved all of them a lot of pain and difficulty, hours of arguing with a mule-stubborn Winchester, if he’d just thought of this solution earlier.  It was so obvious in retrospect.
Castiel had spent his life worrying about being claimed against his will by some monstrous Alpha.  But he’d never heard of it happening in reverse.  Trust it to him to be a freak even in this.
“Jesus,” Dean groaned, “buy a guy a drink first.”  His words were a token protest, but his aforementioned abs smoothly rippled, tensing in an effort to shove his ass back to meet Cas’ powerful thrusts.
But for now, he took another, deeper lap at that sweet hole, loving the sounds Dean made for him nearly as much as the taste of eager omega.  He pressed his face in deep, tongue fucking Dean’s eager asshole.  He’d never really appreciated not requiring oxygen as much as he did at this moment.  It allowed him to take his time and enjoy the taste of his partner as much as he desired.
Dean silently watched as Cas moved his hand, placing his splayed palm on Dean’s sternum, heat building as the hand began to glow with a cool blue light.  The Angel slid his hand in a midline strip down the length of his chest in a smooth move, the contact touched with a kiss of heat, followed by the cool rush of air against bare skin.  Good thing he wasn’t particularly fond of that shirt, Dean thought as the burnt remnants of fabric fell away.  Though that had been one of his newer ones, he thought ruefully, watching the particles flitter onto the bedspread.
A lean, fit female alpha stepped forward, removing her helmet.  She had short-cropped blonde hair framing a stern face with cornflower blue eyes and pixie features.
Dean parked the jeep in front of one of the houses, tossing the keys to a waiting packmate as he climbed out.  Sam and Ellen both followed.
Castiel leaned forward, planting soft kisses and warm licks down his neck, nipping at the hot spot just above his clavicle.  Dean rumbled with pleasure at the dual sensations, relaxing into it as he allowed Castiel to take what he needed.
He walked back into the cabin to find Sam in roughly the same place, still digging around on the laptop.  It was just as well that Meg was currently in the wind.  Mood he was in, he’d put the demon blade through the bitch’s chest on principle.
“Alright, Cas.  Spill.”
Jody joined the brothers, and Castiel realized she wore a shoulder holster as well as what appeared to be a sheathed bowie knife clipped to her belt.   She nodded at whatever Dean said before striding to one of the trucks and nimbly crawling atop the covered crates and settling in.  Someone handed a shotgun up to her once she was situated.
He struggled now, pushing against Dean’s hold.  Dean applied more pressure, using his body weight to help hold the wriggling x-angel down.  Frustrated, Cas lunged up and caught Dean’s lips in a fierce kiss.
Enough of this.  Cas needed more from the hunter then a few kisses.  He’d almost lost him, and in the worst possible way.  He wouldn’t even have the peace of knowing Dean was in heaven, something he’d counted on in the past when he’d thought his friend and lover gone from the world.
Namoi stared down at the unconscious body of one her most elite soldiers.  She looked up to meet Dean Winchester’s uncompromising, if somewhat glassy-eyed, stare.
“One eighth a piece of a unicorn’s horn, as agreed,” Sam told her sourly.
“Keep staring, I might do a trick,” Dean told him leaning sharply to the side to snag one of the beers from Sam’s hand.
“Admiring your work?” he asked, amused.  There was no point in being annoyed.  One didn’t fuck an Apex Alpha if they weren’t prepared for a prestigious amount of marking.   And Dean had certainly left his share of his own marks on Cas’ body during their time together.
“Easy, Dean.  Not poaching, I promise. I just smelled blood and I was worried about our packmate.”
He stepped fully out onto the roof, softly closing the hatch behind him.  Directly overhead, a half moon filled the Kansas sky, bathing his surroundings in its benign glow.  Something deep inside him quieted as a cool breeze ran teasing fingers through his hair, mussing the dark strands.  This was right.  This was where he was supposed to be.
Sam moved to the swinging porch chair, sipping tea and looking up at a black night filled to bursting with stars.  The air was brisk, but not yet freezing.  The hint of a cold snap only just touched the air, but he could smell it coming in the wind.  He made a mental note to make sure they were stocked for a hard winter frost.
He put the word out that he was unavailable; only the one’s he was close with, or the truly desperate, managed to reach him. But it was enough to stay busy.  More importantly, he looked busy enough to settle Dean’s concerns. Damn mother hen.  Bobby supposed that’s just what happens to a person when they have to become a father by age twelve.
Dean clenched his fists and held on as best he could.  “Cas, man.  It’s been a while, here.  I know my control is legendary, but I’m just a man.  Either slow down or I’m gonna pop sooner than you probably want.”
Dean leaned down, pressing his face into his mate, snuffling softly at the base of his neck.  His tongue delicately licked across the fresh bite mark.  Cas closed his eyes, shuddering softly.  Heat flared in his groin, need tighening his abdomen.
Dean fights.  He likes that kind of thing.  He's not overly fond of what follows.
They crested the hill and walked around back.  A log framed fire pit was already laid out and ready for flame.
Cas closed and relaxed into the attention.  “Is it always like this with you?”  He asked languidly.
If it weren’t for the horrifically bright sun beating down on them, he might have actually enjoyed himself.  The ride was far gentler than he’d anticipated, and the cool breeze dispelled the day’s heat.
While the vehicles had all clearly seen better days, their chipped, faded paint slowly losing the battle with the elements, each roared to life readily, the engines purring smoothly.
“This victory is yours.  Do you want to exercise your right to take his life?”
“Dean,” Cas growled into the Hunter’s talented mouth.  “Shut. Up.”
Castiel gets a feel for his new packmates as they journey homeward.  Dean is crabbby, Sam is Sam.  And my favorite Redhead joins the party.  This chapter is a little dry, I won't lie.  But we have to get from point A to B.
Castiel wasn’t sure what to make of that.  He and Dean weren’t ‘boyfriends’ as far as he knew the term to mean.  They had made no promises to each other and Dean was still having frequent sex with women.  Though, Castiel had not noted him ‘picking up’ a male since they’d been sexually intimate.  Did that mean something to humans?
“Anyone care how it looks can come have a nice talk with me,” Dean said.
“Anyway, while he was in the hospital getting treated for shock I went looking for something that might help.  Skuttlebutt has it is you are looking for the unexplainable.  Well, I found it.”
Jo grimaced.  “Halos.  A whole gang of them.  I’ve never seen so many in one place.  We don’t have a damn clue what they want.  But at the moment they’re waiting at the border, so we’re going out nice and friendly.”
Oh, Dean.  We never should have dragged you out of Rocky’s.  You deserved whatever measure of peace you could find.  But they’d needed him.  And Dean never once took the easy way out.  He would never have forgiven them for leaving him to the dream.
It was only once Dean had reduced Cas to the point of sobbing (the first time of many) that he’d finally sank slowly onto the x-angel’s cock, taking his time, stretching himself slowly over Cas’ length rather than prepping himself with fingers or one of the several toys available to him.
“I hope you didn’t have any plans for the rest of the week,” Cas commented idly.
Dean was not in a good mood.  It was too fucking early, yesterday’s coffee tasted like deep fried, half-ground rat’s ass, and he was stupidly sore.  The previous evening’s midnight romp in the clover may have been good for him in all kinds of ways, but it sure did a number on his injuries.
“First things first; are you thinking your special friend is a top or bottom?”
The cock filling mouth throbbed as he slid his lips along the shaft, taking it slightly deeper with each glide until his nose was tapping pelvis.  His tongue slid along the under side, stroking the vein as he did a slow pull, backing away until he slid off entirely.
“That’s good.  We have classes back home if you want training.  Or just want someone to spar with.”
Next time.
Daisy-Ann was about as ruthless a hunter as he’d ever come across.  Five foot nothing, with warm, innocent brown eyes and a guileless smile, you never saw her coming until you had a knife pokin’ out from your gullet.  He still had memories of clearing out a couple of vamps with her, when he’d finally seen her genuine smile for the first time.  It wasn’t something a man just forgot.
She laughed.  “Don’t I wish?  That was a good time, yeah?  Glory years.”  She sighed.   “But that’s not why I’m calling.  I put a werewolf down, just south of Cheyenne a little bit ago.  Turns out the damn thing had a mate.  She tracked us down last week.”
“I’ll pass.”
Rising silently, he untied the tent flap and leaned out.  He took a deep breath, scenting the wind for a hint of what had set off his subconscious alerts.
Sweet Mother Moon, he smelled delicious.  Like new leather and fresh tobacco, with just a hint of honeysuckle.  Castiel couldn’t help but take another intense inhalation, drawing that luscious scent in and holding it close.
Using two hands simultaneously proved beyond him.  The Halo soldier gave up on holding the glass, instead using his right hand alone to lift the bottle, pouring a thin stream of clear liquid several inches to the left of his goal.  Without so much as a whimper, Gadreel’s eyes rolled to the back of his head; the bottle falling from his nerveless grip as he toppled to the ground.
He paused, listening intently for the sounds of his pursuer.  Just before he turned down a narrow hall passage to the left, he froze.  Dean didn’t hear anything, but unlike him, Cas hadn’t had the opportunity to fill the bunker with his scent.
Dean pounded up the steps one of the larger cabins that smelled of something delicious.  “Yo!  Pack me up three meals to go would, ya?”
“Prude,” the man sitting next to him commented loudly at the retreating woman’s back.   He rolled his eyes, turning to face Castiel with a smile.
Purple hair licked her lips.  The hand on his balls moved up, cupping the hard ridge of his cock and stroking.  Dean groaned, thrusting into the touch.
Castiel considered that.  A feral Dean Winchester pouncing on him, working all that wild aggression out on his body in a rush of unbridled, animalistic sex.  He wasn’t sure whether he was intruiged or nervous.  Maybe both.
Dean laughed, the sound choked off when Cas shoved his tongue into the other man’s mouth, the kiss messy and rough.  Just the way they both liked it.
Magog pulled himself upright, turning around just in time to see the blade Dean had scooped from the ground flying at his face.  Before the giant of a man could react, Dean struck, the blade neatly separating the giant’s head from his shoulders, sending it rolling across the dirt ring.
She raised an eyebrow.  “Back to the silent treatment, already?  Relax.  I’m in charge of armaments.  That’s why I’m asking.  If you don’t have a weapon, you need one.  It’s rough out here for anybody, and downright stupid for an omega alone.  Especially one kicking out heat pheromones the way you are.”
“I’m sorry for causing so much trouble,” Castiel began, only to be interrupted when Sam wrapped his tree trunk arms around him in a massive bear hug.
“Are you alright, Dean?”  The innocent tone was so laced with smug that Dean decided he had to do something about it.  He was not going to be the only one falling apart in this damn parking lot, and he absolutely was not going to come in his pants two minutes in like some green teenager.
Castiel grumbled to himself as he curled back up in his blanket.  He was well aware that he wasn’t being remotely rational.  Dean had smelled him, read his clearly defensive body language, and responded appropriately to the very obvious ‘go away’ message.
Dean passed the flask to Sam.  He took a deep gulp, eyes thoughtful.  Sam glanced over at his brother, the two apparently having an entire conversation wordlessly.
“I figured it was something along those lines,” Sam replied cautiously.  “But since you obvious didn’t want to talk about it, I never asked.”
“Not really.”  Cas turned to look at him. “I have no interest in Sam falling down on top of me.”
Yet. They’d found nothing yet.  They would.  They always did.  It was just a matter of price.  And one way or another they’d pay it.  Dean just hoped it would be his burden this time instead of Sam’s.  His little brother needed a break from the shit show.
“Fifteen, twenty minutes.  Better get comfy.”
Cas narrowed his gaze, the lost look fading as something far darker emerged in response to the hunter’s teasing laughter.  Without warning, he slid a hand between them, slipping nimble fingers into the waistband of Dean’s pants, stroking along the firm cock he found there.
“It looks like I’m needed.  You good?”
Wait?  Wasn't smut promised in this story?  Destiel smut, at that.  Well, if you insist.
“What the hell have you done?” Sam demanded harshly.  But he wasn’t talking to Cas.  He was looking past him, gazing over the omega’s shoulder towards the house.
“I cannot believe you never told me,” Dean muttered.  Castiel stiffened.  The alpha was plenty angry, sure, but he sounded a little hurt too.  That was the last thing Cas wanted.
Cas leapt, nimbly landing atop the eight-foot high hay bale in a single jump.
“You take care of yourself, Castiel.  Enjoy the vacation while you can.  I have a feeling the world ain’t near done with you, yet.”
“No.  You talked.  I listened.  And because what you said was stupid, I chose to ignore it.”
Dean flipped him an appropriately vulgar hand gesture before heading towards camp.  Sam grinned fondly at his brother’s back, watching Dean trot down the hill, presumably to hang his soaked clothes next to the lingering flames of the fire pit.
“Let’s see, whose next.  Avoid this one, he’s an ass.  This one thinks he’s a sex god but blows his load in the first 30 seconds….oh, now this one is interesting.  She can do this thing with her tongue…”
“How about you?” Dean asked, a little too carefully.  “Any weird dreams?”
Ellen stepped out of the jeep, leaning casually against the hood.  Reaching into a coat pocket she pulled a weathered flask and took a hearty swallow.  Partially to calm her nerves, sure, but mostly in an attempt to wash the bad taste out of this whole thing from her mouth.
Ellen turned and walked away, Dean pacing beside her.  “I need details.”
“It won’t,” Dean replied sourly.  “After a certain point, ruts can’t be denied.  You screw or you burn up until it kills you.  Not sure how that jives with your Angel mojo, but with that spell on board I’m not inclined to risk it.”
Dean’s head rested in the lap of a lovely pixie-cut blonde, her loose, pink button down shirt more than spacious enough for him to peer up at her amazing, double D attributes.  The young lady’s long, elegant fingers massaged his scalp, fingering through the silky strands in clear delight.  Naturally. His hair was awesome.  He was willing to indulge her; he was generous that way.
Taking that promise to heart, Cas settled into the bed, content to wait as Dean swiftly began disrobing him, working the small buttons of his shirt open, pulling his tie free and tossing it aside.
Castiel had thought he was sure.  But with that one minor demonstration he knew with certainty that it was actually the exact opposite.  His reaction to a scenting alone fiercely tested his waning control.  If he was unbound, and a willing Dean stood before him… there would be no stopping his urges.
Dean saw quite a few arms bearing the trademark brand of the Black-Eyed Pack spread out among the group.  The Black-Eyes were Crowley’s old pack; no one knew why he’d left, but it was known there was no love lost between them.  But now Crowley ran the betting.  Then he’d taken over the market, and the auctions.  To all intents and purposes he and his new crew ruled Persephone.  The Blackeyed bastards wouldn’t dare step out of line as long as he was around.
Although that last part may be more effective than he’d given credit to, Sam reflected, glancing over to his left side at the Angel perched on the truck’s edge.  An angel whose intense gaze was fixed with laser precision on the scene in progress a half mile or so from their current location.
Dean pulled out a thin, black buckle-style strap with a heavy rounded patch at its center.  It looked vaguely like a giant sized eye patch.  But it wasn’t.  Dean smirked.  He wished he could have been a fly on the wall when Sam had bought that.
Dean parked the jeep and hopped out, Sam looming at his side. When Cas made to get out as well Dean sent a sharp gesture at him to stay put.  Fine.  For now.
Dean’s brain instantly fried.  Before he could get it back online, Cas had gracefully slid to his knees and was industriously working away at Dean’s jean zipper.  His other hand returned to Dean’s ass, taking a firm grip and pulling him forward so that he could slide the jeans down to his knees, catching the elastic hem of his boxers while he was at it.
Dean leaned against the wall and folded his arms across his chest.  The casual pose was incredibly sexy and Cas had to force his attention off the way the position beautifully emphasized the musculature of Dean’s arms, forcing his gaze to the man’s face.
“Jo,” Castiel acknowledged cautiously.
And it was only then that Dean had truly started on him in ernest.
The alpha was naked from the waist up, his wet skin gleaming in the soft moonlight.  The beams seemed drawn to him, caressing each graceful curve of hard muscle.  The fading firelight cast a flickering dance of shadows against his moon-pale skin.
“I don’t believe so,” Emmanuel replied, looking faintly troubled.  “I usually remember every face I come across in exact detail.”
Dean shrugged.  “I always make sure my partners are satisfied before we’re done.  Particularly if I’m working an omega through their heat.”
Dean slid Cas’ legs over his shoulders and raised him up.  This new position allowed the alpha easier access.  He wasted no time in plunging three fingers deep inside while his tongue glided along the edge of his dripping hole.
“Dean?” Cas asked after a while.   He tugged his warm blanket tighter against his body.
“Hey Hot Stuff, come here often?” Dean asked the bikers, smirking at them suggestively.
“Cas,” Dean muttered, his body shuddering below Cas' own.  He stopped fighting, giving in to the Angel’s demanding hands on his body.  “Please.”
Castiel wasn’t sure what either of those things was, but Sebastian seemed infinitely more knowledgeable than an obstinate screen that blinked at him.
Fuck it.
-------
Sam responded to Dean’s relaxed posture, his shoulders sagging slightly as he also went off battle mode.
“Ellen,” he replied.  He graced her with a flirty, teasing smile that lit up a stunning face.  She was suddenly very glad she’d left Jo back at camp. The poor girl wouldn’t have stood a chance.
Dean chuckled.  “More or less.  Look, you’re hard to read, man.  Sometimes it looks like you’re checking me out, or you could be angelically counting my pulse.  I don’t know.  So, here it is: are you interested in me or not? Sexually,” he clarified.  It was always best to be crystal clear with Castiel.
The pack didn’t dawdle, and a half hour later they were back in motion.  It was well past dark before they stopped again, this time to camp for the night.  Now that he knew what to expect, Castiel got out of the way and watched as the camp was efficiently set up.  A small fire made, bedrolls passed out, while the designated cook dumped dried meat and veggies into a large pot over the fire, tossing a homemade sachet of spices in to the mix.  Surprisingly, it made for a very decent meal, and before he knew it, Castiel was comfortably full, tucked into a bedroll between several of his packmates.  As with the night before, he surprised himself by quickly falling asleep.
“You won’t have to much longer.  Dean will be back a few minutes and I’m leaving, “ Sam replied.  “Just, promise me something.  Even with the cuffs you have dangerous strength.  If Dean gets hurt, don’t ask, just heal him.”  Sam was fairly confident that between his fairly large brother and Cas, there would be some degree of damage.  Those two burned hot around each other even without their dual-sides running the show.  The next few days would be fairly epic.
His arms were still pinned up behind his head by the cuffs linked to the heavy chain, but the metal appeared very tight, straining against the pressure being applied to it.
“I want to. I earned it. I need it.  Let me go, Sam.”
And she dared to hope.
Castiel smiled at his Alpha.  “Good night.”  He rose, making his way back to his house.  He was truly was exhausted.  And he felt lighter, like he may actually be able to rest.
Dean stiffened at the accusatory tone, standing straighter.  At fifteen, the seeds of stubborn rebellion were beginning to really set in.  And Dean was John’s son through and through.  The boy may strive to please his father, but he would never be a doormat, either.  Something John tended to forget.
Sam glared at him.  “Dean, look around.  Everyone in town is here to see this fight.  Including our guys.”
Groans filled the ring at his pronouncement.  “You heard the man,” Crowley announced.  “My lads will be coming along directly to collect any wagers due me.”
-------------------
Cas didn’t want easy.  He wanted to thrust into his omega, split him open and own him.   His grace flashed, crashing against the solid wall of the cuffs, only to be thwarted again.  Growling, he gathered himself and thrust up the moment he felt the head of his cock slid into hot wetness of Dean’s body.  Dean hissed, falling forward as Cas buried himself a good three quarters of the way into his hole all at once.
Cas scowled at the unhidden amusement in the bright green eyes that met his over the top of the paper, hopping into the car without saying a word and crossing his arms over his chest.  He maintained his stony silence for duration of the short car ride to the local bbq joint that Dean had chosen for them.  Castiel had actually heard of the establishment before; it was said to be renowned for its flavorful sauces and particularly tender meat.
“Is Dean back, then?”
“Now,” he groaned out through clenched teeth a few breaths later, nudging the Alpha with his heels.
“My name is Castiel,” Castiel said.
A red glint ghosted in Dean’s eyes at the implied threat.  Castiel reached over, running a soothing hand down his mate’s arm.  The red hue faded.
Cas gasped.  “Dean.  I’m loose enough.  More than enough.  I need you inside me.”
She moved on.  “Now, Benny’s a solid choice.  Nice and easygoing, non-threatening, but plenty alpha where it counts.” She gave a little groin thrust as a visual aid.  “If you’re wanting a nice, thick knot in a big ol’ sweet-talking, teddy bear shaped package he’s the way to go.”
There was nothing but truth and a healthy dose of annoyance in Dean’s voice.  He slid off Cas’ chest, careful not tug too hard at the delicate flesh linking them at the hip, and threw a leg over his Cas' thighs, cuddling close.  Cas sighed in relief, setting his concerns aside so he too could ‘bask’ in the moment.  Dean was by his side, safe, content, and the spell appeared to be quiescent.
Turning from his brother’s worried gaze, Dean let the feral grin he’d been suppressing slide across his features.  It had been far too long since his inner beast had been let off the chain; he desperately needed this.
It seemed like that would be callous on Sam’s part, but then Castiel didn’t always get the brother’s peculiar social interactions.  He’d come to the understanding that the Winchesters had a very strange way of showing love and accepted it.
Dean glared at the shot glass in his hand, looking distinctly betrayed.  He closed his eyes, let out a deep breath, and knocked it back.  Behind him, the small group of spectators cheered.
But this wasn’t something Sam would ever be able understand, not really.  He couldn’t.  It was a matter of simple genetics.  Some folk had it and some… did not.  And Sam was mercifully out of that particular loop.
Sam smiled affectionately.  Coming around the table he reached out, clapping Dean on the shoulder.  “I’m happy for you, big brother.  You did good.”
“Alphas,” Dean rumbled.  “Always with the orders.  Patience, Angel.”
“Was I in any way unclear, or do you both need your ears boxed for ya?” She demanded, letting her Alpha show through her eyes.  She had no time for this crap.
And what would he live for?  Stuck in a forced mating, even if it was completely his fault?  Living the rest of his life the way he’d always feared, always carrying the guilt for committing the worst of atrocities?
Sam snorted.  “And you look daisy fresh?”
While the two had become steady friends, frequently going on camping hunts or even border town trading points once in a while (but never Persephone, Dean had forbidden it and Cas hadn’t bothered arguing with a decision he agreed with), Castiel always made a point to stay far away from Dean near the start of his cycle.   The Alpha always obliged the unspoken request, tending to disappear for several days just before Castiel’s heat came to the fore.
Ellen pulled out her flask, taking a long drink.  The Roadhouse had been a stopping point for locals and travelers for the better part of thirty years.  A place to wash the dust off, have a meal and a drink or three, maybe do a little discreet business if one were so inclined.  Chat up old acquaintances, catch up on rumors, and maybe spread one or two.
“Daisy-Ann.  Been a while.  You sound awful cheerful, girl.  You standing on a fresh ghoul corpse or something?”
Uncomfortable on multiple levels, Dean sat up, rubbing his eyes clear with a forearm. A bare one. Right.  Shirt.  He’d need that.  He rose unsteadily to his feet, bracing one arm against the impala to stay upright.
Dean growled at her.  She winked back, smiling enticingly.  Her smell said she was totally interested in a romp if he was.  Reluctantly, Dean abandoned the chance of a good after-fight lay.  He had an encampment full of twitchy pack mates and an abrasive omega to see to.
More than a few folk carried the iconic blades at their left hip declaring them members of Clan Halo.  Unusual, that.  They were a smaller pack, but one of the fiercest, and very secretive.  Halos were rovers, not prone to staying in one place for long.  They were legendary fighters, feared above nearly all others.  It was decidedly unusual seeing more than one or two in town at once.
Dean rumbled violently in warning.  “Let go of me, Sammy.  MINE.  My kill.”
As if summoned by magic, Crowley rose from his chair atop the dais, looking towards the prize corral, as did the rest of the newly quieted crowd.
Cas wasn’t sure whether Dean meant his job as a hunter or taking care of Sam.  Both were interwoven in the core of Dean’s character.
“Wow.  Lucky me,” Dean muttered, not even pretending to miss the implicit meaning in the Angel’s proprietary touch.
He knew Cas had sensed his acceptance, because he slowed down the pace, began to take his time to nuzzle and lick and enjoy.  A sharp bite at Dean’s inner thigh and he knew he’d be sporting a deep purple mark there for days.
Chuckling at his bossy soon-to-be-mate, Dean pulled out to the tip and slammed back with his full strength, forcing a grunt out of the omega. The power of his thrust was so strong it sent Cas sliding forward and he had to scramble to get his hands against the wall to keep from hitting his head.
Castiel raised an eyebrow.  Blowjobs were happening, no matter what.  But a challenge had been issued.  And Castiel hated to lose.
Cas made his way to the kitchen. The two Winchester brothers were both seated at the table, plates of food, a few bottles of beer, and covered dishes spread out across its surface.  From what Castiel could make out as he came in, they were discussing safe topics, pack matters, reminiscing about shared memories and the like.  Both Alphas appeared calm.  This was much better.
“Please,” Cas tried, reaching up to grip Dean’s ass with both hands.
“Time to move up to my A game, I guess,” Dean commented absently.  implying that all this had merely been his B game? What else could he possibly…
“I didn’t mean to do it.  I…wasn’t thinking.  At all,” Castiel told him, desperate that his Alpha, his friend, know he’d never deliberately…but then he kind of had.
Dean didn’t give a hot crap about any of that; his pack was not allowed to bet with anyone but each other.  Ordinarily Crowley would object to such 'insider trading' as he called it, but the wily Alpha left their betting alone as long as the Winchesters slipped him a bottle of Hunter’s Helper on the regular.  The moonshine was a secret pack recipe and the primary export for the pack.  The Winchester pack did very well for themselves.
The door slammed behind them and Cas spun in Dean’s arms, pressing his erection into Dean’s hip and grinding just this side of painful.  Dean growled, one hand cupping the back of Cas’ head, pulling him in for a kiss.  An agile tongue slid between Castiel’s lips, demanding he open for his alpha.
Sam rolled his eyes.  “Next time stay under longer.”
He felt Cas smiling into the kiss when Dean finally caved and became an active participant, the angel’s hands sliding down his back and inside the waistline of his jeans, grabbing a generous helping of ass.  Cas’ agile lips slowly made their way down the side of his face to Dean’s neck, nibbling along the sensitive nerve path with a gentle graze of teeth.  Dean closed his eyes and lifted his chin, baring his neck fully.  He groaned when the hint of teeth sharpened into a bite.  He relaxed into it, enjoying the sharp burst of pleasure when Castiel began to not so gently suck.
Sam heard the sound of the passenger door open as Cas roughly stowed his brother in the passenger seat.  “Easy tiger,” Dean complained, though his tone was relaxed, lazy even.  “I’m all about the rough handling, but give a man a few minutes to recover.”
“That’s all you had to do, ask me nicely,” Dean growled over the  rhythmic sound of his balls wetly slapping against Cas’ ass.  “But instead, you had to be stubborn,”
“And you don’t remember anything that happened to you while Michael possessed you?” Sam asked, for 9th time.  Castiel had been counting; he had accepted a bet with Mary.
Sam glanced back and fourth between the two of them.  He knew something was up, if not what.  It was a true mark of Sam’s patient nature that he didn’t demand answers.  Dean would never have been capable of such discretion.
“Next time, you could just hop in with me.  Not that I’m opposed to putting on a show from time to time, but trust me on this, interactive is always better.”
After a few minutes of Cas moving in him, Dean’s body responded in the predictable way.  Cas had learned to be a fairly skilled lover and without even bothering to try, he’d managed to press a number of Dean’s buttons.  His cock, trapped between his body and the rough sheets was getting just enough friction to keep things interesting, though Dean had no intention of actually letting go.  Cas could fuck him into next Tuesday if that was what he wanted, but no way in hell was Dean going to give up an orgasm for him.
Castiel woke to soft murmurs and the thrum of activity around him as the Winchester Pack rose with the chilly dawn.  Sleepy faces muttered at one another, frequently punctuated with variously pitched growls, clutching dented tins of steaming brew as they went about their assigned tasks.
Sam nodded.  “Be careful.”
Naomi shrugged.  “Here is as good a place as any.  And there’s no time like the present.”  The halos formed a wide half circle, the elegant maneuver perfectly executed without a sound. It was designed to be extremely creepy, and they'd succeeded masterfully.  Dean stepped forward.
Cas slid his fingers out and immediately slid the full length of his cock into his lover.  Whatever issues Jimmy Novak and his wife had during their marriage, sexual satisfaction was unlikely to have been one of them.  His vessel was more then adequately proportioned.  Though Castiel had noticed the last time he’d been rebuilt, that he seemed to have been made even larger between the legs.  He’d wondered at the time why his heavenly Father had bothered making an angel so well endowed.
“That’s just swell, Cas.  Good for you.  Take a vacation from all the smiting.  I hear Maui is nice this time of year,” Dean told him.  “Have a mai tai or ten.”
Dean stood at the counter empty handed, hadn’t even bothered with the superficial motions of finding items to purchase.  And he wore that same toothy smile as the last time he’d appeared at Cas’ register, the one that always guaranteed trouble.   What instinct Cas had left to him kicked in and he eyed the Hunter warily.
Sam was accustomed to being the smartest person in the room; it grated him when he didn’t understand what was happening.  Dean was fine with that.  He’d never been anything but proud of his brother’s intellect.  Well, occasionally annoyed, but mostly proud.
Next time, Dean had said.  That had been an invitation; Castiel was almost certain of it.  Dean really did shower a lot.  It would be so easy to shed the clothing covering his own body and step into the hot water with the hunter.  Raise his hands and touch the heated flesh; see if it was as smooth and firm as he remembered.
“Yo, Dean!”
Sliding up until he was mere inches away, Dean made sure to hold Castiel's gaze while taking a deep, deliberate inhalation.  Cas’ pupils instantly dilated and his entire body grew taut in response to being scented, confirming what Dean’s heavily suppressed second nature had been trying to tell him at him all along.
“Dean? Dean, are you okay? Dean, I’m sorry.  Please talk to me.”
“I might,” Cas answered distantly, his attention elsewhere.  “I’m keeping my options open.”
It was too quiet, the sounds of Dean’s harsh breathing overloud in the otherwise silent room.
“I need an answer, here, man.”
Cas sighed, setting his fork down.  “I understand.  And I heartily approve of that law.”  He looked at his mate.  Dean minutely shook his head ‘no’, anticipating what Castiel was about to divulge.  Tough.
The Fifth Ring was newly vacant, the smell of old blood and sour sweat mixed in the freshly churned dirt filled his nostrils as the pit tenders nobly attempted to rake the dirt into some semblance of even ground.  Their actions stirred up too many scents.  Wrinkling his nose, Dean turned away.
Castiel had been alive for a very, very long time.  Eons, possibly more. Time as a construct was fairly new, cosmically speaking.
He leaned back, his smile a little more crooked and a lot more genuine.  “Life,” he replied with a shrug.  She realized that Dean knew exactly what he was, and accepted it.  It nearly broke her heart.
Dean leaned in and nuzzled against his neck.  “C’mon Cas.  Agree to be mine, for always.  We can spend the rest of our lives bickering over every little fucking thing.”
“You okay, there, buddy?” Dean asked, swallowing a bit to give his throat a break.
How could he live under the same roof with the person he loved above all else, knowing he wasn’t loved back? That it was all a lie?
Ah.  That made sense. They were finally making progress.
Her body language was very dominant, but that didn’t necessarily mean anything.  He’d learned not to make role-based assumptions around here.  A cursory scenting told him she was almost certainly beta.
Just another fun filled day in the life of Dean Winchester, he thought with dark humor.  Pulling up the sheet around his waist, he went back to sleep.
“Dean’s injured.  Down an arm and several ribs are cracked.   We need to replace him on patrol for the next two weeks, minimum.”
“What? Don’t be fucking stupid.  It’s not about that damn bite.  I love you, you moron.  You think I’m just gonna shrug that off like an old overcoat?’
“I have Deanmon,” Castiel announced unnecessarily.  Dean raised an eyebrow, apparently amused by the title.  “We should get him back to the Bunker so we can start the ritual.  He will be much more cooperative this time around.”
“Dean…I’m sorry.”
Chapter 2
“Try and touch my mate and I’ll break both your arms,” Dean commented, casually taking a sip from his beer.
He didn’t know why he’d never told Sam, or anyone else about what they’d been up to.  He was hardly ashamed.  Dean was a self-pronounced horn dog and Castiel’s vessel was stupid pretty.  Dean wasn’t one to judge how consenting adults chose to get off; screwing the angel didn’t evoke any strong moral issues for him.
Cas appeared, walking calmly beside him as if he’d been there all along.  He might have been, for all Dean knew.  There wasn’t much method to Cas’ madness these days.  He handed Dean a beer, one of Dean’s preferred brands.  He was quite sure they didn’t have any in the cabin.  Or the state, for that matter.  Eh.  Gift horses.
He wasn’t sure how long they stayed that way, Dean energetically riding his cock, the bare skin of his chest and neck sweat-slicked and red with exertion.  Cas hoisted himself into a partial sit, tensing his abs to hold the pose, licking and nipping at whatever flesh he could reach.  If only he had use of his hands, he’d grab his mate, roll him onto his back and fuck him into the sweetest oblivion.  But this was a more than satisfactory compromise.
“Sure thing, Dean,” a voice called back brightly.
“I’m going to fuck you so hard,” Dean murmured, nibbling at his neck.  His hips continued to smoothly thrust that thick cock between Castiel's cheeks.  His hole clenched in need.  His was so empty.  He desperately needed his mate to fill him, knot him.
“Roll over, darlin’.  We’re doing it right this time.”
Of course, one whiff of this place and his brother would drop supplies at the door and beat a hasty exit, most likely spend the night camping far on the other side of the territory.
Whatever Dean was thinking about, it must be a pleasant thought; Castiel reflected.  Dean had a slight smile his face, green eyes sparkling with some inner knowledge.  As if there was a joke in there somewhere that only Dean was privy to.
Sam took after their father, no matter how much he might try to deny it.  And John Winchester had been a norm through and through.
Sam glanced over at his pack mate.  Frowning at Benny, he turned back and reached out to place a hand on his brother’s arm.  “Dean,” he said, sinking an entire conversation into the one word.
“So, boyfriend, huh?  Of course you’d be taken.  Can’t blame a guy for wondering.”  Sebastian winked.
Cas dropped his eyes in remembered shame.
Dean’s den also felt completely different.  As with any Alpha home, Castiel could sense Dean’s presence well before entering, but it wasn’t remotely uncomfortable.  Instead, the Alpha pheromones permeating the area felt protective, calming.
-----------------------------
“You need to speak to me about something?” Cas asked, unsure where this was going.
A gentle breeze teased along his senses, and Dean caught Benny’s distinctive sent somewhere mixed in with the crowd, watching his back as always.  Dean scanned the cue of potential fighters, the low-key buzz of adrenaline sending thrums of anticipation through his body.
Castiel’s hips moved faster, rutting blindly against the bedspread, his orgasm chasing Dean’s.  It was the work of a moment until he was spilling onto the bed.
“I…I have no idea,” Cas stuttered.  “I’m sorry? It was an accident.  I don’t know what came over me?”
Ellen glanced over to where Jo crouched by the kid’s tent, idly flipping her dagger.  That blade was the last memory the girl had of her father.  Ellen’s mate had always been handy with a blade.  Not that it did him any good in the end.
Sam rolled his eyes.  “Jody is back guarding the trucks.  I pity anyone dumb enough to try to steal supplies from her.  Not to mention Jo.”
Dean shrugged.  “I like ‘em just fine.  You want pups?  We’ll raise a whole damn litter together.  If you don’t want to, I have a whole pack full wanting my attention.  Either way, I’m happy.”
Dean closed the door, pausing a bit before turning to face Castiel.
The newly combined pack thrived under its triumvirate.  It was Ellen who provided the secret recipe to Hunter’s Helper, and she and Dean dedicated years to perfecting the pack's trademark moonshine.
Castiel hadn’t been assigned any kind of buddy or anything, so made his own way in the direction of water.  He wasn’t sure exactly where it was, but he figured it couldn’t be that difficult to find.
“You aren’t wrong,” she replied.  “Mind if I sit with you?”
A heavy motorcycle with a trailer in tow was headed down the road towards them at a slow pace, a bike pacing evenly on either side.   All three bikes were emblazoned with the black wings of Clan Halo.  Sam waited warily, a dozen guards fanning out at his back.
Dean hesitated.  “However.  There’s been a bit of a snafu.  Cas did do something to me.  Apparently his Alpha didn’t like being the only one out of his gourd.”
Castiel remembered the one remarkable taste he’d had of this human with crystal clarity.  Even one had been far too much.  If angels could become addicted, his drug of choice was surely Dean Winchester.
Guarding and dispensing weapons was his current assignment, though he eventually planned to take charge of one the hunting parties.  He had the skill, but it would take time to develop the trust needed to assume a lead.  He’d barely been with the pack a year; he’d get there.
Ellen played with her bread.  “My pack was never super wealthy.  The Roadhouse was all we had.  But raiders targeted us last season, and they never really stopped coming.  Lately it’s been bad.”
Dean stumbled to his feet and backed unsteadily away, leaning heavily against the jeep for support.  His body shook from a combination of adrenaline, rage, and far, far too much alcohol.
Castiel had gone very still, probably analyzing what was going on within his vessel.
Dean growled, a deep, ominous rumble.  All voices in the clearing instantly went silent.  The Alpha glared at his people, a dangerous glint shimmering across his retinas.  Several of the closest pack members took a few wary steps back.
Brave man.  Or stupid.  Daisy may be pretty, but Bobby wouldn’t bed down with that she-hyena for a dragon’s nest worth of gold.

“Is that right?” Dean asked as he walked back into the room.  He strode up to Cas and slid his wrist in front of the bound angel’s face.
Jesus, that tone.  It nearly took Dean over the edge right there.  It took every ounce of his hard earned self-control to let go of his cock and hold tight against the orgasm that threatened to blow through him.  Settling back on his heels, Dean focused on staying relaxed and letting Cas take the wheel.  He quickly lost track of time, lost in the immediate here and now of a hard cock sliding fiercely in and out of his mouth, going deep with each thrust.
Castiel wasn’t sure what had Sebastian so excited, but if he was thinking matrimony, Castiel wasn’t certain that interspecies marriages were actually a thing.  And he really didn’t think Dean was the marrying type, anyway.
Dean turned back to his opponent.  The man had turned red with rage, his ears all but steaming.  Well, that worked even better than he’d hoped.  Magog was good and fluffed now.
Deanmon.  A moniker Sam had instantly despised, but Rowena had coined it and for whatever damn reason, Castiel had started using it.  So now that was a thing.   Wonderful.
He purged what scratches and bite marks he found until Dean’s skin was once again that of a scarred lifelong-Hunter, taking care to leave the pale, thin scar laterally along his neck completely alone.
“What?  Heavens no.  Richard and I parted ways years ago.  He couldn’t handle the bloodshed, the big sissy.  So I upgraded.  Jason is his cousin.  Neither one can hunt worth a damn, but Jason is pretty great with the books, ya know?  And much more creative between the sheets.”
Dean laughed, he actually laughed, sounding brighter than Castiel could remember from him.
Sam shrugged.  “Not a problem.”
John had to force himself to ask the next question.  “Tell me he wore a condom.  That you did that much to stay safe.”
“I’ve been…very busy since my ascendance,” Cas replied, taking a seat next to Dean on the bed.  “It occurred to me that even the former God rested once a week.  I’ve decided I’ve earned a respite from my Good work.”
Dean narrowed his eyes.  “You, however, not so much.  I thought maybe you were internalizing, or being stoic or some crap.  But lately I’ve been remembering some things.  I think the real reason that you didn’t flinch was because you already knew.”
It took Ellen the better part of an hour before she was satisfied that she’d written down everything she could think of.  She needed to make arrangements to get sufficient vehicles to take back with her to load her people and bring them to her new home.  And a heavily armed escort wouldn’t exactly hurt.
Dean glanced briefly over at Ellen, seeing the first gleam of shocked understanding fill the Alpha female’s face.  He flashed her a cocky grin before taking up the narrative.
“Yeah, yeah.  I know.  I’ve heard the party line.  That’s not what I wanted to talk to you about.”
Ellen’s eyes widened.  “You took on one of those monsters?  And look at you, upright and everything.  Call me impressed.”
He could handle all the anger Dean wanted to throw at him, but hurt or disappointment?  Those he felt keenly.  Whatever it was that he and Dean shared, it was something special.  Precious.  And Cas had the very real concern that he’d damaged it beyond repair.
Dean rubbed his eyes, willing the exhaustion away.  “What brings your almighty visage down upon us lowly commoners at,” he paused to grab the little bedside alarm clock, peering blearily at the glowing red digits, “2:47 in the freaking morning?”
“Of course, Dean,” Castiel assured him.  “I understand.  I can find someone else.”
“Yes,” Cas agreed, the guilt a heavy burden on his conscious.  “There’s something I did during that time that I need to discuss with you.”
“Cas, whatever your objection, it doesn’t matter.  The bargain’s been made.  It will be okay.  This is what Dean does; it’s always been his job.  He guards the pack and he’s good at it.  Don’t worry, you’ll be safe.”
Dean shook his head.  “Nope.  Maybe Cas could manage something, but I’d have to take the cuffs off so he could fully access his grace, and right now they’re the only things allowing him to keep what control he has left.   Good news though, I think the spell did its damage and dissipated.  I’m not picking up that twisted scent off him anymore.  Just good, old fashioned Alpha lust.”
Dean groaned.  “Faster Cas.  Slide your thumb against the head with your down stroke.”
“You’re the pack’s Alpha, Dean.  People will want, and deserve to celebrate.”  Dean scowled.  Reaching for the food plates, he started spooning himself another helping.
Dean stiffened, though he seemed completely in control of himself.
“Yeah, Cas?”
She watched the shiny blade shift end over end in Jo’s capable hands, the moonlight glinting off the shiny blade.  There was one rock left that she hadn’t turned yet.  One she’d vowed never to so much as think of.  And at its best it was one hell of a Hail Mary. But she was out of options.
“That’s exactly what I did.”
Castiel  didn’t deserve the other man's stalwart friendship.  And maybe he never would.   But for now, weak, frail human though he may be, he was comfortably wrapped in the strong arms of the man he’d fallen for.  It was enough.
Ellen steadily met their matching gazes.  “We got almost nothing to offer.  Hardly any able-bodied fighters, the kids got one parent left or none at all.  Most the omegas lost a mate, they aren’t doing well.  A few trucks, some weapons.  But there is something of value I can offer.”
His ankles were wrapped with the same elaborate knots as his wrists, pulled so tight his legs were spread achingly wide; were the bedposts horses, he’d be ripped to pieces in short order.  Just to ensure he stayed firmly in place, a final set of ropes twined around each thigh.  Between the lengths of rope at abdomen and thigh, his hips were very effectively trapped on the flat surface he was splayed across.
“Cas?” he called again, concerned when the angel failed to answer.
“Is he stacked?” Brunette asked daringly.
“Of course he did,” Charlie replied, snuggling up against Dean for a hug.  “That’s what he does.”
Night was well on its way to dawn, faint tendrils of pink and baby blue feathering the dark sky when Sam scented a familiar presence.  He sat up as a shadowed figure casually strolled up the path to his house, whistling softly.
Whatever.  None of that crap mattered.  What did matter was that there was something, anything, Dean could do to take the pressure off his brother, even it was temporary.  It was hardly the first devil’s bargain Dean had made to ensure Sam’s safety.
“Cas,” he groaned,  “I can’t take anymore.  I need…”
Cas shifted, not loving the lingering itch from the inevitable stickiness that followed sex.  It was all well and good during the act, but the end result was…messy.  And itchy.  Perhaps even a tad smelly.  He’d need a shower soon.  But not yet.  He was too comfortable curled up against Dean’s body to willingly move.
“Come on out,” Dean called into the night.  “You’ve been made.”
But what nearly knocked Castiel off his ass was when Dean, after hearing Castiel offhandedly comment about the sorry state of his well-used hole, point blank offered to allow the omega to fuck him instead.
Dean scowled at the Brit, a promise of future pain in his gaze.
Cas wore a scowl, but his eyes gleamed with deep satisfaction.  His hand was locked solidly on Dean’s elbow as he half walked, half dragged him along beside him.
Dismissing the male when it was clear he wasn’t any genuine distress, Castiel turned back to the librarian.  The woman appeared frozen, her fingers motionless on the keyboard.
He had no regrets.  Not really.  A few minutes of rough sex against a wall was a small price to pay for the benefits.  Every time Dean played ball, gave Cas what he wanted without kicking a fuss, the Angel did something for Sam’s mind.  Dean wasn’t sure what it was, but Sam always slept peacefully through the night afterward and woke brighter, the signs that he was seeing invisible crap noticeably absent.  For a while.
“Good,” Dean replied.  “That’s good.”
“Damn straight, I do,” Dean growled, taking a knee alongside Gadreel’s body with a good deal more dexterity than he’d shown in the last half hour.
Sam choked; eyes watering as Dean helpfully pounded him on the back.
Dean gazed at Castiel, his pupils lust blown, his cock rock hard against Cas’ hip.
Daphne stepped forward, coming between them.  “My husband had an accident a while back.  He occasionally experiences some residual amnesia.   If you met some time ago, he may simply not remember.”  She smiled, but it wasn’t particularly friendly.  “Now if you will excuse us, we need to get home before the ice cream melts.”
Apparently he’d managed to get everything more or less correct, because the woman walked away with her purchases without ever having exchanged eye contact, much less dialogue with him.
But Dean had a reputation to maintain; giving that lovely young lady anything but his absolute best was unacceptable.  Currently, his dick and his ribs were engaged in a heated argument over who was ultimately right in that decision.  Ow.
“Dean, hold up a sec. I have something for you.” Sam pushed a small black gym bag into his brother’s hands.  “Call me if you need anything.”  Sam turned and strode up stairs and out the solid Bunker door.
There was no big sign announcing they were now entering Winchester territory, kindly check your weapons at the door.  Still, Castiel knew the instant that they did.  The caravan passed over a wide pair of dusty crossroads with an apparently unmanned guard tower at one corner.  As soon as they reached the other side, the low-key tension riding them eased.  People were grinning at each other.  They were home.
“Castiel.”
Dean was fierce as a rabid bear once he really let loose, and scarily good with a blade.  But Sam would be lying if he said he hadn’t been worried during the Pit fight.  That Fang fighter had been almost too large to be real.  But Dean seemed no worse for wear; his injuries manageable, and the blood-crazed Hunter that always resided in the back of his mind neatly tucked away.
Castiel allowed himself to be guided to Dean’s room, his mind already fogging.  He wanted to think it through; ask Dean again if he was sure about this, but he lacked the willpower.  He was burning up, and now that he understood what was fuelling the urge, it was all he could think about.
Stepping nimbly over the sitting logs, Dean began hanging wet clothes along the laundry pegs set out for that specific reason.  He reeked of alpha male, sweat, and sex.  And something else, a distinctly feminine scent.  Despite Dean’s obvious soaking, he still smelled heavily of she-beta.  Clearly she had enjoyed herself; Dean was nearly saturated with her marking scent.  It was very unlikely that had been inadvertent on the woman’s part.
“Dean?  Are you alright?”
Dean grinned his most wicked smile, noticing the way the angel’s eyes dilated in response.  He’d seen it before, caught signs suggesting that if he made a move it might be well received.  But it was always nice to have confirmation.
Silence fell, and to a person they gazed at the trio of Alphas.  “You lot are here to hear what we have to say and pass the word to your assigned teams.  So pay freaking attention.”
The hands on his shoulder slid up his neck, fingers soft, but applying just a hint of pressure.  Cas hands cradled his head, holding gently as Dean worked his mouth in slow, even strokes up his shaft.
This was a good time.  Nothing overtly dangerous lay within miles of the motel.  Sam and Dean were both reasonably safe and in good health.
“Everyone is fine.  Ellen did some serious bargaining.  You’ll want to touch bases with her when you officially rejoin the living.  But our pack did an amazing job.  Everyone reported to their assigned locations like clockwork.”
Dean growled and bit him on the neck.  “Do I look like some faint little flower to you?"  Dean raised his eyes, his pupils lust blown circles of night in an endless backdrop of shimmering green.  “I said go for it.  Show me what you’ve got.”
Sam turned back to the others.  “Jo, take the speed bike back to camp and update your mother.  Also, please find Benny and tell him I need him to track Dean and keep an eye on him till he sobers up and gets his head back on straight.”
“That sounds…uncomfortable,” Cas replied cautiously.  It wasn’t the word he wanted to use.  Monstrous, torture, those were closer.
These were importance concerns, but Castiel found he had a difficult time focusing; his mind intent on recalling those tendrils of water.  He remembered their path with perfect clarity, the way the drops splashed against a firm chest, dripping off a perfect pink nipple, trailing down a powerfully built chest to the hunter’s waist, forming a stream to his hips and trailing down the dip of his groin.  Dean’s cock had been half hard; Castiel couldn’t help but recall what that silky hardness felt like in his hand.
And really, Sam needed to stop giving his own personal Satan any new ideas.  The Devil was well entrenched in his head, and more than once the illusionary nightmare had seemed to glean inspiration from Sam’s own thoughts.  The last thing he needed was two days straight of Music of the Night playing on loop.  Twelve hours of Toto had been agony enough.
“It’s okay, Cas.  You know Dean.  Plenty to say about shit that doesn’t matter but he clams up the moment the discussion gets within a foot of personal issues.”
“What?  You think it takes me 15 minutes to grab a set of cuffs?” Dean asked, tracking Cas' gaze.  “I took a few minutes to make some adjustments to my room’s decor.”
Ignoring Cas’ interruption, he plowed on with his story.  “I took them both down.  By myself.  I would have taken my booze buddy, too, if I’d had to.  I got lucky and found a better way.”
He’d been careful to keep a wary eye on Benny; well aware the ornery beta blamed him for costing the pack the valuable crates of gunpowder.  Castiel was far from helpless, but the beta was a big man and clearly well liked. Castiel didn’t want to start any fights so soon if he could help it.
“Alright, then.”  Ellen told the brothers.  “Sounds like we have a deal.  Got a pen?  Brewing hooch may sound simple in theory, but doing it right can get complicated.  This is gonna take me a while.”
John was old school enough, and retired military to boot, to not approve, but he’d let it slide.  Figured it was harmless, a phase or something.   Dean was a young man dealing with an onslaught of new hormones and a little experimenting was normal at that age.  Maybe he shouldn’t have been okay with it; maybe if he’d nipped it in the bud then and there Dean wouldn’t have thought to get money the way he did.  Regardless, it was too late now.  All they could do was go forward.
Muttering to himself, Dean hopped the sturdy fence, a cloud of dust swirling up around his boots as he landed heavily in the cracked earth of the Fifth Ring.
“You recall when you first joined our pack?  Hell bent and determined on telling me exactly jack and shit about your past.  You were all about that blank slate.  And I agreed.  I just asked for one thing.  One.  Your past was your own.  All I needed was your promise that nothing you left behind would come back on the pack.”
“Charlie,” Sam replied, choosing not to engage.
“It did,” Dean agreed, smiling briefly.  The smile faded to a hard scowl.  “But it’s not remotely okay to talk about this right now, and you know it.  Go away, Risa.”  He put a little growl into the words, and more than a hint of command.
Motion from the distant pasture briefly caught his attention.   It was nothing, one of the girls shifting around to get closer to his brother.  Initially, Sam had been worried about the girls’ safety, but Dean hadn’t shown any interest in causing them harm so far.
