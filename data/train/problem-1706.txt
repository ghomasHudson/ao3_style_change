‘Not unknown, just not talked about’ he reminded himself sadly.
“A bit dizzy?” Sherlock answers after a moment. John notes that the boy’s eyes won’t focus and he’s swaying.
Sherlock's smile seems to make John lighter and he can't help but mirroring the other boy's smile.
I’m sorry this chapter was a little late getting out to you guys! I hope it was at least worth it. I meant to have it up yesterday but life and work got busy. Should I write more in Johns perspective?? As always please leave your comments and kudos down below! I love hearing what you have to say! Love you all!

Johns voice trailed off as Sherlock nodded his acknowledgment and headed up stairs.
It's now John's turn to laugh. A loud hearty sound that breaks the tension between them. "God, I'm sorry I shouldn't be laughing. This isn't funny but-just imagine the doctor's face if I were to actually..." He breaks off his sentence to continue laughing.
"It wasn't your fault though..."Sherlock says.
“It’s complicated...I don’t mind. But...would you be okay with just the basics right now?” Sherlock finished, looking back up at John.
Troy stares up at him with wide eyes.
"Yes. You wouldn't let me introduce myself to you properly, and apparently I won't tell you anything you don't know, so..." John waved a hand at himself in a 'have at it manner,' and waits.
He's late. He knows he is. It's the reason he is sprinting down the hall.
“…so yeah sorry I don’t have much else in terms of blankets and pillows, but I hope this will do.” Johns' voice broke Sherlock out of his thoughts.
“I will admit it’s not for everyone.” Sherlock repeated, only to be bombarded by a pillow to the face.
“That’s...not where the beakers go you damn cat.” The curly haired boy mumbled.
He was going to be sick.
Sherlock only nodded, letting the tears freely fall now.
Sherlock glanced a look at his brother, having looked down after seeing the irritation written in his brothers bulkier build. His brother smiled-a rare thing for the both of them now a days- and asked again in a softer tone,
“Could have guessed that one.” John said with a laugh, heaving himself off the couch and walking towards the kitchen.
It was a bad day. He knew it when he woke up. Probably should have stayed home under the covers where nothing could get him. Mycroft was proud of him though for trying school again without breaking down. He has to try today. But now his hands are shaking and he can't open his locker and-oh god-his arms itch and his head is becoming crowded and, and...
"See you in first period then?" John asks lightly.
John smiled.
"Harry is short for Harriet." John says calmly shutting his locker.
“John, before I answer I need to know something,” Sherlock said before he lost his nerve.
"Don't mention it." John says as he leans over to collect the books that had once again fallen. He is about to hand them to the curly-haired boy when a voice breaks through the corridor.
“Then Chinese it will be.” John said turning around to grab the phone.
“I’ll start,” John answered, moving to lay on his side, head held up by his hand. “What is your full name?”
'Traffic in London is horrid. Hope to be there as soon as possible, brother dear.'
John looks up to see a well-dressed man with auburn hair striding towards them.
‘James Bond is an exceptionally predictable man.’ I thought as the movie played on the television in Johns quaint living room. I sat crossed legged on the couch with a plate of chocolate cookies John just so happened to be bringing out with every trip to the kitchen. Sherlock took a glance at John to see that the man was fully engrossed in the film, seeming to know every word to every line in the script.
"Jesus Christ, Sherlock! That was almost a week ago!"
“It sounds beautiful. I’d love to hear you play one day.”
“Nothing for it then.” Then John does something unexpected. He sits next to him. Sherlock begins to lift his head from his lowered position to look at the boy beside him, but was stopped.
‘Ah, yes. Johns place.’ He thought slowly, still clearing his head of fog. He heard a banging on the door.
‘Fuck, no, no, no’ he cried in his mind, increasing his pace up the stairs and slamming his way into his room. He quickly cleaned his room in hopes to calm his mind. His work was to no avail, and he found him self sinking to his knees on his now clean floor, fingers clinched in his hair, as memory’s he’d rather delete-but could never seem too-bombarded him.
“I just never had any interest in women. Had my first crush on a boy when I was five. Mycroft had to explain it to me.”
“SHERLOCK!” A voice cried out.
Sherlock swallowed the lump that was suddenly in his throat. He pulled his knees up to his chest, and laid his head on his knees.
“Oi! Sherlock? Mate you okay!? Been over an hour, foods getting cold? I’m coming in, sorry, but I’m fearing the worst here.” he entered the bathroom timidly and froze in his tracks.
"Please Sherlock."
John couldn’t help the smile that made its way across his face as he heard the slight snoring from the boy below him. It had been a long day and he was glad to see him finally get some rest. John moved so he was laying on his back. He sighed deeply. What a day it had been. In all his exhaustion he had nearly forgotten the reason he had brought Sherlock to his house.
“Well, you did say to say it again.” Sherlock replies grinning and moving the pillow under his head. “I believe it’s your turn for a question.”
Sherlock looks up and meets his gaze. "To nick the vein. I was trying. I-" he looks down at his wrist. "My brother found me that night and...stopped me before I could."
“You want to get to know me?” He states, more a question to himself than anyone else.
His father only bellowed a laugh in return, and turned out of the room with an echoing “Good luck with that.” before slamming the manor doors behind him.
He sighed as the blade cut into his skin, rivulets of crimson staining porcelain. Again and again the blade went down across his arm, before he stopped to look at his work. He blinked slowly, and stared at the blue vein in the center of his wrist. He brought the blade up lengthwise against the pounding blue vein, and pushed deep, pulling down.
“Only a bit, more for him than anything. I asked a lot of questions. But you, how’d you find out?” Sherlock asked curiosity littered in his words.
Sherlock stared at the man in front of him. Once again in the short time between them meeting, John had surprised Sherlock. For all his stature John Watson had a quiet strength about him;must be what made him captain of the Rugby team.
“I told you, it’s a lot.”
Oh, but John will. He’ll see the fresh cuts on his wrist and turn away in disgust. But John isn’t releasing his arm. Reluctantly, he lets go of his sleeve, and allows John to pull it up.
“Wanna stand up?”
"I won't, sir. I know where the class is now." He says with a chuckle.
“Noooopppe.” Sherlock replied drawling out the o in his deep baritone. “Enough about that topic for now though. I believe it’s my question, what are your hobbies?”
.......…………………..............................................
“Yeah. I believe it has for now.”
"I don't seem to have a choice in the matter between you an my brother." Sherlock says with a smirk. John feels his heart skip a beat as he looks at the curly-haired boy.
"Well then, Sherlock, deduce me."
“Really? No one, not even a kiss?”
“I conduct experiments. Keep all the successful ones written down in a notebook. I also compose music on my violin.  No finished pieces to date, but I’m working slowly.”
A few moments passed and the boy smiled, deeming his scientific endeavor a successful one. He turned to grab his notebook when he heard it, the slight crack of breaking glass. He barley had time to react before the beaker exploded on his desk, spewing glass and chemicals all over the floor. Sherlock sat on his floor, having being put of balance, eyes wide with shock and terror.
"I don't read minds. It's not possible. I merely deduce."
‘Who knows when the last time he showered was. Bugger barley reminds himself to eat.’
“You’ve earned this, boy.”
"What do you mean?"
"Fuck off," Sherlock replies simply.
"I've gone longer, John. It's not a problem."
“WILLIAM!” His father screamed again, his voice a booming thunder. His feet, like hammers down the hallway.
John is intrigued. This boy with the beautiful features has captured his attention and he needs to know more.
"Yes?"
“Sixteen.”
Sherlock only shakes his head. “No parents. Mycroft has a meeting. Home alone.”
"What's your name?"
showing John the text.
First off! Hi lovelies! I am so glad you are enjoying the story so far!! I have a few things to say before this chapter though, first off   I’m changing up the way I separate view points. Since this scene does not occur in school and has the characters together in most scenes, not all scenes will be reflected in switching views! I am also writing of my phone so bear with me!
Hi lovelies!! This chapter is sort of a filler, but I feel it’s important. I just spent the last hour or so storyboarding and setting up characters-those introduced and those not yet- so I feel this chapter is a good set up for the coming storyline. This chapter also took me a while to get started writing.  I never thought people would actually want to read what's in my head.
“I was thinking as I was washing up that we still don’t know all that much about each other. I mean I had you deduce me, but that only gave you basic info. If you want we can play Questions, break the ice a little bit.” John continues as he walks across the room to sit on his bed.
“Oi, Sherlock,” John stared again grabbing the larger mans attention. “If you’d like to wash up, showers on the second floor, second door to the left. Should be a towel in the upper cabi-Oh, yes hello? 813 Chinese...”
Sherlock felt a wave of relief flush through him. John wasn’t going to judge him, or think him weird. He could get used to having a friend.
“Yeah, ‘course whats up?”
"That was...wow. Amazing!" John says, his words not even close to stating how he truly feels.
“Sherlock, I promise my opinion won’t change. I just,” John shifted, “just want to get to know you.” He finished.
'Wonder when Mycroft will get here to pick me up...' Sherlock thinks while pulling his phone out to check his messages.
“Fuck. Hey come on, let’s get you back up.” John mumbles more to himself to then to Sherlock as he kneels down next to Sherlock lifting his shoulders gently.
"Sorry 'bout that," Sherlock says avoiding his gaze.
‘Oh John,’ Sherlock thought, ‘if only I could explain’
"I'll be back to pick you up when classes are over, but I'm afraid this is where we must part ways brother dear." Sherlock only nodded, and shut the passenger side door. He breathed in a lungful of the cool Autumn air as he watched his brother drive off. He let it out shakily and adjusted his blue scarf, before he turned and faced the school in front of him. Slowly, Sherlock pulled out a slip of paper from his pocket and stared at it before starting to walk to his first class of the day. Fourth Year English with Mr.O'Brian.
"Don't you 'honestly John' me, Holmes!" He snapped, "You're sick. You've got the flu. I'm only trying to help!
He got a groan in response and frowned, "Hey, Sherlock, are you alright?"
"And how do you know he likes coffee?"
"... Can I ask why?"
, not a- a-
"Just... Just wake up, yea? For me?"
"... Yes Sherlock?"
"Sherlock?"
"You know, I may not be an expert on this whole 'dating' thing, but I believe it's common knowledge that you find out what the man's
Blindfolded.
He lasted all of two seconds, before turning on the spot, and running to his car screaming.
"... I'm going to kill him".
"Sherlock Holmes you crazy son of a bitch".
"Maybe we can deduce them for fun".
"Spain" Holmes replied easily, "Down the south east, I believe. About an hour's drive from his hotel. A lovely sea side town, apparently, and plenty of war museums to keep him entertained".
"Oh? Is that all you have to say? This isn't exactly the way we said we'd tell him!"
Lighting up, he took a much-needed drag and stared in surprise as Sherlock did the same with ease, closing his eyes in bliss.
Mycroft upset

He suddenly turned back to the body, "... A study in pink".
Greg slowly came to a stop, before reluctantly turning and walking back to the smug bastard, practically tossing the cigarette at him, fishing out the lighter from his jacket.

Staring at him for a minute, the doctor frowned, "... Did you just admit to being afraid of something? The great Sherlock Holmes? Of an
Lestrade slowly nodded, "And you... you wanted to show me this, because...?"
"I..." He carefully took a sip of tea, staring resolutely into the fireplace, "... I've always been like this, John. This... This intelligent. Making deductions. Pointing things out that people didn't want to see... Now, of course, I understand it for what it is, but back then... I didn't know what was wrong with me".
"One pound for every week Anderson remains sane. I can't be too obvious, of course, and I can't say the word 'vampire' or anything similar to it, or I'll automatically lose, but if I get him to crack by more... subtle ways, shall we say, then I win. Currently we're on... oh, I'd say just over £200".
He could see the despair on the man's face even with the blurry CCTV footage.
John took a deep breath as he fixed his bowtie and locked eyes with his own gaze in the mirror.
"I'VE FALLEN IN LOVEEEE!"
Requested by:
" He groaned, "Don't blank out on me here! I need your advice!"
Lestrade glanced around the room guiltily before giving into the temptation and leaning forward, smelling it.
"No one knows why you have blue eyes Sherlock, in fact genetically speaking, you are something of an outlier".
"Well" Lestrade finally said, "I suppose you better come in then".
He couldn't help but smile, before immediately shaking his head at himself.

"Two for the price of one?"
"Yea?"
"I know" He sighed, standing up, "But you're going to have to anyway".
The detective felt something in his heart crack at the usually emotionless man's confused and somewhat scared rambling.

"Because us Holmes never do anything the easy way" came the eloquent response, "Do you want to hear something rather... embarrassing?"
"By stalking me?"

Stepping into the small room, he found himself automatically flushing at the reminder of how the older man had all-but pressed himself against him only days before.
Greg laughed, and Mycroft couldn't help but smile at the sight.
"Yea? What do you want?!" He snarled.
"Well fuck".
"What
The teenager delivered a powerful kick to his chest, and Sherlock curled up with a groan.
"I would strongly advise against finishing that sentence".
John raised a solitary eyebrow, ignoring Lestrade's confused looks.
"No! Go away! I don' want you fussing"
He slowly reached up and cupped her cheek, and her own hands came up to hold him there, leaning into the warm touch.
Mycroft had never met someone he found striking before.
Sherlock carefully takes a sip of his coffee, watching the events unfold before him.

"Don't wanna move".
And so, an entire painful night later, they finally got the go ahead and geared up, no one questioning the detective's brother or blogger as they also strapped on bullet proof vests and got into the van.
"As in... they'd be...
Rachel :)
The genius blinked, "Well I didn't order him".
Mr. Jones stared back at him, unimpressed.
"Would you just let me-"
Mycroft silently slid into the last bench in the court room, watching the case before him.
"... Like you'd do anything to make the other person happy" She said, "Like you'd lay down your life for them at a second's notice... Like you can't breathe when you're near them... Like you can't think straight and you're happy and sad at the same time and full of
"... No".
"I don't know how" He rumbled, "Because there's not enough words in the English language to adequately express these emotions I feel every time you're near me".

The man did as told, turning to face him fully, and Lestrade found himself flushing under the intensity of his gaze.
Sherlock glared at the wooden door in disgust.
Mycroft huffed, irritated, but zoomed in on the picture with interest.
"Of course" Sherlock replied quietly, "I'm taking no responsibility if we end up breaking things during the imminent argument, though".
Molly glared at him, eyes watering, "
She frowned.
"Apparently so" He replied, "And he's surprisingly quite good at it, too".
The doctor quickly stood up and walked over as the detective called, "Yes Sherlock?"
"I'll listen from now on, I promise" the voice responded, a steely determination audible, "Whatever you want, I'll get it, I promise".
And if he could believe in a dead man for three years, he could believe in himself for three minutes.

He spun around to face him, both hands resting on the countertop, "Mycroft, if you were a woman, the two of you could have successfully conceived a small human by now!"
sure as hell do".
The elder Holmes looked strangely cautious, "I... My driver-"
"Couldn't Harry help?"
And it was half an hour later, sitting next to the usually pristine man, now wearing one of Lestrade's old shirts with two pieces of tissue shoved up his nose, clearly uncertain with this bad food and even worse TV, making more deductions about the show's cast than Sherlock had ever done, that Lestrade smiled softly and realised that perhaps getting to know the more-elusive Holmes wouldn't be the worst thing after all.
And then, the kitchen.
"Of course I'm not

was meant to be the teenager in the room.
"No, you're not" came a voice from behind her, and everyone jumped and spun around as Lestrade suddenly stood up, pointing his service weapon at her with confident hands, "I've already lost that crazy son of a bitch once before. I don't particularly fancy losing him again".
The detective blinked slowly, confused, "I... I didn't get a new lawyer, where's Mr. Davidson?"
"Here, come on, let me show you" the pathologist said instead, handing him another cherry while she caught another one in her mouth, "You just have to eat the fruit part, obviously, and spit out the seed, and then... press the stem to the roof of your mouth, bite down until both ends cross over each other, and then push one end through the other... there!"
She sighed, "I can't... It's not that simple! I can't just decide not to- not to- stop hating my body, or whatever!"
"Yes.

He coughed awkwardly and reached a hand down between them to fish it out.

Well.
"Really John? How can you
"Can you..." He gestured futilely at the shut bedroom door, "It's just... she always listens to you"
And with another laugh, he was dropped, landing in a heap of long limps and twisted backpack on the filthy tiles below, causing the other's in the group to laugh.
Ten seconds later, there was a loud beep.
She hadn't.
Lunging forwards, he grabbed her wrist and bent it back painfully, not even flinching when the gun went off, resulting in screams from everyone in the room and Lestrade cursing and running forwards. Sherlock twisted her arm until she dropped the gun, struggling to get her to the floor. But he had the height benefit, and managed to use it to his advantage, and less than a minute later, she was lying face down on the carpeted church, her face pressed into the ground and her arms held behind her back. Lestrade wasted no time in taking over from the detective, handcuffs out as he listed her rights.
He slowly nodded, and Mycroft gave a small smile, leaning forwards to take his hand into his own, "... Promise me that you'll never do this again".
"So I've got a few cuts and bruises, who cares?" He shot back, angrily tugging at the bandages surrounding his arms and chest, "John'll sign me out tonight".
And if they returned shortly, with John sporting a dazed smile on his face and Sherlock's scarf covering his neck?
"I can... agree to that" He replied slowly, watching the younger head back to the door.
, Sherlock. I'm still your friend and Mycroft's still your brother".
"Yes".
"No!" John snapped, "Fangs. Gone.
Rachel :P
Leaving the shovel in place, standing upright in the soil, he slowly turned as he heard more leaves being trod on. He had his old army revolver resting comfortably in his coat pocket, and if he had to dig two graves tonight, then so be it.
But if he
Oh, how he
He tried to put on a smile, tried to lighten his heart, tried to at least pretend that he was happy.
"... What do I do?"
"No. No, he wasn't, really, was he? Frankly, a bloody awful cabbie".
He wouldn't get away with killing an officer at a crime scene, after all.
He must have been standing on something on the next stall over, as he easily leant over their shared partition, his head, a mess of dark curls, was resting on his right arm, elbow bent and propped up on the dividing wall, and his left hand was holding a cigarette, one, which, even as she stared, he took a careless drag from, seeming completely unperturbed as he gazed down at her with glazed icy blue eyes.
"Agreed" He replied easily, stepping forwards as his brother did the same, "But you threatened by baby sister. So don't expect me to fight fair".
She avoided his gaze, "I... I want you two to... to meet someone".
He sighed and ran a hand tiredly over his face, "I'm not... I've never felt love before".
"Well, I can only assume-"
... A friend of mine said this place might have it".
"Well, I do hate to rush things, but the whole point of this was to kill you so... never put off until tomorrow what you can do today?"
He sighed heavily and turned to face the younger man.
His piercing eyes studied her curiously, "... You were telling the truth. In that phone call. You... You
"It's okay, Sherlock" Lestrade soothed, reaching across to take his hand, "Mycroft and I may be together now, but that doesn't mean we don't love
"Who's the author?" He asked instead, clearing his throat.
He kept tabs on everyone Sherlock spoke to, of course, because it was that same over-protectiveness that had saved his younger brother from being kidnapped many times before. And one of those person-of-interests just happened to be Detective Inspector Lestrade.
"Where did
Charismatic, highly intelligent, and confident, but also manipulative, egocentric, and apathetic.
"I thought as much" Sherlock muttered, eyes flicking over the face-down figure with interest, "Clearly premediated, though a lot messier than the previous two... I need to talk to Lestrade".
And compared to tall, dark, and handsome next to her, she looked even worse, and she only hated herself even more because of it.
"Her what?"
His odd hours and occasional disappearances were actually expected, given the taller man's strange habits and case-obsessed mind.
The cup smashed in his hands.
idea what that was-"
, exactly?"
Because Sherlock was dead and he didn't have a best man.

"John! John look at me!"
"See you then" He repeated faintly, suddenly realising that his divorce had only just been finalised and he was already going on a night out with someone else.
... it might be in the back".

A well-placed kick under the table had John finally relenting and breaking the uncomfortable atmosphere.
"Agree to meet back here in 25 minutes?" Mycroft asked, and they all nodded in response.
John pursed his lips, half for a show and half to stop himself from laughing as the forensic scientist leant forwards with interest, and pointing at the pale stretch of sunlight that Sherlock had been walking towards.

"And?"
He stared at him, clearly confused, "... Sebastian".
In the distance, he heard sirens.
Molly stared at him.
"Ok, bit of advice, then. Stay away from that guy".
"... The spider?"
"... If it'd help-"
John frowned, turning to face him fully, and finally took in his harried and unkempt appearance.

Yet despite all this, the only think that came to mind was-
He heard a heavy sigh and the scrapping of a chair as it was moved closer, "... I think I finally understand now. Why you always get so angry when I do something stupid. When I... When I do something dangerous... It never clicked why you were always so worried about me, until now... I never had to worry for your safety before. I made sure of that, what with Moriarty and Magnussen and the likes. I just... I never realised until you were taken, that you could be taken... So I do, John, I do understand, now. I understand why you always worry, because now
"What is it?"
"... Holy shit".
Lestrade stared at him, unsure whether to be weirded out, flattered, or both.
He was reeling back by a sharp right-hook, and found himself sprawling back against the metal lockers, suddenly rather dizzy.
" He finished, shooting Sherlock a dark look at the detective tried to subtly make out notes in the darkness of the room.
Anderson was leaning over the body, but quickly stepped back when Sherlock arrived.
Staring down at his plate, he couldn't help but push it away, suddenly finding himself not very hungry.
"... I told him half of the truth" He admitted, "The fact I was being bullied mercilessly, that I hated myself for being different... but never the details. To be honest, I actually feared what he would do, should he have found out. Especially the... especially with the names they called me".
"... Good" He finally replied, "That's... That's good. Where are you right now? I checked the flat yesterday but Mrs Hudson said you were gone".
He had dutifully counted the time, 54 minutes, until the vehicle had stopped as well as the direction, four lefts and three rights then straight on for the last few minutes, that they had headed in. Based on all that, as well as the smell of slightly salty seaweed he got whiff of when he'd been dragged out, he placed his new 'prison' south east of Baker Street, somewhere near... Westminster?
Shaking his head, he forced himself to focus on the task.
He smirked, "And I wonder why that is..."
The 8-legged creature dangled down a bit further, and Sherlock hesitated, taking a small step backwards.
Waking up the next morning in the detective's bed was a rather strange experience, but he quickly brushed off all uncertainties, and redressed in his freshly-washed suit.
looks like trouble".
"I didn't think you'd be home in time!" Rosie continued, "Come on, I want you to meet Kyle!"
But that still didn't explain who had sent it.
John would be half-way through his morning shift by now, and neither Mrs. Hudson nor Lestrade ever knocked, and his brother didn't have so heavy a rap-rap-rap. Which could only mean one thing.
Mary glanced over at Sherlock, "You took your time. Word has it that you've been in London for over two weeks now".
"... Gregory" He finally decided, head foggy, "I... I don't know what this is".
So, he does what he does best.
"Yours is more dangerous".
"I'm surrounded by idiots!" came the snide reply, before he returned his gaze to the plant, "I'll be needing my UV lamp back".
He took a deep breath, struggling not to smile, "... Mycroft Holmes kissed me".
"Out-li-ar? What's that mean?"
His lips twitched into a wry smirk, "You need my
He kissed him.
"Don't".
And children really could be rather cruel.
Staring at him for a solid minute, Lestrade had just begun to squirm under a rather
Grabs his gun and kills someone.
"Well if I can't fight her, I'm sure as hell going to fight you!" Sebastian snarled, and Mycroft carefully brought a hand to his mouth, only to find it stain with blood.
"Fine. I'll 'rink it. But
Sherlock quickly raised the newspaper once more to block his grin from the older man.
calming, and returning to his seat, stabbing the now-cold pancakes with more force than necessary.
"You're injured" He replied, "And left-handed. And it was your left shoulder that got shot. You're on leave until further notice, and you'll need moving around so you can't stay by yourself in your flat. I've a penthouse in London, I'll be staying there anyway to keep tabs on Sherlock until he's healed, and obviously you'll wish to stay in London so-"
"Come on, I'll show you!"
Rachel :)
"What do you mean?"
John froze.
Lestrade frowned, "I... What?"
He nodded.
High intelligence, the little need for sleep, and a fascination with dead bodies...
The doctor stared at him for a minute before sighing once more and throwing his hands in the air, "Alright, alright, you don't have to eat. But you're still taking some medicine and I won't take no for an answer!"
Of course he did.
"Sherlock-"
She self-consciously tugged a piece of brown hair back behind her ear as she glanced up at him, "Is my addiction really all that much different from yours?"
Quickly standing up, he began to walk over, thankful to find Sherlock almost immediately fall into step next to him, while Greg jogged to catch up.

"Everything?"
"Nope".
to be".
"... Okay".
There were no lights lit, John never risked it despite the remote location, but it was a clear cloudless night, and he knew that there was enough moonlight for the stranger to have seen him by now.
"Well, I'd be... I'd be glad, I suppose".
"Fuck off".

They were definitely her new favourite fruit.

Mycroft sighed softly.
"Move in with me".

"You hate who, honey? What's wrong?"
Mycroft took one look at him, before sighing, and taking the seat next to the younger Holmes, Greg quickly brushing past to get dressed.
"You know... I always thought it was too good to be true. Suddenly gaining a fantastic lawyer, finding out about the apartment, revealing all her other dirty secrets" He started, "... So I guess I have you to thank for all this, huh?"
Sherlock's open mouth stopped mere inches from his neck, as two pearly-white fangs gleamed under the streetlights.
before his gaze drifts back, over his confused family, over his shocked friends, over the bewildered guests, until-
Mycroft stared at him, "... I love you".
" He realised, "You mean murder?"
The second the boyfriend stepped out into the light, however, the genius stiffened, unnoticeable to the two teenagers but plain as day to his best friend.
He tapped his leg, ruefully, "I got shot. Are you still at Barts, then?"
'cause you told me to!"
, intelligent as her brothers.
It was well after the car had left before he snapped out of it, and he slowly walked back to the kitchen where the pile of pancakes remained.
"... Oh".
"Until what?"
Mycroft took a deep breath but couldn't hold back a small smile at the sense of relief that washed over him.
"Uh oh" came the eloquent response next to him, "Now
The genius eyed him suspiciously, the dark look somewhat lessened by the puffy eyes and running nose, before reluctantly sitting up and taking the hot drink.
"Who was the first?"
Turning back around, he grinned at him, "'ello. Are you new?"
Greg gave him a funny look, "Your chess set? What are you, like, 10?"
angry, for the first time.
Meeting his brother's eyes, he gave a near-invisible gesture at their sister hovering in the middle of the group, and received an imperceptible nod in return. Sherlock was the slightest of the three, after all, and his lean frame would have no trouble squeezing in between other's twice his age.
All eyes turned back to Rosie.
The boy spun around to face him, and Mycroft quickly estimated he was around 12 years of age and quite... jealous?
Picking it up, he raced after the furious woman.
"Well, it must get lonely".
"You're an ass" Sherlock interrupted, "And a cowardly ass at that. Go to Lestrade. Tell him you love him. Move in together. And more importantly, stop pretending you want to be here with me when we all know you'd prefer to be with the man who took a bullet for you!"

"He's a fully grown man, Gregory, he'll be fine".
you" He replied, "I'm not a criminal, Gregory. I always have a reason for everything I do".
Sighing, he put down his newspaper and stood up, putting his empty tea cup in the sink as he passed.
The younger slowly nodded and turned back to the baby, "The East Wind".
Three bad guys and a gunfight later, and they found him.
"To dispatch this pathetic excuse of a fight" He replied dryly, and the crowd around them boo-ed.
, Sherlock mused as he heard doors being kicked open and "Police, freeze!" being yelled from the ground floor above him.
in case he-"
"... Telling me to do?"
"Are these human eyes?"
He slowly held up clothing in his hand, "... You forget your coat".
Oh, how he loved single-minded people.
Shooting the padlock on the cell door, Greg kicked it open, and the trio wasted no time in rushing in and running towards the genius who had been held captive for all of 18 hours.
Pausing for a minute, he heard nothing more, and shook his head, dismissing it, before reaching up for the spider again, only for it to dangle down a few more inches from the ceiling.
"Sherlock? You still there?"
"No" He replied with certainty.
Sherlock, you've been
Singing along to Queen.
" He whined, tossing and turning on the narrow couch until he rolled over to face the doctor, flipping his dressing gown over to cover bare feet.
"Already read it".
Taking a deep breath, Sherlock raised his hand to his mouth, and swallowed, snide comments of 'freak' and 'stupid' and 'worthless' playing on repeat in his head.
It took him mere seconds to change, and when he remerged from his room, he immediately walked over to John.
, but was cut off as Lestrade jogged back in and turned to face him, "I've got a patrol car bringing her to the station, and an ambulance has been called. Is everyone else alright?"
"... You have to explain this to me" He finally said, and the elder Holmes nodded, "Yes. I know. But I don't... I don't know how to".

The second the pair were out of ear shot, John turned to him, "What is it?"
"Did she tell you what happened?" John asked, watching her get on the bus from the sitting room window.
"Can I ask you something?"
"Then why don't you pay Mrs. Hudson a visit? She'd enjoy that, you know".
"So... that's it? That's your motive for killing him? He
The doctor, having only just sat down more, sighed, "Yea?"
His flatmate smirked, "Oh. Yes.
He blanched, "What? Sherlock,
"Ah, Gregory, you're up, I've gotten the morning paper, how are-"
"Oh... that".
"... You got shot".
"Lucky sod" He replied, "Will you be home by tonight? I have a few cases I could do with your opinion on".
The part that killed her the most, was the fact that the great Sherlock Holmes had been reduced to begging. There, in the moment, she hadn't realised it's significance, not when he was doing that to her, teasing her, mocking her,
They stared at each other.
She stared directly back at them, face impassive.

Shuffling back against the cold stone wall, John pulled his knees up to his chest and prayed to whatever deity that was out there, that Sherlock had realised he was missing.
about-"
"Yes you bloody well do!" He snapped, before suddenly, his eyes widened, "... You've been to see Lestrade".
"... Did you?"
"But" She countered, "It would also show him that you're serious about this. That you do, in fact, know him. Perhaps not by traditional methods, but..."
Mr. Jones hummed thoughtfully, "Hiding assets, is she? We can use that".
"... Someone?" He asked, confused, "I... I don't understand, why would you want us to-"
him the most in this world, it would be Anderson.
Taking a deep breath, she looked up at him, and finally stated the reason for the entire afternoon.
Mycroft's eyes darkened when he saw the black eye and split lip, and the faint bruises littering the detective's jaw and neck. Glancing down even further, revealed bloody wrists from too-tight handcuffs, and various scratches and cuts lining both arms.
"Better?"
John's mouth shut with an audible snap,
Again.
Swearing under his breath, he jogged down the rapidly-darkening street and grabbed her arm, spinning her around to face him.
So here he was, bracing himself for rejection, for disgust, for
"... Something like that".
" He finished firmly, "That's what you pay him to do, isn't it? And besides... John's looking after Sherlock tonight, but something tells me that you could do with some looking after too".
"... Hello?"
you're talking to".
"I have to wait".
"... Dinner?"

Marching over, he took the seat opposite her, leant forward, elbows on the table, and waited.
emotions and entered the middle stall, locking the door behind her just in case.
"Well then" He decided, tugging on the sleeves of his pastel blue sweater self-consciously, "Let's start looking".
"Because Isambard needs at least 8 hours of sunlight a day, and he's not going to get that on a dreary London windowsill, now is he?" He snapped, "And I'll need to buy flies. A pet shop, should do... And maybe some peat, Isambard prefers acidic soil and this is mildly alkaline at best... Oh, and I'll need to find a bigger pot to give his roots plenty of space... And I'll play my violin for him, studies show plants grow better with classical music... And I'll also-"
He didn't stop walking until he was directly in front of him, their knees touching.
"That was different".
"No! M'fine!"
" He exclaimed, "And until you're in a less-reckless mood, I'm not giving you back your chemistry sets!"
"Because it's dark? Then turn the damn lights on!"
Hearing a knock on his door, Sherlock frowned and checked the time.
"You just rugby tackled my contract killer fiancé, Sherlock.

"She was planning to murder you?" He finished, "And that's why you're the doctor and I'm the detective".
"No, you're just loathing yourself, which is even worse!" He snapped, "Why are people always
"Yes. It is".
"It's not fair!" John whined, flinging himself in his favourite armchair later that night.
Rachel :)
He was getting married.
Oh. Maybe he should put a stop to this.
Of her own and whoever the hell she was texting, that is.
Sherlock suddenly spun on the spot to face him.
"Always".
"Greg" He corrected, "I'm dating your brother, my name can't possibly be considered irrelevant now".
" He snapped, finally standing up and turning the door knob, smirking when it opened with a single push.
" He whined, causing her to laugh once more, and he couldn't help but smile, eyes crinkling at the edges.
"What?"
He reluctantly handed it over, "Do me a favour, yea?"
Scarface tightened his grip around the gun, his eyes narrowed as he
Sherlock jumped a mile in the air, heart hammering at a hundred miles a second as he spun around for the source of that god-awful noise.
The children were older than her, more around his own age than hers, and despite the fact he knew perfectly well that she was a 3-year-old with far more intelligence than a 6-year-old, the other kids might not see it that way.
"... Is he sick?"
It was a silent agreement amongst the two older boys that they would protect her at all cost.
"Lestrade... Detective... Lestrade!" He lightly tapped the older man's face, and couldn't help but sigh in relief when two daze blue eyes slowly flickered open.
Molly's eyes fluttered close as he finally sealed the distance between them, pulling him even closer with hands running through his hair, and she grinned into the kiss.
"The feelings mutual, sir" Kyle replied, happy to have an excuse to leave John's intimidating presence, "Unfortunately, though, I'm afraid it's getting quite late, and I have go or my mum will start worrying. It was lovely meeting you both!"
"How much do I owe you?" He said instead, but the blonde shook his head, "Don't worry about it. I sincerely doubt that anyone else will be looking for it, and it's in a fairly beat-up condition".
Sighing for the umpteenth time that hour, he heard John groan from across the room and put down his newspaper.
"I'll send a car" Mycroft replied,
"... And he just
"The doctors keep trying to kick me out, claiming that visiting times apply even to the worlds greatest consulting detective... but I think I scared them enough into letting me say. Your own doctor is having an affair with the gardener, after all, and one of nurse's moonlights as a stripper, so I just threatened to expose them... They left me alone after that".
"... If you gave one to me, however, I might become...
She gave him a warning look as she past, and Mycroft frowned, confused, before suddenly realising that it was most likely because she'd gotten her boss shot.
It was quiet and small with an old stove in one corner and two beat-up couches in the other, while the main area was littered with mix-matched chairs and three-legged tables, and he honestly couldn't think of a better place to go for a first date.
Hoping that his nerves weren't too obvious, he braced himself for rejection and stated, "John... Would you like to get tea with me sometime?"
She paused, considering her options, and her gaze drifted back to John as she hesitated.
"Ambulance is on it's way" John announced, turning back around to face him, and he nodded, carefully untying the rope that kept his brother tied to the wall.
A full out, happy, white toothed
"Where did you find him, then?"
"Yeah, I'm not the John Watson..."
"Alright then. What do you want to talk about?"
"Here" and then suddenly there was cool water being pressed against his mouth.
If they hadn't practiced this exact moment a hundred times, he would've been completely stumped as to what the man was going on about.
And there, standing in the middle of his brother's kitchen, was Detective Inspector Lestrade.
Wait, what?!
, that it broke his brother's heart, and he found himself recalling all the split lips and broken bones that he'd never gotten answers for.
Mycroft shook his head, trying to dispense the ringing in his ears, and from across from him, he saw John do the same, only instead of a phone in the younger man's hand... there was a handgun.
"... Mycroft?"
Making sure that John was taking care of Lestrade, he kneeled down next to the genius, "Yes, brother mine, I'm here".
"What's my first name?"
He laughed nervously, "What? Bro, of course not. The stupid freak's only trying to cause trouble!"
And still perfectly capable of making himself toast if necessary.
"Hang on! Is that- is that- is that a
Sherlock frowned, the dim streetlights below highlighting the subsequent wrinkles that formed on his forehead, "Well... I understand that it's socially unacceptable not to...
"You know you want to".
She stared at her reflection.
"Don't you 'John, what-' me
And from behind him, came the most unmanly sound he had ever heard.
He had deleted all baking skills long ago, after all, as they were rather frivolous things to remember considering he had his own personal chef.
"Ah... no. No, it's... it's actually about Sherlock" came the hesitant reply as the forensic scientist scratched the back of his neck awkwardly, "... How, exactly, did he survive the fall?"
"But you wanted to".
"No, no!"
, obviously!"
It was well past twelve, usually Sherlock was up by now...
Together, both men poured over the six different place names, debating and discussing which was the more likely, working rather
Sherlock sighed and finally looked up at him, "His name is Isambard. Isambard Kingdom Brunel. And he's a Venus fly trap".
"Papa?"
Turning to face him, he stared as the man rubbed his hands over his face, eyes distinctively red.
, John! And he's
He stared at him, "... You're afraid of the spider".

"So why pick me, then? Why not Lestrade or... I don't know! You
Mycroft, surprisingly, didn't bring it up with John, despite knowing now that he shared his little brother's
"Stop" the same man commanded, and a split second later, a large door sung open with a
"... Explain".
And if later on, standing by the river as the bloated body was hauled onto the bank, Sherlock loudly announced he was thirsty and dragged John away from prying eyes?
Greg slowly came to a stop once they left the court house, and quickly put a hand on Mycroft's arm to halt him as well.

"Her".
The doctor stared at him for another minute, before taking a deep breath, dropping his bag, and walking over to his armchair.
"You tell him how you feel".
It was during a case, a double murder, as they came onto the crime scene.
Lestrade jumped and spun around only to find a short smiling man standing behind the counter.
"I wouldn't see myself, moron".
Mycroft stumbled back a few steps and stared at him in shock, blood dripping down his chin and onto his expensive shirt collar.
Sherlock stared, fascinated.
And as he left the store, he couldn't help but grin widely as the weight of the world lifted off his shoulders.
occasionally partake in despite the possibility of being found!"
Sherlock nodded once, before continuing on back towards the entrance of the alley, carefully avoiding any patch of sunlight along the way.
It was just gone 4am.
"That... That would make you happy?"
Based on Lestrade's reluctant nod in the soldier's direction, he respected him as a result.
The younger Holmes sighed, and looked over at his companion for the first time, "I want you to kill a spider, Watson. It's not murder".
John slowly nodded, understanding, and vowed to never let this seemingly-emotionless man go through that again, not when it was just down to him and Mycroft Holmes.
He stared at him in disbelief, "... Your own brother, Mycroft Holmes,
"You're just damn lucky he can cook".
"You haven't written a word, have you?"
He clenched his jaw, "You just wrote 'still has trust issues'".
He sighed loudly and blew out a puff of smoke, "People never do... It's not much of a love life, is it, when you don't even love him".
She paused.
"Well" He replied, still captured by the man's rather beautiful blue eyes, "What's this...
He ran a tired hand over his face, "... God, I wish I banned her from dating until she turns 21".
*BUZZZZZZ*
John almost envied his eccentric disguise.
He found himself smiling simply at the sight of the young man, and he got a flash of white teeth in response which only contributed to the fluttering of butterflies in his stomach.
" He snapped, left hand going up to cover Rosie's ears, despite the fact she was already half asleep.
He couldn't help but give a small smile, "Hello, little Eurus. Welcome to the family".
Turning to Rosie, he whispered conspiringly, "Promise me that you'll never turn out like any of them".
"Yes! Now quieten down or you'll wake him!" John snapped, quickly walking over to usher the man back out of the apartment, "And he won't be able to do any cases for the next few days, so double homicide or not, just tell him you don't have anything at the moment if he asks".
"Do they match?"
Rosie glared at him furiously.

His daughter also groaned,
"Just a black tea, please" He replied warmly, "I'll grab us a seat".
Lestrade grabbed a fistful of hair and tugged him up into a harsh, dominant, wet kiss.
It so happened that it was his favourite, and based on Greg's nervous glances every so often, it hadn't a clue.
Opening the door, glad to find the store empty, he put on a determined face and marched right over to the counter, jutting out his hand, "I'm Greg. Greg Lestrade".
He turned on his heal, pulling out a cigarette as he did so.
"You know the rules. We get one night a week to ourselves. No phones, no emergencies, and
He remembered finishing the hole, ten feet rather than eight, rolling in both bodies, and then covering them again. A few minutes of carefully moving plants around, and it almost like they were never there.
"And the pot calls the kettle black" He muttered, before finally giving in at his younger brother's glare, "Sherlock... we were going to tell you eventually. We just... weren't quite sure how".
He narrowed his eyes at the short blond boy, who flushed and fidgeted under his glare.
He stilled, palms suddenly sweating, breath suddenly too short, and brain working overtime because-
Ironically, that was probably the closest to a compliment he was ever going to get from the man.

Breathing in carefully through his nose, he tried to block out the shooting pain that seared up and down his wrist and tried to focus on what he knew.
He shook himself out of it, and turned back to the mirror, reciting the mantra that he had long since drilled into himself.
"Oh you're no help!"
"You go first" John said, and Greg frowned, "Yea, yea, I know him. He's in most of my classes. He's the friend who recommended your bookstore to me. How do
Mycroft was convinced it was all the beer's fault.
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today-"
"Well sometimes it's hard to tell with you!"
But it did lend itself to a lot of benefits when he eventually moved in with the man, because of course they were going to move into now, even if they had hated each other they knew each other's real names, and those secrets were far too important to simply let the other man go.
He did a quick calculation in his head.
"As in... it was a suicide attempt?"
It was 10 minutes later before he managed to stumble outside with a split lip, a bruised eye, and an obvious limp.
"No. It's Sherlock" He said defiantly, "Sherlock Holmes".
was that voice so familiar?
And as he spun around, he was treated with the glimpse of a flash of pale skin as the blonde's shirt rod up when he reached for the book on top of a particularly tall pile.
"That's a first" Donovan muttered, and he turned his glare to her, "Yes, Sergeant, it is. Much like how you spent the full night at Anderson's yesterday. Finally being upgraded to

"Admit to what?"

He watched carefully as she narrowed her eyes at him in the mirror, an almost calculating look coming into her eyes.

"Yes Sherlock?

A split second later, he had yanked himself back and swung a mean right hook that completely caught the genius off guard.
"Molly?"
It may be stupid, it may be pointless, but it was true.
Lestrade groaned as he sucked on a particularly sensitive spot just below his ear.
Currently, he was failing miserably.
"... And?"
Sauntering onto the scene, John half-jogged behind him to try and catch up as the detective made his way over the body of a young man, not much older than he was himself.
Mary was funny and intelligent and beautiful and they'd been going out together for just over two years now and this was meant to be the happiest day of his life...
He caught him staring and sighed, "Yes, I know, a rather tall fellow, isn't he? I do so hate the tall ones, they're always more difficult to get rid of".
"... You got shot because of me".
"... He's not?"
"I don't know. That's the problem".
It wasn't until their sixth case together that he finally asked just what the hell was going on.
"One more word Anderson and I swear-"
"11, actually" He replied primly, turning back to check on Sherlock, and the boy frowned, "Oh, no, I didn't mean to...
"Contract killer, if you will".
His flippant off-hand comment made her pause.
His entire body felt just as sluggish.
The blue-eyed man gave a small, yet genuine, smile, "You see but you
He hadn't gotten caught, he wasn't stupid enough for that, and even now he sat on the toilet lid with his knees drawn up to his chest, completely invisible to anyone looking under the door for feet.
Her eyes searched his face as he came impossibly close.
"Ask him out".
She knew it was rather pointless, as no one ever used this bathroom anyway, but she still got a small sense of relief when she saw no feet in the three silent stalls.
"... Okay then" She eventually said, trying not to laugh at the absurdity of the situation, "What's in carton number one?"
Cautiously reaching out as the excitement once more built up to a crescendo, he pulled the rope keeping the box together, and let the packaging fall apart in his lap.
Sherlock glared, "Shut up".
"What-"
"Right" Lestrade announced, clapping his hands together, "Your brother will be back soon, so... until then... Care for some pancakes?"
The man merely raised an eyebrow at him, "No invite, John? I'm insulted".
"On?" He replied faintly.
"John! John Watson!"
By the time Lestrade got to the door, Mycroft had already gone.
Greg stared.
Lunging for her phone, she unlocked it as she stood up and suddenly raced down to her room.
"It's a weakness. It makes
This time, the doctor did nothing to prevent the genius's exclamation.
He played violin at odd hours, went days without talking and then mere seconds rambling fast enough to lose his breath, and kept numerous body parts in the fridge on the shelf above the milk.
of them".
John frowned, staring at the red stain that was slowly emerging from under his suit jacket, coming from... his shoulder?
"Here, let me" He found himself saying, voice strangely husky as he stepped forwards, well into the younger's personal space as he reached up and caught the book from the top of the stack.
"Molly, wait!"
-wife soon enough.
And that had been that.
Afterwards, he can see Sherlock talking to Lestrade, and their eyes meet. He can pinpoint the exact moment that the genius realises the truth, and then immediately backtracks to the officer to throw him off the scent.
The brown-eyed girl burst into the bathroom in tears.
"The sun".
It was fine.
"I'll start listening to you, and I won't be as lazy, and I'll help out with the shopping, and I promise you, John, I swear on my life to you, that I won't ever let anyone ever hurt you again... but you need to wake up, now, okay? I can't change my ways without you pestering me".
Molly paused, feeling her heart tighten painfully in her chest at the admission, before quickly jogging after him as the billowing coat disappeared around the side of the door.
"... My?"
"You know who she's texting, don't you?"
The barrel of the gun pressed further into Sherlock's head as warning, "Ah... No. No, I... I can't, actually. I'm staying at Mycroft's for a few days. Something about the Prime Minister needing advice on parliament, you know how it is".
Was that...
"I believe in Sherlock Holmes".
"It's 'talk'. Not speak" He corrected before taking a deep breath and holding out his hand, "I'm Sherlock Holmes. Will you be my friend? My mummy says I have to make one now or she'll leave me until I do".
He slowly reached up and tapped on it, noting the time that it was sent.

The rest of the audience gasped, startled, and John, Molly, and Lestrade all paled dangerously as they realised he wasn't bluffing.
He closed his eyes in defeat, "Remind me again why I hired you?"
"... Glad?"
"No... No, John, look at me!"
He smiled and shook his head, "It's my store. My dad left it to me when he died a few years back. It's fine, don't worry about it".

Never!" Sherlock shot back.
He continued to stare at the flames, expressionless, while John stared at him in horror.
"We shall continue discussing these 'hidden assets' at the same time tomorrow" the Judge announced, "And, Mrs. Lestrade? I suggest you and your lawyer have a nice
John couldn't keep the smile off of his face as they walked into the secluded coffee shop.
He pouted and turned back to the crib where greeny-grey eyes gazed back at him, "She got mummy's eyes. They're too green to be mine".
"Greg, please" He interrupted, voice an octave lower than usual that made something twist painfully in the younger man's stomach.
The older brother smiled, knowing that they were okay once more, "Yes. You should taste his red velvet cupcakes sometime".
The sweater-guy flushed once more and avoided his gaze.
"Well it was either that or leave her at home alone" He shot back, "And contrary to popular belief, I am

He was getting sloppy.
Lestrade frowned, concerned, "Did you get injured on a case?"

He stared at him blankly.
He couldn't help but smile at how out-of-place the once-arrogant man was, "I can see that. There was no need, you know. I... well... to be honest, I half-expected you to have left by the time I woke up".
He frowned.
He was being held captive in an old warehouse that hadn't been used for many years, and his door was currently being patrolled.
John stared at him, and couldn't help but smile back, "I believe in Sherlock Holmes".
He surveyed the black eye and broken nose carefully, "... How long have you been here for?"
From then on, they were inseparable, and it was clear from the beginning that the youngest Holmes child was just as, if not

that made Lestrade only want him more.
Mycroft just continued to stare at him in shock, no doubt confused from this sudden turn of events, and the police officer couldn't help but feel a smug sort of satisfaction for putting the wide-eyed look on the usually unflappable man.
"I used to think I was an idiot".
The man took a step closer.
Well.

"You heard me perfectly well".
To say he was shocked when he walked into that chemical lab and saw Mr Tall Dark and Homicide, was putting it mildly.
Molly felt herself tense at the question, expecting more teasing but-
"... My psychiatrist" He replied, "Or, well,
Now why would I go and save a piece of useless information like that?"
Not until Sherlock returned from the dead, explained why he had to die to begin with, and then say how Mycroft was the man who had helped orchestrated it.
"... What is that?"
"Oh for- You've only been complaining about your massive crush on him to me for the last five years!"
He scowled and opened his mouth to retaliate, but Lestrade quickly stepped in to prevent world war three from happening.
She didn't even glance back.
John frowned and turned just in time to see the wide smirk that spread over the genius's face as he walked over.
Sherlock didn't move as the door swung open once more and his brother appeared.
She quickly held up a hand as he made a move to object.
"Oh as if you don't already know!" She spat, shoving back him, "I bet you and Sherlock realised the

Lestrade automatically reached out and wrapped his arms around the man's neck, pulling him closer. Mycroft leant forwards, pushing him backwards until he was forced to lie back on the couch, mouth gladly opening in response to a probing tongue, and he couldn't help but grin into the kiss as the elder Holmes growled at the intruding binder, catching it and flinging it across the room to where it hit the wall and fell, pages scattering everywhere.

"Well?" He demanded, "Your advice?"
wasn't stupid enough to touch anything in there.
Hiring Lestrade a new lawyer had most certainly helped him.
"But that's what people do. Be kind" He continued, almost desperately, "John tells his girlfriends that he loves them even when I know he doesn't. As do the people in those god-awful soap operas' that he watches".
And then he caught sight of the gun lying a few feet away from the detective.
Anderson as they arrived at the body, an insult that the infamous pathologist heard, and reacted to.
Lestrade was lying on his back, one arm bent back and resting underneath his head, and the other thrown across his stomach. His decidedly
"Our what?"
First things first; find out just where the hell he was.
"I need you to come over".
John stared resolutely at the floor for a minute, before slowly looking up, taking in the man still standing in front of him.
He groaned, "It's nothing, okay! I was just... you know... doing a bit of self-discovery".
"Do you... not like cherries?"
"Smith".
But he'd done as promised, and now remained by his side like a lovesick puppy, fulfilling his every request at the drop of a hat.
The man who was his best friend.
He had heard the woman come in a few minutes ago, and it most definitely
They were best friends, perfectly balanced, and the only people that could understand each other, and she was clearly the baby of the family, despite being the most gifted.
Slowly blinking, he looked up at the wild-eyed genius, distantly noting that his shivering had stopped.
Her gaze snapped up to his, furious, and she glared at him, "You can't possibly be serious!"
The Inspector didn't bother to correct him, though he did hear the snide remark from Anderson being thrown in, "If he can't even remember one simple name, then why the hell is he being trusted with a kid?"
"Okay then" She continued, "Why did you stop at just a kiss?"

Lestrade reluctantly nodded, "Sure. Tell him I hope he gets better soon, alright? And... just so you know... I sent everyone I know a copy of those pictures".
"Quick! Double murder and the perp has just kidnapped a third victim-"

John frowned, picking up his tea cup, "Oh no? 'Oh no' what? What are you-"
"God,
if Sherlock Holmes didn't know his books.
It was only later that night, as he poured over the book with a lit cigarette in his mouth, that he realised with a sudden pang that he'd never gotten the blonde's name.
He stands up straighter and smiles crookedly at Mary as she arrives next to him at the altar, and she smiles softly back.
"Thanks."
"What?"
“Thanks.” he mumbles quietly before hesitantly taking a sip.
………………………….............................................
I tried my hand at deducting in this chapter and hope I did it justice! Please let me know what you think!!
Then he could have sworn his heart stopped.
"Why? Jesus-you know what. I can't talk about this right now. This conversation is on hold for another time. Give me your wrist."
"Good. Because if I ever see, or hear, that you fucking laid a hand on him, there will be hell to pay. Now scram." John says as he throws Troy off to the side. Troy stumbles before running down the hall. Sherlock watches him run as he slowly lowers his shaking form to the floor and clutching his head in his hands. He curls his finger in his curls and tugs. He didn't notice he was crying until John spoke again.
His fathers question hit his ears like acid.
“So you didn’t like it?”
Sherlock enters the classroom and sits down quickly in the back. Quietly, he scans the space around him. He got to the room before any of his classmates, and has plenty of time to analyze his surroundings before being overloaded with information. The room is of average size, sitting twenty-five students comfortably. The teacher's desk is at the front of the class; a closed lap top is in the middle with a textbook and the teacher's personal items on either side. Behind the desk is a large whiteboard. Near the door is an arrangement of bookcases arranged according to year. He chooses a seat near the large windows that span the length of the remaining wall. Directly in the back of the room, it's better for him to be out of sight: he'd rather not be noticed. He's used to it, having learned long ago it was better to stay hidden and quiet. It was safer. Sherlock clutches the notebook in his hands and breathes deeply.
"Sherlock Holmes, not that it's of any importance." Sherlock replies. John can't be sure, but he thinks he sees a hint of sadness in his eyes.
‘Yes a shower would do me good. I can wash all the blood of my arm and...collect my thoughts.’ He hadn’t had time between the attack and fainting to think over what had happened to him, and what had caused it. He shivered. As much as he didn’t want too, he knew he’d have to go back to the night. If only too find the cause. Back to the night Mycroft found him in the tub delirious from blood loss...
"Two firsts in a day. A friend and a sleepover." Sherlock muses.
“Y...you...told me not to..”
“Damn.” He said laughing.
He heard his fathers hand go up for another swing, at the same time he heard the study doors open.
John was silent for a moment; Sherlock feared he would get up and leave. After a moment, John states, “Because you’re my friend Sherlock. And I know that people suffering from sudden attacks need a constant by them or it will get worse.”
The belt hit him like steel, and pushed his hands and knees farther into the glass. He tried to count the blows, but was finding it harder to do as pain clouded his thoughts.
"William Sherlock Scott Holmes! Answer your cellular!"
“Stop that!”John scolds as he sits next to him. John opens the water and hands it to the crystal eyed boy. “Drink.” He commands as Sherlock takes the bottle in a shaking hand.
“John, I...it’s...”
Secondly, this chapter is incredibly long, and dark! It has two flashbacks in it as well, so please be warned: if you are triggered by scences of self harm or child abuse, please proceed with caution!
John shook his head with a grin before replying.
“I’m sure in time she’ll come around.” Sherlock replied trying to comfort the older boy.
Sherlock blinked not realizing he had zoned out again.
“Bet that was awkward.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“How’d you,” Sherlock clears his throat. “How’d you find out?”
"It's not a problem; just be sure to not make a habit of being late," the teacher, Mr. O'Brain says with a smile. "I was about to take roll, and since you happen to be right here, I may as well start with you. What's your name?" The teacher asks.
Sherlock clutches his books closer to his chest as he stares back at Troy.
"Did I miss anything?"
It was a normal summer Saturday night in the Holmes household, and Sherlock sat at his bedroom table, spine bent. In front of him, sat a beaker a few drops full of nitric acid. He closed his book with a loud thumping sound, quickly stood up and strode over to a cabinet across his bedroom. The cabinet was filled with many scientific artifacts, chemistry books, and supplies. He scanned the shelves and with a slight “aha!” sound, grabbed a vile of hydrazine and a clean dropper and walked back to his desk.
"...Why..."
Silence filled the room for a moment and he was terrified he’d asked the wrong question.
“No. It didn’t even cross my mind that you would think we are. We only met this week.”
“I’ve never had one before.”Sherlock says under his breath.
“Well, come on then.”
"I have to go." Sherlock says while grabbing his books from John. John feels his heart leap in his throat at the rejection in the boy's eyes.
“Come? Come where? Uh, sorry. I zoned out for a second or so there.”Sherlock replies honestly.
‘Protection pose.’ His brain told him. He shook it out of his head.
“Bi.” John answered calmly.
“If my calculations are correct, a few drops of hydrazine should be able to mix properly without to much of a reaction.” The lanky boy muttered to himself as he collected the droplets into the beaker.
Sherlock is slammed out of his thoughts by the sound of people entering the room. He watches them, deducing them slowly one by one. A tall brunet girl walks in followed by the loud pop of her chewing gum-cheerleader, cheating on her boyfriend with a university guy. The story is made clear to him by her anklet: it's gold, thin, and has a charm of an eagle-the local University's mascot. Father's a banker while the Mother works with the PTA giving her some control over the school; only child. The cheating brunet is followed by a set of twin boys with short brown hair and Heterochromia. That was interesting. Each sibling has one brown eye and one green eye, and if they were to face each other directly, each color would meet its mirror. After deducing their eyes, he spent little time on them, not wanting to deduce their sex life-obviously twincest by the way they look at each other: the taller of the two obviously being the dominant by the way he-nope, moving on.
“Oh. Interesting.” Sherlock mused for a second. “I’ve never been with anybody.”
He took a deep breath, before stating again.
“John Hamish Watson.” John replied cheerfully.
--------------------------------------
Sherlock gets to class and begins to deduce his classmates and teacher, until John Watson walks in. After arriving late, John is placed in the back of the room next to Sherlock and gets greeted in the most unusual way.
John observes as Sherlock tethers on the porch before he steps in. John turns to lock the door before turning back to Sherlock. The boy was visibly pale and still a bit shaken up. The blood on his wrist is starting to worry him. It doesn’t seem like the flow had slowed at all. “Come on.” John insisted before grabbing the curly haired boys hand and leading him to the living room. “You still look a bit pale which bothers me. How are you feeling?”He asks getting Sherlock to sit down on the couch.
“Arms itched. Must have unconsciously scratched and opened a healing wound.” Sherlock think out loud.
John sighs as he opens the fridge and pulls out last night's spaghetti. As he puts the bowl in the microwave, a small smile twitches at his lips. His mind had gone back to thinking of Sherlock. He can't wait for first period.
"Whatever for, brother dear?"
Sherlock slammed his hands to his head as soon as he was safely inside the locked bathroom, and prayed himself to not go there, not yet. He staggered on his feet towards the shower, and turned the water on full blast to drown out any noise he may make, sat under the faucet head finally allowing him self to go back to that night, a week before school.
After class John discovers that he and Sherlock are locker buddies. He also discovers more about Sherlock.
Once John reaches the bathroom, he takes a moment to splash water on his face before gathering the small kit he keeps stocked. He returns to Sherlock and finds three cookies gone.
John grinned, seeming to appreciate the gesture.
“Science. If you can consider that a hobby. I like experimenting, seeing and figuring out how things work. Science is concrete. It always makes sense, always has a reason.”
“Sherl, will you open your eyes for me, there’s a good lad. Come on now, off your hands-oh there you go, gently!” He cooed towards his brother, his hand a steady anchor on the younger ones back.
The boy smiles, and Sherlock felt his insides flutter. "I won't, sir. I know where the class is now." He says chucking. The butterflies- as Mycroft had once told him the fluttery sensation was called- start up again at that laugh.
"How are you able to do that?"
“Was that not the best movie you’ve ever watched?” John exclaimed, searching for the remote as the credits began to roll.
“John! No! Don’t. It’s fine. Really.” Sherlock panics tugging his sleeve back down. John saw a bit of the scars that litters his wrist the first day but to see the whole extent-Sherlock can’t bear to show him. John would surely think him strange, then re-think being friends with him, and Sherlock-not ever considering having one before-can’t bear the thought of losing him.
John turns to find the seat O'Brian is mentioning, and spots the chair. He makes his way to it while looking around to see who is in the class. There is Jessica, the cheerleader who is dating Jake Wyldeer: number 15 on the rugby team. The Twins-as everybody calls them -Marc and Chase; along with about three other faces John recognizes. He gets to his seat in the back, and looks around to see he was sitting by. For thrifty seconds John forgets how to breathe. Siting directly beside him is the most beautiful boy John had ever seen. He is skinny, with marble like skin and dark black curls that frame his face. He is slouched in the chair as if hiding with his long legs stretched out in front of him.
“When are you gonna stop protecting this queer, Butterball?” His father jeered, as he let his hands fall to his side. “You won’t always be here to protect him, ya know?”He whispered, as he began to re align his belt.
He had no answer. He didn’t know what compelled him to bring Sherlock home with him. He was right when he had said they barley knew each other, and here John had them acting like mates around the telly. But he couldn’t help it. He was drawn to Sherlock, more beyond the sable curls, something deeper attracted him.
John turns to face the board after winking at Sherlock with a whispered, "Tell you after class."
...........…........................................................
“Never said that John, I in fact quiet liked Q.”
John watches as he walks down the hall and out the doors before turning to Sherlock.
Sherlock laughs. A dry hollow sound in the room. "Tell that to the doctor who put me on anti-depressants."
“Well, yes I just said that didn’t I?” Sherlock replied, turning to look at John with a puzzled expression.
“I enjoy reading. I have quite a collection of books at home ranging from Dickens to Rolling. Classics are my favorite though, especially “Frankenstein”.  That’s a favorite of mine.”
“My mother died when I was 7. She was...beautiful. Smart. I got my love of music and science from her. My father.” He shuddered. “My father is a government official. And a spiteful, hateful monster of a man.” He tightened his hands around his wrists, feeling his  nails dig into skin. “He lies and cheats to get what he wants. And if that doesn’t work...he finds other ways of rising to power.”  He was quiet for a moment. “My brother Mycroft is seven years older than me, and  gained full custody of me from our father when he was eighteen, five years ago now actually.” He said thoughtfully. “He, like our father also works in the government. But in a different branch. Where our father makes tabloids and laws, Mycroft is practically the British government. Eurus, my sister, is one year younger than me.” He paused and turned from John to stare at the wall. “She went away a while ago. Mycroft won’t tell me where or why she left. Just tells me it’s for her betterment.” He scoffed. He turned to look at John. He had a look of-not quiet shock but close.
"Hey. Are you okay?"
------------------------------------------
“You didn’t do anything Sherlock, I just-“ he paused sighing before he locked eyes with the brunette. “Look you don’t have to answer but I want to know more about your family.”
“Oi! Sherlock? Mate you okay!? Been over an hour, foods getting cold? I’m coming in, sorry, but I’m fearing the worst here...” Johns voice trailed off as he entered the bathroom, eyes locking onto the scene in front of him.
‘But, my calculations where nothing but perfect! Nothing wrong should have occurred! I double-no triple- checked all my work.’ Sherlock’s mind raced as he pushed himself to his feet. Mycrofts meeting had him running late again, and for once he was thankful of his brother not being here.
“How do you like your tea?” John calls over his shoulder. His only answer is a muffled thumping sound. “SHIT!” John cries. He leaves the empty cups he had been retrieving to rush back to the living room. His eyes grow wide and his heart races at what he sees-Sherlock lying face down on the carpet. He seemed to not have the strength to raise himself back up.
“Maybe...maybe we can play ice breaker games, get to know each other better. He seems like a nice bloke, seems to need a friend too.” he muttered to himself as he made tea.
Sherlock is at a loss for words for once. He had been his typical self all week. Intrusive. Rude. Guarded. Nothing that would earn him such kind treatment, much less a friend.
"Read my mind like that. You've done it twice now."
"Holmes! Watson! Pay attention!" Mr.O'Brian yells from the front of the class.
"Do what?"
He was startled out of his thought by a blast of cold water to his skin. Blinking he found himself sitting on the tile of an unfamiliar shower.
"Hey, Mike! My break was uneventful, as usual. My parents left Harry and I on our own all summer. Which means I was stuck in my room while she and Clara snogged on the sofa. Aside from rugby practice, all I did was binge watch the James Bond movies and surf the web. You?" John listens to Mike, as he talks about how he and his dad had traveled over the summer and how his mother had applied him to a jumpstart medical program. Mike's detailed description of his summer was soon cut short by the sound of the school bell telling everybody to go to class. John gathers up his bag, says his goodbyes to Mike, and heads towards his first class. Mr. O'Brian's English 4.
“Not Mycroft, Sherlock.” John replies worried. Disorientation is never a good sign in any situation.
I am deeply in love with the story I have planned! It’s been a work in progress for a few years now. Like always don’t be afraid to leave a comment at the end letting me know what you think!
Sherlock is brought out of his admiring by a shrill voice.
"Sherlock-"
He took the stairs two at a time and knocked on the door. No response. He knocked louder and cleared his throat. Still, no answer came from the other side. Getting worried he banged on the door and called out.
"No it's-" Sherlock's phone cuts off anything he was going to say as it beeps with a message:
"You're the youngest of two siblings. You're worried about your older brother who is going back to Uni after dropping out. Your parents are happily married, but travel a lot leaving you to man the house seeing as your alcoholic of an older brother won't. You worry for your brother, not only because of his alcohol abuse, but for the mentally abusive relationship he's in," Sherlock states while his eyes roam up and down John's frame.
John laughed with him. A beautiful and comforting sound, like rain hitting the window.
“Yeah, they aren’t they?” He heard John reply. It sounded muffled, as if it was coming from the other end of a tunnel. ‘Weird. He’s sitting right next to me.’ He thought sleepily. He had no time to ponder the thought. Sleep overtook him like a tidal wave and he felt himself succumb and relax into the bed before he remembered nothing at all.
“Sherlock?” John’s voice had turned a bit serious and startled Sherlock sat up.
“That’s it. There you go. Do I need to call someone for you?” John asks, concern lacing his voice. Finally Sherlock finds his voice, even if he hasn't mastered breathing.
“Hush.” John cut off. His voice barley a whisper. “Just...hush. Dry off and come down stairs. Like I said, food is getting cold. Didn’t know what you’d, uh, like. I ordered beef and broccoli and we each have an egg roll. So, uh yeah. Just dry off then.” He stammered shutting the door to the bath.
"You think you know everything don't you? Fucking homeschooled last year and skipped a grade. You think you're so far above everybody else, but you're not freak. Everybody else knows you're nothing but a pathetic little faggot wh-"
"Why are you-"
"By the way, what you did in class today was utterly fantastic! You never gave me the chance to tell you that. You left right when the bell rang."
John had a look of such beautiful awe on his face.
“I will admit it’s not for everyone.”
Sherlock feels his stomach flop at that smile and turns to his locker trying to hide his blush.
Sherlock stilled his body for the hit he knew was coming, and let the stream of tears flow as he babbled our pleas of “I’m sorry!” and “Please!” Knowing they would go ignored.
Mycroft swallowed thickly and slowly walked over, taking the seat next to the older man's bed, "I... I'm sor-"
And for Sherlock, that was a pretty bloody difficult thing to do.
He groaned, "God help me, I think I liked you better when you were bored".
"Tea? Coffee? Hot chocolate?" Sherlock asked evenly, straightening up and returning to the kitchen, and the doctor stared at him, cautious.
They track the phone, Sherlock disappears in a cab, and he realises too late that the entire thing was a set up.
Sherlock stared at him blankly, brain scrambling for an answer to a question his mind was too heavy to understand.
Stooping down, he pulled open the fridge and stilled.
John stared back at them defiantly, before slowly, predatorily, stalking towards the grounded pathologist, strangely satisfied with the flinch he got in return.
, but... nothing bad! He's okay!"
Eventually, however, he smiled, and her heart rate increased.
"Well it's about time you showed up, Inspector, I was beginning to lose faith in your, albeit minimal, detective skills".
with".
He stiffened, "That's different".
Lestrade ran a hand through his hair, agitated, "Well what's his deal?!"
If John had to name a single person that annoyed him, that disgusted him, that
Mycroft closed his eyes and sighed. He'd been over this nearly a thousand times with his little brother.
“Oh, you will John. I’m sure you will, at least. When I’m home it’s never far from me, it helps me think.”
'Shit, shit, shit! This is not how I want to start my last year!' John thinks while running down the hall. The right hall this time. He double checked not wanting to walk into the wrong classroom again. Cosmetology with the cheerleaders is NOT were he wants to be. He gets to the classroom and notices the teacher had already begun to introduce him self and what the course would be about. He opens the door and steps in.
'Damn. Thought, I was being careful.' "Sorry about that."
He closed his eyes and pulled the covers over him as another yawn overtook him. Tomorrow was Saturday. He’d think more later.
'Nervous habit. Always the hardest to break..' Sherlock thought, while looking down and opening his notebook. Mr. O'Brian begins introducing himself as the class starts. Sherlock only half listens, spending the time doodling on the back cover of his notebook. He only looks back up when the classroom door opens, and a boy about eighteen years old rushes into the room. The boy is short, being only an inch taller than the teacher, with broad shoulders. He has sandy blond hair that brushes the nape of his neck, with eyes the color of the ocean.
"I'm sorry; how'd you know I was-"
John sits there in a stunned silence. He didn't expect Sherlock to share such intimate details if his life. Before he realizes what he's doing he finds himself pulling Sherlock into a hug.
"Hey, Watson! I haven't seen you since last semester! How was your break?" a voice behind John shouts over the crowd filled with students talking about what they did over summer. John turns and comes face to face with the source of the voice.
"Give me those," John says grabbing the books clutched in Sherlock's hands. He sets them down along with his backpack and-when did that happen? It was on his back a moment ago? Wasn't it? John was saying something but he couldn't hear him, not over the voices in his head. One voice standing out clearer than the others and he wished, oh did he wish, he could drown it out. It would make everything so much easier.
"And I can bet it wasn't yours either."
He sprinted down the stairs, to the wash room and grabbed the cleaning supplies. On his way back up the stairs, he was halted to a stop. His hands shook with the intensity of a storm as the barriers in his mind where broken down and thoughts of Father invaded.
“William Sherlock Scott Holmes.” Sherlock replied, not looking at John. He had to admit this game was a little nerve-wracking. He didn’t know what questions John was going to ask him, or if the blonde would respond well to what he had to say.
He weakly turned towards the sound, and could make out the outline of his brother, before the darkness enveloped him.
“And in that week you knew my life story with a single glance, and have been the only person I’ve talked to in that class. Of course I consider you my friend.”
