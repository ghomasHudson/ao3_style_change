Tony shakes his head. “Sorry, zoned out. But… I mean, if you're really good, which I'm sure you are, I bet you could make your way without doing something else.”
Jarvis is quiet. Then: “Illegal substances. I know about the alcohol, but I can't believe you — ”
Steve's kind of just staring at him.
His three best friends gape at him. Steve flushes.
A week or so later, Tony's late to another board meeting.
Peter nods in agreement. “Exactly. Honestly, Mr. Stark can get zero to a hundred matches, but that could be overnight or throughout next week.”
Outside, he just shrugs. “I was thinking before one of the breaks, so we can get the best out of our hard work.”
Sam chokes on his milk.
Strange turns sharp eyes to them both. “Since some people have started avoiding other certain people to the extent of skipping classes.”
Tony stares at Steve. Steve flushes pink.
Tony then shrugs, twisting in his seat. “Good. Stone had these
Tony nods (much more floppier than he intends to, but it's whatever), smiling indulgently. Rogers flushes.
Steve's pink lips stretch into a terribly mischievous smile. “Where’s the fun in that?”
Tony nods, still not looking back, though the remark sparks a smile on his face. “Right-o, captain. I forgot you had muscles as big as my head now.” When Steve doesn’t say anything in response, Tony worriedly looks behind him. “Steve?”
“Exactly. I put his number on the bottom of that cup. Don't disappoint, Stark,” Bucky warns. Tony gapes at him.
He looks at the picture. He looks at the red check next to the name.
“Hey, kid,” Mr. Stark greets. Peter feels his gut twist as he watches Mr. Stark scurry around the immaculate common room, looking for things to clean. “Remember to be here on — ”
Steve stiffens. Tony breaks.
It's like seventh grade. Rumlow's just poured an innumerable amount of glue on the tiny New Yorker kid. The kid's life is basically over.
But it's a lot of sitting around — which Steve isn’t particularly good at. Absently, Steve folds the tag back to hide it. He's filled with nostalgia, a smile sliding on his face.
Tony slowly grins again. “Who are you, Remus Lupin?”
“You really expect us to be scared of two little girls and their big baby queer?” Cross laughs out. “Give me a break, man.”
Mr. Wilson considers this. “That used to fuel me, but now I just keep imagining what Stark can do with all of his nanotech.”
Vision shifts. “I believe they are fine, James.”
“Yikes,” Ty mutters, eyes already back on his screen. Tony only hums in agreement.
So when Steve opens his mouth to angst, Tony holds his hand up. “Now before you say anything — I meant that when Peter, Rhodey, Bruce, and Viz said that I was going to be on a blind date with a well-known guy, I wasn't enthused so I had planned to let the guy down easily after a few minutes of awkwardness.”
Sarah squints at Tony. Tony gives her a bit of a helpless smile. “Hi. I'm kind of a jerk.”
Tony shrugs. “I lost my tooth because I thought I could fly. It's a terribly embarrassing story. I'm trying my best to even everything out.”
Steve kind of looks like he's floating. He pinches himself, not-so-subtly, and Tony feels a smile slide onto his lips. Steve mirrors it.
*attached file*
“Well,” he says, opening the door, “
“Mr. Stark?”
Carter gives him a knowing look. “More masculine?”
“Will you stop that, Bucky? It’s my house, I can have guests over,” Steve snaps at his best friend right as a vaguely familiar voice calls, “Bucky? Is Steve back?”
Okay. Getting better.
now, remember?” Tony rolls his eyes. “Anyways, I honestly despise the weapons business and I'm not an enormous fan of the current military climate — or any military climate ever. I'd rather be initiating innovation in a different type of technology.”
Surging forward, he kisses Steve.
There are piles and piles of paint cans. The lids make up the colors of the rainbow. Tony feels his eyes widen in realization.
Sam shows them the woman, whose hazel eyes and dark skin pop. Natasha lets out a whistle, and the two men look at her, surprised. She shrugs.
“I love you, Steve Rogers,” Tony says. “So much.”
“I actually chose them so that you two could remain hopelessly in love,” Tony says dryly.
“How about we,” Steve licks his lips, “...
Sharon looks toward Steve, for a second. “What’s yours, Steve?”
“DUM-E,” Tony calls, spinning in his chair and pointing at the pile of scraps which fell apart for the fifteenth time a few days ago. “I will put you back together again. I swear. One day, you'll function.”
Tony's mom sighs again, looking away from both of them. Tony eventually finds time to breathe.
Tony gives him a little grin. “Understandable. But I was actually going to ask if I could catch a ride with you. I'll call a driver in for both of us?”
A bullet whizzes past Steve's forehead. His eyes widen.
Peter's waving a hand in front of his eyes. “Mr. Stark? Do you want me to do it?”
Rogers didn't fight back.
Steve laughs again before leaning in and kissing his new boyfriend. Peter leaps away, shrieking, from where he was wrapped around Tony. It's a very domestic scene.
“We stay up later, but the old people go to bed at nine every time,” he rolls his eyes. “Steve’s about to get a boatload of blankets and pillows and we'll make a big nest while Sharon starts her Christmas movie. Then we dig into the Rogers' ice cream pile and eat it until the lights go out at midnight.”
The nurse raises an eyebrow, but she still has a nice smile and soft eyes. “Hello. And who is your guardian?”
“Coulson is going to come down and make sure everyone's in the right places in five minutes,” Strange interrupts. “I'm keeping your asses from detention.”
“Cool,” he throws back, giving a lame smile. Sarah smiles back, a small, understanding little thing.
“Hm,” Tony hums. He takes the apple off of the tray, taking a large bite. “Well, then, you should be asleep.”
“Oh,” he says faintly. “Really?”
Then they all stare out the window.
When questioned by nosey, ever-present Christine Everheart, Rogers said only this: “I don't like bullies.”
Tony pauses.
A warm hand envelops his own, and squeezes. Tony looks up. Steve smiles, uncertain, though his grip is so reassuring.
okay so to everyone worried about tony having a good redemption arc, is this a good start? like i'm kinda reaching for this im1 vibe where he's a piece of shit and then he does a full 180 and everyone's just like :0 bc pre-im1 tony is like first eight chapters of this tony
Steve's lips tilt high and bright into a smile. He glances at Tony, cheeks burning red. “Oh? Well, I can assure you, Mr. Stark, there will be no marble statues.”
Steve flushes harder. “Next Gen."
Tony's mind scrambles for coherent thoughts. How the hell did Steve get let in — No, screw that, how is Steve friends with T'Challa Udaku? He even got greeted which is like — A fucking
Steve looks frustrated. “And where will I be sleeping?”
“Mr. Kringle,” Thor says through a mouthful of pop-tarts. He has a Pop-Tart shirt on that he didn’t have before, and Tony momentarily mourns missing
As he sits alone in his room, drowning himself in alcohol, he knows he should be thinking of a lot of things.
“Who is — ” He gestures wildly to Steve's covers.
Tiberius stands, wiggling his eyebrows. “What’s the hurry, Tones? Want some ass?”
that you'll like this person. Now, come on, and smile.”
Tony shrieks, jumping back in surprise, drops all of his M&M's, the eight or so packets flying across the ground.
a chance.
Pepper then scoffed. “Oh, of course, I do. Of course, I know they matter to you. You've been playing their games for so long it must be an instinct to think about what everyone else will think first and not about what
One side of Tony's lips tilt in a helpless smile. Steve bites his lip to hide his own grin, despite his earlier contempt at being accused of ice cream robbery.
As the four stand around smugly, Tony imagines the best approach to gently let down his blind date tomorrow night.
“But it's basically three days,” Steve exhales, looking his actual age of 101, and not the thirty-five year old he basically is.
Jarvis hums. “I believe that they'll understand. They just need a bit more time.”
“Would you like me to stall, Sir?” Jarvis asks patiently. “Before arriving?”
It makes Tony want to puke again.
Steve grumbles. “I'm not going on a dating app, Sam.”
He attempts to focus on the first two.
he shouldn't
It takes a while but when the room is near dead silent, Tony quietly sits up. He slides out from under the blankets.
Tony glances up. Peter's concentrated on his own circuit board. Tony looks back down.
And it was tearing Tony apart, because sure, he knew that he and Ty and Cross and everyone else were gonna follow the rules until they got into college, at least, but seeing the reactions to the broken rules via Steve Rogers's life? Fucks with Tony's head, because damn it, he wants to punch Rumlow in the face after a stupid prank, and he wants to draw a synagogue and paste it to Nazi-boy Schmidt's locker, and he wants to fucking smile while wearing—
Though Peter and Sam take all the credit for it at Steve and Tony's wedding a year later, FlickLove is still sent a large check of a whole lot of money from a secret endorser.
Tony shakes his head. “I — Steve, I couldn't — ”
gives them is the skill of
Cross, however, does not know when to stop.
“What’s this person's name?” Tony questions.
Steve looks back at Tony. His cheeks tinge pink. “Sorry. It's just… beautiful.”
Tony grabs it, hastily, grins, then rushes away.
Hammer jumps to his feet. “Oh my fuck!”
Steve’s holding his small card-shaped gift carefully, and his eyes fly to Tony, uncertain. Tony just smiles, though his own anxiety is clawing up his throat.
Tony fails to hide a small smile at that one. Getting complimented by Sharon Carter has that effect.
” Sam explains. “Steve has one, too. That's why we had to take that video of him, to prove that he was
“Shouldn’t someone take those down?” Jarvis asks, obviously upset.
Rogers will see Rumlow — always Rumlow. Rogers may see Cross. Rogers might get a glance at Stone.
, because even if Tony is moving to California, he doesn't want to leave Rogers thinking Tony was a stalker.
Tony sighs, and Ty rolls his eyes. “
Tony's jaw tenses, momentarily. He calms. “Careful, Rumlow, isn't your mom coming home for her holiday?”
Tony's eyebrows furrow. “Why would Bucky want my — ”
Forty minutes late to a meeting that Pepper had practically written in red permanent marker across his forehead to not miss wasn't gonna make being half an hour late any worse, so he might as well wake himself up more for the lecture and guilt trip he's gonna get.
Rhodey cuts him a look, but Peter continues, “We picked someone we just
“It’s great,” Tony says immediately. “It’s amazing. It’s soft, and — and these are delicious.” He swallows. “Thank you. So much.”
Sam was the first one to officially be ‘Infected’ — based off of the damn idiotic joke Tony had made that first night. That afternoon, Natasha Romanoff and Sharon Carter shared on both of their Snapchat stories a picture of them kissing Steve Rogers on the cheek, with the caption, 'HAPPILY INFECTED!'. Rogers was blushing, which is what the average man would do in the situation of Natasha Romanoff and Sharon Carter kissing him on the cheeks. They were the second to be deemed as Infected. (“Does that make them lesbians?” Rumlow asked. “'Cause that's fucking hot.”) The next day, Scott Lang pulled a (once again) blushing Steve Rogers onto their usual table, and shoved their joined hands up in the air. They got a mixture of applause and applesauce launched at them. During lunch, the valedictorian Bruce Banner made a show of passing Rogers a piece of paper and shaking his hand. He loudly announced that Rogers was a pleasure to work with. Rogers blushed. (Banner blushed, too, but damn, he has balls.) The most recent person to be Infected was Thor Odinson, who apparently volunteered to be Rogers's partner in AP Fine Arts, and allowed Rogers to put him in a pose to his liking for his painting. (Also, apparently — Rogers blushed.)
after all that Thanos stuff. Oh, no, Peter never should have done this, this isn't good at all, Mr. Stark's gonna
routine way too many times tonight. He's definitely going to somehow turn what Tony's just said to something that's implying that Tony was forced to be here tonight.
Caden then makes a crude gesture with his hand, which is pointed toward his mouth. Tony's fists clench, and he almost stands up, but the stifled laughter around the room stops him. He swallows, dryly.
Steve clears his throat. When he speaks, it's in a blur of words. “Anyway, Buck says he's here for me, but the only thing he's done since he's got here has been looking all heart-eyed at Natasha which is understandable since they've been dating for two years but have only seen each other maybe ten times — got no idea how they do it, honest — anyway I'm glad for them, really, but it was a relief to be away from all of that
Ty, pushed further into Cross to distance himself from Rogers and Carter, tsks. Tony almost winces — Ty was never one to lend a hand to a situation.
Ty sends Tony a Look when they get to their seats, then nods to some empty seats next to Rumlow at the end of the 'R' row. Tony, despite himself, can't help but feel disappointed. He shrugs, standing.
“What the fuck,” Ty laughs, like he always does about Steve.
“You must be Tony,” the guy remarks. Tony's eyebrows furrow. “I'm Bucky.”
“You’ve been helping for two hours now,” Sarah berated him. Tony blinked.
Maybe in another universe he'd be stupid enough, but in this one he knows the truth.
Howard's brow furrows, and he turns around. “You didn't win?”
Tony rubs the pinched area of his butt. “You heathen! You should be ashamed of yourself, Steven Rogers!”
And with
Tony gives a quick smile. As they lead him to his date's table, Tony tugs on his suit sleeve. This guy is well-known, likes
She sighs. “You're a mess, Stark.”
The two groan.
Damn.
Ms. Natasha
As the car pulls into
we aren't.”
“Thirteen,” Tony says easily. “What do you do when you're not… nursing people?”
Sam's currently driving them to Steve's 'blind date’, which apparently requires the presence of all three of his best friends.
Especially if he doesn't want Tony in…
“Yes, Tony?”
Rogers wasn't ever supposed to know.
that, but still.
Sounds terrible, honestly.
“Are you still trying to use that codename so we can talk about Tony without Steve going all sulk-y?” she questions, throwing open the fridge and taking one of Bucky's yogurts out. Bucky squints at her, opening his mouth, but just slumps in defeat.
“Stevie,” Sarah commands.
fit them?” he prompts, before excusing himself and walking away.
“And when I posted that — that stupid post,” he breathed out, “when I told everyone the one thing that I thought you might hate me for, and you still kept smiling at me, I was so relieved. I thought you knew that I was talking about you in my caption, and I felt so stupid, but so happy that you didn’t mind, when everyone else was… And then the prank happened, and — ” Steve finally met his gaze, eyes glistening. “I hated you.”
“I don’t need anything,” Steve insists. He looks around the unit, eyes roaming. “This… Seeing all of this is enough. More than.”
Tony lets out a sob. Steve’s tears track down his cheeks.
“‘Busted. Barnes, Wilson, and Romanoff, I'm guessing? Do you guys often act like you're Rogers? -Rhodes, Banner, Parker & Vision’,” Nat reads aloud. “Bastards.”
Steve just gives a sheepish, quiet laugh. “Not at all, Mr. Jarvis. He was a gentleman.”
“Of course,” and he's staring straight into those ocean eyes, the ones that are wide and hurt and “when do I disappoint, Brock?”
Natasha's smiling. “You both did very well on your little theatrics. I couldn't even tell you were lying.”
“Well, duh,
It's dead silent.
Unfortunately, Tony's not a simple bystander this time. He has to think of a fucking reply.
There's a lot of comments, but the suggested one reads:
“But you didn't force them to help convince me,” Stark argues.
Tony stiffens. He lowers his feet. “Hm? Why?”
Nat and Sam ask several more mandatory questions that they definitely knew themselves about him, before they get onto ones that they have to check with Steve.
Another gasp. Sam's eyes widen at his use of Mhmm's name. Natasha groans.
“Stay the
Tony's response is immediate. “Well, I've been staring at this ring I made you six months ago for like, the past hour, so, really... This isn't spur of the moment.”
Tony's already walking away. “I’m fine.”
He keeps his eyes acutely focuses on his nails, so when Bucky slams the coffee cup on the counter, he jumps.
Mr. Stark pauses in his movements, and he has an uncharacteristic sheepish look on his face. “I — Okay? Okay. By the way, why is Barnes on a first name basis when I'm apparently going to be ‘Mr. Stark’ till the end of time?”
“I could ask you the same,” Barnes retorts as he walks toward the coffee machine. Simultaneously, a blonde head pops out from the backroom. Tony feels his lips stretch into a wider smile.
Especially by the people surrounding Tony's table.
On Friday, Tony finally throws the cup away. Barnes and Wilson played a cute joke, but it wasn't that funny to Tony's pining heart.
Unwrapping it gently, Steve lets the two cards slide out of their pouch. Tony twitches. “Turns out that gas station was still open. I got that gift card when you were asleep. The other is an ID card for the unit we went to, last night. It’ll be cleared out by New Year’s, and I was thinking that you could fill the place up as an art studio. I mean, the unit’s my property, so it’d just go to waste otherwise —
In the car, Cross and Rumlow are chattering loudly, and Ty's hardly paying attention to the road since he keeps looking at his phone. Tony barely registers any of it happening around him. By the time they arrive at M'Baku’s house, the party is already in full swing.
As their voices drain out, Tony helplessly looks to Steve. Steve bites his lip, amusement clear in his face.
But Caden and the others are laughing and showing more emotion that Tony's ever seen them have, other than the smug expressions they take on after they win a big game, and he can't exactly go back in time (yet), so he just smirks.
Steve feels his stomach plummet.
“Hello, welcome to
“Rogers,” Tony interrupts. Steve stops talking, startled and gorgeous. “I’m sorry for… everything.”
You here yet snickerdoodle??
Steve is frowning at him, concerned. “You okay, Tony?”
Steve follows, jaw still unhinged.
Tony doesn't have time to connect the dots before Sarah opens the door.
After that, Tony gets an innumerable amount of glares from Rogers's friends. The worst are from Carter — she's friends with Rhodey and had always been lenient with Tony's antics, even when he hung out with assholes.
“Oh my fuck!” Hammer's yelling, and Tony gives a sidelong glance to Ty because he told him that Justin Hammer shouldn't be allowed in either of their houses for longer than fifteen minutes at a time. He's been here for an hour.
“It’s just that,” Hammer presses, “everyone’s infected, nowadays.”
Natasha's been watching with studious eyes. “We didn't act out of professionalism, Tony.”
And gee, that didn't help because that's the first time Tony's ever heard Steve Rogers say his first name and wow.
Tony squints at the kid before looking away. Honestly, why does he even try?
“Boy, you're more guaranteed to be in California than I am,” Howard snorts, pouring himself another drink. “Better start saying your goodbyes and drawing up some designs.”
“We’ve been made,” Sam deflates.
Tony flushed. “Not sure that'd be better for me.”
Tony winces. “I'm sorry, Steve, it's just — when, when you're not there, Stevie, I — I can't sleep. Not — Not alone, not where I can't turn to you and see you — ”
“Maybe by how you didn't think to even text Steve that you weren't interested?” Bucky growls. “How you left the guy mopin' for weeks because you couldn't take the time outta your "busy" schedule to call him? He was so — so fucking torn.”
Pepper Potts is sitting primly in one of the few chairs left in the room. She doesn't say anything about the few boxes lining the walls.
Tony gets it.
It's almost like they're adapting, Tony realizes. The post of Rogers and Barnes — there were no homophobic slurs, just questions if Barnes was Rogers's boyfriend. The Infected thing has lost all entertainment value and no one's actively avoiding interaction with Rogers and his group besides people like Tony and his asshole friends. Hell —
” Tony says wondrously.
Tony smiles softly. “I do.”
FRIDAY makes a noise that sounds far too much like a clearing of the throat. “Based on my observations of Sir, I'd advise against that, Dr. Banner.”
hide 5 replies
Tony rolls his eyes. Ty laughs. “She's like Rogers's bodyguard.”
Jarvis is quiet while he and Tony walk to the door. When Tony's about to say goodbye, Jarvis says softly, “I believe that I'd prefer you to 'hang out’ with Steve Rogers. He’s always seemed to be a well-inclined young man.”
Tony scrunches his nose up. “There is literally no way to say this modestly, so. Just. I'm kind of a genius? Yeah. So. My dad pulled some strings, and... And I just took some tests. Easy.”
“That’s bullshit, Carter,” he snorts and Tony feels his life breaking apart over the next few words. “Tony’s pranks on Rogers are the only thing that some people look forward to.”
That night, he swallows a dozen pills from a bottle he found in Howard's liquor cabinet and hopes for the best. When he glances at his phone, he has an unread direct message from
“The noodle year?” Ty asked. “That was all you, man. Good, too, because Rogers was such a wimp back then.”
Well, Steve Rogers, as he tends to do, kind of broke that rule.
Tony's between Ty and Stephen Strange, because Ty told him that he was
Steve’s lips twitch. “Ask just about anyone I know for my feelings for you.”
Jarvis eyes him. “I've never heard someone so eager to hear a friend be humiliated.”
starts.
They react similarly, Peter giving them a good look at Mr. Chapman and his daredevil grin, before he goes on to the next envelope.
When Tony finishes with a whew and a swipe against his forehead, Rogers smiles and motions back to the house. “You wanna wait in there?”
As Steve hands over the small, brown bag carrying a pink-frosted concha, Tony shrugs, shamelessly. “I like what I like.”
She keeps up light conversation as they pass some other people's offices and the marketing rooms that Tony's only visited once or twice.
Steve leans against the counter. He's doing his Steve Is Very Disappointed In You look, and the three other people in the room sink in their seats.
Steve beams at him. Tony flushes, too. Barnes squints harder.
“Were,” Tony says under his breath.
“You’re… You’re not gonna get anyone cars, right?” he asks uncertainly.
A heat consumes Tony's neck and he gives Steve a quiet and hesitant laugh. “Gotta admit, it kinda didn't.”
“You asshole!” he accuses. “You got a Paul Wilson knitted sweater! Everyone! Tony got a Paul Wilson knitted sweater!”
He throws a careless grin her way, chugging his second(? third?) beer. “Cute girls that suck things from me are kinda my thing, so the whole vampire costume is good on you!”
Barnes.”
“TONY! BEAR!”
Tony's heartbeat takes over. The friendly banter is even worse than silence. He can't deal with Steve Rogers's adorableness.
Hammer leans in eagerly. “I can pitch in any money for anything.”
Romanoff frowns. “I don't like him.”
He wants to be alone. Or... He wants to be with Steve Rogers. No,
“Comics,” Tony repeats.
Tony gave him a smile. Rhodey walked away with his luggage, and Tony felt his stomach lurch.
Tony jumps. “Ma’am?”
“Yes?” he asks.
Steve stands from his place next to Tony, yawning. “You know the rules, people. Phones off and make sure you've peed. No getting up until Santa's squeezed himself down the chimney.”
Every student after Romanoff winces as Coulson's hand comes in contact with their shoulders. Rumlow jumps up, twisting his body away, but Coulson taps his leg still and tells him evenly that his detention will be after school today.
It's almost like a set of rules. Rules that everyone was always fine with following. That
“Doesn’t matter,” Tony says blankly.
Tony winces at the memory, however. He still remembers how he had instantly told Jarvis everything he knew about Steve Rogers that day after school. And then the next day. And the day after that. And the next. Tony thinks he might've continued to do so until he was in freshman year and realized it was getting a tad weird.
Peter immediately clams up. “Did May tell you? Look, it's all Ned's fault, really, I...”
He's Tony Stark, and he's Steve Rogers, and even when Tony's looking straight into Rogers's eyes, they are on completely different sides of the world.
Peter laughs, heading towards the workshop lab. “Thanks, Mr. Stark.”
Rumlow grinned when he saw them.
Jarvis exhales. “And how on Earth did you find yourself there?”
Tony's eyebrows crawl up high on his forehead.
say the slur.
“You make no sense, Wilson!” Bucky yells back, voice annoyed, but his eyes are beyond affectionate. Tony raises his eyebrows and Barnes glares at him. Tony grins.
“Oh, well… Thank you,” he says, somewhat awkwardly. The woman, subtly eyeing him, walks away. Tony blinks again. He inhales, looking over at the table again.
“Duly noted,” Steve responds cheekily.
Sam falls over his own feet.
Tony shakes his head. “No. It's fine, I can get them tomorrow — ”
. Tony exhales shakily.
Rogers looks confused. “Uh.”
Steve gives him that same look and Tony beams back.
The screen is a video of someone's Snapchat story. It's Cross's, but it's Rumlow who's explaining that he heard that Tony would be leaving Timely. The caption reads, "Stark's leaving Marvel High lmao weak ass sissy".
!” he cheers. Then slaps his hand over his mouth in embarrassment. Steve's lips purse in concealed laughter.
Mr. Rhodes nods, obviously uncomfortable. “And hope he sees it before they arrive on Saturday.”
Jarvis smiles wryly. “You've been down here for six hours.”
Nat tsks. “Come on, Steve. Does anyone know you better than us?”
DUM-E’s arm, abruptly, perks up. Steve makes a surprised noise, and, in response, DUM-E chirps back, scooting back into the wall — Tony scrunches up his nose. “DUM-E. Stop being a dummy. This is Steve.”
Tony clears his throat. “Table for Stark?”
no. What the
Natasha sends him a Look. “You
“Did you seriously get punched again after Hodge gave you that black eye?” Lang blurts. “'Cause, honestly, even Steve doesn't get hit that often.”
But it does, and when Tony finally lays in his bed that night and pulls out Instagram to see Rogers posted something, he — like every other Marvel High student — studied it like he was preparing for exams.
On Wednesday morning, Rogers shows up.
Tony grins. “There should be a ball in the crate behind you.”
“Movie?”
Steve smiles back.
Tony frowns, turning toward Jarvis, who carries a plate of food. “Dinner, already? Also, I resent the implication that I can't fix our fallen comrade.”
. (Mostly home, though.😉) Why's winter break so far away?
“What should we say?” Sam asks anxiously.
Well, don't die before I get there. ://
when Steve invited him to
Not even an hour could have passed.
Pepper huffs, quite frustratedly. “Tony, this one was crossing a line. This one was… personal.”
Sam looks at Tony expectantly.
Peter frets. “Of course you are, Mr. Stark, we just want to make sure you're completely ready.”
“Fine,” he groans.
“IS THAT FUCKING STARK?” yells a Brooklyn-accented voice from the back. Tony recoils, confused.
Tony sends him a look. Ty winks.
Mr. Rhodes rolls his eyes. “Give me that.”
pizza?”
Steve looks up at him, eyes wide. “Can it move?”
“Three,” Sam says excitedly. “Google says that sometimes people get zero, so I think he's doing good!”
Steve glances at Tony, cheeks red. “Shoot.”
Tony sighs. It's not like Steve or Natasha was rattling about him to Clint, so Clint must be after some information of genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist Tony Stark. Tony layers on a charming grin.
“Mr. Stark's second match is with Riley Chapman. A transman aged thirty-two who lives in Harlem, New York City. He's... An adventurer. He works for the
The four glance at each other anxiously. Tony's confusion heightens. Rhodey reaches behind Peter and pokes him, making the kid stumble forward. Peter glares at Rhodey, which is a
“No,” Steve grunts, pulling his gloves off then attempting to slide his uniform top off.
Tony's jaw slackens.
his father's company, he doesn't.
“This is unbelievable,” Rhodey mutters. “A month of hearing him freak out about this and he sleeps in.”
How has this gone downhill so fast?”
“What I want to know,” Howard fumes, “is why Rebecca Hodge called your mother this morning telling her about how you punched her son out.”
“Hey, no, no, no,” Tony reassures gently. “No hating yourself, okay, you're literally an angel, no hating angels, Stevie, this is important — ”
Tony shifts. “I mean — It wasn't all me, Hogan helped with freshman year — ”
Rumlow, Cross, and Stone all leap up, flinging themselves to Hammer's phone. Hammer's grinning.
Sam inhales. “We're finished. Ready to be sent out in the market?”
Thing is — he can't.
DECEMBER 2
” Natasha shoots back, grabbing the StarkPad.
Tony grins at him. “Hi, Rhodey.”
Fuck.
“Nice costume!” a blonde with vampire teeth tells him. “Ancient Egypt is kinda my thing!”
Steve leans in, burying his face in Tony's neck. “I'm so tired,” he murmurs into the skin. Tony feels his heart ache and warm for the man in front of him.
It was… Well, after the occasion, Tony had fantasised it as a date multiple times. Steve looked more handsome than ever, and Tony had felt underdressed, even in his Armani suit. They had talked, and, of course, bickered, but it was the type that came inevitably with Tony's and Steve's eruptive personalities. Most of the bickering had led to a lot of laughter and embarrassing snorts from Tony that made Steve's eyes twinkle and his shoulders shake even more. They talked about the most random things, along with strategies and politics — which had always made them bump heads, but Steve
Stark grips Peter's hands, and he's failing to hide a smile. “Whatever, Peter, I still can't believe you registered me in to that dating app.”
Peter makes a show of clicking a button on his phone screen, and Tony's eyebrows raise even higher. Peter smirks wider.
Tony rolls his eyes. “In Timely, Rogers, get with the program, I'll call Jar— my butler, he'll pick us up.”
Jarvis smiles softly. “Much like Mrs. Jarvis, Sir, the engineers were simply confused.”
Tony wishes he could tell him that he probably most definitely won't, but that doesn't fit in the whole 'Tony Stark thing' he's got going. “I promise I won't laugh too hard.”
Hammer gushes, but Tony feels himself fill with self-loathe.
The woman's back at Tony's side. “Sir? Is there something wrong?”
Tony shifts. One of the football guys looks over at Wilson and Rogers. Grins, maliciously.
“Okay,” Tony answers. “Where will the date be?”
Tony smiles weakly. “I said that?”
“You ass!” Rhodey's complaining. “I thought I'd have to kick Rogers's ass for breaking your heart!”
“Yeah, I'm hoping so,” Tony says quietly. “Definitely hoping so…  Anyways! Wanna play?” He sends a look at the chessboard.
Tony blinks.
Stark looks over to Steve. Steve's jaw clenches. Sam feels dread rising in him — here comes the punishments.
. He has a prosthetic leg because he gave his first one up for a baby elephant during a poaching fight in Africa. He needs someone who is okay with being in love, but can also bend to him leaving for months at a time. Again, we'll have to pick him for more information.”
Tony, mouth working, eventually nods. The woman walks away with Tony still gaping, but.
Nearly a month and a half has passed since Steve Rogers came out as gay via Instagram, and things have relatively calmed down, considering a good amount of the school has somehow gotten touched by one of the Infected. Still, Rogers is largely avoided, or purposefully ignored.
trigger warning: alcohol abuse and mention of taking several pills
It was just a rule. At Marvel High School, if you were gay, you didn't tell anyone. That's it.
Ty just shrugs.
Wilson but they don't give him anything other than their usual reactions when seeing him. The soccer season is over, the team losing the game into the championship, and Coach is already pressing for training, so Tony, Ty, and Rumlow spend some time running drills in the field with some other guys playing football. Considering that Tony's been on the Varsity team since freshman year, he's most likely going to be captain in the upcoming season for senior year. He doesn't want to go out without a bang — he's gonna have to work hard. All in all, though... Tony didn't see Rogers once all day.
“Oh,” he says. Instead of actively showing his disappointment, Tony shoves the cup in his face — only to instantly pull away with a scrunched-up nose because the coffee is disgusting because Steve didn't make it because everything sucks.
, somewhere else like in California or even Brooklyn, and Tony gets to work on his AI tech, away from his dad's name and still successful, and that's enough to pay the bills so that Steve is able to do whatever he wants but is still able to be happy and Tony just knows that he would be happy too and—
And, well. Tony can't deny that. He would want to, no matter what state of intoxicity he was in, but… but he wouldn't offer unless he was this stupidly drunk.
Her eyes shone. "Oh, yes, you were, what? Thirteen when we met?"
On Thanksgiving night, Jarvis takes a big dinner to Tony and watches Tony eat, eyeing the dark bags underneath his eyes. Tony tells him to go to Ana, his wife who takes care of the neighbors’ house, but Jarvis simply told him that they don't celebrate Thanksgiving, they're British.
“It’s a… It's a huge deal,” he says, and Rogers's eyebrows pinch. “All of it. You're… You're a big deal, Rogers.”
“Well, Tony, now you do,” she says, and she kisses him on the cheek before walking out of the kitchen.
And then a ridiculously intriguing thing happens. The skin next to Steve's blue eyes becomes really soft, and his eyebrows turn down a little, and his whole posture melts, and the corner of his lips tilt up, up,
Rumlow's laughing. “And next year he's gonna think of something even better than this year's, aren't you, Tony?”
The Rogers's house is a one-story, subdivision home — moderately sized and nearly exactly like the one next to it, but it's cared for. In the window, shadows of a Christmas tree and a group of people are talking animatedly. The driveway is shoveled, there are rows and rows of lights hanging, and there's an inflatable Santa in a sleigh on the roof.
Peter beams back at him.
Upon realizing what's happening, Tony drops to his knees, frantically gathering bags himself. Rogers hurriedly pushes the bags he collected in Tony's direction. Tony flings to his feet once the packets are precariously balanced in his arms.
He blinks.
Tony grins. “Me, too. Y'know I wasn't so happy at first but then the only good thing here found out the extent of my assholeness, and, well…” Tony shrugs. “Everything else isn't worth it.”
Peter just shakes his head, still smiling wide.
Tony winks at Peter. “There's a warm welcome there for you now.”
Half the school doesn't agree with that, though. It was probably one of Rogers's friends, they say — it was teasing. Besides, doesn't he like dressing up as a flag?
“You should, too,” Jarvis reprimands lightly. Tony shrugs him off. “How are you feeling, sir?”
Paul nodded, relaxing back into his gentle, teddy-bear stance. “No context. He'll understand — his mom taught him well.”
Rogers sends his mother a Look. “Extremely.”
“Are just a fantasy,” Rhodey clarifies, taking a swig of beer.
“Well, I happen to like things that are bitter to the tongue.” But Steve's still blissfully oblivious as he furrows his eyebrows in confusion, and since Tony's never claimed to not be a coward, he makes an escape. “Bye, Stevie, bye, Sammy!”
On Wednesday morning, Tony and the group are confronted.
Steve laughs.
Eyebrows rising, Tony laughs, high on the feeling that Steve's giving him.
“More or less,” Bucky agrees.
Tony lets it go, going back to his own work.
He wants to scream,
Who else do you know that's gay??
Steve Rogers tilts his head back, not taking his twinkling eyes off of Tony. “You hear that, Sam?” he calls back.
After dinner, Tony's throwing half of his desk contents away when Jarvis knocks softly on his door.
Howard's face is ghostly white. Tony's mom is at Tony's side, an arm wrapped around his shoulder securely. She's herding him away from the room, speaking fiercely to Howard. It's all kind of muffled.
Hammer, still pressed to the wall, splutters. “Yeah, what the fuck is this?”
Peter's mouth works, the gears of his brain almost visibly turning as he searches for a response, but Stark just shakes his head, which makes the kid slump in his seat.
But Tony doesn't want to go home, where it's empty besides Jarvis and his unmade bots.
, why did he think this was a good idea —
Hmph.
on his mind.
, really? What are we in, third grade?”
Tony frowns. “Steve? What are you doing? Go back to sleep.”
Tony winces before looking at Steve apologetically. “She really won't.”
anyways, i really hope you all like this chapter! i'm not a fan of how it turned out but i rarely am,,, anyways, next chapter is all sorts of fun, so see you then ;)
“No.” Tony rethinks that statement. “Well, I have a butler, his wife, a kind-of amazing super smart redhead, and an Air Force pilot, but. No. Not what you mean.”
Steve straightens. “You’ll all be going over extensive training to hopefully lead you away from your intrusive habits. The drills we have planned for you all
But Rogers can't… No, Rogers
“Would you like to come over for Christmas?”
“‘Then maybe you should call me Steve’,” Mr. Rhodes reads out. “Oh. Oh, he's good.”
He shoves them in a trash bag with the broken bottle pieces.
Why are all the hot ones gay ugh
listened to us? You know him, Nat! He's gonna get excited looking at these names, and find someone he likes, then think about Mhmm Mhmhm and then suddenly think that this FlickLove thing was a stupid idea, and that can't happen, 'cause I spent all my StarkBucks that I earned through taking surveys for three years straight just to buy the membership for the app!”
“Sir?”
Vision shrugs, innocently. “Wanda and I were thinking of couples’ tennis?”
He smiles a bit. At least he can appreciate the bulging thigh muscles of some of these heroes.
is fine, Brucie.”
All of them nod, and Mr. Rhodes' jaw clenches. “Read 'em out.”
“Are.”
Romanoff's shoulders shake, and she almost looks relieved. Tony realizes (to his own contempt that he knows this much about him) that this is the first time the reckless fighter in Steve Rogers has shown up in five days.
When tomorrow night at nine o'clock arrives, Happy drops him off at the comic art gallery thingy and Tony feels highly aware of not having a plus one after seeing every other guest filing in with someone on their arm.
They’d just gotten out of a soccer match, laughing about something stupid, all sweaty and sticky, heading to the gym to take showers before the school day starts, when Hammer is pushed to the school wall.
dead.
— said they should catch a dinner some time, but Tony always had a reason to get out of it. Steve felt pretty stupid but wasn't about to give up, and on his third try, Tony had somewhat reluctantly agreed to which Steve remembers feeling deliriously smug about. And the dinner went so well. It… It wasn't a date, no. Steve knew that much,
Well, too late now, he thinks to himself as he dodges into the bakery.
“Oh?” Steve snickers. “Neither can many with me.”
immediately?”
Dr. Banner leans forward in his seat.
Tony grins, relieved he answered that one thing correctly. “Perfect.”
Eyes surging open, Tony pushes past people with a similar lack of care. He vaguely remembers that the front door is in the direction he's heading, but in all honesty, he's just kind of stumbling until he reaches a doorknob.
Tony just hopes it's not Ryan Gosling — he's not quite sure he could reject the guy.
He was undoubtedly the most popular kid in the seventh grade.
“You would implode where you were standing,” Tony fills in.
could get through those two?” Tony asks. “I wouldn't last a second.”
“What could it possibly hurt, Steve?”
Fuck.
challenges. Which is exactly what Steve Rogers is. Tony's favorite enigma.
Tony blinks. Steve Rogers — New Yorker and new, skinny, weird kid, who holds doors open and who gives a quarter to the office's charity jar every morning and who draws amazing pictures and who fights bullies twice his size and who has a really nice laugh — is standing right in front of him.
! No, no, no, no, no! God, J — ”
“He just texted this,” Peter squeaks, showing the group the text.
Rogers is either purposefully avoiding Tony and Tony's group (which is understandable, considering, well — everything) or he's on the second level of the house.
Steve loudly protests as Tony grins. “Yes, ma'am.”
. So, well —
Both Steve and Tony throw a pillow at him.
“Tony,” she exhales and she looks tired — senior year, she must be exhausted considering her parents can't just pay her entry like Tony's. “Can we talk?”
It’s a splash of cold water, and Tony swiftly turns on his side, facing away from Steve, and hears Steve do the same.
“He’s at his home with Anna,” Tony informs. “And I’m at Steve Rogers’s.”
Steve highly doubts that, but he knows his boyfriend and love of his life well enough to say, “Okay, Tony.”
“ — doesn't even sting.”
Steve makes a noise in the back of his throat. His eyebrows are furrowed further than Tony's ever seen them. His mouth is opening and closing around speechlessness.
Jarvis had always taken it with grace, adding the needed questions and noises of affirmation whenever Tony paused in his ranting. If he ever thought that Tony felt anything other than no-homo-admiration for Steve Rogers, he never said anything.
“I’m fine, Stevie-boy,” Tony exclaims, even though he's kind of swaying where he stands. “No one will hurt me here, really, unless I want them to!”
Sam swallows. “Let’s do this.”
“Every — Everyone hates you in there,” Wilson barely manages to get out of his giggles. “And you hate everyone in there.”
Steve's cheeks are burning red, and Tony watches as he scans the card with his eyes widening only a bit at the name on the card.
After Tony recounted the story where poor Jarvis found Tony stuck to the ceiling at age six due to a series of unfortunate events, Sarah then hurriedly excused him.
When Tony goes downstairs to eat breakfast the next morning, Jarvis sends him back up since he apparently smells. Tony does it without protest.
He trails off, but Tony nods in understanding, a telling smile hinting at his lips.
Jim Rhodes reluctantly comes his way.

Tony grins.

The usual little brown bag is set in front of him. “Most likely,” comes Barnes' dry tone. Tony tries to hide his pout.
“No wonder they said NSFW,” Natasha laughs, and Sam clears his throat, cheeks still pink.
Tony smirks. “How's paradise?”
It's basically one of the easiest missions he's had in awhile.
While the group “gets artistic”, Tony drinks.
“Hey, are you o —
“‘Course,” Rumlow huffs. “They always do.”
Mr. Rhodes sighs. “There hasn't been any repulsor noises or any stray shields flying around, so I guess we'll just have to hope they're taking it good.”
Tony flushes. “That’s the one,” he mutters.
. The thought chases him to sleep.
Sarah's smiling when Tony glances at her. Steve looks on, warily, at him.
Scott finally looks away from his phone. “What’d you guys do to the living room? This is terrible.”
,” Nat protests. Sam sighs.
“Thanks. It's actually my dad's old uniform,” he explains. “It’s a bit too tight across the chest, but it works.”
Tony only barely holds in his realization.
When nine hits, Sarah goes to bed in her room and Paul heads to Steve's with no discussion about it. Upon seeing Tony's slightly confused expression, Sam explains.
↓ Thread
Tony feels hope spark in his chest and he swallows before leaning in.
Sarah sends him a look. “Tony’s in charge of the dessert.”
Rogers neatly dodges Coulson's hand. “Present, sir,” he says politely.
Tony grumpily trudges over. “Well — Yeah, but it can’t do much else except that and play fetch.”
In the middle of his tangled, star spangled shirt, Steve says, voice muffled, “Still no.”
Tony doesn't even care.
“Unofficially called a StarkStudy,” Tony says quietly. “For college students.” Sharon looks like she wants to cry.
He jumps on his next chance.
“Right up, Tony,” Steve hums, gliding over to the coffee machine behind him. He spins, his fitting jeans tight to his —
there was more to you.
Amidst the fact that Steve Rogers was gay, he didn't really speculate over the part of Rogers's post that said he'd had an 'admiration' for some mystery person.
Now everyone's staring at him. Aw, fuck. Shit. Shit fuck shit.
Once everyone's settled, Romanoff surprisingly queues up
He finally looks away, eyes catching onto someone else's.
Rogers lets out a surprised laugh, one that's almost melodic. “Oh, really? Well, Tony Danger Stark, you wanna text that butler of yours to come pick you up?”
Stark — Tony? Can Sam call him Tony? — groans. “Oh my God,
fucking bisexual.”
“What if it's that Ella lady, though?” Bucky insists. “She and Steve would be so good together!”
Now she's looking at him like he's one of those assholes.
Tony had imagined many different situations in which Steve Rogers said he hated him throughout the years — not once did he think it would be said in a teasing manner with a soft glimmer to his eyes.
Tony groans. He's so screwed with this man.
“We’ve gotta do something,” Sam defends weakly.
“M-Mar — ” Steve can't seem to talk. Or think. Or breathe. “Marry Tony. Marry you? You want Steve — You want me to marry you?”
It goes like this.
Tony wets his lips. “I— Do— You…” His jaw clenched in frustration. “It's been awhile,” he finally settles on.
“It,” Tony corrects, but complies by flipping open one of the waiting StarkTops, fingers flying to start up DUM-E.
Tony doesn't really like @jbuckybarnes.
Steve shakes his head, stubbornly. “My house.”

“Sir,” a polite voice speaks from behind Tony.
“And,” Steve continues strongly, “there are—
The boy in question’s cheeks are flushed pink. “C-Captain?”
“Sorry,” the person blurts, and Tony looks up, surprised, because that was completely his fault and high school students aren't exactly known for impeccable manners.
The nurse says: 'ah'. It's not with the usual connotative meaning of some intent or emotion, it's just a simple 'ah'. She didn't know, now she knows. Tony likes her.
An abrupt laugh flies out of Tony's mouth before he can stop it. He flushes but soldiers on. “An
Vision nods. “Do it, Mr. Parker.”
Steve and his mother are furtively talking when they come into view. They immediately shut up upon seeing Tony, both throwing nearly identical smiles on their faces. Tony huffs, but he grins a little.
“No PDA, Rogers, keep it in your pants,” he teases, a stern look on his tired, but happy features. Steve beams at him, with a mischievous look shadowing his eyes.

Despite having toured the entire bottom level of Udaku's house because Ty seems to want Tony to be wherever he is for the rest of the night, Tony doesn't see Rogers. Even after actively searching for him.
Tony's eyebrows furrow for a second at the odd reaction, but quickly shrugs it off. He gives his best charming smile. “The history behind that painting.”
Tony hmphs. “Seriously, Rogers?”
“By the time we actually pull the prank, you'll be coming out as gay, too.”
“Anyway, you're getting free pink-frosted conchas and straight blacks for a week,” Sam says flatly. Tony makes a noise of protest, but Steve shakes his head, grinning.
Tony grins. “Rhodey-bear. Merry Christmas.”
Steve shrugs a bit. “Not too far. Uh, three blocks away from here. And, well.” Steve shifts. “My house… I — Your friends are very… My house doesn't exactly look like Tiberius Stone's house.”
Tony seriously considers turning around and throwing himself through the window.
As she walks him down a hallway opposite to the workshops and labs, he doesn't tell her that he's an only child and that his mom is presently in Berlin.
Tony was shaking, and not from the cold. He wiped a hand across his face, through his hair, and it came back wet.
Then Jarvis asked him how Mr. Steve Rogers was after last night, and Tony's good morning went down the drain when he remembered everything that had occurred the previous night.
“Master Stark, please, if you would allow me to shine light on the subject — ”
Tony grins. “Well, it's true. I'm moving to California before the New Year even really starts. Going to college soon after that.”
Tony tries the grin again, and Rumlow laughs.
Sam, himself, laughs. “No way!”
Because Steve Rogers. Because Steve Rogers is standing there, in a stupidly tight, army camo button down and army green pants, with a sealed water bottle in one hand and is clasping the wall in the other. Because Steve Rogers's body language is screaming uncomfortable. Because Steve Rogers is staring at Tony Stark.
Steve feels all his frustration drain out of him, then clutches Tony back to his chest. “Oh, Tony.”
“And…” Steve says shakily, “And I know Bucky gave you my phone number.”
At first, no one laughs. It's silent.
Sam nods, eagerly, pulling the StarkPad back to his chest. “Right, let me just — ”
Tony looks at her from juggling some pies.
Steve makes an aborted noise. “Ma — ”
Steve gives Cross a very exaggerated, deliberate once-over. “I think I need someone with a little more… muscle, to pick-me-up.”
...wrapped in a rainbow flag, smiling wide, his eyes peculiarly flashing, and Tony realizes he's wearing eyeliner. His broad, wide shoulders are draped in the flag, his shirt says 'GAY IS NOT OKAY (it's fabulous)', and his blue eyes and beaming grin electrify Tony as he stares right into the camera.
Tony snorts louder, and it soon dissolves into hiccups and giggles. “True. And you were so skinny! Made me wanna... Feed you or something. Sounds weird. Anyways. You're big now, captain.”
“I can't believe we're doing this,” Dr. Banner mutters.
's, then nudges Peter, who smushes Mr. Rhodes closer to the window, allowing her to fit. Mr. Rhodes doesn't react, just continues trying to spy on Mr. Stark and Mr. Rogers.
His first thought is
The walls are shelved with his inventions. Despite being born into Stark Arms or even "Stark Industries", Tony has always known his mind belongs to something more than weapons. He feels more born to innovation.
“Tony — ” Steve tries to protest.
Sarah teases every single one of them, individually, for an entire minute when she comes back. Paul just nudges Sam down to the floor so that he can sit on the couch.
“Big one,” Rumlow nods to them. “We should do something right now. Get at them.”
skilled. But in reality for Tony and his friends is that Ty hasn't actually been to all of the continents. He's only been to Europe besides North America. And Rumlow hasn't been in an orgy — he had penetrative sex for the first time just three months ago. Cross doesn't have a million dollar company waiting for him — he's just interning at a really successful company because of his mom's connections. And Hammer —
Tony's eyebrows furrow. “Like military stuff?”
Rogers' eyes widen. “That must've been cool! Don't you want to be an engineer?”
At some point on his trek to the kitchen, a girl in a pineapple 'costume' — which consisted of a green bikini top and a yellow bikini bottom — apparently appreciated all the bare skin his costume presented, because she plastered herself to him and still hasn't let go.
The first one is Bruce Banner. It's first period where they sit next to each other and Tony smiles briefly at him like he usually does, always mindful that they're on different levels in the high school hierarchy. Banner usually sends him the same small smile back. He doesn't.
“Tumblr and Google,” Sam dismisses. “Now are we actually gonna do this?”
Then Rogers looks at Tony.
Rumlow laughs, like Tony said a hilarious joke. “Ooh, did you get touched by Rogers? Want some dick, Cross?”
Steve frowns. “I’m not being a — Never mind that. Tony, you don't have to tell them anything, okay?”
Howard rolls his eyes. “There
“Mr. Stark,” Peter stands. “It really was all my idea. I… The others really can't take any blame.”
“Don't disappoint, Stark!” Sam repeats. Bucky smiles a bit, then turns stern again when he realizes Tony's still staring at him.
The screen loads. Then an animated envelope pops up, with a heart sticker. Sam taps it again, and it opens in a letter.
Bucky chokes.
Tony grins at that. “Hey, tell him that Peter Parker's coming to ask him some questions about being in the military and tell Bruce that Rhodey always goes for his opponent's queen first.”
Tony's heart starts beating rapidly in his chest. Rogers has tiny hints of red and blue in his hair, more emphasized because of the blonde background it's against. He has heavy bags under his bright blue eyes and he's not wearing his usual stark black jacket.
“I'm weak for them, Stevie,” he says, slipping off his sunglasses. The barista smiles wider at that. “Your baker knows how to bake 'em.”

Jarvis sighs, pulling Tony's arms through his leather jacket for him. “Sir, you
A quarter of the house is already packed up when Tony's leaving for school and he thinks he vaguely remembers some people coming in to do it but he was drunk for the majority of the break so he shrugs the thought off.
“No.”
Howard tenses. Tony's eyes widen in realization.
“Showtime.”
Rogers seems to eventually write it off as drunk rambling. “Thanks?”
Tony nods his head to the door to his dad's office. “Howard Stark.”
“Just tell me if there's any news, okay?” Steve says, handing the StarkPad back to Sam.
“My dad's supposed to take me home instead of Jarvis,” Tony explains. “Jarvis is our butler,” he adds briefly.
Steve hmphs. He can't actually…
He's rich, though. It's not a problem.
Steve's lips part. “Oh.”
There’s a beat, then, that keeps them frozen in place. Tony’s heart pounds, and he could swear that Steve’s was doing the same. It lasts long enough that he lets his eyes fall back down, right as Steve’s tongue nervously wets his lips.
Tony slumps as he ducks his head to go in the car. “Do you ever feel like a child even when you're in your thirties?”
Wilson shakes his head. “Just stay away.” Then he looks back at Tony. “Especially you and your soccer boys, Stark.”
“Tony,” Steve calls, and Tony spins on his heels. “Could I, uh. So sorry, but could I catch a ride with you? I don't”
Tony tries to say something, but words are beyond him. Steve has more to say, anyway.
“I brought the rainbow,” Hammer tells Tony, dripping with self-satisfaction.
And Peter, and Rhodey, and Vision, and FRIDAY, and Bruce, and Pepper, and Happy, and
Paul nudged him. “Go on, son. If any of them give you slack, tell us. But if Sam does, first just give him this look.”
Jarvis is watching him, Tony knows, but Jarvis is always watching him. Tony gulps down the rest. “Thanks, J,” he repeats, setting the cup down and grabbing his phone and keys.
“Okay,” he croaks. Steve brightens like the sun, and Tony's sent back to when he said
Stone exhales softly. “Better go get Cross and Hammer so we all can have front row seats.”
Steve's eyes darken. Then he frowns. “Is this just a trap to make me shower?”
Steve purses his lips in distress, but nods. “That's good. Good.”
“No, no, no, no, please don't, Steve!” he protests. “I didn't get to ask you to marry me!”
As they start guessing loudly and debating about their presents, Tony slips from the room. Sending a quick text to Jarvis, not wanting to disturb his and Anna’s morning, he dials a familiar number.
It's a big deal. Especially for a city near Timely.
Steve turns a startling shade of crimson red, from the roots of his hair all the way to where his neck meets the collar of his shirt. Tony watches him curiously.
“As much as I enjoy seeing your creations, sir,” Jarvis's voice speaks from behind him, “I have my doubts about that assurance. DUM-E has been brought from the storage units to the workshop several times, now.”
Tony hesitates. Then,
“It's tradition,” Thor claims grandly.
“What?” Mr. Rhodes demands.
Steve Rogers is such a dork when he isn't threatening to beat you to an inch of your life.
“Think like Steve,” Natasha agrees strongly. Bucky firmly nods his assent as well.
They eat the rest of the food while watching movies. It's kinda awesome. No one even gives Tony the stink eye anymore. Except Bucky, but Tony thinks their nemesis is just meant to be.
Then he kinda just sits there. Tony isn't exactly complaining — his nerves are practically vibrating — but it is an odd reaction out of Rogers.
“And I’m sorry,” he says, voice cracking. “But I had to tell you. I had to.”
“This is for
Tony arches an eyebrow. Saying: “Problem?” because he's a dick like that.
Where Steve's staring at him.
Steve looks away. “No. No, I don't. This is… This is me, now.”
Steve checks the last question. He exhales.
“Aw, c'mon, J, you're as young as the both of us,” Tony protests. Jarvis sent him a knowing look.
“You want help getting out of that tight uniform, mister?” Tony asks lightly.
Tony interrupts because
Not okay. He needs to get out of here.
Tony sighs. “No soccer today, man, I got such — ”
Tony briefly raises an eyebrow. “Maybe. The only ass I've gotten tonight though is Cross's. Pull down your skirt, moron.”
“Tony?”
“Howard, please calm down, he still needs to explain himself — ”
true, Tony. You and your date are almost bound to have great…
They all spin to see Steve Rogers holding tight onto Rumlow's raised arm. His voice is low, dangerous.
Tony didn't stop on his trek upstairs. “The day apparently can get better. I'll do it right now.”
okay so i know that this chapter was honestly just more shit on the shit-cake that the last chapter presented, but next chapter has things looking vaguely better? sorry about the angst storm, everyone
suck it, Barnes) and Tony only barely restrains himself against finding a way to hack into Instagram to get a look at the guy's 36 posts without having to request a follow and look like a stalker.
“It worked!” Peter exclaims. He looks to be on the verge of fainting.
Tony's jaw clenches.
“What exactly are you apologizing for?” Tony teases, trying to portray being calm because holyshithe'smaintainingaconversationwithsteverogers.
Tony's brow furrows. “Uh… Yes? But how did you know that?”
Peter shrugs, cheeks a bit red. “Is Mr. Rhodes around the compound anywhere?”
that's stupid. And very starry-eyed, teenager-y, but —
Steve looks at him, momentarily surprised. Then grins wickedly.
Timely has leading technology.
Tony blinks as Steve disappears into the living room. Was he? Wow.
“I don't know, but FRIDAY said he told her that he was fine last night, and that he'd be here for the move-in,” Natasha explains. She flicks an eyebrow up, briefly. “Counting in the fact that all of Sam's, Bucky's, and my belongings were here before we even arrived and that Steve didn't show up last night…”
the meddlers for the evening, and just… Have dinner? Together?”
“Hey, did I ever get any uh, any matches?” He asks, motioning to the device.
Rhodey, although grudgingly, moves on.
Steve smiles before rolling out and throwing his shield at the nearest one, dropping them like a sack of rocks.
“Tony,” a warm voice fills his ears. “Merry Christmas, man.”
Tony explains the whole thing, happily, and, in an extra-hushed tone, recounts his night with Steve, which Rhodey uncharacteristically giggles at — Tony vows to tease him forever, but Rhodey just says, “I don’t even care, man! Kiss him the next time you see him!”
“Which movie marathon?”
Sam's heart sinks.
Who's next to Steve Rogers.
Howard.”
Jarvis is quiet.
It kinda goes completely relaxed. It's unbelievable. Tony doesn't think he's ever been this comfortable in a room with more than just him and Jarvis, Rhodey, or Pepper.
, Stevie.”
Judging by the look on Steve's face, that wasn't the best conversation to start either.
“Oh, baby.”
Romanoff gives a smirk. “We're all upset. Aren't we,
hours, Rogers,” he snorts. “I’ve gotta be honest with you, I wasn't planning on staying longer than twenty minutes.”
“What are those?” he asks curiously to Tony's growing collection of StarkPhones.
The room's tension instantly rackets up.
Tony smiles brightly in return and Steve's cheeks fluster in a…not unattractive way. Tony clears his throat, looking away to sit against the wall of Sarah's office.
Pepper slides in across from him. “Tomorrow night. Nine o'clock. Be there.”
“And for good reason,” Paul adds from behind Sarah, sliding his coat on.
Tony felt mystified.
“Risiletto, Ritten, Rockwell — Do not disturb my counting, Mr. Stark, and face forward until the assembly begins — Rockwell, Rogers — ”
Steve kind of beams at him as he nods enthusiastically, which makes Tony's heart kind of thud like thunder in his chest, and it's all kind of overwhelming.
Tony's heart seems to quicken at the sight of those wide, blue eyes he hasn't seen in so long.
Tony finally says: “Is it that incredulous of an idea?”
“Tony, if you want to, you can legally — ”
A good third of Tony's face feels numb from Howard hitting his bruised eye. Tony swallows.
come to
Tony gives a weak smile to the jaw-dropping gorgeous man in front of him. He's not sure that the man's smile will ever not make his heart stop.
“That’s really sweet, Tony, but…” Rogers visibly steels himself. “But I don't think you'd be offering if you were sober. And I don't want to take advantage of you.”
He looks at the picture. He looks at the red check next to the name.
“Moving from Timely kinda put everything into perspective. This... Being stupid was starting to look stupid. So that's why I punched out Hodge.” Tony exhales. “And, well... My dad didn't really like that I punched Gilmore Hodge. Or. He didn't really like my reasoning for punching Gilmore Hodge. So, uh.” He throws a fist at his own face. “A third of my face was numb for like a full day.”
Tony looks over at Rogers. Rogers is already looking his way. Tony smiles a bit.
A tornado of wrapping paper fills up the room. Tony tenderly tears away the corners of his. Inside, a soft, red knit sweater is wrapped around a box of Sarah’s fudge. Scott gasps from next to him.
Mr. Wilson gives him that look that Mr. Stark gives him when Peter successfully breaks into a government database he's not supposed to break into. It's a look that most mentors wouldn't react with in that situation.
Steve gives a short goodbye, mostly covered by Sam's, “You're our most frequent, not our favorite customer, Stark!”
“Okay?” Peter blink, surprised.
“Do you really think that
M'Baku lives in a rich neighborhood like most people Tony hangs out with — not that Tony's ever talked to M'Baku regularly, but the majority of Tony's acquaintances aren't exactly straining to make ends meet. With that in mind, there's a few things to know about these types of neighborhood — one being that, as long as you either have soundproof walls or that you don't cross that volume level of 75, trespass, or vandalize their homes, these people don't give a fuck about what you're doing on your own time. So sixteen-year-old Tony Stark, even being known state-wide, stumbling down the sidewalks in front of their houses that are yards upon yards away considering their fountains and driveways, obviously drunk, shouldn't prompt any attention.
“Well, whatever,” he scoffs. “There's always the tip jar. Oh! I do have one way you could totally repay me.”
Steve's head pops out of one of his shirt's holes. “You love it.”
Ty sends him a text simply saying:
Steve blinks. “What?”
In the morning, there are pictures of him shirtless and chugging a keg on MarvelUs.com, and the comments are exploding with appreciative remarks and phone numbers.
They're in Steve's car after Tony dropped his car off at his house and ran in to change very quickly — upon realizing he only had a handful of outfits in a duffel bag, he had had a two-second panic attack before throwing something on that had red on it (because hey, that's kind of festive, isn't it?) then ran outside after throwing on his jacket and grabbing his M&M's.
Sam blinks. “Me? Oh, me. Yeah, me. I mean —
Tony sighs, nodding. Jarvis straightens.
The backroom's door swings open and out storms Bucky Barnes, being held back by a struggling Sam Wilson. Tony takes a step back.
Romanoff smiles. “Guess.”
Sam makes a noise of protest. Natasha sighs. “Can’t we just see who it is, Sam?”
“No,” Steve whispers, smiling so brilliantly. “This is too perfect for a dream.”
He needs a drink.
Nat skillfully dodges Steve's attempts to peer at the StarkPad, but let's Bucky see it when he tries. Bucky spits out his juice, effectively soaking his magazine.
remember a 4-letter code) he swipes his ID over the scanner and gives the storage pull-up door a tug.
Sighing, he slides his glasses on and smiles at the few cameras loitering around the front of the gallery building. As soon as he sets foot in the building, he's being led somewhere else.
Tony doesn't say anything — he just nods.
“Let’s get the check,” he prompts. And Steve, hesitantly, nods.
Steve opens his mouth, but Sharon speaks over him. “Exactly!”
Tony screenshots it because if that's not art, then Mona Lisa can choke him.
was then the new status of Steve Rogers.
There's the post.
“And good riddance,” Nat fake-whispers to Sam before typing in a few things then scrolling along.
“Yes.”
Steve smiles, small but so happy. “I know. I’ll keep reminding you it is.”
Peter can't help but nod in agreement. Miss Gonzalez sounds like one of a kind, but there's still one last envelope, and apparently that's who Mr. Stark is even more compatible with, so...
Romanoff tsks. “I guess so. Definitely more than the amount that my touches will need.”
The phone vibrates once and half times before Steve has it open and against his ear.
“Tony,” Steve says, before clearing his throat. “Tony. Do you remember the Halloween party? M’Baku Jabari’s?”
Three of them blatantly smirk, while Vision does something with his face that is dangerously close to one.
Tony adamantly shakes his head. “Look, the song is ending, I'm not gonna just jump — ”
I know what you and Wanda like to do to new couples.”
Stone pulled a bucket of divided paint colors out of his own locker while Tony broke into Steve — Rogers's locker. Tony ignored the prickling in his eyes as Rumlow took the colorful canvas out of his locker.
The door swings open, and Tony turns to see a built man with long, dark hair and a frown on his face.
He hangs up and thunks his head on the back of the car seat, his hangover clouding his vision at the impact. He groans.
freak out, Parker.”
Tony stares at him. Then he looks at Steve. “I should leave.”
Steve shoots her a look. A ghost of a smile flickers across her lips.
Steve laughs, quiet but genuine. “Okay, uh… Just yesterday I realized that even if I eat a whole pizza, I still won't gain a pound. Just a stomach-ache.”
“We shouldn't have done this,” Peter bemoans.
Because it's Steve Rogers. Looking as lovely as ever. But he's looking at Tony. Tony, who is in old jeans, a very old, loose t-shirt, and a jacket with unwashed hair and bags underneath his eyes, singing a
Tony’s own face reacted in kind. “Enough to know that I came off as a total douchebag.”
It started when Rogers was first moved to Tony's town, and was enrolled in Tony's middle school. He, of course, was blessed with new kid disease, where everyone and everything revolves around the new kid until everyone figured out they were just a real person like everyone else. But for Rogers — it was maximized. Rogers is from Brooklyn in New York City, and he now lives in Timely. No one moves
“People like her, too, because she has a list of awards on here for humanitarian stuff. She also is one of the founders of the Forget the Face Foundation aka the FFF which has given out over five hundred sponsorships to minorities around America since it was made in 2001. Damn,
That was over two days ago. Steve's jaw tightens.
“Wilson, why're we in a broom closet?” he asks.
girls because of that stupid game, Spin the Bottle. The meeting with the engineers definitely could've gone better and Tony still hasn't been able to correct the code behind his first attempt at an AI. His parents promised a trip to California to visit Uncle Obie and the beach, but they still haven't visited, and with his mom in Germany and his dad working as much as he has been, Tony doesn't see the trip happening anytime soon.
So. Tony slaps himself twice in the face, then starts walking randomly.
out of this, Jarvis! You, too, Maria!”
Steve huffs. “
Rumlow grunts. “What was that whole thing about, anyway? Why'd they come at us then just leave like that?”
matches which is pretty good for a FlickLove user, and — ”
Barnes purses his lips, but his eyes radiate affection. “My bakery, my rules, Wilson!”
“Wouldn't miss it for the world,” she murmurs back. “Now, seriously. Go sit somewhere else, I need to talk to Sam and Bucky.”
Carter's jaw clenches, her eyes steeling over, dangerously, and Tony feels the tension racket. Rogers clasps a hand over Carter's wrist, restraining her, and opens his mouth, but the bell rings.
Rogers blinks, long, blonde lashes falling over bright, blue eyes. “I — Where's your car?”
Sam shakes his head. “No, guys, this could be
Tony's lips part.
“Guys, from FlickLove!” he hisses. Their eyes widen in realization. “Steve's got matches!”
getting over it,” Steve starts, voice stern and being a total
Barnes finally disentangles himself from the wrestling pile, and his eyes fly to under the tree. “Oh my fuck,” he says, “guys. Santa actually fucking came.”
“Same thing,” Sam shrugs.
The four smile, relieved. It's almost worth it.
“Having sex? No. Playing three hours of
“Why do you wanna touch them so much?” Rumlow challenges. Hammer tries to defend himself, but Ty's already talking over him.
Peter makes an aborted noise. Tony glances over, just in time to see Rhodey cutting Parker a stern look. Tony's eyebrows furrow.
They go by painfully fast.
Tony clears his throat. “Steve took pity on me and picked me up from a gas station where I was about to get zits from hell from a boatload of candy.”
Tony knows he sent a silly, big smile back, but c'mon. He was helpless to do much else. Besides, he easily could've been sending it to Darcy Lewis who was behind Rogers, you never know.
“‘Well, you finding the Mandarin all on your own was also — ”
Natasha Romanoff peers down her nose at them, intrigued, with Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes behind her, ordering something at the counter.
He smiles brightly before rushing off, and the nurse watches him off. Tony clears his throat, and her eyes flick over to him.
Steve laughs, bright and happy. “Yes, I will marry you, Tony Stark.”
“Okay, guys, this first one is someone he's compatible with, but the last one is the one he's the
company in one of the most redneck states in the country, and Ty's dad owns a hunter apparel one — as long as they don't start advocating gun control laws, their families will be fine for a long time.
“What does it say?” Vision inquires, attempting to peer over the top of Peter's phone screen.
And his mom works for Tony's dad. Whoa. Nurse Rogers's accent makes more sense now.
Sarah nods. “Smart man. For anyone, chocolate is the way into their heart. C'mon, son.”
“Steve,” Tony interrupts, exasperated, “I kind of totally imposed, remember? It’s okay.”
“What do we say back?”
Happy gives him a look before driving away. Tony should hire better employees, this disrespect is unfathomable.
Tony's chest aches and he slowly pulls away from Steve. “I — What do you mean?”
“Stop doing that,” Tony scolds the bot in front of him, whose arm is moving wildly. “This is why you'll remain unnamed and unmade forever, you're uncooperative.”
,” Tony finishes, and they let the song carry on.
“Soccer practice is already in runs, so I unfortunately cannot indulge like you. Maybe I'll try half,” Tony jokes. Steve snorts between a laugh in a way that makes Tony's heart hurt. “But either way I'd probably gain like. Fifteen pounds.”
Steve mournfully rubs DUM-E’s claw, staring morosely at the bot’s clunky body. DUM-E made a dejected chirp in reply.
she's got a red check by her name.”
Sam bridles. “It's not just 'a dating app', Steve! It's
Peter gives a grin at that. “Come on, Mr. Stark. You'd never let that stop you.”
As if on cue, a group of engineers Tony was just talking to a little over thirty minutes ago start heading to his dad's office. Some of them wave, friendly, at Tony, while others ignore him completely. The nurse steps over next to him.
“Uh, yeah, shit, sorry — ” Tony fumbles his black Amex card out, handing it to Steve, who attempts to take it quickly, but their fingers brush, and Tony barely reigns in a gasp.
Tony must make some sort of noise because the blonde laughs. “You like that, hm, Tony?” she purrs.
Tony. I'm very flattered with this entire ordeal, but I can't say I expected this.
physically
“Okay,” Steve murmurs. He grabs an M&M packet off of a shelf, grins wider at Tony, then starts toward the cash register. Tony is helpless to do anything but follow.
Judging by how much Tony ate of his dinner, he doesn't celebrate it much either.
Everyone's comfortably settled in and under blankets when Romanoff finally gets to start the movie. Steve turns off the lights, turns on the Christmas tree lights then squishes himself between Barnes and Wilson, who are both shoveling different types of pizza into their mouths. Next to Barnes is Romanoff, who lays with her feet dangling off the edge of the sofa as she eats the triple meat slices contently. Thor is sprawled over the floor with one of the pepperoni pizza boxes next to him and Lang has made some sort of nest for himself to sit in on the armchair while he devours slice after slice. Banner is still sitting cross-legged next to Tony on the loveseat while munching on some cheese pizza. Despite their original argument, they all seem quite enamored by the movie.
Tony blinks. “I’m — I can sleep on the floor if…”
Eventually, he stretches his fingers and sighs, catching Steve’s attention from where he was poking a holographic globe. Tony smiles, lazily, and Steve straightens, eyes focused entirely on Tony. “What is it?”
Steve looks at him, then at Nat, then at Bucky, who grunts and shrugs.
Tony stiffens. Relaxes. “I’m not. But that's what people will expect. So calm down. What do you wanna do about Hammer?”
“Okay, Tony.”
Cross and Hammer are being spotted by the football coach right now in order to give Rumlow, Stone, and Tony a proper alibi.
Mr. Stark frowns, attention skewed as he zones in on Peter. “Something wrong, kid? We can push the date back if you're not ready, I mean — There are some things that can be done to the compound before they come which, now that I'm thinking about it, are probably
Rogers mutters something to Carter, and they walk away without another word. Tony can see Carter rubbing the back of Rogers’ hand, eyes reassuring.
Steve's still talking.
Nat hums. “So far, yeah, but let's see the last one. This is supposed to be super good, right?”
hey, long time no see :( i always first wanna apologize about my lack of replying to comments - i read each one, and they really do fuel this story!! i probably would've given up on it awhile ago without all of you commenters :)
Romanoff sighs. She slides her phone over to him.
It's well into the movie, John Candy is threatening the asshole boyfriend with a drill or something, when Lang starts staring at him, unsubtly and curiously.
“I hate broken records,” Tony says easily, but it's a thinly veiled threat to just get on with what Hammer's trying to say. Darren Cross snorts from where he's lounging on Ty's bed.
Steve pokes Tony harder. “Aw, c'mon, Tony, this time it's just a Christmas song, not a teenage girl bemoaning the loss of her boyfriend.”
Steve flushes. “Sorry, that made no sense at all, did it?”
His eyes fell shut to Steve Rogers smiling. He rather liked it.
The place where Steve finally got to take Tony after a lot of fruitless attempts.
they're going to
“I — ” Steve's stuttering again. “Tony.”
“This is bullying,” he protests, but he stands and hugs Carter. “I'm glad you could make it.”
“Circumstances?” Tony interrupts. “What circumstances?”
“You can,” Peter says, so quick that it's almost instinctive. He flushes, but doesn't back down. “I — Mr. Stark, you can do
The blonde laughs. “Cute?”
“Is — Is that an option?” Steve murmurs, then he seems to snap himself out of it. “Wait — No. No, we can
When Steve and Tony are out of the car, it's snowing again. Steve looks up at the falling snow and gives it a smile that Tony's never seen on him before.
“W-Well,” Bruce stammers. “We kind of… Wanted that to be a surprise. Yeah. It's much more pressure on you if you have expectations of this person.”
Rumlow cackled as he raced out to the soccer fields, Stone following shortly. Tony followed, too.
for guidance, I do agree that I should maybe... Try and date someone, or, uh. Y'know. So I will voluntarily do the questionnaire thingy with you all.”
“Aw, come on, J, he wasn't baby-sitting me!” Tony refutes, flustered.
is noticing.
because he's kind of a dork underneath all of the grumpy attitudes. Tony still sits next to Steve, who does indeed devour a lot of the ice cream, at a concerning rate. When he catches Tony watching him, his cheeks flame red and he visibly tries to slow down. Tony silently imitates him wolfing it down. Steve turns a darker red and kicks him in the shin. Tony laughs, and Wilson throws half a rice crispy treat at him for "disturbing the movie".
Vision, Mr. Rhodes, and Dr. Banner make an 'ahh' sound.
Most people don't laugh. It’s generally silent, and everyone (
Stupid, purple aliens.
His mom sighs. “Tony, if you could help us and go over what happened — ”
Ugh, not that nickname, I swear to God, Tony.
“Rhodey!” Tony gapes, his face burning hot.
But Romanoff brushes him off. “Don't worry, boys,” she tells them, smiling. “We won't touch you. Unless you
“Oh my god,” Scott squeaks.
When they're outside (Steve didn't even try to fight over the bill, seemingly remembering the ten-minute argument they shared last time), Steve waves Tony away with a smile, and they both call their rides.
The woman nods instantly. “Yes, sir. There are no other reservations in your section of the dining area, as due to your requests over the phone.”
Steve huffs at that, smiling still. “Nah. I only came here to get. Well. M&M's.”
And that's saying something, right?
Tony feels his heart speed up as she walks away. He spares a glance at Steve, who's looking longingly at his mother's retreating back.
Hammer's staring at Tony. “Are you really gonna let Rogers go a year without a prank when he's just told the whole school he's a queer?”
Tony laughed before wandering over. “I don't know, Rogers, you look pretty comfy.”
Sam Wilson moved to Timely in freshman year and was immediately admitted to the Varsity basketball team since he can basically fly across the court. He had an entire school of admirers and a team that loved him. He could be friends with
. She uh, she’s actually worked with Mhmm sometimes.” He gnaws his lip. “To be honest, I think she's the head of his prosthetics division.”
“Sing louder,” Steve murmurs, an excited look dancing across his features.
“We're all here?” Peter asks, counting heads.
“We're gonna go home, eat this melting ice cream, then get a full night's rest, okay, sweetheart?” Steve murmurs into Tony's hair. He smiles wider as Tony sighs softly at the endearment like he always does when Steve uses it.
“Anyway,” Peter continues. “They go through all their eligible people, apparently, and make sure that Mr. Stark will get nearly exactly who he's looking for. Rumor has it that people have gotten no matches because FlickLove's honest enough to tell them that they need to clean up their act.”
Ty's eyebrows shoot up. Tony bites the inside of his cheek.
Tony's eyebrows furrow before he shrugs. “Good for you.”
“Tony, there's something you need to see,” Rumlow grins at him.
Tony gives him a short smack on the ass. Barnes yells. “Go make me coffee, hot stuff, and maybe you'll get my number.”
Steve sulks more.
Peter shows a picture of the woman, and the three men chew over the information, before motioning on for the next match.
Sam groans. “He’s typing. Oh my god, I haven't been this nervous since sophomore year in high school when Keyana Leans offered me 'a fun time’.”
. And that's pretty much it.”
Barnes rolls his eyes and tries to barrel through, but Steve puts a hand on his chest and smiles at Tony through barred teeth. “Tony, this is James Barnes, but everyone calls him Bucky. Buck, this is Tony Stark.”
Glancing, surprised, at each other, everyone takes his word for it. After they've all picked a sundae, Mr. Wilson starts telling them about how Mr. Rogers agreed to go on FlickLove and Peter relaxes a bit. Eventually he tells them how he tricked Mr. Stark into doing it, and that makes them all laugh.
“Well? Go! Call Steve tonight, he's free on Friday, so ask him then,” Bucky informs. “Now, get outta my bakery.”
On top of all of it, Steve's 'blind date’ is at
“Tons!” Sam insists. “Steve, you lived with a robot butler for years!”
Sarah's voice carries from the kitchen. “Steve, get the door and tell Thor that he is not allowed in this kitchen until I say so!”
Tony blinks. Chuckles. “I — C'mon, Howard, it's my junior year. I can — I can stay here for one more year. When I graduate, I'll go to a different school then State, then come work for the new company. But you don't
move in to the compound. They're all kind of awesome — like Mr. Stark-level of awesome.
Tony looks over, and feels his heart tighten at the blue eyes that peer at him, concerned, in the dark.
Tony bites back a laugh. Apparently, Darlene, Sam's mother, usually buys the presents, but since she's currently overseas the responsibility fell to Paul, who sorta botched it with all of the Legos he spent his money on. Tony tried to say that perhaps Steve really would like the Lord of the Rings set he got for him since Tony knows that Steve used to like the books back in seventh grade, but Sarah quickly shut the idea down with her uproar of laughter.
Steve's beam turns a hundred times brighter and Tony feels his chest tighten almost uncomfortably.
Seconds later, hands grip the back of their chairs, centimeters away from their heads. Ty, previously careless of Hammer's predicament, abruptly looks over to Tony, opening his mouth. Natasha Romanoff's face appears between their heads, her red hair pulled back in a fiery bun.
