Sam looks up when Dean approaches. Nods.
“I’m not passing along our godforsaken Winchester DNA, Dean. And you’re the last person I should have to explain that to.”
So cold and lifeless. Sam touched his forehead to Dean’s one more time, the heat of his tears meeting the cold flesh of Dean’s face. Had anyone ever been so lonely?
He feels ambivalent about going. He doesn’t know if he wants to be in the middle of a lake with his dad—not after their weird conversation earlier in the day (plus whatever details Dad picked up from eavesdropping on the conversation with Mom—how in God’s name is he expected to sit in a boat with his dad just hours after he overheard him crying to Mom about having kissed his not-quite “partner”? Will they talk about it at all, or will it just hang in the air, like an unacknowledged fart?)—but almost immediately, he gets another text message.
Sam is so exhausting.
Sam thanks her again and tells her he appreciates her offer, but he’s fine. All he needs is time.
Cas’s voice.
“It took a while.”
“Yes it is.”
“Please. Just let me call my doctor. Maybe she can set up a telemedicine appointment. And like … eat something.”
It hits him all at once, the wrongness of what happened with Cas.
Sam raised an eyebrow. “That’s a bad thing?”
Heaven is better … but the Empty is more honest. The Empty is real. They’re all headed for the Empty in one way or another—some people just get to have better dreams.
, I don’t know.”
needed a mother.”
“You diddled a human and fathered a nephil?” Metatron said. “Jesus, Cas, you really have gone native.”
Miracle is no longer interested in the stick. He’s in the middle of the field, sniffing for something.
Sam hesitates. “Maybe.” He shrugs. “I’m gonna call our contacts in Southeast Asia. There’s a Men of Letters chapter in Singapore. Maybe they know things we don’t. But … it’s probably nothing paranormal or cosmic or whatever. New viruses emerge in nature all the time. A few make the leap from animals to humans. AIDS, Ebola, Spanish Flu …. Plus, if it was a supernatural thing … don’t you think the mortality rate would be a lot higher?”
section of the afterlife, after the crap you pulled? Through the
“About Eileen. What the fuck, Sammy.”
Back then, he told Mary that she belonged on earth. And he was certain of it at that time. But now he wouldn’t say the same thing. “To send him back now—it might be cruel.”
Once Daniel disappears, Gabriel turns back to Cas. “They’re weird. They are so fuckin’ weird. Makes you miss the days when we just played harps and smote dragons.”
“These are the top five stressors a person can go through. In their whole lives. We hit all of them this year. Except the divorce thing.”
“He made a deal with …
It was strange—the first time he’d been in the Empty, it was quiet and dark and cavernous. So lonely. But when he arrived the last time—for his permanent death—the Empty wasn’t just mind-numbing; it was actively painful. Everyone was awake. He was assailed by the regrets and shattered hopes and fears of every angel and demon he’d put in that place.
Cas tries to look up just enough to gesture to Gabriel that he’ll be there, but it’s no use. Gabriel sees his face.
“Don’t second-guess yourself. You were right. The way I treated that kid. You think it’s something I don’t think about? All day, every goddamn day? I have to live with it.”
“I know he’s God now, Cas. But he’s still a kid who needs a dad. Everyone does, you know that as much as we do. And Sam and me? We can’t be there for him, not like that. But you can. And down here? You’d miss him, I know you’d miss him as much as he’d miss you … and … I know what it's like to miss you.” He’s crying, and it’s Cas’s turn to comfort him again.
“Here at least he has the opportunity to find rest.”
“Am I back at the house?”
Jack took a deep breath. “Last year, when I died, the Empty came after me. It was tearing apart heaven to get to me—” He shook his head slightly. “He traded himself for me. Told the Empty to take him instead. And the Empty agreed, but …”
He slumps out of the room. Even in this new version of heaven, Metatron is the most annoying celestial being he’s encountered in his three-point-six billion years of being an angel.
“I saw him a while back. Around the time heaven changed.” She smiled. “He asked for my forgiveness. There was no need, of course.” She paused. “Just as there’s no need for you to ask Castiel to forgive you.”
“I still regret it, Dean. Just as you have your regrets. Even so, we don’t love each other any less. Why do you think things with Cas … would be so different? That he wouldn’t love you as completely as you love him? Or wouldn’t want to see you? Surely you know that’s not true. Just look around at this place. He and Jack made it for you.”
“Dean,” Sam whispered.
. A plain enough declaration.
He goes back to bed. This time Sam seems to back off, reassured that Dean isn’t hiding a case of bat flu or a pointy object.
“And never when I’m intending to be.”
Sam just grins. “I can scratch that off my bucket list.”
“Okay, me neither. Never liked the fuss anyway.”
“You bet.”
They all slide into the booth together. Cas thinks it might make more sense if he sat on the aisle, but Dean’s clearly in his protective mode, so he takes the seat by the wall again.
“You gotta be shitting me.
“I’m not supposed to be in your world, Dean. But … I’ve been human before. And—”
tried. It wasn’t for nothing.” She gave him a small smile. “What’s next for you?”
“His current state?”
“Cas, I have to apologize,” Jack says. “I haven’t been completely honest with you.”
Cas can feel nothing but the warmth of Dean’s tears against his skin. He holds Dean as he sobs.
“It’s called a spreadsheet, Cas.”
“You don’t?”
Back when he was alive, Dean imagined what he’d say to Cas when Cas returned. At first, he really thought Cas would return—that he’d wake up in the morning and dude would just be there, at the foot of his bed, and he’d say,
Dean looked up and just nodded. Then he went back to staring at the photographs.
“That’s not my bag. Smoking is bad for you.”
He looks at Sam who looks … awful. He looks like he’s just seen a village burned to the ground.
“What about for angels? I mean, with other angels.”
“The movie I thought was saddest was
“Well, me.”
He shrugged. “I don’t know, Hannah. I’m a soldier. I’ll go where I’m needed most. But in any case,” he says, sitting on the bench overlooking the valley beneath them, “I’m not back to full capacity yet. I wouldn’t be of use to anyone right now.”
you for that. right? Right? You have to know that.”
Dean nodded, his eyes glassy. Sad and red-rimmed from both too much alcohol and stress. “I know, man. I don’t know why I do half the things I do. It’s like, I’m not even me sometimes.”
And now he sensed a presence in the doorway. He looked up. Cas. “Hey,” he said. Good thing he’d had so many beers; if not, he might actually be embarrassed to be so misty-eyed over old photographs.
Dean laughs. “True. From sunup to sundown, you were a pain in my ass. By the time Jack came around, my reservoir was depleted.” He gives Sam’s shoulder another squeeze that’s both hard and impossibly affectionate. This is his brother at his most generous, his most unguarded. Even though he’s been through hell, literally—and is now gloriously alive and healthy, with a festival full of pie at his disposal—he’d still rather talk about Sam’s problems.
“I know you will. But Cas.” He puts his hand on Cas’s forearm. “What’s going on? What is this really about? What happened to you yesterday?”
“No, Dean. That’s not how—that’s not what happened to me.” He opens his eyes and looks down at Dean in his arms.
“Hey,” he said.
“Dean! Dean!” someone is calling. Someone that sounds like Sam. Dean can’t find Sam anywhere. Then he realizes that Sam is inside the tornado Empty, swirling round and round. And the tornado is approaching Cas and Meg (who’s no longer dressed like a clown but a nun), and they’re trying to get away but the sandpit is too difficult to escape—
doesn’t get a call. Dean does. He rifles through the glove compartment to find the buzzing cell. Holds it to his ear. “Hello?”
Dean doesn’t know what to say. He’s both grateful to Cas and insanely pissed at him for making such a shit deal. Heartbroken that Cas suffered. Angry with himself for not being able to save Cas, and for allowing their friendship to get to the point where the Empty could weaponize it. Furious with Chuck for the entirety of the whole fucking thing.
“‘Love means never having to say you’re sorry,’” Daniel says. “That’s what we learned, though Anna tells us that’s just not true.”
“So you noticed.” He manages a smile. “Yeah, our regular Mary Sunshine.”
When Cas stood in the threshold, Dean wondered if they were going to hug again. But Cas turned away, and Dean said goodnight before quietly closing the door.
He looked up at Cas, his vision blurry. When his voice came, it was barely louder than a whisper. Rawer than he expected. Not as raw as he felt.
“She actually dies in the beginning,” Metatron says. “But that’s beside the point.” He holds out his hands, a fruitless gesture. “We always think that humans should get more time.
When he pulls away, Cas’s eyes are still closed. Then he opens them slowly, as if being pulled from sleep.
“So you can blow yourself up?”
you.” He pauses. “They weren’t moving on, Cas. From you. Dean
He senses a presence in the doorway. Before he can turn his head, Gabriel says, “Hey, Hannah. How’s it shakin’? Do you want me to deal you in?”
A flicker of memory—the moment the Empty overplayed its hand. It confronted him with a leviathan. A
As if realizing she’d asked too much, she withdrew her hands, set them on her lap. “I’m sorry.”
“Yeah,” Dean says, his voice barely audible.
He continues his secret ritual through the holiday season. He goes into Cas’s room every night, sometimes bringing Miracle with him. They lie on the bed together. But he no longer listens to the iPod. It’s lost its charge, and of course he doesn’t have a way to recharge it.
concerned. He shows up at Dean’s door every few hours, knocking and wanting to be let in. “You’re not sick, are you? You can tell me if you are, Dean. Please.”
Sam would wonder how much he prayed, how he begged. How he wanted that portal to open back up, to take him too.
As Jack stands to leave, Cas reaches out to touch his arm. “I never thanked you properly,” he says.
The world is now light on monsters and heavy on miracles.
Jack’s a proponent of therapy, and Cas knows that’s what this really is. This—all this father-son bonding shit in the middle of American nowhere—exists to give Cas a space to process things so he can move on. Because that’s what helped Jack move on, back when he lived on earth.
“So?”
“Hmm.”
Sam sighs. “It’s really not your business, but yeah. I was having panic attacks. So I went to see the doctor. She prescribed me those.”
He realizes that Dean misinterpreted his dying words, just as Cas had once misinterpreted what the Empty had told him. He hates how those words must have injured Dean. He’d intended them as salve.
Cas barely hesitates, leaning forward again to press his lips against Dean’s. And they’re kissing again, but this time more slowly. More involved.
He wonders. “Metatron is right in that I
“You too.” He steps back, gives Malachi’s arm a firm pat. “Is this—?” He gestures to the restaurant.
But Cas isn’t all that trusting anymore, and what Dean’s saying is nothing he hasn’t thought about himself. Angels have free will now, and he wonders how they’ll use it. He still doesn’t trust angels like Ishim and Raphael. He supposes others don’t trust him. “At least Michael and Raphael don’t have so much power anymore.”
He walks toward the back of the store, checking out the frozen section, which emanates a slight chill. “Cas?”
He remembers why having a heart is important when Jack comes to see him. Jack—his beautiful child, his reason for still being here. And now his God, a God in whom he can finally put his faith.
wasn’t moving on. He kept trying to bring you back.”
“Cas, I know.” Dean keeps holding Cas’s hand, but he reaches up to smooth down Cas’s suit with his other hand. “You don’t have to explain. I know this shit isn’t Jack’s doing. Sam knows too.”
, Dean thinks.
“Yes. He’s back from the Empty, and he’s safe.”
“Okay, okay.” She’s trying to calm him now. “Keep in mind that time moves differently in heaven. I know—it’s hard to get used to at first. It was hard for me at first, too. It went very slowly, and then it went fast. Once I saw Jack—”
Dean looks at him, perplexed. “I haven’t been hungry since I got here. I thought that was one of the perks of being dead—never being hungry.”
This is all they have. It’s all they’ve ever had.
Word of Dean Winchester’s death travels fast among the angels. It makes its way through Wing Town and the rehabilitation facilities and the groundskeeping entities and the Center of Actuarial Control. But by then it’s already been on angel radio.
“Most don’t desire it. Some do. But our true forms aren’t—I mean, it’s different. I wouldn’t know, but … most angels don’t feel emotions like that. Those of us who do learned emotions from living among humans.”
“If everyone around you deserves redemption, Cas, then why do you think you don’t?”
Metatron sighs again, his entire body a pantomime version of extreme exasperation. “Are you shitting me?
“What?”
And now that he had what he needed most—what he’d apparently
But it wouldn’t be like that. Because being human isn’t like that, not all the time. Being human means the inevitability of suffering. Of growing old, of dying, whether of cancer or a car accident or a virus. Of watching Cas die, again. Or of Cas watching
Dean says he doesn’t want to know the details of Sam’s new life. He trusts that Sam will be fine, that he’ll arrive soon, and that when he does so he’ll have stories from his life—stories that Dean can hear for the first time.
Dean steps a few inches back and, propping one hand on the wall above Cas’s head, laughs. His whole body shakes. “Cas, I’m sorry,” he says, smiling so hard that it’s contagious. “I don’t know if it’s the things you say or the way you say them, but you never stop making me laugh.”
It’s damn frustrating to not be able to avoid certain things, like climbing steps and having awkward stop-and-chats with certain angels.
Sam is still, trying to process this information.
“Where is everybody?”
He looks at Dean’s CDs and cassette tapes. (Dean: the only person in the word to still own cassettes.)
He gets a reply in less than an hour.
. A bit of Bobby Singer understatement.
No pressure? Who is this person and what has he done with his father? Maybe heaven has a mellowing effect on all the Winchesters—except Dean. What the crap.
“He’ll be here soon enough. Humans don’t last very long. And then you two can be together again.” She smiles. The idea seems to please her.
Sam comes into the kitchen one day. Sees Dean on his laptop (luckily Dean is positioned in a way so that Sam can’t see the rows of dating profiles Dean’s scrolling through).
“Ambriel—” He sighs while collecting himself. He doesn’t even know where to begin. The human world is what’s weirder than theirs when it comes to these things. Complicated. If angels desire companionship (and most don't, at least not on that level), they just pair off.
John tucks his hands in his jacket pockets, seems to falter a little. “You’re looking for this, um, friend. This Castiel. I know.”
“Is this is your favorite pickup line?” Dean said, “If so, I can tell you there might be a reason you’re as ‘lucky’ as you want to be.”
“It was my fault. I woke Cas from the Empty once before. This threw it into chaos. What was supposed to be an eternal resting place for non-human entities became vengeful and merciless. I have since tried to restore order there. But—” His gaze intensified. “By the time I reached the Empty, I couldn’t find Castiel anywhere.”
He doesn’t have a heart.
This time they’re slower, more relaxed. They take their time, figuring each other out.
Or fathers, in Jack’s case.
Everyone looks up. Metatron is sitting in the corner. He hasn’t said much until now.
Dean doesn’t know how much time passes. He just knows that what he and Cas do together feels good and important. So good. And good for Cas, too. Dean touches him in a way that elicits moans, quiet gasps. Dean gets him to come. Twice. A third time. Dean comes as well. And again. At one point they figure out how to come together, Cas shuddering into his mouth, squeezing his shoulder hard, Dean’s hand wrapped around Cas’s ass.
decide how time in heaven moves. Or how you want to perceive time.”
. Certainly not ‘paradise on earth.’ And you? You turned out just like Dad. Maybe worse, because even Dad wouldn’t have—” Sam stops himself.
When he returns to the bench, he’s hoping Dean will change the subject. But he doesn’t. Instead, his body is angled toward Sam, even though he’s still got the enormous fucking box of pie in his lap. “Tell me what really happened with Eileen.”
Sometimes he even misses
“That’s big of you.”
In his car, he turns the ignition and flips on the radio, trying not to think about how long it’s been since that Lady Gaga song was popular and everywhere and in-fucking-escapable. 2008? ’09?
“I mean, you two,” Anna said, pointing to Malachi and Bartholomew, “you’re psychopaths. And there’s Metatron, who for no good reason apparently staged a coup and cast all the angels out of heaven. Gadreel’s responsible for the suffering of all mankind. And you, Castiel.” She made a noise of disgust. “I can’t even look at you.” She paced. “And what did I do? Oh, that’s right. I wanted to be a human girl. Wow. So I'm apparently among one of the people angels hate most. So round me up and send me to Guantanamo with heaven’s most reviled. Gotta love those double standards. That angelic misogyny.”
All winter, Dean would get drunk and fall asleep in odd places. Sam would find him on the floor in Cas’s room. In Jack’s room. And most often of all, in the crypt where Cas had conjured the Empty. The dog would be with him, curled against his side.
Or Cas would call him on his cellphone, and to make sure it wasn’t someone else, someone like Lucifer, he’d say,
He has to admit that he’s partial to angels like this—angels who are painfully blunt and artless. As he once was.
“Hello, Dean.”
“Dean? This is Dr. Vallens. Is everything okay? I haven’t heard from you in a while.”
,” Sam says, but he’s sort of laughing.
“Dean.” She takes a step toward him, but he holds out his hand as if to stop her.
“Of course I’ll come if you want me to,” Sam says as though sensing what Dean is thinking. “Maybe I’ll rope Eileen in as well.”
Now he wishes he had that moment back. He wishes he could have said, “I love you, Cas.” But he didn’t say those words to anyone, not even Sammy.
Then he stops laughing. “But I know what you mean. I always thought of myself as an unlucky asshole. But I wasn’t. And I didn’t know that. I didn’t appreciate how lucky I’d been to get you resurrected some eighty-seven and a half times, until that one time when you didn’t come home.” He clutches the arm that Cas has draped over him, runs his thumb along Cas’s elbow. “I really thought you’d show again, and I’m not exactly a glass-half-full kinda guy.”
He looked out at the landscape around them, so much beauty, and knew there was no answer he could give her that she wanted to hear.
“There’s a Geneva chapter?”
Cas had tried to reason with his brothers and sister about their bickering.
“May 18
His friends. Yes, he has angel friends. Who would have thought it? He can’t imagine telling Dean about his weird angel wannabe-human friends. “Yes,” he breathes, and just like that, he’s back.
“For what?”
He lets himself remember those last minutes in the bunker, the horror on Dean’s face.
But things were far more complicated. Yes, he preferred Sam and Dean. Yes, he loved Dean more than he’d ever loved anyone in his long, long life. But he also sided with them because he knew—and he felt this deeply—that they were trying to do the right things. The hard things. The things that set them against other humans, other forces, and all the power of authority.
“It’s Castiel’s fault this place is a shitshow,” Malachi said. “He woke that bitch up.”
“Yeah,” Sam says. He knows Dean carries a lot of guilt about Jack—about the things he said in the end. There’s so much they didn’t get to do with Jack.
“And?”
Cas looked down at Gadreel. Then he turned to Metatron. “Time to change the narrative. When they bust in tonight …” He could hear them drawing closer. “When they come for us, one of us needs to wrestle a shiv away from them.”
He sat down next to her.
He hates Excel, but he’s been using it since college. First he used it to keep track of his assignment deadlines. Then he used it to keep track of law school application deadlines. Then, later, he used it to keep track of everything else. The location of every confirmed active vampire nest in the country. The location of every
In loamy late-winter evenings—that part of the year when everything is damp and brown but not so dark—Dean would take the dog to walk around the pond, and what he thought about saying to Cas would eventually change. The words he chose would become less self-protective, less edgy, less insouciant. Until they were simply:
Sprawled on his back and staring up at Dean, Jimmy Novak appears stunned at first. Then he looks pissed. In the same space of time, Dean goes from elation to confusion to realization to massive, massive disappointment.
He worries that if they’re “intimate” again, he’ll change his mind about Cas becoming human, but it’s fine—it turns out to be fine, it’s sweet and gentle and they make it last as long as they can.
Dean picks up his coffee. “Absolutely nothing. You guys come here a lot?”
.” His voice cracks.
“Celestials aren’t supposed to sleep, either. And yet you did plenty of that.”
“Intimate” is how he puts it to Dean. They’re kissing each other, and Cas is against the wall, and they’re kissing some more, and Dean unbuttons Cas’s shirt and slides it off, and then takes off his own shirt, and presses them together at the waist, and Cas pulls his lips away for a moment to say, “Are we—are we going to be intimate? I mean, sexually.”
“I need you to go see Sammy. Or make contact with him in some way. Meet him in a dream, give him a sign, anything.”
This wasn’t purgatory or hell—places Dean had been—but someplace he could never imagine. Eternal. He thinks of Jack’s words:
Sam closes his laptop. “I’ll just tell her we can’t. She’ll probably be relieved.”
, Mom. My best friend. And not on the cheek. I kissed him like—” He stops, wondering how much detail he has to use here. Does he have to mention there was tongue involved? A little bit of force? (He thinks about Cas’s turn as the pizza man. It wasn’t
“Dean was still a young man.”
“It just wouldn’t be the same without—” He clears his throat and sits up. “I mean, Jody’ll want to see us. And I just want us to be on the same page about that. So we don’t seem rude. Or ruder than we usually are.”
Cas grimaces. His head is splitting. He knows he’s on the brink of saying some terrible things, but it’s like he’s in a barrel going over a waterfall and it’s too late to turn back.
No, he hadn’t meant to betray his brothers and sisters the way he did, to cause them suffering; it was just something that
When they were about halfway home, Sam glanced in the rearview mirror to see Dean slumped against Cas’s shoulder, even though he was still awake. Cas’s arm was around him, loosely clutching Dean's shoulder. Occasionally he touched Dean's head, his hair. Sam didn't know for sure, but he thought Dean's hand was resting on Cas's abdomen. Maybe holding his other hand.
Dean almost can’t contemplate this moment. It’s theater of the fucking absurd. Here he is, talking to the mighty John Winchester about his angel partner.
“Huh? I sure as shit didn’t want to be driving around in what looked like the bumfuck American Midwest and Pacific Northwest for days on end. Trust me. That wasn’t my idea of a good time.”
he thinks.
. Listen to me. I—I’m billions of years old. I didn’t even know what happiness was until I met you. Only in those last twelve years did I
Miracle brings the stick back. Dean throws it again.
“Guilt,” Metatron said. “We feel guilty. We share similar regrets. So the Empty—”
“Well thank you so much for sharing that, Dr. Oz.”
is difficult right now when
Sam just pulls him closer.
“Hey Casanova,” Gabriel says from the doorway. “
Jack continues to stare at him. “I don’t know what to tell you, Dean. It really hasn’t been that long. Definitely not a month. But time in heaven, it moves—”
Dean presses his palms together even harder. “Is that why he—I mean, I prayed to him constantly. Is that why he never answered? Because he didn’t want me to be dead?”
“I’ve been better lately.”
. And still you forgave me. And
? And does “coming out” as a concept even exist in heaven? He hasn’t given it much thought. On earth, during those last months he was alive, he would lie awake at night and wonder what possessed him to kiss Cas in the first place, what triggered him to feel that way. About a man. He'd find himself uncomfortably hard, just thinking about.
“Dean.” Sam touches his brother’s forearm. “It's fine. You don’t have to tell me. It’s—it’s not—”
didn’t. But we’re trying.” He cleared his throat again. “It took a long time, last time. But he came back. And—and with Jack now doing what he does … we’re hopeful.”
“Did I see a cat?” Hannah asked when Cas led her outside to the terrace.
? Well, in one word: Dean. Dean safe. Forever. The opportunity to love Dean, and be loved by him at the same time. To be with him in all ways. Both of them together forever. Without a care in the world.
“That experience is unique to the human condition," Daniel says. “Humans are incredibly brave in that regard. Knowing they could die at any time, but choosing to carry on anyway. Still hoping. Finding meaning."
Dean gasps into his mouth. Twitches away, out of reflex, but then surges forward again. And after a few moments of that, he reaches between them and steadies Cas’s hand. “We really should lie down.”
He wonders if Federico’s arms are something he’d be able to fall into at the end of the day. And if so, how nice that would be.
His heart started beating harder. “And I—I betrayed friends.” He glanced at Anna. “I released the leviathan into the world, killed thousands of my own kind. Did I redeem myself? I don’t know. I still don’t know. But I’m not the worst things I’ve ever done. None of us is.”
Castiel understood the sentiment. It certainly gelled with the purpose of this new heaven: You took the forgiveness that others gave you and passed it on. Again and again.
Dean remembers when Sam went to college, tries to ignore the pang. Then he thinks about teaching Jack to drive and do other teenagery things, and how much it meant to him.
“It all sounds pretty intense,” Dean says. “Like Northern Ireland. Or post-genocide Rwanda. Hope it works out.”
“I know, it’s quite odd,” Cas says.
“Good,” Dean whispers. He rubs his hand along Cas’s arm. “You are one brave sonofabitch, let me tell you. Don't let anyone tell you different. Never met anyone like you when it comes to that stuff.”
Cas did have an oldie, though—Heart’s “Alone,” the 1980s power ballad. Dean preferred seventies-era Heart, but those women were babes regardless of the decade. And he’d always had a weakness for that song, in the same way he had weakness for Air Supply’s entire oeuvre. Too bad he and Cas hadn’t talked about it—it was another thing they could have bonded over.
rather than, I don’t know,
“Sure, Dean. Anything you need.”
He steadies himself against his desk.
When Sam prepared Dean for the pyre, he dressed him in his favorite clothes. Then he went into Dean’s room and found what he needed: the jacket with Cas’s bloody handprint, balled up in his bottom drawer. Back at the table, he stood over Dean’s corpse and gently pulled back the sheet. His brother was heavy now, stiff. Rigor had set in. But he managed to drape the jacket around Dean’s shoulders.
“Give him some time,” Sam said. “He’s done this before. Just remind yourself of that. He’s been to the Empty. He’s been to hell. He’s been to purgatory. And he always comes back. When we see Chuck tonight—”
He sighs and helps himself to another slice of pie. He takes his plastic fork to dig in, but now he’s
He runs through the story, telling Dean how Hannah had fetched him so they could try to persuade Daniel and Adina to return to heaven to face punishment. How things went sideways, and Cas ended up killing Daniel. How Adina was distraught afterwards, enraged, tracking down him and Hannah to kill them. And then how Crowley intervened.
“I led you to believe I didn’t make contact with Sam and Dean after I left them that day. But I went back once. Very early on. So early that—well, I hadn’t even gotten you back from the Empty yet. I couldn’t even
“But you have your melancholy. You just hold it inside.”
impressed.”
“Enochian isn’t your favorite?” the kid says, giving him a wry look, like he understands.
? (What the fuck.)
“It’s something Jack learned from you and Sam. Food is how you show you care about someone.”
“Maybe when I woke you from the Empty before, it started a chain reaction that—” He paused. “Well, maybe my waking you filled the void with
When he hangs up the phone, he wonders if he knew his brother as well as he thought.
“Exactly, Castiel. We don’t even know if this is gonna work. It’s an experiment, and I’m expendable. You’re not. If this doesn’t work, at least these people still have you. You’ll figure out something else.”
, he thinks now, not without a small degree of wistfulness.)
Sam says nothing.
“You think it might be a case? For us?” He’s typing into the search engine, scrolling through the results. Who could this be? He runs through the list of usual suspects in his head. Lucifer’s dead. Rowena’s Queen of Hell (and mass influenza just isn’t her style—too gross).
,” he said. “I doubt I’d make it down there in one piece.”
“Nice to meet you, Dean Winchester,” Daniel says. “We trust you didn’t have any issues getting here?”
Dean just sat there.
. Cas wasn’t supposed to feel things that way, wasn’t supposed to feel happiness and regret and deep despair, but Dean had changed him, had taken him away from the other angels and befriended him and made him something he wasn’t.
Neither of them says anything. Dean looks away. Sam notices he’s clutching the same dull green jacket he was wearing the morning he met them in town. The morning after Cas died.
angel partner. Male angel would-be lover? In a previous lifetime, he’d have rather walked in on one of his parents masturbating to
He watches as Miracle continues to sniff the patch of brown grass.
All at once he’s relieved to the point of real tears to see Cas there, looking fine, if just a bit different—instead of the suit and trenchcoat, he’s wearing jeans and button-down shirt. He’s sitting forward, his elbows balanced on his knees.
“I’m sorry, Sam. The Empty took him before I was in a position to do anything about it. And the Empty was riled.”
Sitting in front of a fountain at the center of a pristine town, Cas learns that Dean is dead. Has died. Is already in heaven.
Cas took his hand from Dean’s shoulder.
“The shape-shifter? Because that ended well.” He sighs. It’s clear that Dean isn’t taking “it’s none of your business” for an answer. So he just says it: “Eileen wants kids.”
“Children born on Christmas have an astonishing number of superstitions surrounding them, many of them contradictory. Some old wives’ tales say that they can talk to animals. Others say that they turn into goblins. Others still say they’re very lucky—maybe the luckiest people on earth. But other superstitions say they’re
Afterwards, Sam walks Eileen to her car. “I know you’re worried,” she said. “And you have reason to be. But I really think he just needs time.”
Jack leans forward, peering into Sam’s eyes. “Demons are allowed to enter a human being only if they have that person’s consent. When that is the case, you are to give these demons safe passage in your dimension as long as they respect this ground rule and are not destructive of innocent life. If they cross a line, I will let you know.”
He thinks about the Challenger disaster.
to take steps? Or do the powers-that-be just springboard you into the night once when you’ve gotten your wings back?”
“Jack came to you,” Sam says.
“No, really. What do you mean?”
Sam exhales. The tension seems to leave his body.
.” Sam takes a step forward. “And in the end, when you were just going to send him off to die as a suicide bomber for us? There aren’t words to describe what you did to him, the damage you caused. You fucked that kid up, Dean.”
If this is the heaven he “deserves,” then he wonders what that says about him. That he doesn’t deserve a heaven with angels? A heaven with Cas? He’s been assured that Cas exists, that he’s no longer in the Empty. Bobby told him as much, but Bobby also said that Jack had been there—and Dean hasn’t seen Jack either.
became … it was because of you guys.”
Jack peers at him. “I know.”
Then he remembered the last time he’d seen Jack—after Jack had exploded in the Empty and landed back in the bunker, the Empty roiled by the noise and commotion. Roiled enough to take vengeance. Which it was doing right now.
“Nothing. I’m fine.” He angles himself away from Gabriel and tries to wipe his tears away. “
“People in pre-literate societies had to remember so many things. Their stories knit them together. Entire peoples—vast and complex—would gather together regularly to recite their histories. Hundreds of thousands of words. You should have heard ancient Eblan. You wouldn’t believe the capacity those people had for detail.”
“Not quite.”
“She’s in hell, Dean. Not heaven.”
at anything?)
“Thank God.”
“It has to,” Cas says, hoping this will end the conversation. Angel politics aren’t his favorite subject. They’re also not Dean’s problem.
There’s only one person, besides Sam, that Dean can imagine taking to a concert like this, and he imagines what that person would say about it:
“Well,” John says, reaching out his hand to pat Dean’s shoulder. “You go find him. Okay?”
“Of course this is real, Cas. Why do you have so much trouble believing?”
“So he’s not there,” Sam said, his relief palpable. “Then where the hell is he?”
He has the most bizarre dream of his life. He and Cas are together in the backyard of someone’s house—a house he’s never seen before—and they’re playing bocce ball. The grass turns into a sandpit. And the balls can talk and one of them sounds oddly like … Meg? It’s calling out for Clarence! And then Meg is there but she’s dressed as a clown, which terrifies Dean. But it seems to turn Cas on—though maybe
He staggers forward again, burying his face in Cas’s shoulder to cry. At some point Sam leaves them.
In the dark, Cas can see only the outline of Jack’s face.
Maybe that’s what the Empty is like—the worst outcome you could possibly imagine, but one that never arrives. You’re just falling and falling, waiting to hit the ocean. But the end is always deferred. You live in fear, dread, and anticipation … and the anticipation of suffering is worse than suffering itself. It has no end.
“What?”
“All I’m saying is that maybe it would be good to turn that off. Get out for a while.”
“Are you sure about that?”
Gabriel sits next to him on the couch, trying to take the edge off by making jokes. When Anna tells a funny story about her own run-in with Dean—not a story Cas finds funny or really wants to hear—Gabriel says, “And here I thought I was the biggest tart in the fratway house. Thanks for shattering the illusion, Anna!”
Dean props himself up on his elbows. “No.
but with more drinking and fighting and puking and shitting bricks. Poor Sam.”
Mary presses her palms together. Leans forward. And Dean just comes out with it, tells her everything. Cas’s confession, his dying speech, how he’d wept. How he’d conjured the Empty, which had destroyed him, tearing him apart as Dean watched, reducing his physical body to a sludge of nothingness.
The worst thing was knowing that he maybe deserved it. And not just for his crimes against other angels—there were so many other ways he’d lapsed. Failed.
Dean wanders the aisles at the immaculate Gas-n-Sip. It’s deserted. No one’s working there, and yet it’s stocked and clean and well-kept as if a very diligent manager has just slipped out the backdoor to take out the trash. There’s music piping in through the store— “Angel of the Morning.” “Very funny, Cas,” he says to the empty aisles. “Yeah, you know I got a weakness for the Juice Newton version.”
He asks about Eileen. Sam says that she’s been working online. She’s also getting a lot of requests to do interpreting for the Deaf community for all the health bulletins. She’s coming over to visit later.
Sam remembers the day they talked about fortune and misfortune, the story Cas told them about the 9/11 widow—about how cruel and unlucky her fate seemed to everyone else, how impossible and improbable the turn of events. That a woman who lost her husband in the World Trade Center would die in a plane crash a few years later seemed like God’s sick idea for a joke. Right on par with something Chuck would do.
But let’s be honest. The real reason is that he’s not a pleasant person to be around.
right, and I was wrong, and there was a steep price to pay. But I didn’t break rules just because I felt like breaking them.”
Dean lies back and thinks about all this.
He's an ancient celestial being. He was forged from the cosmos, designed to protect creation. But wrapped around him is a human man whose life on earth was as fleeting as a firefly dusk. In his mind, Malachi's words are remade for him:
He’s no longer surprised that he’s come to know the intricacies of his housemates’ lives—or that they enjoy a degree of emotional intimacy. He knows that Gabriel is crestfallen—even depressed—that he hasn’t been able to mend fences with Michael and Raphael; he knows that Anna once dreamed of becoming an architect and a mother in the human world—she wanted to have a family and an important career. He understands that Abner is quietly devastated because Gadreel needs “time apart” and has gone to a separate part of heaven for a “clean slate.”
“People need to know what’s germane to their reality,” Jack says. “They need to live without our interference. We have to give them the right to do that.”
Like so many angels, Ambriel is exhausting. How many times does he have to explain that he didn’t rebel for the sake of rebelling? That he didn’t “tear up the script” for shits and giggles?
we're the most hated, so therefore it seems natural to us that we're suffering at the hands of all the people we've betrayed. Other groups might be going through the same thing, based on their own regrets.”
Dean presses his hands together.
you’re forgiven. Why can’t you just trust that?”
Sam bends over and picks up the remote. Puts it on the table next to the chair and leaves the room.
“I know you feel like you have to hide how you feel from Sam. And I know your reasons. But you don’t have to hide it from me. You were cheated out of a mother, just as he was. The amount of time you had compared to the amount of time he did? It’s immaterial. You were both robbed.”
Dean handed him the photographs.
“I thought he looked more like Cat Stevens. But "Peace Train" era Cat Stevens, before he became Yusuf Islam. But yeah. Purgatory will do that to you.”
Hannah comes to him, and Cas is shocked to see that she’s crying. He just puts his arms around her. “I know how much he meant to you,” she whispers. “Because—” He knows what she wants to say.
He swallows. “I don’t deserve to be with him. Not here.”
He’s fond of Hannah, sure. But he’s disappointed she hasn’t opted to live in the house. Not because he has feelings for her (he doesn’t—and he doesn’t believe that she has feelings for him, despite all the jokes and jabs and nods he pretends not to understand).
“I get that.”
Cas closes his eyes. “I can’t believe I’m hearing this. From
He would never talk about the Empty. What it looked like. What it smelled like. What it had done to Cas.
“I don’t—I don’t remember any of that,” he says, realizing that his breathing has grown more regular. Leave it to Jack to talk him down.
“And I’m not dreaming?” Dean says again, for probably the fifth time.
Cas squeezes his hand and tells him yes. Yes, he will.
“Charlie
For instance: he’s driving Baby around a stretch of countryside that looks like backwoods Wisconsin, and seemingly out of nowhere a Gas-n-Sip emerges, nestled against a patch of forest. Dean pulls up even though there’s no need (Baby doesn’t run out of gas on this side of paradise, and Dean is never hungry or thirsty or in need of a bathroom) and goes inside.
“I had a lot to make up for.”
“Dammit.”
the sign warns. They ignore it, bringing along a bag of breadcrumbs and tossing them into the water for the ducks to eat.
“Un-fucking-believable,” Anna said.
“Oh, there you go again,” Cas said one day when he walked into the library, peering over Sam’s shoulder to see what he was doing. “There you go, filling in your little boxes.”
“For what?”
“But … someday?”
“Coronavirus. SARS, MERS …” He looks at Dean, who doesn’t react. “You do remember SARS and MERS, right? Well, in any case, they cause respiratory infections, like pneumonia. And colds.”
“I know.” Cas exhales. “This is the worst of it, Sam. This separation. This loss. But it’s quite different on the other side. When Dean sees you again, it’ll be as though you were barely apart. But I won’t lie—it’ll be harder for you. It’s what the poet said. ‘Parting is all we know of heaven, and all we need of hell.’” He pauses for a moment. “I don’t know how I know that. I don’t even read poetry. But anyway.” He puts his hands in his trench coat pockets. “This is hell, Sam. This separation from your brother, from your family, from Jack. This is as bad as it gets. And you’ve been through worse. You’ll get through this.”
. The world in which Cas was a father, a member of a family that was fascinating and thorny. More intense than anything he’d ever experienced, in all his millennia of being an angel.
Sam is standing over him, and the light is on. Miracle is standing at the foot of the bed, barking. Then he quiets down.
“You were just a kid, Jack. What happened to Mary—it was an accident.”
“It’s fucking pie. In case you hadn’t noticed, we’re surrounded by oceans of it. I’ll get more. So talk to me, Sammy.”
“You don’t know that.”
“Turns out the Empty just wanted to go back to sleep. My being there—and being happy—was quite counterproductive for the Empty’s goals, so it was glad to slough me off on Jack again. Still, though.” He squeezes Dean’s hand. “I’m so sorry to put you through that. I should’ve gotten in touch sooner.”
“Something like that,” Cas said. “And your chances of dying in a terrorist attack are even smaller—in the neighborhood of one in 30 million. And yet, the two things happened to one couple. A woman who lost her husband in the World Trade Center on 9/11 died in a plane crash a few years later.” He peered at Dean. “Imagine the odds.”
When he and Hannah first got caught up with each other in rehab, she wanted to apologize for that business on earth. With Efram and Jonah. There was no need, he said, wanting to dispel that ugliness. He’d already had a similar conversation with Balthazar and it had pretty much gone the same way. “You got me out of the Empty, so we’re even,” Balthazar said quickly, clearly not in the mood to dwell.
, he was telling the truth in more ways than one. He was speaking for them both.
Silence settles in the room.
Dean wipes his eyes with the back of his hand, and Cas can tell that the laughter was something he needed. To take the edge off.
He’s still for a moment, trying to process this information. How could he have possibly saved Hannah? He remembers watching her die.
“You don’t understand how infectious diseases work, Dean.”
Now Cas put his hand on Dean’s shoulder.
“How do we know this is the ‘snitch ward’? That we’re the most hated of our species?”
“It’s the only way the Empty can keep us occupied—can keep us asleep. It's learned the hard way that individuals can be woken.”
He hates the fact that things have gotten heavy. They’ve just endured a miserable winter of grieving and fighting and ignoring each other and long silences and crying. The last thing he wanted to do was drag all that angst to a pie festival. This is supposed to be a fun time for Dean, not a sobfest for friggin' Eeyore. And, if it's not going to be a fun time for Dean, he wants to help him address his own grief, not wrestle with Sam's.
“Which is the opposite of stressful. This is fucking
Cas shrugs. “Because heaven is for humans, and humans like them. They like going to them, even if they don’t have to actually eat. A bonding activity.”
“You could do data mining,” Eileen is saying. “You could make connections between things no one’s ever thought about before.”
Sitting up in his bed, he thinks that maybe he
He does not, however, fault Dean for not telling him.
“Wait. You were in purgatory together?”
He tries to take comfort in routine. What else can you do? The days get shorter and darker, that part of the year when darkness meets you on both sides of the afternoon. Dean’s still a mess who drinks too much and can barely finish half a hamburger, but together they smoke out a batsquatch and investigate some Mothman sightings. (“The Mothman seems pretty harmless,” Dean admits. “If he’s not doing anything, we might as well do him a solid. He'll owe us down the road.”) They even solve a genuine-ass human murder mystery, wherein someone mistook a stalker for shadow person.
“You know it’s forbidden for angels and humans to be together, Ambriel.”
Cas closes his eye. He doesn’t like being looked at.
“You should stay with Mom.”
He wants to tell Dean that he’s lucky. That even in the ways he’s been extraordinarily unlucky—growing up Winchester, going to hell a few times, being Michael’s bottom bitch, losing Cas—he’s still the luckiest sonofabitch Sam knows. He’s lucky to have known Cas, to have loved him, to have had him for so many years.
. Or maybe it’s because everyone’s being just a little too nice to him, too civil.
“I’m sorry, Dean. It wasn’t the right thing to say.”
.” He tries to keep his voice steady, but already emotion is creeping in. “I want
Sam looks up as Dean takes his first swig. “Dean! It’s only ten in the morning.”
“It was what he wanted.”
Dean flinched—almost imperceptibly. He tightened his grip on the steering wheel and then relaxed. “I told you. We were trapped. Billie was outside the door, and she was getting in come hell or high water. So … Cas summoned the Empty. So that it would take them both.”
He wakes up with a start, arms flailing. It takes a long moment, but he recognizes the hotel room.
Dean opened his eyes but didn’t look at Cas.
“Whereas I don’t see the similarities,” Daniel says. “At all.”
Dean uncrossed his legs. “Then what?”
“‘For what?’” She gives him a look that’s surprised and amused, a smile at the corner of her mouth, her eyes wet. “For my life, Castiel. What else?”
. Even when you were trying your best not to be. Even when you were making small-talk about things like breakfast or television shows. You both tried so hard for my sake to come across as happy and well-adjusted and normal. But it was clear that you weren’t. Neither of you were okay. You were a mess. And still I walked away from you.”
He wonders if Cas is fucking with him. Or if this really is just a dream and nothing more. “Dean told me to keep fighting. I promised him I would, Cas.”
Cas looks down, stricken. “Dean, you shouldn’t be here. I’m sorry—”
always think they should get more time. They never do all the things in their lives that we want for them, or that they want for them. Hell, my vessel had barely been outside of Paramus, New Jersey. But at the end of the day, they get what they get, which is almost always a shit deal, and they make the best of it.”
“It just doesn’t make any sense that the Empty would take him. No sense, Sam.”
And there were, of course, Cas’s own misgivings. He’d spent his entire existence indoctrinated against the idea of having a human lover. Not just because it wasn’t allowed—not just because his job in earlier times had been to track down and dispatch the children of these couplings. But because it was considered wrong, a violation of duty and a betrayal of trust. Humans were vulnerable, considered low-hanging fruit. Angels existed to help them, not take advantage of them.
This was Anna’s routine complaint in the Empty. As they sat in the dark, waiting for the torture to begin anew, as it did each night, the angels often fought about who among them had committed worse deeds, and who deserved what.
, Cas thinks. The irony isn’t lost on Cas, but he just says, “Thank you, Gadreel. I know you helped him too. When I couldn’t.”
He opens his eye again to find Metatron still standing there. “What are you looking at?”
” Browne sings. “
Dean had never been able to shake that sadness from either of them.
Cas strokes his shoulder gently. “I knew.”
Sam finishes his slice of pie, even though he tastes almost nothing of it, and gets up to throw the styrofoam plate in the nearest trash bin.
“It might be time to learn, with Valentine’s Day coming up.”
feeling?”
He shrugs. “He wasn’t there, you know? He wasn’t there when we fought about Jack, when I said what I said, when Jack overheard us. And I’m guessing you didn’t tell him when he got back. Jack probably didn’t either. None of us really had the time to stand around and say, ‘Oh gee, guess what, Cas. Dean thinks Jack isn’t family. That’s why he was willing to send the kid to the Empty for all eternity, for a shot at living forty more years, max, outside Chuck’s control.’”
“I’m Brady. Your last mission. Me and my brother were taken by—”
“I’m not
Could he really do that? Could he really put a dick in his mouth? Probably. He’s done a lot of strange and daring things in his life—he’s gone to hell, killed Satan, transported a vampire out of Purgatory, sent himself to the veil, taken the goddamn Mark of Cain, turned himself into a soul bomb, let Michael use him as a vessel … really, what’s a dick in his mouth, next to all that?
When he gets to the house, Jack is standing on the porch, talking to his parents. He turns to see Dean, smiles and holds up his hand in that dorky wave. Then he holds both arms outstretched. Dean nearly knocks him over.
. And he’d wait for a word, for an answer, that would break him open again.
. But Sam already knew about the deal, about the “moment of happiness” thing, because Jack had told him. Because Jack had seen Cas make the deal.
“Fantastic.” He folds the map in half. An unforeseen complication. Enochian reading ability required. “Just my luck.”
Cas’s gaze slides in his direction, even though they’re so close that it’s unnecessary.
Instead, he writes something closer to the truth.
happened to Castiel?”
“But he didn’t want that.”
, he started to pray.
Eventually Cas pulls back and then puts his arms around Dean, holding him close. “There is a lot to tell you about, Dean. But I don’t know where to begin. I don’t even know what I know.”
“You’re not the son I fought for,” he says. “You’re not the same Jack the Winchesters fought for. I don’t know what’s happened to you—” Now it’s as though he’s not even saying these things—he’s standing outside himself, watching himself say them. “You’ve given up your humanity. You’ve become something else. This thing, this … failure. You couldn’t possibly be human and do this to Dean. Being in heaven—it hasn’t been good for you. How could you just—”
“Oh yeah, sure Cas.” Dean pulls back more of the covers so that they can both be under them together. “I didn’t think angels got tired.”
Cas held out his hands.
At some point he hears someone rattling his doorknob. And then knocking.
Once they’re seated together (on the same side of the booth, of course), Dean asks. “Wasn’t he one of the—”
. Just as much as I’m your father, if not moreso. He was there when I wasn’t. When I couldn’t be. And yet here you sit, talking about him like—like he’s nothing to you, like he’s expendable—” Cas stands up despite feeling as though he might collapse.
“He might have a point,” Samandriel says. “Even a broken clock is right once a day.”
“That’s what you’re worried about?”
In his room he lies on the bed, looking up at the ceiling. His thoughts drift toward the Empty.
There’s another silence. “It’s good to know that. But—how are you holding up?”
He remembers that day on the street—the last time he saw Jack—when Jack said he wasn’t coming back to the bunker.
“So you see, Mom,” he chokes out, reaching the end of the story, “I’m a total asshole. Cas—he deserved so much better. And now I roll up in heaven, just expecting him to be here, but … of course he’s not here. I didn’t earn that. I don’t … deserve him.”
“Perhaps we should all watch this movie, this
Cas’s hands are in his lap, clasped. Shaking. “Some rules need to be broken, Jack. If you learned anything from me and Sam and Dean … it has to be that.”
Roused by Jack’s urgent tone, Sam twisted his body so he could face him “What do you mean?”
He recalled that his strong bond with Jack—forged when Jack was still in utero—was key to his escape. But Cas was now sharing a bond with several other entities. “Maybe he can’t connect to me because I’m linked to the rest of you. I don’t know.”
He looks down at the grass. They start walking again. “The apocalypse was wrong, so I worked with Sam and Dean to stop it. I felt deeply that the nephil child was special, so I didn’t kill him.” He pauses. “I’d never felt right about killing nephilim to begin with. It felt indecent. I just … didn’t allow myself to acknowledge that until I lived among humans.” He glances back at her. “As for the Empty.” He tips his face toward her. “Well, none of you should have been there. None of
“It wouldn’t be fair to her to go any further.”
Well this is new. He and Sam never do birthday gifts. With some suspicion, Dean opens it. It’s a $25 gift card for Barnes and Noble. Obviously a re-gift. “Well thank you, Sam. Just what I needed.”
Cas squeezes Jack’s hand. “Thank you, Jack.”
“But … in heaven?”
Cas pulls away. Squints. “What are you talking about?”
Sam’s hope wanes. So does Dean—literally. He drops weight in the span of a month. Maybe ten pounds. He looks terrible.
“That is your territory. People still need to be crossed over, and monsters will always be monsters. They’re bound only by the chaos, so we still need you.”
“I’ll go with you.”
“And I just saw a kid in town who—who died after me. Of cancer. And he beat me here. How does that happen?”
His tears are hastening, so he needs to talk quickly. “Mom. You know—you know that me and Sammy—we never—we never, like,
“And you’re strong,” Dean says. “But we need to get you stronger.”
Dean was thinking of the time they were in heaven, traveling from one good memory to the next, and none of Sam’s had included Dean or anyone else in their family, and Sam had simply said,
“What, like this is
Jack doesn’t stop smiling, but he also looks confused. “Dean. You’ve been here for hours. A day and a half, tops.”
“You want to ask me why I’m in here, and not with my mother and Sam.”
“They can get in here?”
“About four hundred years’ worth, give or take a century. It takes a while for us to get around to providing translations.”
They make plans to meet at a bar in Hastings, Nebraska, close to where Federico lives. It’s a larger town, with a larger scene. Dean probably won’t see anyone he knows, so … why not. And if he’s not feeling it, he can always leave, right?
?” Abner says. “I loved that.”
“You,” Jimmy Novak says, holding up his hands and then setting them on Dean’s shoulders.
They’re both a mess, Cas realizes—traumatized from losing each other, again and again and again. When Dean said,
he wants to scream.
Cas pulls him closer, if that’s possible. “I’m sorry that the last thing you saw of me, Dean, was my death. But—Dean, when I went to the Empty, I was happy. I was at peace with my choice. And I was in love with you. And I remained that way during my time there. And then Jack rescued me, and the others. You
Thing is, for the first time in his life, he’s absolutely uninterested in getting laid. By anybody. Scarlet Johansson could show up at his room in the bunker totally naked, and he’d undoubtedly just shrug.
And frankly, Sam’s not sure he’d be able to stomach other people around. He just wants to be alone with his grief at this point. Selfish. Dean was all he had. He has no family left, not a single person on earth. He is, in this world, completely and utterly alone. So it seems fitting that he see Dean off by himself.
Once Dean shut the door, Sam glanced back to see Jack. He wasn’t crying anymore, but his face was puffy and tear-streaked. “Kid,” Sam said.
“I’m fine, Gabriel.”
Dean sees the slushie machine, churning away in the corner. Working perfectly, even though there’s no one around to drink what it has to offer. He draws closer to it. Bends at the waist so that he’s eye-level with the levers. “Cas,” he whispers. At the slushie machine.
He slides onto the bench next to Jack, one hand on his shoulder. “I know. It’s just … hard.”
Cas’s food arrives and Dean tells him to dig in. He takes a few fries from Cas’s plate, but otherwise he’s not hungry. Cas, on the other hand, is famished.
Anna said, “What makes you think that’ll even work? You’re blowing yourself up in a dream, not in reality.”
“He didn’t get to live his life.”
He turns his head. “You know? What do you know? That he was once my closest friend and I murdered him in cold blood?”
John nods, his hands still in his pockets. “I know. He’s, um, what do you kids call it these days?” He takes one hand out of his pocket and scratches the back of his head. Shrugs. “Your, um, partner?”
Being with Dean—in every way possible—is what he wants, and what he’s wanted for a while, but he’s also a little overwhelmed. Worried he won’t know how to do what he’s just proposed. Or that he won’t be any good at it. “Dean, I want to be with you. I’m just—”
The next day, Sam woke up and wandered into the library. Dean was obviously still sleeping it off, but Cas was in the library sitting at the table, staring into his laptop. Sam could hear the tinny strains of “If I Ever Leave This World Alive,” but when Cas sensed he wasn’t alone, he closed the laptop quickly.
Maybe the depth of Cas’s love seemed less obvious to Dean because it became a punchline among the angels and demons. It was easy for Dean not to take it seriously.
“This isn’t the time for stupid heroics, Malachi,” Cas said.
Everyone looks up. Stares at him.
“She says there’s almost a zero percent chance that this is anything other than your bog-standard zoonotic virus.”
“Does it have to be so loud?” he asked.
, Cas thinks. They’re both nervous.
He should have listened to his mother.
, he thinks. “You were watching me sleep?”
“He’s the one who found you when you collapsed?”
It seems they won’t have to learn to code after all. Jack obviously doesn’t want that for them.
“And some animal languages, too.” He paused, looking up at Dean. “Though, to be fair, most animals share a language, a kind of lingua franca. Dogs, however, have their own grammar. It’s quite exquisite.”
“They’ve been working their way through romantic movies,” Cas explains to Dean.
“Which one was Dean again?” Rebecca asks.
“You’re not.”
As he lies there, he can feel the thoughts of the angels working on him, their opinions—in Enochian, of course—piercing through whatever psychic defenses he has left. He shouldn’t be able to hear them, but he’s too weak to block them out.
, Mom. And I’ve prayed and searched and been everywhere and, like, nothing. But I keep seeing all these weird
“Or somebody else. It’s your birthday present. You get to take whoever you want.”
“He’s been sitting outside your door. He’s worried.” He holds up his phone. “Look, I’m going to call my doctor, okay? I’ll see if she can get you in.”
He shakes his head. “I’ve done that. That’s not what I need.”
“Sam,” Dr. Vallens says. “How are you? Is Dean all right? He missed our last appointment.”
Even though Cas was fluent in all the programming languages of the universe, he remained skeptical that computer technology was a net-gain for humankind. At first Sam figured that Cas was a luddite who pined for the days of mail pigeons and pony express, who felt that technology marred The Word. Later, though, he understood that Cas loved humanity and therefore he loved evidence of its efforts, all those lovely imperfect fingerprints that computer technology erased. If Cas had an ideal manuscript, it was probably something carved into stone tablets. Second ideal: an illuminated medieval bible written on parchment made from goatskin.
has always felt cold and clinical to him. Like a job description.
“I’m always with you, Sam. I told you that. You just have to believe.”
“My brother had an appointment?”
Now Dean was listening. In spite of himself, he wanted to hear what Cas had to say. He always wanted to hear what Cas had to say.
“You want to see them. Your brother and your foster son. You want to say goodbye.”
“He’s a serious guy.”
They christen this place “the fratway house” (Gabriel's idea). Several angels decide to stay there fulltime, Cas among them. He has a small room on the third floor that’s just as simple and austere as the one he had in the bunker, and it is there that he learns to rest. Angels technically don’t need sleep, but Cas is still exhausted. Tired from the Empty? From all this change? He doesn’t know.
What happened next happened quickly. Dean stepped forward, filling the small space between them. He set his hands against Cas’s shoulders and pushed him against the wall. Not gingerly, but not aggressively either. He pressed himself against Cas, the heat of his breath against his neck at first, and then his cheek. And their lips met briefly, and Cas could feel his own desire, clinging like sap, and he remembered again what it meant to be enfolded in a human body, to be ensconced in its desire for closeness and warmth.
Dean tilts Cas’s chin upward again. “No. None of that. I’m
He gets up to leave the room and is about to tell Sam to turn the lights and TV off, when something hits his shoulder. “Ow,” he says, looking down. The remote. Sam just threw the remote at him.
“It is odd,” Cas remarks. “Especially for a celestial.”
Dean wonders if both Jack and Cas are part of the fabric of heaven somehow—in the air and wind and sunshine and raindrops and all that shit. If so, then this isn’t his version of heaven—it’s hell, or some kind of twisted version of purgatory where he’s got to work out his “spiritual baggage” before moving on to the real deal. That might explain why Jimmy Novak’s in his heaven, and pissy as fuck to boot—Novak’s also got some baggage. Clearly. Maybe this “trial heaven” is a test to see if Dean can get along with everyone he pissed off when he was still alive. Once he does that, he gets a promotion.
“Really? Being God doesn’t automatically upload heaven’s first language into your brain?”
Now, under the lights and beside the animals, next to the woman he loves and the brother he’ll never leave, Sam remembers who they once were, and what they came for.
He doesn’t remember hearing about them before. He wonders if they know Cas. He takes the flier out of his pocket and looks at it again. It’s translated into at least thirty human languages. Nuts.
“Cool, I love chick flicks.”
Cas raised his eyes to look at Dean, and he looked so sad and unconvinced that Dean knew he didn’t believe a word he’d just said.
needed most—he didn’t know what to do. Couldn’t wrap his fucking head around it—any of it.
“Cas, are you—?”
forgave me. But not just that, Cas.” He paused. “You gave second and third chances to other angels all the time. You enabled Gadreel to redeem himself. You showed Metatron mercy, and he went on to sacrifice himself for Sam and Dean. Trust me, I know these things. They’ve told me. And that’s on top of—” Jack lowered his gaze. “You wouldn’t leave anyone behind in the Empty, Cas. You could have. But you didn’t.”
But in the kitchen they find empty cupboards and a refrigerator that’s empty of everything except ketchup and some tuna salad in a bowl covered by plastic wrap. Dean uncovers it. “It’s fresh,” he says. “But … random. Did you put that here?”
“No, Dean. You never have to ask.”
“But now I’m like, oh well. I know you’re Dean Winchester. You died saving my life. Thank you.” He holds out his hand.
But Sam, the nervous nelly that he is, keeps following the news. He’s always streaming it when he’s in the kitchen. Dean catches snippets of it.
“Medulloblastoma. Cancer, basically. My parents had already taken me for testing before …. Well, right after you saved us, I got the diagnosis. I lived for another seven months.”
“No, I’m the rare angel who’s not hierarchy-obsessed, Metatron. Not that you’d understand, but there’s a difference. I happen to agree that archangels were part of the problem. And plus.” He looks around at them and smirks. “I enjoy slumming with you folks. No really, I do.”
Jack looks away, his eyes sad but his mood resolute. “I’m sorry, Castiel.”
“Okay.”
His eyes meet Jack’s.
“Cas,” Dean breathes. “Open your eyes.”
“It’s a ritual,” Benjamin says.  “Which I never understood, because casseroles don’t cheer anyone up. They’re more than a little disgusting.”
“Poker and pot. You’re a woman of the world.”
Dean really starts to wonder if it’s the apocalypse again.
Cas knows immediately that something is wrong. Something has gone
He and Sam don’t really talk about the fight they had. They don’t ignore each other or anything—they just don’t mention it. There’s too much to do. The whole world is indeed shutting down, so they need to stock up on supplies like bread and toilet paper and water and booze … Amazon doesn’t deliver to the bunker (it’s not on any map). So they get their shit in order. Dean discovers that the Eagles have postponed all their concert dates … oh well. It was probably a bust anyway.
“Because ...”
“We wondered if you’d ever get up,” Gabriel says.
It probably won’t work for Cas. He’s not human, after all.
Cas reaches over to pull Dean closer to him, so that their bodies are touching almost completely.
“It wouldn’t have made a diff—”
Gadreel had no such coping mechanism. Malachi and Bartholomew seemed to suffer equally, while Anna and Metatron fared a bit worse.
“Then you find Rowena. If anyone else can figure this out, she can.”
So he’s a cautionary tale now. How refreshing.
“Sam,” Jack said. “You’re not hearing me. Cas was destroyed. It happened before I got there.”
“I’ve also never had sex on this side of existence, Cas. Or with a celestial being. So there you go, a whole slew of firsts for both of us. We’ll just take it as it goes. We will figure it out. Like we always do. And then we’ll have champagne afterwards.”
“Dean—”
“There are other ways to fight evil.” Cas’s gaze doesn’t waver. “You’ll always be a part of this family. But you’ll be other things as well. That’s what you need to do, Sam. To let go. To give yourself permission to live a life separate from the one you led with your brother. To do all the things he wanted for you. And that you wanted for you.” Cas pulls him closer. “At the moment of my death, I was happy. I was happy because I got to tell your brother the things I knew to be true about him—things he couldn’t accept. That he was good and loving. Unwavering. A uniquely compassionate human being. After I died, your brother eventually came to believe me. It took him time, but he did. And when he finally accepted what I told him about himself, he could let go. He could let himself be.”
Before going to bed, he doesn’t bother to ask Jack to forgive him. Not anymore. He just strips down to his boxers and his tee-shirt and gets in bed. It’s only four in the afternoon, but who gives a fuck. He has nowhere to go, nothing to do.
“She probably wouldn’t mind losing me for a few hours. But no, I get it. This is something you have to do on your own.”
, Crowley told the rest of their cellmates, who remained incredulous about Cas’s hunch.
“Twice,” Anna whispers.
“But what?”
They talk a little bit about the peace between the angels. About Jack’s policy of reconciliation, which seems to be working so far.
“You were right,” he says. “I didn’t treat him right. When I was alive. When he was alive. When we were both … alive.”
“So, this whole time, when we’ve been joking about learning how to code … you already knew how?”
“I’m not thrilled to be locked up with you feathered dingbats either,” Crowley said.
He never completes the sentence. Neither of them completes the sentence. There’s no need.
“Never heard of it.”
“You think?”
Dean doesn’t say anything. He knows that feeling.
get tired, and it had been a long, stressful, and disappointing day. They’d been Purgatory and back. It was there he got knocked out, lost Cas, and then found him—while Cas retrieved the blossom. But everything else had been a bust. They’d failed to trap Chuck.
“I’m not gonna off myself, if that’s what you’re thinking,” he tells Sam, squinting because the hallway lights are so bright.
Dean’s handwriting is a loose scrawl but neat enough to read without much strain. The first entry is dated November 3.
. But maybe they’d been romantic? (Is that distinction without a difference? He wonders.)
Some of his housemates seem to sense that he’s overwhelmed. They try to bring some levity to the proceedings. “In the human world, everyone brings casseroles at moments like this,” Anna says.
. That was their inside joke for the past year. A stupid, self-deprecating one-liner they’d been lobbing at each other and themselves, starting when Jack asked Dean what he’d do if all the monsters were dead tomorrow and he had nothing left to chase. “I’d do what they tell ex-coal miners and journalists to do,” he said. “Learn how to code. No, scratch that. I’d send
“They have a purpose, just as angels have a purpose. As I said, this universe thrives on balance.”
“Cas—”
Obviously, he doesn’t tell Sam any of this.
“He said he loved me. And that telling me that—telling me that? It made him
he lost you. Haunted by your sacrifice. Cas—you always underestimated your effect on him. He loved you, too.”
Dean offers to let Jack drive Baby to the spot where Cas is going to be, but Jack declines, “I’m taking your dad fishing,” he says. “Or he’s taking me? Well, whatever. I’m busy, Dean.”
Dean picked up another bottle to peel off the label. “Something like that.”
Ambriel returns his gaze. “Are you finished, Castiel?”
“Mom, it’s Cas.”
And he’s also glad for the privacy because, well, after talking a bit and kissing a lot, and making their way to a small house that sits on the edge of a lush forest, Dean pulls away Cas’s clothes, and they’re intimate for the first time.
“What are you doing?”
. (So Cas had been interested in politics. Who knew?) A map of a national park in Idaho. Still more fishing gear, most of it completely untouched, price tags still attached. A couple pictures of Sam and Dean and Jack in the glove compartment. Also, an iPod.
“Dean—what happened between you and Cas is … totally not my business.”
It’s been thirty-two days and thirteen hours since Cas said
“I appreciate that,” Sam says. “I think I’m okay. There was closure. All that. But—you’re all the way in Madison. How did Dean see you?”
.’ But I did.”
Dean was sitting in front of his laptop, finishing a soft drink in a waxy paper cup. He rattled it to move the ice and then sucked on the straw again. He looked at Cas. “Are you waiting for me to say ‘what’? Is that my cue?”
“Just because we can’t intervene in big ways … doesn’t mean we don’t do small things. I sent birds to you. Whatever bird you’d be reading about in my book, I’d make sure it was there the next time you went outside. Even those that migrate south for the winter.” He shakes his head to himself. “I knew that probably wouldn’t work.”
So on the surface, Eileen’s suggestion that they digitize the whole collection seems like a good one. It’s an idea they couldn’t consider previously—a consolidated database, though convenient, would have been a prime target for some ambitious infernal (or celestial) hacker. But now that things are calm and the world’s been set right? Well. Maybe she’s right. Maybe it
Metatron chuckles quietly. “Good to know the Empty didn’t change your charming personality. Well, I’m off to play some tiddlywinks for my social hour. Gadreel’s already in there.” He walked away.
,” Cas said. “We sort it out later. After we’re out of this place.”
Anna shook her head. “All of this is … insanity. But at least it’s a shot.”
He asks—can’t
He wonders what it’s like, being there. He wonders if Cas is conscious—if he’s fully aware of what’s going on—or if he’s stuck in some terrible dream, like the Ambien dream he had, times ten. Does Cas have a sense of time?
“Geez,” Dean says. “That’s bizarre.”
As the daylight fades, the lights come on and they are indeed impressive, dazzling.
Part of Dean feels disappointed, though he’d never admit it. “You came in here to tell me about a cold?”
“How can I help you, Sam?” she asks from the chair on the other side of the coffee table. The room is as beautiful and well-lit as he remembers it. He can still remember Dean sitting next to him, and Jack sitting in the opposite chair. Poor sad, scared Jack. Jack, who’s now the steward of this wild, imperfect world and everything in it.
For the first several years they had the bunker, Cas didn’t have a bedroom. Not technically, anyway. He stayed in the guest room, which was also used by Mary or whoever else was dropping by. If Cas and Mary were there at the same time, Cas hung out elsewhere in the bunker, passing the night in the library or archives.
“There were these … conditions.”
Cas turned back to the pictures. “No, I wasn’t going to ask that at all.” He looked up again. Focused on Dean. “But since you bring it up, I assume it’s on your mind. You’re not a difficult human to read, Dean. You usually say what you mean.”
“Then I think I’ll ask her to come instead. Leave you at home.”
“Castiel,” Adina says. “What a surprise, to see you here.”
Cas squinted. “My point is that fortune and misfortune are closer than we think. Luck is just luck. Your luck can be good or it can be bad. But the concept of luck itself is indifferent to what we
He doesn’t reply. He’s not sure it’s necessary.
Cas understands. His son was trying to provide for him the opportunity that he’d never gotten up the courage to provide for himself. “It was human,” he manages to say. “Human, Jack.”
After Cas was dead—and when he wasn’t sobbing into his pillow, grieving Cas like he’d never grieved for anyone in his life (he didn’t grieve that deeply for his mother or his father or Sam, but they could never know this)—he’d stop to allow himself just to feel it: this desire, this attraction to Cas. It amazed him. It existed beyond any self-definition he’d entertained previously. It wasn’t like it rendered all definitions of sexuality completely moot; it’s like it just existed beside them.
Jack blinks. “I know.”
He’s disappointed because—well, though she clearly cares about humanity, she doesn’t embrace it the way some of the other angels do. She still keeps herself at a slight distance.
He misses when Jack was still a boy, on earth, finding his way. Soul or no soul, he loved him all the same.
“And you provided the juice.” He clears his throat. “Jack filled me in on a few things. Says you don’t like to talk about it. Cool beans. But if you ever want to? Also cool. I’m here. All day, every day. Don't have anywhere else to be.” He can’t help but smile a little bit. “Guess my boyfriend is a big hero.”
“Jesus, you just keep prying. This is weird, Dean.”
John’s face betrays the smallest flicker of hurt, but he recovers. “Well let me walk you out, then.”
“But more people dying means more people in the veil.”
“I’m trying to get him to play frisbee,” he says. “But all he wants to do is chase this stick.”
“I’m sorry,” Dean says, scrambling to his feet and grasping Novak’s hands in his own. He pulls him to an upright position. Thank God the ground in heaven is soft. Dean repeats himself as he finishes steadying Novak. He tries to ignore that a small crowd is circling around them—a crowd that seems to consist of Novak’s people—the family and friends he had while he was living. “I’m sorry. I just—I thought you were …”
“I need to keep track of things,” he told Cas. “Unlike you, I don’t just remember shit. I don’t have a celestial brain.”
Sam said, “Isn’t it like one in six million?”
He thought about his long afternoons on the road. Listening to music. Praying at the altar of the Gas-n-Sip. It seems absolutely idiotic that he would have chosen such a thing, but also strangely fitting. Sam’s the sort of person who could roll into heaven and see everyone he ever knew within the first hour. But Dean, evidently, has baggage. Still. What else is new.
ong. And it’s killing me. It’s killing me! It’s killing me to watch you take a page from
“At least tell me they’re not still hunting. I mean, they’re both capable hunters, but they take risks, Jack. They always took too many risks.” He tries not to remember how many times he pulled the Winchesters out of some beartrap. Not that it wasn’t worth it. But it bothered him, how little Sam and Dean thought about themselves, how readily they jumped in with both feet without weighing the consequences to their own lives.
? Dean, what kind of self-help crap have you been reading?”
But soon, even for regret, it would also be too late.
“Deleting our memories was a better way?” Cas said.
“But that’s not what I’m here to talk to you about, Sam.”
“You’re the strong one,” Cas says. And then he’s gone.
, he thinks.
“Because you’re not like me. So yeah, I want my brother to be happy and productive and emotionally fulfilled. And, like, self-actualized.”
“And?”
“The Empty wouldn’t take Castiel then. It said it wanted to see him suffer, so it would wait until he was happy. Until he was truly happy. And then it would take everything from Cas.”
“Well. In any case. I’m still curious about this true form of yours.” Dean runs one finger along Cas’s face. “And if I’ll ever get to see it.”
Cas looks at him for a beat, and then just laughs.
“We understand what mothers are rationally. And we know why they’re important. They give life. They nurture. But emotionally?” He flipped to the picture of Mary holding Sam. “None of us has a mother, so there’s no analogue in the angel world, no easy way to explain it to other angels that … well. The loss of a mother? There must be nothing like it.”
“How I treated Jack is on me,” Dean says. “Cas is on me too.”
He wonders: has he just come out to his mother? But come out as …
“Maybe what?”
“Cas, please just listen.” Jack stands too, extends a hand that Cas refuses to take.
Bartholomew just stared straight ahead, but Malachi looked at him.
, Dean thinks. She calms Sam down.
“They weren’t. Not really. Especially Dean. I believed he’d found some degree of peace, but—he was devastated when he lost you. And by
“No, no need for that,” Dean says. Now he does withdraw his hand to wipe away the rest of the tears. Rises to his feet. “I’m on my way out.”
He doesn’t have to wonder how his mother felt when she was dropped back on earth with two thirty-something grown-ass sons—two needy man-children who wanted her to be something that she wasn’t, that she hadn’t signed up for. He already knows.
She looked up at him. “Hey.”
He looks down at his legs still tangled in the sheets, his hands propping himself up from behind. His heart is pounding. “I killed Cas. He’s dead because of me.”
,” Adina says. “It’s about these clones who are raised to be organ donors and nothing more. Their organs are harvested and they’re dead before they’re thirty.” She pauses. “It reminded me of what our lives are like. As angels.”
“We’ll be together?”
Cas tightens his grip on Sam’s shoulder, just as Dean did that day at the festival. Then he reaches over to gently cradle the back of Sam’s head. “You’re a good hunter. Extraordinary, really. But you have many other gifts.”
“He’s still weak from his time in the Empty. Getting stronger—he’s okay. I mean, he
Once the demons were awake, it was the beginning of the end for the Empty. And once the Empty loosened its grip on angels, and Cas was able to connect to Jack …
“She was ripped away from you when you were just—” He looked away. “Given your age at that time, and what we now know about childhood comprehension … what happened to her—it must have been your first memory.”
of us. And—I know what it’s like in the Empty. I know how it warps you. How it tries to
He cries on a few of these excursions. He is, for lack of a better term, homesick. One time, he’s sitting next to the ice rink, watching Jack skate, and he just breaks down without warning, sobbing into one of his gloves. He never cried before, not in all his billions of years of being an angel,
“Okay, those aren’t chick flicks,” Dean says. “Those are tragedy porn.”
Dean doesn’t wait for a response, just starts kissing him again. Cas’s legs feel numb due to some combination of nervousness and desire. And Dean, he knows, is feeling the same thing. He’s eager and gentle but also skittish.
“Good. Yeah, we can be intimate, Cas.” He reaches for Cas’s left hand with his right hand and weaves his fingers through Cas’s. “Sexually. If it’s something you want.”
“Geez.”
Next to him, Cas is silent.
“Like, we
That night, they sat in the kitchen together, Dean drinking bourbon. Cas could scarcely remember a time when things looked so bleak. Their chance at defeating Chuck had gone shitside. Jack was dead.
“On your way to what?” John says, not budging from the mouth of the living room. “We’ve barely gotten to see you since you got here, and now you’re leaving again?”
The next morning, Dean is up before he is. That’s a first. He’s in bed, reading a book, but he looks down at Cas as he wakes up. “Good morning, starshine.”
he met Dean, and unhappy afterwards. Like Dean ruined him.
“You’re not an archangel anymore,” he says.
“I’m not joking. In case you hadn’t noticed, we humans have short little lives. We don’t exactly measure our time on earth in millennia. It’s like dog years to people years. Times a million. So. I won’t make you promise to throw yourself on the casket, though. Even though it would be entertaining.”
“I’ll come back soon, Dad. I’ve just got …”
Stories that will be the happiest of surprises.
These are just some of the thoughts he’s got moving through his head.
He gets up to go inside, leaving Sam with the pond and the dead log, and Miracle sniffing around the field.
Sam allows himself to eat a forkful of pie.
“I’m sorry,” she says. “Technically I shouldn’t be talking to you. Could you have Dean call me back when he gets a moment?”
The infirmary hallways are bright and clean. Institutional. He’ll have to talk to Jack about that. Then again, this is an angel rehab facility, and angels like structure. Familiarity. Hierarchy. Maybe it’s best not to change things up so soon—especially since so many of his brothers and sisters just got out of the Empty, where there was only chaos. Terrible chaos.
As Dean retreated into his own bedroom, Cas felt relief. Regret would come later.
Cas’s eyes grew softer, if that was possible. “I don’t disagree with your decision to give Sam time and space with your mother. If that’s what they need, then that’s good. And it’s understandable if you need to be alone. But … I question your rationale.”
Malachi clasps him in a firm hug, pats his shoulders, his back. “Haven’t seen you in ages, man. You look great. So much better than you did in rehab.”
So it seems that Jack doesn’t want a perfect world. There’s still global warming and one-ply toilet paper; there are parking tickets and internet trolls. There’s the common cold, which Sam gets in the fall, as he always does. And it spares Dean, as it always does, even though Dean’s the one who looks like shit and hasn’t been taking care of himself. Hasn't eaten a balanced meal in months. Starts every day with a beer or three.
It’s a piece of information that Cas won’t register until later—his mind is too preoccupied with this odd scene in front of him, with Gabriel tolerating Metatron, and Gadreel and Abner apparently reconciled.
He looks up at Sam. “I killed Cas.”
Cas is in the far corner of the booth, with Dean sitting on the aisle. Dean glances at him. “Uh, we’ll just have your regular breakfast scramble. A side of fries.” Once the waiter leaves, Dean leans closer. “You okay?” he whispers into Cas’s ear. “You want to get this to go?”
Just like everyone else.
“By turning us into robots? Into
“I’m sorry, Dean.”
“Neither does Gadreel.”
But the figure in front of him isn’t Cas, and Dean doesn’t discover this until he’s already on the ground on top of this not-Cas person. This … Jimmy Novak person.
He can’t believe he just said that—right at this moment.
like loud things. And you, Jack, are an American.”
Dean turned around to look at the clock, even though his laptop had a clock and he knew what time it was. He was just making a point. “It’s too early in the day for this pseudo-philosophical bullshit, Cas. I haven’t started drinking yet.”
“This one does. I’ve been tired ever since I—” He pauses.
like that. Okay, it wasn’t like that at all.
His mother peers at him, incredulous. She almost smiles. “Dean. You just got here.”
But of course he’s lying. He’s not fine. And Dean suffered. He suffered a lot—not in the moment of his death, not when he was bleeding out—but every day and every hour after Cas died. His pain was beyond articulation.
Dean says, “Jimmy Novak lives in town, I think. And dude is pissed. What if you run into him?”
In the truck, Dean pushed the on button and was surprised when the device lit up. So it had kept its charge. He put the buds in his ears and pressed play. The song he heard, according to the device, was “Over the Rainbow.”
“An accident I could have stopped. I killed Sam and Dean’s
Crumpled against the car window, Dean begins to sob again—the sort of raw, heaving sobs that can’t feel good when you’ve been crying all morning, crying for days and weeks. He has nothing left. Sam's heart breaks for him. Again. And again.
Metatron was shaking his head. “This is bonkers. Where will you go
He feels like he’s been searching for weeks. He can’t find Cas anywhere. But now he’s more convinced than ever that someone is fucking with him.
“But they’re demons. By nature they’re destructive.”
, Dean, and you know that too. You’re not stupid, so quit acting like it.” He runs a hand through his hair. “Jack wanted what he couldn’t have—what no one can have from you. Approval. Forgiveness. And I know because I once wanted the same things, and I would jump through hoops just to—” He looks down. “All you had to do was tell him you loved him, you forgave him for Mom—it would’ve meant the world to him. The
“In heaven you pick the age you want to be. Most people pick when they were happiest, which I guess is usually around forty? But I didn’t want to be that old. And I knew I didn’t want to be a kid anymore, either. So I decided to be the age I would be if I went to college.” He pauses. “I guess in the end? I was just hoping to get to be that old.”
When he got no answer, he wondered if he was going about this prayer thing the wrong way—acting the way he did on earth by expecting Cas to show up, and getting mad when he didn’t.
“Wait a minute, back up,” Dean says, still clutching the box that holds the slices of pie. “I’m still stuck on this no-kids thing. You’re telling me that you and Eileen broke up because you don’t want kids.”
“And we’re already seeing infections in this country.”
“Dean. Dean, come here and sit down.” Mary gestures to the couch behind them, sets her hand on his elbow to guide him. They both sit. “I can’t follow what you’re talking about. So calm down. And just explain to me what this is about.”
“Yeah okay,” Dean says. He doesn’t know what “zoonotic” means, but he doesn’t want to ask. Sam’s probably already explained it a few dozen times.
There’s the official story, which he knows by heart: He figured out the torture was all an illusion, a shared dream, and was able to convince Crowley and the others not to trust what they were seeing and feeling. Crowley was then able to tap into his connection to Rowena so she could wake the demons.
“It’s just—” Cas pursed his lips. His eyes met Sam’s. “John had such beautiful handwriting.”
Malachi jutted forward. “I can’t go along with this, unless—unless I’m the one blowing myself up.”
“The angel that hijacked my body and flew it into the Eifel Tower, the World Trade Center, and the Taj Mahal on a weekly basis? Look elsewhere, pal.” He brushes his pants and starts to turn away but then changes his mind. “No, actually, if you see that celestial, tell him to keep his distance. This is heaven, and I respect that. I wouldn’t want to cause any difficulties.”
“And go where? To the mall? To a restaurant? For all we know, the virus is already circulating here.”
“Do you know your chances of dying in a plane crash?” Cas said.
Cas holds him a little tighter, closes his eyes. He almost wants to laugh at the idea that Dean could have made him unhappy. As if Cas had been happy
“And that person would be right,” Dean said. “Seeing ghosts means you’ve been handed a shit deal.”
“Jimmy, be cool,” says one guy in a dark jacket. “That’s Dean Winchester.”
He stirs. “Jack?”
Cas feels uneasiness welling inside him. Maybe it’s the mention of Raphael. And
Jack opens his mouth. Then he closes it. “From what I understand, things were a bit more complicated.”
“I’m just saying. If you’re looking for a reason—”
, Cas would tell him.
Dean looks like he wants to ask. But he doesn’t. Instead, he asks him if he knows what he wants to eat.
“I promise,” Cas says.
They make a bit of small talk about heaven and where Dean’s been since he got there. They ask about his family and whether he’s seen them yet (Daniel and Adina are particularly piqued by what goes on in human families), and then Adina says that they watched the movie that Metatron recommended.
“He was right about you.”
The first time Dean thinks he sees Cas, he knocks him over. He can’t help it. Here’s his best friend, big as life, in heaven where he should be. Where he
“And Lucifer?”
It’s impossible to be bored in this place—it’s always changing. Also, he isn’t alone. He shares heaven with other people, but only when he wants to. When he wants to be alone, he can do that too. He can drive for hours or days on back country roads. Or he can go visit his parents, which he’s done already, right when he arrived. He can be in a city also, and it’s there that his own heaven overlaps with other people’s—friends, family members, and people he’s never met before. Where he can apparently run into Jimmy Novak, but not anyone particularly interesting, like John Lennon or Marilyn Monroe.
He put the cassette back into the recorder and left the room.
in this thing he has with Dean. Curious for curiosity’s sake, in the way that angels often are. He knows his housemates will be happy for him, but that they’ll also be artlessly inquisitive about this love thing. He imagines them together, comparing notes, highlighting the similarities between his narrative and that of
“And I realize he didn’t know many people, but—” Dean’s arms are folded over his chest. He draws them tighter.
Cas shrugged.
wrong, and it has to do with Sam and Dean.
“Jack?”
Dean looks down himself, his legs tangled in the sheets. He’s still breathing heavily. “I’m fine,” he manages to say.
Cas smiles in acknowledgment.
“Sure I do.”
The kid leans forward. “And on the down-low? It pisses off the angels when they can’t talk shit about us anymore. That’s what Daniel and Adina told me.”
“Signs?”
“You can’t quantify time with a mother. Even I know that.”
. Or even fuckin’
Sam is in the field behind the bunker with Miracle, playing fetch. He throws a stick as far as he can, and Miracle races after it. Brings it back.
Cas tells Dean to go along first, to get a head start. “Sam has a lot to tell you,” he says.
Of course he knows this. And Eileen knows this. She’s suggested different possibilities. “Yes, I know,” he says, softening his voice a little.
Dean continues to stare at him. “Then what?” he says. His voice is also softer.
And then, even more inwardly, he’s
Cas’s eyes met his and they were warm and affectionate. Lately Dean saw him looking more and more like that—more sensitive.
sorry. I’m sorry—” He starts to choke up again. “I’m the asshole who couldn’t say ‘I love you’ back.”
“I wish you wouldn’t go,” Sam says.
“No, you didn’t. Not like I—I mean, I made you miserable, Cas. I was so sad to hear …” His breath catches. “Sad to hear you weren’t, you know, happy.” The admission breaks him open a little more. Two seconds away from sobbing. “I have that effect on people, you know. Or, I should say,
“I don’t understand what you’re talking about,” Daniel says. He turns to Adina. “I don’t understand what he’s talking about.”
“Oh, fuck off. I was awful to that poor kid. I’m just lucky he’s a forgiving God, I guess.”
“Humans like loud things,” Cas explained.
, he thinks. He shakes his head. “Jack mentioned something about it.”
Cas thinks of Mary, of her pain when she was resurrected, her disorientation. And of Sam and Dean’s inability to provide her with the peace she was yearning for, and their resulting confusion and hurt.
Initially he prayed to Cas.
Claire looked at Dean, who still couldn’t look her in the eye. “Death? Death killed Castiel.” With her knife, she lined up some peas on her fork but didn’t eat them. “Why haven’t you brought him back? You did before.”
He also wishes he hadn’t woken up at all. Ever.
“So humor me. Pretend I’m … pretend I’m that therapist we went to see that time.”
Cas tosses some bread into the pond and watches as several ducks swim for the same piece. “I know, Jack. You don’t have to explain.”
You’re what made me happy.”
“Not just them. A couple other angels, too. Some you know, some you don’t. We call it a frat house.” Cas summarizes it briefly for Dean, tells him they practice doing nothing by playing pool and watching Netflix. “But Daniel and Adina are transitioning out. They have jobs. I think they really want to be down here in this part of heaven. Among humans.”
He walks Cas into the other room. “You look exhausted,” he says. “You want me to wing you upstairs?”
Okay, no, that is
Dean leans forward. “And?”
“Cas loves you, Dean. In ways that I’m not sure even he …. Well, let’s just say news of your death was very distressing to him. He’s taking it hard.”
Dean gets up so that Cas can slide out of the booth to greet his friends—he hugs them hello, Adina kisses him on the cheek—and then he introduces Dean. Not that Dean needs an introduction.
Dean’s befuddled—not least of all by the fact that this kid died
“But how?” Sam said, glancing at his brother, careful not to look too long. “How do you summon something like the Empty? The Empty can’t just pop in like that. Did he say something? I mean, what—”
“You’re the one giving, not taking.”
“I do.” He levels another devastated stare at his brother. “I lied to you. Again. I'm sorry, Sammy. It's like, all I ever do is lie to you." His voice breaks. "I told you I didn’t know how Cas summoned the Empty.”
“That Cas traded himself to the Empty, and the Empty said it wouldn’t take him until he was happy. That’s all.”
“I know, Dean.”
Not Dean. Dean gave approximately two shits about God or angels. Dean was just so
“It’s not something we control.” He tells Dean that heaven is for humans, and humans use sex as a bonding activity. So of course it exists in heaven.
“Well, it’s like they say, shit gets real. It gets pure. Boiled down. When you’re jumping from the hundredth floor of a building because your office is on fire, you say what needs to be said. All the rest—none of it matters.” She got up from the steps to get rid of her joint, but then she paused and looked back at him. “But you know? Life rarely gives you those moments anyway. And if you think it will? You’re a kid, or just an idiot. Life just takes people from you, again and again. And maybe it’s better that way. To not get those big ‘goodbye’ moments. Because what would you say, really?”
episodes about lost children, socks, coffee, gouda cheese. So maybe the fact that a well-built guy makes him remember his dead best friend doesn’t really mean anything consequential as far as his sexuality goes.
He is. He’s been allowing Jack’s words to wash over him without really thinking too hard about them.
He wishes he could show Dean that he’s not the person he thinks he is—a person who hurts others.
“We’ll see each other again, Dean,” Cas says with a conviction that Dean hasn’t heard in a long time. He holds Dean more closely. There’s that strength again—that angelic strength that Cas had seemed to lose over the years, as he grew more distant from heaven. “You have my word.”
“I’m serious. You don’t think you deserve to be forgiven. But I’m here to tell you that you simply are.
Cas suspects it’s because of Jack. They’ll want a favor down the road. Or they want to stay in God’s good graces. What better way than sucking up to God’s dad? He should tell them not to waste their time—he’s not someone with any kind of power, and he plans to remain that way. He’s not interested in pettiness or politicking. He’s not a leader. Has zero ability to govern other angels. No, from here on out, he’s happy to be the bumbling, ineffectual dad who Jack visits on the weekends.
Not the Judy Garland version. The version by that Hawaiian dude. Israel something-something (it was a last name Dean wasn’t gonna try to pronounce). Ukulele guy. That fuckin’ guy.
“I thought that’s what we
Dean’s lips twitch, trying to hide a smile. “You wouldn’t mind if we did it again?”
He barely registers his trip back to his parents’ house.
“How good?” He leaned forward. “Good enough to win quality bud?”
Maybe he should go see his mother now, ask her about this. But what advice could she possibly give?
There’s only one person he wants to show up at his door, naked or not. How long did Cas love him? And why didn’t he say anything? Did he really think Dean could never love him back?
He worries that that
She looked straight ahead again. “And more.”
“You’re so funny, Cas.”
Sometimes Dean even wandered into Sam’s room in the middle of the night. Sam never asked questions. He just moved over to make room for Dean and made sure he got most of the covers. Just as Dean had done for him when they were kids and he had terrible nightmares—nightmares that turned out not to be nightmares at all, but memories.
“Don’t tell me to calm down!”
Then again, probably not. He remembers the time—almost twenty years ago—when his father pulled Sammy out of school and Dean out of … whatever … and made them go to Ground Zero after 9/11 because he was just so damn sure that nineteen guys with boxcutters couldn’t have done such a thing—it had to be demons. But John was wrong. Sometimes shit just happens, and it’s nothing to do with demons.
He thinks about sharing his theory that Cas is a slushie machine or a thunderstorm or a Lady Gaga song, but even in death, he knows it’s bonkers.
“We kept stopping by,” Mirabel says. “You were out of it. You looked terrible. You look better now.”
.” He holds Dean a little tighter. “You’d already been left so many times.”
“Nope. Can’t say I have.”
Luckily, his mother doesn’t seem to care about sexuality either.
Cas has to go through Wing Town to see Jack, who often summons him to get feedback about additions and revisions to this new heaven. On his way there and back, he sometimes runs into angels he’d rather not see—Ishim, Naomi, Uriel, Dumah. Even though heaven is all about forgiveness—and Cas does indeed forgive everyone, just as he himself wants to be forgiven—he genuinely does not want to be in their company.
. I never thought—I never thought being an angel was bad.”
. It’s like he didn’t drive there, even though he knows he did—he has Baby behind him to prove it.
Jack’s eyes are wide but not surprised. “Cas. I won’t do that.”
Sam comes out of the bathroom, his newly washed hair wrapped up in a towel. He seems a bit startled to see Dean holding his meds, but he recovers quickly.
She sighs. “That’s not true. And besides, you haven’t even been here that long, Dean. Give him some time.”
Cas looks up at him.
“Michael and Raphael? They’ll come around. Or they won’t. In any case, fuckers can’t just ride roughshod over the neighborhood anymore, and believe me, that’s a good thing.” He looks down at his cards. “Great family. They take the fun out of dysfunctional.”
young.” Again, he thinks of the kid in the historical society.
He doesn’t care what this is. He falls into Cas’s arms.
Anna just swats him.
She’s quiet for a moment. Then: “Oh, Sam. Oh my God. I’m so sorry.”
They changed the subject and never talked about it again. He wishes he’d listened, though.
? Angels don’t sleep, Castiel.”
“Maybe,” Cas said, sitting back. He caught Sam’s eyes from across the table. “But like anything, it’s a matter of perspective. Fortune and misfortune are closer than we think they are. One and the same. We think of them as diametrically opposed. But really, luck is an agnostic concept. What is it other than an occurrence that seems to defy probability? It doesn’t matter if the outcome is good or bad.”
At some point, Claire asked how Cas died. Dean couldn’t say anything, he just grabbed his wine glass. So Sam spoke for him, launching into protective-brother mode. “Uh, Billie. Billie caused Cas’s death.”
And he wonders now if Dean didn’t feel the same way. Lucky, on some level, to die in such a routine accident. A year prior he’d been ready to lock himself in watery casket for all eternity; a rebar to the back seemed like a gift in comparison. And when the moment finally came—well, Sam could tell Dean wasn’t sad for himself. He wasn’t crying for himself. He was crying for Sam.
“But maybe,” Cas says. In the dark, he peers up at Dean.
soundtrack?”
“He’s not coming back,” Dean manages to choke out between sobs. Hyperventilating now. Seconds from a panic attack. “We’re never—we’re never—gonna see him again. Not even—when we die—”
Crowley rolled his eyes. “Unlike you mind-molested featherfucks, I know which direction is up. And I keep my promises.”
Cas ignored this kind of bluster, the trash-talking his cellmates did about his history with the Winchesters. He knew how he survived each night—each terrifying, torturous night: by retreating to a space in his mind where he could think about Dean. Think about Dean’s laugh. His eyelashes. The bridge of his nose. The times they shared. It didn’t always work, but it was his only defense.
Even if he could respond, he wouldn’t. It’s not worth it, he’s learned over the years. He’s never been able to reason with fellow angels when it comes to the topic of humanity. He can’t make them see how extraordinary humans are in all their ordinariness—how uniquely versatile and sensitive, how much they accomplish during their mere eighty-five years on earth (a hundred if they’re lucky), a third of which they devote to sleeping.
Cas half sobs, half laughs. “No, Dean. You could never … I just—never knew. I knew sexual intimacy was important to your species … but I—” He doesn’t finish his sentence.
A couple people laugh as they turn and walk away. They leave Dean feeling more confused than the day he first set foot in heaven.
“I suppose you’re right.”
“No.”
Dean feels relief, but also a fresh peal of anxiety: If Cas is okay, then why hasn’t he shown himself? Why isn’t he with Jack?
—sadder than his current state of separation from Dean.
“And I’m probably still a dick even though I’m dead, let’s be honest.”
He remembers the first time he was in heaven—when Cas told him he had to find the road and keep following it. Is that what’s going on this time? Will all roads lead to Cas? Or just some?
Metatron gives a big, dramatic sigh. “Castiel. You are playing this
But the inside of the home is very much them—no fancy fixtures or snazzy splashback tiles. His dad keeps a pool table in the center of the living room, and his mother has her own area upstairs. Dean suspects that the house is large so they can share it properly—so they can retreat to their respective corners to be apart when the need arises. (And knowing them, it must arise fairly often.)
“I’m so sorry, Cas,” Balthazar says, wrapping his arms around him.
They’re sitting outside at a beer garden. Dean is with them. Which, in all honesty, isn’t good: the only thing Dean hates more than being a third wheel is a
a dick who automatically said the shittiest thing that popped into his mind.)
He hates to ask librarians for help—hates when other people know what he’s looking for—but he goes to the kid at the desk and decides to ask him where he can find more information about angels.
But Sam’s right—the goddamn thing keeps spreading and spreading, and bigger cities are making noises about shutting down. Someone in Kansas gets it. Someone in Kansas
Unlike Sam and Claire, Dean avoids disaster porn—he just doesn’t need that in his life, he gets enough of it already—but he remembers seeing a show about the space shuttle. Everyone assumed the astronauts died when the thing blew up, but they didn’t. They might not have even lost consciousness. That meant that they didn’t die until they hit the ocean, minutes later. They were awake and alive, all the way down.
“It’s really not that peculiar,” Sam said, laughing. “It just seems like it because Dean’s a fucking luddite, with his tapes and love of all things analog. But what you do is put songs this device. I’ll show you how to do it. That way you can listen to Beyonce all day long without Dean giving you a hard time.”
door?”
Dean looks up at the ceiling, which has a spinning fan, but he doesn’t take his hand away from his mother’s.
During this tiff, Claire and Kaia sat on the sofa, Claire against the armrest, so that she kept nudging Kaia’s thighs with her feet. They seemed completely unfazed by Alex and Jody and just kept looking at their cellphones. And chuckling as they traded glances. Dean realized they were texting each other, lost in their own little world.
“No guarantees of that,” Malachi said.
, I know, I’ll be—”
After the greetings and laughter and a few embarrassing tears of joy, Dean and Jack sit side by side on the wooden steps to the front porch of his parents’ house. John and Mary have retreated inside, leaving Jack and Dean to get caught up. On everything.
“I left my iPod where you would find it.”
“So, are you ever going to tell me?” he says, casting a cutting glance at Sam.
“Why? You gave me seven more months with my family, and my brother’s still alive. And now I get to be with my dad.”
Mary looks all the more confused, if that’s even possible, but he plows forward anyway. “The day when you told me to be careful with his feelings because—because he liked me and took me seriously, and I just could not get it through my dumb head what you were talking about, even though I knew deep down what you were saying, and—” He takes a deep breath.
“We argued about it the whole way down here. Daniel says the fact that they all die makes it a human story about mortality. And as angels, we don’t die. Not really. Or we at least don’t live with the constant awareness of impending death hanging over us.”
“Can I ask how?”
“Oh no,” Jack says. “You definitely weren’t in the veil. I wouldn’t have left you in the veil. Or anywhere else. If you’d been anywhere besides heaven … I would have launched an all-out offensive, Dean.”
He has to take a piss. He cracks his shoulder and reaches for his robe. Well, okay, Dean’s robe, which he can see just vaguely in the light coming in from the hallway. He starts to get up when he sees the familiar figure sitting at the end of his bed.
Time passes and he grows stronger. He gets well enough to venture out of the fratway house to see more of the angels’ side of the celestial realm, which his human-obsessed friends have dubbed Wing Town. It’s meant to be a bit pejorative—to lightly mock the other angels who are, deep down inside, still scared of humanity. Of course, they’d never admit they’re scared—scared of
“No.” He looks toward the door.
“You extend forgiveness to others all the time. You forgave me when I killed Mary.”
. For your death. I blamed him because he said he knew there was something wrong with Jack, but—I told him he was dead to me. I said these terrible things and he just walked out, and I didn’t stop him, and—” He’s nearly hyperventilating now. Christ, he’s a basket-case, even in death.
“And Dean gave himself permission as well, in the end. He gave himself permission to stop fighting so hard. To stop shouldering the burden of saving the entire world. He was tired, Sam. He’d done enough.”
“I didn’t tell you everything, Sam. I didn’t tell you about—” He closes his eyes. Then he opens them again. “Cas told me he was in love with me. But … it wasn’t just that. That wasn’t what summoned the Empty.”
They drive all the way to Madison, Wisconsin. He already has an appointment.
They all wanted their pound of flesh. Revenge time.
Dean sits back on the bench, the box of pie still in his lap. “If it’s a matter of DNA, Sam, there are other ways. You of all people know that DNA doesn’t make a family.”
Thanksgiving had been tense in the way any family gathering is tense … when you’ve just lost half your family. The girls had a lot of pent-up angst, similar to the angst he and Sam had harbored at that age. And a lot of sublimated trauma about recent events. Besides that, they had their own dramas and conflicts—their own lives that had nothing to do with Sam or Dean.
“What?”
, Cas. Technically I should be in hell. A few times over. Or dead months ago, via Billie.” He lets go of Cas’s chin. “You gave me more time with Sam, which was more than I ever thought possible. And now you’ve …” He gestures to the space around them. “You’ve gone and done this. When is it gonna be enough, Cas?”
“Jack. What I said to you—it was wrong.
Ugh. Enochian classes. Maybe this
“No deal, Dean,” Cas says, pulling back so he can look into Dean’s eyes. One of his hands is cupping Dean’s face. The other is squeezing his shoulder, hard. “I’m not here because of any deal. I’m here because of you.”
He’s not surprised that Dean is emotional, that he’s crying. He knows how deeply Dean feels things. “I love you so much, Dean,” he says quietly, once he's caught his breath enough to speak.
“I need a flowchart to keep track of this shit,” Metatron said. “I’ve been dead for too long.”
The house’s inhabitants begin to stir awake, and soon enough, Benjamin blinks himself downstairs, picks up the pool cue, and breaks.
“I’m not sure. I can tell you how much time passed here, but it’s relative, of course. He doesn’t talk about it. I don’t think he finds it very interesting or worth going into.”
“But if you don’t know what you’re missing …”
“Don’t ever change.”
Dean closed his eyes. Tried not to sigh.
“Thank you, Dean.”
Outside the library, he feels something vibrating in his pocket. He fishes out a cellphone. Where the hell did that come from? Heaven has cellphones? Since when? And how has he just gotten a text message?
On the drive back to the bunker, none of them said anything.
“Dean has many virtues. Patience is not among them.”
And he knows how blowjobs work—he’s received a few—so he won’t be confused about the mechanics. But still. Still. There’s only person he could see himself sharing that kind of thing with. Only one person with whom he’d feel totally okay, like he could mess up, and try again, or not try again, and say
“No, I—he’s adopted.” He decided not to mention Jack’s true parentage, for obvious reasons.
, every day.” He imagines waking up with Cas every morning. Making him breakfast. Washing his clothes. Taking him to the beach. All the wonderful things that equal a human life.
of Mom to remember or hold onto. I don’t know how he even managed to …. I mean, look at him now. He’s just—”
don’t even remember now. Maybe she had you so damaged that you didn’t know what was going on.”
“We were trying to help.”
He had a feeling he was a massive disappointment to his mother. Or that he would be, once she knew more about him. He didn’t know that for sure; he just sensed it.
“I will be.”
“Yeah.” Dean looks around, taking it all in. “I got it.”
Gadreel. A vague memory sprang to mind: Gadreel had been in the Empty too. One of the first angels he’d seen when he arrived.
When Dean opens the door for them, Cas sees Malachi. He’s standing behind the host’s station.
“I didn’t even think about it until the Empty brought it up.”
“I should have known you would take the iPod in the worst way possible. I told Jack, ‘Dean is good at love. Not so good at faith.’ So he set up this meeting.”
In any case, Cas wasn’t “over the rainbow.” He wasn’t sitting on a cloud or flying with the bluebirds. He was in the Empty. Worse, he must have known that’s where he was headed when he listened to this fucking song.
“Oh.” Cas laughs. (It’s so good to hear him laugh.) “Well, my true form is still overwhelming, so when I'm with humans, in this part of heaven, you see me as you remember me, and also as I want to be seen. We sort of meet in the middle.”
He never really believed in “the one” or a soulmate or anything like that. But if he did have a “one,” it was Cas. Cas was a person he genuinely got excited to see, a person he could spend hours with. One day, years ago, he’d been watching TV, and not really paying attention, but he heard a relationship expert describe the ideal partner as someone whose arms you could just “fall into” at the end of the day, regardless of how great or how shitty your day had been. And even then—even all the way back then—Dean hadn’t thought about some mythical, perfect woman. He thought about Cas.
What they do together doesn’t take very long, and it isn’t very complicated, but it feels good nonetheless. It’s just Dean’s lips pressed to his, Dean’s hand between them, touching him. Dean’s weight against him. On top of him. He arches upward, pushing himself against Dean.
“Oh, I know,” Samandriel says. “So sad.”
Jack looks like the same teenager he was when Dean knew him, with his down-to-earth clothes and shoes. But here he’s also happier. Lighter. Like nothing is weighing him down. On earth, he was sad. Even when he was trying not to be. No matter how he smiled, he couldn’t conceal it—that same deep sadness that Dean remembers seeing in Sammy’s face, when Sam was just that age. The sadness that came from losing a mother. And having a fucked-up father.
Hannah often stops by, and this has become a source of amusement for certain angels—because she doesn’t stop by to just hang out. She clearly comes to see Castiel.
He hopes Dean is okay. And Sam. Moving onward and upward. Putting him and the last twelve years in the rearview. The last time he talked to Jack about them, Jack assured him that they were both fine. Still living in the bunker, but clearly moving on. Rebuilding their lives. That’s good—that’s all he wants.
The days come and go. No Cas.
Dean laughs again, this time pulling Cas toward him and clasping him in a tight embrace. “Cas, I’m laughing so hard I’m
“Is Dean still drinking too much?”
It’s spontaneous and unrehearsed. Real.
Next to him, Sam is still.
“It had nothing to do with that.” Sam drops the fork back onto his styrofoam dish, knowing now that he’s not going to enjoy this pie. “You know, I think it’s weird that you’re always wanting me to, I don’t know, run off and get married or something, considering that the extent of your previous relationship advice was ‘never bang a woman who knows where you find you in the morning.’”
Even before his mother brought it to his attention months later, Dean had noticed. He’d noticed how sensitive Cas had become. Cas had always been a good friend, their
“If your mind makes it worse,” Cas said, “then your mind can make it better.”
“You know I can’t stay.”
Sam leaves food for him but he doesn’t eat it.
“I know, Cas.”
“Why? It’s not our thing. It doesn’t have to do with us. And … I don’t think it’s healthy for you, Sam. What does your doctor say? About fixating on things you can’t change.”
He and Sam have tried every spell they can find. Gone through reams of lore. Nothing, not even the barest mention of the Empty.
“They really weren’t, Jack,” Cas interrupts, his voice clipped. “I stabbed him in the back.” Realizing how defensive he sounds, he stops himself. “Sorry.”
He and Jack are sitting together on a bench on a street of a small, quaint town that looks vaguely Midwestern, like someplace he’s either been or dreamed about.
Crowley stood. “Well that’s touching. But one piece doesn’t fit, and that’s me. I blow your little theory out of the water.” He shrugged. “I don’t experience guilt. Don’t even know the concept. And ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if it doesn’t—”
He tries not to tear up. “I wish I’d recovered sooner. If I’d been there—”
But he knows that’s gross (and what if Sam found out? He’d be horrified), so he figures he’ll change them but stash this set in his bottom drawer. Same place he keeps the jacket with Cas’s blood.
Cas sat back, folded his hands, and looked up at the ceiling. “Sometimes I think about Jimmy Novak. I know he felt blessed when I found him, when I chose him. Like he was winning some cosmic lottery.” He lowered his gaze. “I know he didn’t feel that way later.”
“Not because of anything Jack said. Not because of anything
“So lay your judgments on me, Cas.”
He remembers those long nights in the bunker, wandering around as he waited for Sam and Dean to awaken. During that time, he contemplated happiness—what it was and what it could mean for someone like him. What did he really
“We hit all of them every year,” Dean says. “And besides—no. We didn’t move. Or lose our jobs.”
Dean thinks—and not for the first time—that catching some virus and dying might not be the worst thing in the world. It certainly sounds better than living another forty fucking years without Cas.
Back in the bunker—which has never felt emptier—Sam feeds Miracle and takes him out for a walk. When he returns, he makes his way down to Dean’s room again, opening the door and wandering inside. Miracle comes too. He looks around at the books still on the shelves. Dean the autodidact, the closeted intellectual. Sam was “the smart one,” but Dean probably had enough research under his belt to earn a Ph.D. in cryptology.
“She already texted me.”
“For that shit I said about you and Jack.” He clears his throat. “You didn’t deserve that. Not now. Not after everything you’ve done.”
“He killed Mom. You were closer to her than I was. It’s no wonder that you, that you had a hard time with that.”
All the pictures he had of his family were in his lap. They were so scant, so few. The history of his life: a history of scarcity.
“Really,” Cas says. Stalling, trying to buy himself time. They all look happy. He tries not to be too suspicious. They’re newly back from the Empty—of course they’re cheerful.
“You look like you could use some,” she said.
He knows that happiness isn't in the having, it's in just being—he has the Empty to thank for that bit of perspective. But
But his attempt to get Dean to acknowledge his feelings gets him called a “friggin’ Eeyore,” so that’s that. And once Dean’s finished wiping away the pie that Sam lobbed at his face, he’s ready to turn the tables.
. Another was a manual on gardening. Another called
“What are you talking about?” she says. “Everyone knows you’re in love with him. It’s like climate change—not even worth debating anymore. I’m sure it’ll hit the next update of the
too soon. It hasn’t even been a human year since they defeated Chuck!
It took his eyes a second to adjust. Besides Metatron, with him were Gadreel, Malachi, Anna, and Bartholomew. And …
“No—” he starts to say, but his voice isn’t quite there. He clears his throat. “No. I’m fine, Dean.”
There’s still nothing to do and too many hours in the day in which to do it. Dean and Sam try to structure their hours productively, but what ends up giving them structure are the daily press conferences and briefings—the noise of history. But eventually they turn that shit off and figure out how to do other things than obsess about misfortune. Hunting is still slow—nothing coming in over the wire. Dean reads more and thinks about what he might do, what he might like to do.
Malachi’s eyes searched his.
“Everything has porn.”
And Hannah thanking him for her life.
Sam’s right, he’s a hundred percent right about the way Dean treated Jack. He was indeed monstrous. There are no words.
. Like—”
“The sigil you got those suicide bombers to carve into their chests. That Gadreel carved into his chest. You’re going to carve it into mine.”
