"That's that" He replied, fingers already twitching at his side for another cigarette, "You should get going. Classes will be starting soon".
"It's a stakeout" He replied, rolling his eyes as he knelt down to pick the lock on the roof door, "I told you we need to wait for the man to leave before following him. We can't just burst in there with guns blazing!"
It was exactly 7 months 2 weeks and 4 days after John joined the bet, that they finally made Anderson crack.
"I got shot because of my job" He replied, smiling softly, "I'm a police officer, Mr. Holmes. Getting shot is kind of an occupational hazard".
know" He replied seriously, his eyes suddenly a whole lot sharper than before, "The same way I know that
She sighed, cutting off his rambling speech, "Just... how about you start with telling me what all these cartons are for?"
"I know. Everything from the River Thames to Churchill's War Rooms to 10 Downing Street. Everything practically
"... But he also told me, that you were the one who got him out when he got in too deep" Lestrade continued, "So, for that, at least...
"And don't I know it" He sighed, taking a seat next to the man as he closed his eyes once more, the flashing blue and red sirens casting shadows on his face.
"Then catch up on sleep! Or watch TV! Or- Or- Or I don't know, but do something! You're bloody unbearable when you're like this!" He snapped, before suddenly standing up, "Now, I'm going to work. Feel free to do the grocery shopping".
He had been hauled up by a large man cursing his height, and rather awkwardly dragged back down the alley to a van that had arrived at the end of it, before being tossed inside unceremoniously and with a squeal of tires, the van had taken off.
Sherlock blinked and glanced down at the dozen or so containers he'd automatically pulled out of the backpack, "Oh... well... it's dinner, obviously".
He reluctantly stood up, knowing that his work here was done, but couldn't help but pause at the sight of the detective's smile.
And as he left the store, he couldn't help but grin widely as the weight of the world lifted off his shoulders.
The barrel of the gun pressed further into Sherlock's head as warning, "Ah... No. No, I... I can't, actually. I'm staying at Mycroft's for a few days. Something about the Prime Minister needing advice on parliament, you know how it is".
, Mycroft Holmes" He growled, hands drifting lower and lower, "Why couldn't you have started with that?"
He smiled and shook his head, "It's my store. My dad left it to me when he died a few years back. It's fine, don't worry about it".
He barely spared them a nod in his journey to the kitchen, "Ah, Lestrade, I've only been back a few days, and you're already out of your dept? Though, that's no surprise really, considering-"
"Gregory, honestly, it's about bloody time that John Watson found the door to that closet he's so desperately hiding in. I'd be glad for him to finally...
"She's my sister" Mycroft said tightly, "And if you insult, injure, or upset her in any way, I will not be responsible for my actions".
And there were distinctive boot prints on his once-white shirt, revealing the possibility of internal bleeding and cracked ribs.
"Yes you bloody well do!" He snapped, before suddenly, his eyes widened, "... You've been to see Lestrade".
He had dutifully counted the time, 54 minutes, until the vehicle had stopped as well as the direction, four lefts and three rights then straight on for the last few minutes, that they had headed in. Based on all that, as well as the smell of slightly salty seaweed he got whiff of when he'd been dragged out, he placed his new 'prison' south east of Baker Street, somewhere near... Westminster?
His face must say it all because suddenly everyone else is turning to follow his gaze. There's loud gasps and wide eyes and one woman down back actually faints but all this does is let John know that
"... Need to get the powder burns out of your fingers. I don't suppose you'd serve time for this, but let's avoid the court case".
The elder's arms cautiously came up to wrap around the man's shoulders, and he felt the other sigh again, leaning close enough to speak in a whisper that only Lestrade could hear.
The Inspector sighed and straightened up, turning to face the detective, "Just tell me what you know, Sherlock, I'm not able to deal with-"
The doctor stared at him for another minute, before taking a deep breath, dropping his bag, and walking over to his armchair.
"Oh a good few hundred, I should say" came the calm response, "I'm slowly making my way through them... These are the donations we get, from libraries and colleges and such, so if it's a textbook that you're after-"
Sherlock grinned, slow and assured, warm breath ghosting over her face, "I think... that's the best idea you've had all evening".
The detective felt something in his heart crack at the usually emotionless man's confused and somewhat scared rambling.
, John thought bitterly, watching as he slowly raised the glass closer to the spider, before suddenly freezing as it moved.
"Sherlock, be careful!" He hissed, voice carefully measured so only themselves and Anderson could here.
"Don't be an ass, Mycroft, how long have you two been together?" He snapped, abruptly standing up and beginning to pace the room.
The detective rolled his eyes, "Of what? Clearly the murderer left immediately after killing the man!"
"Dilated pupils, stiff muscles, blue lips, loss of motor control, and no coordination" He continued, "Focus, John, what does mean?!"
Breathing in carefully through his nose, he tried to block out the shooting pain that seared up and down his wrist and tried to focus on what he knew.
"I'm surrounded by idiots!" came the snide reply, before he returned his gaze to the plant, "I'll be needing my UV lamp back".
Mycroft couldn't help but smirk as he stepped back into Sherlock's hospital room, and immediately the younger man stopped his conversation with John and stared at him suspiciously.
One minute Sherlock was running down an alleyway, hot on the heels of his latest murderer, and the next, there was a bang, a stinging pain in his head, and the world was suddenly somewhat tilted.
He panicked, briefly, when the detectives found the pink case in their flat, and worried that the offhand remark of "find the suitcase, find the killer" would be taken more seriously.
But he couldn't not tell her, she was his daughter, his honey bee, and he'd gladly kill anyone who tried to harm her.
"It's still not ethical, Sherlock" He replied instead, "What do you think John would say if he knew you brought her here? To a
"Then light the fire!" He exclaimed exasperated, only for the detective to nod sombrely and do as told.
He glanced up only the find the man in question curiously looking at the body on the ground next to them.
"Yes, and they also call you William and me Alexander. What sort of dull names are those?" He replied, "No. She shall take her middle name just as we have done".
"... Alright" She replied slowly, taking back her phone, equal parts amused and irritated that he'd just saved himself as 'Bathroom Guy', "So... That's that, then".
She couldn't help but smile at his awkward attempt of avoiding her question, "We can talk if you want to, Sherlock".
Hoping that his nerves weren't too obvious, he braced himself for rejection and stated, "John... Would you like to get tea with me sometime?"
"I..." He carefully took a sip of tea, staring resolutely into the fireplace, "... I've always been like this, John. This... This intelligent. Making deductions. Pointing things out that people didn't want to see... Now, of course, I understand it for what it is, but back then... I didn't know what was wrong with me".
He quickly turned to the child in his arms, face gentle and inviting, voice calm and warm, "Yes honeybee?"
And now that he was at eye level, the Inspector could clearly see that the fractured arm wasn't the detective's only injury.
He had seen Lestrade shooting curious glances at it all night, but thankfully, being the good man that he was, he hadn't mentioned it.
He nodded, and she raised an eyebrow at him, becoming more and more suspicious by the second, "And what, pray tell, are we having for dinner? Ignoring the fact, of course, that you struggle to remember what food actually is, let alone consume it willingly".
He shifted on the spot, uncomfortably, "She's... She's only 3? Man, I thought she was... like... at leat 6 or something".
The boyfriend gave a small smile, "Well, I'm... I'm doing five subjects for my A-levels. I'm hoping to get a scholarship to Oxford in two years time, to study law".
, and replied with a quiet "since you got hurt because of me" that just tugged at John's heartstrings even as the genius continued to tuck the quilt in around him.
"Mind yourself, would you?" John said, letting go of his arm as Anderson seemed to pale from what he could see out of the corner of his eye.
Lestrade blinked, surprised, and he quickly continued on, "Not just because of that. Because of a lot of reasons. That was just bad timing. Don't worry, you don't have to say it back, it kind of just slipped out, I'm not expecting anything, just-"
Instead, she was left staring into confused blue eyes mere inches from her own, and felt the hand at the back of her neck tighten unconsciously.
He tightened his hold on her arm and forcefully turned her around to face the bathroom mirror, "Can you honestly say that to yourself and believe it?"
"I'm pretty sure you could search this flat all day and you wouldn't find anything you call 'recreational'" John continued and-
Shuffling back against the cold stone wall, John pulled his knees up to his chest and prayed to whatever deity that was out there, that Sherlock had realised he was missing.
"And then to convince me that you know every single little detail about my life?" He finished incredulously, and he sighed, frustrated, "No!
Sherlock and John both turned to him, the former looked the most insulted they had ever seen him and the later doing his best to pull a 'hey! watch it, mate' look on his face.
He had deleted all baking skills long ago, after all, as they were rather frivolous things to remember considering he had his own personal chef.
He scowled and opened his mouth to retaliate, but Lestrade quickly stepped in to prevent world war three from happening.
Eventually, he dragged himself out of bed, and went through the morning routine he'd developed since Afghanistan. It was bare, it was bleak, it was boring.
The med student flushed scarlet and glared furiously at him, while Lestrade coughed awkwardly and ducked his head.
He huffed, exasperated, and rolled his eyes as he put the pen and notebook away, and John distantly wondered just
"Oh yes" He replied, eyes reopening as he turned to face her, "I find myself rather in need of that input right now".
"I might as well just send her to Kindergarten!" He exclaimed, "Do you honestly believe I would let her anywhere near those idiotic cartoonish books? Or, god forbid, they start singing nursery rhymes to her! What utter nonsense, Graham!"
Sitting down at the edge of the bed, he pulled back the covers until a messy head of black curls appeared, and red-rimmed eyes blinked blearily up at him, skin ashen and paler than death.
And as he spun around, he was treated with the glimpse of a flash of pale skin as the blonde's shirt rod up when he reached for the book on top of a particularly tall pile.
And before anyone could even blink, Lestrade had yelled and flung himself forwards, just as there was a loud-
"Did you confess you're undying love for him?" Sherlock asked innocently, and next to him, John coughed loudly and shot him a dark look.
Once again, Lestrade was never quite sure how, exactly, it happened, and Mycroft blamed the alcohol.
John frowned and turned just in time to see the wide smirk that spread over the genius's face as he walked over.
Sherlock, it would seem, had already made an acquaintance, and the black-haired boy was currently being shown how to cross monkey bars without falling flat on his face.
He couldn't make out much in the dim light, but could tell that the man was sharp featured, likely from aristocrats. What led him to murder, was interesting in itself, but the fact he was clearly at ease with the whole thing, was what really caught his attention.
"Well, I do hate to rush things, but the whole point of this was to kill you so... never put off until tomorrow what you can do today?"
And compared to tall, dark, and handsome next to her, she looked even worse, and she only hated herself even more because of it.
Mycroft, surprisingly, didn't bring it up with John, despite knowing now that he shared his little brother's
The second the boyfriend stepped out into the light, however, the genius stiffened, unnoticeable to the two teenagers but plain as day to his best friend.
" John hissed at him, pulling the blanket over the sleeping genius, and Lestrade came to an abrupt stop at the sight in front of him.
It was many, many hours later, as Mycroft lay in bed staring in awe at the silver-haired beauty lying next to him, that he finally checked his phone.
"Ah, yes, well, I had to find a way of giving you directions. And, speaking of John" Sherlock frowned, fishing out his mobile that one of the constables had found while raiding the warehouse, "It's just gone seven. He should be back from that conference in Oxford any minute now".
So he went home that night, changed out of his uniform, ordered some chinese, scrolled through the contacts of his phone, and hit
John slowly nodded, understanding, and vowed to never let this seemingly-emotionless man go through that again, not when it was just down to him and Mycroft Holmes.
Afterwards, he can see Sherlock talking to Lestrade, and their eyes meet. He can pinpoint the exact moment that the genius realises the truth, and then immediately backtracks to the officer to throw him off the scent.
Lestrade sighed and collapsed back in his seat, "It was after the whole pancake thing that he kissed me... He sort of freaked out".
To say he was shocked when he walked into that chemical lab and saw Mr Tall Dark and Homicide, was putting it mildly.
"Yes, here! He broke in for some unknown reason and found me making breakfast in the kitchen in my boxers!"
He turned to Greg as he spoke and couldn't help but laugh at the out-of-place biker standing amongst soft croissants and faded pink wallpaper.
The man did as told, turning to face him fully, and Lestrade found himself flushing under the intensity of his gaze.
Inside, there was only darkness, and John stumbled and cursed his way to the window to yank back the curtains. Turning back around, he spied the heavily covered lump in the middle of the bed, invisible under layers and layers and
He played violin at odd hours, went days without talking and then mere seconds rambling fast enough to lose his breath, and kept numerous body parts in the fridge on the shelf above the milk.
He was tall himself, John distantly noted, a good foot on himself. But he was slight, skinny, lanky even, and he felt like, if he had to, he could take him.
Opening the door, glad to find the store empty, he put on a determined face and marched right over to the counter, jutting out his hand, "I'm Greg. Greg Lestrade".
After John had woken up, a full four days after his rescue, he hadn't let on that he'd heard Sherlock's every word while unconscious, and the younger man hadn't mentioned it again.
But it did lend itself to a lot of benefits when he eventually moved in with the man, because of course they were going to move into now, even if they had hated each other they knew each other's real names, and those secrets were far too important to simply let the other man go.
"... Like you'd do anything to make the other person happy" She said, "Like you'd lay down your life for them at a second's notice... Like you can't breathe when you're near them... Like you can't think straight and you're happy and sad at the same time and full of
Sherlock sighed and finally looked up at him, "His name is Isambard. Isambard Kingdom Brunel. And he's a Venus fly trap".
He'd been trying to find a book for his criminology class for ages without luck, and had finally followed Sherlock's not-so-accurate directions to the second-hand place that he swore by.
" He whispered, leaning into the cool touch, watching with sickening pity how the man seemed surprised by the action, "Just... Let your emotions control you, alright? Just this once?"
His frown only deepened as he noticed how stiffly Sherlock was holding himself, tense, obviously, from pain.
"The doctors keep trying to kick me out, claiming that visiting times apply even to the worlds greatest consulting detective... but I think I scared them enough into letting me say. Your own doctor is having an affair with the gardener, after all, and one of nurse's moonlights as a stripper, so I just threatened to expose them... They left me alone after that".
Taking a deep breath, he glanced around his empty apartment, the pancakes and empty chinese cartons the only sign that last night and this morning had, in fact, happened.
Sherlock frowned, the dim streetlights below highlighting the subsequent wrinkles that formed on his forehead, "Well... I understand that it's socially unacceptable not to...
John zoned him out as the usual speech began, a speech that he himself could probably repeat just from watching trashy telly. There's a gentle tug on his hand and he subtly glanced across at Mary as she gives him a knowing look to pay
"I do" He replied simply, stepping out into the cool night air, "But none that I consider my friends".
Piling wood on top of the now blazing fire, Sherlock gently herded the ex-soldier towards his favourite chair, before turning on the kettle as he ran down the hall to his bedroom, returning with an armful of quilt and blankets.
And with another laugh, he was dropped, landing in a heap of long limps and twisted backpack on the filthy tiles below, causing the other's in the group to laugh.
Breaking into the compound was painfully easy, Lestrade leading the assault and John and Mycroft trailing after at the back of the group.
Pausing for a minute, he heard nothing more, and shook his head, dismissing it, before reaching up for the spider again, only for it to dangle down a few more inches from the ceiling.
"Nothing!" came the too quick reply, and then suddenly piercing grey eyes were staring into his own, "Sherlock".
"I should have listened. I should have- I should have done what you asked me to and gone grocery shopping. Gotten the bloody litre of milk. Then we wouldn't be in this mess..."
Sherlock jumped a mile in the air, heart hammering at a hundred miles a second as he spun around for the source of that god-awful noise.
"He's injured. Much like you are" He replied, conflicted over who to worry about the most, "Don't worry, though, we'll get you both to a hospital soon".
He glanced down at her, an unreadable expression in his eyes, "... The names Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes"
"Of course" Sherlock replied quietly, "I'm taking no responsibility if we end up breaking things during the imminent argument, though".
Lestrade quickly went to greet him, closing the kitchen door behind him, not at all aware that the consulting detective could still hear them.
"Here, come on, let me show you" the pathologist said instead, handing him another cherry while she caught another one in her mouth, "You just have to eat the fruit part, obviously, and spit out the seed, and then... press the stem to the roof of your mouth, bite down until both ends cross over each other, and then push one end through the other... there!"
Lestrade frowned, worry replacing all previous desire as he straightened up and took a step forwards, startled when Mycroft flinched back, eyes downcast and body tense.
That alone hadn't even caused him to blink, people were always dramatic and over-emotional, and he had merely taken another long drag of his cigarette, before blowing out the smoke in a perfect ring-like shape.
, that it broke his brother's heart, and he found himself recalling all the split lips and broken bones that he'd never gotten answers for.
"I'd like it rare" He replied, "Very rare. In fact, you know what? Don't spend any more than five minutes cooking it. Oh, and make sure there's no garlic".
It was just he hadn't slept good last night, didn't hear his alarm, was late for work, and then came home to find Sherlock still lying on the couch where he'd left him, having ignored his request to do some grocery shopping and... well... let's just say that there had been a few choice words thrown about.
Sherlock gave an over-dramatic sigh, and pointed to the ceiling, "Over there in the top right-hand corner. She's huge, you can't miss her".
He shrugged, ducking his head as he pulled out various cartons from within the bag, "We're going to be here for a while... Do
The older gestured at the sand pit where Eurus was now kneeling down next to a dark-haired boy, "You here to mind your sibling too? My sister Anthea is around here somewhere"
Lestrade huffed in exasperation, before lifting up the yellow police tape, "Just... come on, already, before I send you home".
"You may be a genius, but you sure as hell ain't modest" He shot back, "This is your first time at the playground, then?"
"Don't you 'honestly John' me, Holmes!" He snapped, "You're sick. You've got the flu. I'm only trying to help!
"You know... I always thought it was too good to be true. Suddenly gaining a fantastic lawyer, finding out about the apartment, revealing all her other dirty secrets" He started, "... So I guess I have you to thank for all this, huh?"
"That's true, he was a bad cabbie" Sherlock agreed, "You should have seen the route he took us to get here".
Sherlock!" He exclaimed, rolling his eyes and the man's antics, but the detective took no notice, "Johnnnn, stop motherin' me!"
And then Lestrade burst in with a triple homicide on his hands and no suspects, and with a flurry of a blue scarf and a billowing coat, he was gone.
"Well there's no other way I can teach you" She replied, grinning, and his breath hitched even as he leant closer, "Isn't there?"
Lestrade glanced around the room guiltily before giving into the temptation and leaning forward, smelling it.
He wasn't sure what Mycroft had been expecting when called to an acquaintance-at-best's flat late on a Friday night, but Lestrade was convinced that he had expected the door to open and a fist to firmly plant itself on his nose.
Mycroft's gaze drifted down to the bare expanse of skin revealed by his itching, before quickly snapped back up, and
Greg slowly picked up his jacket and walked down the aisle towards the elder Holmes who was, strangely enough, rather
And being punched in the face and then offered a quiet night in by a man he hardly knew, was about as strange as the logical and predictive Holmes could deal with.
"Ambulance is on it's way" John announced, turning back around to face him, and he nodded, carefully untying the rope that kept his brother tied to the wall.
"It's 'talk'. Not speak" He corrected before taking a deep breath and holding out his hand, "I'm Sherlock Holmes. Will you be my friend? My mummy says I have to make one now or she'll leave me until I do".
To anyone else, they would have scoffed at the arrogant remark, but to Lestrade, who had known the man far far longer than anybody else on his team, he knew exactly what he meant.
tell? The last segment of her pedipalps is smaller, first of all, yet she is distinctly larger than her male counterpart. After that, there's the case of-"
She abruptly stood up, unable to take any more of his ridicule, "I shouldn't have asked you to come here. This was a mistake".
His piercing eyes studied her curiously, "... You were telling the truth. In that phone call. You... You
Taking a deep breath, Sherlock raised his hand to his mouth, and swallowed, snide comments of 'freak' and 'stupid' and 'worthless' playing on repeat in his head.
stomach, Mycroft noticed, staring in fascination as the man shifted slightly and his shirt rode up. That, combined with rather low-hanging boxers, made the silver-haired detective rather...
He turned around once more, to face his future wife, to get her to confirm it, to get her to say 'I love you', to get her to-
"I thought as much" Sherlock muttered, eyes flicking over the face-down figure with interest, "Clearly premediated, though a lot messier than the previous two... I need to talk to Lestrade".
"... Good" He finally replied, "That's... That's good. Where are you right now? I checked the flat yesterday but Mrs Hudson said you were gone".
"I can imagine" He replied sympathetically, "Mycroft's even more emotionally buttoned-up than that moron in the shower. I'm surprised he even gave in and kissed you to begin with".
Mycroft, with a split lip but proud grin, threw his arm around a shy-looking teen, "Mummy, I'd like to introduce you to Gregory".
Huffing, John turned around and found the mobile half-buried under books on the coffee table, picking it up and handing it to the genius.
He was a doctor. He knew what the first stages of hypothermia were, and right now, his shivering and alertness were dangerously accurate indicators.
He found the detective sitting in the back of an ambulance, his eyes closed in exhaustion, and for a split second, he had to stop and prevent himself from running over there and hugging the clearly pained detective.
It was well after the car had left before he snapped out of it, and he slowly walked back to the kitchen where the pile of pancakes remained.
Lestrade was lying on his back, one arm bent back and resting underneath his head, and the other thrown across his stomach. His decidedly
"No, you don't" He replied, subtly taking a step closer, "Why do you think I waited two weeks before showing up? I needed to find time to get rid of them somehow".
"Well then" He decided, tugging on the sleeves of his pastel blue sweater self-consciously, "Let's start looking".
Cautiously walking over, he hovered next to the bed and reached out, patting the lump unsurely, "You getting up?"
The footsteps got louder as the man came closer, and it was a man, based on the heavy thread and long loping gait, before suddenly stopping a few meters away.
He held up the cigarette, "This bathroom's fire alarm doesn't work. All the rest of them do. It's the only place in the building that I can smoke without getting caught".
Turning back to Sherlock, the doctor gently felt his forehead, frowning when he found it just as warm as when he woke the detective all those hours previous. Double checking that the blanket covered the man's entire body, and that his glass of water was full, he finally straightened up and turned to face the police officer.
They walked towards the main doors in a companionable silence, and Greg found himself thanking the elder Holmes for it. He was a quiet man, after all, and he appreciated the time to get his head together.
"We all thought you were an idiot, Sherlock" Eurus replied, "We've had nothing else to go on until now".
The younger man watched as the fire flickered, the flames reflecting in his eyes, "... He was the one who found me, you know. Back when I... when I overdosed... I don't think he ever forgave himself for not seeing the signs, and I... I never forgave myself for making him have to... He sends Lestrade in every so often under the pretence of a drugs bust, just to make sure that I am, in fact, still clean".
under the man's intense gaze, and he quickly coughed and took a step forwards to distract himself from those piercing blue eyes.
The man didn't even pause, simply picked up his umbrella and stepped out into the hall, "Thank you for last night, Gregory".
He looked up at the man's face, the heavy bags under his eyes, the seemingly permanent frown marring his forehead, and the faint scars that John had never seen before disfiguring his right cheek and drifting down past his jawline to disappear under his shirt's collar.
"Well it was either that or leave her at home alone" He shot back, "And contrary to popular belief, I am
Already he could tell that the judge was favouring the detective over his wife, especially when Mr. Jones declared that the only reason Mrs. Lestrade had bought the apartment, was so she could have an affair with the PE teacher behind her husband's back.
Those same officers all came to an abrupt stop when they saw just who, or rather what, was joining the man for lunch.
attitude, he's trying to win us over to keep Rosie happy, but not because he actually wants to. Therefore, it's not serious for him. He's 16-years-old, a chancer, he doesn't care if this relationship works out or not. Hence the cheating".
"Well that shouldn't be too hard, considering you never work anyway!" came the snappish reply, and the older man glared, standing up from his crouch over the body, "Says the man with a made-up job title!"
The startled blonde, wearing pale pink today, stared at him for a moment before slowly, ever-so-slowly smiling and shaking it, "John Watson".
Mary was funny and intelligent and beautiful and they'd been going out together for just over two years now and this was meant to be the happiest day of his life...
The solider slowly nodded, "Alright... Alright, then, you... you overdosed as a teenager because of moronic idiots who didn't see your gift for what it was. Just that. A
Crouching down next to him, he quickly rolled the officer onto his back, stomach rolling sickeningly when he saw blood staining the man's shirt.
"Lucky sod" He replied, "Will you be home by tonight? I have a few cases I could do with your opinion on".
He started feeling the effects almost immediately, as his breathing hitched and his mind got fuzzy, and he was distantly aware of falling back and hitting his head off something sharp.
Stepping back, Sherlock turned to John, panting slightly, only to find the ex-soldier staring right back at him, eyes wide.
Mycroft stumbled back a few steps and stared at him in shock, blood dripping down his chin and onto his expensive shirt collar.
He must have been standing on something on the next stall over, as he easily leant over their shared partition, his head, a mess of dark curls, was resting on his right arm, elbow bent and propped up on the dividing wall, and his left hand was holding a cigarette, one, which, even as she stared, he took a careless drag from, seeming completely unperturbed as he gazed down at her with glazed icy blue eyes.
He had planned on making a silent and quick exit, honestly, he had... until he saw the man asleep on the sitting room couch.
with the subtle ways they'd been making the man slowly lose his mind, and had declared they needed to do something drastic.
There were many strange things about one Sherlock Holmes, John had quickly noticed only minutes after moving in.
John frowned, turning around on the spot and eventually spying a small crack of light coming from the floor in front of him. Silently creeping forwards, he fell to his knees awkwardly, shoulders protesting from the movement as his hands remained tied behind his back and tried to peer underneath the door.
His smile widened as he bookmarked the page in his medical journal, stepping out from behind the counter and leading the way down the back of the store.
Dragging himself out of bed, he threw on an old jumper and yesterday's jeans before wandering out into the sitting room, just as Sherlock called out "It's open!" and Lestrade, Donavon, and Anderson walked in, all in various stages of exhaustion.
His person suit wasn't quiet up to scratch, standing out in all the ways that John blended in. But then again, whereas John was underestimated because of his averageness, Sherlock was underestimated because of his extremeness. No one expected the self-proclaimed sociopath to be a serial killer, precisely because it was incredibly likely that he was a serial killer.
Sherlock peered over the crib curiously, staring in wide-eyed wonder at the silent baby looking back up at him.
Cautiously reaching out as the excitement once more built up to a crescendo, he pulled the rope keeping the box together, and let the packaging fall apart in his lap.
"I don't know how because I've never had to explain it to someone" Mycroft continued, mouthing his words down his neck and along his collarbones.
He shook himself out of it, and turned back to the mirror, reciting the mantra that he had long since drilled into himself.
And so, an entire painful night later, they finally got the go ahead and geared up, no one questioning the detective's brother or blogger as they also strapped on bullet proof vests and got into the van.
"It could be in here" He finished, and the blonde nodded, tugging his yellow sweater sleeves down over his hands almost shyly, "I can help you look, if you like?"
"Dilated pupils" the genius replied, keeping his gaze on John's, "Stiff muscles, blue lips, loss of motor control... Get an ambulance".
Sherlock, however, simply grinned wider and spun on his heal to leave, "It's about time that you two get together. Don't disappoint me. See you on Monday!"
"The feelings mutual, sir" Kyle replied, happy to have an excuse to leave John's intimidating presence, "Unfortunately, though, I'm afraid it's getting quite late, and I have go or my mum will start worrying. It was lovely meeting you both!"
"Go get paramedics" Lestrade ordered, finally managing to snap open the handcuffs, "We'll meet them upstairs".
Turning on the kettle, the doctor smirked, pulling the garden-centre receipt from his pocket and binning it.
When he saw Mycroft hovering protectively over his victim, however, he scowled and raised his gun, pulling the trigger as he aimed for the younger man's head.
"Just delete- Actually, you know what, I'm not even going to ask" She brushed back her hair once more, "Just... It'll take some time, okay. I can't guarantee that I won't make myself throw up again, even if I do start to recover... It's just not that easy".
The stranger took another step, and another and another, until he was standing in the little clearing with a smirk on his face.
It was quiet and small with an old stove in one corner and two beat-up couches in the other, while the main area was littered with mix-matched chairs and three-legged tables, and he honestly couldn't think of a better place to go for a first date.
It took him mere seconds to change, and when he remerged from his room, he immediately walked over to John.
Standing up on the chair, he quickly forgot his earlier question, and instead slowly raised the glass up to the ceiling, only to catch a web on the way there which sent the spider spinning around in circles.
He slowly reached up and cupped her cheek, and her own hands came up to hold him there, leaning into the warm touch.
"Usually, yes" He agreed, "Not, however, with a broken wrist... The swelling makes it rather difficult to slide the cuff off".
The younger man didn't even glance at him, instead stalking towards Lestrade much like a cat would stalk its prey, and it irritated the man to no end knowing that the genius could evoke such a primal fear in him as this.
The boy spun around to face him, and Mycroft quickly estimated he was around 12 years of age and quite... jealous?
"Viva le vida" He agreed, slowly but surely moving to stand in front of John, his hands raised in an act of surrender, "But Moriarty always did love having an audience".
The man had nodded, told him to ditch the therapists, and then disappeared into the dark forest around them.
"You have my work number" He replied, looking rather shy all of a sudden, "That's... that's my personal number".
Sighing, he gave the man an irritated look before reluctantly signing for the package, commenting on his affair with the gardener, and promptly slamming the door shut as the man attempted to take a furious swing at him.
Not until Sherlock returned from the dead, explained why he had to die to begin with, and then say how Mycroft was the man who had helped orchestrated it.
A split second later, he had yanked himself back and swung a mean right hook that completely caught the genius off guard.
Together, both men poured over the six different place names, debating and discussing which was the more likely, working rather
He hadn't gotten caught, he wasn't stupid enough for that, and even now he sat on the toilet lid with his knees drawn up to his chest, completely invisible to anyone looking under the door for feet.
" He replied unashamedly, "You mothering Sherlock, all domesticated like. And Sherlock himself, who'd
"I don't care about what I can find out about you myself" He panted, trailing kisses down his already-bruised neck, "I only care about what you can tell me".
Slowly blinking, he looked up at the wild-eyed genius, distantly noting that his shivering had stopped.
She sighed, "I can't... It's not that simple! I can't just decide not to- not to- stop hating my body, or whatever!"
She felt tears prickle behind her eyes, and shoved away her coffee cup, hands coming to clutch tightly at each other instead.
"Here, let me" He found himself saying, voice strangely husky as he stepped forwards, well into the younger's personal space as he reached up and caught the book from the top of the stack.
Following the soldier's line of sight, he saw the kidnapper collapsed against the wall in front of him, a single neat bullet hole in the middle of his forehead.
Anderson as they arrived at the body, an insult that the infamous pathologist heard, and reacted to.
He quickly spun around only to find a thankfully less-fuzzy-looking Sherlock staring back at him, bewildered.
Slowly unfurling long legs until they rested on the pale tiles below, he slid back the lock and stuck his head around the stall door.
He drifted in and out of semi-consciousness for what felt like forever, vaguely recalling injections and bandages and nurses and doctors and the only constant presence that remained was a familiar hand holding tightly onto his own.
It was in history class, one of his Year 13 subject choices, and his teacher had just started discussing World War 2 and its most prominent figures.
His theory was only further proven when his internal clock struck midnight the same time he heard the unmistakeable toll of Big Ben in the background.
"Greg" He corrected, "I'm dating your brother, my name can't possibly be considered irrelevant now".
He didn't realise how many hours, exactly, he'd been searching, until suddenly his book was slammed shut and he was pulled into a tight hug from behind.
Hair pulled back in a loose ponytail, with strands already failing around her face, smudged lipstick, smudged mascara, and tears streaking the cheap foundation she had decided to try today.
Spinning on the spot, coat billowing out behind him, John only just about managed to lunge at the man and grab his arm mere seconds before he marched away.
with the majority of the football team. And your father's an alcohol. And he doesn't love your mother, he only stays for you and your sister's sake. And your mother hates being tied down by you. And-"
Sitting down on the edge of it, he stared at the pillow where Mycroft's head had been resting only an hour before.
Sure, he had a file as wide as his arm on him, detailing all the officer had done from the day he was born until now, but he wasn't foolish enough to believe that a binder could tell him everything about something, least of all everything about a particular human.
He jumped, startled, having not heard the man return, and Gregory smiled softly at him, cautiously reaching out and taking his hand, "... Come on, I'll order us some takeaway".
"A binder" He couldn't help but correct, "I... I have one on everyone who comes into contact with Sherlock".
Sherlock remained motionless, eyes wide, mouth open, looking for the better part, as if he was in shock.
"Yes, the East Wind" He agreed, reaching in as she held up a chubby arm, tiny fingers immediately wrapping around his thumb.
Steeling himself just outside the bookstore, Lestrade swore for the millionth time that hour of how unfair it was that the insufferable bastard was right.
He heard muttered curses as a key was shoved into the lock of the metal door, before suddenly it was flung open and his senses were filled with-
"... I told him half of the truth" He admitted, "The fact I was being bullied mercilessly, that I hated myself for being different... but never the details. To be honest, I actually feared what he would do, should he have found out. Especially the... especially with the names they called me".
"... It's not my place to say" He finally admitted, "If you really want to know... you'll have to ask Sherlock himself".
He kept tabs on everyone Sherlock spoke to, of course, because it was that same over-protectiveness that had saved his younger brother from being kidnapped many times before. And one of those person-of-interests just happened to be Detective Inspector Lestrade.
It took only three hours for John to notice, as the detective had made planned for them to go to dinner that same night, and given that there were no active cases on at the moment, he'd had no reason to miss it.
Molly stared up at him, taking in his now-frazzled appearance, all wild eyes and even wilder hair, and couldn't help but smile even as the first tear rolled down her cheek.
It was 10 minutes later before he managed to stumble outside with a split lip, a bruised eye, and an obvious limp.
Waking up in a brightly-lit and sterilised room hadn't been much fun, as all his senses slowly came back to him one by one, forcefully dragging him back from the warm embrace he'd laid in.
"Anytime you get the urge to hurt yourself, you'll tell me" He said, reaching out for her phone which she cautiously gave, "And anytime I feel the urge to get high... I'll text you".
Walking into the small room, he was more than surprised to see one Mycroft Holmes awkwardly hovering next to a plate of what most certainly were pancakes, full dressed and with a rather endearing blush on his cheeks.
The bright police lights did little to brighten the dark evening, and did even less to reveal the features of the dead woman lying face down in the middle of the alleyway.
When they ended up in the creaking house with the women in the pink coat, nothing changed, and John observed the genius's bickering with Donovan, grudging respect for Lestrade, and angry muttering about the 'incompetent' forensic scientists in silence.
He watched carefully as she narrowed her eyes at him in the mirror, an almost calculating look coming into her eyes.
"Well that's simple" Sherlock had said, flashing him a blinding white grin, "Anderson believes in vampires".
"Well then" The Elder began, "I can correctly assume that you now know Gregory and I are... in a relationship".
intentional... The wife gone away for the weekend, I presume? And you had just that little bit too much to drink, so you literally
"With what?" Mycroft asked quickly, but the doctor shook his head, "Not an aesthetic, but there's a fresh track mark on his arm, so probably an opioid. And he's been hit a few times as well".
John stared back at them defiantly, before slowly, predatorily, stalking towards the grounded pathologist, strangely satisfied with the flinch he got in return.
"Probably something about trying to make friends" the younger brother replied, and the elder nodded, "Oh, yes.
The detective sighed and obeyed, shutting his mouth as he leant back, and stared the forensic scientist in the eye, daring him to move.
Staring at him for a minute, the doctor frowned, "... Did you just admit to being afraid of something? The great Sherlock Holmes? Of an
He tried to put on a smile, tried to lighten his heart, tried to at least pretend that he was happy.
John glanced up at them, and idly patted the furry creature resting on his shoulder, "Yes. He is. Can I help you?"
Greg slowly came to a stop once they left the court house, and quickly put a hand on Mycroft's arm to halt him as well.
John looked up at the happy exclamation, just in time to see his daughter bound into the detective's arms.
But then again, knowing Mycroft Holmes, him being the only one to notice the smile could have been the whole point.
He grinned, and took a step back into his apartment, "Come on, your nose needs seeing to, and I got takeaway".
Silently slipping into the room, John was met with the sight of his daughter standing, hands on hips, glaring at the sitting down detective.
He tightened his grip on the brightly-dressed toddler at his hip, pulling her even closer to his chest.
John crouched down next to the body, ignoring Anderson's annoyed grumbling next to him and instead focusing on the blood clotting the man's hair.
The older brother smiled, knowing that they were okay once more, "Yes. You should taste his red velvet cupcakes sometime".
"Because I want you to know that- that- that I..." He slowly trailed off, unsure how to finish, "I... I wanted to show you that I
The bullet had implanted itself in his shoulder, he'd been told, but thankfully no surgery was needed as no real damage had been done.
A well-placed kick under the table had John finally relenting and breaking the uncomfortable atmosphere.
The genius lurched forwards, flinging himself at the man with a loud snarl just as John managed to grab his arm to pull him back, and Anderson froze, shocked into place as-
Lestrade smirked, "Don't worry, it's not as bad a it looks. And I'm so doped up on painkillers, I can't feel anything anyway".
" He exclaimed, "And until you're in a less-reckless mood, I'm not giving you back your chemistry sets!"
Lestrade quickly turned off the music, finding it not at all helpful right now, before cautiously taking a step towards the detective.
"Well?!" She demanded, but he merely blinked up at her, "I'm afraid I don't know to what you're referring to, honey bee".
"I'm not going to cause you any trouble" the stranger suddenly said, as if reading his mind, "I was in the area, as it were, and couldn't help but notice your injuries making digging more difficult... Perhaps we can come to an agreement?"
It was an entire hour, an indian, and three beers later that Mycroft gathered up the courage to shove the binder into the older man's lap.
Molly gripped his coat collar harder, tugging him down and pulling him even closer as warm lips met her own. Kissing Sherlock Holmes was all that she expected it to be, plus more. His mouth was soft, gentle, but she had no illusions that he couldn't be bruising if he wanted to be. He tasted nice too, like mint and- and smoke? She opened her mouth on request, and all but melted against him in response, his strong arms the only thing keeping her upright.
Sherlock, as quick and agile as always, had successfully managed to pull the tearful Eurus from the circle without anyone noticing, while the eldest Holmes stole everyone's attention by tapping the boy, who had his fist raised, on the shoulder.
"Yes" came the quiet response, eyes still locked with John's, "And you can cancel that ambulance... I've got my own doctor back".
And little Eurus, with tears staining her cheeks but a bright smile on her face, gestured at the young girl standing next to her, "And this is Anthea".
"Stop mocking me!" He complained, and from below them, Anderson rolled his eyes, "Then stop talking! You're making it difficult for me to work!"
She knew it was rather pointless, as no one ever used this bathroom anyway, but she still got a small sense of relief when she saw no feet in the three silent stalls.
There was a huffed laugh by his side and warm fingers intertwined with his own, "I bought milk. For... For when you wake up, I suppose. Though according to the doctors, it'll probably be gone off by the time you come home. Hypothermia, dehydration, a sprained wrist... Guess that'll do that a person, huh?"
Molly's eyes fluttered close as he finally sealed the distance between them, pulling him even closer with hands running through his hair, and she grinned into the kiss.
Trudging over to his favourite armchair, he curled up impossibly small, and stared at the brown-papered box in his hands. The writing was non-descript and unfamiliar, only stating his name and address, and there were no other significant markings on the parcel.
He got the message loud and clear, and reluctantly returned to moodily poking and prodding at his dinner.
Immediately the newspaper was discarded as the man jumped to his feet, "Greg? Are you alright? What's wrong?"
But he'd done as promised, and now remained by his side like a lovesick puppy, fulfilling his every request at the drop of a hat.
He refused to admit that it made his heart beat faster and a cold sweat break out underneath the scene suit.
" He whined, tossing and turning on the narrow couch until he rolled over to face the doctor, flipping his dressing gown over to cover bare feet.
The doctor stared at him for a minute before sighing once more and throwing his hands in the air, "Alright, alright, you don't have to eat. But you're still taking some medicine and I won't take no for an answer!"
"Her ring!" He ranted, "She has a paler stretch of skin where the ring was, and based on the slight bruising on her finger it's obvious that it was taken off recently, and with quite a lot of force too".
"No wedding band... But she has tan lines... Expensive coat but cheap shoes... And mud splashed along the back of her tights, despite it being a dry night..."
" He finished firmly, "That's what you pay him to do, isn't it? And besides... John's looking after Sherlock tonight, but something tells me that you could do with some looking after too".
"John!" He snapped, and if it was anybody else, John would swear they where whining, "I want you to kill the spider. And kill it now!"
Then, just as suddenly, the torch was gone as the basement's dim lamp was switched on, and he was staring up into the worried face of Greg Lestrade.
"How do you know I'm doing something else?" He teased, taking a sip from his tea, and the older man smirked, "Because you're smart. Intelligence usually comes with ambition".
" He whined, causing her to laugh once more, and he couldn't help but smile, eyes crinkling at the edges.
He'd always liked Lestrade, he even trusted him with Sherlock, but until that night, he'd never actually known just how kind a man the detective could be.
She held her breath, watching as his thoughts ran haywire, trying to piece together something she could only
"11, actually" He replied primly, turning back to check on Sherlock, and the boy frowned, "Oh, no, I didn't mean to...
drug dealer. Word has it that he's making a sale in that warehouse as we speak, and Lestrade wanted me to check it out to make sure".
"Yes!" He exclaimed, unable to fight back his wide grin any longer, and the younger man stared at him as if he were mad, "And you... you... you're
The next day, after much coaxing and bribing and I-promise-you's, Rosie returned to school with puffy eyes and a rumbled uniform.
The guy may be an ass, after all, and it was more than a little irritating that they were in the same class despite the 5-year age gap, but
Mary glanced over at Sherlock, "You took your time. Word has it that you've been in London for over two weeks now".
He watched as everyone else in the room left, pausing to give Mr. Jones a small nod as he passed, before suddenly, it was just the detective and the officer that remained.
John would be half-way through his morning shift by now, and neither Mrs. Hudson nor Lestrade ever knocked, and his brother didn't have so heavy a rap-rap-rap. Which could only mean one thing.
Quickly jumping up, he walked over and pulled the door open, the build-up of excitement and anticipation and
"I... No, no, I was... I was not aware" Greg floundered, trying to remember her mentioning anything of the sort.
This attentiveness continued well into the next week, and John found himself huffing exasperatedly numerous times a day due to the genius's antics.
"... Yea. Yea, I do" He finally replied, "Well, I'll let you get back to your... shopping... And call me when you're back, alright?"
He may have been nice and a straight-A student and kind and he may have smiled and stuttered completely innocently and he may even be a fantastic lawyer someday-
He automatically headed over towards the couches, the same place where he and Sherlock always sat when they visited the place, and within minutes, Greg was sitting down across from him, placing two steaming cups on the low table between them.
He couldn't help but smile at how out-of-place the once-arrogant man was, "I can see that. There was no need, you know. I... well... to be honest, I half-expected you to have left by the time I woke up".
"I still don't understand what we're doing here" the pathologist admitted, struggling to keep up the quick-pace the detective set, taking the stairs two at a time.
He shifted on the uncomfortable tarmacked roof, "I just... I thought you might be hungry. You usually have finished eating by now, so..."
"I just want to..." He trailed off, before trying again, "I want to thank you. But... But just saying it won't cut it for me, so... I was wondering if... maybe... I could buy you a drink?"
"Yes" He replied faintly, watching as his sister suddenly got to her feet as another boy marched over, and the band of children around them separated into a wide circle.
He ignored Mrs. No-Longer-Lestrade storming past him on the way out, only realising his mistake as her ex husband turned to watch her leave.
They both turned back to Sherlock and he gave them a rare grin, "Enjoy your date. Also, John, I won't be home this weekend, Mycroft needs my help again as usual, so... you know... make use of it".
Turning back to the body, the ex-soldier bit back a smile as Anderson stared after the detective with a slightly worried expression on his face.
"You're injured" He replied, "And left-handed. And it was your left shoulder that got shot. You're on leave until further notice, and you'll need moving around so you can't stay by yourself in your flat. I've a penthouse in London, I'll be staying there anyway to keep tabs on Sherlock until he's healed, and obviously you'll wish to stay in London so-"
His odd hours and occasional disappearances were actually expected, given the taller man's strange habits and case-obsessed mind.
John put a hand on his arm to calm him, "He's not worth it. Now come on, do you want to solve this murder or not?"
Cautiously walking further into the bathroom, chosen specifically for it's small size and inconvenient placement on the college campus, she bent down and looked underneath the stall doors.
him" Sherlock continued, hating himself for not shutting up, "Also your little sister isn't as innocent as you think she is. In any sense of the word. In fact, I'd even go as far to say that she's... shall we say...
Mycroft shook his head, trying to dispense the ringing in his ears, and from across from him, he saw John do the same, only instead of a phone in the younger man's hand... there was a handgun.
She slowly stood up, turning to face the stall door but refusing to open it, "... Yea... Yea, I'm fine".
He was being held captive in an old warehouse that hadn't been used for many years, and his door was currently being patrolled.
"... No, Sherlock" He eventually replied, gathering the small boy back in his arms, "You may be many things... but a freak most
And when Mrs. Holmes showed up exactly 20 minutes later to collect her three children, she found them waiting by the gate in various stages of disarray.
Half a minute later, she pulled back out the stem, only for it to once more be tied in a perfect knot.
"You know... I was hoping you'd show up" He admitted, "I mean, I wished that you'd come back to live every day, but... today... It just hit me stronger than usually".
"Oh, you can count on it" He replied, a rather worrying smirk forming on his mischievous expression, "And now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a phone call to make".
And if later on, standing by the river as the bloated body was hauled onto the bank, Sherlock loudly announced he was thirsty and dragged John away from prying eyes?
Before he could question him, however, as that was exactly what his inner police officer was screaming at him to do, the judge strode into the room, and Greg spent the next hour trying desperately not to scream back at his wife.
Glancing back up at him, he could only smirk as he saw Sherlock sneak up silently behind the taller boy.
"Sherlock, honestly, I'm fine!" John huffed, unlocking the door to their flat while the genius hovered about him unsurely.
He wasn't as young as he used to be, and handling a shovel was more difficult now thanks to his leg and shoulder. Before the war, it never took more than two hours to dig a grave. Now it was taking him four.
The man nodded, glancing around at the other occupants of the store with what looked like regret, before turning back to him.
"But that's what people do. Be kind" He continued, almost desperately, "John tells his girlfriends that he loves them even when I know he doesn't. As do the people in those god-awful soap operas' that he watches".
His coat had been lost sometime in the struggle at the carpark, and all that remained were faded jeans, his old Nikes, and a threadbare jumper. He was tied up so he couldn't escape, and he had no weapon to fight with even if he could get out of his bonds.
Lestrade abruptly startled, spinning around with the frying raised in self defence, before freezing when he saw him.
"I will do no such thing" Watson shot back, "You're staying here for at least another three days, mister!"
Lestrade abruptly stopped and looked up at him, only to find the man staring back with the tiniest of smiles.
That had only taken half an hour, as the elder Holmes was rather adapt at hacking into various cameras around London, and Greg had dealt with the perpetrators before and had made a list of their usual haunts.
"Jessica?" Mycroft's lips curled in disgust as he straightened up resolutely, "Oh, heavens no. No sibling of mine will have such a boring
Letting his gaze drift across the playground, he found his little sister standing in front of a group of kids playing in the sandpit.
" He finished, shooting Sherlock a dark look at the detective tried to subtly make out notes in the darkness of the room.
"One day just showing up won't be enough" Donavon finished, "One day we'll be standing round a body, and he'll be the one that put it there".
Mycroft quickly decided that he would stay with Sherlock rather than with Gregory, as he knew, logically, that his brother would always be number one on his list.
John was sitting in his usual armchair and glanced up at him briefly before turning back to his morning newspaper, "Sherlock's in the shower. Would you like a cup of tea while you wait?"
It was 13 minutes and 7 cherries later before he gave up, and he angrily spat out the straight stem and tossed it over the edge of the roof.
consulting detective. And all the signs are there, Holmes... Pale skin... Slightly sweating... Nervous fidgeting... Avoiding eye contact... You're scared".
He shrugged bashfully, ducking his head, and John couldn't help but think that the man's personality was the complete opposite of what his skinny jeans, army boots, and black leather jacket portrayed.
"-if these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace" the Priest finishes, and John can't help but give a silent sigh at the pointless line.
that he was left breathless and forced to pull back, gasping for air, the other using that as an excuse to tilt his head back and latch both teeth
"Oh god. Mary" He said, abruptly letting go of the man's shirt and took a step back, turning to face his bride only for Sherlock to grab his arm and spin him back around, "No".
Shooting the padlock on the cell door, Greg kicked it open, and the trio wasted no time in rushing in and running towards the genius who had been held captive for all of 18 hours.
"Ah... no. No, it's... it's actually about Sherlock" came the hesitant reply as the forensic scientist scratched the back of his neck awkwardly, "... How, exactly, did he survive the fall?"
Lighting up, he took a much-needed drag and stared in surprise as Sherlock did the same with ease, closing his eyes in bliss.
"I know, it's... a bit random, but... well... I never grew of the 'cops and robbers' stage from when I was a kid" He laughed, and John felt his heart melt at the sight of crinkled eyes and a genuine grin.
"That he's a-" He purposefully cut himself off, and relished in the way Anderson leant even closer as a result, "He's a...?"
And haphazardly scrawled on the side of it with a black sharpie, staring directly back out at John, was a smiley face and the simple message 'I listened'.
Mycroft ducked his head to avoid his affectionate gaze, and the detective's smile softened as he tossed his phone to the side, hands coming up to loop around the younger man's neck once more, "Now so, where were we?"
She wasn't sick, if she was going to vomit she would have ran straight for the toilet, not paused to check if she was alone or not first. And by checking if she was alone, meant she didn't want anyone knowing what she was doing.
Walking past Mycroft, he ignored his brother's shocked and questioning gaze, and flung himself into the back of his car.
She laughed, then hiccupped, and his raised his hand without thinking about it, gently wiping away her tears.
By age 1, she could have fully fledged conversations with her family, by age 2, she could write and read, surpassing even her brother's early development stages, and by age 3, she could teach Sherlock violin and win a chess match against Mycroft.
Waiting until she had left the room, John turned back to his flatmate, "... Is she insinuating that you punched Kyle in the face?"
"One pound for every week Anderson remains sane. I can't be too obvious, of course, and I can't say the word 'vampire' or anything similar to it, or I'll automatically lose, but if I get him to crack by more... subtle ways, shall we say, then I win. Currently we're on... oh, I'd say just over £200".
"What are you doing out of bed?!" He demanded, marching over to the sheet-clad man who's response, most likely clever yet insulting, was muffled by the cushion he had his face pressed against.
Coming back out into the white college hall, however, she paused, and turned to him one last time, "Hey, um, I was just wondering... who, exactly, are you?"
The blond quickly stood up, wiping sweaty palms on his jeans, and John rolled his eyes at the motion.
"Or- Or a tea? Or coffee, or something? I don't actually know what you like to do, so I'm just speculating here, but I have to repay you somehow and spending a night out doesn't sound like such a bad idea to me, but of course if it's not something you want to do then that's fine too, I just want to make sure you understand how much I truly appreciate this, especially since-"
Sighing fondly at the comatose detective, John made his way to the kitchen, wondering if there was enough milk left for lunch.
John held out his hand after getting a sharp dig in the ribs from his daughter, wondering just how the hell Sherlock managed to get out of the meet-and-greet phase of the evening.
He found himself putting on a charming smirk as he eyed up the sweater-wearing blonde, "Hello yourself".
He slowly trailed off, before blinking once more, and before he could stop himself, his right hand came up to gently rest against the officer's cheek while his left landed rather possessively on his hip.
He took in the ill-fitting suit, clearly something he'd got last minute just to be allowed into the wedding, and noticed how much thinner he had gotten.
John went to speak once more, but was interrupted by a flurry of movement from the door, and both men quickly looked up as Sherlock waltzed in, hair still wet and only his pyjamas on.
And if Anderson caught of glimpse of the ex-soldier's neck in the pale sunlight half an hour later, only to find two strangely-circular marks marring the once unblemished skin?
"How much do I owe you?" He said instead, but the blonde shook his head, "Don't worry about it. I sincerely doubt that anyone else will be looking for it, and it's in a fairly beat-up condition".
John pinched the bridge of his nose, "Fine then. Stay there. But I'm still making you something to eat".
The genius quickly shut his mouth and hovered awkwardly as Lestrade hauled the blushing bride to her feet and the rest of the audience broke out in loud whispers.
Sherlock, holding his wrist protectively to his chest but using his other arm to hold the hand of a red-haired boy, also smirked, "Meet Victor".
He heard a heavy sigh and the scrapping of a chair as it was moved closer, "... I think I finally understand now. Why you always get so angry when I do something stupid. When I... When I do something dangerous... It never clicked why you were always so worried about me, until now... I never had to worry for your safety before. I made sure of that, what with Moriarty and Magnussen and the likes. I just... I never realised until you were taken, that you could be taken... So I do, John, I do understand, now. I understand why you always worry, because now
She proudly pulled the knotted stem from her mouth, while Sherlock stared on in equal parts confusion and awe, before glancing down at his own stem dubiously.
Greg slowly came to a stop, before reluctantly turning and walking back to the smug bastard, practically tossing the cigarette at him, fishing out the lighter from his jacket.
Sherlock scowled, blinking back the tears, and allowed himself to take in everything about the grinning teen in front of him, blocking out his 'friends' taunts and jeers and
It was another 20 minutes later before the vehicle finally came to a stop, and John swore viciously as he hit his head off the metal door in the process.
"Because the only person that I know of who regularly tries to hack my phone, is your brother. And my first name is the only thing on this planet that Sherlock Holmes does not know".
, wrong. Sherlock didn't beg, he didn't plead, he never did anything other than treat her with that dismissive arrogance.
The children were older than her, more around his own age than hers, and despite the fact he knew perfectly well that she was a 3-year-old with far more intelligence than a 6-year-old, the other kids might not see it that way.
The younger Holmes sighed and reached down, his thin body betraying his strength as he easily pulled the police officer to his feet.
The man stood well over six foot, and his height was made even that more intimidating by the long Belstaff coat and the cigarette hanging loosely from his scowling mouth.
"Well if I can't fight her, I'm sure as hell going to fight you!" Sebastian snarled, and Mycroft carefully brought a hand to his mouth, only to find it stain with blood.
The genius tried to drag the quilt back over his head, but John refused to let go, "Sherlock, you're sick".
The genius himself, however, was sitting in his armchair, sipping tea while reading yesterday's newspaper, as bright and bushy tailed as ever.
He had done his fair share of botany over the years and knew quite a number of facts about this particular species.
She couldn't help but recall the events that had started all of this, that midday phone call, holding more danger than she ever knew.
Lestrade automatically reached out and wrapped his arms around the man's neck, pulling him closer. Mycroft leant forwards, pushing him backwards until he was forced to lie back on the couch, mouth gladly opening in response to a probing tongue, and he couldn't help but grin into the kiss as the elder Holmes growled at the intruding binder, catching it and flinging it across the room to where it hit the wall and fell, pages scattering everywhere.
He heard slamming doors, loud footsteps, and muffled voices, before suddenly the back doors were flung open and a bright light blinded him even through the cloth covering his eyes.
John stared at them for a moment, seeming to be in shock, and the elder Holmes growled, "John Watson you are the

Sherlock was already rather fond of the fly trap, and he could easily see it becoming his new pet project, something to keep him far away from boredom and out of that depressive moody slump he'd been in recently.
"See you then" He repeated faintly, suddenly realising that his divorce had only just been finalised and he was already going on a night out with someone else.
Hearing chains creak near him, he turned only to find a boy not much older than he was take the seat next to him and give him a shy smile.
It was only later that night, as he poured over the book with a lit cigarette in his mouth, that he realised with a sudden pang that he'd never gotten the blonde's name.
Sherlock slowly blinked up at them, and John swore when he saw the dilated pupils and vacant expression, "He's been drugged".
"You need to wake up soon. Can you- Will you do that for me? I know that this was all my fault and I don't deserve you to do anything for me right now but... wake up? Please?"
before his gaze drifts back, over his confused family, over his shocked friends, over the bewildered guests, until-
"You and I both" He replied wryly, and she rolled her eyes at him, "Oh come off it, Mycroft, you're not half a sociopath you make yourself out to be. You love him. What's wrong with that?"
He had never really spoken much to the elder Holmes, always put off enough by the man's seemingly arrogant persona to prevent himself from getting to know him, or, at least, until The Fall, that was.
Once she left, he turned back to the man in the bed, wincing when he saw his left arm heavily bandaged and resting in a sling.
He remembered finishing the hole, ten feet rather than eight, rolling in both bodies, and then covering them again. A few minutes of carefully moving plants around, and it almost like they were never there.
"She was planning to murder you?" He finished, "And that's why you're the doctor and I'm the detective".
The younger man had huffed and rolled his eyes, "And Lestrade and I have a bet going. I'm pretending to be a vampire. He doesn't think Anderson will crack but I, on the hand..."
Lestrade reluctantly nodded, "Sure. Tell him I hope he gets better soon, alright? And... just so you know... I sent everyone I know a copy of those pictures".
The elder Holmes gave a brittle laugh, "Oh, of course, the morphine... You probably aren't processing a thing I'm saying".
"And what if I was?" He snarled, purposefully taking another drag to prove a point, "We all have our own vices".
The rest of the audience gasped, startled, and John, Molly, and Lestrade all paled dangerously as they realised he wasn't bluffing.
"... I should go" the elder Holmes finally said, giving Lestrade a wide berth as he practically ran past him to the front door.
When John returned home that night, well after six, he found the genius in the same position, long fingers clasped under his chin and eyes narrowed intensely at the harmless-looking plant.
"No, you're not" came a voice from behind her, and everyone jumped and spun around as Lestrade suddenly stood up, pointing his service weapon at her with confident hands, "I've already lost that crazy son of a bitch once before. I don't particularly fancy losing him again".
a gun..." She mumbled, panting as she reached the top step, and ignoring the dark look he shot her way in return.
He was reeling back by a sharp right-hook, and found himself sprawling back against the metal lockers, suddenly rather dizzy.
They stared at each other in silent for an entire minute, before the elder Holmes nodded, "Right. Yes. Of course, I'll... I'll make the necessary requirements... When are you free to leave?"
"... I shall continue this verbal lashing of your own absurdity and senselessness, and then once again save the day by revealing the bloody
Jerking back, Mycroft all but fell back against the counters on the other side of the small kitchen, suit jacket rumbled, shirt wrinkled, and tie askew. His eyes were wild and his hair was a mess, but
"Who are you?!" He demanded as they began to pull him through an old building, an empty warehouse most likely, based on the smell of damp metal and rust.
"Yes. You are" He replied firmly, though he couldn't keep the amused smile off his face, "Now come on, you're freezing. Go for a shower, and I'll fix you up some soup or something, yea?"
It was many hours later, days even, after the case had been solved and the murderer apprehended as the pair sat in their trademark armchairs with tea and biscuits, that Sherlock finally told him.
He knew he lived off campus, flat shared with some other bloke going to med school, and that he was a certified genius, still only a teenager if the rumours were anything to go by.
John stared back an him blankly, and Sherlock sighed over-dramatically, "The Victorian engineer? The man behind the Greta Western Railways?
"I did no such thing" He replied evenly, and she threw her hands in the air, exasperated, "Of course you bloody well don't, because it's not like you'd ever admit to it, now, is it?"
The 8-legged creature dangled down a bit further, and Sherlock hesitated, taking a small step backwards.
Mycroft let out a heavy breath that he hadn't realised he'd be holding the second the car door shut behind him.
The blonde huffed and folded his arms across his chest, "Well you can just go and catch it yourself with that attitude".
He had only just poured the boiling water into the mug when he heard a thud next to him, and John jumped, spinning around and almost spilling the kettle all over himself only to find that Sherlock had migrated from his room, and had just collapsed on the couch.
He glanced over at the door longingly before turning to the kitchen, sighing as he put back down his umbrella, pulling out his phone.
"I'm going to take that as a complement" He shot back, blinking rapidly to adjust his eyes to the new light, "And, believe me, I would get up only..."
"I don't know how" He rumbled, "Because there's not enough words in the English language to adequately express these emotions I feel every time you're near me".
, Sherlock mused as he heard doors being kicked open and "Police, freeze!" being yelled from the ground floor above him.
Sherlock bumped shoulders with him and he suddenly realised that he'd just taken a life for this man.
"Of my sister sitting next to your friend" Mycroft explained, "You were jealous, because you thought she'd stolen him from you... That's why you tried to fight her. To win him back".
Sherlock solves it, of course, just as he solves every case thrown their way, and John briefly wonders what will happen when one day it's their own murders that they're looking at.
"So whoever loses, will also lose a lot of money" John had replied carefully, "... I'm going to make sure we win this bet, Sherlock. And we're going to win it soon".
This had unfortunately become a somewhat normal occurrence, and even now, in the middle of their traditional Friday night movie marathon, when she shouldn't even have her phone to begin with, she was texting.
"You go first" John said, and Greg frowned, "Yea, yea, I know him. He's in most of my classes. He's the friend who recommended your bookstore to me. How do
She gave him a warning look as she past, and Mycroft frowned, confused, before suddenly realising that it was most likely because she'd gotten her boss shot.
Ducking down, Sherlock paused momentarily, taking in her wide eyes and tear-stained face, and felt something odd grip at his heart. Ignoring the feeling, he let his other hand come up to rest at the base of her neck, and finally closed the distance between them.
Greg stared up at him cautiously, noting his slick hair and sharp suit, and wondered just how, exactly, a man of his stature worked for such a measly firm.
Sauntering onto the scene, John half-jogged behind him to try and catch up as the detective made his way over the body of a young man, not much older than he was himself.
John couldn't help but smirk three days later as Sherlock finally returned from his stake out with the homeless community, passed out facedown on the couch, clothes torn and filthy and someone else's blood speckling his uncombed hair.
He was fine, he was better, he was back at work with the hospital's approval, but Sherlock's flittering and hovering remained, awkward and sweet as he ensured John didn't even have to reach for the TV remote.
has changed!" He growled, stabbing his fork in Lestrade's direction, "Just how, exactly, am I meant to take a crime scene seriously anymore, when I now know for a fact that the homicide detective in charge bakes
"I thought it was rather too obvious, the hints I gave you. Honestly, I practically named every landmark in a 10 mile radius around us".
Molly sat in the café, both hands wrapped around a long-since cold cup of coffee, wondering whether or not it was a mistake to come here.
He was suddenly yanked back as his schoolbag was grabbed from behind, and before he could blink there was a hand gripping the collar of his shirt and he was suspended an entire foot off the ground.
He caught him staring and sighed, "Yes, I know, a rather tall fellow, isn't he? I do so hate the tall ones, they're always more difficult to get rid of".
The taller man also stopped, and gave him a look of such contempt that he didn't need proper light to see it. "
"Did she tell you what happened?" John asked, watching her get on the bus from the sitting room window.
Mycroft took one look at him, before sighing, and taking the seat next to the younger Holmes, Greg quickly brushing past to get dressed.
He could already feel his barriers crashing down, and the tidal waves of emotion were all telling him to do the same one identical thing.
Decidedly nervous, she shifted from one foot to the other, "I can still kill you. I'm the only one here that's armed".
Leaning against the side wall, he had stitches running along his hairline and cheek, and there was thick tape holding his nose in place. There were dark rings under his eyes, and even darker bruises marring his arms and chest, the latter too heavily bandaged to make much of, and his left arm in a sling.
Now that Gregory was, in fact, staying with him, it gave him amble opportunity to confess his not-so-little crush, now, didn't it?
"Yes" Gregory replied, before suddenly flushing, "I... I mean it makes sense... I can't stay by myself right now, and I do want to stay in the city so I... yes?"
He hummed thoughtfully, "Though I suppose your friend knew all this, based on his expression, and wanted to see you fight. You're close, a bit
Half an hour later, and John had to reluctantly admit that he was glad the man had found him. They were making a good headway with the grave, and for all his leanness, the stranger was strong, and for every one shovel of earth John dug up, the taller dug two.
Though, of course, that could have partly done with the bloody murder that was written across bother their faces if they found Sherlock with even just one hair out of place.
John frowned, not liking how scared the usually unflappable detective was, and he carefully raised a hand to place on the younger man's shoulder to calm him down.
And thanks to those cases, John lived quite peacefully right under the very nose of Scotland Yard, integrating himself in such a way as to never be suspected of a single damn thing.
"Look at the body, Lestrade!" He exclaimed, "The way it's positioned, the blunt force trauma to the back of the skull, obviously done in the heat of the moment. And where's her wedding ring?"
Anderson stood next to him, looking decidedly nervous, and he quickly schooled his features into casual friendliness, "Sure. Is it about the case?"
Thankfully finding the books organised by authors last names, he began searching, holding his breath as he trailed his finger along La... Le... Li... Lu-
"It's a criminology book I need for class, written by this Lockley guy" He explained, "But it hasn't been in print for a good few years, and I've been searching for it for
Collapsing back against the door, she quickly brought a hand up to muffle her sobs, taking a few precious moments to try and compose herself.
Mycroft stared at him in silence throughout the whole process, watching as the man's expression varied from shock to anger to
Anderson had staggered back a good three feet before collapsing to the ground, vision blurry and head reeling under the force of the blow.
He couldn't help but snort at the thought, and while the younger man gave him a curious look, he did not ask for an answer.
He blinked, confused, before suddenly trying to sit up, and Mycroft quickly pushed him back down, "No, don't get up, you've been shot... Watson!"
He pouted, "But now you have each other! I can't call you in the middle of the night for a case anymore, knowing that
"Straight ahead, third row on the right" He replied, and Greg nodded once before obeying, smirk still in place.
He found himself smiling simply at the sight of the young man, and he got a flash of white teeth in response which only contributed to the fluttering of butterflies in his stomach.
Making sure that John was taking care of Lestrade, he kneeled down next to the genius, "Yes, brother mine, I'm here".
She stared at their defiant faces, took a deep breath, and then thanked whatever deity that was out there, that she hadn't tried for a fourth child.
Leaving the shovel in place, standing upright in the soil, he slowly turned as he heard more leaves being trod on. He had his old army revolver resting comfortably in his coat pocket, and if he had to dig two graves tonight, then so be it.
And based on the shrinking back of the other officers as John walked back to stand at his flatmate's side, the message had been received loud and clear.
"So I've got a few cuts and bruises, who cares?" He shot back, angrily tugging at the bandages surrounding his arms and chest, "John'll sign me out tonight".
She smirked at the absolute lack of hesitation but he refused to let himself flush under her knowing gaze.
"... Okay then" She eventually said, trying not to laugh at the absurdity of the situation, "What's in carton number one?"
"It's okay, Sherlock" Lestrade soothed, reaching across to take his hand, "Mycroft and I may be together now, but that doesn't mean we don't love
Storming out of the stall, she heard it slam shut behind her as she angrily marched away, completely unexpecting the warm hand that wrapped her wrist and spun her back again.
From then on, they were inseparable, and it was clear from the beginning that the youngest Holmes child was just as, if not
Sherlock bristled but ignored the insult, and continued to walk away from the classroom, blocking out the heavy steps of the four boys following him.
"... You have to explain this to me" He finally said, and the elder Holmes nodded, "Yes. I know. But I don't... I don't know how to".
He stands up straighter and smiles crookedly at Mary as she arrives next to him at the altar, and she smiles softly back.
"Not specifically!" He defended, "I just... I just said he shouldn't be so logical all the time. That he should...
"Got anything with meat in it?" the genius asked innocently, and the man slowly nodded, "Yea. I think we've got beef somewhere..."
"A criminal justice book, this time. My professors seem to get a kick out of giving me ancient books to read".
"Well it's about time you showed up, Inspector, I was beginning to lose faith in your, albeit minimal, detective skills".
"So, come on, who's this guy that we're tracking, anyway?" Molly asked a few minuets later, and Sherlock gestured at the building directly across from them, "A suspected drug dealer. A suspected
Her nose wrinkled at the old nickname, but John knew full well that the detective would never relent.
"One kiss, Sherlock. Just... Just one kiss, please?" She asked desperately, "I need... I need closure. Just one kiss and- and- and then I'll let you go".
"Of course I'm angry!" She snarled, uncaring of the odd looks from nearby customers, "You can't honestly believe that there's nothing we need to discuss!
Lestrade watched in silent confusion as Mycroft left his apartment bock three stories below and quickly walked to the awaiting non-descript black car that pulled up the curb with perfect timing.
He pouted and turned back to the crib where greeny-grey eyes gazed back at him, "She got mummy's eyes. They're too green to be mine".
At the other end of the seat, Anthea looked up and raised a single eyebrow at his rumbled appearance.
Unfortunately, as usual, Sherlock was right, and it was less than 15 minutes later that Mycroft found himself standing outside the officer's room.
He made a face, "God no. I prefer as little interaction as possible with those hyped up over zealous meat slabs who only got into college because of their lack of brains and multitude of muscles".
the subtle, he knew just where to meet the particularly shading-looking teenager for the means to an end.
It quickly became apparent that Sherlock was of the same mindset as him in that regard, and while the detective threw just as many cruel insults and callous remarks in the older man's direction, he also seemed to act just that little bit...
The boy hadn't even asked for ID, and the £100 note given as a birthday present from Uncle Ruddy had taken him surprisingly far.
He shook his head and strode into the dimly lit coffee shop, immediately spying the small brunette sitting by the window in the corner.
"But" She countered, "It would also show him that you're serious about this. That you do, in fact, know him. Perhaps not by traditional methods, but..."
She took a deep breath to push away her tears and turned to look out the window just as a taxi pulled up outside.
"Then why ask me to repeat myself?" came the level response, and John stared at him in shock, "... You OD'd when you were just 15-years-old?"
"Who do you think she works for?" He replied, keeping his eyes on the woman standing in front of him, "Or, rather,
"And then... what? Call in backup?" She questioned, sucking on a cherry pit, and he nodded, "Exactly. I said I'd text him as soon as this guy leaves... A rather dull case, I must admit, but John threatened to shoot me if I didn't accept. Apparently, I'm not very good company when I'm bored".
"... Is that what they used to call you, then?" He eventually asked, voice taught with anger, "A freak?"
The older Holmes, having only just recently turned twenty, pulled back with a sharp glare, "What am I doing here?
The younger Holmes sighed, and looked over at his companion for the first time, "I want you to kill a spider, Watson. It's not murder".
Reaching forwards, he lifts up the veil covering her face, and she takes hold of his hand as they both turn as one to face the priest.
John counted the minutes until he got too cold to do so, and so when he finally did hear the slamming of doors and angry shouts of Scotland Yard, he could only estimate how long he'd been held captive for.
But apparently, John was too boring and Sherlock was too eccentric for either of them to have killed her, and so the case moves on.
And what was even more unpredictable, and definitely the beer's fault and not the fact he found himself enjoying the quick-witted man's company, was the fact that he had said
"Just... go back to getting witness statements" He ordered, sighing, "And Sherlock... call a babysitter next time, alright?"
She slowly reached forwards and picked up another cherry, beyond confused, and placed it in her mouth.
And if later that night, after Mycroft brought him home, after the police were called off, after Mummy simultaneously screamed at him in anger and cried tears of joy, he went up to his room, bone-tired, and found a book labelled
Staring down at his plate, he couldn't help but push it away, suddenly finding himself not very hungry.
A burst of gunfire from outside the cell, had all three men flinching away from the door, just as a bloody yet grinning stranger ran in.
" Sherlock whined, rubbing his jaw, and John sighed loudly, "I told you to go last week, Sherlock, so you have no one to blame here but yourself!"
And then, the moment passed, as he took another inhale from his cigarette and her eyes zoned in on the cloud of smoke.
John groaned as the van hid a pothole in the road and he was tossed around in the back. It had only been 15 minutes since he'd been in Tesco, once again fighting with the self-service checkout machine and cursing himself for ever storming out.
"Meaning it's just for him that your force yourself to throw up, is it?" He shot back, turning to face her fully, "You believe it yourself".
He sighed loudly and blew out a puff of smoke, "People never do... It's not much of a love life, is it, when you don't even love him".
The dark-eyed woman folded her arms across her chest, squaring up to him, "Fine. Then how about we make a deal?"
He never cared, of course he never cared. What was it that he called himself? A sociopath? No emotions. So, she tested him, made him give into his
John watched from afar at first, as Sherlock did the most peculiar things, such as carefully avoiding sunlight and almost
"And if you hadn't been there, or if John hadn't been there, then I would have gotten shot anyway. I may have taken a bullet that was meant for you, Mycroft, but it was in no way your fault".
Lestrade stared at him, an incredulous grin slowly beginning to make its way across his face, "Hang on a minute... You used to pay criminals to steal purses whenever I was near... so you could
Lestrade shook his head at his boyfriend's antics, "Let's just... see what happens, okay? And if at any time, you feel left out, then... we'll talk about it, alright?"
Calling Lestrade and then Mycroft, all three men had converged at Baker Street to pull out CCTV footage and track the kidnappers.
Mycroft just continued to stare at him in shock, no doubt confused from this sudden turn of events, and the police officer couldn't help but feel a smug sort of satisfaction for putting the wide-eyed look on the usually unflappable man.
"Yes... Kyle... It's good to finally meet you too" He reluctantly said, "Dinner's nearly ready, so why don't you two... stay in the sitting room".
She was 6 months old when she started speaking, and much to the younger brother's approval and the elder brother's shame, her first words were "Sherlock".
The largest of Venus fly trap family, it had traps surpassing two inches in length and grew in large batches, maximising food intake. It had bright red interiors and a green outside, with short petioles. It also required a lot of light and water, but could survive up to 3 months without food, and live for over 15 years.
Later, as they both sat in front of the fire, Sherlock proclaiming his boredom every few minutes while John tried to read the newspaper, he decided to bring it up.
He sighed, "And while that may be, Sherlock, we all have to do things we don't like every once and a while".
His thoughts were abruptly cut off by the numerous buzzing and beeping from all over the room, and everyone frowned, pulling out their respectable phones as John's heart froze
fault! And so, as an act of rebellion, he took Molly with him to the next crime scene, not that the doctor minded much considering the long shifts he was currently pulling down at the clinic, but
Standing up, he carried the small creature to Sherlock's room, carefully placing him on the bed inside, winking at the detective that stood by the window, before returning to the sitting room, secretly smirking when he caught Anderson staring at the blood vials on the kitchen worktop in horror.
"Just kill the spider, John" He growled, but the doctor refused to let the matter go, "No. If you're not scared of it, then prove it".
, but was cut off as Lestrade jogged back in and turned to face him, "I've got a patrol car bringing her to the station, and an ambulance has been called. Is everyone else alright?"
The younger Holmes, however, ignored him, and continued to look expectantly at his brother, "Well? Are you engaged yet?"
"I'm fine, I'm fine, don't worry" He quickly replied, walking over to sit down across from the man, "Or... at least... I think I am".
He caught a glimpse of stacked boxes, before army-issued boots walked past, and he jumped back in fright, landing heavily on his right arm.
Sherlock was sitting at the breakfast bar with an uneaten plate of pancakes in front of him, still in shock and still silent, 15 minutes later when his brother did indeed finally return home.
They track the phone, Sherlock disappears in a cab, and he realises too late that the entire thing was a set up.
Stepping into the small room, he found himself automatically flushing at the reminder of how the older man had all-but pressed himself against him only days before.
Sherlock nodded once, before continuing on back towards the entrance of the alley, carefully avoiding any patch of sunlight along the way.
Sherlock quickly paid the cab fare before turning to face the small café Molly had asked him to meet her in.
She self-consciously tugged a piece of brown hair back behind her ear as she glanced up at him, "Is my addiction really all that much different from yours?"
" He snapped, finally standing up and turning the door knob, smirking when it opened with a single push.
"I don't know, I guess... I've always been able to do it? I don't really think about it" She admitted, before suddenly reaching down and handing him a cherry, "Try it".
"Well this is ghastly" Mycroft announced after approximately 0.7 seconds of arriving at the playground.
He meekly pointed towards the sitting room, cursing his luck for his daughter getting her mother's temper.
"I think..." He began carefully, even as he pulled her impossibly closer, "I think, Molly Hooper, that I'm in love with you".
Then suddenly, the older man was looking past him at someone else who had just come in, and quickly stood up and waved a hand, "Sherlock! Come here a minute!"
The body parts in the fridge, for example, were all obviously part of Sherlock's experiments, and not because John thought the eyes of his latest victim were simply too pretty to let go of just yet.
"I'll listen from now on, I promise" the voice responded, a steely determination audible, "Whatever you want, I'll get it, I promise".
Molly paused, feeling her heart tighten painfully in her chest at the admission, before quickly jogging after him as the billowing coat disappeared around the side of the door.
Gaze drifting past his brother's shoulder, his eyes landed on a six-inch-thick medical journal written on 'The Science behind Sociopathy'.
"Of course not" He replied calmly, reflipping open his newspaper, "I got her Uncle Mycroft to do it".
Clearing his throat once more, he put down the frying pan, and took another step closer, "Sherlock, I... There's a perfectly good explanation for this".
"You know, I may not be an expert on this whole 'dating' thing, but I believe it's common knowledge that you find out what the man's
"No, it wasn't, and you know it" She snapped, "Just because there currently isn't a sniper pointed at Lestrade's head doesn't mean you're any less willing to lay down your life for him".
"No one knows why you have blue eyes Sherlock, in fact genetically speaking, you are something of an outlier".
They were best friends, perfectly balanced, and the only people that could understand each other, and she was clearly the baby of the family, despite being the most gifted.
He felt... strangely lightheaded, and that tight hold on his heart was squeezing with a vengeance now but he wasn't displaying any other symptoms of a heart condition, but now that he thought about it, he was feeling rather... euphoric, almost like how he used to feel when high. And his stomach was twisted in knots and his palms were sweaty and his thoughts were fuzzy and-
