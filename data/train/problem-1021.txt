They drove home in the small family car and John told her a bit about his year so far. She nodded along, not understanding a thing. But he tried to get as much out of this precious window of time before arriving home, told her about the fantastical things he'd experienced. She told him a bit about home. And her friends. She said she'd been to a friend's house a few days ago. "That's nice, Ma", John said happily. But then the car stopped. And he unloaded his small holiday bag, having left the rest at Hogwarts. She took his hand briefly and they entered. The sound of the telly rang through the entire house. And the smell of beer filled the air. It was 5 o'clock. John didn't try to talk to his father. It would only end in conflict. He didn't spare his son one look, only grunting at the presence of his wife, since he needed another bottle of beer.
Victor took his glass again and then smirked at Sherlock. "Alright. Wanna have sex in the bathroom?", he asked in a suave tone. John choked on his drink a little. Sherlock only frowned and deadpanned: "John is here." Johns voice was hoarse when he told them "Um, you guys can-" "If he wants to join...", Victor suggested sweetly. If John hadn't choked on his drink already, he definitely would have done so now. His face was completely red and the two burst out laughing. "Don't worry John, we're not going to-", Victor squeezed in between his laughter. Sherlock pulled himself together. "Just a conversation we overheard a few years ago. This guy was chatting up some other guy and we couldn't believe that it worked. They just introduced themselves and went into the bathroom." John was both relieved and sour at that admission.
"Where are we going?", John asked to fill the silence. "Restaurant we used to frequent a few years back", Victor answered dutifully. John nodded, trying not to picture Sherlock and Victor on a dinner date.
He was tall, slender and handsome. Musclier than Sherlock. His skin was light brown and his hair was lighter and shorter and curled more tightly than Sherlock's. He had a squarer jaw and bushier eyebrows. He was conventionally attractive. John saw how Sherlock was attracted to him. But then again he didn't. What happened to 'Married to my Work'? Then steps behind them were heard. Sherlock. "Where-", he started but was interrupted by Victor. "On the counter!" He pointed at the teacup. Sherlock took a sip. And then apparently downed the whole cup in one go, since he could be heard smacking his lips together as he went over to the sofa. There was a slight limp in his walk. "John, Victor. Victor, John."
Victor was staring at him in amusement, reading his face perfectly. Eventually John sighed. "You're not wrong..." "Duh!", Victor threw in. "I haven't even come to terms with it myself. I don't...." John huffed, hiding his face behind his hands. "I'm not good at this. Emotions, I mean." Victor carefully placed a hand on his shoulder. "For what it's worth, I think you'll manage. And Sherlock's a keeper. I would give you the whole 'Don't hurt him or I'll obliterate you' speech, but I'm sure Mycroft can do that a lot more effectively than me." John started protesting: "I would never-" "I know." Victor smiled encouragingly. He patted John's shoulder again and John thought that maybe, maybe Victor wasn't so bad.
Sherlock climbed in. The two were laying on their sides, facing each other. John could feel Sherlock's breath softly brushing against his skin. It made him shiver. Sherlocks hand moved to rest on the dip above John's hip. "Okay?", he asked. John nodded. Sherlock snuggled a little closer. "Okay?", he asked again. John nodded once more. Then his head moved closer to Johns, their breaths mingling. "Okay?", he asked once more but John answered by pressing his lips to Sherlock's.
After John had finished a transfigurations essay, they headed down to the Great Hall. The second feast in two days only was just as glorious as the one the day before, especially with the carved pumpkins elevating the Halloween spirit. John felt two feasts im two days didn't give the feasts time to be appreciated thoroughly, but sat down nonetheless. When just about every student was seated, listening to Professor Dumbledores words, he felt a tap on his back. He turned around. It was Sherlock. "Move.", he whispered. John, surprised, moved to the side. He stared at Sherlock incredulously. "What are you doing?" Sherlock set his plate, goblet and cutlery onto the table. "Eating, obviously", Sherlock replied and loaded some Shepherd's pie onto his plate. "No I mean here" "I'm not competing, that's for sure. But I have new faces to deduce, a new school to look at and a year to decide whether I want to-" "At this table." "Oh. Well I wanted to sit next to you. Talk to you. If its not okay, I'll just..." Sherlock slipped out of the bench, levitating the stuff he brought with him. John grabbed Sherlocks wrist amd pulled him back down. "No its fine. Im happy you're here, just wondering why... I thought you guys had to sit at the Ravenclaw table." Sherlock snorted "No, I guess that someone just wants to get into Chos pants" John was confused but shrugged it off. "Sherlock, I have a question." "Hm?" Sherlock had his mouth full. "Why did you leave me in the library?" "Sorry, Irene found me and dragged me off. I tried to stop her but..." He made an unreadable hand gesture. "So Irene is your... the girl with the black hair, she sat next to you yesterday, right?" "Yes." John loaded more food onto his plate and continued eating. "And she's okay with you sitting here?" "Yes, she's happy to sit at the Ravenclaw table and waved me off after I promised her to eat something." "Promised her to..." "Oh right. Food is just transport. But it slows my thinking down. Yesterday I wanted to be extra on top to deduce all the new people and I forgot to eat so she thought that was... not good".
the next chapter will be action and plot and ~relationship development~. I'm aware this was not very organised or important but tbh I just wanted this chapter to get over with after having writers block with this fic... but im back :D
They arrived at the crime scene mere minutes later. Sherlock practically jumped out of the cab and jogged into the park. Victor chuckled. "Adorable when there's a murder, isn't he?", he asked John. John blushed furiously and nodded. The two ducked under the tape and Sally did a doubletake. "Who is that?" "Friend of Sherlocks. Victor Trevor!", he introduced himself. He shook her hand and she only stuttered something. John snorted and walked over to Sherlock, who was kneeling next to one of the bodies. All of the corpses had a weirdly large headwound, ultimating in their demise.
It turns out, the murderer was an old school friend, ending a decade-long terrible feud. They tried to make up with another skywatching picnic, something they'd done in uni a lot, according to the friends brought in for questioning. After some digging, John found out the name of the fourth, estranged, friend. And with a warrant to search the suspect's flat, they went searching for clues. In the murderer"s flat, Victor accidentally moved a floorboard. "Sherlock, the weapon is in the floor!", he called out with surprise. They ended up finding a bleach-dripping telescope, which was an unusual weapon for sure but according to Sherlock "not the weirdest murderer weapon I've seen". Victor almost asked, but John's 'Don't'-look advised him to do otherwise.
And the headmasters bright blue eyes also pierced into Sherlock with wonder. "We found her on the school grounds. Sherlock had this great idea to expose her and it worked.", Hermione explained. "Is that so?", Dumbledore asked, eyes still on the Beauxbatons boy. "Yes. She's an animagus. A beetle. Unregistered, obviously", Sherlock explained. "Obviously", Dumbledore repeated. "Sir, what are we going to do?", Harry wanted to know. Dumbledore finally looked away. "I'm going to take care of it. Worry not." "Can you tell us what's going to happen?", John asked. "All you need to know is that she won't be bothering you any more."
Sherlock opened his eyes again. "Sentiment", he stated flatly, as if talking to the wall. He would have to file that under inspection for later. But for now, after having had this revelation, he came to the conclusion that finishing his experiment would be the most efficient use of his time for now.
The next morning Sherlock was one of the first at breakfast, with the intention of eating an apple and packing some things to experiment on later that day. The Goblet of Fire was positioned in the middle of the Great Hall. Sherlock observed some of the possible contestants and tried to deduce who would win. He already knew that Fleur would end up being the Beauxbatons champion, having known her for several years, especially close when Irene and her were an item. She didn't hate him and he could tolerate her but they did not appreciate the other's company enough to be more than acquaintances. Yet when she put her name into the goblet they locked eyes for a moment. His eyebrow raised when she exchanged her snobby expression for a neutral one and turned around to leave. Interesting.
When Harry arrived in the end, they listened to the announcement and then got up as quickly as possible, wanting to escape the cold temperatures. They congratulated Cedric and Harry on their way out and then pushed past them, jogging up the hill. Soon enough they were both curled up with blankets in front of the Hufflepuff dorm fireplace. They were missing out on the celebrations but as it turned out, they were also missing out on the cold everybody else caught.
Sherlock had gone away for winter break, taking Irene with him. John, now a lot more comfortable around Irene bade both of them farewell. He was aware that the two would be returning to the Holmes manor to celebrate 'a meaningless ordeal once having belonged to a belief system restricting human rights but nowadays turned into a sentimental family reunion holiday'. Or 'Christmas', as Irene and John put it. Before leaving, Irene patted John's shoulder. Sherlock hugged a dumbfounded John who carefully patted his back. They seperated. Irene nodded at her cousin and the two disappeared through the fireplace. John himself tried to delay his arrival at home for as long as possible. But eventually time went out and he got up and flooed himself to King's Cross, where he took the train as planned.
"So what exactly is the plan?", John whispered. "I've told you." The crease between John's eyebrows deepened. "Sherlock, you said, and I quote: "As for us, we've got a plan. As soon as we're in, you take the broom and go out. Get yourself somewhere safe where you can spend the night." Sherlock tore his eyes away from him. "We wait. Might as well make yourself comfortable.", Sherlock gestured towards the bed. Johns eyebrows met his hairline. They sat onto it and Sherlock set his shoes onto the ground next to the coat he'd shed. John carefully did the same and climbed under the covers as well. Sherlock turned towards him. In the pitch-dark room John couldn't even see his friend's face. But he felt Sherlocks breath ghosting against his neck. "The wall. There's a passage, there must be. We cannot fall asleep. Whatever comes out of it is what killed Helens sister."
Monday morning also brought in a new edition of the Daily Prophet. Rita Skeeter's latest article was received with just as much muttering and glances to the Gryffindor table as all the ones before. "Isn't it weird? How come she knows all this stuff? In Muggle Law this would be considered violation of privacy." Sherlock was cutting bread. "Well, the wizarding world is behind on lots of things. Science, Electronics, Maths, the fact that fingerprints would be useful in most cases..." John nodded. "But seriously. How can sheknow that Krum asked Hermione to visit him back home? How would she know of a potential relationship between Harry and Hermione?" Sherlock frowned. "There is no potential relationship between Harry and Hermione" John rolled his eyes. "Yes, but apparently they were seen before the first task together and Skeeter invented something." "You know I don't read these articles. Perhaps they're all made-up", Sherlock suggested. John pointed towards the Gryffindor table. Hermione was talking to Harry, frantically gesticulating. And Sherlock stood up. "Where are you-", John started but stopped when Sherlock tugged him up too.
However, he did not anticipate to see the boy from yesterday again. Said boy locked eyes with him rather sooner than later and scrambled out of his seat. Sherlock, neither wanting to get beat to a pulp nor get sent back to Beauxbatons for causing a scene followed his natural instinct and fled.
"Tell me about your brother", John suddendly said, jumping around rhythmically to not be hit by owl poop. Sherlock scoffed "Tell me about yours" That made John suppress a giggle. "You already know" Sherlock looked at him "Did I get something wrong?" John tried not to smile at the other boys horrified expression "Harry's my sister. But yes, Clara was her girlfriend, theyre this on again, off again thing." "Sister!", Sherlock cursed. "There's always something!" "But you were completely right with everything else.", John tried to console him. Sherlock finished writing the letter, rolled it up and tied it to a school owls foot. The owl took off. "He's an official at the ministry. Well, more like he is the ministry. His name is Mycroft." "So he works for the French ministry of magic. What else?" Sherlock frowned. "He doesn't. He's the British Government. Magical and non-magical." "You aren't French?" They looked at each other. "Im half- French. Maman is french and wanted me to go to her old school. Our home however, the Holmes manor, my fathers heritage, lies in northern England.", Sherlock explained. "Oh and I was already wondering why you spoke English accent-free." "I'm fluent in three other languages as well but i dont have five parents." John laughed. "Oh really?" They descended the staircase of the Owlery. "Like what?" Sherlock ticked off of his fingers. "English, French, German, Russian and Italian, plus Latin, but you can't technically speak that and enough Spanish and Bulgarian to pass." Then he made a few symbols with his hands. "Seriosly, sign language?" Sherlock nodded. Then he tapped several times on John's arm.
But the last day of the exams, once the horror was over, Irene and Cho were found sneaking out through the witch statue. Well, they were trying. "Dissindo?" "Dissendio?" "Ugh!" Irene and Cho were annoyed. Sherlock cut in smoothly: "Dissendium" Irene smiled a him thankfully. "Where are you going anyways?", John asked them. "Secret date at Hogsmeade. Don't you guys do that too?" John turned red immediately. "Err we-" but Cho cut him off: "Shit, steps!" And climbed in. Irene followed her suit and Sherlock tugged John along to escape Filch.
The next morning neither of them mentioned it. Sherlock only offered John a soothing spell for his back. John declined. They went to the exam together. Irene smirked at them, knowing Sherlock had not returned to his bed that night. But the curly-haired boy didn't even bother correcting her. Meanwhile, John was very careful not to touch Sherlock. Last night had been a stupid mistake on his part. He didn't want Sherlock to think he fancied him, thereby ending their friendship. But Sherlock seemed to stick to him like glue. While John usually didn't mind Sherlock looking over shoulders, taking his hand to lead him somewhere or nudging his side to get his attention, that day he did.
Dumbledore then held his speech and announced that by tomorrow evening the champions will have been chosen. He set up the goblet and the feast ended.
John was looking at Sherlock over the edge of his cup. He was downing the pumpkin juice like his life depended on it. Molly was glancing at Sherlock too. And Sherlock was rambling off a few of his brilliant deductions again. "No, it's just the mud from the school grounds, but how could you have possibly gotten it onto your robes since the last time I saw you if you didn't meet up with Stella? You don't play Quidditch and it couldn't have been this morning, since the mud would've already been dry by then, remember it rained yesterday evening, not last night!" Mike nodded, a bit fascinated, a bit confused that this boy could tell his romantic walk with his girlfriend from the pattern of mud splashes on the hem of his robes. "So it couldn't have happened any differently. But anyways, how was the date?" Mike smiled with the bare thought of it. "Really nice. We walked alongside the lake and showed each other nice spots on the school grounds we hadn't before. And we ended up kissing before I brought her beck to her dorm." Sherlock did not make any unpleasant or uncalled for comments, just put on a straight face and nodded when Stamford was done. John soundlessly sighed in relief. He was beyond glad Sherlock and his other friends got along. They returned to their meals while Molly opened up about the dream she'd had the night before when the Hufflepuff Head of House, Pomona Sprout walked over to them from a few feet up the table. "Meeting at 4 o'clock this afternoon. For everyone in 4th grade and above it." She smiled and moved on to the next small group where she repeated the message. "The whole house from 4th grade up will meat later?", Molly said, confused. "It would seem so.", Sherlock deadpanned. John gave him a disapproving glance that told Sherlock 'Bit not good. A bit more sociable perhaps?' So Sherlock complied to the silent request. "No idea what for though, any theories?", Molly and Mike weren't sure and John suggested they'd simply find out by attending and dismissed himself and Sherlock.
Everyone was sent to their dorms. Moody was taken to the Great Hall and tied up. Only the Champions, including the now conscious Fleur and Viktor, Sherlock, John and the teachers were still present as Moody's potion wore off. Snape stepped forward and forced the man to swallow Veritaserum. They questioned him and the truth came out. The students were brought to the hospital wing by McGonagall, who then rushed off to assist in the search of Moody's chamber to find the real Alastor.
During the next few days everyone was in a fever of sorts. There was no other topic than the Yule Ball. People who were dating somebody already were coordinating their outfits, dates were being made and a lot of giggling ensued wherever one seemed to go. John for one, was having none of it. He didn't feel like asking somebody, assuming he could hang out with his friends in a group. His mood dropped considerably when Molly got asked out by Greg. They were going as friends of course, but John couldnt really expect to be able to hang out with them since they were likely to spend the evening dancing. Mike and Stella were fairly excited about everything. And he didn't dare to ask Sherlock about it all. John had decided that if he were to avoid the topic completely, no awkwardness and potential friendship-ending situations could ensue.
Victor finished his cup soon and continued chatting to Sherlock. John didn't bring himself into the conversation. At some point Victor stood up and went back to Sherlock's room to get dressed. Sherlock, laying on the sofa until now, got up and reclaimed his chair. Again, there was a subtle limp in his walk. John gulped. Sherlock paid it no mind, checking his phone instead. The robe had loosened a little, showing a deep red mark at the side of Sherlock's neck. John concentrated on the paper again. After a while Victor came back, now dressed. He left with the words "I'll see you later, then. Join us, John!".
Sherlock retrieved the apple without Miranda or McGonagall noticing. Of course, without magic, otherwise it would've been cheating. About 40 seconds after Sherlock sat down with the apple in hand, Mirandas egg cracked and exploded into something mildly resembling a chicken. Sherlock and John, of course, reacted completely calm and didn't laugh one bit.
"D'you have any plans? Like for later in your life. What you want to be?", he asked her. "Hmm, I'm pretty open towards anything life throws at me. I mean I really like quidditch. And I'm quite good at it. But I'm also interested in lots of other things. Breaking ancient curses seems cool.", she remarked.  "Definitely. I don't really know all that much about job opportunities in the wizarding world. I was thinking healer. But I'm not really sure." She nodded. "Still have time." "Or you could always apply as a houseelf", Mike joked. "By Merlin, that was one funny incident in second year and you keep bringing that up!" John turned red just from the thought of it. Mike was snorting with laughter now. Molly rolled her eyes. The others were confused. "So we were in the common room, right? And John here was really tiny. You know, he isn't tall now but back then he was basically a dwarf. And curious little John went exploring the nooks and corners of the common room to find any secret tunnels. And he stumbled upon a tunnel that once lead to the kitchens. But it was one of the really old ones. Not used anymore. So when he came back, he was full of dirt and dust. And one of the first years asked "Are you one of the house elfs, sir?" Now everyone at the table, including John was laughing. Even Sherlock was smirking. "Its not even that funny!", John sniffled. "Yeah it is!", Greg laughed.
At around six, Sherlock went back to his room to emerge fully dressed, a blue silk shirt paired with black suit trousers. He stepped into the living room and looked at John. John's eyes met his and he looked back down to his laptop. He'd been reading an article. Sherlick sighed impatiently. "You coming?" "Right." John put down the laptop and they grabbed their coats and left the house. "Where are we meeting him?" "Here." And really, Victor came walking down the street and stopped, showing his teeth in a smile again. "Hi!" Sherlock smiled too. Then he summoned a cab and the three squeezed in.
Christmas was fine. Sherlock was a bit bummed. Mycroft's presence and John's lack of presence worsened his otherwise fairly good mood. He was happy to see his mother. Christmas was tedious, sure. But he was able to tend to some of his experiments in his room, a tentaculus plant where he used bubotubler juice to water the plant, the felix felicis that had been brewing for about six months now and the collection of materials that had rapidly grown as Sherlock emptied his pockets.
Sherlock seemed to catalogue each way they went, a hopeless endeavor, judging by the way the maze changed. But soon they bumped into Fleur. They were still at the beginning then, she had only just entered. "Sherlock?", she asked confusedly. "Fleur, Moody n'est pas l'homme que tu pense qu'il est. Que nous pensions tout qu'il etait." "Quoi?" "Il a preparé des potions polyjuice." She had a frown on her face bit seemed to consider his words. "Et-tu sûr?", she asked. He nodded. "Absolument." She nodded too, convinced. "Viens avec nous, on va trouver les autres, je pense qu'il a hâte de faire quelque chose." She got her wand out and the three sped up, trying to find the others. That turned out to not be all that hard, when Cedric Diggory suddendly started screaming in pain. Fleur and John both hit Krum with a stunning charm. "He's been bewitched!", Sherlock exclaimed.
"Have you thought about what I said last night?", Victor asked John, when they followed Sherlock out of the flat. John nodded. "Come on, I have an idea where he might be!", Sherlock motioned for them to follow him. They did so, but not without Victor asking John: "And?" John shrugged. "I don't know. I mean you're right about me, but I don't think he..." "Trust me, he does", Victor interrupted. "Even if he did like me, how would I broach the subject?" "Just ask him to marry you, he'll say yes." John looked proper pissed now. "Ha ha ha." "But seriously, just make a move. Now come on, don't want to keep him waiting." And Victor started jogging after Sherlock. John rolled his eyes but did the same.
Once he was done, it was already dark outside. He had no idea how late it was. Probably after dinner though. So he turned in for the night. Laying in bed, he thought about John some more. But he didn't come to any conclusion so Sherlock went to sleep instead.
Soon enough, Sherlock went for another dance, leaving a very awkward John alone with his old (boy?)friend. Victor took the place Sherlock had just left. "You're in love with him, aren't you?", he asked John. John's jaw fell open. "Just... you seem to hate me whenever you're reminded of me posing a competition of sorts. Don't worry, though. I'm not taking him away from you." John gasped, scrambling for a defense. "I'm not trying to come between the two of you.", Victor repeated. "Sherlock and I are just friends.", John said lamely. "Yes, but you want more than that, don't you?" John was stunned.  "For being a genius, Sherlock is pretty stupid if he didn't see that yet", Victor joked. John was staring at his shoes. "I can see the way you look at him. And the way he looks at you." At that John looked up. "Sherlock isn't-" "Sure he is. You're perfect for each other, the two of you. Both entirely oblivious", Victor declared.
At lunch John sat alone at the Hufflepuff table. Well, there were other people but no Sherlock. By now John had realised what a dick he'd been to Sherlock earlier. Sherlock deserved better than that. Sherlock wasnt responsible for John's weird behaviour or confusion. He needed to apologize. Johns gaze drifted away from Molly in front of him and to the person sitting behind her, at the Ravenclaw table. Sherlock fucking Holmes.
"Specialis Revelio!", Sherlock interjected, jumping out of his hiding place.  And a bug next to Hermiones feet started growing at an alarming rate. Frizzy curls, red glasses and bright robes formed. Rita Skeeter stood there. She eyed Sherlock angrily, raising her wand. But John was faster. "Stupefy!", he shouted. And she was down. So Hermione immobilised her: "Petrificus Totalus!" They all stood around the frozen journalist. "We should probably take her up to Dumbledore", Harry remarked. Sherlock shrugged. "Mobilcorpus".
"I'm sorry, okay? I don't know what came over me. We don't have to... Well. I promise you nothing has to change. Maybe you could just delete tha-"
When Fleur got out early without her sister, Sherlock guessed that the Grindelohs took her down. Soon it was announced that he was correct. "The markings on her arm". was Sherlocks explanation. John was shivering now, no longer having his scarf, and Sherlock scooted closer until their shoulders, hips and thighs were touching sideways. That warmed John up for a slightly different reason,  but worked nonetheless.
Harry arrived there too and sunk to his knees to cradle Cedric in his arms. "Are you okay, I heard you scream!", he asked him worriedly. "I'm alright, I'm alright." Harry helped him up. The two Hogwarts champions stared at Sherlock expectantly as he explained his theory. "Viktor had been imperiused.", John added once once was done. "Yeah, he's going out with my best friend Hermione, I know him a bit. He would never do anything like this out of free will", Harry agreed. Krum was recovering from the two Stupefy spells. He stared up to five wands pointed at his face. "What?", he asked and blinked several times, now rubbing his head. "You've been imperiused. Do you know by whom?", John asked him. Viktor shook his head slowly. Cedric looked at him with distrust in his eyes. "You used the cruciatus on me." Krum's eyes widened. "Try remembering. What can you remember from before?" "I was in the maze. Not far in. Went right. Then a light." John nudged Sherlock into the side. "We entered on the right side of the maze. Someone must've followed us. They can't have gotten far." So all six of them tried retracing Viktor's steps. "You came from behind", Cedric remembered. So they went in that general direction and Viktor relied on his gut feeling and a sense of dejà-vu to retrace his steps.
And John woke up. It was early morning. Perhaps he wasn't as straight as he thought, having dreamt about kissing his best friend. He rolled out of his bed and massaged the bridge of his nose. This was going to be the end of him.
Dumbledore was an eccentric man. Just how eccentric Sherlock really only now realised. Having only seen him from far away, he'd never done any specific deductions on him. But as soon as Dumbledore stood in front of him, Sherlock's eyes scanned the headmaster. "Right-handed", "weakness in left knee, possible past injury" or "twitch in left eye" were pretty usual deductions but "leglimens", "gay" and "hopelessly trying out knitting", weren't what he was expecting. The longer he was in Dumbledores presence, the more he noticed.
They dined in an italian restaurant, Angelo's. The chef had a table ready for them right away. "Just this summer i did him a favour and saved him from a life sentence. He was convincted with urder charges, but Angelo was in a completely different part of town doing robberies." Angelo came up to the table now and asked for their orders. John ordered a Peperoni pizza while Sherlock wanted a lasagna. "Oh and ill get you a candle for you amd your date, it"s more romantic." Sherlock offered Angelo a smile while John offered him a strained "Not his date." Angelo didnt seem to have caught that and simply got a candle for the table anyways. John just nodded firmly and Sherlocks gaze dropped to his meal.
After having finished his curry, Victor strodded back to Bakerstreet to see how everything played out. He used his spare key to open the door and walked up the stairs. He entered through the kitchen to find Sherlock and John snogging in the living room. "My work here is done", Victor said to noone in particular.
" 'Morse Code too', yeah i know, i can do that myself." Now in a corridor, they turned towards the library. "Say something in German then" "Was soll ich denn sagen, John? Irgendwas bestimmtes oder soll ich einfach vor mich her labern?" John looked genuinely surprised. "Was, hast du mir nicht geglaubt?" "Sherlock, the language barrier", John reminded him. "Oh, desolée, tu ne compris pas?", Sherlock tried in French. John started laughing. "English, please!" "Pourquoi? C'est trop facile! " Now they were both laughing. "Okay stop it!" "Alright, alright!", Sherlock replied.
Meanwhile, Irene and her parents were catching up and Mycroft stuffed his face with food. In the evening, Mycroft told them about his ministry position. 'Them' being everyone but Sherlock, who didn't listen but instead walked around in his Mind Palace. "Sherlock, did you even listen?" "Eh, nope." Mycroft sighed. Irene patted Mycroft on the back. "I know how you feel. In a week I'll be left all alone with him again, enjoy the time you have." "What is there to enjoy?", Mycroft replied, tired of this. "Certainly not your never-ending anecdotes about the Minister.", Sherlock snapped back. Mycroft rolled his eyes. Their parents surpressed laughter and told all of them not to talk to each other like that. And tge rest of the evening was just a blur of biscuits, french chatter and John in his mind.
John let out an audible breath. "The boggart", John started. "We don't have to talk abou-" "No, I want you to know." Sherlock turned to look at him. "My father." "Chronic Alcoholic", Sherlock observed. "Christmas was..." John never finished that sentence but he didn't need to. "Next time come to my place." "I was at my sister's. It wasn't perfect but... I know she is trying and she's all I have left." "I'm sure you can bring her." "A muggle?" Sherlock shrugged. "I missed you at Christmas", Sherlock huffed. "Me too." "And I'm going to miss you this summer." Sherlock's hand squeezed John's. John didn't know what to say to that. Sherlocks hand loosened in his. It slipped up, a finger probing at his pulse point. "Move", Sherlock whispered. "What?" Sherlock sat upright in his bed and his legs came out from under the covers. He motioned John to move over. Which he did.
Sherlock sunk into the hospital bed. McGonagall hadn't even reprimanded them. Yet. He turned to John, whose bed was next to his. "Thank you for saving me." John let out a quiet laugh. "Thank you as well." Sherlock smiled. "On the graveyard..." He gulped. "I froze. I didn't know what to do. But you pulled me up. Your quick thinking saved me. And not to mention Harry and Cedric." "I was almost too slow." John had goosebumps just from remembering. "We made it. Thanks to you." Sherlock reached over the gap in between their beds and grasped John's hand.
I'm SORRY it took so long, I've been away for 87284 years!!! but don't worry the last chapter will arrive soon.
Later that day, the minister visited again to "sort this out". Fudge had left after the chaos of the third task, since there had been trouble in the ministry because of it. Cedric, Fleur and Viktor, being of age, threatened him to either accept the fact that Voldemort was back or to face a campaign of backlash from them, including but not limited to protests at the ministry, testification under veritaserum, showing their memories or generally interviews with any newspaper that would listen to their story. So Fudge gave in and announced that the Dark Lord was back the same evening.
John spent the rest of his winter break at Harry's. He borrowed her clothes, his bag at their parents house. He had fortunately not brought amy school equipment back home with him, just some clothes and the dogtags. John felt like these dogtags reminded him that his father had been a good man. He wore them with the image of a caring father in mind. It felt right to leave that behind.
"And you two...", John started, not sure where his sentence was going. "Old friends", they answered simultaneously. "We met at uni. Both pretty young for it. Used to do just about everything together. But we moved apart, quite literally since Sherlock didn't want to live in Paris." Sherlock hummed at that. "It was fun for a while. But London is better", was his remark on their story. "But we see each other every once in a while. Isn't that right, Willy?" Sherlock groaned while Victor cackled. "Christmas 09", they explained in sync, Victor amusedly and Sherlock in horror. "Your mother is such a blast", Victor snickered. "Were you still together back then?", John asked cautiously. "God no. We were never 'together' ", Sherlock answered. Victor nodded. "Too much work, too many feelings and whatnot. Relationships are complicated." "This", Victor said, while moving a finger in between him and Sherlock, "is easy." John nodded, not really understanding anything.
Downstairs, he found Sherlock drinking tea. "Made a cup for you as well." "What did you do?", John immediately asked. "What?" "You never make tea. Therefore something happened. Out with it, what happened?" But Sherlock only smiled and assured him: "I didn't do anything other than make tea." John raised an eyebrow in suspicion. "Is this drugged?" Sherlock shook his head, confused. Carefully he raised the cup to his lips. Sherlock was watching him with interest. John frowned at that and took a sip.
It has been twenty minutes since Harry, Cedric, Fleur and Victor went in and Sherlock's teeth were clapping together. So John took off his scarf and tied it around the neck of his confused friend. And noone was to know he scooted closer to Sherlock, sharing a bit of his body heat.
(S:"i bet i can steal the apple off of mirandas desk before she transforms her egg into a full-grown chicken"
He really needed to talk to John though, so he figured his friends would have to wait. "John" he tapped on his arm. John didn't look at him. "Hey, John! I think-" "Not now Sherlock", John brushed him off. "But John..." "Later.", John groaned. Now Sherlocks walls went up again. Without having eaten anything, he stood up and left. John looked at him leave before turning his attention back to Mike and Molly. "Anyways, where was I?" "Being really rude to your friend?", Molly accused him. She looked oddly disappointed and Mike, raised eyebrows and all, nodded. "That was pretty rude..." "I-" , John tried to defend himself. He honestly didnt know why he'd done that. He loved talking to Sherlock and actually would have wanted to hear what he was saying. But John reminded himself that Sherlock had Irene. The thought made him a little sick. He wasn't jealous. John was just...
Soon enough they hit an intersection. There were three possible routes and Viktor didn't know which way to go. So they seperated into groups of two. Fleur went with Viktor into the middle path and Harry and Cedric took the first one, leaving Sherlock and John for the third. After a while their path got slimmer and they heard something coming towards them. John was in front of Sherlock and froze when a strange man appeared. Sherlock was confused. The man dropped an empty bottle onto the ground "Come here Johnnyboy", he rasped. Sherlock could see the hairs on John's neck rising up. He had goosebumps. "You filfth. You shame us all. Now come here!", the man repeated. John winced and Sherlock pushed himself in front of him and didn't even wait for his fear to appear, he immediately yelled: "Riddikulus!" A powerful wave blast the boggart away. He turned around to see Johns terrified and teary-eyed face and embraced him tightly. "Well, well, well", a voice from behind them called out teasingly.
The restaurant was lovely. Cozy but not cramped. The owner seemed to know Victor and Sherlock, immediately waving them over to a two-person-table. Realising they were three people, he smoothly organised a third chair. The food was divine and the conversation was entertaining. Between the old friends, John felt a little left out, but Victor and Sherlock tried their best to include him into it. Meanwhile John did his best to hate Victor. But the man was charming and funny. And with the three of them sitting so casually together and laughing like they all knew each other, John could almost overlook their relationship. But in those moments where Victor nudged Sherlock in the side or shared a smile with him, John couldn't help but feel a glaringly hot anger rise up in his chest. John pretended not to know why he wanted to hate Victor. But deep down, he knew he was jealous.
They found both Sherlock's and Irene's mother in the salon. "Sherlock!", she exclaimed happily as she saw him. They both stood up from the Chaiselongue to hug their children respectively. "Oh Irene, comment était l'école?", Adina asked her daughter. "C'était assez bien.",Irene responded. And Sherlocks mother: "Oh, Sherlock, tu a encore grandi, n'est-ce pas?" "Peut-être un peu. Maman, arrête tellement de toucher mes cheveux!", Sherlock pouted, concerned for the wellbeing of his hair. She smiled at him. "Faible Sherlock, toujours inquiet pour ses cheveux.", Irene mocked him. Sherlock shot her an annoyed stare. Which soon turned into a death stare as another voice was heard. "Il avait toujours été trés dramatique.", Mycroft smiled. "How's the diet?" His brother grinned nastily. "Very well, thank you for asking." "Liar", Sherlock added under his breath. Mycroft must've heard him though, as he now drew in a sharp breath.
The next morning, in the Defense Against the Dark Arts class, Sherlock slipped John a note. "Alastor Moody, Ex-Auror. Responsible for Arresting about 60% of all deatheaters" It was crazy, John thought, how Sherlock just knew when to intervene and where to help. Sherlock surely noticed Johns lack of knowledge regarding famous wizards and it being accounted to Johns muggle home and upbringing. After John read the note, he eyed the Professor more attentively. Weirdly, Moody took a big gulp out of his flask right in the middle of class. But John forgot about it soon after.
The next morning John woke up early, half-convinced it was all a fever dream. He sat down in his chair and opened the newspaper Mrs Hudson had brought up. But then a strange man wearing Sherlock's robe and sweatpants came into the kitchen and rummaged through the drawers. "What shelf?", he yelled back into the general direction of Sherlock's room. John got up from his chair. "Can I help you?", he asked. The man in Sherlock's dressing gown flinched and jumped very abruptly. "God, you scared me. You must be the flatmate, John, right? Sherlock told me you guys were friends." The man smiled at him widely. "Victor." He offered his hand. John shook it, offering him a tight smile. "Now, can you tell me where the tea is? I fancy a cuppa." John opened the tea drawer. Victor took some teabags out.
yeah the reaction will be in the next chapter. BTW, the next one will go up until like the first task, so don't be mad if it takes a little longer.
When the smoke cleared, Jim was gone. They heard a 'zap'. "He can apparate.", John said, stating the obvious. "But where to?", Sherlock asked mostly himself, absentmindedly helping John up. "Maybe another corner of the labyrinth?", John suggested. "We would've heard a second sound." They were now walking back towards the place they'd last seen Jim. "This whole thing was planned, wasn't it?", John asked. Sherlock nodded. "Maybe there's another location." "The cup is a portkey!", Sherlock finished. "Cedric and Harry are in danger!", John added. "We have to find them!" They were running through the maze now, passing Fleurs and Viktor's lifeless bodies on the ground. John sent up red sparks and they continued, running into a pathway illuminated by blue light. The portkey was right in the middle and around it were Harry and Cedric, both reaching for the cup just as Sherlock shouted "No!" and then "Accio!". The cup was starting to spin and yanked the two boys holding it right towards Sherlock and John, who grabbed onto it as well.
John sat down and thought about Sherlock. He was seeing him in a whole new light. "Ahem", he heard from before him. He was so focused he didnt realise someone approaching. It was the very boy that John was thinking about. "Fancy a dance?" He just took the hand and let himself be led onto the dancefloor.
John's face was turning a colour deeper than the cherry juice Molly, right next to him, was drinking. "Are you alright, mate?",Mike asked him. "Have you swallowed something you didn't mean to?, Molly wondered. John shook his head and assured them he was fine. But he was deeply embarrassed. The boy caught him staring. He wasn't staring per se, he wasn't gay or anything. Maybe John actually looked at the pretty girl next to him, raven black hair in an elegant bun and deep red lips- no. Back to the full lips with a wonderful cupids bow, now smirking. Yeah, he was looking at him. Their eyes met and John was looking right into what seemed to be an ocean. The hufflepuff quickly looked back down onto his meal. Maybe later John would try to explain everything to him and turn the situation into something less embarrassing, he was good with words, having written several pieces for a smaller newspaper called 'The Strand'. For the rest of the dinner he listened along to the heated conversation Molly and Mike were having with only one ear. Afterwards he could hardly recall it, Something about the healing paste the two were experimenting on. John tried to push the curly-haired french boy out of his mind and instead focused on the phone Harry had given him. She wanted to stay in touch and gave it to him. John did end up bringing it with him after casting several protection spells on it. Magic and technology didn't work out well.
And Sherlock turned out to be correct. A few days later, him and John sat in the Arena, Molly and Mike next to them. Sherlock found them to be less irritating than most people even though Molly seemed to have a crush on him. Mike was quite alright. His girlfriend Stella was an excellent beater and had shown him the proper way to handle his bat a few days prior. Cedric, Fleur, Victor and Harry did the job. Not necessarily in the most effortless way, but they managed. Cedric's transfiguration was good in theory but not perfect in execution. Fleur's sleeping spell was passable at best. It was probably the nerves, back in Beauxbatons he'd seen her cast much better ones. Sherlock almost facepalmed when Krum cast a blindness spell. Over a week of preparation and this was the best he could come up with? Harry's performance was clever, although he was sure he didn't come up with it himself. John was cheering for all of them, concerned about the injuries and positively glowing in the light of the fire. Sherlock couldn't help but sigh. "That boring?" John laughed. Sherlock shrugged. Johns attentions turned back to the field and Sherlock tried his best to shield his facial expression from him, as he was beginning to blush furiously. Oh damn, this was already getting hard to hide.
On the train back home the Monday after, Sherlock and John were holding hands. Their compartment was full of their friends, who brightened the soury, bad mood caused by Voldemort up with lots of sweets and magical games like Exploding Snap. Sherlock and John played a few rounds but mostly sat back, leaning into their seats and each other, enjoying the last bit of each others company before the summer break separation. When the train arrived at the station, John asked:"You'll write, won't you?" Sherlock nodded. "We have to visit each other. I don't think I can take the entire summer without you." "Neither do I." Greg made fake vomiting noises in the background, at which Cho laughed. "They're just romantic!", Molly sighed and then yelped as Stella elbowed her. Mike laughed at that. "I just know he's going to be unbearable during the summer!", Irene exclaimed and everyone apart from Sherlock laughed at that.
The next morning was a Sunday. John was seated at the Hufflepuff table and enjoying a Full English Breakfast when Sherlock joined him. "Suspects for putting Harry's name in.", he began. John turned to face him. Sherlock was wearing a light blue button-up that was straining slightly at the top buttons. John tried to focuse on his face but that was not helpful. Instead he listened to what he had to say.  "I believe the goblet was tricked into thinking there are four schools instead of three and Harry Potters name got entered as the only participant for the last school. To confuse a magical object this powerful you would need advanced magical knowledge, especially in the dark arts and, obviously, be over 17 in order to actually cross the age line that Dumbledore has drawn." That made John think. "So it could've only been the Durmstramg and Beauxbatons students, 7th and some of the 6th years, staff and organisers." Then John looked at Sherlock. "Oh, perhaps I should mention, it isn't me.", Sherlock said flatly. "I didn't assume that", John defended himself. Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "I know fairly much about the case, most people would at least-" "Well, I'm not most people." That must've caught Sherlock off guard, since he didnt respond immediately. "Are you even 17?" "Turning 16 in January, actually" "Well then we're both off the list.", John explained. "Ill be joining you in classes, we can look through the staff and you can help me observe the suspected students." John smiled. "I didn't know you guys were gonna join us in classes." "What else did you think we'd do all year?" John shrugged. "Haven't really thought about it." John now realised that Sherlock hadn't eaten anything. He pointed to one of his sausages. "Try them, theyre really good." "No thank you" John loaded one onto Sherlocks plate anyways. "So, what do you want to do today?" "I think I'd like to go around the castle again. Starting with the Owlery, my brother expects a letter from me." John nodded. "Fine, we can do that, good idea." Sherlock stood up. John added "After we've eaten." Sherlock contemplated. He could go alone without eating or eat a sausage and have John's company. Reluctantly he demolished the stupid sausage and took a swig of water from his goblet. John stood up and he lead the way.
"How do you like it?" 'What?', John angrily thought. 'That you shagged my best mate? That you're wearing his dressing gown? That you're where I usually am, making tea? That you're with him and I...' "A little milk", John replied. Victor nodded and put the kettle on. John went back to his chair and flopped down, staring at the newspaper in ire. His eyes burnt holes into the article about the starshower of the century. "So when did you meet Sherlock?", Victor asked cheerfully. "Over a year ago." "He deduced everything about you right away didn't he?", Victor continued. "Yes", John curtly said. "Ah, I still remember when he first met me, it was such good fun." Victor seemed to reminisce about old times. "And have you met his brother yet?" "Sadly, yes", John scoffed. "Good ol' Mike. A nightmare isn't he?" John didn't reply. "Used to surveill me i think. Probably still does." Victor set the cup of tea down next to John on the small table and went on to sit down in Sherlocks chair. He curled up inside it and blew on his tea. John looked at Victor.
"Join you to what?" "Dinner. Victor is in town for a while and this morning we discussed to meet later." John nodded. "I'm not sure I should impose-" "Nonsense! Victor wants you there. Besides, I'm sure you're both eager to get to know each other", Sherlock cut him off. And that was that. Sherlock spent the rest of the morning in his mind palace while John feigned reading while actually thinking about Victor and Sherlock. What was their relationship like? Their friendship? They seemed incredibly close. And obviously intimate in more than one way. Sherlock had told him he wasn't looking for anything, that he was married to his work. John had understood that as a general disinterest in sex or relationships. But apparently that disinterest had an exception. Or perhaps he was just not interested in John.
"John", he let out, not sure how to articulate the thousands of thoughts filling his head. John was cheering for Krum and didn't directly look at Sherlock. "What is it?", he asked half-heartedly in between cheers. "John!", Sherlock repeated. Now John spared him a glance. "Sherlock?" But Sherlock just grabbed John's hand and pulled him up and away from their seats. John protested and tried to stay back but Sherlock insisted. "What are you doing? Why-" "Ssshhh!" John finally followed him, having understood the message Sherlock's sharp tone tried to send. When they had escalated the staircase, Sherlock ducked under one of the stands. "Sherlock what are we-" "Moody!", Sherlock just whispered and glanced at the Professor from underneath the seats. "I can't believe I've missed it all year." John asked, much louder than Sherlock: "What about him?" And Sherlock pressed a hand to Johns mouth as means to shut him up but there was already rumbling above them, someone had heard them. So Sherlock pulled at John's hand again, which he hadn't let go and the two escaped. In their hurry, they didn't notice Molly Hooper call after her boyfriend, who abruptly left his seat.
They got back very early in the morning. Sherlock wasn't very tired but John insisted that he'd also take a sip of the wideye potion Sherlock had given him. Aside from the glee and pride the two felt, the next day was like any other. They went to classes together and exchanged notes in class .
"Sorry about that", John said quietly. "Hm? Oh no it's fine. He's very interesting. And i have my own kettle and ingredients with me. I plan to experiment on acids today." John smiled at him so warmly, some  of the warmth settled in Sherlocks stomach. "Can I assist you?" And Sherlock just couldn't say no to that, could he?
Sherlock had come to terms with his atraction to John. It was fascinating to be honest. If John touched his arm, his arm tingled afterwards. If John whispered in his ear, Sherlock blushed. And if John smiled, Sherlocks heartrate increased significantly. Things like that were usually the kind of things he deduced on other people but experiencing it all himself was... different. With his feelings for John, his "John room" had grown too. He now stored mental images of John, his facial expressions, mostly smiles, his clothes, eyes, smell, the way that he talked, the things he talked about and the things he made him feel in it. He liked spending time in that room. But he liked spending time with John in the present even more. Like right now. Sherlock snapped out of his thoughts and into reality again. They were playing quidditch. Sherlock as chaser. He hit the ball into the ring. John couldnt catch it. "You ARE good at this.", John called out. "Why thank you!" Sherlock replied sarcastically and quickly dodged a bludger. It flew into the general direction of Harry and Cedric who were chatting whilst the snitch reamined unseen. They dodged as well and the bludger got back to Gavin. John had introduced him earlier. Sherlock deduced he wanted to be an auror and was a halfblood. The game was pretty fast since the snitch was caught soon enough. Harry caught it and Cedric was congratulating him on it. They would have to face the first task soon enough. Sherlock already knew it was dragons and was sure they knew too. Harry, chivalrous, brave and magnanimous as he was, probably told Cedric.
Sherlock's lips were unbelievably soft. His nose fit perfectly against John's and his hands were roaming over John's chest and arms and head, exploring everything. John figured he was cataloguing it all so he let him. John's fingers only carded through Sherlock's curls, twisting and twirling the luscious locks around. Sherlock seemed to enjoy that a lot, humming enthusiastically. But eventually they had to breathe so they broke apart. John laughed out in pure joy and Sherlock joined in, giggling away. There was a rumbling heard from Madam Pomfreys office, so Sherlock quickly climbed back into his own bed.
John soon found out that Sherlock was an excellent wizard. His skills in transfigurations, whether it was because of the Beauxbatons raising or just personal interest exceeded that of the Hufflepuffs and Slytherins. He managed the task set out by McGonagall easily and spent the remainder of the time expected for it with figuring out her animagus appearance. When John managed the task too, Sherlock asked: "A cat, isn't it?" "What is?" "Her Animagus." John nodded, not nearly as surprised as he would have been a few days ago if someone just figured an animagus out by simply looking at someone. "Extraordinary.", John breathed. "Do you notice you're doing that out loud?", Sherlock asked him in wonder. "Sorry" John was ashamed. Sherlock tried to remedy that. "No, it's... fine. Just wanted to know." They locked eyes. John looked away quickly. Sherlock hid a smirk. McGonagall, a few feet away from them shook her head. This was going to be a long, long year.
At some point John had joined him the couch. After he'd calmed down they were able to fall back into their usual easy conversation again. John was just glad that the exams were over and enjoyed spending time with Sherlock that wasn't spent studying. "Are you excited for the summer?", Sherlock asked him. "Hmm, I haven't really thought about it. I'll probably go to my sister. I'm not going back to my parents." John had told Sherlock about what had happened o Christmas a few months ago so Sherlock nodded in understanding. "You could visit me." "What, at Holmes manor? With French family and Irene?" Sherlock laughed but then looked at him in earnest. "Yeah." And John's heart just about exploded again. "Hmh. Sure." Sherlock then started talking about his house and all the things they could do during the summertime. "I could teach you horseriding. Or we could go swimming. Maybe row in a river nearby. You probably haven't done any of these, growing up in a city. It's so different out there on the countryside. More peaceful. More beautiful. At some point I'll retire there. Maybe have a few bees." John laughed. "And get married to a beekeeper?" "Who knows. I'll be a beekeeper. I don't know about marriage yet." "Fair enough", John huffed. "We could move in together. After school I mean. Not necessarily on the countryside." When John didn't answer, he immediately added "Just an idea." "I won't even see you next year." He sounded small and sad. "Of course you will." John looked confused. "I'm transferring to Hogwarts. So is Irene. You're no getting rid of me that easily." And at that moment John swore he could kiss him. But he pulled himself together and smiled instead. They left late that night, both retiring to their respective dorms.
The next morning was the morning of the third task. Sherlock found John at breakfast. It was weird. After last night it felt as if there was a new undercurrent in their friendship. But he shrugged it off and sat down to let himself be persuaded to eat a croissant. Everyone was buzzing with anticipation. The third and final task. The entire school rushed down to the arena. "A maze." Sherlock nodded. Soon the champions arrived and Bagman declared Harry and Cedric to be the current leading party, therefore being granted a headstart. The two smiled at each other and let go of the others hands to go into two separate tunnels. Moody closed the tunnel behind Harry. Sherlock tried to focus on Krum, about to follow the two Hogwarts champions. But he couldn't take his eyes off of Moody. "Always have been the slow little brother", Mycroft sneered in his head. He had been missing something monumental, having been caught up in other cases, school and his feelings for John. And then it clicked.
Sherlock was bored. Apparently John didnt want anything to do with him anymore. He thought about going to the room in his mind Palace again to perhaps demolish it since nothing would ever become out of it. But somehow he couldn't bring himself to it. Instead he shifted his attention on simething else. Like Irene's extremely obvious flirting attempts Cho didnt seem to quite catch on. Or like right now, reduced to a blushing mess, react quite intensely to. Irene literally winked at Cho. Who giggled in turn. Not totally dull. But not John. A propos John... He was standing right next to him. Sherlock snapped out of his thoughts.
Sherlock felt like he was walking on eggshells. Not in a literal sense of course. Just around John. After they've returned from the case in London he'd been thinking about the nature of their relationship and, as unusual as it was, he did not come to any conclusion whatsoever. While Sherlock was sure he had feelings for John, he could not imagine what John was feeling for him. And he was figuring it out at a snail's pace. In the areas he would usually feel most confident in his deduction, he failed with John. At first Sherlock thought his abilities were fading. But everyone else's attractions were clear to him, he immediately knew who was dating, who wanted to be dating who, where jealousy reeked and where only mutual disgust laid. But with John he didn't have a clue.
After a long explanation from Sherlock on the different patterns on stones that indicated said mermaid population, John was happy to see Irene and Cho, practically conjoined twins at this point, coming over. "Hey, i wanted to ask if you guys wanted to come over, Greg asked if we were up for Quidditch. And Cedric just asked Harry so i bet it'll be fun.", Cho said. "Oh and Sherlock, you simply must join us." Sherlock looked up from his watergrass-and-stones collection. "Eh, no." Irene crossed her arms. "Last summer you said you would play if there were more people!" "Irene, i only wanted to test how much the broom could take." "Yes and all that training made you an excellent flyer. Youre coming." She then waved goodbye to John, hooked her arm into Cho's and left. "I dont even know the rules", Sherlock screamed after her. "Youre a fast learner, I'm sure you'll catch up!", Irene yelled back. Sherlock sighed. John on the other hand was amused.
