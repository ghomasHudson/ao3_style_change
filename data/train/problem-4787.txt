Steve tried his best not shudder. As scared as he was (he had zero fighting experience. Could he even throw a punch?), his rage was stronger. Knowing what Howard had done to Tony filled him with a burning hatred.
Steve stood with Bucky’s arm around him. Tony was on the floor, his breathing still heavy and his face bloodier than Steve liked to see. It hurt more knowing that he did it.
Steve was in the middle of reading a book about mermaids and their natural habitat when the Porthaven door opened with a bang. He jumped up, clutching his shield in his hand, but it was only Tony. Tony, who was dishevelled, out of breath, and paler than Steve had ever seen him.
He didn’t know what to do with that piece of information. Should he be glad she knew, or should he be anxious that she would be concerned about him? Should he try to contact her? He hadn’t talked to her in months, his previous plans to send her a letter when he arrived at Ma’Hattan completely forgotten when he met Tony and Jarvis. Thank God James had told her, she would be worried sick otherwise, with Steve disappearing off the map, without a word to his sister.
He wouldn’t get that answer anytime soon, he knew. Just like the reason for Tony’s visit to O’Casta. Maybe Tony was trying to figure out a way to fight the curse, and O’Casta could help him, since she had the second half of the poem? Steve was almost sure that there was a connection between O’Casta and the curse. She seemed to know about the author, and the poem, so maybe she had insight that Tony lacked.
Steve’s voice is dangerous, and it promises a world of pain and regrets. Tony wants to laugh at that, that Steve thinks he has any kind of control of this situation, when it’s so far out of his hands.
Who could he turn to? He didn’t have the money needed to ask for a magic user’s services, but he didn’t have a choice. Maybe he could work for them, as an assistant or cleaner until he scraped together enough money to pay them? Didn’t the Great Magician Potts accept alternative methods of payment? He was one of the strongest magic users, too, on the same level as the Sorcerer Supreme. Yes. Steve would go to Potts.
Oh, yes, Steve seems to be Hydra, as well. It's not something Tony saw coming. Then again, Tony himself is the opposite of what he was.
“It never hurts to try, Tony. You’ll be in complete control. Nothing can go wrong. You know me. I wouldn’t put you in danger like that.”
Steve wondered what he’d thought if Tony had looked like this for their first meeting. He would have run away in horror, he knew. Steve was glad he could see the man underneath the masks and lies, that he knew his appearance didn’t mean much. Tony was gorgeous, even like this, because in the end, what counted was where his heart lay. And Steve knew Tony was a good man with a heart of gold.
Steve never talks to him, never gets near enough for Tony to see his eyes. He doesn’t really know what to think of it, so he peers down the bottle instead. When he’s drunk half of it, there’s always this fleeting moment of euphoria, where everything will take a golden haze, where nothing will hurt, where he forgets what he’s doing and why.
Steve stood up, panting heavily, his chest metaphorically on fire, and watched as her flames died, as her frame melted into the ground, until all that was left of her were the two halves of Janet’s heart.
There is the matter of him being young again, too. Tony can't say he misses the sagging skin and teary eyes of the Steve from his time.
Steve wanted to believe that it was because Tony’s mansion was in that place, but he knew it was more likely because miss O’Casta was there, and Tony didn’t want to cut the connection to her. It still rankled, but now that Steve was sure that Tony wasn’t really courting her, it didn’t rankle as much anymore.
Tony doesn’t let himself smell or taste them, but he allows himself to look. He lets himself imagine what it would taste like, still warm, sticky and liquid, coating his lips and sliding down his throat. The coppery smell would be everywhere. He would gag on it, the smell, and still stick his nose in the blood, inhale everything.
He had to believe in it. He was fighting the good fight, because even if he was going to lie about Stark, it was for a good cause. Stark needed time to break his own curse. Him dying would make the world a worse place to live in.
Steve punches him, and Black Widow doesn’t move, but Thor puts a hand on Steve’s shoulder, tells him to calm himself down, that he won’t attack Stark without reason. Steve snarls at that, and why shouldn’t he? He remembers, he knows how hopeless the situation is, he knows that Tony lied to him, and after everything they’ve been through, they might not make it out of this. How many times has Tony betrayed Steve already?
There’s a kind of vague disinterest in Steve’s eyes. “Since the first time I died, huh. Makes sense.”
Steve wanted to think it was more plausible that it wasn’t something physical, because he couldn’t really imagine that a fire demon would have any use of money or goods or food. A demon didn’t need earthly things, that was common knowledge.
“How many times has it been, Steve? How many times have we had this conversation?” Because he doesn’t even know that, does he? Only knows that Steve knows more than he does because Steve
Was the contract with Jarvis making him especially vulnerable to the curse? Had the Witch of the Waste been cursed in a similar fashion? What had happened to her fire demon? Miss Potts had said that the fire demon had led her to her destruction, but what had the fire demon gained from that?
Steve had agreed to Stark’s plan, but now that he was face to the King, he just wanted to bow deep and confess about the plan. He suspected the King’s eyes had that effect on anyone.
He gets as far as the hallway, where he collides with Steve and sends them both sprawling to the ground. There’s a wet crunch as Steve’s head gets crushed between Tony’s chestplate and the floor. The panic doesn’t have time to set in properly before the orange glow envelops them.
A small smile crept onto Steve’s lips because Tony kept the phone. They hadn’t used it in two years, but they had it. It was the only connection they still had. Steve found the weight of it in his pocket less heavy.
Tony stood there frozen in his spot as Steve poured the already brewed coffee into the mug and walked away, his loud yawn echoing in the hallway.
“Come home. I promise to be better. I promise to help. I promise to never make you leave me again. Just please, please come home.” Scalding hot tears were streaming down Tony’s face now. There was a list of issues Tony planned to fix that he had created over the last two years. He wanted to show Steve that was he was worthy.
“Hey Tony,” Steve says with a soft, dazed smile. He reached up (showing off his arms which looked fantastic obviously) and grabbed the mug. The Iron Man mug.
He slammed the mug on the table (which spilt coffee all over that DUM-E would inevitably have to clean) and grabbed at Steve. He latched onto Steve’s sweaty shirt and placed a hot, searing kiss on Steve’s lips. Steve groaned and settled his hands on Tony’s hips gently but firmly. The kiss was passionate, hot and heavy. A culmination of all the pent-up tension which had been bubbling for months. Tony could barely contain his moans as Steve licked into his mouth. His hands were travelling everywhere, he wanted to burn the outline of every inch of his body in his mind.
He had owned that mug for years (it was beginning to fade, but he would just have JARVIS mend it) and nobody else had used it (except for Clint, but that was a mistake he would never make again. Note: do not play pranks on Mr. Tony Stark involving that mug).
No matter what happened next, he hoped he wouldn’t forget that. He would rather wallow in his loneliness forever, feeling only his aching pain than knowing that he caused this upon another.
“Rogers.” He always spoke so sternly. A permanent frown etched onto his face. His gaze narrowed disapprovingly at Steve’s appearance—paint-stained shorts, a tattered shirt and sweat glistening on his forehead.
“Leave, now.” Steve flinched when Howard’s calloused hands wrapped themselves around his wrist in a bone-crushing grip. Steve looked down, only for a second, at his hands but he saw it.
Seeing him brought back a myriad of emotions Tony wished were buried. Everything in his mind screamed Steve. He could hardly believe he had gone so long without tasting that name on his lips.
They were closer now. The last time they were this close, they were clawing at each other. Each word they said bridged the gap between them. Communication had never been their strength, but it was clearly becoming their saving grace. Tony disengaged the armour and stepped out of it. He played with his fingers and dug at his nails, a clear sign of nervousness. Steve understood the vulnerability of it. He was essentially defenseless and he was putting his life in Steve’s hands again. It was an olive branch if there ever was one.
Tony wanted to love him. Hell, he probably already does. But the hard part was handing over his heart to Steve. His battered and bruised heart was quite literally protected by armour.
It took five minutes to get him to take her to his bedroom. Less than a minute for him to strip off his clothes as per her instruction.
Steve would leave in his rumpled clothes in the early hours of the morning. He would flinch as he put on his shirt, knowing that the scratches would leave a mark.
Tony always made Steve notify him if he planned on coming over. It was a precaution Steve didn’t always understand, but he always respected it.
The fear that he saw in those beautiful eyes would haunt him until he died. He wanted Tony to trust him, and now he had lost everything.
But Manhattan was nothing like he imagined. It was worse. The people were evil. He went into a war to save society, but they had somehow managed to ruin themselves while he was in the ice.
He wanted to tear himself apart into small enough pieces that he could never be put together again. Was there even anything to break anymore? He wanted to burn his tongue until he couldn’t speak another word. He always messed things up that way. He spoke without thinking. His mouth would try and catch up with his brain, unintentionally moving too fast for him to consider the consequences.
Pepper was the person who gave him the “I Am Iron Man”. It was custom made and appeared on his workstation the day after the press conference.
Put him in a fight and he would become the embodiment of courage and confidence. He could assign duties in a battle with ease even with his constant self-doubt. It was exhausting to lead a team because he was endlessly worrying about them and making the wrong decisions which could end up with them being hurt in the end. But at the same time, he still gave his orders with conviction. It was a skill that seemed to only benefit him in the field.
He hit the floor with a loud thud. Nobody was there to hear it. He scratched his face as pushed his hair out of his face. His tongue was motionless, he couldn’t cry out for him.
The scarecrow pushed, and Steve pushed back, but he changed strategy when it became clear that they were evenly matched. He tipped the shield up, catching the underside of the scarecrow’s head with the shields’ rim, sending him flying back with the uppercut. Steve watched in satisfaction as the scarecrow tumbled in the grass, disappearing down the hill.
Steve was breathing hard, but he took the time to inspect the shield for any scrapes or dents. There were none, and he felt oddly proud. Using the rim had been an excellent idea, if he said so himself. He traced it with his finger. It was sharp enough that it could cut if enough force were applied. The shield was more than a mere defensive tool, Steve realised. Tony, by making it light and solid, had ensured that Steve could use it on the offensive too. He could deal blows, use it as a blunt weapon. He would have done quite the damage, had he been in his old body. With this body, it was less considerable, but not inconsequential.
He smiled the fakest smile he’d ever smiled. He wasn’t even trying to be polite, he just wanted her gone. She’d been acting weird when they had come to her house, refusing to give Tony the piece of paper with the spell, and now she was being oddly insistent about staying in the castle. He didn’t trust her.
But he wasn’t afraid. It was there, the fear, muted behind this wall of indifference, but Steve couldn’t really feel it. He couldn’t feel anything. Anything but the cold. It was…not nice. But it was, and he was in there. He was.
He wanted to ask Stark, but that would only arouse unwanted questions from the wizard. Maybe Jarvis knew. Speaking of, he needed to get out of Shield grounds as soon as possible. Lord Fury wasn’t malicious, but Steve would feel safer with the armour at his back. He put the pieces back into the cloth and walked the rest of the way to the front gate, where he thanked Lord Fury for his time and promised to come back to see Natasha.
This isn’t anything different. The wolf can be a lamb’s best friend. Steve and Tony’s friendship is all the more piquant because there might be a lion hiding underneath the sheep’s wool. Tony won’t know until it’s too late to disengage.
Tony’s words hit too close to home. Steve couldn’t deny that he would have been so angry at Tony. He would have seen it as unwanted pity, or even worse, as an attempt to gain his favours back after his failed attempt at courting. With the low opinion he had had of Tony at the time, he might even have thought that Tony was trying to use Steve’s gratitude for being given a place to stay to make him sleep with him.
“Stark has entered our domain. I suspect he doesn’t know of your presence, and that the armour was using his magic? Which would explain why it deactivated.”
And he’d said that Tony knew about Steve’s curse. Added with the fact that Tony had been looking for him, there were a lot of things Tony hadn’t said to him. Why had Tony been looking for him, why hadn’t he mentioned it to Steve, and why hadn’t he told him that he knew about the curse? Steve felt stupid, now, stupid that he hadn’t thought of that. All the other magic users he’d encountered had known about his curse right from the start, and Steve had never thought to question why Tony was acting as if he didn’t know about it.
Howard’s footsteps were impossible to ignore. Steve’s breath lodged in his throat in trepidation and Tony’s grip tightened. Howard didn’t bother knocking. As soon as he entered, his presence seemed to fill every inch of the room. He was imposing. It was suffocating. Tony’s room was large but it was impossible to see or feel anything other than pure Howard (narcissism, cruelty, and manipulation which all seemed to be emitted from his cologne, perhaps it was natural). Steve wondered if his presence had always been this intrusive or whether the malicious glint in his eyes was the reason. Any other day Steve would be riddled with fear, but he still had Tony’s bloody hand in his.
Tony’s heart was thumping so loud that he could hardly hear the music he blasted in his helmet. He was torn between apprehension and eager anticipation. What if it wasn’t for him after all? Maybe Tony had become so self-obsessed in his grief that he imagined the entire ordeal. But what if he wanted Tony back? Tony was ashamed to admit he would succumb to his desires in seconds.
Then they were called in more (which meant they complained more about Nick’s complete disregard for their rest). They began to bond more (by order of their Captain) and the team seemed to click. That’s when movie and game nights started. They started to lean on each other more. For a group of people with ingrained trust issues, they forgot about that really quickly. It turned out being with people who shared similar life experiences really did solidify relationships. In fact, it made them into some sort of family.
Tony was nothing more than an armour and a wallet. He couldn’t make decisions. He couldn’t decide what was best for the team. All he did was make the people whom he cared for
Tony did care. He cared far too much and that was the crux of the problem. Steve had abandoned him two years ago taking Tony’s broken and battered heart, leaving Tony cold and empty to die in his scratched and scattered armour. It was not his fault. He had the right to hate him, and he truly did.
Most often, though Tony loathed to admit it, Tony hated him because he was left behind. Didn’t he know that Steve would have followed him to the ends of the earth?
Tony was caught completely off guard during their next encounter. Steve and Tony were supposed to go and see
Howard swung again, seething with rage. He missed. Steve felt as though he lost control of his own body. An out-of-body experience. He was not even sure if he could have stopped himself if he wanted to at that moment. He was merely an observer of his own body as he struck Howard down with a strength he never knew he possessed. Howard landed on the ground with a thud, clearly shocked by Steve acting out on his threats and it not being a bluff. Steve instantly got on top of Howard, trapping him underneath him. Completely at his mercy.
He wished they would all just understand. He didn’t mean to cause a fight. He didn’t mean to try and kill Bucky (okay, maybe he did in the moment, but hey! He killed his parents. Brutally. It was an honest reaction). He didn’t mean to make Steve leave the shield. He didn’t mean to tear the Avengers apart. Why wouldn’t they just see that everything he ever did was in the team’s best interest? Why couldn’t they understand that this was the way he had always been? The only way he knew how to show how much he cared was by screwing up.
He stands up and grins at Tony innocently. He is a white tank top, but he may as well be shirtless with the sweat on his shirt and glistening on his arms which only made the shirt appear tighter which Tony didn’t think he was possible. He wiped his slightly grimy face with a cloth and tucked it into his back pocket. There was still grease on his hands and arms, but he didn’t seem to care. Tony couldn’t stop caring. Seeing Steve like this was a completely new territory that he didn’t think he could handle. Steve may be the hottest mechanic he has ever seen. Tony just wanted to feel him. He wanted to know how it felt to have that hard body pressed tightly against his, taking complete control.
Steve broke apart first and Tony may or may not have whined. Steve didn’t move far, their noses were still brushing and their breaths were mingling in the air between them as they panted. Steve stroked Tony’s face with feather-light touches and pressed a soft kiss to his lips.
“Sweetheart you are perfect. There is absolutely nothing for you to change. We both made mistakes and we will work on them
Tony couldn’t resist. He saw Steve and was reminded of every other time they had been in either of their beds, tangled up and sweaty. Steve hurt him. But Tony let him run his hands all over his body and he reveled in the burn he felt.
but when it began to look like a bender, Steve dragged him upstairs to sleep and to socialise. It was torturous and Tony loved it. Steve also spent a few hours of his day (sometimes most of it) in the workshop with Tony. He would sit on a couch, close enough to feel his presence but far away enough to not be an obstruction and sketch. It was what made Tony fall in love with him.
He knew better than to let him into his house. When he asked, Tony should have said no. Should have told him that Sharon deserved better.
On top of all of that, he especially looked after Tony. Maybe it was to make up for their fight on the helicarrier, maybe he truly pitied Tony or maybe (and Tony always hated to go here, it was dangerous) he genuinely liked and cared for him. It scared the hell out of Tony. Steve would come down and regularly bring him meals and
After the Pepper break-up, he seemed to retreat into his shell once more. He hid in his workshop all day to try and distract himself from the pain. The team thought they would be doing him a favour by getting rid of the mug, but his explosive reaction induced a sliver of fear in them that they had never felt before.
a little insecure tony, but it all works out in the end. basically tony loving steve but being damaged.
It quickly became his special mug and he treasured it. Even DUM-E knew that that was the mug to bring to him whenever he wanted coffee. Rhodey and Pepper said that they regretted ever giving it to him since it stroked his ego even more and it was only a matter of time before his head no longer fit in his helmet.
He hated himself. He had promised Tony to always be there. To love him forever. But Steve had gotten ahead of himself. He was stuck in the past. He was still holding on and that had cost him the best thing in his life.
“I know he’s here.” It wasn’t supposed to be intimidating. Steve wasn’t intimidating. He was muscular and tall, but Tony always went on about what a softie he was. Howard’s glare somehow managed to intensify but Steve’s grip on the door only strengthened, despite the chills running down his spine.
Steve impulsively asked him out on a date after watching him gulp down three cups of coffee in as many minutes and shove a doughnut in his mouth leaving his face an icing-covered mess. It was adorable and Steve instantly wanted to know everything about him. Tony was hyper and he was rambling on about a project he was working on and Steve just asked him. Tony grinned and said yes, he was very quick to say it and it made Steve’s heart skip a few beats.
Hearing Tony plead and degrade himself like that broke Steve’s heart. He pressed another kiss to the calloused hands he still held and stared straight at Tony.
Tony tipped back a glass of water when he noticed Steve strolling into the kitchen, rubbing his eyes with a soft yawn. Tony blanched and his mouth instantly when dry. Standing before him was a man who looked like he had been carved out of marble. Tony could see almost every inch of his tantalising body. The little that was covered was done so in a pair of
Their sleepovers made Tony realise how much he missed his best friend and how much he missed having somebody like that to talk to. There was something about the way that Rhodey just
And it took her mere seconds to kill him, she enjoyed every single moment of it. In the end, she examines her masterpiece and smiles.
Although, Steve supposes she came to him. Apparently she was considering gouging her eyes out because seeing him so hopelessly pining physically tortured her. But Natasha’s plan took him out of his comfort zone, but she insisted that it would entice him (more than entice him if he was lucky).
Sometimes he hated him because he had lied. He had lied while he fucked him into their bed, breathing heavily on his back, hands clasped together as he murmured Tony’s name like a mantra. He had lied while he cradled Tony’s shuddering body as nightmares continued to plague him. He lied when he promised to love Tony truly, madly and deeply for the rest of their lives.
Whatever it was, this indescribable feeling, Tony knew it was good. And that was all that really mattered.
He knew he should have kept his mouth shut about the Accords. He knew he should have left Steve make the decisions. It was what he was there for.
She swayed her hips as she strode toward him. The reaction was unsurprising. His jaw fell to the floor before his lips formed a smirk. His hands reached out to grasp her waist.
This Avengers compound was all he wanted. All he ever wanted was a family to love and accept him for all his faults. And for some time it seemed like Steve and the Avengers could provide that.
The eyes that seemed to go from besotted to condescending in seconds that Tony was sure he would have missed it if he blinked.
This was the third time Steve had broken into the compound undetected since the Avengers’ fallout. This was the third time he headed straight for Tony’s room. This was the third time Tony let him in without question and allowed Steve to press him against the wall and take him right there.
“Step away from him and leave before you get hurt.” There was a steely edge to Howard’s voice and he walked so he stood directly above them to emphasize his power over them. Tony tried to make himself smaller and Steve’s stomach tightened.
It was the façade that made it so difficult for Steve to get a read on Tony. It seemed no matter how much he thought he knew about Tony, there was also something new to learn. He did love that about him (and he would be lying if he said he was not willing to spend the rest of his life unlocking parts of him) but it also made it impossible for Steve to make the right move. If he came on too strong, then Tony would surely be scared away. If he didn’t come on strongly enough, then his advances would fly right over Tony’s head.
He didn’t think as he rang the doorbell, shifting excitedly on his feet. He was ready to tell Jarvis about the news when he saw the doorknob turn. He abruptly closed his mouth as it opened.
“I can still cut those aids off,” Tony says and he leaves the room quickly before Clint can see the blush on his face.
He was pressed against a wall in a corner that gave him a good view of the elevator, but also hid him from Tony’s view. He was in briefs because it
The bottle is empty. He doesn’t think as he smashes it into the metal table. He barely registers the pain as the glass cuts into his palms. His arm was still healing. His chest still hurt. His legs could barely carry his weight. A little bit of blood on his hands was nothing (especially considering how stained they were already).
Steve was just a boy from Brooklyn at heart. He loved Brooklyn, but he couldn’t help but dream of the bigger city. The bustling cars and bright lights. It was where dreams were made.
Steve looked gorgeous, disheveled but gorgeous. He had an unkempt beard and his hair had grown out, looking silky in the moonlight. His eyes were tired and weighed heavily on his face. There was a hint of melancholy in them, something Tony didn’t want to ponder.  His mouth was set in a thin, firm line. It was uncharacteristic of Steve to wear such a loose-fitting shirt, but it still seemed to highlight the sinewy body hidden underneath it.
“I know that you take everything on by yourself. That you carry the guilt on your shoulders and never allow it to dissipate. You think that you should do better, but you are already doing more than any of us. You are self-sacrificing and I adore that about you, but Tony it was
“I’m so sorry. I should have been there. I should have asked more questions. I was so afraid of pushing too hard that I didn’t even press at all and allowed this to continue. You never deserved this. You deserved love that I should have shown you in better ways. And I am so sorry that you’ve had to see me this way. You probably think that I am a monster. I understand if you don’t trust me anymore. Just please know that I love you.” Tony was the one in pain, but Steve was the one who could feel the burn of tears.
how to react to everything that made Tony so comfortable around him. Rhodey never stopped laughing as he recounted the early-morning-kitchen fiasco, but Tony couldn’t sense any judgement. If there was anything, it was pure joy. Rhodey left too soon for Tony’s liking, but not without an affectionate kiss on the cheek and a not so discrete inappropriate whisper to
Tony took a slow sip of his drink. The man had his hands on the hips of another woman. She was blonde and cute. But this man needed more. He needed hot and fiery. He needed Tony, Tony decided.
Steve got to his feet and suddenly Howard didn’t seem so tall. Steve tried to ensure that his fear didn’t emanate from him the same way Howard’s arrogance did. He motioned for Tony to move further behind him.
He got through another hour. He played beer pong (Clint won) and even danced a bit with Natasha. But eventually the aching his heart reached his head and he had to excuse himself.
Steve slowly took Tony’s hands into his and brought them to his chapped lips. A wave of electricity sparked between them. They could feel the pieces of their lives slotting back into place. The hole in their worlds was being filled again. Despite everything, it was clear that they would always be pulled together again.
“Rogers, this is family business. Leave.” Howard clenched his fists, but Steve only planted his feet firmer. Tony was his family, just as much as his mother and Bucky were. Steve would put his life on the line for his family, that would never change no matter how frightening Howard appeared.
“I miss you too,” Tony blurted out before he could stop himself. It was those eyes. Those treacherous, deep blue eyes of his. “You could have called. I’d have run to you in a second.”
The frightening part was that he had the power to end Tony’s life and so did Tony. The shared look tells them that neither has somebody to bring them back to reality. They’ve often wondered if their reality of being separated and lost is even better than the dreams.
“I couldn’t breathe anymore. I was lonely and empty. It was like everything in my life lost its colour and meaning. I somehow led myself here and it was like a breath of fresh air, albeit with some glass shards which tore at my heart as I realised I was alone here. It reminded me of you. It was where we first met and it drew me here. I just kept coming back. I thought that if you ever started to yearn for me the way I did you, you would wander here. And I would be right here waiting for you. Sorrowful, regretful and
It was barely audible. A strangled plea. But it was enough. It was Tony. His voice broke through the trance. His vision no longer tunneled as everything in his mind became focused on Tony. Steve’s hand stopped in mid-air, his teeth still bared. Howard continued to flail underneath him, desperately trying to use this moment to break free.
“You were never my second choice,” Steve says firmly, “it was never like that. I protected him to protect myself. I didn’t want to lose you and I never considered the fact that you would help me or that telling you the truth meant more than what I said. I never wanted to betray you like that. I left because I was repulsed by myself and my actions towards you. It didn’t mean I loved you any less.”
He was in Manhattan. Seventy years late, but he didn’t imagine it would matter much. He never expected to be thrown straight into another war, especially at the heart of a borough that he always wanted to visit.
The red that stained his nails and tried to hide underneath them. The bruising knuckles frantically cleaned leaving specks of red.
Natasha was dressed in a blood-red dress that hugged her figure in all the right places. She could feel the eyes of everybody in the room burning into her.
Steve’s eyes made a promise to Tony that he vowed to never break for as long as Tony would have him: to never hurt him or let anybody else do so. Somehow even after everything Tony had been through, he believed Steve. He wholeheartedly believed him. Believed in him. Steve pressed his forehead against Tony’s and they became the only people in the world. They were both in a position neither even wanted to see each other in but still found that comfort in each other.
He and Steve both used to dream about saving the world. They dreamed of keeping it safe and protecting it for as long as possible. But somehow their dreams changed. He’d have to do it alone.
Tony walked through the empty Avengers compound, which was still unsettlingly silent with the absence of Steve and his team.
No, Steve was not meant to be there. At least not without warning Tony in advance that he would be coming. Steve had always respected that, he always did.
They had been dating for nine months. The day they met Steve had arrived early for his shift at the campus coffee shop. The sun was barely up and Steve ended up walking straight into a pillar when he heard a voice. The disheveled student begged him for coffee because his machine broke and he assured Steve that without his coffee he would surely combust. Apparently genius never slept. Steve was enchanted by Tony Stark the first time they met.
She slammed it on the table which woke Tony up. She smirked at him before leaving. The tapping of her heels helped wake him up. He grinned as he saw it.
your fault. Sokovia was not your fault. Those people’s blood is not on your hands. You shouldn’t have to be held back by handcuffs that won’t fit.”
“Mr Stark, sir. I apologize for showing up unannounced. Can I see Tony?”  Steve pretended not to notice the way Howard guarded the entrance. He wasn’t the largest man, but his presence was always imposing.
“I didn’t handle it that well either, but I imagine you’d know all about that. You should’ve trusted me.” Tony didn’t mean for it to come out as bitter as it did. Steve grimaced and ran a weary hand through his hair.
Steve held Tony’s face in his hands. His fingers ghosted over his cheeks. He slowly leaned towards him, giving Tony a chance to back away. He didn’t.
His landing caught the attention of everybody in the vicinity. Phones were out and videos were being recorded. But Tony’s attention was focused on one man. A man who inexplicably stood out despite the crowd. Tony’s faceplate snapped open and he breathed heavily. Tony slowly walked closer as the other man’s gaze fixated on him.
As much as he wanted Steve, and boy did he want him, Tony pushed all of that away. He rushed past Steve and only managed to squeak a
He especially knew better than to be surprised when he woke up alone. There wasn’t a note. There never was.
Tony was pacing. His entire body seemed to be buzzing with nervous, agitated energy. He couldn’t sit still. His hands even shook as he tried to modify his gauntlets. He was sweating and it wasn’t hot. He was losing his mind.
Tony was at the bar and his eyes set on an utterly gorgeous blond across the room. He was muscle and hard lines. He looked delicious.
“Shut up? You blocked the WIFI on everything that I owned for a week. I couldn’t even use the internet on the TV. The only thing I had were my aids, but cutting those off would be fucking criminal. Now, you let Steve use it without even a warning. Oh, honey, you are soft for him!” Clint spun around on the counter (knocking a few fruits, the bastard).
When the Avengers moved into the tower, Tony made it clear that his mug was off-limits. It was respected at first since they were tentative around each other. The team was new and had won one major battle after splits within the team. They respected each other’s boundaries and it was peaceful, albeit dull and safe.
They told each other that they loved each other a month in. It was premature and Steve was astounded when Tony returned it. He never thought he could be this lucky. They were in college and all their friends told them they were too young to know the love of their lives. But they couldn’t feel his rapid heartbeats, the way his stomach did somersaults or the way his mind always seemed to be consumed by Tony. That was why he had to come to Tony immediately.
It was all he needed to reclaim Tony’s lips and drink in the wonderful sound that he made. It was easily his new favourite sound, and he was determined to hear it the whole night. Maybe even the rest of his life.
His fingers finally brushed against something cold. He pulls it out and almost salivates at the sight of it. It wasn’t the taste that made him go back. It was the feeling.
“It was all a plan?” Tony shouts incredulously, the pieces finally fitting into place. Steve blushed, but nodded.
“All those years of abuse, of pain, of sitting on the cold bathroom floor in the middle of the night with a knife pressed against my wrist. All those years of your constant berating and reminders that I was not good enough and that I actually deserved what you gave me every night. And well, I believed you. I stopped hating Mom for continuing to be a bystander and even began to believe that I should appreciate the lessons you were teaching me. That’s done now. I’m done. The part of my life that you hated the most saved me and now I can eradicate you from my life. You can’t hurt me anymore. You’ve always told me I was weak and you kept trying to instill that in me, to instill your convictions. But you made me stronger. I’m stronger because of you. I’m stronger because of Steve. I’m stronger.”
He stopped above Howard. Tony never thought he would ever see his father in such a vulnerable position. He had been completely knocked off the high horse he was always perched upon. And it felt good. He lost a fight. He could only manage to keep one eye open and the rest of his body was still lying in an uncomfortable position. He spat out blood and winced afterward clutching his ribs. He still managed to sneer at Tony in an attempt to intimidate him. Steve left them alone and Tony began laughing. A full guffaw.
But Steve waited. He never did anything too forward. He would stand by Tony’s side forever if that was what he wanted.
But then Steve would look at him with that intense gaze of his. Then he would grin from ear to ear. It would be so easy to trust him.
It wasn’t perfect. It wouldn’t be what it used to be. Steve knew that Tony would flinch around him for months to come. He would be distant and cold sometimes, maybe even bring up Siberia again. Steve deserved it. He breached his trust and he was determined to earn it back. Tony knew that Steve was stubborn and headstrong and he pledged to understand it. He knew that Steve would keep secrets about the other Avengers for a while and he had to respect that. They wouldn’t agree on everything, but they needed to allow the disagreement without launching into a fight.
(also this is my first long one...excited. of course i had to make it super sad and depressing. i think that's my style tbh)
“Leave. I never want to see you again.” Steve heard the crack in his voice. He heard him choke back a sob.
Then one day he and Clint were playing Mario Kart in the living room. Tony was decimating Clint, but it was no surprise. During a break, Tony went to have a glass of water (it shocked Steve, but yes Tony actually drink normal, still water) when Steve walked in. He and Natasha had just gotten back from a mission and his exhaustion was evident in his features. He rubbed his eyes and murmured morning pleasantries and grabbed a mug from the cupboard.
They sang for him and he cut his cake. He wished for Tony to be there. It was stupid and childish. Natasha planted a big kiss on his cheek and whispered that she was sorry. She pulled away with a smile and squeezed his shoulder.
“I understand why you didn’t sign. I just needed you to be safe for my own peace of mind. And then I lost you and suddenly none of that meant anything anymore” Tony says, remembering how bleak the compound had become without Steve’s radiant smile.
“I started to wish you took me with you, once I got over the fact that you had chosen Barnes over me. I was okay with being the second choice and sharing you as long as I got to be with you,” Tony continues. He already started so why stop now?
He burst into the room and his eyes immediately found Tony. A wave of pain washed over him as he took in the shaking ball he curled himself into in a corner of the room. His whimpers were barely audible but rang loudly in Steve’s ears—a sound he knew would haunt him for years to come. Steve spotted a few bruises on the back of his arms and saw the slight red that dotted and trailed down his face.
It was a big party. Everybody was there, except for one notable person. If it wasn’t him, Steve may not have minded as much. But Tony had promised. He had said that he wouldn’t miss Steve’s birthday for anything.
Before Steve could reply, Tony grabbed him by the waist (and tried to ignore the feeling of Steve’s body against his, which was still as firm and sturdy as it always had been which definitely did not remind of nights with his body flushed against Steve’s) and landed on the roof of the building. He dropped Steve quickly, suddenly feeling as though he was burning through the armour. Steve stumbled but quickly recomposed himself.
Tony slipped on the wet stone, stumbled into the wall, and fell head-first into the opening in front of him. He reflexively let go of everything he was carrying to soften the fall, but that meant that the torch snuffed itself out as it came in contact with the ground, and Tony was plunged in darkness. He pushed himself up with a groan, his chest aching at the sudden motion. He had to light the torch again. There was no time. He fumbled for his gun, half-formed thoughts about powder and sparks battling with a rising sense of dread. There was almost no time, a few seconds at most. He glanced around in desperation, hoping for a miracle, and stopped short at the sight of a thin ray of moonlight shining on the damp surface to his left. As he watched, the ray ever so slightly shifted, and Tony knew he’d found the
Tony ran faster. Behind him, Rhodey shouted something about idiots and tripping and breaking their neck. He might have had a point, but it was too late to worry about this kind of thing. Tony would run like a “fucking madman”, thanks Pepper, until he found the key. Tony spared a thought to be thankful that Jarvis was still on the airship, because he would have popped a vein at the sight of Tony pushing himself further than his heart allowed it. Sorry, Jarvis, he’d recharge his heart later.
Tony was right at the edge of the desert, staring into the distance, his body still. Was there something in the desert? Steve squinted at the horizon, but all he could see was sand, sand, and more sand.
“You’re right. If I could ask you for a favour, would you please help me exit the guild domain without getting noticed by Stark?”
And, well, the problem was, he really was Tony Stark. So he decided to tell them, briefly, about the key, Pepper and Rhodey, and the teleportation, which led to the question, where was he?
It didn’t change the fact that she’d cursed him, and that since then, Steve had been more of a nuisance than help.
And wasn’t that the problem? Steve hadn’t told Stark because he didn’t want Stark to know. A lot of good that had done Steve, because whatever he seemed to do, Stark always found a way to know exactly what he’d been doing. There wasn’t any point in trying to be secretive, Steve admitted to himself with resignation. There wasn’t anything to be done, Stark had his magic everywhere in the castle, it was linked to Jarvis. Steve should count himself fortunate that Stark wasn’t also aware of what Jarvis said to Steve.
He’s slept maybe six hours, which all in all isn’t that bad. He got the rest he didn’t need, and his mind is still exhausted beyond reason. He doesn’t want any of this. Doesn’t want to be in bed, doesn’t want to get out of bed, doesn’t want to deal with the outside world.
The armour fell, its light dim, but as the Witch dived after it, her stingers ready to shock and pierce through the armour, the blue circle in its chest lit up, and a massive beam of blue shot up to meet the yellow crackling magic.
“Now that that’s settled, let’s try to find out what this spell or poem could be. You said that you tried to understand it, did you write something down or find some hidden meaning, maybe?”
He was in what might be a kitchen, but cluttered full of diverse objects and apparatus. If he squinted, he could see the hint of the outline of a sofa on one end of the room, facing a hearth where some embers were still glowing. On the other end, there was a table covered in dirty plates and pots and pans, with food throwed haphazardly on it. There had to be a faucet somewhere, but he couldn’t see it. There was a chandelier with a few of the candles burning, the others half melted or simply not there. The room was stacked full of books, parchments, papers, tools, metal plates and parts, pouches filled with herbs and bizarre plants. On the fireplace mantel, there was an array of sinister objects: fangs, bits of fur, and several skulls, with one that was notable in that it was a
Cap and Stark jumped apart, both of their faces red. Stark was the first to recover. He sent a piercing look at Tony.
Jarvis had been a falling star, and by saving him, Tony had bound them together. He had given something to Jarvis, then, when he was just a boy. Jarvis had mentioned that Tony had felt sorry for him. Had Tony given him an emotion? Empathy? Compassion?
But Jarvis had confirmed Steve’s fears: Tony wasn’t available, and if he wasn’t dead, it could only mean one thing, that the Witch really had him. And even if he was wrong, even if the Witch was lying, Steve couldn’t take the risk.
He couldn’t feel bad about telling the truth about Tony, but he still felt bad that he hadn’t managed to avoid the outcome Tony had been afraid of.
Steve thought back to the fateful night when he’d been cursed and he knew that she wouldn’t have cursed Steve if Tony hadn’t been looking for him. But it wasn’t Tony’s fault that Steve had been cursed, he couldn’t have predicted that Janet would turn evil, he’d done everything he could to find Steve, he’d even helped him afterwards. The Witch cursing him made more sense now, he wasn’t just a fling for Tony, he was the man Tony’d been looking for for years. Of course, she would want to hurt Steve. She must have used James to confirm that he was the right one, since he knew about Steve via Natasha. Poor James had only been dragged into this mess because he knew Natasha.
“There you are. I’ve been looking everywhere for you, my dear. Now, why don’t we leave this place?” And with these peculiar words, he dragged Steve away, and Steve could only follow.
Maybe it wouldn’t have happened, or maybe it would have. Maybe the Witch of the Waste would have found out about Steve regardless. Maybe she would have killed him if she didn’t know what emotional link there was between Steve and Tony.
“Still, I should—I won’t stay a human much longer—I went back to Natasha and told her everything about the curse. She knows, she knows it was me, knows what happened to you, knows you left your home. She still—She doesn’t blame me, but she should, I don’t—”
Steve asked Jarvis about Shield, and why they wanted Stark’s favours. If they needed his skills, couldn’t they buy them from him in Ma’hattan? Lord Fury had to know that Potts was Stark, right? By the way, why wasn’t Stark part of a guild?
gets out of their bed. It’s not as if it’s fucking hard. All he has to do is sit up, pull the covers aside, put his feet on the ground, and stand up.
, Tony. You can sell magic and I can sell paintings and supplies and we’ll find a way to combine the two into something even better.”
Stark had already fulfilled the first one, in that case, since he’d caught a falling star. The next instruction in the poem was to “Get with child a mandrake root”. If Stark simply needed to avoid doing that, Steve could help. He could uproot all the mandrakes they had, look for them and avoid them, keep them away from Stark.
“I got a message from the King. He wants me to find Strange. I mean, he’s always wanted that, but now he wants me to actually do something. So, yeah. I’m going to see if I can find him. Make myself useful until the end, I guess. I’ll be back.”
If you asked Tony how he deserved to die, he’d never tell you that dying at the hands of the man he’s wronged the most is the most fitting death he could have.
And Tony did not have a whole year on his hands, thank you very much. There was a war going on, and he wasn’t strictly speaking allowed on the Swedish island Gotland, seeing as the kingdom’s supposed neutrality in the war meant that they didn’t really look kindly upon any foreign secret service agents running around.
The next day, Steve looked in apprehension as Stark opened the door after turning the disk to the black part. The tendrils of darkness inched inside, just like the last time, licking at their feet, blending with their shadows. Steve felt a chill run down his spine as Stark turned to him, hair billowing around him and darkness creeping up his legs.
Was it a cosmetic spell? Just a spell to hide his imperfections? But why had Stark gone into such a state if it was nothing but a superficial spell?
Steve was just finishing an almost abstract drawing of Jarvis when he heard a loud bang. He looked out of his room, and saw the bathroom door open wide, steam billowing out, Stark leaning against the frame, clad in only a white towel that sat extremely low on his hips. He was grabbing his hair in both hands and crying out a steady litany of no’s. Steve stepped out of his room, wondering what was happening, and ended up following Stark downstairs when the wizard slipped into the kitchen and slouched down into the chair near the fireplace. He was still holding his head in his hands, muttering plaintively, a puddle of water forming underneath his chair, dropping from his hair and skin.
But after hours and hours of hard work, the bathroom was finally done. It was beautiful, the porcelain shining brightly, the taps glowing golden, even the bottles and jars were clean. Steve could finally admire the ironwork of the mirror and the abstract symbols on the tiles. It truly was a magnificent bathroom and seeing it this clean made something warm well up in Steve’s chest.
Tony thinks of blue eyes and blond hair and doesn’t know if he should be thankful or if he should curse Steve for not leaving him in the fire.
Wouldn’t like that he was hopelessly falling for Tony, even if he knew that he had no chance with him.
? While Tony was still injured? While Jarvis had been nothing more than embers just an hour ago? It felt as if Tony was overestimating his own strength.
The hills would be best, he thought, because he could walk down to Brooklyne and take a horse cab to Shield from there. It wasn’t that far, and he had the money required, since Stark payed him for the household duties and the shop keeping. If he left immediately after the wizard, he would be able to get back in just under two days.
She had attacked him, for no apparent reason, making his life miserable, changing his very body, and he wanted to make her pay. He wanted to hit her, he wanted to hold her down and make her reverse the curse, he wanted to—
Tony immediately sat down on the ground before the weredog, petting him this time. Steve sat down on the other side of the weredog, feeling a little weird about a man petting a man, even if he was in the shape of a dog.
This is a surprise, to say the least. What happened, what changed this man so much that one of his core deficits, his empathy, is now reduced to nothing but glacial apathy?
“We haven’t got a choice, J. She’ll find us today, for sure, and then we’ll have to do it regardless. It’s moving or dying, and I know what I’m choosing.”
It took a while to decide what to paint on it, but in the end Steve decided on a simple pattern of alternating bands of deep blue and red. In the middle, he painted a blue circle, leaving space for a star in the centre. While he worked, Jarvis looked and helped, casting a simple spell to protect the paint from wear and tear. When Steve was done, he admired the shield: it was perfect.
They looked up at him, and Cap stepped towards Tony, body-language open and reassuring, but Iron Man held him back with a hand on his wrist.
Tony stayed that way for a long time, immobile under the shield while Steve did his best to stave off the Witch’s increasingly frantic offensive. Tony’s hair was standing on end, floating around his head. His eyes were completely taken over by the electric blue glow, the signature colour of his magic. His hands were nothing more than claws, his legs bent oddly. He was transforming into a monstrous human-sized raven. But that meant that he was using his magic, all of it, every last reserve. This was his last attempt at stopping the Witch. If Tony failed, Steve knew they’d both die.
His hands are trembling, his head throbbing with a phantom pain. He locks down the workshop, locks down the whole tower, because he needs time to think, to figure this out, stop the time loop. He needs time before Steve comes in and tries to kill him.
“Iron Man! I was looking for you!” A deep baritone rang out, just as a tall and broad-shouldered man entered the gym. He was wearing what could only be described as the American flag turned into tights, which made Tony’s hopes go up, even if his clothing looked more fit for a circus than anything else. Or maybe a comic book. The beefcake’s boots made Tony think of the musketeers he’d read about when he was a child, even if they’d never been such a bright red in the books. These two fellas sure wore bright colours. But the red, white, and blue were a good sign. Better that than black, white, and red, right? Maybe he really was in the US, and this would turn out to be a simple mistake.
Stark, calmer now that some of the mystery around Tony had cleared, stared at a point in space, deep in thought. Cap himself was looking between Tony and Stark like he couldn’t quite believe what he was seeing. Tony tried to come up with a reasonable explanation for his current predicament. He was coming up depressingly empty-handed. He really hoped there was a way to make the key bring him back to his own world. What had Stark said? No magic, but weird energy readings? That was a start, wasn’t it?
The man staring right back at him has the right bone-structure, the right hair, the right body shape--mmmm, Tony'd recognise these pecs
“I’m going to go scouting for someplace to move the castle to. Be careful, don’t open the door to anyone, alright?”
He opened the green and black doors first, verifying that they still led to the hills and O’Casta’s house, and nodded to himself. Then, he opened the blue door, waving Steve over. Steve walked out, and his heart lurched in his chest when he recognised the street he’d lived in for so many years. They really had moved to his shop. From the outside, nothing had changed, but as soon as he stepped foot inside again, he was back into the castle’s kitchen. He’d have to go through the empty rooms of the castle and see if he recognised his old bedroom.
Tony was fighting the Witch, and with every spell that she threw at him, he grew a feather. She didn’t stop, didn’t stop when he collapsed into a heap, when the scales took over his face, when the marks were hidden beneath coarse black feathers, didn’t stop until he was immobile, a mass of feathers and claws and scales.
“If it is him, then he is the foremost liar I have ever met,” Steve says. He runs his fingers over the bold lines of Stark’s writing. “He found me - as Nomad - in the woods and he claimed to have no idea what I was looking for. He was very convincing.”
“So you don’t find it unpleasant, except that you do.” Sir Anthony finally turns, wiping sweat from his forehead with an arm. He raises an eyebrow.
But it is as if everything is just that much smaller than when he last saw it. The paint peels morosely off his windowsill, the dark bricks have crumbled a little more, and his footsteps seem too loud. Military boots, no doubt.
it!” Steve tries to shout, but it comes out more as a gasp, pointing at the half-uncovered face of Tony Stark.
As their hands release, Steve sees it, catching the glow out of the corner of his eye, and turning towards it instinctually.
He is halfway through when Sam walks in, taking in the scene: Steve seated on the sofa, listening, rapt, to Sir Anthony’s playing. He gives Steve a knowing look that makes Steve blush right to the roots of his hair, but he too sits down and applauds politely as Sir Anthony finishes the piece.
He pulls himself together and opens the door, stepping in as quietly as he can and nodding to Rick, who takes his hat and coat. It is not very far to the door to the morning room and it is ajar, the music louder here, but just as… ethereal.
“Sketches,” he says instead, stepping back and clapping his hands together. “That is why I am here. Sketches. Yours. You invited me over to see them and here I am.”
“I am recovered now, though, so I shall return to the festivities,” Steve says. “Sir Anthony, my thanks for your kind concern.” He bows smoothly and smiles as politely as he can manage at Mr Stane before stepping back inside.
“There is something about you.” Tony lifts his hand to wag a finger. There is dirt under his nail, Steve notes, almost absently. “Something I just can’t put my finger on.”
“So this guy had your phone, did he have your inhaler as well?” Iron Man asks. There’s a strange waver to his voice and Steve realises that Iron Man isn’t being patronising - not intentionally at least. He’s worried. About Steve. Because Steve isn’t breathing properly. Yeah, that makes sense. He points to where he can see the strap of his bag sticking out from the rubble covering the guy.
The other guy is half under rubble. He must have been knocked down and pinned as Iron Man came through the ceiling. Steve scrabbles over to him, his breath quick and short, but there are more important things to worry about than breathing right now. His phone. He needs his phone. He needs that recording.
“Maybe we can help each other,” Barton says. Steve’s mind switches gears, starts to reassess what he knows. Barton had been going through his bags, Barton’s a better shot with a gun than a groom should be, Barton’s voice changes when he doesn’t think anyone important is listening.
“It is to Tony’s benefit that he inherited it,” Stane continues. “Capable of making friends with anyone, no matter how lowly their beginnings.” The entire table shifts uncomfortably and Colonel Rhodes clears his throat.
Steve knows these people. They are as close to him as family, but it feels like he has ended up in the wrong household.
He does not hear a gun being cocked, but he does hear one, distinct footstep behind him. It must be meant to be heard, for it is too close to be the first such step, and too distinct to be any attempt at stealth.
“But if you're not interested in dalliances, you may wish to be careful. He has somewhat of a reputation.”
They are both good dancers, their steps light and keen to the rhythm. They make it seem as though they are skipping on air.
“You look very well for a man I shot,” Barton says, his voice conversational. His arms hold the bow string taut, not a quaver in them. Steve does not doubt that were he to loose the arrow it would fly true. And he is not sure how well even he could take an arrow to the heart. Wanda, alas, is too far away to help him now.
Every step feels like it takes forever. Steve can’t run fast enough. His body is failing him again. His legs won’t listen as he urges them faster, and the gap between him and the wall seems insurmountable.
A few times, when Sam is dancing near him, he sees his friend smothering a laugh at Steve’s faltering conversation and attempts to side step flirtation, and he’s reminded of Bucky’s despair over ever finding him a dance partner. Bucky would be just as amused to see Steve now, he knows, at last able to get a dance, but still as terrible as he has ever been at any conversation that does not end in a fight.
“There must be someone we can inform. The crown has people to deal with things like this,” Sam points out, reasonably.
“We knew it was possible,” Steve says. “You said it yourself. But I was too blinded by- I was too blind to believe it.”
“While I understand the impulse, we have no evidence to that fact,” she says. “And there are any number of people who could be in a position to take advantage of such things. Stane is a…”
“Indeed, I think not,” Tony says. “Colonel Danvers, tell me more of your travels. I am sure the stories Colonel Rhodes has been telling us are nothing compared to yours.”
“I daresay you are right about that,” Steve says. “Is there a problem with banditry in the area, then?” he enquires.
The ceiling crumbles down, crashing in chunks and lumps of rubble, but the desk, built to hold a dozen or more heavy computers, holds steady. The whining noise grows louder and then there is a bright blue light as one of the Hydra guards fires his weapon, followed by an almost familiar sound as white light flashes back.
“You are welcome at any time,” Steve tells him quickly. “I only meant that I am sorry I could not be here to welcome you, or to hear more of your music. It was very beautiful.”
Camp Lehigh is a fair way to drive, but he should be able to make it there and back in a night. If the car doesn’t fall apart halfway. It’s shaking and rattling as he presses down the accelerator, held together by duct tape and will power at this point.
“I wouldn't want to step on their feet,” he says, trying not to think of Peggy and the dance they never had.
No name is given, but it is the diary of a woman who has chosen to take action, although she knows it is illegal, and though it means that if she is captured it will mean death for her and possible ruin for her family.
“You’re probably right about that,” he agrees, then he steps forwards and Steve puts all his attention into his breathing, because if he starts thinking about how Iron Man is
“I agree,” Mrs Romanoff says. “And in that case, we need to approach the whole thing more cautiously.”
“You have no idea what I would do,” Steve says, his voice a little harsh. “For the right reasons.” He wants to tell Sir Anthony right now, wants to explain it all, but he knows he can’t. He cannot believe Sir Anthony capable of treason, but even so, to tell him would be to put him in an unconscionable position. He steps forwards, almost against his will, swallowing down the truth.
He begins the evening with an observance that the late baronet, Sir Howard, had a marvellous magnetic charisma about him.
And whether it is Barton at all. Although Steve can think of no good explanation for Barton’s behaviour other than that. It is all very peculiar. Why had he been going through Steve’s saddle-bags? Why had he let Nomad go? How did he think that Nomad could be of assistance to him?
“Indeed,” she says. “I didn’t mean to offend you, I only wished to give advice as you are new to the area as well. If you change your mind then-”
“I know their voices, and it's possible I should know the treason if I should see it. You cannot wish to do nothing.”
“Weapons aren’t like fashion, you know,” Tony says, stepping out of the carriage. “We don’t just change it because we feel like it. Although, they do at least look like they’re well made.”
He throws the bags. It’s a difficult throw, the bags ungainly and not built to fly through the air, but Barton’s not the only one with good aim. After ricocheting his shield off numerous walls, throwing a few bags straight ahead is child’s play.
His mind is still reeling at the implications. If the caller had been telling the truth the whole time. If Hydra is back - and it seems like it is - this is bigger than anything he’s ever looked into before. He’s helped people, sure. But he’s never - this is huge. He’s going to need-
“A-” Tony catches sight of Steve and his words falter. “Oh, you must be kidding me! A highwayman? In this day and age? And what even are those pistols? Those are antiques! Do they even fire?”
“If you must,” Steve says, grinding the words out of his gritted teeth without considering them. It is an abominably rude thing to say to one’s host, but Steve finds he does not care. He has worn out his social graces for the evening.
“There’s been a lot of disappearances recently, a lot of young and beautiful men and women, all around your age. And it has been going on for almost as long as Stark’s castle has been near the town. You should be careful, Steve. I hear there are a lot of blond men missing.”
His fingers met skin, and a blinding blue light illuminated the kitchen. When it died out, Steve’s hands were splayed on Tony’s chest, a bright star floating above them.
He wasn’t thinking clearly, during that fight. It was an error in judgement. He let his feelings get the best of him.
The scarecrow hopped around a bit, seemingly looking for something. He leaned in towards several shelves, fluttered around the kitchen, all the while making little impatient sounds.
“Stark sent me to convince you not to make him court sorcerer. He said to tell you I’m a cousin of his, but we’re not related.”
“You’re welcome. I’m sorry about messing up the jars. I’m sorry—I’m sorry about getting angry earlier, too, that was uncalled for.”
“Maybe if you sat there. I like to draw people. If you sat right there, by the shoe, you’d have interesting shadows on your face and chest. You could pose nude, and nothing would be revealed if you bent your leg a little. It would be a great study in contrast.”
“I assure you, no one here has tried to cast the spell, I just want to read the rest of it. With my hand on my heart, I promise we’ll be gone as soon as I read it, and you won’t hear from us again.”
