"You don't know that, Mycroft."
The frustrated line between John's eyebrows is the same as he remembers. So are the crossed arms, the stance; how many times has Sherlock been on the receiving end of that look? How many more times has he seen it directed at a third party? He can almost hear him, hear him sighing, hear the shifting of his coat as he shakes his head ever so slightly -
Harry sighs.
"One step better than Theresa Stillen, then," Harry says, sounding a little reassured. She starts up the stairs. "Honestly, the stories you tell, I wouldn't put it past him to have tried."
John points a finger at him. "You are not allowed to speak. You are a terrible human being."
The precipitate goes white.
just before he walked into a drugs bust and the way John had slipped out of the door of 221B and said nary a word to the police as he ran off to save a man he barely knew.
"Attempted mugging," John corrects, shrugging. "They were just hungry." He blinks at Sherlock. "You really didn't notice? God, did you honestly not see how late home I was?"
"Turn white, turn white, turn white," John chants under his breath.
One cup of tea being made. Sherlock's coat is in his room because he couldn't be arsed to hang it up last night. John probably called out anyway, just to check, and with no response and prior experience with Sherlock's admittedly peculiar schedule. . .
He briefly contemplates making tea, but he's comfortable here on the sofa, upside-down though he may be, and he can't be arsed.
or something of its ilk, Mycroft - before a call appears. Also Mycroft.
He gets up, then; leaves John there, frozen and staring, shocked, at the wall.
"John is," Sherlock begins, in an ever so slightly softer tone, "as you have correctly deduced yourself, gradually improving. However, given the tendency for hypothermia patients to lean toward atrophy, I would recommend putting on your sirens."
John rolls his eyes wholeheartedly. "Don't be
Nothing. He sighs, far too used to this kind of thing, and goes to pick up the dreg-filled mug by Sherlock's hand. And then, as he turns to leave - said hand closes around his arm, just this side of too tight.
Doctor
There are droplets on the paper, but it's not raining.
a familiar voice says.
"You tripped him into bed yet?"
"Oh, um -"
The ink is blurring slightly under the salt of his tears. Sherlock regrets this, not for its rare display of humanity, but for its possible destruction of what caused this whole ordeal.
"Are you blushing?" John asks, delighted and incredulous in equal measure.
Which he never gets to use, since the song restarts the second it ends. Set on loop, on Youtube. Sherlock hadn't known John was technologically literate enough to know how to do that.
Sherlock lets the insinuations of that slide in favour of watching him. "It's a system?" he says with some surprise.
Irritatingly unruffled, his brother says,
John eyes the door, trying to see if Sherlock is listening in, then says, "Upstairs somewhere."
Sherlock says, "You couldn't give a toss about getting the credit. You would have offered them a free clinic visit if they'd stayed around long enough to hear you finish the sentence." His lips twitch up into something that might (good God) resemble fondness. "You're
"I'm feeling an odd sense of role reversal," Sherlock notes.
And yet, as soon as his door opens a crack the world filters through, and Sherlock is left frozen.
"If it's a knuckle sandwich, I don't want it."
worrying -"
He can feel Sherlock looking at him. There's a pause, and then a slightly incredulous huff of laughter. More footsteps, and then Sherlock's face appears above him, looking vastly amused.
"No," Sherlock lies. His ears have gone completely red now. "Um. I'm glad you trust me so implicitly, John."
Alone, indeed.
John waits until the kettle has filled and the tap has been turned off to answer. "Sure."
"Coming down in stair rods, isn't it?" He says, attempting to shake his hair dry like a dog. And then, noticing his box: "Hey, what are you doing with that?"
"Text Lestrade," John says, staring up at him, suspended. "Tell him the boyfriend did it."
It's a testament to the kind of people John was often partnered with in school science lessons (from primary through to medical) that he doesn't drop the beaker he's holding. He doesn't make an outward sign of alarm, either, miraculously enough, even though his pulse spikes harshly; though he suspects that's due to military training more than secondary school's infamous Trevor Dent.
The little stretch of café front Sherlock texted him the location of is abandoned when he gets there, but Lestrade can hear shouting nearby, and he's not actually a complete idiot. He's nearly blinded by the sunlight coming off the Thames when he ducks out of the mouth of the alley, but he just squints until he can see the irritated silhouette of a certain detective.
"Not my business." John hesitates, then pulls on one of her sleeves to stop her. "Harry. . ."
Mycroft sighs, small and quiet and sad. He says nothing of disadvantages or caring or opening your heart to certain people only with discretion and caution.
It wasn't Winters, but one of us liked taking photos. York, her name was. She had a good eye for them. Absolute demon at poker."
It never ceases to amaze him how contradictive the English language is.
Or maybe it's just because he's bored.
Ironically enough, he watches the rainy, post-surgery video first, cuing it up just as John is walking through the door after going out to get milk.
He takes the captured moment into the heart of his mind palace, more careful than if he were holding water, a handful of sand, paper-thin crystal - he places it, pride of place, in the direct centre of his mind, and tries to ignore all of the connotations.
"You'd deserve it," John says, sobering up.
I can't just leave three men in the cold and the rain with nothing but the clothes on their backs."
John Watson is even more of a miracle than Sherlock had ever imagined. One headline, one tiny scowl-line between his eyebrows, and the man has raised a dead man's morale over half the globe.
Sherlock blinks at the ceiling. What is going on over there? "Mycroft?"
"You look like you broke your own brain," Sherlock accuses. John suddenly realises he's been locked in a staring contest with him for God-knows how long.
Sherlock hiccups around the sob that wrenches its way out of his reluctant throat. The phone goes silent and still, listening, probably, but he scrunches his eyes shut, sinks to the floor next to it and lets another sob tear free. Sod the microphone bugs on his burner, he thinks, near-hysterical; Mycroft knows already.
"Sherlock, think about it. You're his equal."
"I'm not sure that anything will work."
The woman silently prayed as she shut her eyes.
He still didn't kiss back.
"Do it."
"Well, it's too late now."
"What are you talking about?"
So he decided to live but all the life was gone from him.
"No. You're staying here to heal." he said sternly.
Sherlock glared at him maliciously, tightening his grip on the handle of the knife.
"You really think so?"
John then backed down.
Sherlock abruptly began mumbling again. He was, not unlike Lestrade had suggested earlier, making deductions of some sort almost under his breath, but they didn't make sense and almost seemed morbid in nature. By the look in his eyes, he didn't appear to be entirely present, lost in his broken mind palace.
"Where are you going? We didn't start any fun yet~."
"Then come back."
Sherlock bent down to help, and Moriarty smirked.
"If you're sure."
"Hm, perhaps I'm mistaking the name for another."
John snored a bit more.
"To go pay Mycroft a visit."
The taller man released him. "What was it you were dreaming about?" He asked.
Sherlock finally began to relax a bit.
"I'm trying."
Sherlock leaned his head against John's.
"He didn't kill that girl though."
Eventually, Sherlock started shaking his head.
"John... I'm so tired..."
John paled a bit.
There was a pause where neither of them said anything, and after it, Sherlock concluded: "Goodbye, John."
Johh smiled as well as he gently kissed Sherlock's cheek.
"Oh, nothing, other than the fact that I'm not going to be returning to Baker Street for a while. You know, with me about to be the main suspect in a murder case and all."
Sherlock leaned closer, as if to kiss John, though his brow was tightly knotted in discomfort.
"Unless you want to ask Sherlock's brother."
John didn't try to make him.
The Consulting Detective shook his head gently.
John sighed and shook his head as he handed him the phone.
For a split-second, he almost seemed to oppose being released, but he quickly (and rather awkwardly) released John to allow himself to be let go.
He wheeled over to him.
"Kill her, Sherlock." Moriarty said. "You brought the knife."
He did what he asked and called for an ambulance.
"Ah, I see."
He found that he had a cellphone in his hand.
John wrote down the address and handed it to the Inspector.
"Yes."
"Toodles," Moriarty sung after him with a smirk.
John watched closely.
"Oh boy..."
Sherlock breathed a brief sigh of relief. "... I'm sorry, did I do anything... strange?"
He again let his eyes wander to his friend.
John walked over and opened the door.
"I can't think anymore. My head's empty."
Harry says, triumphant.
"Hypochondriacs have apparently taken to coming in waves."
"You know what you have to do, don't you?"
"Bi," Sherlock breathes, looking like he does when things slot together for him during a case. "It's a pun title."
"Sure looks like it," he agrees.
"Boringly enigmatic," Sherlock drawls, hiding the way his pulse has picked up. "Would you care to elaborate?"
"Only probably?"
Conductor of light, as always.
"Believe me, you're managing it quite well yourself," Sherlock says dryly.
Nothing to do, in the world, at all.
Caring is not an advantage. Caring is not an advantage.
"Ugh," he says to the room at large, and then, soon after, "Tea?"
The words are rich in his mouth, infused with the force of his exasperation and frustration and boredom and low, simmering anger, and he doesn't quite realise how similar it is to Sherlock's usual bored vitriol after it's out of his mouth and Sherlock's wide smile has twitched itself into a huge, unabashedly entertained grin.
And then, as if on cue:
John snorts a little. The temptation to demand tea is extraordinarily high, but he resists. "Even I crack eventually, Sherlock. You were gone for two and a half weeks, I wasn't needed for any locum work, there were cold case files lying about. Of course I had a look through."
"Is not present," Mycroft cuts in smoothly. "You will be able to operate safely, Doctor Watson."
"What happened?"
He tries to say "Ah," like he isn't bitterly disappointed at the lack of an opportunity to end his month-long absence of cases with an exciting chase.
John has no idea what Sherlock's found on his face, but he half-shrugs. "A loose system. Essentially just wrote which videos are on it."
"Watch the road."
Sherlock looks like he wants to laugh, though, so he probably failed. Oh well. He should have never hoped to hide something from the most observant man in England.
John protests. He tries to ignore the way Sherlock is steadily paying less and less attention to his microscope. "And which spaghetti incident are you talking about, anyway? I can name at least three different ones off the top of my head."
"Isn't all the blood going to your head?"
"Are you," John deadpans. This could go where he hopes it will, or it could go entirely the other way and land in experiment territory.
"Willpower does nothing to an experiment's results," Sherlock tells him, but he's leaning closer, scientific curiosity and the pull of a case's finale combining into a kind of magnetism even the great Sherlock Holmes cannot resist.
Sherlock snorts. "No. Whilst it does explain the presence of Anderson -"
Lestrade lifts his hands for peace. "I'm not having a go at you for it," he defends. "Though even you have to agree it's a bit out of the norm."
John still has a hand on the wheel. He's doing most of the driving.
Lestrade does not think all of this out in full until later, but the sums the gist of it up in his head on the very first night of their first case together, as he watches them walk off and giggle and confront Mycroft Holmes and his poncy umbrella. His mind recalls vaguely Sherlock's muffled
“I didn’t,” he says, breathes in, “I didn’t want to.”
“Yes,” Sherlock said. He sounded very tired. “It’s my… design.”
good. He sleeps in Sherlock’s bed every night. He kisses Sherlock almost whenever he wants to. He has so much sex he’s a little bit worried about his functioning abilities, but it turns out he can get hard pretty much anytime Sherlock wants him to. Maybe it’s love. He’s fucking in love with this man, and it’s goddamn scary, but also there’s nothing he can do about it, so he spreads Sherlock on the kitchen table when Sherlock asks him to and fucks Sherlock and mutters embarrassing declarations of love against the sticky skin on the small of Sherlock’s back after they’ve both come and he hasn’t pulled himself out yet.
“When I was away.”
“I’m not a –“
“Me,” John said. Then he cleared his throat. He stood as tall as he could, which admittedly wasn’t very tall. But he had been a captain in the army. He
Sherlock bites his lip. He could just go. He could stand up and go to the bathroom and lock the door, and later, they would pretend this conversation never happened. They would pretend John never tried to tell him he doesn’t feel the same way about Sherlock than Sherlock does about him. But John’s hand is still on Sherlock’s thigh and Sherlock can’t make himself push it away.
should go to sleep. You look tired.”
Sherlock swallows. John touches his face, pushes the hair from his forehead.
“I thought I meant something to you.”
“No,” Sherlock said, exercising divine patience, even though he wasn’t, strictly speaking,
“Of course she does,” John says, “she’s a clever girl, aren’t you, darling? Aren’t you? You… Sherlock?”
“…out of line.”
“It was nice, filming that movie with you.”
Sherlock glances at John. John is chewing on his lower lip, his eyes fixed on the screen. He looks nervous in the way he rarely does. “Why?” Sherlock asks.
“I don’t think it works like that,” John says, his fingers rubbing circles against Sherlock’s scalp. And shaking. But only slightly.
“I’m fucking you,” Sherlock said, sounding confused. Also, he was fucking John. Slowly, but it counted. It was slightly gay and
“Not my business, I know,” John says. “My grandfather died of lung cancer.”
Sherlock frowned at him. “But you said my performance was adequate.”
, because John was sure it had cost a fucking fortune. But it was just a coat. If John had seen a coat like that on anyone else, he wouldn’t have thought about it twice. Sure, it was long and mysterious, but many coats were long and mysterious. There was absolutely no reason why that one coat should have been special.
he had had this feeling before.
” John coughs, then takes a step away. “And why do you think I would want to… anything like that?”
“Oh, have you got a case?” Mrs. Hudson asks, walking through the doorway. Her hip is aching again, it’s obvious. Otherwise she wouldn’t be so slow.
“Hmm,” John says, his fingertips running back and forth on Sherlock’s side. It almost tickles but not quite. “Because I can understand if it wasn’t good. I suppose giving one isn’t the same thing than receiving one, and since that was my first try, I’m sure I’m going to become better once I get more practice. In case you want to try again, of course. Because we can do other stuff. We can… anything you want, really.”
John moves away.
Okay, so it turns out I couldn't get this finished in three chapters, so now we are going to have four chapters and an epilogue. Surprise!
“…Dr. Watson?”
“I don’t know what’s going to happen. With you. You and me. I don’t even know if you want a… A relationship.”
Sherlock blinked. John Watson was standing in the kitchen next to what looked a little like a stove. He was holding a kettle and looking at Sherlock.
I’m having a hard time keeping up with you.”
“Yes,” John said.
“Yes,” the robot said. “I will come to the appointment. On certain conditions.”
to go, because all this time he’s been trying to get back to John, and John is here now.
, I don’t have
“You didn’t have to –,” Sherlock begins, but he’s too tired to guess what he’s supposed to say.
Sorry for the delay, I got very badly distracted by everything else in life, including watching television. But now here's the last chapter, and I also wrote a tiny epilogue. Thank you to everyone for reading <3
“You kept
Sherlock lets out a sound that sounds like a laugh but not happy.
“Completely unnecessary,” Sherlock said, watching him from between his spread knees. “I’m perfect.”
Well, he supposed it was obvious, considering the way they had met: him lying on his back on the floor, and Sherlock sitting on his crotch, pressing him down by the shoulders, staring at his neck with a hungry look in his eyes. John should have understood it right away. And he
“No,” Sherlock said, watching him as he settled behind Sherlock. “But please, proceed.”
John breathes in. “I think we can stop bringing that up.”
“I don’t want to think about it,” Sherlock said. The truth was, he didn’t remember it.
Sherlock nods. He shouldn’t be relieved. He feels awful, and optimistic, and like an idiot.
Sherlock opened his mouth to tell John that he hadn’t kissed John. Instead, he had been meaning to bite John but had remembered what a mess it was to drink from humans and had then regained his self-control. But then he came to think that maybe John wouldn’t be happy if he found out that Sherlock had almost killed him. Maybe John would decide he didn’t want to live with Sherlock, and then he would leave. And Sherlock didn’t want that. John smelled so good.
“Haven’t you read the script?” the producer asks, sounding surprised.
But it’s not an illusion, so John thinks and wraps himself around Sherlock at night. He kisses the back of Sherlock’s neck and then stays awake, stroking Sherlock’s hair, when Sherlock falls asleep. It’s not an illusion. All of this is real, and there’s no reason to think that it would have to end. They can grow old together. They can have that. Other people do, so surely it’s possible for them too.
“I’m not…” But then he thinks about something. “You told Mary.”
Blow John. Offer John oral sex. He could say it, he
doing?” the human asked. Sherlock wasn’t exactly surprised to find out that the human lacked intellectual skills, but he was slightly disappointed anyway. On the other hand, he had just woken up. He was always sensitive after waking up. “What are
“I understand,” Sherlock said.
“I have to tell you something,” Sherlock says and touches John’s arm. His thumb brushes over John’s elbow. “I’m not like other people.”
“Sorry,” Sherlock says to the producer and frowns at the script.
“I decided not to ask,” John said, “because it seems that we’re going to be flatmates, and I’ve lived with other blokes often enough to know that sometimes it’s better just to ignore things. But this is…” John raised his hand and touched his own throat. “This is a bit too odd to ignore, so I’m just going to ask. I’m sure there’s a perfectly reasonable explanation anyway. Why did you kiss me?”
“I’m not worried about the sex,” John said and then bit his lip.
How the hell did he think he’d survive this?
He can’t get his hand on his dick without falling half-way onto his face, but John doesn’t let go, and John doesn’t stop, and everything’s going to be alright.
Sherlock goes to the kitchen and sits down in a chair, but it turns out John wants him on the table. Apparently the light is better there. He can’t keep up with what John is doing to him, because he’s too busy looking at John. John’s fingers are on his face, which is good. John’s eyes are the same. Sherlock has seen a lot of eyes, has peered into the eyes of bodies in the morgue, but he has never seen eyes as fascinating as John’s. It’s incredible. A miracle. Maybe he’s in love…
“You would be great if you tried.”
“Let’s take five,” Greg says and goes to pat John on the shoulder.
John bit his lip. “This really wasn’t my idea.”
“You’re kind of sitting on me,” John Watson pointed out.
John opens his mouth and closes it.
When they’re finally finished for the day, he goes to take a shower and fights the urge to just sit down on the floor and stay there, the water falling on him. A goddamn
you,” John says and places his right hand on the back of Sherlock’s neck, then slides it up to Sherlock’s hair. He’s not sure if he’s trying to pet Sherlock or push his face against the mattress. “Sorry.”
John shifts on the sofa.
“The Germans were coming,” Sherlock said. “And you know I hate speaking in German. It gives me a headache.”
“I don’t
“No.”
“Maybe in Norway, then.”
John grabbed the armrests and leaned back. “I don’t think it’s a good idea.”
“Are you asking –“
, you wouldn’t have… you were just… you weren’t trying to… you wouldn’t have drunk
“I don’t
.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
He wouldn’t. He never has.
And then John grabs him hard and holds him still and comes inside him, and John is wearing a condom but if he wasn’t, his semen would be filling Sherlock’s anus now, and dripping out, because it can’t possibly stay all in, even though John is, John is still in, John is breathing hard against Sherlock’s neck and then slowly, slowly lets go and pulls out.
“I wanted to,” Sherlock says, “but you had got
“John –“
“You’d like that.”
John waits until the door closes after Mycroft. Then he opens his mouth and closes it again. He brought salad. Not that Sherlock’s going to eat it, of course, but he has to try. He’s a fucking doctor, after all.
"We can at least try."
Sherlock blinked a few times, slowly at first. He seemed to slowly be coming out of it. "John...?"
John looked away.
It didn't seem to help stop the reason of Sherlock's plight, but he succumbed to rest anyway.
Sherlock was quiet for a long moment. "... John...?"
"J-John...?" Sherlock mumbled as he glanced at John. "She's... not dead, is she...?"
"Then where do we go? We can't return to Baker Street."
He didn't want to think of that.
John smiled as he continued the hug.
"Cute, denial! So, anyway, why are you here? Did you come to see Sherlock?"
"What? No, that's impossible."
"He's toying with him..."
"He has no reason to lie about a plan like that." Sherlock replied.
Sherlock shrugged it off. There was a knock at the door, and Sherlock did little more than glance.
Maybe if he kept bragging about Sherlock, Moriarty would be frustrated at the prospect of being unable to change his mind.
"But so is Sherlock. Thanks to me, of course~. - JMx"
But he had to try for Sherlock's sake.
"If you're not really here, though, you shouldn't be able to do anything to me..." With this, Sherlock stepped forward, however hesitantly.
"It's for your own safety, John."
"That may be but he was better than you."
"What do you want?"
He slowly shook his head. "N-nothing, I..." After a brief silent pause, he suddenly pulled John close and held him tightly.
Still, the thought didn't comfort him very much.
"YOUR HAT IS FUNNY!", "HOW SHORT COULD A WOMAN BE?!", and insanely happy giggling were among the things that came from his mouth as he staggered around like someone on drugs would.
The quicker he was able to do something to save Sherlock, the better.
"Are you alright?"
Watson looked away. "Yes..."
"It's none of your damned business."
"Can I, now?" Moriarty smirked.
"I can change that." Sherlock reached for the knife, but then froze for a moment and shook his head. He cleared his throat before picking up the knife and putting it into his pocket. "Let's get out of here, then. Before I do something stupid."
"There's the Sherlock I know."
"Not the Sherlock Holmes I know. The Sherlock I know would think of a way to beat him."
"Stop being so stubborn. There's only so much I can help with."
John looked like a child sleeping there.
He started to blush again.
John kissed him back.
"I can't..." Vague pain was in the Consulting Detective's words.
Sherlock tried to shake his head of the voice of his current nemesis, but to no avail. "What...?"
"Hey, these are my men, and I'll order them around!"
There had been cases in the past that Moriarty seemed to orchestrate that Sherlock had bested. But perhaps they were made to be solved. Sherlock had almost beaten Moriarty a few times during this case, but was there anything concrete to use against him? Moriarty could just argue that every near-catch was intentional.
The limo pulled to a stop, and with that, Sherlock's smile disappeared. "Well, let's go visit the Queen." He said, insulting his brother.
The Consulting Detective remained unconscious on the bed.
"I know about that, Sherlock. You still insist on keeping things from me."
He wished he knew where he went off to.
John smiled back at him.
The culprit revealed his face, a look of complete madness plastered on. "Which one of us are you talking to?"
"Come on, then! Don't give me hollow threats, John. Give me the gun, or shoot me. Those are your options."
"Of course it didn't."
But he knew it couldn't happen.
The door slammed open. Inside stood Magnussen, covered in blood. "Hello, Doctor Watson."
"Worst of all, perhaps, is I think this may make his first time. This is going to leave some emotional scarring, most likely... My brother has a hard time letting go of things like this, which is understandable."
He paid the cabbie and got out.
John sighed in defeat as he looked down.
"It's quite alright, Sherlock."
He began to worry more.
"I told you not to call him a freak!"
"Well, I'm useless until I can walk again."
Soon they got to the apartment the inspector had set up for John.
"I choose John."
Sherlock's face lit up. "Magnussen." He greeted. "It's Sherlock. Listen, I never thought I'd say this, especially not to you, but... I need some help."
"Donovan, I thought I made myself clear."
"Yes please, nurse."
"It's both or none, Jim." Sherlock said. "You kill him, you'll have to kill me."
"... Uh, John?"
you he would-...!"
"Who do you think YOU are, MISTER?" Sherlock slurred at him as he approached.
"I choose J-"
"He is. Barely."
"Yes, Mycroft."
"I certainly didn't want you throwing your life away trying to avenge me."
John hoped he would help.
"I'm not going alone..."
The doctor understood and left to pass along the request.
"So you remember now?"
"I'm aware," he admitted. "So why did you call me now? Do you want revenge on me?"
Sherlock and John went to Lestrade, who turned to look at them.
Sherlock didn't understand. "Excuse me?"
"No, why?"
..." The name was a whisper past Sherlock's lips, barely audible and seemingly unintentional.
"Agreed."
"You'll see."
A look of distress appeared on Sherlock's face as he looked up at John. "You mean... you can't hear him...?"
"The only way is for me to allow him to drag me with him to Hell or wherever he ends up."
"I'm just fine..."
"That's not it!" Sherlock insisted. "If that sniper dies, so does everyone else!"
As Moriarty struggled to almost comically "untangle" himself without falling down the rest of the stairs, Sherlock stepped closer to John, but didn't say anything.
"How so?"
"Why?"
He sighed a bit.
He told him the location.
"Now, are you going to let me do this, or do you still intend on waiting?"
He was all alone.
"Where is Sherlock?!"
William Morris Way was almost halfway across London from where he was at the moment, however.
"It's psychosomatic." He replied.
clever!"
"But our landlady is in danger at the hospital!"
"True. I could just let Lestrade take him in and let that be the end of it. But where's the fun in that?"
John sighed as he sat on the couch.
"I... I suppose so." Sherlock mumbled.
He shrugged and hugged him anyway.
"He... He coerced me into it..."
Sherlock didn't flinch this time. His quivering slowly began to cease, and he was starting to look a tad angry.
John continued to sleep.
"Then do the correct thing."
... If Sherlock was able to respond.
"It was you who fired the gun; not I." he grinned.
He soon let him go. "Sorry."
"Sherlock never listens to anyone." Lestrade thought for a moment. "But, you know, he did inflict his own wounds upon himself, so..." He seemed very concerned now, as though it had occurred to him that perhaps Sherlock was suicidal at this point and had escaped to find a way to end it all.
John blushed more.
"Like what?"
Looking and sounding troubled and stressed, Sherlock replied, "No... No, John, n-... N-nothing's wrong. Go back to sleep."
Soon his wound stopped bleeding.
He could feel himself beginning to wake up.
And he even met someone: the nurse that helped to walk again, a blonde-haired woman named Mary.
"I don't know..."
"Aww, how sweet," Moriarty cooed sarcastically.
"Is that all?"
"I'm not backing out now, Sherlock. Someone has to keep an eye on you." John smirked.
He hadn't really thought the day would come where he'd miss Sherlock's antics, like how he used to shoot holes in the walls.
"... I... I'm alright." It sounded fake, and still the Consulting Detective wouldn't eat.
"Inspector, I need an ambulance here. Mrs. Hudson was attacked!"
"But..."
Sherlock kept his eye on them.
"I can't really blame him. He's in a difficult situation. I should've been watching him more carefully."
"You nearly killed Mycroft."
She nodded.
Sherlock looked at John questioningly, wondering quietly if the call was for him.
"Moriarty, you brainwashed him!"
"No. Either it isn't a cipher or the killer decided he didn't want it to be seen after he had written it." Everything Sherlock was saying was a blatant lie. It almost seemed like he was trying to lead Lestrade as far away from the killer as possible.
But what could he do?
"Now you just hurt yourself, Sherlock."
"What the bloody hell are you talking about, Mycroft?"
He just had to find out who.
'This isn't fair...' he thought.
"Is it that good?"
He tried to trip him again.
"Oh, come now. You can't keep the truth from him."
"Well, that didn't go quite as planned."
Sherlock turned around and huffed. He almost appeared to be sad.
"Hello?" said Lestrade when he answered the call after a few rings.
Sherlock stopped in his tracks. "Oh, what if it's under her nails, too? Dammit! I should've cleaned her nails while we were in there. How clumsy of me to forget about her nails!" It almost sounded like he didn't want the killer to get caught... or worse and more unbelievable yet, like maybe he was the killer.
John smiled a bit.
"I don't think you're crazy, Sherlock."
"Are you alright, Sherlock?" he asked.
John gritted his teeth and ran over; hitting the guard in the back of the leg and over the head with his cane.
Soon an ambulance arrived.
He couldn't help but be slightly curious as to why Sherlock was so determined to see him.
His head down, Sherlock stepped forward and clutched the edges of the sink. He felt laughter beginning to bubble up inside him, and soon found himself laughing hysterically, his knuckles white from gripping the sink so hard while his body quivered.
Sherlock didn't seem to care. He simply began kissing a little deeper.
Magnussen gestured for John to sit on another couch across from them.
"Or I'll..." It was at this point that Sherlock realized he had nothing to continue this threat with, for he knew of exactly zero weaknesses of the man in front of him. "Or I'll... scream..."
Sherlock was comfortable like this.
John wheeled himself in the wheelchair.
"Like who?"
Moriarty stepped out as he got close. "Ah, Doctor Watson! Glad you could join us. Come in, come in."
"Were you able to get hold of Mycroft?"
"I'm fine."
"We need to go to the hospital!"
The Consulting Detective found a knife in the drawer and glanced back at John.
." Sherlock replied in a low voice.
He ignored him and went to tend to Sherlock.
"In return? Well, you've got the means, and I've got the methods."
"John..."
John backed away; trying to make sense of all this.
John stayed away from the window.
As they made it to the main road and Sherlock hailed a taxi, he said, "You do have a small choice to make, though, John: are you going to return to Baker Street, or are you going to follow me? I would highly recommend the former, seeing as the latter could be
They started to walk together, and Sherlock seemed almost happy.
" He said drastically, and John remembered he'd heard two gunshots, while it looked like Sherlock only had one injury and the guard had never emerged from the Staff Only area.
But that would mean no one will ever hear from Sherlock ever again as well. This brought tears to the doctor's eyes.
"I've... already almost hurt you..."
"It's quite alright, Sherlock."
"An antique? I suppose I can see the sense in Mycroft being interested in antiques. However, I'm not sure he'll take it in exchange for help."
Perhaps he could annoy him with backhanded compliments, like saying how difficult a case was, but how easily Sherlock had bested it. Or how Sherlock had come so close so many times to besting this one. But it seemed like that would only annoy Moriarty at best.
"They're both dead..."
"Sherlock, what's wrong?" cried John as he rushed to him.
The photo is different to the video, though both are of the same content - John, sat in front of a field hospital window, gazing out at the torrential rain with a faintly wistful smile on his face. It's blurry if you look closely and he's in the middle of blinking so it looks a little funny. He's in surgery clothes, fresh out of six-hour operation to patch up somebody's legs and torso - he remembers it, remembers the exhaustion and the sense of guilty victory that comes with lives saved but limbs lost.
"How does he do it," Sherlock whispers.
Sherlock glances over at him again, for longer this time, and then immediately looks as though he's having to try very hard not to laugh. John abruptly discovers that not only has he just held part of a conversation with spectacular bedhead (how does that even
Mycroft allows.
"- and you nor Harry have ever managed it since, not that she has the trust issues you do, so she's probably been able to once or twice, whereas you -"
"You really are fantastic company when you first wake up," Sherlock remarks.
Sherlock goes for it. Bastard. "John, you can't -"
"Nope."
John has added to it since, stacks of photographs of his childhood and his youth and his army days all jumbled together in a poor sense of chronological order. The gaps in-between are scattered with USB drives labelled carefully with pieces of yellowing masking tape.
Oh, God,
Sherlock looks summarily disappointed. "Dull. I almost thought you'd solved the case."
Another shrug, this one accompanied by a cough. Sherlock's shouting falters for a moment and then enjoys a strong resurgence. John doesn't mention the coughing fit, so Lestrade doesn't bring it up either. The blue tint to his lips has faded under the warmth of two coats (apparently he'd had the foresight to take his off), but Lestrade shucks off his jacket and throws it over John's chest anyway. He thinks back to the first text.
Nothing.
"Seems you already know the most of it," John snorts. His voice is groggy, but firm. "Also, no. Bugger'ff."
The last sentence comes complete with a semi-amused side-eyeing of Sherlock, whose relentless pacing has slowly begun to peter out. At some point, the background shouting had tempered itself down into mutterings. Now, even that stops completely, and he straightens and faces Lestrade. His tone, when he speaks loudly again, is harsh and almost biting.
John's hands twitch, losing the mug he's washing to the suds. He scowls at his phone as he scoops up a tea towel, and then realises Sherlock is laughing at him and turns the expression on him instead.
Sherlock is laughing. He looks a little surprised, like he hadn't expected to; taken off-guard. John can't help but join in.
"Sherlock, what -"
Given the laughter, John guesses it's not the latter. "Shut up," he grumbles, rubbing his eyes. "Don't mock me, I just -"
Harry gives a theatrical gasp.
He thinks about the hundreds of other tiny things he's stored away as a kid, thinks of the conversation with Mummy he'd had where she promised,
"It's an abbreviation.
John gapes at him. Such an avalanche of sentiment is supposed to be incapacitating to Sherlock, not
"At least, the hypocrite." John rearranges the various coats tighter around himself, smiles. "Came around to it as he pulled me out of the water. I think he only stopped for breath when he went to ask about nicking a chair from the café and bought me tea." He raises his to-go cup in a cheerful toast to Sherlock's unexpected generosity.
"No, I can't."
"I won't, Sherlock."
John prayed for his safety.
"I'll be sure to give you a hint once I decide where I'm taking him. No promises that I won't lie though."
"Who's after us? Moriarty? That pervert? Or Mycroft for almost getting him killed?"
"I'll take it down to Donovan. Don't touch anything; this entire flat's a crime scene now."
It was bittersweet, hearing Sherlock's playing again. With a sigh, however, Sherlock abruptly stopped playing; this was jarring, but still not necessarily unusual.
He breathed a sigh of relief and laid back down next to him.
"Sh-Sherlock..."
"How did he react?"
In spite of him, Moriarty kept chuckling. "You hit like a girl," he sung. "Is that the best you've got?"
"Tsk, tsk, tsk. I have no intention of getting arrested, I just want the heat on me. I want to fool them into thinking it's me so that the real killer will show himself to me. That shouldn't be
"I haven't a clue to what you're talking about."
Sherlock would occasionally twitch and groan as he did this.
"I'll trust that..."
He sighed as he left the flat.
"It breaks my heart how even now, while he is so vulnerable, you would still keep up the facade." Moriarty said, feigned sadness in his voice. "Who do you trust more, Sherlock?"
It was quiet.
"I'm fine..." He lied.
"Nowhere, Sherlock." Moriarty said, staring at John with a dark smirk on his face. "You haven't heard it before, I don't think."
"But what?"
"We could if you want to."
John's face paled as he began to worry about their landlady even more.
"Good."
He took a deep breath as he picked a building and went in.
"What has he ever do to you?"
"You are a sick fiend!"
John grumbled and answered it.
Sherlock held him tighter.
, do you John?"
"Bring me back to my room. Now."
"You seem flushed, is all."
Sherlock blinked, but didn't dare move other than that.
"Hello, Doctor Watson." Magnussen said as he entered.
"Oh, I... I'm sorry, I didn't realize how close the bed was..." Sherlock chuckled nervously as he tried to get back up.
"I'm here, Sherlock."
"Why not?"
"He is not a freak!"
"Off how?"
"I hope so."
Sherlock's brow furrowed as he realized that he was, and that he should probably be concerned, but found himself unable to be. "I just want to keep you safe. Let me do that."
Sherlock took a long moment to gaze at John before he lowered his head again. "That was really dangerous and stupid of you. But... thank you, John."
Sherlock heard clapping, and he looked up to see Moriarty approaching, dressed casually now.
"I believe so."
John told him what was happening.
Moriarty shrugged. "So be it, then. Oh,
"Sherlock--" Mycroft started.
"So if I go to the subway and bring attention to myself, our killer's accomplice will notice me. Then I can get the information I need out of him."
He wished he could bring him back to his old self mentally.
"Easy, Sherlock."
"I don't know the answer."
"Oh thank god!" he texted back.
"Y-yes, I'm fine, but you're not, Sherlock."
"John..."
"The victim in question is..." Sherlock stopped and blinked for a moment. "Never mind. Let's not keep Lestrade waiting for too long when he gets there. Come along." The Consulting Detective turned around and started walking to leave the flat.
"Fine. I'll succumb to rest, but just this once." It was hard to tell, but it almost seemed like Sherlock was light-heartedly teasing when he said that.
"Yes, Sherlock?"
The tears began to flow again. God, he missed that crazy man.
" Sherlock cried out as Moriarty laughed.
"Indeed you are, Sherly." Moriarty smirked.
' John thought as he listened.
He tried to get him to calm him down.
John gently grabbed him and shook him. "Sherlock, snap out of it! Please!"
"I hope I am as well."
Again, Sherlock looked away. "Well, I've... I mean, I've... never been handled that way before." He cleared his throat awkwardly. "Never been... touched... like that before..."
After all, genuises tend to have big egos and hate to be annoyed and belittled.
"I still do, Sherlock, and I always will."
"Yeah."
"I don't know."
"All the better; we'll have the hospital take care of her." was Sherlock's response before he pulled out his phone. He was about to call Lestrade, but instead, he tossed his phone to John. "Make the call. I need to check something."
They could hear Moriarty giggling in the interrogation room.
He curled up; starting to cry and wishing that Sherlock was with him.
"Why is he here? Is he a client?" The taller man casually turned his back on John and paced toward the fireplace.
"Moriarty and Magnussen."
He soon came out after washing his hands.
Watson sat down and nursed his sore hand.
He sat down on it and winced.
"He didn't even remember stabbing himself..."
So he dialed on the hospital phone and called him.
"Yes... New evidence
"Magnussen, Sherlock? Really? You want him here, don't you?"
"Are you sure?"
"Be safe, Sherlock."
"Hold onto that radio. I'm going after her." Lestrade said rushedly as he ran out.
Sherlock sighed and tried to stand, only to collapse back to the floor. It was at this point that he realized he was bleeding. Perhaps the blood that coated him was his own...?
He looked alarmed by the idea.
"We must find this fiend and soon, Sherlock!"
"Hello."
Watson stayed in the other room.
"Good lord, Sherlock, you really did a number on him." The villain said.
"I think that's the point Moriarty was making too."
"I see. Anything else?"
Sherlock walked over and saw Molly's body. Being used to scenes like this, he didn't flinch or anything, though he almost seemed saddened, which was rather uncharacteristic for the consulting detective, albeit being a tad human.
Lost in his own thoughts, Sherlock didn't really notice.
But was he, really? Given that Sherlock was now unstable, and had warned him that he himself was dangerous... not to mention, he had got an ambulance to arrive as quickly as he could.
But what if his mind was too far gone?
"Ooh, someone's brave~."
Oh dear, I've said too much, haven't I... Oh well~!"
"Oh, how I worry for you. Ha ha!"
He continued to pet him until he passed out.
"There's got to be another way to get his attention."
He growled and got into the taxi.
Sherlock stepped closer, staring down at his colleague.
"The doctors have been doing all they can for him..."
He wondered what was going on in there.
"I'll figure out who he is, don't worry about that."
"Mr. Holmes is conscious. We don't know for how long, though..."
Watson got out and limped to the building.
Sherlock almost seemed to hold onto him tighter.
"If that's the case then we'll come up with a plan to stop him."
"I'm not like you... I... wasn't the one who pulled the trigger. I couldn't have been. It wasn't me!
Sherlock cringed.
John prayed for Sherlock's safety.
"And who would that be, Doctor?"
He gently held his hand.
The owner of the restaurant returned shortly with a plate of fish and chips for John. "This and the champagne are on the house, boys." He said, revealing a bottle of champagne.
"Are you alright, Sherlock?" asked John.
He looked over at him.
"Better, at least..."
It grumbled more, trying to remind Sherlock that he hadn't eaten for a few days now. Still, he only rolled his eyes at it.
"Please don't die, Sherlock..." he said as he continued to try his best to save him.
"I'm still taking you into custody."
The detective started to sound almost panicked, and he thrashed his head about once or twice every five or so seconds.
for a
With a slight huff, Sherlock stood and resumed pacing.
He sighed a bit.
He clung onto Sherlock's scarf more as he started to cry again. Soon he was back to his big empty home as he went straight to bed.
John felt ashamed. He just wanted to protect them and now he put everyone at risk.
"That Sherlock Holmes was a sentimental moron."
"I did no such thing, John! I... I mean, how could I have? I was out looking for Magnussen this whole time!" However, even Sherlock seemed uncertain of himself. The texts had likely violated one of his deduction rules and were causing his mind to presume that he was in fact the true culprit, though he kept insisting that was false.
Sherlock nodded.
"You can say that again." With that, Donovan presumably let go of her radio, probably trying to apprehend Sherlock.
"But what, Sherlock?"
Sherlock's pale face flushed once more. He'd had the haunting suspicion that was the case, but he had dismissed it as being stupid to think John liked him at all. Now that he knew it wasn't so stupid after all, he was stunned into silent admiration. He simply stared at John with wide eyes, his lips parted slightly, not saying a word.
There was a pause before Sherlock said, "Out."
John smiled a bit as well.
Moriarty stood, frowning, and kicked Sherlock once for good measure, making the detective's body twitch.
"Because I'd like to watch Sherlock's world collapse around him."
"Then let's get out of here to somewhere he can easily take his 'prize'."
Sherlock truly did seem adamant about trying to talk Moriarty down, but was it even possible?
As one stopped for him, he got another text.
"Don't do it, Sherlock..."
"... I won't hurt you." He repeated.
Sherlock didn't seem to remember anything, but he did mumble, "That does sound interesting... A killer is trying to frame me? Very clever on their part."
So he wheeled over to a nurse and asked her.
He was surprised but kissed back.
"I give you my word, Sherlock."
"I'm worried about you all the time, Sherlock."
"I didn't tell him." Sherlock replied to the glance calmly. "He deduced it himself."
Sherlock was now quiet. He kept his eyes averted from John, worried he may be receiving a concerned or even upset gaze from the older man.
After a few seconds, Sherlock broke the kiss.
Finally, Sherlock turned and glanced at him. "You seem happier than usual."
"Don't lie to me like you have been. He was here. He told me about you and him."
John didn't say anything to counter; he knew he lost as he hung his head at the thought of losing the greatest friend he'd ever had.
John smiled back.
"J-John...!" The tone of Sherlock's voice showed surprise, confusion, and scolding, all at once.
John laid the blanket on him the best he could in his condition.
Sherlock took another sip of champagne.
Another awkward silence filled the air around them as they waited.
Magnussen smirked and indiscreetly reached out his hand, putting it on top of Sherlock's. He didn't seem too fazed when Sherlock moved his hand away in apparent disgust.
"Yes, I know, but he needs to pay now."
"You were the only one who never did..."
"He does, Sherlock?"
"Go on." Sherlock insisted. "Put a bullet in me--"--he tapped his forehead--"--right here."
Sherlock stepped closer.
"He wants to know how to use the dirt he has on people. I know how he can. He wants me in part for that."
"John, don't!"
"He's always had free reign, John." Sherlock griped.
Sherlock paced back and forth until, when he turned, he suddenly saw Magnussen standing in front of him and gasped.
John just laid there; staying on one side of the bed.
"I should be able to restrain myself, though..."
Moriarty suddenly revealed a gun, aiming it at the good doctor. Seeing this, Sherlock also pulled out a gun.
The detective watched him sleep.
Sherlock tried to act natural, despite the fresh blood on his hands and clothes.
"I don't remember." He lied, clearly not wanting to repeat what had been told.
"... Honestly, yes."
He really hoped nothing went wrong.
"You're alright, Sherlock..."
This surprised the good doctor.
That last picture made John pissed. He ripped out his IVs and went out the door.
Sherlock adjusted his scarf as he continued to cough. "Wh-what was that for?" He choked out.
"Yes, Sherlock...?"
"Sherlock, please answer me..."
"I need to leave... M-Magnussen might show up; I can't be here when that happens..."
John was still sleeping.
Sherlock looked down at the food in front of him and seemed to contemplate eating it for a moment.
"Welcome, Mr. Holmes." greeted the man as he stepped closer to Sherlock, who took half a pace back. The man reached out, presumably for a handshake, but upon giving the man his hand, Sherlock was surprised to have his hand kissed the way one would greet a woman of great beauty.
"I don't know. I want to say no, but I think, deep down, part of me says yes."
John nodded and helped him out.
Sherlock looked away.
"It's me John Watson."
"I thought you wanted to clash smarts against him, not do this poor taste plan slop."
Sherlock had made a call to him just before going in to talk to Moriarty one last time.
"I don't think I do."
Sherlock kept his eye on him.
It took an hour for the room's phone to ring.
He quickly looked at his phone.
"Be careful. He and Moriarty are going to try to break him."
"I'm not going."
us, Sherlock."
"If you're done, you can leave my room."
Sherlock turned over again, draping his arm over John's chest.
Sherlock slowly turned to see Mycroft sitting in a chair halfway across the room, looking at them.
"Did I..." He cleared his throat. "Did I scare you back there...?"
John carefully followed him.
"And mine is a really old pocket-watch."
And now he would never hear it again...
Moriarty only laughed. "I'm looking forward to seeing whatever pitiful attempt you'll give. Don't keep me waiting too long."
"You have stuff to treat this on your person...?" Sherlock asked absent-mindedly with a small smirk.
He started to get worried about Sherlock.
"He won't help."
"Aagh, I just can't believe I made such a big mistake! I think I just got the Old Maid, John. I can't win this game the killer is playing with me now, because I've
"What kind of knowledge?"
"Jo...hn..."
They ended up in front of a restaurant. "The owner here owes me a favor." Sherlock said.
Sherlock put his head in his hands and nodded slowly.
"I have to apologize for the poor behavior of Sherlock Holmes. He's still adjusting, that's all."
"Inspector, he's gone..."
"Come now. Would I really call you out here to talk to a cop?"
"I'm just peachy." Again, he replied too quickly, all the while not making eye contact with John.
"Oh, don't get sappy, Sherlock."
"To tease you!"
He seemed to be alone.
"It isn't. You're slouching right now because of an obvious back ache." Sherlock announced, showing that he may have purged most things from his mind, but he was still able to quickly deduce things. "Your joints are rigid and you're in discomfort; you can hardly even sleep. If you're so concerned about me, then we can share the b-" Sherlock caught himself with a look of discomfort on his face. "... Sorry, I got caught up in the moment."
So Watson called them all to warn them.
"Listen," Sherlock said calmly, "I'm done playing games with you. They're boring now."
"Oh, come on. Follow me, Sherlock. You're clever.
"I doubt it. I seemed to stop you."
If he could just find Sherlock's phone...
"... Yes? That's why I'm asking you what it is that we do, John."
"Thank you."
"Well, clearly, getting me help is not possible..."
He found Sherlock to be laying down, conscious but in an obvious daze. He was very pale, and was connected to an IV drip.
"While I don't necessarily approve of your method," Sherlock murmured, "it did get rid of him quickly and with minimal damage." Then, looking away, he conceded, "Not half bad, John."
"This will work out in your favor." He said in a grim, solemn tone.
"Yes, it's real, Sherlock."
Sherlock smiled, but his face seemed rather bittersweet. "Goodbye, John."
"Jesus, I could understand if it did..."
John sat down next to him.
"Oh, speak of the devil..." Lestrade mumbled as Mycroft stepped in.
"That can't be all he wants. It doesn't make any sense. There must be something I'm not understanding."
"In other words, tricked the great Sherlock Holmes."
"He left a mark on my neck..." was all Sherlock said.
"John!" Mary called after him, but she didn't try to stop him beyond that.
After a couple tense minutes of silence, the door suddenly opened from the inside, and out stepped Sherlock. His messy hair was messier than before, he looked pale, and he had some blood on his face and the collar of his white dress shirt. He popped his collar up casually as the door closed behind him.
"It's for you, Sherlock." he said as he handed him the phone.
Sherlock nodded, then started heading for the interrogation room.
He shrugged weakly.
"Get some sleep, John."
He narrowed his eyes at John, but more in a surprised way than as if he were offended, like he was taken aback by the accusation.
As Moriarty stood, Sherlock's pale eyes looked John over from head to toe, as if inspecting him and trying to deduce things about him. Suddenly, his eyes widened, and he lowered his gun.
"Sherlock, this is
However, when Mary caught sight of him a little later in the day, she seemed concerned by him, as if she knew him. Without a word, the man then left and approached his limousine outside.
The criminal hung up and walked over to them. "How cute. I almost feel bad for this." He said sarcastically as he aimed his gun at Sherlock's head.
Kissy-kissy warning. It's not smut, I swear.
"You mean he's a target as well?!"
"Sherlock!"
John sighed and continued walking with him.
"Well, that's for you to find out, Sherl." The crook purred.
Magnussen held this hand up as if it were belonging to a woman of royalty, but proceeded to kiss it deeply with an obvious level of lust.
"Now this is getting really pitiful. I think we've broken poor little Sherlock Holmes... He's blubbering like a baby."
"Go see what it was!"
"Damn it..."
Sherlock belt out a cry before he threw the psychologist aside and clutched his own head. "I can't... I won't...! John, help me...!! You're a coward, Sherlock. It's not too-- SHUT UP!! JOHN!!"
The Consulting Detective still had his ears covered.
"Wait, I think I see him." Donovan continued, not paying any mind to John's rebuttal.
It wasn't long before they were able to stop running.
Sherlock left, as he walked down the halls, he text John the address to a small cafe near Baker Street.
That didn't help him feel any better.
He texted. "What do you want?"
"And I haven't left you, John. I'm just not able to be by your side anymore."
Perhaps, if he could somehow manage it, he could trick Mycroft into helping him.
He was then forced to wait for about ten minutes before he got a call from Mycroft.
Sherlock took his attention off of the sky and instead gazed at John.
He listened closer, but the whispers seem to be coming from everywhere and nowhere at the same time. They began hushed-ly saying other things, reminding him of his experience with Magnussen for one.
"Don't you believe me?"
"You're welcome, Sherlock."
"And?"
John didn't notice.
The people in the ambulance ignored this, as they didn't know what it meant.
He relaxed a bit.
"Oh, I think I can."
"Why so many?!" Lestrade asked.
It was hard to tell, but Sherlock seemed a little bit worried that Moriarty was right.
But what could his possibly be?
John smiled as he chuckled happily.
He looked around a bit more.
"Me too."
"Well, I've got a partner... To keep John safe from him, you're going to have to live by his rules."
He relaxed more.
, Sherlock?" Moriarty asked quizzically. "Don't shoot your beloved doctor? Because you know that's what I intend to do in the long run anyway."
"Of course I am. You were stuck in a bad flashback, Sherlock."
John gently held him up.
She helped him into the wheelchair and started taking him to Sherlock's room.
He heard Sherlock gasp across the room. "John!" The Consulting Detective rushed to John's side. He was covered in blood, and he ran his iron-smelling blood-covered hand across John's cheek. "John... Oh, you're awake... I brought us home...!" He sounded both desperate and crazed as he said this.
"... Any chance you might know where they are right now?"
"Who?" asked Sherlock.
"Well she wasn't to me at least."
"John? Why the new number?"
I'm not too pleased with this formatting anymore, but here's another chapter for anyone who does happen to enjoy our little roleplay.
"Get the Inspector NOW!!" John yelled.
"Wait, you wanted me to move on?"
"What are you talking about?"
"I'm fine, John." He replied, however a tad too quickly.
“Yeah,” John said, clearing his throat. “John Watson. I just… I made an appointment for you. In the sickbay. You didn’t come.”
“You’re so responsive,” John said. “It’s…”
“You can take the bathroom,” John says and walks away from the kitchen backwards, hits his shoulder against the doorframe on his way. “Sleep on the sofa. You might have a concussion, I can’t let you go, but… Can you just… I need to go.”
“You even like it when they talk to you.”
“John,” Sherlock says, when John drags him onto his feet and walks into the bedroom. They’re still kissing. They are really kissing now. Sherlock’s mouth tastes of blood when he kisses John back. “This is a bad idea,” Sherlock says, hands wrapped around John’s shoulders.
He doesn’t say anything. John pats him on the knee, says good night and leaves.
“It was fine,” John said, trying to breathe. He was sitting in his armchair, because his legs didn’t feel steady at the moment. He was still out of breath and his skin was tingling and he really, really wanted to kiss Sherlock again.
“What do you mean, nothing?”
Sherlock sighed as loudly as he could, which wasn’t very loud, because his throat was dry after sleeping for… well, he didn’t know for how long exactly he had slept. “I didn’t mean
“I’m right here,” Sherlock says. “Also, you’re stepping on my toes.”
Then again, he hadn’t dated men either, not until he had met Sherlock.
“Is there by any chance a war happening on English soil at the moment?”
“Quite a lot,” Sherlock said, “you’re a human. John, I’m going to ejaculate. Did you want me to talk or can I just –“
“It’s just you.”
“You don’t have to,” Sherlock said and stood up from the floor. John flinched, and Sherlock froze. “Sorry.”
Sherlock takes a deep breath. “You’re going to leave me eventually. It’s inevitable. In one way or another, you’re going to leave me. But I’d estimate that you’re going to leave me during the next six months. Four, if I have underestimated your intellectual capacity.”
“Yes,” Sherlock said. “A perfectly fine coffin that I purchased from a professional carpenter in Italy in the fifteenth century.”
things like that to me,” John says, almost whispering. “Because if you say something like that, I’m not going to forget it, and it’s going to keep ringing in my head, and I can’t…”
John nodded. Sherlock mentioned foxes sometimes. John had a theory that maybe foxes were the subject Sherlock was studying.
“Yes,” he said. “London?”
John’s hands dragging him into the flat, gentle but efficient, apologizingly forward, incredibly familiar, and he doesn’t know why he can’t breathe. Maybe it’s the broken ribs, maybe it’s John.
“…no?”
John stares at him.
The dislocated shoulder hurts like hell. It hurts more when John puts it back into place. Mary is there that night, sits on the sofa and looks at Sherlock when John is finished and tells Sherlock to go. Maybe Mary pities him. Maybe that’s what the look in her eyes is about.
, is a story about two people, who get something good they didn’t expect and that’s why it takes them some time to realise what they have. And I really hope people are going to like it, but whatever happens, we did a good job with it. And filming it was very nice. We were in this tiny village Cornwall, and it was
Sherlock could ask John not to. He
“Why the hell would I stop you?”
“Yeah,” Sherlock said, sounding as if he meant it.
. He shrugs the shirt off his shoulders and hangs it on the back of a chair. Then he digs his fingers under the loose shreds of skin on his chest and pulls.
John smiled again and snuggled him.
"We had a deal." Moriarty replied. "Him for you."
"But you need your sleep."
"We have to at least try, Sherlock."
There had to be something he was missing. Sherlock rarely acted on sentiment. There had to be some sort of logic in his actions, and he doubted that Sherlock would find suicide to rank very high in "logic". He was missing something... right?
" He moaned. He said something else, but it couldn't be heard from where John was.
"Why did you do that?"
He quickly went to him. "
Despite the wound on his stomach hurting, he quickly made it outside. The next step was to find a taxi.
He helped him sit down and handed him his breakfast.
John gulped before slowly walking into the apartment.
John hurried inside as well.
"I will and that's a promise, Sherlock."
There wasn't much he could do but get ahold of Mycroft again.
"Go on, Sherlock. What are you waiting f--" Before Moriarty could finish, Sherlock, without turning his face from John, aimed behind him and easily shot him in the head. Moriarty's corpse slumped to the ground. Magnussen didn't seem surprised or even startled, as he simply continued to sit on the couch.
"Sweet dreams, Sherlock."
John blushed but still held him.
Moriarty did in fact stop, and he immediately began laughing. "Oh, you two are so precious. Don't worry, dear doctor, I'm not going to kill him. He's too pathetic to kill. I'm just going to scramble his oh-so-great brain a little. I want to see if he can rebuild from nothing." He leaned closer to Sherlock. "Do you hear that, Sherlock? You're pathetic. You're pathetic, you're boring, you're a burden to everyone, and last but certainly not least, you're
The most he could hope for at this point was that Sherlock would wake up and still remember him. But even in the event of that sort of situation, Sherlock would be arrested and taken away from him regardless.
"But you're covered in blood..."
John began to wake up.
"Goodnight, John..."
..." He whispered again.
He looked around him.
John blushed a bit at this.
The kiss broken again, Sherlock chuckled a bit as well. "Looks like we
"I don't like this at all..."
did this, didn't you?! I would
"How so?"
He yawned as he sat up. "Are you alright, Sherlock?"
"Why, uh... Why did you kiss me there, anyway?" Sherlock asked innocently enough.
Lestrade helped him stay standing.
In the middle of closing the car door, Sherlock stopped mid-movement and looked up at him.
"Inspector, that's not what she just said to me!" yelled John. "She said that Sherlock somehow got the gun away from his attacker and killed him!"
He stared at John with the same expression of near-childlike wonder.
"We have to do something, Sherlock."
"You're my friend..." he said in his sleep.
Moriarty hardly even flinched. "Do you really want an honest answer?"
"Alright, Sherlock."
Sherlock gazed at him with a certain childish wonder.
"Might?"
"John, what...?"
"Then I must have known her, even in passing... The killer was trying to gain my attention..." Sherlock suddenly seemed to reach a small epiphany. "And then he got you involved! My God, he
He had to think of something.
"It's really alright, Sherlock."
The doctor got the detective's answering machine.
"You should go easy on him."
And he had to think of it fast.
"She'll see you today if you want."
"What are you talking about? Sherlock has no silly crush on me!"
"You did your best."
"What happened?"
Watson stopped and looked at him. "What is it?"
"Dinner?"
"Not really, but I'll stand it."
The Consulting Detective gently tried to shake his head clear of pain.
He just couldn't believe that he was gone.
"I said no."
"He might even have contacts within the Embassy."
"Then why are you here?"
He wanted to call Sherlock but decided not to.
When he was wheeled into the room, he found Sherlock staring at the window farthest from the door, mumbling to himself.
As months flew by their love grew as well until John finally proposed to her.
"I'm sorry he's been texting you."
"You're a sick monster, Moriarty!"
"Why?"
If he could somehow prove once and for all that Sherlock was the better of them, then maybe he could break something in Moriarty, or at least fluster him into revealing something.
He couldn't tell John. What if he was scared away?
"I-I..."
"Yes." Sherlock agreed with a scowl on his face. "Yes, I suppose he did, didn't he."
"He's not yours!"
Could he really best Moriarty? Unlike Sherlock, the criminal seemed to have almost no weaknesses.
Sherlock was in danger.
"You never know, Sherlock."
"Wait!"
He didn't even care anymore. He just wanted all of this to be over.
"Oh, my
"Thank you, Inspector."
Mary looked a bit concerned still of Magnussen, even as the limousine drove away, but she smiled for John.
"I need to ice my hand. I didn't know I could hit that hard," John winced.
Sherlock huffed and shook his head as if to clear it. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you like that. I'm just... not myself right now."
And he had to make sure John never finds out what he almost did.
"Wh-what happened...?"
"I wouldn't be able to handle any negative diagnosis right now..."
"No, it's not!"
With that, the bedroom door opened, and Sherlock walked over, fully dressed with his coat and all.
"Moriarty pissed me off when he texted me and I kind of threw my old phone against the wall."
He nodded and helped him.
A couple hours later...
Sherlock stirred somewhat.
John gasped when he saw Moriarty aim the gun at Sherlock and fire, but he got in the way and took the bullet for him.
John stirred a bit.
Sherlock looked through his received messages for a moment, and then with a sigh he put the phone away and resumed shooting the wall.
"There
Sherlock thought for a moment. "A lot has happened recently. I want to say I'm recovering, but I don't think that's entirely true..."
He missed being around Sherlock.
"... Uh... What is it that we normally do?"
"I think that's it, Sherlock."
"Who do you think?" Sherlock's voice hollered back from the living room. Almost immediately after, he heard the Consulting Detective begin playing the violin.
"Don't say that, Sherlock!"
"He's unconscious again now... It doesn't look good."
The kiss was broken again.
"You're afraid of what my answer will be, aren't you?"
"My word!" gasped John.
"He told me why he wanted you, Sherlock. He wants to use you for evil."
"You're flushed, John."
"They're doing the best they can for him, but he's really messed himself up. Do you have any idea why he did this to himself?"
John trembled as he looked over at Sherlock.
Without another word, Sherlock ran back into the interrogation room.
"That was to save his life! He would have died if I didn't!"
John hugged him back.
He couldn't take it anymore and got into the wheelchair.
A broken smile slowly but surely crept its way onto Sherlock's face as his aim remained firm. Looking into his eyes, it was hard to recognize him.
." There was a small pause on Mycroft's end before he continued. "If you value your personal information, do
He downed two pills and put the bottle back, closing the cabinet door. When he looked into the mirror, he saw Moriarty grinning at him instead of his own reflection, and he jumped back in surprise. "You..." He muttered.
, really."
He soon heard Sherlock's phone play its text alert noise.
"Oh, I see..."
"Are you okay now?"
"Alright." John sighed.
"Don't worry about me. Just get yourself better, Sherlock."
"Please tell me you're alright and eat?"
Sherlock suddenly kissed him.
"I need to go. I want you to follow, but lag behind enough to not be caught." Sherlock readjusted his coat and his scarf and started heading for the door, not even bothering to explain anything.
John looked away a bit.
John scowled a bit.
"Our landlady is in danger!"
"I don't think that's a good idea."
Just barely poking out from under the bed was the knife Sherlock used to keep his letters on the mantelpiece. It had blood on it. Other than that, there was not much different in the room, all things considered.
The good doctor gasped and ran over to Holmes.
The doctor growled angerly.
"I hope he doesn't come back. Are you afraid of him, my love?"
"I don't think they are."
John couldn't take it anymore as he grabbed the inspecter's gun and aimed it at the madman.
"Good luck, Sherlock..."
John weakly dragged himself to Sherlock.
"What do you mean?"
"Sherlock...?"
"I don't know, I just... felt like I had to, and then I realized what I was doing, and..."
"I said I can do it myself." he repeated as he dragged himself onto the bed.
"Detective Inspector Lestrade, Doctor Watson?" She asked.
So all he could do was wait.
Moriarty walked closer to Sherlock and held out his hand. "Come on. Leave the side of the angels behind. Clearly you're not fit for it."
." He snapped his head around with a fierce look in his eyes and looked John right in the eyes. "The weapon is still on the crime scene. Go find it." Then, he turned back to the cipher, put on his leather gloves, and started smearing it so that no one else could read it, thereby destroying evidence on the scene, which he was absolutely not allowed to do, and had never intentionally done before.
Moriarty shrugged and calmly shot John in the stomach.
"I, uh... I guess I should thank you if you're right. You might have just saved my life."
"And why do you want to do that?"
"I'm alright. SH" The text read, ending with Sherlock's initials to signify that it was in fact a text from the Consulting Detective himself.
"I'm not sacrificing my
"Meaning?"
"I have to." Sherlock insisted.
Watson got worried.
Magnussen chuckled a little. "Moriarty might do that, but not I, Doctor Watson."
John wiped his eyes and wheeled himself to the front.
"You're kidding!"
"Tough break."
"How is Sherlock?"
"You should rest, Sherlock. I'll take the couch while you take the bed."
"Sherlock, you're bleeding badly! You need to go to the hospital!" cried Watson as he tried to get up.
Sherlock kind of wanted to hug him in that moment, but didn't feel it safe.
He quickly looked at him.
"What's wrong with me? I feel fine."
"Just don't get hurt in the process or I'll never forgive myself." Sherlock mumbled.
The Consulting Detective was rapidly growing paler and paler.
It turns out to be fairly accurate.
"Did I mention we needed a new kettle?"
A folder is passed over to him. "One of my agents," Mycroft says. "The situation is quite dire. She was shot in the abdomen some eighty seconds ago -"
John raises an eyebrow in Mycroft's direction. "Well? What d'you need me for, then?"
"You absolute lying toerag -"
Sherlock trails after him into the kitchen. "You've been hiding it well."
John jolts awake.
Sherlock thinks,
John's gaze sharpens. "Ah, yes. Would you mind awfully if I camped out on your couch until I warm up a bit? You're almost guaranteed to have more blankets than 221B, since someone set our only one on fire recently."
John says, "I did go to medical school."
"Hiding what? The crushing darkness of eternal boredom? The horrible epiphany that a lifetime of grey is stretching itself out ahead of you?"
his phone asks. The tinny voice is concerned, discarded on the floor. Sherlock wraps his arms around himself and stares unseeingly at it.
John remembers vividly the distinct crackle and rumble of the heavens before they open, before the Afghan sands are drenched in water untinged by the smog of a busy city. He remembers the way everything stops, the way every living thing from the tiniest, hardiest plants to the bloodthirstiest Taliban pause for the duration of the rainstorm to simply sit back and watch the miracle of nature. British soldiers flocked outside, some crying under the cover of the water, 'home' an acute pain in their chests both amplified and eased by the rain. John remembers even the rushed, everlasting thrum of his field hospital slowing at the rarity.
"Sherlock Holmes, what would
Sherlock was fully intending to slam his door if John didn't spot him immediately, plasterboard be damned. He was going to shout until John's face went stony and flat with hurt and suppressed anger and he left for either his room or a walk and took the noise with him. He was going to insult the man's height and features and quirks and poke at every nerve he had ever found.
"You went into my room?" John asks. "Why were you in my wardrobe?"
John emphasizes, going back to the issue at hand, "because you
John coughs pointedly.
He wasn't the best at science in school, but he thinks that John (if anyone does) counts as a new variable. It's like unknowingly having a faulty pack of cards and then suddenly being told that Kings are an actual thing and having to get your head around a whole new rank shoving itself between the Queens and the Aces.
John lets Sherlock reclaim the wheel, rubbing the heels of his palms into his eyes. "Sherlock, I'm never going to sleep if I think you're going to be spending the entire time bouncing from pothole to pothole."
Harry chimes,
It hits him again. Belatedly.
He casts his eyes to his feet. "I know you're better with women, but. . . can you keep an eye to see if you think he's interested?"
Lestrade gets to witness the miracle of Sherlock not only being silenced, but being silenced by something so small as a wordlessly raised hand.
that one day he would have something like that too, thinks of his father leaning over her shoulder and admitting that he might have to wait a while for it to come.
John stares at the book in his hand. This book is full of pages, and chapters. In each chapter, there will be many, many paragraphs, and in each paragraph there are words. Some of these paragraphs may repeat, if it is that rare sort of book that can get away with it without making you blink at the page on confusion and some odd sort of alarm. The words within a paragraph will repeat, definitely; a snippet of one of Sherlock's beekeeping books will most likely mention the focus of its subject several times within a single sentence. Even in this one, the paragraph John is creating as he thinks, he has probably thought the word
Lestrade ignores the jab, choosing instead to look past Sherlock's shoulder to where John is leaning against the wall, glowering at the ground. "This is like a glitch in the Matrix. Did you two swap bodies somehow?"
Sherlock shifts. "The kettle was on fire."
John glares at him. "You've been cutting me off cases," he accuses.
Harry gives one of the most unladylike snorts he's ever heard. "Oof. That's rough. Although now I have no idea what to expect from the appearance of your flat."
When the taxi stops at John’s flat, John doesn’t get out. Sherlock points out that this is John’s home and John wants to sleep here. John just stares at him and says he looks older than four years ago but still good. He tells the driver to take them to Baker Street. When they stop there, John gets out of the car easily enough and stumbles to the front door while Sherlock pays the driver. At the door, John tries to fit all his keys one by one into the lock. It won’t work, because John doesn’t have the key. He doesn’t live here anymore. Sherlock opens the door and follows John up the stairs, opens the door to their flat, no,
Sherlock swallows. “I didn’t want you to slow down. It gets a little… overwhelming. Quickly is better. And I can handle a bit of pain.”
“She wasn’t even surprised, was she?”
“Thanks,” John says, “but no. I just stopped by to see how you were doing, and you’re doing fine, so… I’ll just go.”
John took a deep breath. “I’ve killed people too. I’m not proud of it, either.”
“What?” Sherlock asks.
Sherlock nods.
“You came back.”
“I would,” he says. “With you.”
So, Mycroft thought Sherlock was going to kill John Watson sooner or later. Sherlock would prove that Mycroft was wrong.
“Don’t be an idiot. This isn’t about sex –“
“I’m not…” John breathed out, walked across the room and opened the door to the operating room. “Here.”
“What?”
John closed his eyes for a second. The tea. He was making tea. Tea would fix this. He picked two mugs from the cupboard and poured water in them. Sherlock was still standing in the kitchen doorway, which didn’t make sense at all, because Sherlock clearly didn’t want to talk about the hand and Sherlock never did anything just to please John, only he did, actually, all the time. Sometimes the things he did were so small John barely noticed then, like a few nights ago, when John had been watching the television and his toes had been freezing and he had only realised that when Sherlock had thrown a pair of wool socks into his lap.
John sighed. “Aren’t you going to tell me?”
“I love you,” Sherlock says, “like, I love you in every way I can think of. Not just as a friend. I want to kiss you. And I want to have sex with you, even though I have to warn you, I’m not good in bed. There are so many nuances to it and nobody explains them to you, and so I kind of gave up a long time ago. But I want to try again. Maybe you can explain it to me. And I want you to move back in. I want you here. And I want to sleep in the same bed.”
“Don’t,” John says, but it’s too late.
And maybe love is also an illusion. Maybe their whole life is an illusion: these slow mornings in Baker Street, these afternoons when they run after assassins and murderers and, when Sherlock is very bored, bicycle thieves, these nights when Sherlock pushes his cold toes against John’s legs under the duvet and John kicks him for it but softly. Maybe it’s only going to last for as long as John will believe in it. And he will believe in it.
“You can kiss me,” Sherlock says. It sounds like a promise.
“You just said so.”
“Can you eat human food?”
“It was mutually benefactory.”
“…what?”
“Did you like it?”
talking about?”
“Shut up.”
Sherlock opens his mouth. There’s an awful silence, and then John’s face goes pink.
“…okay?”
“I didn’t think I wanted sex,” Sherlock says. He’s not sure why he started but it doesn’t matter now. John is still touching his face, even though he’s not sure why. “But I had dreams. I told you about that. You did things to me.”
” He draped his arm around Sherlock’s back. “Hug me.”
,” he said and then blinked. “No, of course not. I’m not
Then he realised there was something wrong with the street.
“Sorry.”
“You’re lying.”
“Great,” John says, looking at Sherlock. “Could you… could you lend me something to wear?”
“Yeah?”
Just a guess. But Sherlock can’t say that, so he only looks at John.
“John is better than Tom Hardy,” Sherlock says. “Much better.”
“Shh,” John says, when Sherlock opens his mouth. Then John moves his hand, pushes his fingers under the waistband of Sherlock’s boxers, then manoeuvres his hand in. When Sherlock looks down at his own lap, he can see the tip of his cock in John’s palm. It’s red and leaking. “Is this alright?” John asks.
does, but Sherlock knows it’s John, and not only because no one else would bother coming to talk to him. He knows the way John knocks on the door. He has it memorised, like he has everything about John memorised. A long time ago, he thought cocaine would help him forget. It kind of did, but the effect was temporary.
“Everything.”
We’re going to be in love every single day for years and years, and we’re going to get used to it. It’s going to be dull sometimes. And irritating.
Sherlock breathes in. “No, it’s not.”
Sherlock stares at John. “Yes,” he says after a few seconds, when John still isn’t saying anything. “Yes, we’re ready. John?”
“I’m not going to let you move out,” Sherlock said, which was sweet. He was also looking at John as if he wanted to eat John. That was sweet, too. Nobody had looked at John like that in a very long time.
“It’ll pass.”
for you, and I thought I was going to die too, and I know it’s stupid, you’re going to think I’m stupid, but I really thought I couldn’t… couldn’t live without you.”
“We could use a towel.”
It feels weird.
“Can you smell it? My blood.”
“Yes, I was.”
“Yes.”
John pulled his shoulders back and stood straight. “You were holding hands with it.”
John swallows. “Your moods –“
“We’re finished here,” Sherlock says and puts the needle away. But he doesn’t tell John to climb off the table where John has been sitting on for better light. And he doesn’t move away himself.
So, John kept his fingers in Sherlock’s hair, and Sherlock pulled John’s pants down.
“You do,” Sherlock says.
“…which are?”
Otherwise, he just says the wrong things.
“Stop that. You’re going to cut your hands.”
“Sherlock,” John said. He sounded scared. Sherlock would eat him alive, pour something toxic on the carpet and then retreat into his bedroom and stay there until tomorrow. He would have to put the hand into the freezer, which wasn’t ideal, because he didn’t want to touch it. Also, he didn’t want to think about how it had had Sherlock’s hand holding it. If the person to whom the hand had belonged would have still been alive, he would have known now what it felt like to hold hands with Sherlock Holmes.
And you just told me not to worry, you fucking arsehole, you didn’t tell me where you were going or that you weren’t going to come back –“
“I’m not,” John says. The tissue is soaked through with Sherlock’s blood now, so he takes a new one. “I don’t know what this is, but it’s not that. Can’t be.”
“Okay,” John says. “So, maybe I’ll just…”
“What did you do?” he asks, fucking Sherlock and stroking Sherlock and loving Sherlock. He can’t bloody help it. “Four years ago. Earlier than four years ago. There’s nothing about you on the internet.”
Sherlock didn’t especially like drinking from humans. He preferred deer. They didn’t taste as good, but at least they knew how to stay quiet. They didn’t bore him trying to bargain with him or begging him: ‘
indeed had a hunch. But he had been slightly confused, until later that evening, Sherlock had told him he was gay and had tried to kiss John.
“You saw people holding hands on the television and wanted to try it.”
He raised his hand and touched the sleeve.
“Sorry,” Sherlock said. The word felt a bit weird in his mouth but then again, it had been a long time since he had last used it.
“I would’ve tried. For you.”
of the
“I don’t want to.”
“You’ve tried mud?”
,” John says and sighs. “Sorry. I’m sorry. I was… I don’t know what I was thinking about.”
“Somebody hit you pretty hard.”
“Please,” John says, his voice quiet. His rhythm doesn’t falter. “For me.”
Sherlock took the coat, and John took a deep breath. Oh, god. Oh, god, how stupid he was. He felt like… like Sherlock had caught him listening through the door for sex noises. Which was a stupid thing to feel like, by the way. He had just tried on Sherlock’s coat. And
“You hadn’t, though,” Sherlock says. “You can still do it. I have… I have seen you.”
“I thought you were straight,” Sherlock says, kisses John’s nose and cheek and forehead and the corner of his eye. “A straight army doctor from Afghanistan. A lot of sex with women, different women, but just women. Always women. Very straight. Perfectly safe to live with.”
“I’m not going to leave you,” John says. He’s almost sure now. Sherlock’s a drug addict, and John is paranoid and thought for a second he had been fucking a human-like robot, but they can both get over this. They can go back to being how they were. “Sorry I worried you.”
“Of course,” Mycroft said. “Well, now that I know that you are awake and sufficiently hydrated, I’m going to excuse myself. There’s a trade contract with the United States of America that needs my attention.”
John glances at him, his mouth open.
So, Sherlock has sex with John Watson. On camera. None of it is real, and luckily that’s a hard thing to forget, when the room is full of people and someone’s showing a light at his face and he’s sure he’s sweating his makeup off. He gets somewhat used to lying in bed while John is on him, pretending to wank him. He kind of gets used to the kisses, too. But his heart is still beating too fast.
And then we started reading. And it was…”
“Thank you,” Sherlock said and climbed off the table. John wanted to help him but held back. Sherlock had probably had enough of John touching him for today. “I won’t be long.”
“Yes,” Sherlock said quickly and then paused, “well, I was taking a nap while that term got popular. But I prefer men. Soldiers, to be precise. Preferably…”
Sherlock shakes his head.
“Hello,” he says, but Mary is already walking away, saying something to John.
“We aren’t going to move to Norway, and I don’t want you to watch nature documents anymore. You’ve had this weird fixation on Norway for two months now and only because you saw it in a nature document.”
“Yes.”
“Barely.”
“Stop it,” Sherlock says. “I’m aware that you’ve already realised that, well, even creatures with mediocre intellectual capacity understand some things. But I didn’t mean my superior intellect.”
“Yes.”
There was one dream, one dream in which John wanted him to -
stop talking. Tell me what you’d like to do to me.”
This is
Sherlock flinches.
“Right,” John said and stood up. This was a bit too much. He was in a gay relationship with a vampire. “I think I should go to sleep,” he said.
“Yeah,” John says. He’s smiling again, thank god. “Yeah, I noticed that. It was a bit weird for me, too.”
“If you wanted someone safe to live with, maybe you shouldn’t have picked an army doctor with PTSD,” John says. He’s holding his breath. Sherlock kisses his ear.
He pulled his hands away, took off the gloves and threw them in the bin. Then he went to wash his hands. He had semen on his forearm, so he washed that off too, grabbed paper towels and went back to Sherlock. Sherlock was still on the operating table, still naked and breathless and looking like he had just had sex.
Sherlock didn’t answer.
was terrible, he would have never wanted to change places with Sherlock. He touched Sherlock’s testicles, felt them in his hand, petted as gently as he could and then a little bit more, and Sherlock’s eyelids flickered and he let out noises that no one should be making in an operating room, probably. John told him he was doing so well, that he was being so good, and it would be over soon, very soon, just not yet, because John still had to… still had to check a few things.
“You don’t,” Sherlock says, staring at him,
“Yeah,” John said, “I know, I know I’m not gay, but kissing doesn’t really count. So, you… you want to kiss me, don’t you? That’s why you sometimes lick my neck?”
Easy enough to deduce that much. Sherlock filed it away, didn’t think it was important.
Sherlock stared at him. “You aren’t supposed to ask me that.”
John holds his hand at the door handle, seemingly uncertain what to do with it. “And because it’s been more than two years since you’ve had an acting job, and this is a perfect opportunity for you to get back.”
“What? Why?”
“You just left them there,” Mycroft said, “you made a pile and left them at the beach.”
“I’m a bloody idiot.”
“I don’t know,” Sherlock asks him, leaning closer, peering into his eyes as if there might a clue in there. Or a riddle to solve. “Are you not feeling well?”
“…do you?”
kissing him. It was wet, and it was perfect, and he had a feeling that it was also very gay.
“She probably thinks that’s the best way to keep me,” John says, “at least a part of me.” A pause. “She might be right.”
“Did I like what?” Sherlock asks.
“I was just on my way out,” Mary says to Sherlock as she walks out of the door.
John Watson liked to think that he wasn’t an idiot, but actually, he was. It had turned out recently that he had had a crush on his flatmate pretty much since the day one and he had only realised that when he had found the said flatmate in their kitchen, holding hands with somebody’s removed limb.
John takes a deep breath. “Good.”
“Why did you do it?” Sherlock asks. He’s in the living room, standing on the sofa. Maybe he wants to be taller. It’s ridiculous, because he is already the tall one. John is… he can’t remember how tall he is. Not tall.
Boring.
, this whole idea that he would try to find a medical reason for the robot’s unwillingness to… co-operate. He almost went to Mike to say that he had changed his mind, he didn’t want anything to do with this, and the problem had to be in the code anyway, the developers should check that again. But he didn’t. He stared at the screen, the appointment marked in Sherlock’s calendar, switched off the computer and went to the sickbay for his shift.
“You’re alright,” John says. His hands are firm. They’re the only thing keeping Sherlock from falling. Always, always. John’s fingers dig into his hips, nails scratching his skin. It’s good. It… feels like something. “You’re alright, Sherlock,” John says, and this is probably sex, they’re fucking, John is fucking
He should have done something about it before it was too late.
John pinches the bridge of Sherlock’s nose harder. “Why the hell not? How do you know?”
“And how exactly are you going to find out why it is that I don’t want these people to push their various body parts inside me, or touch mine?”
