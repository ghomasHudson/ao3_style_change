“Sherlock!!!”
“We sure can. But before that there’s something you need to do.”
Sherlock had just finished his work and was hurrying through some administrative steps he had to cover, eager to rush back home and meet John, when Molly came up to him. Sherlock felt a bit awkward around her because she had a crush on him earlier and made that very clear to him on his face, but that day, to make matters worse, she brought along her younger sister Sally as well. “Hello Sherlock,” she stopped at his desk, “Just wanted you to know that Sally has joined us here. She is a dramatics teacher, a teaching assistant more like, but soon she will have her own classes.”
“Do you have to do this?” Sherlock’s words and tone had no parity, he was giggling, his eyes shining with mischief.
Sherlock went to the window and was shutting it when the wind picked up and the drapes billowed all over him. “Gosh,” he moved them away and looked at the skies, “It’s going to be bad as I see. Might be raining all week this week.”
“What the fuck!”
John blinked, “What?”
For a few minutes they were knocked dizzy. Neither of them remembered what happened right after the orgasm but when they woke up they found themselves tangled together, sweat cooling on their bodies and their bodies still buzzing in afterglow.
“And we keep losing time,” Greg sighed irritably, “Three months since that Goddamned murder and John Doe’s appearance and we still have nothing.”
He had figured out that the politician and his wife were both having an affair and in both cases it was Irene who had organized ‘partners’ for them. The footballer was secretly gay and in love with his masseuse who was bearding with his PR agent. That’s why both the masseuse and the PR agent were here. The footballer’s wife was a pretty Polly with nothing between her ears and totally oblivious to the truth.
It was her jewelry and art room. Aside from a wall spanning safe with a combination lock, there were locked glass showcases covering one half of the room and at least a dozen paintings and sculptures hung on the wall or placed on pedestals and shelved in the other half. The younger man realized that the paintings were quite pricey. He saw the signatures of artists, mostly from the fifties to the nineties, in the upper or lower corners of the canvas or glass.
Feeling an overwhelming tightness in his pants and sweat breaking out over his forehead and temples, John followed Sherlock as the detective made his way towards the staff toilets. His leather pants had split at the seams and seat, showing ample flesh. Every curve and stretch of his lower torso was already massively pronounced in the skin tight leggings, now the splits and gaps and holes gave it the ultimate look of a ‘porn-star’s barely-there’ outfit. John stuck by Sherlock, moving in sync with him, staying right behind him, so he could bodily block the sight of his ‘distressed’ pants from prying eyes.
John stepped into the northern section of the mansion, accessible only through an interconnecting door on the first floor, between two hallways, and from the ground floor via a set of stairs/elevator. John of course took the door, which no one else opened without permission. His grandmother’s section of the house was mostly kept segregated and isolated, to ensure the old lady was not disturbed and no interference came from her or towards her.
It was only eleven-thirty when the Mi6 chief stood outside the door, minus his fabled umbrella.
“Yes, very much sir. Barrister Mycroft Holmes, the one who won that case….”
“I was supposed to give them ten and I just didn’t have that many. This is a weird job and most of the people we employ don’t do weird jobs. They do odd ones. Even if someone agrees to try for the sake of money, eventually they would not get shortlisted by the client because they simply don’t make the cut. Now think about the twenty-five grand we will make from this simple exercise and shut your trap.”
Until his bright eyes opened for a moment and he thought he saw the eyes of the feline deity glowing. It was a weirdly unsettling moment, he felt as if he was being communicated with.
“Yes,
,” Jim whispered as he saw Sherlock getting into his Jeep Grand Cherokee but pausing on the way to stamp upon a nice little ladybug that was scuttling over the cobbled surface of the driveway. Mycroft noticed that too and was about to say something when Jim grabbed at his sleeve and tugged. “He does too,” he added in a lower whisper so only Mycroft could hear, “I don’t mean to be rude but once we’re married and I start living here I am going to fix a few things around your house and family. Two of those ‘fixes’ would have to be your siblings. No nonsensical, freakish and juvenile behavior in the house, that won’t be tolerated.”
John scrunched his eyes shut as he felt the elastic channel around him cave in completely. His orgasm triggered, he managed to open his eyes just long enough to watch Sherlock as he came. Pupils almost entirely dilated, mouth open, veins in his neck throbbing and hips shaking and moving in tandem with John’s speedier thrusts, Sherlock was quite the sight as he climaxed. He came so profusely the seed dripped down the sides and he still kept depositing some more.
“My-My, you really are ready for more so soon???” He felt the softening flesh spring up again in his fist, “Some stamina and refractory period huh?”
“Except old man Marvin Vonn Dyke,” Agnes muttered.
“Yeah it sure is. Is there a light or something in the basement? Oh yeah, two of them, I located them. Wait a moment, will switch them on.”
Greg stood up but didn’t make any move to leave. Sally and Phil got up too and moved towards the door, then turned back and gave him exasperated glances. Finally Phil put his hand on Sally’s shoulder and made a gesture to follow him outside, leaving their boss to decide when to exit the room and the house. Once they had left, Sherlock had a hunch that Greg probably wanted to talk to him alone so he signaled for Haines to give them some privacy. The moment the butler had left, Greg looked at Sherlock earnestly and said, “I don’t mind if you toss me out right after this on my arse but I have to tell you this – I care about you, I am worried about you and I still feel you have made a mistake.”
She sat down next to him and touched the Stradivarius he had put down between them, lightly. “Can’t believe this costs in millions,” her voice reflected awe but also a dollop of delight, “You must be so careful with it all the time, worried that it might break and one masterpiece in this world would be lost, huh?”
Sally leaned a bit closer to Greg and whispered, “Is he joking with us? Flash Gordon?” Greg didn’t mind. He suggested gamely, “A nickname or something similar. Could be a friend.”
I want to experience the magic of anal sex, a blitzing prostate orgasm, and it better be with someone I trust and feel easy with, like you! Please, will you be my first like I was yours!!?”
“I think you’re missing a word.”
“STOPPPP!!!”
“Okay, we get it, we know you are both hot-headed, impulsive geniuses, no you’re both wildcats with very long fangs and the sharpest of claws. But even you can’t expect everyone to pander to your likes and dislikes all the time. There are moments when people will speak their mind, whether you like it or not baby. Calm down now, no need to get upset with what the girls said. We didn’t encourage or support them, did we?”
“We have been driving through those vast, expansive grounds for the past seven or eight minutes,” Greg smiled broadly and Sherlock’s eyes widened, “He owns about three hundred acres of land here, including fifty-acre woods, two orchards, a manmade lake with fishing capabilities, a solar plant for energy harvesting, barns and granaries for storage, a meat factory and a cheese plant, that huge greenhouse that helps grow all kinds of fruits and vegetables and herbs through the year. There are vegetable patches and cornfields, wheat and rice, quinoa and lentils. Those country style cottages and semidetached homes you see, they belong to his workers and there are dozens of them living here, on this estate. Foremen of his ranch, horse trainers, chauffeurs, groundskeepers, ranch hands, factory workers and the like.”
“Oh no,” Sally said quickly, taking her eyes off John who had by then reached the top of the stairs, “It’s not what you think, though I have to admit he’s an attractive man! I think I might have seen him somewhere. He seemed very, very familiar to me at the very first glance. You know I have a very good memory.”
She blushed, “Yes, that can be arranged.”
“Oh,” John looked quite satisfied with the answer, “Tiger is here. Sherlock, it must be a common friend.”
“Not sure why anyone would need to worry about a thirty year old man,” Sherlock said a bit coldly, “Mrs. Hudson?”
John heard those words, his blood freezing over with anxiety, as Sherlock struggled to free his arm and the formidable assassin swept closer to him, a few more daggers emerging from his pockets, shirt, shoes and even his belt. The bastard was far stronger than Sherlock and trained at doing this, even if Sherlock managed to escape John was sure this man had a gun hidden that could bring the detective down. His first instinct was to show himself and rush over for a heroic rescue or just shoot at the man from a distance, but something held him back. An assassin like this, who had formerly been in the army just like John, could only be overcome by a surprise factor. If he shot at him and missed the man would kill Sherlock sooner. If he showed himself, it would be a defeatist move since that cold-blooded psychopathic killer was in a better position than John to take fatal shots at both men.
Sherlock did an eyeroll and winked at John who seemed taken aback by her sudden arrival. ‘Answer her’ John whispered to Sherlock who responded with a, “Yes, in 15 minutes.”
“A hundred and twenty grand for a minimum of six and a maximum of eight surgeries a month, twenty hours of consultation per week and four hours a week for research and development. Plus annual bonus before Christmas, ten thousand. A midyear bonus, five thousand. Health insurance, category 1 for myself and family members, that should include dental, Lasik, skin correction, the whole nine yards. Also, employer’s contribution to pension should be over and above this amount.”
“Ready to go?” He asked, slowing down.
“Yes, yes, yes, all of that. Don’t you agree with me too?”
“Hey! You’re back!”
They kissed, putting their arms around each other. The gentle, light kiss deepened, as if often happened whenever they got into a lip-lock and for more than a minute they just stood there looking into each other’s eyes. If Gretel thought they were taking too long to get ready and come out, she didn’t hurry them up nor did she show any signs of impatience. “Alright,” John pulled back after a long time, “We really gotta go downstairs now.”
John frowned, “Why is that a problem?”
“Okay what next?” John asked. Sebastian patted his belly, “I don’t know about the rest of you but I am hungry as well.”
And John wanted the answer from Sherlock, not Mycroft.
“Oh….”
He turned towards his unwelcome visitor and yawned in an exaggerated manner. “Goodnight Phil, you should be on your way home.”
“You mean Sherlock Holmes needs a new pair of pants,” Larry said, squashing John’s hopes of keeping this under wraps, “No explanations needed Dr. Watson, I will get you something. It will be part of the hotel’s staff uniform though.”
“I do, but I don’t see the context, background or reason to mention him sir.”
“Over there Jawn,” Sherlock whispered, pointing at a huge pine tree “Our very own outdoor Christmas tree, right before the porch and in the middle of the driveway cul-de-sac. For better or worse,
.” Mycroft suppressed his chuckle. He found this funny, if also slightly weird because Jim was twenty-two, the same age as Sherlock. “And I am assuming that tonight you forgot to tell them about staying out late. If they know I am with you I doubt if they’d be worried. They’ll be totally at ease…..”
“Thanks for the gifts,” Sherlock spoke and it was in a businesslike tone that he used only with clients, “Including Mary.”
He didn’t have an answer for her and chose to support her decision.
Suddenly he saw himself outside the ICU of a hospital. A doctor, whose face he couldn’t see, was saying, “I am very sorry but your mum is not going to make it. She is sinking. I had told you last year she was not to be exposed to any shocks and strong emotions, nothing that should affect her and in her fragile condition…..”
John was quite startled at this unusual and extra-friendly interaction. This senior surgeon and HOD could call anyone for a sudden meeting and no one would bat an eyelid. People were usually honored to be in the presence of this man, who was always busy and had little time to chitchat. “It’s perfectly okay doctor,” John replied with extra respect and politeness, “Also, I am not done for the day yet. I finished one surgery, appendix removal. I have at least four or five more hours to go. It’s only 2 PM now so yeah, attending this meeting is no problem at all.”
“Please Mr. Bouffler, if you are in trouble or he is bothering you then you have to tell me. Maybe I can help in some way. At least I can give you some background. Not just about this man but also about the other man, Colonel Moran, our employer’s cousin and family.”
“I know son, I know about that. But it’s no one’s fault. Why should they bear the brunt of your misfortune? Isn’t there a way to contain yourselves for those days of the year when you’re dangerous for society. Believe me, if there is a way I shall help you. No one will know the truth.”
A rabbit crossed their path and the moment it saw them, it made a weirdly whiny frightened noise and scooted away to the side, disappearing in the bushes. “What do we do?” Jim muttered under his breath, “That shorter fella, the one with the dark honey blond hairs, the even turned and looked at us a few times. Think he realized someone was out there?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Three separate clips playing side by side showed a man and a man, a man and a woman and two women smiling, chatting, holding hands, even kissing. Then one of the partners in each clip ushered the other into a romantic and cozy but luxurious setting, a bedroom setting to be precise, with wine and roses, chocolates and caviar, gifts and flickering candles. The intentions were very clear and Greg was talking about how one must carefully notice the way each partner approached the other and slowly led them to bed, put them at ease and slowly make it impossible for them to say no to the obvious next steps that follow. Sex. Yes, clearly each couple was about to have sex for the first time.
“You were foolish to think I am so dense,” Sherlock went on, swallowing hard, “Then you made the same mistake with Mary. You thought she’s just…..guess what, she told me she’ll step aside and I told her the same but then….do you really deserve any one of us? I have stayed away from sex, from attraction, from infatuation, diligently, carefully, zealously. But you pranced in, made me change, made me vulnerable and then you hurt me.”
Around ten pm, when everyone finally retired to their bedrooms, Sherlock followed John to their master bedroom, a room which was bigger than his entire flat. Along with the master closet, dressing area and en-suite bathroom, it was bigger than the entire floor of the house his parents owned. No, he wasn’t going to think about them or about the past…. Nope, he had to move on. He smiled at John a bit too wide and found the older man similarly uncomfortable. John avoided any eye contact and cleared his throat, “I… um, I’ll use the bathroom first.”
Sherlock hears someone lurking around
“What the…..” he began when a Persian cat appeared, only his face was that of John’s. He was also wearing a doctor’s coat, had a stethoscope around his neck and was holding a forceps and a scalpel in his paws. “You should be thanking me pretty human,” said John in his own voice, “I just saved you from entering USA without a proper visa and work permit.”
Sherlock stood expectantly at the bathroom door, one hand still clutching at the doorknob. “Where’s the waiter?”
The situation didn’t improve for Phil at the Japanese restaurant either. John and Sherlock were lost in their own world and despite trying his best, he couldn’t stick his nose in. In terms of choosing dishes from the elaborate menu, John suggested that each of them choose what they’d like to eat rather than one person ‘assuming’ others should be okay their choice. Phil bristled from that comment but couldn’t argue otherwise. As their meal arrived, he found he had chosen something too spicy and the idea of eating sticky rice with chopsticks had been a bad idea. He dropped food on his lap and drank more than six glasses of water to wash down the spicy dish.
The two men entered the room and found a very tense, restless and nervous Phillip Jeffrey Andersen waiting there. He had been chasing Greg’s office for an appointment but under the man’s instructions that had been held off so far. But today he had decided to take a normal ‘meeting appointment’ and mentioned he was in Paris already and would drop by at the house at that hour. Greg’s brows rose; he had been expecting this man but he had kept him off for a few months because he wanted to see just how badly Phil wanted to change himself and his rather objectionable ways of courting people and bribing people.
“Why should we break up?” John reacted instantly, “I am not going to stop being his friend even if we do move in together in the future.”
Sherlock simply dropped his clothes and stood there, naked, and started touching the twin nubs on his smooth chest; at which point poor John Watson forgot the fine line between truth and lies and took him
“But then we……”
His breath was knocked out of him in a whoosh as he saw John standing there, naked. “Who says we need swim trunks?” Asked the naughty priest as Sherlock gasped like a fish out of water. He had stiffened so fast he was in serious danger of cumming in his pants right now. His eyes drank in the sight of John standing there, his skin smooth and unlined and his compact frame packed with muscles. He was athletic, strong and there were a few scars here and there that showed a colorful past that was hardly the stuff ordinary and regular people had. A knife fight, taser mark, even toothmarks. But what was truly remarkable was the size and girth of his cock. Heavy and long, with sizeable balls, he was well hung and uncut, the thatch of light brown pubic hair trimmed neatly.
“Not even when you slept with someone?”
The corpse was left half hanging out of the bed, her eyes open and a look of horror frozen there. Tangled in the bedclothes, her blood dripping on the rug beneath, poor Mrs. Mary Finch died from the knife wound while the assailant walked away towards the window nonchalantly.
John’s heartbeat increased rapidly. He felt cramping pains in his gut. Sherlock,
“I want to see him and if you give me any further bullshit about rules I shall call the chief of police here, Charlie. He knows me and my family very well and if I were you, I’d do as I am told. Do you want me to call him right now, here, kick your ignorant arse into the next century?”
Sherlock didn’t answer.
“What was that?” John set down the cup of coffee before Sherlock with a work roughened hand, giving him a strict glare, “What chicken?”
John had been given an old laptop to use and he was listening to music on that. The disappointment registered on his face instantly. But he quickly pushed it away and offered Sherlock a brilliant smile. “I’ll manage.”
Against his genuine concerns about the environment, he flushed the condom this time instead of tying it off and disposing it safely in the garbage. He lingered around in the bathroom for a long time, hoping to calm himself down as he grappled with this sudden change in his sex-life. Mary and he were not a highly sexed couple. Their attraction was mainly intellectual and emotional. But that didn’t stop them from enjoying two rounds of sex once a week, at her place.
“But I want to.”
“Conversation over.”
Suddenly he saw them strolling in together, hand in hand.
“Who would that be?”
Sherlock was already torn between needing to cum hard and right away and prolonging the pleasure slightly longer by holding on just for a bit. He made a moaning sound and clung to John with arms and legs, kissing him hard and possessively. John’s eyebrows slightly rose as he felt the other man’s grip get tighter and he kissed him back, then smiled down at him as his hips continued to move. “Hey, I am right here babe, I am going nowhere. Why do you look so worried and anxious?! I am here aren’t I? I am right there with you and I promise for as long as I live I shall always be there for you Sherl!”
“Yes, I know….”
“I didn’t mean to disrespect you,” Sally said sincerely, “But no one is milk and honey and rose petals, we all know that. Maybe there is a darker side to Sherlock. If not, a case of misunderstanding. Whatever it is, I am now convinced John is no petty criminal and we must give him the benefit of doubt. Unless he had a pretty good reason no one would ever give up this life and this kind of fortune, over a 100 million net worth perhaps, to commit a crime that would keep them behind bars for the rest of their lives.”
He found Sherlock two compartments down, typing something on his phone. The moment he spotted John he said, “I have a case tomorrow as well. Stolen top secret papers from a minister’s office. Chances are that these papers, if leaked to the media or transferred to some Russian spies, could cause heavy damages to our country and the image of our government. Will you accompany me?”
“Jawn?”
“GET OUT.”
“Sherlock, what is going on? You are…..
, are looking forward eagerly to the golf, the watersports, hiking up the cliffs and all of those nature-facing activities. Oh and some fishing too, some nice trouts and catfish and pike, even the smaller ones like perch and trench and barbel etc.”
Turned on by that tone of authority and the use of words, Sherlock nodded vigorously and pushed back with all his might. John slid in deeper and bellowed out with pleasure as Sherlock’s inner muscles clamped down on him, squeezing him so good that he had no opportunity to hold back the peak that loomed closer. “Fuck, Sherl, I am going to cum…. Oh fuck, I’m cumming,” he stalled, then made a few erratic thrusts before his semen flowed into Sherlock once again.
“You have a photograph of me on your desk?” Sherlock asked. His heart was doing backflips in his chest.
I called Gander Lestrade, aka brother-in-law, for a little help with some raw materials for my next recipe. I wanted to make a salad and needed just a few ingredients for it, like cucumbers, lettuce, pomegranate, olives, carrots, salad oil, some seasonings and apricot kernels. He first snaps at me for calling him ‘Gander’. Okay so I was wrong but I still made him a male goose. Told him so and he got sarcastic. Said why did I even plan a salad when I had practically no ingredients for my ‘Garden salad with breadcrumbs’. That is wrong at so many levels.
“Excuse me.”
“Maybe he thought he still had a chance and in case John and you broke up he’d step in. Sometimes engagements don’t last or don’t get converted to a wedding. But John and you remained in love and took things to the altar, thereafter he realized he can never change this reality! This ring is a bit more permanent so he’s got whacked in the head and heart heh!!”
Phil had no clue how to respond to that. He hated being on the backfoot but that was exactly what he was on right now. He opened his mouth to say something but Greg Lestrade beat him to it. “He is here hoping to give a sobbing Sherlock his shoulder to lean on. Oh God, the number of such macho insufferable homosexual men who completely feminize their male partners!!! Even if Sherlock is in trouble he can handle himself, he hardly needs you for support Andersen.”
“Oh sorry, I forgot, you have decided not to speak.”
“What do you propose you’d do to them Jawn? Our biggest mistake was that we thought the whole world thinks and behaves like us, that since we are not evil other people lack the capacity of being evil. We learned our lessons the hard way. They are very dangerous criminals and, unlike us, always prepared to take on any adversary. I am not too sure they have more tea on us or not and if they will turn out all efforts, conspiracies and weapons to get back at us if we poke at their nest.”
He had sandals on his feet. After all, he thought he was just walking down to the village.
“No sir,” Jason said, “I had done your bidding and ensured everyone you expected during this time was given the message that you were away and could be contacted only over the weekend. But today afternoon a young blond man walked in, without appointment. His name was, I don’t remember it clearly, his name was…..”
Greg has a hunch and Mycroft is in denial
When the man looked but in a casual, dismissive manner, the lady officer used a harsher tone. “Ask your staff, I am sure someone will remember,” Sally said sternly, “This is a murder case we are investigating so don’t take it lightly.” Greg stood in the background with a sullen expression on his face. “Cheer up boss we will get to the bottom of this,” Phil said, “I am sure someone will remember him. He has three assistants and a data operator, an accountant as well as a receptionist. Someone would have had a proper interaction with him.”
“I sent him away.”
“Splendid! Where are we going and when do we set off for that journey then?”
“One of the paramedics. Jeffrey, he worked with me under my command.”
And yet here he was, stuck in this rut. Somehow he felt very sorry for him and his condition. At the same time he also felt a compelling urge to help this man in any way he possibly could.
With no other choice, Mycroft opted to wait for Greg and find out more straight from the horse’s mouth.
John gave him a quizzical glance, “Explain that.”
“Just this one last place BB,” he said and turned the car towards the highway. He drove as fast as he could in the darkness, hoping the garden was open to visitors even after sundown. Despite all the hurry, it took him about half an hour to get there and,
“I’ll be gone for a month,” he said to the only two people who cared, besides Sherlock. One was Molly Hooper in his office and the other was his neighbor and friend Henry Knight. While Molly didn’t ask why and only offered to help or fill-in for him, if needed, during his absence, Henry was a bit curious and asked a few questions. For once John didn’t share the truth with him, instead saying he was away to see an ailing aunt and would be back once she had recovered. He got the time off easily, since he had not taken a single day off in two years and had enough leave balance left.
John knew it was hard to keep things from Sherlock, the only downside to living with this man. So he confessed readily.
“What’s with all this anger? Because I took the diamonds from you?”
“You’ll be fine now sir,” Ben said as he drove.
John realized something was seriously wrong. Mike had sounded so ebullient and cheerful before he had left the property. Now he sounded as if he was weighed down by some burden. He was not only sullen but also a bit afraid of something or someone. “Guys,” he called out, “If there is something I must know then please call it out loud and clear. I don’t do well with riddles, I am one for clear, crisp communication.”
“You’re welcome. It’s personalized, I mean the shirt. Monogrammed with your initials on the cuffs and front pocket. Hope it fits you well.”
But they hadn’t seen the last of Jim as another message arrived shortly afterwards. ‘Johnny boy, ask Sherlylocks if he has found the cock and bull bomb yet – JM’
A photo of John with a Madam Tussaud’s statue. In that he was leaning in close to the statue’s bosom to read some note stuck there about the ballerina, whose wax effigy it was. Behind him was another blond woman and a brunette, both laughing.
He knew he could never harbor hopes or love with the same spirit and passion again, forget about being happily married and an optimistic man. He was now an empty shell, a dried out husk who was alive but not really living. Something had indeed died inside him.
John’s jaw had dropped.
“A hundred and sixty million Jim took, using you and the information you shared innocently with him. Then Sebastian happily lapped up another seventy five million from me, in the form of casino shares and a luxury penthouse of 6000 square feet. I feel bloody robbed and looted.”
“Ms. Morstan, Mr. Bouffler,” Gretel tapped politely on the door, “The master is calling for you.”
“Do you have a stammer? A
John was blissfully unaware of the dirty tricks Phil had employed, through Pierre or this waiter, so spoke with genuine concern. “You okay Sherlock? What are you doing?” He turned to the waiter, “How can you be so careless? This is your day to day job, right?”
John hung up and stared at Sebastian sadly, both of them uneasy and unable to reconcile with their decision of lying to their mates. They didn’t want to keep lying to themselves that all was well when all wasn’t well by a mile. “I feel horrible inside,” Sebastian said as they walked away from the public call booth, “They are always so eager to see us, so happy when we are together, I mean, I am very happy too, I am a very different and a better person when I am with Jimmy. Are we doing the right thing here John? Maybe we have made a mistake of some kind.”
, I’d do everything possible to ensure he’s safe and happy and healthy. Don’t ask me please….. or you may ask, but I warn you I might sound cheesy. True love isn’t about gaining control or ownership over someone, making them yours in some way etc. It’s about doing the best for them.”
Sherlock felt a bit bad about his outburst and sighed, giving her a reconciliatory look. “I am not angry with you Lucy, just with the circumstances that made John leave the house. I am not an eighteenth century woman who was hounded by everyone as soon as she hit eighteen years of age, telling her that her life’s goal is to find a man. There were good reasons to do that then, nowadays nobody here, man or woman, is put through such an ordeal. I want all talks about my suitors, admirers, my marriage, engagement, affairs to cease immediately. Any further mentions and there will be trouble, including dismissal.”
“Then may I ask why you allow him such liberties?” Victor snapped at him. Immediately Eva slapped her fiancé’s wrist and said, “Come on, I am sure Sherlock knows what he is doing.” But this time around Sherlock didn’t stay quiet and let others think as they saw fit. He had found a bit of a voice, thanks to John’s presence and subsequently his absence, and he was determined not to let go of it. “He is right E,” he said with a resigned look, “I have been a bit of a doormat and sometimes that comes across as boring, people find me easy to dominate. I have allowed my awkwardness and inexperience rule me for too long. Maybe that’s why I haven’t dated anyone yet, probably that’s why Phil thinks he rules me, maybe that’s exactly why John just abruptly disappeared……”
His senses on overdrive, his mouth watering, every fiber of his body screaming for release, John pushed his rock hard erection inside. He took time, knowing he was larger than the usual guy, and waited for the brunette to adjust. When Sherlock stopped squirming and breathed out, he pushed in a few more inches, then a little more. Finally, when he was buried root to tip and his balls touched Sherlock’s buttocks, he took a few deep breaths to compose himself. Sherlock’s faltering erection jerked and came alive again and he innocently grabbed John’s hand and guided it to his cock, presumably to make him stroke the awakening member and keep him aroused as ever.
“Jawn…?”
Sherlock sighed. No way was he going to say ‘Shall we go then? You can watch it a second time!’ Nah, he was just not that forward, neither did he want to sound overtly eager.
“Hello cuz,” Sebastian smiled like a shark. His teeth, set in a perfect row, were dazzling white. Sherlock hadn’t noticed it the last time he’d seen him in that men’s room at the theater. For a moment, as that smiling face turned towards him, he thought he saw one tooth sparkle, much like one would see in cartoons or read about in novels.
“Aaaaaaahhhh…..”
“Even the third one does.”
“Jimmy….”
“Yeah,” he said, “It’s me. But do you know me?”
“What point? What the fuck Sherlock, you’re
“It’s mine, if course,” John smiled, “I bought it only yesterday. Enough of trains, I say. Do you like it?” Sherlock gave the car a closer look and shrugged, “It’s okay. No, it’s nice actually.” Then came the awkward silence, which so often existed between the two social misfits, with neither man saying anything further and simply looking here and there. While Sherlock hoped John would ask him to ride with him, John was expecting the younger man to simply seize the opportunity and take a seat next to him. Just like he had done a couple of days earlier with Phillip Andersen.
, in New Becket Village. I hope you have a great time here with your friends. I think you should be exploring the town even more. Lots of places to see, they have cultural events every Friday evening and Saturday evenings….. alright, I gotta go now good sir, that pouch would be a nice purchase.”
“He very well might have,” Mrs. Hudson smiled and replied gently, “He is a thirty year old man and naturally it’s time for him to settle down. I am sure even you want him happy, you want to see him married to someone who can give him the support, love and status he deserves. He is he son of a wealthy and reputed man, himself an achiever and highly educated, nothing but the best for him!”
John pointed to not one but two different suits laid out on the bed. One was charcoal grey in color, a tuxedo complete with a bow-tie, with a proper broad belt and sash. The slacks beneath were narrow and entirely formal in their cut and fall. The other was a light green blazer with a semi-formal thick cream shirt and pair of off-white comfort fit trousers made of fine silk and wool blend. There was also a small velvet box between them, as was a single long stemmed rose and a box of expensive Belgian Pralines, Sherlock’s favorite. “Of course these clothes can be laundered too,” John said timidly, feeling as if he should apologize for something, “I can ask them to take it but maybe later….. I sensed your embarrassment and didn’t want the clumsy waiter to hang around. I have a laundry bag with me, just put the things in it and we’ll leave it at the door…..”
“Oh hi Will,” Mike still called him ‘Will’, short for William, “Thanks for making it.”
John: 'Because this is mine.'
It was his mummy and daddy and Jim’s parents and all of them looked at him with expressions that spoke of only two things -
In two more chapters things will slowly resolve and the knots will untie
“Why would the local folks kill themselves?” Sebastian asked, “
Sherlock was crying tears of joy but also trembling with fear. He was worried about what might happen when Jim got to know he was about to make a few changes in their ‘arrangement’.
“The fish, I think cod is a better idea than salmon.”
“You got me, you always do with one of you completely logical examples nana,” John said with a broad grin, shoulders shaking. As he continued to chat with the matriarch, he quietly made up his mind to gift that plot to Sherlock. All of it and not just a part or a strip. He didn’t even think it was necessary to seek counsel of his grandmother anymore. She had just given him the answer. People you love or care about, you have every right to give them something that makes their lives easier. In Sherlock’s case, it was a token of appreciation as well as a way to make him feel like an equal. He didn’t want the young man to consider himself less than John or anyone else related to John.
“Thanks…. Pleasure is all mine Siobhan,” Sebastian was unprepared for the moment but composed himself swiftly, “You won’t believe it but we were talking to them just now, rather John just spoke and we made an excuse we are going to London for a couple of days.” The women and two older men stared at them in confusion before John intervened and interjected on behalf of his friend, “Yes, it’s what you are probably thinking. We also suspected something could be very wrong and wanted to find out what it is before investigating. I hope you are here for the same reason. If you are here to cover up and bury some skeletons then I’m afraid we aren’t the right people for that.”
“Excuse me, the Queen is calling me?”
“No, I already do.”
It started tentative, a soft peck on the lips, before he graduated to insistent rubbing of the soft flesh, until John’s mouth opened and he allowed Sherlock’s lips to touch his tongue. That triggered an immediate response from the younger man whose lips parted instantly and soon their tongues were entwined, rubbing and battling for dominance.
She eyed the main door, visible from the kitchen door, across the drawing room on her right side. The drawing room was a longish one and she had to run about six to seven meters to reach the door. Once she was at the porch she could get into her Beetle, which was parked right next to the porch under the makeshift canopy created by good old William, her friend.
“Yes, yes, they are okay. But whether they would be so in the long term depends on whether you cooperate with us or not. We can explain but for now you need to trust us and come with us. We shall congregate at the next village, St Ignatius, about five miles from here. We are a small place and the town is also fairly well known, we could easily be discovered in either of the places by our brothers.”
“Yes, the same. He’s as brilliant as Sherlock but far more cruel, brutal and psychopathic. Speak about using a gift given by God for all the purposes He would disapprove of.”
Sherlock had waited until they were in the attic, where there were scant chances of anyone trespassing or overhearing them. He had been tired of pretending, wary of Jim’s mind games and Sebastian turning out to be John’s cousin was the proverbial last straw for him. He was angry and annoyed and didn’t make any attempt at hiding his feelings and raw emotions.
Escape was quite possible. She braced herself for the moment, took a deep breath, took off her shoes and made a mad dash for the main door. Instantly she heard that bloodcurdling growl.
“As for this woman,
Gosh, they were a creepy lot and their intentions sent up a
He flicked his tongue over the slit on his lover’s cock and Sherlock’s entire body jerked hard as he came. John tried to hold back but his body took over and even before Sherlock had emptied his balls fully in his mouth, his orgasm crashed upon him.
“So then….the interview?”
“I want to help you. Or, I know someone who could help you. Trust me on this, once you meet him you will be charmed. You’ll know you’ve come to the right man. He’s changed many people’s lives and will gladly do the same for you too. At a fee of course.”
John seemed to be frozen in disbelief. His eyes wore a dazed expression and he became speechless for several seconds. When he recovered from it eventually he turned towards Sherlock and spoke about his gratitude so lucidly and humbly, with such modesty and reverence, that his host began to feel embarrassed. “You don’t have to thank me so much or so many times Jawn,” Sherlock stated kindly, “I am not doing anything extra for you. We have a large house, we have plenty of staff and we don’t get visitors as often as we used to when mummy and daddy were around. We could all use some company, isn’t that so Hudders, Haines, BB?” He turned towards them eagerly, hoping they would all chime in.
“Why not?”
“Greg. Not Grover. Okay, so there was a chest in John’s mother’s room which he had asked you to get rid of, since he assumed it was filled with junk. You forgot to do that and kept it in the closet you shared with John. Some time ago John found that chest and it was filled with cash, loose jewels and deeds to a couple of properties that even John was not aware of. Apparently his mum wanted to give them to her daughter, John’s sister Harry, and the contents of the chest were worth nearly double the amount of the necklace. You had it all along and never even touched it. That sort of shows you aren’t a thief. Someone burgled the house and put the blame on you.”
Sherlock almost did a facepalm. But he had to ask the question. “But why is that so Mr. Freeman? It is a damaged piece, is it?”
“He never showed any slacking at work.”
“Why are you staring at your own shoes John?”
“They did us a favor,” Sebastian was consumed by a need to fuck Jim now, “I’m stone hard.”
“Right now sir?”
“Great. That means we will both have a similar purpose. Hey, don’t worry, we will get through this together as we have been for the past few years, ever since we turned eighteen.”
“Sherlock? Sherl? Where did you get lost?”
“Yeah, erm….is that okay?”
He felt the need to acknowledge the support his girlfriend had provided. First that, then anything else. “Thank you Mary.”
“That’s the problem Jawn,” Sherlock said, “I was just curious and going through the kind of pastimes you have, hobbies you have stopped indulging yourself in, philanthropy which is so important to you and this caught my attention. Otherwise no one would have suspected him at all. Usually we trust those who have been with us for years and mostly that trust is quite logical and validated. But some people, despite their long association with us, tend to stray off the right path at some point of time. Maybe it’s increased demands from a new wife, debts accumulated due to some gambling habits, just plain greed because they feel no one is watching them and they can take liberties.”
The next time he woke up four hours had passed and it was already a quarter past ten. John looked peacefully asleep so Sherlock decided to let him get as much rest as he needed. He’d rather leave the bed and step out of the room instead of making John uncomfortable with shifting, turning and sounds of doors and drawers opening and closing.
“I-I see….but no, I do not have that problem. I have….sincerely I have no clue what’s happened to me. Maybe it’s just you.”
John licked a hot strip up Sherlock’s neck, across his jawline and then the shell of his ear. The younger man thrashed about, his wiry limbs jerking and shaking, a look of pure need on his beautiful and rose-flushed face. With his hairs all askew, his eyes darker with lust, his nude body all spread out like marmite on toast, he was the most amazing creature John had ever seen. He attacked the twin nubs on Sherlocks chest with his lips, teeth and tongue, making him keen beautifully.
“No, I am good, it’s fine….” Sherlock went back into the bedroom and heaved a sigh of relief. What a near miss! He was about to finish typing the response to Jim when a thought struck him suddenly. “Wait,” he murmured, “Wait, wait, how did he know the tea had gone cold? Did he taste it after pouring it or did he just touch the exterior of the teapot and……”
Yes, this time he was sure he had heard it right.
“….??....!!”
She gave him a shy smile before she left and was soon replaced at the doorway by a rather peeved Janet.
“Doesn’t matter. But your apology is accepted.”
“I haven’t…..”
By and by Sherlock discovered a new Belstaff coat in medium ash-grey, a big jar of the product he used on his hairs to settle and style his curls, a Hugo Boss cologne, a book on the lives of famous violinists and finally…..the Black Pearl ship from the Pirates of the Caribbean series.
“How many cars?” Sherlock asked as they entered the inner sanctum of the property, which was cordoned off by a stone wall, electric fencing, dozens of cameras and security devices and a large automated gate that was manned 24/7 by a group of armed men and dogs.
“What? What did you say Greg? Oh God, no, no please, please don’t tell me you agree with him. Damn, yes you do, don’t you? You believe him.”
“I am going to pick a ring. It’s going to be almost two months since you came here and while everything else in my life remains the same, my entire outlook, perspective, mood, spirit, situation seems to have changed…. For the better of course. Sometimes when I wake up next to you I think ‘I don’t know what’s really changed but I don’t want to know, I am just very happy’. I really didn’t think someone could make such a difference to my life, that too in such a short time…..”
John did as he was asked and finally caught a sight of Sherlock. His first reaction was to close his eyes and send up a prayer.
“Huh?”
He also saw some brochures and remembered an advertisement he had seen years ago on the internet. Adding two and two he tried to form the whole picture.
,” John felt the need to stop him at that point because the whole conversation was getting completely blown off course, “It’s
John pointed at the work on his desk, “Very well then. We will do all of those things and you won’t have to do them alone. Give me an hour to finish here and we will both do all that you just mentioned, biking, picnic, speedboat, the whole nine yards. Happy now?”
Sherlock knew of a thousand reasons to say no. He knew that if he turned and ran off he could easily justify his actions later, no matter how crazy they seemed right now. But he was dismayed to hear himself say ‘Yes, I suppose we could go there for a bit.’
“Not the right time for jokes.”
“Yes sir, please do, recharge your batteries,” Haines added with a smile.
Actually, there were
It all started with me saying John was the wife in our relationship.
. The other man hadn’t noticed John either and had his back turned towards John the entire time. “Oh, sorry,” Sherlock said apologetically, “John please meet Phillip Andersen. Phil heads our sales team at the college. Thanks to him we have so many sponsors and collaborators. His team also designs all the student packages.”
“ME?” Sherlock pointed at his own chest.
“Sleep then,” Sherlock said curling into his John, “I got you.”
“Catch your breath,” Sherlock laughed.
"How can I be honest when I don't even know"
If we have come all this way, let’s see if Jawn takes the ultimate step or not. With that thought, Sherlock smiled a bit balefully and rose to his feet. “Yes sure, I shall go and change. I’ll hand over my clothes to you in five minutes. Please make sure there are no stains on it.”
“Huh,” he blinked, “I was thinking we could have a drink at your flat after work….this evening.”
. Sherlock was about to be a
“Spy?” Sherlock frowned, “Informer? Why do we even need one?”
Mycroft,” he said dryly, giving up on an effort to cover himself because a naked Sherlock refused to budge from his arms.
Mycroft and Greg got a start when they heard Harry’s name. “Harry told you that name?” Greg asked, deciding to double check.
“What favor?”
Sherlock dropped on top of him bonelessly, making a whiny sound.
“He responded favorably. Other names agitated him but this one made him smile.”
“Oh…. Ka-ay….” Sherlock wasn’t sure which way it was going. He just waited for John to finish.
“Jim, I need to talk to you, alone,” he pleaded with his boyfriend of two years, “I was not aware that a third person knows about this. I don’t even know who this man is and…..”
Sherlock turned in his arms, “You-You mean…..?”
As soon as the two men sat at the table, almost ignoring him, Phil decided he had had enough of this. Without even giving the couple a chance to settle down, he started firing at them right away, venting out all his frustrations. “What the hell is this man, huh?” He demanded, staring at John, “You tell me to be here a little ahead of time and come in thirty minutes late?! What kind of behavior is this?” He turned towards the other man, “And Sherlock, I had been looking for you and you had left the campus already? Couldn’t you have given me a call or answered one of my calls at least?”
Once they were in his tiny but neatly appointed cabin, she leaned against the desk and said, “What are you doing this weekend doc?”
When John gave him the address Mike turned up his nose. “Sorry but that’s what I can afford on a soldier’s pension,” John said with good humor, “I need to eat and pay other bills too.” His former college mate seemed to agree but he had his own views besides. “We need to
John shot up from the bed, stung. Oh God, this was a very wrong move, no, I have been making a series of very wrong moves. “She likes you,” he tried to placate Sherlock somewhat, “She is a fan of your work.”
“I wasn’t worried,” she quipped, “Though he tried his best to make me so!”
“But then…what about our house in London?”
“Nope, so I can measure your femur! Of course Sherl, I am a man and I need sex. It’s been a while and I want you,
“Yeah, but she could have forgiven him.”
“Oh don’t you worry your pretty head over it,” John said with an assuring smile at his young lover, then looked at the bare arm Sherlock had exposed by taking off his shirt, “This is not exactly a minor scratch but nothing worrisome either. But frankly, what puzzles me is how did you manage to get it? Who the hell gave it to you? Did you scrape your arm on something sharp in your house or lab?”
“Give it a rest doc,” Mrs. Hudson called out, “There is no need to deny something that is as conspicuous as a pink elephant in the corner of a board room. Not looking at it wouldn’t make it go away, you know. Now come on, let’s help Sherlock to the bathroom. He won’t use the thing here on the bed.”
Second later he felt warmth splatter on his thighs as Sherlock came hard. His epic orgasm followed seconds later. Along with it came a realization that with every round his orgasm was not weakening, it was becoming more and more intense and pleasurable.
“You aren’t even gonna ask me how am I doing? Does it not hurt you that your fella is sleeping with someone else?”
John looked on, not turning the light out immediately.
The knee knocking and jittery nerves had lessened; Sherlock looked ready to give John his attention for a while.
“You didn’t answer for yourself yet,” Sebastian waggled his brows, “What’s up with you and your sex life? I know you showed me a pic of the two girls you dated, Jenny from the high school days and later your neighbor Rachel.”
Sherlock had had a torrid time in the past two weeks, from the moment he had been woken by Haines and told that Stacy had fainted on seeing the blood and Mrs. Finch was possibly dead. Then he had to look at that face, horrors of the night and her last moments visible on it, then had come the invasion of cops, media and forensic experts. The ordeal had been draining on his emotions and he had resisted from informing Mycroft, lest he ruined his brother’s conference and holiday.
“Oh yes, there surely will be,” Greg replied, “So allow me to introduce my client and the work you are expected to do. My client is a multi-billionaire. He’s no ordinary billionaire who barely touches the thousand million mark or a seasonal billionaire whose net worth is tied only in stocks and if the stock market crashes, so does his wealth. He comes from old money, landed gentries, traditional companies and investments and art and jewelry collections to rival the Queen’s. But, unlike the Queen, this man can sell anything he owns. There isn’t any ‘no-sale’ clause anywhere. I won’t go into specifics but he has huge shares in 118 companies, investments that are safe and fool-proof with progressive, profitable benefits, thirty properties across the world, over 600 precious and priceless paintings and sculptures and jewels worth over a billion. Total net worth, way more than twenty billion and growng.”
“Well, I will tell you as much as you need to know but you must assure me first that you understand your position here. You have signed legal contracts which are so water-tight that there’s no way out of jail if even half a clause is broken or tampered with. It’s my duty to protect the interests of my client but I don’t wish for any harm to come to you either, hence I am checking with you.”
“Hope?”
“Oh yeah? I think it’s the spirit of our dead mother sitting on your shoulder, eh? You idiot, you foolish ass! You are such a coward. No excuses,
“Of course,” John opened out his arms,.
“I really want to marry you. I don’t want this to end Sherlock, not in six months nor in sixty. I want us to be together, grow old together, share his life, this home, this wealth, everything.”
“Hey,” he nudged the taller man, feeling delighted at the sudden physical contact and the chance of a conversation, “It’s been an early start to the day for both of us. Take a nap maybe?”
An enormous amount of satisfaction surrounded John like a warm, fluffy blanket in the cold weather. Sherlock had been quite hungry after going without food the entire day so the cake, the sandwiches, the pizza and the chips had been polished off almost down to crumbs. Jim had pecked at the food but Mycroft had dug in gleefully. John hadn’t eaten dinner so he too had done justice to the fare, his appetite stoked by the sight of Sherlock actually enjoying his meal.
Try he did. He tried to satisfy John in various ways by fisting him, grinding against him, using a toy and eventually he even fucked him once. But while each time John came faithfully within five or ten minutes, he was anew after each release in less than half an hour.
“Who goes there?” He called out loud, more to regain his courage than to be heard. It was so quiet and silent there that even a whisper was bound to be heard from a hundred meters away. He got no responses but soon he heard a series of tell-tale signs of someone’s presence close by. Twigs breaking, branches snapping, soil scattering, leaves rustling, pebbles getting crushed.
The next moment John was inches away from him. The towel had miraculously vanished. The huge, hard and leaking cock dangled right before his parted lips. “Come on,” John rubbed the blunt and wet head of his manhood on Sherlock’s cheek, hissing at the pleasurable feeling of the slight stubble rasping against it, “Make yourself useful and suck it.”
The rest of the day and most of the evening passed uneventfully. But there were several things that made the green-eyed youngster slack jawed in awe. Sherlock realized that living on this estate and in this palatial house was no less than enjoying a stay in a premium five-star hotel. The lunch and dinner served there were all seven course meals. There were six refrigerators in the galley. The chef in the kitchen actually took orders and whipped up whatever was asked of her. He really didn’t have to lift a finger, all his work was done for him at the mere twitch and snap of two fingers.
She heard a crashing noise and the sounds of glass breaking and then the sound of her bed breaking too. Or maybe it was half broken but definitely some wood cracked. No, this could not be one of the two cats she owned. Some time ago she had heard her mastiff barking. But Coco was not barking any longer. That was strange. If there was an intruder she would be bringing the house down with her barking. She had been trained pretty well by a young boy she knew, someone who trained dogs to support senior citizens. Her heart thumping loud in her ears now, she grabbed an axe and armed herself with a taser gun as well, just in case. There were no valuables in the house nowadays, she had given them off to her children and grandkids, so the thief would find nothing but her, only her, and take out their ire on her perhaps.
“I am at a nightclub,” Jim said irritably and then shut a door, emerging from what appeared to be a very noisy room or area. “Having a drink and no, I am not dancing or flirting with other men. Other men are flirting with me though and that I can’t help. Now don’t you start off with your nagging and whining about me enjoying while you pimp yourself for cash. I have sustained us for two years, you need to show me the man you are and make some arrangement for us for a lifetime.”
As the holidaying group settles in, Jim and Sherlock are anxious about the future. In the meantime, Irene and Molly get a nocturnal visitor.
“Oh, I am sorry. No, I was just…..”
“Nooooo!!!”
“No, you said something very similar to what my mother used to say. She was a very enterprising lady, very socially active, a philanthropist at heart, full of compassion and ideas and rarely ever relaxed and laidback. Energy was her main propellant, her quirky ideas the secondary engine she lived by and sometimes I struggled to keep up with the way she used to surge ahead with her plans and actions.”
“Tum-ti-dum-di-dummm, I am a millionaire hummmm!”
For some reason John loved listening to his violin so he practiced every day, worked on the charities and accounts, managed some of John’s communications and kept reading and experimenting on the field of his own education and expertise. Not for a moment had he forgotten that he was a chemical engineer, with an aspiration to become a scientist. There was a long way to go and he wanted to succeed there, not just ride the gravy train of John’s vast and dazzling fortunes.
Sherlock felt his heart leap in his chest. John was in his ‘civvies’, a pair of light blue jeans and a dark green T shirt on top. With his hairs casually rumpled and a friendly grin on his face, the sunlight streaming down on him like a ‘blessing’ from above, he looked young and fresh and very, very gorgeous. His eyes were sparkling pools of chocolate and his features had softer contours than the usual angular sharpness he saw in people. It made John appear approachable, kind, interesting!
“Jawn, believe me, I never meant any harm. I had turned Jim down, told him I won’t hurt you or steal from you and that’s why he turned on me. Tell me, if I was with and we were scheming together, then wouldn’t I have run off by now, knowing Sebastian
“Some people never get the hint nor understand when to back off,” John said with a slight shake of his head, “Once an asshole, always a prized asshole. Never mind. Listen, your pre-lunch classes end at 12-30 PM, right? Just leave the campus right away and come to the art gallery across the street. Yeah, ‘First-Point Art Gallery’. I want you to meet someone there at 12-45 sharp.”
“Start right from the beginning, from the time you left home after our disagreements and fights and the blowup with dad, right up to yesterday when I found you by the highway. I don’t want you to leave anything to imagination or guess, I want every single detail from you. I have more tea brewed, I have breakfast ready, so we can talk while we eat.”
John chuckled despite the way it sounded. Some things would never change but then he wouldn’t have it any other way!
around it.
He clutched his laptop bag and cell phone, a spring in his step as the sun shone on his face and the wind sifted through his hairs. But as he walked closer and closer to the train station, his smile faded and his steps slowed down. All those familiar spots and stops where John usually waited for him just passed by. No signs of John anywhere.
“No, no, I am not a homophobic man, no.”
Sherlock was about to open his mouth and argue but he decided against it. He knew just how much John hated it when he didn’t consider their combined wealth, or the money John had bequeathed to him, as his own. “You are right,” he said with a knowing smile, “It’s my money too. But you know what I mean…. I was talking about something that I have worked for and earned on my own.”
“But it’s too late already,” Mrs. Hudson said, appearing a bit uncomfortable.
“I know you always wanted to stay across the Pond. US of A.”
“If by not asking you the obvious things I can change possibilities, if by turning a blind eye to reality we might vouch for a secure and hassle free future for the two of you, then by all means I shall not be a naysayer anymore.”
“You do realize that I might not be able to afford the flat if I don’t have this job?” John sighed.
Sherlock gasped, “Mary???”
“Was there any chitchat and small talk about my suitors, possible marriage, admirers, all that nonsense while I was not around Lucy? And was John around when such talks went on?”
“Mrs. Hudson, I am about to go to the court, we have a big case today.”
“Yes. He got out of that only a month ago. After that he’s been locked up in his bedroom. He hasn’t emerged from it, not even for a moment. Even his sister hasn’t been able to get through to him. We are all very afraid he might give up one day. We might have to break in and what we’d discover might not be very pleasing to the eye….. in fact, it could be all over,” Greg paused and shrugged, getting up and walking a few paces towards the window, “Sherlock please, if you’ve been in therapy and he’s attempted to take his own life and then locked himself up in his room for days, shunning company and a normal life…. What do you think that means my friend? You both love each other, enough to almost destroy yourselves when you were driven apart. Then at least try one last time. See if you can get through to him….. Sherlock?”
At some point he felt a weight on his shoulder and found Sherlock had dozed off.
He climbed on top of Sherlock and kissed him, licking his lips and chin clean. Sherlock moaned and writhed, John’s forcefulness causing his arousal to spike as well. He was as hard as John, dick standing proud and erect and he tried to get some relief by palming it slightly.
“Yes we are,” Sally intervened, “We are from the Yard. Special investigations team.”
The lunch had turned out to be an awesome one and Sherlock found John to be an amazing man. His attractive and suave looks were not even top ten in terms of his qualities. He was well-read and articulate, had a great sense of humor and wit, he was energetic and enthusiastic and shared some common interests with Sherlock. One of them was their mutual love for Italian food, their interests in art history and a fondness for swimming and hiking. So, a week after they had first met, they went hiking up the hills and John got him to a nice secluded spot where an almost crystalline pond was revealed.
! Next his eyes lingered over to the digital clock on the nightstand which said it was 2:21 am. God, this was going to be a long night.
,” John murmured as he got out of the stationary car to survey the dead animal that Sebastian had tried his best to avoid at the last moment but couldn’t save, “It was a cat…. A rather large and wild cat…. Never knew they had these kinds of felines in these parts. It’s not that heavily wooded.”
Sherlock went over and knelt next to the couch, staring into the other man’s sleeping face. John looked much younger in repose, as if a sheen of care and worries, tension and anxiety, uptightness and stiffness of demeanor, it was all gone and what was left behind was the man in his most natural, normal form. He reached out to touch John’s face but withdrew. He wasn’t very sure he should do that.
“It’s the case Jawn.”
“I would expect nothing other than honesty Mary,” Sherlock stated, “Especially from you. You have been my grandmother’s nurse once, when you were interning about fifteen years ago. We have known each other for quite a while.” She seemed more at ease at his assurance and said, “Well, during the summer break you’re usually here three times a week with some of the patients from the shelter, for their regular therapies, vaccinations, regular health checkups and diagnostics etc. For the past nine days, he has been watching you discreetly. He finds you fascinating, from the way you talk and walk and look. He finds everything about you utterly charming. The three times he has seen you so far, I can assure you those are the only times he seems to be happy, hopeful, cheerful.”
“Yeah, sure. We are done! And it’s getting a bit late too, almost four-thirty pm.”
Of course Jim didn’t ask and Sherlock hadn’t expected him to. Jim and he always had a competition going on. Earlier there would be cases and crime but with Jim turning part legit and keeping all his crimes out of England there was a different kind of competition between them. Who would read the most books in a week, who completed the most experiments, who understood the latest election results better, who figured out an old case and zeroed down on the criminal even without doing any field investigation, who managed to have more rounds of sex with their ‘Military man’, the list was endless. Sherlock knew Jim was envious for two reasons – one, he had probably never had such a sex-a-thon before and two, he was upset that Sherlock was now the inventor of the purple pill.
about?”
In a week’s time John already began to feel like a new person. Rigorous training but mixed with fun elements made him look forward to his lessons rather than be put off by the 16 hour days with his new mentor. Greg was an immensely interesting individual, very knowledgeable and witty, and it was a pleasure to learn from him. His methods were on-the-job, kinesthetic and diagnostic in style, perfect for adults. He was not preachy nor prescriptive and made things sound simple and easy, besides always offering a logic behind each instruction he gave John.
The trio from the Yard had reached the shop as soon as it had opened on Monday. The other two stores which sold the Hublot hadn’t sold this piece hence it was down to this one. If not this then things would move to online and the field would open up too wide, making it near impossible to narrow down to one buyer. But it seemed they were out of luck here as well. “Can you give us the details of this man at least?” Phillip Anderson asked, “Morton.”
“Forgive her,” Reginald snickered, “She likes a big, full nest with all her children around her. Since Eurus will be leaving soon and setting up her own house, she wants at least one of the sons married and the son in law to be living under her roof.”
“Did I say I wanna do anything like that? Seriously Sherly, at the end of the day we have to look after ourselves, don’t we?”
“I would be more comfortable if we found out the exact cause of death and who, if anyone, was behind it,” said Lord Edwin, “After that, based on facts proved and put on the table, we can relax and continue to live in peace in our wonderful town. Imagine, if this is indeed a psycho?”
. I am taking Jawn home with me and if you want to stop me, you have to get a warrant in his name. My lawyer is here and I have checked, you do NOT have sufficient grounds to keep him here or in custody. If you try and stop me now or bother him again without a reason I will complain about you. I’ll speak to your superiors, I’ll tell them you and your team are harassing my friend.”
John wondered aloud, “Why on earth did we meet them if we had to lose them so swiftly?”
“No,” John stood up, ready to leave, “No, I am not staying here a moment longer and listening to some plan for murder.”
“You lied at every step. You and Jim are lovers. You cheated on me and Jim cheated on Sebastian.”
He saw a man wearing jeans, sneakers and a hoodie. Even in the darkness he was wearing oversized glasses. One could hardly make out what he looked like, much less who he was. Greg spotted a French beard and nothing else. “Well Baker, I am a policeman after all so I get all kinds of visitors. Grant him access to the building. I shall answer the door only when I see he’s got real business with me. If I ask him to leave and he refuses, I’ll deal with him.”
Sherlock stared at his feet, shocked by his own lapses and the liberties he had taken. But the biggest shock of them all was the way he had enjoyed the kiss, the intimacy, those touches. Cheeks red, his eyes watery, hairs disheveled, ears and groin overheated, he knew he looked like a pretty hot mess right now. Never one at a loss for words, he felt totally bereft of words at this moment.
John took it and shook it. He has a firm grip, brisk movements. Not some slow, dependent chap with little between his two ears. Good choice. “Pleased to meet you finally,” he said in a firm, low voice, “You can call me John. Later we can come up with a nickname as well, to sound real.”
“Rubbish. You were always successful, always been very, very rich.”
“Thanks! How about the note?”
John knew he had no reasons to be upset. Sherlock didn’t belong solely to him. He had a family too, even if that was just a lone sibling, maybe even friends and social acquaintances. John was certainly not his only priority. After all it was only a matter of a day and he’s be back the next.
“Oh sorry, hello. I am Sherlock.”
“I will agree on one condition,” Sherlock said as the butler left the room with John’s bags, “You will reconcile with your sister, Harriet. Consider that your engagement gift to me.”
Something fishy is going on
Yeah this is different, slower pace, the boys will take their time to finally unite and Mary has to go....all duly noted :))
John wished he could disappear.
“Sebastian, please, I am not gay. I am just….you know sometimes it happens, boys and their libido, sometimes the situation is such….”
“Don’t ramble, be articulate.”
Why hadn’t he thought about it? Now he could see things,
After a good long swim John grabbed his ankle and dragged him under, making him surface a little later spluttering and choking. The two of them pushed and pulled and jostled in the water before a sudden maneuver made them come so close that going back was impossible after that.
“John does not smoke.”
, entering that wooden shed.
“Yes Mr. Watson. For the new John to emerge from the shell, the old John must actually die. The trick is not only to learn new things but also unlearn quite a bit. For the next four weeks, please trust me and hand yourself over to me and my team completely. You can do this if you set your mind to it and agree to pick things up fast. Slow and steady may win some races and Rome wasn’t built in a day, two golden proverbs used by lazy asses who want to put things off till tomorrow. You must learn and learn quickly, sometimes on the fly.”
“Nope. Not that either.”
“It’s too soon and I haven’t done this before.”
He wanted to think about it and possibly even investigate but Sherlock was near relentless in his efforts to get John into a place as private as possible. Only a week ago John would have done the same, he would have lauded and supported those efforts, but today the mere thought of sex and isolation filled him with dread.
“I have waited long enough,” Jim was fogging up the windows and already taking off his shirt and denim jacket, “Four days away from the village and then nearly five hours in the fair, lollygagging and just whiling away the time when we should have been fucking like bunnies.”
In the darkness he could see the outline of a figure on the bed. Yes, yes, yes, just a few more steps and my work will be done, mission accomplished, a year of searching and planning finally bearing fruition! Yes, this time I will have my pound of flesh.
If Sherlock was astonished at how much stamina John had, John was also pleasantly surprised by Sherlock’s rather short and frequent refractory period. In every fifteen minutes to half an hour the younger man would be hard and randy again, ready for the next round, lustful and insatiable to the core.
Mrs. Marlene Patterson lived at the edge of the town, by the riverside, with her two cats and one dog, a Tibetan mastiff. Her house was a bit secluded, with giant trees on both sides and a series of boulders behind, some open space around it which was too rugged to be used for a walkway. So she usually got a lot of privacy, except for two neighboring houses which stood about three hundred meters away on top of a hillock where the land ended. After that there was the river and beyond it was the bridge. One could see the bridge from a distance and hear the sounds of trains that chugged past.
There were many more such instances that seemed cute and pleasant to the good doctor and John found Sherlock’s company more and more enjoyable as the days passed by and he understood the man better. Whereas he used to love working with Sherlock and solving crimes earlier, later he began to enjoy being at home with Sherlock or going out for a meal or to a concert with him just as much. Still, John hadn’t given up in his heterosexual side and still kept seeing women. That side of his, the one with a streak of toxic masculinity, often cried into his ear and kept telling him to be more of the earlier man that he was and take a breather from his sickeningly domestic life with the sleuth and go out and have fun, date, maybe have sex.
“With pleasure!”
“See, I don’t have them on,” Sherlock pointed at his bare groin, “I was free-balling today. It seems none of my underwear was washed so I……”
John made a disgusted face. “Come on, with your powers of deduction I had expected better from you. My parents made a weird set of decisions during their last few years. When my sister came out as a lesbian woman the two homophobes threw her out of the house and cut off all ties. When I joined the army and got my surgeon’s license at the same time, fulfilling their dreams for me, they put everything in my name by disowning my sister. I protested then, told them it should be split into two, but they turned a deaf ear on that. Even then I had said I wanted the suburbia property and not the flat in London.
“Jim,” Greg Lestrade tipped his hat in a mostly dramatic manner, the corners of his eyes crinkling as he greeted the young genius outside the pub, “Look who decided to come out of the lab and into the land of the
“No Jawn, I am no angel. In fact, I have a confession to make.”
“Sherlock
They started snogging right away and the straw underneath them made strange crackling and squeaking sounds as Sherlock let his legs fall apart and pushed a tube of lube into John’s palm. “Someone came all prepared it seems,” John said with a feral look at his lover, “Oh I love you for that you naughty little boy. Now let me show you who is daddy! Come to daddy, come on now, don’t be afraid private!”
“Only on certain nights.”
“You row very well,” Sherlock said to John as they took a rowboat ride on the huge lake, “Seems like you knew the technique well.”
“What…..?” He asked, consciousness fading, “What did you g-givvmeee?” As a doctor he knew what it must feel like to be drugged, though he couldn’t say it was anything dangerous. He felt no pain or discomfiture, only extreme grogginess.
“Oh well, in that case open mine first,” Alice insisted, “I am sure the gift is just ‘made’ for you.”
“Good evening. Hope you’re doing well.”
Irene’s astonishment outweighed her relief, as did Mycroft’s who was standing only a few feet from her and as shocked by the incident. The beast bowed its head and turned towards Sebastian who approached it with an outstretched arm. He placed his hand on its head and stroked it like one would do to a housecat and the ferocious panther licked and nuzzled at his feet like one.
John’s cry was very robust and high pitched and perhaps that was what triggered Sherlock’s orgasm. Seeing the veritably quiet and controlled John lose it like that was the straw that broke his controls. Several choked and strangled cries left him as he came all over John’s hand and his clothes, five streaks of creamy milk shooting out of his throbbing, erupting dick which John stroked through his lover’s orgasm. At one point Sherlock was over-sensitive down there and squirmed and shuddered, at which point John let it go, fingers trailing down to the place where they were joined. Warm semen had already started to trickle out of Sherlock’s hole even though John was still buried deep in there.
“Jawn? What’s going on?”
“Plenty well, better than usual I’d say,” John was smiling a bit too wide and she noticed that, giving him a curious smile. Instantly John put his guard up and said, “Is he in a position to talk to me? Will she do that? Or I can come back later.” Elizabeth nodded and took his arm in a gesture of guidance, “She’s enjoying a rare sit-out on the balcony today, thanks to the excellent weather we have. Let me check the schedule, yeah she’s free at this moment, no shots, treatment, food or change of clothes planned for the next two hours. Even I am going out for a while so it’s good you dropped by. Come along, I’ll take you to her and then take your leave.”
I read the instructions and followed them religiously. Boil water – did. Pour over the cake – Not sure why we need cake in noodles but the package says so, so I took some pineapple pastries and poured the boiling hot water on them. Thought of using the large two pound chocolate cake we had bought the previous day but it would have been too much for us to eat, yeah,
“Mike?”
at a nice restaurant that served French cuisine, Sherlock barely managed to grasp the message and hurriedly said a ‘Yes of course, text the name of the restaurant’ and hung up. John had a client commitment that morning so they hadn’t met. John’s car was with Sherlock, so he knew sooner or later the man would meet him and take the car keys.
“So sexy!”
The restaurant was a façade. Through a backdoor, the men had snuck out and met Mycroft at a private property in the next lane. It was a marathon meeting but Sherlock found a way in and John found himself in a room in that same property, listening in to the tail end of the discourse.
John looked up and smiled at the enthusiastic young man. He was exercising in the gym a couple of days later when Sherlock paid him a surprise visit, with Mike Stamford right on his heels. “Guess what, that fellow Aaron Lockhart has been cheating and swindling you of several million,” Sherlock spoke animatedly, “For the past seven years he has been doing this, giving you details of multiple deposits but all made to the same account. He has been using some names as a cover, then from the backend he’d transfer it to his wife’s name or that of his daughter.”
“The….infamous genius mastermind?” Mary turned to look.
“God, you gave me a scare…..”
John rinsed his mouth, drank some water and then popped a mint in. For a few moments he focused on his breathing until the nausea died down and he felt better again. Then he took his man in a loving hug and whispered softly, his look affectionate and render. “Really? Do you have dragon breath? I wouldn’t have even known about this so-called morning breath had you not mentioned this to me just now. Do I always have a blocked nose or something, huh?” Sherlock snickered and said, “You biased idiot” to which John replied with a “You adorable sexy little thing” and they went on pawing and clawing at each other all the way back to the shores, enjoying the banter and the weather.
“Why are you talking like that?”
“Since breakfast. It’s not that uncommon for you to skip a meal. I haven’t eaten anything since then either.”
“Go on babe.”
“Mrs. Warwick!”
Jim was going to become Richard Brook. Moriarty would be ‘dead’ soon. He would surrender most of his enormous wealth and give Mycroft and Mi6 a dossier of some clients. In exchange he would be granted pardon, immunity, a new identity and the freedom to start his legit businesses. Sebastian and some other members of his web would get the same benefits. From time to time Jim would also engage with Mi6 and Mi5 work, under Mycroft’s supervision of course, and Mycroft was free to pursue his relationship with the mastermind as long as he didn’t work for him in an official capacity, thereby removing all conflicts of interest.
