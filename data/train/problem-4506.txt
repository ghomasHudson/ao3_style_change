“I know, I’m sorry.” Castiel watched as she picked at the corner of her blanket. “It’s just that it sounds like it had parts that I’d consider a date but others that make me wonder if he’s shy or if he isn’t actually interested.”
It was a relief to know she was safe, which meant that Dean was now free to go home. He contemplated getting another ride home but felt like walking would probably burn off the alcohol that was still coursing through his veins. It also gave him a little time to think about the knot that had formed in his gut when Cas announced he was leaving the bar.
Dean’s hands moved to cup Cas’s face, he could see the tears brimming in Cas’s eyes as well and Dean knew the other man was feeling the same was he was.
“All the time.” Not knowing where Cas stood on hickeys, Dean just let himself trail the edge of his jaw along the ridge of Cas’s neck. He smiled to himself when Cas started shifting more eagerly against him and Dean’s need for him grow tenfold. “We haven’t tried it like this have we?”
It was dark outside by the time Castiel realized that he hadn’t gotten out of bed all day. With that knowledge he dragged himself out of bed and spent the next four hours fixing their dorm room and leaving no evidence of their previous night. He had the overwhelming need to make sure their dorm wouldn’t offend Dean or make him any more uncomfortable than Castiel already had so he searched high and low, sorting their clothes that had gotten mixed up, putting back blankets and pillows they’d dragged off their beds, and making it look less like they’d mixed up their day to day lives in a way roommates don’t do.
“Hey everyone, I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who was able to come out tonight. It really means a lot to me and to Cas that you’d come spend this day with him. I also just want to say happy birthday to my better half and let him know how much we all love him and appreciate the things he does for us.”
The area of the map leftover was hundreds of miles. He didn’t know what the fuck they were going to do with this information.
“I can only imagine. He always hated any kind of attention. I’m very glad he’s doing well though, I’ve missed him.” Cas’s half smile fractured something in Dean. Cas had grown so close to Dean’s small little family in their years together, he never really considered that Cas would have been sad to let them go.
A burst of flames pulled Dean out of his spiraling thoughts, drawing his attention to the map Rowena had just lit on fire with a tracking spell. Sam and Jack had been working nonstop to make sure Rowena could complete the spell and it looked like it was succeeding as the flames burned the edges of the paper until there were only a few inches of map left.
If fingers felt that good, he couldn’t imagine what it’d feel like to have all of Dean inside him but for now he’d take what he could get because—
Following a sniff and a quick shake of his head he does. “Anyway—Dinners ready and Sam is waking mom up. Want to go sit down?”
One by one their friends started arriving and the bar grew steadily more crowded. It was great seeing their faces again even if it had only been a few weeks that he’d seen some of them. In their late teens to young twenties none of them thought, even for a second, that there would come a time when life became too hectic to take time out for friends. Now, finding the occasional day to all be in one place felt like a huge feat.
“Yeah she was—“ Dean looked around to see that the consultant had left them, “She was just here but she uh was telling me that this a good beginner uh, toy. I think you should go with this one.”
Obediently as ever, Cas did as asked making sure to get his palm thoroughly wet before bringing it back down to continue his touches. He seemed reserved still… in a way that was starting to make Dean wonder if he’d broken a rule and pushed Cas to do something he really didn’t want to do. Should he have just let Cas take care of himself in the shower?
He kept his features as even-keeled as possible, knowing exactly what she was asking but not wanting to answer her question. He knew she’d been itching to ask him if he had an interest in forming a relationship with this stranger she’d never met but he didn’t want to completely lie to her. He also didn’t want to allow himself time to think about being in a relationship with someone he’d never have.
As much as he liked getting to have sex all day every day, (not literally, though he’d be up for it if Cas ever asked) he and Cas still had an arrangement, and Dean was trying to hold up his end of the bargain.
He let himself feel his pain for a while. He didn’t know how he was going to be around his roommate later and not show how destroyed he was by this, but he had to figured it out. He didn’t want Cas to feel guilty for moving on or getting out there and meeting new people, it had been what Cas wanted from the start. So Dean needed to get his shit together but he needed a minute first.
Castiel nodded along with his answer. “We got hot cocoa at the end of the night and he did pay for that.”
It wasn’t until she started snarling hatred at them that Dean realized just how grotesque the woman looked. Her hair was dark and matted, wildly laying around her pale and sunken face. Despite the angel-juice she had coursing through her, she appeared to be deteriorating and Dean briefly wondered if her body was rejecting the Grace inside of her.
“Well, when someone invites you to hang out with their friends, or at their house, and you have a good time together, generally that means you’re friends.”
After some deep breaths and a map check, they found themselves back into the fray, but this time, together. They fought past the Roman enterprises' booth, maneuvered around a shady businessman named Crowley, were checked out by a company called Sandover, and a stern woman named Naomi tried her best to pull Castiel away, but Dean wouldn’t have it. It wasn’t until they were catching their breath in front of Singer’s Auto booth when a gruff man in overalls asked, “Do either of you idjits know your way around an engine?”
“Cas is pretty cool, when he helped you lead the paintball tournament? He was awesome,” Ben reflected.
“Whoever decided to make it so complicated, huh?” Dean ranted, hand balled into a fist and wrinkling his company list. “All I want is to build cool stuff, and help some people, where do I sign up for that business?”
“I dunno, Cas- she knows everything. Besides Jo has a big mouth and her and Charlie freaked when they found out.”
Turns out, he needed a new mechanical engineer, and someone to balance the books for his humble but impressive car restoration family business.
Cas smiled and opened his mouth to ask more when he heard an annoyed “Huh-hmm” throat clearing sound from his right.
Castiel shows up in the next chapter and things get a lot more interesting! Hope you liked this one!
“That’s true, I guess it won’t be that different,” Dean nodded to himself, carelessly stuffing as many things into his duffle as possible.
After one of their first dates, they entered Dean’s apartment in almost-tears after dinner at a restaurant on the strip, “Where do you even buy an outfit like that?!” Cas exclaimed through his laughter.
“First of all, Asshole. This may be Kansas, but its 2016, gay is in and homophobia is out. Second of all, Cas is an outstanding human being who is nice enough to deal with your bullshit, but I’m not. Treat him with respect or your 1.0 GPA will be the least of your problems.”
Sam starts to get up and reach for Dean as he teeters toward the door when Cas walks back in. “Whoa!” he immediately tosses his bag onto a chair and places his hands on Dean’s arms to steady him.
They talked so easily, and Dean got lost in Cas’ deep soothing voice the same way he got lost in art. Dean loved him so much it scared him. For months they hardly left each other’s side. Dean would work and Cas would go to school, then they would do anything and everything together, adventuring around sin city, making memories.
Cas hesitated, he really should finish the paper, but all he wanted was time with Dean, so he relented. “I would love that, Dean.”
Dean was filled with these fears more and more as he and Cas’ relationship developed. Cas was this amazing, intelligent gorgeous man, who wanted to use his love of languages in order to help other people all around the world. He wanted to experience every part of life that he could, and make enough memories for a thousand lives. Dean admired him to no end, and never wanted to let go of the love and powerful admiration that Cas gave him, but he also was filled with self-doubt. That maybe he was holding Cas back, that he could never possibly have the things that Cas wanted from life. He was just a low-level artist that caught a break when he met Bobby, how could he compare to the magnificence and selflessness that was Cas.
Cas woke up into a panic attack. These weren’t too uncommon for him, sometimes they were” the result of a particularly bad nightmare, or caused by the built up anxiety from the anticipation of a stressful day, sometimes they happened for no reason that Cas could fathom, all he knew was that they were bad.
“Mostly horror stories and thrillers actually,” Cas smiled at Dean’s surprise. “I almost got kicked out of Bible camp last year when they caught me reading the Shining.”
“So an angel marries a human, huh?” Dean mulls it over in his head, “Against the initial wishes of the other heavenly figures. Damn no wonder there is so much sexual tension.”
“I may have already taken care of that,” Dean looked at him guiltily, “I’ve been awake for a while.”
Dean stopped to add more ink to the needle, giving Cas a chance to breathe. Meeting his magnetic blue eyes, Dean answered with a small smirk, “On occasion.”
“Hey bitches! You guys finish your bunk chec- AH!” Charlie’s hands flew to cover her eyes. “AGAIN guys?! Put a sock on the door or something, jeeze!” She exclaimed as she backed out of the room.
Lucas was hanging out on the sand drawing, while his mom was reading. He didn’t really like the beach, but his mom insisted they go outside on such a beautiful day. Lucas was finishing a really good picture of his bike when a strong breeze took some of his papers into the water. He ran after them, desperate to reclaim his art, but the next thing he knew, he had waded out too far in the water, and got caught in a strong current. Lucas was not a very good swimmer, and he had never been so scared in his life. It was like he had no control over his body, he was being dragged further and further into the cold depths of the sea and he could barely keep his head above water. Luckily Dean had his eye on Lucas, and saw the kid flailing not too far out. Shock ran through him. Sure he was trained and certified, but he never actually had to save anyone before. He called in on his radio, his voice a much higher octave than normal, and he grabbed his gear. Jumping off his perch, he started to blow his whistle, sprinting toward the waterline; he had caught a lot of people’s attention, including Andrea, Lucas’ mom, who only then realized that her son was gone. Filled with panic, she ran to the edge of the water, shouting his name, as Dean paddled through the waves to reach him. People began to gather closer to the water, watching the scene, as some of the other lifeguards and personnel were responding to Dean’s radio call. When Dean finally reached Lucas, the kid looked petrified, still thrashing in the water.
“You were engaged to a girl named Lisa for a bit but broke up a few months ago,” Sam answers awkwardly.
Sorry this was so short! I just needed to introduce Cas but the end of the original chapter was difficult to write so I decided to split it! Hope you liked!
A week later, after the midterms rush, there was a nice calm falling over the libraries. There was still homework to be done and textbooks to be read, but the rhythm of people was more relaxed and steady. Cas was thrilled to be done with all the tests, and he preferred to do his homework on his own time so he could focus, which gave him the opportunity to read for fun when he had some downtime. He was just getting into the story when a student approached the desk.
Dean threw his head back and laughed out loud, the joy shaking out of his shoulders, “Well, that’s an offer I’d hate to refuse!” he stopped to kiss the top of Cas’ head and slowly run his finger tips along Cas’ spine. “Unfortunately, I don’t think we have the stamina, besides you promised me a beach day!”
“Cas, you shouldn’t have to live with those dicks! We don’t have to tell Ellen about them bugging you, we’ll just tell her you wanna move in with us,” Dean negotiated.
Cas was sharing a deep kiss with Dean, when he began to run his hand over Cas in all the right places, “I want you Cas,” Dean whispered sensually, “please.”
“Well you are still entitled to some fun,” Dean teased, “but I’m glad you’re ok.” He looked down at his feet for a second, and decided to gather up all his courage. “I gotta admit I missed you these last few days, my mornings aren’t the same without you.”
“You’re telling me,” Dean smiled, “ but how are we supposed to get experience if no one will hire us? And all the crap about having connections? Why should I have to shmooze my way into the position because I know someone?”
“Two of my bunkmates aren’t taking well to the bad weather, they thought it would be entertaining to see what would happen if you push a weak swimmer in the lake during a storm,” he explained, exasperated but not overly upset.
Dean gave Cas a small smile, but had trouble ignoring the quiet voice in the back of his head, reminding him of his reality. He couldn’t go, he would never have the money, and he’d never left the west coast let alone the country.
“She would’ve treated me a hell of a lot better than you,” Dean’s voice cracked, and he shoved John back for the first time in his life, years of anger overtaking him.
For Dean, tattooing is a passion that can’t be explained, like getting lost in art is the only thing that keeps him sane. Dean loved the familiarity of the job, the calming hum of the machine, as the needle moves up and down, as he etches the ink in, and paints his canvas. The cold mist and rough pat of the sterilizer as he finishes it off, and tells the client to take a look. But his all-time favorite part is the look on their face when they see it for the first time. Anticipation fills their eyes as they walk up to the mirror and twist to see it, the new addition to their skin. Their eyes light up and it’s like they can’t stare at it long enough. Sometimes it’s emotional, joyful or tearful, but it’s the best reaction you could ever get to something you’ve created with your own hands. His art may not hang on the walls of museums, or litter the pages of history textbooks, but his art is eternal on the skin of those who wear it. Paintings and statues last centuries, but you can’t bring them with you wherever you go. They can inspire you, but only while you stand before them. His art wasn’t made to be gawked at behind a velvet rope, it was made to be traced by lover’s hands.
Benny and Garth had made their way to the rec room in the main building, where they’d been playing board games, but Dean was sick of them after hours of Candyland the day before. His friends Charlie and Jo were hitting up the craft room, making lanyards and cootie catchers, but Dean lacked the patience and finesse for arts and crafts. So he was reduced to hanging out all day and waiting for the evening movie, praying that it was something other than The Parent Trap, which for some reason seemed to be the only movie they kept on hand.
Cas rolled his eyes at Dean’s bluntness, “Dean, Ellen’s bound to check in on us one more time, and if she knew we were dating she’d never let us share the same cabin.”
“Do you think you could help me send another letter home? I made some more drawings,” the ten year old asked, trying to stifle his sniffles.
Cas let a puff of air out, and slowly lifted from his long held position, stretching out his shoulders, as his back gave an audible crack. “I’m sorry Dean, I just have so much work to get through.”
“Don’t be,” Cas looked to him with a strong but slightly melancholy smile, “I do enjoy it here, I get to do a lot of reading, and there’s much more freedom.”
Two days later, Dean was at work again, when he saw someone making their way slowly up the beach around 8. He squinted at the figure from afar, but he couldn’t tell who it was, but they were moving too slow to be Cas on his morning jog. Dean sighed slightly in disappointment, and decided that maybe he should rest his eyes before the morning crowd showed up. Next thing he knew, he heard a deep sexy voice calling his name.
Make no mistake. Another person, regardless of their love for you or relationship with you, cannot make all of your pain disappear. One person’s love does not erase another’s pain, they can just make it easier to bear. Cas survived his morning panic attacks, and made it through every hour by himself before and after being with Dean. Another person can help you with your demons, but only you can save yourself.
“Bobby I wanna thank you for-” Dean began, trying to express a fraction of the gratitude he had for Bobby, but he stopped him.
Twenty minutes later Cas practically had Dean in stitches laughing so hard. They talked about books and movies and told each other stories, Cas almost spit out the water he was drinking when Dean told him about his little brother Sammy peeing in his pants the first time he saw a clown after watching the movie ‘It’.
“Well not yet, but eventually,” he shoved Dean’s shoulder playfully. “You’re going to love it, there. I promise to take you to our sculpture.”
“I know, Angel. But if we want to get all the stuff in the car and get a good spot at the beach we gotta leave soon,” Dean reasoned.
“Yeah right, I sit on top of this stupid wooden thrown all day, Baywatch my ass,” Dean retorted, gesturing to his lax position.
"Yeah, absolutely," Dean practically whispered, moving closer and closer to Cas as if a magnet were pulling them together.
Finally Cas relented, removing his fingers and wrapping a condom around himself, he positioned himself over Dean, face to face, and after a nod of confirmation, he pushed in.
Dean woke up to a few pleasantly sore muscles and a new silver band around his left ring finger. He blinked lazily and turned to take in the sight of his husband, lying next to him in bed, their naked forms covered only by a thin white sheet. He looked to his wedding band, inspecting it under the morning light, and then back to the relaxed face of his gorgeous husband. Dean shifted so that his head rested on Cas’ chest, and snuggled in beside him, filled with happiness, love and contentment.
“The doc told us the surgery went well, he should be back from tests any minute,” Bobby informed him, “he’ll be happy to see that you dropped by.”
“Well, I know that’s what I want to do, but who knows if I’ll be any good at it,” Cas confessed with a small smile.
“I’ve been saving up,” Dean threw a duffle bag over his shoulder. All of his possessions, boiled down to one duffle bag.
Castiel followed Dean’s gaze around the room, “It does seem quite unnatural, now that you mention it.”
Cas ran his hand over Dean’s erection slowly, thumb rubbing over his slit as he bit and sucked at Dean’s lips. “Cas, lube, please” Dean eloquently pleaded. Cas conceded, reaching into the nightstand for their favorite lube and condoms.
Cas smiled as the familiar warmth of Dean’s love filled his chest. “I’m getting home first tonight, so I’m going to try that new burger recipe for dinner, is that ok?”
“Don’t say that like you’re doing me a favor,” Cas answered, loud now with hurt filling his voice. “You’re just scared that you won’t be able to do it. That going to school will be too hard, and that I’ll leave you. But that’s not going to happen!”
Dean awoke to a pounding headache. His lips were cracked and dry, his throat scratchy and nose congested. He had been sick for two days already and he still felt awful.
The look on his face when Dean told him they were over, combined with the heartache Dean felt about losing Cas, hurt worse than every beating he’d ever received.
Cas rose from his chair to check it back in and Dean nodded to him, “Night Cas, good luck on your Epic War test tomorrow.”
“Hey Man, how’re you feeling?” Sam asks once the nurse gets him settled and exits, promising to return to check up on him soon.
Benny and Garth got along with Cas just as fast as Dean, and quickly through the dinner, they found themselves offering him the extra bunk in their cabin.
“It should be a great trip, we’re going to go over all of the indigenous plants in the area and talk about different animal tracks,” Cas explained excitedly, seemingly pleased that some of the kids were interested. “Are you sure everyone’s in bed? Even Krissy? You know she always tries to sneak out and smoke with the ‘cool kids’,” Cas asked Dean as he dropped onto his bed.
“I’m going in with or without you, I’m all gross,” Cas warned, stumbling out of bed and into the bathroom.
“Do you see that?” Cas asked, pointing in wonderment at the people below them on the streets. “We’re up so high!” “You know, I heard the real Eiffel tower is like three times higher than this one! That’ll be scary, but awesome. I can’t wait!”
“I know, I know,” Dean smiled, fondly. “But if it weren’t for a little rule breaking we never would’ve had our first kiss, when we took the boat out on our own in the middle of the night.”
Dean rolled his eyes dramatically at her horrendous pun, shaking his head, “I don’t even know the dude’s name Jo, besides he’s probably not even into guys.”
Cas woke up to the feeling of hands moving down his chest. Kisses were being peppered down his neck and across his torso, and he could feel familiar thighs straddling his hips.
“Who knows how long she even had it, the woman must’ve been in her nineties!” Dean giggled, dropping onto the couch.
Cas opened his eyes and felt the familiar warmth of Dean snuggled up to him. He was relaxed and sated after a late night spent together between the sheets, but the dried sweat and semen on his skin was not something he could ignore.
He sighs, “So I’m 28, I’m finally a physical therapist at a hospital, I still live with my Sasquatch little brother and I have a gorgeous blue-eyed friend that looks like an angel but I’m not actually dating.”
One week after the shop closed, Dean packed up everything from his apartment into his car, and hit the road. Next to him in the front seat was a folder with directions to his new apartment, the number of an artist who used to work with Bobby who now runs his own shop, registration forms for classes at the California College of the Arts, and an old picture of him and Castiel. Dean was determined, he was ready to move on, and grow. He wanted to teach. He wanted to travel. He wanted Castiel.
“Well, he called me a mousey book boy, but he called Dean a poor orphan,” Cas recounted, uncomfortable.
“I know what you mean, they make it seem like people will be knocking down your door with offers when really, you’re lucky to receive a rejection email these days,” Dean sighs, glancing around the room. “I mean, look at all this, everyone with their stiff business clothes, fake smiles, and too tight handshakes it’s all so staged and rehearsed.” Dean pointed toward one of the more upscale booths, a huge set up with a flat-screen television playing an advertisement for Roman enterprises, five sinister looking representatives appeared to be looking down at everyone who passed, only approaching those that were dripping with an air of sleazy corruption. Dick Roman, CEO of Roman enterprises preached from the screen about success and cutthroat business tactics. Dean whispered, “See that? There’s no way they’re not up to something shady if you ask me.”
Castiel is a sophomore at KU and works part time at the Engineering library. Partially because he wants the experience working alongside real librarians and other students and partially because he likes the extra money. When he applied, he had just wanted to work in the main library, to get a sense of how a massive university academic library system worked, but the only position available was in the annex Engineering library.
Dean called for his attention, "Hey! Don't worry kid, I've got you. Everything's gonna be alright." After getting him to calm down enough to take the raft, Dean secured him in, and swam them both back to the safety of the shore. He carried Lucas out in his arms, to a round of applause from the impromptu audience, and laid Lucas down. Another lifeguard, Dean’s friend Jo wrapped him in a towel and Andrea immediately took him into her arms. After getting him checked out by some medics, he seemed to be ok and hadn't swallowed too much water. Dean was so relieved that everything had turned out alright, and he had got the kid back to shore before he was swept up into the riptide. Andrea was so incredibly grateful she was in tears. That was Dean’s proudest day of being a lifeguard.
“I believe I saw a map hidden just this way,” Castiel gestured, “perhaps we could figure it out together.”
“I only went out on that boat in the middle of the night because I had a huge crush on you,” Cas smiled.
“Are you serious?!” Dean exclaimed, anger flaring in his chest, “You could’ve drowned, we gotta tell Ellen!“ Ellen was Jo’s mom, and the owner of Camp Harvelle, she was tough but loving, and Dean knew she would have to know about this.
“Hmm, romantic,” Cas smiled in return. “Maybe they had an affair one crazy weekend in Vegas but they were both married.”
“Yes, unfortunately. You know Ellen’s not paying us just hangout here all summer,” he lectured, taking his job too seriously, as always.
“Well maybe I can help with that,” Dean smiled seductively as he leaned slowly, placing his hand on Cas’ neck, guiding him to Dean’s lips. The kiss electrified all of Cas’ nerves, the feel of Dean’s lips on his was one of them most maddeningly intoxicating kisses he’s ever had.
It was about a week later during their closing shift, and Charlie had just launched into a long-winded explanation about why Hermione Granger did not belong with Ron Weasley, when Dean approached the counter.
“Would you stop talking yourself out of this Winchester?” Jo scolded, giving him a punch to the arm. “Quit pining over the guy and ask him out!”
Dean’s eyes flickered away from Cas’ for a moment, “Actually I was hoping to talk to you for a sec, Cas.”
Dean sits up, but looks incredibly anxious, “Where is he? Where’s the Angel?” he asks, clearly worried. “He said he would stay, why didn’t he stay?”
“I am,” Dean answered, clenching his jaw and trying to keep his voice steady. “I haven’t needed you in years Dad; I’ve had to watch out for myself while you drank yourself to death.”
“Unfortunately we’re really busy because of midterms so the rooms are booked up until tomorrow morning, and I only have a single copy of those books because they’re so popular, but I can get you what we have,” Cas attempted.
Cas blearily turned on the hot water and let it run down his body, waking him up to the world. He began squeezing out some of the soap from Dean’s body wash when he heard Dean enter the bathroom.
“Well it looks like that’s the only way to get your attention!” Jo laughed. “Did you seriously rush me out here so you could stare at your crush?”
“Down further that way,” the kid explained, “this guy was running and all of a sudden he started to slow down and out of nowhere he collapsed, he’s unconscious!”
“You don’t have to go to school,” Cas gathered up the pamphlets idly, his voice growing quieter as Dean’s grew louder. “Dean, you know I don’t care whether or not you have a degree, you can tattoo in California. But I also know that teaching is something you love and you’re great at.”
As they started cleaning up around the shop, Bobby pulled Dean aside and put a hand on his shoulder. “So this is it, last day,” he smiled sadly.
“Dean, Dean Winchester,” he smiled glad to see that Cas was doing ok, and that they had finally met, despite the stressful circumstances.
Dean immediately began to stutter out an apology, snapping up his gaze to meet a beautiful man with bright blue eyes and a shock of dark hair. “I’m so sorry man, I wasn’t looking where I was going,” he cringed, desperately trying not to draw attention to himself.
Cas didn’t realize how starving he was until he sat down in front of Dean’s famous hamburgers. He barely had time to admire the culinary artwork in front of him before he dug right in, the sweet and savory tastes overcoming him.
“Of course, Dean. Besides, we live less than an hour from each other,” Cas noted while diligently folding his clothes.
Dean snorted, his green eyes meeting Castiel’s blue ones. “Hey Cas, any chance you want to get something to eat after this?”
Bart threw Dean a glowering look and shrugged it off, “Whatever.” The two of them stalked back to the main house murmuring to one another.
Dean was splayed out on his back in Cas’ bed, watching him with an enamored gaze, as he flipped through travel books. Cas was currently admiring a book about the Louvre museum in France, eyes caressing the century old paintings with quiet awe and a small smile.
“How? He never slows down! What am I supposed to do, run along with him and tell him I’ve been watching him for weeks, please date me?” Dean sighed.
Aside from family, friends and a livelihood, the best thing that happened to Dean while working at Free Will was meeting Castiel. Castiel was a student at the local University of Nevada Las Vegas, and he was the most beautiful human being Dean had ever seen. Dean had known for a few years that he was attracted to both men and women. He struggled with it at first, his father’s words about him being ‘screwed up’ echoed in his head whenever he even considered being with another man. But the more he learned about different sexualities, the more he was able to accept who he was, along with the support of Bobby and his friends.
“And you didn’t wake me up for that?!” Cas complained, upset that he missed the opportunity to help open Dean up, or at least witness him do it himself.
In a flash Dean pulls Cas into a hug and practically clings to him, “Where did you go, Angel? You’re supposed to stay and protect me!” he sniffles as a few tears overflow in relief.
They were all the same age, but Dean had proved to be one of the more athletic kids at camp, he was generally respected and stood several inches taller than the other thirteen-year-old boys before him. “Uh,” Raphael stammered, clearly not expecting Dean, “We were looking for a little dorky kid named Castiel, thought he ran in here.”
“Well, your paper isn’t due tomorrow,” Dean mentioned cautiously. “Maybe I could give you a little massage after we clean up, then you’ll be all loose and limber, ready to finish it.”
“So, what’s your call?” Dean asked curiously, noticing how Cas hadn’t flinched when Dean first pressed the needle into his skin.
Dean huffed a laugh, “Fine, but you’re not going anywhere until I fix that tie of yours,” Dean gestured, “Were you raised in a barn?”
“Just promise me you’ll think about it, Cas, I think you could make each other very happy,” she winked.
When Cas’ parents came to pick him up, they were as stiff and proper as Cas had described them. “Hello mother, father,” Cas greeted formally.
They quickly became one of the closest band of friends at camp. They were always together, debating books and comics and video games, running around with all the endless energy of prepubescent boys. Garth loved discussing the environment and bee populations with Cas, and Benny and Dean were keen on becoming the kayak champions in the camp-wide race. Not to mention, Cas made an amazing addition to their paintball team, his strategy and wilderness navigation skills had them practically unbeatable. But more often than not, Dean and Cas were together, reading or laughing, having the time of their lives.
Castiel had come into Free Will to get his first tattoo, lyrics from his favorite band Mumford & Sons on his ribs, reading ‘I know my call, despite my faults and despite my growing fears’. And Dean was the one that got to give it to him.
Cas groaned noncommittally in response, turning to face Dean, wrapping his arms around him, and burying his face into Dean’s chest, breathing in his familiar, comforting scent.
Dean adjusted his striped tie, hoping he had yet to sweat through his new suit jacket. A recent graduate of a mechanical engineering program, he thought finding his first job would be a cinch. All these years he heard time and time again how in-demand engineers were, and how good the alumni network was, but submitting his 10th application into the internet void with no response was just not cutting it anymore. He pulled out the event list of companies from the stupid faux leather portfolio he carried around to look important and scanned it quickly. Why the FBI always had a booth at these things he would never understand, he thought, shaking his head as he walked slowly through the crowd, do they ever actually call anyone from these events? He considered as he suddenly felt the impact of a strong shoulder against his own.
Cas entered the sterile hospital room and was greeted by Dean’s younger brother Sam, and surrogate father Bobby, both of whom were friendly with Cas.
Cas smiled, ripped the paper in half and wrote his own number down, sliding it back to Dean, “I would love that, Dean.”
“Speaking of love, do we finally get to have some adult time and make out now, or what?” Dean proposed.
“Look, man, I have no idea what you’re talking about. But I suggest you guys get lost, and find a new hobby that doesn’t include tormenting people,” he stated protectively.
“My degree is in accounting,” Castiel shrugged half-heartedly, “not exactly exciting, but I’m good with numbers and was hoping for job security. Not that I have had much luck so far.”
“But it would make me very happy,” he charmed, batting his long eyelashes, despite looking all ruffled and sick.
“As I should be, I had to flirt pretty hardcore to get Jo the cute barista to make that before they closed,” she disclosed.
“Dean had his wisdom teeth out a few years ago he was out of his gourd for almost two days after the fact.” Bobby answered.
Dean plopped onto the bed that sat directly behind the desk chair, and flashed Cas a sympathetic smile, “You can take a little break with me, just for dinner.”
As if on cue, a nurse rolled Dean in. He was quiet and looked mildly dazed. “Mr. Winchester did fine in all of our post op exams, but he is still moderately delirious because of the drugs so we want to keep him for a few more hours.”
“I looked it up,” Cas told him, taking out all these community college brochures he had highlighted and wrote little notes on. “There are a ton of schools that have art education programs near mine. Dean you’re such an amazing artist and you love teaching and mentoring other artists, you should do this.”
“We’ll have to finish it some other time, I gotta get up,” Dean said, moving to sit up and rubbing the back of his neck.
“I’m almost done with breakfast, there’s pancakes and bacon and eggs, all great hangover foods,” Cas soothed him.
Dean adjusted his aviators against the morning sunlight, and tried to make himself as comfortable as possible on his perch as his workday began. This was his second summer as a lifeguard and he had no complaints. Sure it got pretty boring sometimes, and the weather wasn’t always great, but he got a pretty solid tan, had a great view of all the sexy singles hanging out at the beach, and occasionally he got to help some people.
“Castiel,” the man smiled warmly, accepting the handshake, “nice to meet you, Dean. I agree, I will never understand why they don’t at least attempt to organize the booths in some logical way other than the alphabet, maybe profession perhaps?”
“Definitely Cas! I just wanted to ah-“ Dean grabbed a pen off of the desk and a scrap of paper and began writing. Cas gazed at him confusingly until he finished and slid it over the desk. “I wanted to give you my number and see if you wanted to get coffee sometime, maybe,” he rushed out in one long breath, blush rising in his cheeks.
Slowly Dean’s warmth surrounded him with tight, perfect pressure, and he couldn’t help but call out his name in shear ecstasy. Quickly they found a rhythm, rocking into each other over and over, Cas grinding into Dean’s prostate with each slide. The pleasure was slowly building inside them both, rising and rising until Dean could feel it, so so close.
“Amen, dude.” Charlie clinked her coffee cup to his in solidarity, and rose to flirt her way into a refill from Jo.
A cold gust of wind blew at him. It made him blink a few times, and he had to apply an unusual amount of force to the door in order to open in further.
Though, Dean stayed patient. This journey had been his life for years, and he had long given up to rush the steps that would hopefully, eventually, lead him to his goal.
As if the man next to him was just a shell, working hard to contain the life inside and express it toward the world around.
Finally, Dean took the time to actually look at the hunter fully. He was carrying a bundle of cloth so big that Dean was surprised about not noticing it earlier, despite his enraged state.
He tried to release as much tension from his shoulders as possible, and turned to face the man. He was struggling to find the right words, when the man finally spoke up.
He had known that this werewolf wouldn't be the usual kind, but none of his sources had said anything about an immunity to silver. Instead, they had talked about the ability to transform willingly, and to keep a clear head while doing so. He had read about the alphas, the originals, and their direct offspring, monsters with special abilities and even more specialised knowledge. Knowledge he needed. Knowledge he had no way of getting, now that the monster was laying decapitated on the floor of a small church in the middle of nowhere.
He turned away from Dean, his gaze landing on the building that was now visible, illuminated by a singular light.
He grinned. "Shouldn't have underestimated me, I'm a great shot." He pushed himself up from the floor, wincing at the feeling of his aching body. "You know, I didn't want to kill you, I just needed some info-"
The music helped ease the tension in his body and mind. The encounter was still riling him up inside, but his rage was slowly subsiding.
Dean wasn't one to gorge himself on others personal issues, especially when said others obviously didn't want to share their grievances, and so he accepted the blatant lie without question.
As he started digging, he let his mind wander. He allowed himself to let his guard down, trying to save at least his mental strength in order to get through the night.
The man paused for a moment, then nodded, and he opened the car door. The freezing cold that greeted the driver was almost too much for him. He squinted his eyes and withdrew from the passenger side as far as he could without seeming rude. The man, however, seemed unfazed. He wasn't even wearing a hat. He calmly stepped inside, shaking off as much snow as possible beforehand, and closed the door behind him. The driver sighed with relief. He looked at the man expectantly. The man looked back, completely still, as if he wasn't sure what to do. The driver rolled his eyes.
Dean was approaching the first few trees now. Their branches had shielded the earth somewhat, and walking became a little easier with every step he took to get further inside the forest.
The hunter continued mopping the floor. It was quiet for a while, and Deans' grin was starting to fade, before he finally spoke up again.
He kept on walking, or rather wading, through thickening snow. Cold, snowy weather brings fog. The dense kind, that impacts your field of vision, like a thick curtain obscuring everything in a certain distance. Trough the densely falling snow, this effect was multiplied into infinity, denying his eyes from scouring even the ground in front of his feet, much less the terrain around him.
The light was coming from behind him, illuminating every single one of the wildly dancing snowflakes, barely lighting the way through their denseness. It was also moving closer, and through the snowy plane, muffled by layers upon layers of ice, the man heard an engine. He jumped at the sound. Even moreso than the darkness, the silence had been prevailing for so long, hours, maybe days, and now it was disturbed, interrupted by the vehicle that was now slowly approaching through the snow. The driver was cautious, paid attention to where the road should be and where it dropped off, and went at a pace slow enough in order to not slip on the ice, but fast enough to maybe, hopefully, make it to the next town over, before the storm engulfed them entirely.
"Hey man, I just wanted to ask you... can I know your name? It's cool if you don't give me a real one, I get that, I just need something to call you. You know, since we're kind of in this together, and all that stuff."
The hunter sounded sincere. Dean let the tension fall from his shoulders a little, and wiped at his face with the palms of his hands. He pressed his eyelids shut briefly, shook his head, and looked back at the hunter.
The driver just stared at him. The mans voice was unusually deep, maybe even a little raspy. The driver attributed it to the cold weather that his lungs had been exposed to. He raised an eyebrow.
He didn't know what to expect, and so he steeled himself, put his hand on the doorhandle, and pushed.
He set his duffel down on the ground with a heavy sigh. Kneeling down, the snow clung to his trousers, and would probably melt into the fabric very soon. He hadn't been outside long enough for the cold to take effect on his feet, but he couldn't imagine it taking very long in a weather like this.
The white powder, (which you couldn't even call powder anymore, it was too packed together), drained his body heat with a frightening speed. He couldn't really feel his feet anymore, but he was sure that they were already soaking wet, and the numbness slowly snaked its' way up his legs, threatening to swallow him whole and leave him still and frozen at the side of the road.
Dean swiftly lifted his head, causing him to wince in pain as his concussed brain was subjected to even more trauma. It caused his vision to go fuzzy again, and the blurry figure only came into focus very slowly. Dean almost recoiled in shock when he recognized his saviour.
It had taken Dean a while to finally get out of his car, still shaken, and make his way toward the lonely light, which had been beckoning him closer since he'd arrived. He had a job to do, and he was on a tight schedule.
For now, the atmosphere was calming. The bar was still using incandescent light bulbs, which provided a warm, low light, occasionally flickering due to their age.
The two had taken refuge in the newly abandoned bar. It was a little cynical, occupying the domain of someone whom they had just buried minutes before, but both of them had purged it from their minds before stepping into the warm, lit up shed. It was the best option they had, probably even the only one, considering the snow storm had suddenly started up again.
"I am... unsure of how to respond to that. I have just saved your life. One would presume that this would not be a reason for cursing."
A hunt, which lay a few months back by now, had led him into the home of a collector of extravagant weaponry. Most of it was useless, but, after Dean was done with the owner, he didn't want this particular artifact to go to waste, or worse, fall into the wrong hands. He hadn't used it so far, hadn't had the need to use it, but his gut told him that now was probably the time to take it out of its' leather case, another special treat which Dean had, after some consideration, taken from the former owners house as well. It was a little bulkier, sure, but it was also protection, against thief and authority figure alike.
"So... uh... how come you're here, by the way? I guess we were looking for the same monster, but why'd you choose such a challenge?"
Dean took a final look back, inhaled and exhaled slowly, and pushed open the heavy door. It seemed to be out of hardwood, aching with every inch that it crept forward, revealing the inside of the building.
Sudden movement from the hunter made Dean flinch. The man had stood up from his stool with force, and was now staring down at Dean. His icy eyes seemed to stare directly into his soul, and Dean couldn't help but back away as far as his own stool would allow without standing up.
Someone cleared their throat behind Dean. He flinched, and immediately jumped to get back up, stumbling in the process. The cold wetness on his knees and legs was suddenly greeted with wind, making him shiver involuntarily. He spun around, irritated, and snapped at the man behind him.
Then, suddenly, he lowered his gaze. Cautiously, he lifted his other arm, in which he still held the axe.
And that was exactly why he downed the last of his glass, put a fiver on the counter, turned around, and left the building with heavy footsteps. Fear brings insecurity. Insecurity brings hesitation. He couldn't allow himself to be hesitant, or anything of that matter.
He soon spotted the perfect space to dig in this weather. Below one of the trees, only halfway obscured by the blanket of snow, was the opening of some kind of fox or rabbit hole. There were no signs of something inhabiting it, no footprints or droppings around the entrance. It might have just been covered by the snow, but Dean was willing to take that chance, and deemed the hole as abandoned. He would use the existing opening as a start and expand it, saving himself at least a bit of work.
The silence was deafening, but Dean wasn't going to back down this time. It had been a stressful and tense night, and he was in no mood to argue, but the lack of answers were pissing him off to no end.
A deafening punch to his nose almost made Dean lose consciousness. He heard a crack, and could feel blood spurting across his face from where his nose had been shattered.His vision was growing dark around the edges, and the growl emmitting from the creature sounded far away.
Unlike the chain, the inside of the building looked unusually sturdy. The benches and altar were made out of the same hardwood as the door, the carpet in the middle of the corridor seemed clean and soft. It was a comparably tiny church, with an average visitor number of less than a dozen, and so the various furnishings were withstanding the test of time out of sheer luck. Dean picked up his duffel and sat it beside the door, keeping it lightly obscured by an abandoned coat hanger. He couldn't carry the weight of it in case of an ambush, but didn't want the tools inside to be found by the wrong person either. The gun was all he had. Standing straight, his gaze fixed forwards, Dean took a cautious step. His boots sank into the carpet, the sound of it being muffled almost entirely. He sped up. There were no niches or coverings for someone to duck behind in a room as small as this one, and so he went straight for a small door at the back of the altar, hidden amongst iron candlesticks and wooden crosses.
He didn't have one yet, and in all honesty, he didn't know if he would be quick to find one either. This lead had taken him months to find and follow, and if word got around, he would be even slower to get ahold of another one of these special monsters.
It must have been a hallucination, brought upon him by too many hours spent driving, too many sleepless nights, the cold and the darkness. Maybe it was a shadow, or a trick from the light. Nonetheless, he slowly pushed on the brake, resisting the urge to slam his foot down, in fear of slipping over the icy road. The car came to a slow halt, illuminating the creature in front of it. It was a standoff, one in which neither of the participants knew the others face, but only knew of potential threats that might have been lurking in the unknown.
Dean sighed, and tried his best to get up without slipping in the puddle of blood on the floor, the source of which he was trying to ignore desperately.
His eyes turned back to Dean. They seemed a little less icy than before, but the sheer coldness that resided in them wouldn't falter.
The only sounds Dean could hear were the swaying of the trees in the slight wind, and the occasional crack of the branches. He turned his entire attention to them. The noise was somehow constant and rythmic at the same time. It filled his mind with ease, made him feel far away from the horrid situation he had found himself in.
Sorry everyone, this ones very short. Ive recently graduated, and things have been very very stressful. I have to admit that I wasnt really all that motivated since publishing the last chapter. I need to find the time to read again, because reading is what usually motivates me and makes the words flow from my brain. I hope you enjoy this one nonetheless, even if it took so long to come out.
"Well would you look at that. And I thought you were a werewolf." His voice was as cocky as ever, but they both knew it to be a barely standing facade. Dean wasn't prepared for this.
Before Dean could get a closer look, there was a slashing sound. Blood splattered onto Deans' face. It drenched his shirt, forced him to close his eyes. There was a slight pause, then a dull thumping sound echoed throughout the tiny building. A deafening silence filled the air.
Dean took a deep breath. His beer was almost empty. He didn't want to go. The bar was safe, lit up, with another human inside of it. Outside, where he needed to be, was a storm brewing. He was scared.
Dean shook his head. His thoughts were just spinning in circles now. The lack of sleep was getting to him, the events of the previous night were catching up. Suddenly, he was sure that he was concussed. The fall onto the hard, unforgiving rock had affected him too much to just be a little shakeup. He should go back to Bobbys as fast as possible, have him check it out. But the drive ahead of him was long.
"So, uh, how long have you been out there? Next town is miles away, no way you could have walked that."
And so, Dean found himself inside the tiniest bar he'd ever seen, alone, except for a, mildly confused and awfully suspicious, bartender. He had brought him a beer, no questions asked, and now stood at the farest end of the counter, sneaking penetrating glances in the direction of the unlikely visitor.
His sources had taught him about the werewolfs ability to transform only partially, and use superhuman strength and abilities whenever they felt like it. However, no one had told him about the apparent immunity to silver. Or maybe his bullets just werent pure enough. He needed to doublecheck with Bobby, something like this couldn't happen again. It had been too close.
As the man saw the moon rising in the sky, the air clean and crisp around him, a shiver crept up his neck, sending a tremble through his shoulders and down his spine.
The man nodded and backed away. Dean kept his eyes on him, and slowly moved back toward the drivers side. He never stopped looking at the man, and he returned the favour, so they were staring at eachother once more, maybe even with a seemingly deeper understanding of the others' character. As Dean began sitting down, he briefly thought about pressing the pedal to the metal and getting the hell out of there, but before the thought could even finish forming, the man sat down next to him in one swift motion. He looked at Dean expectantly. Dean just sighed, turned his eyes on the road, and started driving once again.
"Welp, not sure this'll be enough. I might need to get back to the car and get some more supplies, wanna come with?"
Whichever it was, predator or prey, he had made his decision. He bowed down until he could look through the passenger window. And then he knocked.
Even these small acts had made noise. How was the hunter able to open the duffel, retrieve the axe and approach the wolf without being seen or heard?
Lifting his head, he scanned his surroundings. The sun had long gone down, but he retained a vague sense of direction, finally landing on the direction he thought to be north. Visible through faint fog and sporadically falling snowflakes was the roof of a church. It was maybe two hundred meters down the road, standing seemingly abandoned against the dark background of the forest. Dean started walking, or rather tramping through the thick snow, still alert and keeping a tight grip on his duffel, but he tried to make himself seem relaxed. He didn't want to draw any further attention to himself, and he was sure that the bartender was watching him through one of the dust-caked windows of his shoddy, little home.
He had no more right to know about the other hunters past than vice versa, and he sure as hell wasn't going to explain his own motivations. As the car started gradually slowing down, Dean put his head on the steering wheel for a moment. It was cold, but not as cold as the night had been. He looked back up. The sun had risen ever so slightly since the last time he had paid attention to it. It was right in front of him. Sappy metaphors came to mind, but he didn't get hung up on any of them. It was simply a new day.
The body and the matching head had been wrapped up in a piece of cloth, and the strange hunter had somehow acquired a mop and a bucket, with which he was swiftly cleaning up the mess on the floor.
He had grown from being disoriented, to grateful, to happy, to full of seething rage in an impressively short timespan.
As Dean began looking for a suitable place to park, his mind drifting back and forth, further into delusion, he paid no mind to the strangely familiar looking individual who was pacing along the side of the road. Besides, even if he did look familiar, it was only a hallucination conjured up by his tired brain. After all, only one of them had a car, and there was no way for any normal human to cross this much distance in so little time.
As they approached the lonely beacon in the distance, Dean tried to force words out of his lungs, failing to do so for fear of saying the wrong thing, until he was finally able to direct a sentence at the man.
And with that, Dean took some, almost comically large, steps toward the big wooden door, grabbed his duffel, and made his way out into the cold winter night.
When the hunter opened his mouth, Dean almost feared that his soul would fall right out of the provided opening.
Before they could start their work, Dean held a hand out. He turned to look intently at the man, who slightly cocked his head to the side in confusion. The motion seemed almost animalistic to Dean. He took a deep breath.
He lifted his hand, and, with deliberately small motions, wiped at the blood covering his eyes and mouth. Reluctantly, he opened both. The scene in front of him was... confusing, at best, and utterly terrifying at worst. There, right in front of him, lay the decapitated body of the bartender. Blood was still oozing out of him, covering the floor and soaking into the wood. His eyes were wide open, but the blue light was gone. Dean looked to the side. Dead things are never pleasant to look at. His gaze wandered across the altar in front of him, taking in toppled over candle holders and splatters of blood on the stone floor. He wasn't sure whom it belonged to. Averting is eyes for a second time, trying to find something else to focus on, he stopped abruptly. A pair of legs obstructed his vision. Someone was standing in front of him.
The hunter quickly looked up at Dean, then back down at his work, before opening his mouth. He almost seemed startled.
They hadn't exchanged many words. Dean was deep in thought, not bothering to explain himself to the local, who, having seen some awfully unexplainable things in his own time, respectfully held all his questions at bay.
"I have been told that my behaviour is generally on the covert side of things. It does help with my job."
Dean had been kneeling in the snow for a while now. The broken spade was nowhere to be seen. He had thrown it as far as his tired arms would allow, between the trees further out. It was lost beneath the snow.
The driver had only stopped a handful of times over the course of the day, to take a quick leek or go over the details of his task once more, doing so everytime that his hope was beginning to fade.
Dean sat still. He didn't move a muscle, didn't even allow himself to breathe. The silence continued. Slowly, Dean exhaled.
Dean turned around, surprised at both what the man had said, and also the trace of humor inside his statement.
The room he was looking at was... unspectacular. It was barely bigger than a supply closet, with small boxes stuffed into rotting shelves, and a dusty broom in one corner, which looked as if it could use a bit of cleaning itself.
He stopped in front of the church doors. The blanket of snow in front of them was undisturbed. The doors were closed, locked shut with a thick iron chain. Dean set his duffel down. He opened it, shuffled around for a while, before pulling a bolt cutter out, and cutting the chain clean in half, with little effort. The county hadn't went all out with their expenses when locking up the building, or so it seemed. The chain made a loud thunking noise as it clattered to the ground, only mildly dampened by a, comparably thin, snow covering. The church roof had kept the worst of the ice away. Dean didn't flinch at the sound, but he did halt for a moment, listening for any sign of life inside the old building. Now was not the time to think about covering his tracks, and the snow would cover every trace of his presence soon enough anyway, so his only worry was the possible occupant waiting for him inside. After another quick look around, Dean allowed himself to avert his eyes from the doorway, and bent down again.
Dean held his breath, but he didn't avert his gaze. He and the man stared at each other. The mans' eyes were icy still. No visible emotion, or any semblance of life. Just emptiness. They penetrated Dean, seemed to look right through him, into his heart and soul and all of his secrets and burdens. Dean was unable to look away.
Dean quickly shut his mouth when he felt the blade press into his throat hard enough to restrict his breathing. He croaked out a hasty apology, and could have almost cried with relief when the blade was removed from him.
The outside didn't greet him with open arms. There were no howling winds or thick falling snow flakes, just a light sprinkle, but it was still bitter cold, and the thick layer of snow on the ground made walking on it a chore soon after Dean had stepped out from under the safety of the church roof.
Only a flimsy trenchcoat protected him from the creeping cold, dragging atop the thick layer of snow that was covering the ground. He gripped his coat tighter, wove it around his body in a manner that was supposed to protect from the icy wind, but the motion was only out of habit and didn't provide any warmth. The man had been walking in the snow for far too long, his steps growing sluggish over the course of the hike, dragging through the snow and carving a deep, wide trail into the formerly unbroken surface.
The hunters head snapped up at the sound of him approaching, and he took a quick step back toward the altar. Dean halted in his tracks and stared at him, furrowing his eyebrows.
The light was very close now, in a comfortable walking distance, and so Dean slowly started to pull over.
Dean tried his best to make his voice seem strong and steady, though both men sensed the uneasiness, and heard the slight tremble that accompanied the spoken words.
An ice cold gust of wind blew into the bar as the door was ripped open with force, shaking Dean to his core, but the man stepped out into the stormy night without hesitation.
The driver had been on the road for a few hours now, hoping to get to the next town over before the sun went down. All hope quickly went out the window when the snow started falling again and again, covering the road in front of him in an ever thickening layer, which the car was already having trouble with. He had to slow down more and more as the sun slowly disappeared over the horizon, cursing his job and the extremes he had to go to a lot of the time. He would much rather be on the other side of the state, drinking a beer and enjoying the warmth of the pub he called his home.
There was a slight pause, and Dean didn't dare look at the other hunter to see his face. They had both chosen a task to complete, and he had failed his.
Warning: This chapter contains graphic depictions of violence. It is, however, plot relevant. Read with caution.
"No, seriously man, you just hitchhiking out here? The town were Im headed has three people living in it, that is not a safe way of travel in these parts. What, you were just hoping someone would stop by and carry you to your destination?"
The man, calm as ever, followed suit. He gently closed the door, and lifted his head. He stared right into the drivers eyes, piercing him in place with solely his gaze. The wind was whipping around him, furious and loud, but instead of bothering him, it seemed to fill him with life. He stood tall. And he looked threatening. Like a predator.
He was staring right at the man, into eyes as blue and icy as the world around them, and probably even more deadly.
Dean didn't remember seeing a mop the first time he entered that room, but he had also missed the place in which the wolf had been hiding previously, so he wouldn't exactly pride himself on his great observation skills. The other hunter seemed to have a nack for it though.
Dean was taken aback by this question. He averted his gaze, vaguely gesturing toward the small hole next to them.
Dean let his head fall back now, resting it against the seat of the bench. He breathed a sigh of relief. Of course, the man was still weird, but the exact same kind of weird he had been back in the car. He didn't kill him then, no reason to harm him now, especially since the wolf had done all the work for him already.
Dean closed his eyes again. He was convinced of his own death, or of him being inside a weird dream. He didn't need this.
The sudden icyness of his surroundings shocked him, and the wind made him feel small and vulnerable, but he stood his ground and kept his eyes on the man.
"Jesus christ dude, you're an even bigger creep than I feared. Put your hands on your head and stand against the car!"
He tucked his head in, cursing to himself, and apologizing immediately after. It seemed as if the curse had hurt or frightened him in some obscure way.
But all the wishing didn't help. He was stuck, driving under 40mph, sometimes even slower, and was in dire need of rest. The sun had just peeked over the horizon when he had started his trip, so his mind was already wandering to dark places, but he couldn't stop, for fear of his frozen remains only being found weeks, if not months later.
The rising sun was glinting in the black metal, and as she rolled along the road at alarming speeds, Dean was drumming the steering wheel with his hands, humming along to the song.
It wasn't fair. All this work, all the tracking, the months of research, vanished just like that. Reduced to nothing but wasted time and a trail ending in blood.
The man wished to copy its' indifference. He wanted to be unfazed by the cold. Wanted to look away without granting a second glance to suffering and pain. Out there, through freezing winds, and unbroken silence, and snowflakes that started to fall just now, he could almost achieve it.
Driving kept his mind away from endulging in the most shadowed parts of his mind, though it could only distract him for so long with no other car in sight for hours, and the blindingly white snow robbing him of all thoughts. It practically drained him, having to watch the homogenous terrain fly by, not even interrupted by flora and fauna, one of whom had been buried in ice, the other one hiding in burrows and caves, not daring to venture out during the type of weather that would kill them faster than any predator ever could.
"I shouldn't have let you come near me. You are in danger by being near me." The man let his gaze drop, if only for a second, an unreadable expression on his face.
"Oh come on, cut the bullshit! We just buried a goddamn werewolf together, and I get keeping secrets, but at least give me something to work with, man. "
"Ah, not sure there's any food around here mate. Should have some in the car though, granola bars and stuff like that. You want me to get them? I could use some calories myself."
Dean was tempted. Now that the knife was safely tucked away, he wanted to jump on the man, hold him down and choke him out until he couldn't move, and then floor it out of there. He knew that it wouldn't work, though. Whoever the man was, he was superior to him in almost every way. He could probably outmaneuver him no matter what Dean tried, and then, Dean was certain, kill him without hesitation. He had to take the chance at survival that the man was offering him, and run with it.
He squeezed the bloody mop into the bucket. There was barely any liquid left on the floor, only a dark, fresh stain, already ingrained into the floorboards.
After the man had left so suddenly, it was on Dean to clean up after them and get rid of the evidence. It had taken a lot of self control for him to not just leave the half-full beer glass standing on the counter and storming out as well, but leaving such a clear source of DNA behind would have been his doom. For a second, he had considered leaving the strangers glass instead, but ultimately decided against it. He had saved his life after all. And besides, if the man got caught, there was no telling he wouldn't snitch on Dean. No, covering up both of their traces had been the only correct decision.
It was creeping Dean out even more, and he breathed a deep sigh of relief when he finally saw the faint glow of a light in the distance. The air had cleared over the course of the drive, making it easier to see the road and the surroundings, therefore enabling Dean to drive at a slightly higher speed in the last few hours.
"I'm an officer. You can find my badge in my wallet if you want to see it. Just letting you know. Uhm, I could get you outta trouble. But I can also give you trouble. If I have to."
The drivers' heart jumped. He whipped his head around, barely registering how cold the eyes of the man sitting next to him looked, and slammed his foot on the brakes, not caring about the potential of slipping on the ground. The car came to a sudden halt, yanking both of them forwards and into their seatbelts.
Darkness was already creeping in, the slither of light over the horizon growing fainter as the minutes ticked on. It wasn't snowing, thankfully, but it could start up again any second. It had been a turbulent winter, and the man was grateful that it was nearing its' end. He wasn't prepared for harsh weather, not as much as he should be. His head was entirely uncovered, dark brown hair whipping through the wind and creating the image of someone unhinged and delirious.
His train of thought was entirely focused on getting as comfortable as possible in order to stay asleep for at least an adequate amount of time.
Dean shook is head, grabbed the bottle, and pushed himself off of the floor where he was kneeling. He shouldn't be worrying about all this, at least not for now. He almost died, and ended up being saved. That was all that mattered, all that should matter.
His crunching steps carried on through the snow, though his pace slowed as exhaustion finally started to set in. He needed rest, maybe a place to sleep, some warm food. But the cold tundra couldn't provide that for him, staring back at him with a kind of indifference that only nature could express, stubborn in its' ways and unable to be persuaded by a sad face, or a dying scream.
He had been researching for weeks in preparation for this, double and triple-checked all the given information. Everything pointed to a monster living in this tiny, tiny town, one so vile that it might just have the information Dean needed.
A snarl escaped the creature, which transformed into a raspy laugh as Dean struggled against the hold of his attacker.
They sat in silence. The driver noticed that the man wasn't shivering. He just sat there, eyes fixed on the road, hands folded in his lap. He wasn't wearing gloves either. They were both plagued by the same questions. Who are you, what are you doing out here, where are you going? But they could sense that the other was somehow different from the average, and they respected eachothers privacy in a way that would seem insane to any other person.
Slowly, but steady, he made his way toward the treeline behind the church. The woods were thick around here. A few meters in, and no one would be the wiser for at least a while.
He started making plans for his further course of action. Since this detour had been a total bust, he needed to find a different approach.
Dean was already turning on his heel when he was grabbed by the arm. He turned around, confused, and was suddenly face to face with the man, who was staring at him intensely and with an uncanny and unreadable expression. He looked like he was about to say something, or like he was holding his breath in preparation for...
The quiet of a snow covered world is incomparable to anything one has ever experienced. When the only thing reaching your ears is the crunch of your own boots, pressing into the snow in a rythmic pattern so familiar to you that you can almost blend it out entirely, the feeling of solitude can overwhelm you. Snow, deep snow, out in the middle of nowhere. It grants the illusion that you are alone in the world, entirely on your own, that no living soul except for you has ever set foot on the planet you inhabit. The man was aware of this being untrue, he knew that the space he was inhabiting was shared and cherished by many, but still, the feeling overcame him, and he let it sit inside his mind, relishing in the illusion. He liked the idea of having the world to himself. Not to conquer it, and take it away from every organism that called it its' home, but to be able to take all the wonders it provided into himself, and relish in them, uninterrupted and at peace.
But then, a slight unease overcame him. He registered the falling snow, and his blood ran cold, maybe even literally, and he was sure of his impending doom. The light had faded out of the sky completely by now, and there was nothing to light his way, the almost full moon now obscured by clouds that carried his death inside them.
Time was running out, the full moon was only a few days out, and he wasn't interested in becoming werewolf food. He had an arsenal of silver weaponry in his trunk, from blades, to bullets, to a, rather impressive, battleaxe. Dean had stumbled upon the latter entirely on accident.
"Should have taken more time to look around. There's much more places to hide in here than you might think."
Dean blinked in surprise. He hadn't expected thankfulness, not after feeling the cold steel against his throat. The man continued.
Only now did Dean notice how weirdly inhuman he had looked before. Almost dead, or soulless, or something similar.
The man on his passenger seat turned to him, and seemed to stare right through him, directly into his soul. There was a pause. One beat. Two beats. The man dropped his voice, almost reducing it to a whisper.
Dean shot him a quick look, then turned around, shovel in hand, and approached the foxhole. The man followed closely behind.
The drive was quiet. It was to be expected, after the little fiasco earlier, though it didn't bother Dean too much. His mind had finally gotten something to latch onto. The mysterious stranger provided distraction from all the various dark and bloody thoughts inside Deans' mind, and despite the grisly circumstances of their arrangement, he was thankful for his presence. It provided him with the opportunity to let his mind wander in different directions. Who, or maybe even what, was the one sitting next to him? Where did he come from? What was his mission? In Deans' mind, he had picked up particularly skilled and crazy serial killer, who had made it his mission to eradicate the entirety of the Harding' population, a task that was probably achievable in a few months of dedicated work.
Dean waited for him to say something, but nothing followed his obvious attempt at gaining Deans' attention. He looked up at him again.
The drivers laughter had died down. He was furrowing his eyebrows, growing ever so slightly more weary of his unlikely companion.
He had been gripping it tight, keeping it close out of habit. He wasn't sure the bartender had even noticed it, and if that was the case, he was glad about it. The contents of the duffel weren't exactly conventional. Now, they would be the only defence Dean had.
Suddenly, his gun was on the floor, knocked out of his hands by a force too fast to be seen by the human eye. He was grabbed by the collar of his jacket, which was made out of thick leather, and sturdy enough to hold his weight without problem. His back was now pressed against the car, and he felt cold steel against his throat, pressing against the exposed skin in a way that made his blood run colder than the icy wind could ever achieve.
The man was not without a home, per sé, but rather chose not to use it in favor of travelling the world, on search for... something. His wants and needs were obscure, difficult to describe, difficult to understand.
Looking at the still snow-covered world around him, Dean took out a blanket from under the passenger seat, and climbed into the back without opening any doors. He needed to conserve heat.
"Alright. I don't know what your deal is, I don't wanna know, just please leave me alive, okay? I got stuff to do. Important stuff."
The rumbling of the wheels on old and tattered asphalt was only rivaled in volume by the music blaring from inside the car.
Cold, with a slight bitterness, the taste of the grain its' been brewed of. Dean won't ever get sick of it. It's funny how the little things can be your rock, the things you always come back to. The alcohol content was pleasant, but sometimes, very rarely, not the most important part. Dean closed his eyes, and he was back home, his brother at his side. The feeling only lasted a moment.
"Fear not. I have found two shovels inside of the local tavern. I am sure the owner will not mind us borrowing them."
Into the duffel went the bolt cutter, and out came a semi-automatic handgun, loaded with bullets made from pure silver. It lay heavy in his hand, but he was used to the weight. It provided him security, something to hold on to. It had been a gift.
Step by step, he got closer to the old building. It was towering above him already, covering the moon, which had been obscured by clouds, drenching the approaching man in darkness. Dean went over everything he knew for the final time.
A wide grin spread across his attackers face. And then, Dean was flying again. He crashed into one of the front row benches, cursing their immaculate materials as the wood pressed all the air out of his lungs. His vision was getting blurry now, his brain was being rattled around in his skull, disorienting him. The approaching creature shifted in and out of focus. The booming voice felt like a punch to his eardrums.
After a few beats he managed to haul himself up to the side of the bed, with Dean keeping a watchful eye on him as if he might fall off.
“I just keep thinking that everything is going to change. None of us are going to see each other like we do now. What if we all don’t stay in touch.” Cas frowned deeply at Deans’ words because they were his fears too. “What if me and you lose touch? I just—I don’t want anything to change.”
He couldn’t tell just by the sound of Dean’s voice alone but he also really didn’t want to make eye contact with his friend to find out.
He loved being able to watch his man fight wakefulness, burrowing into his pillows and blankets as Castiel peppered kisses all over his face.
The smile from Castiel’s face faded as he saw an unfamiliar black Jaguar sedan parked in his driveway with a very familiar woman standing on his front porch.
If anyone felt even a fraction of what he felt as he was granted the comfort of Dean’s arms around him, then he knew how people could do this. The sound of his heartbeat under Cas’s ear, the feeling of his chest rising and falling against his cheek; the thought that this was a moment just for the two of them, a moment no one could take away because no one else existed—Castiel knew how people could do this.
Dean nearly choked on his emotions. Sammy could remember his birthday but not his own husband? His own kids?”
The moment didn’t call for frantic removal of clothes but Castiel sank to his knees quickly. He pulled himself together a moment later, feeling the urge to draw this out as much as possible. First he’d just let himself touch. Much like the time all those weeks ago, he let his hands roam where he thought best. But now—now he understood Dean’s body so much more, so much better. Now he knew the way Dean’s eyes would darken when Cas pushed his thighs apart. Now he knew the right pressure to use because light pressure made Dean ticklish. Now he knew just the way to grope his friend, firmly through the front of his pants, and Cas wasted no time in giving him what he wanted. He, himself, just… wanted.
Not long after settling into their family of four, an emergency call had them welcoming Emma into their home. Her mother had been charged with first degree murder for the death of Emma’s biological father—she’d only been two months old.
“I don’t mind.” Cas reassured him, taking his hand and walking towards the stairs. He stopped to look around for a moment, taking in the home he’d been away from for awhile. “That’s a lot of takeout.” Cas observed with a laugh nodding his head towards the coffee table.
Well you can’t make your brother sleep on the futon. Not only is it uncomfortable as a bed but with what we’ve done on it… I’m not sure if I’m comfortable letting Sam sleep there.
So many times he’d had the chance to say something, but every time he held back. The uncertainty of knowing how Cas would respond or how it would work out if Cas did feel the same way in return kept him from confessing it all.
It took only three strides before she began a conversation. “So, how’d you meet Dean?” She asked and Castiel felt relief at it being a simple enough response.
And to top it all off, looking up to see Cas’s face shattered… Dean couldn’t get the sight out of his mind.
“I don’t know what I’ll do if he doesn’t love me back,” he admitted, hating the fact that he knew he’d probably crumble if Dean rejected him. He’d stupidly gotten too invested but how could he have not? He set himself up for failure the moment he asked Dean to agree to this arrangement.
“Crazy is always hot. Always.” Dean jokingly affirmed. Just to get Cas to stick his tongue out at him petulantly. Needing to up the ante Dean threw the bird his friend’s way, pairing it with a flashy wink.
He almost thought he’d said that until he cracked open his eyes and saw Dean staring down at him from his spot on the couch.
Castiel probably didn’t deserve him but somehow the universe, or God, or whatever higher being was out there seemed to believe he did.
“Pressed flowers.” Castiel admitted shyly. If it weren’t for Dean bringing it up, he never would have told his siblings about this particular collection—it hadn’t been something he talked to many others about after his mother had once scolded him over bringing ‘trash’ into the house.
…sometimes he hates them too. Just a little. Just on days like these, fleetingly, yet there. It twists in his gut and makes him feel unworthy of the five beautiful angels in his life but it’s hard to tamper down the feeling of,
What he did need was another drink. Before he could flag down the bartender for the fourth time, a figured slid into the seat to his right. Dean didn’t even have to look to know who it was. "Is this seat taken?" They asked.
Dean’s groan was all the response he needed but Cas relished in the words Dean mouthed against his neck when his head drooped down to press into the crease between his neck and shoulder. “You feel so fucking incredible.”
The plan was lackluster at best: find the witch, subdue her, siphon enough Grace not to kill her, keep her trapped and alive until finding Cas, then tether Dean’s soul to Cas.
Without any form of argument Gabriel had the tickets in Dean’s hand in a matter of moments with an under his breath, “Good riddance,” only to turn around and steal the apron right out of Sam’s hands. But Castiel wasn’t paying attention to that.
Their four-post bed had been decorated with sheets and twinkling lights that he knew came from Claire’s room. All of their hall closet blankets and pillows were perched on the bed, filling it up like a fluffy nest. Candles were lit around the room casting shadows all over the walls and soft music was coming in from their speaker.
Welcoming them into their lives, loving them—those weren’t the hard things. The finances the lawyers, the judges, the therapy, those were the things that made it challenging in those years they welcomed their kids into their home.
It was just long enough to get Dean really wet before Cas popped off, licking around the crown just to hear Dean moan, before he stood up on wobbly legs and moved over to the couch where he found the lube.
He knew without asking that Dean was referring to his mother but the guarded look in Dean’s eyes made him not press for more.
Dean didn’t necessarily seem grumpy but it was clear he wasn’t thrilled by it. “What?” he asked sounding vaguely annoyed.
Castiel knew that Dean likely had his sights set on the small bottle of Jack Daniels with the two Star Wars themed shot glasses. The gift only had one more steal until it was locked down. It was also possible, knowing Dean, that the man might want to steal the gift his younger brother Sam had gotten just because it was his “big brother duty” after all. It didn’t matter that Sam had grabbed an apron with the male anatomy printed on the front of it; Dean had found the gift absolutely hilarious.
Dean didn’t answer his question automatically, presumably taking in the sight before them out of their too small window or perhaps just mentally waking up. Either way, eventually he found his words.
“Was he rude to you?” Gabriel whispered when Castiel settled in the plush wooden chair. Castiel answered the question honestly.
With an exhale Cas sank down, just enough to get Dean inside him before he circled his hips and willed himself to relax enough to sink down further.
Dean waited with giddy excitement in the living room as he heard the garage door click shut and Cas hanging his keys on the ring. He knew Cas would take a few minutes hanging up his coat and dumping his bag before he found his way to where Dean was.
He felt dread overcome him at the realization that Dean would likely not want to put up with his presence any longer by the end of the night.
When he was on his third waffle of the morning, his dad quickly left the room, coming back a few seconds later with a small red package.
“But I don’t want to deal with that!” Cas groaned petulantly. “I want to get through all the awkward parts with someone now. I want you to help me. Will you please help me?”
He could hear it in the very distinct way that Cas said his name that the angel was about to tell him to leave, but Dean wouldn’t allow those words to come out.
Sure fairytale weddings were cute in books but Dean’s own last name was Winchester and he wasn’t exactly throwing a rifle themed wedding (not for lack of trying). This—all of this—it just wasn’t
“I’d feel more comfortable going with the smaller one. It’s not going to be comfortable your first few times.”
It took a little while. A little more discussion, a whole lot of planning, and more saving than Dean knew he was capable of (baby making isn’t exactly cheap when spouses reproductive organs don’t exactly function together) but a few years after Castiel asked, everything was starting to fall into place for their little family.
Castiel contemplated for a moment before deciding. “Yes, I’d like to play video games with you and Sam.” A beat later he wondered, “Would you like help with biology today also?”
The calendar still said January. A quick look down at his watch told him the date was already February 1st. When had he forgotten to change the calendar? He usually kept it updated.
He didn’t know why he was suddenly so damn nervous. Maybe it was the look in Cas’s eyes, the way that Cas seemed unsure of the gift he was giving. Or maybe it was the fact that all eyes were now on him. He sort of felt like his heart was going to suddenly beat out of his chest.
“Wow, February already?” He flipped the page to the right month, scanning over the first few days and seeing… yup, Jack’s appointment was written right there. At least Monday was free. “Yes, that’ll work. Let me write that down.”
“Damn, your dad has a serious collection of the Supernatural books. I didn’t know there were this many limited editions. Is he like a huge fan or something?”
Cas was cleaning up his desk while Dean sat on the futon fidgeting so much with his hands he thought he might actually have to sit on them.
It’d only been a few days, really, and not enough time for Castiel to be certain but he felt in his gut something was up with Dean. He’d talk to Cas but wouldn’t say much and his mood wasn’t as light as it had been before Sam arrived.  It wasn’t drastic but it made Cas wonder if he’d done something wrong.
Dean’s fingers found their way into his hair, and Castiel groaned his approval. He loved when Dean would guide his mouth just the way the other man wanted. Only, this time that didn’t come. Instead of thrusting his hips up into Cas’s slack jaw, Dean pulled him off of his cock.
Dean hadn’t realized that Rowena had begun her incantations until the crystals around them began to glow.
He knew they were young and that they’d only known one another for a short period of time but Castiel, in that moment hoped that he’d be the one who could offer all that to Dean. Even if it couldn’t be him, he knew with certainty that was the life he wanted for the other boy as well. “You deserve that.”
but he didn’t think he was brave enough to try and fix it and with the end of the year creeping up and graduation looming over them he felt like he was already running out of time.
“Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.” Dean cursed as his second orgasm of the night hit him like a train. It wasn’t even a beat later that Cas followed behind him.
“You’re taking me to see the bees?” When Dean met Cas’s eyes, he was blown away by the look of awe he saw reflected in them.
She cackled as Dean tried to keep his gun trained on her other leg, ready to shoot if she managed to fight even Jack’s power.
It seemed like a joke, because at this point Dean felt like he had a neon sign glowing overhead that said
It was difficult to put into words the mixed feelings he had on his time at university so far, but despite the weirdness, Castiel Milton knew he was enjoying himself. He’d given the campus clubs a try. He’d given a few joints a try. He’d eaten his fair share of college-approved foods, and had put on that inevitable “freshman fifteen.” He’d definitely even given the nightlife a try, or continuous tries since he was now three years into his degree and still found himself going out every so often with his friends.
It’d been miserable trying to hide out in the library or at coffee shops during the day, hanging around until he had to drag himself to classes he hardly cared about anymore. Eating dinner in the corner booths of fast food restaurants, alone, hadn’t felt too great either but he knew he deserved it. He’d fucked up so much.
Dean’s heart cracked open seeing the wetness brew in Jack’s eyes. He looked so young and vulnerable that Dean wanted to do anything to make it stop. The kid had already lost so much, too much, and Dean couldn’t really fathom what kind of blow this must be to lose yet another parent.
The last few days of the semester crept up on him and before he knew it, he was watching Dean pack for the holidays.
The Grace continuously grew warm as it worked as hard as it could to give Dean the sight he needed to make it back to Cas. Mile markers flew by him, exit signs were a blur, and Dean kept driving, the warmth and comfort of the Grace a steady presence within him. He drove on and found himself on a dark road, traveling up into the mountains where he knew he needed to be.
They stayed locked in an embrace for a few moments later before Dean caught the eye of some of Cas’s friends, looking like they didn’t want to interrupt the moment the two lovers were having. Not wanting to deprive Cas of time with his friends he kissed his husband’s hairline and pulled out of the hug.
There was an intense silence as Dean just looked Cas over, almost trying to read into Cas’s mind and figure him out. Cas felt his heart beating a tattoo into his ribs, wondering what the hell Dean was going to say. His friend seemed off but Cas couldn’t tell why. Dean didn’t seem mad but he certainly didn’t seem happy.
A surge of emotion hit him and Dean tried not to let himself get misty eyed. “Miss you too, kid. Text me okay?”
Dean wondered for a moment if the guy had many friends to talk to. Something told him that he didn’t.
“I will.” The guy declared as he stood up. He didn’t offer a goodbye just turned and started to walk away, albeit with a slight limp, towards his house.
As their palms clasped together, the same warmth Dean had felt earlier, when Cas’s Grace led him here, grew like a ball in his hand but something cool was mixed with it. He looked down and saw bright blue and golden lights swirling around each other like a dance. The lights spun for just a little before twirling together and splitting in two, each strand braiding itself more completely around its counterpoint. The mixture of heat and cold began to crawl up each of their arms as the braids wrapped around and danced upwards. The lights seemed to find their destinations at the center of both Dean and Cas’s chests, both blue and golden light so intertwined and bright it nearly looked white, before pushing inside and taking their breath away.
The whole walk home had Dean smiling. It wasn’t the best family dinner he’d ever experienced, and Cas’s siblings sure left an impression on Dean. But despite all that, Dean was still going home with a contented feeling inside his chest, one he was starting to always associate with spending time with Cas.
Aside from being alone in their dorm for almost a week, Castiel knew that he’d at least be seeing his dad soon. It’d been too long since he’d seen him and that was the one thing keeping his spirits up.
Dean knew he was panicking, like his body was sure if he didn’t do this right that moment that Cas would suddenly flash out. He hardly had time to register that he was essentially throwing himself onto Cas and forcing the angel to spend a lifetime with Dean. He just knew that nothing else felt more right than agreeing to do this.
Knowing that Cas might open those pictures of him later and use them to his liking… it did things to Dean’s insides. He just hoped Cas knew there was more where that came from.
even entertained the idea of being with someone else. This was why Cas left him? “Are you serious? Cas, I was going to ask you to marry me."
“No! You don’t understand. I’m not some scumbag like you think I am. I’m not using him to get my rocks off. I’d never do that!”
It took a few moments for both of their spasming limbs to start to calm down. And even though no part of him wanted to stop touching Cas he finally pulled his fingers away, wiped them on the sheet, and started gently rubbing Cas’s back as he slowly stopped shaking.
Dean tried not to let on that the question made his heart skip a beat, but he knew his mom and brother were probably internally freaking out. Poor Cas had no idea how big of a crush Dean was harboring—he had no idea how his innocent desire to give Dean a nickname was making Dean want to jump for joy.
He believed he’d never been obvious with his feelings yet somehow the snarky-sidekick had figured it out or Lord Farquaad had more brain cells than Castiel initially assumed. Regardless, the two boys presumed they’d gotten the last word as their twin smirks stared right at Castiel. Despite the knot in his belly Cas didn’t cower to them.
Cas looked down at him in awe, like he couldn’t believe he had Dean there with him. “I love you too. More than anything in this universe, my beloved.”
When Chuck came back from answering, there was a short woman by his side, a little younger than his dad. Her large blue eyes and slightly frizzy blonde hair seemed vaguely familiar but not enough that Castiel recognized her. She was wearing a very decorated red Christmas sweater, adorned with gold tinsel and what looked like small jingle bells. Her smile took up almost her whole face and somehow Castiel already instantly liked her.
“Cas… when are you going to let me have her number?” It was almost pitiful the full-fledged whine Benny’s voice undertook every time he talked about trying to get Cas to be his wingman with Hannah. He’d been at it for almost a year but Cas was just as protective over Hannah as any.
He didn’t know how he was going to manage telling his brother. What was he supposed to say? How was he going to look his brother in the eye and let him know that he’d driven away one of the few good things they still had left in their lives? How was he going to manage to speak the words into existence that he failed Cas again?
“It’s uh. It’s a hypothetical one because I was watching this uh—I was watching a movie where a kid he uh he told something to his parents and they didn’t react so well so it made me wonder if that kid was me how you and dad would react and I was just uh wondering.”
An uneven breath shook the hunter’s shoulder before a warm hand rested on top of the angel’s. The hand did not let go, not even as Dean’s breathing indicated the man had finally fallen sound asleep.
“Oh, yeah, of course,” she agreed immediately, wanting to help him out. He seemed to appreciate it because he grinned brightly, his mood seeming to soar.
He bit back his disappointment, knowing an apology over the arrangement was better than downright disgust at Dean having woken up in his arms.
He wasn’t used to feeling want so heavy that early in the morning but with Dean laying there looking so beautiful, Cas knew his body was only reacting to what it craved.
The stress, fear, and doubts locked up in Dean’s chest immediately disintegrated as his best friend started gathering their things. Despite how much Dean wanted to get out of there, there wasn’t any franticness to their movements as much as there was urgency to be gone before someone came looking. That’s why when the door to the room flung open Dean and Cas froze in place like disobedient children.
Images of Sam and Cas trying to ban together to make Dean eat healthy food, and Cas and Bobby plotting on how to get Dean to stop making excuses for not going back to school, suddenly flooded his mind and tore another hole through his chest. How he
The business of their day nearly led to Castiel forgetting about the uncomfortable run in with Mary.
“Again?” She asked, sounding a little put out, though she knew it was her and Dean’s deal for her and her friends to get free coffee weekly.
As Castiel left that night, after eating far too many cookies (Dean’s secret ingredient being half brown sugar, half honey), he couldn’t help but stop and stare back at the lights for a little while longer. He could see his best friend’s silhouette moving in the living room through the curtain, and he could smell the fresh baked cookies still on his skin.
Dean’s heart was thrumming in his chest. Why was Cas doing this? Dean looked at the other man who appeared to be trembling.
“What?” Hannah asked sounding shocked. “You’ve both been so happy. Why would he just end it? Did you have a fight?”
God, even just saying it out loud made the burning embarrassment come back full force. He’d been down on his fucking knees with another man’s dick in his hand. Fuck… he’d even been about to put it in his mouth and then he was rejected? Just because he said he’d never done it before? Was he really that undesirable that Arthur didn’t even want him to try? Didn’t guys like getting sucked even if it was only mediocre at best? God, even thinking back to the night Cas was now almost positive Arthur hadn’t even been fully hard.
“Have you guys seen his flower collection? It’s so cool.” Dean’s proud beaming smile made Castiel flush a little at the praise.
A small bundle of nerves settled inside of him as Castiel moved onto the couch and leaned against Dean’s side. He let Dean take the lead from there, throwing his arm around Cas’s shoulders and pulling him in until Cas’s cheek rested on Dean’s shoulder and his arm settled over Dean’s waist. They both kicked their legs up onto the ottoman and turned their attention to the TV to finish their movie.
Before Cas could start asking about when they wanted to go and other specifics about the night, Mary bounded out eager to see the lights.
“Guys, this is Castiel. Cas, this is everyone.” Castiel looked at the table to the group of people. He was familiar with some of their faces, having seen them in his classes, but the only face he knew by name was the boy with the long hair at the edge of the table—Sam.
Dean felt himself wither away into nothingness. He didn’t want to eat. He didn’t want to get out of bed. He didn’t want to have to face a day with pitying looks from everyone around or hear their smug ‘I told you so.’ And if it weren’t for Sam moving in unannounced, throwing Dean into an ice cold shower, and force feeding him three meals a day—well Dean was positive he probably would have lost his job during that time, and probably wound up in the hospital from alcohol poisoning.
He was surprised when Dean’s eyes opened and looked down at Cas, only briefly before they closed once more.
“Essentially.” The woman agreed. She had blue and green hair and a metal lip ring but looked far less terrifying than most people with wild colored hair who worked in sex stores. She looked normal, really. Even her attitude was kind as she explained the toy Dean was standing next to. “People like to masturbate while using them generally.”
He fell to the side, careful not to land on his friend. This time Cas was the one who pulled Dean into his arms. This time Dean was the one who buried his face in Cas’s neck. This time Dean was the one who fell asleep on his friend.
The prospect of Dean coming home early made Cas unreasonably happy but he didn’t want to get his hopes up.
He didn’t think this part through when he’d first thought of doing this with Dean. He hadn’t looked past actually having Dean agree so now, thinking about how to even approach the subject again made him feel like his heart was going to beat out of his chest. He
“That’s it. We do need him placed immediately, so we need your answer quickly or else we have to ask the next family on our list.”
“It’s been nearly a month since our arrangement has started, it seems like the next course of action, don’t you agree?” Castiel asked, hoping his silence hadn’t given away any of his useless thoughts.
Maybe he was blind because of his feelings for Dean but he truly meant it when he said, “It is what I want and I… I really don’t believe he’d ever hurt me.”
“We’ve been together for a while now.” Castiel now said, bringing his palm up to rest against Dean’s cheek. Dean leaned into the touch and pressed a kiss to his husband’s hand.
Cas nodded. “I have. I’ve also been asked to be a regular guest speaker at the university lately, helping the students decide if it’s the career choice they want.”
“I uh—I got this the other day—just… uh, just in case,” Dean explained, his cheeks tinged red from his orgasm.
Castiel was loath to remove himself from the bed but he knew that he couldn’t lay there forever. A quick glance at the clock told him it was already past six thirty at night. If he stayed it bed and tried to sleep again he’d probably be awake by four in the morning the next day, if not earlier and it’d throw his entire day off.
That was all Dean got that night but it felt good to have accomplished that much. He went to bed that night with a smile on his face and the hope of more baby steps between them.
A wave of shame hit Dean a little at the words. He had to admit that he hadn’t been as social the past few months but especially less social in the most recent weeks with the sudden turn of events between him and Cas. He tried to play it cool though and not let on that he was keeping a giant secret.
The night wore on and conversations fell silent. Slowly people bundled up and headed out the door giving their thanks for the random gifts and making promises of seeing one another “next year.”
“Seriously?” Dean laughed through his question, gesturing towards the books on the shelf all aligned with the same author at the top. “Then who needs multiple entire sets of these books? Aren’t there like a hundred books total?”
They stared at each other for a moment, neither saying anything and Cas knew he’d fucked up. He pried his eyes away and looked down at the pillows in front of him. He probably looked like such a whore. Ass up, a dildo still sticking out of him, begging for a dick… Why would Dean want to fuck him anyway?
He didn’t want to do something that Dean would think was stupid. He wanted to just follow Dean’s lead but he was scared Dean wouldn’t be very excited to see him. They had talked over break, and flirted a little when they’d talk late at night, but did it even mean anything? He just didn’t know. He was always so confused where they stood. He wished Dean could outright tell him if there were any feelings there.
She continued to throw magic Dean’s way, singeing the edge of his jacket but her magic seemed less accurate now with the bullet lodged in her leg.
“You mean that?” Dean was glad when his own look of awe seemed to stop Castiel’s own gaze from turning unsure.
“A book about all kinds of supernatural creatures.” Sammy started to explain, talking a mile a minute as always. “His dad writes about a lot of them in his stories and there’s so much backstory he has to put into them. I’ve been talking to Cas about how complex and detailed all of his dad’s stories are and how he must research these things to get all the information correct. And it made me wonder what all he’s been learning and where any of the stories of these creatures originated from.”
Not really wanting to hear Dean’s spiel about what they should and should not do while he was away, Cas cut in, almost too passive aggressively.
“There is something I could try,” Rowena replied, still hovering her hands over Castiel’s head, neck, and shoulders. “But it holds no guarantee. It also would not be able to restore Castiel’s connection with the host.”
He wagered that Cas was about as stoked to go as Dean was. It was their first time in what seemed like months that they’d even gone out apart from grabbing some food with Hannah a couple times.
Cas patted himself down again, checking he had everything he needed. “I won’t hold my breath,” he jeered, making Benny feign heart problems.
Emma quickly affirmed that they were before jumping off of Dean’s lap to move over to Cas’s side of the table. Dean watched fondly as Cas gently nudged Sam from his half-sleep state in order to pull his little sister into his lap.
Something in the way he said that must’ve clued Benny into not pressing the matter further. Instead he clapped Dean on the shoulder as he went to grab another drink.
Later in the car Emma swore up and down that she didn’t know she had homework, that she didn’t remember she had a reading log, and that she didn’t know she needed Cas to sign anything every night.
Dean knew this would be Jack’s top priority and felt a little guilty for putting this burden on him, but Cas was important to all of them, especially Jack. The thought made him wonder.
He never knew he could moan so loud, nor mumble such incoherency and Dean… Dean didn’t stop. Lord above, he didn’t stop.
“Should we head back?” Dean asked to which Cas nodded his head. The angel needed less help getting back to the motel but he was still shuffling along slowly, likely exhausted from everything he’d been through.
“It’s all about getting things heated. Just now we were watching Hunger Games and like—that isn’t the most sexy setup.”
“Dean,” he groaned looking over at his friend with a shocked expression but Dean’s eyes held no regret, just deep dark need as he started to slowly stroke Cas’s member, not breaking eye contact for a moment.
for like three weeks until I saw you write it on your homework when you were helping me with bio. People forget things, it’s not a big deal.”
you, you should have never taken him back. Even if he didn’t actually cheat on you, he’s still so far beneath you honey. You could do so much better than him.”
There were a few more minutes of conversational silence, with only the sounds being Dean cussing at Benny for killing him, yet a-fucking-gain, even though they were on the
Cas looked up at his husband as if he’d grown two heads. “If we broke up you think we’d still be friends?”
Castiel knew his face probably looked pathetically pleading but he hoped to God, Dean was telling the truth.
Knowing he’d been alone in Dean’s room entirely too long, Castiel pulled himself from the bed and quickly redressed in his own clothes before making his way to the door.
“Talk about this?” Dean wrung his fingers through his hair. He was so angry at Cas for not trusting him… for shutting him out because of something he never did. “You didn’t talk to me for a year! A whole fucking year Castiel! You shut me out, not the other way around.”
Did his husband feel how much they needed him? How just his presence alone made everything so much brighter, safer, and calmer?
He laid in bed each night now, wondering if Cas had found somewhere to sleep or if he was out on the streets struggling to stay warm. He wondered if Cas had food and water and was actually consuming it since he’d been refusing to eat before he left. Did he have money? Was anyone helping him? Had anyone found him and he’d been in danger this whole time?
“No! No!” Cas threw his hands out and gripped his friend’s forearm. “Oh, Dean. I’m sorry. No it was nothing like that. I swear.”
Castiel bent down and picked up his book before finally peering up at Dean shyly. “Thank you for being kind about it.”
Tears were in Dean’s eyes now too thinking back to the day. In his self-centered mind he hadn’t really spared a thought for Ellen… just himself and the fact that he was probably going to lose another parent far too soon. He was too caught up in the fear that he’d have to go through all that pain again to even think about what Ellen, or Jo, or the kids, or even his damn husband were feeling. He felt like an asshole suddenly. His family needed him and he wasn’t there.
“It’s Saturday. Wanna go out and get so drunk we forget about stupid boys?” Hannah asked, as the two of them laid on her bed. She’d wound up as his big spoon, and though it didn’t feel as comforting as Dean’s arms had, he appreciated how much she was caring for him.
Sam and Dean both laughed together. Dean knew it was something Hannah would do. She seemed to believe in true love and happily ever after, and always tried to encourage Cas to go out and meet someone good for him.
Usually that was where their conversation ended. On most days Castiel would walk up the stairs towards his room and work on homework until his father announced that dinner was ready.
Yeah, the fact that his best friend wanted to learn how to give good head and had asked him to help was a little weird… but he could see Cas’s logic in it. They were best friends. He trusted Cas with his life and was fairly certain Cas felt the same way in return. It seemed logical enough to want to try and ease your way into the finer parts of sexy times when you had someone you were comfortable with to guide you through. It probably wasn’t the best idea to hook up with a friend though… a significant other would be easier to ease into it all with. But it still didn’t diminish Cas’s logic.
But Castiel didn’t dare speak of it to Dean in case that was the wrong thing to say. Maybe it was too soon to call someone your best friend? He didn’t know the etiquette for friendship well enough yet.
He was fairly certain his dad knew him well enough to know what he was thinking, and he was pretty grateful when Gabriel put on his serious dad-face.
“Hmm, I wonder why,” Gabriel joked. “Maybe it’s because you’ve been talking my ear off since the second you could speak. I really regret listening to all those people who said I should read to you every night.”
He knew his friend well enough to know the look in his eyes meant he was hurt and had been thinking the worst. Dean wasn’t sure if it hurt more to know he’d hurt Cas or the fact that Cas thought so poorly of him. Did Cas really think Dean could just go home with a random chick just because she said hi to him? He wished Cas would have stuck around a few more minutes to see what Dean was trying to do—to realize that Cas never had to worry that Dean would go home with someone else.
Castiel’s range of motion wasn’t ideal with him just on his knees but he didn’t want to move. He liked the way it felt with Dean pulling him back down to meet each thrust. He liked the way it felt to let his hands rest of Dean’s chest as he steadily moved his hips up and down. His mind was blissfully empty, only sensation was coursing through him.
Dean followed Cas’s instructions mindlessly, pushing up onto his knees as Cas continued with his movements, only now his man’s hand wrapped around to tug on Dean cock just the way he liked.
Quickly, he managed to pull on his discarded boxers and made his way into the bathroom, sitting on the tile behind his friend—boyfriend, lover?—to rub his back.
“Oh, look who thought to finally stop by.” She said by way of greeting as she opened the front door.
He’d grown so much in his socialization too, making Dean so proud. Despite how hard it had been previously for Cas to make friends, he had a radiance about him that easily drew people in. Sometimes conversation could be stilted as he’d probably forever struggle with what to say, but his kind nature and gentle eyes put everyone at ease around him. He cared about everyone he interacted with, especially his students, always remembering little facts and hobbies people had just so he could ask them about it later.
Castiel didn’t know when the tears happened but they were there, dripping off his chin. That didn’t deter Bobby from continuing with his speech.
“We know he’s still alive,” Sam assured comfortingly. “Rowena said he had at least a month left in him. We have a month to find him.”
man, Mother. He is caring and loyal and funny and he takes better care of the people around him than anyone I’ve ever met. He’s the hardest worker I’ve ever met—he will do absolutely anything to ensure that is family is safe and happy even if it’s a burden on himself. He constantly puts others before himself. Knowing him he’d throw himself in front of a train for
He heard the sounds of Jack whining Emma’s name, clearly in a disagreement with his sister and Castiel couldn’t find the energy to address it.
“I was just thinking…. I can—I can prep myself if you don’t want to… I can—I can just do it all myself… I—I shouldn’t have assumed…”
He started setting the rules a little more intently. By Wednesday he’d gotten the kids down to just a few grumbles before they started on helping with the housework after their homework was done. He knew they weren’t necessarily happy with him for it but he appreciated the help nonetheless.
That moment Patience giggled cheerfully, across from them. Both boys looked at her only to see her eyes trail up and above their heads to reveal a red-ribbon wrapped bunch of mistletoe hanging from the rafter. She smiled at Dean with a look that Castiel couldn’t quite decipher at the moment.
When Gabriel finally disconnected the phone call, Castiel sank back into the futon and moped a little. He even decided to get in an episode of Grey’s Anatomy before Dean got home to cheer himself up. He could only watch it secretly, knowing how Dean felt about the show. (
He gave in to their needs—slammed his hips forward and pulled back, repeating the action until he could feel it down to his toes. He stayed pressed up against Cas’s back, giving in to his desire to bite a few small marks against the back of his shoulder and neck. It was all he could do to keep himself from spewing every thought he’d ever had, everything he’d ever wanted to say to Cas about how he made Dean feel.
Dean couldn’t take it anymore, he laughed loudly before tugging on Cas’s hand. “Oh shut up and come make out with me in the laundry room already.”
“Holding your hand at breakfast tomorrow,” he said with a kiss. “Kissing you across the table.” He kissed Cas again and again, punctuating each sentence with it. “Pulling you into a hug whenever I feel like it—Hearing you say you love me too.”
Dean didn’t bother with an introduction. He just stood in the archway looking upset and started rambling. “Please—please don’t take him back to New York. Cas belongs here. This is his home now.”
“For how long?” She asked him, probably already knowing the answer since Dean had been avoiding her calls for too long.
“Is that the only way you’re gonna thank me?” It was just a joke. He even threw in an over the top wink just so Cas wouldn’t think he owed Dean anything for being nice.
Castiel rolled his eyes at the non-answer. “You’re sexually active though—what are your thoughts on your partners having had other relations prior to yours?”
To his surprise Dean, Charlie, and the others had all remained his friends over the next few days. Each day Dean approached Castiel at his secluded spot and asked him to come join them at the inside table again.
“No!” Dean practically shouted. He back peddled quickly, not wanting Cas to think Dean was too eager. “I mean… it’s cool. It’s like—it’s like we’re pretending to have real sex. What it would be like, right? So you kind of need a partner for that right?”
Rowena seemed poised and ready to do this and started giving Sam directions for what would need to happen the moment the Grace was extracted, but Dean was too distracted to pay attention.
At that moment he was beyond grateful Dean hadn’t married into this—more grateful than he’d even been before.
His fondness for the boy, the young man he cared for as a son, knew no bounds. It secretly pleased him to see just how similar Jack was to Castiel only a few years ago. He was excited for all the young man would learn in his life.
He understood how Hannah could think that but he didn’t have the heart to explain to her that it was truly all Castiel’s fault. He was the one who backed Dean into a corner and made the man agree to be Castiel’s sexual awakening. It was Castiel who kept pushing the boundaries and asking for more and more of Dean despite knowing that Dean wasn’t interested in men. It was Castiel who blabbered all about his feelings even though he knew it would put Dean into an even more uncomfortable situation and so when it came down to it, it was all on Castiel.
Immediately, Cas’s hips pulled back before thrusting back in. Dean felt pleasure all the way down to his toes—it was heaven, nothing and no one could tell him otherwise. And maybe if they hadn’t been deprived of each other for so long they may have slowed it down and taken their time to just love each other lazily, but it’d been too long and the need was too immeasurable. Soon, Cas was thrusting into Dean hard and quick, leaving Dean to sink in nails into his man’s back as he moaned in pleasure at each push. Cas’s hand moved to wrap around Dean’s length and before he knew it Dean was tumbling full speed over the edge, screaming Castiel’s name. Moments later he felt Cas follow him over, releasing himself inside of Dean before collapsing atop him.
He couldn’t stop himself from pulling Dean into another kiss, deeper, longer, with a promise hidden somewhere inside it.
Suddenly Jo’s wide brown eyes narrowed in Victor’s direction. She kept her voice low to not key the other members of their group into their conversation but she was downright lethal in her whispered words to Vic. “You told them?”
“Claire, honey, I know you don’t want to talk but I’m here if you do, okay? I love you. Sleep well tonight. I’ll see you in the morning.”
Sam seemed to understand that Dean needed some time to be alone with his thoughts and got up with a final pat on Dean’s shoulder.
It was when Cas let out a whispered version of his name that Dean couldn’t deny him any longer. Gently he pressed the tip of the toy inside his friend and slowly rocked it in and out until Cas’s body accepted it fully.
He didn’t want to imagine what the pain of realizing Dean had moved on would feel like in the morning if it already hurt so damn badly.
It plagued him daily. Over and over he kept seeing Cas’s tears—the ones on the morning Dean ended things and the ones at the bar. Making Cas cry felt like the ultimate failure. He wanted so badly to be a good memory, one Cas could look back on and know he was treated well and cared for yet Dean wound up hurting instead. He knew Cas wouldn’t forgive him and Dean hoped, for Cas’s sake, he wouldn’t.
“I’m sorry for… that.” His love said with a vague gesture towards the bathroom. Cas shrugged and ran his fingers through his soft brown hair.
There was collective booing from all the guys that Dean handled with a very sophisticated middle finger in the air.
Every past experience they’d had suddenly screamed in the back of his mind telling him that he’d never be so lucky, that he'd lost the one thing that brought him hope in such a dark life. Why would he deserve to get Castiel back? In what world would Dean Winchester find his happy ending? It wasn’t in the cards for them. Things had been going too smoothly that it was time to rip the rug from underneath them.
With just those words, he felt twenty-three again. Looking at this man who said such beautiful things, who made Dean feel like he was on top of the world, he felt like that young man who had fallen so head over heels in love with a stranger with a flat tire that he almost couldn’t breathe. Even after all these years Cas still loved him the same and it was a magical feeling.
He was all too eager to feel that way again as he manhandled Dean onto his back, wasting no time in ripping his husband’s boxers away and wrapping his hand around that perfect cock. His own twitched in response as Dean’s back arched off the bed. Cas always was the more aggressive lover between the two of them where Dean always wanted it slow and tender but Cas couldn’t help but crave the frantic primal side of their lovemaking.
It made him so inexplicably sad to think about how Dean didn’t get to have that same look of pride in his eyes, the way Benny talked about his kids. Both Dean and Benny had been so excited to have kids born at the same time. Cas even knew that Dean had been going to Benny, getting his advice and learning everything he possibly could from his good friend about parenthood. God, how Cas just wanted Dean to have this…
Dean still didn’t turn to him. He was facing away with his shoulders tense. “The guy you were with… was he good to you?”
He tried to not focus on how intimate it was to feel Cas’s hands on him in such a seemingly innocent way. It felt like, with the way Cas’s hands were less forceful, less confident that maybe his friend was feeling that way too. Slowly Castiel dragged soapy hands over Dean’s shoulders and chest. He rubbed at the knots forming at the base of his neck, just hard enough to make Dean sag a little into the touch, dying to reach out and hold Cas against his wet body. His friend’s fingers moved over his skin, lingering over the softness of Dean’s stomach, making Dean flush in embarrassment but Cas didn’t seem to notice.
He didn’t know if it was the right thing to do but he couldn’t sit around and keep doing nothing. He spent the better part of the weekend moping around and feeling sorry for himself, wondering how long it would take to get over losing Dean again. Not much else had been said that night. Dean had just walked out without so much as a goodbye.
Even if he kept up his current speed, it would probably take him 3-4 hours to get there depending on the traffic situation. Normally, this would be a stroll in the park; today, however, he was physically and mentally exhausted, probably concussed, and hadn't slept at all during the last 24 hours.
Dean accepted the answer. He knew the feeling, and besides, he wasn't exactly keen on going out into the storm anyway. The coldness still hadn't left his fingertips. They had become numb at one point during the burial, a contrast to the unrestrained rage that had been ravaging Dean moments before.
Finally, Dean closed his eyes. His knees pulled up to his chest, using his arm as a pillow, he drifted off into sleep.
The hunter turned away from Dean. He grabbed his beer for the second time that night, and took an absurdly large gulp, before setting it down on the bar with an unnecessary amount of force. Although, it didn't seem angry. If anything, it looked like the attempt of a teenager trying to make themselves seem intimidating.
Deans' eyes snapped open at the sound of the deep voice. His vision wasn't trying to fade anymore, and his headache seemed to have lessened. Even the throbbing in his nose had vanished.
He seemed to be... uncomfortable, in a way. Squeamish. His posture seemed tense, but he was seemingly aware of it, trying to conceal it as best as he could.
A slight creak next to him. The shuffling of a too big trenchcoat. Dean opened one of his eyes, took another sip of his beer, and looked over to the hunter next to him.
While he was carefully touching his nose, examining what should have been a clean break, the stranger cleared his throat.
Deans thoughts however ran rampant, none of them uttered aloud, but they sounded even louder inside his own head.
The hunter looked back at him, unblinking. A slight twitch in his composure, tension rolling off of his shoulders. A blink.
His tone was growing steadier, more forceful. He wanted the man out, away from his car, away from him.
Dean turned around abruptly, shaking his head, and made his way over to the crimescene. Many hunters had many different skills, this dudes might just be stealth.
"No way, you just saved my life man. I won't leave you to clean this up on your own, that'd be a dick move. Come on, I got bleach and shovels in the duffel. Think you can dig in this weather?"
"Really? That where you hid after killing that poor bastard? Pretty small town, you were probably friends, weren't y-"
Outside, a man slowly walked past the parked car. He stopped for a moment. Let his eyes wander over the car, mayber linger on the backseat for a second too long. Shook his head, averted his eyes, and kept on walking, his trenchcoat dragging behind him atop the freshly fallen snow.
The spade hit the ground in shortening intervals, ever faster, stabbing the earth and everything beneath it. Dean let his rage flow. His breathing was heavy, the icecold air was streaming into his lungs unhindered. It made his insides burn, but he didn't care. Someone needed to suffer in his place, and right now, he chose the very ground he was kneeling on as his scapegoat. Dirt flew around him, his fingers were growing colder by the second, gripping the spade desperately with a force that could shatter mountains, but in reality, only damaged a tiny piece of dirt in the middle of the south dakotan winter.
Right there, behind the dead werewolf, stood the stranger from his car. His hair was disheveled, he was breathing heavily, and, most importantly, he was holding a bloody, silver battleaxe. He looked terrifying.
Deans' eyes found the axes box. It had been pushed aside after being opened and emptied. He wanted to put the axe back in its' rightful place, but there was still blood caked onto it, so for now, he took an old shirt and wrapped the weapon in it. It was starting to tear at the edges anyway, the blood would provide the incentive to finally throw it out.
Which was why, when he saw the dark shape in his headlights, standing tall and steady in his path, he almost had a heart attack. He thought he had finally gone mad.
His name lay thick on the mans tongue. The man licked his lips, and let his eyes wander over the tundra around them, almost longingly. The snow was beginning to die down. Then, his gaze returned to Dean.
Or he really was of a different nature, a new monster, undiscovered through the ages, now finally revealing itself for.. for what? What reason could there really be?
Dean had raised his voice, and was now completely turned around so he could stare at the hunter, who tried to avoid his eyes at all costs.
That made the driver sneak a quick look at his companions face. He didn't look old enough. Not at all.
Dean was breathing heavily, and almost didn't notice the hunter recoil from his harsh tone. Their eyes met.
Everything that happened next seemed to do so in only a few seconds, leaving no room or time for the driver to take a breath or realise what was going on.
The man, previously towering above him, battleaxe in hand, was now crouched beside him. His face, recently bathed in shadows, was looking a lot less dark, a lot less intimidating. The man cocked his head to the side.
The more Dean thought about them, the more the effects took hold. His head was pounding now, and his vision was beginning to falter. He was slowly crossing into slightly denser populated areas as well, meaning other cars on the road, meaning a bigger risk if he decided to keep driving like this. Disgruntled, Dean turned the music down. He needed to concentrate. With a heavy heart, he decided to pull over in the next best place, and take a nap on the side of the road. It was the only option he had if he wanted to arrive in Sioux Falls without crashing.
The driver was frozen in place, not daring to move a muscle. He was scared. It seemed obvious in the way he acted, but he wasn't used to the feeling, not like this anyway. The threats he usually faced were familiar. He grew up with them, knew how to handle them. Knew how to handle the fear. It's a very particular type of fear, when you know exactly what's coming, and you've dealt with it many times. It scares you, but does so in a way that you know, that you can contain. This wasn't the case now.
With horror in his eyes, Dean watched the wound close up, and the silver bullet drop to the floor. It made a high pitched clincking sound, and then it lay still.
Dean was fiddling with his drink, shooting quick glances at his companion, who was staring right back at him. The animalistic aura returned to him at once, and Dean couldn't help but cringe inside. It had been the wrong question to ask.
Dean used the last of his strength to lift his head and look into the creatures eyes. Here, in the darkness of the church, he saw something strange. The faintest whisper of a blue light inside of the wolfs iris, like the flickering light of a torch.
The driver slammed the drivers side door, sending a loud echo through the snow filled night. He pulled a gun seemingly out of nowhere, and aimed it at the man in front of him, who slowly lifted his hands toward his head, still calm, still with no trace of emotion on his face.
The most impressive thing in the entire sacristry was the window. It was directly ahead of him, and had once sprouted an intricate design, probably bathing the entire room in colourful light on a sunny day. Now, it was smashed. There was a gigantic hole in its' middle, haphazardly covered with old newspaper, which had been ripped open by the storm. The cold stormwind blew through the tiny room, and Dean noticed a puddle on the floor in front of it, where snow had gotten inside the building. He hadn't known about this. Nowhere in the news report had it mentioned a sign of a break-in, like, for example, a smashed window. Did it get ommitted from the report? Or did it only happen after the initial attack?
The hunter was holding his arm out, shovel in hand. Dean slowly lifted his arm and took it from him, keeping his eyes fixed to a point behind the man, trying to both hide his shame and show the man that he was both thankful and sorry. It seemed to work. The hunter nodded.
He was on a personal search, one might call it that at least, and he had hoped the beast could aid him on his way. Tough luck.
Rummaging through his things, Dean soon realised that the only equipment he had for digging was a military foldable spade. He mumbled a curse under his breath, and begrudgingly pulled it out of the bag, preparing himself for a very long night.
He spun around, gun already rising, when suddenly he was grabbed and flung violently across the room. He smashed into the harsh stone floor of the altar, barely shielding his head from breaking open from the impact. He fired blindly, two, three times in front of him, before opening his eyes, which had been tightly clenched before. There, across from him, stood the bartender. His fingers were sharpened into claws, his snarling mouth revealed rows of sharp teeth. There was blood dripping from a hole in his chest. Dean had hit him.
As he pulled out a bottle of bleach from deep inside the bag, his mind wandered. The hunter showing up at just the right time was a welcome experience, but also an unexpected one. He had been incredibly lucky. Even still, Dean couldn't shake the thought that something weird was going on. Everything was too coincidental. The hunter in the middle of the road, the bartender of all people turning out to be the wolf, and the hunter knowing exactly where to find the right weapon to off him at the exact right time. Shouldn't a hunter looking for a werewolf carry his own weaponry? Was it really necessary to borrow the axe?
Dean squeezed his eyes shut, and pressed out words through his fear, trying his best to not let them get stuck in his throat.
The man bowed his head, opened the door, and stepped out into the freezing winter night without another word. Dean was bewildered. Out of all the things he had expected to happen, this option seemed to be the least likely one. And yet, he sat in his car, unharmed, watching the stranger walk away into the darkness.
Another nod followed his statement. Dean assumed that this meant he was in the clear, and swiftly brought the car to a halt.
He knew the look on the face of his visitor. It may have been unassuming to the average joe, but for the bartender, it was like an open book, a tale untold, and oh so familiar.
The adrenaline had kept him from thinking too hard about the events that had just transpired, but now, as he was shuffling through his duffel to find cleaning supplies, he was slowly starting to think again.
He was already so close but he still didn’t want it to end. He wanted to stay like this, as close to Cas as he could possibly get for as long as he was allowed.
Dean shuffled himself over to the passenger side and threw Sammy the keys, not fully trusting himself at this point. His mind was usually clear when he was behind Baby’s wheel but with how out of his mind he’d been over all of this, he felt it was best to let Sam handle this drive.
Despite Hannah loudly disagreeing, and Benny (who’d figured out what happened with him and Dean through context clues) telling him that sex with a stranger wasn’t the best coping mechanism to cure a broken heart, Cas chose to ignore them both. He was convince if he just got it out of the way and slept with another person it would all be easier.
“Honestly? I don’t imagine that going well at all. That’s why I’m not gonna tell him. Not for a while at least.”
Sam hit the top of the car with a loud bang. “Fuck. I knew it.” He was seething. He looked like he might actually hit something but instead Sam walked towards his car. Castiel chased after him, probably a mistake.
Was Dean upset that Cas had met a guy? Was he upset because he thought Castiel slept with Aaron? Why was Castiel feeling completely unsettled by this? Why did he want to reassure Dean that nothing happened when Dean was the one who broke his heart and pushed him away?
“Cas, it’s true.” Dean argued, batting Cas away. “What good am I? I’m not smart like your or Sammy. I don’t have any skills. I won’t ever make a ton of money to support a family. I can barely keep clothes on our backs as it is now.”
Even though Chuck’s argument was sound, Anna still seemed to feel a need to poke at her father’s work. “What about the angel in the trench coat? I’ve never heard of the angel called ‘Misha.’”
By the time his phone was in his hand and one of the ride service apps was up, Lisa was back to slithering her hands up his chest and Cas was speaking in his other ear.
“Is… is that what you want too?” Cas asked with bated breath. Dean couldn’t hold it back any longer, he surged forward to capture Cas in a kiss, pulling back only when they’d run out of air. He kept their foreheads pressed against one another’s breathing in the moment.
Still, by the way he knew his mouth was actually gaping as he looked at Meg, he was definitely caught off guard.
Dean’s look was still that of confusion but he shook it from his features a moment later and smiled down at Cas again.
The house still felt off even though he and the kids were working together. It was like without Dean around their home lacked the same warmth they’d all grown accustomed to. Even the littlest ones were already itching for their daddy to come home.
The look was back in Cas’s eyes. Dean watched as the other boy peered down at one of the three gifts left with some sort of apprehension in his gaze.
The normalcy lasted only a few more days before Cas couldn’t fight off the anticipation anymore. He figured a Thursday night would be best anyway since they didn’t have classes on Friday and it’d give them the whole night. Not that he thought it’d take the whole night… but if it did, they at least had more time… Yes, he was quite nervous.
