“Yes, sir,” she said, sounding as if she was attempting to be as cheerful as possible. “It fits him like a glove.”
Despite the fact that it was nearly midnight, the lobby of the building Castiel lived in was abuzz with activity. Some people were standing around wearing fancy suits and dresses, like they’d just come back from having dinner or going to a play or whatever rich people did in the city at night. Some people were rushing around with luggage, looking as if they had somewhere to be. Through it all, Castiel quietly led Dean to the set of elevators on the right wall, pulling a silver card out of nowhere. He slid it into the slot near the elevators, then stepped back beside Dean to wait patiently for one of the elevators to come down.
, though, so Dean never had the chance to hope for him to accidentally kill him. No matter how much filth Dean spewed about his brothers, he never managed to get the dragon riled up. Alastair was precise and intentional with each cut he made, each burn and bruise and broken bone he inflicted on Dean.
Dean ate half the pie in one sitting, moaning obscenely at how good it tasted. “That’s the shit,” he said. He grinned dopily at Castiel. “Thanks, Cas.”
The bleak, emotionless expression on Castiel’s oldest brother’s face had his gut sinking. He shared a glance with Gabriel, concerned for his brother. The other Angel looked back at him and shook his head slightly, a reassurance that they’d fix this later.
Castiel shook his head as slowly as he dared, rubbing at his eyes instead of his temples to try to relieve some of the pressure. “It’s alright. I just… I get tired of him not being able to understand the word ‘no’ and all it entails. It’s frustrating, especially when the people he ‘sets me up with’ are expecting me to be single and open.”
Dean gave the doctor a small smile, though Castiel couldn’t see him because his gaze was on the road. “I wouldn’t, Cas, don’t worry.” He huffed a soft laugh. “You’re one of two people who knows about that. Two humans. One, actually. Mom’s dead.”
“Okay.” Dean clumsily wrapped his hands around his own burger, lifting it up and taking a hesitant bite. He chewed for a moment, then released a very undignified moan.
“Look at Benny!” Castiel shouted, pointing at the water like a child on Christmas. “Look at Benny!” He laughed, and time slowed enough for Dean to truly marvel at how beautiful he was.
what he did, Dean,” Castiel said quietly. “I know that no stupid bouquet of flowers and choice words will ever excuse it. And I know you would have accepted the apology anyway.”
Castiel’s eyes hardened at the mention of John. “I would do it all again. If anyone hurts you Dean, I will destroy them.” Something steely had entered his eyes. It made Dean realize just how gentle and soft the dragon had been around him, and just how incredibly cold and terrifying he could be when he wanted to. Gods, everything seemed so far from those months in that cave where they'd hated each other.
The partygoers in the circle jumped back in disgust, Anna letting loose a little screech. Michael cursed loudly, arm jerking away from Dean as if he were a disgusting rat instead of Michael’s sick soulmate.
Dean grunted as a cannonball of little brother struck him hard in the chest. Gangly arms that had more muscle than he remembered wrapped themselves around his torso, squeezing unbearably tight. The patented little brother scent reached his nose, along with leather and old pages.
Distantly, Castiel knew there would be no time for Dean to get the net off his wings. The human might not even do it, might not even care. Castiel had toyed with his life today, had betrayed his trust so deeply he wouldn’t be surprised if the human just let him get taken.
Growing up, food meant different things. Food meant entering in cooking clubs at school to ‘stay out of trouble,’ then winning cooking contests and getting scarce praise from his father. Food was what took Sammy’s mind off of their constant traveling, what made him smile despite the pains of growing up as a young pup without his mother.
Michael and Gabriel shared a glance. “That... sounds like a lot of speculation,” Michael finally said. At the low, rumbling snarl Castiel emitted, the oldest Novak held up his hands in an innocent gesture. “I don’t know the Omega as well as you do, Castiel, but it sounds like you could have misinterpreted a lot of things. What if he’s just on a grocery run?”
“Your Omega is sure Azazel’s there all day?” Luke asked, coming forward to sit in the chair backward. He tapped his fingers thoughtfully on the iron back of it, gloves making no noise against the metal.
When Coach Shurley gave the okay, Castiel shoved off the wall, streamlining halfway across the pool before breaking the water with a powerful arc of his arms. His shoulders stretched pleasantly as he broke the surface. He loved butterfly. Most swimmers hated it, but there was something about the precise rhythm and steady flow of it that Castiel was addicted to.
Dean frowned, likely wondering what sunscreen was, but Castiel was too exhausted to explain it to him. He dropped his books and the shotgun they’d taken by the other bed and toed off his shoes, grimacing at the doctor’s jacket he was still wearing. He’d have to take it with him, to avoid leaving a trail. He threw that down beside his books as well.
“John-“ Bobby tried from behind Dean, his voice loaded with an anxiety that sent dread racing through Dean’s veins.
“Good,” Castiel praised, grinning at the way it made Dean flush. He turned them so his back was to the headboard, spreading his legs a little to get a good angle as Dean straddled his hips. “You gonna ride me, baby?”
Dean looked up at Castiel’s soft blue eyes, feeling something catch in his throat. “So it is yours,” he whispered into the dim morning light.
“Are you going to come for me, sweet boy?” Castiel asks, voice tight with how much Dean’s moans are affecting him. If he hadn’t come already, he thinks he could do it now, just from watching Dean writhe in pleasure. “Are you going to be a good boy and come for me?”
“I’ve been swimming this two thousand for four years now,” Castiel replied. He frowned at Dean. “When are you going to learn to accept compliments?”
“I know that,” Dean replied easily, smiling. He was happy that Castiel had finally talked to him without prompting, despite how unfriendly the other boy still seemed. Maybe they were making some progress!
with him. Because really, that was all he needed in the end. Not the most famous bakery in Lawrence, not a billion dollars, not even his parents’ approval.
“Let’s head down to our lane,” Castiel muttered. He and Dean started down the stairs, Dean stretching his swim cap over his head. He’d just finished settling his goggles onto his forehead when they arrived at lane one, standing beside another team that was wearing orange and red. Dean took a moment to marvel at the hideous color combination, Ash and Garth hurrying to meet up with the rest of the Lawrence team.
Castiel stumbled as he tried to land, tail flaring out and whipping in a wide arc in his attempt to keep from stumbling and rolling over, inevitably crushing Dean. The human’s incredible flying abilities didn’t seem to extend to crash landings, however, because his weight soon disappeared from Castiel’s back altogether.
“It’s waking up,” Alastair muttered, sounding almost surprised. When Castiel looked back at his fellow observer, he found the other man holding the edge of the knife to the merman’s cheekbone, his gray eyes wide and curious. Despite his alarm at realizing the merman was waking, Castiel’s attention zeroed in on the blade and how very close it was to the creature’s eye.
After seeing Sammy, he’d sunk to his knees on the stable floor and cried with his not-so-little-anymore brother held tightly in his arms. That was how Benny and Jo found them. Benny very nearly broke Dean’s ribs when he wrapped him up in a hug.
Sighing shakily, Dean pulled out of the base and onto the road. His watch told him it was 22:06, meaning Castiel was likely already asleep. Dean winced, hoping his husband wouldn’t get
allowed to ride on a dragon’s back. Ever. To be ridden by a human was the biggest disgrace a dragon could bring upon themselves. It was humiliating.
“Yes. I believe Missouri said she was going to give you an ‘ass-kicking’, though how that is effective, I do not know,” Castiel told him. “She was quite upset that we went out and trained last night.”
If I haven't scared you off yet, read on! And if you need more detailed trigger warnings, please see the end of the chapter notes. :)
Dean kept that in mind as the doctor came back carrying several white pads and a strange roll. He smiled at Dean as he knelt next to him, reaching out with those gentle hands to press lightly on the edges of Dean’s gills.
Castiel held down the power button on his phone until the option to put it to sleep came up. He tapped that, then threw the device over to the couch where he wouldn’t have to worry about it. He
“What is ‘instant mac and cheese?’” Castiel asked, frowning. “I’ve had macaroni and cheese before, but never... instant.”
It was okay. He was going to be fine. He just needed to get some rest, and then he could fly east. He could get away, if only for a little while. Hopefully, whoever he met was someone who had never heard of Alastair or Syphon or Hell.
Instead of being soothed, Dean Winchester seemed aggravated. His face twisted with something frighteningly close to hatred. “The fuck you won’t. Get away from me.”
“They’re snacks I brought to last year’s State,” Castiel explained. “They really are very delicious. They’re not very hard to get online, either, so they’re a far better alternative than having to speak to that demoness.” He shuddered at the mere thought.
“How were your classes?” Dean asked as he grabbed a fork, eyes gleaming as he eyed the slice of pie Castiel had brought over.
Laying down with his shoulders out of the water was a little uncomfortable, and the edge of the pool dug into his back, but it was far better than sleeping in a cramped tank. This room wasn’t so bad, Dean supposed, just like the doctor that had commandeered it.
“It can’t hurt,” Castiel says, mimicking what Dean said from earlier, except with a tone of dead seriousness. When Dean laughs again, though, he smiles. “I would be more than happy to engage in more hugging with you, Dean.”
, sir, please!” Dean cries, eyes squeezing shut as he bucks off of the bed slightly. He’s trying to be good, trying so hard, and Castiel’s stomach twists with pride and love for the man beneath him. He conveys how pleased he is by rubbing the tip of his thumb along the throbbing head of Dean’s cock, smearing precome in and around the slit. Dean makes a noise that’s between a moan and a sob.
Garth laughed. “It’s fine, Dean. I’ll just pretend I didn’t hear it.” And with that, he plucked the bakery phone out of Dean’s hands, turned, and sauntered back into the front of the café, whistling as he went. Dean watched him go, still upset about the phone call, cheekbones flaming red.
“I’ll make the popcorn, you go change,” Dean said, eager for Castiel to change out of his suit. For some reason, it felt like the possibility of putting this whole nightmare behind them would be more attainable if Castiel wasn’t dressed like he was ready to go out.
this, that they were somehow going to beat these impossible odds. Castiel didn’t want to think like that. Not yet.
He laid down next to Dean, his arm draped over the human’s chest, and he listened to him breathe quietly. When Dean woke, they’d get back on the road and hunt the next thing. When he woke, they’d do it all over again. And when he needed correction again, Castiel would remember tonight. He would remember the way Dean trembled when he was praised, the beauty of the sounds he made at the height of ecstasy, the softness of the skin behind his ears. He would remember, and he would learn to cherish them.
“Nah,” Dean replied, shaking his head. “Super rare. Most of us are in hiding.” He didn’t say any more, just sat and waited for the inevitable. Castiel was smart. He’d get it soon enough.
“The idea is… not conventional,” Castiel admitted, shifting awkwardly in the booth seat. “I do not think less of you or your art because of something I cannot quite comprehend, however.”
“Good. I think… I think we can hold off five or six dragons,” Missouri said. She looked determined. “If there’s any kingdom that can withstand a siege, it’s Lawrence. We’re stubborn and strong.”
The guy swallowed, glancing around nervously. “I-uh, I don’t have a horse.” At Dean’s glare, he made a placating gesture with shaking hands. “B-But my cousin, he bought a horse for three gold pieces.”
“Okay. What are some differences between you and him?” Dean asked. Castiel looked a little confused, but he proceeded to list them off anyway.
Castiel sat back, staring at the unconscious merman in front of him. He looked at the little white bandages all over Dean’s body, the big one slapped right over the bloody wound on his tail, the horrific collar around his throat, the little slices in the flaps between his fingers. Cruelty so easily carried out, so thoughtlessly inflicted.
Taking pity on him, Castiel pulled out his buzzer with one hand and grabbed for the key to the restraints with the other. Carefully, he began to unbuckle the metal restraints, watching the merman for any signs of aggression.
Castiel groans and strips at his cock slowly, rubbing the thumb over the head in the way he’s learned sends sparks up his spine. Dean whimpers softly, green eyes glued to where Castiel is jerking off above him, hips making tiny movements underneath the heavy weight of Castiel’s body.
. It didn’t. Nothing he or Sam had just said meant a single Goddamn thing in the grand scheme of things. Dean… Dean could have a million reasons for lying. He could be scared. He could be angry. He could be… he could be ashamed.
“Calm the fuck down,” Michael growled, his Alpha rumble cutting through the tension that had risen up faster than Castiel could comprehend. Damn it, he didn’t think he’d ever lost his temper that fast.
They’d eaten the waffles on the way there. Dean had been surprised, both by how tasty the food had been and how much he liked sweet things. He still preferred the smooth, soft texture of fish over the dry, crumbly feel of the waffles, but Dean supposed they were tolerable. He liked syrup.
Dean frowned at him. “No, you can’t. You’re hurt, dumbass. Besides, I highly doubt you can lift an entire dragon by yourself.”
He stood, jerky forgotten, sauntering off to the back of the cave. Confused and intrigued, Castiel could do nothing but follow closely behind.
Castiel couldn’t speak. He stared at Dean’s furious face, at the tears that had been silently streaming down it for gods-knew-how-long. Dean was trembling badly, arms barely preventing him from falling flat on his back.
Castiel was still facing the sink, likely glaring down at the dishes and the soapy water. Dean felt his chest tighten at the waves of ire that he could feel radiating off of his angel. God, he didn’t
“Well, Jesus, Cas,” Dean said, tilting his head in that way that indicated he was ready for the fight Castiel had invited. Castiel sighed internally, wishing he’d just kept his mouth shut. The whole point of today had been not to hurt or upset Dean in any way. He supposed it was too late in that regard. Dean’s green eyes were bright with defensiveness and maybe a little hurt, a stark contrast to the dark shade of the bruise spread across his left cheekbone. “Maybe you
, Dean thought. At the same time, he remembered yet another thing he and his therapist had been talking about. There was a difference between
Dean gave his friend a small smile, despite the storm whirling in his head. He’d missed Benny’s wise words. “Yeah, I suppose that’s true. Has he… Has he burned anyone else? I didn’t even realize we still
Castiel hesitated, some of his anger dying. “Yes,” he admitted. “The War on Syphon is both of our species’ faults. I suppose… I suppose this situation is both of our faults as well.”
. It’s not just luring people, either. I’m pretty sure if I tried hard enough, I could liquify your bones.” While normal merpeople could send out soundwaves that could bring down ships, Dean had the ability to probably destroy them from the inside out. His voice was more than a beautiful lure to listening humans. It was a weapon of mass destruction, if used incorrectly.
“I, uh… I can’t… I don’t have an excuse anymore,” Dean said quietly. He looked up at Castiel, at his calm blue eyes. “My dad’s dead. Sammy’s in college. I have no one left. And I… I don’t
Dean chuckled, setting the bag of honey down gently on the hood of the car. “Sure, buddy,” he said, hugging Castiel back. “Happy birthday. You freaking deserve it, man.”
Castiel didn’t reply, just watched as Alastair stepped forward and began to help the guards roughly heave the merman out of the room. They didn’t even flinch when they banged his arm against the doorway as they left. Castiel watched after them, then quietly began to help the remaining guards pick up the body of their friend.
They had five minutes to change in the locker room before they were back out in the pool area. The water in this pool was way colder than theirs, so there was a lot of amusing whooping and yelping as the Lawrence Sparrows jumped in. Dean laughed joyously as he jumped in after Benny, Castiel following suit with an affectionate grin on his face. He loved Dean’s laugh.
It seemed their relationship hadn’t improved, even with their new alliance. Dean was still a stubborn, rude bastard, and Castiel was still floundering when it came to what he was actually supposed to
“Where is Michael?” Castiel asked. Dean once again wondered if his friend had mindreading powers. He sincerely hoped not.
If it hadn’t been for Castiel’s hand on his shoulder, he might have fallen over when he walked out into the stadium the next morning. They’d assembled the crowd early and had spared fifteen minutes to introduce each team as they walked through the doors. The Lawrence Sparrows, kings of State for the past fourteen years, were very loudly and warmly welcomed.
Dean put his hands up and gently tied the tie around Castiel’s neck. He was just as efficient as usual. Castiel looked at the refrigerator instead of his friend, unable to bear making eye contact with him.
No, swimming was out of the picture until they got past the shelf. After that, Dean would be home free.
According to society, no. Castiel knew what people thought of couples that didn’t share the same Soul Mark. He’d seen an old man spit on two women with different Marks in the mall once. He knew that people were working to change how that was viewed, working to normalize falling in love with someone outside the universe’s plans. Castiel often wondered if he’d ever find happiness like that. If he even
“I can tell you that he is very clever,” Castiel began. “He is also very prideful. More so, I hear, now that his brothers are gone. I wouldn’t be surprised if their deaths had little effect on him. In my opinion, he stole Dean with the intention to kill him simply because he was a threat, not for revenge.”
It was over way too soon, but Dean couldn’t help but side-eye Castiel for the rest of the extensive opening ceremony. He would
“Like this.” Castiel demonstrated by wrapping his whole hands around the thing and picking it up. Dean watched with wide eyes as Castiel brought it to his mouth and took a big bite, chewing happily.
Castiel’s pink lips quirked into a smile. “I didn’t mind. You’re quite amusing when you’re half-awake.” He hesitated, staring at his shoes, then looked up at Dean. There was something impossibly soft in his blue eyes. It disappeared in the next few seconds, so fast that Dean wondered if he’d even seen it at all. The assassin stood, stepping away from Dean’s couch. “Can you describe the Demon you came into contact with?”
Cas sighed. “My version of Dean… We have the same system, though our dynamic is decidedly different.” He didn’t punish Dean because Heaven had need for him and he shouldn’t be putting himself in unnecessary danger. He punished Dean because Dean was beautiful and precious, and
Castiel was rushing around in human form, shoving various supplies into bags. It looked… well, it looked like he was packing up. Like the dragon was planning on moving, which was ridiculous. They had nowhere to go.
Again, Dean wished they didn’t have to fight. He hated when they fought. Dean would honestly rather go on a coffee date with Alastair than fight with Castiel. He felt like the lowliest piece of shit on the planet when he was arguing with his angel. But he knew that tonight, he’d earned this argument.
Despite all the previous joking, Castiel wasn’t sure he’d be able to sleep at all. Not with Dean in bed mere feet away from him.
“Well, I didn’t,” Dean announced, grinning at Castiel with sparkling green eyes. He was already dressed for the day in jeans and a couple flannels, making Castiel feel very underdressed in his sweatpants. “Happy birthday, angel. Whaddya wanna do this morning?”
Seconds passed, and nothing came. What the hell? Dean tentatively cracked an eye, then jerked in surprise and fear.
Castiel shifted forms as quietly as possible, keeping his tail high so he didn’t knock anything over. Once he was in dragon form, he tried revving his inner fire a little.
with something, which was insane. Was he alright? Was Dean’s scent really that bad? The Alpha answered that question in the next few seconds. It looked like he was breathing through his mouth. “Your scent is amazing.”
smaller than Alastair. Smaller and younger and most likely less skilled in combat. He was built for flying, not fighting. Dean was built for fighting, not flying. It would make sense if they worked together.
Second, why the fuck was he awake at six on a Saturday? No one in their right mind would be up at that hour. As soon as Dean tried to roll over and force his body to go back to sleep, though, he knew it wasn’t going to happen.
This morning, though, he frowned at the empty space between his arms, the cold spot on the other side of the bed. This was
“It was… uh, good,” Dean said, because he couldn’t really think of anything else. It had been good, right? “I’m going tomorrow. At seven. I’ve, uh… I’ve gotta see if that suit I have still fits.”
“Yeah,” Dean said, feeling an irrational amount of anger toward the stupid bomb fireworks and the stupid parade people who had thrown them. “They should’ve come with a warning or something. Those fuckers.” He glared down the street, where the parade was long gone, and wished he could punch one of them for hurting Castiel.
“Ask if you… if you killed it,” the guy said in a hushed, excited whisper. His eyes raked up and down Dean’s form. Apparently, that was the thing
Thinking of Castiel leaving, of him returning to his normal dragon life, did awful things to Dean’s chest that he would rather not think about. In fact, he was beginning to get accustomed to that feeling. It invaded his thoughts every time Castiel spoke about his past with a wistful tone. It was obvious that the dragon missed his life.
Castiel lifts Dean’s head gently and ties his tie around his hunter’s eyes. He can feel as Dean’s body tenses and relaxes underneath him, a gut reaction to being tied up and rendered blind. Castiel puts a gentle, steadying hand on Dean’s arm, a soothing reminder that he’s safe. After a lifetime of hunting and fighting, it’s no wonder Dean has a reaction to being put in a position where he’s unable to defend himself. Castiel’s whole goal is to make him feel safe and loved, though. The angel hums quietly, pleased, as Dean relaxes.
“Yeah, we have to write up some stuff on exotic spices and what they can do with the four main components of food tasting,” Dean replied. “I’ll probably be ready for your questions in an hour or so, if you’re still around.” He smiled hopefully at Castiel.
“You’re just gonna ignore me, huh?” he demanded. His voice rang loud in the large cave, raspy and broken, but stronger than before.
“Please what?” Castiel asks teasingly, moving to the other nipple. He still doesn’t do anything, waiting for his good boy to ask.
“Oh.” Dean tried to ignore how the ugly, hurt feeling in his chest turned into something light and tentatively happy in the snap of a second. Was he really that pathetic? Apparently. “Oh, well that’s… that’s good. I think.”
Dean pressed into Castiel’s knee subconsciously. His friend pressed back, a gentle weight. It was enough to settle Dean’s mind a little, help him push back the whispering voices until they were nearly unnoticeable. He didn’t want his time with Cas to be ruined by the echoes of his father’s words.
That was a lie, and they both knew it. This Castiel didn’t understand at all. But maybe, with the opportunity Cas had been given…
“That would be a genius idea,” Balthazar agreed. “You could make a killing off of all the stressed-out businessmen and IT employees that live there.”
“Didn’t fuckin’ tuck my head,” Benny panted. “I got screwed over by the new starting blocks, wasn’t used to ‘em. That was my bad. Sorry, Novak.”
He looked down at the sleeping boy on his lap, contemplating Dean’s butterfly. It really was flawless. Dean’s body, technically, was better suited for it. He had longer arms and broader shoulders. His bowed legs made for surprisingly good dolphin-kick, too. Besides, he was the hardest worker Castiel knew. Maybe...
Hell was the second-largest mountain in the Ryuu range. The largest was Syphon, where the Air Palace sat at the peak of an extinct volcano. The floor of the palace itself had been formed by lava flows thousands of years ago. Syphon wasn’t active anymore, but Hell certainly was. Alastair, the Dragon King, kept his treasures in one of the caves on the south side, Dean included. Castiel’s cave was on the far northern tip of the Ryuu range. His safe-house, one of two, was located in the valley next to one of the smaller lakes.
Dean smiled again at just the thought of seeing him, glancing at the clock to calculate the distance and time, trying to figure out how to keep his promise of coming home today. If he wanted to make it back to the house before tonight officially became tomorrow morning, he’d need to get someplace seven miles away in... less than ten minutes.
Dean sobered a little at the sight of some silver blood mixing with the red. “Now we patch you up. Then we drag these assholes over to their village and string them up for everyone to see.”
And that was how Dean found himself staring down the next problem of this situation: how the hell two grown men were going to fit into a tiny college apartment bathtub.
Even despite the good feeling, he couldn’t help but notice how cold his arm felt now that Castiel wasn’t touching him. As Castiel grabbed an ice pack and insisted on applying it, Dean couldn’t help but wish the bruising on his wrist was on the other arm, maybe a little higher up and a lot darker.
“Yes,” Michael agreed, frowning. “Maybe a little too much. Do you have any suits that won’t highlight the excessive muscle in his shoulders? Maybe slim down his waist a little, make his legs look less… crooked?”
Castiel took a seat in a chair and spread his notebook on his lap, reaching for the merman’s left arm. It was finely muscled, the line of tendon and definition flexing as he rubbed his thumb tentatively against it. The merman’s skin was surprisingly warm, not cold and clammy like Castiel had expected. The doctor hummed and wrote down some notes.
“Dean?” Castiel asked quietly, underneath the sound of the guns and dynamite exploding on TV. “Dean?”
Castiel, who’d been trying to cool himself down by periodically dunking his face under the water, promptly inhaled a mouthful. Benny reached out to pat him on the back as he hacked up chlorinated water, breath catching in his throat as he choked out a, “What?”
When Castiel hung up, there was a message from Arthur confirming that they had a date on Wednesday at six o’clock.
a heart, who deserved the things they were wishing for, and who were good enough for whatever — or whomever — it was they were pining for.
“Fishing for something, Meggie, darling?” he asked. He chuckled. “Where I come from, it’s easier to just
First of all, I want to thank all of you for reading this and for sticking with me so far (or for trying this in the future, when it's finished!). I appreciate the time y'all take to read and kudos. :)
Dean nodded, green eyes still wide with arousal and that trusting look that Castiel was pretty sure he could get drunk on. There was something primally satisfying about having Dean, his powerful, strong, beautiful Dean, coming apart beneath him.
. He never would be, either. Dean would just have to let him go and be happy about it. After all, it was for the best.
“Of course,” Castiel says, resisting the urge to pull back and look at Dean. Seven more seconds. “Why wouldn’t I be?”
“Cas, you don’t have to—” Dean cut himself off with a sigh and an exasperated look as Castiel handed him the jacket he’d just summoned. The hunter put it on at the angel’s answering glare. They were both wearing T-shirts, but Castiel wasn’t bothered by the snappy bite of the Kansas winter morning. Dean, on the other hand, was shivering badly. He was also human, which meant he could actually catch colds and things like that. Castiel wasn’t about to let that happen on his watch.
“Just saying,” Benny replied, holding up his hands in a ‘don’t shoot’ gesture. “You and Dean were pretty chummy and now you’re not. It’s—”
They finally pulled away, but only so that Castiel could tug Dean into the kitchen. Sex and kissing and all those fun things could come
Alastair flicked his tail, his wings angling as he dove toward them. A roar like thunder rose from Castiel’s chest as the dark dragon rose to meet him, wings pounding the air around them.
“Hey there,” Dean said, giving her his usual charming smile. “We’re looking to get a room. You got any?”
“I hope you’re good with just cheddar,” Dean said, peeling a slice of cheese out of the wrapper and placing it on the sandwich. “I’d use better stuff if I could afford it, but you know how it is.” That was a stupid thing to say. How the hell could the guy ‘know how it is?’ Dean didn’t know jack shit about him.
The nature documentary progressed. Sometime when they were talking about the hunting habits of lions in Kenya, Dean stirred and began to wake. Castiel loosened his grip on his friend, no small amount of trepidation flashing through him. Was Dean going to be upset? Was he going to suddenly jump off of Castiel’s lap?
Missouri let Dean out of the infirmary a day early. She could probably tell that he was about to vibrate out of his skin.
Agony was not a stranger to Castiel. The scars on his body were a testament to that. The burning, bleeding expanse of his back was not the worst he’d ever felt, though it certainly came close. It ached even now, in the cold air of the night sky. But the pain was muted, second in importance in the face of the utter panic coursing through his veins.
Castiel did a low sweep of the lake one more time, relishing the stretch of his wings, then came back to the beach to land. He found Dean on his hands and knees, vomiting onto the sand.
Castiel didn’t seem to move for a moment. Dean’s eyes strained as he struggled to make out the dragon in the darkness. Then the dim shadows began to fucking
“I’m not!” Dean shouted. He reached up and ran rough fingers through his hair, yanking none too gently on the ends. “I never fucking
Dean snorted. “Wait until we kill the crazy tyrant dragon king first, Cas. You can marry me after that, I promise.”
Eileen held up three fingers. She swept her arm in an arc, mimicking the sun’s path across the sky, no doubt. Three days. Shit.
shake her hand like she’s some sort of street bum like the people you spend your time with.” Michael glared at Dean for a little longer, then pulled back and released his wrist. Dean exhaled and rubbed at the skin gingerly, wincing. Michael watched him with barely concealed disgust. “I suppose this is my fault. I don’t know why I continue believing you’ll somehow learn proper manners overnight. That was humiliating.”
I promise the whole story isn't like this! I need to set the tone for Dean's relationship with Michael. The next few chapters after this one are actually quite lighthearted.
There were plenty of assassins who weren’t as ethical as he was. Hell, he wasn’t entirely sure he was ‘ethical’ himself. There was nothing
He called in sick from work, panic making his hands shake as he tried to tell Bobby that he was sick. His boss-slash-surrogate uncle didn’t seem angry. He sounded more concerned than anything when he told Dean to take it easy for a week or so. Dean thanked him profusely, hung up, and promptly had a mini-panic attack on the floor of his bedroom.
turned to look at him. Dean’s vision was too blurry by now for him to make out his angel’s expression, but he would bet twenty bucks Castiel was
Castiel hummed, frowning slightly at the idea of Dean eating only mac and cheese for dinner and nothing else. “Aren’t you going to eat anything more?” he asked, taking in the hollowness of Dean’s cheeks and the boniness of his wrists. “If you can afford to feed me, then perhaps you should eat more.”
Every practice was spent trying to shed minutes, seconds, milliseconds. Every hundredth of a second counted. Every time Castiel pushed off the wall, he was swimming his hardest.
Next was candy. Clyde thought hard about it, since it was close to food, then figured Castiel would enjoy chocolate. He’d already decided taht Castiel would be a better target of all these gifts, since he was dense, but Dean was denser. It was the best Clyde could do. Nodding to himself, the ghost listed
Liam had jerked with surprise, turning to face the enormous mass of humans as they all seemed to collectively panic. It was confusing, twisting Dean's foggy, pain-addled mind. The prince listened on instinct. If he focused hard enough, he could hear the shouts and screams of the crowd begin to take shape, forming the one word he never thought he’d hear again.
Castiel wasn’t sure if he was referencing the State time or first place, but both could have applied. When Dean came out of his flip-turn on the wall, he was a full four seconds ahead of everyone.
And here it was, the defensiveness that Castiel had been anticipating. It was so much worse up close, right here in front of him. There was anger on Dean’s face. Or at least, enough fake anger that it looked real. Castiel was pretty sure that Dean was terrified, but he was trying desperately to hide it.
Dean was his lifeline when it came to talking to people. Castiel was awkward, painfully blunt, and so straightforward that people often thought he was just rude. He wasn’t. He never tried to offend anyone. He had just never mastered the art of talking to other human beings like Dean had.
“You aren’t a waste of space,” Castiel said. “I understand that you’re not feeling good, though. It’s okay.”
“Dean?” Castiel asked. He didn’t even mind the uncertainty that colored his voice, too worried and uncomfortable. What the hell was going on? “Dean?”
Dean was tempted to ask why Castiel was here, but he didn’t want to know. He had a terrible feeling that asking would make Castiel realize that he had no real reason to be here and that he’d leave. Why Dean wanted someone who was certifiably dangerous to be spending time with him, he didn’t know. Maybe he was lonely.
“I told you the truth,” Castiel said, voice breaking slightly with the weight of words that had been held in for far too long being released. “My happiness isn’t at the bottom of the ocean, and it’s not on dry land. It’s wherever you are.”
Once again, a massive thank you to the beautiful, wonderful, thoughtful people who comment on my chapters. You guys make my day every damn time. Seriously, it's fucking incredible what one person, twenty or so words, and a comment box can do to change my entire mood. Thank you. *insert heart emoji, because I'm on a computer and I can't do that*
The wingbeats became a thud in his ears, loud enough to be a good sized dragon, but not enormous like Ishim or any of Castiel’s oldest brothers. Maybe he could fight the dragon and knock them out before he made his escape.
“Come inside,” Castiel said, voice warm and kind. “It’s freezing out here. I told you to bring a jacket.” He shook his head, smiling to show he wasn’t mad as he stepped aside to let Dean in.
, and it seemed that they weren’t as foolish as Castiel had thought. They spread out a little, making it impossible for him to cut to the side and run back around. His only option was to keep going straight ahead and pray he could make it to the cave with enough time for Dean to untangle his wings.
Castiel had Dean stay in the car while he went in to get rooms. He wasn’t sure how long they could keep Alastair’s truck, but he hoped that the chaos of the fire and the explosions in the compound would be enough to get them a head-start on their inevitable pursuers. The only good thing working in their favor was the fact that Dean was still a top-secret project. The board of scientists wouldn’t send out information to the public or the police just yet.
Coming back to himself was a slow process. He became aware of his breathing first, oxygen sawing fast and hard through his lungs. Castiel was braced on his forearms and his knees now, his body still trembling with the aftershocks of such an intense orgasm. It was only when Castiel opened his eyes that he remembered his husband, Dean’s gorgeous face mere inches away.
Thanking the other boy, Castiel hurried down the stairs to catch up with the team, Dean following closely behind. Dean nearly slammed into Cam as they came to an abrupt stop at the bottom of the stairs, but Castiel’s grip on the back of his team sweatshirt stopped him from colliding with their teammate in the nick of time.
Dean practically slept through making coffee, but he woke up more once the smell of it began to fill the apartment. He and Castiel had gone to bed late the night before. Dean had made sure to stay up and clean the kitchen, then had dragged himself to bed at around one in the morning. It was about noon right now. He’d slept a long time.
in a motel room while waiting for the power to come back on. They hadn’t spoken to each other during the entire five hour ride the next day.
Dean had just bent down to open the freezer when he heard a noise behind him. Jumping, heart leaping in his throat, he whirled around to find Castiel sleepily snacking on a piece of bacon on Dean’s plate.
“Perhaps we cannot end the war separately,” Castiel murmured, raspy voice low, “but together, we might stand a chance.”
“When we captured you,” Castiel managed, feeling a little cold, a little sick, “were you trying to kill us? Were you going to bring the boat down?”
“C’mon, we gotta set these off,” Dean said, the last part of his sentence lost underneath the crash of a massive red explosion above them. “Here, have this one.”
Dean leaned back against the counter, silent for a moment as the microwave whirred between them. “Honestly? I’m not all that into all the fancy shit that I cook at the school. I like good ol’ fashioned stuff, you know? Bacon and eggs and pancakes.” Dean whistled lowly, turning to pull the mac and cheese from the microwave when it dinged. “I haven’t had pancakes in years. I love that stuff.”
“Impala,” Dean murmurs, cheeks pinking slightly as Castiel guides his hands up to the hidden hooks they’d installed a few months ago, when they’d first gotten into the kinky aspects of their sexual relationship. Castiel makes sure Dean’s arms are in an acceptably comfortable position, then binds them expertly to the wooden hooks with the soft rope he’d retrieved from their box.
Castiel smiled, ignoring the lingering urges to kiss Dean, and nodded at the time board. “Congratulations to us
“Put it the fuck to sleep! It’s gonna fuckin’ kill us!” someone shouted, deep and loud and way too close. Dean reached up and covered his ears with his hands, sobbing in fear and confusion. The air was too thin, he couldn’t fucking
The Sparrows had taken first in several events, and had placed in the top five of a few others. They had a solid handful of swimmers that had qualified for Regionals and State, which was some of the best numbers the high school had seen in years. The coaches were beyond excited. The buzzing energy of the team was impossible to ignore, tired as Dean was now.
He couldn’t, he realized, as he watched Dean bounce around his kitchen, excitedly naming off various appliances and tools that Castiel had never thought he’d use in a thousand years. He still didn’t quite understand all of the things Dean named off, but the confusion was worth it in exchange for Dean’s bright joy.
“Long as Benny makes it in under thirty seconds, we’ll be good and qualified,” Cam added, grinning at them all. “Congratulations, Novak. Looks like you get a shot at that record after all.”
Dean had just made it back to Cas when the firework hissed and took off, leaving a trail of smoke where it had launched. The rocket squealed, high-pitched and warning, and Dean had barely enough time to brace himself before it exploded above them with a massive, resounding boom. Castiel’s delighted laughter was lost in the echo, but Dean saw it well enough.
Castiel laughed at his enjoyment, then was promptly horrified by the fact that Dean had eaten the entire container. He claimed it wasn’t healthy, but Dean didn’t care. Good stuff was
This had been a bad idea from the start, but Dean supposed it would have only been worse if he’d wanted to go suit-shopping by himself. Michael was right not to trust his judgement if he constantly made bad clothing decisions, anyway. Dean was too stupid to do this kind of stuff.
can do this,” Dean countered, pulling away. He smiled at Cas, at his beautiful face, at the gleam of excitement and passion in his eyes. “We can do this.”
Did I ever tell you that sometimes I like to do the exact opposite of what everyone wants? :) Yes. Yes, I do.
There was no time for delay in a meet where there were fourteen high schools’ worth of swimmers participating. The referee called the first swimmers into the water almost immediately after everyone was confirmed. Dean jumped in on the long whistle, his broad shoulders bunching as he drew himself up in a ready position.
Dean managed a choked laugh. He reached up and wiped harshly at his eyes, ashamed for the two or three tears that had managed to slip free. Castiel shifted, and then a warm arm settled around Dean’s shoulders, pressing him up against Castiel’s firmly muscled body.
Castiel squeezed his eyes shut at the thought of Dean feeling ashamed for being abused. The very idea made his heart feel like it was being clawed to shreds.
that you’re in trouble. I know because you’ve been in trouble before and you haven’t done a single Goddamn thing to fix it!”
Dean’s arm muscles burned from scraping the razor edge of his blade against the metal of the trawl net’s attachment. He gritted his teeth and thrashed his tail in frustration, gripping the cord tightly to keep himself from being propelled away from the little cut he’d started to make. He’d been at this for nearly five minutes now, and he was barely a quarter of the way through.
Castiel didn’t respond. Instead, he did something he’d seen a human couple do once on TV. He turned his head to the side and pressed a gentle kiss to the soft skin behind Dean’s ear. The human shivered.
Dean gritted his teeth, fighting back the urge to growl at the man. If he didn’t acknowledge the human, maybe he’d go away. Unfortunately, even his anger was making the doctor excited. Castiel moved around the back of the tank to the side, eyes wide as he took in the green-gold arch of Dean’s flared dorsal fin.
“Good, actually,” Dean half-lied. “Cooking has been going well, at least.” He eyed the apple Castiel had been eating, shifting a little awkwardly as he noticed that the Alpha was dressed in his usual all-black armor, while he was wearing only a thin shirt and some sweatpants. “Uh, what did your ‘superiors’ think of your new info?”
His Baby was sitting in the corner of the parking lot where he’d left her when he’d gotten to the base that morning, dark and shiny underneath the flickering light above her. Dean smiled tiredly at his car, barely mustering the energy to grab a towel to sit on so he didn’t ruin her leather seats with his wet uniform. He wasn’t about to hurt his Baby just because he was exhausted.
“Four,” Castiel replied. “And that’s only because I don’t want you to eat an entire five-sixths of a pack all by yourself again.”
“Dean, it looks like you broke apart your skull,” Castiel replied, frowning. “There’s a lot of blood.”
Before you threaten to kill me, just remember that there's one chapter left. ;) I await your predictions and death threats in the comments.
Thankfully, the prince was smart. He’d roasted the meat of the last rabbit he’d killed, and there was some stored in the bins Castiel had in the back of the cave. Most of the things back there had been taken from unlucky human travelers and abandoned, upended carriages. Castiel hadn’t bought them from any towns, and he hadn’t killed the humans he’d taken the items from, unless they attacked him first. He didn’t think he’d ever been really,
be different. That Dean could go home to his soulmate instead of his best friend. That Cas could be his, and that he could be Cas’s.
It seemed to do wonders to the human. When Dean blinked, his gaze cleared and he eyed Castiel with more clarity than before. When he spoke, his voice was still raspy and painful, but it wasn’t a whisper anymore.
Castiel ducked low to avoid the sudden lashing of a spiked tail. He didn’t quite make it, though, and Alastair’s barbs raked over his back. Dean yelped, terror flashing through him as his left leg was suddenly clawed away from Castiel’s body.
Dean bared his teeth, attempting to snap at the man, which earned him a jostle from Alastair. “Behave, cunt,” the Alpha snarled.
Castiel hummed softly, sounding sad. “You aren’t bad, Dean. I understand that your past experiences make it hard to trust a Dom, but believe me when I say that I want you here. You… You were like a blessing from the heavens, when I first met you. You practically fell into my lap, the perfect Sub. You appreciate me for who I am. You never once questioned the fact that I was a Dominant that didn’t want to have sex.”
Castiel put a hand on the small of Dean’s back, guiding him through the doorway and down the hall to the kitchen. The Omega wasn’t sure if the touch was meant as an apology or a distraction, but it registered as both. “I was. I cannot cook anything worth eating that can be qualified as a ‘breakfast food,’ but I didn’t want to make you cook anything.”
On Monday, they went back to class. Everything felt kind of different, while still being the same. Castiel found himself wondering what he was so happy about, then remembering what he got to go home to. Dean by himself made everything brighter. Knowing that Dean was
Sam shrugged. “I actually broke us out. We were just raiding the armory so we could get to you when the dragon came in. The guards came for Missouri. Soon after, everyone was shouting about Da-about John being dead.”
“Wait, wait, wait,” Sam cut in, interrupting Dean mid-sentence. “You said you don’t have to walk home alone? Who’s walking home with you?”
Castiel expended a few extra seconds to fold the sheets back, frowning grumpily at Dean’s pillow. His adorable robe was still in its place on the dresser, so that meant he wasn’t wearing it. Dean was even less of a morning person than Castiel was, so the angel had no idea what his hunter was doing. He’d be damned if he wasn’t about to go find out, though.
.” Michael gave a low, frustrated growl and kicked out at Dean in anger, the hard end of his dress shoe catching Dean painfully in the hip. “You fucking ruined
Dean grumbled sleepily, shoving his face into Castiel’s stomach again. “Doesn’t matter,” he mumbled into the thick fabric of Castiel’s team hoodie. “You’re prouda me. ‘S all that matters.”
Castiel scissored his fingers again, working on getting Dean stretched for his cock, which was hard enough to cut diamonds by now. Castiel ground down against Dean experimentally, biting his lip to keep from groaning loud enough to wake the people in the next room. Dean moaned, head coming up and then falling back to the pillow. “Kiss me?” he panted, breathless.
“Yeah,” Dean said, but he sounded unsure of even that. “I was fine, Cas. It was fine. How many eggs do you want?”
Castiel didn’t understand that sometimes. Couldn’t he be whole by himself? Couldn’t he love who he wanted to love without having to share a matching tattoo?
“I guess there’s everyone to blame, then,” Dean said quietly, fury simmering just underneath his falsely calm words. “I guess it’s just everyone’s fault, huh? That how it is?”
“But—” Dean cut himself off with a sob. It was a small, ugly noise, full of the kind of raw agony that could only be attained by ripping open a festering wound.
Frowning, the Omega sat down on the big king bed. The sheets were still rumpled, though they were cool to the touch. Dean buried his face in the pillow instinctively, searching for a scent, and chirped without meaning to when he found one. It was faint, just the smallest trace of honey, ozone, and rain, but it was there. Dean snuffled at the fabric of the pillowcase for more of Castiel’s scent, then began searching for it in the sheets of the bed.
Dean sniffled pathetically and tried to get up, feeling like the lowest piece of shit in the world as he wobbled to his feet. Michael grabbed his collar and immediately punched him right in the face, his fist making a sickening noise when it collided with Dean’s cheekbone.
The ash-gray dragon was curled peacefully around the second-tallest mountain peak within viewing distance. Lawrence’s walls backed right up against the base of the Ryuu mountains, meaning that Alastair wasn’t far. Merely a few miles, perhaps. He was looking down at the city with glowing silver eyes, the chest and throat plates of his underbelly glowing at the cracks.
Dean looked like he was going to die of humiliation, so Castiel decided to spare him by ceasing his compliments. It didn’t stop him from deciding the prince was adorable when he blushed, though.
The elevator, thankfully, was quieter. On the fortieth floor, an elderly Omega and Alpha couple got on. They got off a few floors later, leaving Dean and Castiel the elevator for the rest of the ride up to the ninety-fifth floor.
you doing tonight, Cassie? Nothing to study for, so do you have a date? Surely you aren’t going to simply sit around.”
Dean frowned, shaking his head as well. “That’s not true. You’ve given up so much for me Cas. Hell, you risked possible death by human-mob so you could save me from my murderous father.”
Dean didn’t protest. He grabbed his angel’s hand and quietly followed as he was led out of the kitchen and up the stairs. The sheets of their bed felt cool and strange against his skin when he slid underneath them, but they warmed soon. Castiel’s body heat helped. Dean could tell his husband was tired too, since he wrapped around Dean like a grumbly octopus the second he got the chance. Castiel pressed a sleepy kiss to Dean’s forehead, settled in, and almost immediately fell asleep.
Castiel’s ears perked a few hundred yards off, catching the sounds of metal-on-metal and voices. He followed the noises to the source, and there, crouched in the shadows of the forest, he watched.
Castiel pounded his wings hard, heading for the northern wall. He couldn’t see any dragons yet, but he figured he’d spot them once they got closer. That proved to be a wrong assumption, however, as Castiel swooped over the wall and saw nothing.
“No,” Dean said, looking up at him with something strange in his eyes. “I just… I mean, I was just asking. I get it if you, uh… If you wanted to wait for your soulmate or whatever. I just know that dating outside of soulmate relationships is more common now. More accepted, y’know?”
Azazel was slate gray. His eyes were the bright yellow of a predator’s, and his teeth were neat and sharp. He was enormous, easily bigger than the Great Hall and the stables put together, and he stank of sulfur and smoke.
Behind him, the team began to file in, whooping in various levels of volume and excitement, their joyous shouts echoing off the inside of the pool building. The sound was slightly swallowed by the large space, adding to the warm, heavy atmosphere. The familiar gurgle of the water in the filters was pleasing, comforting in a way nothing else had ever been. Castiel smiled appraisingly at the pool, the clear pale blue of the water. They’d just gotten new starting blocks the past summer. He was excited to use them.
something so badly as I did your father when I saw him laughing at your pain. It scared me. And before, when I killed Ishim… That scared me too. The sheer magnitude of the things I would do to protect you are unimaginable.”
Dean blubbered out another sob, shame and guilt flooding through him. “N-No, God, no, I d-didn’t mean that, I swear, sir—”
He needed time. He needed to pray that Michael decided to leave Dean alone for a few days. He needed to make sure Dean rested and stayed far away from his phone. And he needed to know exactly what to say when the time came. He would have to be very careful. He’d have to pray that Michael didn’t just say something later, and that if he did, Dean wouldn’t believe him. For all that he was good for, Dean Winchester was terrible at accepting that other people cared about him.
Dean shrugged. “Don’t get offended, man. It’s true, if we’re comparing you to Alastair. I can’t fly, so that’s a weakness of mine, and-“ He broke off, eyes flicking to Castiel.
Interesting. Castiel observed the human’s reactions, noting that he seemed a little more relaxed now. It was a good thing, the angel decided. It would help Dean learn his lesson better, at the very least.
Unsettled, Castiel went back to trying to sketch the merman’s tail. It truly was beautiful. There were the two main fins, massive and each as long as Castiel’s arm. Then there were the two on the sides, higher up, about where a human’s mid-thigh would be. Those were the same as the ones on his forearms— spiny and strong, but able to be flattened and flared where the two main caudal fins were rigid and unmovable. The last two tail fins were the smallest, near the large base fins and obviously used for direction. Castiel looked at his notes on shark tails and the anatomy of certain tropical fish, smiling a little at his confirmed theory that merpeople’s tails weren’t too different.
It looked... empty. More so than would be typical of a Saturday night. Castiel could see the lights on inside, but there were no cars around and no customers coming in and out. Odd.
Castiel rolled his eyes. “Very funny, Dean.” He didn’t sound too offended. They both knew it was true. Out of the two of them, Dean was definitely more of a ‘people person.’
Dean climbed out of the car and winced at the dirty stain he’d left on the seat, murmuring an apology to Baby. He’d clean her tomorrow morning. In the meantime, he stumbled around to the back and pulled out the bag he’d brought with him on the hunt, swinging it over his aching shoulder. His body throbbed painfully as he locked Baby up and headed for the rest of the Bunker proper. Again, Dean was reminded that he was getting old.
“That’s good,” Castiel managed, hoping his voice sounded normal. “Tell him we’re excited to see him as well.”
When Castiel used his fire, it seemed to make the surrounding air boil. It was so hot, Dean could feel it on his face. He could feel the faint heat of it as it traveled up the dragon’s throat, underneath his knees. It was as terrifying as it was awe-inspiring. He was very glad he wasn’t on the receiving end.
Castiel nodded. He took some of the boxes from Dean and turned, listening as Dean’s footsteps crunched through foliage as they moved back through the trees. “Was it a pleasant experience?” Castiel asked tentatively, wondering why he feared the answer. “Being around humans, I mean.”
“I just keep pushing water,” he said, glaring frustratedly at the starting block. Castiel calmly treaded water beside him, running through the start Dean had just performed in his head.
Dean, to his shock, wasn’t taken back to his cell. Instead, the dark-haired doctor carried him out of that horrible, bloodstained examination room, through a series of hallways that Dean tried to memorize but ended up forgetting, and into a large room that had a massive pool at the end.
that Dean was freaking out. He smiled. “We’re not doing any swimming today. Today, everyone gets here, we have the opening ceremony, and then everyone goes to bed. The actual swimming will be tomorrow. We’ll go home on Sunday morning.”
The tentative smile on Dean’s face slides off immediately. “Uh, sorry,” he mutters, face heating quickly with embarrassment. He feels like he’s going to explode. He drops his arms quickly and turns back around, cursing himself for being so fucking greedy.
“Do you not want me to accompany you?” Castiel asked in his calm, rumbling voice. Dean was pretty sure he could tell the Alpha he would look good in a sparkly pink dress and Castiel wouldn’t be fazed. It was as annoying as it was awe-inspiring.
Castiel somehow got Dean inside. Dean leaned on him for most of the way, too exhausted to hold himself up anymore. He had no idea how Castiel managed to hold his keys, his phone, the pizza box, and Dean, but he swore his friend was magical sometimes. Castiel helped Dean into the main room, sat him down on a chair at the dining table, and hurried to put the other things in his hands away.
Dean blinked and straightened a little, glancing to the side where Cas stood, watching them. Castiel ignored him, looking to his older counterpart. Cas frowned a little. “My Dean calls me ‘angel.’ He told me that ‘sir’ reminds him too much of his father.”
Castiel tilts his head softly to the right in that gentle way that makes Dean’s whole chest squeeze. “You thought if you hugged me, I would stop hugging you?”
Castiel considered. Not much, if he was being honest. He was outnumbered. The men looked to be stronger than him in every regard, and they had weapons. Long-range weapons.
The weekends weren’t much better. Dean was able to take a nap halfway through the day, which was nice, but other than that his weekends were spent doing homework and working at the diner. Sometimes he did both at the same time, keeping his assignments in the little pocket of his apron to finish when his boss wasn’t looking.
Castiel blinked, eyebrows rising. “Historical fiction,” he said. “I… I write a lot of historical fiction. Lots of research.”
He knew. He’d seen. He didn’t want to see any more, and maybe that was the problem. Because even though he didn’t
“Dean, look at me,” Castiel ordered. Dean blinked his eyes open blearily, somehow unsurprised to learn that he’d started trembling again. Castiel’s face was unreadable, but his eyes were ever-patient and gentle. His voice was soft but firm when he said, “Let’s see if we can get something to eat, alright?”
Castiel stood even slower, a gentle rise that contrasted greatly to the sudden movement from the beach earlier the day before. Dean still gripped tight with his knees, unable to help himself.
“Well, whatever,” Castiel grumbled, taking a savage bite of the muffin just so he could take his anger out on it. “I’m going on a date.”
“Then I suppose I should fly away and pretend I never saw you,” Anna said, glancing back at the sky.
“That’s good, sweet boy,” Castiel said softly. He smiled, hand coming down to cup loosely at Dean’s neck. His thumb stroked gently at the soft spot behind Dean’s ear. “I’m so glad to hear that. I’m so proud of you for coming to me for help, Dean. You’re such a good boy.”
Castiel gently put Dean’s wrist back in his lap, then stood and flicked a knife out of a hidden sheath with a violence that seemed harsh and furious in light of how softly he’d been touching Dean. The Alpha twirled the knife in his fingers, looking down at the flashing blade.
He was pretty sure that moment at the airshow had been the moment he’d fallen in love. The flying bug had bitten him, and it hadn’t let go since then. There was nothing quite like cruising through the sky at a speed that would mean certain death if he made a wrong move. Not even the rumble of Dean’s Baby eating up miles on the road could quite compare to the roar of a fighter jet engine. There was nothing Dean loved more.
“’S not that funny,” he said. “My dad said it was really inconvenient. They had to buy a bigger tub.”
First, the kitchen really needed scrubbing. Dean’s skin itched a little. He needed to do something with his hands, and cleaning seemed like the perfect solution. He went for the bathroom, which held all their cleaning supplies. The bathroom needed cleaning too. Dean mentally added it as an item on his to-do list. He’d clean it after he finished with the kitchen.
“Because you’re my... my friend,” Castiel replied, swallowing through the stammer in his sentence. “You’re someone I respect and... and care about. You don’t deserve to spend your heat somewhere that you don’t feel safe. I have an empty penthouse that I hardly ever use. Why wouldn’t I offer it?”
He squeezed his right front foot gently, reassuring himself that the human was still there. From the limp quality of the prince’s body, Castiel guessed that he’d passed out. That was fine. As long as he wasn’t dead, everything would be fine.
She gestured at the other guard, who was staring at Dean like he was a ghost. At Jo’s motion, though, the guard turned and yanked on the lever that would let the gates open. They creaked as they slowly swung inward, just like they had when Dean had left. He gave a tearful grin up at the wide wooden slats, knees wobbling as he took his first steps back home.
“Shit, Sammy, you have to be in class? What the hell are you talkin’ to me for?” Dean demanded, straightening and glaring at the same skyscraper he’d been talking to for the past ten minutes.
“Thank you, Cas,” Dean finally said. “I don’t know how to make it up to you, but I’ll figure it out at some point.”
“Fuck you, Novak,” Benny growled, getting mad now. “I don’t have those kinds’a feelings for Dean. I’m his friend, though, and I don’t like seeing him hurt. Just because you can’t handle not being the center of attention doesn’t mean you should start being a jerk.”
“Start at the beginning,” Castiel tried. “How can you speak English? How have you survived more than three times as much as every other merperson we’ve ever captured?”
Dean groaned as he righted himself, his body aching. He had a bunch of cuts and scrapes on his face and arms from tumbling around on the sharp rocky mountainside, trying to dodge swinging tails and fireballs. He was pretty sure he’d lost half his arrows that way too, which made him kind of mad. Maybe he could convince Castiel to fly them back up there after things cooled down. Arrows were freaking expensive, and it wasn’t like Dean could go back into the human town anyway.
Dean was sleepy and pliant, his body soft and warm against Castiel’s. Castiel knew that, come morning, there’d be the usual frantic rush to get up and get to where they needed to be on time. They might argue over whose socks were whose. Dean might accidentally brush his teeth before he ate breakfast, and Castiel might forget to cover up the bruises on his neck again. Dean would
The apartment felt strangely empty as Dean got dressed and shuffled out to make coffee. He guessed that Clyde was still gone, though where a ghost could go, he had no idea. Dean wondered if Clyde would ever talk to them again. If he did, Dean sure did have some questions for him.
Up until that point, Castiel had put up with being insulted, fired at, clawed, and burned. Even before this fight, he'd never been sure of his place among dragons, too used to how they looked at him strangely, laughed at him behind his back.
Castiel squeezed his eyes shut, forcing himself to refrain from asking. He already knew, anyway. It would only cause Dean more grief to recount what had happened. Besides, Castiel wasn’t entirely sure he was going to get the whole story. An awful part of him wondered if Dean deliberately didn’t tell him because he was ashamed of what had been exchanged between him and his soulmate.
He was covered in vomit, sweat, tears, and blood. He’d made a thorough fool of himself and of Michael at the party. Dean had no doubt that this was his biggest fuck-up yet. He laid on the floor for a moment, letting shame and humiliation wash over him in waves.
they make such a powerful creature feel such fear? Castiel was nearly to him, and as Dean fired another arrow, he came level with the prince. Castiel stumbled to a stop a few feet away him, panting and bleeding from his right leg. He dragged himself the rest of the way.
He had no words to describe how lonely he’d felt after his father had died. Bobby had offered him a place to stay, but Dean hadn’t been able to live with himself, knowing he was burdening the old hunter. Sam was still in college, hadn’t answered any of Dean’s texts or calls. Dean was all by himself, and in those weeks after his father had died, the world had seemed so
He returned to observing the merman’s tail, gently dragging his fingertips along the ridges of the scales. They looked green for the most part, but around the merman’s hips and curving in swirls down to his caudal fin, Castiel could swear he caught flashes of gold. The iridescence was nearly blinding if he caught the right angle. The merman’s tail was as beautiful as his face.
He felt like such a waste of space in that moment that it brought tears to his eyes. Dean tried to blink them back as they exited the hallway leading to their bedrooms and entered the living room-kitchen space, but he couldn’t seem to shake the emotion. He didn’t deserve how nice Cas was being to him. All he wanted to do was go back into his room and lay in bed.
Dean gave him a drunken smile. “Th-Thanks,” he chattered. His clothes were soaking wet, and he was now starting to feel the chill of the night air.
No. Castiel wasn’t going to be that person that imposed on his friend’s more personal affairs. Dean probably wouldn’t appreciate that. Castiel didn’t want to cause him any trouble. He stayed away from his phone.
Dean was still on his hands and knees, though. He’d stopped vomiting finally, but he hadn’t moved a bit.
They were heading for an outcropping of rock, a ledge about as big as the drawbridge that laid across Lawrence’s castle’s moat. Dean realized a split second before it happened that they were landing.
Castiel narrowed his eyes at Dean, that flicker of hope and inspiration disappearing underneath a glow of anger again. “I suppose it’s typical of a human to be so jaded and selfish that they wouldn’t even
too hot. He was aware that he was being stared at by the three humans still in the room. He could see the blond guard, Jo, watching the exchange with wide eyes, her hands over her mouth.
Dean was quiet. He didn’t eat, didn’t drink, didn’t move. He just laid on the hard stone floor of the cave, facing the wall and pretending to sleep.
“Make us proud, Winchester,” Benny said lowly, giving Dean an encouraging smile. Dean nodded, not trusting his voice to create intelligible words.
to make it home on time. He hadn’t meant to be late, he hadn’t meant to piss Castiel off. He just wanted to curl up on the couch or the bed with his head in his angel’s lap and sleep, maybe even with Castiel’s fingers carding through his hair in that way Dean pretended not to like.
“I don’t see why it’s a problem,” Castiel conceded, wondering in the back of his mind what the hell he was even doing. “It’s better than what my brothers call me. I don’t appreciate the nickname ‘Cassie.’”
Castiel responded by snapping his hips forward. They both moaned at the drag of his cock in Dean’s hole, the wet slide of their bodies together. Castiel did it again at a slightly different angle, grinning as Dean threw his head back and gave a high-pitched keen. Castiel fucked into him again, panting, and aimed to hit that place every time.
“I don’t want to hear it,” Castiel cut in, shaking his head. He winced at the action, resolving not to do that for a while. His head still ached like someone was beating it repeatedly with a hammer.
They watched the rest of the movie. Castiel started up another one, probably to keep Dean’s attention so he didn’t start doing something stupid like getting off the couch. Dean wasn’t sure he even wanted to do that, at this point. Impossibly—since he’d only been awake for three or so hours—he already felt sleepy again. They were halfway through the second movie when he found he couldn’t keep his eyes open.
“Dean, what the fuck?” his little brother interrupted, voice going from calmly conversational to righteously pissed in about two seconds.
When Dean killed Alastair, the gray dragon would crumple and fall from the sky. Dean would fall with him. Dean wouldn’t survive, with how high they were hovering. Dean was going to die. Dean
Castiel rumbled in agreement, flicking his tail a little to propel them away from the shore they were nearing. He wasn’t really trying hard to stay afloat. His widespread wings were keeping them buoyant, his slowly churning legs causing them to move slowly through the water.
, Castiel thought, squeezing his eyes shut. He needed to stay calm. He had to give this a day at least. He couldn’t put all this stress on Dean. Not yet.
When the water was hot enough to start steaming, Dean peeled off his muddy clothes and stepped into the spray, letting loose a soft moan as the warmth hit his aching muscles. Castiel snapped his fingers, making Dean’s pile of filthy clothes disappear, then began to undress himself. Dean watched appreciatively as his angel’s skin began to appear, first his arms, then his chest, then his lower half.
They both ducked as four pens at once flew at their heads. “Clyde is much more violent than I thought,” Castiel breathed, watching as the projectiles clattered against the far wall. “Evidently, he wasn’t pleased with that.”
It was actually kind of endearing, the way Castiel snarled at every new person to enter the room. If Dean wasn’t so annoyed because he constantly had to apologize and try to calm the person down, he would have been touched by the protectiveness Castiel seemed to retain for him. The dragon hadn’t left his side — or his bed — since he’d woken.
just another monster fight. And Castiel... he was just as bad as the giant squid, or the shark, or the eel and pufferfish and all the other creatures Dean had fought all his life. Castiel was just another monster, just another scar with a story to tell.
Dean had never been overly concerned with his own food choices. He’d raised his little brother growing up, so he knew how to choose groceries that would nourish a growing kid. Sure, he liked his cheeseburgers and pie, but at the end of the day, he knew how to eat healthy.
Slightly confused, Dean dared to enter the bedroom, blinking around. He only realized he’d brought his stuffed bee with him when he set it down on the bed, poking into the bathroom and walk-in closet. Castiel wasn’t there.
me like I’m some Goddamn damsel in distress! What the fuck do you think I am?! I can save my own ass if I fucking want to!”
Castiel woke with a sudden jerk. He found himself flat on his back, wings spread out underneath him like a pool of ink. His back and leg felt like fire, his entire body wet and cold. He blinked his eyes open slowly, groaning, and heard a sob above him.
“It was raining very hard earlier,” Castiel commented, glancing out the window. It was pitch black outside, but he could still see the slow patter of rain falling easily from the sky. “Was your landing a challenge to complete?”
Dean got a week’s worth of food from the deer Castiel had accidentally killed. After that, he went hunting again.
“Fuck!” Dean yelped, looking down at his fingers. He’d just sliced through the pads of three of them because he hadn’t been paying attention while cutting his potatoes. Blood, stark and crimson, began to ooze everywhere.
From the look on Dean’s face, Castiel’s lack of knowledge was evident. “Cas, I can’t cook the judges
“I suppose ‘Castiel’ is a bit of a mouthful,” the doctor mused. “My brothers have always shortened it to ‘Cassie.’ I don’t think I like that very much, but I’d be willing to endure it if it was easier on you.”
“I can’t even begin to put into words how disgusted I am with you,” Michael snarled as he slammed the driver’s side door shut behind himself. He turned to glare at Dean, his gaze a cold fire on Dean’s cheek. “You know, when I was little, I always wanted to meet my soulmate. I didn’t really care for gender, since I trusted God to lead me to whomever I was meant for. I was simply excited to have someone I could love and could be loved by in return.”
“No, Dean,” Castiel soothed, turning his head to press a gentle kiss to Dean’s temple. “You’re okay. I’m not angry with you. I
echoing in Dean’s ears as he tucked himself tight to the dragon’s back. There was a moment of terrifying weightlessness, gravity dragging Dean straight to earth, and then Castiel’s body was beneath him and they were coming out of their upside-down curve.
“You gotta light the end, Cas,” Dean said over the noise. He laughed at his friend’s confused face. “Here, like this.”
“The subject isn’t cooperating,” one of the guards said by way of explanation. His voice was tight. “It killed Ricky.”
Castiel wanted to say no. The thought of Dean helping him prepare for a date that wasn’t with him felt so fundamentally wrong, it almost caused a physical reaction. Dean was right, though. He couldn’t tie his own damn tie. Dean always did it for him. It was one of their inside jokes. Right now, it felt like a direct opposition to the natural order of the universe.
that’s how you’ve been feeling, Dean. I see it every time you come back from spending time with him. He’s ripping you apart.”
Castiel stopped the motor, allowing their vessel to come to a gentle stop on the surface of the smooth water.
What the hell are you talking about?” he squeaked. Of all the places he’d seen this conversation going,
He ended up following them both out of the pool when they climbed out to help the freshmen in the first event figure out where they were and what they were supposed to do. Dean directed a few to their lanes, explaining that it was written on the starting blocks. They seemed pretty okay after that.
The man with the torch, Liam, swallowed thickly. His face was twisted with sadness and disdain, most likely for what he was about to do. It was hard to remember, sometimes, that Dean was a hero to these young men. That he was a legend among his people.
“I’ll have someone come in with food soon,” Castiel promised, hoping that would at least garner a reaction from Dean. The merman didn’t respond, though.
Dean laughed. “I’m glad you don’t have to talk to her either, Cas,” he said, before he could even think to stop himself.
“It’d probably be fun,” Dean said. “I mean, it’s a party. When’s the last time we’ve gone to any of those? You should get out more, Cas. And Meg ain’t too had on the eyes, either. Maybe give her a chance.”
Dean swallows, tentative. “No,” he says, quiet. “Uh, I think… I think you’re pretty spot on. But, uh, I think you missed something.”
He supposed he could stop eating pie. He could probably work out more, too. Go for runs, spend more time in the gym. He needed to stop eating so much, anyway. That was something even Sam had told him, once. He ate a lot and he ate it fast. Dean guessed it was some residual habit from when he was a kid and wasn’t sure whether the food in front of him was going to last.
“Very well. Now that we’ve decided, Dean, I would like you to tell me what you think you’ve earned tonight,” Castiel said. They always did this. Dean usually always guessed higher than the number in Castiel’s head. Some nights, Castiel went with his own. Some nights, he went with Dean’s. He hadn’t decided which one he was going to do yet.
“Come on, Castiel!” Benny shouted from behind Dean, leaning over to see the race. Every one of them looked up to the board the second Castiel touched the wall, save for Cam, who was already jumping in.
He stormed out of The Trickster to get in his car and drive back to the apartment he shared with Dean. Castiel yanked on his seatbelt, frustrated when he had to slow down and pull it out slowly to get it to work. He felt like he wanted to punch a hole through his windshield. He wasn’t sure why that conversation had been so upsetting. He wasn’t sure, or maybe he just didn’t want to admit it.
Dean still tried to make friends with Castiel at practice. He even gave him a nickname, which the other boy didn’t seem to find very amusing. He never outright objected to it—and yeah, that was probably because he never really spoke to Dean at all, but whatever—so Dean never stopped calling him by it.
“I was finishing up, anyway,” the scientist muttered, putting his bloody scalpel back on the cloth he’d laid out. “You can take over, I’m done for today.”
Dean watched as his friend moved around the kitchen, opening the fridge and the pantry as he went. He wondered if Castiel hated this, if he wished Dean had just stayed in his room and not burdened him with his problems. Probably. Dean was a waste of time.
Cas looked at him sharply. “Take care of him. Dean deserves to be taken care of, doesn’t he? He’s been very good. A very good boy.” Dean keened quietly, his head jerking just slightly so he could nudge into the gentle petting.
The five hundred was always long, but the sixth heat only lasted a few minutes. Dean swam just fine, coming in third in his heat with a respectable time of six minutes. Castiel could probably beat it, but not by much. Freestyle had never been his best stroke.
“Uh, y-yeah. Goodbye, ma’am,” Dean stammered. He winced as Michael tightened his grip even more, something painful shifting underneath his skin.
“Your tail is absolutely breathtaking,” Doctor Novak said as he returned. He smiled down at Dean’s two sets of supporting fins, shaking his head in wonder. “I would stare at them all day, if I could.”
The dragon was right. The sky was a dark gray, clouds heavy with rain. They’d flown in rain before. Dean’s grip had slipped multiple times on Castiel’s slick scales underneath the torrential downpour. He had barely noticed at the time, too focused on laughing at how loud Castiel’s wingbeats sounded when his wings were wet. It was a pleasant memory.
“Dean is not associated with me in any way other than business transactions and the exchange of information,” Castiel bit out. “He happens to work at the diner you are all
He tried not to limp as he walked to go get water. His left knee was starting to hurt, along with the multitude of other aches and pains currently making his life a living hell. Dean smiled at people he passed, trying to seem normal, and desperately looked for the table with food that he’d seen on his way in.
Castiel closed his eyes and squeezed his hunter against him, reveling in his ability to do that. He felt like he could get drunk on all the things he was
Dean clenched his jaw, fighting back tears for the third time in as many miles. God, he was fucking pathetic. He needed to get his shit together and get the fuck
There was a slight delay, the crackle of comms, and then the response. “Hunter zero-five-bravo, you’re cleared to taxi at alpha six.”
Dean swallowed, knowing the answer. He’d known what he’d wanted a long time ago, and it wasn’t a life of hunting. Hunting was hard. It was brutal. It was worse when he was all by himself. Dean hated being alone. Even when his father had been with him, he’d felt isolated. The hunting life hadn’t been for Sam, so Sammy had left.
The hunt had been a couple hours away, so by the time Dean got back to the Bunker, he’d sort of dried off from his plunge in the river. He was still wet and cold, but his hair wasn’t dripping wet anymore. It had dried sort of crusty from the muddy water, which was disgusting. Dean silently prayed that Castiel was asleep again. He needed a shower. He’d feel better after a shower.
Castiel frowned. “Maybe they should come over here so we can practice relay starts. We haven’t seen much of each other.” Their relay hadn’t qualified for State, but they’d definitely qualified for Districts. They were swimming tomorrow. They needed to practice.
so Goddamn much about something meaningless like Dean’s ability to sleep. Dean couldn’t deny that it felt nice to have someone think about it, though. He knew it was a stupid, selfish thing to think, but he liked knowing that Castiel cared.
“I’m having dinner with my boss on Thursday,” Michael said. “I want you to come with me. My boss is bringing his soulmate; it’s only polite that I bring mine. You’ll come and you’ll behave, and perhaps I can consider forgiving you for this whole mess.”
Teeth gritted with determination, Dean swam right up to the thick metal coil that connected the trawl net to the boat. His blade—enhanced by deep-sea magic and runes inscribed by the sea witch Rowena herself—merely vibrated when he hacked at the sturdy metal. Dean swung again, gritting his teeth at the tiny nick he’d made. This was going to take forever.
Castiel blinked and suddenly found himself and Dean being shoved through the wall of guards. One more door and then they were out in the fresh air, the nighttime stars winking at them. It must have rained recently, since everything felt damp and cool. Fifty feet to the right, an ambulance waited, crowded with medics and injured guards and scientists.
“Shhh. Alright, that’s fine,” Castiel soothed. His hand swept upward slowly, stroking softly through Dean’s hair instead of just resting on his face. The feeling was so nice, so familiar, that Dean felt his eyes begin to prickle. Castiel stroked a gentle thumb across his bruised cheekbone every couple strokes. “I know you aren’t the best at taking care of yourself. That’s okay. That’s why I’m here. I’ll take care of you. You’re okay, Dean. You can let go.”
Castiel made him toast and cereal, unable to cook anything else. As he did, Dean turned on a kid’s cartoon and asked, absentmindedly, “Anything cool happen while I was asleep?”
He actually blinked in shock when he felt a familiar thread of heat run through him. The warning expression on his younger self’s face was familiar, like looking into a mirror. A raised eyebrow, the tightening of his mouth, the flash of darkness in his blue eyes. The flicker of understanding and apprehension in answering green as Dean realized exactly what was going to happen tonight.
His hands were encircling the shackles on Dean’s wrists, the soft pads of his fingers brushing up against the tender skin of Dean’s inner wrist. The human shivered at the gentle contact.
They moved around the festival, going from stall to stall. Castiel lost count of how much honey they sampled. When he found some he really liked, Dean unceremoniously purchased a jar of it and put it in a little bag that apparently he’d brought just for the occasion. It was probably the hundredth time that day Castiel wanted to just pull him in and kiss him.
Castiel frowned down at the handwriting, thinking for all of three seconds before he realized. “Oh my God,” he breathed. “Oh God. Dean...” He looked up at the green-eyed boy, his own eyes wide with amazement and realization. “Dean, I think
Except Dean feels more and more guilty as the days go on. He doesn’t really remember when Castiel started hugging him a lot, only that it happened a while ago and Dean is still not reciprocating. It makes his skin itch to accept nice things without at least showing his gratitude for them. Dean shows his gratitude best through physical gestures, like making dinner or fixing people’s car or something. The answer to expressing his gratitude to Cas seems simple, but Dean can’t get past the idea of the angel rejecting him.
“My job is to test psychological and physiological responses to stimuli,” he said, grinning down at the sleeping merman, something flashing in his gray eyes. “You’re meant to record what it is, but I’m meant to observe what it
“You look perfectly fine as you are,” Castiel argued in that matter-of-fact way of his. Whenever he talked like that, he always made everything he said sound so obvious, like saying the sky was blue or the Earth was the third planet from the Sun. Only what he’d just said was
Castiel turns to his hunter and gives him a soft smile. “Of course, beloved.” His mind is already racing, flying through the endless possibilities of what they could do. He looks Dean in his shy green eyes and reads what his soul is telling him, what Dean is silently asking for.
Castiel watched him with serious, gentle blue eyes. “Okay. Would you like some of those brookies I made last night? I’ve tested them, but I don’t trust my own palate. You make a great taste-tester, anyway.” He smiled kindly at Dean.
That was where they were now. All of the supplies Castiel had deemed necessary to bring from his main cave had been dragged here in the dead of night. They lay at the back of the cave, piled in nondescript boxes and containers.
Realizing that they were probably done for now, Castiel bent down and collected his discarded notebooks, which he’d been so excited to fill. He had nothing to write in them now. He’d promised Dean he wouldn’t write about hunting, and he intended to keep that promise. It was the least he could do.
him. Castiel knew that dragons hoarded treasure; he'd done so himself, though not always with conventional gold and jewels. This time, though, he'd hoarded something far more precious than any kingdom's riches.
fun.” He held up a black device. Dean’s eyes widened as he recognized the buzzer that controlled the shocks on his collar. As he watched, Alastair turned up one of the dials, fiddling with the other. “We’re going to have a blast, pet.”
Dean pulled away at that, feeling as if he was physically tearing a part of himself off as he ducked out from Castiel’s embrace. “I don’t need a babysitter, Cas.”
“Cas?” he shouted over the rush of the wind. His legs were numb with how hard he’d been clinging to Castiel. Dean’s eyes streamed, the wind tearing the moisture away from them so fast he had to blink repeatedly to even
Castiel slammed his hips up against the backs of Dean’s thighs, his hands sliding up Dean’s legs to bring his knees back toward his chest. Dean gave a whimpered cry at the slight angle change. Castiel had hit his prostate.
His friend watched the movie quietly, stopping to ask a few questions only when it was clear he was very confused. Dean didn’t mind. It was amusing to explain to Castiel why Indiana Jones’s hat was so important to him.
More sobs, more tears. Castiel didn’t get angry or annoyed. He never got upset with Dean, save for when Dean did something stupid or hurt himself. He was endlessly patient, the kindest human being Dean had ever known. Dean was so, so lucky to have him.
Dean blinked sluggishly, his gaze glassy as he swept it around the cave. Castiel realized, distantly, that the prince’s eyes were the most shocking shade of green he’d ever seen in a human.
They walked along in comfortable silence, staying close together as the daytime crowds thinned out and gave way to the nightlife of the city. Castiel wasn’t afraid of anyone anymore, but he did notice how Dean tended to duck closer and behind him if they came near a particularly large group of Alphas. While Castiel didn’t doubt that the Omega could take care of himself, a group of six or more Alphas hopped up on pheromones and God knew what else would be a challenge even for him.
Work that night was miserable. Dean’s hand ached and he had a hard time writing orders because of it. He nearly cried when he realized he had a table full of twelve people to take care of, nine of which were screaming children. The night seemed to never end. The combination of a humid day and an unresponsive grill in the kitchen meant that customers were cranky and had to wait longer for their food. All of that added up to a massive headache for Dean, who bore the brunt of everyone’s annoyance and anger.
Dean felt a sort of sick feeling start up in his gut. He didn’t trust a word out of this psychopath’s mouth, but somehow, Dean had a horrible feeling that Alastair wasn’t joking. If Cas wasn’t coming... what the hell was he going to do? He couldn’t kill this asshole, he just knew it. The man was way too intelligent for that, first of all, but second, Dean seriously doubted his own safety if he killed one of the head scientists of this whole operation. He had a horrible feeling that he was well and truly stuck here.
Castiel remembers the earnest intensity in the Hippie Lady’s voice when she’d talked about humans needing hugs, though. He feels anxiety twist his stomach at the thought of how few hugs Dean’s been getting throughout his entire life. This is not good. When was the last time Castiel even touched him? This morning, when he handed him his coffee? But that was only a brush of their fingers, and even that had been enough to make Dean’s cheeks stain red with embarrassment. If he couldn’t even handle that, how is he going to handle eight hugs a day?
Steeling himself, Dean headed toward the kitchen. He clenched his hands into fists at his sides, his entire body practically trembling with tension as he walked down the hallway and stepped into the doorway of the kitchen. He got his first look at his angel from there.
of humans. The soldier in Castiel couldn’t help but think that one well-placed fireball could cause mass destruction.
without ever giving it a rest. Those bastards deserved to be taught a lesson. Despite what Sam said, Dean was more than capable of bringing down the boat and they both knew it.
“So, are you going to tell me what you have planned for today?” Castiel asked as they climbed into the Impala and started off for the diner.
“Wanna go over some of those maneuvers again?” Dean shouted into the wind. “We’ve got a few miles ’til we reach the mountains.”
Good morning/afternoon/evening, my dear readers! How are all of you? Any snow, where you are? We were SUPPOSED to have snow, but someone fucked up the weather and now we don't. :( I want snow.
Dean couldn’t see any major burn marks on Alastair as they wheeled back around, so he figured Castiel had missed and he had managed to hit the Dragon King with his arrow. He obviously hadn’t hit the bullseye, since Alastair wasn’t dead. Dean supposed it was the principle of being hit at all that enraged the other dragon.
Dean relaxed, laughing at Castiel’s attempts to get coffee. “I’m surprised you even got out of bed,” he said. “Speech is pretty impressive if you haven’t had caffeine yet.” To punctuate what he’d said, he pressed Castiel’s mug of coffee into his hands, smiling at the rumble of appreciation he got in return.
“We could go somewhere else, if you’re uncomfortable,” Castiel said to Dean. His own face was hot and likely bright pink.
The room was dark, the blackout curtains really doing their job. They had a wakeup call at seven o’clock the next morning. Castiel had an alarm on his phone, too, since he and Dean were both deep sleepers. They did
“Go to the king,” Dean shouted over the wind, voice rough and breaking. “Don’t fire, Cas. Just get me close.”
He managed to hold onto consciousness long enough to make sure Castiel was suitably wrapped up in his arms. After that, he knew he wasn’t going to last much longer.
Sammy snorted. “’Course he has. And it’s nice to meet you too, Cas. Dean’s told me a lot about you too.”
“Dean!” Castiel called from somewhere behind him. He was holding the round firework again, frowning at it. It was smoking. “I don’t think—”
version of a conversation about this. Or maybe they could put it off until tomorrow. Castiel wasn’t going to let this go, though. He needed answers. He needed to know that Dean was safe.
His angel’s left hand came up to cup the back of his head gently. His right hand kneaded gently at Dean’s shoulders, a feeling that was so good it should be fucking illegal or something. Dean moaned softly, relaxing into his angel’s chest.
He would later learn that Alastair’s cave was five thousand feet in the air, a sheer cliff face dropping off to the west side of Hell, the second-largest volcano in the Ryuu range. Even if Dean
Castiel shifted before his eyes, shaking out his arms and legs when he was in human form. He blinked at Dean’s face, concern flashing across his features. “Dean! Your nose! Good gods, what happened?”
to find an underwater equivalent of. He didn’t care that he might need to search all the deepest trenches, he
He sniffled bitterly and wrapped his arms tighter around himself. He was fucking cold, and he knew he should probably go back out to join the team, but he wasn’t sure he was okay yet. He just needed a few more minutes to himself. He had to get himself under control.
“Of course not,” Castiel said. He looked at Dean with serious blue eyes, the color seeming even brighter because of the soft blue sleep shirt he was wearing. “I was just offering.”
He swallowed thickly, that same terror ripping through him for what had to be the millionth time. He wouldn’t accept the idea that he was unlovable. Not yet. Not until he’d tried his damndest to earn every last scrap of love he could.
Castiel pulled back the covers of Dean’s bed and helped him lay down. He tucked the blankets around him, then turned on the fan in the corner that generated white noise and helped Dean sleep. Castiel turned off the lights, whispered a soft goodnight, and closed the door.
“Winchester!” Coach Singer shouted, startling Castiel out of his thoughts. He looked up from where he’d been looking at the water, frowning. As the senior captain, Castiel knew pretty much everyone on the team. He didn’t remember anyone with that kind of surname. Unless Winchester was a freshman...
Silence, for a long moment. The only sound was the road and the car. Dean could see Castiel’s grip tighten on the wheel.
“The spice cabinet,” Castiel spat. “It was in disarray. Dean would never have left his spices like that, even if his apartment was burning down. The cabinet was broken.” He glared back at his two brothers. “Someone
Dean stared at him, wondering if he’d missed something. “Did you not hear me say I have nowhere else to go? I don’t exactly have a summer house on the coast, Cas.”
The punch came too fast for him to register. It knocked him to the ground and was soon followed by a kick that ripped the breath from his lungs. Dean groaned and curled into a ball on the floor, protecting the softest parts of his torso. He knew this game. He’d been in this position many times before, only it had been with his father standing over him instead of a group of random Alphas. He wasn’t sure which was more terrifying.
“Shh,” Castiel says, gentling a hand up and down his side, eyes on Dean’s deliciously hard cock. It’s so filled with blood that the tip is turning purple, precome leaking down the side. “Keep your eyes closed, beloved. Don’t open them until I tell you to come.”
“She’s very beautiful, Dean,” Castiel murmured quietly, blue eyes wide. Baby had been recently cleaned, most likely by Sam. Her black coat gleamed so darkly it almost looked purple. Her dark eyes were intelligent as they took in the newcomer, her head rising from her feeding trough.
Their only chance of getting to State now was by coming in first in Districts. From there, they’d have to either qualify at Regionals or place first again. It was a tiny, tiny window. Castiel trained butterfly and backstroke almost obsessively. He threw in a little freestyle and breaststroke, just to keep everything in working order, but for the most part, his focus was on what he’d be swimming.
Castiel beams, leaning over to pull Dean down into bed so he can pepper his face with kisses. “I love you too, Dean.”
.” He squeezed Dean’s waist, delighting in the joyful tremble that ran through his friend’s body. “Let’s cheer Benny into the wall.”
Castiel rumbled in response, tucking a wing over Dean. He’d effectively shielded the prince from all view. There was something innately protective about the gesture, which was fine with Dean, for some reason. He was too tired to really care.
with what Cas is doing. The guy just seems to want more hugs, is all. As long as they don’t go on too long, and as long as Sam isn’t around when they happen, Dean is pretty fine with them. Even when his brother
For a moment, Dean could only look at him, unable to wrap his mind around the situation. He wasn’t sure what he could have possibly done to deserve a being as beautiful and kind and pure as Castiel, but he was eternally grateful that this angel was his. His eyes were hot again when he nodded, his throat tight as he responded, “Okay, Cas.”
Instead of leaving, Castiel sat down right beside Dean and began rubbing his back again. Through Dean’s clothes and the two blankets, it was almost impossible to feel his hand. Dean focused on it anyway, tethering his mind to the task of discerning where Castiel’s hand was on its path up and down his back.
“You’re saying a dragon saved you so that you could end the war,” John cut in, voice low and flat, “together. A
He could see the gleam of a silver sword in the air below him, could see the moment the life left Alastair’s body. The dragon sort of just… fell. His shoulders gave out, his body twisting sickeningly to make up for the wind that was surely pulling at his wings. As Castiel watched, Alastair began to fall, his wings limp and lifeless and his tail flailing around like an untethered rope. A little way above the fallen dragon’s plummeting body, a limp, rag doll-like form fell with him.
Because really, that was the real question. Who would love him, if not his soulmate? Soulmates were biologically designed to love each other. If his own soulmate didn’t love him, who would?
. He hadn’t even known about his fire. He hadn’t even known he was a good soldier. Hell, Castiel had dropped him out of the sky! Dean had forgiven him. He’d become friends with him. He’d seen Castiel as a living creature, had taken him as he was. It was the most acceptance Castiel had ever received. His entire life, he’d been pushed away for being different, mocked for being awkward. Dean hadn’t done any of that. He’d simply… been.
hungry, but that could wait. His exhaustion felt like a physical weight on his shoulders and eyelids, dragging him down. Still... “’re you gonna come with me?” Dean managed, looking pleadingly at Castiel. His angel kissed him gently to disperse his worry.
He’d seen worse than that. Dean often thought that the dead were lucky; they didn’t have to deal with the consequences. It was the living — the mothers and fathers, siblings and spouses, homeless pets, unkempt gardens, abandoned houses — that were left behind. Dean had seen lives ruined, villages and families destroyed, by the War on Syphon.
“You know, humans have these things on horses that allow them to, like, hold on better,” Dean said after a while. At Castiel’s threatening growl, he smacked the dragon on the back with an open hand. “I’m not gonna put a
The ferry leaving for the mainland was out in thirty minutes, so Dean stopped at a local grocery store, raced inside, and hurriedly bought a bouquet of Castiel’s favorite flowers. He bought some locally harvested honey too, figuring if he was going to try to buy his way into his husband’s good graces, he might as well go all the way. Some of the sleepy civilians in the grocery store stared at him as he raced past, but Dean didn’t give a flying fuck what they thought. He had to get
“Shh, sweetheart,” Castiel soothed, practically shoving Benny out of the way. “You’re alright. I’m here. I’m right here, treasure. You’re safe.” He knelt next to the bed, his face level with Dean’s glazed green eyes. Something like recognition flickered in Dean’s gaze. He made an aborted movement with his left arm, his fingers twitching.
It was nearing midnight when Dean returned. Castiel was tired, but not as tired as Dean had to be. He knew his friend had worked a double-shift today, meaning he’d woken up around four in the morning and worked for thirteen straight hours. He was probably exhausted.
“How were the humans supposed to know that?” Dean demanded. Castiel was getting frustrated now, because that wasn’t what this was
“Bring back samples,” Michael said before Dean could speak again. “I don’t trust his judgement. He’s not good with these kinds of things.”
“I don’t know and I don’t care,” Castiel replied, a little sharp. He was tired from his lack of sleep last night, and tired of this conversation even though it had just begun. “Don’t you have a register to run?”
Dean snorted. “It’s not the first time, Benny. Well, at least not the first time he’s beaten me.” Dean’s words stuck in his throat, hard to admit even after all this time and all that had happened. “He’s… uh, he’s kinda always done that.”
He reached down between Dean’s legs, feeling at his husband’s trembling hand before locating his hole and pushing his finger inside right alongside Dean’s. Dean released a long, loud moan at the sensation.
“Dean,” Castiel said, smiling despite himself. “You need to wake up. Come on, we’re almost to school.”
The hunt had run longer than he’d expected. He’d had to chase the last two members of the nest fourteen miles down the river, where they’d almost drowned him in a trap he’d stupidly walked right into. He’d gotten out, of course, but he’d had to walk back to Baby and that had taken
Dean cut off with a grunt as Castiel stepped forward and pulled him into a hug. The hunter was tense for all of a second before he melted into the embrace, reaching up to fist his hands in the fabric of the soft shirt Castiel was wearing. Dean’s soft, shaky exhale was warm against Castiel’s collarbone.
didn’t mention that he wished that was the case. He would never in a million years tell Castiel that he wished he had angel wings instead of a sword.
“That’s… That’s great,” Gabriel managed. He didn’t sound very sincere, which infuriated Castiel to no end. Hadn’t this been what his cousin had been begging for just yesterday? “Uh, when are you gonna do that? Dean is coming over this afternoon, and—”
“Only if you want to,” Castiel said. The shining in his eyes told Dean everything he needed to know.
Castiel swallowed. The implications of the statement, of what ‘this’ meant, threatened to choke the breath from his lungs. “I don’t know,” he finally said. He hesitated, hoping,
Castiel shook his head, understanding. “There are two tubes in our throats. One is for food, as you observed. The other is for oxygen and fire. The fire chamber is right underneath the lungs. When we want to heat our fire, we release a muscle that allows the oxygen to flow from the lungs to the fire chamber as well.”
safe for the duration of his heat, even if that meant Castiel locking himself out of his own apartment. Not that locks on windows had ever stopped him, but still.
“I’ll be sure to wear a hoodie I don’t mind getting drool on,” Castiel said dryly, following him into the bathroom.
Dean shook his head, scraping at his face again, as if physical pain would make the tears go away. “What kinda fucked-up piece of shit do I gotta be to make my own soulmate hate me, huh?” Dean asked. He looked up at Castiel, eyes dark with hurt and hopelessness. “We’re s’posed to love our soulmates until the day we die. We’re s’posed to want to protect ‘em with our life. But I
Peace negotiations lasted four weeks. In that time, Lawrence was rebuilt bigger and better than before. The dragons who were willing carried particularly brave humans as messengers to call off the legions that were fighting in far-off fronts. Within two months of the death of Alastair, the war was pretty much over.
“I promise we’ll be careful, baby,” Jess said, kissing Sam easily on the cheek. “Dean and I won’t get the mortar ones.” She winked at Dean. “At least, not a lot of them. Everything else is fair game.”
Dean gritted his teeth, both at the unfairness of the situation and the hot tears of embarrassment threatening to fill his eyes. If he started crying, Michael would never let him hear the end of it. Besides, crying was for pussies. At least, according to John Winchester.
Dean swallowed, throat suddenly tighter than before. It was a good kind of tightness, though. Warmth filled his stomach where there had only been cold and sadness. He managed a shaky smile. “Yeah.”
The moment he said it, he knew he’d made a mistake. He hadn’t meant it to be volatile, but he could see the tension in Dean’s shoulders as the words emerged from his mouth. That easy openness to the prince’s face disappeared under a hard mask of anger again.
“Whidbey Tower, this is Hunter zero-five-bravo, requesting landing again,” he said. He tried to keep his voice neutral and calm. It wasn’t anyone’s fault that he was late, really. Shit just
They were incredibly fast and very loud, and the whole thing rattled sometimes when Castiel hit a pothole or drove side to side. There were other cars that Dean could see, cars that contained other humans. He wondered, briefly, what those humans were doing and where they were going. It was a strange feeling.
Whenever Castiel looked at Dean, though… he thought that maybe, just maybe… the answer could be yes.
Dean gave a choked off little laugh, glancing at the wide stretch of sea all around them. “Yeah. Yeah, we did.” He swallowed past the sudden tightness in his throat, standing unsteadily on the boat. “We did it.”
Dean frowned, nodding. They left Cam, Benny, Ash, and Garth behind as they walked over to where their coaches were sitting in the stands, going over the information on their clipboards.
“You are a hero, Dean Winchester,” Castiel said again, quietly. “And I promise to do everything in my power to make sure your brother never has to fight as you have had to.”
, Dean. You’re the difference we need.” Castiel was smiling now, a warm, bright thing that echoed the passion and excitement in his eyes. “You’re the extra few seconds. I told you I could swim your backstroke, and I meant it. I can. But I can’t swim your fly.”
if he hadn’t left that quickly. He was sort of afraid of the possibilities. He felt like the worst hypocrite in the world, offering Dean a supposedly safe space and then nearly jumping on him the second the Omega took off his scent blockers.
Dean stole a glance at his roommate, smiling a little at how messy Castiel’s hair was. His blue eyes were sleepy but content, and instead of flopping down in front of the computer or a textbook, he wandered over to the couch and sat down to turn on some cartoons. Dean smiled at the familiarity of their typical Saturday routine.
What if he’d just unintentionally made things worse for Dean? What if Michael was angry with him now? Worse, what if Michael was mad at Castiel and took it out on Dean?
it would end with Alastair’s death, there was no way he could be the one to do it. First of all, he was a single human. Even an army would probably lose to Alastair. The dragon was not just powerful, but uncannily clever. It was terrifying.
The dragon stayed relatively still as Dean slowly untangled the net. Though prince was careful, the net still cut his fingers to shreds. It was sharp and cruel, a weapon that had been designed by Lawrence itself a few years before Dean was born. He shuddered to think of it, shame sweeping through him with every one of Castiel’s little flinches.
“So you have family. Are there... are there communities?” Castiel asked, trying not to seem too excited. “Cities? Villages?”
“We should go back,” Castiel said after a moment, breaking the spell. Dean felt strangely disappointed when the dragon looked away, back at the miles of forest they’d flown over.
Cam grinned. “The Russian ones you brought to State last year?” At Castiel’s nod, the other boy winked. “Make it two and we have a deal.”
a soulmate out there somewhere. They were far more deserving of his time than Dean was. It forced Dean to take a step back and stop being so Goddamn selfish.
When Castiel had finished two bottles of the honey water Dean made for him, he found he was very sleepy. The apartment had heated up just slightly, despite the air conditioning rattling away. Castiel felt pleasantly full and warm. He frowned at his plate and empty glass, realizing that the last thing he wanted to do was get up and put everything away.
“Truthfully? I have no idea,” Castiel said. He wasn’t sure why he’d just admitted that, but it wasn’t like Dean could do anything. The green-eyed Omega nodded solemnly at his admission. Castiel narrowed his eyes at him. “I think I’ll manage to get away, as long as no one meddles in things they should not.”
They reached the boat, which was roughly smaller than one of the little cars Dean had seen on the highway. It would fit him and Castiel, but not much else. Castiel was peering over the edge at the dashboard when they heard an angry voice from behind them. “Hey! What the hell’re you doing with my boat?”
Castiel laughed, tugging Dean in for a kiss. “Never too tired for you, baby. Come on, now.” He pressed lightly against the tops of Dean’s shoulders, urging him gently to get on with it.
Castiel slept deeply and peacefully for a good six hours. He woke when the sun shone through the window, streaming through the crack in the musty curtains. For a moment, he simply laid in bed and didn’t move.
Dean sat up, uncurling from his little ball on the couch. He stood, keeping the blanket draped around his shoulders like a cape, and shuffled toward the kitchen. Castiel got up and followed him.
“Once,” Castiel replied. “Day after I turned eighteen. It was...” He chuckled. “It was more of an experience I wanted to have than anything else. I haven’t seen him in many months.”
The good thing was that they didn’t live far from the water. Castiel loved to see the Puget Sound, so one of his requirements when they’d gone house-hunting had been close proximity to the water. Dean knew that his husband often went on long walks to go see the ocean when he was feeling stuck with whatever he was writing. Dean didn’t quite understand how the whole writing thing
that Ishim was challenging. Castiel had made a point to never use his fire around Dean. Not only was he afraid he’d hurt the human, he was afraid Dean would react strongly.
He held up an admittedly delicious looking sandwich. Castiel stared at it, then at the Omega holding it. “I’ve broken into your apartment, gotten blood on your carpet, and threatened you at gunpoint, and you’re asking me if I want a
He hadn’t been so emotionally low in a long time. Gabriel took one look at him when he went into The Trickster and immediately called for an emergency chocolate muffin, then sat Castiel down in the back and demanded to know what was wrong.
“I know,” Sam said. The look on his face made Castiel think that he’d reached similar conclusions. “I… I know. We don’t really have any solid information, right? Dean could just be being secretive.” He looked at Castiel almost desperately, as if he were silently pleading for that to be true.
“This is amazing,” Castiel managed once he’d finished one of his three slices of toast. “I’d forgotten how good it was.”
Well, that was until Dean introduced the alternative. “What if we went in lines instead of a circle?” he asked, capping his water bottle and giving Castiel one of those irritating grins. He twirled his fingers in the air, as if Castiel was stupid and didn’t know what a Goddamn circle looked like. “That way we wouldn’t have to wait on each other and I wouldn’t have to do math for the sendoff.”
Castiel’s chest rumbled with his laughter. He finally moved his hand from Dean’s shoulder so he could squeeze the Omega against his chest better. Against the soft tangle of Dean’s hair, the Alpha whispered, “Me too.”
He’d just finished washing the machine and putting it away when Castiel reemerged. His hair was damp and fluffy from being toweled off. He was wearing a hoodie with the college logo on it and a pair of dark sweatpants that Dean was pretty sure were his own. Castiel smelled of his mint and citrus shampoo. He looked so perfect right then, it made Dean’s chest twist agonizingly in his chest.
The angel growls and comes, eyes squeezing shut as his cock pulses, shooting come across Dean’s chest. The hunter moans and closes his eyes, hips thrusting upward once in desperation. Castiel snarls, riding the aftershocks dizzily. “
“Shh, sweetheart,” Castiel soothed. His chest and throat rumbled when he spoke, vibrating against the bridge of Dean’s nose. “Shh, I know. You’re alright, my love. It’s alright.” He stopped stroking Dean’s back for a moment so he could squeeze the hunter tight against him. “Let it out, sweetheart. It’s okay, you can cry, love.”
Alastair was watching them, waiting for them to come to him. Dean could see the telltale glow of fire in his chest, the light of killing and bloodlust in his eyes.
offer Dean his apartment for the duration of his heat. The thought of Dean, vulnerable and sick, surrounded by the filth and danger of the place he lived in, made Castiel feel physically ill. It made the Alpha’s
You want to go into lockdown for a few weeks?” Castiel demanded. “Has it ever occurred to you that they
Castiel softened ever so slightly. “Hello, Dean,” he managed. His voice was low as well, the vibrations traveling through his skull. He winced.
It took Dean a second. To his credit, he did eventually figure it out. When he did, his eyes widened. “Won’t Alastair and his goons see us?”
Dean was descending from two thousand when the comms crackled to life again. “Hunter zero-five-bravo, looks like you’ve got traffic at your nine o’clock. We’re showing a 727 descending to six thousand.”
Castiel had half a second to slide Dean onto his back before their door was being shoved open. The blond female guard, Jo, poked her head in. She looked out of breath and panicked. “Dean, Dragon Castiel-The dragons, they’re outside the wall.”
Castiel smiled. “I study you, and your people. I study the anatomy of underwater creatures, particularly those with vertebrae and sharp teeth.”
“I forgot that I hate sleeping on buses,” Dean muttered, rubbing at the sore spot on his head. “The window rattles my skull.”
“I’m going to release your restraints,” he said slowly when he thought the merman had calmed a little, wondering if he was insane. “If you try to hurt me, I won’t hesitate to press the alarm button and then the buzzer on your collar.” Castiel held up the little device that would allow him to do both in the blink of an eye. “This is just to make you feel less trapped. If you act out, you won’t like the consequences.”
Dean swallowed, feeling more tears try to fight their way up. He forced them back, resisting the urge to roll his eyes. Wasn’t he done crying yet?
Balthazar watched him with raised eyebrows and an expectant expression as he reached across the table, grabbed Castiel’s unfinished lemonade, and took a large gulp.
He was proved correct when he was graced with a flicker of blue eyes. “Really. You’ll have to tell me about it when we reach our destination.”
That was, of course, until Castiel moved. Only Dean’s expertise and years of experience as a skilled horseman allowed him to stay on the dragon’s back. Castiel’s movements were sinuous and fluid and
He drifted off to sleep again in the nest. The next time he woke up, the sun was peeking through the window of the bedroom. Castiel had somehow managed to toss Dean’s bee to the other side of the nest and was now cradling a pillow to his chest, which was admittedly more Omega-sized than a small stuffed animal.
Castiel began to walk as silently as possible, trying not to wake the sleeping prince. Dean looked so small from this angle, smaller still because of the darkness. It made something strange in Castiel’s chest ache.
He sat Dean down on his bed once they got to his room. Dean hummed, eyes half-open, face slack and sleepy. Castiel frowned at the red mark on his cheek, bending down so he could get a closer look. It looked almost as if something had struck Dean in the face. Castiel was fairly sure the mark would turn into a sizable bruise by morning.
“Killed a shark, yeah.” Dean nodded. “Killed a squid, too. Fucker almost ate me.” He flicked his tail up, showing Castiel a large nick in the left caudal fin. “From the beak. Squids have large beaks that snap.” He made a clapping noise to emphasize, startling Castiel a little. The doctor winced, looking at the scarring that ran along the edge of the fin. He hadn’t even noticed that before.
“They’d try,” Meg grumbled. “Could you imagine the story? ‘Prodigal Mer Activist Visits the Beach.’ Then they’d rip you apart about fuel pollution or some other bullshit. It’d be in the papers for weeks.”
“We do,” Castiel replied firmly. He couldn’t see the left side of Dean’s face from where he was standing, but he could bet the bruise on his cheek had colored fully by now. “I don’t know what happened, but you came back upset and exhausted. I’m your friend and I care about your wellbeing. I think I deserve to know at least the basics.”
“Dean, look!” Castiel said. He waved the sparkler around, laughing as the sparks flew all over the place. Dean laughed too, just because the delight on his friend’s face was so amusing. The golden glow of the handheld firework made Castiel’s beautiful blue eyes light up. He looked like an angel.
Thankfully, Clyde didn’t seem to take any offense to Dean’s rudeness. Nothing happened as Dean flopped down on his bed, though he did feel a little like an idiot. Dean hadn’t ever doubted Clyde’s presence, save for in the very beginning, but sometimes he felt stupid just talking to empty rooms.
Could Dean really do this? Could he really run away? Where did he have left to run? They graduated in two years, and they went to the same fucking college. He couldn’t avoid Castiel forever, and he didn’t want to hurt his friend. Even if Castiel didn’t love him, he still cared about Dean, undeserving as Dean was of that.
Castiel walked out to Alastair’s big black truck, face still hot as he opened it and threw the book bag in the back. He had no idea what had just happened. He’d already half-decided that he was going to take that moment and shove it all the way in the very back of his mind, probably deep in the ‘Things Castiel Will Never Think About Ever Again’ box.
“The sky is clear,” Castiel remarked. He glanced out the entrance of the cave, eyeing the sky that was visible through the gaps in the tree line.
Castiel tried not to focus on who had made Dean happy, but rather that he was happy at all. Dean was a cheerful person in general, but Castiel loved when he was truly glowing. His eyes lit up beautifully, his dimples showed, and the tiny smile lines that were beginning to show around his eyes crinkled. Castiel was still absolutely sure that Dean smiling was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen, save for maybe when Dean laughed. Dean’s laugh—the one with his whole body, the one that made Castiel’s heart squeeze with love—was the most gorgeous thing he’d ever heard in his entire life. Dean was pure beauty and light compressed into human form.
“Just call me Dean,” Dean managed, cheeks heating a little at the thought of someone calling him ‘Mr. Winchester.’ That made him sound old. Behind him, he could hear Michael’s unhappy huff.
?” Castiel demanded, stalking forward. He reached with trembling arms to cup his hands over the merman’s bleeding neck, providing a physical barrier of skin and muscle between the bloody wounds and Alastair’s scalpel. He tried to keep his touch light, but he could feel the pulsing and trembling of the gills beneath his palm.
Dean swallowed, his throat bobbing. Castiel watched the path his throat made, the strong arch of it so near his face. He could lean down, suck bite marks into the soft golden skin. The intensity of the thought surprised Castiel, but only slightly.
Dean shook his head. “You shouldn’t be. He… Gods, I can’t believe it.” He blinked at the ceiling, trying to comprehend what had happened yesterday.
“I kinda kept you trapped here, though,” Dean muttered, looking down at his lap. “And I’m bein’ super annoying and clingy and stuff… If you need a break from me or somethin’, I won’t be offended. Promise.” He looked at Castiel sincerely, cheeks pink with warmth from the blanket still wrapped around him.
To his surprise, Castiel shook his head. “You aren’t a porcelain plate, Dean,” he said gently. “You deserve care, not just a quick, easy fix. If you have any injuries that are troubling you, I will not hesitate to heal them, but aside from that... I would prefer if I could take care of you the ‘old-fashioned way’ instead.” Castiel smiled hopefully at Dean.
Dean stood in the parking lot, rifling through a plastic bag to presumably check that he had all of his possessions. Once he was satisfied, he stowed it in his jacket, hitched up the collar against the night chill, stuffed his hands in his pockets, and began to trudge in the direction of his apartment.
Shaking his head at his internal conflict, he followed as Luke beckoned them in the direction of Purgatory. They had to save Castiel’s Omega, and potentially the future of their guild. There were lives on the line. This was no time to be doubting his brothers.
“Yes, coach,” Dean sighed resignedly. He walked reluctantly to the back of the bus, glaring at Benny as he passed his and Cam’s seat. The blond boy gave him an innocent look, which Dean was pretty sure was complete bullshit. Dean would even go so far as to guess Benny had
“With the cameras, guards, and card-opened doors? Nah,” Dean said, shaking his head. “Even if I’d actually made it out, I don’t know where we are.” He paused, thinking. “Actually, where
to fight, but he most definitely would. As he spoke, his eyes flicked every so often to the ground around them. Where the hell was Dean?
By the time Michael and Dean had reached the edge of the crowd and started heading down a hallway, everyone had hesitantly begun talking again. Dean had no doubt that, while they were pretending to converse about other things, he would be the topic of gossip for days. Unfortunately, Michael seemed to know that too.
Castiel’s alarm went off at an ungodly hour of the morning. He slapped at it grumpily, making sure to sit up so he could reach it. If he laid back down, he knew without a doubt he’d fall back asleep. He’d missed too many morning classes to not know what would happen if he didn’t get up immediately after his alarm woke him.
, of course. Just that he shouldn’t feel so warm and sleepy and comfortable. As his brain slowly came back to awareness, he began to remember.
