“You can look at it when we’re there,” he said. “Better we get a move on, now. You never know when your patient decides to die.”
Ellie and Katsuki rounded on Watson to look at the contents, and just as they had predicted, they found what they were looking for in the form of an old fashioned magnifying glass.
And there he lay, Doctor John Watson, unconscious and attached to a myriad of machines. The bedroom was small as it was, but the machines made it even more claustrophobic. Rosie went to sit on a chair next to the bed, taking hold of her father’s hand.
He sounded nonchalant, but no one on this room could be fooled. Even if Ellie and Katsuki hadn’t been able to see the annoyance vibrating in the air, it was blatant on his face.
“Only to rile him up,” Rosie said, and she exchanged an amused glance with Sherlock. As Mycroft turned around to argue about something with John, they secretly toasted and drank to their health.
They all stood there, staring at the spot where the car had vanished. Holmes, however, had stepped up next to Watson.
Holmes appeared with another box. He walked past Watson and darted for the front door. Watson straightened up and looked out the window. He watched as Holmes dumped the box into the boot, shuffling other things around. A girl with long, dark hair came up next to him and they both rummaged around in the car.
“I’m sorry, Katsuki, but if we don’t know what ‘the truth’ is, then how are we supposed to do anything about it?” She leaned back in her own chair, her gaze wandering around the kitchen. “And besides, even if we knew that, what does he mean by the ‘appropriate moment’?”
Ellie and Katsuki turned when they heard another voice call from the back of the flat, “No, I’ve got the last one, hang on.”
Holmes caught Watson’s eyes, and he shuffled back to stand inside the front door, looking down at his feet, his hands folded behind his back.
Rosie smiled at him. “I have to say I rarely meet someone who hadn’t consulted them one way or the other. It’s fine.” Ellie gave Katsuki another shove when Rosie added, “Then I think you know that he and my father raised me after my mother had died?” They nodded, but both felt too uncomfortable to look directly at her.
Rosie turned around to her father and snatched the magnifier away from him. “I need to investigate!” she exclaimed and ran out of the room.
The air was filled with possibility, and hope blossomed in Ellie’s breast; hope that didn’t belong to her but the small figure on the sofa next to her.
“I have to confess, if we don’t get anything more specific, we might not be able to do anything,” Ellie said.
“We can’t take this case, and you bloody well know why!” She thrust the folder back at him and unbuckled her seatbelt. “We have to tell Mortimer, or otherwise there will be –”
Holmes’s face was scrunched up in confusion, but there was something else. Ellie wanted to believe that it was disappointment.
Then they heard the sound of a voice, a voice suspended in the air, a voice that wasn’t wholly Watson’s or anyone else’s, repeated, over and over again “LIAR”
His gaze wandered off into the distance. Ellie could make out the distinct sound of the wind howling through trees.
Ellie and Katsuki had watched from the foot of the bed, but at this Katsuki coughed and pointedly looked around the empty room. They needed to find the object – the memento – which would enable them to jump to the next memory.
Ellie and Katsuki found themselves back at Baker Street. This time, they both had the sudden urge to shield their eyes from the bright colours surrounding them. Ellie squinted her eyes at her surroundings; everything looked just like the last time they had been there. It didn’t struck her as strange that not even Watson’s own home seemed to be as vivid as this one. She guessed that, after all, Baker Street had been home to him for all those years after all.
In the meantime, Watson had finished his tea and put the empty mug on the small table next to his chair. He folded his hands in his lap and considered the back of Holmes’s head.
“I know,” Katsuki chimed in. Ellie swatted his arm before he could say anything else, making an annoyed tutting sound. He winced and rubbed is arm.
Ellie turned to look at him. “I think he did,” she said, slowly. “I think they both knew and never talked about it.”
And just as suddenly, as if they were jammed into a jukebox, they both could hear a heartbeat. Loud, and steady.
Rosie gave a rueful smile, then stepped up to stand next to her. “I never really watched the sun rise before,” she said.
They were standing in a grand dining room, fit for a queen. There were even more fairy lights, and right in the middle was a huge oak table. A chandelier was hanging from the ceiling, reflecting the lights of the candles and lights around it a thousand fold. Ellie had to squint to just look at it.
“Well, then, even though this might be the case, I’d like to hand over Doctor Watson’s will now,” Montgomery piped up. He was still standing at the door, clutching his briefcase and looking between Ellie and Katsuki. “Is there anywhere we can…?” He looked over at Rosie. She pointed out the door to the kitchen and he turned to walk out of the room.
Katsuki laughed out loud. Ellie’s ears turned pink, and she rolled her eyes as she started the car. “I bet you ten pounds you don’t,” he said, letting down the window.
His eyes had gone more and more agitated, and he had sat up straighter with every word. Rosie looked confused, and she grew alarmed when her father clutched her hands with both of his, looking at her imploringly.
Rosie’s brows furrowed, then she stood and went out of the room, leading them back into the kitchen. Mister Montgomery excused himself and left them for the time being, seeing as he was unable to add anything to the matter at hand.
“You heard me right,” John said. He slid down on his knees, right in front of Sherlock, and rested his hands on either side of him. Sherlock stared down at him, lost for words.
“I think this is going to take a while to clean up,” Watson said. His words struck as if he had just shattered an invisible glass wall. Holmes didn’t say anything.
Ellie knew that Katsuki could probably just activate the memento now, but she felt that it was a bit inappropriate to just grope into Watson’s lap. And besides, at this point she guessed that it didn’t matter anymore how much they saw. And she had a feeling they were getting closer to the ‘perfect moment’. With a sidelong glance at Katsuki she could see that he was just as curious a she was.
Ellie lowered her helmet, and gave Rosie a weak smile. “It doesn’t hurt per se,” she started, unsure how to choose her words properly, “but it might be….exhausting. That is why this procedure is only legal to perform on people about to die.”
Ellie didn’t look up at him. “We will regret our lives no matter what we do, at the end of it. That’s just how it is. That’s why Sigmund Corp is so big. Because no one lives their life to the fullest. It’s impossible.”
“Yes it will,” Sherlock said. It took him a tremendous amount of energy, but he raised his hand and placed it on John’s face, making him look at him.
“It is fairly simple,” Ellie said and stepped up next to her. She coughed slightly. “Depending on what the patient wishes for, we travel through the memories and transfer the desire for, say, flying to the moon, in early childhood, and with the combined help of modern technology,” she indicated the equipment in the corner, “and the human brains desire to tell a comprehensive story, the memories are altered to fulfil said wish.”
“No, wait!” He grabbed her by the arm to stop her from storming out of the car. “Please, Ellie, I want to take this case.”
They turned and sat on the sofa, the yellow smiley shining down on them like the sun. Rosie ran around the room, pointing her magnifying glass at everything that might be interesting.
“Yes,” Holmes said, and they fell silent again. Watson kept watching Holmes, and Holmes continued staring out of the window.
She finished her last piece of cake, set down her fork and stood up. “I’m going to the cemetery,” she announced and walked out of the room.
He looked over at Rosie, but she didn’t look up when she answered, “Splendid. But surely you knew that already, Mycroft.”
He held Sherlock’s gaze when he said, “And you can call me an idiot, but I think this is not a one-way thing.”
“I knew I would be standing here again at some point,” Watson said, and the other two jumped. “I just didn’t think it would be so soon.” Watson gave an unamused laugh. “I think I was hoping I would be gone long before you.”
When they re-entered the bedroom, Doctor Swift and Rosie were sitting side by side gazing at the heart monitor. They looked up when Katsuki entered. Rosie sucked in her breath.
She pursed her lips in dismay and regarded him warily. He pointedly didn’t look at her, and stared through the windscreen at the concrete wall in front of them.
“I know I’ll sound like a hypocrite know, but hear me out. Rosie, I want you to know that, whatever you do, I will always love you, and I implore you to live your life to the fullest, take every chance you get, and don’t regret anything. Because, even if your father is still mad at me, I don’t regret becoming his wife, and your mother.” She laughed, but there were tears streaming down her face, too.
“Well, I don’t think anything else will happen here,” she said, walking away from the window and scanned the room. “We should find the next memento.”
“I know,” Katsuki said, puffing out smoke. They hadn’t bothered to let down the windows. It was getting increasingly foggier. “But most of the time, people regret not fulfilling stupid dreams, like becoming an actor or something. But this,” he made a wide gesture with his hand, indicating the whole case they had just been on. “This is big, Ellie. Watson lived his life without the guts to tell his best friend that he loved him. And you know what’s the most pathetic thing about this? He will never know whether Holmes actually felt the same way.”
“So no small talk then,” Mycroft said, then gave his brother a severe glance. “However, I’d like you to put away your phone until all of us have finished.”
Rosie’s head had snapped up at the sudden touch, and she gave Ellie a calculating glance before she gave a weak smile and nodded. Ellie smiled back, giving her hand a reassuring squeeze before she removed it. Who she wanted to reassure, she didn’t quite know.
Everything became dark. Sherlock was lying on the ground, his head resting on John’s lap. They were surrounded by a pool of blood protruding from a wound in Sherlock’s chest.
“Oh pa,” she said, flinging her arms around Holmes. They hugged, and neither heard Watson quietly mutter “Sherlock.” Holmes, who was taller than Rosie, rested his head on her shoulder, his eyes closed. She had buried her face in his chest and muttered something only he could hear.
The cab came to a screeching halt and bith busted out of the cab doors, jamming the key into 221B. The hallway was dead quiet. John started screaming into Mrs. Hudson’s flat. “Rosie! Rosie where are you? Rosie!” He checked all the rooms and Sherlock sprinted up the stairs two at a time.
There was a deafening silence in 221B. A silence so loud it could be heard from across the street. When a home once filled with the constant babbles of an infant and warm smell of tea in the morning falls quiet and smells of dirty laundry the world takes notice. It did not take long for news of Doctor Watson’s daughter’s kidnapping to reach mainstream even though Mycroft exhausted every resource to keep it private.
Sherlock scanned left to right, deep in thought and then his head snapped up. “John we need to get back to Baker street now!” He grabbed John’s arm and started pulling.
Sherlock looked up instantly, “that was not a completely idiotic suggestion, John,” his eyes twinkled.
When John had settled into his armchair again, a half-asleep Rosie in his lap, Sherlock began the song. His fingers had memorized the melody long ago, but John never tired of hearing it for his eyes had stopped watering when he heard it a while ago.
“It’s good to take Rosie out once and a while instead of being locked up in that bloody apartment.” He carried her on his arm as Sherlock hailed a cab.
“It’s bloody four in the morning!” John strutted over to Sherlock and took Rosie, who graciously accepted her father’s embrace. “Rosie is a growing child, Sherlock, you must know she needs to sleep.”
“John, he was reading the blind baker case, or whatever silly name you gave it!” He said it like the answer was obvious.
“So we would both leave the flat,” Sherlock looked visibly shaken, something he never appeared to be.
“How did she take it?” her head tilted but Sherlock refused to answer. Her eyes traveled up and down John, who tried not to show the hatred on his face.
“That is what you have to do! If you don’t,” He took a big smack of his gum, “I'll just have to make you into a nice rug, hm?” Moriarty’s voice replied.
“John, if this is about earlier-” Sherlock actually looked concerned, only to be interrupted by broken words.
Mycroft looked up slowly at his brother, almost ashamed. “I was in New Zealand, I came as fast as possible.”
Sherlock played this song when they both slept, the song he had written, but for all the wrong reasons. He had danced to it, practiced alone when the sky was too dark to cast shadows through the curtains, one hand low and one up high twirling through 221B. Mrs. Hudson walked in once, seen him dancing alone to the song she knew so well and gave him a sad smile. He had poured his heart into it. The melody flowed through his blood now, but instead of warming his heart like it used to, it cast a sheet of ice in his veins when he heard it.
They sat quietly until their dinner arrived. “Here you are, made it myself.” Angelo smiled, utterly oblivious to the tension at the table. Rosie blubbered happily and picked at the noodles with her fingers. Sherlock ate his salad in small bites, both he and John knowing he wasn’t going to finish it anyway. John stared at his meal for a long time, silently asking himself why he ordered it.
He approached slowly and timidly, heart pounding wildly in his chest. Sherlock remained still and defeated, but watched him approach. Just like Sherlock had done, John pulled him into an embrace, but instead of tucking his head like before, he gently pulled Sherlock head down. They stared for what felt like minutes, all the words forever unspoken pouring through their eyes, and so John closed the gap between them.
“Molly, can you remove the sheet up to his knees?” She did as was asked, their previous quarrel obviously still sat in her expression.
“Yeah? Then why were you in London? Why did you come here, because of it sure as hell wasn’t to help us.”
John gave a deflated sigh and made the long journey back up the stairs. He had really wanted a calm morning for once.
Baker Street was silent that night, except for the soft tunes of a long forgotten violin melody. Rosie tucked in bed with John.
“What is the secret, what is it!” He shouted at the smiley face on the wall and turned around slowly to see the skull sitting on the mantel. He stared at it for a moment, contemplating his next move and walked to it defeated.
“He had a stash of temporary tattoos, it drove me insane really, he stuck one on every day in a different spot,” she shook her head, “weird bloke he was, big fan of yours too, Sherlock.”
“Yes,” Sherlock confirmed, “It would be wrong of me to tell you then. I wanted to part on good terms. He paused and picked up a shattered piece of violin, pursing his lip. “I wanted to see you smile one more time.”
“Right, I’ll put Rosie in her room then,” he turned to do so but was stopped by a “wait, she can stay.” John looked at Sherlock confused.
“What, me? Yes, I'm fine,” he cleared his throat and tried to remember what they had been talking about.
“John, he was murdered. The shoelace we found on his workbench was used to unlock the car door, oh don’t look so surprised it was a simple deduction the middle of the string was frayed. The killer locked him in his own car and kept him inside so he would seemingly die of suicide.”
She blew a breath out of her nose, “well, we hooked up a few times after the wedding, seemed like a decent guy. We didn’t get along though, he always had itchy ankles.”
Then John seemed to notice their hands and released his grip immediately. Sherlock stood, still in his clothes from the previous night, and turned to leave.
“You’re sure this is what you want to do?” She asked the figure she knew would be in the dark corner.
John didn’t notice when the paramedics and police burst through the door, but Sherlock didn’t let go when he stood, practically carrying him. He explained what happened to the police and the paramedics tended to Mrs, Hudson, gently placing her on a gurney and carrying her down the stairs.
At around 1 am, when the police were done with their investigating for the night, the drivers of the ambulance they were sitting on guiltily asked Sherlock and John to get off. Knowing John would not fall asleep again if woken, Sherlock carried him up the stairs into the flat and debated what to do with him. Putting him in his room was not an option, as the empty crib was there. Putting him on the couch was also not an option, as his shoulder flared up if he slept there. The only remaining place to put John was Sherlock’s bedroom, and so that’s what he did without a second thought. Sherlock pulled back the white sheets and gently tucked him in. When he turned to leave to sleep on the sofa, John’s grip on his arm did not cease and he tried gently to pry it off, but John had always been stronger so he sat on the edge of the bed, John’s hand in his, and traveled to his mind palace for the night.
John’s heart warmed as he smiled at Sherlock’s dumbfounded expression, but he raised his hand and placed it awkwardly on Rosie’s back.
The rest of the suspects came in, all with similar stories. They all seemed to love Mr. Wong, maybe a little too much.
“Yes, I know.” Mycroft attempted not to fidget with his hands behind his back, “and you know it will be dangerous,” he said a beat later.
"I kissed you? Just...thought you'd enjoy it." John scooted back to his side of the cab. "Guess I was wrong."
"You've always wanted children." Sherlock said. "It's always been part of your dream of what you would have in a few years. I've seen the way you interact with the children at your work...your eyes light up and you're always so happy...and you look at them with such...longing. You've researched adoption services two different times in the years you've lived here...the most recent of which was three months ago. I know you've thought of it. And us being married would mean we could adopt."
The man grinned. "Didn't say that." Sherlock watched, with a quickly beating heart, as the man's hand slipped down the front of his pants, fondling his flaccid cock and rolling his testicles, which shrank in his grip, in his fingers. "These'd fry up pretty sweet and tasty. Keep you alive for it and let you have a taste."
"...Sherl?" John asked, his logic dissipating in a matter of moments at the sight of his stunning lover.
"You're rambling." John's voice vibrated through the fabric in a very distracting way. "What's wrong?"
"You didn't complain when I got you that dodo skull for your birthday," John shrugged, boldly going to sit on the detective's pristine bed and hopefully offering forth his cracker once more.
"No more!" John yelped, scooting further away and glaring. "Not tonight." He shook his head. "I know you want to try that...the uh…the milking. But just...another time, yeah?"
Sherlock flushed slightly, his long fingers playing over the skin of John's bicep distractedly. "...I'd...I had smaller ones before. I suppose I just...worked up to a...bigger one," he muttered very quietly, his pale eyes flicking away from John's dark gaze, still embarrassed talking about his sex toys with John. Maybe one day, Sherlock thought, John would want him to bring them all out of their hiding place in the back of the closet and together they'd- Sherlock had to inhale shakily at the idea- they'd
-nine,' Sherlock and yeah, I'd be up for it if I were...'up' for it. It's just...I was soft and...All that stimulation...with nowhere for it to go...got me a bit wound up is all. It'll go away, though."
John was roused, as had become the usual these last few weeks, by the faint but very telling noises of frustration which sounded from the man who had invited himself (permanently) into his bed after the roof in his room had been fixed, and who had been spooning him with a cocktail of possessiveness, lust, and frustration over the last three weeks.
"Tell me what your plans are." The detective demanded, adjusting himself on the bed and giving himself a few pleasurable rubs. "I trust you," he murmured, out of the blue.
"There." John's hands trickled up Sherlock's sides, tickling, a barely-there caress that made Sherlock shiver.
The response was now louder and considerably more alert, a delectable, wordless moan of surprise and delight. Two hands now held his head lightly, fingertips unconsciously fiddling into his sleep-tousled curls.
John heaved a sigh, leveraging himself from the chair and taking the few steps to kneel in front of Sherlock. "I'm not going to leave you. No matter how much of a wanker you are." He smiled sadly. "You're still healing, love. You need to give your body time to fix what's wrong. And if you keep exerting yourself you'll only make it worse." Sherlock wrinkled his nose, disliking it when John was so calm and rational and hateful.
- can't control yourself." He loosened his grip, his thumb brushing possessively over the soft ridge of Sherlock's cock through the fabric. "Do you think I'm inadequate when you make me come?"
It was hard to hear over the pounding of the rain, the torrential downpour which was currently soaking London, which was loud even in the hallway. Sherlock paused, staring further into the darkened flat, and that's when his ears picked up another sound, underlying the rain. Another wet sound, of water running, cascading down.
Sherlock's mouth dropped open, watching John suck on his fingers, licking away the evidence of Sherlock's painful, protracted arousal. He'd thought he was sated after getting off earlier. His orgasm had been intense, magnificent, and had left Sherlock drowsy and languid, loose-limbed with pleasure. Less than an hour later, though, when he'd rolled over in bed, Sherlock's nose had pressed against John's side of the mattress, bringing with it the intoxicating, incredibly arousing smell of said man.
“But you just…said…our relationship?” John hoped his disappointment-stunted sentences would compute with the angsty detective.
"Satisfactory if you want to indulge your occasional homo-erotic urges by imbibing a lot of alcohol and watching a group of over-paid, physically-fit young men chase a ball around a tatty field like a pack of horny, starving lions pursuing a vulnerable lioness with a fresh kill," Sherlock mumbled sourly.
His discomfort didn't go unnoticed. Sherlock sat up as abruptly as he could, given the residual trembling of his muscles. "John?
Mycroft rolled his eyes, and sighed dramatically, before deigning to respond. They both bounced inelegantly as the car pulled away, swerving rather awkwardly out of the path of a particularly egregious taxi.  "How am I ashamed by you? Let me count the ways," Mycroft uttered irritably.
"Dammit," he muttered to himself, going to the kitchen carefully, scuffing his feet to detect unseen obstacles. Slightly disconcerted in the silence by the sound of his own heartbeat, he quietly refilled the glass and then made his way to Sherlock's room, his hand outstretched to feel the door.
"Oh, God, John...god," Shaun babbled, practically sobbing, his hands slipping on the wall. He stared down with hazy wonder at the substantial puddle of semen on the rumpled canvas floor, and the hefty spattering on the wall. He almost laughed when he heard John kneel behind him, squelching lube over himself. John hadn't put on a condom, and he dizzily wondered why.
Greg let out a sympathetic huff. "I'm surprised you haven't given in if I'm honest. When Sherlock wants something..."
Sherlock obligingly ducked his head, letting John kiss him with obvious enthusiasm. He jolted at a sudden burst of laughter from some other patrons, staggering closer to John, and the shorter man wrapped an arm around his back, humming, pleased.
John huffed a little, fond laugh, and prodded a vicarious kiss using his thumb against the fine lines of Sherlock’s eye wrinkles. “You might not believe this, but I’ve…it’s been…well, after everything…I’ve had no idea what to say to you to keep you close to me. One of us always seems to say too much, too little, or the wrong thing, and then we…one of us leaves.”
Just over an hour later, John made yet another desperate attempt to touch himself, laying on his back, Sherlock moving tortuously slowly inside him and rolling his slim white hips with cruel languidness.
"I'll just...just go and get what you were asking for." She said feebly, edging out of the kitchen and making her escape.
John grinned. "It's just...too much." He glanced between Sherlock's thighs where he was half hard, cock red. "Want me to...do anything?"
"I do. I want you inside me. I...I want you..." He drew a blank and frantically wracked his mind for something else to say, something daring, something Shaun might have said- Then he remembered the Facebook chat from earlier and grasped onto the crude phrase he'd read. "I- I want you to
We want to thank everyone who followed this story, and everyone who took the time to drop us a review and let us know what they thought. We've appreciated each and every one.
"Why...why did you..."Sherlock stuttered, at a loss for words. "I saw...your blog and the...our picture…"
Sherlock eagerly obliged, rolling onto his side and into John's arms, slotting their lips together and feeling John relax against him.
"Don't be daft." Sherlock cut off John's nervous rambling. "Of course I want to spend the next ten years with you."
Sherlock inhaled sharply when the very tip of John's finger breached his body and John took a simultaneous breath as Sherlock's grip on his hand tightened suddenly. He squeezed the large, pale hand reassuringly. "I...I wanted you to be the...the first...in..." he trailed off, writhing as John pushed further inside him.
In the space of less than ten seconds, John was coming with a strangled sob, eyes squinted closed, come splashing out onto Shaun's fist and dripping down between them. His heart was still thundering after his orgasm and John knew he was beet red, embarrassment over what had just happened ruining the high of orgasm. He couldn't believe what he'd let happen in a moment of weakness.
"Sshhh. We don't want to wake Molly." John whispered, giggling, and Sherlock finally settled- but just as quickly tensed in John's arms as he came to a startling conclusion.
John was beyond words. It only took a few twists of Sherlock’s wrist before he was coming, thick stripes painting themselves across Sherlock's skin. The clenching of John's body and the restrained, pained scream of him coming sent Sherlock over the edge as well.
, John, nearly there," he hissed, quietly but forcefully, panicked at the idea of a public orgasm with someone so close to them. "John! I can't do it," he heaved, squirming awkwardly.
"Bedroom," John uttered simply, easing himself off Sherlock and casually wandering in the direction of their bedroom, slowly undoing his belt along the way.
Heart pounding, Sherlock sped up the motions of his hand, face feeling hot as he stifled his heavy breathing. He was afraid if he opened his mouth and breathed properly he'd wake John…and this would all be over. He didn't want it to be over. He didn't want John to get angry with him, or be forced to go back downstairs to his own room and finish himself off alone, in the dark, without John. It was much better here, listening to John breathe, knowing he was just an arms-length away…
"'People?' What people? Do you?" Sherlock asked, frowning, before waving his hand in a sudden act of anxiety. "
"Utterly fantastic sex, actually. John said so." Sherlock explained further, nodding knowledgeably. "And he would know since he’s been with so many people, wouldn’t he? He said he couldn't remember the last time he came so hard. So that means I'm good in bed." He informed Mrs. Hudson gleefully, practically bouncing with self-satisfaction.
Sherlock sniffed sharply in reply and jolted up, tensed and alert, but barely, "It was the mother in the blue hat," he mumbled in a rush, blinking in brief confusion. He turned his head dazedly, still not completely awake, and gazed at John for a long, awkward moment before he spoke again. "Good evening John."
Sherlock very slowly eased himself back from the bed's edge, where he had been soaking up John's unconscious sighs like a perverted sponge, and watched the minuscule hitches of breath expounded by John's lungs and expressed in the rise and fall of his chest.
Sherlock pulled a face, looking depressed and sulky all at once. “You should let go of my hand as well then. Leading me on and toying with my…vulnerabilities.  I didn’t have you down for a cruel-
-" Sherlock grated hoarsely, resting his head against John's knee and dutifully pushing himself in and out, though at a slightly gentler pace. He had enough control this time to blindly try and find John's prostate with each inward glide and he knew he'd finally found it when John shouted, his legs going stiff around him.
“…I love you, you know,” Sherlock mumbled in such a low, vibrating baritone that for a moment, John wasn’t sure he’d heard what he had, especially when Sherlock’s hand moved down to pat his back and move away again.
Sherlock, bored with the inane sitcom playing, glanced at John with a devilish grin and glittering grey-green eyes, managing to convey his unspoken message: '
"Don't tease me any more...Please. I can't...stand it...let me come, or kill me..." The next words were uttered in a strangled whisper. "Do you know what it's like...not to come for eight hours?" There was a slight, bitter pause. "Course not. You can get off...whenever you like."
," John smiled, amused. "But do you like it...I mean, have you ever been...on the bottom, as it were?" he asked sheepishly.
Sherlock blinked, not having expected John to be so...nice to him. He felt very wrong-footed. "Um...I...That's fine. Thank you." He murmured, edging a bit more into the bright little kitchen, not sure what he should do with himself now. John made the decision for him, taking a few quick strides over and giving Sherlock a quick kiss on the lips.
“Well, bring it inside,” the detective ordered, accurately darting his hand into John’s pocket and plucking the keys out, opening their door.
Alcohol had been involved, that was for sure. Quite a lot of it, in fact. But that didn't change the fact that, after seven weeks, this particular scenario had played out in John's head so many times it was practically imprinted on his retinas.
Sherlock listened, expecting to hear John's sleepy snore...but the seconds ticked past and there was no sound from the bed. Slightly panicked, he rose up, only to find that John wasn't there. He wasn't in the room anywhere and Sherlock remembered- he'd gone to make coffee. A feeble excuse at avoiding him, but he'd let John have it none the less. A quick check of his mobile confirmed that had been hours ago...and John hadn't come back.
“Woodlice,” Sherlock shrugged, as if that explained everything. He affected a bored expression and glared at the piercing hot sun, his ice-pale eyes narrowing and watering slightly.
"You have a great arse." John muttered and it sounded so crude coming from him, as if it were something Sherlock would hear passing by a rowdy construction site, that his cock twitched, hardening even further. "I can't wait until you let me bite it."
Choosing not to correct John on Chaucer's real name, letting the jealous epithet stand, Sherlock rummaged in the bag, pulling out handfuls of fabric and tossing them to John. "Those are all for you. I got you more than the one pair. All in silk."
think about me. You were angry this morning because I had a fucking wank and so you outed me to everyone. Do you have
Once he had done up the jeans with considerable difficulty, he wiped his eyes and lip of blood, smearing his reddened knuckles on the fresh denim. His blood-saturated underwear was sticking in the most unpleasant way possible to his legs.
Sherlock made an aroused, hitching noise in the back of his throat whenever John skimmed near his scalp, “I…didn’t mean to…do that...” he replied, seeming to motion with his hand, though John was unable to see what he was gesturing at or about.
"Ok. Fourteenth of May." John agreed. "Kind of far away but I guess that just gives us more time to plan things out."
“You say that every time, you can’t still be surprised. I appreciate animals. When they act aggressively, when they kill, it’s for self-sufficiency. It’s innately coded in their DNA. They don’t understand malice or jealousy or greed. Not in the way people do. And they certainly don’t ask or deserve to be mistreated.”
"For you." Sherlock swallowed hard against the lump of pure need in his throat as he watched John bare himself, his hands coming up to smooth down the expanse of John's chest. John hummed approvingly in his throat and Sherlock pressed his hands flat against John's skin, closing his eyes at the sensation. Warm. Smooth. Springy hair tickling against his palms. Sherlock could almost
"Bad man." John grinned. "Are they salvageable?" He asked, nodding at the undoubtedly painfully-expensive trousers.
John frowned, clearly debating, but he finally decided to let it go, spreading himself out on the bed again and taking his cock in hand. He hoped this would help calm Sherlock down, help him with whatever was bothering him. He watched Sherlock as he started stroking his cock back to hardness. After denying himself so long, it didn't take all that much- even considering this would be his second orgasm- and he shifted his hips restlessly on the bed, wishing he had Sherlock's cock back in his arse but that wasn’t important. He'd make do.
"It's…it's okay. He can email me his predictions if he wants. I'm sure he'd do it anyway, with or without our consent,” she laughed softly.
"Don't what? Ask you to pull my cracker?" John teased, idly scraping glitter from the cracker in question with a thumbnail.
The detective bared his teeth in a victorious grin as he caught the hesitant flicker of John's eyes, the unspoken acquiescence of the older man exhibiting a totally mouth-watering visage of sweat and lust and need and exhaustion, settled upon his cock like he was moulded around it. The look on John's face, like he might almost be on the verge of crying, nearly pushed Sherlock over the edge, but he resisted admirably, squeezing John's fingers.
John lazily grinned, tugging himself off more quickly now that Sherlock was actually talking. "What else?"
Afterward, John wanked Shaun off, letting him spool onto his hand with a barely discernible grunt and watched, with wide eyes, as Shaun licked his ejaculate from John's palm.
His doctor spread him once more, continuing to lick in and around him, before pushing his tongue as far inside Sherlock as he could.
about John, despite Mrs. Hudson's insistence that she did know the man who'd been living under her roof for a good many months now. He strode from her flat and made his way upstairs, already preparing for "Total Ignorance" mode which had worked on John before.
"John...please...just ignore them? Please?" Sherlock implored, his arousal starting to dissipate, ready to barricade his chest with his slim forearms.
hard even through coarse army-issue fatigues- and John was done. He admirably managed to choke down his moans of ecstasy but it was a close thing.
John pulled away from Sherlock, grimacing, his throat swallowing over and over reflexively. "That was..." Sherlock's eyes fluttered open to stare questioningly at John. "Not pleasant." John finished lamely, trying not to be rude or mean about it but...the acrid taste of Sherlock's come still lingered on his tongue, powerful and...pungent. Definitely not good.
"You have nothing to apologize for." He murmured, glancing coyly at John. "I think I'd prefer to walk, if it's all the same to you."
"What're you doing?" John asked suspiciously, eyes narrowed. Molly's mind was suddenly inundated with the mental image of John stroking Sherlock's -what she imagined- gorgeous cock and she felt herself flushing hotly. "Sherlock, you are, right now, looking incredibly guilty." John muttered warningly. Toby, the visibly over-indulged cat, started licking his ear fondly.
He groaned, his lips silently forming John's name, and tightened his grip on his cock, not stroking it, just holding it in his fist, teasing himself with the potential. The seconds stretched out. Sherlock could feel his heartbeat in his erection, his hips aching to thrust up into the tightness. He caressed one of his nipples and it hardened beneath his fingers as he tweaked it.
He could feel almost every inch of Sherlock’s quivering, tensing body, and the man sighed in pleasure, tipping his head back with a hitching moan, “
John tried to bite away the silly grin that was thrilling his face, but couldn't, and he laughed breathlessly. "For blogging?"
“John?” He mumbled sleepily, batting his hand around in the vague hope of coming into contact with warm skin. Finding nothing, he groaned and propped himself up on his elbows, peering about before clearing his throat and hollering, “
To her credit, it only took her eight seconds to find her (admittedly ragged and strained) voice. "What do you...J...what do you mean, 'John'?"
. I wasn't thinking much about specifics. Only that any activity ending in us both coming would be...might be...
John's words repeated back to Sherlock on a loop, running through his head and Sherlock felt his bottom lip wobbling alarmingly, his eyes starting to smart, and he desperately tried to get control of his emotions before he embarrassed himself. John's instincts, honed over many months of dealing with his love, told him exactly what was happening and he saved Sherlock from embarrassment by hugging him tightly, letting Sherlock hide his face in John's shoulder, and playfully groping Sherlock's backside, making light of the situation.
"Morning, darling." He said cheerfully, smiling at Sherlock's rigid back. He received the faintest, disgruntled rumble in reply, and Sherlock sequestered himself deeply under the bedsheets. The late-summer mornings were currently unseasonably chilly, damp, and grey, and John shivered as his sleep-snared body rapidly became aware of the coolness of the bedroom.
He'd expected John to be there when he woke up. The flicker of anxiety that he wasn't there to greet Sherlock and make sure he was ok was great, and tightened Sherlock's chest.
Molly wasn't proud of it. She even rather hated herself for being so mean-spirited and weak but...there it was.
" Sherlock forced out, losing his balance and helplessly tumbling back against the radiator, his body hitting it with a loud
"Bear with me," John offered in explanation, laying alongside Sherlock so that his face was adjacent to his lover's softened cock, and his own crotch was settled, with the occasional residual quiver, by Sherlock’s striking face. The room stank of sex and sweat and semen, and the musk between the detective's thighs was animalistically tempting. Heady, delirious, John spoke up once more. "Lift your leg for me."
"Come on, John. Need it. You'll give it to me, won't you?" He shuddered, hearing the leather creak in John's hands. "Fuck, you will. Cause you're the best." He jumped in shock as John's tongue laved at the red smudges on his torn skin. When John had presumably cleaned the small wound, he promptly struck him again, in exactly the same spot. The sting was more pronounced now, the tell-tale numb heat of blood loss burned quicker. Shaun juddered in shock and pleasure, his cock jumping excitedly between his legs. He didn't even try to touch himself, just let the pleasure coil tighter and tighter, leaving his balls aching and hard, drawn up.
"Ssshh...I'll take care of you." John whispered before bobbing his head, taking Sherlock's cock into his mouth and giving a strong suck. Sherlock gasped, choking on air, and John took the opportunity to slide another finger in alongside the first, crooking both of them and rubbing directly against Sherlock's prostate. Sherlock hollered, hands grabbing at John's head, skidding off his short hair in an effort to find something to grip onto.
," John moaned, throwing his head back and Sherlock nearly whimpered as John, keeping his tight grip on Sherlock's wrist, began moving Sherlock's finger in and out at a quick pace, his breathing going ragged. "More. Another, Sherlock." John commanded and Sherlock, who had been dazedly watching John yanking on his slim wrist, using Sherlock to smash (quite brutally, it appeared) into his own prostate, slowly came to his senses and obediently extended another finger, smoothly inserting in alongside the other.
Sherlock secretly hoped John would be done soon. He didn't think his legs would support him for much longer and it was with relief that he heard John's breathing catch, stuttering out of his chest in a sigh. The slick sound of his hand rubbing at his cock was loud in the stall and Sherlock listened as John sped up, hands grasping at Sherlock- then the hot splash of his come jetting onto Sherlock's arse.
"Sherl...Sh...Near..." John's words deteriorated into harsh curses, the viciousness of their integrity making itself known via a violent snarl and a few telling, sharp thrusts of John's hips as he neared his orgasm. The headboard of the bed knocked noisily against the wall with the power of John's animalistic thrusts. He jammed his cock between Sherlock's thighs one last time and stilled, gasping in a high breath, before moaning. Warmth seeped against Sherlock's skin and dripped down onto his stomach as John came, his semen splattering against Sherlock's pale skin.
John heard the heart monitor pick up, signalling the exact moment when absolute panic set in. His eyes snapped open. Everything was bright - too bright. He was laying on his right side, facing a generic hospital wall. He heard some kind of alarm go off and vague, worried noises as he started to hyperventilate and shiver convulsively.
He didn’t have to see Sherlock’s face to know he was frowning, he could literally feel the look the detective was giving him, “The walk of what?” He asked.
"There's not room for us both. You decided that last night." Came the sleepy reply but Sherlock shuffled over just the same, making the smallest of spaces for John to climb up on the bed. Once there, John wrapped his arm around Sherlock's middle to not only cuddle the over-large child but also to anchor himself and keep from falling off the bed.
Sherlock swallowed thickly. "…They won't find anything as nice as your ring," he announced groggily.
"Hmm," he pondered aloud, as if wondering if he could extract DNA from this sample and perhaps pinpoint some kind of 'dick-head' gene.
Smirking to himself, the detective slammed the laptop shut, deciding that twenty minutes of self-stimulation would be enough to get himself to peak desperation. He got to his feet, long body covered in the thin sheet. Where would be the best place to wait? On the couch? It would certainly have the surprise element to it, but there was also a chance John would drop the shopping which would vex him. Then again, the added anger would cause John to act a little more irrationally, perhaps even enough to cause him to penetrate the detective. The thought was arousing, and he reached under the sheet to stroke himself lightly.
Still riding on glorious tides of endorphins, John settled into a lazy, but attentive, rhythm of small, curled fingers on the taller man's shaft, staring at it with hazy, and grateful eyes, thankful that Sherlock was, for once, not trying to hide himself.
“But you don’t. You’re only saying that so I’ll have sex with you. Because you haven’t had sex in a year.”
"It was easy for me. I just opened my mouth and said it. More than once," Sherlock shrugged, looking frustrated.
Sighing quietly, Sherlock gave John a reprimanding look, and then proceeded to soap him up and rinse him off effectively. His face was growing slowly more flushed, both from the heat of the shower, and the spine-tingling knowledge that with every second that passed, he was one second closer to being made love to by John.
Shaun sighed, as if John were being unreasonable, and turned to the door with an underwhelming finality. "Take care of yourself, Watson."
Sherlock eased his fingers a safe distance away from John's crotch, frowning anxiously before moving back entirely. "I'll stop now. Sorry. I thought..." His eyes flickered nervously as he eased himself backward and away from John.
John's eyes narrowed. "That, and all that work made you hungry." When Sherlock looked offended but swanned into the kitchen on his own, John laughed and followed after him.
"S'up, Sherlock? You look a bit lost," John said casually, as Percy Sledge's "When a Man Loves a Woman" infiltrated the small flat with smooth, sultry tones. He snorted derisively, remembering the last time he'd used the CD player- Sherlock had been gone to Bart's and John had invited one of his girlfriends to the flat for a romantic evening in. They'd had sex to the entire CD currently playing but, for the life of him, John couldn't remember her name. He decided not to mention this to Sherlock.
John's discomfort, fifteen minutes later and with nearly a pint of beer down him, was only exacerbated when he felt Sherlock's nimble fingers start to make their way from his knee to his crotch. The sight of Sherlock's territorial passive-aggression, fighting wordlessly against Shaun on the other side of the table, had been peculiarly arousing.
Sherlock gaped at him, his damp brow creased slightly in bafflement, and his pale eyes flickering as he physically tried to sort through and decipher that information. He was halted quite abruptly by John’s insistent, flat tone.
Sherlock sighed resignedly as he watched a red-faced John drag the lilo from Molly's bedroom into the spare room.
"Take that as a yes." John said wickedly. He stripped off his jeans the rest of the way, tossing them to the side, and peeled off his shirt, tossing it cheekily to Sherlock. "Well? Going to get undressed yourself? Or are you wanting to be clothed when you fuck me?"
"I think we should come together," John suggested, chuckling dryly. He began kissing the back of Sherlock's neck repeatedly, sliding his hand over one goose-pimpled, pale hip to take the detective in hand, moaning blissfully at the warm liquid that eased from the shaft in response to his touch.
"Doesn't hurt. Just...full. Tight." John gritted out, sweat starting to bead along his hair line. Pleasure zinged through his body despite the discomfort. The discomfort actually added to the pleasure.
) regarding their practice’s rules and regulations in accordance with current government standards, with no doubt at least three miniscule additions to differentiate it from the last quarterly one. It was nearly 1.30pm, and he had waived going home early in favour of using a couple of hours to catch up on his paperwork, timesheets and referrals, which he sorely needed to do.
"Can I have your fingers first." Sherlock murmured, not even bothering to make the sentence a question. John grinned, accepting he'd have to do all the work, and let his "of course" go unspoken. He slicked his fingers up and teased at the entrance to Sherlock's body, wincing at the red, slightly puffy way his entrance looked. He kept his movements to a bare minimum.
Hot, salty liquid flooded into his mouth and John pulled back a little so he wouldn't choke on it. He kept sucking gently, milking out every last drop until Sherlock fell back to the couch with a small squeaking sigh. The doctor pulled back, reflexively swallowing the mass in his mouth before wiping his lips with the back of his hands.
." Sherlock flicked his gaze briefly to John's before taking up a fresh pair of latex gloves and setting them nearby, sliding a sharp new blade onto his scalpel.
“…Problem?” Sherlock asked, lifting his head in question and then trying to peer at the bottle himself.
"Good lord, I'll be doing that for the next few weeks won't I?" He quipped, steering the conversation into well-known water. Sherlock shrugged, sipping his tea.
Taking a deep breath and schooling his face into impassive lines, Sherlock walked into the kitchen, doing his best to ignore John and pretend nothing was wrong. He saw, from the corner of his eye, John look up when he came in and smile, his entire face lighting up. Sherlock felt a curl of pleasure, a happy jolt in the vicinity of his stomach, at being the one who put that look on John's face, just by walking into a room.
A throaty groan was the response, and Sherlock settled himself a little more comfortably upon John, his hands flat on his chest, his knees splayed wide either side of John's waist.
John gave Sherlock a stern look and employed his brook-no-nonsense Captain's voice. "Fuck me, Sherlock. Right now. Fuck me like it's the first and last time.
Oh. Oh, John was staring at him, not through him, really seeing him and Sherlock gasped helplessly as John, still holding eye contact, seamlessly moved his hips. "I want you inside me." Sherlock whispered and John's hips stuttered.
Mrs Hudson seemed to be holding her composure well enough, but her eyes focused on the tea pot as she filled Sherlock's cup.
John moaned. "You can use my body however you want. Later." He grunted, tossing himself over in the bed, turning around and snuffling into his pillow. "Wake me later, yeah?"
"Mmph." John frowned, tossing his head on the pillow, stubbornly refusing to be woken up. That was fine. Sherlock had another plan.
With his free hand, Sherlock fumbled for his own mobile. John's contact was already highlighted and Sherlock pressed the call button. It was a few agonizing seconds later- Sherlock's heart hammering in his chest, his stomach twisting in anticipation- before John's mobile began to vibrate against his cock. It was weaker than Sherlock would have liked, but he used it to his advantage, stroking it gently over his aching prick, hissing at the teasing tingle that was just this side of
," John chuckled, scrunching his fingers together with soft, slick sounds, warming the lubricant, before easing back, propping himself on his elbows between Sherlock's lean, pale legs, and beginning to massage around his testicles.
"How does it feel?" Sherlock demanded, his eyes bright, the languidness and fuzziness of his orgasm ebbing swiftly, and his intense gaze now entirely focussed and uninhibited by the soporific effect of his climax.
He'd woken when Sherlock had opened the door but pretended to sleep, wanting to know what his new, irrepressibly curious boyfriend would do. John had been shocked- shocked to his core- when he'd realized Sherlock was wanking, was kneeling beside his bed and
"What y’doing?" John mumbled sleepily, hips canting upwards, rubbing his cock into Sherlock's mouth which Sherlock was only too happy to allow to continue happening.
He could barely contain his victorious smirk when he heard John pause in the doorway. Sherlock bit his bottom lip, trying to restrain his satisfaction at being able to manipulate his doctor so easily. He let out a soft, barely-audible sniff, cleared his throat loudly, then began playing a deafening rendition of the maudlin Godfather theme.
Sherlock let out a choked, high-pitched grunt and the fingertips of his right hand tapped a frantic message on John's hip, just as his other hand clawed its way urgently into the softer flesh under John's ribcage.
It could have perhaps been familiarity for John. He'd always been considered a heterosexual man, despite his experimentation in his youth. Or perhaps he was simply not willing to take that final leap with him. It was frustrating, to say the least. And Sherlock couldn't help but wonder if he wasn’t enough for the doctor, despite his efforts. Whatever the case, it left the detective simmering and unfulfilled, having John so close and yet not having him completely. He was a selfish creature, and if John was unwilling to tell him the exact reason for his hesitation, then he would continue to tempt him.
"John, are you alright?" Before the doctor could open his mouth to reply, Sherlock claimed his mouth with a warm moan and chilled lips.
Sherlock watched John's throat bob as he swallowed, John's eyes flicking lower on Sherlock's stomach, taking in the way his pyjama bottoms hung from his bony hips. Sherlock fidgeted. He knew he was too skinny. Scrawny. His collarbone jutted out from the top of his chest and his nipples were twin spots of darkness on a milky pale canvas. There were no faint traces of abs, no clearly defined pectorals gained from lifting weights and strenuous exercise. There was just...skin. Taut skin to be sure but...nothing remarkable. Next to John… well, there was no comparison who was better looking.
"Probably because you're the one who told me to start eating pineapple. I...thought you knew." John trailed off, watching as Sherlock placed one...two…three spiky fruits into their trolley. John stared in utter disbelief as Sherlock scooped up two large armfuls of pineapple and tossed them into the trolley before giving it a brief glance, obviously calculating how many more he could feasibly fit inside it.
. He's a very nice size now. Sometimes more than I can handle." Sherlock said jovially and Mrs. Watson laughed.
John decided to risk a reply, but soon found himself trying to enunciate through a burning, constricted throat, a tight chest and a traitorously weak voice. "You know what? Yeah, I do."
As it was, Sherlock, clad in his suit, watched John get dressed, feeling himself becoming more and more aroused by the sight of John’s lean muscles stretching and bunching beneath his skin. The way the light reflected off his skin, his hairs caught the light. His narrow hips, cock and testicles hanging heavy and low between his legs.
Sherlock opened his cupid's-bow mouth to reply, when he was interrupted by a faint but distinct sob from the other side of the bedroom wall, from the neighbours, and a slight creak.
with his cock still impossibly hard and throbbing insistently between his legs. And John wasn't helping, sitting beside him, enticingly naked, calloused hands stroking his thighs but avoiding the one place Sherlock really wanted-
Sherlock’s ordinarily-strong right hand soon abandoned his shaft and gripped the wall again, as he was getting more than enough stimulation from John’s wicked tongue, and he really needed to hold himself up before he collapsed.
John decided not to bother trying to avoid the taller man's physical imposition any more, and just nudged him, attempting to make him aware of where all his lanky limbs were. "It'd be funny seeing you do the Walk of Shame," he pondered aloud, before finding his words mangled by a gusty yawn.
Sherlock acceded even further, widening his legs and removing his fingers from his pink, damp opening, feeling highly bashful at such exposure, but convinced that such a visceral image would totally shut down any last excuses John might be thinking of making.
Sherlock huffed, pulling off John's cock with a slurp, and flung himself down onto the bed beside him.
"...This belongs to me," John went on in a soothing mumble, stroking the warm skin above Sherlock's heart demonstratively, eyes going a little distant as he looked down at his detective. "...God, you're stunning."
"True." Sherlock blushed when John's fingers curled around his cock and began stroking it gently, teasingly. He inhaled deeply, eyes fluttering under John's ministrations. "Can't you just...touch yourself a little bit?" Sherlock asked as he eyed-up the bare body before him, taunting him with its seemingly-unflappable composure. "So I can …so I can watch?"
"I...I'm not..." Sherlock's voice, scratchy from sleep, was bewildered, as if he wasn't sure how he'd come to be where he was, pressed against John with a twitching, leaking erection jammed against his hip. "I didn't mean to..." Abruptly, without warning, Sherlock jerked away from John, diving for the covers and yanking them to his chin.
"I know for a fact you're not patient enough to drag out foreplay." John groaned, twitching at the sensations that long, pale fingertips were inducing. Sherlock's head snapped up, offended, and he gave John a glare.
Sherlock, feeling the gravity of the situation, stroked faster at his cock, urging himself to come-….
By the time John was dressed and ready to go to the crime scene, Sherlock had his plan - and his defences - ready. He was going to win.
Stepping out of the flat onto a bright, sun-baked pavement, John glanced back at a faint noise of discomfort as Sherlock pulled the door closed behind him, frowning down at his hand. As the detective straightened and turned to face him, his expression was schooled into exactly the sort of blank calm that never failed to tell John that Sherlock was hurt.
Sherlock took a deep breath, hesitating. He knew what he really wanted, if he couldn't have John, but...he didn't think he could say it.
John turned, dread tightening his chest, afraid one of the many criminals Sherlock had made enemies with other the years had maybe escaped.... but nothing could have prepared him for the face he saw.
"Mm...why don't you...take over," John grinned clownishly, bright-eyed and red-faced as he rolled them once more, spreading his own legs, hauling the taller man down upon him roughly, and chuckling at the dizzy expression it garnered from Sherlock.
"Didn't think I knew?" John asked teasingly, tongue between his teeth as he stared at Sherlock. "I'm not as much of an idiot as you think I am, Sherlock. But...I still want you to eat some pineapple." He grimaced again, swallowing the bitter taste, trying to clear it off his palate. "Just in case."
"Nothing wrong with enjoying the best bits of a body. Nothing wrong with that." He slid his hand out of Sherlock's pants and he couldn't help but sag a little.
He was gasping for breath, flushed and overheated. His wrists hurt and chafed where he'd yanked against the ties so much. His cock was aching he was so hard. The morning had settled comfortably in the sky, hot and bright. The damp heat was certainly not the cause of John's slick-skinned body, red face, and asthmatic breaths.
"Thrust a bit...slowly...then add another." he gasped. Sherlock, as it turned out, was surprisingly skilled at taking instructions. Before too long, he had three fingers inside John, thrusting them with increasing frequency. John was groaning, eyes tightly closed, fisting his cock almost desperately, the wet, fleshy sound of his strokes loud in the quiet of their room.
Sherlock was studiously ignoring Mrs.Hudson as she chided him somewhere in the distance with her predictable, motherly mix of weary irritation and secret adoration.
Sherlock's usually skilled hands blundered against John's body, not knowing what to do with them or where to place them. He tentatively received the kiss for a few seconds, before pulling back.
"God, yes, yes!" John exclaimed victoriously, gasping with thrilled laughter as he worked Sherlock over the edge skilfully. The doctor eased out shocked, delighted groans as he felt the tell-tale throb and clench of Sherlock’s overworked muscles, and smelt and tasted his bitter ejaculate in the air.
"Yes." John said, latching on to the idea and lowering his mouth to Sherlock's straining erection again, licking it. "I want you to come in my mouth, Sherlock...Come...come
Sherlock didn't wait for the rest of John's words, impatiently sealing their lips together again, not to be deterred from his goal. John tried again.
John felt another stab of sadness as he realized how much he'd hurt the person he loved most with his careless comments. "I only said that earlier to make you jealous, Sherl. I didn't mean it... I don't want anyone else but you. You know that, don't you?"
"You're mine," John stated simply, with a quick, beautiful smile. He pulled the tall detective down so he could murmur into his ear. "And everyone knows it." He ended with a swift smooch upon Sherlock's ear, causing the brunette to unconsciously nudge his knuckles against his ear to ease the tickle, like a grooming cat.
John let his eyes turn to Greg, who rather than seeming shocked, looked like he was about to piss himself laughing. John clamped down, squeezing his teeth together before turning back to look at his boyfriend.
Their warm lips met, and then temporarily parted with a moist click, as John grinned helplessly and Sherlock gasped in surprise. The detective suddenly aspirated and then spluttered wetly on it with a deep, wheezy cough and watering eyes.
In the damp, chilly, and silent atmosphere of the inadequately heated staff-room, the crunch of cartilage was practically deafening.
It took him a good ten minutes to stand up, sniff up the excess sentiment that was irritating his sinuses, and groggily begin to get dressed. Mrs. Hudson had always been a motherly figure to him - that is, she was fond of him, with the requisite amount of common sense, and unafraid to speak her mind.
In the sudden silence, Sherlock's ears were ringing from the sounds of gunfire and he blinked rapidly, trying to disperse the resonance in his head.
"That's...but...I don't...I want you inside me." Sherlock managed to grate out, sighing thankfully when John immediately removed his fingers and slicked up his cock. "Love you when you're being bossy and demanding. I love you when you try to be bossy and demanding…but we both know you're just wanting me to bend you over and fuck you." John said wickedly, easing his cock against Sherlock's wet, loosened hole, hissing as he breached his body and the first, blissful slide inside made him shudder.
Watson sighed. “I just don’t understand. You could have at least tried. I thought I made it clear that a chance like this doesn’t come up that often.”
Rosie huffed a laugh. “That’s easier said than done. I mean, I know he’ll keep going until this is done, but I also know that he’ll eventually die, so.”
The sudden explosion of colours and brightness didn’t seem to bother them; their kiss had started tentative, but soon turned desperate. They clung to each other as if they feared they might fall into the abyss beneath them if they didn’t. But their spot kept being whole, their world changed and shifted, and they were where they should be.
Katsuki had managed to sit on the edge of his chair with anticipation, nearly falling off of it. Ellie grabbed his lab coat under the desk and held unto it.
Ellie and Katsuki were standing in a flat they hadn’t seen before. They were standing next to the front door, which was wide open. Watson was crouching beside Katsuki. He had just put down a box. The keychain was sitting upon it.
It was a sweet, sad sound that seeped right down into their bones, leaving them aching for something, anything; they couldn’t put a finger on.
“And here comes the soldier,” Katsuki said and whistled. Ellie had walked over to the other chair and allowed herself to slump into it. This might take longer than she thought it would.
“I don’t think you understand!” she screamed, then stormed past him into her room and smashed the door behind her.
“I found this in your room,” he said, pulling something out of his coat pocket and stepped up the gravestone. When he stepped back there was a deerstalker sitting on top of it. They had found their memento.
Ellie heard Watson mumble “It’s Sherlock,” but she was more intrigued to see Holmes look startled. “Of course I am,” he said indignantly.
Rosie held it out of his reach. Her frown deepened. “I found it lying on the front door when I came back.” she said, taking a few steps backwards when Watson made to take the CD again. “And it is addressed to me.”
The chair they had just touched was lying at their feet, somehow the only piece of furniture that was unscathed. The floor felt like an ocean of gravel and pages of books scattered everywhere. The centre of the room was blackened, the sofa on the other side of the room was heavily singed. Torn books, pieces of furniture and other things were scattered all around the room. Everything felt bigger, vaster, and lonelier.
“I think, given his profession, it’s very likely,” she said. “I think it’s surprising he made it that far.”
Watson let his hand fall to his side. “To you? But how...” He didn’t finish the sentence. Rosie looked at him suspiciously.
“Time flies too quickly,” Watson said. They let go of each other, but he held unto her shoulders and looked her straight in the eye. “Are you sure you have everything?”
“Initiating desire,” Katsuki said in a low voice, his fingers flying over the keyboard. “Loading memory.”
Sherlock didn’t say anything but kept staring, so John pressed on. “I think I was talking about me that night. Not about you. And that is awful, Sherlock, I know. I am an awful person. I preach but don’t act myself, I’m such a hypocrite. Always been one. But trust me when I say that I’ve always loved you, one way or another.”
Rosie shook her head, still laughing. “Emotions are messy, and Sherlock never really quite knew how to pick up on them. Because you can’t explain them away with logic. And my father, well, he was good at talking himself into things that weren’t necessarily true.
Holmes was still scrolling through his phone, ignoring everyone else. Ellie stood beside Katsuki, both waiting for Holmes to put the damn thing down. It was always easier to enable the memories without the object in question being in constant motion.
They were standing in a tiny, glaringly white room. It was a hospital room. A bed was standing in the middle with Doctor Watson propped up on huge cushions. Numerous tubes were connected to his arms from top to bottom, their ends disappearing into nothingness. He was looking at his daughter, who was sitting, oddly enough, on a fancy chair right next to his bed. She held unto his hand, just the way she did back in his bedroom in his tiny cottage.
And there was this glow; it was like it was emanating from Holmes, as if he was a beacon in the night.
At his words, Katsuki’s eyes suddenly brightened. “Oh, this man,” he said, shaking his head, “that’s exactly what he wanted us to do.”
It made Ellie wonder whether it was wishful thinking on Watson’s side, hoping that Holmes cared more for Watson than for any other person, or whether it was what he actually remembered, but had to fill the gaps with images he knew by heart to make sense of it.
“No Rosie, you really don’t understand,” Watson said quietly, then bent down to retrieve one of the books.
The world shifted again, and Rosie sat in one of the chairs and watched her mother’s last message with tears in her eyes. John and Sherlock were both standing behind her. John had a hand rested on her shoulder.
He looked up at Ellie, and their eyes both met with determination flaring up in them. They had to set their eyes on the goal. There was no going back now.
“You mean that his current memories are wiped out to be replaced by another, imagined life he never had?” Rosie looked up at her with wide eyes. From the corner of her eyes, Ellie could see Katsuki hang his head. It sounded a lot worse put like that. That was the reason why many people didn’t like Sigmund Crop very much.
Watson’s eyes went wide. “I didn’t know,” he said eventually. He folded his hands in his lap and gazed thoughtfully at the floor.
Watson turned around and gave a disbelieving laugh. “What do you want me to do? Give you a medal for giving a boy a bloody nose? You won’t even tell me why you did it.” His face became a bit softer when he said, “It’s not like you to be like this.”
“What are you planning?” Watson said, taking one step towards Holmes. “I know that look. What are you going to do?”
She turned to face him, her face blank. “But you do forget something every time we’re on a case. Show me the file.” She reached out to take the folder, but he snatched it away from her.
“Oh it was nothing,” Sherlock said, making a dismissive gesture with his hand. “It was so obvious. Honestly, I don’t know how they manage anything these days. Rosie really should be thinking about accepting the promotion.”
She extended her hand, and waited. He didn’t react, just continued ignoring her. But she knew him well. She knew he would resign sooner rather than later.
As Holmes handed Watson the small object, Ellie saw that it was a tiny bumblebee toy. Watson examined it, then smiled. “Come on Sherlock, I know you didn’t come over just to give Rosie this,” he said, letting the tiny bee fall into his lap.
Rosie was even younger in this memory. She had to hold the magnifier with both her hands. The deerstalker on her head almost slipped over her eyes.
“Because you are both lonely as heck and I can’t watch my parents grow old and lonely while they could grow old and together.”
Rosie’s hair and clothes were a mess, but she was still wearing the yellow and black hairband, as immaculate as in the memory Ellie and Katsuki had just left.
“I don’t mind,” Rosie said, and even though her voice was thick with sadness, she sounded sincere. “It’s okay. He deserves it.”
With a glance and a nod, Ellie and Katsuki walked over to the hat. “Enabling memento,” Katsuki said.
“Miss… Rosie,” she said slowly, drawing both Rosie’s and Katsuki’s eyes on her. “You’re father wrote that he was confident that we’ll choose the appropriate moment for his wish.” Ellie looked into Rosie’s eyes. Even though she was smiling, they were filled with sadness. Katsuki just raised an eyebrow at her. “Which means you told us this so we would implement his wish as soon as he meets Sherlock Holmes?” Rosie’s cast her eyes down to the table, and nodded.
Watson smiled, but looked away, studying one of the banners at the front of the room. Ellie couldn’t make out the words, but she noted that Watson only looked away to hide the tears swelling up in his eyes.
“I feel bad,” Ellie confessed, looking down at her hands. She was playing with the hem of her lab coat.
Ellie had always wondered how easy it was for the world to go on as usual when someone died. Dying was natural. Everyone had to die one day. It was how the world was made. And still it struck her as something so strange, so otherworldly, that every time she saw it happen, she thought the world had to stop breathing as well.
They stood there together for a moment, watching the rain peacefully trickle onto the houses in the evening light.
Sherlock stewed in his chair for a minute before standing to dress. Halfway through, he heard heavy footsteps down the top floor and he tugged on his suit jacket as he left his bedroom. John was carrying Rosie with two big duffel bags, looking to be in a hurry.
Moriarty looked at her like she had ten heads, “Extreme is my MO, surely you know that by now,” he walked toward her slowly, “we have known each other for quite a long time after all.”
They watched the buttons light up as they went down in silence, feeling each floor passed as the numbers ticked down.
“Sherlock--” John shifted, choking down the regret of agreeing to this date, “Can you maybe, watch Rosie. Mrs. Hudson has had her all day and--”
“Alright, alright!” his breathing sped up and he ran a hand through his hair. He looked at John with regret and fear.
“Ah yes, and we all know what your heart is now don’t we Sherlock. Where you lost it all.” She smiled wickedly.
Thanks for reading! I hope you enjoyed. Comments keep me going and are greatly appreciated. :) Thanks again
Irene smirked as the car stopped in front of Baker Street, which had been their destination all along. “Good luck, John,” she nodded as he got out of the car and ran to the door, paper forgotten.
“Another thing, Sherlock, he seemed to be a big fan of yours, had a printed copy of The Blind Baker from John’s blog on his desk.” Lestrade handed Sherlock a bound copy of their case with the drug cartel in China. Sherlock flipped through some of the pages before tucking it into his coat.
“Mm, what did she have to say to you?” He asked, sipping tea that had somehow ended up next to his chair.
He hummed barely in acknowledgment and slapped his knees. “Well Janine, I think that’s enough from you. John and I have some work to do.” Sherlock stood and started to usher her out of the flat.
John looked closely at the body before noticing the bruising on his neck. “Looks as though he was choked to death really.”
There was a beat where she went silent, her eyes were draining of life but she did not look afraid. “John,” she called out once more. He placed Rosie on the floor and came to her. “He never did love me,” she smiled as the life left her eyes, “he loves you.”
It wasn’t until he noticed the sun starting to go down that he actually looked at his surroundings and realized he had no idea where he was. He patted for his phone in his pocket to call Sherlock, but when he turned it on there was a text from an unknown number on the lock screen.
Sherlock stood and started to pace, “Obviously the killer took it with him, or he just did it with his hands,” he hesitated, “We should go to the morgue and check again, John.." He looked up, eyes focused the way they always did when he focused on a case.
“Mycroft has already sent people to every place in Moriarty’s network, it would be a waste of time to go searching alone.”
Irene looked at him with a sly grin, still not affected by his rage, “After all this time, you still think he loved me?”
Sherlock gave John a confused look, “I did not sleep as a child nearly as much as you claim is required.”
John huffed and trudged over to the door, slinging on his coat he pointed Sherlock an accusatory finger, “watch Rosie, I’ll be back in a few minutes.”
John had done everything he was supposed to. He held the door open for her, pulled out her chair, and was an all-around perfect gentleman for the beginning of the evening.
“You flinched.” Sherlock looked at him with pleading eyes. “You flinched because all I do is punch you for things that aren't your fault.” A wave of anger washed over him like none other.
“Save my life huh? Do you have any idea what you have done to me? To Tom?” Her voice was breaking and tears slipped from her face.
Sherlock looked a little dazed, but he blinked away the confusion and uneasiness and replied: “right, a case, very good.” He placed the remaining papers on the desk and snatched his wool coat from its hook.
“Oh yes, but what was his main threat to you, Sherlock? At the pool with those bombs strapped to his chest?” She gestured to John.
Sherlock plucked a string on his violin, feet kicked up on the side table, “When have I ever gotten milk before John?” he plucked again.
“We-- I have a daughter to worry about the safety of! If Irene Adler thinks there is the danger you can bet there is, and I will not risk the safety of my daughter.” He huffed like an angry dog and stormed up the stairs.
Irene Adler walked along a dark alleyway, her black coat pulled above her ears and a deep red shade of lipstick a shadow on her chin. She approached her destination in a few moments, double checking each pass as she went.
He cleared his throat for the second time that night, “no, no it’s just fine.” he forced himself to take a bite, but it flooded his mind with memories. He took a big gulp of water and forced it down, ignoring the way it sat like a brick in his stomach.
“I will have someone with her at all times.” Sherlock simply nodded and Mycroft turned to leave. “The 29th of January,” he said his back turned. “That early on?”
Irene’s locked eyes with Sherlock. She said everything she needed to say at that moment with her eyes, and she leaped forward, toppling Janine to the ground as she grabbed Rosie from her arms as the gun shot rang through the chamber.
At this, John traveled up the stairs to see Sherlock sitting in his chair, client seat set up in the middle ready to go.
Sherlock stood still in the doorway but removed his coat, “Alright then John, send my love to your date.”
Sherlock was snapped out of his thoughts to the violent thrashing of John in his sleep. Sherlock knew of his PTSD, that traumatic events would trigger his nightmares. Since his daughter being kidnapped qualified for such an event, he had deduced these nightmares were coming and prepared himself accordingly.
“I think i’ll be leaving then,” Mycroft said while walking over to John. “Thank you, John,” he smiled and nodded. John knew what he meant. “It was about time.”
“Sherlock!” John called, taking the steps two at a time. He yanked open the door to the flat to find Sherlock standing at the window, playing his wedding song  again  on the violin but much more violently. The strings squeaked and squealed as he pounded them mercilessly with the bow.
Sherlock rested his chin on his hand, “pasta with butter for Ms. Watson, I’ll just have a salad, you John?”
If anyone else had been looking, they would not have seen a change in Sherlock’s expression. But John knew Sherlock too well, and briefly caught a glimpse of his face falling in utter disappointment.
“Mr. Holmes, sir,” a paramedic came over to him. “Ms. Hudson has been taken to the hospital. Her injuries are not severe, but she will need to stay the night for observation.”
“Miss me?” She asked with a lopsided grin. “Sherlock Holmes,” she shook her head, “never thought I’d see you again.”
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“Mrs. Hudson, Mrs. Hudson can you hear me?” Sherlock placed a hand on either side of her face and she stirred.
She stood there for a moment, frozen. “That’s all your going to say?” she put down the metal bowl in her hand. “That’s all you have to say, after everything that happened. You calling me, telling me-- that, and then hanging up!”
John creeped into 221B as quietly as possible, trying not to disturb Mrs. Hudson and a probably napping Rosie when he saw her door ajar. He walked in carefully and threaded over to where Rosie slept, only to see Sherlock standing over her and playing with a loose curl on her forehead. John smiled and turned around to head upstairs.
“It is never too early to learn the complicated art that is a deduction, John,” Rosie bobbed her head as if she agreed with him.
Mycroft Holmes sat at his desk, signing pieces of paper to do with the government when Lady Smallwood walked into his room.
Sherlock put down his violin and looked at her, “doesn’t she know you're her father?” his tone was curious.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “Yes, why would you come to congratulate your brother on his relationship, that’s so unlike you.”
The room was dead silent. Even Rosie knew better than to make a sound. Sherlock kept his eyes fixed on the basement floor, horrified at what he would find if he met John’s eyes.
“Think? Do I think he loved you? Of course I-- I know he loved you. Wrote all those sad songs, not to mention he saved your life.”
“Oh, brother mine,” Sherlock heard the voice and looked up at Mycroft, who was not carrying his usual umbrella. Sherlock’s deduction skills were not exactly on par tonight, but it was not hard for him to see that his brother was in disarray. Maybe to everyone else, he was pristine as usual, but Sherlock saw how his tie was slightly crooked, his cuff links were on the wrong wrists, and the genuine saddened look of pity in his brother’s eyes.
“Morning,” John’s voice came over the kitchen as he picked up his own tea, Rosie on one arm and the cup in the other. He was dressed for the day in his usual jeans and white jumper. Rosie had on a blue dress and her small hand clutched the wool.
“I will see you soon, Mycroft Holmes,” she kissed his cheek and winked before strutting out of the warehouse.
Lestrade had been the first one in the flat, his hair in a mess like he had just woken up with panic on his face. Everyone spoke to Sherlock, he was the only one able to communicate even if he was breaking inside.
“ Are you sure this is a good idea, John?” Sherlock was dressed in his usual suit, hair freshly was done up with gel.
“Molly, bring me a cotton ball with alcohol on it.” Sherlock’s face was determined. She handed it to him right away and he began rubbing at the Black Lotus. It peeled away slowly to reveal the tattoo hidden underneath, still red around the words.
“That was the first time he turned to drugs. When Viktor died, he didn’t know how to cope, so he poked his tiny arm with that needle that his brilliant mind was able to buy.”
“Here is where the game gets fun,” she smiled, and Irene came through the same entrance they had. “Now that all parties are present, we can begin the game.” Irene came closer to her. “Unlike the pointless games your sister made you play, my game only has one step and one task.” She took a gun from her pocket and aimed it at Rosie’s head.
She had begun speaking again, or so they were told, and Mycroft had made a few extra visits when Sherlock had been to busy with parenting and cases.
“I told her the truth, that’s what you wanted isn’t it?” Sherlock turned around and left the morgue.
“Oh, is that true?” They were standing closer. “Why, because I think you loved her? because I think you love your brother? Because I don’t buy into the lie that you’re a sociopath that doesn’t care about anyone else?”
It wasn’t long or intense. It wasn’t a grand swath of desire. It was raw emotion and years of unspoken words. It was the first time they met. It was 57 text messages that John had in fact counted. It was the fall from the roof. It was his grand return.
“Well it is for the purpose of a case, not a romantic pursuit.” he leads her to the client chair and gestured for her to sit.
“Pressure points, that’s why she worked for Magnussen, so she could inform her brother of our pressure points, get information.” Sherlock swallowed. “My pressure point is you.” He looked incredibly guilty.
“Am I really Sherlock? Am I so crazy to want to protect my daughter?” He barely stopped in the hallway.
John laughed wildly, “of course you do. Make Sherlock Holmes fall in love with you so you can get his plans for your dear old boss.”
“I suppose he thought he had finally met his match. You must of thought you were so clever, beating him like you did.” she took another sip. “Now look at you.”
“Come on Sherlock we have a case,” John called over before replying to Mrs. Hudson, “she has a playdate with Molly at noon!”
“John, it was a distraction! She’s the one who told us about the temporary tattoos and the itchy ankles. She left out the case for us to find when she killed him.”
Sherlock didn’t bother looking up and plucked a few more strings again, allowing himself to smile when Rosie reached up for him from the floor. He quickly stood and picked her up in a swoop, the swing he made as they walked to the window making her giggle uncontrollably.
John flinched at the familiar line, “thank you,” he said and went to get dressed without looking back.
“My god, it’s Sherlock and John!” he beamed, clapping Sherlock on the shoulder. It was then he realized the baby on John’s hip. “And who is this?”
“No I suppose not, regardless we have been brought together to finish the job, in case my suicide plan doesn’t work.” He smacked his lips.
“Don’t leave,” Sherlock wasn’t a beggar, so he ignored the pounding in his head and the sobs that raked the girl in John’s arms. “Whatever it is, you'll be safe here with me, Mycroft setup guards god knows where.” He dared to take a step closer, “You will be safe here. I already failed my vow to protect Mary, but I will not fail you, John.” His voice was firm and steady, but his hand shook slightly as he reached out to comfort Rosie, who reached for him instantly.
Sherlock rolled his eyes once again, “there's nothing we can do, John, but balance has been restored to London.” John still looked confused. “Tea?” Sherlock said happily, heading towards the kitchen. John nodded just as the phone rang.
“So she came over, told you I was in,” he did air quotes, “danger, and then she doesn’t tell you how. Well, that’s very helpful.”
They were both out within minutes, Sherlock dressed without a crease in his suit and John barely dressed at all.
“Why-” John kicked the coffee table, “Cant-,” the books on the table, “I-” his chair, “Just-    have- a- normal- life!”
“My psychopath sister was going to bomb your apartment if you didn’t say it. I had to get you to say I love you.” He didn’t move from his spot near the doorway.
“She will do,” he said confidently as he stared at the door for 221B. He walked up the stairs with the groceries in his hands.
“Mrs. Hudson--” he started to yell down the stairs, but he saw her on their living room floor, a gash on her forehead. “John!” Sherlock called once again.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson,” John said when he came to get Rosie and kissed her cheek. “Goodnight boys,” she headed back down the stairs, her footsteps heard from the creaks in the wood. Sherlock’s violin didn’t cease, for on calm nights like this Sherlock would play John and Mary’s wedding song to help her sleep.
“You always did hate that story,” she recited as she stood and walked over to her violin. She ran a hand over it carefully, “poetic, isn’t it?” she smiled and picked it up.
“Yes, I think so.” John put a hand in his pocket, feeling the piece of paper he forgot about. He unfolded it slowly. “Oh, no,” he said
“Don’t bull shit me, Sherlock, I see the needle right here.” Sherlock didn’t answer. “You promised you wouldn’t do this anymore.”
Rosie had been put down for a nap and John and Sherlock now sat in their respective chairs sipping tea.
After calling Lestrade and taking a silent cab ride back to Baker street, the two separated and traveled to their own rooms. John checked Rosie over for injuries, which she had not retained, and put her to bed, a golf ball size lump in his throat as he did so, planning out his words carefully.
“What could my brother possibly want from me?” Sherlock didn’t open the door, venom in his voice still bitter about his sister.
“You should go to a hospital,” he said, already knowing the answer. Sherlock remained a broken puddle on the floor. Instead, John helped Sherlock stand and brought him to his bed, tucking him as best he could into the sheets and went into the hall to make a call. The phone barely had to ring.
He held it in his hands and ran his fingers over the strings, admiring it as if it were the most important thing in the world. Without a word he took the bow and began to play.
They held each other on the floor, John breaking down as he had before. He gripped Sherlock’s jacket like it was the only thing on earth keeping him from giving in to his failure and broken soul. He held on because he couldn’t let the only thing he had left be taken from him. Not again.
John had started putting on his coat before he saw Sherlock hadn’t. “Come on Sherlock, we both need a case. Lestrade is waiting.”
Sherlock picked it up carefully, all eyes in the room trained on the box. He opened it slowly, and pulled out the contents with great gentleness. It was a beautiful, hand crafted Stradivarius violin.
Sherlock circled the body of an Asian man who was sitting at a booth, head face down in a plate of noodles. “John, how did he die?” Sherlock looked up.
“Children do seem to bring out the honesty in people,” He raised an eyebrow. John rolled his eyes, putting Rosie on the floor. She crawled over to Sherlock immediately and pawed at his boot.
“Oh boys, won’t you please just be nice to each other for once!” Mrs. Hudson scolded, handing Mycroft a cup of tea.
Sherlock tried to stand steady, tried to grip onto the wall but when he tried to think, the wail of Rosie’s cry roared in his mind palace.
“Nah,” he gestured at himself happily, “it is privileged to work for me!” a bubble of his gum snapped.
“We should take Rosie and go to Angelo's for dinner tonight,” John said, flipping through the paper.
“But the party is just starting!” She whined and began to pour glasses of champagne. “Take one, I insist,” she handed them each a flute which they knew better than to drink from.
They rode in silence until they arrived, walking into Angelo’s bracing themselves for his onslaught of praise.
He took a step back, “I am afraid your seduction won’t work on me, unlike my brother.” He eyed her carefully.
It wasn’t a large grocery store, but it made do for what they needed. Before Rosie, they simply ordered takeaway for dinner every night, getting the sugar for Sherlock’s tea from Mrs. Hudson.
“No this time he had promised, he made a vow to protect your family and he failed.” She tilted her head, “He cares much more about you than he ever did me. Can you guess what he did next?”
“How was the case Sherlock, enough to keep you busy for a few days?” She carried Rosie into the hallway, who reached for John as soon as she saw him, even though he was just taking off his jacket.
“Gravity of the situation, did he just say gravity of the situation?” Sherlock flung his legs over the armchair and reached for his violin. He began to play a very off-key “London bridges falling down”.
“I have managed to find myself someone who can tolerate me,” Sherlock sat in his chair, “all the people that are ever near Mycroft are paid to be.”
“Boys!” Mrs. Hudson called, letting Lestrade into the flat, “the detective inspector is here!” She patted his arm and offered him tea, only for him to decline.
There was so much to be said, so much that had remained hidden for so long, but John knew they couldn’t do this here. Couldn’t do this now, so he stood up on legs of jelly.
She gestured to both of them. “And now, well, she’s both yer pressure points.” Janine's head snapped to Irene, “And yours is Sherlock Holmes.”
“Hello, Mr. Holmes,” her smile was plastic. “This way.” She lead them down through to the back of the basement where she gestured for them to enter a room.
“Shwoc,” she blubbered, reaching up at him. Sherlock looked taken aback, but picked her up gently and placed her on his lap, followed by her snuggling up to his chest.
John looked at the time on his watch, 7:45, and looked up and down the street he was on. Sure enough, a black car pulled up as soon as his watch hit 7:46.
When John had finished changing and gelled up his hair, he went down the stairs in the living room to see Sherlock flipping through the case with Rosie, who had just woken from her nap, stuck on his side.
“Yeah, look this was fun but I have to go,” he smiled apologetically and barely remembered to thank her as he sprinted out of the restaurant to hail a cab.
“I think she’s warming up to you,” John chuckled and walked over to him, crouching down and smiling at his daughter who turned to face him.
“I am going to establish extra security around 221B and inform your landlady of the situation, goodbye John.” And he left without even a nod to his younger brother.
“Wait, wait, hold on,” John interrupted. “A woman, as in the woman, Irene Adler?” He looked nervous for the answer.
He was so lost in thought that he bumped into someone in the hallway, knocking the bag of sugar and biscuits out of her arms.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“John, wait.” Sherlock finally looked up at him, “she wants us to go looking for her. Janine wants us to find her, it’s another trap.”
“Sher--” he called when he got upstairs, but stopped. Sherlock was asleep in his chair, Rosie tucked under his chin with a fistful of his jacket.
“Mrs. Hudson I don’t need to ‘hold up’ anything.” he dramatically picked up his cup of tea and flopped lazily onto his chair.
He directed her through a few strings, telling her to pluck this one then that one so she played Mary had a little lamb.
“Yes he did, and he was correct, I am a sociopath I do not care for others only myself.” He quickly got into the cab and slammed the door in John’s face.
Sherlock glanced cautiously at the incoherent military veteran bedsides him. John had been through so much; Being shot, PTSD, losing him, marrying an assassin and her death. He had been so strong through it all, seeking the truth and vengeance on his wrongdoer but this was it. This was the act that broke John Watson, and if it broke John, it broke Sherlock. But Sherlock couldn’t break, because John needed him just like when he was shot by Mary and had to come back because  John needed him , and if John needed him then he couldn’t break so he pulled John closer whispering silent promises in his head.
Ok, so here is part two. This one is a lot more case-centric, so I hope you guys like that. I apologize for a few spelling mistakes, as I wanted to get this out there as soon as possible :)
“What else is there to know? We know where they live, what they do,” she shook her head, “what are you getting at?”
A still fuming John was able to say, “lasagna,” and made sure Angelo was out of earshot before starting up again. “You love correcting people, it is your favorite thing to do.”
“I am in debt to Sherlock Holmes,” she said, “I do not like to be in debt, I prefer people to be in debt to me.”
Sherlock lowered the violin to his side and stared out the window, pressing his hand against it, and said, “I haven’t taken anything.”
They sat uncomfortably for a moment, John’s eyes locked on the menu even though he had memorized it long ago. He cleared his throat to break the tension.
“Well, I am used to be a doctor in the army,” he took a sip of his water, “but now I’m a surgeon at Barts part-time. My friend is a detective and I help him sometimes, but mostly I just get in his way,” he chuckled.
“Well does it look like I bloody care?” He flung on his jacket and stomped down the stairs, gun in his pocket.
“What about Janine?” John asked from over the reams of textbooks they were pouring over in order to try and find out what drove Travis Newsome to kill himself.
There was silence for a moment and Sherlock reached for his violin, standing in his normal corner in the window he played a casual melody that bounced off the walls. John smiled into his tea and tried to read his book, the fire warmly burning next to him.
Sherlock kept his mask of indifference on and nodded, “you are correct, I am a sociopath,” and he left the scene without another word, followed by a concerned John who growled at a guilty Lestrade.
“She was choking on a piece of food and choked herself to death with her own hands! Upon further looking I found a piece of apple exactly 45 degrees from where her mouth would have to spit it out. It really was quite obvious, wasn't it?”
“Look me in the eye and tell me you don’t love Rosie!” John stated confidently, “Look me in the eye and say it.”
“I come here on a separate matter, brother mine.” Mycroft said, setting his untouched tea on the table.
“I'm right here, sweetheart,” John said again, but she opened her eyes a little more and smiled a dopey grin, reaching for Sherlock she said it again, “Dada.”
“Really John, let’s not get distracted.” She began reaching into her bag. “Three times Sherlock Holmes failed, with three distinctly similar outcomes.” They locked eyes as she finished, “And now, a fourth.” She tucked the folded piece of paper from her purse into his coat pocket. “What can we deduce about what happens next?”
Sherlock’s head spiked up and something passed over his eyes before he looked back down, almost embarrassed. “I can always count on you to do that, John.”
John stood still for a moment, watching Sherlock take his daughter from his arms. He patted her head and shushed her calmly. “You’re ok, Ms. Watson,” he said quietly into her ear.
When he had finally changed and showered, he traveled down the stairs slowly, gripping the railing like a lifeline. He saw Sherlock standing at the window, hands clasped behind his back in blue silk robe. He remained quiet, even though John was sure he had heard him come down the stairs.
“Boring!” Sherlock let his head fall backward on the other armrest, sheet still spilling over the chair like a bucket with too much water.
“Oh John, just this one time I'm not your babysitter!” she said with a fake serious tone, taking Rosie from his arms and walking down the stairs to her flat.
“Try it,” he said, raising her hand to the strings. She looked up at him with one toothed grin and plucked it carefully. It made a poignant twang and she giggled.
Sherlock rubbed his eyes, wrapping himself in his sheet and trying to make himself look like he didn’t have such a terrible night. He looked in the mirror and saw a sad and broken man.
“What is it Mycroft, off making candy apples with the prince of Siberia?” He dragged his sheet into his chair, which he sank into.
The scene was a classic suicide. The convertible Fiat 500 was parked in the garage with all the windows and top rolled up. They were informed the car had been on and the doors were locked from the inside. They circled the car with intent eyes, searching for any sign that this was something more to the story. All they could find were some miscellaneous items on his workbench; nails, wrench, a shoelace.
John walked alone along the streets of London. He didn’t have a place in mind and hadn’t been tracking where he was, but he knew he had to keep walking so he did. He passed small shops and the park where a family was eating a picnic. He, Sherlock, and Rosie had done the same thing one time after John had practically begged him. It was the night Rosie said her first word, “Shwoc” which roughly translated to Sherlock. Instead of tearing up, he focused on getting back Rosie so they could have more memories like that one.
John exhaled sharply and mumbled into Rosie’s hair “that explains a lot,” and clumsily climbed the stairs up to his and Rosie’s room.
“Maybe we should go,” he finally said a few minutes later, and so they did. Sherlock carried Rosie, who was smiling as she slept in his arms, unaware of the tension between the two.
“The emotional one you always were,” she picked up the bowstring and began to play the wedding melody.
The walk through the hallway to the morgue was silent and awkward, Sherlock’s head clouded with the case and John’s about Molly. He didn’t have much time to worry though, as Sherlock simply burst through the door.
She played with the ripples in her dress, “he was a nice old man, used to work for him a while back.”
“This is all I ate,” he said, “when I thought you had died.” Sherlock took to wipe the butter off Rosie’s face.
Sherlock stumbled out of his room, ruffling his hair in his blue bathrobe. “You know Gavin when I do choose to sleep I don’t enjoy being woken up so early.”
John rubbed his eyes as the night came back to him, and he stood instantly. He walked out of Sherlock’s room and found the man standing in front of a wild display of locations they had solved cases at.
“Sherlock, I don’t care about the case! I can’t go chasing you around London looking for killers anymore! I have a daughter!” Rosie began to cry at his yelling and Sherlock’s pulse started to quicken. John barely seemed to notice.
Sherlock sighed loudly, walking to the door and grabbing his coat. “I will deal with the issue,” he said sarcastically. John followed him down the stairs, yelling to Mrs. Hudson telling her they were going out for a while and to watch Rosie.
She sat for a moment and looked at John. “I said leave, there are more people coming in you're taking up time.”
“She must have been a part of this, I see no other reason why she would have come into London. She worked for Moriarty before, perhaps Janine was able to threaten her somehow into coming back to assist her.”
Sherlock opened the lock with Travis Newsome and his sheet-covered body was displayed for all three of them.
“Well isn't that something, you two finally came around then?” He started walking them to their usual table.
“Send them all to the flat Lestrade, now come, John, I am sure your daughter misses you.” Sherlock grabbed John’s arm and started to walk out. Lestrade gave him an odd look and John just shrugged.
“We can ask her over now and ask her some questions,” Sherlock suggested. He whipped out his phone and sent a quick text before folding his hands under his chin in the position John knew as ready to go to his mind palace. He figured it wouldn’t take long and he wouldn’t be late for his date if he timed it right.
Mycroft gave an irritated grunt, “Sherlock, I don’t think you understand the gravity of this situation.”
“That is quite impossible, Ms. Smallwood.” He scoffed, “There is only one person who has ever been able to conceal their identity from me, and they are dead.”
“I couldn’t ruin what we had. Balance of probability suggested, and still suggests, that you would pack up and leave immediately of I did so, therefore I kept my mouth shut.”
“You are a smart girl aren't you, Ms. Watson,” he glided over to her and picked her up in his arms, bouncing her around as he continued to ramble about past cases. “Quite above average for a Watson.” She laughed again.
Sherlock swayed his head, “lots of people need correcting, most everyone is wrong.” he rolled his eyes.
“Lestrade get over here now!” John fumed into the phone. “Rosie!” He called once more before catching the back of his chair and falling to his knees.
“John, we’re going to find her, I swear it.” He picked up John’s head in both of his hands. “God, I swear it.”
“I know last time, I--,” John swallowed, “I blamed you, but it wasn’t your fault. Mary chose to sacrifice herself for you and I know you would have done the same for her.”
I could tell now by his fixed position and perpetual glare at the ceiling that he was no doubt extremely affronted by my previous rejection and certain to be in a stubborn and unresponsive mood for the rest of the day.
Sherlock looked amused, “I see Mr. Watson, so that’s what you bought from Ann Summers. And I have to say, you cuffed me very professionally. Have you done this before?”
Sometimes, when his mind needed distraction, he would go in to his mind palace and try to trace back where his odd and eventually somewhat sexual relationship with weight had come from.
The fairy tale had terrified and delighted Sherlock. Why was it such a big deal that the family was hungry? Being hungry wasn't that bad! Then when Mycroft turned the page and revealed that the kindly old lady was in fact a witch Sherlock jumped in horror. She was going to trap Hansel in a cage and "fatten him up". Sherlock shuddered as these words were read aloud; so many times the same thing had been threatened to him. Not that he'd be thrown in a cage though of course. Could some of the grown-ups he knew actually be wicked witches? He clung to Mycroft with his spindly arms, his brother's solid, squishy mass was somehow reassuring and comforting. It blanketed his minuscule frame. It made him feel safe.
"John." He sighed, trembling, as my hands ran more and more rigorously over him, he was helpless. I needed to explore him, I couldn't contain myself much longer. My erection was practically ripping my trousers.
"Sherlock, please, how many times have I told you, it is essential that I complete these medical papers!" My agitation was evident in my voice - he'd been restless all morning, no doubt a product of the current drought in the criminal world and was relieving it by pestering me.
"Nice is one thing, but this is obscene. I look like I'm 8 months pregnant! You're not letting me do this to myself again. Come on let's go."
The detective merely responded to this by quickening the movement of his tongue and tightening his throat around the other man.
He really did remind me of a cat; a sleek, spoilt cat - charming and devious, with glossy black fur and penetrating grey eyes. Constantly the epitome of elegance, no matter how he sat, stood or lay he would always look so refined; with a grace that was natural to him.
Filled, as always, with a longing that I have in vain attempted to smother for so long, I felt a fire alight in my loins; a fire of the most lustful kind. I wanted so desperately to send those raven locks in to disarray, to place my hands around that swan like neck and plant kisses all along that alabaster flesh. His skin looked so soft to the touch…
My writing was interrupted as a certain detective began to nuzzle my face and neck with smooth cheeks, reaped of any stubble by his meticulous morning shave.
"Yes, yes I'm quite sure he will too, farewell now!" The door was shut, and a moment of silence was shared. A satisfied grin doing battle with a heavy frown, until at last the smug detective grabbed his coat and rushed out – doubtless in order to solve this latest case.
"What do you have in mind?" With his deft, dexterous hands, he began to slowly stroke my neck. "And I don't want to wait. I want to…" he bit me hard on my jaw, "now."
As a child he was all coltish limbs and boundless energy. His appetite near inexistent. He just never felt hungry; eating was "Boring!" There were always so many more interesting things he could be doing, like seeing what would happen if the neighbour's dog was fed some of the popping candy that he'd stolen from Mycroft or if he put a slug in the microwave (that result was not the prettiest), rather than being dragged to the table and made to sit still and eat.
"No, no he is out at present," I replied, and a jolly good job too, what with him being such a lecherous grump at present, naturally this part was not said aloud, I instead continued "can I offer you a seat?"
I seized him by the collar; yanking him abruptly in to a standing position, without seeing his reaction, I leaned in and smashed my mouth against his.
Sherlock gasped as Mycroft began sucking heavily on his earlobe as deft hands removed his jacket and began working on his shirt buttons.
“JohnIthinkyoulookgoodwiththeweightandifyouwantedtobeinarelationshipIwouldverymuchlikethat.” He told his feet.
Sherlock practically threw himself on to the black leather sofa, before looking petulantly and defiantly up at his brother; gangly limbs crossed. Mycroft was pacing up and down and looking like he was thoroughly enjoying himself.
The doctor was sure that either his stomach was going to rip his trousers, or his cock was. He felt so decadent, so full, so confined and yet so, so very turned on.
He had also become so used to the constant comments on his weight, or lack thereof, that he needed them. He took a certain pride in them. To hear no remarks could mean that he was doing something wrong.
"But John..." he lowered his mouth to my ear and blew in a spoilt yet seductive whisper, "I'm bored."
"I just wish we could somehow scrape some off of Mycroft and add it on to you Sherlock." his mother sighed once, whilst stroking Sherlock's unruly curls.
“No…um that’s not it, it’s that I,” Oh God, cursed Sherlock internally, why did this have to be so damned hard. “I err maybe helped you, well…what I mean is, it’s maybe not entirely your fault that you’ve put on weight.”
But he was happy, so happy as their lips met once more for a wet, passionate kiss, that was soon to be followed by many more. That is, before the deep rumbling erupting from John’s midsection became too loud to ignore.
"Holmes…please." my words came out like gasps. I felt my resolve, dissolving…he was so persuasive when he wanted to be - no, I firmly told myself, mentally shaking myself from my stupor, you must stay vigilant, you can be the master for once.
“We can stop if it gets too much, promise” smiled John, as he gently fed Sherlock his first helping of the rich dessert.
The elder Holmes closed the door, then went and stood at the window, watching from behind the curtain until the retreating taxi was nothing but a dark speck in the distance.
Then John took Sherlock’s bony wrists (so narrow and so brittle seeming, John worried he would break them) and deftly cuffed him to the bedframe.
“Well, yes. It might be as I don’t always understand the whole enjoying food thing myself and opposites attract as they say!”
Squirming, he attempted in vain to free himself, when realising such efforts were futile he lay back and satisfied himself with glaring at the beige walls. He appeared to be rendered quite speechless, instead uttering small mutterings and splutters of astonishment as I de-robed him.
"A good question indeed it was your –" again, the detective's sentence was cut short by a ruthless plucking in his lower regions.
It was a crisp and blustery day in October, I had just been down to see a few acquaintances at the laboratories in order to obtain some vital chemicals, as my stocks had become quite depleted. Eager to return to my dwelling I strode quickly up to my rooms, but was rather taken aback by the sight of Watson entertaining a young maiden.
The doctor reached over and stroked a gentle hand over Sherlock’s back, taking care not to wake him. He felt the ridges of the younger man’s ribs too easily with his plump digits, even through the thick fabric of Sherlock’s shirt.
As I proceeded to lubricate myself the smugness I felt must have been radiating from my face as, if it was even possible, the anger in his face increased.
Sherlock helped the good doctor to his feet, thanked Angelo then hailed a cab. The whole journey back the detective could barely keep his gaze away from John and his wondrous stomach. How Sherlock wanted to touch it, to feel that round orb stuffed to bursting.
"You don't have to tell him everything, you can do that gradually. But you should at least tell him that you find him attractive."
"Oh…well…I apologise then, Mycroft" mumbled Sherlock, looking at his feet rather than at his brother's face.
"Because I like being able to do something nice for you. Angelo's kindness is somewhat squandered on myself."
He looked so vulnerable and so completely afraid. Those two pools of grey were filled with fear. I had never seen his features graced with such pains.
Insufferable man! Damn his pride. Although it was I who had initiated our relationship, it was not long before he knew how to control it. He learned everything at an alarming rate - as was his nature. Soon he knew how to manipulate me and my emotions anyway he wanted - to get anything he wanted from me.
“See how fat stupid old John can get before he notices. Feeding me up for an experiment like a lab rat? Fuck. That is so messed up. What is wrong with you?!” shouted John, absolutely furious.
Before I had felt contentment, but now that flame was firing up again. I wanted him. Previously my troubled mind had needed an outlet and a way to express my feelings, I suppose I couldn't stand to live in a lie anymore. Although there were many things I wanted to do to my dear detective, they where what I would only in my wildest dreams set out to achieve, things that I'd only experienced in my most dark and sinful fantasies. Things that no gentleman should desire to do.
Sherlock's elegant eyebrows furrowed, taking in this new information, why did people have to be so complicated?
“Wait John wait!” Sherlock leapt up, casting all the papers he had been looking at in to a big heap on the floor.
After what seemed an eternity; an eternity that I would have gladly drowned in, I pulled away. His usually bloodless cheeks were flushed with a hint of pink, he was shaking. I felt a twinge of guilt then, I had been a little rough with him. I gazed in to those twin grey stars, expecting disgust or hatred to gaze back; but I saw neither. There was only shocked confusion and…innocence? A completely child like innocence that I'd never seen in the man before, that was when it hit me -
"You really are almost skeletal, there's nothing superfluous on you," said Mycroft whilst applying the lubricant on to his length, "now Sherlock on all fours if you would please."
“No Sherlock, not until you’ve had a bit more. I know you, I’m sure you’ve eaten next to nothing today.”
Sherlock moaned gently as John stroked him, his cock straining against the boxers he was still wearing. He nodded, stifling another moan and unable to look his lover in the eye.
John then snaked his hand down to Sherlock’s tight little waist and stroked thick fingers against Sherlock’s taut midsection.
“Sherlock, tonight was amazing and I’m so proud of you. Thank you. Please, we must do it again sometime.”
Holmes dived in and wrapped a commanding hand around Watson's hardening manhood, Watson's hands reached for Holmes' trousers, leaning his head in –
Chaucer hid a smile behind his hand, eyes sparkling. "Of course, sir. I'll just go and get the correct sizes and allow you to try them on in the dressing room." He motioned to the back of the store, escorting John and Sherlock there, John still grinding his teeth.
John paused for the first time, not...concerned, but certainly intrigued. He felt the need to enquire, though the question comprised of only one word. "Sherlock?" he asked, two fingers pushed rather awkwardly inside himself as he leant shakily over the younger man.
"That felt really good, though, you should try it sometime," John joked, sighing gustily and closing his eyes. He fumbled for the lamp switch again, and after a few slips of his damp fingers, managed to turn it off and coddle them in cool darkness.
Sherlock managed not to sound as if he was choking on a confusing bolus of shock, wonder, and adoration.
"You're mad." John looked down to what he could see in the dark: Shaun was barely prepared, only what he'd done himself while sucking John's cock, and his own cock had no other lube except saliva and the bit of lubrication on the condom. It wasn't wise. He should get the lube and-
The sound of the downstairs door slamming was loud in Sherlock's ears, leaving them ringing, as if after a large explosion. And, similar to a large explosion, it felt as if all the air had been sucked out of the room in the aftermath. He hurried to the window, twitching aside the curtains, and watched John stomp down the street, his hands clenched into fists at his sides, posture rigid in anger- anger directed solely at Sherlock.
"I want it," Sherlock immediately insisted, his body language telling John that he was absolutely itching to cuddle him, to hold him tight. "I want you to penetrate me and mark me and..." Sherlock’s hand waved as if trying to pluck words from thin air, "...drench me, finish me, complete me."
"You always slept with them on the first date, if they let you." Sherlock said, a voice at the back of his mind telling him he needed to shut up
"Until next time, John." he promised, eyes twinkling, pulling on his clothes and standing up with surprising and enviable decorum. He strode out and left John alone in the tent.
"…And if you don't come before then...I'll leave you like this." John threatened, voice low and dark, and Sherlock gasped sharply. He couldn't tell if John was lying or not. He didn't think John would leave him without orgasming, didn't think John would be that cruel...but Sherlock also knew he'd behaved badly today…John was angry. It was entirely possible.
"Sherl," John uttered gratingly between sloppy, wet kisses "I will give it to you." Relishing the heady scent of his detectives' arousal, John lowered himself between Sherlock's legs, easily pulling the long, lithe, damp thighs over his own shoulders. John grinned fiendishly at Sherlock's feral, hopeful growl, before ramming his tongue deeply, and without warning, inside his partner.
"Oh Jesus...oh fuck..." John's hips jumped before he managed to get himself under control, eyes wide.
- the quivering anticipation and heady lust afflicting John, barely kept in check by his wavering, gentlemanly restraint.
"……Just leave me," Sherlock muttered, his eyes shimmering, mermaid-green. His beautiful, bruised face was lined, not by the dirty deep giggle that John adored, but in utter despondency.
"A little." He frowned, trying to parse through what he was feeling. Yes, it'd hurt- a tad- but somehow...the pain had added to what he was feeling and his cock had throbbed in arousal from the sensation.
John grinned at the teasing pinch on his arse and didn't even have to turn around to know who it was. "Hey, you." He laughed as Shaun pressed himself against John.
"Oh." Sherlock blushed and his cock, trapped in the too-small briefs noticeably got harder. John grinned wickedly at him.
John let his fuming lover direct him, one pale, cool hand seizing his, through what seemed like multitudes of beautifully-appointed, gloomy hallways adorned with the kind of stunning antiquities that John would give anything to own, and that the owner no doubt hardly even noticed, except when the cleaner failed to dust to his specifications.
"I- I don't know." Sherlock replied shakily, feeling as if the vibrations from the toy were directly linked to his vocal chords. Already, he could feel his body being forced to start the arduous climb to orgasm, sharper this time, and more acute, but still pleasurable in an entirely overwhelming way. "I...I...oh. I didn't think….Can I? John?"
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John's waist, bringing their bodies flush against each other, sighing when his erection pressed against John's hip. "I think...you're going to...fuck me."
John placed a hand briefly against Sherlock's T-shirt-clad chest, carefully sitting up, feeling shaky and groundless, and pulling off his own top with a crackle of body-heated static. He hurriedly lay back down, hands seeking the detective immediately. The first thing he touched was Sherlock’s tensed and juddering stomach, and the younger man jolted at the sensation, following John’s arms up to knead and rub at his neck and shoulders, manhandling John half on top of his shaking frame. Sherlock was breathing heavily but quietly, his chest expanding with each breath at an increasing rate, practically on the verge of hyperventilating. The next kiss Sherlock gave him was inelegant, and caught his chin first, and he huffed another apology, feeling out John’s face to kiss him properly.
"I didn't..." Sherlock started but John was already climbing out of bed, not pausing to listen to him lie. Sighing, Sherlock swung his legs out of bed, freezing when he realized John was openly staring at him.
John moaned around his fingers, lavish and loud, and Sherlock, gasping, was suddenly coming, his hips jerking beyond his control and spurting onto his thighs. Sherlock tried to moan but his mouth was suddenly stuffed full of John's fingers, still wet from the John’s mouth, and Sherlock gripped them between his teeth as he rode out the rest of his aggressive orgasm, sucking on them for all he was worth, wishing they were John's cock and that he was about to be gifted with a mouthful of come.
Sherlock stumbled from his bed, hot on John's heels as they raced up the stairs- pausing abruptly when they got to the top. A large puddle of water was rapidly spreading from beneath John's bedroom door and, when John flung the door open, even more poured out.
Mrs Hudson's whole demeanour seemed to come to a stop, her entire body turning to stone as she set her gentle eyes on Sherlock. Although he noticed they didn't look so gentle any more.
John moaned, grinding back against each punishing thrust, mouth open as he panted and huffed. He would love that. It sounded amazing. Fantastic. Taking Sherlock. Shagging him. Fucking him. His skin abruptly felt too tight, prickling, and he tried reaching down to stroke himself- and promptly was shoved painfully cheek first into the shelf. He scrambled to recover while Sherlock profusely apologized.
Molly started pumping her vibrator hard, the fingers of her right hand struggling in slick patterns over her clit. She relinquished a gentle touch in favour of a quick, focussed rhythm, her wrist blurring in its movement at her crotch.
"Obviously she wasn't anything special since your relationship with her didn't last very long." He finally managed, trying not to wonder if John had enjoyed sex with the faceless Melanie more than he did with him. "And yes, we both know you've slept with a couple of co-workers." He continued breezily. "Very crude of you to brag about it, John."
are you doing?” he whispered when he’d turned his face aside, pushing at John’s shoulders with a shaky and sharp exhale.
Sherlock's fists clenched, his high cheekbones were stained a painful red, and he looked traumatised, and as exposed as the Elephant Man in public.
"Alright." He said, shifting on his feet, leaning heavily on his cane as his leg gave a twinge. "If that's what you - no. Fuck this. Why? The least you could do if fucking tell me why. After all this time- what? Is it someone else?" John demanded, shoulder wound pulling as he heaved in deep breaths.
John answered loudly from the bathroom as he tightened his dressing-gown ties, grimacing slightly and ruffling his short, ash-brown hair in the mirror, scrubbing his stubble. “You’re offering?”
Sherlock swallowed, averting his eyes, as small, strong, knowledgeable fingers traversed his nipples. The hateful sun still beat hot and bright through the window and Sherlock gritted his teeth as the tired daylight star made his eyes water, his cheeks tingle with heat, and his confidence shrink with every second that it tainted him.
Sherlock's eyes closed at John's words and he scrabbled at John's body, seeking solace amongst the hot, wet skin and beautiful racing pulse in the arteries of his throat and wrists. "John, you know...I love you? Properly?"
"I might be very bad at this." Sherlock warned, after clearing his throat awkwardly. He tried to keep his eyes on John's face, but the bobbing, hot, shaft near his plump lips, giving off an irresistible sex-scented perfume, distracted him. John sighed.
John laughed wetly, shaking his head ruefully before gently pulling out from Sherlock's arse. Sherlock whined at the loss until John dipped his head, taking Sherlock's leaking cock in his mouth and sucking back on it. Sherlock groaned, throwing his head back, hips stuttering up, pushing his dick into John's mouth.
"By an inappropriate hard-on? You're right. Not at all disconcerting," John mumbled with as much sarcasm as he could muster. "...It won't go away on its own, not with you hovering over me, so you'll have to let me up soon."
There was no way he'd be able to sleep if he held John. Sherlock knew it…but he turned over just the same, bundling the covers in front of his crotch to conceal his erection. John, he noticed, was still soft.
John gasped, spine arching, as Shaun sucked at his cock, taking deep, strong pulls at him, hollowing his cheeks in the darkness of the abandoned med tent. He scowled in frustration that his fingers couldn't get a grip in Shaun's short dark hair and yank as painfully hard as the other man deserved. He was still angry with Shaun, furious the other man was shagging other people, and irritated that he couldn't just tell him to fuck off, that he didn't want him anymore.
"...Never seen this one before, Sherl...special occasion?" Sherlock didn't answer, though he blushed tellingly, before yanking a white shirt and a fresh pair of trousers from the wardrobe, then ransacking his sock drawer.
"Mmph." John moaned, sliding his body lazily off Sherlock and sinking onto the bed beside him. "Ask me later. Knackered."
“Why ask what we are doing, when you know what we are doing?” Sherlock said with a low, gravelly tenor to his voice, his nose nudging into John’s again for a moment.
"Just...be gentle." John warned, before Sherlock's hand, appearing disconcertingly large around his cock, slowly eased down, coating him fully with the oil. John moaned, hips flexing up into the caress.
John followed him, taking one of Sherlock's hands and kissing the back of it, in a move that baffled the detective a little, but that he enjoyed nevertheless.
John had a dizzying thought as their size difference made it necessary for him to clamber up a little onto Sherlock's back, wrapping his arms tightly around his lover's chest - that they really must look like fucking animals. The idea didn't dampen his buzzing excitement.
John clasped Sherlock's chin in his fingers, marking him with his own bittersweet scent, and proceeded to use his other hand to shuck down his own waistband, whispering all the while. "It's okay. Look. It's fine. We...do you want to finish together?" At his husky query, his own sticky penis bobbed free, pulsing with every frantic heartbeat.
"Sshh." John shushed him, blowing air over his nipple before dipping and licking at the center of his chest. "It's not about me, sweetheart. Just relax."
John suffered another choking surge of depression as he settled into the warm water, keeping his damaged arm safe and dry on the plastic periphery of the cheap bath. He heard the telly start in the other room and he sighed, leaning his head back and staring blankly up at the ceiling, mind circling around and around his current problem.
The doctor’s thighs were sticky from multiple re-applications of lube, his throat was painfully dry and his breaths shallow, and the anguished frown he wore from being refused an orgasm repeatedly was birthing a headache. His features were wet with perspiration, his skin displayed a dark pink bloom of over-worked and unsatisfied exertion.
"I could count on one hand the people you 'get on with,'" John chuckled softly, smooching at Sherlock's occiput. "Please? I'd rather you were with me."
What else? What else? Sherlock knelt up on the bed as his mind powered away, trying to express into words the things he'd seen when John had been riding his cock.
Sherlock drowsily protested, making a small, irritated groan…but arched back against John for more attention.
John eyed Sherlock challengingly as he said this, but still didn’t actually make a move, in case Sherlock was legitimately repelled by the idea.
"Why would you be gagging for it all the time, you mean?" John teased, just to watch Sherlock flush a darker shade of red.
"Come, sweetheart." John murmured encouragingly, stroking Sherlock's cock faster, his own hips moving faster as he felt the beginnings of his own orgasm uncoiling, unable to stop it. "Come for me."
it really happened at all,” he added jabbingly, humour in his indigo eyes as he stared the indignant detective down.
"God damn it," Sherlock cursed, his ugly grimace almost audible in the cool evening light. He bared his teeth, then gave into a loud snarl, whacking a bony fist against the peeling kitchen wall in utter frustration. "FUCK!"
"If you don't cheer up, there's going to be one in this flat," John muttered darkly, wincing at a particularly deafening bang, as a firework seemed to explode directly above the building.
“I’m not asking you to. It’s just…” Sherlock tailed off, chewing on the inside of his mouth stubbornly.
flat- she would at least indulge herself. She slumped down in the bed, spread her legs, closed her eyes, and envisaged Sherlock stripping.
"I can't." Sherlock mumbled, his brow wrinkled deeply, his expression such an amalgamation of concentration and discomfort that John had never seen.
Sherlock couldn't say it; the words were lodged in his throat, choking him. He gazed up at John who'd stopped by his chair, his face calm and patient, one eyebrow raised slightly as he waited for Sherlock to tell him what it was he wanted.
taking you," Sherlock admitted abruptly, pulling back for a brief, breathless second. "I won't hold back."
"Oh," Sherlock enunciated feebly, literally not knowing what to say as he bit his lip and let out a soft, overwhelmed moan at the sight of John, open and ready in front of him. He laid one hand on John's thigh, feeling a little short of breath. "...Can I?"
Sherlock still refused to look at him, staring at the singed corner of his pillowcase that had managed to catch fire after being too close to an experiment with camphor. "As if I would casually lie about something like that, in a passive-aggressive way of getting you to leave." Sherlock muttered evasively. "What do you care if it's true?"
"Would you swallow?" Sherlock asked abruptly, before he flushed an even deeper shade of embarrassed pink when he realised he'd vocalised that thought, and that his brain-to-mouth filter, dysfunctional at the best of times, was in fact now a heap of humiliation-attracting wreckage.
Shaun took the choice out of John's hands, turning around and crowding up against him, slipping a wet hand down between them and wrapping it around John's prick. John gasped, eyes flaring wide, and Shaun smirked. John had no choice but to grip onto him in what looked like an embrace to stop himself slipping, falling, and breaking his neck in a piss-stained barracks shower. He averted his face, resting his chin on Shaun's shoulder so that the other man wouldn't be able to watch his expression as he came. Which, he knew, was imminent - the Irishman certainly knew what he was doing and was employing a series of dizzyingly-good moves that pushed John closer and closer.
"Aren't you used to that by now?" Lestrade snapped out of his daze and stared from Sherlock to the body and back at his blank notepad. Sherlock allowed himself a small smile at John's praise. Of course, if he could still dazzle and impress John he would always hold sway over him. He would always desire Sherlock so long as he was brilliant.
Sherlock kissed him in return, tucking his face against between John’s neck and shoulder, and gripped him close, drowsily caressing the skin under his fingers after a minute as he slipped into slumber. He tickled the skin of John’s collarbone with a light peck of lips and then was a slumping, pleasant weight against him.
When the exhausted post-coital snogging ended a minute later, Sherlock grinned down at John with exultation, his face crinkled in a huge, honest, delighted grin, his eyes bright and playful even as he was still getting his breath back, his skin still deeply flushed and wet.
"Oh...oh...Christ...Sh-Sherlock..." John gasped for air, his hand a blur at his cock, mind conjuring up filthy, pornographic images of how Sherlock looked at that second, how hard he'd come- "Oh, fuck..."
John used his other hand to hold Sherlock's hips still, caressing his prostate in time with his tongue, knowing the tell-tale tightening of Sherlock's muscles and wanting to bring him to orgasm before he could convince him to fuck him.
"Should we...have sex? To commemorate the occasion?" Sherlock's voice was soft and tentative, unsure, and tugged at something fierce and protective in John's chest.
"Like that?" John grunted, as if he were the one penetrating Sherlock and not the other way around. "Give me another. Come on, Sherlock."
"Yeah sure. Of course." John beamed at Sherlock, easily giving the promise, missing Sherlock's sly grin as he turned back to the bag. "So what'd you get...for yourself?"
John grabbed his hips, skilfully twisting Sherlock onto the bed in a move Sherlock was more familiar seeing used on grubby, knife-wielding criminals, with far less comfortable results.
"Nothing. I was just- nothing." He made to roll away, a heavy lump sitting in the pit of his stomach. He shouldn't have made a move like that, he castigated himself. John was used to sleeping alone and probably wouldn't want him climbing all over him at night-
. Sherlock could smell his own sweat mixed with the bland but detectable scent of lube and the musky tones of semen. He realized, with a blow to his vanity, that he probably looked even worse than he felt. There was, however, no way his muscles would hold him up long enough to get clean, much less make it the few steps to the loo.
John's blog immediately sprang into life and Sherlock rolled his eyes. Trust John to leave their bed and check his sodding blog when there were better things to be doing- such as cooking Sherlock breakfast. Sherlock felt he had earned it after last night and-
While Sherlock thought there could maybe be a certain sexual appeal to being held captive by John Watson, he didn't want to miss this case. Besides, Mycroft needed him. He wouldn't have come to him if he didn't.
"It's just...there's something...I think we might need later. I don't know if you...have any...in your bedroom. I checked earlier but...I know people tend to hide these sorts of things." He continued, stepping closer to Molly so they wouldn't be overheard. They could hear the sounds of the television filtering in from the sitting room and Molly heard John shift on the sofa, sighing. She swallowed heavily, her heart racing, feeling light headed.
Sherlock shrugged somewhat nervously and then gave a small nod, hands shifting through John’s hair again as his breathing and pulse sped up, “I like your hair,” he murmured as John pulled the waistband down, exposing Sherlock’s flushed pelvis and the pale, thickening shaft of his half hard penis. “I’ve
Shaun shuddered when John stroked him, tentative at first, and his head fell back as he moaned breathily. John bit his lip, his own cock throbbing. At this angle, it was almost like he was stroking himself...except he obviously wasn't. John was firmly aware that the rigid, silken skin beneath his hand wasn't his own prick.
Sherlock spared her a brief glance- he supposed that sort of fake femininity appealed to some people- before turning back to John...who looked utterly enthralled. Sherlock was instantly on the defensive- noting John's wide eyes tracing down the woman's body, incredulous, a smile tugging at the corners of his lips.
“Shut up,” Sherlock spat in anticipation of Mycroft’s catty remark. He eyed the messages expressionlessly, though his chest constricted oddly at the sight of them.
come!" John begged desperately, grunting helplessly as the bedframe began rapping against the wall with a rhythmic, metallic clang.
Sherlock was trembling behind him, sobbing out breaths like an errant locomotive, while John trembled in the dark, his body on edge and vibrating with tension.
"Don't laugh at me." Sherlock said with a stern (if watery) glare, shuddering again, long fingers scrabbling in dead leaves and grit, insect casings and damp soil.
"Sherl...please- slower...wetter," John panted and when Sherlock stared at him in innocent confusion, John spat into his own hand and slicked himself up with a sigh that was comprised of relief, but also of slight anxiety at what his detective might do next. "Don't you ever...masturbate?" John asked timidly, not wanting to hurt Sherlock's feelings but Christ alive. Surely he didn't do that sort of thing to himself?
"Thumb now. Kay?" John asked, squeezing the plump, tight flesh of Shaun's backside with his free hand out of a selfish whim. If it pleased the other man, well...that was incidental.
"Wait just...just a bit." John beseeched, grimacing, the burn of the penetration softened by the ethanol buzzing in his system, but still painful.
The detective frowned tiredly, wheezing, his forehead crinkled and his pale eyes tightly shut. He suffered a few, full-body shudders as a couple of unexpected aftershocks from his orgasm tremored through him. Chest heaving, he licked the remaining particles comprising John's taste from his heart-shaped mouth, before endeavouring to make use of his vocal chords. "What?" he uttered breathlessly.
"He's a sweet boy." John said awkwardly, side-stepping the cat- assuaging Sherlock's worries over a future of litter trays and cat hair everywhere- and pouring out coffee. Molly smiled at him, taking her own seat at the table across from Sherlock.
"Just a bloody suggestion." Shaun muttered, taking a swig of his drink, glaring over John's shoulder as Sherlock came back, sliding into his seat and glancing around the table, obviously picking up on the tension.
"Taxi's here," John murmured, after lowering his spare hand, quietly revelling in the fact that for once he had managed to hail a London taxi without the apparent benefit of Sherlock's billowing, hypnotising coat-tails.
"Right, come on," he announced in a no-nonsense fashion, scooping his arms under Sherlock and, bracing them under Sherlock's considerable weight, managed to lift him with a small grunt and take a few steps, depositing the squirming brunette on the rug beside the bed.
He lifted his free hand and snapped his fingers loudly and resolutely. Raising his dangerous gaze to Sherlock's somewhat-startled and flushed face, he wordlessly curled his fingers, beckoning the detective to hand him the troublesome phone.
He felt ill imagining climbing into bed later and Sherlock turning his back to him, pretending to be tired and probably hoping John wouldn't ask for sex again. Not that he would, John resolved, lowering himself into the bath and wishing he had the salts and candles and things he did at Baker Street. If that was still his home. Sherlock would be too nice to tell John it was over and that he needed to move out. No doubt he would drop a few hints, though, once John was fully recovered. He wouldn't want to send a disabled John away to live on his own.
They repeated variations of their clandestine meetings every few days but every time, either beforehand when the very air seemed to be vibrating between them, or afterwards when they were both sweaty and sticky and sated...John couldn't bring himself to ask.
Greg had started hacking out a few giggles behind them and John had to stop himself from kicking the man off his stool. His focus was Sherlock, even if the man still wouldn't look at him.
"Oh, Jesus." John said weakly, cock flexing when Sherlock's hand wrapped around the base. The sight of sordid, saliva-slicked lips around his cock, sucking enthusiastically, and entirely pleasurably, caused John to groan out a few unintended growls of bliss. With a villainous grin, restricted by the suction around John's leaking tip, Sherlock sank his sharp fingernails once more into John's skin and, after a hefty inhale, he lowered his head and deep-throated John as if he had done it a hundred times before.
"Sherlock." John's voice pitched down into dangerous levels, letting Sherlock know his obstinacy was getting him in trouble but continued to pout. "Where'd you learn that?"
"What wrong?" John's voice broke through his shame and embarrassment and Sherlock shuddered, hand stilling on his cock.
It was a matter of seconds before John adjusted his position and nuzzled and sucked at the beautiful red bruises that were already adorning Sherlock's previously flawless throat. He revelled in the memory of instigating them and the shuddery, breathless noises Sherlock had made as he antagonised them with a hungry tongue. He palmed Sherlock's hard prick through his trousers, teasing him with the pressure, loving the way Sherlock's hips rocked against him, seeking more, and the hungry little moan that echoed in the back of his throat.
"Not really, love." John giggled, rubbing his thigh comfortingly. "Here." He offered Sherlock one of his hands which Sherlock gripped tightly.
"...Oh,...oh," Sherlock swallowed back further words, looking flustered, and awkward, and overcome in the low light. John could tell he was holding back, and frankly, he didn't want any of that nonsense.
It took the detective a few visible seconds to process the metaphor, before he nodded and sighed at the tiny waste of his own brainpower in doing so.
“You’ve had this issue for about a week now. Stiff muscles in your neck and shoulder. You should really do something about it, John,” Sherlock told him and shifted closer to get a better grip, kneading down from John’s neck to his shoulder and back again.
"True. Do you...want to do that to me?" He asked, indicating the still-playing video where the sounds of rough, unbridled fucking were taking place.
"Cream, please," the detective uttered authoritatively, flicking one hand weakly over his own shoulders to point at his own naked, bruised scapulae. John's brow furrowed, his teeth bit into his bottom lip, at the sight of the sore, chafed, red line that circled Sherlock's slim wrist.
John almost sobbed with relief, laughing giddily against his bedmate's supple mouth before he arched into the kiss, one of his hands already having surged deep into Sherlock's crisp curls, kneading happily.
"It's fine." Sherlock shuffled on the bed as John applied lube to his thighs, slicking it between them and licking his lips as he did, watching, entranced, as his hand disappeared between Sherlock's thighs.
The first push of a slick finger in his arse made John gasp and arch. It didn't hurt. Surprisingly. Not in the slightest. Shaun's eyes glittered, black and playful, above him as he wiggled his digit in John without finesse but still managing to catch his prostate. Stars exploded in John's vision. In his inebriated state, John decided now was a perfect time to ask the questions he had been putting off for nearly two months. And if it wasn't, well, sod the consequences. His voice slurred as he tried to enunciate through too much whisky, laying in an unusual position in a desert war zone, and the fact of a strong, knowledgeable finger up his arse.
"In near darkness. And you still refuse to address the issue of your slight short-sightedness." Sherlock muttered bitterly, though his voice was tellingly constricted by arousal that couldn't be ignored or tamped down. "If you don't get that checked soon, John, you'll regret it when you're sixty and your eyesight is so bad contacts will be ineffective. Let's...let's get ourselves off. Under the covers?"
The shattered doctor gingerly propped himself up into a sitting position, grimacing as he felt Sherlock's release leak from him and onto the mattress. He sighed, making a mental note that he really needed to invest in more bedsheets.
John raised an eyebrow, finding the whole ordeal more entertaining than it probably should have been. Part of his mind was telling him that this was purely hypothetical and he certainly was
"Sherlock?" He heard John call after him but ignored him, studiously opening the computer and trying to deduce John's new password.
"Alright, but I'm not batting my eyes or doing voices." John grinned before studying Greg for a moment, in a way he never thought he would. "So are you wanting the whole personality thing or the actual physical attractiveness points?"
“It’s just another day to me,” Sherlock said. “A day filled with nothing but tedium and fakery and annoying morons who still cannot tell the time!” He glared off at the window after another few pops of fireworks. “
"Are you enjoying yourself?" Sherlock asked, deciding to start out with an easy question. John took a shuddering inhale and his body tensed the higher Sherlock's mouth went, begging with his eyes for relief.
"What took you half an hour?" He asked, thinking John had probably stayed at the pub and told Greg about the whole thing, how ignorant and stupid Sherlock was when it came to sex. Not knowing about snowballing. Honestly.
John twitched into wakefulness, frowning at the ratty wallpaper that met his eyes, wondering where he was.
"Fuck-!" Samuel grabbed at his radio, managing to get connection before a bullet hit his throat in a spray of blood and dense material.
The cup was put back to the saucer a little too quickly, clattering the two together before Mrs Hudson righted herself.
John's eyes were trained on Sherlock's cock as the remains of semen dripped off the tip. His hips pumped up, eyes jumping between Sherlock's face, stunned and embarrassed, to his cock which was slowly softening. He came with a strangled gasp.
John sighed, irritated. "It means that one of your shirts costs an entire week's paycheck for me and I'd rather just stay out here until you're done. Besides." He smiled but it was obviously forced. "I think the salespeople in those stores can smell it when you don't have money. I'd hate to get us thrown out on our ears."
"Once," Sherlock gritted out, still trying to get his wrists free but pushing back against John all the same. "And that was...I wasn't...You'd teased me beforehand."
"Take care of yourself out there." He murmured afterward, reluctant to let Shaun go after what they'd just shared, wondering if he were going to meet someone else for another fuck.
Oh, this was so trying. Sherlock winced and looked down to where his fingers were still hovering over his zip. "I know you want to. You were thinking about it all the way here." He paused for breath, anticipation making him breathless. "So...take me to bed." Sherlock tried to purr the last part, as he'd seen a few of the actresses in John's porn do a few times, seductive and coy…but he thought he may have failed as the remark didn't seem to affect John, who started casually removing his shoes, leaning with one hand against the doorframe and toeing them off with agonizing slowness before kicking them to the side.
Now, hours later, with his trembling boyfriend stretched beneath him, wrists tied to the headboard, helpless and feverishly aroused beneath him, John decided that yes, he was most definitely a sadist.
"Because I'm a spectacular, important genius." Sherlock said airily. "And a damn good shag. You'll want to clean that mess up as well." He gestured at their feet where the sodden and broken remnants of John's shopping lay. Sherlock gave John a cheeky grin before darting down the hall and slamming the door to the loo before Captain Watson got him.
He stood, expelling a feverish growl, and stormed his way to the living room, nude, and bereft of any sheet or duvet. Sherlock's face contorted into a scowl at the sight of the forgotten mobile lying on the table beside John's armchair, before enlightenment softened his striking features. With a malicious smirk, he picked up John's misplaced phone and hugged it close to himself, before heading back to the bedroom.
Sherlock stood on cold-stiff legs, and sent one final text to his last potential source of John-related advice. He scrolled down to 'DI Graham' in his contacts and rapidly thumbed his message.
John leant down and gave Sherlock a brief, hard kiss on his cupid's-bow lips, a faint smile creasing his dark eyes.
John sounded so confident, Sherlock almost believed him for a split-second. "You don't know that's what he did." He muttered, then whined sweetly when John's hand brushed over his crotch.
Adjusting his grip, spreading Sherlock even wider, John dipped his head and licked a swipe directly across Sherlock's hole. It clenched beneath his tongue, opening and relaxing before returning to its original state, and a fine trembling began in Sherlock's legs.
"Sherlock...do you...want to see it?" John asked, grinning his genuine, clown-like grin in the imposed gloom of the living room which was rapidly being invaded by early-morning London sunlight - eye-watering and welcoming. John hinted wordlessly by hooking his own thumbs teasingly under the waistband of his boxers and tugging at them.
Sherlock trembled, cock throbbing hotly in the tight passage of John's arse. He began to thrust slowly, trying to keep his own need and desire to come at bay, knowing John needed more than a few seconds of intercourse before he himself would reach climax. He needed to last- this time- for John.
"I just should have known, that's all. It's fine. It's sweet. It's fine," John soothed him, shivering a little at the delicate scratch of nails upon his sleepy skin.
Sherlock took advantage of John's  restless meanderings about the kitchen to surreptitiously pocket every single one of the little messages John had made for him, promising himself that he would photograph, photocopy, and memorise every printed sentiment, even the ridiculous ones. He might set up a luxuriant sapphire (John's birthstone? He thought so) filing cabinet in his Mind Palace to store them, and then indulge himself by wandering in there on lonely dark nights, armed with only a guttering candle and an un-admitted need for comfort, and re-reading all of them.
might have a refractory period of about 2 seconds, but I don't, and I definitely cannot manage anything right now. I'm knackered."
"Quiet, you," the doctor mumbled fondly. "I can at least try." Starting to hump against Sherlock in short, sharp, but very determined movements, he also teased the younger man's cock, thumbing around his slippery, retracted foreskin, tapping gently across his weeping slit.
He leaned over Sherlock, grinding against him again, their chests warmly pressing together, and licked at the place on Sherlock's neck he'd sucked earlier. "And god, I can't wait to fuck you like you want. Like you deserve."
Sherlock felt his heart clench in his chest. He knew what he and John had done up til now hadn't been adventurous. And he'd thought it'd been fine- more than fine, as John had said- but it turned out John wasn't satisfied. This faceless stranger had done all sorts of kinky things to John. To his John. "All sorts."
Gasping with discomfort and impatience, Shaun leaned back and effortlessly hooked John's legs over his shoulders, giving him a feral grin before he started pounding into him. John winced faintly but was more entranced with the beads of sweat dripping onto his over-heated chest like oil on a hot pan. He jacked himself harshly as Shaun had told him, pleasure coiling slow and reluctant through his body. He was distracted by the odd sensations of being fucked- of being stretched and used. Luckily- thanks to the alcohol- his inhibitions were down and John distantly thought he'd have a crisis fucking tomorrow over being fucked by a guy. Tonight...he just wanted to have fun.
Grimy, high-summer London sun seeped through the open window, the bedroom delightfully warm, with dust motes floating in random circuits through the room’s dense morning heat. The air was redolent with the heady scent of arousal, mixed with the exhaust fumes and next door’s cooked breakfasts from the street outside. Sherlock moved his mouth to John’s, nipping teasingly at his bottom lip.
John grinned wickedly. "I try. Another?" At Sherlock's nod, John eased a second finger into his arse, biting his lip as Sherlock's hole contracted around his fingers, a presage of how it would feel around his dick.
The smaller man nodded in understanding, and settled tentatively upon his partner’s body, which took his weight easily and without complaint.
"Oh." John hummed, taking a bite of his own toast. "I thought you might have injured yourself last night when you snuck into my room for a wank. Dangerous business, that."
"Sherlock f-fuck..." John groaned, his voice garbled, and Sherlock quickly jammed his cock back inside John's body, selfishly thrusting only a handful more times before he came, burying himself in the tight channel and spurting with a relieved, drawn-out moan.
Sherlock pressed his lips together tightly, again stifling what could have been a smile or a laugh, “Enough with this,” he said, tone soft as he stepped back and moved to tug the ring off.
"So that's a ‘no’...really?" Sherlock asked with a sweet, benevolent smile, leaning slightly closer to the Irishman. "Haven't you ever had two men at once? You can't say you're..." he lowered his already-sinfully deep voice to a truly decadent bass. "...Not curious," he uttered filthily.
"Well, that's comforting." John snorted. "Guess they don't need to know what I do to you behind closed doors." He winked cheekily at Sherlock, leering, and Sherlock rolled his eyes, feeling his face heat up.
“…My grandmother told me that when I was very young. Against all reason and logic, it stuck with me. Hateful,” he muttered.
The detective's expression was torqued with a reluctant pleasure, brows crinkled, and a sharp tongue repeatedly dampening his full lips.
Totally blinkered, his senses reduced to scent, taste, touch and sound, Sherlock nibbled his bottom lip, titling his head back and absorbing everything he could. "...Your fingers...you're using a new handwash...I know you don't like using mine because you think it's too posh for you...but they're softer than usual...your breath...I can tell you're using the same mouthwash and toothpaste as usual even though…I can smell the beer from the pub earlier. A microbrew you're rather fond of...your voice...you've b-been spending time with a new employee at work who smokes...you pretend you smoke just to get the ten minute break."
Perhaps she would have an insight into John's psyche that Sherlock couldn't quite penetrate. The detective huffed at his own thoughts, swanning into his bedroom and pulling on his favourite black trousers and his plum shirt. John had always reacted when Sherlock wore this shirt, in a multitude of ways. If he wore it now, perhaps he could comfort himself with the knowledge the doctor found him semi-attractive. It wasn't much, and didn't comfort him in the way he needed, but it was better than nothing.
Sherlock, squirming in an attempt to get his hand on his own cock, desperate to stroke himself off, smirked, breathless. "…Are…are you addressing me, or your cock?"
"Perfect." John smiled and followed behind his wobbly lover to their bedroom, watching as Sherlock stretched himself out on the bed, his hand returning to his throbbing cock almost immediately. He stuttered out a plaintive groan as he started stroking himself and John settled atop Sherlock's legs, straddling his thighs and watching those long, elegant fingers move over Sherlock's cock. Sherlock, his brow furrowed, was in agony. The more he stroked himself, instead of getting closer and closer to orgasm, he was getting further and further away.
