In one smooth motion, Jim set his glass on the table, leaned forward and took her hand, and kissed it. Looking up at her, he asked,
Hair ruffled, tie askew, shirt threw over the sofa, Mycroft looked every bit the utterly snogged creature that he was.
“You’re forgiven on all counts, John, especially the last.” Sherlock grimaced. “I don’t think anyone is ready for those.”
“But not for the reasons you think, Doctor. Not that it would’ve mattered. I was there. My reputation would have been ruined by the scandal, and I would’ve lost my livelihood if Lestrade hadn’t thought very quickly, indeed. What library is going to employ someone who has been netted in a police raid, especially one of that sort?”
Molly held the railing and made little porn star noises, and he held her hips until he swore and reached up and yanked her bra and blouse down to her elbows, mumbling,
“Oh, God, was I supposed to be keeping count? Aren’t you supposed to establish the rules at the beginning? I think there are protocols for this sort of thing. You should consult the internet.”
Much later, as Holmes sat as still as could be managed when being bandaged and poultice and stitched back together, his eyes, without any movement of his head, met Watson’s.
“I say I don’t know who I adore more, Holmes, the detective, the smuggler, or the baker!” I cried and closed the distance between us.
“There’s no excuse for you but be my guest.” Molly wandered off as Sherlock helped himself to her mobile.
Sherlock smiled wickedly at the camera, then bit the waistband of the pants and yanked them down. He held the stretched fabric in place as he licked then bit the exposed buttock.
“I fancy that whole jug on my head, but I’ll start with a glass,” he replied, gulping down the liquid. Then he sighed and handed the glass back to Mycroft. “Like you. Impossibly cool on the hottest day of summer. Also pink, in certain places and at certain moments.” He grinned.
“It’s okay, John. I’ll find us a place, and you can get some relief. Just don’t kiss me. Don’t kiss my face. At least, not until I can get home and wash it. And everything else.”
“Ah, well,” he said resignedly as Molly stifled a cry and clenched her thighs ‘round their fingers. “It’d be a waste of front row tickets. We’ll be back late, Sebbie.”
Masticated, the fruit sat in my mouth like warm paste and the colour of my skin must certainly have approximated its rosy hue as I realised what I had done.
“The least I could do since I spilled ink on the original. Don’t forget to put your name on it. Good night, Master Haverstock.”
The quilt, as it curled in on itself, had reached the level of Grodman’s neck, then his chin. He gave a final muffled cry.
Chemistry-challenged John and a gorgeous stranger are in a uni lab on Christmas Eve. Then there's an explosion (of sex pollen). Johnlock. Meet cute AU. Unilock. Sex pollen. Oral. Masturbation.
His touch was tentative and accompanied by frequent darting glances towards my face, which I kept purposefully open and placid.
“Careless, that,” he replied in a husky whisper. He studied her through half-lidded eyes, his lips pursing quickly, involuntarily in anticipation of another kiss.
I peered into the offered glass. It gave off a marvelously cold breath of air and was full of little red orbs.
Mycroft wriggled out of his trousers. With his movements, the grey pin-stripe material fell, pooling at his feet. Mycroft stepped out of the trousers carefully and left them on the floor. He turned and looked over his own shoulder and studied his own arse in the mirror.  He shook his hips back and forth and bounced on his toes, enjoying the way his flesh jiggled and filled out the fabric. He rubbed his cheeks and bent over and spread them and ran a single index finger down the cleft. He shoved his hands in the knickers and squeezed.
“It’s one thing to dress up as a Love Monster to make a bunch of children happy; it is quite another to attend a—”
“Very pretty. French lace. Detachable pearl net,” Stella squinted at the screen, “And fancy that, bra and knickers together, cost more than a month’s rent.”
Here I am, slumped against the garden wall, sorrowful and very heavy. The cab for which I whistled has been sent away. I spare a glance for the house behind the wall behind me and an oath for the man inside that house.
“Don’t speak too much,” I said. “You’ll only have to repeat yourself. But tell me this: who put you in the trunk?”
“Holmes,” I said, resting my firm hand atop his trembling one. “I shall do whatever you wish, but what is it that plagues you?”
Out of the corner of my eye, I spied Holmes standing in his usual disheveled state, but I didn’t dare look at him directly until my charge was resting safely on the breakfast table.
“Copy the instructions for Doctor Watson on a new paper and burn this one,” instructed Mrs. Hudson before exiting the room, muttering to herself, “Now, where are my glasses?”
The 5 times Holmes exposed his pajamas to the gaze of the public and the 1 time he didn't. Humour. Crack. Holmes/Watson. Rating: Teen.
“A lot,” she said. Not a question. Criminal masterminds didn’t hurt people a little bit. “Fuck me, then. Fuck me until you have to go.”
John smiled as he sat down in a chair with his own mug. “I have to say I prefer it very hot or very cold. Lukewarm bothers me.” He sipped, then hummed, then set his mug on the floor. “You look so good together. I’m sorry I missed the beginning.”
Then he grunts. It’s a noise of contradiction; like satisfaction at his stretched hole being finally,
“Sorry, Sherlock. As utterly fuckable as you are and as much as I want to fuck you, this was a bad idea. It’s too hot.”
John was awash with gratitude for the bee, and from then on, he never once fretted about making the tea.
“No, I didn’t. As far as I can tell, no one is being harmed in the process, and I have not been hired to remedy the deficiencies of the Custom and Excise Officials. I have informed Esme.”
John goes to see the worst hypnotist ever. Sherlock/John. Alternate First Meeting. Flirty banter. No smut.
Sherlock’s gold skirt was short. His black boots were tall. His vest was tight with a plunging neckline that revealed an apricot-coloured bra.
For the first time, MacCoy really looked at the stranger. He saw something like a skeleton key in those grey eyes. It turned inside him, opening what had long been locked up.
“I shall not,” he replied petulantly and blew out the candle. “How much do you think the author was compensated for writing a lurid story about me?”
I dropped her rather ungallantly on the ground and then collapsed beside her, panting and sputtering and mumbling incoherent assurances which were probably closer to madman’s ramblings.
mentioned John scrubbing Sherlock down on the fire escape. They also get credit for introducing me to the term 'craft herpes.' So, I whipped this out today and tacked on some somnophilia because it is one of my favourite kinks to write. The last line is from the film "The Mummy."
Notes: For the WW October prompt 'biscuit' and for my Ladies Bingo square I-3 'Someone Gets their Comeuppance.'
“Every ounce of care you’ve shown me over the last three days would be revisited upon you, Sherlock. You’d know what it feels like to be an Omega, at least an Omega with you. Cherished. Wanted. And fucked senseless
Then Sherlock set the box back on the side table and said, “There was a holiday. Recently. Where people exchange tokens of regard.”
“Yes. Mainly because I was worried that my boyfriend, the bull in the china shop, would come barging in regardless of our arrangement and his promise to behave and wait outside, and I’d have to go to plan B.”
“One of your foreign newspapers. It is true, Holmes. I can count, let’s see, four times so far this year.”
It said so quietly, so softly, it’s almost swallowed up by the noise of their bodies shifting on the bed.
Lestrade frowned. “I know a bloke who rents rooms on Montague Street. Until then, you’re here.” He nodded toward the head of the bed. “One rule: no smoking.”
“Right. Other members of the clean-up crew might do the same when they see the distance to the nearest town. They’ll be given the option.”
“That’s my Molls,” growled Seb, thrusting up with such force that Molly bounced. “Making the Boss go the good kind of mad. Oh, and I got a new Might-T-Mouse squeaker for Toby.”
“Probably because we’re on the fire escape, almost naked, getting soaking wet in October. Turn around.”
“Really, John, you aren’t very observant.” Sherlock gestured to the framed documents on the walls. “Yes, he ordered a Halloween Hypnotist at a drinking establishment. The blue glow stick that garnished the cocktail was tainted and cracked. He’s in hospital. I’m setting a trap for his killer. My theory is that he will return to finish the job; in fact, I believe him to be my 1:30.” He glanced at his watch.
Sherlock pushes himself to his knees. About to topple forward onto John, he reaches an arm out. Something steadies him. The bedsheet’s been drawn away, and he’s free to decorate John’s arse with come like he wants.
. In the beginning, it is grey. The world is a sphere of rock and vegetation. Sun and sea and shadow. No more.”
The lolly stick rolled from one side of the mouth to the other. Mycroft reached over again and pulled it out, cracked the window, and threw it out into the storm.
Greg laughed. “Horror-struck is a bit of challenge when you’re all decked out for the season, and I’m afraid no amount of eggnog is going to change that.”
“Yes, I have been using myself up rather too freely, but my compliments to your tailor, Watson, those trousers are rather flattering.”
I sighed the sigh of the defeated, but before I uttered my surrender, my eyes drifted to the folded page on the bed.
If Holmes required a beast, I could serve. I could be tamed, naturally, by someone with specialised knowledge and skill. I could do a bit of taming, too, if it came to that.
For the rest of the day, I shuffled from club to pub to park bench to pew with the brown paper parcel under my arm.
They cleaned up and had a quick but hearty meal which ended with another round of John’s spiced hot cocoa and Lestrade’s fondling hand nestled in John’s red pants.
“Over there, please. Thank you very much. Paperwork in order? Yes? Wonderful. All right, who do we have here? Oh, Mister Matthews. Let’s see what happened to you.”
John hummed. “A quiet night-in with dessert by the fire sounds lovely. Maybe I can persuade you to play a carol on your violin.”
“Yes, Mister Holmes discovered your error and rectified it before any harm was done, but he did have his fun in telling me the story afterwards.”
“Hey,” said Mycroft. He tossed his curls and looked over his shoulder with a pout. “Hey, hey.” He continued to protest as Lestrade walked him, hobbling, toward the bed and with a second shove, bent him forward.
I twisted abruptly in my chair, but, alas, throwing Watson’s armchair picnic out of my sight did not drive him from my thoughts.
“Good.” The stranger twisted his lips in a wry smile. “Afterwards we can do whatever you thought I was going to ask you to do.”
I heard Holmes move, then the squeak of his bedroom door. I chastised myself silently for my weakness and foolishness, and then he returned.
John massaged Sherlock’s buttocks in firm, circling strokes, admiring Sherlock’s wanton beauty, and cooing, “My gorgeous little slut, my filthy, cock-loving whore.”
There had been some awkward silences at the beginning, but he and Mycroft had persevered and found common ground. Old films. Old cars. And the surety that the chocolate raspberry martini, which they both noticed as it floated by on a server’s tray on its way to another table, probably looked and smelled much better than it tasted.
“Two conversations you had with Doctor Watson. I wasn’t eavesdropping. I just chanced to overhear. The warmth of your colourful phrasing left little to the imagination.”
And then he’s in Seb’s python arms and being held to Seb’s chet. Their legs are tangled together, and Seb is nuzzling him and making noises, half-hum, half-grunt.
“Christ, that smells good.” Lestrade was kneeling on the bed behind Sherlock. “John, would you mind—?”
“I know what a date looks like. Detective. Divorced. Remember? But anyone who picked that drink isn’t the one for you. Now, shall we be old-fashioned old fashioned together?”
Sherlock will figure ‘the what’ out. And if he knows that John is sitting here, waiting for him to figure ‘the what’ out, then he’ll have his ‘why,’ too.
“During that time, I so grieved the loss of you. It was quite painful to think of you during waking hours, so I often forced myself to forget and, perhaps, as a result, you often surfaced in my dreams, never more so than in that one.”
The next afternoon, John strode into the pub. “Worth every bit,” he said as he slammed several notes on the bar. Then he strode out.
“Uh, yeah, sure. Okay, but the question is: how do you stay so bloody cool on a day like today when the rest of us mere mortals are puddles of sweat and stink?”
“’The Hanged Man’ is about shrugging off the past. It is about up-ending the old order, pausing to reflect while waiting for the best opportunity. It is about sacrificing yourself to aid others and to become part of something larger. It is a powerful card for a powerful future. The card is reversed, suggesting delay, but, I think, not denial.”
And so it was that I surfaced slowly, gradually from a dream I knew to be pure memory and then was launched, suddenly and abruptly, into abject wakefulness.
, which has Victorian suggestions (e.g., wax lachrymose, be indisposed, tighten your corset, etc.). For the LJ Holmes Minor July prompt: dog days.
“Oh, God,” groaned Lestrade, and not in the good way. He gave the visitor standing in the threshold to his office a less-than-welcoming glance. “Mister Holmes, I am on my way home. Tomorrow’s my day off. I really do not have time for whatever cloak-and-dagger bullocks you come bearing.”
And all the while, he was opening me, then mounting me, covering me with his body and burying himself deep inside me.
Mycroft’s hands paused in their petting to give a warning tap. His body stiffened, then jerked and he gave a soft, half-stifled groan as he spent himself.
After a week of sleepless nights, I cut loose the past. What Holmes had said and done and my own blindness to whole bloody affair haunted me as did the suffering that some of my actions, though performed in ignorance, had surely caused him. Studying yesterday with today’s wisdom, however, was not only futile, it distracted from the business of tomorrow.
the sugar. Johnlock. Silly crack. For a case! Drugged sex. With a cameo by our favourite criminal mastermind and his sniper. Oral. Anal.
“It’s your lucky day, my alien-friend. Here I am, all tied up.” Greg looked down at the straps that held his nude body fast to the table. “Like a gift under the tree or in your extraterrestrial stocking. All ready for my kiss under the cosmic mistletoe.”
“Oh, God,” groaned the Alpha, the one with the funny name. Well, they both had funny names, so that didn’t help much. The younger one with the funny name had thrown his beautiful head back. He had dark curls and a sinfully sculpted pout. John could not resist licking the expanse of swan-like white neck.
“Has a host of modern amenities, including exquisite climate control and a showering suite that you might find quite pleasant.”
I've been telling myself this little bedtime story for the past few nights. If you think you'd read more, drop me a comment, and I'll contemplate fleshing it out. I've not read a whole lot of ACD Omegaverse, so I'm not certain it should go beyond that bedtime story stage.
With one hand, Sherlock yanked the front of the knickers down, then he wrapped the fingers of the slicked hand around his shaft. He drew his hand up slowly, from base to head, give it a squeeze at the top, then ran it back down to base.
“Come, Gregory.” Mycroft had a white-knuckled grip on the iron headboard and a pillow between his legs.
“I placed my hands on your person, in a most intimate manner, whilst you were sleeping without your permission.”
In an instant, the tableau shifted. Mycroft was forced to awkwardly slot himself half-beneath John in order to suck his cock while Sherlock fucked his hole.
“Perhaps that boathouse over there, there might be a box of croquet things atop the opening to a secret passage leading to yonder manor house.”
“I thought, well, poor Buster might be underfoot, might be a slight drain on resources, and since he seemed to take a shine to both of us…”
Moriarty looked up and chuckled. “Oh, that was worth it all. The panic on your face. Don’t worry, Sherly. My kisses are spooktacular.”
John blinked. “Molly? Are we in the fucking morgue, Sherlock?! Are we fucking in the bloody body freezer?!”
“You silly man. You’ve given me a terrible fright tonight. Thank goodness the one at the other end of the reins had more sense. Barabbas trotted to the cottage, and when there wasn’t a doctor—or a cart—I raised the alarm. Jacob is here. If you still have all your fingers and toes after this, it’ll be a miracle.”
They rarely fucked in John’s bed, and some hours earlier, John had gone to bed alone, abandoning Sherlock to an experiment in the kitchen. The experiment was about mud. Or dirt. Or maybe sand. John had been too knackered to pay it much attention. It had to do with buckets. Several buckets.
John giggled and shook his head. “Nah, that would be harder than I want. I’ll take a ‘Sad Wank, a Duet.’”
A Vampire Juice is a version of a Bloody Mary with vodka, tomato juice, horseradish sauce, steak sauce, and hot sauce. It is garnished with a 'eyeball' (a radish with a pimento-ed green olive in the centre).
“Perish the thought.” Mycroft heard someone calling his name. He said quickly and quietly, “I have a very nice boar bristle brush. Perfect for smoothing fur.”
“John, what’s the probability the poinsettia spritz punch Major Vamberry served us earlier was spiked with hallucinogenic drugs?”
“Oh!” she cried in surprise when her legs were hooked ‘round John’s shoulders and her arms twined ‘round Sherlock’s arms. Then Sherlock’s hands slipped back beneath her jumper and resumed their fondling.
“You met him yesterday and since yesterday you’ve moved in with him and now you’re solving crimes together. Might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?”
“…but is perineum sunning what I think it is,” he tapped the paper, “and why in the hell are we doing it at seven in the morning?”
He picked at the bedclothing and shrugged. Then he cast a glance at my swaddled torso and said, “Your ribs.”
Jim nodded. “You know, Sebbie, this whole business has made me a bit philosophical. And strategic. I’ve been thinking more about quality than quantity.”
Wet flannels were batted away, but Sherlock persisted before turning the Omega over and sheathing his cock once more.
“Six,” echoed Sherlock, adopting a mock nervous tone when he looked over his shoulder and asked, “Can I get a seven?”
Within reach of Seb’s hand was a glass of what the boss called a ‘winter-spiced old fashioned.’ It wasn’t something Seb would drink any other time of year or really any other place, but it seemed right, here and now.
“It is a genuine Adele Fortescue creation,” I observed as Holmes lifted the base to my eyes. “Signed and dated. I think it should have pride of place—for a while.”
“Nothing changed that night, I simply decided to postpone the act until the money for the room was due. And then, on that day, I ran into Stamford.” I exhaled and fell back amongst the pillows. “We met before. How extraordinary! You know, Holmes, sometimes I have the fanciful feeling that we’ve met in thousands of ways in thousands of times throughout history.”
“I don’t expect you to do things by halves,” muttered Seb as he gently eased the garment off Jim’s shoulders. “But leave my cousin out of it, eh?”
“I would have you near, at arm’s length, within sight, not tucked away up here,” he said and waved a hand.
Jim tapped the back of Sherlock’s head just before he came and pushed a handkerchief into Sherlock’s hand.
“You are,” interrupted Holmes. “And when I look at you, that’s who I see: who you are, who you’ve always been, brave, loyal, stout-hearted, compassionate.”
Sherlock led John to the sofa where they finished their very chilled champagne and proceeded to kiss and pet each other into a mutual state of haute arousal.
With my tongue on his skin, I tell him he is loved, treasured, valued above rubies. I cover him like the tide covers the shore, the length of me rolling against the length of him and filling him just as completely.
John hooked the lantern on a stub of a limb and flicked it on; then, bathed in its glow, he leaned against the trunk of the tree and tucked the bottle of lubricant in the waistband of the kilt.
“Allow me.” Mycroft circled Sherlock tearing off what little remained of Sherlock’s shirt. He kept circling, his hand still on Sherlock’s chest, caressing nipples, arms, shoulder blades, then back to nipples.
She turned her head and studied him with a half-lidded gaze. Then she brushed his lower lip with her thumb and said, “Riding this.”
“Oh, God, Sherlock.” John stumbled back toward the bed. “And when you brought me off with just your feet.”
The four hands were surprisingly gentle and adept at unpinning it and lifting it from Molly’s head. Then Jim began to ruck Molly’s skirt up.
He latched and suckled immediately. Then he drew her into his arms and pulled her onto the bed with him. Without taking his mouth from her nipple, he peeled them out of their clothing.
A Mid-Summer Night's Dream is cucumber, mint, gin, pomegranate juice, lime juice, and rose water, garnished with edible pansies and rimmed with pink sugar.
“If there is a machine that does what this does,” said Holmes, flipping the pages of a note-book, “then there might be one that could pluck bits,” he made the gesture with his fingers, tapping various newspaper clippings, “and weave the web that I weave.”
“No. I am lost without you, Watson. If you rejected my apology or if you did not wish to return to Baker Street or if you declined to accompany me on cases, that is to say, if you had no interest in renewing our association, then a facsimile would have to suffice.”
She stepped away from him and stripped from the waist down. Then she straddled him backwards and, yanking the chartreuse silk out of the way, guided his cock inside her.
“A driftwood fire is an excellent companion, but second to you, my dear Watson. You did what no bonfire could do: brought me a puzzle, helped me solve it, and now, are helping me celebrate. A trove above rubies, lost, found, or thrown before swine.”
Mabel dropped the note on the desk and, upon hearing her name being called from the street by the young fishmonger in that funny way of his—Ma-
“Oh, yes. Very well.” Holmes made a show of taking a deep breath, then said, “You know that I have made two trips to Paris.”
“Some days it’s a bit difficult to believe that you two are a ruthless pair of criminals,” said Molly, panting.
Goethe is referring to the bee and bell-flower, how they are made for one another: the bee perfectly suited to spread the flower’s pollen, thus, ensuring its propagation and, in turn, the flower perfectly suited to provide the nectar that the bee requires for nourishment, thus, ensuring the bee’s survival. Like flower and bee, Watson and I could not be more suited to each other. We ensure each other’s survival. Last night, I enjoyed playing the bell-flower. Watson must have enjoyed his role as well, to leave such a missive on the plump of my buttock.
Alpha Jim goes to a Milk Bar to do a hit but ends up meeting Omega Molly. Moriarty/Molly. Omegaverse. Meet cute. Lactation kink. Nursing kink. Romantic.
“But,” persisted Sherlock, “over a forty-eight-hour period, say, on holiday. That might be a fair playing field. Laboratory conditions.”
“Yes, well, I suppose someone more conventional wouldn’t have blown a hole in the bottom of our boat and left us marooned on a sandbar.” My voice was the driest part of me.
“Later.” She listened to a few beats of his heart then looked up, vision slightly blurry. “Lovestruck.”
When Mycroft’s cock was fully sheathed inside John, John pulled off Sherlock and licked, then bit, a glitter-painted thigh.
“My reticence may have led you to believe your, uh, performance was less than satisfactory, so I just want to state that nothing could be further from the truth.”
For Edward Gorey's birthday [22 Feb] using two cards from the shuffled story deck The Unhelpful Doorknob; the DW Watson's Woes February prompt: missive. And the DW flash-fiction prompt DAY 22: an unfinished work of art, a mycologist, a sense of foreboding.
He took the book of matches out of his pocket and leaned toward the stranger, who mirrored the movement.
Jim’s reply was a garbled noise around the barrel of the twin of the gun in his cunt. The stain of drool on the pillow beneath his mouth grew larger.
“Hmm. That will require a slightly different treatment, but I have an unguent for it as well. After an examination, of course.”
When he’d finished, we stared at each other in silence, the exchange temporarily driving out all thoughts, at least in my mind, of the horror we’d witnessed some hours before.
“Newman was not a fortune-hunter, at least not in the sense he claimed. He was trying to hide the bullion he had stolen under the guise of recovered treasure, and he would’ve succeeded, he and his accomplices, if it hadn’t been for you. That business of switching the wheels of the wagon to muddy the tracks, so to speak, was very clever.” I made a resigned noise. “Ah, well. Newman and his crew didn’t get away with it.
“The party is about to start. Care to stay for a drink? This will melt even the Ice Man.” Lestrade patted a large jug of red liquid.
“Precisely. During the first visit, I commissioned the creation of certain articles, and a fortnight ago, I went to claim them in person, not trusting the post and wanting to keep the purchase as private as possible.”
He licked and then pressed his face to the very core of her as blood dribbled out. He pushed his tongue inside her, tasting her, drinking from her, breathing in her thick scent. He kissed her clit again, and she whimpered.
“I was more of an idiot for thinking, well, whatever I thought for so long.” Sally lowered Irene to the floor. She cut the rope and threw the bits aside. “No need to keep this.”
He kissed Mycroft. Then he dropped a hand to the front of Mycroft’s trousers and rubbed. “All right if I accompany you to the airport? I’d like to take my time.”
John is waiting for Sherlock to come home. Johnlock. Friends to lovers. Mention of masturbation. Rating: Teen.
“Not at any price.” He threw the missive into the fire and watched it burn. “Some correspondence does not deserve stabbing.”
“…as loud and as explosive and as blue as we desire!” he cried and gave merry chase all the way back to Baker Street.
“I, too, have matters that require my attention, however,” Mycroft paused, “may I make a bold proposal? Will you be free in, say, four hours?”
I had never heard him do so before, but perhaps he was moved by the change of weather, as winter was showing the first signs of releasing its grip on the world.
She leaned back against the window and, bending her knees, hooked her heels on the edge of the seat.
Mycroft shoots Sherlock a look of inquiry. John senses, rather than feels, Sherlock’s nod of agreement.
The first 100 words were written for the DW Advent Drabbles comm Day 9 prompt: holiday tuxedo jacket (it was black paisley on black)
“What about the crime of pretending to be dead? Or pretending to be dying? You’ve done both, the latter when, according to he who may or may not swing for the crime of pencil-sketching, you were wearing pajamas.”

“Half of the profits,” announced our good landlady. “Doctor Watson’s share. I advised him to put his restless fretting about your welfare to better use than wearing holes in my rugs, and he did. He produced so many pies, savory and sweet, that I’d no recourse but to sell some of them. Word got round, and, well, for a short spate, Watson’s pies were in demand. I put some of the money earned into purchasing more ingredients, but there is still a surplus.”
Weather never seemed to affect the great mind of Sherlock Holmes. He readily accepted cases in rain, sleet, snow, fog, and wind. I never even saw him even acknowledge the elements—save for a flipping up of the collar of the Belstaff—until a relentless heat wave gripped London our first summer as flatmates and lovers.
I was not the only one drawn to this siren. A man in a green Homburg was queued in front of me and taking far too long with it. Finally, it was my turn, and so dire was my state that I was brusque to the point of rudeness. Nevertheless, the maid must’ve recognised my condition and taken pity for she gave me a double portion.
But after the next session, as John was raising himself off the bed and drawing the blanket about Sherlock’s shoulders, he looked down and spied one of the fuzzy, black, well-loved antennas.
Then she crawled into the window seat beside the tiny Christmas tree. The glass behind her was frosted with snow and ice. And there was enough light, she decided, with the fairy lights of the tree, and the string of large-bulb coloured lights hanging overhead.
“And then I’m bringing you home and tying you to the bed and smoothing out all the rough I’ve just done you.” I kissed sweetly along his jaw. “Keeping you on edge for the rest of the afternoon, you gorgeous, brilliant, madness-inciting wraith, until I’ve wetted my parched tongue with your tears as you weep for release.”
It wasn’t often that Holmes and I played host to someone of actress Jane Helier’s loveliness. I confess I was mesmerised as she recounted her tale in that melodious voice that has so captivated theatre-going audiences.
Your price is above talisman, above trinket, above any stone or metal deemed precious by its scarcity and its beauty and its place upon a sovereign’s forelock.
I step out and greet the day as the air is shedding its night dampness, taking on a delicious dry crispness.
There was a carefully-wrapped bottle in her lap. It was Thursday, the day that she and Martha would put the final stiches to their quilt.
not to resist the temptation. If you wish to leave, sever our partnership, I understand. I beg no scandal, but…”
“Uh, Sherlock? Is the table moving by itself? I thought you cleared this place of all the wires and strings and tricks.”
“Good morning, Poirot,” said John with a sigh. “Sacrilege, yes, this, and the weather. Barely nine o’ clock in the morning and hot as hell. Long Island Iced Tea?”
He inched up the body pressed to his and nuzzled the nape of a neck. He licked a tiny vertical stripe with the tip of his tongue from the vertebrae point beneath tousled dark curls right up to the hairline, where he pressed a flat kiss.
His eyes lit and he looked ready to launch himself at me when a new contagion of patrons entered, shuffling between us.
Martha surveyed the bundle in Margaret’s arms, which was much bulkier than her own. “Are you eating alone?”
Sherlock pulled his cock out of Moriarty’s arse, only to sink it right back in, quick and slick and sure, until it was fully sheathed. The howling wind masked his roar and Moriarty’s cry.
“You’re extraordinary.” John kissed the wet streaks on Sherlock’s face. “Amazing.” Kiss. “Fantastic.” Kiss. “Nothing will change that.”
Holmes tilted his head, more as if in contemplation of the fine Sunday morning laid out in front of them than Watson’s lament. “Your moustache is still as distinguished as ever,” he offered lightly. Then he took one of Watson’s hands in his and squeezed. “Changes are inevitable, Watson.”
Mrs. Hudson and Martha reunite to go 'kettle shopping.' Sweet crack. Featuring the sex on the bonnet/hood of the Aston Martin. Reference to Agatha Christie's Miss Marple.
“Holmes!” I cried, grabbing the small note-book hidden beneath the one in his hand. “You’ve not been collecting or sorting! You’ve been drawing pictures of us, holding hands, as dear little bees!”
Lestrade looked down at the tiny table, the two tiny plates of tiny food, and the glasses, one mostly full, one mostly empty.
“More likely he’ll swing,” said Lestrade, and Holmes and I took the words for the dismissal they were.
John was winding his way through the growing crowd, scanning the faces while trying not to appear as if he were talking to anyone or to himself. He was stubbornly resisting the urge to touch the device in his ear, the device by which he was hearing a tinny version of Sherlock’s voice lecture him on
It humbles me that I, who relied so heavily on my powers of observation, did not notice the line from Dryden’s Virgil spanning my belly until I set about dressing myself for the day. Beekeepers’ work is as arduous and never-ending as that of their charges. I fell instantly asleep last night, too spent to spare a single thought for the man who must have dressed me in night-clothes and tucked me into bed like a child and left behind these beautiful words to inspire me, like a gift under a pillow.
He couldn’t help the cry: John had him fully sheathed. His fingers, already in John’s hair, clenched, then he forced himself to relax the grip.
I write these few lines through the courtesy of this pneumonia of mine. The rattling cough, the shortness of breath, the heavy weight on my chest have all abated long enough for me to gather my thoughts, a pen, and this sheet of paper.
“Elliot Haydon made be found on his southbound vessel and brought to answer for his crime,” said Holmes. “I think it might be wise if Diana Ashely emigrated.”
The knickers were a matching shade of yellow but satin and, Lestrade reached between Mycroft’s legs, conveniently split-crotch. Lestrade rolled Mycroft’s balls round in his palm, marveling how the fabric nearly strangled Mycroft’s stiff, leaking prick.
As he thrust, he cracked one eye. A shadow in her woolly jumper, which had been hung over a low branch, moved. He tucked her head into the crook of his neck on the other side and batted it.
I retrieved the card from where it’d fallen and heard the proverbial creak of a coffin lid, the ghost of a memory seeking to sojourn amongst the living for a spell.
“You won’t sit comfortably for days,” Sherlock reassured him. He eased his own pants down and rubbed his prick in the cleft of John’s arse. “Feel how hard I am. When I get like this, you know I’m insatiable, especially when you parade your sweet hole like a tart. No pants? Naughty John.”
I gazed at the rush of waters and, in pure selfishness, allowed myself the luxury of single cold shiver.
“Now,” breathed Mycroft, diving onto the bed. Part of the petticoat sprang awkwardly up in the air and part bunched awkwardly around him. “This princess wants to be mounted and fucked.”
Molly threw her head back and arched her back. She drew her hands up her chest and squeezed her own breasts as Irene toyed with her clit and the damp folds of her cunt.
Holmes returned to the counter and immediately plunged into conference with the tobacconist. He returned carrying two knives.
Stella went to the door. Sally followed. Neither removed her headband with the rabbit ears attached.
Holmes, for his part as host, took up the cigar box and lifted the lid, presenting the box’s aromatic contents, rows of tightly wound leaf with gold bands, to their guest, giving a bow that was slight but replete with courtly grace.
“True.” Moriarty’s hand began to move again. “You know, my favourite part of your cock, Sherly? Apart from how embarrassingly quick you are to leak that lovely pre-come,” he quickly removed his glove and resumed his ministrations, “is that sinister bend to the left.”
“You’re a life-saver, my dear,” I said. “Such a pretty girl in such a pretty dress.” I took a cube of ice and drew it across his chest. “Feel better?”
I can't believe I haven't done PSL before. I did the frappucino a long time ago, but not the latte. The first 400 words were written for the DW 2021 fallintofallfestival prompt: Character A is embarrassed to admit that they love pumpkin spice everything, but it turns out character B loves it too.
“Aren’t you impressed?” asked Jim. He extended both arms and spun slowly ‘round, allowing Seb to view the whole ensemble.
Sherlock’s prick was hit with cold air and emptiness. His eyes fluttered open and he pushed himself up on his elbows and looked down.
They kissed. And kissed. And did not stop kissing, not even when Mycroft pushed down Lestrade’s loose trousers, slicked Lestrade’s prick, and offered him the tight crease of his thighs. Lestrade took the offering greedily, thrusting and finding his release while groaning wantonly into Mycroft’s mouth.
For what we knew of the earth and the body; for what we did with the candles and the fire; for what we knew….
Sherlock was sucking hard, painfully hard, but John didn’t care. He rolled his head against the wall, revelling in the wet heat of Sherlock’s tongue as it swirled around each bud.
“…in addition to the honey and flowers and your professional attendance as a supplement to Doctor Shepherd…”
Mycroft drew apart the sides of his dressing gown and yanked down his pyjamas and fed Sherlock his prick. Then he released his clothing and began to rub Sherlock’s cheeks. He loved how they changed when Sherlock took him.
No sooner was Seb swallowing a mouthful of bitter seed than he was being yanked to his feet by a man half his size and at least two weight classes below him.
Sally raised the device in her hand. “So you like to give someone else control, that’s the reason for this?”
Seb looked at Molly. She appeared to be chatting amicably with the ginger tosser. If there was any hint that the attention was unwanted, Seb would have gladly painted the lad’s hair red, blood red, but then he saw her give the ginger the ‘oh, I see my friend,” meaning Seb. Seb made certain the wanker didn’t give her any grief on her exit.
“It’s the glitter! Some of the staff wear it. I really wish you hadn’t done that. Listen, John, we need to get home right away.”
“Fleeing the scene of the crime? Yes, please notify the kettle-cide division.” She held up a malodorous specimen.
“What say you, Watson?” asked Holmes, turning his gaze toward the armchair. “Can you rise superior?”
Mycroft grunted. He withdrew his hand from Sherlock’s body and shoved his index finger into Sherlock’s mouth.
“Are you going to the bar tonight?” he asked when he’d used her thighs and, yes, her cleavage to come twice more.
He turned his work mobile off and left it on the desk. He turned his private mobile to vibrate and slipped it in his pocket
Some minutes later, there is a glass, two fingers of this, two fingers of that. This being the ‘Monster’; that being Jameson. It hurts, but Seb rolls his eyes anyway. “Long day at the office?”
“All right. What do you want me to do? Don’t say ‘go home.’ On the slim chance that Evans is here, there’s no way I’m leaving you here to face him alone.”
Their second first kiss was before the fire, with Kate nude and curled in Irene’s lap. Irene’s mouth was hungry, pressing hard, pausing its assault only to bite at Kate’s bottom lip and lick at her top lip.
“Nah, it’s this American sweet. Shaped like kernels of corn. Pure sugar, but so good. I can’t stop eating it!”
“The time you lured me to top secret military base under false pretenses, dressed up like an alien, strapped me to a table and shoved eggs up my arse to be the ‘Best First Date Ever’? Yes.” He grinned, then looked about. “So, dinner and a film? Is it as conventional as it sounds? Or is there something popping out to get me?”
. A thousand apologies. I know my butchering of the Gallic tongue is beyond reckoning. It’s criminal! Lock me up for my own good! Heh, heh. The green hour. Any hour’s green if you drink enough! But I like you. I like the way the water drips. I like the way the sugar melts. I like the louche. I’m a poet, don’t you know? Words, words, and more words. Not a painter or a sketcher or one of those fellows who chisels on stones, no. That kind of art takes more than eleven shillings a day, but a nub of a pencil and a thin note-book is manageable, even for a poor sod who washed up on Portsmouth jetty, pardon the language. Look here.”
But John hadn’t been too knackered to clean himself out in the shower and prep and plug himself up afterwards and sidle into the kitchen and extend a naughty invitation for Sherlock to join him—or join
“No doubt, but my desire is that you yourself leave behind such knowledge if it disturbs you. Bury it here, and we shall never speak of it again. Are you able to do that for me, Watson?”
For as soon as Watson is asleep, I am surveying the plains and valleys of his body with my tongue, tasting and exploring.
“Maybe you do. But was yours a born swindler? Mine was. After about four months, there wasn’t nothing more I could teach him in or out of the bunk, if you catch my meaning.”
“Yes! Oh, God. It’s perfect. Please, love, don’t stop!” He felt Mycroft’s hands running up and down his back as he thrust. “Your touch, so cool. Lovely.”
“Holy Mary!” exclaimed John at the smoke puffing out of the flask.  He hurried toward the stranger, who fixed him with a hard stare.
Harry cried out as John bared his teeth, then clamped ‘round each bud in turn, but she recovered her haughty tone when she said,
They made it as far as the piece of furniture which might have been, at one time, an unusually tall settee. It was shoved against a wall, by a window, and wholly inadequate for their purpose.
“It wouldn’t be the first time with you,” said Mycroft huskily. “Or even the twelfth.” His voice became more sober. “Detective Inspector?”
Immediately, one wet, sex-scented fingertip pushes between Sherlock’s lips. His stroking hand speeds up, keeping time with his greedy sucking.
“And you have mine. It is a sad state, isn’t it? But back to the matter that brought you here, I am as keen as anyone to have this grave-robbing mystery cleared up if for nothing else than to clear my profession of the horrible rumours that are beginning to circulate.”
Mysterious ways, indeed, but they must be tackled. A thin blanket is all well and good, but the fastidious gardener won’t stand for a long snake-like heap of those proportions.
“Just mine, then. What a lucky boy am I! Except for getting shot, of course. God, you’re gorgeous. I didn’t know angels wore jeans.”
“Why?! I hope you don’t let Lestrade or the bank executives hear your philosophising. Is this another James Ryder? Send them to gaol and make them a gaol-birds for life?”
I read the message and immediately did what I always do at such moments: drown my disappointment in the nearest book, which, in this case, was the book I’d brought for just such an eventuality. Inviting an inspector of Scotland Yard to share a convivial evening at a Turkish bath means accepting that unforeseen events may prevent him from attending.
My mind conjured an image, a tempting image. I doubt that even King David could resist such an image, and I was no King David. But how did fantasy compare to reality? Well, the only way to know for certain would be to tiptoe to the door and peek through the…
As I ate, I noticed on the interior of the brown was scratched a message in a familiar code of dancing men. It read:
I have said in my public chronicles of our adventures that the stage lost a fine actor when Holmes took to crime-solving, but this wasn’t acting, not by half, this was magic!
The fingers of my unoccupied hand were curled round the edge of the door. I used the door for more leverage as I sped up my pace.
“Glitter approaches the ideal contact trace, John, even, perhaps, more than carpet fibres. I’ve written a little something about it for the blog.”
“Let’s not consider my internal clock. It’s your day off. I assume a lie-in is of high priority on the agenda.”
Watson shivered, not from the memory of the scene, or the night’s cold, but rather from the notion, fantastic though it was, that the blue squares of the quilt were glinting, well, rather <I>vengeful</I> in the dim light of the kitchen.
The three of them looked on, unblinking, as the corner square of the quilt, the one which held the tangle of red poppies, rose up and concealed the horror-stricken face of a murderer.
She kissed his lips, kissed over his chin, down his neck to his chest. She licked his nipples and his belly. She sucked his cock until he was moaning. Then she pulled off and climbed atop him.
While Molly obliged her feline overlord, she sent a text alerting her significant other of her unexpected good fortune.
I made a lengthy, absurd notation in my note-book and observed Watson out of the corner of my eye. Red skin became white flesh as he bit the fruit, and my thoughts wandered from the quest for truth to how, were Watson’s teeth to sink into my shoulder ridge, at, say a moment of crisis, they might well turn exposed pale flesh back to redness. And how might I welcome that return, there and other places...
She’d coughed as she came, and the tip of a tongue had licked the droplets from the corner of her mouth.
There hadn’t been a lounge chair next to his when he’d closed his eyes., but there was now. And it was occupied.
Watson set the glass on the small table beside the settee and took his place in the vacant armchair.
“Yeah, a Santa Swap, sort of gift barter. The rules got fuzzy as the night progressed. Your brother took my jumper.”
Mycroft pulled one end of the pink ribbon, and it fell away from the small box. He lifted the lid of the box and set it on the bed. He removed the bit of pink lace and ribbon, studied it, then brought the most soiled part of the material to his lips and nose.
Lestrade took a thoughtful sip of coffee and leaned back in his chair. “No one has perfect vision, not the Yard, not even Mister Sherlock Holmes. The evidence you give about Rako will help the case against him when it comes to trial.” He looked at Holmes.
Sherlock dove in. The water was fine, and beautiful in the moonlight, but he’d only managed two strokes before he felt arms reaching for him.
Eventually Stella was on top. She straddled Sally and pulled the sides of her short robe apart. The top was hanging off her shoulders, but the gold sash was still tied. She ground into Sally and grunted happily.
That night, outside the back door, Mycroft left a pan of chicken sautéed with thyme, the fox’s favourite herb if the pattern of destruction was anything to go by.
Mrs. Hudson took command of the kitchen, and I assisted her and the housemaid Bessie in the rest of the breakfast preparations.
“I know,” said Lestrade, reaching beneath his desk and producing two more jugs. “I wish they sold it by the barrel. Every year, it’s the hit of the party.”
“She first called attention to herself by becoming disoriented, theatrically so, at the funeral of her cousin Alaric Fortescue.”
“No, it is simply the words which allow one purchase a certain seasonally-themed beverage at a certain establishment of which my sources tell me you are a frequent patron.”
Lestrade had entered the room wearing the agency-issued mask that, up until that moment, had always been comfortable and inspiring, even, as part of the uniform.
“Not cheating old ladies out of their pearl necklaces? You were good with Mrs. Forrester, by the way. Gentle. Kind. And you being good always makes me,” John paused to kiss Sherlock’s lips, “want to be bad. Very bad.” He unfastened Sherlock’s trousers and slid his hands inside, cupping bare buttocks. “Christ, no pants,” he groaned, then licked a stripe up the side of Sherlock’s neck.
A pink bikini is pink lemonade, amaretto liquer, and coconut rum, festively served in a halved coconut shell (with the meat intact).
“There,” said John as he quickly eased off the bed and stood beside it, looking at Sherlock like an artist appraising a half-finished canvas.
“Well,” Jim slipped behind her and pressed his lips to her bare shoulder, “if you were ever on the receiving end of any
Mycroft and Sherlock glared out their respective windows. Then Mycroft pressed a button on the intercom. “Baker Street, please,” he said and leaned back against the leather seat.
The gentlemen proposed to clean the last of the dishes, but Mrs. Hudson declined their offer. She wanted a few minutes to herself to savor the last of the day.
(part of the British Library Crime Classics series). It's a locked room mystery where the room is a train compartment and it includes reference to a 'well-known criminal investigator' who writes a letter to the Gazette giving his theory of the crime, which is summarily proved wrong by the authorities. I felt like vindicating Holmes a bit and ACD (being ACD) makes two thoroughly shippable characters in the crooks of the story. Sparrow MacCoy is said to go to Cairo at the end of the story.

It was a tiny herb garden, the rest of the area behind the cottage being given over to savage growth. Mycroft was not in residence often enough or for long enough periods of time to dedicate himself to anything more, and it was more about the pottering than the garden itself.
John sucks hard on Sherlock’s bottom lip. His hips start to buck of their own accord. Then he turns back to Mycroft and licks at Mycroft’s lips. “Need your cocks,” he whimpers. “Spit-roast me. Take turns. Arse and mouth. Mouth and arse. Fill me up.”
Lestrade snorted. “In that case…oh, fuck, well, I’ve certainly forgot about whatever it was I was going to forget about. Oh, yeah.” He let his head roll back until it hit the wall. “God, you’re a clever lad, aren’t you?”
“The one about eating fruits and vegetables? Right. You care about Sherlock. And this, well, it could be more, if you wanted it to be.”
The blacking is based on a receipt given to him by a gentleman’s gentleman, a hundred if he was a day, for whom he’d done a good turn. He’d improved upon it with his own chemistry, of course, but only slightly.
He cried out as I sheathed the entire length of prick inside him with one merciless thrust. Upon bottoming out, I paused, slipping my hands beneath his shirttails and massage his lower back, allowing his body a moment, but just one, to adjust to the intrusion.
Jeanine shifted. Sally slipped her hand back between the seat of the bike and the crotch of a pair of sodden, barely-there knickers.
“High probability of transfer and retention, John. And, in many scenarios, more fun acquiring than gunshot residue, but do tuck yourself in.”
I’d lived as the ghost of Sherlock Holmes for three long years, and in those three years, I’d not been able to push Watson from my thoughts. How I longed during that time to take my ephemeral form in earnest and return to London. Surely, ghost must be able to fly. Or project themselves through the ether.
“Don’t go yet.” The Detective Inspector leapt toward the kitchen, open a cupboard, and plopped a box on the counter.
The voice in her ear was marvelously strained when it sang, “Doesn't like crap games with barons or earls, oh, God, Molly!”
He kissed up her body as she shook, nuzzling her belly and her cleavage. He licked her neck and confessed, “They were pussy flowers.”
A very belated birthday gift to Vulgarweed; this ficlet is inspired by and a tribute to a hilarious line in
Sherlock turned his head and smiled as John’s jumper began to purr. Then he closed his eyes and listened to rain against the window pane.
Babysitting Rosie has an odd effect on Molly. Molly/Irene. Lactation kink. Exhibitionism. Public sex. Pegging.
He pressed back against it, as if he might impale himself on that slight, wet, wriggling protuberance.
Lestrade hummed. “I want you to think about me watching you, whenever you happen to glance at the security cameras and whenever you happen to remember they’re there, whenever one of the officers crosses your path. I want you to think about me fucking you, sucking you off, sodding you, tongue-fucking you, playing with your nipples, your balls, every part of you.”
The stranger took another puff, and John heard a tiny hiss when he buried his cigarette in the snowbank.
“Oh, Martha, thank you so much for suggesting this. It’s been ages since I’ve been here. Or had a nice afternoon tea.”
“But you didn’t get what you paid for. Bad business.” He tucked the money loosely in his bra and produced a tube of lubricant from his purse. Then he unzipped his skirt and wriggled out of it.
“Oh, very well, Doctor Watson,” said Lestrade, a bit defeated but relieved. “In truth, I should be very happy to see you out here.”
She unbuttoned her blouse and unhooked her bra and leaned out over the balcony and shook her shoulders.
Before I could even form a coherent thought, I was throwing off my coat and diving into the cold water.
Until now I’ve kept mum on my appreciation, but—and this is, without doubt, the smoke’s fault—find myself persuaded that a confession might very well lead to bliss.
Author's Notes: For the June Holmes Minor prompt:  Mistaken Identity. Inspired to Okapi Minisculus (age 3) who I discovered this morning has a slightly unnerving problem with the word 'footprints.'
“The floorplan of the venue hosting the orgy. Here are the fire exits. Here’s where the first aid stations will be. Here,” Stanley opened a binder, “are the shift rota of the volunteer staff for security,” he flipped a page, “entertainment, and medical assistance.”
But just as Sherlock was about to spend himself, Moriarty heaved upwards, lifting Sherlock, then threw himself sharply downwards, and twisted. Now on his back, he hurled himself at Sherlock and flipped their positions, effectively pinning Sherlock onto his back on the rug.
I’d had other plans for this midsummer evening, plans washed away, perhaps literally, I would assess the damage in the morning, in a sudden, violent storm.
“Everything I have to say to you has already crossed your mind,” murmured Moriarty as he wrapped his hand ‘round his own prick.
“You were fantastic, Holmes!” I exclaimed as we settled in the hansom cab. “How you concluded it was a tailor’s shop which was wanted and not a seamstress shop or any other similar establishment from nothing but a thread, a needle, and a smear of chalk, was nothing short of brilliant!”
“Quite relevant, my dear Watson, because I predict that your gift will ruin your mouth for human kissing for some time. Happy anniversary.”
As Sherlock Holmes neared his third birthday, Mycroft began to wonder, with mixed disappointment and relief, if his younger brother were normal. As far as Mycroft could tell, Sherlock showed no signs of heightened intelligence, but Mycroft admitted that his own grasp of what a three-year-old should and should not be able to do was tenuous. Nevertheless, he decided to test Sherlock.
“My Queen,” said Jim, casting a look of undisguised adoration at her. “Always anticipating our wants and needs. I’ll admit I wasn’t prepared for how much I enjoy watching you taking Sebbie like the naughty tart he’s always been.”
A second tentacle, the thinnest one, the one nearest Mycroft’s left shoulder blade, joined the party when Lestrade eased his pyjama bottoms down, far enough to expose his cock.
He is but a brush to be used for polishing, he reminds himself. He is fed more. He sucks. He bobs. All without touching, save the prick to his lips, palate, and tongue.
Mycroft tilted his head toward the strolling tourists beyond the glass window. “Do you fancy this kind of holiday, Detective Inspector?”
“I remember, Lestrade, because you gave the forgery case to Hopkins, and she’s bungled the whole thing.”
“Doing my best, sweetheart,” groaned Lestrade who was cock-deep in John’s arse.  He slowed his thrusting and looked over his own shoulder and down and caught sight of Sherlock’s profile, a fountain of dark curly hair hiding the face that was buried between Lestrade’s cheeks.
“I abhor assumptions, John. It’s a capital mistake to theorise before you have all the evidence. And we will position ourselves for your pleasure alone.”
“What do you suppose this was?” I asked, gesturing to an odd corner in what must have been the sitting room.
“All Hallows’ Eve is right around the corner, my dear man. I couldn’t resist. Just a bit of wire and our old friend Skelly.”
Then she released the button, listening to the faint shouts and stifling her giggles until a voice behind her said,
Sherlock coated his hands, spilling the oil all over the kitchen counter and floor in the process, then bent John forward and wrapped a slick fist around his cock.
“Middle-sized, strongly built, square jaw, thick neck, moustache. We separated when, well, never mind when. The trail ends here, in the Egypt wing. Tell me, what’s the most sensational corner about?”
“Let’s go,” said Janine eagerly. “Running into you is the best bit of luck I’ve had in a long, long time.”
John snorted and peeled her shirt off, then blushed as an appraising hand ran up and her down chest.
It was, John decided, an intimate act, this one. Exchanging of fire. Enabling someone else’s vice. Hands and lips nearing. It also gave John the opportunity to observe a pair of lovely grey eyes and a mouth of which Renaissance sculptors dreamt.
Hours later, Mycroft was standing at the wash basin, studying his reflection in the bathroom mirror. One day, he’d just go grey and be done with it, but, for now, he closed his eyes and shuddered at the memory of that exquisite mouth, he’d keep up the charade.
As Greg rolled toward the sound, he was quickly enveloped in a pair of slightly sweaty, but very human arms. He pressed his face against damp cotton and mumbled, “Am I prime, Mycroft?”
Jim turned the sign on the front door as he sidled to the counter. Then he sank behind the counter and reappeared with a violin case. “Thought you might be interested in this.”
“Show him somewhere else. I’ve got work.” Molly took a long swig and handed the flask back to Sherlock. “Thank you so much for everything. Now get out of here or I’ll call Mycroft, then security.”
He set the phonograph playing again. Now he was in his dressing gown alone. He placed a jar of unguent on the small table beside him as he sat on a straight chair before me with legs spread.
After that, Mycroft wore only a nighshirt to bed, giving the fox more freedom to lick wherever he liked, which was, apparently, everywhere.
Sherlock’s eyes widened, then his voice dropped to a low whisper. “Tonight you will serve your Queen with constant—and utterly depraved—displays of adoration.”
As Irene wept, Kate felt her eyes sting as well. She did nothing to stop either flow of tears. She caressed Irene’s face and hair and kissed her sweetly and gently and whispered over and over.
“Good thing the police didn’t know about your seasonal benevolence. It might have counted against you.”
nice as cocks go. Makes me wish I had studied incubus-ing or succubus-ing or, what’s the other one, oh yes, communications, in school.”
Holmes continued. “Across the street, a pair of unsavory characters were putting crates of books and manuscripts in a wagon.”
He marveled at the sitting room: the magnificent Christmas tree with all the trimmings and the miniature snow-covered village encircled by train tracks. He listened to the ‘toot, toot’ of the engine as it made its way ‘round. He washed the rest of the pie down with the remainder of cocktail and set the glass on the window sill, then resumed the journey of the rose petals.
It was nice, being exposed like this, knowing there were a pair of grey-cat eyes out there watching.
She remembered the way he gripped her hips hard right before he spent himself. She tried to reproduce the gesture with her own hands but shook her head at the failed effort.
“Really, John? If I say I want you to slam that fat cock in me, fill me with your come, make me yours, make me scream, it’s okay?”
“Much better. Thanks. Oh, god, this is good.” He shot Mycroft another look. “I hope you’re getting your money’s worth, Brother Mine.”
Holmes nodded. “In my moments of gravest ennui, I suspect I would have made a first-rate fiend, and of course,” he went on, his tone becoming teasing as his eyes lit upon the returning Watson, “we all know that when doctors go bad, they are the most depraved of blackguard. Have you ever had that notion, Mister Grodman, to commit a crime?”
He smiled a wide, handsome, easy-going, kind smile. It was a smile that Mycroft had not seen in five years.
She leaned forward, towards the camera and rocked a bit, letting her breasts hang and sway for his enjoyment. She remembered riding him and the way his hands guided her up and down and played with her breasts and caressed her stomach and buttocks.
John’s head jerked back, and Harry planted sloppy kisses on the side of his neck and the leather collar.
Suddenly, the tower upon which Sherlock was dancing lit up. Then something shifted above the crowd. It looked like cords or cables, but by the time John recognised it as a zipline, Sherlock was already flying overhead, showering the pulsing throng with a sprinkling of stardust.
“Such a good girl. Good girls get as many orgasms as their beautiful bleeding bodies want.” He bent and kissed her clit.
“Believe it or not, Margaret, common criminality is a refreshing change for me.” She shot a rueful look at the ceiling. “How was the christening?”
“Solved. Victim drank hat dye thinking it cough syrup. Door locked from the outside with pinchers. Thank you, Watson.”
I've run across a couple of different recipes for a Dead Man's Chest. Most are rum-based tiki drinks.
The next four ficlets are going to be linked by a (thin) plot thread. Here Moriarty mentions a Halloween party that Sherlock and Mycroft are going to attend. The next ficlet is the party and so on.
Sherlock made a noise of approval at this plan and spun round when Mycroft withdrew his finger. Sherlock hooked his legs around Mycroft’s and leaned forward.
“This is not a roleplay, Sherlock. I’m not your creepy schoolmaster who wears his reading glasses on his head and waxes poetic about Swinburne while he takes a birch to you for chewing gum in class.”
Second, it’s quiet, apart from John’s snores. Mycroft, of course, is silent as the grave. But Sherlock
Reclining on a wooden bench like a piece of ceramic in a kiln, I found my sorrows had almost vapourised.
I sat propped against the trunk. Divested of his jacket, Holmes settled himself at the end of my outstretched legs.
“Happy Christmas, Mister Holmes!” cried Lestrade. He was the most handsome example of a human being that Mycroft had ever seen clad in a red-and-white, reindeer-and-Christmas tree-jumper that Mycroft would have paid a sum as hideous as the jumper to remove from his person and burn.
I rolled towards the bedside table and reached for the jar of slick while Holmes began to nibble at my neck.
Sherlock pulled off and sat back on his heels. “If we let him watch us, without his knowing that we knew, do you think he might join us?”
Irene thought of imitating the caress on her own body, but immediately discarded the notion: her coat and gloves and dress beneath were too much obstacle. But she felt her muscles tense and relax, tense and relax.
“Shagging on the rug! Where’s Sherlock and John? Should I make an arrest? Or two? Call for back-up? Oh, uh, by the way, here.”
“Damn. Uh, what to do, what to do? I don’t have a Typhoid Mary fetish, or I’d defy this bloody quarantine and give you the best hug of your life, Mister Holmes. But you asked if there’s anything else I require, and I think I am in great need of a tossing off partner. I mean, I can’t spend all day watching films and reading books and caulking bath tile. Are you amenable?”
In an instant, John was up, and the mad chemist was down, and his beautiful face was covered in John’s spunk.
“The only one you’re liable to remember if you are downing your last drink.” The voice was soft and seductive. “Tell me about Eddie.”
“Sorry, lads. Party’s over before it’s begun. Case, and one you might like Sherlock. Oh, that’s a birthday martini! Did you take a sip and make a wish?”
The two sitting room windows dripped with egg. A ladder stood between them and a bucket of cleaning supplies to one side.
“There is a little something for you, too,” he said, producing a box wrapped in brown paper and tied with string.
John laughed. “You git.” Later, he would decide it was a mix of the urgency of his bladder, the nearness of Sherlock, the late hour, and his drunken state that prompted him to risk all by saying,
He licked and licked and licked at the pink satin until she begged. Then he curled the knickers down and she opened her legs wide and he put his mouth to her and…
“The good news is that I’ll be able to watch you all night.” Lestrade’s voice fell to a husky rumble. “I won’t neglect my responsibilities, of course.” He nuzzled at the side of Mycroft’s neck.
It was better to be stripped naked, to be laid bare to the harshest taunts and jeers, than to be deprived my Watson. The letter from Meiringen was a hoax, of course, to draw away my surest defence outside my own abilities and clear the way for a direct assault.
“A Study in Veiled Scarlet.” Harem AU. Holmes is the sultan’s favourite concubine. Watson is a prisoner of war.

“They can try,” said Jim dryly. Then he nibbled at the fine brunch casserole that Seb had prepared. “I think we should lie low, Sebbie, for a while. Just in case. There’s plenty to do here. The bathroom needs retiling.”
My spirit yielded to temptation. My spirit surrendered to the desire to have my stalwart companion at my side as I stride into battle, no matter that the desire, the yielding will surely drive that companion—the best of all who bear such a name—directly and unnecessarily into harm’s way.
I turned my furrowed brow to Holmes, who made the familiar ‘I will explain later’ gesture. Then he moved behind Lestrade. “Mister Unworthy killed his brother with the palatte knife and gave his brother’s body to the fungus. This species, apparently, finds human flesh an adequate form of nourishment.”
“Dinner was lovely, but I wish that the dancing didn’t require me to be decked out like a fool.” He stroked his beard and checked again that his horns were still in place and that a long, pointed tail was still attached at the rear of his red harem trousers.
“The distinctive blend of scents known as Hammam Bouquet on your clothes can only mean you’ve eschewed the Turkish bath on Northumberland Avenue for the one on Jermyn Street. And I’d be a poor detective if I couldn’t detect rum on the breath of a man who is as spirit-filled as the one before me.”
Mycroft blinked, then he cupped Lestrade’s cheek and brushed his thumb across his lips. He shook his head slowly, silently.
“It works.” Lestrade sipped his drink and licked the froth off his lips. He felt Mycroft’s eyes on him. “Think about it and let me know in a couple of weeks whether you want to try meeting in someplace other than this coffee shop.”
Moriarty tried resist, but in violation of his plans, his sense of self-preservation, and all his villainous common sense, he fell asleep.
Lestrade envisions a quiet weekend with a jigsaw puzzle, but Mycroft's plans change. Tentacle!Mycroft. Oral sex. Come play.
The Mister Spy vs. Spy’s eyes were closed, and he looked like a statue. His hands were resting on John, but not, John thought, really touching him.
Moriarty drew the blanket away, exposing Lestrade’s stiff prick and the ring that encircled its base. Then he beckoned Mycroft with a wave. Mycroft got to his feet and moved behind Lestrade. The metal ring of a plug jutted out from Lestrade’s buttocks.
“Is risen today!” sang Sherlock as Stella reached for the object. “You’ll want gloves for this.” He drew a pair out of his coat pocket and handed them to Stella.
“Yeah, after the last case, I wanted something that was easy to solve. I just got the pieces sorted into edge and non-edge.”
Sherlock looked up, removed his goggles, tilted his head, and pressed his lips tightly together for a moment before he asked,
Lestrade brushed Mycroft’s bottom lip with his thumb, then trailed kisses down his neck, only stopping to whisper,
The prosecutor went pink but recovered quickly. “You could not have seen what you claim to have seen, Miss Mohels, at that spot on the night in question. You are mistaken. Do you wear glasses when you are not plying your art?”
Watson smiled. “Not at all. Anstruther is taking over my rounds this morning. I think I shall escape into one of my Clark Russell stories where the only calamities are fictional shipwrecks, storms, and sea monsters!”
