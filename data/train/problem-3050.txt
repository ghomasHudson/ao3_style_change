His fight or flight instinct kicked in immediately, pumping adrenaline through his entire body at the speed of light. At the same time, he felt as if he couldn’t move.
When Dean pulled out, he left him with semen dripping from his hole, picked up his clothes that were strewn all over the floor, and went to the bathroom.
Castiel lost the second round. For a moment there, he had forgotten all about the bet because Dean had made him feel
This time, Dean was the one to roll his eyes at Cas’ self-sacrificing antics. “Yeah, no. We’re not doing that.”
“Wow. If my family were still talking to me, they’d disown me if they knew I was doing this.—They’re very traditional.”
Ever since then, his shop had attracted some flower enthusiasts as well as his usual magical clientele. Most of all, Castiel appreciated the soothing scent, so all in all, Dean’s mishap had been fortuitous.
Cas blinked at him, obviously not having expected that question. After a moment of silence, he offered a tentative, “Maybe.”
That sounded like another reference of sorts, but Castiel was not inclined to figure out secret meanings behind words, so he leaned in.
The advantage of finding your happiness in just being was that no one could take it from you. Only now, Dean wanted to take it from him.
That’s why one Trivia Night Thursday at the Roadhouse, when they were preparing themselves for the first round and Charlie told him
Cas seemed to consider this for a moment and then said, “I actually wanted to keep talking to you some more, but you’re right. Wet underwear
Since he had never intended to get mated, he had no idea how to go about breaking a mating bond, though. Maybe Cas had a better understanding of the steps they needed to take.
In any case, Dean now had the image of Jimmy using this sex toy in his head. Then the image was replaced by an actual
Not right now! This was a really embarrassing position to catch him in. He quickly let go of his wing to glare at Gabe.
“Yeah, that’s what I meant,” Dean said, which—going by Sam’s look—hadn’t been a great save. But that’s when the doorbell rang anyway, so Dean went to the front door to let Cas in.
But just thinking about the fact that Dean might spend his rut with another omega… Scent-marking him had really been for Dean’s own protection, just in case some skanky omega wanted to use him for a one-night stand. Okay, so the argument was pretty thin, and Cas was apparently a selfish assbutt.
A whimper from the other end of the line told him that that wasn’t good enough. Since Dean sounded like rut sickness might be setting in, Castiel thought back to orientation and what to do in urgent cases.
He sounded and smelled so happy that Dean smiled against his neck and fondly whispered back, “Told ya!”
Unperturbed, Dean sighed deeply in his sleep and his grip on Castiel tightened, pulling him closer. Castiel tried to scoot away without waking him, even though there was hardly any room left, but his attempt was futile anyway because Dean let out a dream growl that sounded adorably unthreatening, and the next moment, Dean’s face was smushed against his neck and Dean started scenting him.
Since scenting each other at the same time required some contortions, they usually just went straight for the bed so that they could find a more comfortable position, which would enable them to scent straight through the hour, without straining their necks or backs.
At the same time, Dean felt his own balls pull up close to his body and his knot caught on Cas’ rim. He pushed it in with one last harsh thrust and then he let loose deep inside of Cas.
“Whoa! Hey!” Dean interrupted him, choking on his fries. He looked around as if to check that no one was listening to them. Then he added in a lower voice, “Are you crazy, man? You don’t just
?!—when Castiel held him back with a powerful shove of magic that made the alpha stumble and look at Castiel incredulously.
Right. Dean was probably here to keep Balthazar’s ghost from exposing him. Kill him for the second time as it were.
Just as Cas wished Dean would kiss him (he loved when Dean was deep inside of him and pushed his lips apart to lick into his mouth), Dean pulled out so that he could push Cas onto his back and enter him again.
He might have just imagined it. Surely no alpha’s scent would have a component that smelled that nice.
a bit weird, though, was seeing Cas in his old AC/DC T-shirt which was a bit too big for him, since he needed something comfortable to sleep in.
In any case, Cas did want pups. Desperately. He’d always wanted pups. Time had just gotten away from him a bit.
Castiel had never felt like this in an alpha’s presence before. Cared for and safe, but even more than that.
Angel grooming buddies only needed to do each other’s wings maybe once every few months, if that. They always had their grace to fall back on, after all, even if it wasn’t quite the same as a good grooming from another angel. Fortunately, Dean didn’t know that, so when Castiel’s wings were acting up again not even twenty-four hours later, he went to ask his new grooming buddy if he could help him out. Dean didn’t even bat an eye at the request.
Then again, it was hard to believe that Cas didn’t know what he was doing to Dean. Under any other circumstances, it would have been obvious that this was a seduction technique designed to get the alpha in the right mood for some playtime.
He took his time putting the sample bottle back and taking the real bottle behind it, hoping his dick would get the message and go down. Then he walked up to the counter and handed the bottle to the beta.
Dean smiled at him. He had a lot of smiles. The teasing smile, the polite smile, the reassuring smile, the ‘I’ve got a secret’ smile, the playful smile… This was the smile with the dimples that Castiel liked best because it was a natural smile. The happy smile.
“Oh, you mean this one?” Cas threw a leg over his lap, straddling him, and leaned in to scent him, which—yeah, was definitely nice, but…
Dean, who had been sitting on the couch with a beer, feet up on the table, jumped up, gun in hand, which he pointed about one foot to the left of Castiel.
“So, we just keep standing here for a whole hour?” Dean asked after a couple of minutes when his legs began to ache after a day on his feet.
Huh. Apparently, Dean hadn’t been as sneaky as he had thought, and Cas had finally gotten him back. Although the angel might have misinterpreted what was going on here. After all, Cas had never really understood the human tradition of pranks.
He had never wanted a repeat performance with any of the alphas he’d fought. Fucking them and forgetting them, that was his motto. He wouldn’t mind fighting blue eyes again, though.
As promised, Dean accompanied him on his shopping tour, and even helped assemble some of the furniture. (Well, all of it. Cas had no idea how any of it worked. He mostly just handed Dean his tools and kept out of the way.)
His alpha?! They didn’t really talk about their private lives a lot, but Castiel was pretty sure Impala knew that he was single. For one, the status on his profile was ‘unmated.’ Plus, no alpha would have been okay with them playing the kind of scenes they had been playing lately. Granted, it was just a game, but the fact that Impala had made him hard would definitely have tipped this into the cheating category.
He had to have given it away by how eagerly he was sniffing along Jimmy’s neck because Jimmy suddenly realized, “Oh. Right. I should reapply the alpha scent.”
Instead of acknowledging that Dean was just doing what the latest research suggested, Sam pointed out, “You’ve fluffed that pillow four times.”
Still, when his knot went down and it was time to say goodbye, for the first time since he had started coming here, he hated that anonymous rule that meant no names.
Cas was still looking at him, head tilted. “But shouldn’t you find someone whose scent doesn’t bother you?” he finally asked.
“And as for your inability to scent—I ain’t judging. This is my job, believe me, I’ve seen worse. But it’d be easier if you’d let me help.”
But had he really led him on? He had said nothing but the truth, even when he had told Jimmy how sexy the mark on his neck made him look. Of course, that mark would look good to the alpha who had put it there. It had made Dean want to kiss it and gently stroke it… with his tongue… and then they could have made out for a bit…
The oil gland Dean was teasing mercilessly was sopping wet at this point, pouring oil. There had to be a connection between his oil glands and his mating gland because it started tingling in sympathy with what Dean’s hands were doing to his back and wings. Maybe the connection extended to his stomach as well, since strange sensations began to build low in his abdomen, spreading throughout his body.
“You... You wanna be my omega?” Dean asked, making sure he understood what was going on here. Even though this had been the ideal outcome to his plan, he only now realized that he hadn’t expected that response. ‘Oh’ had been a lot closer to what he had prepared for. “Forever? With my mating bite on your neck and everything?”
His heart was beating frantically against his ribcage. There was only one sentence running through his head on repeat.
“I told you witch-killing bullets wouldn’t work on a witch ghost,” Sam said, and then they were off discussing the case.
Of course his “Sorry, got to let an omega scent me” had made him the perfect target for teasing, but so what? He’d be home early enough for
His good mood from when he had seen his pup and listened to its heartbeat had evaporated by the time they were in the car on their way back.
Typical. Gabe probably enjoyed meddling so that Castiel would lose a charge and he could get nominated as cupid of the year.
He would do what Dean had told him and wait here until he could put on his shirt again, just resting his eyes for a few seconds while he was waiting for the lotion to be absorbed…
With scents as compatible as theirs, there was no way of knowing how his alpha would react to the omega’s presence once his rut had hit. But he simply couldn’t wait to find out.
Missing Dean something fierce, Cas had waited for his car to come back, and when he had finally heard it in the middle of the night, he had just wanted to see Dean, maybe wave at him goodnight to make some of the ridiculous pining his omega was doing go away.
Dean might have tensed up some because Cas said, voice low and cautious, “I’m sorry. Am I not doing this right?”
“Apparently, alphas make rut pacts with their friends all the time. I’ll help you out, you’ll help me out, doesn’t have to be a big deal.” He hadn’t been the first alpha to come up with this genius idea. According to some internet sites, it was a practice as old as ruts themselves.
Cas was utterly adorable. And he smelled as good as he looked, which should be illegal. Dean couldn’t believe he was lucky enough to get to fuck that cute little omega. And not just that, but fuck him through his heat without a rubber. He felt his alpha deep inside him stir at that thought.
Sam had told him time and time again that he had to be patient, though, so for now, he was content in Dean’s arms.
Castiel rolled his eyes. His apartment was close to Gabe’s shop, so it wasn’t unusual for his brother to come by, but whenever he did, he usually wanted something from him.
who could ask for permission, so he added, “I know that you’re a strong alpha and all. But can I just…”
After giving him a quick tour of the house, Dean offered him a beer, but just then, the doorbell rang.
So, Cas let go for now and instead scooted back up, but he was already looking forward to scenting the alpha down there some more once he was ready for it.
Jimmy turned around and sat up, putting some distance between Dean and himself. “Dean—what are you doing?”
Okay then. He had signed up for this rough fuck and could do nothing but hang on for the ride as he was getting plowed by Dean’s big cock that was splitting him open in all the best ways.
Castiel smiled brightly at Dean’s babbling. Now that he knew Dean hadn’t just spent the evening with another omega, he couldn’t think of a better way to end the night but by falling asleep next to the alpha.
“Just trying to make sure you’re not freaking out,” Dean mumbled, petulantly. That’s what he got for trying to be considerate. Well, and trying to make sure the situation didn’t take an embarrassing turn for him.
Mission ‘Get Cas deflowered’ hadn’t worked out so well, Dean mused once Cas had flown off once more and Dean was lying in bed, trying and failing to fall asleep.
They stood like that for a while, right there in the doorway, until Dean decided to take matters into his own hands and slowly walk Cas backwards into the house, closing the door behind them.
He could absolutely get lost in these sensations that scenting the pregnant omega elicited in him. This was his first pup, so he didn’t have any experience with these types of emotions, but he supposed this kind of reaction was natural for an alpha when in the presence of his knocked-up mate. Not that Cas was his mate, of course, but he
Sometimes, when he was lying on top of Cas, surrounded by the omega’s delicious scent, and they were lazily making out, the tingling feeling of mating hormones spreading through his body was hard to ignore. For the most part, Dean managed to ignore it. He did occasionally let his thumb brush against Cas’ mating gland, however, wondering if the change in Cas’ scent meant that the omega’s mating gland was busy producing the right hormones as well.
Cas was the one who had just asked for a scenting, and Dean had been looking forward to the next time ever since he had reluctantly let go of his scent gland.
Dean heaved a relieved sigh. Was that all? When Cas squinted at him, he quickly explained, “No, that’s… that’s normal. I kinda forgot to mention that, huh?” He rubbed the back of his neck. “It’ll come back.”
Even though they had only just met, there was some kind of implicit trust between them. Maybe because for once in his life, he didn’t have to pretend. He was just Castiel here, no expectations, no need to pretend that he didn’t have any baggage.
Dean grinned, sure he would win this argument. “Well, if we tell each other a bit about ourselves, we won’t be strangers anymore. Here, I’ll start.” He motioned for Cas to continue scenting, and once the omega’s nose was pressed to his scent gland once more, he began, “I’m an Aquarius. I’ve got a little brother Sammy, who goes to law school, and when I’m not making money letting omegas scent me, I’m a handyman and do all kinds of contract work.”
It might have been a curse with an expiration date. Dean might not have tried to masturbate or get off with another omega in a while and thus simply hadn’t realized that the curse was over and done with.
What every make out session needed was, of course, some stroking and holding, the alpha embracing the omega to show him that he was safe and cared for—so Dean did just that, letting his alpha instincts take over. Protecting the omega at all costs was definitely among the more base alpha instincts.
Dean smiled at him and leaned in to scent him some more. After all, Cas wasn’t in heat yet. They were still allowed to do that.
For a moment, everything seemed perfect. His stomach was fluttering for a whole other reason than fear—in the way it did when Dean was near, touching him.
Maybe it hadn’t been the kind of moan that meant Cas wanted to keep going. Maybe it had been an attempt to get Dean to stop. Either way, something had spooked Cas, and Dean realized a second too late that he had gone too far. He was dealing with a virgin angel here, after all. One who was just going into heat for the first time in his life, it seemed.
Of course, she rolls a 1 on her Deception check at the worst possible time. The perpetually alert Angel doesn’t miss a thing, easily peering over her head to take in the noisy, glittery tableau.
“You’re right. I allowed my anger to cloud my judgment. Stopping Lucifer has to take priority.” Castiel pauses. “However, that doesn’t mean that their crimes should go unpunished.” He goes unnaturally still again for a minute or so, then reaches toward Charlie, preparing for Angel Airways takeoff.
Charlie looks up from rummaging in her purse, clutching a Crown Royal bag. “I like to come up here when it’s warm enough and watch the fireflies. It’s a great place to think, ya know? Unwind. Very peaceful. Sometimes you can see shooting stars. Join me.” She gestures to the other chair and sits the cloth bag on the table.
“Hey, man.” the tall Black vamp fist bumps Diego over her shoulder. “I’ll tell you who that hunter bitch is, I figured it out.” he drawls. “That was Claire, one of the Winchesters’ people. I heard her on her phone talkin’  about somebody named Dean hookin’ up with someone named Castiel, and it clicked.”
“So, I was thinking that we could use the really zoomed-in one and get like a big ass poster made. Or maybe go to one of those crappy mall stands where they print shit on tee shirts and get one for everybody, like for Christmas or something!” The hunter shifts her footing just a little bit more and takes a deceptive step back to shift her weight just as the slavering vampire snatches at her arm with both hands. He catches the cuff of her flannel and angrily tears the sleeve off.
The Angel snorts. "My Father does not individually create humans. Which you should all be grateful for or your species would have died out when he lost interest. Nor is he going to rain anything down upon anyone. He would have to actually be present in this universe for that to happen.”
He looks at Charlie sadly. “Angels do not have funerals because Angels do not mourn. But I suppose I am not much of an Angel anymore, am I?”
“He’s found a case. I suspect he’s probably in his room. If you'd like, I can stop and ask him to join us and go ahead to start the coffee while you complete your morning ablutions.” says Castiel as he turns toward the door.
Amara stills, fork in hand as she pauses in the act of cutting into her pancakes. Motes of dust glitter in the sun. Maple syrup drips from her knife messily. Tinny bells and the ticking of the clock are the only sounds in the unnatural stillness until the coffeemaker gives another steamy belch. Just as suddenly as they stilled, the two figures start moving again.
Dean chimes in with “No can do, my Queen. This shit doesn’t look good and we need you here pronto. Cas’ll come pick you up in a sec.”
“Because I win Bobby. I told you it was gonna happen, and you were all no way Rufus, ain’t gonna happen. But I was right! Ha. I WAS RIGHT! It happened just like I said it was gonna happen and I WANT MY WHISKY!” He points his finger at Bobby, shaking it furiously to emphasize his point.
Crowley sighs. Another day, another round of contracts to review. If anyone had told him how boring eternal damnation could be, he may have made different life choices. Forget about racks and boiling oil and pincers and knives; nothing was more torturous than a never-ending sea of papers to be read, initialed and sorted. He desperately needs a half dozen new secretaries to take care of some of this bullshit.  Pondering the possibilities for expanding his staff, the King of Hell wanders over to his throne. Just as he sits down to have a good think, the incongruous strains of “Ding Dong the Witch is Dead” trill through Hell’s Throne Room, wrecking his concentration and his somewhat good mood. Wonderful. This is exactly what he needs to take today from bad to worse: his mother.  The annoyed demon considers blowing off the call, but he knows that’s folly. He has to hand it to her. Rowena is at least putting in the effort to show a modicum of politeness by calling him instead of just summoning him – which would be her next move if he failed to take her call. With another gusty sigh, the King of Hell begrudgingly answers the phone.
Angels are made for love. They immediately recognize it, and they feel it differently than humans or other sentient creatures. The biggest difference is in the fact that human love is changeable, something that humans can fall in and out of. Angels cannot do that. Single-minded worship and obedience are baked into their basic recipe from the moment of their creation. Devotion is their purpose.  It's natural for an angel to dedicate their time and effort to the benefit of one exceptional being. As Castiel has done with Dean since he first laid a hand on him in Hell. He felt the bond form with his charge immediately. The constant infusions of Grace that he used to revitalize Dean's ravaged soul in the way out of the Pit only deepened it. Dean became his everything. With Dean in his arms, touching his wings, it's a simple matter for Castiel to extend his Grace along the established pathway to Dean's soul and nurture it again. He enjoys the way that it brightens and dances when it is suffused with his grace.
“Do we know which one bottomed? I hear there are wagers out on that too. Not that I’d be involved in that sort of sordid business.” Crowley inquires as he scrolls through the group chat conversation taking screenshots just in case. You never know when something can disappear, and those photos are pure gold.
Gabriel cackles and snaps his fingers again. The music seamlessly transitions into Rhianna’s “Bitch Better Have My Money”. He begins to do a horrifying rendition of the chicken dance.
“Now? Like right now? No way!” Charlie’s voice rises with shrill panic. “What the fuck, Winchester? I’m at a Pride parade, hip-deep in all 7 deadly sins! You can’t send an Angel of the Lord here! I’ll go back to my friend’s place and he can meet me there, or in a church or something. There’s a really nice cathedral around the corner. I’ll call you when I....”
"You did not "make a move" on me last night either, beloved. I was the one who initiated our intimacy. I believe I also did the majority of the moving." Castiel smiles back. Dean leans forward and kisses him.
“What the devil do you mean, Mother? Did one of your spells go wrong? Not quite wrong enough because you’re still alive but we’ll overlook that...”
It's just a quick press of lips. Nothing like the passion of last night. But Castiel knows that if he was a human and could generate a heaven, this would be the moment that directed his eternity. Finding out that Dean was interested in him as a partner had been delightful. Kissing, touching, making love; those were memories that he’d cherish forever and replay a thousand times in the years to come. Joining his Grace to Dean’s soul had been transcendent. But nothing could even come close to the pure joy of finally achieving one of his greatest dreams: holding Dean the whole night through, chasing away his nightmares, guarding him as he slept and gently welcoming him into a new day that they will be spending together. If the angel still prayed, he would promise his Father anything if he could have this forever.
‘Wait, nobody told you exactly what happened to your freaking twin? You’d think someone would extoll the virtues of their "honorable death" in their eulogy. That’s bullshit!” Charlie exclaims in sympathetic indignation.
Thankfully a lifetime of hunter training kicked in, enabling Sam to recover before he even knew what he was doing. Sam automatically started moving again, silently returning the door to the position where he’d found it and stealthily retreating at top speed into the kitchen. Even though it was only noon, Sam snagged a beer out of the fridge, popped off the top and housed it without pausing for breath. Grabbing a second one, he collapsed onto a kitchen stool as his brain replayed what he had just witnessed on loop.
Showing off her bloody arm seems to have worked exactly the way she wanted. The vamp looks crazed like he’s ready to do something dumb. Just as she planned. Sure enough, the vampire charges at her again, this time lower as he tries to knock her down. She pivots smoothly just as he reaches her, but he catches her with a claw again, this time in the shoulder.
“Well, they did spell your name in some pretty strange ways in the old books that I was reading online, maybe you didn’t get the memo?” says Charlie lightly.
Charlie sits back and takes Castiel’s hand. “It’s not your fault, Cas. You didn’t do anything wrong. I should have expected Dean to switch into asshole mode when he heard that we’d come from Pride. I’d gotten so used to living in my own little comfortable hunter-nerd bubble that I forgot about that possibility.”
“I promptly collected the bottle of rich brown goodness I was owed from that fine establishment and then motored my ass over here for the other one. The other bottle I’m owed. Because you lost and I win!” He taps his toe impatiently.
“Uh-huh. Whatever. I’m not distracted! Yes, I’ve got a first aid kit, mother. You’re not changing the subject Alex.” she grouses, shaking the blood off her machete hand.
And Gabriel takes the bait. Game, set, match. Perfect. “Of course,” says Balthazar. He takes a seat at the table and peers into his empty glass. Balthazar gestures at the archangel who promptly snaps to restart time so that his brother can order a fresh drink. The devious angel mentally congratulates himself on his cleverness as he flags down a waiter. Smiling, he turns back to his brother. “Let’s talk terms, shall we?”
Chuck blinks, shaking his head in surprise. He sits his utensils down on his plate, shocked out of eating. Just for a blink, the expression on his face is wild and terrifying. “What the fuck! Little Castiel and Dean Winchester. How did I not see that coming? I mean, I did, but I didn’t...” God trails off, shaking his head again and fiddling with his silverware.
“That cannot be true.” the Angel shakes his head definitively. “Even if Dean is not put off by the shape of my vessel, he still doesn’t like Angels.”
“Yes, I was speaking with my brother. Regrettably, I am unable to punish the blasphemers at this time due to our previous engagement with Lucifer and the current impending apocalypse. However, I'm certain that my brother Gabriel will enjoy taking care of them. He's probably already here somewhere.” Castiel smiles, his eyes crinkling with mirth. “Are you ready to go?”
“Dammit, Dean! You couldn’t at least TRY to make it look like you gave a shit about our agreement? For fuck’s sake.” Sam muttered darkly as he headed toward his brother’s bedroom.
“Aww, too slow. Maybe you shouldn’t play with your food, asshole!” she yells. Glancing down, Claire is happy to note that the bleeding has slowed from her arm. That wound might be a little deeper than she thought. Nothing she can do about it now.
“There's my angel. Nah, sweetheart, this ass is off the market!” Dean says theatrically, smacking his own ass for emphasis. He needs coffee, but he needs clothes for coffee, and they weren't being too careful about where they threw them last night. Dean begins to look for his clothes and notices the destruction.
He’s not surprised because it's Gabriel, but he is mildly alarmed. Gabriel is doing a jerky, jumping dance that he last saw at a wedding in Mesopotamia. His skills have not improved. The Archangel wiggles his outstretched hand and his eyebrows in different directions at the same time while continuing to commit outrageous crimes against dance.  It’s mildly nauseating. And Balthazar knows exactly why Gabriel is here.
Castiel blushes and looks away again. Closing his eyes he concentrates for a few moments, then snaps his fingers. Everything but the lightbulbs and the glass in the picture frames instantly repairs to its normal state. The bed is made and there's a vaguely piney scent in the air. "I'm sorry, Dean. I lost control of my wings. And my voice. I may have vaporized some of the thinner glass. I'll replace the broken items as soon as I can get to a store."
“A million fucking years and you still haven’t stopped being Daddy’s Perfect Angel. You’re such a loser, brother.” Lucifer smiles nastily, playing a Red Draw 2. “Draw two.”
“I know, and he’d be the first person to fuck somebody up for giving us shit. But emotions like fear don’t make sense. They just are, and they suck to deal with.” Charlie muses. “How did you find out, Cas?”
“I’m sorry, you will not be able to meet them, Charlie, although they would enjoy your company. Balthazar used to joke that between the two of us Cassiel got more than their fair share of the sense of humor, and I got more than my fair share of the stubbornness.” Castiel chuckles slightly.
Charlie makes an odd, squashed squeaky toy kind of noise, beer spurting out of her nose as she looks at Castiel incredulously. Hold the goddamn phone... “So, you’re sowing your wild oats, and no one thought to call me to help you scope out some ladies? I can't believe those assholes didn’t mention that to me the last time we were out at the bar together; I could have been your wingman!” she sputters, splashing more beer in her indignation.
Claire perches haphazardly on a piece of broken wall, half sitting and half leaning. She would strangle one of those gross witches with her bare hands right now for a cold beer. But that’s not in the cards, so she whips her Juul out of her bra and takes a long drag. She may be more responsible about hunting these days, but that doesn’t mean she’s given up all of her rebellious ways. The skinny blonde tries to shrug some of the soreness out of her shoulders. Claire takes another hit and exhales heavily, leaning her head back to stretch. Besides, the nicotine helps keep her awake and less hungry. She doesn’t hit the THC cartridges until after the hunt. Rolling her head on her neck, Claire contorts her spine a bit to stretch out her back. She has no fucking idea how Sam and Dean just drive from one job to the next without breaks in-between for recovery. By the time she’s done with one heavy fighting hunt, she needs at least a weekend to be able to move right again and she’s half their age. Shit, she already has a trick left knee and arthritis in her right hand. Having an angel on hand was probably the secret. Pushing a hank of blonde hair out of her eyes, she reaches back into her bra and fishes out her phone. Claire scrolls idly for a minute. Then suddenly her eyes light up and she lets out a snort. She throws her hands up and does a little stomping dance, trying very hard to keep her laughter silent. Today just took a hard right turn into awesome.
“You’re referring to the incident earlier today,” Cas blinked up at him steadily, frowning the longer Dean continued to stand there.
And then, with disbelief clouding his judgment and worry pressing urgency into his fingertips, Dean reached a hand out to cradle Cas’s face, thumb brushing scar tissue as he asked, “You really can’t feel anything?”
The room shriveled in the stillness that followed, tearing Dean apart, and the amulet returned to its drawer in the same state it left it in: lifeless and dark.
” Sam sighed, but there was an odd hitch of embarrassment in his voice that had Dean grinning into the phone’s receiver. “
“Yeah, one week with zero progress. Not a single friggin’ peep from that head of his. I mean what the hell’s going on? Where’s Jack?”
Not only was his trench coat gone, but his suit and tie were too. He was even wearing tennis shoes, these ancient looking things that had dried mud stuck to the laces and a rip at the toes. Dean could see all the way through to Cas’s socks.
Not even this Cas could deny Dean anything. His resolve sprang away, honesty winning over, and Cas looked at Dean as if that was his only way of steering clear, his mind flickering back and forth between dusted polaroids of time.
He wanted to ask what was happening so badly. Dean could see it, like a shock in his system, a rush of understanding that made him inhale sharply through his nose and lean into the hand on his face, the hand Dean refused to move.
“You guys all have different skills? I thought you all just flitted around dispensing justice and rescuing kittens from trees.” The redhead reaches over and refills their glasses.
New Orleans has indeed been the ruin of many a poor boy who ran afoul of hunters. Good thing information is currency.
“That sounds delightful, Charlie. Just pray to me when you arrive, and I will join you.” Castiel smiles too.
“Where the hell have you guys been? I sent you to fly her back, Cas, not walk!” Dean exclaims indignantly as Castiel and Charlie walk into the war room. The table is covered with the detritus of a research project gone wrong. Piles of moldering books, at least three maps, a stack of parchment, dozens of paper balls, a sea of chewed on pens, two laptops, a half-dozen empty coffee cups and a rune-carved human skull with a candle melted on top of it vie for space.
“You’re already dead, Bobby!” Rufus throws up his hands in disgust with Bobby’s logic. “And I’m not hiding under anybody’s bed. I've got more class than that.”
But when Cas reached out a hand to Dean’s shoulder, the first time in his eyes but the millionth time for Dean— Dean thought he might just unravel anyway. It would be easy with the way Cas was looking at him, easy with how Dean’s heart chose to sky-rocket into the stratosphere and how fast the warmth behind his eyelids became painful to keep at bay.
Sam seemed to finally come back to himself at Dean’s request, blinking out of his stupor to look at Dean with years worth of understanding. A decade worth of approval that made Dean fluster up and turn away with something like relief shuttering through his next exhale, hands clenching and unclenching by his sides.
“Dean,” Sam’s tone turned serious, those eyes of his softening just enough for Dean to feel his shoulders deflate. “When are you gonna tell me what’s really going on?”
“You—” Sam reached up and stopped when he felt blood brush his fingertips, a faint trickle leaking from both nostrils. He fixed his brother with a glare and said, “What the hell, Dean?”
Dean shook his head and inched forward, moving until he was sitting at the very end of Cas’s bed with his hands in his lap. He didn’t miss the way Cas stiffened. He just chose to ignore it.
“It’s not,” She agreed plainly, a fact she’d clearly accepted a long time ago. “But I know Sam, and I know you, and watching your best friend forget everything he’s ever known isn’t something you take lightly. Am I close?”
Castiel squinted at him. “Keeping it could be useful. Some angels might not even recognize me if I grow it out longer.”
“Beam me up, Scotty,” Dean said, closing his eyes, and with a cold press of skin and a jolt of time and space, the world shifted, and the foundation beneath him became a plain of glistening black.
“What case, Dean?” Sam asked tiredly, giving in to that urge, that need to be honest with Dean in the hopes that it made it easier for him to be honest with himself. “We both know there’s nothing in this town that needs killing.”
Dean clenched his jaw. His eyes dashed away, avoiding someone that wasn’t even there. He could feel Sam staring at him from his right, painfully patient.
This wasn’t even a choice. Dean knew that; but the pressure was on and he felt sick to his stomach as he left to get dressed, just the sight of his own bedroom again making his head blare. He took the gun he kept under his pillow, and continued on, checking the rounds as he made his way back to the war room.
Cas hadn’t known about Dean’s list of movies he wanted the two of them to watch, or the food he wanted to make him, or how he preferred having Castiel in the backseat of the Impala simply because it was easier to sneak glances at him that way.
Sam was typing frantically on his phone when Dean stepped out into the hallway. Dean tried raising his eyebrows at him, wanting to know what was up, but Sam quickly slipped the phone back into his pocket, giving Dean a guilty smile.
Dean pressed the phone closer to his ear and trudged his way through the rain. The chime of the diner’s bell as he pushed his way through the front door was sharp and ear splitting, the damn thing rusted to high hell. Dean was almost certain he’d witness it snap and fall to the floor by the time he made it out of there.
“I'm going to continue sitting on your car now." Cas announced slowly, voice plain and dry, and a panicked laugh bubbled up from Dean's chest at the sight of Cas crawling back up the hood.
Dean tapped his knuckles against the steering wheel, searching for some semblance of steady ground. “Well, someone sure screwed the pooch on that one.”
From the look on his face, he wanted Dean to know that their conversation wasn’t over yet, that this wasn’t something he could avoid. But for once, Dean wasn’t trying to.
“What’s so funny?” Cas asked, eyes moving frantically just to watch Dean’s face as he laughed and struggled, body bowing forward, leaning back.
“I, um,” Cas swallowed thickly, feet staggering back and forth. He didn’t know where to look, eyes darting between Dean and the opposite wall. “My shirt isn’t cooperating, as it seems.”
“Well, I…” Jack tilted his head, glancing towards Sam with uncertainty. Immediately, Sam gave him an encouraging nod, lips curling fondly, and Jack lit up from the inside out. “Yes,” He smiled, baring his teeth like a child. “I’m the claw machine.”
” Dean answered in the library, words thick and garbled around the pie layered in his teeth. “Anyone with opposable thumbs can make some piss poor apple pie, but pecan? That takes love, Cas. A whole lotta love—”
And it’s insane just how fucking weird it really is. Dean calling Cas on some new number from the other side of the bunker, too afraid to go out and leave a Cas that wasn’t even his.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas greeted lightly, head popping into view. He winced a little as he climbed into the car and blindly reached back for his seatbelt.
“It’s been days, Cas,” Dean sighed, the usual bags under Castiel's eyes impressively dark, the age in them endless. When Cas didn’t respond, Dean softened, feet moving all on their own until he was sitting next to Cas and asking, “Scared you’ll have nightmares?”
Slowly, Dean gathered a piece of cloth in hand and moved to dab some of the blood away. He was careful, more careful than he’d been with Sam in years when it came to hunting wounds, but the contact alone had Cas flinching away as if struck, lips curling as his head dropped. Cas trembled through a noise at the back of his throat; it was quiet, restrained, but Dean could tell from a mile away that he was white knuckling.
Dean laughed into the curve of Cas’s cheek, drawing him closer by slinging an arm around the back of his neck. It was bizarre how easy it was for him to accept this, fall into this dream come true as though he’d been living his truth since day one, but Dean took it in stride.
“Cas,” He said, and it was like breaching water with the way his lungs gasped, fighting against the weight of it. “I didn’t… I didn’t mean what I said about the—”
“We’ve agreed to much worse with a lot less,” He said wistfully. “We’re lucky to even have him back at all. If he wasn’t here, Dean would still be—”
His mouth didn’t move and his body remained frozen, but Dean felt his own lungs gasp for air, expanding in their need for more. His pulse was flaring wildly, hot beneath his skin, and he looked at Sam to find his brother sitting rigid in his chair, his feet pushed out in front of him as though he’d been seconds away from bolting towards Dean.
Sam froze at the other end of the room, his hand still curled up beneath the shade of the lamp he’d just flicked on. Wordlessly, he turned it back off, and darkness flooded the room once again. Eileen swam through the shadows, her figure reaching over to brush soft fingers over the back of Sam’s arm.
The amulet still felt the same as it always had in the cusp of Dean’s palm. It burned cold when Dean snatched it from the bottom of the drawer, and the tarnished metal still grated against the grooves of his thumb when he brushed over the surface.
“Hey,” Dean was shocked by how quickly Cas fell silent, blue eyes flocking to him for answers. Dean tried swallowing through the intimacy of it, but nothing seemed to help. It didn’t make him want to kiss Cas any less. “I’m not letting you out of my sight, you hear?”
Dean was sweating through his suit by the time they reached the end of it, eyes wild and feverish, darting past Sam and around corners as though he expected the entire place to evaporate right in front of him.
A small part of Dean hoped Cas wouldn’t notice the touching, how self-indulgent it all was. But a larger part of him wanted Cas to call him out on it, to spring up a conversation that could possibly shift whatever puzzle piece out of place in Cas’s head back where it belonged.
He didn’t make a move to stop. Cas simply kept working at the tricky shape of his chin as he asked, “Were you always this inquisitive and I’ve forgotten? Or is this a recent development?”
and his cause— but Sam knew better than to draw attention to the cracks in her lies, the obvious shift in her very being. Sam could appreciate it quietly.
“You’re hurt,” Castiel breathed, right into Dean’s skin, and Dean felt it course through him like a waveless current, soaring to the tips of his fingers and the depths of his heart.
The shake in his voice was telling enough to have Cas shutting up completely, eyes big and worry-filled even as his lips clamped together. He had a hard time meeting Dean’s gaze, every brief start of eye contact ending in the same hasty turn of his head and clench of his jaw.
“His grace glows in a sea of black, and screams in utter silence,” Jack gave Sam and Dean careful looks. “It shouldn’t be hard to find. Once you have it, all you need to do is pray to me, and I’ll pull you out.”
Dean turned his blinker on and looked over his shoulder as he switched lanes, throat tightening in a single breath. The hole in his chest grew bigger, louder, everything inside of him screaming out all at once.
“We can’t let you shower alone with a concussion, and I’d doubt you’d want me in there supervising,” Sam raised his eyebrows at the both of them.
“I wouldn’t want us to get interrupted,” Lundy sneered. “You Winchester’s sure know how to send out a bat signal don’t you?” He said dryly, slipping into an easy grin as his fingers curled into the back of Castiel’s hair. “Thanks to you, I finally got the jump on Feathers here.”
Dean swallowed back the urge to cry; this pitiful little creature at the back of his throat that had probably been there for weeks now, dormant and waiting.
“Fine,” Cas shrugged, but he flinched through the movement and stopped, grimacing. Dean stared at him for a moment longer.
“No that— that’s not what I meant I just—” Dean stared ahead at the road, mortified. “I didn’t mean to wake you, is all.”
Only Cas didn’t seem to think he’d get this far, and for a few dragging seconds he couldn’t think of a response.
“Dean,” He was close to pleading now, eyes shimmering, voice swept low, and Dean stared back with a helplessness that was demanding him to reach out. “Please.”
Sam shrank back, a sweet sort of skittishness flashing across his face. He gave Dean one of those smiles of his, something about the shape of it worn soft and smoothed over, budding with quiet acceptance.
Dean opened the fridge door too quickly, the bulk of it rearing back to slam against his hip bone. His hands were trembling.
like something straight out of a chick flick, and for once, Dean didn’t mind the idea of him being the lead girl as long as it was Cas who was sweeping him off his feet.
“Then that’s even more of a reason to get you the hell out of Dodge and fast. Tell me where you are.” Dean said, making sure to listen carefully even as he chucked a couple shirts and a pair of jeans into his bag, searching for underwear.
For the first time that night, Eileen’s expression wavered. Her gaze settled tensely on Dean’s mouth, making sure she was understanding him right, and her eyebrows arched in a way that made her look helpless with emotion.
Dean clasped the amulet desperately, allowing the chill of the metal to press relief into the wallowing heat of his shaking hands. There were stories behind this amulet; the entire lifetimes of two boys fighting to live and to feel deserving of the air it took to
“No, that’s not it,” Sam argued, frustrated enough to finally start glaring. “I’m talking about hunting. Ever since we found out Chuck’s been running the show you’ve been different. Angrier. Not just because we were being controlled, but because you knew that if we didn’t defeat Chuck, you would never get a chance at what you’ve always wanted.”
When the waitress finally brought both slices out to their table, Dean pushed his aside without a second thought, full attention on Cas. Dean watched with bated breath as Cas took his first bite, jaw moving carefully.
Dean collapsed into bed the moment he was inside, and the pain to his head was immediate, burning between his ears and crackling down his spine. He choked out a groan into the pillow and rolled over, an arm thrown across his eyes.
as they had made their way out of the hospital and fumbled into the car, Cas tripping into the back seat face first, groaning in pain as they sped off before the police could show.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel said, and Dean knew it wasn’t just for his dad. Even this Cas would think John Winchester was an asshole if Dean really got into it.
Sam shrugged, hands hovering over the keys of his laptop. “I think there’s a possible case over in Ohio. A few people have gone missing—”
Claire no longer held herself with a persona meant to be feared. She didn’t preen with defiance or stand with bloodied fists, simmering with a pain driven anger that erupted the second it was touched. Dean knew better than anyone what that looked like, and even from just a glance, Dean could tell that she wasn’t living just to prove that she could. She wasn’t that kid anymore.
“Yes, I’ve grown to like the sound of them. I found this in that drawer my first night here,” He gestured helpfully as he spoke, smiling tiredly but genuine. “I’m assuming it’s yours?”
He inhaled shakily. “Cut the self-pity crap, Sam. Get pissed! This is Cas we’re talking about, we’re— we’re not just gonna leave him there to rot.”
Somehow, even now, there was something holding him back. A soul threaded fear, mind numbing anguish. These things weren’t easy for Dean. They never would be.
and it hurt so fucking badly, everything ached and pulsed and throbbed and sobbed— but it didn’t matter.
There was still a sense of fear in his eyes, his life hanging in the balance, but there was an odd spark of stubbornness too. A refusal to just lay over and die that had Dean staring in shock as Cas’s fingers twitched, the curled fist at his side loosening to reveal a shard of glass held in the depths of his palm.
An infinite year old being who had witnessed space from the heavens, seen galaxies erupt and bloodlines run dry was telling Dean that he’d rather be riding shotgun with him than creating stars. And for once Dean was listening.
“Get out of there, Cas,” He said, voice breaking with it, fingers creaking against the hold he had on the doorframe, and Dean couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt this afraid except that it had probably been in this room, in this moment that felt just like the last.
“You’ve managed longer without me, buddy,” Dean said, because it was true, and he couldn’t afford to look too closely at the hitch in Castiel’s breath.
Dean didn’t understand what was happening; why Cas had been tip-toeing one edge or another all week or why his smile had seemed to disappear right into him, seeping beneath skin. Nothing made sense even when everything felt right, and the way Cas was looking at him had Dean’s heart rising and racing and
He could sit and listen to Cas laugh and answer his questions because his voice was the same but all this smiling was new— and Dean could go on with the notion that in a few years time they’d be right back where they were. They could still be the same people who had chosen each other over the world, and the love might be different and Cas’s hands might not linger on Dean like they used to— palms burning over skin, fingers stretching to steal a touch— but at least there would be
Dean froze, hands falling uselessly to his sides. There was a heartbeat in his throat suddenly, a broiling singe in his cheeks. Cas stared at Dean curiously, almost like they weren’t nose to nose, breathing each other’s air. His gaze flickered between Dean’s features aimlessly, blue meeting green in a heated look that seemed to stretch for eternity.
From the opposite doorway, Eileen appeared. She stepped into the tension-heavy room, her hair thrown up and her feet still bare from sleep. She took one look at them, her eyes burdened as she landed on Castiel, and said, “You’re going there now?”
Cas had known? That had never even been a possibility to Dean, not one time had he entertained the thought that there was more than just one coward in their equation.
Sam and Dean looked at each other from over the roof of the car, locking eyes simultaneously. Eileen stared wildly as they broke at the same time. Their laughter blended, knocking through the air in high and low, soft and ruthless, and it drifted through open windows down I-79 as the three of them sped their way towards Kansas soil.
Dean didn’t bother giving him a countdown. He steadied Sam with both hands, felt for the telltale patch of hollow skin to know what he was aiming for, and pushed—
and it didn’t matter, because Dean had been dreaming about this for years and god be damned if a little inexperience was going to stop his heart from pounding or his face from glowing bright red by just having Cas whimper against his mouth.
“I’m just gonna, uh,” Sam pointed towards the hallway behind him, giving Dean a knowing look. “Yeah, I’ll be out here.”
No response. Not a single peeking mess of dark hair over the seat. Dean let out a breath, hands tightening on the wheel before slipping further down, gripping it at the bottom.
Dean startled at Sam’s bluntness, the impact of it forcing his head down and his gaze elsewhere. He could feel Castiel’s eyes on him, steady and discerning, watching the way Dean discreetly picked at his nail bed down by his thigh. Dean could tell he wanted to reach out. Dean wanted the same.
No one had ever said that to Dean before. No one had ever felt that way about Dean before, not even Sam. For Sam it was a given; Dean was all he knew, all he’d ever known, and he’d be stuck with him long after death. But this— Cas was different.
“Oh believe me it does. Keeps me up at night,” Dean replied, grinning when he noticed Castiel caught onto his sarcasm; his expression flickered with annoyance.
He turned to blink at Dean once he’d clicked the metal latch into place, tugging loosely at the strap across his chest. He was clearly expecting a reply, and Dean startled when he realized, straightening up and deflating all at once, face suddenly burning.
If things were fine and he was allowed and this was really Cas staring back at him, joking in that clueless way of his that in Dean’s perfect world would be followed with Dean kissing him stupid, Cas kissing
A conversation started up eventually. Cas read out the ingredients on the back of the Nutter Butter package with squinty eyes, helplessly intrigued, and Dean listened with a smile on his face, oddly at peace when the topic of peanut butter came up like it was the most interesting thing in the world.
Dean wondered whether Cas was staring back at him or not, making the sort of connection he’d seemed to struggle to make with Dean.
years, and those years were spent training me to kill you. She knew you would try to get in the way of her getting her hands on the angel tablet, and so she created these... simulations, lookalikes, and had me kill them. Had me kill
“Don’t worry about me,” Castiel said sharply, pushing past the topic as fast as possible. “How’s Sam?”
Dean smiled wide and obnoxious, forcing Cas to sigh. It was almost like the old Cas, the way he looked exasperated and stretched thin until the moment his eyes followed the tilt of Dean’s mouth. Then, those eyes were crinkling around the corners with a shameful fondness he forced away immediately, and Dean was left blinking in a stupor.
Almost like he wasn’t upset that he’d managed to scrape the entire left side of his face off, the skin that
“Yeah,” Cas breathed, heady and warm, a ghost of pressure against Dean’s lips that made Dean stutter around nothing but air. “You’re… you’re very important to me. My favorite person in the world actually.”
Dean had so many questions. Ever since that night, ever since Cas had been swept up and taken away still crying, still
It was impossible not to notice. Just like it was impossible not to hope, Dean’s heart jolting in his chest, eyebrows raising marginally the moment Castiel turned away.
That look, the very same one, still just as rippling and capable of making Dean’s heart tremble in his chest.
” Claire scolded, clearly able to tell what Dean had done, and that just didn’t settle right with Dean; damn her for knowing him so well.
One second, Castiel was floating. Stoking through fire and light and feather-black blood— and in the next, he found himself thrown back on a patch of grass that cut fresh pain into his elbows. He spun through distortion, a river thrashing in his stomach. It felt like years until his vision finally stopped rattling, and he stared up at a sky that hadn’t known he was coming.
“Right, right,” Dean cleared his throat, struggling. “Well, you know me I—” He faltered, throat itching at his own words, uncertain whether they were even true anymore. Cas looked like he wanted to say something, words barely held back on the crest of his lips, but he stayed quiet, eyes never leaving Dean’s until he straightened up and finally said, “There’s never a better place than right here. Home.”
Holding onto his hand, to be specific. But Dean was doing his best to brush over that fact with a level mind, putting his eyes anywhere but Cas. It wasn’t fucking working. Dean’s heart rate was building by the second, his legs becoming these helplessly jittery things that made acting natural seem impossible, sweat beading along his brow.
“I ain’t the one wearing insect pants, Cas,” Dean pointed out, nudging Cas’s leg. He grew quiet when he noticed Castiel come to a full body halt, his razor hovering in the air just inches away from the left side of his chin. Right where smooth skin met raised scar tissue. Slowly, Dean said, “I was wondering when or how you were gonna deal with… that.”
“So, very different from you then,” Castiel said, and it’s familiar, everything about him is familiar.
If Cas would have just turned, looked, then he would have seen how fucking in love Dean was. How enamoured, and maybe he would have even realized that it had been that way for years. Ever since Castiel laid a hand on him in hell, restoring Dean from nothing but a few burnt out nerves and strips of flesh into something whole and real and capable of feeling so goddamn much.
And there was just enough tenderness in his voice for Dean to think, not for the first time, that he couldn’t do this. He couldn’t take being this close to Cas when he knew how things were going to end. But there’s always been a fight in Dean, justified or not, and the only thing Dean wanted more than to give up, was to give in.
It felt different to look at them now with Cas standing just a few feet away. Dean was used to feeling happy for them, so goddamn grateful that some days he thought maybe that was enough. Maybe he could live with only Sam being happy in the end. Dean would just learn to live with the ache that gathered in his chest, the ease in which they moved and came together making him
“Difficult, yes. But not impossible,” Castiel smiled, eyes turning curious and mirthful, possessed with a sort of quiet endearment that only bloomed with color the second him and Dean met eyes in the dimming gold light. “What’s something you never told me, Dean?”
“I’ve never been capable of that,” Dean shook his head, adamant. “If you weren’t such a blank slate you’d know that I can’t do this without you.”
Sam and Dean exchanged a silent look, the pull of their eyebrows and the shape of their mouths enough of an indicator for them to understand what the other was thinking. Dean cleared his throat with a touchy smile, nothing from it reaching his eyes.
“Wipe your nose, man,” Dean grimaced, gesturing to Sam’s face with disdain. He patted at the inside breast pocket of his suit where his fake badge was. “We’re supposed to be professionals here.”
Room 29 was at the far East side of the hospital down a hallway that smelt like burnt plastic and cleaning supplies.
“Well damn, thanks for bringin’ the story, brother. Dean Winchester is a friend of mine, and I’m acquainted with his Angel, though he don’t like me too much.” Benny shakes his head ruefully.
“I believe we both left our phones on my desk." Suddenly, the angel recalls the series of camera phone clicks that he heard earlier. Sam had taken pictures of them in bed together. Was it customary for a brother to make some sort of memento of their sibling's first night in a new serious relationship? How did Sam know that they were going to continue their intimacy and make it "official?  Castiel tries (and fails) to figure out these strange quirks of Sam's behavior as he follows Dean to the door and out of the room. The angel is very glad that he and Dean had their previous conversation. He feels more confident about telling Dean about what they're going to be walking into next. "Speaking of your brother and phones, there’s something you should know...”
“Well fuck, I guess it really did happen. Son of a bitch. I’da never guessed it in a million years. Huh.” Bobby turns to Rufus and pats him on the shoulder. “I’ll go get yer whisky.”
"Holy shit. Did you get in a fight while I was asleep? I remember the lightbulbs blowing, but not the rest of this..." Dean marvels, shocked. He decides that instead of looking for his clothes, his dead guy robe will do in a pinch and grabs it from the bedpost. After all, this isn't the most destruction he's ever woken up to, which probably says a whole lot of things about his shitty life. Fuck it, they'll figure it out after coffee. Nothing will ruin his good mood today.
“I mean, I figured that with my luck, I’d have to put up with the UST for another 10 fucking years at least, ya know? But I never bet against it eventually happening. I know Dean.”
“I do not believe that he holds prejudice toward other non-humans, just Angels. I suspect that he may have engaged in relations with the vampire Benny in Purgatory, but I am not certain,” replies Castiel slowly.
For his last shot, he pauses and zooms in as close as he can without seeing anything too traumatizing. Sam almost drops his phone in shock when he finally sees the expression on his brother’s face. He hasn’t seen Dean look that relaxed and peaceful in years. Maybe since before Hell. This new development in Dean and Castiel’s relationship has been a long time coming, and it will be good for both of them. Sam is so happy for the two lovebirds that almost feel bad about sneaking the photos (and what he plans to do with them).
Then several things happen all at once. Sam grabs Dean’s arm, yanking him backward hard. Dean tries to shake him off, but pissed-off Sam’s iron grip holds. He looks down at his older brother, jaw set and ready for a fight.
“I don’t ‘spect we have been previously acquainted, sir. Nice to meet ya. I’m Hercules.” says the newcomer, shaking Benny's hand formally. Then a big grin breaks out across the old man’s face and his eyes come alive with excitement. He’s a consummate storyteller and he intends to enjoy this.
Castiel doesn’t laugh. In fact, he looks startled. “I suppose I am the angel of tears and temperance now, and the technical overlord of Earth’s moon. I have been derelict in my duty.” He muses, pensive. “Fortunately, Kings are rare in this era, and I am not going to be guarding anything in Heaven.”
Charlie coughs then spits water out like a fountain. “What the...Cas you can’t...did you just...holy shit...”. She bluescreens, frozen in surprise.
"We’re also taught that the Good Book says the gays are all going to Hell. God will come down all fire and brimstone upon us unless we find Jesus and pray the gay away.” Charlie says acid dripping from her voice. “And don’t even get me started on gender identity. It's a religious shitshow too. God made every one of us in His image as He meant us to be, and God doesn’t make mistakes. Etcetera.”
“Speaking of the Roadhouse I better grab that shotgun I owe Ellen. And the elf-made perfume for Jo in my study...” Bobby gets up.
Slowly, like he's dealing with a wild animal, he turns to Castiel, saying gently, “Oh, angel. Did you think I was gonna freak out cause Sammy saw us together? That I was gonna get mad at you, or try and pretend like nothing ever happened?"
“Oh shit! Dean’s gonna be so mad when he finds out that we drank this! I know he keeps it in his secret stash!’ Charlie gleefully starts opening the bottle. “Your
“Mother, to what do I owe the displeasure? Bored with sucking the life out of men, are we?” he drawls archly, eye-roll implied in every word. The King rises from his throne. Clearly, this conversation is going to require either alcohol or murder and he doesn’t feel like traveling right now. He’s not entirely sure that his mother can be killed anyway. Certainly not by normal means. Maybe an angel smiting...
“Dean, give it a rest, man, we’ve got work to do. Have your aggressively heterosexual meltdown later.” Sam says sharply, reaching for his brother’s shoulder.
“No, do not be sorry. Cassiel died a noble and worthy death following our Father’s commands against the Enemy. It is right to tell tales of them. There is no more honorable fate for an Angel.” Castiel looks down at his glass, swirling the amber liquid a bit. Lightning crashes, closer this time. The wind starts to pick up as clouds begin to gather.
The blonde hunter picks her way through the debris to check out the far wall where this vamp came from when she hears a door slam and a loud tattoo of ascending footsteps as someone runs upstairs. There must be servant's stairs in the kitchen or something.
“I’ll take my money in 10’s, please and thank you. Small bills are easier to spend in the places I hang out. Oh, you might want to get a second bottle of car wash stuff, my car is suuuuper nasty. And the bug stuff Dean showed us, it cooovered in bug guts.” Claire teases.
Claire keeps talking to herself quietly. It’s a habit she’s fallen into from flying solo most of the time. "I’ve got to get ahold of Kaia so we can make a list of all the shit we’re getting. And Patience, that bitch is gonna clean up. People are dumb as shit to bet against a psychic.” She starts typing furiously. Then a tell-tale clunk and squeak echo through the space. She stands up quickly and stows her phone back in her bra.
“And?” Dean yawns again rubbing his eyes and smacking his lips. He isn't looking at Castiel, but it isn't deliberate. As he sits up he stretches his right arm over his head to loosen up his shoulder. He's had to stretch out the stiffness in the morning ever since he tore his rotator cuff fighting a rougarou last winter. The hunter notices that it's regained a suspicious amount of flexibility, as has his back which is pretty much permanently fucked up. He wonders if this improvement stretches to his always-bum knees. Sex with an angel sure didn't cure his ills the last time, and he had way fewer back then.
Claire wipes her bloody hand on her equally bloody jeans in the entryway of a ruined bayou mansion where she’s cleaning out a vampire nest. As though the combination of Louisiana and vampires wasn’t cheesy enough, one of them was a little blonde girl. That was fucking creepy. She wasn’t expecting a nest this big. But she wasn’t unprepared. Claire had learned to be ready for the shit to hit the fan at any moment because as Dean so eloquently said, she had been cursed with Winchester luck by exposure. It was a good thing she was so paranoid too; she’d needed the full half dozen syringes of dead man’s blood in her trunk. And both machetes. Quick recon lets her know that there aren’t any bloodsuckers in her immediate area. Thank fucking God. She’s killed 3 vampires in the last hour and she needs a break. Especially since one of the fuckers was little and fast. Claire wishes that just once she could find a slow-moving vampire. Plus, it’s like a thousand degrees in this shithole and so humid it reminds her of the rainforest exhibit at the zoo.
Yep, Dean would do everything he could to save that omega and give him his happiness back. That’s what he did. That’s why he loved his job.
He could feel as he was coming off the adrenaline from everything, starting with Mike’s text message and ending with having strange alphas in his house, even if they were there to protect him.
Apparently, Cas was okay with getting blowjobs. That’s what Dean had figured out from… well, getting blown by Cas. Who knew what else he was game for.
God, how he wanted to fill his hole with his come! Only there was this stupid rubber between them, preventing him from doing so. He had always used condoms and never had he felt inconvenienced by them. Until now, when all he wanted was to feel Cas’ tight channel grip his naked cock, feel his dick slide through his slick with nothing between them.
Time to give that omega a bath. If that meant he’d get his hands all over Cas’ smooth, slippery skin—well, it sounded like a win-win to him.
Plus, for some reason, he found alphas with foot in mouth syndrome frustratingly endearing, and Dean’s babbling in an attempt not to offend him had made Cas say yes to the suggestion of an ‘alphas’ night’ before he had thought it all the way through.
Luckily, his omega knew just the sounds to make—desperate little whimpers for more—that Dean knew what was up and gave him what his omega was unashamedly begging for.
“Why did you come alone then?” he asked, trying to twist his arm free of the alpha’s grip, but Bartholomew only tightened his hold on him in return.
Being the nerd he was, Cas would undoubtedly respond better to hard facts and numbers, so Dean hoped Sam would be able to provide him with enough evidence to make a convincing argument.
“This is a mating bite,” Castiel reiterated, motioning to his neck. “You mated me in that club. Now, this is rather uncomfortable for me, so I would appreciate it if you could lick it.” He bared his neck for Dean, which, even though he had done it before, was still a bit strange, especially now that he was doing it unprompted.
! Dean really had fucked a powerful orgasm out of him as evidenced by the huge amount of semen shooting out of his dick.
Now that he could really look at Dean, he realized that the alpha was just as good-looking as he was good-smelling. The red in his eyes had receded and made place for the most beautiful green that Castiel could just get lost staring at.
Cas looked away for a moment. When his eyes returned to Dean’s, he seemed unsure of himself, out of his depth.
“There has got to be a reason you brought me here,” Castiel pointed out. “I’m all powered-up. Do you want me to make another attempt at lifting the curse?”
Dean’s eyes widened in realization. “That’s why you were trying to keep your witch things from me!” And after a moment probably spent re-evaluating their interactions of the past 24 hours, he added, “‘My great-grandmother was a human,’ seriously?
The next thrust was deeper, harder, and it got a grunt out of Cas. His hole gripped Dean’s cock tight, which made Dean pick up the pace because that sweet friction of his cock gliding in and out of that slicked-up hole felt too good to resist.
He also couldn’t remember a time he had been more at peace with his alpha and the world. Satisfied and tired, this was the most relaxed he had ever been…
Castiel wasn’t quite sure why he was so angry. If he were rational about this, he might admit that he really couldn’t expect Dean to give up sex for the duration of their fake mating. But he didn’t feel like being rational right now.
To exactly no one’s surprise, Dean was alive, awake and full of energy the next morning. He couldn’t wait to show Cas.
That’s when he realized something else. Not only did his wings act in a way they never had before, but his ass felt weird too.
Somehow, they had made it to Dean’s bedroom, and while Castiel got rid of the rest of his clothes, the alpha grabbed a condom from the dresser by the side of his bed and rolled it on. He was obviously well prepared.
“Well, if it gets you to stop opening my mail…” Jimmy said, still without any inflection, but there was a smile tugging at the corner of his lips.
“I… your perfect mate.” Surely even Dean couldn’t have messed up Castiel’s carefully orchestrated meet cute.
Dean should really read through the whole book. See if there were any other suggestions for what the alpha should do to make sure the pup and his omega were well taken care of.
That didn’t keep Castiel from smiling whenever he saw their avatars hugging or holding hands, though.
“I guess your fake mating bite took?” Castiel touched his neck almost subconsciously as he told Dean what had happened at work today.
Dean sighed in relief. Crisis successfully averted. Of course, Cas’ delicious scent was still all over the apartment, but at least Cas himself wouldn’t smell like an invitation to bend him over the couch and have his way with him.
“No,” Cas lied like a bald-faced liar, hoping that Zachariah wouldn’t step foot in the bedroom, where he had left Dean.
But it was Sam who spoke up. “Good idea. I bet you’re tired after all the…” he trailed off with a vague hand motion.
Cas faltered in his steps. Dean might be talking about him. He was tempted to stop and listen, but Dean should be able to talk to his brother without having a nosy omega eavesdrop on their conversation. So, Cas quickly made his way to the bedroom, trying not to wonder about that sentence he had overheard.
A moment later, he could feel Dean’s come filling his belly once more, this time from the other end, as the alpha pushed in harshly one last time and knotted him.
Only Cas would be able to give him the squinty-eyed head tilt look while still being wrapped around him.
?! He wasn’t the best at human interactions, but even he usually got through a conversation without making a complete fool of himself. “I mean… I’ll help you. Do you remember the exact wording of the curse?”
He could be holding Jimmy in his arms right now in one of their nightly keeping-each-other-company sessions. Instead, Jimmy was one house away, mad at him for saying stupid shit.
That left him with the option of buying omega slick, which, according to some alphas in internet forums, would fool his alpha into believing he was fucking a real omega, thus making the rut manageable even if he spent if by himself.
He even tried a few spells, but without his magic, all he could rely on were instructions and ingredients, which made everything so much harder.
thing. Just that his stupid fake secondary gender designation was, well… fake. Then they could scent each other without Cas having to fear that Dean might scent something he wasn’t supposed to.
Cas barely managed to say, “Hello, Dean,” the alpha pulled him close and started scenting frantically, like he was starving for Cas’ scent.
Falling asleep was, of course, close to impossible. Castiel kept tossing and turning, and every time he tried to get his mind off of Dean, his thoughts just circled right back.
He gave Cas another cuddlibus kiss and then disentangled himself so that he could get out of bed. “Yeah, well,
At first, Cas tensed up yet again when Dean reached out to pull him into a hug. They were lying on Dean’s bed on top of the covers, and all the times Dean had imagined getting Cas into his bed—this wasn’t quite how he had pictured it. Yet, it was still so much better than he could have imagined it. Probably because it wasn’t just a fantasy, but reality.
He should probably say something. Make some kind of joke. Instead, he just stood there, his eyes dipping down to Jimmy’s neck of their own accord.
Dean’s favorite place to kiss was Cas’ hip when he sneakily pulled up the shirt a bit because Cas was ticklish and let out the most melodious giggle. He would squirm a little under Dean, but he’d also say, “Again!” when Dean was about to pull his shirt back down and leave his poor hip alone.
Something that had been gnawing at the back of his mind, finally took form. “Since when can a ghost steal a witch’s magic?”
That’s why 99.7 % of Castiel’s matches stayed married. Until death do them part. Or longer than that, actually, since most of them were looking forward to meeting each other again in heaven.
Cas was tilting his head again, which Dean had quickly realized meant that he was trying to make sense of some human particularity.
Dean’s confused frown told him that he didn’t understand what he was talking about, so he began reciting the nursery rhyme in the exact singsong voice his mother had always used, “
Dean tried very hard not to use the blanket to cover it up again. No sense in it now. The cat—or better, erection was out of the bag, as they said…
The heat simmering within him was settling down now that his alpha was doing to him what he was supposed to do.
The next second, Dean cleared his throat and extracted himself from the scenting position, reaching for his documents so that Castiel had no choice but to sit back up, too.
He spent most of the day looking over his shoulder, expecting Mike or his henchmen to show up at any second. By the end of the day, he was starting to think that maybe the FBI had it right after all and all the agitation had been for nothing.
Dean felt as if the ground had been pulled from under his feet. All the hope he’d felt on his way here… gone in an instant. He’d imagined Cas’ shy smile as he would say that yes, he would like Dean to stick around. This ‘time to go their separate ways’ bullshit? Wasn’t what he had expected
But he’d just made a huge mistake. No one got to threaten his Dean! He’d much rather sacrifice himself than let Dean get dragged down with him.
But he hadn’t been because, apparently, they had been on a date. No ulterior motives, no hunt, just a date…
Castiel licked him clean, satisfied that he had been able to lift the curse. Other parts of him weren’t as satisfied, though.
Of course, those instincts that were guiding Dean now would usually apply to an alpha trying to soothe an omega. But luckily, it seemed to work on Jimmy as well, who calmed down almost instantly.
Dean had to have realized what was going on, too, and his hand cautiously joined Cas’. There, another movement.
Except that he did. Not because his life wasn’t fulfilling without an alpha or some dumb reason like that. But unfortunately, you still needed an alpha to make a pup. That’s what the birds and the bees were all about. Or the knots and the slick.
Dean decided to stop teasing him for now, even if making the omega blush was kind of fun. Instead, he said, “Okay, if you don’t approve of my choice of books, let’s get back to the scenting—but let’s at least not sit here in silence.”
“Cas,” Dean started. “Being fake mated to you has been… It’s been real. I mean, not ‘real’ obviously, but… Damn. My speech sounded a lot smoother in my head. Anyway, for me, it
During the next days and weeks, it became clear that spending Cas’ pregnancy heat together had changed their relationship. Since they had kissed and spent the night together during the omega’s pregnancy heat, there was really no reason to stop now. So, from then on, Dean would spend the night whenever he didn’t have to get up too early.
Sam didn’t condone Dean’s solution (ignoring it) and somehow, he’d managed to persuade him to go see a doctor about it. That’s how he had learned about biological clocks that were totally a thing for alphas too. Apparently, his alpha was out of control because he’d never been allowed to breed an omega, which was highly unusual at his age.
Dean had just had his hands full of angel feathers, the delicious scent of wing oil mixed with the beginnings of Cas’ heat teasing his nostrils and awakening his alpha, when, all of a sudden and without any prior warning, Cas just flew off.
They’d shared soft kisses and dirty kisses and everything in between. But somehow, this one was special. This one was saying ‘I need you’ and ‘I love you’ and ‘you mean the world to me.’ And while they had had kisses that said all of that before too, this time, the knowledge that the other one felt the same way made it all the sweeter.
It was pretty obvious that Michael was onto him and wanted to expose him, which was why Castiel declined, using a flimsy excuse. Unfortunately, Zachariah, who was also invited, thought it was a fabulous idea and didn’t take no for an answer. Finally, Castiel had no choice but to agree to bring Dean to Michael’s dinner party this weekend.
Castiel liked that moment most because if Dean was looking at him that intently, it meant he certainly wasn’t pretending Castiel was someone else. Dean also liked to draw that moment out, pushing in oh so slowly. The calm before the storm. The few seconds they were almost… tender with each other. Before Dean’s alpha took over and he fucked Castiel hard and relentless, not paying attention to anything but the end goal.
belly do flip-flops as if he really were carrying the alpha’s pups and they were moving around inside of him.
Whenever he did that, Dean rewarded him by being extra careful with him, very softly nibbling on his bared neck and making sure the omega felt safe in his arms. Dean only had to do what his alpha instincts told him to do because seeing Cas bare his neck never failed to stimulate his protective instincts.
Before he could offer his apologies, Dean already continued, “I think I liked you better when you were afraid of me.”
, even though Dean wasn’t scenting him, Cas’ alluring scent was all around him. On top of that, Cas kept bumping his scent gland with his nose, nuzzling into him as if he wanted to climb inside of him.
Obviously, this vision had to happen before Dean would kill him. Or try to kill him. Or maybe it meant that Castiel would be successful in convincing Dean
Castiel stayed put. He didn’t need to see how much of his sense of smell was gone. He knew. “All of it.”
Making out with Dean while he was in heat was exhilarating. Never before had he even considered letting an alpha stay in his bed when his heat had already hit. But every kiss from Dean—to his scent gland, on his mouth, on his
His omega thought that was a great opportunity to get a bit playful, taunting the alpha for not catching him and challenging him with a cocky attitude.
Instead of getting more pliant beneath Dean’s hands, he had to have stiffened because Dean paused in his massage.
“There you go,” Dean encouraged. “I’m right here. I’m scenting you.” And Dean did, using Cas’ shirt he had laid out for later when he was alone in his motel room. Taking a deep breath, he took in the scent of his ma—no, not ‘mate,’ scent-bond partner. Yes. The scent of his scent-bond partner.
He was almost relieved when Cas’ answer to the usual questions stayed the same. The first thing Cas got to smell after all these weeks should not be the scent of a horny alpha.
He texted him a quick SOS anyway, and then there was only one thing for Cas left to do: run and never look back!
He stopped his pacing and settled for the more casual, “Hey, Cas?” He looked up at the ceiling, as if he could direct his prayer heavenwards that way. “How does this work, do I just talk to you?”`
Tugging at the edges of his blanket, he waited for Anna to take the hint and leave him be. Eventually, she did, but of course, Castiel couldn’t fall asleep. It was too early, for one, and a few miles away, this Inias person was getting all of Dean’s cuddles.
Zachariah was sitting in his high back leather chair, his hands folded on the burgundy tabletop of his huge desk. Intimidating seemed to be his default setting. He wanted people to know at first glance that he was the head alpha here, before they even had a chance to pick up on his pungent scent of spoiled milk and cheese that was past its expiration date.
And maybe happiness wasn’t just in the being. While loving Dean was really all he had needed to be happy—it sure was nice being loved in return.
He was waiting for his new headphones to arrive, so he didn’t think twice about it when he ripped the package open. Only when he took out the fake knot did he realize that there must have been a mistake. It was probably intended for the omega down the street.
Dean’s favorite plaid shirt. Since it was a bit too big for him, he looked absolutely adorable in it. (Okay, he might just look adorable in it because he was
Cas just scented him again before backing off to reply, “Waiting for someone who is alpha enough to make a move.”
Over the next few weeks, Dean got into the habit of jerking off before he went to Cas for their scenting dates so that he could avoid any embarrassing reactions to Cas’ assault on his scent gland. More often than not, he was so worked up after they were done with the scenting, that he had to take care of his poor, confused cock
“Yeah, we might want to close the drapes.” Dean didn’t seem too bothered, but just went about his usual routine, getting ready to take a shower.
instinctively scenting Dean, which might become a problem. After all, there was no reason for him to do that when no one was around.
His own ass twitched as a new gush of slick made way for an alpha’s cock that wasn’t there. Damn, his asshole was getting ready for his heat and really craved an alpha’s essence!
Of course, his friends didn’t pass up the opportunity to ask Cas personal questions to involve him in the conversation, which was how Dean found out more than he had ever wanted to know about his mate. For one, Cas had a whole bunch of other siblings apart from the one brother he was staying with, but he wasn’t close with any of them. He had studied, like, a dozen languages, and was interested in all kinds of species, “especially winged ones.”
Dean was starting to get a bit curious despite himself: why was Cas so surprised? Surely, he had picked up on the fact that Dean was an alpha? His mission was to find him an omega, after all.
After Dean had made sure that Cas had everything he needed, they engaged in a quick goodnight scenting and that was that. Dean now officially had an omega in his bed while he was tossing and turning on his couch, itching to check on Cas (preferably by taking him into his arms and scenting him some more).
Damn, he’d enjoyed sneaking a kiss from time to time. It had seemed like Cas might have enjoyed it, too. Apparently not. He’d definitely miss the goodnight kisses. (What was a little bit of Frenching between friends?)
But all rational thought aside, Cas’ omega had still wanted Dean to come over and take care of him instead of going out and leaving him to pine for the alpha all alone.
Castiel was glad that his knot went down before the alpha’s because it might have been a bit embarrassing if the alpha saw that he had popped a knot from getting fucked.
He should pretend to be asleep. He did not want to talk to Dean. Smelling the omega on him would probably make him nauseous.
The doctor had picked up on how fidgety Cas was all of a sudden as well, and asked, “Do you want the father to wait outside?”
Cas sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “I’m sorry. I just… I’m completely scent-blind here and Sam told me I’m most likely stuck like this for a while, and on top of everything, I’m making a fool of myself here, failing at a task everyone should know how to do instinctively.”
Instead, Dean set up a rough rhythm in an attempt to distract his alpha from the urge to mark that omega who would soon be bearing his pup.
“Mikey, Mikey, Mikey” Lucifer tuts, shaking his head in mock sadness. “Did you really think that I was going to keep my word? After all this time? Hello, Devil! Sorry pal, not gonna happen.”
“Dean stopped torturing others, but he has never stopped torturing himself.” The Angel shakes his head. “How can he possibly believe that Sam, or anyone else for that matter, would shun him for who he loves? No one has rejected you, or Claire, or Max Banes for pursuing same-sex partners.”
“Anyway. I heard her gigglin’ on the telephone with her sister, name of Alex” he continues. “They were palaverin’ about Dean Winchester finally doin’ the blanket hornpipe with that angel of his, Castiel. Seemed like it was a new development. Which struck me as peculiar ‘cause everybody I know thought them two had been doin’ it this whole time anyway.” Hercules smiles confidentially.
Twelve years. Twelve years of trusting and fighting and trusting again. Twelve years of forgiving the impossible and insisting it was all for friendship. Twelve years of loyalty blurring into devotion, attachment softening to love, giving each other everything they could save for a hand to hold and a mouth to kiss.
“Did you?” Cas threw back, not unkindly despite Dean deserving as much. “It was clear to me that you were resisting, putting it off. I didn’t want to make things harder on you by pushing my desires.”
Dean knew it wasn’t fair to her. Wasn’t fair to Sam, but god it hurt just to look at them sometimes.
The wounds weren’t too bad on their own, but together Dean could imagine they were pretty painful. He hadn’t asked Cas how he got them, and didn’t plan to. Dean knew that if he did, he’d somehow find a way to feel guilty about it.
Fuck. Should he have sent an emoji or something? Cas used to send them sporadically, smiling to himself like an idiot every time Dean caved and sent him some half assed thumbs up. Maybe it would make him happy.
“You’re not handling shit, sweetheart,” Dean retorted, and it took a few seconds for his body to fully react to the word, everything inside of him pulling taunt. He tried not to remember how the last time he’d let it slip was in pitch-black darkness. Dean flicked a finger at one of the
“Hey, Cas!” He called out, lifting an arm to try and get the other’s attention. “The hell are you doing, man?”
His hands flew out in the darkness, searching blind, but Dean didn’t need much guidance; he had been here too many times to count.
They were a living serendipity, a bundle of coincidences that were never meant to occur, to align the way they did. They only existed out of the sheer will of wanting to, the act of being, and that was exactly it.
“He saved me,” Dean finished for him, everything about Dean suddenly strained and resistant, his voice clipped, “end of story.”
He pushed himself upright the moment he noticed Dean, blatantly eager with his sideways grin, but the look on Dean’s face was nothing short of distraught and his smile was gone in an instant.
He couldn’t let himself think about how he’d left Cas back in Kansas without even considering that he might just end up missing Dean as much as Dean knew he’d miss him.
“It’s one in the afternoon, Dean,” Sam said, looking at Dean clearly for the first time. His eyes lingered on the patchy bruise at Dean’s temple, before moving back to the door. “Is everything okay? Cas seems—”
When the warehouse doors opened, Dean hadn’t been sure he’d found anything more than a blur in the darkness. His body tensed, and he reached blindly for his gun, fingers catching over grass and mud. It wasn’t until he heard his name, hoarsely shot through the night in a way that was far too familiar, that Dean relaxed back against the tree, his heart thundering away.
Dean barked out a sharpened laugh, memories of clipped curtains and hand-made bonfires turning his stomach inside out.
“That was pretty smooth, Cas,” He smiled, and Dean wondered if Cas could pick it out now. The warmth in his voice, how every part of him ached in moments like these when it was just the two of them. “You know, for an angel.”
“Is this you actually answering a prayer? Or is this just a check-in before you jump ship for another two months?” He couldn’t even remember the last time he spoke so bitterly; the last time he’d felt so close to losing himself to his rage that stayed dormant and alive, waiting in a constant simmer for the inevitable snap. “Do you have any idea how much we’ve needed you? You’ve been gone for
Eileen held on to this for a long moment, staring at Dean in the dark, rolling the words between her fingers. She looked certain and doubtful all in the same breath, expression changing after every tick of a second.
Dean waited for the sound of rustling sheets. He ached for a grumbling voice, rough with sleep but soft with fondness, embracing Dean with a feeling he’d only ever known as being home. But the moment dragged on, dread settling high in his throat as he stared at the grate at the bottom of the door, waiting for the sight of lamplight to spill out into the hallway.
Silence filled the void until Dean was ready. And when he finally spoke again, his lips turned loose with a lopsided grin, he found Sam already frowning.
There was a time when doing this— praying, falling to his knees with desperation dragging him to the floor— was less preferable than anything Dean could imagine.
“I wished for the same thing,” Cas was smiling now, fragile, like he wasn’t sure he was allowed to. “Every night with you trembling and sleeping by my feet, I wished for that too.”
Dean pulsed with sympathy, a breath spilling out of him. He hadn’t had to do that in years; Dean had stopped brushing Cas away ages ago, deciding the surge of contentment in his heart at a simple brush of hands was worth the burn at the back of his neck, the instant harrowing panic.
Silence crashed down around them as Cas straightened his spine, eyes sliding to the floor. His fingers tightened around the paper he was still holding, the sound of it crinkling in the stillness matching a breakage in Dean’s chest.
Dean looked at Cas with pure love in his eyes, face melting with it, insides crackling away as his heart ached something awful. Dean had missed this more than anything.
There was a frantic hitch over the line, the receiver passing through a rush of air and a swearing Castiel before settling and, in the most sickeningly sweet voice possible, came a— “
“Classic rock, sweetheart,” Dean grinned, reaching over and squeezing her on the shoulder. “That’s your preference. You can put your hands on the dash and everything, feel the vibrations. It’ll rock your world, promise.”
Castiel looked at Dean from the passenger seat, but didn't speak. He simply trailed his eyes over Dean’s face like he couldn’t quite comprehend the tension there, why his features always resorted to anger before anything else.
“And though you might not want it, I’m gonna give you some advice about that girl of yours, free of charge,” She said calmly, forcing Dean to stop and look up in surprise, his wallet not even halfway out of his pocket yet before she was smiling and saying, “call her back. Do somethin’ other than skirt around the obvious, because honey,” She scoffed, curling a hand around her hip. “It’s obvious.”
He adjusted his grip on the phone. “Can you head down here and keep an eye on Cas for a few days? Sam found a case. We're on our way there now and we couldn’t exactly bring him.”
Dean looked up at Cas in the mirror, the closest thing he could manage to actual eye contact. There he found Cas looking exceptionally pleased, mouth slanted in this wonder filled grin that made Dean want to both bolt out the door and kiss him stupid, teeth and all.
They had been going at this for almost a week now. Sam knew, and Dean could only assume that Eileen did too, as often as she was around. Neither of them had questioned why Dean and Cas were bunking together now. Dean was grateful for the privacy; he probably would have gone catatonic by now if any more attention was being drawn to it, any more reminders of how fast everything seemed to be moving and building and falling apart.
“I don’t know,” Castiel said, voice pulled low again, dark and strained. “I… I’ve never felt anything like that before.”
Lundy released his grip on Cas’s throat, and the relief was instantaneous. Color broke free and fled to Castiel’s face, and he gasped as if surfacing water, spluttering through wet lungs, coughing until his ribs cried through every inhale.
So, with a sigh, he used his cupid magic to make Dean and Lisa receptive to seeing the other one as a potential mate, and let human hormones do the rest. He waited long enough for the confirmation that Dean and Lisa had started the courting period—and that was that. He could finally start in on the backlog of files that had piled up while he had been busy finding Dean’s mate.
Dean rolled his eyes. “I have to go to work tomorrow, I can’t just spend a few days with some random omega.”
Dean pulled him up into a sitting position, his hands wandering from his shoulders up to his neck, gently holding his face, completely ruining that whole ‘hardened hunter’ image.
Scenting seemed like a safe place to start. After all, he could hardly ask about knots and stuff right off the bat. Plus, Dean
He also knew he didn’t tell Cas how much he loved him enough because he was really bad at words and at figuring out unique ways of saying it. He did say it with every touch, though, and the way Cas just melted against him when he did showed that the omega understood what he meant.
Cas was sitting stock-still, no idea if he should jump up or just stay where he was. Dean was asleep. The cologne was hopefully still covering his scent at least partly. Getting up might only wake Dean up and draw unwanted attention to the fact that Cas was trying to hide something.
Of course, Gabe knew that, but he liked ribbing Cas about things like that. Cas would never admit to it out loud, but he liked the fact that Gabe was so direct about it, not mincing words. It was a hell of a lot better than being treated with kid gloves when the topic came up. Somehow, Cas suspected Gabe knew that…
“Let’s relocate to the bedroom,” Dean suggested. “That took the edge off, but my alpha is going to want to have another go at you soon.”
But of course, he was trying to convince Dean that he was just an ‘average Joe’ (as humans would say), very much in touch with his human side. That meant no naked baths. Or anything else Dean might consider weird witchy behavior for that matter.
“And alphas?” the teacher said at the end of the class. “Don’t forget to make your omega feel loved.”
. He’d drive hundreds of miles away from him. That thought alone made his mating bite ache, even though Dean had only just left.
He made it through the night and to the next morning, but by then, his omega was climbing the walls, his whole body screaming at him to call Dean again to take care of his heat.
In the middle of the night, he woke up and looked at his cell phone. Dean had to be home by now. But of course, there was no message. It wasn’t like they had the kind of relationship where Dean had to check in with him and tell him he’d made it home safely. And wouldn’t Castiel know if he was in trouble anyway? Didn’t mates feel this kind of thing through their mating bond?
He felt around for a bit and when he found that bundle of nerves in Jimmy’s ass, the omega’s hips bucked so hard, his dick in Dean’s mouth almost choked him. Oh yeah. This omega was ready for some alpha dick.
It was still an accident when he took it between his thumb and index finger and experimentally stroked it, making Cas shut his eyes tightly and moan.
It had even been infected at times and trying to reach his own back had been frustrating to say the least. Even now, in an attempt to make the scars look less red and angry, Cas occasionally tried to apply some cream, but it was almost impossible to apply it right and took him a long time.
Well… and of course, omegas tended to bare their necks in safe surroundings, in the presence of someone they felt very comfortable with. After all, it left them in a rather vulnerable position.
All the while, Cas was freaking out. He was going to meet his alpha’s brother. He really wasn’t great at making first expressions. And Sam was very important to Dean. Making a good first impression was of great import!
In response, the alpha started nibbling on his scent gland a bit, which didn’t help Castiel’s urge to present for him.
The only thing that would make this better was if he got to smell Cas come again. Going by the continuous moans, he might get to smell it sooner rather than later.
Still holding on to Castiel, Dean glanced over his shoulder at him. “You can’t just piggyback on my ‘welcome back to life’ speech.”
“Nice move,” he then said as if that was his usual way of congratulating Cas on a job well done, completely ignoring the butterflies that were frantically flapping their wings inside Cas’ belly.
That was enough out of Dean. Castiel had picked up a trick or two as well and knew just how to distract him.
The way Dean had been nothing but nice to him, ignoring multiple perfectly good opportunities to kill him, it did sound rather ridiculous, but—wait.
Dean seemed a bit dumbfounded, but in true Dean fashion, he only mumbled something like, “Oh. Okay. Sure.”
He tried his best to make a good impression, but a wink here and a teasingly raised eyebrow there had him stumbling his way through his own name (three syllables were way too many when confronted with the nicest-smelling alpha in the world).
While circling Cas’ hole with his tongue and teasing it into producing even more slick, his hand found the omega’s hard dick and fondled it lightly, not enough pressure to give Cas something to fuck into, but enough to make him want more.
Dean mumbled, “Apparently not,” but the officer already continued, “You send me in here to wake up a mated couple…”
That last one didn’t sound like he was being completely honest, but Castiel doubted the alpha had just made all of that up, and one good deed would have been plenty enough.
That worked well enough, but then Cas got comfortable enough with him to mention (albeit with slightly pink cheeks) that skin on skin contact helped with feedings.
“Yeah, okay, laugh your ass off,” Dean said when he came out of his bedroom in his medieval costume, even though Castiel wasn’t laughing. He was, however, staring, which might not be the polite thing to do, but somehow, he couldn’t stop himself. “Believe me,” Dean continued, still using that defensive tone of voice, “omegas dig this shit.”
Yes, that had to be the reason why he still had this insane urge to scent-mark Jimmy and give him a cuddle.
Castiel could do nothing but blink at him. While he didn’t deny that he was a witch, he didn’t exactly advertise it either. Most people were just happy that his tinctures worked and didn’t question it.
Since Dean didn’t want their connection to end, he pushed his knot into Cas’ hole and let the last few shudders of their shared orgasm pass through them while they were knotted.
The first day wasn’t too bad. After work, they Skyped and with one of Cas’ shirts next to him, which he sniffed from time to time, it almost felt as if they were lying next to each other.
Cas, of course, didn’t answer one way or another, completely unaware to what was going on around him.
That’s when a warm summer breeze brought over a scent that had him look up and almost drop his keys in his haste.
That finger was still in his ass, reminding him of what was to come, teasing slick out of it until it had to be sopping wet in there.
With that, he pulled out and thrust back into Cas harshly. “You enjoy being fucked by a human, Cas? That turn you on, submitting to a human alpha?”
. No need for Cas to get all mad at him, just because Dean was bad at hiding how much the omega meant to him.
He needed to get out of here, collect himself, calm down his wings. He had no idea how Gabriel talked to humans on a regular basis without wanting to pull his feathers out.
