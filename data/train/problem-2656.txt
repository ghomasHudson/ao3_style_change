« Yes. Hum. He said I was brave and that I have a smart appearance. »
Ah. That was already more like the Holmes Watson knew. The idea of a hot bath was very tempting, really, as much as the idea of coming back to his work after was insufferable.
Watson was agape. Sherlock Holmes had run him a bath. After having make him a cup of tea. That was even more incredible than Sherlock Holmes willingly washing up! There must be a problem somewhere…
“You seem a little confounded, my dear man, let me explain my train of thoughts. You probably noticed Valentine’s day was coming only a few days ago, when the advertisements became impossible to pass by in the newspapers and thought finding a present to give me during this celebration reserved for the lovers would be a bright idea. You’re a tasteful man - if I may say - so I’m quite sure you didn’t simply buy flowers or chocolates - they would have been welcome, by the way, you may think I’m a difficult lover to please, but everything coming from you would be cherished - anyway, I know you found what you were searching for on Wednesday.”, Watson was thankful, as he was so very often, for his excellent memory and knew he would have to dissect this statement over and over again before beginning to understand its ins and outs, for now, he simply was trying to not look too much like a fish out of water, but was doing a rather poor job. “Did you think I wouldn’t notice your excitement and deduced where it went from? You were positively glowing, John. Then you forced yourself to not think about it less I would point something out and deduced what you were up to. I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to spoil your little surprise. Oh, don’t look so astounded, John! You might like to make your readers believe I’m some kind of machine, cold and heartless, but you know there is very little I wouldn’t willingly do for you! Where was I, now? Ah, yes, upon taking your breakfast this morning - and even if you know that I need some time to emerge out of Morpheus’ embrace - as well as yours, I really can’t fathom why you got up as your usual time this morning, my dear… Breakfast at eight O’clock, at the table, on Valentine’s day? I was hoping we would share another feast than Mrs. Hudson’s cooking, but whatever, lunch would suit me equally well. So, you saw me still half asleep and suddenly thought Valentine’s day may not be my cup of tea, after all.”
“Hey! No, no, no, no, not drowning in the bath! Out of there, now.”
A little less than two months ago, John Watson and Sherlock Holmes had confessed their feelings to each other, with Mycroft Holmes’ providential help [2] (if Aziraphale were anything else than love, hope and good intentions, he would have been jealous of this accomplishment, but Aziraphale is an Angel and, therefore, can’t be jealous, isn’t it? At least, that’s what he’s trying to convince himself of). And February just had begun. Why is it important? Two reasons: first of all, the second month of the year is often the colder of all, as if the Winter had lazily done his job during December and January and then, seeing March was coming, decided to give everything he had before being replaced by “I’m-Almost-Everyone’s-Favorite-Season” Spring; the nasty show-off… To cut a long story short: when confronted to truly freezing temperatures, murderers, kidnappers, thieves and even dealers tended to stay home, as comfy and warm as possible. They were deceitful, not crazy, thank you very much; therefore, February had always been a month including less cases than the others (with August, the same thinking applies, only in the very opposite direction). No case = nothing special to focus on. Add to that a blooming, passionate relationship in its early stage, when one would do anything to please one’s partner, and you have the perfect combination of facts to obtain a False Good Idea (tm). It is exactly what happened to Doctor Watson when, on Sunday February 7th, while reading the newspapers during his breakfast, he stumbled upon several advertisements concerning Valentine’s day.
“It is today, isn’t it?”
« Of course, he hurt her, and she left. »
« I was just kissing you! You were the one divesting me of my jacket! »
« And then - if I may ask you to wait a second, sir, I took some notes to be sure I didn’t forget anything, here it is - he asked about what the lady needed, he said ‘an alibi? A windscreen? A human canoe? Does she intend to use you to navigate on the Thames?’. It was so brutal, sir, so uncharacteristic from the good Doctor Watson, I thought you would want to know that. Mr. Holmes can be somewhat... rude? sometimes, but he surely did not deserve it. Not if he’s trying to help a woman who’s dear to his heart. »
« Thank you, Mrs. Hudson, one moment please! »
« Very well. That was very enlightening, John. »
explain the birds and the bees to John Watson. I did my share of good deeds by asking for his confession and listening to it. Enough!
Doctor John H. Watson will forever stay in the collective memory for having been a model of loyalty, bravery and kindness. I think he deserves it. And a bright, astute man once said bravery is, by far, the kindest word for stupidity; proof that smart people can also say nonsense bigger than themselves, but I have to say Doctor Watson had put himself in a stupid situation and it was a miracle (or two, the third is suspected but can’t be proved) everything went alright at the end. But I’m getting ahead of myself, let’s start with some context.
“Holmes!”
7. There was no Ritz in London before 1906, sorry ^^"
“Shush old chap! Just bringing you a cup of tea.”
If only it was this simple… With a lot of patients came a lot of paperwork, there were files to be completed, notes to be written to the apothecary, not to mention the preparation of his tomorrow morning round and the notes of the two last cases with Holmes which were waiting to be properly narrated on his desk… No, no rest was planned for Doctor Watson, not until the early hours of the morning. And he was soaked, which didn’t lift his mood.
Of course, dear brother Sherlock does not know or does not care that Liège - a Belgian province - is the second industrialization centre in the world and that the English Government needs to have an accord with Belgium if our nation wants to stay the leader; why would I have other things to do than playing nanny to Sherly and baby Watson, I ask you?! But as PC Clark is a good constable and an even better man, as he certainly was sure he would help his two friends by coming and recounting their possible problems to their Mother Hen - in other words I - I put my pen down and encouraged him to talk.
« Oh, hum, sure. He... He talked about my walking stick, which is also a steel blade - it was a reward for partaking and coming back alive from the Afghan war - hum, it’s... It’s a great reward, so we were very few to get it, and he... He said I was as rare and lethal as the blade but... As elegant as the walking stick? »
I really had had the intention to send a letter to my little brother, asking him for an appointment, but, unlike Sherlock whose name is known by all of London, if not Great Britain, I had very soon learnt that anonymity is the real key to freedom, power and success, which I rightly can tell as the embodiment of the Government. But, as the embodiment of the Government, even as free, powerful and successful as I am, I have a lot of duties and responsibilities, and some of them simply can’t be put aside, even for rescuing my little brother from his own obliviousness. However, I can very well turn everyone I need into a mole for my account, and that is how I found myself, interrupted in the middle of writing a letter to the Belgian Prime Minister by PC Clark.
“So, what?”
Aziraphale wasn’t the most observant Angel; nobody is perfect. But when he had learned Crowley was at the origin of Valentine’s day, he had instantly known the Demon hadn’t wanted to do something bad. It would have been better if the information hadn’t taken five centuries to come to his ears, but well… Better late than never, right? It’s exactly what the Angel was telling himself when he knocked at Crowley’s door before leaving a little package on the threshold and disappearing. From his hiding place, he watched the Demon opening the door, searching for the little scoundrel who seemed to have wanted to prank him and almost stepping on the package before picking it up and going back inside. Content with himself for now, Aziraphale went back to his library; if everything went alright, a boy from the telegraph office nearby would soon search for him.
? It was too much for the poor, emotionally wrecked Doctor. With the last force he had spared from not hiding his distress, he asked: “Why did you get me something, then, if it’s a celebration you don’t care for?”. Holmes had never ceased to smile since he had started to talk, an amused smile which turned to tender. “I don’t need a pre-defined day to show you my love, John. I don’t need a special occasion to please you. I didn’t even wait for us to be a couple. If I know your favorite compositors are on the program, I take you to the opera. If I see you had a rough week, I took you to your favorite restaurants. If I see you need comfort, I play the violin for you. If I see you’re bored, I ask you to read for me or tell you about my adventures before you enter my life. I try to let you know how much you’re brilliant, how important, how indispensable you are to me on every minute of every day. I know I’m not very good at it, I’m doing my best and I will find ways to improve myself until what I’m saying to you seems the simplest truth and not send you into heart attack. Do you need me to lay you on the floor? I would suggest some brandy, but it’s only eight thirty in the morning, so… Do you-”. Watson didn’t need any brandy and wasn’t against the idea to be laid on the floor as long as Sherlock was near enough for him to kiss the living breath out of him. Holmes was right, it truly was a shame to be out of bed at this hour on such a day.
“Watson, don’t make me come and get you. You’re reversing the roles, dear, I’m the one who must be compelled into the bathtub! Stop acting out of character, the water is cooling down.”
Their arrival at the mortuary was almost a welcome relief; the smells there were merely of formaldehyde and lye, strong and gagging but somehow cleansing to the nostrils. Still it was no place for those with delicate stomachs or sensibilities.
G. Grover, Tobacconist, conducted a highly successful trade from a fashionable shop in Buckingham Palace Road not far from the palace itself, a discreet plaque over the door proclaiming, BY APPOINTMENT TO HRH THE PRINCE OF WALES. Largely as a result of the prince’s patronage, Grover’s had an exclusive clientele that included many of the most prominent names in England, among them peers of the realm, of course, and individuals highly placed at court and in government.
“Funny how the mind works sometimes,” continued Abberline. “Neil told me that his first thought was ‘Well, here’s a woman who’s committed suicide!’ Can you believe that? He actually started looking around near the body for the knife she did it with. Then it came to him. She had been murdered.
Watson raised his hands in a gesture of surrender. “Enough, enough; I should have known better than to doubt you. You have my most abject apologies. Now, for God’s sake let us get the bill and find our way home. I am suddenly very weary and want only my bed.”
Abberline turned toward him in his chair, his expression a mixture of mild annoyance and surprise.
is prominently displayed.” He took a deep breath before continuing. “For a change, the newspapers are correct, I fear. The headlines are no more sensational than they deserve to be. The latest crime, Mr. Holmes, is as hideous and as dreadful as they say it is. Indeed, even more so, because the Fleet Street crowd haven’t printed the worst of it!”
Holmes continued. “I take it that the similar article of apparel that Inspector Chandler found at the murder scene and correctly deduced could have had nothing to do with the crime is what ties our Mr. Pizer to the event. Or am I only jumping to conclusions?”
I hope you enjoyed it <3
« I told you brother Mycroft would come soon, damn it! »
Too late. Half through his cup of coffee, the pipe smoking between his teeth, Sherlock Holmes, an eyebrow raised, was looking at Watson. Or, more accurately, through Watson, down to his very soul. Still trying to choose the less painful path out of the now inevitable conversation, Watson answered - very articulately - “What?”.
Back during Antiquity - and a lovely evening at the baths - the Angel had talked to him about a Valentine guy who had fought war by love or something equally sappy. The thing was Crowley remembered very well how much Aziraphale had loved this man (an excellent reason for the Demon to despise him, already; but what wouldn’t he do for his Angel, I ask you?) and how hard he had hoped for the fellow to be canonised. After a quick check in a sanctoral [1] to be sure Aziraphale’s wish had been granted (Crowley would have made it happen, otherwise), the Demon got to work. Saint John has his fires, Saint Patrick his carousals and Saint James his shells; Saint Valentine would get something as well.
“Yes, tea leaves and boiling water. However, it would have been an empty cup. And some honey. I know you like honey.”
« Please, go ahead, constable. »
« Well sir, I had come to Baker Street to tell Mr. Holmes about Blackwood’s resurrection - I’m sure you know everything about it, Mr. Holmes, sir, and therefore I won’t recall the whole sordid story to you - so, I was in the stairs when I heard Doctor Watson voice - and he had a strange tone, sir, all bitter and... And I may say ‘arrogant’ - nothing like the Doctor Watson we know, I am sure you would have agreed with me, sir, if you had heard him. So, I carefully listen to what Doctor Watson is saying - while trying my best to be silent, as Mr. Holmes surely would have heard me in the stairs or recognize my pace if I had not been this careful, and then I would not have been able to listen to what was happening. Anyway, I heard Doctor Watson talking to Mr. Holmes about a woman...
The Detective answered with a roll of eyes.
Watson teared the wrapping paper and discovered a book, before he had had time to read the title, Holmes asked him “Do you remember the theatre play we saw last year in Paris?”. John remembered, it had been a lovely night, the first of two stolen to a restless life after a case involving a Holmes’ distant French cousin. “I do,
John really didn’t mind to be laid on the floor, but a bed was definitely a better place; he wasn’t getting any younger and his old war wounds weren’t as open-minded as he himself was. Count on Sherlock to be aware about it all and take the right decisions. But even sprawled out in bed, blissful and sated, John Watson still was a very curious man; and, contrary to the proverb, it was an essential quality when working with one Sherlock Holmes.
« Yes, I took your jacket off because I didn’t want it to get wrinkled! »
Words were John Watson’s field of expertise; he was a writer, after all. But there was only one word he could find to describe what he was truly feeling for Holmes, a word which means “too great or extreme to be expressed or described in words”: ineffable. A fervent kiss would be a good beginning to convey the feeling without words.
A couple of hours after that, Watson probably fell asleep on his armchair. Almost unconscious, he let Holmes leading him to his room and felt a little, light kiss being pressed on his forehead. All these little gestures made him felt… Love.

“And you’re torturing yourself because you think I forgot about it.”
A few minutes later, he heard splashing noises coming from the bathroom. Not paying attention to them, thinking Holmes had (finally) decide to take a bath, Watson didn’t lift his head from his papers. It wasn’t that the fact of the Detective deciding to take a bath without a whole session of arguing and bargaining wasn’t surprising, quite the opposite, the Doctor was simply beginning to feel too comfortable to have the strength to leave his chair. He knew that, if he left his work now, he wouldn’t be able to go back to it. He was too tired and too snug at the same time. He was still absentmindedly writing down his prescriptions to the apothecary while trying to decide if he should head to the bathroom and ask to Holmes what had gotten into him or not – and drinking his tea – when he heard him calling from him from the doorframe of his room.
“Shush! I saw your prescriptions earlier, nobody will die from a cold and you already reviewed the poor ones who have the flu. You will plan your round tomorrow morning in front of a pile of toast, some jam and a steaming cup of tea. Come on, now.”
“You’re spoiling me.”
His voice was gentle and, when Watson managed the strength to open an eye, he saw Holmes was holding a fluffy towel and that he didn’t seem to want to leave. Watson knew he should ask the Detective to leave the room while he exited the tub, or at least feel a little uneasy to be this exposed before his friend, but he wasn’t. He was far too used to live in close proximity with the other man, to the little touches on the knee or the shoulder, to be groped to be put out of danger and to grape the Detective in return for the same purpose, to the little whispers, to the knowing smiles, to the… Stop. Not the right place nor the right moment.
My...
No, no, no, I would
And the Detective to answer quietly, smiling, before getting up to return to his seat:
4. Thomas Midgley Jr. discovered the freon, a gas used in the fridge to replace the previous gas which was mortally dangerous. But the freon is a grennhouse gas...
Even after years of cohabitation, even after dozens of cases solved side by side, John Watson still was astonished by Holmes’ powers of deduction. He never grew tired of it, and knew he never would.

“Him” being the one and only Consulting Detective, who currently was clumsily attempting to cram his first pipe of the morning. Sherlock Holmes will forever stay in the collective memory as the greatest mind of his time (maybe of all times, but his ego doesn’t need to be stroked), as a true hero, restless but full of grace and hiding a golden heart behind a facade of snark. But not before his first pipe and cup of coffee, not if the world is not imminently ending. Watson just had the False Good Idea™ to buy a Valentine’s gift for Sherlock Holmes, and, of course, he was intending to be anxious about it. It truly was a chance Holmes was still dead to the world at this very moment, otherwise he would immediately have understood what his lover had in mind and probably tried to stop him. Maybe a first little miracle, which can’t be proved and which I will always deny performing. And, even if I did, Watson was still far, far from out of the wood.
“And this mustache, this, ah, tickler — he was quite certain about that?”
Once he and Watson had been relieved of their hats and sticks and provided with mugs of tepid tea, Holmes lost no time in getting to the business at hand.
Hey guys
and diversions of a country manor.
“Ah,” said Watson before Holmes had a chance to make the introductions. “H-Division, I presume.”
“Well, not until after I reached the scene several hours later. And by then, well...”
“Yes, Mrs. Hudson. Thank you very much indeed.”
Watson and the two policemen stared at him.
Abberline refused to meet his gaze, but instead busied himself with a sheaf of papers in front of him. “Not at all,” he replied, his diffident tone suggesting otherwise. “It is a man by the name of John or Jack Pizer, who lives in the district and is believed to have been seen in the vicinity at around the same time the murder occurred.”
As they threaded their way toward the entrance minutes later, Watson had to step to one side to avoid colliding with a man rushing headlong into the restaurant: a short, round individual with a large mustache, who after a hurried glance around the room made directly for the table occupied by the couple in question, profuse with apologies once having arrived. He was carrying a bulky briefcase and was dressed in a sagging dark business suit, not of the best cut or material. His voice, which could be clearly heard over the hubbub of the restaurant, had a decidedly middle-class accent —
It was a tall, good-looking man in the dress uniform of an army general — boots, spurs, medal ribbons and all. He had a full, drooping cavalry mustache and wore a monocle in his eye. Upon his head, incongruously, was a tall, old-fashioned stovepipe hat of the sort that police constables wore a generation past. The haughty bearing of the man, along with the uniform, the monocle, and the hat, resulted in a total effect so ludicrous that only a stage setting for one of Mr. Gilbert’s operatic farces would have done it justice.
“It’s Valentine’s day.”
« Yes, sir. So, Mr. Holmes did not answer - or if he did, I did not hear him, and I was listening very carefully so it’s really unlikely - and then Doctor Watson attacked again; he asked her if Mr. Holmes loved this person because she had humiliated him twice. »
Damn human’s soft feelings, Belgian blast furnaces and oblivious idiots in love!
“Good morning, Mr. Fell. I am… Well. I’m searching for… something.” Mr. Fell’s smile turned a little embarrassed, but he went ahead nonetheless, “And I would be happy to help you to find it, but I’m afraid I will need more clues.”. But the problem was still the same: Watson has none. Then, as he was quickly evaluating his surroundings to find at least the tail of an idea, the Doctor’s gaze caught on the racks just next to the librarian counter. They were full of music scores. It seemed like such a logic, bright idea; for the second time in less than ten minutes, Watson asked himself how the Hell he hadn’t thought about it earlier. “I’m searching for sheet music.”, Mr. Fell immediately rounded his counter and drew up to the racks; “Aah, now we’re talking, Doctor. What kind of?”. Ah. The radiant smile which had illuminated Watson’s face an instant prior faded instantly. To begin with, music scores tended to be expensive and even if the good Doctor had stopped gambling altogether (or almost. It didn’t count when Holmes was with him, there was no danger since the Detective kept an eye on him and on his fellow gamblers as well as on Watson’s wallet; did it? And his checkbook was still locked in Holmes’ desk drawer, anyway), he wasn’t rich; far from it. Then, he couldn’t tell to Mr. Fell he intended to gift what he was searching for to Sherlock Holmes as a Valentine’s present. Watson was almost sure the librarian wouldn’t be appalled by this revelation; he strongly suspected Mr. Fell to be no stranger to the notion of loving another man. Watson couldn’t say anything anyway, not without speaking about it with Holmes in the first place. To his great amazement, faced with a long, awkward silence, Mr. Fell’s smile turn from beaming to gentle. “I’ve got exactly what you need, Doctor Watson.”
« You couldn’t stay, or you didn’t want to? »
Sometimes, one feels like the idea one has the other day may not be the greatest - as one first thought - but the worst, or close to it. It happens to the best; Albert Einstein, Enrico Firmi [3], Thomas Midgley Jr.[4], Shakespeare[5]… It is exactly what happened to John Watson on Valentine’s day morning, but nothing as significant as his peers, don’t worry. The good Doctor would soon wholeheartedly laugh about it all; he was, however, more tempted to faint than to express joy when he sat at the breakfast table. Everything was… Normal. Mrs. Hudson had brought toasts, eggs, bacon, jam and coffee; the newspapers were waiting to be read on the pedestal table, Holmes was cramming his pipe with tobacco. Nothing was amiss, and Watson couldn’t believe he had, even for one second, thought buying a Valentine’s gift for Holmes would be a good idea. Of course, he wouldn’t be into something so mundane. They had known each other for years, now, one would have thought Watson knew better, but no. What could he do? Act like nothing was afoot and keep his present for another occasion? No way, as soon as the Detective would have drunk his cup of coffee and drawn on his pipe a few times, Watson would be found out. Giving his gift as he had planned, then. Holmes would love it, that was for sure, but how would he react before unwrapping it? Would he just tease Watson? Tell him how irremediably romantic he was? Or would he be offended, annoyed with Watson for distracting him from important matters? He wouldn’t have any present for the Doctor, anyway; Sherlock Holmes was definitely not the kind of man who would care for Valentine’s day. Oh, Watson didn’t care one bit about the lack of present, but he would have loved the intention, would have known Holmes had gone out of his way to find something for him, thought about something which might please him and bought it just for the sake of putting a smile on his lover face. Watson knew Holmes didn’t care, and it hurt. The only option left to avoid more mental suffering was for the Doctor to jump through the window next to his seat, but it seemed a bit too much to end up face first on the sidewalk just to avoid confrontation with the love of his life. What else, then?
, right?”, “Indeed. I know you didn’t enjoy it as much as you should have because the play was in French, here is the English edition Mr. Fell miraculously found for me.”. To be honest, even if he had experienced some difficulties to understand everything, John had
After this tediously long stage-setting, I could not stop myself from interrupting the policeman: there was no need for me to hear all his story if he were to inform me Watson and my brother had had an argument because the former wanted to get married. I knew and, as unfortunate as it may seem, my Belgian Prime Minister would still need to be first taken care of. But Mrs. Watson-to-be was not the problematic lady here.
Back in bed, Watson decided he was more curious about Holmes’ reaction to his gift than anything else and told him to open the present. The Detective did so and discovered, eyes wide, a book of music scores. “John! It must have cost far too much! Tell me you didn’t sell your watch or something to buy it, please!”, “Absolutely not, it wasn’t expensive, actually, Mr. Fell told me nobody wanted of these music sheets because of the anonymous ones. And he also offered me a price reduction if I agreed to sign his copy of “The Hound of the Baskervilles”; he’s a big fan of yours, did you know? And he likes my writings very much,
Watson gave a puzzled look to his best friend. He had known Holmes for some years now, and while he had grown accustomed to the shoots in the wall, to the explosions at random hours of day and night, to the violin at equally unrespectable hours, to the frantic chases in London and to the crazy shenanigans of his partner, he was still startled by his gentleness in moments like this. Don’t hear him wrong, he had always known that Sherlock Holmes was a good man, probably the best of all (even if he wouldn’t be caught dead saying that all loud), but… “Caring” wouldn’t be an adjective he would use to describe the Detective in his writings. It seemed he still had to learn a few things about this mystery of a man, after all. Relaxing, Watson breathed his surprised thanks and felt a little warmth springing in his chest when the Detective gave him a small smile in return before quietly leaving the room. This time, he returned to his task with a little smile of his own.
« And you followed her. »
I am not supposed to have a favourite historical period, it wouldn’t be fair. And if I had one, it wouldn’t be Antiquity. I dislike all the eras equally, just as Aziraphale loves them. However, even the Angel of the Eastern Gate found things he didn’t like over all these years: illiteracy, of course, rudeness, fast-food - no, that’s not surprising, I know - and the plane; My, Aziraphale would never climb in a plane, not for anything in the world, nor in Eden! Flying? Without his wings? In a pressurized tin can with a bunch of anxious humans? Thanks, but no, thanks! Oh, it would have been possible to make the Angel board in an airplane, he would willingly do it if, in exchange, he could be sure there would be no more pain, injustice, inequity. He would even smile to the flight attendant. But Aziraphale knew very well his humble principality in a plane wouldn’t achieve any of this, the device would only be sure not to crash (and it would be great already, but this is not the question). A long time before the Angel had had to formulate an inner judgment about flying tin can, he had had to face human’s cruelty. Planes weren’t that bad, at last.
Watson was soaked, but not because the icy rain of November was rolling down his neck. The Doctor was so astounded, he wouldn’t be able to explain how he ended in the tub for dear life, but here he was, almost asleep in a tub full of warm water and lavender bath salts; the one he used when his leg were threatening to cramp. Holmes had even thought about it… His eyes closed, Watson let out a sight of contentment, delighting in how dizzy he felt. He would have really fall asleep in the water if Holmes hadn’t put the role of Mother Hen on tonight.
Not fifteen minutes later, he almost jumped out of his chair when he felt someone suddenly leaning on him.
This time, Holmes looked a little upset.
“But…”
I would like to say the good Doctor really thought what was bothering him did not deserve to be talked about, but he was simply dying to complain about it to someone, really. He was just too scared to be judged and maybe roasted, perhaps worse.
“Did you break something? Lost our rent?”
« Exactly. Now, please, help me, I can’t find my trousers and brother Mycroft is either dead of mortification or of laughing behind the door! »
« Mr. Holmes, Doctor Watson? Mr. Mycroft Holmes is here. »
« Sure, so I suppose removing my waistcoat and my shirt was, also, a matter of avoiding wrinkles! »
3. Albert Einstein and Enrico Firmi both worked on the nuclear fission, which will lead to the nuclear bomb.
I had to find a solution to avoid the tragedy of two pining men being separated by their own foolishness ; for their own good and my sanity. The idea comes to me rather simply, with the mail, when I was wondering what gift I could make to Doctor Watson if I took on their invitation for Christmas. And this is how I found myself, as I said, awkwardly playing cards with my brother and his best friend on Christmas day, ardently wishing I had been able to mind my own business or, even better, never heard about anything at all! But here I was and, when Watson got up to serve us another brandy, I took the opportunity to ask if we shall exchange our Christmas gifts. They both agreed, to my great relief.
“Thank you very much, that was very kind of you, but I have to finish my work, and…”
It is so painfully obvious that it is not deducing but just listening. It was a passionate love confession poorly concealed with a half-hearted comment about gambling. And the sweet, adorable fool I had in front of me did not understand anything about it and was just so confused and ready to break my little brother’s heart.
.”. They were, indeed, anonymous music sheets scattered between Bach, Tchaikovsky, Mozart and Rossini’s; with titles as mysterious as “Eden and Hell”, “The Demon’s Gift” and “ineffable”. “I thought you wouldn’t care about them, it really seemed like the perfect gift and I knew you would be angry if I chose something too expensive.”, “You’re absolutely right, my good man, I don’t need you to empty your wallet for me, but these unknown pieces look very interesting; I think I will try “The Demon’s Gift” as soon as leaving this bed will seem acceptable… Your turn, now.”
5. Shakespeare was a tedious writer, it took a (demonic) miracle for his plays to become famous.
“Why?”
A package wrapped in tartan wrapping paper can only be from Aziraphale, Crowley would have spared himself a few swears if he had checked the packet more closely before thinking about a joker. Why the Angel had dropped it off under his porch and not simply gave him, Crowley didn’t know. It was a book. Not so surprising from Aziraphale, but he knew the Demon didn’t read, why would he give him a book? Well, that’s not true, Crowley wants people to believe he doesn’t read; he’s already a poor excuse for a Demon, if people knew he likes - just as Aziraphale - to read in front of the fireplace with a quilt on his legs, he might as well jump straight in a bath of Holy Water, it would be less inglorious. The title says “The Hound of the Baskervilles”, at least that’s something the Demon likes. Crowley is a Very Big Fan of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, he even had thought about coming up with multiple robberies for the Detective to chase him and, therefore, for him to be part of the adventure, but he had managed to refrain himself. For now. Opening the book, Crowley couldn’t believe his eyes. The volume was
“Watson.”

The proverb says: “Hell is paved with good intentions”. But, sometimes, it’s worth it.
« Well, my friends, I think you have a lot to tell each other and I have other matters to attend, so if you would excuse me? »
As expected, I am not very fond of Christmas. I have purposes more important to attend and do not wish to partake in the socialities such a celebration necessarily entails. But, as no one is perfect, the elder Holmes does have his sins, the biggest one being my curiosity; hence, when I had received an invitation to spend Christmas with my brother and his best friend, my curiosity had been titillated enough to accept. And if I had known, I would have declined because, dear me, I had never felt more awkward than now, playing poker while sipping a glass of brandy, sitting between Sherlock and John. And, as Stanley will attest, I am not easily abashed.
I never really told you why Crowley hated the 14th century, did I? Well, he’s the one who had invented Valentine’s day, the best excuse he could ever find to tell Aziraphale how much he loved him, without telling him altogether. It wasn’t supposed to be the celebration of lovers, but the celebration of love. All kinds of love. Secret partnership between Heaven and Hell to ensure the worlds was still turning as it was supposed to could be encompassed in the definition, right? No, I know, it was a poor excuse, but Crowley was full of good intentions. He couldn’t have known humans would turn his celebration in a commercial one, distressing men, disappointing women and excluding bachelors. He had even received a medal from Hell, for all the misery he had brought. What a shame… He had napped for the rest of the century, hoping to get up a little less angry.
I punctuated my sentence by the warmer smile I could display, and the gates opened flawlessly.
Between two kisses, Holmes whispered, “What book did you say Mr. Fell made you sign?”.
Watson wasn’t offended by Holmes’ words, he was right. The Detective might be a lunatic, Watson wasn’t a saint either. But, still, this display of kindness was doubtful.
Indeed, what can one buy to the Great Sherlock Holmes as a Valentine’s gift? Not my division. Three days later and a dozen ideas discarded, one would have given up out of sheer frustration; not Doctor Watson. One doesn’t become Sherlock Holmes’ partner in every field if one can’t compete against a llama for the title of The Most Stubborn Creature out of the two. Watson wanted to find a suitable Valentine’s gift, a suitable Valentine’s gift he would find, even if it meant visiting every single shop in London. On his way back from buying some tobacco and still trying to find another idea, Watson’s path led him to Holmes and his favourite library. How he hadn’t thought about visiting Mr. Fell’s establishment earlier, Watson couldn’t tell. Prima facie, Mr. A. Fell’s library seemed perfectly normal: shelves upon shelves crumbling under books, dust dancing in the sunlight, peaceful atmosphere, little nooks where customers were welcome to nest in to read, and a very sympathetic librarian who had the incredible ability to find in no time whatever his customers were searching for. It was, in Watson’s opinion, like a little piece of Heaven on Earth.
« I am very sorry, Doctor, but I am waited somewhere else. It was nice to meet you, have a very nice day. »
Holmes reached out his hand, and in a small gesture of apology for his harsh words gently adjusted the collar of Abberline’s suit coat. “You need not attempt a reply, Inspector,” he said with a grim smile. “There can be no adequate response, and I expect none.”
The hansom jolted to a halt at the corner of Commercial Street and Hanbury: A rope barricade across the intersection would permit them to travel no farther. Holmes pushed open the doors and bounded from the cab.
He pondered for a while as they walked, his sharp profile silhouetted against the glow of light. It was the first of September, the night was warm and clinging, the myriad smells of the city an almost palpable presence. London, noisy, noisome, nattering London: aged, ageless, dignified, eccentric in her ways — seat of Empire, capital of all the world; that indomitable gray lady of drab aspect but sparkling personality — was at her very, very best and most radiant. And Holmes, ebullient and uncommonly chatty, was in a mood to match.
Wiggins looked from Holmes to Watson and back to Holmes again, an insolent but not entirely unengaging grin spreading across his face. He sniffed violently and wiped his nose with the back of his sleeve.
Lanterns were brought in short order and the others stepped aside as Holmes, on hands and knees, spent the next ten minutes crawling the length of the dank passageway, poking into every corner and cranny. He finally emerged into the daylight with the knees of his trousers covered in filth, a glint in his eye, and something tenderly clutched between thumb and forefinger. He held it up for the others to see, his thin lips turned up in a triumphant smile.
“Yes, of course. We scoured the area thoroughly,” replied Abberline. “Twice, in point of fact. The lads have even sifted through the rubbish and have searched the alleys and doorways. I can tell you, Mr. Holmes, that except for what is before you, we found nothing — nothing that can be tied to the crime, in any event.”
Abberline, who had stood there stoically though all of this, swallowed hard. “May I introduce to you, Sir Charles, Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson. Gentlemen, the Commissioner of Police, Sir Charles Warren.”
Dark Annie was not alone when this fellow, Dick, claimed to have seen her. She was with another man, a “mark” whom she had apparently just encountered in the street, for they appeared to be haggling over price as Dick approached. He said he overheard the man ask her, “Will you?” and she replied, “Yes.”
“And none of them heard anything?” asked Watson.
“That’s from Abberline,” snapped Holmes, gesturing to the crumpled message in Watson’s hand. Once again he called up to the driver, “Faster, man! Can’t you go faster!”
” he sputtered. “There is no possible way you could know all that. Not even you! This time you have gone too far.”
Accordingly, upon consultation with the firm’s solicitors, and having determined you to be the only surviving son and heir of said Dr. Ian Anstruther, Cox & Company deem it will have acquitted itself of its responsibility by delivering over to you the aforementioned file.
“If I did not know better,” continued Holmes, “I would be prepared to swear that the Brigade of Guards has paraded through here this morning.” He shook his head. “Wherever there’s the smallest patch of mud in the street, I see the unmistakable imprint of a policeman’s boot. It is as if your fellows went out of their way to leave their mark so as to prove their existence.” He smiled thinly. “I will say this for them, they’re a well-shod lot. Only one seems run-down at the heels insofar as I can ascertain: a pigeon-toed chap, a bit overweight, who goes by the name of Bagley, I believe.”
“Perhaps, Inspector, I can prevail upon you to begin at the beginning,” he said softly, enunciating each word with great care. “Leave nothing out, I implore you.”
“A what?”
Holmes nodded.
“Aye, h’at’s ryght. Made out of ledder, mebbe, or ‘Merican cloth.’”
“At three forty-five on the morning of Friday the thirty-first of August — yesterday — Police Constable John Neil, number 97-J, of H-Division, while in the course of his normal rounds, did come upon in Buck’s Row, the body of a woman lying in the street.” Abberline put the notebook aside and continued in a normal speaking voice. “At first he thought she was just another derelict, unconscious from intoxication — God knows, a normal sight in Spitalfields. He reported he smelled the reek of gin. By the light of his bull’s-eye lantern he could see that she was lying on her back with her eyes open and staring. Her skirt was pushed up to her waist. He felt her arm and it was still warm — ‘warm as a toasted crumpet,’ he said. So he tried to get her to her feet. That’s when he saw that her throat had been cut, and the blood was still oozing out of it. Then he looked closer. The windpipe and gullet had been completely severed, cut back to the spinal cord.”
“Wh’ell, dere’s talk of a killer, a demon o’ some sort, stalkin’ da stweets w’iv a ‘atchet. Some sez ‘e’s a Jew w’iv a wild beard down ‘is chest, an’ some sez ‘ees a butcher fwom da slaughter’ouses w’iv a le’dder h’apron, an’ some sez ‘ees a toff fwom da West H’end out to kill all da ‘ores...”
But then one day old Mr. Anstruther died, and the worn, cracked leather portfolio remained quite forgotten until the occasion, several years later, when Mr. Jones took up his new position.
“Well, one t’ing. ‘Ee sez ‘e caught a flash of da bloke’s collar when ‘e turned lyke. It were funny, ‘e sez, ‘cause it were diff’rent.”
Holmes drew on his cigarette and continued, the exhalation of smoke intermingling with his dissertation. “That they are recently come from Paris is equally apparent: The lady is wearing the very latest in Parisian fashion — the low decolletage is, I believe, as decidedly French as it is delightfully revealing — and the fabric of the gown is obviously quite new, stiff with newness, probably never worn before. That they arrived this very evening is not terribly difficult to ascertain. Their clothes are somewhat creased, you see. Fresh out of the steamer trunk. Obviously, their appointment at Simpson’s is of an urgent nature, otherwise they would have taken the time to have the hotel valet remove the creases before changing into the garments. That they are traveling without personal servants can be deduced by the simple fact that the gentleman’s sleeve links, while similar, are mismatched, and the lady’s hair, while freshly brushed, is not so carefully coiffed as one might expect it to be. No self-respecting manservant or lady’s maid would permit their master or mistress to go out of an evening in such a state, not if they value their positions and take pride in their calling.”
“That’s him, right there.” Abberline motioned him over, a tired, rumpled man in a houndstooth inverness and brown derby.
Holmes prompted him gently: “The body? It had been taken away?”
“Wh’ell h’anyw’ys, h’its h’imposs-ee-bul ta figg’r, dere’s so much, ah, so much, watcha-callit goin’ about.”
It was only a matter of seconds before the slamming of the downstairs door and the loud trample of footsteps on the stairs heralded the arrival of the unsavory and insignificant Wiggins, the leader of the nondescript band of street arabs that Holmes was amused to dignify as the Baker Street division of the detective police force. The boy burst into the room not only unannounced but without even the nicety of a tap on the door: A dirty face with large shrewd eyes, an unruly mop of hair, and a slender frame enveloped in a cast-off coat several sizes too large. His was not so much an entrance as an explosion, but the cloud of dust which in Watson’s eyes seemed to accompany the event was surely only illusionary.
Abberline shook his head. “Oh, I know, I know. Violent death is no stranger to Whitechapel or to Spitalfields. As I don’t have to tell you, the Spitalfields district is populated with the very lowest of the low: the poor and the very poor and beneath them the utterly destitute — the dregs of society, as they say. Why, crime — crime in its most violent forms — is a way of life there. And life is so cheap, they’ll slit each other’s gullets for a sixpence and think nothing of it.”
“I went over dere to where ‘e said,” explained Higgins. “Me ‘n me myte, Burt. An’ we rummages ‘round a bit an’ found ‘em in da stweet. I t’ought ya myght lyke to ‘ave ‘em.”
“Well then?” said Watson impatiently, drumming his fingers on the table.
“Gone these few hours since,” announced Mrs. Hudson as she shook her head disgustedly. “Don’t ask me where, I don’t know. I never know where he goes or when he’ll be back. Hardly pecked at his breakfast, and such a nice one too. My best Sunday table with kippers and eggs just like he likes them, and that marmalade he favors — costs a pretty penny, I can tell you. And him? He gulps some coffee down and is off! Hardly half a cup!” She shook her head some more and actually waggled a finger at him. “Out till all hours of the night, the both of you! You’re as bad as he is, sometimes!”
“Just one street away from Hanbury, where the murder occurred,” mused Holmes half to himself.
“Why, yes, Doctor, it is indeed the Whitechapel affair that brings us here. However did you guess?”
Abberline sat back, his face resuming its anxious expression. “Dr. Watson is, of course, correct. We have spent the better part of the day and evening in the Whitechapel district trying to come up with something — anything at all — that would give us a clue to this heinous crime. I tell you, Mr. Holmes, I have never come up against anything like this before. It’s the most horrible thing I have ever seen. Without doubt, the most horrible, vicious thing.”
In appearance, Hanbury Street was not very much different from Buck’s Row, the site of the earlier murder: It was forever in shadow. Narrow and dark, the sun’s rays rarely ever reached its recesses, and the brooding tenements that lined both sides of the street seemed shriveled with cold. They were dilapidated affairs, three-storied brick structures for the most part, with shops on the ground floor and flats above. A few contained boardinghouses on the upper floors: doss-houses, as they were called, reeking dormitories with rows of beds at four pence a night. Holmes and Watson picked their way through rotting garbage to where a small circle of police officials in civilian clothes was gathered in front of an open doorway at number 29. The doorway was located alongside an empty storefront which, as indicated by a weathered sign over the darkened window, was at one time occupied by a barbershop, N. BRILL, HAIRDRESSER AND PERFUMER the sign said in fading block letters, while other, smaller advertisements in the storefront window extolled the virtues of VASELINE and BRYLCREEM hair dressings.
, yet little had changed for the better, and not even someone with his powers of description could prepare the unwary for the worst of it. Spitalfields was a place that penetrated the soul with feelings of repulsion and dread.
Holmes smiled politely and bowed again.
Abberline took a deep breath. “I have to inform you, Mr. Holmes, that our prime suspect is not the man your theory suggests. By that I mean he is not a gentleman, but a common laborer of the district. Sergeant Thicke is out looking for him now, and I hope to have him in custody before the day is out.”
Abberline rose from his desk and followed Holmes into the corridor, taking him by the arm as they walked toward the front hall. “Look, Mr. Holmes, I am not at all happy about this situation, that much must be obvious to you,” he said very quietly. “But as you no doubt are aware, our department has been under severe pressures of late. Surely you must realize that my hands are tied. I do have my orders, after all.”
Watson gasped and would have laughed outright had not something in Abberline’s demeanor — a look of apprehension, perhaps — brought him up short.
It was a good quarter of an hour before Holmes made his way back. He had roamed around the yard for a brief period of time and then disappeared back through the passageway into the street, where he was observed walking up and down, peering into doorways, searching the gutters, poking into crevices in the pavement with his stick, and occasionally bending down to peer at one thing or another at his feet. Watson, in the meantime, had completed his examination and was standing by the body, wiping his hands on a handkerchief, when Holmes returned.
It was not long before they were ushered to a table, despite several parties of late diners waiting to be seated; for the eminent Mr. Holmes and his companion were not unknown to the manager, Mr. Crathie, who ruled his domain with a majesty and manner the czar himself would have envied. Shortly after taking their places, they were served a light supper of smoked salmon and capers, accompanied by a frosty bottle of hock.
Holmes pursed his lips and stood silently, looking down at the body. When he finally spoke, his voice was low and husky; his eyes burned fiercely. “I will have this creature. I will have him, make no mistake.”
“Well, Wiggins, let us see if we can separate rumors from fact, shall we?”
“If it were me,” said Thicke, “I would ‘ave made straightaway for Brady Street and thence for the underground station at Whitechapel Road. Easy to get lost in the crowd there.”
“You are welcome to it, of course,” said Abberline. “I’ve heard you’re an authority on the diverse varieties of tobacco, Mr. Holmes, but still —”
“If the popular press are to be believed —” He broke off in midsentence and laughed. “What a silly premise to go on, eh? Still, if there is even a shred of truth to their rather lurid accounts, this particular murder contains features that are not entirely devoid of interest. But what intrigues me more, Watson — what intrigues me infinitely more at the moment — is your astounding ability to filter from your mind even the most obvious and urgent of external stimuli. It’s almost as if you have an insulating wall around you, a magical glass curtain through which you can be seen and heard but out of which you cannot see or hear! Is this a talent you were born with, old chap, or have you cultivated it over the years? Trained yourself through arduous study and painstaking application?”
Holmes gave him an indulgent smile. “Not Watson’s brand,” he replied tersely. “His bears the imprint of his tobacconist, Bradley. Nor is it mine, since I have not yet indulged this morning. As to the possibility that it belongs to one of your colleagues in the department, Inspector, unless the Home Office has granted the Metropolitan Police a handsome increase in emolument that has escaped my attention, I should be very much surprised if many policemen could afford the price of these. It is a custom Turkish blend, I do believe, and the paper is of the finest quality. It is not a common brand you will find at your corner tobacconist’s; I doubt if they’re obtainable for less than seven and six the hundred.”
Abberline shook his head.
A light rain was beginning to fall as their hansom entered Piccadilly Circus, where early evening throngs promenaded past brightly lit theaters and shops, the lights reflecting garishly from the now-dampened pavement. When the hansom reached Trafalgar Square a few minutes later, the rain quite suddenly became heavier, causing the crowds there to quicken their pace, while a flock of pigeons erupted for no apparent reason from the base of Nelson’s Column, making a single circuit before settling helter-skelter amid the mushrooming of umbrellas that erupted almost as swiftly as the pigeons had taken flight.
Abberline fidgeted in his chair, and his fingers began a nervous tattoo on the desktop. Holmes observed him silently for a few moments, exchanged glances with Watson, and finally spoke again.
“Well?”
Abberline nodded his head. “Yes, those are the ones. And there have been others as well. You’ve been keeping up with things, I see.”
They walked quickly, eyes to the ground, detouring when necessary around the occasional small clusters of vagrants, misshapen lumps sleeping huddled in doorways or against the building walls.
“Oh, there will be another one, have no doubt. Have no doubt whatsoever.”
That was the sum total of Dick’s description of the man. Because of the poor light in the street, no more could be seen. And nothing more was heard. Dick continued on his way, and that was the last he saw of Annie Chapman.
“Yes, yes, I know, Mrs. Hudson,” he called as he ran. “Thank you, thank you kindly. No time for how-d’ya-dos.”
Warren peered at him in confusion. “What! What! What did he say?” He turned to Abberline. “What’s he doing here anyway?
He led the way through the door into the dark passage and was almost to the street when a thought occurred to him and he stopped abruptly, causing the others who followed to pile up behind.
“Hold the light higher, please, someone!” ordered Holmes, his voice sounding unnaturally loud, even strident.
Watson returned his gaze. “A kidney has been removed, and the uterus as well, and I don’t know what else: We will have to wait for a proper autopsy. Holmes, I tell you, I don’t know what to make of this; I have never seen anything like it.”
“No,” replied Thicke, shaking his head. “The closest would have been Mrs. Green, who lives down there just a few doors away, and she said she didn’t ‘ear a thing, not a blessed thing, even though she was awake. Couldn’t sleep, she said. I know ‘er; I think she’d tell me if she knew something. Mrs. Emma Green is ‘er name, a decent sort really.”
“That is, unless,” said Holmes, “the assailant did not accost her from behind, but — unlikely though it may be — did so facing her, in which case our man is right-handed after all.”
“Pay the man, Watson! I promised him a sovereign if he didn’t spare his nag!”
“Quite by accident I arrived on the scene within minutes of the body being discovered. I’m on nights at the Commercial Street Station and was making a tour of the area. It was shortly after six A.M., and I had just rounded the corner into Hanbury Street when I encountered three men running toward me, shouting. At first I thought it was one man being chased by the other two, and that the three of them must be the worse for drink. Then I thought it must be a house on fire, they were that agitated. Then they were upon me and shouting, ‘Murder! Quick... it’s horrible...’ I tell you, Mr. Holmes, I have never seen anyone in such a state as I did these three. Well, as they led me the way back along Hanbury Street toward number 29, I tried to piece their story together.” He slipped his notebook out of his coat pocket.
“I don’t know, I’m sure, Mrs. Hudson,” he mumbled. “No doubt he’ll do his best to return in time.”
With each question Abberline shook his head.
“There was nothing else?”
Abberline kicked the ground with a foot. “What bothers me is that there are no signs of a struggle. As you can see, there is no proper paving here, just a patchwork of stones and earth. If the woman put up any sort of resistance, you would expect to find some indications of it. Yet, the ground doesn’t seem to have been unnaturally disturbed. She must have come here with him voluntarily, or even brought him here. Certainly, she was not dragged by force.”
“I confess that I certainly would have,” said Watson, who had followed them to the tap and was peering over Holmes’s shoulder.
Holmes looked at him sharply. “Missing?”
Warren approached within inches of Holmes and waved a finger under his nose. “It’s my aunt Fanny’s arse, that’s what it is! Now, what do you think of that?”
Watson looked pained, but he bravely, perhaps foolishly, continued: “You said he was a railroad man. How do you come by that, eh? And your conjecture that he is waiting for an urgent appointment, a business engagement, you said — and with someone beneath his station? How do you arrive at those conclusions?” He snorted. “Admit it, Holmes: pure guesswork, plain and simple!”
Abberline shook his head. “No, nothing of the sort. Except, as I said, the first quick look-around that Neil conducted right after discovering the body. Not ideal conditions to find anything.”
“Good Lord!” Watson looked at him with widened eyes.
Warren nodded. “You do that! And let me tell you, sir, that I concur wholeheartedly with my officer! He acted quite correctly, quite correctly indeed. This is no business for amateurs, and certainly no business of yours, and I’ll thank you to keep your nose out of it. And one thing more, sir. Should you ever meddle in police business again, I shall have you taken in charge. Taken in charge, sir! Count on it!”
Abberline looked embarrassed. “Well, of course a search was made the next morning, but nothing was found. As for footprints or suchlike, bless you, Mr. Holmes, but Buck’s Row is paved with cobbles. And the muck in the street, as Dr. Watson has so astutely observed on my boots and trousers, was by then so churned up by so many footprints, it would have been useless, quite useless, to even try to isolate the one pair that might have been of any interest to us.”
Watson took the lamp from Thicke and held it closer. “Yes, I see what you mean. They could be bruises made by fingers, perhaps — by a thumb and forefinger, as if she were held from behind with the assailant’s hand tightly over her mouth, to suppress a scream no doubt.”
“My name is Holmes. Show me to Inspector Abberline at once, if you please. I’m expected.”
It had been Dr. Watson’s custom, from time to time, to entrust to our safekeeping various notes and records of a confidential nature, the contents of which I, naturally, have no knowledge. It was his wish, as expressed in a letter of instructions to this firm, that upon his death the folio, hereunto attached, was to be delivered over to Dr. Ian Anstruther of London Hospital and Queen Anne Street whom, upon inquiry, we learned to have passed on these several years since.
Abberline sighed heavily.
Abberline took the envelope from Holmes’s fingers and, barely glancing at it, laid it on the desktop in front of him. “Thank you,” he said simply, his face showing no reaction whatsoever.
Watson got down on his haunches and pointed. “Her throat wasn’t merely cut, Holmes; it was slashed, just like the other. And as far as I can tell, it, too, was from right to left. The entry wound is here, you see, and the angle of it suggests that her chin was raised unnaturally high, consistent with being grabbed about the mouth from behind and her head pulled back.”
The squat shape of Abberline separated itself from the other forms as Watson and Holmes approached.
Holmes clapped his hands delightedly and rose from his chair, laughing. “Wiggins, you are a treasure, an absolute treasure! If I had not already invented you, I would have to do so at once. You do me proud!”
Watson stood there like a shamefaced schoolboy.
Holmes, who had little patience with those whom he deemed to have “less alert intelligences than his own” (It was
“Hard to say. Perhaps.” Watson looked closer. “Yes, I think you are right. It would appear to be.”
; he couldn’t wait to read the text in his mother tongue and was sure “love” would soon become an euphemism to express his feelings toward the play, just as it was for his feelings toward Sherlock. The Detective didn’t need a special occasion to please him, indeed, but he had deduced the Doctor would want to celebrate Valentine’s day, went out of his way to indulge him and found the perfect present. A present concerning a theatre play they attended more than a year ago, but Holmes had remembered how much John had loved it. He had

Aziraphale had barely had time to take his overcoat off that somebody was entering his library. “Mr. Fell, Sir?”. A telegraph boy. “That would be me, what can I do for you?”. The lad smiled to the Angel, “Telegram for you, Sir.”; the note said, “Diner at Simpsons’[7]?”. Aziraphale’s couldn’t have been more happy. “Will there be an answer, Sir?”, “Yes, just a minute. Oh, I went to the bakery just this morning, how would you like a brioche while I’m writing the answer?”
At this point, Watson was simply feeling than the damnest fool on this planet and didn’t have the strength to pretend otherwise.

“Didn’t you?”
“I beg your pardon?”
My interest would have never been tickled if I had not run into the good Doctor as I were on my way for the Diogenes’ Club. The poor man seemed deeply upset, so I went out of my way (this is to say how much I appreciate Doctor Watson. I do not skip a meal at the Diogenes’ Club for anyone) and offer him to share my lunch in a pub. A good deed to be later rewarded, certainly. Or simply a bad idea as I had immediately deduced that Sherlock was the reason Watson was upset for. But my time was already lost, so I had to ask as well.
Crowley had despised 14th century. For several reasons. First of all: it had been impossible for him to get his hand on the Angel for quite a long time. Their encounter under Arthur’s reign hadn’t been so much friendly, and Crowley had hardly seen Aziraphale since. In all honesty, the Demon thought the Angel probably was at Philip the Bold’s court; but he wasn’t sure. Anyway, he couldn’t find a good excuse to go there himself. Usual Angels and Demons had both loved the Middle Ages; the first because everything was about God, and pleasing God, and fearing God and, when Crowley said I had f*cked up good monkeys by giving them anxiety, he was only halfway true, it seemed they also were fanatics and hypocritical. That’s why Demons also loved this era, tempting humans to do horrible things in my name was utterly useless, they already did it themselves very well. So, yeah, Crowley had claimed he had instigated the first Crusade and whispered to Edward II of England: “Hey! You could be king of France if you wanted to, you know?”. It was enough and even maybe a bit too much; after all, he didn’t want Aziraphale to believe he was… Well, a Demon. Usual Angels and Demons had loved the Middle Ages, Crowley had hated them. Aziraphale had really loved Arthur’s ideas, Gregorian chants and the cultural aspects of the court of Burgundy and disapproved almost everything else. Since the Demon couldn’t find a way to join Burgundy without sowing - or pretend to sow - misery behind him, he had had an idea for Aziraphale to come to him. It was a very good idea, I have to say, but not enough for degenerate monkey not to screw up.
Dear Clark was very far from the truth, but his willingness to support Sherlock - even if the last has probably offended the constable countless times - was praiseworthy. I thanked him, gave him a tip for his disturbance (« There’s no need, Mr. Holmes, sir, it’s all very natural and it’s my job. »; « Your job is being a policeman, Clark, not my valet, all work deserves a pay, so take the damn money and go buying some tobacco in my name. »), and decided Belgium and it’s Prime Minister would wait a few more moments for I had to tidy my thoughts up.
“And would you, please, close your mouth? You look like a fish out of the water.”
So, Doctor John Watson, known by his acquaintances to be a good man, amenable, sympathetic, loyal - especially to my brother - had decided to laugh - rather cruelly - at his best friend’s, brother-in-arms’ depends. Not even laughing at his depends, stabbing him in his pride. Why? Why would a man to be married throw a tantrum - there is no better word for this kind of behaviour - because his best friend is (supposedly) in love? How the assumed feelings Watson thinks Sherlock has for Adler could be a bother? First things first, Sherlock is not in love with Miss Adler, and if Watson had not been so oblivious, he would know that, but he does not. There are only two options: either Watson wants to be the only one of the two to find love, get married, have a family; but it is very unlikely given the man is utterly unable to be this egoistical or ill-minded, either... Either he is jealous, not because he wants to be the only one to be happy, not jealous of Sherlock, but of Adler. He wants to be the one Sherlock is experiencing feelings for. He cannot stand the love he so desperately wants to be given to anyone else, especially not to a woman like Irene Adler, someone he is certain would break his dear Holmes’ heart without batting an eyelash. If the problem had only been that he thought the woman unworthy of Sherlock’s love, he would not have been this vociferous. And, if Watson is so sure his love is unrequited, why wouldn’t he marry Miss Morstan and try his second chance? My God...
Abberline would not leave it at that, however. “Do you not have any thoughts at all, Mr. Holmes? Or suggestions?”
Holmes shot him an amused glance. “No, dear fellow: CID, as it happens.” He made a gesture of presentation. “My friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, gentlemen. Watson, this is Detective Inspector Abberline and Sergeant Thicke.”
They were at the mortuary within the hour. A hastily summoned four-wheeler conveyed them through the night to the slums of the East End, although the cab’s jarvey was most reluctant at first to take them.
Holmes gazed at him silently for a long moment, then turned to retrieve his hat and stick. “Come, Watson. Our business here is done.”
“Yes,” said Holmes tonelessly.
“It is the only profession I can think of that wholly consists of men who have missed their calling,” said Holmes dryly. “The best of them are assassins and lying malcontents; the worst are

He was obviously exhausted from being up all night; his face was drawn, his eyes empty. He was a man who had suffered shock and was emotionally drained.
“You know me better than that,” Holmes said, casually dabbing at his lips with a napkin. “I never guess.” His lips puckered in a prim smile.
Holmes looked up with a strange smile on his face, an almost gleeful grin that took the others quite by surprise. Turning abruptly, he slashed the air with his stick and stamped his foot on the ground. “God, but this fiend is a wonder! He is a wonder indeed!”
“Hanbury Street? Not all that far from the site of the last murder, is it?”

“His lordship insisted upon total confidentiality, and I gave him my word. Can’t say as I blame him, though he is hardly the first old fool with a young wife and a randy groundskeeper.
