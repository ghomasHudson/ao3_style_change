By the time Dean comes out, Sam is snoring and Cas is gone.
He has not looked at the wounds himself, nor does he particularly wish to. A nurse offers him a hand mirror but he declines. He is polite enough as the doctor stabs needles into him, but the pain is overwhelmingly repetitive, and he finds his knuckles turning white as he grips the sheets beneath him. Later on, he avoids the bathroom mirror too, as well as Sam’s miserable expression. Dean would call the look his “puppy dog eyes”, though a man of Sam’s stature being likened to a young canine has always confused him. It isn’t until he’s on the receiving end of said look that he understands. It’s a softness, a tenderness aimed his way, which in itself is a warming thing, as is the comfort of a small dog. But it is mixed with a healthy dose of pity, and for that Castiel will not stand. Not while Dean is in surgery because he failed to protect him.
“Well, I don't want them! Stoppit, please, stop helping me.”
Dean hasn’t heard from Cas in a few weeks. It’s understandable, given the fact that he’s been running from his douchey angel brethren since he rebelled and Lucifer walked free. He’s also new to the whole “cell phone” thing. When Dean had gifted it to him and programmed in his number, Cas had done that birdlike head tilt as if he didn’t understand its purpose, so it is possible he just doesn’t know how to send a text message.
“Nothing happened,” Cas whispers.
He waits, holding still in that position, long enough for his knees to really start complaining. Eventually, he sighs, and sits on the ground with his back to the bed. Mira, sensing his distress, whines and trots over. She flops her chin onto his shoulder from atop the bed, and Dean absently reaches up to scratch her ears.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Define ‘alright’ for me. In full sentences, if you can manage that.”
They both scream. The searing imprint of Castiel’s hand burns into Dean’s skin, raising it in red, angry bubbles and sending lightning through Dean’s body. At the same time, a choking darkness crawls from Dean’s skin up Castiel’s arm.
Cas looks back at him, something like dread on his face. “I feel, Dean. I feel each and every pound of this weight, in my muscles and bones. And I feel...scared, I think.”
“Yes, baby, you’re getting it now,” Alastair snarls as he sees panic overtake Dean. “No one is coming to get you. It’s just you and me down here, forever. Doesn’t that sound fun?”
“Yeah, it was a real rager.” Dean mumbles. His eyes track downward to the carvings on the table. That’s the one thing they had done before Dean had disappeared into his room the day they said goodbye to Jack, Sam remembered. They had pulled out their knives and carved names into the table side by side. Sam had done ‘Jack’, and since it had fewer letters, he had watched quietly as Dean finished the one that read ‘Castiel’ with such care and reverence that it felt like a prayer.
Cas’s eyes had never been bigger. “This was no small feat, Dean.”
Instead, he raises his blade and moves towards the stone opening that marks tonight’s sanctuary.
Dean wants to punch him and hug him at the same time. “Jesus, Cas. I thought you were gonna leave!”
“Hello, Dean.”
“Hmm. Paraphrasing, huh?”
“Excuse me, mister, who are you laughin' at?”
It also means they wind up fighting the vengeful spirit in a section of forest with which they’re deeply unfamiliar.
danced?” Dean asks incredulously.
Sam leans in. “Plus, there was the eye fucking.”
“We’ll camp in that cave for the night.” Dean announces gruffly, his tone leaving no room for argument. He’s at the helm of this ship of stragglers, and isn’t in the mood to waste time fielding questions. The trees' shadows are lengthening into monstrous fingers along the ground, which means they'll lose the light soon.
“So I’m asking you...no. I am praying. Please. Help me get him back. I need him. I lo-” Dean cuts off, realizing he’s never said it aloud, not in these words, not this plainly. “I love him, Jack. And every single chance I had to tell him that, I was too much of a damn coward. I’m sorry for that. I’ll regret it til the day I die. But I need him back, so I can tell him what I should’ve told him when he needed me to.”
Sam Winchester’s voice may be grating at times, but in this moment it is the most beautiful sound he has ever heard.
Sam stares for a beat.
Jack interjects. “If I were to enter The Empty with the sole purpose of retrieving Cas, my presence might be seen as an act of violence. I’d be crossing a border, so to speak, and that is not something I can risk now that everything is finally in balance.”
What Dean doesn’t expect is how the expanse of smooth, tanned skin overwhelms him. He’s definitely seen Cas shirtless before, since they’ve been cohabitating for about six months now, but something is different. Maybe it’s the spill of red down his face, or the quiet panting. Dean’s hands itch to reach out and comfort and touch, and god, that keeps
Dean suddenly can’t breathe.
Dean crushes Cas to his torso so hard he can hear an audible
A molasses slow smile spreads across his grimy face. None of Alastair’s expressions are in the same galaxy as comforting, but this particular one sends the ever present chill shivering down Dean’s spine.
Cas looks anywhere but at Dean. His eyes skim from the busted mini fridge in the corner, to Sam’s duffel on the floor, to their muddy boots discarded in a pile. His own shoes are on the bed now, crossed at the ankle beside Dean’s bare toes. He flexes a heel absently into the blanket, and thinks that if it were Sam putting his shoe-clad feet on relatively clean linens, Dean would shove his brother onto the floor. In fact, he's seen such an encounter. ("I know you weren't raised in a barn, Sammy, so get those boots off my bed!" Followed by a thump of over six feet of Winchester hitting the ground.) It warms something deep in Castiel's chest that Dean doesn’t do the same to him.
He did this to Cas.
Castiel remembers, underneath the intense burst of dopamine, that he has never been kissed. He’s also never before understood the human obsession with the action, as a sign of affection or as a physical representation of love.
Castiel is not alone in his mission. He is given command of a battalion of fearsome warriors and ruthless fighters. He can hold his own in that regard, of course. He would not have been selected for such a task if that were not the case. However, his primary role in this fight is that of a general. A strategist. A leader.
~~~~~
“...Dean?”
But he also thinks of the ways Cas has helped him since they met. Angel transit, healing,
He glances down at his watch, and promptly panics when he realizes he’s lost nearly ten minutes already. Of course time slips here, like it would in Purgatory. Of course this couldn’t be simple.
“I would’ve done something stupid to stop it,” Dean concludes.
Jack reads grimly through the passage. “Given the historic framework of this text, we can assume it’s bad.”
Cas pauses for a long moment, glances at Sam, and then calls out with a showboating bravado he definitely picked up from Dean, “...Put it on my tab.”
Cas!” Dean’s voice reverberates in the space.
When he looks up again, his eyes catch on the silver guardian angel dangling between them and Dean.
It doesn’t come.
With Dean’s boots still on and Cas stripped down to his wool socks, Dean’s got a solid two inches on the guy. His chin brushes Cas’s cheek, the scrape of stubble sending a shiver down his spine. He skims one hand up Cas’s side, accidentally brushing bare skin above his hip before quickly tucking the worn shirt back into place. His palm settles against Cas’s waist, and his other hand fumbles blindly ‘til their fingers tangle together. Cas’s other hand lands on Dean’s shoulder, his arm resting against Dean’s from wrist to elbow.
What am I supposed to do with that?”
“Here to try and steal one of my favorite playthings, are you?” Empty Castiel walks slowly closer. Dean doesn’t dare shift his position for fear of leaving the Cas on his lap exposed. “We do have ever so much fun together, you know.” The false innocence in the otherwise familiar voice sinks into venom. “Would you like to see?
He blasts ACDC. He runs the blender. He clunks around under the Impala’s hood. He turns on the TV, and the radio, and a random Youtube playlist. He even hits shuffle on Sam’s old ipod while he panic orders a white noise machine. Then he shuts everything off.
Jack shakes his head. “No.” Then he nods. “Well. Yes, the romantic attraction between you two was quite obvious, even to a being such as myself who is, technically speaking, an infant.” Dean stares. “But that’s not what I meant. I knew about his deal with The Empty.”
Dean spares a thought for his own bad influence. But then Cas laughs at some dumb line from the show, and he forgets what he was worrying about to begin with.
Cas stands, and Dean wordlessly extends his hand upward for him to take. Sam isn’t here to tease him, so he might as well accept the help.
Their lips meet for the first time in a bunker in Lawrence, Kansas, and it isn’t fireworks or confetti or a trumpet fanfare. It’s the quiet snapping of a twig in a dam, long since holding up too much weight. It’s the final puzzle piece that makes the whole picture fall into place. It is freedom and glory and love, quiet and simple like no one ever expects it to be.
Cas squeezes his eyelids shut one after the other, like he's testing his vision. “The hist’ry of human head drama is actually...quite fascinatin’.” Dean assumes he means trauma, but since all his words are blending together anyway, he doesn’t bother correcting him. It’s like being lectured by a stoned professor. “Didyoo know, the first medical burr holes were drilled into those who were behaving abnorm’lly in order to let out what people believed to be evil sp’rits?”
“That doesn’t mean I’m gonna leave you, Dean,” he reassures him. “Just because my life includes other people, you don’t mean any less to me.”
“So,” Dean starts awkwardly, voice too loud in the enclosed space. Cas doesn’t look up from his shoes, but his head tilts to show he’s listening. “How are you?”
Dean thinks.
“Yeah, you really are.” It’s not a lie, but it probably sounds like one. Dean can’t imagine what all this must feel like to Cas, with his only frame of reference being the cold, distant way angels perceive human feelings.
Dean thinks.
“Cas, buddy. It’s gonna be alright.” Dean isn’t sure if that’s true or not, but it’s what his friend needs to hear.
In order to save Dean Winchester, Castiel must first convince him of his humanity.
Dean muses for a long moment on how achingly beautiful Cas is, all lit up, before he remembers words exist and he should probably attempt some. "Why can't a cave just be a cave, huh? Everybody's gotta have a gimmick."
That time when Lisa had Billie Holiday piping through the living room, and had asked Dean to dance with her. How she’d placed his hand on the small of her back, and draped her own along the curve of his neck. How she’d nudged one foot between his and shifted them together, swaying at the hips. How he’d held her in his arms, moved with the music, and come very close to believing that what they had could actually last as long as the song didn’t end.
Dean cries out, jerking against the restraints. Alastair chuckles. “I’ve missed those pretty noises, gorgeous.” He twists the knife, drawing out a high pitched whine. “Thank god you’re all mine.”
“You misunnerstan’, I'm not opposed.” Cas mumbles. “Just, perhaps another time...when I...can actually breathe?”
“Ah, crap.”
So in Dean’s defense, he never would have sent Cas to cover the ghost’s flank if he’d
His forehead hits a stubbled chin.
And suddenly, Dean is-
Sam sees deep fatigue in those alien blue eyes. “Cas, you’re as beat as we are. We’re all on the run. I get the feeling you could use the rest, and we could definitely use the company.”
They arch against the pain, but Castiel maintains his grip and Dean finds himself immobilized in shock. The blackness swallows Castiel’s shoulder and then spreads across his wings. White, fluffy feathers twist and shrivel, blackness spilling like oil across massive joints and pinions. Darkly translucent rainbows reflect off the rough edges.
-lutely, you had to tell me!"
“You saved me,” Cas says, wonder in his eyes.
He faces Alastair.
Eventually, Dean wipes at his eyes with his sleeve and takes Cas by the tie for one more slow, delicious kiss. “We should go find Sam and Jack. I’ve been hogging you, and they’ll want their turn.”
It isn’t until they reach the chamber he has been searching for that Castiel realizes how long they’ve been fighting. A quick glance at his brethren indicate they are holding their own amongst the throng of demons.
“It’s a long story,” Dean says. “The cliffsnotes version? We got you out of The Empty. And…” Dean reveals the glowing vial around his neck sheepishly. “...we had to make you human to do it.”
Castiel has been briefed well. He must not touch the Righteous Man until the moment is right.
He removes the gauze patch, pushes back some strands of hair, and begins wiping at the blood. Head wounds gush a disproportionate amount, so Dean is relieved to find that once it’s mostly wiped away, the cut isn’t quite as wide as he feared. It is long though, stretching about six inches, starting at the top of Cas’s hairline, slicing diagonally through one eyebrow, and ending at the soft point below his temple. One inch over and the blow might've cracked his eye socket. As it stands, he'll develop some nasty bruising. He’s definitely lost a metric fuckton ton of blood, if his slight swaying and the pile of red-drenched rags are anything to go by.
“I should go-”
Cas ignores the jab. “Here, just...hook your hand behind my neck.” Dean does, and feels the rough scrape of concrete against his knuckles. “Good. That’s...better, that’s a stronger connection.”
Cas nods and falls quiet once again. Something desperate claws at the inside of Dean's ribs, anxious not to fall back into the painful silence.
Everyone assumes Hell is hot. “Fire and brimstone” and all that. And since humans prefer not to dwell on death and whatever horrors it may bring, they don’t put too much thought into disputing it. Besides, most people want to believe what they’re told. The commercialized image of the devil is one dressed in red with spiky horns, and yes, surrounded by fire. There’s even that billboard in Ohio that reads “HELL IS REAL” in enormous flaming letters. So, Hell must be hot. There’s no reason for people to think otherwise.
“Hello, Dean.”
Today is the day they descend. When they return, Dean Winchester’s work will begin.
“Shit, Cas,” he mutters, ducking his chin to hide the embarrassed flush of his face. “Warn a guy before he starts talkin’ bout his bodily functions.”
idea.
Dean didn’t know a silence could be so loud.
Jack looks him straight in the eye. “I heard your prayer. I know what you’re going to ask me, and before you do, I must clarify one very important thing. What exactly are your intentions towards Castiel?”
Like he’s floating, even as their toes bump and they stumble gracelessly.
His own fall from grace feels so much less dignified. Slower, lacking in clarity. Full of so much shame.
this, let alone explain it. “You, just...uh…”
“Yeah, dude, anyone would.”
“Shut up, Sam,” Dean mutters before meeting Cas’s eyes one final time and turning away. He shoves past his brother into the bathroom, barely stopping himself from slamming the door behind him. In the dusty mirror, he can see how brightly his cheeks are burning, and turns towards the shower to escape the sight. It feels a little unnecessary now that he’s been mojo’d clean, but he could use the warmth anyway.
“Hey! Just because I helped you kick Alastair’s ass doesn’t mean I’m coming with you!” Dean takes a deep breath. “I didn’t want to see you hurt just cause you came looking for me, but he wasn’t wrong. I am beyond fucked up. I have done worse things to souls down here than demons who’ve been around since the goddamn flood, alright? I am tarnished, broken, demon
Dean squeezes his eyes shut, and slaps his own hand over Castiel’s on his shoulder.
He’s gotten so used to Cas. His grumbled morning protests when Dean shakes him awake at check out time, his rumpled form dressed down in Dean's old AC/DC T-shirt, his warm presence against Dean’s shoulder as they bring his movie knowledge up to speed. He wouldn’t wish the horrors of humanity on him to begin with, but he’s glad Cas can’t go flitting off without warning anymore. Dean wants to keep that scruffy head in his rearview mirror, no matter what comes around the next bend.
Or, y'know. Your weird maybe-friends.
Dean wishes he could remember what it felt like to be warm. He hasn’t been able to conjure that memory in almost forty years.
The firm set of Cas's mouth twitches. “I'm alright.”
Three beers later, he’s tipsy and paying less attention. Dean seems to be holding his own anyway, letting a burly guy with tattoo sleeves and a mean looking mug kick his ass. Soon he'll play the innocent sore loser and up the bid to $400, and then he’ll narrowly win and get the hell out of dodge. Which means hopefully, they’ll get to stay in a slightly cleaner motel tomorrow night. This hustler formula is a classic John Winchester maneuver, one which both Sam and Dean could execute flawlessly by the time they were seventeen.
“If you insist,” Cas gives in, eyes dropping to his own knees. “A prayer doesn't have to be in words. If the emotion is strong enough, we can pick up on it without them. A feeling, a hope, or a yearning can be enough when the need is dire.”
“Don’t.”
No one warns you when a profound bond is about to change your life. Perhaps if someone did, this story wouldn’t turn out the way it does.
Cas looks like he’s revealed more than he intended, and averts his eyes.
“Bad like it would kill Cas bad?” Sam asks. Dean shoots him a grateful look, since he doubts he’d have been able to ask that himself.
By the time he reaches the eyebrow, Cas is shaking profusely and beaded with sweat. There are two inches left, but something tells Dean to pause. He ties off the knot and sets the needle driver on the table, reaching back up to push a hand through Cas’s hair. It’s still saturated with blood and will need a good wash, but that can wait until tomorrow. “We're not quite done, but I think you need a break.”
Dean realizes with a start that their faces are incredibly close. Cas lays a shaky hand over Dean’s, pressing it harder against his own cheek.
Cas rolls his head to the side and looks at Dean sprawled across the backseat. “This is one of the few ways I remain useful, so I’m happy to help.”
Dean feels wrong-footed suddenly. “Why wouldn’t I help you, Cas?”
And then Dean is kissing an angel in a rainbow cave in the middle of purgatory, while the friendly neighborhood vampire keeps a lookout for incoming monsters.
A deep, sonorous voice echoes from the source of the light. Dean doesn’t hear it ringing in his eardrums so much as he feels it vibrating through the air, pulsing in his chest like a subwoofer. It strikes him as reminiscent of the heartbeat Dean hasn’t felt in so long.
He feels warmth open behind him.
“Sorry,” Dean mumbles, rubbing at his ear. “What?”
“Yes, Dean, it hurts.” Cas bites out. “Four thousand pounds of concrete collapsed on my spine. It feels like…” His eyes glaze over. “It feels.”
Dean steps over another root and jostles the body in his arms as hard as he dares. He’s rewarded with a low moan.
“I suggest you leave this town,” he says. “The participants of that pub brawl will be regaining consciousness soon, and they might be looking for you and your brother.”
Cas pushes off Dean’s hands. “I don’wannit, I don’...Oh,
“My intentions?”
He trails off, so Sam finishes his sentence. “You want Cas.”
~~~~~
He listens to Dean’s heartbeat. Strong, steady, and singing, just like his soul. As an angel, Castiel used to be able to see a soul shining beyond the confines of one's body. Now, without his grace, the gentle glimmer that once surrounded Dean has vanished. A great pity, since Dean's soul is the most beautiful sight Castiel has ever beheld. He hopes that Dean won't tell him to go before he finds a way to glimpse it one final time.
“I’ve been waiting to do that for forty years.”
Dean exhales hard. “Okay.”
But today is different. Today, a third party joins their pilgrimage. For months now, Dean has whipped his head towards anything tan in his periphery, hoping he might find that stupid trench coat. Now that it and its owner are walking close enough for Dean to touch if he stretches out his hand, his brain can’t quite tell up from down. Which is fine by him, because he wouldn’t know what to say even if he had the courage to open his mouth.
Dean looks back at the nightmare as shallowly as he dares. “No, I don’t...I don’t think I did. I couldn’t remember shit. Alastair had me convinced I had never left to begin with, which means I didn’t even know you yet. I definitely wasn’t clear headed enough to have used your name.”
“Lost causes? No way, you’re joking.”
“Dean. Everywhere I turn, I feel like I’m bracing for impact. Heaven struck me down and I’m still falling more and more, every day. Now I’m constantly bombed...b-bombarded by human needs, feelings, desires. And monsters keep
Dean holds up the vial to the cut in Cas’s neck, and tries not to think about this part. “I really am sorry.” He mutters the strange, ancient words he’d memorized earlier and they taste like electricity on his tongue. He thinks he’s butchered some of them, but the slice in Cas’s throat begins to glow anyway.
He has to will himself into the right place.
“That’s not true,” Cas rumbles, irritation in his voice, and presses long fingers to a spot on Dean’s torso.
Cas steps in and tilts his face til their noses brush and his breath puffs against Dean's lips. "Physical presence, check. Heartbeat, present and accounted for." Dean collapses against him in relief, their foreheads meeting. He slides a thumb up to run along the glowing rainbow resting on Cas's bottom lip.
Dean pauses thoughtfully. “I'm actually not, no.” He boops a finger on Cas’s nose, and gets the strange pleasure of watching him go briefly crossed-eyed trying to watch. “Let’s avoid drilling holes in your skull though, okay? Just stay awake ‘til we get back.”
That puts a frown on Cas’s face, but he ducks his head to hide it. “Do you still require sleep here?”
"I don’ like the way this feels.”
that.” Cas pushes off the wall with one foot, and squares his shoulders to Dean. “This was neither your doing nor your fault. It was safer for you without me, that is a fact. So I made a choice based on what I thought was best: I stayed away. But please, Dean,
Maybe they are.
Sam and Jack share uneasy glances, but they know Dean is right.
Dean sighs, but does it. Cas looks a bit constipated as he tries to shift them again, but Dean has the good sense to know it’s not the time to joke about it. Especially when they don’t move.
God or no God, he has faith enough in that.
Dean stifles a sob. “Hey, Cas.”
A strange sound bubbles up and it takes Dean a second to realize it’s a delirious laugh. “I won’t tell ‘nother soul.”
“Dean!”
He gasps upright in a motel bed, bile souring the back of his throat.
“Dean!” Sam yells, just as Jack yells “Cas!” They both drop to their knees next to the pile of tangled limbs. Cas immediately starts coughing, and blood begins to spray from his neck.
A meaty hand grabs him by the ear, and roughly hauls him around so they’re face to face. Dean swallows a shout. Apprentice or not, he can still be punished for making too much noise.
figuring it out, Dean means Cas.
“I don’t think I’ve ever danced,” Cas announces.
Dean sighs loudly.
“The interstitial space between us is closer to my cerebral cortex.” Dean doesn’t think he’d be able to understand those words in that order even with all his blood still inside his body. “Now brace yourself. I’ll shift us above ground, laterally from the building.”
“So you can’t have him, you son of a bitch.”
Dean thinks, with a kind of confidence he doesn't recognize.
“That's mine. I ‘pologize.” Cas looks down to where Dean's arms hang by his sides. "You've got my blood on your hands."
, I have the patience of a literal saint. If you drop me, I will smite you."
“How come?”
“We both have to be human to pass through the rift.” Dean manages to keep his voice steady. “So...” he waits a beat, hoping one of them will piece it together before realizing if he’s too cowardly to say it, he probably can’t do it, and that is just not an option.
Cas runs his thumb over Dean’s lips.
He isn’t expecting Cas to grab his wrist when he goes to step away.
“I can’t tell you how relieved I am that you’re here. Of course, because we missed you, but also because I really need your help, man. We gotta-”
“Wait,” says Dean. Cas looks over quizzically. “I gotta say one more thing.” He breathes deep, and Cas waits patiently. God, no one has ever been as patient with Dean as this angel in his arms.
Castiel had disappeared without an answer.
Alastair watches him with sickening pride. “You’re the real thing, kid. And since you’ve done such excellent work, we’re gonna bump up your promotion.”
Dean rolls his head sideways so he can give him a look. Definitely didn't study for the practical. “Joke, Cas. That was a joke.”
“Jack, you mind?” Dean asks, and Jack places two fingers to Cas’s forehead. The blood vanishes, and the wound heals over.
Dean hasn’t allowed himself to think about Cas’s final moments these past few months. He’d hung the jacket with that bloody handprint in the back of his closet with care and has refused to look at it since. He says nothing of Cas’s...confession, to his brother. He takes the memories and pushes them deep inside his mind, under Sam and Eileen and Mira. The nightmares that wake him in tears are of Cas dying, but he must be good at training his brain, because they show him all the
Dean shatters.
No going back now.
“Just tell me, man. I’m already in the
“You're alive.”
Cas shrinks, color rising in his cheeks. “You don’t need to say anything.” He tries to disentangle his arms from Dean’s, but Dean holds him tighter.
over and over. Dean will roll his eyes, brush it off, and deflect away from the hot rush of blood in his cheeks with some crack at Sam’s outfit.
The pressure he’s been shoving down all this time feels like it’s about to crack his sternum in half. And Sam is asleep, and Cas is...whatever he is, so maybe here, in the dark, only if he closes his eyes, maybe he could just…
No, he had very much not forgotten about Jack’s recent promotion. But since Jack went poof, he hadn’t considered its relevance.
Dean bites his lip, and takes another swig of whiskey to hide the burn of his cheeks.
His brain screeches to a halt.
“That’s it, sweetheart, nice and slow.”
“He was standing approximately thirty feet behind us at the moment of collapse. I cannot sense him nearby anymore, so I assume he escaped unscathed and went to seek help.”
The guy isn’t
Cas gives him a look that says,
Cas insists that he’s fine when the paramedics get too close. His back took most of the damage, so he is sure to keep it angled away from them to strengthen the ruse. But with Dean nearing critical condition, no one presses Cas about treatment protocols too hard. He just watches as they strap Dean to a stretcher, hook him up to wires, and hoist him into the rig. There’s a restless kind of rumbling in Cas's stomach at the sight, one that might be shame but he’ll call nausea.
A burst of what looks like black lighting shoots from the center of the mark. It climbs maybe 8 ft into the air, crackling with electricity and casting shadows where Dean would expect light.
“That’s not up to you, sweetheart.” Empty Alastair strokes a cold finger down Dean’s cheek. Dean briefly considers biting his hand. “He made a deal. All I did was hold up my end.”
He feels along each rib, noting which spots make Cas wince. Nothing is cracked, so he kneels closer and presses the KT tape on hard while Cas hides his face in Dean’s shoulder. Dean fights the urge to find and shoot whoever invented Tylenol for deciding it should take this long to kick in.
Seeing Sam happy with Eileen keeps things fun. The three of them spend more and more time together, and an easy dynamic develops. She teaches them the basics of ASL for when the lights are too dim to lip read. She politely sits through Dean’s western movies even when Sam conks out with his head on her shoulder. She destroys Sam at Scrabble, while he sputters and Dean cackles at the sight. Mira sprawls out on top of them all whenever she can, warm and soft and cozy.
“All you’ve got to do is listen for the rhythm, ‘kay?” Dean presses at Cas’s back minutely, shifting them to one side, and then the other. “Keep your weight on the balls of your feet, and let it carry up to the rest of you. Then just...shift, back and forth, to the beat.”
Dean knows they’ve pivoted towards the elephant in the room. “What don’t you want?”
“Alright,” Cas mutters, schooling his features into careful blankness. “If I can’t move us, I’m at least going to try and heal some of the broken blood vessels in your arm. You’re far too pale.”
Dean cries out.
The rough saw of his voice is lacking the bass that shakes through Dean’s skull most days. It’s breathier, higher pitched, like someone flipped off his subwoofer. Dean closes his eyes for a moment and remembers the stoic gravel-gargling SOB who walked into that barn, and considers how little he resembles the man before him now. This Cas gave up everything he had ever known just because he believed in Dean, and Dean said this was worth dying for. True humanity, in all its glorious raw edges and beautiful imperfections. But also in its horror and pain. Cas is hurt and scared and rejected by his
Cas cocks his head, listening to the shift from one jazz arrangement to another. He narrows his eyes at Dean, a mischievous twinkle glittering in rings of blue. “Have you?”
It is
“Everyone I’ve ever loved has either betrayed me or died.”
Fuck, fuck, fuck, it is too quiet and he can’t take it anymore.
He slides his hands into Dean’s hair and kisses him again, and again, and again. He spares one corner of his brain to imagine a world in which they never have to come up for air.
After too long, Cas does grunt and peer back up. His eyes are glassy. Dean considers his options. “Okay. Okay, I’m gonna do something I haven’t done in years, alright? I used to, uh...well, I used to sing to Sammy, when he was sick or hurt. So he could focus on my voice instead of the pain.”
“No, I knew that,” Sam mutters. Dean’s eyes widen. “I just didn’t...”
~~~~~
He will be truly useless here once his powers to protect, defend, and heal are gone for good. Sam is the greatest human lore researcher Castiel has ever met, so his own encyclopedic knowledge will prove unnecessary. Dean can hold his own in a fight against nearly any creature, provided his arm heals properly and they don’t battle any more falling concrete in the future. And they have each other. Neither of the boys have ever truly needed anything else as long as that part remained true.
“I’ve missed you too, Dean,” says Jack, pulling back so they’re eye to eye.
warning: I may make you wait a few more days for the final installment, mostly because I'm doing some rewrites and partially because I'm evil and want to let you stew.
sound escaping him. He lifts one hand to run it down his face, and leaves it there to cover his eyes. It’s childish and sweet, and also hits Dean like a brick to the gut. Like Cas can make the pain go away by refusing to see it.
Light bursts into the room. Dean and Alastair are both knocked to the floor in a powerful blast, shielding their eyes from the sudden blinding radiance.
“Your temperature is elevated, but not so much so that I would recommend hospitalization.” Dean feels Cas press a strong thumb into the tense muscles at the top of his spine before draping the washcloth around his nape. Dean bites his lip to keep a relieved sound from escaping his throat. “I would suggest rest, increased fluid intake, and whatever simple carbohydrates you can manage to keep down.”
Cas breathes easy, and Dean cups his face just in time to see the ocean sunrise of his eyes opening.
The Angel reaches out, as if to press his palm directly over Dean’s heart. With the fire of self hatred coursing through his veins, Dean twists to avoid it.
He doesn’t know quite what to expect. He’s seen all corners of Hell, and many versions of Heaven. He can’t quite picture the vast blackness of The Empty. How do you imagine nothing?
After all, Cas is the one who discovered the missing piece of the puzzle earlier that afternoon - that the cabin they need to burn must actually be two some odd miles east of where it’s marked. This means he should get a piece of the action, and remind himself why they do what they do.
“Good idea,” Sam nods. He tilts his head towards the passenger seat. “Aren’t you...joining us?”
Right. Dean braces himself and turns to look at the arm that had burned like lava moments ago, and has now dulled to a throbbing ache. It’s-
“Then I guess I’ve got no choice but to teach you. Prove my word and defend my honor.”
Cas reaches out and touches the vial of grace, his eyes wide. As his fingertip makes contact with the glass, Dean hears that deep satisfying
He can't name this feeling, this need to carry something in his arms like it’s precious. Not just because letting go would mean something horrible, but because having it and holding it forever could mean something miraculous.
“But for the first time, I think...I think I want a life that looks a little different. I want a real house. I want a 9-5 with a steady paycheck. I want to learn to bake mom’s cherry pie.” Dean swallows hard. “And I look at you and Eileen. I see you being the center of someone else’s world for once, and I hear the silence in this bunker, and I want a partner. But more than that, I want…”
the word “happy.”
Cas rolls his eyes. “I was planning on it, but I needed you conscious. My hands are a bit preoccupied, in case you hadn’t noticed.” The biting sarcasm would make Dean proud in any other circumstance. “I can’t hold onto you like this. If I’m going to shift us both through space, you’ll have to hold onto me instead, or there’s a chance I’d accidentally leave you behind.”
He doesn’t expect Cas to move even closer, and he definitely doesn’t expect him to bring one of his large hands to Dean’s jaw, sliding back to cradle the nape of his neck. Dean inhales in surprise, and gets a whiff of Cas’s scent. He smells the way his voice sounds - dark, earthy, and ancient. A little bit electric.
Sam waits for him to go on.
Things are honestly going...okay. Dean wonders if he’s jinxed them for even considering it, but they’ve settled into a pattern that works. The Devil is strangely quiet for now, Sam is back to being his regular bitchy self, they’re working normal cases like the old days. And having Cas around is, if he’s being honest, actually really awesome.
Cas doesn’t say anything. His glazed look makes Dean think he isn’t really listening anymore.
don’t move. Just hang in there, Cas. You’re doing great.” Dean strokes a thumb over the quivering muscles of the leg in his hands.
“Because it was to save me,” says Jack, “I owed Cas my life, and he wished to keep it a secret from you.”
“Dean, will you do something f’r me?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Maybe that’s the point.
If anyone feels inspired to draw fluffy whumpy fan art for my stories, I will 100% cry tears of joy.
He watches bits of it flake away from the creases in his knuckles on the steering wheel. Their attempt to return to normal hunting feels a little pointless now that the Apocalypse has been kickstarted, but they both need the distraction. He and Sam are silent on the drive back to the motel. It’s been a long time since they fought a whole nest of vamps, and bad intel had left them significantly outnumbered. They eventually managed to snag the upper hand, with minimal bruising underneath their layers of grime and flannel. A glance at his little brother dozing in the passenger seat confirms Dean’s theory: they’re both okay, or some approximation of it. Just too tired to talk.
“Are you trying to tell me you’re not an angel anymore?”
“Alright, Castiel, why do you keep calling me The Righteous Man?”
“Someone, please help me.” Dean gasps, eyes closed against the onslaught of pain and Alastair’s sharp laugh in his ear. “I’m beggin’ you, someone, please
“That sounds extremely unpleasant.”
Dean blushes at the combined praise and insult.
an ugly piece of him whispers. He shoves it away.
Benny steps closer to Dean and whispers, “Y’all go figure out your shit, man. It ain’t safe for you to be this distracted.”
“Dean.” Cas’s voice sounds far away, echoing in a way that has nothing to do with the stone sounding board surrounding them.
"Shut up."
Dean pulls out the pill bottle and goes to fill a disposable paper cup with water from the bathroom. When he gets back, Cas has his head dropping backwards over the chair. “No, no, eyes open. C’mon, up you get.” Dean slides a hand behind Cas’s neck, and lifts him into a more upright position. “You gotta elevate that head. And keep your breathing even and shallow if you can, it’ll help with the rib pain.”
This time, with Cas, he finds himself wishing it won’t end just because it feels so right.
“Shit,” Dean says aloud. Weirdly, the sound bounces back at him.
In some ways.
They meet for the second time in a barn. It's a Thursday in September, and while autumn air blows a chill through the slats of wood, it is far warmer now than it was at their initial meeting.
Sam raises his eyebrows. “Is that it?”
spare the juice, huh? Hey, as long as you don’t accidentally smite me, that’d be great.” Cas steps forward once more and presses two fingers to his burning forehead.
But before that, of course, they must find him.
The rancid, rotting hunk of myocardium behind Dean’s sternum breaks. He’d call it a heart, but it stopped beating like one ages ago.
Cas struggles to get his buckling legs under him, and Sam helps by propping his back against the solidity of the car. “I’m sorry,” Cas says, weirdly winded. “I didn’t think...oh, that weakened me far more than I expected.”
thoughts? predictions? favorite lines?
He has lost people before and he will lose people again. This is normal. It’s grief. It’s being human. He has Sammy and he has his own kitchen and he has a life ahead of him that is his to control.
~~~~~
Sam blocks his path. “Dean, stop! Use your brain, here. You’re not going to drink yourself into a coma when there are actual things to be done!”
~~~~~
Something stops him.
Humans in hell have a tendency to disintegrate over time. Demons are formed once the soul burns out of someone, past the point of no return. Once the heart gives up hope entirely, the demonic spirit takes over and the human soul is beyond saving.
Not because of your powers, and not because you’re useful. Just because you’re
For a Winchester, stranger things have happened.
But Dean might be.
The impact he’s expecting comes from the wrong direction. Dean snags him around the waist and pulls him back securely against his chest. A hiss escapes Cas's teeth at the pressure on his aching ribs, but there is a deep security in this touch, surety in the firmness of the hands around him. After millenia of existence, Castiel has never felt more safe than in the arms of Dean Winchester.
Once Sam is content his brother isn’t going to drop dead, he seems to remember Cas is there.
If it was the real ground, he’d have broken his nose for how hard he faceplants. As it stands, he gets a mouthful of shifty dusty darkness, and peers around to see what he tripped on.
“It’s true. Even when demons aren’t present in a situation, their shadow finds a way to, um...wreck? No. Wreak. Wreak havoc on human life. Or perhaps in the bigger picture of this case, accident’ly inspire med’cal breakthroughs.”
“I remember screaming for help. For someone to get me out.” In an attempt to lighten the mood, Dean snaps and points finger guns at Cas like he’s giving him his cue. It doesn’t work. He concentrates instead on the warmth of Cas’s hip, inches from his own ear, and finds it grounding.
Dean strides through the wooded path as quickly as he dares, trying to triage Cas’s comfort level against how fast he needs to get him patched up. The Impala is parked on the edge of the local trail, and their motel is a fifteen minute drive past that. He hates to make the pain any worse by rushing, but he is really not handling injured Cas very well. Something about that face gasping in agony and drenched in blood shocks Dean to his core, and he just needs to fix it, like, yesterday.
A few minutes later he hears footsteps, and groans.
Cas looks conflicted for a moment, but before Dean can ask him what’s wrong, he moves.
“Dean,” Sam fixes him with a gentle glare. “You know what he means. Cas made a deal, he technically belongs to The Empty.”
Jack smiles at him. Sam nods.
Which is why Dean can’t see the strain on Cas’s face as he reaches for the tiny spark of grace still rattling in his solar plexus, nor can he see how the glow of light shakes as Cas banishes the impinging nightmares. He doesn’t notice that the angel loses consciousness just as swiftly as his human charge.
“Wait, how did you even know to come help me?” Dean notices with a start. “I couldn’t remember anything but Hell, there’s no way I dream-dialed you.”
He rips it off the rearview, rolls down the window, and hurls it onto the asphalt.
A rush of tenderness swallows Dean whole. Something darker follows it. A flash of rage, or maybe rejection. Those feelings he never lets out have been simmering in his chest all day, building a jenga tower of delicate composure behind his sternum. It threatens to choke him if he doesn’t let it come tumbling out.
But with Sam gone half the time, things are
Dean inhales against the swell of affection in his chest. He feels the urge to touch Cas again, to run more fingers through his hair. Instead, he forces both hands back onto the steering wheel.
enormous wings arcing from the creature’s broad shoulders. They are pure white with sharp pointed feathers, gleaming silver at the tips. Dean gets the impression he could press a finger to the edge of one and draw blood like Sleeping Beauty on her spinning wheel.
“Alright, buddy, hang in there.” Dean pulls onto the dirt road, one hand on the wheel and the other pressing down on the makeshift bandage. Cas keeps shifting his neck as if to move away from the painful pressure, but Dean doesn’t let him. “Hey, eyes open. If you fall asleep right now, you might not wake up.”
He swallows. “Cas, about what you said. About how you feel. Before we...I have to-”
Cas yells in frustration and worry. He has never felt so engulfed in feeling. Pain and fatigue sing in his muscles while he hangs onto desperate, dogged faith that Dean will not die here.
Castiel pauses. Dean can’t make out any of his three expressions, but he gets the sense that all of them are seeing straight through him.
Alastair whistles. “Man, you sure know how to sweet talk a guy. Anyway, as I was saying. Dean here ain’t your Righteous Man, and he sure as hell ain’t goin’ nowhere. Isn’t that right?”
it looks. The foot is bent at an unnatural angle, and the shin bones are jutting out way further than usual. A light sweep of his fingers confirms that nothing is broken, just that it's been violently wrenched out of place. The skin around the joint is beginning to flush an ugly purple, but despite the swelling Dean can see how he’ll have to pull to get it back where it belongs.
thanks for sticking with me this far.
Cas goes on anyway. "But that's not all. Then you said ‘If you’ve got the angel and you’re hearing this, I am coming for him. And I’d like to see you black-hearted bastards try and stop me.’ Your determination gave me the strength to keep fighting. To, uh...stow my crap, so to speak, and smite the creature.”
“You might be falling, Angel, but like hell if I’m gonna let you hit the ground.”
He exhales shakily. “Sammy,” Dean breathes, “I don’t know how....or what...I-I can’t just…” Dean runs a hand through his hair, flattened on one side from crashing on the table. “How am I supposed to just...move on? After-”
“No, any
Dean is about to turn and tell Cas to leave him alone in his misery when something blessedly cold touches the back of his neck. His breath catches, and without lifting his forehead from the seat, he peeks sideways. Cas has collected a washcloth from the cupboard above the sink and is now gently wiping cool water over Dean’s clammy skin. He’s kneeling on the floor of a motel bathroom like it’s an altar, lowering himself to Dean’s curtailed height so he can feel his forehead with the other palm. The tenderness in his hands leaves Dean's brain short circuiting; these are hands he has seen stab and smite.
“No, it is
“Uh, no, just a beer for me, thanks.” Sam gives Dean a look. He doesn’t budge.
Dean doesn’t know.
Cas presses his neck back into Dean’s hand and squeezes his eyes shut. Dean focuses on his crushed arm, hoping this might work, but knowing in his gut that it won’t. A beat passes and the pain does not drain away. The blackness at the edge of his vision continues to swell.
“For the record, I’ve never been more happy to be wrong.”
An enormous creak shakes the ground above them. Cas lets out a gasp as rocks shift and slide. The weight on his back suddenly lightens by half, but the abrupt change is enough to shock his muscles into failure. His elbows buckle and he dives to protect Dean’s head as the remaining concrete crushes them together.
Dean closes his eyes, almost sure it’s less disorienting then uselessly keeping them open, and walks forward. The text Jack had found had given vague instructions to navigating The Empty. It stretched infinitely in all directions, so Dean couldn’t exactly turn left at the fourteenth shadow.
Then Dean waits.
to put more distance between them. Dean has fantasized about his mouth on Cas’s skin before, and despite their current fumbling it’s far better in waking hours. “Just relax, let me lead.” His hand slides up to the dip of Cas’s spine, and he shifts to hold Cas’s weight more firmly against his own. The room spins, and it isn’t just from the alcohol or their leisurely spiral. It's as if the whole world is turning way too fast, and the centrifugal force that binds it all together meets at the axis where their chests press flush.
“I mean it, Dean, I don't expect anything from you, and I’m grateful for the rescue, but I’m under no impression that it means y-”
, my brilliant partner in editing and a dear, dear friend.
C’mon, it's simple. Repeat it with me.”
“Well, what if I’m not?” Dean shouts. “There’s barely any human left in me! I am everyone’s worst nightmare, myself included. Monsters belong down here. You need a Righteous Man for your big heavenly plans? Guess what, I’m not your guy!”
Cas pulls his best bitch face and grips the juncture of Dean’s neck and shoulder harder than he needs to. He begins to sway along with Dean just as a warbling voice starts in with the lyrics.
Dean doesn’t remember why his eyes are closed to begin with. They do feel dry and grainy beneath his lids. He thinks about the time 6-year-old Sammy kicked sand in his face at that beach in Virginia. He'd made it up to his half-blinded brother by building him a lopsided sand castle. Dumb kid was so cute before he hit his growth spurt. Man, he’d kill for a beach vacation.
Slowly, with just enough flare for it to be obvious he’s playing it up, Dean bows at the waist. He extends a hand towards Cas with a flourish, palm up, fingers loosely outstretched. He lifts his brows in question.
“Anywhere but here.” Dean grips tighter to the tendons beneath his palm, and waits for the accompanying nausea of angelic transport.
Dean throws his hands up. “What is wrong with you? He dropped a bombshell on me, that he
Sam drops his overnight bag in his room, collects a glass of water and a bottle of ibuprofen, and returns to the main room. Mira is snoozing under the table, and lifts her head when he approaches. Sam gently shakes Dean’s shoulder.
“I’m sorry, Cas. I should’ve known.” Dean gulps. “I should’ve...oh, fuck."
“No, I knew you loved him too,” said Sam, making deliberate eye contact. “I just didn’t know
Either someone hears his call, or the Winchester boys simply have impeccable dramatic timing. Given Castiel’s current feud with Heaven and the brothers’ history of near misses, he is inclined to believe the latter.
~~~~~
Dean will then self-consciously pull his hand away from the warmth of Cas's bruised ribs. When Cas stirs and rolls over to see why, their eyes will meet, and an avalanche of questions will spill between them.
"I'm just saying, you can't quote a man to himself like a song you've known by heart for years, and then pretend it's no big deal."
One hundred and thirty nine stitches, two titanium rods, four screws, and one cast stretching from palm to shoulder later, Dean is laid up in his own private hospital room. The medication he was given in surgery should keep him unconscious for the next six hours or so. Sam managed to get Cas discharged with some flirting and forged signatures, but he couldn’t convince him to return to their motel room to rest. Instead, Cas sits by Dean’s bedside and listens to his heart monitor.
Cas remains still, curled into the corner of his armchair like he sprouted out of the leather overnight. His glass, the last dregs of whiskey pooling at the bottom, rests against his knee, which is currently clad in Dean’s old sweatpants. His mouth has dropped open slightly, clearly stunned by this turn of events and not quite sure how to react.
“Cas, hey, Cas,” Dean kneels above the angel and carefully turns him over onto his back. He cannot help but cradle Cas’s face in his hands, and stroke a thumb over his cheekbone. “I’m gonna get you out of here, okay?” Dean doesn’t think Cas can hear him, but it just feels so damn good to say. “We’re going home.”
Dean extricates his wrist. “Well, that last one is kind of an occupational hazard, man.” He reaches for the blanket folded at the end of the bed and sits facing Cas to spread it over his bare chest.
Sam begins to protest, and stops.
Dean picks up on the pause, on whatever Cas is clearly trying not to say. “What exactly did you hear if I wasn’t prayin’ in words?”
“Yeah, tough shit.”
Dean freezes.
in him, then he never would’ve gotten off that rack. Not if it meant becoming the thing he most despises.
Dean can’t help but glance at Cas’s lips. Soft pink, perpetually chapped. He wonders...
Just like Mom used to sing.”
“Like, I was embarrassed to be in the same room with you two most days.”
“I’m still here,” Sam points out.
Cas, inhibitions drained out with half his blood volume, places a hand over Dean’s heart. “I used to be able to heal you with a touch. I had the power of Heaven at my fingertips. Now I can’t hunt a measly ghost without-” Cas spits out a little blood into his cupped palm.
“Cas.”
“Oh, c’mon, Sam-”
He extricates his hand, checking for fingernail marks, and unpacks their well-loved first aid kit from his duffel. “But you’re new to the human pain thing, so we’re gonna take it easy with some Tylenol. Not ibuprofen! That can act as a blood thinner, so you never take it with a head wound, okay?”
Dean focuses on the heads, specifically the light fanning out above them. It’s like an optical illusion, where he can tell there’s a picture there but can only see it from the exact right angle.
“Thank you, Dean.”
Cas glares.
Dean rubs his thumb over Cas’s jaw. “Hey, just breathe, it’s okay.”
Dean shoots him a look. “What, I gotta ask for permission before I hit the hard stuff?” It comes out a little nastier than he intends. He sighs at his own tone, and rubs fingers along the bridge of his nose. “Fuck,
They’re both human now. They want this. And maybe, despite the mistakes they've made, despite the cosmic bullshit and the fated battles and everything else that promises to destroy them somewhere down the line…
“Dean!”
“My true form likely wouldn’t allow for the type of movement dancing requires anyway.” Cas goes on as if he hasn’t just earnestly and calmly set Dean’s pulse racing twice its resting speed. “What is that phrase? The bigger they are, the harder they fall? If I had tried to dance, I probably would've fallen pretty hard. And since taking
Because if he is a good person, if he has one ounce of true, gracious
He flicks his eyes back to Cas and bites his tongue. The angel flushes anyway.
But if it keeps Cas awake, and more importantly makes him smile, then the one man show must go on.
He had prayed for a miracle.
He and Sam have been patching each other up for decades, and there’s an unspoken understanding about it between them. Pain is inevitable; apologies and platitudes won’t make it go away. They do what needs to be done and leave it at that. It’s been a while since Dean has bothered trying to comfort someone he actually knows, and it’s harder than he remembers. So many of the consoling phrases he could resort to,
“I know you said you were gonna be hands off, Jack. And I respect that, I really do. No matter what happens from here on out, you know you’re our family and we will always be proud of you.” Dean takes a bracing breath.
He gives in to the itch that’s lived under his skin all night, hell, all
~~~~~
The staring contest resumes. It bothers Dean's neck from this angle, but he doesn't want to look away.
“Yeah, well, no big deal,” Dean shrugs, “I figure now we’re even.”
“Of course. Why wouldn’t I?”
Cas refuses to hunt with them. Once they ease back into it, he makes it clear that he’s only interested in the research side of things. He dances around the subject for a while before admitting that being out in the field in his "current state" (yes, air quotes included) won’t end well. They don’t push him. Sam is ecstatic to have another nerd on the team, a partner with whom to pore over dusty tomes and obscure lore. Dean mocks them, but feels grateful to be off book duty while his brother and their not-quite-angel dig up all the info they need.
but Cas is so warm and he doesn't
“How do you humans cope with-
“Yeah, of course.”
Jack shakes his head. “I don’t think it would kill him, but there is a chance it would nullify the rest of the spell. It could simply close the rift, effectively trapping you both in there.”
“Oh,” Dean mutters. His voice comes out oddly calm, given the blasphemy that’s just powered up a light bulb above his head.
“This is our move,” Dean says, swallowing against the lump in his throat. “Now let’s bring him home.”
“I’m tired." Cas refuses to meet his gaze even as he answers. Dean briefly contemplates homicide. "I suspect we’ve had similar experiences in our time here.” He nods his chin towards the cave entrance and the vampire standing outside it. “You found...an
“Dean?” Cas asks, and he snaps out of his reverie. Cas is sporting that little furrow between his brows. God, he’s always so concerned. Dean wishes he weren’t, wishes he didn’t have reason to be.
A silence passes as they stare at one another.
“Okay. So. Um, dancing.” Dean looks down at his feet, hyperaware that he barely knows how to
Distress flashes through Cas’s eyes, and he dips his chin in understanding.
“Hell.” Dean only manages to squeeze out a whisper. He looks at Cas again, inexplicably nervous that the angel will flutter off and leave him in this vulnerable moment, broken open and all alone. But Cas looks on steadily, patiently. God, he’s always so patient with Dean. More so than Dean deserves, that’s for damn sure.
Dean breathes deep. In for a penny, in for a pound. “But there’s a chance it could work?”
“Okay, okay, stop!” Dean presses his hand more firmly against Cas’s sternum, ignoring the pain in his other arm as he budges. “Fuck, stop moving. Jesus.”
Instead, Cas simply twists at the hips and flips the man over his head, smashing him to the ground like it’s nothing. The crash echoes through the bar, and tussles and yelling die down. Everyone turns to stare at the slight man who’s just destroyed three much bigger guys, leaving a wake of carnage in the form of groaning goons and splintered floorboards.
Cas places his own hand on top of Dean’s, and his lips quirk in an honest-to-god giggle. Dean’s hackles rise defensively.
That earns him the patented squint-and-tilt. “You prayed to me.”
Cas closes his eyes and flexes his shoulders slightly in appraisal. “Approximately four thousand.”
Castiel attempts to set aside his own offputting reaction. It must be a mistake, as his kind do not
Dean’s eyes flash around the grimy chamber. His head spins as most of his blood decorates the floor. If it weren’t for the rack propping him up, he’d have fallen to his knees by now. He knows this place, too well, he…
“I know, man, I know, but stay awake anyway. We’re not far now.”
Dean rolls his eyes at the Star Wars reference, still too angry to let the pride at Cas’s successful pop culture allusion derail him. “I know you know. Ugh, can't believe you could hear me all along. You dick."
“Dean,” Sam says calmly. He waits until his brother sheepishly meets his gaze. “I know you’ve been having nightmares about Cas.”
Sam eventually nuts up and finds the courage to go see Eileen. Dean drives him there, feeling a bit like a chauffeur dropping Sam off at his middle school dance. But he can’t help the smile that spreads across his face when he watches Eileen run down her front steps and jump into Sam’s arms. They swing in a full circle before her feet touch the ground and their lips meet. He leaves them to it after that and heads home to Mira and an ice cold six pack. Dean can’t get many details out of him about the reunion the next day, but Sam looks happy, and a faint hickey pokes out along the collar of his shirt. Dean smirks and wiggles his brows at his eye rolling baby brother, but otherwise doesn’t comment.
not a demon.
Fuck, is this crooner from the ‘30s reading his mind or something?
tonight.
“Not tonight, Sam. But I’ll be back to see you two soon.” He nods curtly and vanishes.
They do fit together, after all. It just takes a little work.
He stops suddenly, a flush rising in his cheeks.
Dean purses his lips and drawls. “Aw, Cas, media companies have bumped
A beat passes, and Dean glances down to see wide eyes peering up at him. “Why...am I in the front seat? I never. Ride in the fron’.”
There is no angelic hum sounding in Dean’s ears. Instead, his chest feels full and warm, like guitar strings have been strummed and left to vibrate right over his heart. The music of Cas’s love sings through Dean, thrumming like a pulse. It is alive.
“Whoa, whoa!” Dean slaps a hand to the cut on Cas’s neck, while they try to catch their breath on the floor. Cas’s eyes are squeezed shut, and his breathing is way too fast, but Dean can feel his pulse hammering under the rush of blood from between his cupped fingers, and he could nearly cry with joy.
Dean feels a hysterical bark of laughter burst from his chest when suddenly, a distant crack echoes through the space. He thinks it’s a shotgun from far above them, soundwaves carrying through the crevices that have let the light in. But then Cas lets out a startled yelp and slams his eyes shut.
Almost too quiet to hear, Dean mumbles, “I didn’t even get to say it back, Sammy.”
“Cas, why the
“Of course.”
Sam yells at the ceiling of the bar, praying with all his might that they’re within angelic earshot. The guys on either side of him yell at him to shut up, dragging him further away from Dean and arguing over who gets to swing first. He whispers under his breath instead. “Cas, wherever you are, we need your help, right now. O’Flanagan’s Bar, outside Omaha.”
Dean grabs Cas by the lapels of his trench coat and pulls him in for a fierce kiss.
They really are coming to the end of this ride, Dean thinks. Once he's all healed, Cas will set off to find some other path far away from Dean, who lives at the eye of a storm of apocalyptic fuckery, and will only ever always get his people hurt.
Dean watches as long legs unfold from where they’ve been tucked underneath him for the last hour, and pulls Cas to his feet. A brief wince crosses his features as he rises, and he rolls one ankle around gently. He presses against where their hands meet for stability. “My leg is all tingly. What did you call that last time? Pins and needles?”
Dean can’t shake the churning anxiety in his gut that maybe he hasn’t heard from him because something happened. A hint of shame rises at the thought, like he shouldn't be worried about an angel when they're the ones who orchestrated this whole fiasco.
~~~~~
"I know," Dean mutters, "it's okay." He tucks his temple against Cas's.
“I was trained not to,” Cas responds, his eyes off in the middle distance.
Cas still doesn’t look at him.
“I can’t-”
Dean fixed his eyes on the carving of Castiel’s name, a stubborn set to his jaw. He took a few deep breaths.
He holds him for a few minutes, lets the shaking subside before he pulls away. Cas stares at him for a beat, that old charged look from his angel days, but his expression turns cold and distant when he swipes a finger across Dean’s cheek. He presents the smear of red.
When the idea strikes him, it hits like lighting.
“...I don’ think I can.”
“Literally anything, because I’m about fifteen seconds away from comatose.”
The Angel gasps, its voice stuttering.
The rift spell is pretty standard.
With both of them distracted, the swirling energy threatens to overpower their connected hands. Fear rises in Dean’s throat, choking him, but Castiel refuses to fail his charge now. He gathers his power and channels his own grace directly into the spot where hand meets shoulder. He seeks out the ragged holes in Dean’s spirit, the tattered edges of this man placed on the path to monsterhood. He eases the mind and soothes the heart, sets the bones and cleanses the blood.
“It’s okay,” Sam says, pushing the water and ibuprofen closer to Dean. “Here. Looks like you had a rough night.”
like his Father’s other creations. This man is only human, after all. How could he possibly warrant an emotional response from an Angel of the Lord?
Dean parks his ass on the edge of the dinette table to get Cas's head level with his hands. "Here goes." He starts stitching along the hairline. Cas bites his lip and stays still, a pinched expression on his face. Dean was in surgery the last time Cas got stitches, and this time he has too few arms to hold his hand or something. He wishes he could offer that small comfort. He remembers his first time, five knots for a cut on his elbow when he was seven. Sammy had clung to his pant leg the whole time, whispering encouragements, and it had made the endless pain a bit more bearable. There's nothing like a kid telling you he believes in you to make you feel like a superhero.
Jack shakes his head. “I had so little control over my powers then. Since I have no idea what I did, it could be dangerous for Cas if I tried to manipulate him from afar. And even if I could wake him, he said he had to annoy The Empty into releasing him. Given their current relationship, I imagine that wouldn’t go well this time.” He returns to scanning the runes.
Alastair chuckles darkly. “The Righteous Man? This pretty boy wouldn’t know ‘righteous’ if it stabbed him in the chest.” The demon spits in the direction of the light. “He’s one of us now. In fact, he’s about to get his very first demonic Girl Scout badge,
Neither Dean nor Castiel can comprehend what they’re seeing. Their minds race concurrently, neither having the courage to speak aloud.
And with that, he gets a face full of dirty trench coat.
This blip of a town in Indiana has seen an increase in disappearances over the last four months. Hikers and wilderness officials began to go missing from a largely uncharted section of the local forest, and no one could pin down why. It takes them less than a day to figure out who the vengeful spirit is. Then, a week of researching town records at the municipal library, scouting the land, and talking to a local cartography nut for them to figure out that the haunted ranger station must be marked wrong on the map.
Although, he notices distantly, maybe he should start using a different phrase.
~~~~~
It isn’t until he stands, leveling his eyes to the thing’s chest, that Dean catches a glimpse of the perfect circle of gold ringing the creatures heads.
Cas swallows roughly and forces the words through his teeth. “About what?”
Sam’s hand freezes.
Then he freezes, remembering how much the ground between them still resembles a minefield.
“You what?” Dean doesn’t understand. “Why didn’t either of you tell me about that?”
They slash, stab, and smite their way through Hell, barreling through creatures so twisted and corrupted they are no longer recognizable. A pack of hellhounds races up their flank, their horrible faces contorted and snarling. Demons step over each other's dead bodies to get a chance to slice at the light of heaven. Castiel and his allies push forward.
Cas's glare is heightened by the mask of blood. “Dean, no.”
Dean wants to fight him on it, but he’s not wrong. His head was crammed so far up his own ass, that werewolf could’ve easily taken him out earlier. Thank god for angelic reflexes.
Cas shifts a hand so it’s brushing through Dean’s sweaty hair, and he really cannot help but sigh into it. He is, after all, only human. “Fuck, Cas,” he murmurs.
find a way to fling you back into Hell." He bites at Dean's jaw, then soothes it with a kiss.
Hell is more like dry ice.
“Do you need healing as well?” Cas interrupts him, gesturing to the split lip.
“Are we gonna need his help too?” Dean asks, taking long strides to keep up.
Dean breathes out a weak chuckle and slurs. “That’s the secret. None of us do.”
That, he feels less than the twinge of pain from moments ago. How odd.
“Ow!” Dean glances down, and realizes for the first time that he does have a shallow slice between his ribs, about four inches long. It’s still spilling tacky blood down his shirt, but has blended into the mess of his clothes so that he didn’t see. Cas must have been able to sense the rend in his skin with his grace. “Fuck. I hadn’t noticed.” He peaks under Cas’s fingers. “Aw, man, that’ll need stitches.”
Cas is kneeling on the bed beside him, fingers pressed to Dean’s forehead.
Cas shakes his head. “No. Can you...here-”
He keeps his voice carefully neutral. “Do you think that’s a great idea right now?”
Dean looks down again at the hushed voice, and Cas’s eyes are fluttering dangerously.
After a few charged beats, they look at each other in horrified silence.
“I don’t wish to embarrass you.” He finally says, eyes still jumping around the room. Cas is less still these days, Dean has noticed. Less marble statue than he was a year ago. He’s begun to pick up tics, like shifting his jaw side to side, or pinching his thumb and pointer fingers over the seam of his sleeve. “It relates to emotions, which I know you generally avoid.”
Lastly, Castiel heals the skin, erasing decades of scars and carefully dusting freckles across the man’s cheekbones. He barely has time to notice Dean's physical beauty, how the freckles suit the rough hewn texture of his soul, before Alastair’s head begins to stir behind him.
it’s good.
He presses a hand to his opposing wrist; pointer and middle fingers extended and aligned, all others held together by the thumb. It is so often a motion he has used to heal, a miracle that has now been taken from him. Instead, he uses it to monitor the metered drumbeat under his skin.
But Dean Winchester knows better.
pass a written test on the Winchester book of sarcasm by this point, but he hasn’t quite prepared for the practical. The bitchy face ends up looking more like he’s eaten a lemon. “Is fixing a stomachache truly the greatest use of Heaven’s grace?” Cas manages to deliver with sass. “I imagine you’ll survive until morning without my assistance.”
Horrible things like Dean.
The movement around them crashes into slow motion.
Alastair stalks towards the Angel, now crumpled to half its staggering height, clutching at its abdomen. A blue tinted light bleeds from the wound beneath its massive hand, flashing like quicksilver as it spills to the red stained floor.
“What happened?”
So why does the ache in his vessel’s chest remain?
Dean’s eyes widen and his hand shoots up beside Cas’s face, pressing flat and sweeping around his dust covered hair. Everywhere Dean touches, there is stone. This little alcove, large enough only to stop their bodies from being crushed, is being entirely held on Castiel’s back.
Celestial wavelength of intent, stuck in a body that doesn’t even belong to me.”
After a few moments, he feels Dean run a curious finger along one of his wing shaped scars.
Oh. That’s the word he was looking for.
Alastair’s horrible melodic voice rings out. “Something as bright and shiny as you don’t belong down here. It ain’t natural. Hurts my eyes just to look at you.”
Dean scrambles to his knees and swivels to look up at the angel in the bathroom doorway. Cas does not inhabit the body of a particularly large man, but from this angle, Dean feels like an ant beneath a giant’s feet. Tilting his head up that far leaves him dizzy, and he topples backwards on his ass.
It’s Sam, it’s always Sam, with the ethics in mind. “But Dean...are you sure he wants to be human? I’m not advocating that we leave him there, but taking his grace feels like a big deal.”
“I know, I know,” Dean says, shaking his head. “That’s not what I meant. Shit. Look, I love Eileen, and I love how happy she makes you. God, Sammy, what I wouldn’t give for you to have that picket fence.” He smirks, but it doesn’t reach his eyes. “Imagine how cool I’d be as an uncle, huh?”
He walks for what feels like five minutes, but when he checks his watch again, has been twenty.
“I am alive.” Cas tentatively presses his mouth to the pad of Dean’s thumb. “Well, for now, at least. I am also being actively pursued by bloodthirsty creatures who would like to harvest my grace and display my head on a stake. But in light of this reunion, perhaps we could momentarily ignore the inevitable doom, and...find a way to celebrate, instead?” The hopeful glint in his cornflower irises has nothing to do with the crystals.
Dean gulps.
He clings to his kid with reckless abandon. Jack’s hands rest solidly against Dean’s shoulder blades. Dean is clinging so tightly that it would probably make a human’s ribs creak.
Alastair reaches out his hand to shake Dean’s, prepared to finalize the process. He waits for his apprentice to take it.
A flat slab of concrete, level with Cas’s shoulder blades.
“Why the liquor fest?” Sam asks anyway.
Dean swims up from the depths a bit at that. “...What?”
Sensing that Dean won’t, Cas eventually breaks the silence. “Would you like to talk about it?”
“Hey.” He tips Cas’s chin up. “Just let me help. You’ve taken care of me plenty, alright? Now it’s my turn.” Dean tries for a smile.
He peels off the sock, and Dean is not squeamish by any means but he does have to take a deep breath at how
Dean stares for another moment before the penny drops.
Dean can’t help but rub at his ears, even though the sound resonates mainly through his core.
Cas keeps his eyes open this time, and the grace shines out of them like sunlight on Dean’s face. The blood vanishes in an instant, leaving behind the sensation of his skin scrubbed clean. His nerves tingle, raw.
~~~~~
That afternoon by the river had been the first time he and Cas ever hugged. He was warm pressed to Dean’s chest, peach fuzz scratchy against Dean’s knuckles. He smelled like dirt and blood, like the rest of purgatory, but also something smoky. Lightning and ozone, or maybe a crackling fire. Dean’s hands have been longing to reach out and touch all day, starved and aching to remind himself Cas is real.
“Prove it,” Cas mutters, a playful twinkle in his eye. “Kiss me again.”
“My very own guardian angel.” Dean’s mouth says without his brain’s permission.
“We have work for you.”
“Hiya, sweetheart.” The demon waves a blade like he’s saying hello, and then stabs it through Dean’s abdomen.
Dean grins wickedly. He scoops an arm under Cas’s knees and hauls him into a bridal carry, leaving Cas scrambling at his neck and clutching at his shoulders to stay upright. "Dean!" His gasp of surprise hits Dean’s nose, and Dean swallows the soft, shocked noise he makes with another kiss. He lets the press of Cas cradled against him soothe his soul before spinning them in a dramatic twirl that leaves Cas clinging to Dean's shirt for dear life.
He hasn’t prayed to God in a long time.
They crash somewhere in the middle, chest to chest. Cas’s gasp of surprise hits Dean’s cheek as Dean’s chin juts into his shoulder. Dean bites his tongue in the collision, but he doesn’t care. He wraps his arms around Cas and holds him like there’s no tomorrow.
He shifts the car into gear and heads for the highway.
They had earned this.
Dean exhales, hard, and flops backward so violently that he whacks his skull on the headboard.
“Well, probably, but more importantly, I now owe him twenty dollars.”
He goes to grab his swaying brother and pull him from the fray, but immediately the tattooed man’s cronies are on them, pushing at Sam's shoulders til he drops to his knees. One of them resumes hitting Dean while Sam struggles against their hold. He hears the crunch of Dean’s nose breaking under a meaty fist, and feels the splatter of blood land across his own face.
believe me when I say, I did not want to.”
Dean raises his hands in surrender.
he looks. How human he
No matter. He looks into Dean Winchester’s eyes and feels certain that it will not happen again. Above all else, Castiel serves Heaven.
“Excuse me for doing what I had to in order to save your life, Dean.” Cas snaps back at him.
Cas finishes his exploratory loop and settles against the wall, one shoulder turned towards his companion.
Dean fights a smile. “So Heaven
“You don’t wanna come in here, Sammy, I’m leakin’ from both ends.”
Cas steadies the steering wheel as Sam strips out of his remaining flannel, and folds it behind Cas’s shoulder blades.
But Cas is different. He rebelled, and faced down an archangel for them. Dean still isn't sure exactly what kind of torture Cas went through to make it back from that one. Besides, there is a literal apocalypse going on. It’s normal to be concerned for your allies.
He’s scared, for more reasons than he can think about right now.
“You’ve
“No, Cas, I really do, becaus-”
Cas, the bastard, fucking
They’re sitting in the library of the bunker, in the matching leather armchairs they’ve been occupying more and more often as of late. Nearly every night for the last month, in fact, each time with a new soundtrack.
Sam knocks the bottle out of Dean’s hand with such force it crashes to the floor. Mira barks once and runs from the room.
Dean forces his eyes open. His vision is doing a damn good impression of those old school photographs, where the subject is ringed in fuzzy darkness. At the center of it are two blurry blue eyes, blinking back tears. He’s never seen Cas cry. But then again, Cas is going through a lot of firsts today. Dean wishes he had gotten him laid when he had the chance.
Well, by
“Wake me up, Sam, please, w-wake me up.” Dean mutters between clenched teeth. The knife severs an artery and blood rushes out in a flood. “Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up.”
Maybe she was right.
Frankly, it’s not his fault. That’s the lie he’ll tell himself later, anyway.
Later that day, he feels embarrassed when he realizes Cas is likely only sticking around because he doesn’t have anywhere else to go, but like hell is he gonna say that out loud. If he acknowledges that they’re the guy’s only option, it’ll feel less like he’s
This time it's Cas who looks away, shifting in discomfort.
~~~~~
“Yes,” says Jack, a serious expression on his face. Eyes squinting, head slightly tilted. Dean ignores the stab of pain in his chest when he remembers who Jack learned that one from. “You know I love you all like fathers to me, and this family has shaped me into who I have become.” A smile quirks at the corner of Dean’s lips. “But Cas...our bond is special, and I am protective of him. I know him, Dean. I...I knew.”
Dean snorts in laughter. He wonders absently if Cas paid for this stuff or just robbed a convenience store. Either way, he sends up a prayer.
Dean rolls his eyes to hide a grin. “Yeah, well. You’re getting better. Now stop ruining my favorite song with Bible study.” Cas gestures weakly for him to continue. Dean’s voice gets stronger with each line.
Dean looks back at Cas and his breath catches in his throat.
“But no, there was never any dancing. Angels celebrate with their voices, with, uh...
The thought feels like a final indication of how far he is past the point of no return.
Without another word, Castiel grips Dean tight, spreads his singed wings, and leaps.
with wings and a halo. No hunter has ever come across one before. He would know if they existed, wouldn’t he? There’s no such thing.
Dean drops his head back down and pants through the adrenaline rush. Cas is propped above him so they’re almost chest to chest, his hands bracketing either side of Dean’s head. Cold, rough stone bites into Dean’s spine, and bits of debris decorate Cas’s hair. When he looks beyond the broad shoulders framing his field of view, he notices that darkness envelops them both. There are tiny cracks in the veneer of black, letting in narrow streams of afternoon light. An unsettling number of dust motes dance in the air.
The operator picks up, and Cas directs her to the abandoned warehouse outside of town. If she’s startled by the location, she doesn’t show it. She dispatches an ambulance and tells him she’ll wait on the phone, but he barely hears her.
Cas shakes his head. “This can’t be happening. Let me try again.”
But those are conversations for Dean and Cas to worry about tomorrow.
Cas barrels on anyway. Definitely not listening. “A vicious blow is always coming my way, that's all I know. I've learned to anticipate it by now. Every time I round a corner, there could be someone waitin’ to ambush me. So I walk around flinching, expecting a strike. And the next one will be the most painful, because now, without purpose or use,
It extends one massive hand towards Dean, who hesitates.
Perhaps the Winchesters will throw him out just like Heaven did. Discard him like something obsolete and defective. After all, he is. The only angels who ever fell were the ones who weren’t built right in the first place. Lucifer was prideful. Anna was full of wrath. And Castiel, with his doubts plaguing him since The Beginning, could never have fallen this far if he were created properly from the start. He recognizes this line of thought is very close to blasphemy, teetering on the edge of challenging his Father’s creation of his own nature. But questioning is a part of humanity, he notes bitterly. Besides, both the sting of thread pulling at his back and the swell of mortal anger in his chest tells him that he truly does not care anymore. Let him blaspheme, who is holding him to Heaven's standards now?
“Di-” Dean’s throat catches and he swallows before trying again. “Did you know?” He whispers.
-warm.
“Well, I am, for sure,” says Dean. Cas’s eyes flare and he can almost see the light that isn’t there anymore. “Cause I’ve waited so long to say this.”
“Cas-”
Dean nods, not trusting his voice to stay steady. He just lets Cas lean on him until his circulation comes back. Then he plucks the glass from Cas’s other hand, sets it on the table, and walks backwards, drawing Cas with him to the center of the room.
“I’m heading to that bar we passed in town.” Dean’s voice is low and dangerous, as if he’s daring his brother to protest.
Cas carefully shifts so he’s leaning against the headboard. He stretches his legs in front of him with a fatigued sigh that sounds very human. Dean stays on his back, looking up at the way the shadows carve into Cas's cheekbones.
Green eyes meeting blue, and holding them there for an impossible eternity.
Castiel notices his chest aching, and presses a hand to his ribs. They received “quite a beating”, in Sam’s words, but he has a feeling that is not the cause of this pain.
He hears his own outcry before he notices the sentiment behind it, and belatedly realizes.
His face crumples, sobs wrack his body, and his hands come up to hide his eyes. Sam hurries around the table, kicking a chair closer and pulling his big brother against his chest. Dean clutches at Sam’s sleeves, heaves huge gasping breaths against his jacket, and he cries, and cries, and cries.
Sam jumps into action, long strides carrying him across the room. He tackles the man on top of Dean, pulling at his waist until he can leverage his own weight against him, dragging him to the floor. This drops Dean against the pool table, blood streaming down his face and a glassy look in his eyes. “Yeah, take
A flush hits the back of Dean’s neck. Cas never did let him get away with self deprecation. “Worth it. Nothing felt right with you gone.”
“Is that so?” Cas asks, trailing his long fingers down Dean’s jaw.
Castiel’s garrison fights with precision and power. This is a raid, not a siege, and they stick together as such. While the armies of Hell are vicious, they are also sloppy. Formations break, defensive styles vary, and they take no heed to watch one another’s backs. This is where the Angels have the upper hand. Being created together and spending millenia training as soldiers side by side lends the battalion a unity, a smoothness, in thwarting their enemies. The demons and monsters swarming them are also partially blinded by the glow of the heavenly host. Each Angel shines a light that contrasts brightly to the dim red haze of Hell. Anael’s essence is cooper, almost a fiery orange. Balthazar’s, a bronze and golden blend. Castiel’s, he’s been told, is white tinged with royal blue.
