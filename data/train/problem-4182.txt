“Can we go please?” Cas demanded when all was said and done and the man behind the counter went to retrieve the old Lincoln from the lot. He grabbed a hold of his brother and practically dragged him outside of the building, pushing past Dean.
“Cas, can I…”
Benny.
Who the hell was this Godly man?
“That bad huh?”
Though going back to the bar reminded him of the night they shared leftover fries on the hood of the Impala, of the moment they shared, Castiel told himself it was okay to go back and enjoy the night. It was a public space, it was safe. God, thinking about that in turn reminded him of their almost kiss a few nights ago.
Dean[10:56PM]: You too Cas.
Curious, Benny turned around just in time to see Castiel take a seat with two other girls. The laugh that followed was uncontrollable and the look on Dean’s face? Priceless. “Oh man, you’ve got it bad!”
“Campus is fine.”
Casanova laughed again.
I write all my stuff on Microsoft word, So I had hoped to simply copy paste on rich text. Well that didnt work. So i copy pasted it on HTML and then switched it. Everything was jumbled together! I had to go through it all!
“Well, if you don’t want to check into the clinic then I’ll help you. Whatever you need.”
It wasn’t fair.
“I’m sorry Dean.”
No. He was supposed to hate him, right?
“You sound like a really good brother, caring for her.”
“No.” Charlie laughed. “I think Cas would say so if they did. No, he’s conflicted, it’s obvious.”
He needed a distraction.
Dean could talk to Castiel and keep it 100% platonic, right? And, if he was ever accused of flirting he could always deny it. Shit, as far as he knew, Cas probably wasn’t even interested. Dean, on the other hand, apparently still was if his freak out over the tone of his text messages were anything to go by.
Sam rolled his eyes and wiped his mouth clean. “Okay, sure, but it wasn’t. I’m just helping the guy out is all.”
Desperate, Dean trudged onwards and followed Castiel and his brother outside, his inner alpha pretty much dictating how this afternoon encounter was going to go. Which was fine, Dean was down, no problem. “So uh, you wanna go see her?” He asked when he caught up beside Cas where they waited for the Lincoln to be brought back around.
If anyone had asked him three months ago where he imagined he would be in the months to come, he wouldn’t be able to give an answer. He certainly never imagined he’d be here, watching Dean Winchester of all people play a game of pool with his best friend.
He sent the photo with a racing heart full of anticipation and excitement.
“Castiel. I must level with you here. It’s indicated in your health chart and health history that you ah – for lack of better phrasing – went through something pretty traumatic three years ago. Your body was forced into a heat cycle by way of some serious medications and afterwards you were immediately put on heat suppressants. Your reproductive system has been more or less dormant for the past three years, unnaturally so.”
Dean’s head falls back against the wall with a dull thud, and his hands rise and carefully grip into Cas’s hair.
“Do you like cats?” the man signs slowly as he speaks. Dean’s eyes go wide, and he looks into the man’s beautiful blue eyes, astonished. He can sign, poorly but it’s an effort made.
The man pats him on the arm and eases out the door. Dean has never in his life wanted a voice more. He watches the man walk toward the parking lot until he disappears into the darkness. Dean heads back to his friends’ table. He slumps into his seat and closes his eyes for a moment's peace before he lets Charlie bombard him with questions.
Cas starts the truck and pulls away; he’s heading to the market, even though he really doesn’t
It used to be that when they traveled Dean would always sit in the aisle seat (away from the window), but now that they have children - a miracle he barely believes is real some days - things are different. Jack is much more likely to need the toilet during the flight than Claire and since Dean is always glued to his seat from take-off to landing, Castiel will have to be the one to go to the toilet with their son. Castiel had also taken into account when booking that Dean hates flying and made sure he was seated next to him just in case he began to get worked up. Which left Claire with the window seat, something which, luckily, she seemed to be very pleased about.
He kisses the back of Dean’s neck and thinks about all the time that they’ve missed because of their disagreement. “I’m sorry.” He says quietly, “I never want us to fight like that again.”
“Coming home with us?” Charlie buts in, cutting Dean off.
“That’s what I thought, so I decided to let him go, but somehow the gun went off in my hand and grazed his arm… I cleaned him up and drove him home. I did right, didn’t I Gabe?”
“That sounds like a good plan.” says Dean, “Do you want to go back to my house or do you feel up to checking out the cars you liked?”
The van they’ve hired to take them from the airport to their resort is waiting for them when they touch down. Jack and Claire buzz with excitement as they ride down the road with the sea glistening ahead of them. Castiel and Dean smile warmly at each other as their children point out the beautiful and interesting things they pass on the way to their accommodation. Dean is already far more relaxed, happy to - at last - be on solid ground again and Castiel smirks to himself, thinking of the plans he has to help Dean relax even further once they are settled in and the kids are both in bed.
Dean places a bowl of cereal in front of Cas and gets one for himself, and pours them each a cup of coffee.
Cas stares at him with wide eyes, ”Well, what comes after haywire?” He whispers.
“You’re not doing anything wrong, Cas. Everything you’re doing is soooo right. I just want you to stop worrying so much and get up here.”
“Yes, I can swim” says Claire, frowning slightly, “Is it over, Papa? Can we get out of here?”
Dean’s not bothered by people he is seeing flirting with others but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t have issues. His isn’t being jealous, but being left behind. Everyone he had ever connected with - had left him. He’d always been the one who’d fought for something that apparently wasn’t mutual and had then been left standing there alone, feeling stupid and worthless. Even his brother had left him to run off to college and hadn’t that stung like a bitch.
“I love you, too.” says Castiel, before meeting Dean’s eyes once more, “Now, take off your pants.”
“Castiel.”
Cas’s hand is shaking and he drops his phone in his lap, he can’t, he
Cas stays quiet, but on the inside, his whole being sags with relief. Between those texts and the voicemails where Dean hadn’t really apologized at all, and the heated exchange at Castiel’s door when Dean had brought his phone back to him, he had been concerned that Dean didn’t actually understand how messed up him driving away had been. But clearly, he did and Castiel completely believed that Dean’s apology was heartfelt and genuine. He suddenly held much higher hopes for them to get back on the right track.
“Yeah, and you’re leaving for school.”
“But…” Dean has run out of steam and out of words. He sits next to Cas and rubs his hand up Cas’s back. Cas pulls away from the touch and glares at Dean.
“Yes, the kind you don’t want shared with people....” the words were difficult to get out and Castiel felt a deep burning embarrassment at what Dean must think of him, knowing he’d let Ishim film him in compromising positions.
Castiel knows he shouldn’t be disappointed when the hot lineman didn't come to the club; it was only Tuesday after all. The man had a dangerous day job and probably isn’t one for hanging out weeknights at a club. But, somehow Castiel still feels a little sad that he didn’t show. He tries to put it out of his mind and focus on working the crowd and getting the best tips. The rest of the week goes without incident, no sexy lineman in his front yard - sadly. Castiel follows his usual routine.
She yells for him repeatedly but no reply comes as she scans the people moving about outside the hospital. Whoever he was, he was gone. Feeling disappointed Claire turns back toward the hospital trying to decide whether or not to mention what she thought she had seen to her papa.
Unable to answer with words, Dean nods, at least he hopes it's a nod.
Each time Jack has to watch his dad walk away from the truck, leaving him alone with people he doesn’t know, the fear that it will be the last time he sees him creeps in. It settles like ice in his belly and makes him shiver, despite the heat of the afternoon sun. He wants to ask his dad to stay with him, or let him look for Claire and Papa too. He wants to tell him he could help, and he would… If it weren’t for the injuries he knows he’d see.
Cas was sitting at the table emailing work when he received a message from a friend of his and Ishim’s, really he was more a friend or actually a coworker of Ishim’s. Cas hoped he wasn’t going to have to explain where Ishim was and why he wasn’t at work. Feeling a sense of dread washing away his good mood, he opened the message.
“Fuck, Dean, I’m gonna come.”
The truck finally jerks to a stop at a large hospital, there are several large military-style tents set up all around the main building. Dean can tell this is by far the busiest place they have visited. People are congregating in large groups around the list boards, struggling to see the hundreds of names that are scribbled on them.
“Brush your teeth and stuff, Dean.”
Still draped over the fallen tree and being carried along with the flow, Castiel dozed. The ‘lap-lapping’ of the water against his skin almost felt therapeutic. It felt cool and warm at the same time, as though someone was lying a blanket over him and then drawing it back again and repeating the process over and over.
Sam had gone shopping and purchased Cas some new jeans and a few shirts to hold him over until he could go back to Ishim’s and get his own things or went shopping on his own to buy new clothes.
Castiel reaches out to squeeze Dean’s hand and offers him a comforting smile and nod before turning to their youngest and brushing his fringe away from his face. Jack, it seemed, did not share the same fear of flying as his dad and was sleeping soundly in the seat next to his papa, Castiel.
Dean turns to look down at the peaceful faces of his children, so grateful that he will be waking them with good news, he carefully nudges them and smiles as he says, “Papa is out of surgery, he’s going to be okay! Let’s go back to his room so we can be there when he wakes up, okay?”
“God Cain, you’re amazing,” Dean whispers.
His phone buzzes in his pocket.
“But I’m injured... I can’t drive.” he takes hold of the banister, as though trying to get his point across by demonstrating how unbalanced he felt, “Oh, you know… I actually feel pretty weak; maybe it’s the shock and loss of blood.”
“I just received an email from one of his coworkers. He was apologizing for not letting me know sooner and told me that this was not the first time.” Cas’s voice shook as he explained to Dean.
“I’m here, babe. I’m right here.” Dean leans down and plants a meaningful kiss on his forehead, whispering to him before pulling away, “You did so good Cas, so good.”
“Fine, Winchester, baby-down the party.” Gabe grumbled.
He is almost back to the truck when he thinks he hears his daughters name, there’s no way that’s what he heard though, right? Stopping, he turns back toward the hospital, looking around at the crowd. He hears it again and frowning he moves toward the sound. He scans the faces along the street until he spots his kids. Both of his kids, together. Holding each other and sobbing, Claire is here. She’s alive. She and Jack are together... He freezes for a moment, as though the wonderful image before his eyes might disappear if he so much as moves a muscle. He blinks, they are still there….
Cas is beyond excited to be on stage. Not only because he loves it, but because he is doing a special dance just for Dean. He’s been working on his upper body strength so he could do more pole work and now it’s time to show off.
“Alright, and what’s the name of the resort we are staying at, Jack?” Cas asks the boy.
“Yeah, this is her third trip with them. She really cherishes being able to help the less fortunate.” Sam grins at Cas, “She said that she will be here in the next couple of days.”
After some time, another volunteer asks Claire to come up to a table on the far side of the tent. Claire cautiously agrees and follows her, taking a seat on the opposite side of the table from her. Claire watches, her brows knitted together in confusion as the woman empties a small clear plastic bag of items carefully on to the surface of the table in front of her, “Do any of these look familiar to you?” The woman asks kindly, watching Claire’s reaction.
Monday finds Dean at the Army Recruiter's office in the strip mall across from the grocery where he and Cas work. He only has half an hour for his lunch break.
Cas unbuttons and unzips his own jeans before groping to find Dean’s zipper. He finally undoes Dean’s jeans and slips his hand inside, cupping Deans hard length through the cotton of his briefs. The sound that escaped Dean’s throat is a mix of a moan and a whimper. Cas loves it.
Dean looks up at him, appearing to be just as wrecked with lust as Castiel feels, “Going to fuck me now, babe?” he huffs out eagerly.
‘WINCHESTER - CLAIRE’ is written on her arm in big bold letters. Then the volunteer takes her papa’s arm and writes, ‘WINCHESTER - CASTIEL’.
Dean watches the boys play together, using sticks as ‘action figures’ to keep themselves entertained. He marvels at how children seem to have a special way of dealing with the stress and strain of hard times, an uncanny way of finding joy in the most imaginative ways. Once again he finds himself wishing that he could spare Jack from having to go through all this horror. If only he could wave his hands and make it all go away.
One woman presses a small cup to his lips, insisting that he drink some water, as others gather around him, cleaning his wounds and washing the filth from his skin. If he wasn’t feeling so weak, he’d feel embarrassed. There are so many hands on him, wiping his bloody arms and legs, it has been a long time since anyone other than Dean has touched him so intimately. His leg is throbbing and his chest aches as he looks up into the faces of the women, with tears in his eyes.
“If you can come on my cock, then you can come. A slut like you should be able to come without touching himself.”
The next day, Sam and Dean both go back to work. Cas is left on his own, but he doesn’t feel nervous or afraid now that Ishim is behind bars. In fact, he feels relief. It’s as though a weight has been lifted from his shoulders. A weight he hadn’t realized was so heavy until it was gone until Ishim was gone.
“Hey Doc,” he greets the shorter man walking into the room.  “Dean’s been flinching and gripping his fists again this morning. That’s a good sign, right?” Cas looks at the bandages on Dean’s arms. Dean’s suit protected him from the fire - mostly - but there are burns on his forearms and lower legs. The beam had fallen across his legs and broke the femur on his left leg and the tibia and fibula on his right. Even with the oxygen tank and full face mask, he has some lung damage from the smoke.
He fumbles around and knocks his phone off the nightstand.
“You like that?” Cas asks as he squeezes their cocks just right.
“You knew. I told you last month.” Benny answers.
“Ishim, you don’t… you wouldn’t… show that to anyone, would you?” Cas asks carefully.
Cas just puts his head in his hands and groans.
“Yeah,” Dean agreed, much quieter, “Cas deserves the best.” He half smiled at Cas, then looked away quickly.
painting?” he asks with a concerned frown.
“It’s no problem, I’m speaking up now. Besides, I’m sure you’re about ready for a break, too.” Dean hints at Cas being tired without actually saying it.
Dean shakes his head as if that would clear the thoughts away, this was so not the time to be getting distracted. He decides it’s time to call his brother.
Cas lets out a shaky breath and reaches to his bedside table for the lube, tugging on Dean’s boxer-briefs and manages to get them both naked without much effort. He pops the cap of the lube and squeezes some onto his fingers, rubbing them together to warm the viscus jelly; adjusting to line them up and wrapping his hand around both of their hard, aching lengths. Stroking them together.
“The same way you got here, I’d assume,” Cas answers, sounding a little bewildered.
“Oh, I’m sorry!” the man says to Dean. Dean smiles his best smile and holds his hands up in a universal signal that all is well. He takes the moment to look over the man’s face.
Castiel obediently inches down the bed and reluctantly takes Ishim’s cock into his mouth. His lip stings as he stretches his mouth wide around it. Cas sucks Ishim until he is fully hard, feeling used and dirty.
Castiel sighed and looked back over the clothes he’d disregarded and chose black jeans and a dark blue button-down. There, he’d made a decision. Now, he just had to clean up this mess.
Dean kisses Cas’s shoulder and rests his hands-on Cas’s hips, sliding them to his lower back as he leans against him. Cas lets his head fall back, giving Dean more access.
Cas walks up to the stall where Dean and Benny are working, nodding to Benny and motioning for him to take a break - in other words, Benny doesn’t want to be in here for what’s about to happen.
Dean realizes he has an important decision to make and tries not to think about how badly it could go wrong if he doesn’t make the right one. Deciding to fight the urge to stay, he agrees to go with the other survivors on the truck and get his son somewhere safer. He hopes he is making the right choice.
Everything looks wonderful and so much more magical than they expected. They chat together about some of the things they’ve seen so far and their plans for the coming days, which include, of course, a phone call to Uncle Sam on Christmas. Claire and Jack talk excitedly about Christmas and what gifts they hope to get until Jack starts to show signs of tiring and they decide to head back to their suite and tuck him into bed.
On his way home, he barely notices the power company truck on his street. He’d forgotten all about the letter and the impending outages.
“Dude,” Bill retorts “you don’t even know this stripper, and you’re leaving notes on his door?”
He feels his heart grow heavy, but he has to look after his son, so he cradles him in his arms, gently rocking him against his body and humming. His humming takes on the tune of ‘Stand by Me’, it was his and Cas’s wedding song, and soon the words just start to flow naturally, quiet and soothing. He remembers holding Castiel against him in a hug much like this, they had swayed together to that song at their wedding. The memory of it makes Dean’s throat feel tight and his eyes mist up...
“We’ll be great together Castiel,” says Mick breathlessly, “We could travel the whole world together… I’ll show you anything you want to see, take you anywhere you want to go…”
“Open your eyes and look at me!” Ishim yells. Cas jerks his eyes open and stares right at Ishim.
Castiel hears his daughters gasp as she realizes what is happening barely thirty feet away from them. She turns back to her papa, with tears of fear in her eyes. He holds her closely into his chest, shielding her from seeing what was happening behind her. The loud splashing is soon accompanied by a blood-curdling ripping sound, as cloth and flesh is torn apart. Breathing in deeply to calm his nerves Castiel flicks his gaze over Claire's head and back toward the shark and corpse.
“Oh yeah, plenty of experience.” Sam laughed. Once everything was unloaded – two quesaritos, a chicken quesadilla, a box of tacos and an order of churros – Sam stood to his feet as though he was ready to leave.
They turned to see Bobby enter the living room and head towards the kitchen where they were. “Hey Bobby! What’s up?”
“It was too!”
The question rendered Castiel silent, the thought having gone completely over his head. To be quite honest, he didn’t really know the answer. The idea of having a heat partner is strange enough, and always will be regardless of the person. To spend intimate time together with a near stranger, very little time, to then never have anything to do with them once the heat passes; it was a strange concept. “I don’t know.” Castiel shrugged. “I mean, I think he will be great. We didn’t talk a whole lot about boundaries, but he seems pretty respectful, his scent is pleasant enough. He’s also engaging and a good listener, so…This is a really weird conversation Gabriel.”
Dean laughed again. “Dude, where the hell have you been?”
Dean’s voice cracked when he managed to find the ability to speak. “W-will I ever see you again?”
But this, this was different. Dean hadn’t expected to be the one that got hurt, it was never done. He always played everything off like things were cool, he would walk away, shake it off and get back to normal. Business as usual.
“Good to hear, now I’ll see you back in six weeks for a check-up, just make the appointment at reception before you go. Have a good day.” The doctor shakes Cas’s hand and leaves him to head out to the front. Feeling elated, Cas goes ahead and changes into his jeans and puts on his other shoe before going out front to make his appointment.
His words cut off as the ‘thing’ moves again. A sharp, unmistakable bobbing as something floating along the surface is tugged below the water and then rises again. He blinks, his heart rate quickening, it couldn’t be… could it?
Due to the number of injured people flocking to the hospitals, it takes the doctors a while to come by and examine his injuries but once they look him over they are quick to give him drugs for the pain and to fight off any infection. Castiel can’t understand what they are saying and feels very vulnerable, but he doesn’t try to stop them as they inject him with the drugs. He knows he is in a bad way and that he urgently needs help.
Cas (Friday 2:22 PM)> I guess I am
“Aw fuck, Cas, I’m so sorry.” Dean muttered something away from the phone that sounded suspiciously like ‘that son of a bitch’ and then continued, “Maybe you can add this to the charges against him?”
Forty minutes later, the car pulled up to Dean’s house. He and Benny crawl into the back since Charlie already has the front seat.
“I’m just happy to be heading to the doctor to get these stupid casts off.” Cas can’t stop smiling. “Did you bring my jeans and my other shoe?” Cas has been wearing a house shoe on his one foot whenever he steps out to the back deck, now he is wearing his one shoe on his good foot.
Castiel had tried repeatedly to talk Gabriel out of letting the gallery borrow ‘The Angel’s Heart’, he’d tried to reason with him that he was tempting fate. The truth was, that ‘The Angel’s Heart’ was a fake, a beautiful, jaw-dropping, heart-skipping, and breath-catching fake… but a fake all the same. It had been painted by their grandfather many years ago. Castiel’s grandfather, who had the same mischievous streak in him as Gabriel had boosted to a rival collector about how he had found and purchased the original ‘Angel’s Heart’ but of course, this had been a dangerous fabrication, that had gotten completely out of hand when the local papers had taken notice and done a small piece featuring a photograph of the painting…
“No long involved lie, just nod if I’m right.” Cas nods. “Who painted it?”
Ishim replies in less than five minutes.
“But you paint them so perfectly. Just like Granddad did.” Gabe tries to meet and head off his brother’s impending foul mood. Castiel always got tense when Gabe brings up trying to sell his paintings.
Dean sneaks out across the marble floor of the gallery, to the painting and lifts it carefully off the wall, as his heart hammers painfully in his chest he removes ‘The Angel’s Heart’ from it’s frame. Rehanging the empty frame neatly on the wall, he takes the painting back to Castiel who is waiting in the closet, Castiel’s eyes go wide when he sees it in Dean’s hands, he smiles at him excitedly.
Castiel sits straight up in bed. “What the ever loving fuck is that beeping?” He looks at his phone, nope he hadn’t even set an alarm.
Dean stayed on the phone with Cas as long as he could.
“Claire! Grab that billboard!” Castiel calls out to his daughter as he makes his way to a large floating plank of wood. He never takes his eyes off her; he doubts he ever will again.
Ishim (Wednesday 8:01 PM) > But Castiel you know you belong here with me.
“So,” Dean says between kisses as he works his way back up Cas’s neck.
He breaches the surface and then he hears it, screaming. It should fill his heart with dread, chill his blood to an icy sludge, that’s how awful the sound is. Instead, it sparks a flame of hope in his chest, it’s Claire, he knows it’s his daughter and he quickly shouts out. The screaming stops, so does his heart, had she been pulled under? Or was she simply pausing to listen?
“Shh, Cas is resting.” Dean says quietly to Sam by way of greeting.
Dean (Friday 2:17 PM)> Hey Cas. I hope you’re feeling better this afternoon?
“You’re welcome, Dean. Now, we should eat before our food gets too cold.”
“No. I just didn’t feel like cooking after the gym.” Castiel answers quietly. This whole situation wasn’t fair, Isham wasn’t supposed to be home until tomorrow. Castiel had planned to cook a nice steak dinner for him and get a bottle of wine, he’d planned to keep him happy.
They spend a lot of time at the local pool, not even minding that Sammy has to tag along. Pool time is playtime and Dean, and Cas get to feel like kids again. There are camping trips with Dean’s family and a trip to the lake with Castiel’s. They talk about right now, about the upcoming weekend, about pizza and sodas, but they don’t talk about the future beyond the end of July.
“What if you hang out with me, Cas, and Gabe, then?”
“Anything exciting happen here today?” Sam asked Dean and Cas.
Cas was completely lost in thought for the ride home; his fingers drifted up to touch his lips absently from time to time, where the echo of
They splash and swim, tossing a ball for Casey to retrieve.
“I just want to make sure you’re prepared and that nothing is going to hurt you, Dean.”
Dean climbs the stairs to the second level, his legs moving of their own accord and walks through one of the wards of the hospital checking bed to bed before he goes to search the long list of names. His eyes travel from bed to bed on an overflowing ward, he takes in the sight of every man, woman and child, every grotesque injury, each of the few hauntingly empty beds. His legs are tried and his eyes are worse, worn out from squinting at barely legible scribbles on patient charts but he pushes on. Something, way down deep in his core, forces one foot in front of the other, it keeps his eyes scanning the sickly faces of the injured, it keeps him going.
Dean hits send and wipes his hand down his face. He takes a little white pill from the bottle in his pocket and swallows it dry. He needs to stop the panic attack before hit hits in full force.
Castiel suddenly feels something sharp stab deeply into his lower leg, he screams in agony, which allows the valuable air he had left in his lungs to escape as a large bubble. He feels the bubble of air roll up his face, he sees the dim sunlight of the surface, but it’s blurred and fading fast - or is that him?
The man carefully opens his jacket to show him that he isn’t carrying a weapon, “No,” he steps closer, “See no weapons. I’m unarmed.”
“Well guys, I’m keeping dinner simple with spaghetti and salad. Y’all read to eat?  ‘Cause this is ready to put on the table.” Dean addresses Sam and Cas.
’. He thinks to himself but then the man on the ground groans and rolls over. ‘
Dean lays there with his hands behind his head, watching Cas as less-than-gracefully shucks his sleeping pants, letting them drop to the floor when he walks to the bathroom. Dean laughs at his night-owl of a partner. Cas has never been a morning person. Dean hears the shower start and figures he had better get up as well, might even be able to get a little action if he’s nice to Cas in the shower. Cas constantly complains about Dean being too perky in the morning.
Cas parks in Harvelle’s lot and fondly watches and listens to Dean relive the morning's events. He can’t help but smile; Dean is so happy - it’s contagious. The uneasy jealous feeling that Cas had when he dropped Dean off earlier is now forgotten, and he is feeling the joy of Dean’s experience as though he was there with him.
“Dean, don’t do that,” Sam complains.
“You’ll find them, Dean, you will. Be careful, alright? Call me as soon as you can...”
“Oh, that was later, when I was driving him home.”
Claire frowns slightly, does that mean her papa might still be alive? She isn’t sure and is too afraid of the answer being no, to ask. She’ll hold on to the possibility for as long as she can.
Casey sniffs and mouths at the cord, licks the O-ring, and leans in for some scratches from Dean. He keeps telling her about his keys and the keychain while they wait their turn. Dean rubs the corded rope along her head and pets her with it, pokes her and lets her mouth at it and get a good scent of it. Finally, it’s their turn.
A few terrifying seconds pass by, and his heart beats painfully fast in his chest as he wonders if he’d just shot the thief… Gingerly, he peeks wide-eyed around the doorframe to see the man on the floor. ‘
“Papa,” Claire wakes him gently.
“I…” Cas stares, completely lost for words.
The conversation devolves into chatter about classes and hot bartenders and everything in between. Dean blushes when they tease him about trying to pick up the bartender at the club a couple of weeks ago.
Now armed, he makes his way down the hall to the stairs, he hears another shuffling sound downstairs and his nerves spike. The pistol in his right hand and his phone is in his left, he slowly creeps down the stairs, his eyes searching through the darkness ahead for the source of the noise. He freezes as he reaches the bottom step, finally able to see the figure in the dark ahead of him.
“Oh, good grief, will you please get down here.”
It takes a few minutes, pushing other branches and debris out of their way, but they make it to the fallen tree and Castiel gently pushes Claire forwards so she can grab hold, and then comes to rest beside her. He lays his head against the cool trunk of the tree and closes his eyes for a moment as he tries to catch his breath and take stock of their situation. He pulls his daughter close and tells her over and over how much he loves her.
“Sure you can, it drives just like any other car. Put it in drive and press the accelerator.” the man chuckles.
◠◡◠◡◠◡◠◡◠◡◠◡◠◡◠◡
Dean lays the chip bag on the coffee table and wipes his hands on his jeans. He holds his arms outstretched and open in invitation. Castiel’s face softens as he takes in Dean’s offer. He makes his way across the living room and sits on the couch next to Dean, leaning back against him. Dean wraps his arms around Castiel’s chest, hugging him from behind.
“Dean, when I asked you to be nice, I meant don’t punch Gabe. I didn’t mean for you to flirt with my best friend all afternoon.”
“It was nice talking to you,” the man says.
Claire frowns, she’s not sure what the lady in front of her is talking about… until she opens the folder and gasps at the first image that meets her eye. The photograph shows a man in a hospital bed, with bruised and battered skin, his arms and legs have many cuts and there is a lot of blood on the sheets beneath him. His skin is tinged greyish, his lips are parted slightly and his eyes are partially open and glassy.
“Nah, he’s on the swim team now, that gave him a bit more self-confidence with his body, I think. He’s always been a skinny little guy. Last year, over the summer, he finally developed some muscle, swimming will do that to ya.”
“Put that down,” Cas says, his voice shaking with fear, no matter how hard he’d tried to cover it.
“Right,” says the man, slipping on his jacket he steps toward the door, but before he reaches the handle, he stops and turns back with a slight frown, “How am I getting home?”
“I’m Castiel Novak,” Castiel types on his own phone.
Back on the boat, Cas looks over at Dean with a huge smile on his face. “This is so much more beautiful than watching a documentary. Even on the big screen we have, as much as you love that TV, the real thing is just mind-blowing.”
“That’s why?” Cas asks dumbfounded, ‘because he likes me’, he thinks to himself before editing his own thoughts and finally confessing to himself, ‘because we like each other’, he smiles at Dean... “I’m so stupid. Could you please explain again?”
Opening up the text, his eyes fall upon the message and his happy mood evaporates. A cold washes over him, chilling every fiber of his being. His breath catches in a sharp inhale as his brain tries to process what he’d just read...
Dean walks past the tents near the street, peeking in and seeing that they are set up as triage areas, he moves on, walking up the front steps of the main hospital. He weaves through the mass of people, repeatedly having to confirm that he doesn’t need treatment, he just needs to check the lists. He goes inside the hospital and takes a few minutes walking around looking at the patients hoping that just maybe he will see Cas. Maybe their eyes will meet and he’ll get to throw his arms around his husband and the search will be over. He’d hold him so tightly and pepper kisses to his face, he’d tell him how much he loves him and that Jack is safe and that it’s over now, they can go home.
“It’s ok, it’s ok. I’m not going anywhere, it’s just that there are two wonderful people waiting outside the room, who desperately want to see you.”
“SLOB.”
“The next thing is… I was talking to Sam today and it hit me like a ton of bricks. I just suddenly understood why you don’t like me flirting. I know what you had to put up with before, with your ex but I didn’t think about how it might affect you now. I was a damn fool not to work it out sooner. I’m sorry, Cas. I was an ass. I was letting you think that I didn’t care about you when that couldn’t be further from the truth. I really do, I care about you so damn much.”
His inner voice corrects.
Casey huffs a puppy sneeze and starts out into the room, sniffing a trail that matches Dean’s earlier wandering. At one point, after she sniffs at the pillow mound, she comes back to Dean and sits in front of him.
Castiel leans into Dean’s arms, resting his head on his shoulder. Dean wraps his arms around Cas’s back. Cas holds tight around Dean’s waist.
The road is rough and full of potholes and debris and the truck bounces around wildly, it jars Castiel, aggravating his injuries. He does his best not to cry out with the pain, holding it in and gritting his teeth as he endures. He won’t add any more to his daughter's distress, no matter how bad it hurts...
“Dude, I wanted to go knock on your door and tell you as soon as I read your note that I planned to be here- ya know, Friday night. But we had to get to our next destination; they were waiting for us. I wasn’t able to swing by again until Thursday morning.”
He freezes in terror as he sees the shark thrashing above the water with what appears to be a leg clamped between it’s huge and powerful jaws. He feels his whole body tense as blood splatters across the sharks teeth and face. Then the deadly creature drops back into the water, its stripy side glinting in the sunlight before disappearing from view.
Dean refocuses on his drawing for a few more minutes. Long enough that the news finally ends and Cas gets up and walks out of the room, heading to the bathroom. Dean follows a few beats later, standing in the door, leaning on the frame with sketchbook in hand and a concerned look on his face. Cas finishes his business and rolls his eyes as Dean continues to prattle on about a minor detail that he will likely discard anyway.
Dean smiles at Charlie and sees the look of distress in her eyes. “Yeah, kiddo. I’m fine.”
It takes them far longer than necessary to make it to the bedroom because they can’t stop kissing and touching each other. It’s as if they are physically incapable of breaking contact, so they stumble around, lips locked together, bumping into things along the way to the bedroom .
“Shit. Sorry, Dean. I burnt the first batch of pancakes. I got distracted.”
“I, um, I did. Benny told me where he was gonna be and that I should meet up with him, ya know, to catch up and shit.” Dean rambles.
Castiel shifts back, turning over for a moment to hurriedly tug his own pants and underwear off, he leans over Dean, gasping as Dean swipes his tongue over his nipple. He reaches across to their bedside table to where he had put their lube earlier, then moves back over Dean, pausing only to plant a warm kiss on Dean's lips, before settling back on his ankles. He squeezes some of the lube into his palm, tosses the tube aside and rubs his hand over his swollen cock.
“I - Can I kiss you?” Castiel asks.
That was the most important thing he kept telling himself, no matter how uncomfortable it got under Dean’s cold glare, do not, under any circumstances, go back to Ishim. Now that he was finally out from under the man’s grasp, it became clearer and clearer just how messed up that ‘relationship’ was. Just the way that even now, Ishim had the power to make Castiel doubt himself and think that maybe it was all his fault, was so terrifying and confusing.
Dean doesn’t come out of his room for almost two hours. Cas is back on the couch watching TV - with the volume low. Dean plods grumpily into the living room and takes a seat in the recliner, looking tense and irritated.
coworkers? How can I face them?”
“Papa?” Claire and Jack both say at the same time.
“I can’t… please, just save my daughter...” he cries out in unimaginable pain. The man pulling him, either can’t understand him or chooses to ignore his cries as he continues to drag him along. Cas can see Claire following along, keeping as close as she can without getting in the way… her worried face is the last thing he sees before his eyes roll to the back of his head and he passes out from the pain.
Dean nodded and gazed out at the street with him, the silence between them near deafening. This was so strange. After so many years and miles apart, Dean was here, a little more than a foot away from him. Cas would be lying if this close, casual proximity didn’t quicken his heartbeat.
Castiel nodded, allowing the words she spoke to sink in, but it was just so hard for him to truly believe them. “I understand. Who knows, maybe you’re right. But I was told differently. Father Alistair, for the six months I was there, told me I had demons inside of me, that they needed to be exorcised. And the first step in rejecting them was to reject myself.”
Charlie was a little disappointed to see Castiel had left before she woke up, she understood though. He needed a bit of space to gather his bearings. She decided she would text him later, see how he was doing and if he needed anything.
Becky shrugged her shoulders. “I mean, yes and no. But don’t you think Castiel should hear it from Dean instead? Could you imagine the disbelief on his face if you told him?”
Posse_Magnet67[7:53PM]: I do! I’ll be doing a photoshoot here soon.
Charlie[9:37PM]: You are drunk lol
To be honest, Dean never really noticed the guy before until he spoke with is advisor a couple days ago. He was shown a photo which helped jog his memory a bit, and if that memory served him correctly, he ascertained that Castiel was quite the nerd who stared at people too intensely.
Castiel, again, wanted to reply, but this time he couldn’t with Charlie standing there in front of him, staring at him curiously. “Who you texting, Romeo?” She asked him, nudging him with an elbow.
Gabriel’s eyes widened. “You what? Saw Mathew?” He growled low in his throat.
“Oh, that’s okay. School work is important.” He smiled to himself. Thank god he had some liquor in his system, otherwise he wouldn’t at all be brave enough to even think about flirting with this man. He shouldn’t where Alistair was concerned. But Cas couldn’t feel him right now, as though he checked out of the building for the time being. The liquor helped, he reminded himself, for now.
Dean breathed a sigh of relief. “Thank God, I knew I could always count on you Sammy…God, I feel like I was run over by a truck.”
A moment later Castiel received yet another photo from his mystery friend. This time the man’s cock was free from its confines, strong fingers wrapped firmly around himself. The tip leaking and the sight of that alone fanned the flames within him. He had to – albeit reluctantly – stop stroking himself before it ended too soon. Before he could formulate a reply, Posse Magnet sent him another message.
Something had stirred within when their eyes locked, something stubborn, there was no doubt about it.
The voice laughed and Castiel turned his head to see Dean standing there. “H-hello Dean.” He carefully stepped down off the ladder. “The next time you want to say hi, I’d prefer it if you didn’t nearly kill me in the process.” A smile broke out on his face.
Dean shrugged as he leaned up against his car, hands shoved deep in the pockets of his well-worn jeans. “My baby’s been through worse than a simple fender bender. Built her from the ground up after my dad totaled her some years back. This really isn’t that big of a deal, inconvenient for both of us, sure, but – “ He shrugged once more noncommittally. Dean pulled out his phone and made the phone call before the offer could be declined further.
“You got it!”
Keep the comments and the kudos coming!
“No…” Castiel choked. “God…I’m so sorry Claire…Daddy’s sorry.” He bent to kiss the top of her head and sobbed when he felt just how cold she really was. This was it, his worst nightmare come to fruition. His dream of raising his own pup was completely shattered. He’d never be able to chase away the monsters in her closet or underneath her bed, or kiss her boo-boos better.
“Isn’t it obvious?” He turned to look at her then. “I wasn’t cured at all. Whatever this is, whatever is inside me, its still there. It never left. And when it got a whiff of my feelings for Dean, when we finally kissed, it just…It took over. It laughed at me, said Id’ never be saved, that I’ve forsaken God.”
“Yeah of course!” Dean scoffed and fished his keys out of his pocket and made his way around to the driver side. “You know me.”
But omg! Here chapter 16! lol Im sleepy now.
Except Castiel was standing in the middle of the living room, having just gathered all of his things. Dean stopped short, disappointed to see the other man so ready to leave.
Castiel shrugged. “I don’t know. Bobby, the owner, was taking care of me when Dean walked out of the shop room to complain about something. I uh, trust me, I wasn’t expecting to see him. Ever.”
When nothing else came up, his stomach empty, the voices persisted, commanding him to continue. Castiel shook his head, anger welling up within him. “It’s not real, it’s not real.” He chanted; his mind focused solely on his own voice.
Dean had the mind to wait for a reply, if Casanova was still awake, but he passed out right after hitting send, his phone still clutched in his hand.
When Dean moved two states away he made peace with the face that he would never see Castiel again. He was okay with that. But seeing him standing there on the other side of the counter, at his place of business, it brought everything back.
But thank God it was finally Friday. Dean was ready for the weekend and more importantly, he needed to get laid. Okay, sure, it’s only been over a week since him and Anna hooked up, but since they weren’t seeing each other he was on the hunt for something sweet. A brunette maybe, with legs for miles and an ass you could bounce a quarter on. A trip to The Roadhouse never failed to provide in his time of need. So after a quick shower and a fresh pair of clothes, Dean hopped in the Impala and drove off to The Roadhouse.
“That so?” Dean arched a brow. He peeked over at Castiel, curiously wetting his lips in thought. Castiel’s cheeks flushed pink once again. There was a delicious warmth that wrapped around the omega, a heat that accompanied his natural scent. The pheromones were saturated in a warm, sweet musk that called out to Dean, tempted him…
“So I thought you said you couldn’t dance.” Posse Magnet asked him, grinning over the rim of his cup.
This one is much longer than the last, for which I am happy about and I hope you all are too. lol
It wasn’t fair, none of it was.
“You okay Cas?” Charlie asked him, effectively interrupting his thoughts. “You look a bit lost there.”
Except Castiel wasn’t just some guy. He was a strange, geeky little dude who had the most gorgeous blue eyes he had ever seen and some crazy, sexed up bedhead. Castiel had somehow managed to crawl under his skin with minimal effort involved and made himself at home. When he smiled, like, really smiled it was wide and crooked and it lit up the entire room. Castiel wasn’t just some guy, he was his friend, and Dean, shit, Dean fell for him.
“Okayy, thanks Cas.”
It was strange how much things could change in a couple months because now he was at another party specifically to meet the man in question, to see who was really behind the mask, the anonymity. Castiel was here to have fun and this time he was arriving with his friends dressed head to toe in some pretty amazing costumes. It was going to be a pretty insane night to be sure, but in a good way.
Castiel smiled. “I like that. It’s very honorable. Me, I uh, I enjoy the book store. I enjoy books. But uh, I don’t quite know if I’ve found my calling yet.”
Castiel’s scheduled CT scan went well, better than he had expected. As it turned out, he was in the clear from any other sort of severe damage from the accident, just the concussion he initially suffered. His psych evaluation went fairly well too, as well as an evaluation of his caliber can be. It was determined by the general practitioner that he go see someone regularly and given a few recommendations. Having such information in his grasp made him feel so much better, accomplished even. It was another step in the right direction.
He didn’t receive his results in his email until about two days later. To say Castiel was a nervous wreck was putting it a bit mildly. His heat was scheduled just about a month out, give or take so he really needed to get on the ball with this. The faster he could make some sort of a connection with someone, the better things may end up being for him.
Castiel chuckled at that and stepped much closer. He reached out to tentatively touch her flank, his hand gliding over the roof of the car. God, last he saw the Impala it was crushed, totaled, and he thought for sure it was beyond repair. He peered inside through the passenger window to see that everything was how it should be, how it was before the accident. Cas recalled seeing Dean stuck in the driver’s seat, limp and bleeding, a sight that had haunted him for quite some time.
CasaNova36[11:32AM]: The thought of that makes me really nervous lol You sure that’s not like, cheating?
“Yup, he clocked me good too. Didn’t think my hitting on her would trigger the end of their relationship though.”
“Papa! Oh God, Papa! Your leg!”
“Sounds like a plan.” Dean smiles and takes the gym bag from Cas.
“I put it away.” Cas answers and holds up the sheet, invitingly.
“He shared them with his coworker?” Dean asked.
Cas grins at his husband, “So, anyway, I need to be sure you guys know what room we’re staying in.” Cas gets back to the point of the discussion.
He blinks away a few stray tears that are born as his thoughts settle on his son and husband's whereabouts; were they really gone? Sickening images form in his mind of Dean’s body floating in the water, his husband lifeless and surrounded by hungry sharks, and he pictures Jack nearby screaming out for his dad. Castiel shakes his head and forces himself to be in the moment, his daughter needs him. He needs to focus on her.
Castiel glances at the man sitting in the passenger seat several times during the drive, each time he finds that the man is smiling back at him. There is something enticing about that confident smile. Castiel’s eyes flick quickly back to the road each time he is caught looking but he does take in new little details of the man’s face from every stolen glance, the freckles that are sprinkled over his cheeks, the green shine in his eyes when they are lit up by the street lights as the car passes beneath them, the way his smile reaches his eyes. ‘
“You’re flirting with the waitress.”
rather well.” chuckles Dean, earning himself a playful nudge from his husband. They settle against each other and drift off into a peaceful sleep.
When the song is over, Castiel quickly goes to the dressing room to shower off the oil and glitter. He takes the fastest shower possible and scratches out a note for one of the servers to take to Dean. He slips on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt and waits just inside the door marked “Employees Only.”  Moments later, he can hear his stage name being discussed on the other side of the door. He opens the door and tells the bouncer that everything is cool, grabbing Dean by the arm, he pulls him inside.
Ishim (Friday 10:41 PM) > Will you call so I know you’re okay?
Dean. It was so overwhelming that it sent his heart racing and his breath coming out in short rasps, mingling with Dean’s own heavy breathing.
“Huh? Uh…No.” He let out a nervous laugh. “Sorry, just distracted.” ‘I could easily kiss him right now…’
Jo grinned. “Okay, I’ll go put the order in, enjoy.” She left with a flourish and a wink directed in Sam’s direction. He flushed ever so slightly and took a sip of his beer once she was finally gone.
Posse_Magnet67[8:17PM]: Nonsense! I still have the photos you sent me a while back, you do a pretty damn good job if I do say so myself.
She wrung her hands together in a nervous sort of gesture as she came to sit down in one of the bedside chairs. “Depends on your definition of the word ‘okay’.” When Castiel didn’t comment she took in a deep breath and decided just to spit it out. “I knew who he was Cas. His online persona.”
Castiel and his friends spent the next 45 minutes touching up on each other’s makeup, taking group photos and downing more shots before they decided it was time to head out. The house wasn’t too far from campus, maybe a 15 minute walk, but since it was cold, Becky begged to call them an Uber. She got her way and the stood outside to wait.
Castiel[9:33PM]: It’s not. Dean’s mad.
“Who?” Castiel asked, noticeably confused.
“Hear who?”
“B-but, me and Becky are going to miss you.”
“Hey Gabe!” A deep voice boomed over the music, gathering the attention of Gabriel and Castiel both. Castiel recognized that voice and the person it belonged to all too well.
But Cas, man he was a natural. He couldn’t help the warmth that spread through his chest when he saw him lift his head triumphantly from the bucket, a red apple caught between his teeth, his hair dripping wet with the water. Dean had laughed, desperate to kiss him then and there.
“Yes. I’ll only add that in my experience, family isn’t all its made out to be…” He paused as he watched Dean turn back towards him, his body shifting almost imperceptibly close to him. Their knees were pressed more firmly against each other and the warmth was all that much more noticeable, distracting.
But seeing Dean here, in person?
Charlie clarified with a grin.
He shrugged, although a little painfully. “That’s what credit cards are for Sammy.”
After a moment, Castiel gathered his courage and peeked past the wall and into the kitchen. He was gone, thank God. He was going to need another drink if he was going to introduce himself to a complete stranger, stat. Well, near complete.
Posse_Magnet67[11:30AM]: Ah, I see. So, I have an effect on you, huh?
At one point, while the trio was on the way back upstairs for drinks, Castiel pulled open his phone to see if he had any messages from Posse Magnet. And sure enough there were.
Dean shook his head, finishing off his cheerios. “Nope. So I thought I’d let you know before you get in too deep with this one.”
Dean scoffed at the audacity. “You’re giving me the speech. Trust me man, I know how this goes, I’ve given it more times than I can count.”
“Its gotta be your voice.” Castiel admitted without hesitation. “I’ve missed it, it’s so…The things it does… I don’t know, honestly before I met you I never felt the need to really do anything about it. I’d take a cold shower, or I’d distract myself until it was gone. Then of course there were times where I’d wake up with a bit of a mess..” Shit, maybe he was more drunk than he thought, if this word vomit was anything to go by.
“Ohh.” Castiel glanced up at the bar wall full of liquor bottles. “Well, there’s Lucien for one. Though most of us call him Lucifer, or Luci, cause’ why not? Then there’s Uriel, another angel, oh and there’s Sammandriel. Though it was much easier just to call him Sam.”
Castiel smiled and let out a sigh of relief. “Thank you so much, Anna. I appreciate it.”
Castiel scratched the back of his head, quickly changing the subject. “Is there a reason why you’re here? You aren’t stalking me again are you?”
CasaNova36[1:16PM]: Are you disappointed I’m not someone else?
Just dont hate me...hehe
“Like what? Enlighten me.”
He was scared though; he didn’t really like the tone of the exchange in the texts and he was sure this wasn’t going to end well. There wasn’t much reason to be hopeful anyways; things never really worked out for Dean, so why would this?
Dean wasn’t sure whether it was the alcohol clouding hid mind of what, but he had to admit and agree that yeah, it was exciting. They were in contact again, living in the same town. He remembered a time where he prayed for this late at night before he fell asleep; and he has never been one for praying. But this? He wanted this once upon a time. And perhaps deep down, even as life went on, he had always wanted it. Dare he say he wanted more?
“Not at school apparently.” Castiel ran a hand through his hair, a look of worry lining his features. Which was a bit uncharacteristic of him. “You’re right. We need to study.”
“You can’t Dean.”
Despite the shocking comment, from Castiel no less, they continued to shoot pool with no real score kept in mind. Dean, of course, after having been caught, found it increasingly difficult not to stare, to watch his every move. The flow of alcohol in his veins only seemed to encourage such behavior.
He was just a little worried about the outcome. Will Castiel shove him away just as he had with Dean? Will Alistair cause a scene in the middle of the party? What about after the party? Would everything go back to normal or will things just end up being worse? All the questions above brought up a well of anxiety within him and he tried extremely hard not to swell on them.
“Really?” Naomi commented. “Well that’s a wonderful change. You seem excited about it.”
A sigh escaped Castiel’s lips as he drew closer to the house that was currently full of students, alcohol and loud, booming music. He wasn’t sure why he agreed to go to this party in the first place as it wasn’t something he ever saw himself enjoying. But he supposed his brother Gabriel’s constant pleading did him in.
The question made his pause, that constricting feeling in his chest taking hold. He somehow found his courage, however, and spoke up. “Yeah? Well what about him? He isn’t here and I’m keeping my distance from him anyway.”
The thought brought more tears to Castiel’s eyes as he gazed up at Dean. “I would have said something, Dean..I wouldn’t have allowed it to go this far…I’m sorry, but I just, I need to go.” He turned to leave and this time Dean didn’t stop him.
Realizing he still had the towel clutched in his hand, he decided to sling it over his shoulder before pulling open the door and stepping inside. “Heya Cas!” He announced, beaming. “I thought I saw you walk on in here.”
“Ash! Ash! He replied!” Charlie’s excitement was through the roof. She honestly didn’t think that he ever would reply to her and that they would be stuck in here in limbo, wondering who the hell this guy was, even though they were pretty positive it had to be Dean. How the hell else could it be?
“What woman was this?” Benny gathered all the cue balls and prepared to line up a shot.
They both laughed.
Dean let out a content sigh as he sat back down on the couch, a slice of pizza poised in his hand. He bit into it, chewing thoughtfully and reflecting back on the evening. He took a sip of his beer, only just then taking notice of his brother’s eyes on him. Sam was grinning, a knowing look in his eyes. “What the hell are you looking at?” He took a few more bites of pizza.
Castiel smiled. He hadn’t seen her in so long; he just wished it was under different circumstances.
More great shit is on the horizon
“Y-yeah…God, that’s rough. Have you talked to anyone about it?”
What was going to happen after the party in the days to come? Castiel couldn’t like…If him and Posse Magnet had an amazing connection at the party and everything went well, Cas couldn’t in good faith pursue something with him when he already told Dean he had to step away for personal reasons. He needed help, needed to seek it and get better before he could be with anyone.
Gabriel does not miss the almost fond tone in his brother’s voice; he shakes his head “Yeah, okay, Cassie. Maybe you should get some sleep now? Sounds like you had an eventful night.”
He stops in the courtyard after class when he sees the little calico cat. He watches the cat bat at a flower and roll in the grass. Smiling, he kneels down to pet him. The cat suddenly leaps up and runs to the bench, where someone just sat. Dean looks over at the seat to see why the cat left him. His breath catches when he sees who is seated there, petting his little friend.  It’s the hot guy from the Roadhouse last week. He watches them for a moment before his brain kicks into gear and he walks over to the bench, motioning to the empty half of the seat in silent question. The man acknowledges by smiling and nodding. Dean sits, reaching over to scratch the cat behind the ears.
When the truck starts moving, Claire stands up to watch the road. Castiel is unable to move, so he just watches her face, he sees her eyes searching for any sign of her dad and brother. Then he sees her eyes widen, he can only imagine what she is seeing but from the look on her face, he can tell it is nothing good. Tears trickle down her cheeks and Castiel wants nothing more than to be able to get up and hold her. To hug her tightly and shield her from the horrors she is witnessing.
Dean hadn’t paid much attention to how much Cas had grown over the past couple of years, and he didn’t realize the kid was now almost as tall as him, or that he had gone all goth in his look.  No longer a geeky kid with khakis and too-big sweaters.
“Shut it, man.” Dean shoots back, “I just need to stop a minute to leave a note. I ain’t gonna make us late.”
“Thank you, Charlie! We love you, Charlie!” Benny yells from the background.
“Goodnight, little angel,” says Castiel fondly, as he and Dean stand side by side next to their son’s bed, “have a good sleep. Lots of fun things to do tomorrow.”
“Don’t you bitch at me. I need something to look at when I’m at work. Nothing better than pictures of my sexy boyfriend.”
While waiting for Castiel to come out of surgery,  Dean’s thoughts run wild. His mind goes through every possible version of events that could unfold, the good, and the bad. He thinks about how they could, they could all get to go home. Castiel could come out of that room, patched up, and wake with a smile as he gazes up at his family all gathered around his bed.
“Well, hello again,” says the gorgeous blue-eyed man. The same man he was just talking to while petting the little calico cat, the same man he has been thinking about since bumping into him at the Roadhouse.
Cas takes Dean’s hand as they walk to the door of the restaurant, “Not much. Went to the market, picked up a few things we were low on… I really just wandered around for most of the time, looking at the different stalls.” Cas in no way wants to let Dean know that he was feeling low and jealous of Dean’s time with the people at the school. Dean is in a wonderful mood and has had a great morning, Cas loves to see Dean in such good spirits.
Posse_Magnet67[1:20PM]: Whatever! It’s a genius play on words that shines a light on an aspect of my life.
“Just until we get together again.” He handed Dean the notebook.
Dean would be the perfect candidate if he were being perfectly honest. And, if he were so bold as to imagine it, he could easily imagine Dean as the alpha he needed close by, the alpha he could hold onto, nuzzle into, scent and fuck…Castiel was getting ahead of himself. Good God, maybe his heat was much closer than he thought, or perhaps it was just the whiskey making him warm all over.
He shrugged his shoulders. “He didn’t. Not really anyway. So long as I was cured then he didn’t care what they did to me. I eventually figured it out though, how to beat the system. When they showed me a straight couple Id focus on the man in the images. It was the only way I could prove to them that it was working, even if it really wasn’t. But,” He sighed shakily. “They weren’t finished with me, Alistair wasn’t finished with me…” Castiel paused for a moment as he remembered what Alistair did to him, shuddering as he recalled the way in which he was defiled.
Castiel hummed around a bite of food, a memory of the night prior to that morning replaying in his mind. He had been fairly drunk during the call, but he could still clearly recall baring his soul to someone whom he was certain was a near complete stranger.
“Yes?”
Dean ran his fingers through Castiel’s hair and he pressed himself close. Oh, how he didn’t want to part, not yet, not while his response to him was so intense, real. Who would have thought he could kiss like this?
“Well, either way, I still have time to figure that out. I’m going out with him again in a few days. Sam’s going to take me to the museum.”
“Well then you explain it to me Dean. The fact that you met a guy online who you didn’t know was your tutor until wayyy later is uncanny. Of all the people on that app you could have picked, you happened to pick Castiel, the one person who turned out to be the catalyst for your coming out. Sure sounds like fate to me.”
Cas supposed now was a good time as any to clue her in on everything. He hadn’t divulged too many details to her when he told her about how his car broke down on the highway, Dean Winchester being the biggest one.
“Yeah?” Castiel instantly regretted the change in subject because now Dean looked thoughtful, as though he were really contemplating the idea. Fuck, Castiel wasn’t sure he’d be able to handle seeing Dean with someone else. “Eh, well, I don’t know.”
He opened the app and began typing away.
It fucking sucked.
“Yeah, I do. Won’t be there until four, but –“
“W-what do you mean?”
“Pretend it didn’t happen?” Dean finished for him with a nervous chuckle. “Yeah of course.”
“No way…” Despite how much of a genius Becky sounded, Charlie was still skeptical. Sort of. The more the idea processed in her mind, the clearer everything became. It all seemed to add up perfectly. Especially the part where Castiel’s friend didn’t want to reveal himself; was it Dean? And did he know he was talking to Castiel? Becky’s simple observation born from a writer’s mind seemed to explain a lot, but there were countless holes that still needed to be filled. “Becky, you might be a genius.”
“Okay.” He came back with the mushrooms and added them to the cutting board. “Chop those up roughly.”
“I uh…I’m just gonna go for a walk.” Cas watched as Dean turned to glance at him before he left the kitchen to grab his shoes and jacket.
Castiel likely didn’t feel anything towards Dean except for friendship, if that considering the years between them. Cas left abruptly, broke Dean’s heart and for the longest time he was sure that Cas really hadn’t felt much for him at all. Sure, maybe at the beginning, but that kiss…Dean triggered something there. Something happened and Cas shoved him, pushed him away.
“I know you will,” says Sam with certainty.
Jack makes a choked whimpering sound and clings to his dad as he almost begs, “Can I stay up with you? I don’t want to go to sleep.” He tucks his head into Dean’s chest, “Please?”
“Okay,” Dean says, sounding far more determined than he feels. He climbs carefully out of the back of the truck, “I’m going to go in and check this place. I’ve got the list.” He nods at his fellow passengers as he holds up a scruffy looking sheet of paper. Then he turns his attention to the driver, his eyes pleading as he begs, “Please, just give me ten extra minutes here, this is a big place, there are a lot of people and lots of names on those lists to check through.”
Dean can’t figure out why it bothers Cas so much, he knows he doesn’t mean it. He has told Cas before that he’s always been this way, he doesn’t mean anything by it and people that know Dean already know what he’s like. It’s not like he is leading anyone on, his friends and family know he is with Cas, he’s happy with Cas… He’s just a natural flirt. He looks up at Cas who seems to be glaring at the floor now and a small defiant part of him rears its head, forcing him to bite back the remark that Cas should lighten up.
Sam’s brother was one grade behind Gabe, and in much the same situation, having no mom and a dad who was a long haul trucker, so, gone all the time. Dean was a smart kid, too, and athletic. Dean played baseball at school and worked on cars at his part-time job.
Dean drops his phone on the seat and sighs. He thanks all the phone and internet gods for the power of texting, because he would never have made it through that conversation if he had to use spoken words.
He catches his daughter watching him and staring at his wounded leg; he knows it looks bad and by the look on his daughter’s face, he can tell that she knows it’s bad too. To try to alleviate her worries, he straightens up and smiles, “It’s going to be fine. It’s nothing a doctor won’t be able to stitch up in a flash.”
“Give the kids and Cas all hugs from me. Have fun. Love you guys.”
“So, um, Dean. You’re not married or with anyone are you?”
“How did you find out?” all the anger was gone from Dean’s voice and sadness took its place.
“It’s going to be fine,” soothes Castiel, turning back to Dean once he is certain that their son is asleep, “besides, I recall that it was you who suggested Thailand.”
The man nods and disappears from the hole. Dean swipes some dirt from his face and looks up into the sky, the brilliant blue looks oddly familiar and comforting. He imagines Cas is looking up at the same sky, right now, wondering where he is. He feels as though the sky is Castiel looking down on him, suddenly he can place that wondrous shade of blue, Castiel’s eyes. He looks up, smiling slightly at the thought that his husband is somehow watching over him, but sombering at the thought that if Castiel is watching over him from the sky… their last kiss. Would be ‘their last kiss’. He frowns at the now treacherous seeming heavens and the false comforts they offer.
The following morning, the same car pulls to a stop in front of the house just moments after Sam leaves for work. Ishim is once again watching the house. He watches the neighborhood and gets glimpses of Cas when he passes in front of the window. An hour later he leaves.
Suddenly, Jack’s face appears above him, looking down at him with wide eyes from the hole in the roof, his face lights up with relief as he spots Dean.
When we last saw Cas and Dean, Dean was still in a coma from the accident.
His phone immediately pings, and he checks the messages.
Fear and confusion make her feel powerless, barely anyone here speaks English - and they are all already busy trying to save lives - she can’t find her voice enough to ask for help and she feels in the way and angry. This can't happen.
He turns to her and she sees the cut on his chest, blood staining his torso. “You’re bleeding so bad.”
Claire's face turns, her eyes meet his and her whole body goes rigid, as she sucks in a shocked gasp.
He sees his daughter look at the woman who had leaned over to help her and nod her head shakily in thanks. He feels a rush of gratitude towards the woman, for helping her. He can’t see her back, but Claire’s legs from what he can tell only have superficial scratches on them.
Yeah, he needed to stop while he was ahead. It was all innocent banter though, right? Dean was the one with the problem, his mind drifting in horribly naughty directions. Maybe he needed to get laid…Yes, he definitely needed to get laid. He needed soft skin, long hair he could grasp onto and tug, hips he could dig his nails into…Feminine cries of pleasure; the whole nine yards really. Dean could go out tonight, find himself a nice girl and take her home, or go back to her place. Whatever worked.
Castiel had nothing to say in response to that. His body language said it all really. The pink coloring returned to his cheeks and he averted his gaze bashfully and in doing so he revealed the unmarked side of his neck safe for a couple stray freckles here and there. Jesus…
