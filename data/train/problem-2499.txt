Gladstone jerks his great long neck forward, raising gooseflesh on Sherlock’s neck. His eyes swivel wildly in his skull, focusing and refocusing out on the vast ocean beyond the cliffs as the three of them walk.
“Sherlock, it’s so early, did you know I was still up? Oh, I can duck back into my room for the pair of you, I won’t bother you at all—”
That is, until he hears that someone’s companion say back, “That’s the one with the island pony.”
patting the horse’s shoulder with misplaced fondness. The crowd above is growing louder as the wind lapses. Sherlock hardly breathes, the ocean stealing all his air.
The tavern is a riot of noise and smells, and Sherlock feels both overcrowded and exposed at once. He hunches his shoulders, looks up. Lights swing overhead, close to the low, exposed timber ceiling, and snippets of loud conversation whirl around the barrel-like tables and in the ale-scented air. It smells so heavily that Sherlock could get drunk on the scent of whiskey alone.
“Didn’t say that.”
“—Then let me show you something. Can I?”-
It is slow-going, but Sherlock watches his mouth form Gladstone’s name, watches Gladstone’s withers shake in response, like a rattlesnake’s tail, noiseless. Soon, Gladstone tucks his chin, and the scream fades into a groaning, grunting sound. Next, it ceases entirely. Lowering his hands, Sherlock can feel his ears ringing. He shakes his head, but that does not help.
“Must’ve been snogging someone before breakfast,” Lestrade says, waving down a bartender for another drink.
John just waves him near.
Shocked, nerves thrilled by the danger, Sherlock throws himself away from the cliff and runs across the open sand as Gladstone spins frantically, shaking like a dog to free himself of the bells, to Hope’s fallen body near the surf. Sherlock collapses himself, hardly out of reach of Gladstone’s angry rearing.
Only to find that his feet have sunk into the sand.
John is usually so simple to read. Sherlock wishes that were true now, the champion is so suddenly unreadable. His expression has softened, but not changed dramatically. He's still looking down onto the beaches, where sandpipers are picking at the rocks. In a few minutes they'll realize their efforts are fruitless, and return to the sandy side of the island. He longs to take John’s face in his hands, feel his skin, the way he had when John saved him from the grey
are out of their depth, which is always, they consult me. I eliminate everything impossible, and whatever remains, must be the truth.”
Urging John to argue with his employer has gone badly. The bags beneath his eyes are deeper than the trenches just past the shallows, and his fists are clenched beneath his crossed arms. His shoulders sag heavily into the back of the cliffs. Ahead of him, the crowd is thinner and spotting, as if the people making it up know to give John a good line of sight to Hope.
Redbeard has retreated to the beach, Sherlock can hear him squealing in panic and frenzy - Sherlock needs to get to him, he can hear and feel the savage water horses nearby, hungry.
Shame burns hot in Sherlock’s throat. He’s already given his blood. It isn’t like he can take it back. What can he say?
He lets Sherlock through and pockets the key to the Ford in pants that are several years old and have seen less muddy days. They’re also wet, over John’s knees and more importantly his thighs, sticking to the muscle and shaping it. After a second it registers that John must’ve gotten wet when hauling Sherlock over the edge of the quay and sitting beside him, but John has said nothing about the chill. For most of the last twenty years, working at the Stockyard, John has likely said nothing about many things that bother him.
“Oh, that’ll be nice. There’s always fun things to do in Skarmouth the night before. Me and my ex-husband, you know--”
“Hey.”
The pressure shifts to his cheek, a tender swipe where Moriarty had clawed. Almost as if John kissed him. The scratches sting. “No.”
Sherlock is at the beach.
Sherlock still smells like fish and sand and blood when he goes to bed.
Just how many times is he going to escape death with a bullet inches from his heart? Hadn't she aimed for his skull?
Gladstone throws his head back, suddenly, and John pulls him back down with a practiced expertise. This has done great work to illustrate the point to Henry Knight, the point that John does not have the time or patience for Henry Knight’s mainland questions right now. The water horse bares his flat yellow teeth. He has come alive in the darkness.
Watson looks at the horse’s long, thin ears, and then reaches forward with his almighty grin, and twists one back, so hard it must hurt. Sherlock nearly winces in phantom pain. The water horse does nothing, doesn’t even make a noise.
If he pulls closer to the water, the spot which other riders fear, John said they could have a genuine chance. Sherlock kicks, and Redbeard’s form tears across the sand. Strands of his mane whip Sherlock’s face but it is nothing compared to the bite of the cold wind. Where is John?
The island won’t forgive him if he pulls back, and neither will the spider. He won’t risk the revocation of John’s racing terms just because nerves are making his hands shake.
John’s house has sat unused and unvisited for decades. Compact and faded blue, it blends in to the light-washed Thisby sky around it. There is a small stable out back, just off the unbeaten road. It’s quiet, out here, but at night Skarmouth’s glow is visible against the dark.
Time slows. Mrs Hudson drops her fork, and it clatters to the wooden floor, and Sherlock shoves back his chair, standing and going to collect it from the ground. He whips around to drop it into the sink. Metal clings and pings against aluminum.
By the edges of the land, where the grass begins to thicken and clot, against the grey and white skies, heavy and hanging with the weight of water, is that great big black
Sherlock locks his hands on wrists and exclaims, “You arranged to draw that sigil! This year and last! You wanted your own man to lose the Races! You
John’s two-room flat is as small as Sherlock remembers, and he remembers perfectly.
Sherlock slips his shoes on over his socks. He brushes down his suit jacket, tweaking the edge of the lapel notch.
The tendons in his twisted neck are prominent and the braided reins are pulled away from his side, thrown up into the open air where John must’ve tossed them. There are tinges of pink and dusky grey to Gladstone’s black mouth. The wisps of wet hair call back to mind the night Sherlock spent running from the piebald. Or, that's in the future, now. Strange to think about it. He wonders briefly if the very water horse was out in the ocean at this time, or if it came to eat something on land before.
Redbeard surmounts the last pair of hotheaded
“The Stockyard doesn't hire just anyone. They’ve that rider, oh, what's he called? Well, that young man’s won five years in a row, now, despite getting nearly trampled last year, and with the prize so big, the Yard can afford to hire whoever they want. And they don't have just ordinary horses, either,” warns Mrs Hudson. The woman reaches into the stall to pat Josephine’s soft nose. “They aren't like old Josey, here.”
In a corner of the room in the hospital there were two carved elephant figurines, put there by a nurse who had both an obsession and an affinity with putting elephants in rooms. Her last job had been as an interior decorator. The elephants were facing each other on the shelf, and their trunks were touching.
A breeze soughs through the full branches and ripples the water and the edges hard and firm.
All with a rider still tethered to its back.
Redbeard snorts, and, in his turn, drags Sherlock out of his thoughts.
Water batters and roars, lunging and taking. Very much a hungry wolf. The blood from the morning Races were not enough to quell it for another year. It needs more.
Lestrade blows out a breath. He doesn't understand it any more than Sherlock. First mint green, and now this? Without acknowledgement, Sherlock proceeds further into the house, keeping watch and a running list in his head of all the strange decor.
In island ponies, it's a sedative, a painting used to chill their hearts and relax them as the Thisby winds moan and kick up startlers. But there's no record of it ever being used on
Sherlock looks at him. “What?”
Mrs Hudson is at the stove when he descends, her apron tied over her dress and her thin hair pinned back. It reminds him of Josephine outside. She fusses with a pan and the kettle before she turns and spots him. She flinches, touches her chest out of surprise, and then swats him with an oven mitt for sneaking up on her.
It’s barely noon.
John is humming to Gladstone. There are no words, it’s a small sound and lower than the scream, and Sherlock can only hear because of how close he is to the source.
“Yes.”
“You sure you're up for that?”
Feeling Sherlock’s eyes, John explains, “Some of the horses at the Yard have
Others who escaped the struggle at the starting line aren’t so distracted. Seasoned riders are well-practiced at this game, and are gaining ground ahead of Sherlock. From back here, he can see the leering that
His dreams consist of the way the sun looks when it hits the chalk cliffs, blinding him. The day is clear until it isn’t. The sea turns black then red.
“But then you’d have to be seen dragging a girl’s dead, bloody body around, wouldn’t you? Hm?”
It smarts, the disregard and dehumanization. John isn't even a pawn in Moriarty's view. He's not a player, he's nothing. A speck of dust, a loitering aggravation, an obstacle.
John didn't matter.
“Bloody hope you learnt something from that castle of yours.”
better than anyone else on the island. What is it you want.” Here, he steals Sherlock’s very words. “I’ve made every horse in that stable what they are.”
“Shut the door, could you?” He asks gently. Sherlock feels the wind as he latches the lock into place.
Sherlock squeezes John’s arm harder, firming his grasp. His fingers curl against the worn jacket, wrinkling the leather patches.
Outside again, the mare goddess is dancing in the streets, a woman in a taxonomic horse head waving to and fro, side to side on the cobblestone, sprinkling pebbles where she goes with human hands. Smaller children are following her, looking for the one shell she will drop tonight, which by tradition will grant them a wish. Traditionally, her feet are bare. Given the size of them and the build of the woman under the costume, Sherlock deduces that it’s Irene Adler under that mask tonight.
There are whoops and hollers from the crowd of riders and spectators, unlike the feedback from any other pledged rider. Just as there were in the tavern, when Watson had first signed up, men are celebrating their returning champion.
Why is he so absolutely helpless?
Sherlock cannot hold down one of those creatures. He cannot. It’s not a matter of whether or not he’ll be trying hard enough, whether or not his mind has the capability or his body lacks it. Those things are predators, they call to each other beneath the water and sound like whale songs, gentle and soothing.
“I would shake your hand,” Moriarty puffs out a long breath through his cheeks, breaking the silence, “but I think that we are both beyond that, and that you’ve got someone
Mrs Hudson waves a hand, calling him silly.
Sherlock approaches, and touches the edge of the hard wooden desk. Moriarty’s eyes linger on his fingers, where they slip against the smooth grain of polish. Sherlock glances up, a question in his eyes, but he does not vocalize it. A distraction.
He pretends to slash through the air, stepping where the victim might have as she fell, deliberately bumping into Donovan. Little hands hold tight to his scarf as Sherlock flourishes but John can keep steady. “-- as he fought her, the cat hair on him brushed up onto her skirt. Got caught in the zipper.”
Sherlock bites out, “This isn’t your property.”
Gladstone stands high, proud and hurt, his whole form shivering. Sherlock has never seen a water horse unchanged by the ocean.  Gladstone balances the weight of one of his hind legs on the tip of a hoof. A riderless horse is stalking the edges of the land, prancing and fighting in iron chainmail, but takes no interest in Sherlock’s movement.
The horse snaps its neck back and screams, piercing and agonizing, and it jumps. Its knees crumple as seaweed spills out its nose, and it dives, and disappears beneath the surface of the water. A second later, it reemerges and rears, shrieking and somewhere, distantly, people are yelling. It leaps, and a wayward hoof knocks into John Watson, and when it shoves down, the rider is under the water.
Sherlock glares at her in the doorway.
The man in the bowler hat holds out the leadrope and crows to passer-bys. One man stops, Doctor Fletcher. Sherlock has always liked him, even if the doctor is indifferent to him. He's handsome, levelheaded, and generally calm with everyone, even those insane patients of his. Sherlock wanted to marry him when he was six, when his father brought him in for a fever.
Sherlock’s breath is coming in faster. He tries not to remind himself of Mary, and Mary’s shrieking, or the way she moves, the way they all move, and the way they always smell like something has curled up inside them and died, and they are breathing it out.
The mist is gone. The air is heavy with unshed rain.
he hears from the horse.
Here, they are still at the lesser-used portion of the beach, but it is not just John that Sherlock has found. There are many people, and above all of their figures towers Gladstone, with shiny bridle and saddle that is not John’s around his face and over his withers.
He’s unable to gather his bearings fast enough to avoid all suspicion. “What other choice is there? This is an invitation.”
The black shape grows bigger, and bigger, and Sherlock can see the rider on its back, but it could be anyone, it could be someone who hates him, who agrees with the islanders— The weak sun catches on the black horse’s striking white mane, where a rider’s hands are currently clutching onto, weaving braids in threes and sevens, threes and sevens. Then the clouds part and more light streaks over a head of light hair, mounted on the water horse’s back.
Obvious from the rest of the house. Old photographs and the memorabilia of two people, yet the signs of being lived in from only one. Sherlock’s gaze flashes to the black side table beside her sofa across the room, where one teacup sits in a lonely painted saucer. Handle faces left, one of the many signs that betrays Shadwell’s left-handedness.
“Hello,” Sherlock returns in a low baritone.
The champion rider tries the keys once, then twice. Sherlock has to reach over to set them just in the right spot for the engine to go off, and the vehicle sputters to life just as it had on Sherlock’s trip into town.
Try as he might, the spider won’t dislodge from his mind. Moriarty’s veiled threats echo around the studio flat, curling around the unswept corners and haunting the slivers of shadow in the floorboards.
in disguise, come ashore to trick all of them, like the Scottish man’s mainland kelpies. Sherlock remembers the way islanders had considered Jefferson Hope’s comments about John’s tidepool eyes.
Sherlock parks the Ford with a squeal of tired breaks, stopped up against the grass outside the pasture of Mrs Hudson’s. He tucks the keys into his pocket, briefly fluttering a hand at his side and idling by the car. Mrs Hudson has none of his gifts of perception, but last night wasn’t her bridge night with Mrs Turner, and so she is bound to have noticed his absence.
There is no nightmarish water horse waiting for him, blood draining from cracked femur bones and flat teeth.
” Sherlock groans, the unexpected, blinding pressure makes heat explode over him again, over and over, as John drives the single finger in and out of him. “John - John, stop it.”
What else could be trapped within this series of caverns?
His curiosity and nosiness peaks, and after the deafening drums have gone by, cymbals screaming and beats thudding in his feet, he slips towards the corner of the building he's pressed against. The streetlights cast orange spheres on the walk and street below, but he is encased in black and shadow.
There. No worse words have ever been spoken to him. The implication that as some officers deceive Lestrade, John deceives Sherlock, has not been allowed into his mind before now. The idea grows. John’s wide eyes, his brilliance, it’s all too good for Sherlock -- isn’t it?
John meets Sherlock’s gaze. He’s panting, and looks a little dazed. Is he surprised that worked? Sherlock almost calls him amazing, but catches his tongue. Instead, he blinks away the water in his eyes and pushes his hair from its plastered place against his forehead.
When put it like that, it makes him sound like some kind of… good person. Sherlock scowls.
Sherlock is jostled ever closer to the mounting side of the blood-stained rock. At first, he fights his way back to his old spot to keep watching, but as the minutes drag by, he lets himself be swept away by the current of racers. Last chance to back out. Last chance to turn his tail. He won’t get the entering fee back, but it’s better than losing his life. Like the horrible blonde mare, Sherlock’s breath starts coming in faster. But this isn’t about being trapped on land and on the earth, it’s about feeling trapped in this thin spiderweb of commitment.
“Your pony is frightened, Sherida,” The man on the chestnut says, and presses his horse close again, hard and knocking against Redbeard, so close Sherlock can taste the stench of sun-bloated seals and baked kelp on rocks after high tide.
“Goodmorning, Molly. How was your evening with Detective Lestrade?”
An enormous blonde neck slams into the other side of Gladstone.
Maybe this is a bad idea. A very bad idea. But Sherlock's in a room full of people who have the same idea. Perhaps it isn't terrible...
Lestrade could
Sherlock’s face flushes, but he keeps markedly cool when he clears his throat. “Ah, yes.” He says, suddenly gaining interest in the mainland magazines on the table. He picks one up and opens it to cover his expression, clearing his throat again. It’s a moment before he continues, considering that Mrs Hudson should be aware of his whereabouts. “He… asked me back, this evening.”
Sherlock’s body immensely and at once misses the comfort of John’s solid figure beside him, and finds himself longing to banish the steps John has taken to walk from him and cover the distance again. It is a feeling not unlike his desolate hunger after the pub, where they had raced after the file thief together, as if all the world existed to be between them. John’s hand had covered his, real in the tavern in front of Lestrade, and so,
“My father thought it was,” Henry replies smoothly without looking at him. Sherlock would be able to gather more information from the monger, but John doesn’t have his gifts.
The castle continued to be an eyesore and in the way of everything. Sherlock texted Lestrade upwards of seventy times to come and move it to at least the sitting room table. It may have been covered in papers and files and dirty plates that Mrs Hudson has chastised him about a hundred times, but Sherlock could… make space for it.
“Car.”
What had that secret conversation been about? Why would Sherlock promise anything to Moriarty for John’s sake? Hadn’t John done enough for him, essentially kicking him off the racing beaches in those first few days? Or maybe Sherlock felt indebted somehow, and as John has observed he’s a man who doesn’t like to have outstanding debts. The questions race in John’s mind just as quickly as they had last night in Sherlock’s sitting room.
Lestrade looks like he's enjoying this. Sherlock plays with the collar of his coat to shake off some of his own paralysis, to stretch.
“Whose Races are they? Who doesn't want me riding?”
He leans against the door, and shuts his eyes, breathing deeply.
Hope laughs. So does the man in the bowler hat. His isn't a mean laugh, per se, but it isn't a thoughtful one, either.
“He promised you he’d race, then,” John observes. But Sherlock was already doing that. There must have been a new equation in the mix, something that nobody was telling John about. Something
The beach is chaos.
Always John’s name, always at the forefront of his mind, even when he isn’t there.
For a week, the island grows colder. The air begins to sizzle with magic, until it has sewn itself around everyone’s bones, like red string pulling on puppet limbs. It coaxes femurs into making people walk, holds skulls tight and squeezes them until people are nothing but a mindless sack of saltwater. The sea relinquishes more water horses to the island.
There must be close to fifty riders here, of the ones Sherlock can see and deduce. There’s a six to one tourist to rider ratio, with the riders as the minority. A great many people are here to watch. Sherlock may lose his head in all the noise. Race reports, yes, he’s read those in the past, and he knows there’s never been close to fifty riders in the past. Sherlock frowns. What happens to all of them?
Among the chaos, one iron red stallion charged into the ocean, its mane shifting until it shimmered as if made of pearl, head already lengthening. The reddened sea swallowed it up, bubbles bursting white at the top of the churning water.
A display of weaponry will not thwart him, but rather emboldens him. John sets his jaw and demands, leaning closer, “You say you want Sherlock Holmes. What does Gladstone have to do with him?”
John parses this.
He figures he can use the rest to treat Redbeard. To get him to go faster.
“And you’re sure we’re not about to be arrested?” John clarifies, but he’s already shifting through the old doorway. This sneaking-about excitement has him on high alert, though it’s different than usual - there are no capaill for him here, it’s only humans they must avoid, and his hearing is pricked for any sound that could come from the station.
It’s an old island funeral, where the body is burned into ashes that the fire flickers over into the wind, and rolls coldly down into the water far below. Meant for those born here, those who always knew they would perish here. The funeral-goers are one massive creature in the night, close together, huddled around the bonfire and Father Stamford.
Mrs Hudson frowns. The low light catches on her thin lips, and she looks down, brushing the hay dust from her skirts, “I paint teapots for the tourists, it hardly counts. I’d help, Sherlock, but I don't have the kind of money Mister Anderson wants. The rich people are all involved with the Races.”
Sherlock clears his throat, pulling the fabric of the dress out gently so he can see the bloodstains. “Yes, it was horrifyingly obvious. I only agree to explain it to you simpletons because I don’t feel as though anyone on the island should purchase their meat from a murderer… Quite a hazard. The
The possibility of being found by someone who was distinctly not an officer hadn’t been foreseen by him. Damn.
But John is dropping further away.
“Have you changed your mind?” Moriarty asks. His greasy gaze slides to Sherlock, taking in his appearance. Sherlock purposefully presses his side more into John’s wet shoulder, refusing to be embarrassed about being caught in a sopping towel and jumper, on property that is not his own, nor his companion’s. He belatedly hopes that John has more dry clothes he could borrow.
He had never imagined this much raw power was normally held at bay by John’s expert hands on the reins. Is this what the
“Heading out, Mrs Hudson!” Sherlock calls through the open door, his ear cocked for a reply. There's the scramble and a clatter. She must have dropped her package of hair curlers.
Hope rumbles, a chuckle, and the locals who get the poke of fun (Sherlock Holmes, speechless) laugh, some too loudly for the deadly quiet of the scene.
“I am glad you’re here, Sherlock. Really, I am. Using Henry Knight as a delivery system?” He blows out his lips. “A match made in heaven, we are.”
The man since holding the great black
Sherlock smirks, “Depends.”
It is sharp, long, and perfect. Should Moriarty come at him, Sherlock’s hand will flash out and he will end the Stockyard owner, end his ruling hand over Thisby. But it is unwise to assume Moriarty will come at him physically at all.
John says, “There’s no getting through to you, is there?” Sherlock shakes his head, a negative. John laughs and Sherlock focuses on the storm and the thunder and the piebald a little less.
is a thin and gaunt equine figure, black as the night with blazing white hair tied in flat braids, wet and pasted to its skin and bones. Gone is the heavy muscle trained so hard for; a cadaver of a horse waits in the water.
Sherlock scratches the corner of the compression bandage at his ribs. "It
Someone who no doubt thinks they're hilarious has written
Even though his eyes don’t give much away from up here, Sherlock catches the way John’s chin tilts up and then back down a half-second later, tracking down the whole of Sherlock’s form. John says, quite loudly, “Oh. That’s nice.”
“I don't want you to get hurt. Those things— they're so nasty…”
But his wants for the outcome have shifted, mottled, changed. What he’d once admitted wasn’t the entire truth anymore.
Worse, the knight
John is now pointing to the cavern’s high, swooping ceiling, far above both of their heads and supported only vaguely by naturally-made columns of barnacle-covered rock. Above, there are darker shapes, and lighter ones, etched into the stone, or pressed on in the shapes of horses, people, houses, islands, boats, and waves.
And then he’s replacing it with a dry, big towel. Sherlock instinctively pulls it tight around his chest, ducking his chin. John seems to produce another from thin air. The ceiling rattles when thunder quakes.
It’s too much of a stretch to get in, so Sherlock is graced with John pulling out and leaning back over him as the man reaches for the lubricant beside the bed, feeling that radiant heat of his body and the brush of John’s lips against his once John has refreshed the slickness in his palm, coating his fingers. While tipping his head up to meet John’s mouth to feel the wet heat of his tongue and the kind vibration as John hums, Sherlock slips a hand between their naked bodies.
John’s hand cards up into Sherlock’s hair, catching on unbrushed curls. Sherlock melts, tilting his head back, and he can feel the rise of John’s cheek as the man smiles at his neck.
“Next you’ll be saying that I’m -
After a moment of confusion, Sherlock can see it. Up where the man’s hand is clutching Gladstone’s halter, not the reins. On Redbeard, Sherlock would keep his hand lower than that, and Redbeard doesn't require that much force to be moved, and doesn't have teeth that would maim him rather than lip at him in a friendly manner. He imagines Redbeard taken from him.
“That'll be fine, thank you, Mrs Hudson.”
“There’s a ferry that leaves in the morning,” John interjects, “the killer could leave Thisby, or could’ve left already.”
“No. It’s you. It’s Gladstone and Redbeard.”
“Just come up, you’ll see what I mean.”
moving around underneath it. Internally, he is busy berating himself for being too unmotivated to solve the poisoning case yesterday. Really. Pathetic.
deep within him that Moriarty also tore the pages from his books to give to the poisoned tourist, only to recover it after his death and before the police appeared on the scene, so that no one but Sherlock could open it. But there’s a lack of proof. Anything he could bring to Lestrade right now would make him look insane. More insane than usual.
But the fact that both bodies are in the same place remains. There is no such thing as coincidence.
“Shore-
Redbeard snorts, dips his head to the stones.
His brow twitches involuntarily, jaw aching sorely at the hinges, enough for him to recognize, even vaguely, he must have had a tube down his throat for a significant amount of time. It isn't a dream anymore.
“Better?” John asks, tossing the cloth somewhere onto the floor. It’s clear he isn’t thinking ahead, about how it will be to find that in the morning. John likely won’t care much, he might laugh about it, or his ears will turn that lovely shade of scarlet that they are now as his thoughts circle to what secret has just transpired.
“How the hell do you know that?” Donovan sneers.
“John doesn’t need a history lesson, Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock interrupts, continuing to stab at his papers.
condition because it’s been in your keep alongside your figurine! It hasn’t been to battle with you, so it appears new.”
“I've just put the kettle on the stove, would you like a cuppa?”
Was that sarcasm? Sherlock scoffs, “Children are boring.”
“You wanted to see my face when John died.” Sherlock inflicts his voice with as much command as he can muster, his throat hoarse and ribs creaking. John glances to him. “And now you can see my face when you go over these cliffs.”
In the paddock, the mare, a statue, is watching them, too.
At once, Sherlock recalls John’s disappointment yesterday morning, that Sherlock would retrieve more evidence alone and John would have to return to the Stockyard to assist with the youngstock auction, and play further into Moriarty’s hand. John likes it, the rushing, the chasing, the danger. How wide his eyes had been, sprinting after the file thief like it was the purpose of his whole existence.
“The killer is an
“No, John. I answered honestly.”
Sherlock fits the saddle in place, and shoves his left foot in the stirrup, pushes up, and swings a leg over the rise. Skarmouth is much too far away for his liking. But Redbeard really should be more fit - he's skinny, but not overly so. Sherlock’s neglected a firm riding regimen.
There are fundamental differences - the water horses need dripping red meat and cold blood. Sport horses and island ponies and broodmares need good hay and grains. Better hay and grains come imported from the mainland. Despite the nutritional value, Redbeard tends to turn his nose at unfamiliar feeds, and its expensive. Most of his savings went into him entering the Races at the Hawkin’s Tavern several nights ago. There is very little leftover. The stuff he earned by riding to the mill for Molly Hooper was far too meager, but it was also far too much for the job Sherlock’d been doing.
The pistol neatly fits into his hand, just the way it had the day he stole it from Lestrade. The metal rubs his palm in a very different way than the violin’s bow does - where the violin is flowing, curving wood, the pistol is all unforgiving, hard lines.
John is drawn to the photographs and papers, right where Sherlock has spread them all in what is disarray but he’ll call a method if John should ask. For a moment, Sherlock watches John sift through the reports, observing the always-present bags under his eyes and the way he has not shaved in approximately three and a half days, and the auburn color of his facial hair. John scratches at it now, the rasp of short nails over stubble, scrutinizing a photo.
“Like I said, not trying to get you drunk. It’s alright if you don’t finish it all. Especially if you don’t usually drink.” At Sherlock’s surprised expression, John laughs, “Oh, please. You make the biggest faces when you’re sipping that pint.”
Moriarty fires his shotgun into the dark, but the scream does not falter. It rises in pitch - it cannot get any louder. Moriarty fires again. It’s out there.
Sherlocks nods. He spins a wayward piece of hay between his fingers, plucked from the bale he sits on, looking dejectedly down at his feet. Grains of sand are stuck in the seams of his shoes.
“Nicer than the attics I’m accustomed to.” John sheathes his dagger.
hisses again, clucking high near the end. Sherlock can feel it all vibrate against his calves where they nudge the barrel of Gladstone’s creaking ribs.
“Her name is Mrs Hudson, don’t expect anything from her, she’s very difficult when I come home late.” He pops the door handle definitively, and is assaulted with cold wind when he steps out of the car. Instantly, all the heat that had formed with two living breathing bodies in the car is swept away. The papers ruffle as he retrieves them, pulling John’s jacket tight over his hunched shoulders.
When they reach the end, where the bloody blade is stabbed through the woman’s chest, John shakes his head.
FINALLY another chapter, this took awhile because, while writing, I decided to restructure, exactly, where every plot point was going to go, and thus added an extra chapter, the whole thing coming to 25 chapters, instead of 23

“In a way,” Sherlock shrugs.
from underneath the stable roof.
but he could do damage. The thought makes Sherlock smirk as he shoves into the tavern door and past the people spilling out onto the walk.
Even for Sherlock’s long legs, the mount is difficult, and Gladstone does not make it easy. He twists like a snake, hissing to John, his ears flaying back at the unexpected weight upon his back. Sherlock sits up, hair worse for wear, and pushes it back over his forehead, trying to keep a semblance of indifference. The swept curls flop lifelessly back down.
Memories can be corrupted.

Sherlock leaves his hold on John’s face. He’s warm and safe while encompassed by Sherlock’s hands, untouched by the danger of the Races. Dejected, Sherlock exhales, “Is there
John Watson came from the mainland, many years ago. Sherlock can read it in his watch. Watson believes in Thisby’s charms, but not in using them on his giant black stallion. His hand shakes sometimes, but not others, and Sherlock theorizes it’s the adrenaline kicking through Watson’s system that steadies his hand. Now it is still. He’s survived five years of racing. Maybe more. How will this year be for him? How will Sherlock’s first?
John crosses his arms while they wait for Molly to reappear, and watches Sherlock eye the November cakes arranged behind glass. “How’d you know about Lestrade?”
“Yes. I figured that you had…
“Someone must have aconitine — powder, plants, enough evidence to convict if there is a motive found. Somewhere on this island, like the whalers. There should be a connection between the Stockyard and the docks somewhere. How often do you meet with any fishermen?”
Sherlock fights it, but his mouth twists happily, nonetheless. John laughs, and Sherlock loves it, he knows he’s the reason for it, so he covers his face with one hand, purposefully hiding the exhilarated grin.
If Sherlock was in danger, John would not be idle.
decades, John.”
Sherlock walks through the crowds of tourists in town. He stands over the cliffs for a while, looking down at the day's early commotion. The leaning conifer by his side, he forces down the November cake, watching the people and horses below. The wind steals their voices, and makes it all seem less real. It's all shifting ground, like quicksand, no one on the beach stays still.
John’s voice has changed. It’s deeper, shocked. “I recognize the symbols. Can’t get a good look from here, I can’t see it all at once.”
“My favorite part, you’re not
“He stood here,” John says. His hand fists in Gladstone’s mane, and he steps out of Sherlock’s space.
“There are some wealthy people.”
John laughs again, lower and without a tinge of malice. “They're only animals. They're not monsters.”
Sherlock sits back on his heels, watching John, and the scene around.
Moriarty continues, low snake-voice, “What's the matter? What has gotten into your funny little brain?”
Underneath Gladstone is a sodden figure, slumped in the water. Near the cliffs, someone is covering another dead rider with a sheet
John is quiet, too, and the car rumbles underneath them, heating system just beginning to give the car some substance other than icicles.
mouth may be from the iron bit they have shoved between his scorching teeth.
Sherlock knows for a fact he put the small blond figurine in the middle of the cobblestone yard last night. And yet, it’s missing. Sherlock looks at the drawbridge. It’s half lowered, tiny chain draping from the sides to the cutout in the castle wall.
Surprised by the warmth of his skin, Sherlock’s response dies on his tongue.
Quick as a cobra, he shoves Sherlock back some steps, closer to the edge.
Beneath the cover of the duvet, because Sherlock is feeling brave, and because nothing is real in the nighttime, Sherlock tentatively settles his hands over John's. He can't hold them in this position, not really, but being able to cover both completely with his own palms is satisfying, because every part of John is warmer than every part of Sherlock. John's skin is sunlight embodied. The man is sighing against the shell of Sherlock’s ear.
He barely adds to the conversation. “A shame there is no exportation.”
“You know it’s him, he’s toying with you because there’s no hard evidence. The stories, the seeds, the letter,” John gestures to Sherlock’s coat, “it’s a trick, Sherlock. His focus is
Sherlock feels small, a figure against the blackness of the island shadow. Walking through the lit streets of Skarmouth won’t be difficult, even with the drunks and unskilled tourists, but once he is in the outskirts, the despairing vulnerability of being alone may kick into his already-frayed system. And, John has Gladstone, who shouldn’t be allowed to walk through Skarmouth’s roads, lest he lash out.
one, just over there! Sherlock is an
Each morning, at sunrise, Sherlock sees a single man. Short, choppy light hair that reflects the sun, clothed in dark colors. The man limps from fence to fence, as if he's the only worker awake, turning in or out the sport horses and island ponies; yearlings or stallions or broodmares. Past sunrise, when Sherlock rides back from the mill and heads towards Skarmouth once more, slow with a full grain cart, he sees the man again, watching other stable boys or skirting through pasture. There are a few more men working in the stables or grooming the horses, waiting for mainland buyers to arrive for appointments to judge the newly born island ponies.
“It belonged to my grandmother. There’s rooms inside, for the figurines,” The sniveling teenager had said, looking at the castle on the tabletop, “I don’t really have much use for it.”
nearby do not look at the old mare for very long. Their ears are all back as hers are pricked lazily forward.
Sherlock doesn't take Redbeard out to the the spot outside of Skarmouth today, with the tract of beach will be used for the Races. It’s not at all because of Anderson’s sea wish, or the threat of meeting any of the tourists or riders on that side of the island. It’s more logical to train where no one will interrupt them. He pulls Redbeard northwards, past Skarmouth and towards the mill and the Stockyard. The winds mainly come from the south, so it will be an easy practice, if unrealistic of how the Races will be.
Oh, yesterday. He flips through the last few weeks.
John tugs his arm free as they begin towards the buildings of Skarmouth, where they’d come from, where Gladstone is being kept amongst the outskirts.
. Clearly, John is in charge over there. And everywhere, down on the beach, in town, at the festival...
He would rather die.
Someone discovers Sherlock’s riding an island pony.
of the sea down far below. Somewhere under them there could be the tunnels of the caves, filled with paintings, bones, and water horses.
The thrusts turn shallow again, and now when the third finger prods at him, Sherlock tries desperately to relax, drawing a leg up to offer John more room. It’s a stretch that should burn, logically, should hurt, but John works so slowly, in such short circular pushes, that it is only a minute before they’re sunk to the knuckle inside of Sherlock’s body.
He would never dare to do this if there was any chance of danger, but… Sherlock ducks beneath Gladstone’s powerful neck, held high and tight, to scan the entirety of the scene.
,’ Moriarty had said. Tonight, tomorrow, and the end of the world. Time, time, it’s fluttering away. Here John stands before him in the cold, and the only point of contact between them are their hands. Fascinating, unfailing, unchanging John Watson. Suddenly, urgency is coloring every thought that flits through Sherlock’s head.
“Ever since I saw you on the beach,” John says quietly, and Sherlock warms at his voice, the sound rumbly-low and pleasing. John draws a finger down the line of smaller buttons on Sherlock’s undershirt, capable hands rising to touch Sherlock’s throat. Sherlock hears his every breath. “Ever since Mary, I haven’t gotten you out of my head.”
Sherlock tries to remember. “I saw you talking, nothing more,” he lies.
The grey-eyed man’s bushy eyebrows rise and draw deep crinkles into his forehead. Then, he laughs, big guffaws that shake his shoulders and shift his clothes. “John Watson,” the man says, reaching forward to pat a hard pat on John’s jacket. His laughs subside, “Then I will have to bring any carnivorous fillies back for you and Mister Moriarty.”
The short man - the black stallion’s rider - has the mare’s face pressed up against his chest, and Sherlock panics, expecting blood and carnage and organs to spill from beneath the man's ribs and out to the shifting ground. It's for naught, the rider hasn't been ripped open. The water horse's long neck is stooped low at an odd angle to do so, and her back hooves continually pound the sand, but her forelegs only quiver. She is huffing and puffing, her lips drawn back by the man’s stomach to show her teeth.
In the Hawkin’s Tavern, the once-empty blackboard is filling out quite nicely. There must be fifty names on it.
John looks confused.
“The tourists--
The underwater rocks hug his ankles and the clumps of seaweed kiss his shoes.
im sorry this has taken so long...... so sorry my friends BUT the next chapter was halved off of this one because of length (wouldve been suuuuper long) and it has much more action than this one... good luck reading and tell me what you think!
Brief apprehension stills him when John’s chest collapses onto his, and then the unbelievable scorch of his thick cock lines up and pushes against Sherlock’s, trapping them in the tight space between their bellies. The tension held high in Sherlock’s gut vanishes as John pushes again, groaning into Sherlock’s sweaty neck.
His fingers draw together, clenching around the shirt material. Sherlock’s heart pounds fast, trying to burst into John’s hand. As if feeling it, John presses firmly. It causes Sherlock’s injured ribs to ache terribly but Sherlock can’t care at all.
“Ah, thank you.”
“Is that enough to consistently revisit a place where your father was killed? To relive it, each time you step off the ferry?””
“Didn’t leave one.”
“What’s the look for?” Watson asks.
The wind blows over them all, bringing the scent of ale and ocean water.
Why definitely?”
“I think I see steam, right there, pouring off your shoulder.” John fights a smile.
Sherlock looks at John. He’s flushed with the bite of the wind, his thin lips are chapped, and he’s got that line between and above his eyebrows that means he’s concentrating,
Gently, his thumb sweeps over a bump, an item in his pocket. Without removing it, he knows it is the spiraling shell from the mare goddess. What wish was there to make? He’s wished to win before, but that isn’t what he promised this year. He'd lied to Sherlock about already making his wish. He had no clue in his head as to what he wanted.
Surely, there is something wrong with his hearing, his ears, something is wrong with him, because those words did not come from John’s mouth. The rain falls.
The paper is the same, too, off-white, thick, and luxurious. Almost smooth to the touch, refined. Over the lamp, he can see the shadow of folded pages inside, feel them through the envelope. There’s something in here.
“Holmes! Where’re you going?”
Sherlock wrote back;
“Check the cabinets,” He says, studying the blackness further in the room, “below the desks. I’ll check the back.” The shadows behind the slots are very dark, and with no windows, Sherlock is going to have to take great, painstaking care to find the right files. If they’re even back there. More dusty crates are sat on top of Anderson’s work bench, mountains of unsorted mail. Maybe…
on the racing beach, while they were underwater, and say ‘
“Would any of the Yard be willing to talk?”
“No, no. You are right. The etching isn’t religious at all - it’s magic.”
The bone-chilling faces of the horses swing down and up, side to side, predatory eyes focused forward, darting to Sherlock’s neck, as if assessing weak points. Sherlock tucks his chin, and Hope reins in Hydria, drawing the horse’s long mouth and wet teeth back as the bit moves up, up, up. The rein plays tricks with Sherlock's grip on the reins and slicks his hair against his forehead.
clever.” Sherlock is a few seconds away from spouting off every deduction he can list about John’s flat. That would show John.
And he’s just done a roundabout to thinking about John again.
John rolls over onto his side, the length of his body pressing up against Sherlock, and he touches Sherlock’s chin, running over the constellation of moles on Sherlock’s neck. “Means you feel good.”
“Let’s get down to business,” Moriarty says.
“I’ll drop them off at Mrs Hudson’s for you tomorrow, Sherlock. And please,” he sighed heavily, pushing aside the bands of his jacket to settle his hands upon his hips, “don’t let me in if you’re not dressed. Donovan keeps giving me shit.”
“Congratulations, Mr Holmes. It was thrilling - really, it was. Different than any other year, you were truly unique--”
John’s smirk, no longer painted but real, returns. “Then what are you?”
His mum did always say that being polite was the key to everything and anything a person could want. Mycroft liked to scoff at that.
Sherlock turns, swallowing worry for the man on the sand. If he looks at John, he knows he’ll shatter the illusion of stillness. Trusting his own mind to keep the water horses where they are, he observes the mare.
“What battles would there be for you to wage while so small and
“John, I’d like you to bring that horse back. He could use a cleaning. Especially around the...” Moriarty squints, and wets his bottom lip, “mouth. That filly Elementary needs her exercise as well. Tell someone to do it before you’re off.” Now he turns to regard Sherlock.
It’s world-shaking, mind-twisting, incessant
“Stop!
Dry ground. Oh, how beautiful it is.
Redbeard rocks and shifts under him as Watson rides near on his lightning fast water horse, sitting up straighter in the saddle and finally slowing the horse.
“Sherlock, Sherlock, Mr Holmes,” Says a plucky voice from behind the bakery counter.
“If it was him,” John parrots at him. “Anyone can steal a seal.”
“I know you don’t care about the money.”
hunting glare.
The image on the doors is of the mare goddess in true form, Epona, god of horses, represented as a giant mare against a scene of blue sea and high cliffs. The light from inside the church shines through the colored glass, making the glass glow. The wind blows up the scent of ocean water and ancient wood.
No one’s asked him, not really, because no one on the island cares enough to ask. But that’s not what John means. John means,
And the next. Another.
“Sherlock!”
Sherlock resists the ingrained urge to need to look at someone when they speak. It’s refreshing to be unbound by social convention. “No, they won’t get anywhere with museums.”
There's a flash of red in Watson’s hand, before he shoves his hand back up to the horse’s muzzle.
The solution lights up in front of Sherlock’s eyes like neon.
It’s hypnotic, and it's no wonder Sherlock doesn’t see the
Tightly, John squeezes. It’s not a shake, but a squeeze. His thumb brushes over the back of Sherlock’s hand, infinitely warm against the biting salt breeze. A tug, and John has hauled Sherlock close, tilting his face up to Sherlock’s hair, his breath ghosting Sherlock’s ear. As soon as Sherlock has relaxed into it, this one-sided parody of an embrace, it’s gone and away, lifted from him.
“Ooh, the
John keeps watching, even while Gladstone’s wicked teeth begin to clack over the wood by the little window as he lifts his face up to it.
His heart warms, even in the frigid office space. With hardly any prompting, John is in here, performing illegal searches with him, fully knowing who he was and what they were doing and why. His loyalty is unmatched. A faint smile befalls his face, before he slips behind the compartment windows for mail, and starts opening boxes along the walls.
At one point, the bowler hat yells at a young man, maybe eighteen, “Is that
Sherlock’s curls brush his pillow, lashes flicking as his eyes dart to commit John to memory.
Sherlock looks down at his hand, where John touched him last, and clenches it until his knuckles turn white.
“Like what?”
Sherlock is being lectured about politeness from a drone of Mycroft’s? A drone of Mycroft’s with blood and sass?
“You had a sister.”
Gripping his ribs tightly, Sherlock leans into the brick wall. The rest of his body heat leeches away into the stone through his coat.
“That
Bicycles cover every wall Sherlock can see, the car's windshields on the side of the road gleam under the streetlights, and there are many people out. There would be: tonight’s the first night the blackboard will be out in the tavern, hanging above the bar like a sword above a throat, tonight's the first night people will sign up for the Races.
He draws her into a brief embrace. Her thin arms come up to encircle him, and then he pulls away. “At the end,” He repeats. She nods, looking teary-eyed but not frail, clinging to his coat in her hands. Sherlock turns back to his companion for assistance. “John?”
“Then walk.”
Then it’s a smooth, if not tense ride to Tholla, on the south side of Thisby, with the pony cart rattling on the dirt and grass road. Sherlock is reminded of the last time they were down this way, the mangled sheep’s corpse spread all across the path, but the incident is not repeated. He exchanges the last few coins for three large bags of oats and a multitude of bales of hay. Expensive. More expensive than oranges. He leaves the hay in Tholla with his name on it, and carts the grain bags back to Mrs Hudson’s, feeling guilty he’s gotten nothing for Josephine.
“Yes, obviously. How much did you hear?”
Sherlock scoffs, turning his head away for a last check in the mirror. “You’re kept in attics and cases, how would you know?”
The reaction, Sherlock can see from way back, is immediate. Gladstone twists, clearly not used to being assaulted with the wind during his training, loses his footing, stumbles, but doesn’t fall. It gives Redbeard precious time to sprint forward, spraying Sherlock’s sleeves and face with bits and flecks of mud and spit that's flying back from Redbeard's open mouth. They’re only ten lengths behind, with Gladstone gaining more ground.
Sherlock quirks his mouth. “Auction today,” He states.
The Cliffs.
“Shadwell was drinking tea when he came in - look at the house, she had severe OCD and would never have left that out half-finished - while he was inside her house. It wasn’t because she didn’t hear him come in, she was relaxed enough to enjoy a cup of tea because she
to lean in enough for John to cover him, for John to have his hands against his skin. It occurs to him that he has badly wanted John as close to him as they are now for weeks, ever since he had seen him on that beach with Mary. This horrible wrecking pain and pressure in his chest wasn’t anger, or envy for what John and the island have, it was a terrifying emotion, a heart-breaking
“Why do you have to contradict-- oh?”
When he walks into the main stables, Bill Murray seems to have been waiting for him. The shop owner watches him for a second, and then goes back to stirring around whatever dark meats are in the pail by his shoes with a ladle.
He's in love with John Watson.
But he can't move.
when you’re trying to buy breakfast from them.”
Like the mare goddess, John has a way with the sea. Sherlock tries, but there is no way John was in the costume on the night of the Scorpio Festival. Not the right body, height, anything. Sherlock thinks of the shell he had seen John slip into that jacket pocket. Why does it bother him so much, that thought always chasing him around? John had already made his wish. Damn it. What had it been for? For Gladstone? To win the Races again?
After Hope, during their heavy conversation on the wind-swept shore, Sherlock had never been allowed a chance to glance to man behind the spider’s mask. This is an incredible opportunity, and he feels his breath pick up at the prospect of making a real deduction.
Rightly taking it as an invitation, John’s hips stutter back and pitch forward again. Sherlock lets out a small
His lips wrinkle back. They reveal a flat of familiar teeth that fit perfectly into the patterned grooves on John’s shoulder.
Mrs Hudson locks her teary eyes with his. “You can't promise me that.”

is not flailing, it's still. Still, but its eyes are wavering, looking around wildly, like the rest of its body is paralyzed, and it is trapped. Its ears are pinned back, and its whole body is drenched in the saltwater and shivering with power. John Watson is still, as well, but his exposed arms, dark jacket sleeves shoved past his elbows, are shaking as he pushes against the
He might’ve been able to tell earlier, if he weren’t the subject of John’s attention. If John wanted to sleep with someone
Tipping his head, Sherlock rests his temple against John’s shoulder, feeling the worn material of the coat under his cheek, and letting his wind-blown hair tickle John’s neck. He’s taller, but even the cramp in his neck is worth nothing in this moment. His bones are weary, sore and content, even the cold has no effect on him, despite its bite on the exposed skin of his face.
He cracks open his eyes, just a little, to look around the sitting room. The shadows are in the right places for the moon to still be up and bright outside. Sherlock theoretically has plenty of time to enjoy this position, all the intimate comfort it brings.
Sherlock looks away, because he thinks he can see something gurgle in her belly. Pale eyes sit high on a long head.
The mare has no more rider, but there is a saddle draped in bells over her back, streaks of brown-red on her pale coat and a halter covered in iron chainmail over her hallowed face -- John wretches his leg from where it’s been crushed by the heavy muscles in the mare’s neck and Gladstone’s side, face of panic, while she screams and snaps at Gladstone -- Gladstone is swinging and screeching and baying right back, clacking his teeth as she rears, a foreleg striking out, long ears pinned against her skull, John is instantly on the sand, and--
“I was afraid you’d be done with me, after your
It isn’t the blood, or the knowledge of the sword, but
What on earth is he looking for? What is following Hope going to do? There isn't really a formal parade going on. He sets his jaw in irritation when a man going the opposite way as him bumps against his shoulder. Maybe Sherlock should be following him.
“It's time to make another wish.”
Sherlock hums, pretending to agree so that he can leave more quickly with what he wants. Hm. Maybe leaving isn’t the best course of action. What if the envelope is in the box, and when he opens it, it has a letter of confession from Moriarty about the murder? He should be as close to the station as possible if that’s the case, so the arrest can happen more smoothly.
Lestrade’s brows raise, creating wrinkles in his forehead. His mess of spiked grey hair raises in dawning realization.
“Ho, Doctor, what a pleasure to see you on this fine morning! Have a look at her, see…”
are clever. Corpses don't often wash up on the beaches, the only places bones are found is in the sea caves carved by the ocean years and years ago. No theories would've been born.
himself.” At this, a few of the locals in the crowd eye John, as if this were a realistic probability. After all, if the
of the sea far below would ever tell him otherwise.
Then John smiles.
Like he’s made a decision, John nods. There's a determined line between his brow when he fixes Sherlock with a look of approval. His jaw does something complicated, a muscle jumping at the curve. “I’ll go on with you.”
And even if I did swat at one,
Sherlock comes to stand beside him. Moriarty is gazing down at his own hands, pulling at his gloves. They resemble Sherlock’s, although they are not the same, and now Moriarty reaches into his pocket. Sherlock then turns out towards the ocean, watching the waves fall and retreat. “You know what I want.”
John is absolutely correct and fantastic, and Sherlock had been thinking the same thing. Although it’s not a good time for warm feelings to rush through his belly, they do. It must be the proximity, and the alcohol in his blood, thinning and twisting it.
She smiled. Her eyes were still red when she looked down at the box and pulled her hand, nails chipping blue, away. She sniffed, and in her rough, nasally voice, went on, “I think it’s just the way he likes to meet people.”
Sherlock first thought of the Races when he was ten. It had never been a possibility before then, and it never would, afterwards.
He bends, digging through the annotated Bibles under his podium. Sherlock leans over, watching him pull out a leather-bound notebook that clearly doesn’t belong to the church. “I know thieving is a sin.” Mike glances over his shoulder nervously. “I know, but. I stole this, because I had overheard the gamblers in the tavern and the butcher’s shop talking about bets.”
It snaps into action -
Girls in bells run by while Sherlock parks the Ford. No use in risking Redbeard here - gamblers will do anything to even slightly raise their odds. The car needs to stop and start as people run in between the vehicles in the street, feet hitting the ground in tune with the music. This is nothing like the festival, but it is still very overwhelming, and so when he parks the Ford our back of Hawkins Tavern, Sherlock takes a moment to himself to pray that it will turn back on when he wants to leave.
Sherlock wonders if this was John’s plan all along, even from the bar. He can say as much as he wants to that he didn’t plan on getting Sherlock drunk, but maybe he did plan on it, and also planned on claiming he was just being neighborly, helping Sherlock get home.
(as per the original novel, WHICH YOU SHOULD READ, if only to find fun similarities and differences, the racers don't wear helmets in the actual Races - but if you ride a horse, please dont crack yr egg)
Sherlock's knees bounce up and down, both of them, like a child kicking out his legs. He's getting antsy and frustrated. Like always, it comes with squirming. “John, you're being cryptic. You are saying anything that means something, you're just saying words.”
He shoves paper notes at the cabbie, who mutters something about nutjobs under his breath. The cloying smell of blooming tulips hits him first as he shuts the door and the cab pulls away, retreating the way they'd come. The ground here outside the gate, rolling with planted flowers and turned-over mulch, is a garden, and has been freshly tended to by practiced gardeners. The flowers are overpowering. He doesn't want to think about Mrs Hudson's floral perfumes anymore, and if he sees a bouquet in the next week he's going to gag.
Redbeard flinches violently and startles, his ears swiveling wildly.
He kicks Redbeard’s side, and the horse’s stride lengthens, until he is devouring great lengths of the island, and Sherlock must squint against the frigid air.
By the time Sherlock tackles the butcher’s son and they go sliding into the wall of a Tholla alley, crashing into rubbish skips and spooking loose chickens as they go, it’s evening, and Sherlock has friction burns on both of his forearms. They burn and sting and swell up as Lestrade shoves the son into Sally’s cruiser and Sherlock into the back of his, saying something about ‘getting you home, so Mrs H can have a look at you.’

John slumps into the armchair across from Sherlock's. After a moment, he gets up, circles around to the back of it, and shoves it closer to Sherlock's.
weaves by them, intent on catching up to a frantic brawl.
“So you’re just going to leave a body behind the tavern, hoping no one will notice, until your
Gladstone is standing stiffly, and has a glazed look in his eye and a tilt of his head and ears that means focus on a horse. When he’s not looking at Sherlock, he seems mild, but Sherlock is not fooled and Sherlock cannot trust him. Gladstone is looking into the rain and into the distance but has not forgotten about Sherlock, not for one second.
Although more sure of himself now that John has convinced him of Mrs Hudson’s affection for him, that she won’t turn him out, the threat of working in the mill, a boring, repetitive job that requires no thinking, is a threat worse than that of death.
John’s stomach turns with frustration. With a wide stance, arms down at his sides, he answers through gritted teeth, “The white half-blood.”
Magnussen sits atop a blonde, still
The black stallion with the white mane and tail, the positively
Surely meant to embarrass him, Sherlock flits his gaze to meet Moriarty's. The rain comes down harder, in larger spurts. Moriarty’s hair is black and limp now, his eyes grey and sunken into his face, large dark bags beneath them in the storm.
The notary’s stubbled cheeks twitch. The messily smeared ink over his collar and neck says Donovan’s in the other room, and Sherlock had burst in at a very inconvenient time. He doesn’t care.
“Never so, Mrs Hudson. I was a fool to do it the once.”
He needs money to pay Anderson to track down Mycroft. He needs money to charter the ferry that will take him to the mainland, because he could do the first to-do item, finding Mycroft, by himself, but he needs a place to start.
Lestrade grins, “You know, that look isn’t half as intimidating when you’ve only just gotten up.”
hisses, rumbling deep in his chest as the leather grazes his damaged ear.
John’s hands are stained with red like Gladstone’s grey mouth, and it takes a ragged heartbeat before it registers that it is Hope’s blood and not John’s. Shoulders sagging, John tentatively brushes Gladstone’s forelock away from his fish eyes. Sherlock imagines the champion striking out to sever his wrist from his arm, but the beast does no such thing, his front-facing ears warring forwards, pricked to catch each sound from its focal point.
Snaps and sputters, snorts and clucks as the writhing mass of
Why does the house have to be so far back from the gate? A high whinny sluices through the dark, soothing over Sherlock’s ears. Redbeard is awake, too, and must’ve heard the Ford pull up down below.
The mare’s neck flashes down, a blur of sharp white and yellow, and something shoves Sherlock from the boulder.
“Sherlock Holmes,” John’s shoulders shake, unable to stop himself. “Sherlock, I love you. I - I thought I had the unbreakable habit of loving things that couldn’t love me back, but - but.”
poisoned him, stole the letter before it was filed into evidence,” only god knows how, “and replaced it when your man stole the files and the photographs. You didn’t want it opened by an officer, you wanted it in my hands. And once you were sure I had it, you had Henry Knight give me the invitation to tonight’s appointment.”
“I won’t miss it, young man.” She settles a teacup in a matching saucer in front of him. By looking at the ornate blue flower petals, Sherlock notes exactly which brush she used to achieve its desired effect, tiny forget-me-nots. The scent of the tea wafts around the kitchen, tucking into all the places Sherlock is tired and missing John. “And it
With a care that makes Sherlock bite the inside of his cheek, John ties the band of matching scarlet colours around Sherlock’s upper arm after Sherlock shrugs off his coat. John knots the fabric, but keeps his hand present. It bunches the thin material of his shirt, clashing with the dark blue.
The familiar bulk of the stables grows in the shadow. There is no fog tonight, too much wind, and not enough moonlight behind the fast-moving clouds. Gladstone’s head twitches this way and that, ears swiveling to catch sounds that neither John nor Sherlock can hear in the distant black. Sherlock wonders what other monsters could be out here with them in the night.
was bad,” he says. “It showed me what a madman you are. I had my suspicions before,” John pushes Sherlock’s shirt down and away, allowing it to join his coat, wrapping around Sherlock’s hips and crowding close. Nerves at his exposure flit down Sherlock’s side. “But that sealed it. I was gone - you were brilliant.”
"What are you planning on, then? If not continuing with them." A beat. "Who are they, exactly?"
John smiles, and the light makes him look in love. “It’s turned out well for me. You’ve helped me to achieve Gladstone. I could leave Moriarty,” he says, “and I could turn and never go back. Has it been bad for you?” He asks, as if suddenly self-conscious about his performance in their (strictly professional) relationship.
“I’ve met a dozen of your people over my years,” John says with patience, “I don’t go rushing, trying to meet more of them.”
Nervously, Sherlock fidgets with the band of bright red along his arm. He stops himself when he realizes it’s Mrs Hudson who has made him so fussy. If his body and face is mangled by the end of this, the colors will make identification easier.
The wind picks up again, hunching against Sherlock’s figure and throwing the paper lanterns strung above for a spin. It even makes the streetlamp creak, how strong it is. Sherlock can feel the gritty air in his bones.
For the first minute of the Races, Sherlock loses sight of John, and is plagued with increasing anxiety. Although these events have already transpired, and he knows John lives, even wins these Races, he’s trying to move closer to the island.
For some reason, Moriarty's venomous visage comes to Sherlock’s mind. He shakes his head, waving a hand to shove the image away.
Moriarty takes this in.
world. I am as real as you. At first I mistook you for a giant, they’re common by here in my time, but now I see you must be another Rebecca. I didn't realize where I was a moment ago.”
A few notions of
Redbeard is a horse. He's seventeen hands.
“I want to see a full toxicology report,” Sherlock says, standing curtly. He wrinkles his nose, wishing for a bath now that he’s spent time around a dead body. “It was poison, clearly, but no external marks, no seizing… Tourist. Again with the tourists,” This last bit is murmured softly to himself. Overhead, grey clouds are rushing by, streaked with white. No storm coming, Thisby got rid of that this morning and last night. He thinks of John while he twists off a single leather glove and puts it in his pocket.
he wishes for is the full-blooded one locked away in the stables.
Images of Donovan’s and Anderson’s faces come into Sherlock’s mind, unwelcome and uninvited, and even Lestrade, at work in his office. How many of the officers there, lurking in the ranks and between the mundane shelves of paperwork, are waiting for only a word from Moriarty to shoot Lestrade in the spine? As it did this afternoon, Sherlock pictures Anderson’s charcoal-covered face in the dimness of the window behind Moriarty’s back.
There, in its nose now, Sherlock can see the red berries, the nightlock. They spill out and flood the water around him, leeching away his life as John took the
John embraces him, shoulder bumping up into Sherlock's chin. Rationally, Sherlock is aware that he should only move one arm as to not overexert his obliques and ribcage. Disregarding that entirely, Sherlock apprehensively curves his entirety to John, overcome. His nose fits into John's hair, dripping wet. Familiar, dancing scents greet him: John, the island, woodsmoke, sand, salt, a dash of his own blood. Obviously it's John; it's always and only been John.
Today, there is a high note in the wind as it hurls sand and salt and reddens Sherlock’s cheeks. It makes Sherlock’s skin itchy and raw. He spends the tired, pale orange morning up and running by the cliffs, the ones where he met Watson and has resolved to train at, then rides to Skarmouth in the afternoon to bother Molly and Archie for a bit, snacking on a light lunch of gifted November cakes before retreating back out to the empty cliffs.
Sherlock shakes and John strokes him through it, drawn-out longer by John’s cock moving inside of him. Flutters of gratifying shocks echo over his sensitive nerves, sending wracks of endless tremors down his legs.
doesn't.
What to do about John? Sherlock’s lip twitches. “Not in the police car. I’ll be right behind you.”
Surely, he would be able to see something were it coming for them. He’s unsure of where they would go, but he would see it, at the very least. The wind, lightening up now, as if in anticipation, pushes the scent of brine towards them. He licks his cracked lips, mouth parted, listening, wishing he could taste the air for a scent.
would've torn you apart by now.” Sherlock pulls on one side of the reins, pulling Redbeard’s head that way. It puts his round cheek on display, his strong profile.
Redbeard barrels straight through the race officials at the end of the line, skittering the crowd. Sherlock fights hard for power, and slowly, gently, Redbeard’s breath comes back to him. The horse shakes, his ears flicking. His knees lift and he prances in place, filled with nerves, bloody lip quivering. Sherlock wrenches the reins to one side, commanding Redbeard to turn back.
A moron would suspect the tarts. It could be true. The wind gusts down the narrow alleyway, cold and biting at Sherlock’s exposed ears. He tucks some curly hair behind one.
will rise, strutting from the ocean with seaweed as its coat.
talking about who, who he was betting his life savings on.”
Gladstone’s eye rolls back to peer at John, so close to his trembling, heavy mouth.
“Come on,” John says. “Let’s get out of the cold.”
Sherlock glances to John. John says, focused on rifling through another cabinet, “Just tonight and tomorrow.” John moves the shiny old kettle from the countertop and under the tap where he fills it, then cracks another burner grate and puts it overtop.
Now, he looks away from the envelope, to John instead. His face is as urgent as his voice. Sherlock’s chest squeezes, his lungs expand.
It’s the wrong thing to say.
“It won’t be necessary again. I only ever meet one person at a time. It’s you, now. I should seek no one else.” He drops his hand to his side, staring openly at Sherlock.
she is, again!” Then he mutters something about people of Thisby worshipping this Watson, and is back to his luring lines.
Sherlock peers over at John’s voice, but does not turn his head. He believes Gladstone might take the opportunity to tear out his throat, like Hope. Gladstone looks just as proud as he always had, except now there is knowledge of his kill. In his past there may have been more. Sherlock sniffs. “No.”
“I can do it myself,” Sherlock says.
That’s when the wind throws the scent of the sea against the island.
Sherlock has just said,
"How would you know? You can't feel it."
Sherlock frowns, petulant. In a minute, he jerks his shirt back down and mutters, "Fine."
alone like this. Only John. Gladstone tilts his head to the sound of John’s voice, his lips twitching. Sherlock understands. It’s captivating.
like that.”
Ahead, a pair of battling horses recoil from the bulk of eels and charge across Sherlock’s path into the shallows of the water, hot wicked teeth clacking at each other, misting Sherlock with ocean water. The new horse barrels into the two of them, the water slashing at its legs. Its rider tries to wrench the horse away, barely succeeding to slow his mount.
Sherlock tries to ask John what his plan is, because he clearly has one, but he doesn’t get the chance - outside, a gun fires. The screaming does not stop. John clips a braided lead onto the ring of Gladstone’s uncharmed halter, twists the rope around his hand, and pulls. Gladstone throws his head back, yanking John up and off the ground for half a second, then drops it again, moving forwards as soon as John has his footing back. Gladstone is already wet. He has not yet been outside.
Beside it in the dim shadows, there is a seashell, spiralled and neat and small, sitting meekly on the surface.
“You’re not above that, are you?” Anderson crumples the paper up again, and stalks to the edge of the cliff, his hands in fists. Sherlock watches him.
John doesn’t glance up from where he’s peering into Redbeard’s mouth, hands holding the horse’s red lips apart. Redbeard snorts, shaking his head to get free. John releases him. “He’s had a front tooth knocked loose.”
“That’s not all you want.”
Sherlock is stricken. “Waited?”
John gives him time, snagging his waistcoat from his chest of clothing.
There's a knot of fighting horses somewhere. It's a petty disagreement between two killer horses, but they're all sharp hooves and teeth.
A burst of wind rushes to meet his face as he shuts it, blurring the grass into lines outside the fence, where it hasn’t been eaten by Josey.
The comprehension hits him, and leaves Sherlock blinking again, stuck in the middle of his deductions and Moriarty’s impending threat, of John’s desire for him, of the murders and the Races and what freedom he has given up.
“Come along. I won’t crush you. If you don’t poke through my things, then you can stand on the coffee table while I get my kit.”
