She had even had her mother’s lolling, elongated American Southern accent. Or at least she did as a child. After Mycroft became her legal guardian, he immediately enrolled her in diction classes and had the drawl drilled out of her.
Janine quickly turned around and saw the table she had been sitting at, was now in fact, empty.
Those buildings probably wouldn’t be air-conditioned.
“Why would I do that?”
“Stop calling her that in public!”
Unless it was John. Then they would roll their eyes right in front of him and walk right away from his insufferable grin.
“I still have a bit of a headache,” Violet grudgingly admitted as the nurse changed the bandages on her face and hands.
“But if I don’t com-”
“Hello,” Violet Smith simpered, practically blushing.
“I don’t know,” Violet said honestly. “But she might be.”
But he couldn’t use if Sherlock couldn’t. Moderation was not in Sherlock’s vocabulary. He didn’t see warning signals or stop signs. He didn’t comprehend the word “No.”
Neither man put the clean shirts on until much later, after the August heat had burned away the afternoon and twilight descended.
“Yeah, but it teaches him to beg,” Violet adjusted her fake spectacles. “OK, lay it on me. How do I look?” She smoothed down her shirt then put her hands on her hips.
So did Mycroft Holmes.
She was also glad that the damage to her intestinal tract was minimal. Really, it should have been far worse, but the surgeons had been first-rate. She found out later that one of them had been one of John’s mates when he did his training at Bart’s. She felt profoundly grateful he had taken extra special care of her. She hadn’t fancied the idea of poo’ing in a plastic bag for the rest of her life.
He cleared his throat, “He’s still in surgery, Mary. It… it’s bad, I’m afraid,” Lestrade fumbled through the specifics, only half-comprehending the medical gobbledygook the A&E doctor had spouted off as he explained the extent of John’s injuries. Greg Lestrade was not a stupid man and had more than just an elementary understanding of medical terminology, thanks to his job and his wife. But exhaustion and shredded nerves had turned his brain into Swiss cheese. “He’s got a broken rib, a ruptured spleen, a broken hand, and, well it’s going to be a long road, but,” he leaned forward and put a comforting hand on Mary’s shoulder. “We’re all going to be traveling the same road together, yeah?”
wrong?
10:48 PM
“Shh,” Sherlock cocked his head, very much looking like a hunting dog who heard a fox nearby. Then in a low, near-whisper, instructed them all: “This way. John, you OK?”
When no one answered his question, the president cleared his throat and looked at every member of the Devil’s Foot before fixing his hard gaze on Green. “Is it the accent?” he asked sardonically. “Is that why no one is answering me?” Filip “Chibs” Telford demanded.
“When did she move to America?” Sherlock finally asked a question instead of issuing an insult.
“Don’t be frightened,” Mycroft whispered. “Fear clouds the mind, remember?”
“This is practical. I owe you a scarf since I destroyed yours on the first night we met and I hate this one. Everyone wins.”
Her lie went right over his head. Rucastle was like a stampeding rhinoceros as he stomped back to his bolts of cloth and his mannequins. “They should have named you Azure,” he called back as he searched for something, throwing bits of cloth everywhere. “Or Skye…” He held up a necklace made from keys, then tossed it down on one of his drafting tables. “Or Cyan … Ah ha!” he called out. “Eureka!”
“And whether or not you want a cup of coffee now, you will need it. It’s going to be another long night for you two,” Dupin pointed out before whirling around, his long, black leather coat fanning out behind him.
Just as Sherlock said, “Toller is the one disposing the Burned Girls bodies,” Violet Hunter burst out, “Toller’s involved with the Burned Girls.”
So instead of taking the bait, she asked dryly, “How are the worms?”
He could hear his family’s reactions. Mycroft sneering at him, telling him he wasn’t good enough
“Oh, that’s been taken care of,” Sherlock waved that concern away.
“And their assailant?”
Yes, I know the "real" British PM is David Cameron but in the ACD canon stories, the PM was Lord Bellinger. :^)
“Nicer than Germany was for you, I suspect.”
“I’m… not staying with him anymore.”
He had polished off that beer and was going for a second when Sherlock burst into their studio flat, bright-eyed and energized. “Hi!” he beamed at Victor, kicking the door shut behind him as he juggled his violin case and an armful of books he had just checked out of the
He ended up having to take the Tube back, covered head to toe in grey slime and God-only-knew what other filth from the sewers he and Sherlock had slogged through. There was sludge in crevices and orifices of his body he hadn’t even known could get dirty. When he finally made it home, leaving muddy footprints through the house, he had plodded straight for the bathroom. He showered for over an hour and a half, covering the bottom of their tub with greyish-silt.
“How are you going to get a proper job without doing your exams?” John gently prodded her. When Susan folded her lips tight and started blinking her eyes rapidly, he told her, “Susie, we’re not going to throw you out. You can stay for as long as you need.”
The firmament lit up, silver and purplish as lightning crisscrossed the skies. Then the thunder rolled again and again.
Violet now stood in front him, shoving the mobile in front of his face, “It’s John, they have him. We have to go find him, now.” Her voice shook violently, “We can’t,
“Yeah, your division and all the divisions, we don’t need a panic like we did on New Year’s. All of the Met’s in charge of crowd control.” With that, he turned his back on Lestrade and Sherlock and started barking orders.
5:59 AM, Paris time
John grimaced, remembering Janine posing like a tart in nothing but Sherlock’s shirt.
Gladstone leapt into bed next to him and snuggled close, his snout resting on Sherlock’s chest. Idly, Sherlock stroked the dog’s massive head as he stared at the ceiling, thinking.
“Keep it,” Sherlock didn’t even have to look to see how Lisbeth craved the computer.
Violet sneaked another glance at Molly and her profiler’s eyes told her that Molly also felt guilty as hell right now. When she decided to cut Sherlock out of their son’s life, she never considered that she would be cutting this kind woman out of the boy’s life as well.
A lump formed in John’s throat as he opened the paperback to the chapter titled ‘The Tell-tale Heart.’ He’d had dinner at Gary’s house on Saturday, chatted with him a bit Monday morning as they’d walked to school… and Monday night he was dead.
“Get me a refill,” Donovan held up her glass. “Your shout since you were late.”
“I’ll try,” she finally muttered. “I’ll try, OK? This… what you and John did… it’s…” Against her will, tears spilled over. “It’s going to take time for me to forget… how betrayed I felt.”
“Mary, I’m supposed to move around,” John suppressed a sigh. Ever since he had been released from hospital, she was trying so bloody hard, acting like everything was like it was before. She was the loving devoted wife, a nurse who liked to bake and knit. Not a killer. Not the person who gunned down his best friend…
I think it's safe to say this is the chapter everyone has been waiting for... :^)
Sherlock felt himself relax. They were on the same page. She was just as afraid as he was.
In an act of pure desperation, he had even forced himself to make an appointment with one of the university’s counselors. But he had a flashback about his therapy sessions with Dr. Scott and backed out of his appointment at the last possible second.
“Who’s doing forensics?” John asked, just as quietly as Sherlock jumped down.
But Violet wasn’t looking down. She was staring, open-mouthed, at the walls. All the walls.
She couldn’t, so Anderson did. He planted evidence at the Watsons’ after a home invasion to send the Met down the wrong road. When Sherlock stubbornly stayed on the right road, Anderson set him up, told him he had a lead regarding a series of bombing Sherlock had originally been investigating. Anderson made sure Moriarty’s people captured him, drugged him and then eventually kill him.
“Don’t be silly, sit, please!” Molly said, the glow of the newly married still in her eyes. “But I thought you worked the night shifts? Are you working days now?”
,” Violet ordered her dog and the healing Alsatian was more than content to remain on his rug.
So when he roughly shoved her into an abandoned cell and started to tell her all the filthy things he was going to do to her before he murdered her, Irene began her manipulations, acting hysterical while dropping to her knees, putting herself in the position she wanted to be in instead of the other way around. She started talking, started crying so he’d focus on her face, her
you cannot continue to string
“Why aren’t they coming after us?” John fully expected to see roadblocks on the motorway.
“Hang on,” Sherlock ordered Lisbeth. Too late, he realized neither one of them had helmets.
5:25 PM
“Jim,” Tears streamed down Molly’s face. But she couldn’t wipe her face, couldn’t run to protect her mother or son. If she moved her hands, Mary would bleed out faster. “
Edward had just smashed a cockroach with his shoe.
He parted his lips, wincing as he felt them crack and bleed anew.  He attempted to sit up then immediately collapsed as he felt fire rip through his left side, roaring from beneath his rib cage all the way up to his left shoulder. He also immediately felt the dirty floor beneath him dip and weave. His stomach clenched but there was nothing to bring up.
The door widened. A thin, dishwater-blonde woman stood in front of Mary. She wore a tattered pink dressing gown, dingy white slippers and utterly unflattering grey knee-socks. The delicate skin around her sea-foam green eyes was swollen with lavender smudges underneath.  She didn’t have an ounce of superfluous fat on her body. However she had drooping cheeks and saggy breasts and buttocks which made her look older than what she probably was, judging by her smooth throat and hands. More than likely, she had once been stout but now she looked like she could do with a feeding up.
Sherlock hated seeing his best friend, his first
“It’s for Mary, the poem,” John lied instinctively. “And besides, I’m not going to give you one tiny second of my time if you’re just going to rant and rave like a lunatic!”
She had left the skirt (and gun-in-thigh-holster) on but had changed into a tank-top. Instead of her usual handbag, she carried her old rucksack, one of the two bags she had been able to save from her flat on Hartwill before it exploded.
Anthea had then chivved Sherlock and John towards the lift and then escorted them down a bland, beige hallway and into a bland, beige conference room that reminded John of the old television program
It wasn’t his office, not really. He just liked letting people believe it was.
A Parisian police officer approached them just then, giving some sort of orders in French. Anthea, putting her hand on John’s shoulder, politely told the cop, “He needs a moment.” The cop made the mistake of trying to argue with her. She snapped back at him, “He
Violet never forgotten how destroyed her grandmother had looked. She remembered switching off the old television set, a relic from the Sixties, and going to her. Violet never forgot how her grandmother had put her soft, varicose-veined hand on Violet’s thin shoulder then squeezed hard. Violet’s knees had nearly buckled.
10:27 AM
The blonde boy chuckled. “I said, what’s your name?”
“Except now, they know it was you.” He ran his hand over his bald head again, feeling the stubble in patches where hair still tried to grow. He made a mental note that he needed to shave his head again. “Go, crash in the backroom. You probably haven’t slept in the past two days. Consider that room home until we get shit figured out, OK?”
Chapter Eleven: The Tall One and The Short One
If only he had found his way back to Molly a bit sooner… none of this would be happening now.
Alice shrugged. “It was 1994, things were different. Back then nobody questioned why an eighteen year old girl was flying to New York alone. And that was the most important thing, I was eighteen years old. Legally, my father couldn’t command me back to England, unless he wanted to press charges for credit card fraud, which I knew he wouldn’t do. If he did, he would have to explain why I left in the first place. I stayed at first at a hotel near the airport, killing time until I knew he was back in England,” her eyes clouded over. “Then I called him.”
He tasted Close-Up toothpaste, coffee and the good bourbon Dupin made John drink earlier. He finally managed to unzip John’s ugly old parka, finally able to eliminate one barrier. Then as he kissed John’s face and neck, he tasted melted snow and salt water, and was vaguely aware he stood on some sort of precipice, on the edge of another fall.
Maggie nodded, “That bit didn’t make it into the news. She was pushed.”
“What’s the catch?” Sherlock demanded.
“Sherlock, I’m sorry, I should have texted or rang last night when Marie told u-”
has decided to befriend our little Stormcrow, yes?”
Violet collected her mug and the surviving wine glass and padded from the lounge to the very cluttered by very homey kitchen. Guided by the dim lights streaming from the streetlamps from outside, Violet made her way to the sink. She had just put the mug and wine glass in the sink when a deep baritone queried from behind her: “Have a nice chat with my mother?”
, Violet thought, staring at the trees, defrocked of their green finery during the winter.
As she worked on a particularly uncooperative knot, she heard him quietly say, “It matters”.  She stopped brushing her hair, holding the brush to her scalp but not dragging it through her hair.
John nearly tripped over his brown lace-ups, so shocked was he by Sherlock’s statement.
Happy Sunday!
Violet did an about-face and started walking in the opposite direction, towards the parking lots.
Kindly, John cut him off, “Help from a qualified psychiatrist. You’re doing a marvelous job but he needs a properly trained and licensed doctor. And you need to study.”
, he felt his stomach churn again.
“Of course it didn’t work,” the old man chortled. “It was never supposed to work.”
“What? No, it can’t be…Kate Middleton would never dare dream of such a thing!”
. If I did, I’d be the biggest hypocrite on the planet, wouldn’t I, me being married and all.” John lifted his eyes, looking older and puffier than usual. “You two are both marvelous liars. Make something up. Don’t let me know, don’t let me find out.”

“I thought you’d call the newly reinstated
Sherlock’s face softened. Relief lit up his eyes. He looked human again. “Oh, is that all?” he shook his head and chuckled. “Victor, that’s no great obstacle. We can get by. We’ll have to get a smaller flat, obviously. Maybe even get a flat-mate or two. Cut out a few unnecessary luxuries, more public transport, fewer cabs, stay home more instead of going out all nights of the week. I haven’t touched my savings. But I could find a job at a hospital or a laboratory, even if it’s something boring like washing test tubes. Or I could play my violin on the street corner if we need quick cash. But we’ll manage until January. Then I turn twenty-five and I’ll come into my trust fund.” Sherlock beamed at Victor, quite pleased at himself for solving the problem. He reached for the mug now and took a long drink. “Don’t let your father blackmail you into moving back to England. Go visit tomorrow and tell your father you live here now and that’s that.” He took another drink, set the mug back on the coffee table then picked his book up again. “I’ll get the paper tomorrow and start looking for less expensive flats. Or I’ll find one of those Internet cafés and see if I can find something online.”
“Fair enough. Julia has outlived her usefulness anyway, you can have her,” Moriarty strolled back to Violet. “This was quite the turn-up you know,” he caressed her cold cheek again before turning away. “We meant to take your boy, Sherlock. But Agent Hunter has a nasty habit of getting in the way.” He paused in front of Lestrade, who still pointed his Sig Sauer at him. “Do put that down, you look like a moron. You can’t kill me. If I die…” He mouthed the word “boom” and made an exploding gesture with his hands. Then he smiled serenely at Lestrade, “You and I will be meeting again though, someday.” He ambled towards the doorway. “See, your child was bought and paid for, Sherlock before he was even born. I was actually supposed to deliver him today but it may be prudent to wait a bit, let him grow up a little. I’m sure I can convince the buyer of that. Tell him to wait until the boy is… seven? Before taking possession, that is,” Moriarty let that sink in before added in his slithery, whispery voice, “Oh yes, Sherlock, I finally know what made you, who made you.”
What a perfect plan, how meticulously designed. How manically manipulative…
“There’s too much stupid in this room, clear it out at once,” Sherlock droned.
bitch.”
“Right, whatever, you’re both here now. By the skin of your bloody teeth,” John checked his watch again. “Mary’s got everything, Mrs. Hudson collected everything you needed from 221B. Go down the hall,” John pointed. “Take a right, first door after that. All the girls are there.”
“Yes, but I’ll be the one who will actually solve the case,” Sherlock sniped back. “So it’s only logical that she should send the information to me directly.”
Knowing his brother was monitoring his Internet usage was why he opened browsers in twenty different laptops. It drove the tech agents mad, tracking the various IP addresses, trying to figure out exactly what he was researching. Sometimes he pulled this trick even when he wasn’t on a case, just for a laugh at Big Brother’s expense. True, it slowed his Internet connection down, but Sherlock used the lag time to use the best computer in the world, his own mind.

But Violet felt a twitch of unease when she saw that instead of the For Sale signs in front of two of the cottages she had seen last summer, there were Foreclosure signs instead. She also saw a Going Out of Business sign taped on the big window of the butcher’s shop.
What had shocked him even more than her enjoying being with him was that he enjoyed spending time with her as wel,l and it hadn’t involved corpses or blowtorches or chemicals or crime scenes or anything
… Sherlock tried to sooth his troubled conscience after committing that little sin of omission.
She often stayed up late, working on slowly and painstakingly translating the mysterious “Valley of Fear” file. Since her knowledge of the Farsi language was woefully inadequate, the work was tedious and time-consuming. Violet preferred to work alone late at night in utter silence, with only a pot of coffee and a Farsi-to-English translation book for company. The tattered book she had purchased, at, of all places,  a Mexican
“I see,” was the only thing Mary dared to say with a gun against her head.
John’s slightly panicked voice sounded tinny though the tiny iPhone speakers. Despite that, it was clearly audible:
“Is a highly skilled profiler,” Mr. Kincaid reminded her. “Her job is to detect frauds.”
“Hmphf,” Trelawney-Hope said but he also stood up. “Well, Hilda, my wife, is home, but she won’t mind. If you have the time, we can go now.”
talking about the bloody
“How do we guarantee her silence?” Mary finally asked… in English.
“Oh shit! I’m sorry, I wasn’t thinking,” Violet reached for his face to examine the damage. “Did the cuts break back open?”
Only with his bloody nose, it sounded like “Fud too.”
“Oh, don’t be afraid, Miss Adler,” the old lion gave her a gentle smile. “We have no plans to eliminate you or disfigure you, despite what you might have been told.” He gave a stern look to Julia then turned his gaze back to Irene, his face once again kind, almost tender. “You’re a gift, you see. See, someone very dear to me is coming home and I want him to have the Very Best.”
“FINE! WHAT?”
, he thought wearily as he declined to get into the pissing match Mason attempted to instigate:
Anthea’s anxiety heightened. Ever since joining MI-6, Mycroft had never
“What the bloody hell?” John tried to turn around then winced, grabbing his side. “Shit.”
. It should have been awful, but it had turned out to be a really nice night.
“Oh, Dr. Watson, my apologies,” Dupin pressed hands together as if in prayer, despite his hat still in his hands.
No one had a clue she understood every word they said.

Chapter Twenty-Five: The Winning Ace
“I can do it,” John started towards Sherlock, towards Violet, prepared to do this duty. Prepared to take responsibility for his utter failure, he whispered, “Let me close her eyes.”
was obvious at your wedding.” Sherlock sniffed, jealousy colouring his deduction with the slightest shade of green. “You never acted on your feelings for Sholto because you refused to admit you had feelings for him that were more than platonic. You were afraid to act on them. Afraid of how Sholto would react, what your comrade-in-arms would say. You were worried that people would
“Everything,” Sherlock tucked his mobile back into his pocket. “And I do mean everything, not just his connection to the Red-Headed League, but tax evasion, bribes from lobbyists and political donors, recreational drug use (which I cannot condemn but he is a public figure, after all and had standards to maintain,) and an enthusiasm for beating underage prostitutes, which I’m sure cannot sit well with the Widow Woodhouse.”
Until John had come along… and until Victor had come slithering back…
The Red Line would have taken her directly to Chinatown and her shitty studio. She hadn’t been back to her apartment since yesterday morning.
” she snuffled, desperately needing to blow her nose, but refusing to do so in front of people.
“Please.”
.” His big, blowfish-like face was in hers now, close enough for a kiss. “When I was approached to do this little favor for the
“As I was saying, the Dark Net is not for the faint of heart. I wouldn’t even venture into it, not without a proper guide.” He held up the memory stick again, “This is the Sherpa of the Dark Net and it is still something I’m not willing to turn over to my brother.”
“Oh yes,” Violet beamed. “I must have had a touch of the flu. But I feel perfectly well now. I made Edward his breakfast, but he said he was still hungry. So I made him a sandwich as well and Sherlock’s been kind enough to entertain him this morning.”
“Right, thank you, Mrs. Payne-Ellis,” Alex stood up and looked at Hockett. “Two seconds?”
“I’ll call Monty, he owes me one,” Lestrade started swaying on his feet from exhaustion. “Anything else, Your Highness?”
The wardrobe door squeaked open just a bit and a wobbly voice asked, “You’re the lady Sherlock said I’m going to stay with for a bit?”
“It’s interesting that her wine glass is still on the end-table next to the chair,” Violet tilted her head as she studied the half-full glass of wine.
She placed her small hand into his large one and his fingers enclosed  her entire hand.
The tall girl, without missing a beat, took two running steps then leapt into the back of the van nimbly as a gazelle. But just as Noelie was about to hop in, there was a shout, “There is she, the thieving little
“Back away from me now, slowly. Keep your eyes on the ground.”
“Didn’t you take your coat when you went out?” Sherlock slowly started to wake fully up, his magnificent brain coming online. “John, you shouldn’t have. You could have caught cold.”
They caught up with Chibs and they all started walking with real haste. No one spoke as they ran down the stairs, not risking the elevator this time. Violet’s heart rate ramped up as all their footsteps echoed in the narrow stairwell. As they re-entered the immense garage where fire engines used to reside, they skirted the sadly departed Chester-the-Molestor-mobile.
Plus the idea of actually committing the deed himself was unsettling. He always had to leave the room when he told Toller to terminate the latest specimen selected for his Goddess project. He didn’t mind supervising Toller when he got rid of the bodies. In fact, he had admired Toller’s burgeoning artistic talents, until the drunken idiot had panicked and mucked everything up with that Toni Pandy girl, of course.
So he started unbuttoning his bespoke dress shirt and stripped off his vest. He sat on the edge of bed, meaning to take off his socks. Instead he stepped into his Mind Palace. He took two left turns and into the garden. Only it wasn’t his garden, it was the garden court-yard at the hotel where Greg and Molly held their wedding. He watched himself try to teach Violet how to tango. She had failed spectacularly…
The detective rolled his eyes. “John, Mary, Violet,” he droned as he started escorting Clara towards the front door of the council house. “Show our guests what they will have to contend with if they continue with their current plan of action.
“But you always have loads of girls flittering around you like butterflies.”
He was still Sherlock Holmes, after all. His mind never did really
They had touched down in Paris just as Mycroft’s people touched down in Mont-Saint-Michel.  Sherlock’s mobile had started vibrating immediately then incessantly. Sherlock merely switched it off without a word. But he had idly rubbed his bullet-hole scar while his brows knitted in consternation until it was time to take off the seatbelts and disembark.
“Gladstone,
in Edinburgh, Indiana, at Camp Atterbury, which is only ninety minutes away from Liberty, Indiana. Fact: you received a cryptic text from your source within the Department of Defense regarding your father’s death. You have never heard the words “Valley of Fear” again, until a few weeks ago, when we found documentation titled “Valley of Fear” discussing the development of hallucinogenic drugs to be used in chemical warfare, said drugs being found in an unsanctioned black-site undoubtedly funded by what is left of Moriarty’s syndicate. Ergo, there is a probability that your father was involved in Project H.O.U.N.D.”
Sherlock turned around and saw Lestrade standing there, also wearing a Kevlar vest underneath his long black winter coat. Sherlock could tell he wore his shoulder holster underneath his coat, so he knew Lestrade was armed as well. “I’m no John Watson, but whatever you need, mate. I’m here.”
Moriarty sniggered, “Oh my God! He’s simply adorable, Sherlock! I see why you took a shine to him, but he really is no John Watson, is he? But marriage really doesn’t suit our Johnny, does it? Pity about his kids because I think he really would have taken to fatherhood like a duck to water. Not like you, you would be terrible. Most Holmes men are, are they not?” The smile he gave Sherlock now was chilling. “I told you I’d burn the heart out of you. I also told you. No one ever gets to me. And no one ever will.”
Once Toller returned with Violet’s handbag, Sherlock escorted Violet from the house, his arm still around her shoulder. He kept the pretense up until they were a block away, where a black cab idled, waiting for them.
John knelt down in the gravel next to him and pulled him into his arms, not giving a damn that there were MI-6 agents everywhere, not to mention Poe probably watching from the driver’s seat. “Puffing like that on his burns was bloody brilliant. Probably felt like he had fire ants gnawing on his face.”
He didn’t waste any more time. “Where are you?” he demanded, turning his back on the Earl, on the opportunity for revenge.
How could a man with an eidetic memory forget to ask his flat-mate for his share of the rent and bills and groceries anyway?
“Get out,” she snapped, her voice decidedly female. And American.
The first picture was of Marie Devine’s body, clearly minutes after death had occurred.
She endured the tedious security check without rolling her eyes while thinking
Of course Sherlock observed and therefore moved faster than anyone else. As Sherlock took Chibs to the ground, the guards stared in bafflement. Two seconds too late, the room reverberated with the unmistakable sound of a shotgun being pumped.
“Because,” Mitton held his hands up in the air, as if Mary was the cop and he was the criminal. “I’m being framed for murder.”
“You’re right,” Violet pivoted, nodding while frowning in exaggerated agreement. “It was a
“No,” Mary paused by the kitchen doorway. “Not directly, at least not the blackmail bit.”
“Night-vision goggles?” John stared at them in utter disbelief. “Where and how did you get this?”
“You should have just told your parents or the cops.
Molly felt her heart melt as she dug in her pockets for her mobile. Greg would be Raffles’ dad but Sherlock was still his father.
As Moriarty continued to insult Molly’s virtue in an effort to rattle Lestrade, Sherlock continued to scan Violet from head to toe. Then it hit him… her coat. It looked bulky on her when lately her clothes had been hanging loosely on her. It was also buttoned up to her throat, but the belt was not tied around her waist.
“What have you heard, or should I ask, what have you done?”
“No,” Jenny said. “I’m saying someone

you find him,” he stood in the middle of his room, hands behind his back. “I told you, he’s clever and fast. Don’t say I didn’t warn you when you decided to engage in this little enterprise.”
John snorted, “I’m beginning to see why Sherlock thinks love is a chemical defect.”
.” John had also strenuously protested against the dog being taken away, explaining in his crisp, military voice that  Gladstone was well-behaved and obeyed Sherlock absolutely.
“I don’t believe you. You’ve never taken a straight road when there was a crooked one available. What are you really up to, Victor?”
They never made it back to the bedroom that night.
“Violet,” Mitton started to whimper again when he was eased into the wheelchair.
While watching Sherlock fight his inner demons, she had silently mouthed to John:
“Hang on. You think Mycroft created the whole suicide mission as a cover story? You think Mycroft was actually sending Sherlock away so he couldn’t be prosecuted for….” John cut himself off, remembering that he was in a cab and one never really knew who the cab driver could be. “You know,” he muttered lamely instead.
“You will probably want to pull your hair back and put your eyeglasses on.”
He had been involved with some crazy shit ever since he had patched in with the Sons… but… the
“Alright,” she put on her oven mitts. “I’ll think about it.”
“Paulie,” the old wolf resumed speaking English. “How soon can you and Ernie get him to the Onion Field?”

hard enough to keep his mind occupied. He was bored stupid, which was why he was reading
She locked the door and sobbed into the mobile, “There’s someone in our flat and he’s attacking my husband, DI Lestrade,” she added as she ducked into the wardrobe.
“Cool, got it,” Rat Boy nodded his head as Green and Vibart abandoned their pool game.
.. except when he was frightened…. Or…
She turned to him finally, tucking a chocolate-brown curl behind her ear. Softly, she asked, “When you were in the Persian Gulf, back in ’89, did you serve with a Major Anthony Hunter?”
“No. Living in a world in a world that you are not in… even if that meant I couldn’t
10 October 2015
Only he could have made such a deductive leap. Everyone else looking for her wouldn’t have even considered craigslist. They were too busy monitoring airports, train stations or bus stops.
He also wanted to make him beg for mercy… thrice.
Sherlock looked at her blankly.
Grabbing his second-best dressing gown, he unselfconsciously took Gladstone out in barefoot and in his night-clothes. After having a bit of fun with a paparazzo lurking around 221 Baker Street (“Gladstone,
Her heart stopped pounding and actually sank all the way down to the soles of her feet when they drove into Winterbourne-on-Avon. It was pretty. It was picturesque and quaint. It screamed “Quintessential English Village.”
John carefully made his way up the ladder to the roof. He stuck his head out and immediately saw the Great Detective.
“Good luck killing the Earl,” Sherlock snapped, turned on his heel and stormed out of the club.
injury John hadn’t known about.
Senator Josiah Woodhouse threw a copy of the
Sherlock thought wearily.
The corpse reeked to high heaven, like pork that had turned.
The announcer droned again that they were approaching the Sox-35 platform.
“Care to clue me in?” John asked after Mary departed. Although, as a doctor, he had a feeling he knew exactly why Mary had wanted to speak to Violet and why Sherlock looked so damned uncomfortable right now.
“You. Don’t. Love. Her.”
“Yes you do! It’s just that…everything is just so… ” Molly floundered as Sherlock bent down to pick up the toxicology textbook. Frantically she thought

Even to his troublesome, rebellious daughter, damn her.
British government, Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock’s frosty elder brother. But it didn’t take long for Violet to see that Ciaran, the doe-eyed Irishman, was actually dangerously and pathologically obsessed with Sherlock Holmes. Despite needing the IRA’s money and good will to prove her own innocence and to root out the real traitors, Violet ceased giving Ciaran critical personal information regarding the detective…
Violet puffed out an annoyed breath. She knew she couldn’t delay much longer, she knew the clock was counting down on Mitton. Before she made any moves, she wanted to know exactly what was in that garage.
him like boys
“What do you want Holmes?” the Irishman barked. Now the Australian’s mouth fell open and the black man said “See, I told
“Oh really?” Sherlock felt his interest twitch, like a bloodhound catching a scent.
He could even feel the summer breeze ruffling his curls.
Donovan knew, she just knew, that Miss Smith was not what she seemed.
SoHo, London
Limping behind her, he explained, “Per Mycroft, I went to Paris to spy on Lucas. That bitch, that Madame… Fromage (or whatever the hell she called herself) jumped me. Tasered me. When I came to, my weapon was missing. Took me a bit, but I figured out where they were hiding. But when I got to the flophouse, I heard the gunshot. I knew I’d have no chance. I bolted.” He leaned against the doorjamb as Violet entered the door code.
Slowly he made his way to the table were the prepaid was tucked into his jacket pocket. The redheaded bitch shacking up with William (…
“We separated, actually. Around this time.”
?  Meaning:
*puts blindfold on, lights cigarette, waits for the firing squad...*
Sherlock stood up and slipped his hand from hers. “Very well,” he murmured. He let her walk ahead towards the bedroom as he shut lights off and drew the drapes.
“Um,” John managed to shake the young man’s hand without dropping the towel. “Right, you too. Now, go. Sleep. Eat something. Do your homework, in that precise order.”
Violet waited as the kettle boiled.
“You’ll have it if you answer my questions, all my questions. Mind you, your protection won’t be cozy. You probably won’t see the light of day again, but better than being skinned alive.”
“Ah, yes. No hard feelings but that was business. Needed to put your colleague Mr. Holmes in his place, but look at you,” the Professor took a sip of tea. “You surprised us all again by surviving. I was glad for it. Also, I must find a way to thank you for tidying up a little problem I’ve been having,” he looked over his shoulder at Peters’ body. “So full of promise, but he got sloppy in the end. Started letting sentiment cloud his good judgment, his vendetta against Agent Hunter, you see,” he explained. “
But now Mycroft’s smile became cruel. “As long as it takes you to root out the mole, so I wouldn’t suggest delaying the process just to keep your
“Well…” Josie folded her lips tightly together. “You’ll really pay for it?” she asked in a tiny voice. “I really don’t have a lot of money. And I won’t get paid for tonight.”
“No,” Maggie cut across her. “There are no buts. It is what it is. Leave it, Jenny.”
She stroked Gladstone with her fingertips.
“You were with Mary,” Sherlock broke away from John, heading towards His Chair.
Emotional Move
“She was brilliant though, amazing,” John studied the cracks in the cheap plaster ceiling. “Spot a loophole in an argument a mile away, she could. She not only had command of the British legal system, but other countries as well. She knew all these obscure laws in all these far-off places and how to get around them. I used to live in dread of the day she and Sherlock met. I imagined the rows,” he smiled ruefully, feeling the tears burning again. “Then I imagined them becoming the best of friends. I thought… I had hoped, if she could ever get sober, she could, I don’t know, help a bit. With cases and whatnot,” he looked down again, studying his nearly empty glass. Despite his best efforts, he had still consumed his pint too quickly and the drink went straight to his head. He wasn’t drunk per se, but definitely felt a bit lightheaded and (truth be told,) a bit queasy.
“Start from the beginning, if you please,” Mycroft lifted his chin and placed his long, slender hand on the crook of his umbrella handle.
“Even better, I told him it was illogical and impractical to think that way.”
John felt like he had been kicked in the gut. By an elephant.
But they themselves actually were not affiliated with
But he didn’t need to know that.
“Platonic best friend?” Violet lifted her other eyebrow.
“No. I did my research,” Violet smirked. “But that’s how their family was ennobled in the first place, they had supported Queen Mary during her rampage before she dropped dead and Elizabeth the Virgin took the throne.”
No one heard the cad yelp over the dreadful “music.”
“Not like her.”
She looked at the stacks of headshots and applications on her desk.
John gave Dupin a pained look, “Um, can it wait?”
“So when you said Alice killed her mum, you were just being overly dramatic, as usual.” Victor’s blond brows furrowed together. “Alice was just the means to the end.”
Mary reached behind her and pulled out her gun from out of the back of her skinny jeans. The baggy top had mostly concealed it, from the unobservant.
“What are you doing here?” both men said at the same time.
“Yeah,” Mitty said.
“You are coercing me to defect from my country,” she pressed her hand to her chest. “To England,” she pointed to the floor. “So I want a job. Recruit me, or Miss Smith, or Mrs. Holmes or whatever the hell name you want me to go by.”
*Sherlock's original rant about Dupin can be found in "A Study in Scarlet." Spoiler Alert - Sherlock REALLY doesn't think all that highly about Dupin:
“No, we don’t,” John’s voice was a half-sob, “Oh, Mary. I’m sorry, I’m so sorry…”
When they walked into the restaurant, Rucastle waited for them along with the hostess who held three heavy leather folders, presumably the menus. “Got held up? Signing autographs, Mr. Holmes?” Rucastle winked again. “Don’t worry. You won’t have to deal with that here. There is a strict photography rule here because so many celebrities will dine here. This establishment will cater to mostly celebrities, actually. So they can have a bit of privacy. The rule is anyone caught taking photographs with either a camera or a smartphone will have their device confiscated and then be asked to leave. After all the pictures have been deleted, of course.”
“Oh, so you’ve replaced sugar with amphetamines?”
“How did I give myself away?” she shook her head in disbelief, then winced again. “Ow,” she squeezed her eyes tightly shut. She hoped she didn’t have a concussion, but she didn’t have any of the symptoms other than a raging headache. “I was so careful.” Stubbornly, she added, “I know how your mind works.”
,” he commanded.
Sherlock felt his lungs deflate, actually collapse. Half of his heart sang with relief, the other half shriveled up and died.
“’Go, go, go…’” Mason murmured. “That is strange. Do you think that it was Miss Smith? That she’s actually not English?”
There was no friendly Mrs. Hudson type hovering around with tea and cakes. The concrete stairs lead straight up to the landing, covered with thinning carpet so dirty Mary wasn’t sure if it really was grey or if it was so filthy it had turned grey. There was only one door to the right, an ugly wooden thing that looked so flimsy that one good kick would be enough to smash it to bits.
The Earl and Countess of Winchester’s estates
Sherlock shrugged. “Not as if Lestrade plans on speaking to me again, so his Christian name is irrelevant to me.” Before Violet could ask him an irritating question about how he felt about the stalemate between him and Lestrade, he added, “And Mycroft doesn’t know, to answer your original question. More importantly, he doesn’t care. He would think I’d be as unsentimental about the child as he would be.”
But at least she’s not some crazy murderess like Dr. Watson’s wife..."
“We should come with you,” John said.
But, master of control, disparager of sentiment, he played his part of
Sherlock pressed his lips together then muttered, “I remember being a bit unkind to Violet.”
, John thought as he dug into his coat pockets, only to discover his good leather gloves were missing.
“Oh, well… I… it’s not yet five o’clock,” Violet said lamely.
“Problem?” Sherlock arched an eyebrow.
“What’s going on?” Wiggins immediately demanded.
, shares in an American insurance company that wanted to compete in the global market, preferring to start in English-speaking countries. But England has national health coverage, so they’d never get a foothold here unless the NHS ceased to exist.”
“Get your Irene Nesser passport and identity ready,” he instructed Lisbeth. “Where’s Dupin?”
There was a pause, a long pause, pregnant with all the things unsaid between the brothers. “I never thought you were an idiot,” Mycroft finally admitted. “I’m sorry you felt you had to turn to drugs instead of your family when things became unbearable.”
Then an unfamiliar young American voice grumbled, “God-dammit, not again.”
While they bickered, Sherlock left his wrist in John’s hand, even when John stopped massaging it. Neither man broke eye contact as they hurled good-natured insults at each other.
“You’re stalling.”
Monday afternoon
Violet now looked more pea-green than grey but she said in a wobbling voice, “If they agree to protect Julia and Vivian, I’ll do it.”
… then remembered her own daughter was out there, somewhere.
Triggers for violence, animal abuse and just general not-goodness...
Once the train screeched away from the Garfield stop, Violet relaxed and pushed the hood off her head. She felt the hypnotic jerk and sway of the train as it rattled its way north.
She wished she had her trainers on so she could run. Or her gym was open so she could kick and punch a bag. Or she could take a long motorcycle ride to clear her head…
Her skin erupted into gooseflesh. Her breath caught in her throat.
“So my darrrrrrrrrrrrrling brother could turn on the cameras on my mobile and laptop when I was unaware,” Sherlock drawled.
“Shut up, John,” Violet and Sherlock said in unison.
He knew Dupin would
“What kind of job do you think?” she dropped her soft “Mary Morstan” voice now. “You’re a part of the Homeless Network. I need information.”
Upon hearing that, John’s jaw dropped open. Violet however, only joyfully slapped his arm, shoulder and back over and over, as if they were at an exciting sporting event or watching a beloved old movie and the good part was just about to start.
Sherlock’s smirk widened.
Suddenly, her stomach and her intestines twisted horribly, as if someone was using them as jump ropes for a double-dutch competition. She barely made it to the toilet in time and she still had to reach for the trash can and put it between her feet as her bowels let go.
As a fugitive in a foreign land, Violet never thought she’d be happy to hear police sirens.  A few grateful tears slipped out. She awkwardly dashed them away as she heard someone say through some sort of amplifier to exit the vehicle with their hands on their head.
Sherlock somehow managed to look angelic. But a devilish smile still pulled at his lips.
“Thanks for reminding me,” she snorted. “But I’d rather continue the fiction that I’m thirty-seven rather than dealing with the reality that I actually turned forty.” Violet pulled out a bottle of Macallan 12 Year Old Single Malt Scotch
, she ordered herself.
But the tone of his voice hadn’t matched that malevolent expression that had flickered on his face.
Every hour on the dot, the smiling Dr. Sankaran would wander in, check on her, ask how she was feeling and ask her to rate the pain, ask her if she was hungry, if she wanted a sandwich and some crisps or maybe even some biscuits. She never responded.
The cab pulled up in front of 221 Baker Street. The pavement was clear of paparazzi, for once. The only positive aspect of the decreased work load was that Sherlock’s fame diminished a bit as well. He could stay out of the spotlight when he wasn’t working high-profile cases for The Met.
“You have got to get Hunter back to the United States,” Marshall stood up but stayed well away from the window, even though the blinds were closed. “Holmes, I advised you that nine months ago, when she and Carson re-emerged on the world’s stage.”
; you dove head-first into alcohol after your father had perished in the First Gulf War. Had it not been the intervention of your grandmother and the love for your little brother, you may have turned out to be just as much of an addict as I am.” Lightly, he added, “Perhaps you are. Perhaps you need the rush and the fix as much as I do.”
He made himself fix his eyes on Mary, and willed himself to let her speak.
Plays rough w/puppy. Red flag or just too young for a pet?
“Apology accepted,” Sherlock said sourly.
“Well. There you go. Things have a tendency to sort themselves out in the end,” John fiddled with the hem of the duvet. He cleared his throat, wincing. “I told Violet I wanted you to kill him, Moriarty. Cut off his head if needs be.”
“One hundred percent?” John jeered.
? Her mind, her wonderful vibrant mind (
Mycroft Holmes also did not waste time, “When, where and how?”
“No. I really don’t,” Sherlock grumbled. “Why do you and John insist I mean ‘Thank you’ when I clearly did not say thank you?”
To my American friends, have a happy Thanksgiving!
“You’ve gotten better,” Sherlock snipped, but his face as softened. He sprang out of his chair and padded towards his music stand, surrounded by ink-blotted sheet music.
“You really are fond of purple prose, aren’t you?” Violet tried to joke but it fell flat. She turned, tried to unsuccessfully hail another cab. When another one refused to stop, she turned back to John, more slowly this time, mindful of the ice. “I’m not a coward,” her eyes still blazed but the tears had returned. “But I
He found Chibs and Trager watching Violet trying to pick a lock. “They went old school up here,” Violet straightened, holding out the picklock set to Sherlock. “You’re faster.”
Harry had eaten all her prawns and most of her chips. She was pouring herself a second mug of tea. She set the pot down carefully. “Does he know that she’s sick?”
“Nearly eighteen years ago, I believe?”
Violet ripped the book out of his hands. “Why the FUCK are there
bedroom. After Sherlock’s “death,” John had gathered his clothes, his laptop and a few of his favorite books, vowing to come back for the rest of his things and to sort through Sherlock’s possessions.
“Uh… OK,” Molly produced her nervous smile as Mrs. Holmes handed Henry over, but Pink Hair handled him like a pro. “Used to nanny before I decided to go to uni,” she explained. “I’m an art major, hope to open my own gallery someday. I’m Emma, by the way, since this rude lump,” she good-naturedly grinned at Macpherson, “Didn’t do intros. And you are?”
“Chill out, bud,” Violet muttered to the dog before asking Sherlock, “So what was the trigger? Victor or the paparazzi?”
“Oh relax,” the old lion said jovially. “Once we have

François le Villard.
“Care to clue me in?” Dupin asked, speaking for the first time since they had boarded the Metro carriage back in Montmartre.
“That is precisely why I cannot just arrest her. Or have her executed.”
“When in reality, he’s so far deep in the closet, he’s in Narnia.”
Molly pulled the trigger.
“Charming, how you all continue to defend the virtuous Mary Watson,” Mycroft dryly chuckled. “The cat-lover. The bread-maker. The noble nurse. The loving wife.”
“I know,” he whispered. Stalled then lowered his head to hers. “I can’t fix this for him, can I?”

He selected an LG Revere he had purchased in the duty-free shop in the Boston Logan International Airport when he and Lisbeth had first flown to America. Only after he had put the false bottom back in the piano bench, put the sheet music neatly away and drank the second glass of water, did he sit down and dial her number from memory.
“What else did Miss Dobney’s unfortunate mother have to say about her common law husband? Night job? Factory?”
“That would be greatly appreciated,” Dupin smiled. “Sherlock, is your presence required by Interpol any further?”
And again.
“At least we’re not boring.”

Dupin unwound his long legs. Reaching for his dry, woolly socks, he said slyly, “When one recovers the emerald and diamond necklace and earrings of Empress Marie-Louise after they have been stolen from the Louvre, one can do as one pleases in the Louvre.” He pulled on his socks. “Providing you don’t bring food and drink into the museum and don’t take flash photography of the delicate paintings, of course. That would be unforgivable in a place like this.”
“She didn’t,” Sherlock said coldly. “And not only will I prove she didn’t kill herself, but I’ll prove that the Earl coerced Jepthro Rucastle into murdering her so he could claim her share of the Cullen-Culpepper inheritance.”
She opened the office door, expecting to see Sherlock standing in the middle of her office with his know-it-all sneer firmly fixed on his face. Or worse, at her desk, on her computer, after he had cracked her pass code.
“No, I mean, I ain’t stupid. I know that’s from
Then she became still… very, very still.
“What happens in a year if I do not agree to your request?”
“So, would I be daring too much to hope for grandchildren?” Mrs. Holmes asked brightly.

Hope’s mouth fell open again. Never in their entire lives together had they made that much money.  “I… don’t know what to say…”
Nonplussed, John said, “Throwing a tantrum won’t get you your way either.”
Sherlock obediently clamped his lips together and his face contorted with the effort of keeping his mirth contained. But he just looked so damned ridiculous, John did the only thing he could think of: he started laughing. Soon Sherlock joined in with him and together, they laughed until their sides ached.
Wednesday evening
“Sorry, I’m sorry,” Mary squeezed her eyes tightly shut and crossed her arms against her stomach. Reaching up to rub her temple, she asked, “But logically, who else would do such a horrible thing?”
“Just because you love somebody doesn’t mean that’s the person you’re supposed to end up with,” Violet said gently. “You went back to her out of guilt, because of the baby.”
His internal John murmured,
Of course Sherlock wasn’t hungry though.
Victor was out of his seat too. “Telephones work both ways, Sherlock. So does email.”
John frowned. Sherlock never had much patience with people but something was off. John made a mental note to ask him about it later.

“Oh,” to her credit, the first woman sounded ashamed. “Well, that is dreadful. Very sad to lose a baby and all. I can see why you would feel awkward bu-“
What she was quite sure about was she didn’t like him. Not one jot.
Sherlock crept into the kitchen and froze on the threshold.
“But I’m feeling
John tested his poor ankle, tried to put weight on it, sucked in a sharp breath of pain and shook his head no. “Go,” he said. “I’ll catch up.”
“No.”
Sherlock felt his gut drop to his knees. He was glad he hadn’t touched his meal. He knew who “Holy” Peters was, at least by reputation. Sebastian Moran had been downright cuddly compared to this brute.
“It’s done,” he muttered softly, rising from his seat, now texting Sherlock.
“Well, we have our work cut out for us, don’t we?” Mycroft shooed the agent away as Sherlock just returned inside. Gladstone had a bit of business to take care of on some bushes.
Then, stupidly, he realized the golden haired boy had asked him a question. “What?”
“Oh, my heavens, yes,” Mrs. Hudson pressed her hand to her chest. “I knew it was going to be warm down there, but I had no idea about the humidity. Like a warm, wet blanket thrown over you. My son, Scooter, oh the poor lad had asthma as a child. Summers were a nightmare for him. Thank God he outgrew it but still, there’d be nights where he couldn’t catch his breath, my poor boy…”
John reached for his shoes, shoveled his feet into them and then dialed for a cab. Gave his address and told the dispatch he needed to go to New Scotland Yard.
Peter’s eyes widened just a bit. But, used to curt orders, he merely popped another macaron into his mouth and popped a few of the dainty pastries into his pocket. He swaggered out, carrying a delicate china tea cup in his gigantic dustpan-sized hands.
“That’s not the same as allergies, dear,” Mrs. Holmes continued to surf the Internet. “What about Florida? We’ve never been to Florida.”
Once the cab started moving though, Violet ceased being “Miss Smith.”
Thank you again for all the comments and kudos and hits! Every time I get a notification from The Archive, my heart sings :^)
But it was Trager who chimed in, “So you’re gonna have to trust us when we tell you if something is real or not,” he re-entered the room fully now, clutching a gray blanket. “My name’s Tig, I’m a friend of St-, Sherlock and Violet. I’m gonna help you out of his hellhole and so is my president, Chibs Telford.”
“Why were you in the Ladies’?”
! Why are our siblings dead and that bastard still alive?”
want to ask me about?”
“Because somebody threw it down from the roof at us when we reached the hospital,” John pointed at Violet’s image. Continuing to tap repeatedly on the mobile’s screen while Sherlock looked bemused, John explained, “This had to have been taken the day you were kidnapped by Anderson when you went off like a tit to go rescue those immigrant kids. Violet and I had received an audio tape of you reading a poem. It was a clue, leading us to the roof at Bart’s.”
The accent was very Miss Smith, but the words were very Agent Hunter.

“Yeah, OK,” John reluctantly agreed but he pursed his lips tightly together. After last night, he wasn’t so sure Violet

had done because of her, and she had barely touched him. Just bared her body, hit him with a riding crop, kissed him on the cheek. Made promises she never intended to keep.
“Hm,” Sherlock loosened his fingers around John’s wedding ring. “Of course. But I’m curious. Aren’t you afraid of the repercussions caused by this act? And do be quick with your explanation why or why not as I have a friend and a fiancée to save.”
“Yes, it was a shame,” Molly said, feeling guilty. She had slipped into his office and checked his diary to see if there had been a weekend in July when he was out of town.
Back in April of 2014, John had convinced everyone in their little circle to gang up on Sherlock to find a new flat-mate. Lestrade, Molly, John and Mary and Mrs. Hudson had all insisted Sherlock find someone else to live with him after John got married so he wouldn’t be alone. Sherlock had spat out logical arguments why he preferred living alone but he always ended up trying again to find a flat-mate, mostly so everyone would shut up and leave him alone.
“You expect a drama-queen and an ex-junkie like Sherlock to go try and off himself,” Molly said what Lestrade wouldn’t, but her sad smile and gentle voice tempered the harsh words. “That’s the problem, isn’t it? The people who need help the most are the least likely to look like they need it. Worse yet, even less likely to ask for it.”
“Oh yes, Maggie. Up in Pediatrics. I see Molly and Maggie go out to lunch quite a bit,” Bodley nodded sagely.
“I’ve been trying it out in my head for a while now,” she explained. “I never said it out loud yet.”
“I’m sure it was,” John had wanted to be the one to pull the trigger. Because of Moriarty, John not only had lost his best friend for two years and his daughter Maisie for God knows how long but permanently lost his old military comrade James Sholto, his sister Harry and his unborn son.
she quailed to herself, thinking about all the horrible places her son could have ended up, instead of sleeping peacefully in his cot in the next room.
Mycroft was up in his ivory tower, pulling the puppet strings.
“He did piss himself,” Lisbeth pointed out.
“Yes,” Sherlock said. “I see.”
As he had jerked his foot out in dismay and loudly bemoaned the ruination of his favorite pair of Oxfords, Violet had crept up behind him and mildly exclaimed,
But John swiftly moved away from Sherlock’s touch. “I’m fine, I’m fine. I don’t need to sit. But I do need air. This shoebox of a flat is suffocating me. I… I have to get out,” John pivoted away from Sherlock to snatch up his mobile, gun and coat.
“Oh.”
Mrs. Toller turned the gun on Mary. “Upstairs,
“It wasn’t as if I was working for
and others.”
Feebly she scraped her fingernails against the plywood separating her from the guest of honor.
Everyone filed out of the room. Gladstone growled at Rudy as he skittered by.
“Yeah, that’s kind of what I do,” Violet reminded him. “You investigate and draw conclusions based on hard data and scientific methods. I study emotions and behavioral patterns to create a profile in order to determine the motivations behind the actions. You solve the crimes. I figure out why the crook did it in the first place.” She sat down at the kitchen table as Sherlock got the kettle and two mugs out. “And I don’t want tea.”
“Correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t marriage supposed to be a partnership? One does not get to make decisions that affect the pair without discussion? Do you really believe John would do something that would affect you without telling you?”
Alquonquin?
“Until he leaves me.”
“My brother?”
Thank you all so much for reading :^)
“We had to do something to draw the attention of the police and FBI,” Violet explained. “If we tried to call 911 or Homeland Security, they’d either laugh at the sheer absurdity of it or ignore the call.” Thinking about her desperate call to Sally Donovan, trying to explain that Jim Moriarty was setting Sherlock up for a literal Fall, she added, “Or both.”
But like all rides, it had to end. Threading his long fingers through John’s hair then dragging his fingers lightly down John’s face, Sherlock cleared his throat, “Did you… would you… I mean, if you’re more comfortable sleeping by yourself out here, I’m amenable of course…”
As Donovan and Whitey made plans, Professor Moriarty politely followed an estate agent as she gave him a tour of Appledore. The woman babbled nervously while trying to discreetly pull down the jacket of her too-tight lavender pantsuit. Her ridiculous heels click-clacked on the marble floors.
the coffee table was broken, he shooed Gladstone off the sofa. The dog emitted a sulky whimper and slunk off only to jump into Sherlock’s chair instead, as if to say: “So there.”
“My old lady messed up her back last winter when she slipped on the ice. Said it was my fault for not sanding the sidewalk,” he admitted sheepishly. When he noticed her hesitation, he had added, “It’s only one 50 mg pill. You know my old lady’s a nurse, or was, until she got busted for stealing oxy, anyway,” he ran his hand over his smooth bald head. “She told me to give this to you. You ain’t gonna get addicted and you need to control the pain.”
“Two things,” Sherlock reached behind the stack of toast. Gladstone, thinking he was about to get another treat, sat up eagerly, his tail thumping against the floor.
(See the end of the chapter for
He currently held onto his job by the skin of his teeth.
Sherlock thought the seams of his trousers were about to split.
Sherlock jerked his head towards his front door and Violet followed him. “You are correct. Mary’s maternal instinct is clouding her good sense. It’s only a matter of time before she engages on a murderous rampage if she believes that is the only way to retrieve her daughter. Her marriage to John is the only thing now keeping her tethered to the side of angels.”
He had made some pointed comments about the potential paternity of Molly Hooper’s baby.
11 June 2015
, Violet felt her heart freeze as she remembered a conversation she had with Sherlock shortly after they first met…
But what should have been an open-and-shut case turned into forty-eight hours of car chases, computer hacking, fleeing down darkened alleys and (to John’s abject horror) leaping from rooftop to rooftop. Granted, the roofs were on two storey houses in Chelsea but still…
“Jesus Christ, Johnny,” Harry snapped, “I’m trying add a silver lining to this shitty day, alright? Besides, it doesn’t matter what any church says. We love each other. We don’t need a priest or vicar to make our vows real. And just because our idiot government doesn’t recognize it as a legal marriage, we’re still going to have a proper wedding, except there’ll be two wedding dresses instead of one. But there will be flowers, loads of flowers and good food and dancing. All of our friends and the family members we actually like will be there as well. So instead of being all po’faced, congratulate your sister on her future happiness.”
“It’s the old argument again, isn’t it? I want kids, you don’t. And even if you came around to my way of thinking… well, nobody in their right mind is going to give a baby to two recovering addicts, are they?”
Their first date had been to a bloody, fucking
“As I am trying to explain to you, he
The mobile slipped from Sherlock’s hands, onto the duvet. “I will not allow either you or Violet to get in harm’s way,” he whispered. He closed his eyes and rested his head back on the pillow. “I’m tired John. Tell me about the burned body later.”
Her mobile vibrated:
“Concurred.”
Clarissa sobbed. “A v-vest, like… like what the suicide bombers wear.” Her voice shook like mad now. “I’ve got a bomb strapped to me.”
“Fear Valley… no, that’s not right…
In English, the Australian told the Irishman, “Get confirmation from our relief. We know Holmes and Watson were snooping around this morning. Plus, they’re late.”
He waggled the mobile at him.
Oddly, she had appreciated it that he had automatically included her in planning their escape instead of treating her like the pathetic damsel he had to save.
“That’s good… that’s brilliant, really,” Victor said. “Seven years… has it really been seven years? Since we last spoke, since we last saw each other?”
“I know.”
“William,” Mycroft said, only to needle him.
“I have few regrets, Agent Hunter but I do regret how poorly I handled… oh,” he exhaled suddenly, digging in his coat pocket. When he extracted a packet of cigarettes, he asked, “Do you mind?”
“Holy shit,” the fifty-two year old war vet rumbled. “You’re… you’re Tony Hunter’s girl.” He scoured his memory for her name, her

“You knew John still carried the Army Browning, even though he should have turned that in when he left the military.” She lifted her eyes up to him, as a fresh horror chilled her more than the stinging snow. “You knew Sherlock was not stable,” she added in a low voice. “You let him go to Appledore anyway.”

His hair was still damp but he was dressed neatly in one of his black suits paired with a midnight blue dress shirt. He carried his socks and shoes in his hands. “Ah, Mary, hello,” he leaned over and pecked her on the cheek.
“Oh, my blood pressure is too high,” Lestrade groused. “Molly’s taken me off all caffeine.”
Sherlock shook his head, crossed his legs and steepled his finger tips, “Not by Moriarty’s people or MI-6.”
Violet thought as she pulled her coat back on.
her.”
“Yes, well,” Sherlock said brusquely. “We should go, there’s a wedding dance we’re meant to be attending and we might be missed so…”
“What did you deduce from studying the photographs? Don’t bore me either. It’s the only way to get back into my good graces at this moment.”
She had no desire to blend in. She wanted to disappear.
Sherlock tilted his head, “This is part of the story where you might get a little upset with me.”
“Sounds reasonable,” Sherlock kept his eyes closed and laced his fingers over his bare chest.
She had been shot in the exact same place where he had been shot last summer.
“What shot?” She put the water and pill bottle down on the fireplace mantle.
She was the perfect housekeeper, Mrs. Pringle. Silver-haired and pleasant, Mrs. Pringle had been heavily vetted for her position, of course. A childless widow, she didn’t even have a parking ticket. She dressed neatly, usually a twin-set and black skirt during the warmer months or black trousers and a twin-set during the colder months. But she always wore sensible shoes and had reading glasses on a chain around her neck. She was consistently polite but did not overstep her boundaries, like a certain Not-Your-Housekeeper over on Baker Street. Mycroft paid Mrs. Pringle well and she paid him little kindnesses like slipping him biscuits or giving him extra sugar when he was stressed. But that was as far as she went. She did the cooking, the cleaning and the laundering and did it all very well. But she didn’t adopt Mycroft the way Mrs. Hudson had taken Sherlock on.
“Thought not,” Violet idly scratched Gladstone’s head. “The other thing that didn’t make sense to me was why Sherlock was wearing the Belstaff and his scarf. I’ve worn it. It’s 100 percent wool and it’s hot as hell. He fell in June. Now I know summers don’t get as hot as  the ones I lived through as a teenager in Indiana or when I worked in the New Mexico field office, but it does get warm here in June. Plus, I never saw him wear the Belstaff this summer. So why was Sherlock bundled up like it was the dead of winter when he met Moriarty on the roof during the beginning of summer? My guess is he had some protective gear underneath his clothes. A neck brace, shins splints, maybe even some padding to protect his ribs.”
Happy Whatever-Winter-Holiday-You-Care-to-Celebrate-this-Time-of-Year! :^)
“Quite right,” Sherlock hummed, as if that was the answer to everything.
“I’m not your son,” John furrowed his fair brows as he glared at the loan shark.
“How the fuck did John Watson wind up with someone like
“Anthea believes you saved her from Mary the night you interrogated her about the missing Watson infant. Anthea speaks five languages, by the way. You speak, only four, I believe? And while you’re not fluent in Russian, you know enough to scrape by.”
Monday afternoon
“Won’t happen.”
“He does?” Molly squeaked.
“Yes I can. You just arranged it for the Paris police to give me a tidy little sum to keep me quiet about being falsely imprisoned.”
“Got it,” Billy Wiggins crowed.
“You know I don’t pay attention to politics, especially American politics. I was still surprised to learn we didn’t have a king.”
“Yes.”
“Location?” Sherlock lifted his heavy brows, putting his hands behind his back, still holding the two broken pieces of his Snoopy and Woodstock mug.
“And I told you I didn’t care,” Violet fluttered her eyelashes at him, apparently recovered from her anger and her shock. “What about security? Is it these two against the world, or will they have support from MI-6?”
Now he was extremely interested. He snatched up the slip of paper. “There’s no account number.”
“Violet, I didn’t even know Victor existed before Sunday. And I’m his best friend. It could not only affect the case we’re taking for Victor’s  sister-in-law. This could very well affect your safety, I’m sorry to say. He’s not a complete machine, you know. He has feelings. He just has masterful control over them. But if there’s something still between him and Victor… well, that could blow a giant hole in your cover story, couldn’t it?”
Yes, she had kept her gun under her pillow. Always had, even before being burned by the FBI.
Sherlock suffered through the Tube ride, battling the nausea and the chattering of all the useless, insipid people around him. All wearing poppies to memorialize a war hardly anyone remembered why it was fought in the first place.
“Hm?” Violet looked over at Mary, who had pulled the car over.
“Oh. OK, then…why do you think he’s missing then if he didn’t run away or-”
“Well… yeah, but-”
“Oh I know,” the man sounded amused now. “He didn’t even have the original five thou he owed me. But well, he doubled-down at the Grand National last month,” his smile was a thin, cold line, more of a slash between his chin and nose. “He lost.”
Violet’s jaw dropped. “I thought Ford hated him?”
?” Mrs. Holmes pressed her knuckles over her eyes then her mouth. Her shoulders shook. She reached into the sleeve of her woolly dressing gown and plucked out a tissue. “Don’t you think I know that?” she lowered her voice. She swiped at her eyes then blew her nose. Binning the used tissue, she told Violet, “Let me tell you the last piece of the puzzle, the part you don’t understand, the reason why we didn’t do The Right Thing. After hearing me out, then you can judge me…”
“They’re not after me. They want me alive. Broken, but alive and in order to achieve that goal, they are pursuing the people closest to
“That’s the third reason why I’m here,” Sherlock crossed over to her. When he was an arm’s length away from her, he said, “You’re a good cop, Sally. You’re just a shit homicide detective.”
But, remembering his promise to Sherlock, he merely said “Hey,” pretending to be consumed with putting the files in his bag.
Toller lowered the gun. “You really are mad!
“What?” Violet demanded, a bit startled. She had never heard Mary Morstan Watson cuss before… but then, she wasn’t dealing with Mary Morstan Watson anymore, was she?
But Toller shook his head, “Everyone thinks your pressure point is
But he cut across her, “Do you know what Moriarty’s people will do if the rumors are confirmed that he’s mine?” Before Violet could answer, Sherlock told her: “They will sell him to the highest bidder. And can you deduce who the highest bidder would be, if he ever found out  the child’s true paternity?”
, it will take exactly twenty-two minutes for MI-6 agents to reach Mont Saint Michel.”
She made a mental note to text John later, to check the toxicology again. Sherlock would insist on hard data, and rightfully so. One couldn’t convict someone because they felt a flutter in their stomach or their left ear lobe itched on a Wednesday. Instinct is good. Evidence is better.
“Probably not,” Sherlock arranged the cups on the tray, waiting for the kettle to boil. “As far as she’s concerned, he is straight as an arrow.”
“As you should.”
Chapter Thirty-two:
With a shudder, he suddenly remembered the horrors everyone endured when his parents decided to wean Baby William from his paccie. The incessant howls threatened to deafen everyone in the village, as well as their neighbors. If Mummy and Daddy hadn’t persevered in their efforts, Mycroft was sure William would still have his paccie to this day. But after that, there was the terrible phase where he sucked his thumb, which brought on another set of screaming temper tantrums when Mummy and Daddy set on breaking him of that bad habit. Mycroft knew it was no coincidence his little brother loved lollipops. Mycroft was also the only one who didn’t find it amusing when William used to strut around with the entire lolly shoved into his mouth and the stick hanging out like a cigarette.
“Can I burn him?” there was no denying the savage delight in Toller’s voice.
“I’m not an assassin.”
His heart pounded. He had only hidden one of the vials when he heard her coming down the hallway to help tend to his injuries.
“So you see why they have to die, Holmes and Hunter.”
“Very well,” Sherlock set the tumblers down and gently plucked the bottle out of her hands. He dispensed with the seal, removed the cap then deftly poured them both two fingers. He held the glass up to her in a toast, “To the very best of times, my dear Violet.”
Sherlock dropped the flannel in the sink basin and sat down on the toilet.
The dog raced to him, nearly dancing on his hind legs to indicate his desperation to Go Out. Sherlock thought the Alsatian was going to yank his arm out of his socket as he darted down the stairs towards the main door. His head throbbed with every footstep he made on the stairs.
was annoying.
John then vividly remembered Violet blowing Jack Woodley’s brains out after Gladstone had savaged him.
“Something stupid, something funny,” He stood up and smoothed a strand of hair off her damp face, “Something to take our minds off of these past few crap days, yeah?”
. “The timing is not right to take AGRA out,” Violet told him. “If Mary disappears now, then John will have nothing to lose. And you’ll be dead, John will be in prison or dead and there will be nothing I can do to stop Sherlock from spiraling out of control, which means the ‘Miss Smith’ cover will be blown and I’ll either be in prison or dead.”
“The MI-6 mole,” Mycroft said succinctly.
But he knew Sherlock couldn’t cut him out forever.
More importantly, he taught John how to observe.
There were newspapers and magazines scattered all around the coffee table like a paper moat.
“No one is necessarily crying over Woodley’s death.”
Greg and Molly Lestrade’s residence
Once the plane touched down in Heathrow, there had been another one of Mycroft’s government cars waiting for them.
“You really are an attention-seeking whore,” Violet’s voice was frigid. “How dare you spoil a lovely evening with this ridiculous temper tantrum? You told Mr. Holmes that he shouldn’t have lied to you because the pair of you could have been friends. Well, it takes two to maintain a friendship. He even forgave you for all the lies you told that tabloids about seven-times-in-one-night and making you wear the deer-stalker, for God’s sake. He didn’t sue you like he did Kitty Riley. So if you can’t be polite, then leave.” She let Janine go and stood up to her full height. Actually, because of her heels, she was taller. “You could have just been courteous, said hello and gone about your way.”
huge.”
He thought about the tiny sequins twinkling in the lace of Molly’s dress… how she had sparkled like stars when the light had hit her just right… how
He cupped Jim’s face in his weather-beaten, liver-spotted hands, gazing in his eyes. “You’ve done brilliantly Jim. Everything has gone according to plan.”
“Jesus!” Now John leapt to his feet. “Why didn’t Lucas call? Should I tell him to call Mycroft?” John reached for the Bluetooth clip on his ear, but Sherlock seized him by the wrist and minutely shook his head.
Meanwhile, back at the Devil’s Foot clubhouse, only a few bikers milled about. Vibart chain-smoked in front of the television set, watching ESPN play highlights from the earlier Cubs’ game. Green and Chibs played a friendly game of pool. Sherlock sat in the corner by himself, arms crossed, eyes closed, appearing to be sleeping but in reality, deep in thought.
” John choked out. “You were only supposed to be gone for a few months, not…”
“OK,” she said in a tremulous voice, then immediately added, “But I still don’t want you to go to France.”
, he decided as he kicked off his shoes. Not too stuffy as to turn off Pats’ light-hearted and fun-loving family, but not too libertine as to upset his traditionalist family. His parents and two uncles (who were both vicars) had also left early, shortly after dinner, which helped lighten the atmosphere. Unfortunately most of his cousins had stayed (all die-hard Tories) but once they got to drinking, they forgot their religious and political leanings and started telling embarrassing stories about Victor when he was young (“We used to call him Vicky!”). Then they started chatting up girls and all was well.
Chapter Fifty-six: Chess Blindness
Next to that picture, was a black-and-white surveillance photograph of a disheveled Sherlock slinking out of someone’s flat. Violet didn’t realize the significance of that picture until she looked at the date stamp in the lower right hand corner: 10 January 2015.
“Bony?” Sherlock swiveled his head around. “Oh, I don’t know about that. Looks like he’s put some weight back on. Has Mrs. Pringle been baking again?”
Sitting up in his chair now, Mycroft stared the Earl down and gave him the coldest smile he could muster as he made a solemn, silent vow:
Behind her, Mycroft loudly commanded, “What on earth are you doing? Get down at once!”
“But Violet, she is only se- err, eighteen!”
(See the end of the chapter for
So sorry for not posting last Monday! Life caught up with me. Hopefully this post makes up for it.

“I used to read people for a living. Now I read them to stay alive.”
Seizing the venti Starbucks cup, she had strutted out of the restaurant as if she hadn’t just bugged a Mafia boss’ office.
to Sherlock.
Glad for his own foresight, John hurried up to his old room, clutching the towel. He stripped quickly, leaving his waterlogged clothes in a pile as there was no longer a hamper in the empty room. His flesh broke out in goose-pimples. Shivering, he toweled himself off as fast as he could then he pulled on a white button-up shirt and jeans. He tried to dry his hair, but the towel was already damp. Giving up on that, he pulled on a pair of woolly socks. He sighed and shook his head when he realized his socks didn’t match.
“I acted rashly and killed an innocent woman,” Anthea admitted, in a calm, straight-forward voice.
John had been afraid he’d be set up in some posh, luxury hotel he’d feel out of place and uncomfortable in. He had been equally afraid he’d be staying in some hovel, a shabby youth hostel where kids didn’t mind kipping out on cots, sleeping under scratchy blankets. He privately breathed a sigh of relief when he, Dupin and Gladstone arrived at the hotel they were going to call home for the next few weeks. Then he giggled to himself, thinking about the old children’s story, Goldilocks and the Three Bears. Not too soft, not too hard. Just right.
Her face lit up and John could see the young woman she had been fifteen years ago. Her clear, freckled face unmarred by scars and wrinkles. Her hazel eyes filled with laughter rather than caution and vigilance.
As the train screeched away, picking up speed, the young violinist started playing Adele’s
Meanwhile, across the city, while most people rang in 2016 by drinking cheap champagne and trying to remember the lyrics to Auld Lang Syne, Mycroft Holmes sat alone in front of a roaring fire in the safety of one of his many luxurious safe-houses. He wore a sinfully rich dressing gown that would have made his little brother drool in envy. He drank a glass of very good Pinot Noir, reviewing intelligence he had just received about the latest terrorist attacks in Europe with his socked feet propped up on a pouf.
Violet, meanwhile, had frozen to the spot. “What is this?” she struggled for a conversational tone as Rucastle strode past her.
The wait wasn’t long. Soon Violet and John heard the front door open and close. They could hear Sherlock humming under his breath, pausing to say “Good dog,” to Gladstone. Then there was a flump and a sigh as Sherlock threw himself down on the sofa.
“It was addressed to
“Oh Jesus. Violet, I’m… God. Are you OK? At you at 221B?” he asked, awkwardly concealing the bag containing his gun inside his coat, holding it close to his torso.
Then Ford had said the most extraordinary thing: I trust you because you failed with William.
“Because he doesn’t have to live with you,” John snarled at her. “Because he doesn’t have to second-guess everything you say. Because he doesn’t worry about the next lunatic thing you might do if you have another lapse in judgment.”
Something about her lifeless eyes told him that no boyfriend had hit her in the face. Abused women usually looked scared. She looked…apathetic, as though she was just a spectator in the world instead of an active participant.
“Believe it or not, we had more pressing concerns.”
He turned around and saw Mycroft standing in the pavement, smartly dressed in a three piece suit, leaning on that damnable umbrella of his.
Wednesday afternoon
SNAFU, as usual.
“The balls on you,” he snorted and Violet knew she had him.
“What?” Violet blinked as her throat tightened.
But Gagnon waved John’s words away. “Spare me, Monsieur Watson, your polite fabrications. You say “Met” but I know you mean “MI-5.””
. The sun was barely a sliver of yellowish light on the horizon. The only light in the room was from the slowly dimming streetlamps and only a precious little of that light entered his room.
“Typical pathology of a stalker,” Violet nodded then shuddered. “Jesus. If Richard was a lunatic, is Jim one as well?”
Her mother, killed in a freak automobile accident. She had lost control of her car.
“Plus we never know when Sherlock will get shot again,” Lestrade quipped but hastily asked “Too soon?” when John shot him a filthy look.
“Tell her we’re going to France to visit Dupin over the holidays,” Sherlock shouted as he stomped back to the kitchen, in a strop now.
“So help me God,” John got right into Mycroft’s face. “That is the last time you threaten my family, do you understand?”
He knew that if the train hadn’t been swaying so goddamn much, if the floor beneath her had been steady, he would have been a dead man. Hunter hadn’t intended to wound him. She was going  for a kill shot.
“But she’s not
“Oh, thank you,” Mary gushed, knowing her role. “Mr. Rucastle surprised us with them. His own designs, aren’t they fabulous?”
“What?”
It was easy to spot the petite brunette beauty, even at night, even in the falling snow. Her companion was a complete contrast to her curvy figure and long, shining hair. All legs and neck, with hair buzzed almost completely off and what remained dyed pink. Huge hoop earrings hung from her earlobes. Her stiletto boots gave her another two inches in height.
The aftermath of the intervention.
“Oh I don’t mind Sherlock,” Mary had chimed in. Surprised, Sherlock turned and lifted his shaggy black brows.
John would be damned if he would be caught blubbering in a restaurant. So it took him a good minute to get himself under control before saying, “I thought you were in withdrawal when I said that.”
Drop a line and let me know how you are.
“I’m sorry, what?”
But Wiggins shook his head. “Gonna text my sponsor, tell him I’m in trouble and have him pick me up. You can stay until he comes… if you like. If you want.”
They did make one quick stop at the post office.
The words cut him.  But there was no time to deal with guilt.
“That’s… that’s not necessary.”
“Obviously,” Sherlock droned, unimpressed. “You still hold him responsible for the death of your partner, Marie Rogêt.”
“Find her.”
“What happened to your sense of urgency, boys? Sally is probably listening to you two and making plans to find a way to defy space, time, physics and logic in order to haunt us for eternity if we let her die. John her feet, Lestrade, the middle, and
“Your brother said you were a pain in the arse,” the intruder finally conceded.
But he had been promoted to VP, so he had to have learned to control himself… right?
“A hacking program Richard Brook designed, he was good with computers. It’s the master hacking system. It’s a master key, designed to unlock any security program.”
“Sorry,” she said, skirting around him.
Mrs. Toller had just entered the foyer to announce Tea was ready. Toller deposited Rucastle’s things into Mrs. Toller’s string-bean arms and went to answer the door.
“Not yet at least,” John scowled; the itch irritatingly just out of his pinkie’s reach.
For those who don't/haven't watched yet... the Tig/Venus arch is another reason to watch and I swear, I didn't spoil very much.  Talk about massive feels though...!
And he hated himself for every second of it, especially when Sherlock started reciprocating.

“Cold.”
Mary hadn’t wanted to cry. She had wanted to scream. She had wanted someone to die.
“No. You’re not.”
The wristwatch had been a gift from her deceased brother Michael.
“Where did you get that?” Violet asked as Mary unlocked the door.
But the bureaucrat had just sing-songed, “Just routine, nothing to worry about. Sign along the dotted line at the bottom of the page, please.”
Susan shrugged, “I was going to leave a letter for Mary.”
Awkwardly, Mary made it into the house, shutting the door with her hip. “How about pea soup with minced pork pies and strawberry tarts?” she called out as she let the rucksack slide of her back one strap at a time, “For supper tonight?”
“Do what?”
But all he had to do was open his wallet and look at the copy of the baby photo that bastard Rucastle had taunted Mary with last summer. Or look at Mary’s thickening waistline and he swallowed his bitter feelings down.
Out of one of the tiny windows, Wiggins had watched Sherlock make his way up the slight hill back towards the house in the weak light of the coming dawn. Then he had drawled, “If I didn’t know better, I’d say he acted like an overprotective boyfriend, he did”
“I wouldn’t expect any less from you,” Mycroft agreed, opening the door. “Until next time, Mrs. Watson,” he nodded and let himself out.
“Hang on,” she had said thickly, struggling to keep her eyelids open, “You’re… a
Alarm bells rang in John’s head again, loud ones this time, “An Australian?”
Then started giggling like schoolboys.
Now Molly wore scrubs and was peeling her blue latex gloves off. Binning the blood-stained gloves, she sighed and tried to stretch her aching back. It had not been a quiet day after all. There had been a multiple vehicle-accident. Molly had been neck-deep in crushed skulls, punctured organs and shattered vertebrae most of the day.
“I hope he told her to bugger off.”
He didn’t have the patience to deal with Mycroft’s constant manipulations and scheming either.
An old argument reared in John’s head…
has a splenic ruptured.
“Why not?” Mr. Holmes asked sharply.
Sherlock shrugged, “Obviously.”
“I wish I could tell her,” Molly crossed her arms, as if she was cold. “She’s so sweet.”
Her pediatrician always expressed concern about Henry’s slight build. Molly had to explain over and over that when Henry wasn’t sleeping properly, he was too tired to nurse properly. When she and Greg figured out Henry had hyperacuity and hyperascusis (thanks to Sherlock’s mother), they started running an electric fan in his nursery at naptime and at night. Once there was white noise, Henry could sleep. Once Henry started sleeping on a regular schedule instead of screaming in fear, Henry also started nursing on a regular schedule.
“Yes?” Sherlock seethed through his teeth.
“Oh,” Bill looked relieved then nervous. “What about the dog?”
Out of revenge.

“A powerful hallucinogen,” Violet interrupted, catching up with Sherlock. Her hand was over her mouth as she watched Sherlock carefully approach Mitton…
Violet’s nostrils flared in irritation. But in a very calm voice, she said, “Baskerville, John.”
“People don’t want my autograph, people want me to solve crimes,” Sherlock said haughtily before he could stop himself. Rucastle’s face darkened, knowing he had been in some way insulted but couldn’t suss out exactly how.
“He’s actually not ignoring you. He’s working a case out of town.”
Sensing the agitation amongst the humans, Gladstone pressed himself against Sherlock’s thigh and began to whine piteously.
“Violet,” Sherlock’s voice was a dark and dangerous thing, making the V, L and T of her name all sharp edges and points.
Granted it had been Moriarty’s league of consulting criminals who had initially stolen Marissa Watson. Mycroft’s people had retrieved her, but what happened after that, no one knew. Mycroft claimed to have been shut out of the loop, due to the mysterious mole in his department that kept leaking information to what was left of Moriarty’s network. All Mycroft was allowed to know and all he was allowed to tell John and Mary was that Marissa was safe.
Enjoy! :^)
Honoré sidled up next to John, pretending to escort him towards the back of the flat. “It’s OK, the upstairs isn’t as bad as down here.”
she debated, unwilling to touch money earned through others’ pain and bloodshed.
A waitress came, told them about tonight’s specials, took their drink orders and left them quickly alone again. She had probably been warned by the hostess.
The scar Jim Moriarty gave her.
“S-s-so y-y-you’re saying w-we should hurry.”
“Thank you,” Clara said in a shuddery voice as John, Mary and Violet re-joined them. “I didn’t think this was a bad neighborhood.”
“No, of course not,” she gave the young man an extra tenner, “For your trouble.”
“Be like the water?” John grinned, taking his coffee out of the cup holder. “Go with the flow.”
He didn’t know the details of what happened to Sherlock when he was a little boy. But he knew enough to utterly despise The Honorable Heathcliff Cullen-Culpepper, the shithead son of the Earl of Winchester. He knew enough to completely lose respect for Mr. and Mrs. Holmes. He knew enough to completely loathe Mycroft Holmes.
Sherlock won, of course
He shook away the humiliating imagery of his rotund younger self wobbling on a bike before wiping out in the gravel driveway. He closed his eyes and massaged his temples instead.
“Does it get easier, this
“You don’t see me sniveling,” he grizzled when she sniffled instead of responding like an adult.
, he wearily admitted to himself as he followed Mrs. Hudson and Sherlock out of 221B. Last night had been draining and he was short on sleep.
Absolute Pin
Her response was a steady snore.
“Somebody took your baby? Shit, lady. Call the coppers, not the Homeless Network.”
And Mycroft was to stop exploiting Sherlock’s genius to further his own political agendas.
Lestrade caught the pen Sherlock tossed at him then complied. “Right, so that narrows down the search a bit,” Lestrade stepped back from the map. “You there, Gregson, was it? Do you know where Miss Smith was last seen before the CCTV feeds cut off?”
“I need you to find Eduardo Lucas. You’ll receive further information at headquarters.”
As the bedsprings of the narrow bed squeaked when Jack sat down, Johnny slowly straightened up and turned around. Jack saw that the boy’s eyes were red but he wasn’t weeping.
Before John could ask though, Sherlock blurted out with his usual lack of tact. “What were you thinking? Before I fully awoke this morning?”
Violet grabbed a pillow, pressed it over her face and bit into it, sure that if she didn’t, she would scream and wake the dog. And Mrs. Hudson. And the neighbors. And everyone in Westminster.
But this was not the first Dupin had been on the receiving end of a dirty look. “
“What do we d-” John started to ask but then found himself slammed into the wall with Sherlock pressing himself close against John.
,” Sherlock snarled.
For nearly forty-five minutes, in the pitch blackness, they stayed silent. Violet’s legs started to ache from climbing all those steep stairs then immediately not moving, but she didn’t complain. She closed her eyes, which was no different from keeping them open. She practiced calming breathing techniques while listening for anything suspicious. The sound of footsteps, someone else’s breathing, the cock of someone else’s gun.
