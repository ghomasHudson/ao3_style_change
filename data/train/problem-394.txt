He was reluctant at first to say more, but with some cajoling he admitted that he’s had a “phantom cat”—a ginger one!—that joins him in the shed some days. He says he knew it wasn’t real, but he sees it in the periphery of his vision, usually on the right side. When he turns to engage it, he remembers it isn’t really there, and it’s not.
“Yes?” Rustle of hands in pockets.
“Sher—” John starts, choking. He steadies himself, shakes his head as if to clear it and fixes Sherlock with stormy eyes, his right hand clenching, unclenching.
It’s over, and any utility he ever had is spent.
Nevermind! Everyone’s body fails in the end! Everyone is degenerating!
“Good, yes,” Sherlock replies, as the boy lifts the frame he’s still holding up and looks more closely at it. There is uncapped larvae, but no eggs. “How long has it been?”
In the end, they’d decided to address the e-mail to Sherlock himself. Make it sound like Dr. Ernest had predicted that something might happen to him.
“I’ve left a ploughman’s in the refrigerator for you, too… and there’s soup in the pot on the hob. Is that my jumper?”
Sherlock arrives at the surgery around 2:45, a little late for having taken a nap on his camp bed after Seth had gone. John’s standing in the vestibule when he arrives, talking to a man Sherlock has seen around town, Josiah Amberley. Amberley’s left hand and arm are wrapped in clean gauze to just below the elbow. Sherlock takes him in: late sixties, grey hair, unkempt and swept back from a high forehead, sparsely bearded. He’s tall, but stooped, and with a downtrodden look. Large hands and feet. A once handsome face, now deeply lined—older than his years—a prominently bridged aquiline nose, square jaw, and deep set, bruised looking sharp grey eyes.
We’ve had a few quiet, tremoring days now, but today Sherlock is looking less drawn and more physically stable. He’s had some rest, and seems to be going back to his familiar ways—up in the early morning, days spent bent over his manuscripts and notebooks in his potting shed, pottering about the hives and garden.
Seth kneels to slide the frame gently back into the box, careful of the bees and their unborn queens. “Do you think they’ll be ok, Mr Holmes?” he asks, looking up.
Sherlock doesn’t reply for a moment, and then he does. “It’s a small town, John. Artist. Retired. Lives on the old hops farm with the Oast kilns at the southern edge of the village. Gay. Much younger lover…”
like a spring blossom,
John flinches. Looks away. His throat works convulsively, mouth twisting.
and its doors forever open.
Amberley had been re-painting the lintels of his studio and archival strong room when I arrived, I told Sherlock. A strange activity, in light of recent events, and strange too that he was using an oil-based paint when there are so many less malodorous, and every bit as durable, acrylic options nowadays. He showed me the strong-room. He’d kept some of his more valuable work in it, along with a shocking amount of cash—he said it was for emergencies—which, along with the paintings, were stolen the night Brent disappeared.
I’m going to start keeping this journal in my office in town. I need to be able to record what happens and what I feel without the concern that Sherlock will read it.
“Mmm,” Sherlock replies. “And the buzz is higher in pitch. Can you hear it?” When the boy nods, Sherlock gestures, “Come round and watch the bees leaving the hive. Do you notice anything?”
“What? Yes. Yes… we… You knew? And you went anyway?”
is different, and will never be the same. Even though it has never not been so, he’s more aware than ever of faring forward in an increasingly faulty vessel, towards an inevitable terminus, and as it is every morning, the idea is painful—a strange dissonance when he is so happy. He thinks of his garden, his bees. John. He thinks how strange it is that love and loss are such inevitable bedfellows, because for this moment, lying in bed with John, still and warm in John's arms, Sherlock feels alive and well, and perfectly normal. Perfectly like himself.
Sherlock had no choice and he says so, his voice cracking. Ridiculous. He turns away as the look in Mycroft’s eyes softens further and veers too close to understanding and pity (and gratitude?) for him to bear.
body and yours, my
And why? Sherlock can find no reason that makes any sense, so it must be that, as always, he is not a detective; he is a contemptible, vain, ridiculous peacock. A drama queen. A broken, rapidly degenerating idiot. Why? Because now John is hours away, stranded in a one pub village with a broken-down car, probably sharing a room with a murderer.
“Mmm,” Sherlock assents, laying his cheek against John’s hair, tightening his arm around John’s shoulders and pulling him closer, “why not?”
“Yes. The queen is the brain of the colony. Under her organising authority the workers act as one to preserve and perpetuate the colony, everything as it should be. Without her, the workers will eventually lose their right sense of purpose, act in ways that hurt the colony, and they will all die. So, what shall we do?” Sherlock prompts.
“Listening?” Seth asks. When Sherlock nods, he goes round the back of the hive and presses his ear to it, intent. After a moment, the boy goes to the next hive and listens there, too, comparing, and then back to the first.
Behind him, the hives are active, buzzing with the incessant labour of their multitudes and headily fragrant in the warmth of the sun: pine, wax, honey and the slight, organic mustiness of fermenting pollen. Sherlock loves it. Loves watching the bees alight and return to their landing platforms, entering the hive heavy, laden with nectar and pollen, and leaving it lightened of their loads by their nursemaid sisters, ready to collect more -- tireless and endlessly fascinating.
“Sherlock.” I said, craning to look up into his evasive face, “what have I got to do or say to make it clear to you that I am exactly where I want to be?”
John knew, but the actual diagnosis still falls like a physical blow.
The neurologist, Dr. Novakova, feels that there is no point in delaying dopaminergic  treatment. Conventional wisdom says it’s best to wait, the better to stave off the inevitable dyskinesia and dystonias that comes with the extended use of levodopa, but newer studies suggest that there is no evidence that using levodopa accelerates Parkinsonian pathology. I’ve done some research as well and can see no credible benefit to waiting. It’s about quality of life. Levodopa has a good chance of significantly reducing his symptoms. That said, I’m not sure how much some of them bother him. He doesn’t let on. But, the sleep disturbances worry me. He doesn’t like to admit it, but he needs his sleep.
“Have you taken your meds? Are you ok?”
Six months after his diagnosis, Sherlock wakes early on a cold December morning, curled up at the edge of the bed, a bit cold. John is snoring softly—on his back then—behind him. They often drift apart in the night. It used to bother Sherlock that they didn’t wake up as they went to sleep—pressed against each other—but it doesn’t anymore. He knows John is there, warm and willing, and just a touch away.
surrender. Who are
“You obviously want me to ask. So, come on. Tell me,” he snapped, snappishly.
At that, Seth had brightened up, and to be perfectly truthful with himself, Sherlock had felt… relieved. Heartened. It had been… pleasant to have someone to… perform to. To be admired by someone who… Wasn’t John? Was John’s admiration so cheap? Did John even admire him anymore? How could Seth’s ignorant hero worship be more desirable? And, why was Sherlock asking himself these confounded, ridiculous questions? Is this what he had become?
John’s expression softens at this. He turns to watch Seth as he crosses the garden.
“I suspected not” he replied.
So, yes. Sherlock has stopped wearing gloves or protective clothing when managing his hives. As a result, he is stung several times a day and comes into the house with bees up his sleeves and red marks all over his hands and arms, and is just thrilled with himself about it. My new full time job is tweezing stingers out of his skin!
A day in the garden, a diagnosis, a coda. All is well.
So, in short, he’s as usual. He keeps himself busy. Big plans for the back half acre, and hours of business everyday in his potting shed. He reads a lot. In the evenings, he sits with me in my study half listening to me go on about the stars, half in his own world, or we watch telly together, me wedged into the corner of the sofa and him draped over the rest of it, his head or feet in my lap. He’s been warm and affectionate. I’m happy to report that after an initial slow-down following his diagnosis, our sex life is much as it has ever been, since we fell into being quiet old codgers in the countryside who sometimes feel their age. That is to say, perfectly satisfying, if less fevered and frequent than it once was.
I was worried, and relieved when he said he wanted to have a nap.
Midsummer.
“Stop there,” I told him, “because it’s all rubbish, and frankly, it’s insulting. I chose you, and I am here because I can’t imagine being anywhere else. I chose you, and I don’t care how you age, or what happens. Everyone does, Sherlock. The universe is made of black holes and dark matter. Black holes are the architects of the universe. They birth stars. They create galaxies.”
“And Bucharest?”
“Yes.” Sherlock gestures towards three heavy rolls of black plastic sheeting. He’s got plans to kill off the grass in their back half acre and plant perennial meadow flowers—perfect for the chalky soil, better for the bees. The first step is stopping the sunlight reaching the ground to stop the lawn growing. In the early Spring he’ll cut what’s left as close to the ground as he can and seed—
Mycroft’s chin tucks down, as he raises a wry eyebrow and ever so slightly grimaces. He doesn’t reply, but Sherlock sees his answer in the way his eyes look suddenly glassier, and turns back to face the wall again, relieved.
The boy has shot up in the past few months, and at 16 is not quite as tall as Sherlock once was, which is to say, he is as tall as Sherlock is now. His long, bony limbs are comically coltish and awkward in his bee suit and red trainers. He carries his veiled hat at his side, his ginger hair shaggy and unkempt.
I’d say I’m too old for this, but I’m absolutely not—though I am feeling it this morning.
Sherlock doesn’t know how much time has passed, but his certainty that Mycroft will comply is eroding by the hour, and the doubt in his mind is compulsive, like an itch that he can’t stop scratching until it’s raw and bleeding. Worse, he finds that Mycroft’s compliance isn’t the greatest of his anxieties, John’s is.
“I’m going in to the surgery for a few hours. You alright?” he asks, answering Sherlock’s smile with his own, kissing him lightly and picking up yesterday’s dirty dishes from the workbench, his eyes warm. “Need anything?”
It had been comforting, then, to remember that Seth was just behind him, unnaturally silent. The boy was practically holding his breath.
The buzzing in Sherlock’s nerves is louder now, a constant low-end sinister hum, his left hand and arm, pinned under his pillow, are alive with it. Lately, he’s been dreaming of himself, warping impossibly in ways that he can't describe on awakening. Strange, horrible dreams in which he has become nothing but a litany of bizarre symptoms—bent, his limbs twisting and contorted, unable to move or speak, unable to trust his own perceptions, alone in rooms full of phantoms, terrified. Alone.
The other Oast tower, though, had been bricked closed from inside the house, and there appeared to be no way in. They went outside and found the exterior, with no immediately visible entryway and surrounded by more tangled, overgrown hawthorn. It had looked impassable, but out of the corner of his eye, Sherlock had seen a cat. His cat. Ginger and white, slender and wending its way along the hedge. Sherlock had known—knows!—it's not real; just a figment of his pathology, a sign that his mind could no longer to be trusted to communicate fact to his brain, but he had unthinkingly turned to follow it when it disappeared  into narrow gap. After struggling through the tangled vegetation, they'd found a low, rusted, steel door, it's handle smoothed by signs of recent use. Ducking Inside, they’d found what could only be Brent and Doctor Ernest’s charred remains in the plenum.
He catches John’s eyes with his own and nods, confirming, “Good.”
Sherlock says nothing, and John continues.
Sherlock has a case, a lot of anxiety, and a saving grace.
“No.” Sherlock says.
I squeezed his hand and went into the house. Left him there in the drive to contemplate his winter blooms.
We’re both as happy and well as can be expected, for the most part.
“And, I don’t see the queen.” Seth looks up, brow furrowed, lifting the last frame. “Oh! Mr. Holmes! Look at this!” The boy is pointing to a small cluster of large, open cups at the edge of the frame. Queen cells.
Mycroft releases a long, slow breath, but all he says is “Get dressed, Sherlock. We need to talk.”
Perhaps I’ll get a dog?
It’s certain now: Sherlock has Parkinson’s. He’s just had the news yesterday. I’ve suspected as much for some time now, but I’d hoped I was wrong. It’s just that so many of the things that make Sherlock Sherlock are also potential symptoms, and he’s always been—unusual. I just wonder how long ago I might have been able to catch it if I’d really been paying attention.
Perfection!
Some 28 hours after leading John to bed, Sherlock finds himself there again, this time tremulous and stiff, wakeful and restless, cold, wracked with fears and misgivings, and… alone. Alone in their bed for the first time in… Years? Could it be years?
me together is
His face was expressionless, but his eyes were wet, blinking.
It’s strange, isn’t it? That Sherlock and I should have lived together for more than two decades, that we should have been so intimate in every possible way for so long, know each other as deeply as we do, and yet he is still so opaque to me in some ways.
Last night, he asked if he disgusted me. What a ridiculous question. Sherlock asking me that is—unbearable. I don’t know how he could imagine that. After all this time.
So, we have a case.
We’ve had the best harvest of honey in all the time we’ve been here. Sherlock managed most of it on his own, with help from Seth Benson when he can come after school. Seth’s always been fascinated by the bees and he’s always got on well with Sherlock. It’s lovely seeing them together in the garden, and Seth is really remarkable for a boy his age—he seems to actually enjoy the time he spends here with a cranky old codger—and though Sherlock will never admit it, he enjoys the company of children.
He should have known. He’d been wrong about Magnussen’s dead eyes, too. Was it really so impossible that someone else was as good at being a walking mnemonic device as he is? Sherlock knows now that he has been so driven by emotion and so helplessly reactive, that he’s finally made the perfect storm of fatal errors that will cost him everything. Such a cliché. Magnussen is dead, Mycroft’s hands are tied, and Sherlock still has nothing but his suspicions about Mary.
“Sherlock, I know what you did. I think I understand why you did it.”
John knew. And, he knows what it means: the slow depletion of dopaminergic neurons in Sherlock’s substantia nigra has reached the critical point when symptoms emerge. Now, the attrition will continue, bringing with it increasing and multiplying tremor; gradual and escalating loss of muscular control; the slow loss of Sherlock’s beautiful, upright posture, difficulties with gait and balance; loss of affect and expression; difficulties speaking and swallowing; disturbances in sleep; changes and difficulties with spatial and temporal perception; depression, possible delusions and hallucinations; and in the worst cases, cognitive impairment, dementia, and an inexorable decline until death.The disease is manageable but degenerative, and there is no cure. It’s a life sentence.
Sherlock seems to have taken it—really, I don’t know how. He’s unemotional. I wonder how much of his mask-like expression is a symptom of the illness, and how much of it is just him acting like himself. Like nothing touches him. I’m trying to keep my emotions to myself. This isn’t about me. But, if there’s anything I’ve learned from being with Sherlock, it’s that loving another person means being vulnerable to pain and loss, and I can’t deny that I feel both.
Sherlock looks up after him as he heads back across the garden.
In the end, Sherlock had decided that it didn’t matter what Mary was; her child—John’s child—had to be protected. Mary had to be protected. Protecting Mary was protecting John.
He never told me that.
A case!
There were some rough days with the side effects, and he still has some shaky moments if he forgets to take his pills on time, but Sherlock seems well now. He seems more like himself again. He’s sleeping better most nights, and good sleep means better days. Mornings are a bit slow and shaky, but he’s alright once he gets going.
Predictably, the NHS does not cover such things.
“You’ve read John’s blog, haven’t you.”
I was worried that he might succumb to depression, but after some downtrodden weeks, he seems to be letting me do all the worrying. He rarely talks about any of it (except the bees!) without being asked, and he seems wholly unemotional about it all. He behaves normally—tending the garden and the hives. To keep his voice limber, he’s been reading to me at night (his idea) mostly historical beekeeping manuals (his preference) or true crime books (mine!), the latter of which he generously peppers with withering disdain for their authors. His voice is stronger now with the medication, and God knows I’ve always had a soft spot for his withering disdain.
“There’re a lot of pollen stores… and honey stores…” Seth observes, “...in the deep hive body? Is that right, Mr Holmes?”
But, there’s nothing for it but to get on with what must be.
So, Sherlock and Seth had found a pub—a little grimy, maybe, but suitable—and made a plan: a faked email from the doctor in Bells Yew Green—just far enough away!—writing to say that he had in his possession a sealed a letter for Amberley from Dr. Ernest, and then a bit of sabotage. Amberley would bring the letter to show John and him, and Sherlock would insist he and John go in person to investigate.
blood, to show us the
“Nap.” Sherlock replies.
John turns back to face down the path, and they walk on for awhile in silence, hand in hand. Their breath rising frosty in the cold air.
I turned to look at him. Held my tongue. Let him finish.
When he was diagnosed, Sherlock had felt numbly bewildered. Betrayed by his own flesh. Now, he feels prickly and over-sensitive, like a waking limb—it’s become familiar, but it’s not boring. He’s spent the latter part of the summer and the autumn acclimating to the drugs, the way John watches him, the way other people watch him, the relentless fatigue. Finally, having gained a measure of control over it with the help of the drugs, he’s begun to fall back into a rhythm of his own, changed now, but not unpleasant—his garden, his bees, walks with John, quiet evenings in the garret, listening to John map the stars. The thing he misses is his violin. The tremor and stiffness have made his playing less fluid. Less satisfying. He hasn’t played in months.
Almost.
John’s smile is warmer. “Oh, Sherl— I was just wondering…”
Sherlock raises his eyes to John’s—pale and colourless in the nighttime light of their cosy sitting room, pale and raw—and acquiesces.
He does it later that night.
“Get me some morphine.”
At first, I was very taken aback and worried, but Sherlock rightly reminded me that hallucinations are a common side-effect of dopaminergic treatment. He’s not wrong, and though it seems he is ahead of the curve in terms of having them quite early in his treatment, it’s not unheard of. A bit of reading confirms that it’s estimated that as many as 40% of Parkinsonian patients on dopaminergic treatment have them, and that they may actually be under-reported by patients, who fear the ramifications of admitting them.
“But John,” he paused, “I feel like…” he shook his head, as if unwilling to go on, and then did: “After everything… I sometimes worry that… I… It’s...”
Instead, Sherlock invokes the unspoken, and lets it hang in the air between them. He  knows that the words will only make the loss and uncertainty of this parting too raw and too immediate. Even so, it’s soothing to acknowledge them in their absence—to make their absence manifest and let it breathe. He wonders if John can hear them. Sherlock presses his lips together and watches John look everywhere but at him, while he can’t look away. He knows his face is betraying him, and there’s nothing he can do to keep what he feels from welling up in his eyes and writing itself on his skin, and Sherlock feels like his heart is an acrobat. Like it's twisting itself into contorted, impossible shapes, stretching and twisting him to the limit of his endurance. He knows John has things locked inside and twisting, too. Their mutual silence steadies them both, and the ballast of what they won’t say binds them to an equilibrium of weighted stasis. The fear that their balance comes at a cost they can no longer afford—the fear that this really is goodbye, threatens to overwhelm him.
“They do,” I told him.
That night, Sherlock goes to bed early. He’s tired and a little stiff. He’s finally learnt that the more rested he is, the better he sleeps, and the better he sleeps, the better his days are. His body is less cooperative when he’s fatigued. He strips off his clothes, drapes them over the chair in the corner of the room and gets into bed, listening to John puttering about in the kitchen, clearing up the last of the day’s detritus, putting on the dishwasher, taking out the rubbish.
“What’s going to happen to you?”
Next week they’ll apply mite treatments to the hives and feed the bees up for the winter.
"Oh, and also! Remember the tall man I met outside? Well, as I was turning into our gate, I saw him again in the lane! I’m sure he was following me!"
Our neighbours, the Bensons, have offered their son Seth to help out with the garden. He’s 14 now, and a keen gardener already—an extraordinary boy. Maybe he can help keep things up while Sherlock adjusts. He’s on his summer hols, and I’ve offered to pay him a bit. He’s thrilled. Sherlock has always liked the boy. I spoke to Sherlock about it, and he seemed—pleased?
“Seth?” John asks.
John is thoughtful. Finally: “You’re perfectly right, of course. About everything. His lover did leave him—just last night. He suspects Dr. Ernest. They played chess together—he and Amberley.”
The boy’s imagination was lurid, but he was right. The man was a killer.
He’s been to the clinic in town—yes, the one I work in, and on my DAY OFF, no less! I can’t leave him alone for a second!—to demand injections and/or acupuncture treatments with bee venom.
There was a safe, open, in the far wall. Empty. Sherlock noticed some scuffs on the floor and on the wainscoting—black rubber—as if something had been dragged through the door. Or someone.
I was a bit… I’m almost ashamed to admit it now, but I was angry. Why would he do this to himself? If I’m honest, I felt like he had done it to me, so we could both suffer. So selfish and idiotic. I’m sorry to say I let him see it. Without speaking and with little kindness, I gave him a dispersible tablet, a cup of tea and some toast and sat opposite him in my chair. I was loathe to throw him a bone, and I thought it might be more effective to appear disinterested. Let him ask me. I opened the paper and played hard-to-get while he recovered from a long day of not taking care of himself.
“Well, bent, really. Burdened.” I replied. “And, out of breath, like he’d been carrying a heavy load.”
Sherlock doesn’t know what to do. He wants to stroke John’s cheek, and comfort him—turn John’s face up and kiss him, and he can’t. He wants to tell John all of his suspicions and all of the truth, and he can’t. He wants to be comforted and loved, but John can’t. He swallows back his ridiculous urge to sob, and they stand like that for a period of time Sherlock doesn’t want to reckon. John’s clean, soapy smell and his warmth fill Sherlock’s head, and the texture of his hair is softer than Sherlock ever imagined it could be.
“Sherlock?” He manages. It’s a question. John doesn’t look like he expects an answer.
In the morning, we headed back, Amberley trying unsuccessfully to mask his ever mounting apprehension, me hoping my nonchalance was holding up convincingly. The journey home may have been fraught with fear and anger, but what I’ll never forget was the look on Amberley’s face when we got back to Haven Farm, and Sherlock asked him point blank where he’d hidden the bodies—it was twisted and nearly demonic; the look of a terrible, cornered beast. Of course, Sherlock already knew the bodies were in the plenum, but he couldn’t tell the police he’d (illegally) searched the farm (with Seth! My God). Accused and obviously guilty, Amberley went so far as to try to poison himself, but Sherlock sprang on him—with such agility! Amazing!—and knocked the capsules from his hand. Pentobarbital. God knows where he got it.
Sherlock looks down at his sleeping partner. John’s forehead is now pressed against his naked left hip, his breath warm and humid against Sherlock’s flank, and Sherlock remembers another thing. He loves this time of day. Loves the quiet, solitary morning, when his emotion towards John can simply be, without an audience, and without the pressure of expression. He runs the fingers of his steadier left hand through soft, silvering hair at John’s temple, feels the pulse there—feels grateful. Sherlock likes being alone, and while John’s incoherent, sleepy mumble and the huff of his breath against Sherlock’s skin makes him feel loved, raises gooseflesh and the familiar warming throb of vascular sexual response, it demands nothing of him in return.  Sherlock smiles down at John and then, sobers. John who has never been lucky in his choice of companionship. John who must now watch him degenerate.
The only real loss, it appears, is his music. He hasn’t played the violin in months, at least not when I’ve been in the house. And, sometimes his higher spirits. He’s still a bit blank and can seem… oh, I don’t know… a bit fatalistic sometimes. I don’t think he’s terribly depressed—he’s busy, engaged in his projects and active—perhaps it’s the Parkinson’s that makes his face so emotionless sometimes. Still, his refusal of this case is something I can’t help but see as a kind of disturbing resignation.
After a moment, muffled by the duvet, Sherlock murmurs, “How can you want me now, John? I’ll only get worse. It’s…” after a pause, “...disgusting.”
Sherlock’s been well lately, all things considered. He’s eating a bit more, and he’s been in good spirits. He plays it all very close to the vest, but I think he’s come to terms with things as they are and seems to have it all well in hand. He’s deep into his own personal clinical trial with his bee venom therapy, and I have to admit, there does seem to be something to it. He’s been able to reduce his dosage of Carpidopa/Levodopa just a bit, to no ill effect, and has plans to reduce it further. I’m eager to see what happens, and less afraid of setbacks. Weirdly, I think setbacks would interest him as much as success, and that’s… fine, I guess. What he needs most is to be… engaged.
As he hadn’t driven since the diagnosis, Sherlock had decided that the bus was best. Anyway, he fancied a walk. Sometimes the forward motion helped him; kept him moving forward. Inertia. He set a brisk pace. It was cold, and the power of his meds was fresh in his veins. The boy could keep up. He’d caught the 7:15 to Eastbourne.
Sherlock pulls his duvet tighter around his shoulders, and lifts his cold feet to wrap them in the ends of the duvet. Huddled tightly there, drifting. Seeing John’s face in his mind, imagining the pub in Bells Yew Green—grim, tatty wallpaper and threadbare carpets. Was he sharing a room with Amberley? The thought chills him.
Sherlock’s right hand, hanging at his side, is alive -- the fingers tapping their own rhythm against the palm -- and ignored. There’s a slight stoop in his shoulders, but his eyes are keen and bright. It’s one year since his diagnosis. Since he learned that his mind and body were finally truly diverging, this time without his intending it. Sherlock knows that for today it’s something he can only just control, and he’s at peace with that. For now. He has other, more engaging concerns.
Sherlock smiles faintly back, and turns back to his task. He’s preparing the ground for a new Anemone Hupehensis—a gift from John. It’s got two newly opened, bowl-shaped, deep pink flowers, with luminous yellow starbursts of pollen-heavy anther held aloft atop tall stalks with dark green maple-like leaves, and many more unopened buds. Male and female flowers on the same plant. Lovely. Perfect for the bees.  He buries his spade in the damp earth, breaking up the clumps with the edge and mixing in handfuls of peat—Anemones like acidic soil—before lowering the roots into place, patting the topsoil down around it, and straightening to sit back and examine his work.
In the end, Amberley confessed everything.
If I were still blogging, I might call it “The Adventure of the Retired Colourman” (to Sherlock’s inevitable, deeply felt, and unmistakably expressed chagrin). The whole thing was over before it began. Sherlock solved it almost effortlessly, and in less than a day.
My other fear is that he (we?) won’t know his Parkinsonian symptoms from any other garden variety ache and pain of the aged, which we are rapidly becoming. I worry that he will become anxious watching his body (or that I will), seeing pathology in everything. Part of me wonders if I’m being selfish pushing him towards immediate medication because it’s hard for me to see him like this, and it doesn’t make me feel any better that Sherlock seems to be abdicating. He says only a fool argues with his doctor.
Amberley and Brent had spent that afternoon in the pub, in the company of Dr Ernest— Sherlock knows him—the young doctor who works with me at the local surgery on Mondays and Wednesdays. Brent struck up the friendship with him, apparently. Ernest and Amberley were both keen chess players, but Amberley thinks it was all just a cover for the affair Brent and Ernest were having under his nose. That evening, Amberley and Brent had tickets to see the panto in Eastbourne at the old theatre. He showed me the tickets—but Brent complained of a migraine, and decided to stay home at the last minute.
I haven’t been keeping this diary up as much as I’d like to, but it’s probably because things have been good.
He rubs his cheek into the damp spot in the mattress and wonders idly if the person who was held here before him cried, too.
He turns those eyes appraisingly on Sherlock when he comes in, and smiles in a tight, perfunctory way.
“Sherlock, my life is with you. And, really,” I added, “there has never been any question that you are indeed something of a singularity, and that I never had a chance of escaping you. I fell into your event horizon the moment I met you at Bart’s. There is nothing different about that now— with your Parkinson’s.”
I woke up early, but he was earlier still. I looked out into the garden to see his potting shed dark, and in the kitchen, I found a half finished cup of tea, as well as the undeniable evidence of a soft-boiled egg and toast.
with hopes of staying,
Or, actually, at the moment, it might be more accurate to say that I have one. Sherlock thinks himself unequal to the challenge and refuses to admit that he’s interested. I know better on both counts. The fact that he’s sent me to look into it—and not only that, told me where to start!—gives him away. I’m looking forward to seeing how long he can hold out before taking over, as imperiously as ever.
nothing else.
, little brother,” Mycroft returns softly, as one of his nameless minions comes in behind him with Sherlock’s clothes, cleaned and pressed.
“Mm,” Sherlock replies neutrally, his commitment to eating unclear. He doesn’t look up. John leans in to kiss him again, exasperated but fond.
into a season
But, rattling along on the bus, he’d been mercifully focused on more mundane anxieties. He’d wondered if he’d brought enough pills to get him through the day with a scrap of his dignity intact. He’d wondered if his shaking and stooping and freezing would make him look feeble, or if people who saw him would be disgusted by it, and pity him. He’d concluded that of course they would, and that after all, he WAS feeble.
“Salvageable,” Sherlock answers, “but, in danger.”
Could he enlist the boy as an assistant? Was it right to involve the child? Maybe not. But, if he followed…? Sherlock had resolved to confront and recruit him. He had wanted someone to... accompany him. And, it couldn’t be John. He didn’t want John along. Not this time. This one he needed to solve on his own. Prove he still could.
While he slept, I rang Dr. Novakova, who reminded me that depression is now thought to be part of Parkinsonian pathology. I told her about the case and the events of the past few days. It was clear to us both that it was probably a hangover, really, from all the action. We agreed that I should call her again if he didn’t snap out of it in the next week or so.
And I to him, it seems.
insistent. How wise is our
Sherlock knows what he owes John. He knows that John has been through too much. He rolls over on his bare bunk to face the polished concrete wall.
He rolled his eyes and glared, and at last I relented and told him my tale.
Needless to say, there were early signs that this idyllic quiet country life did not suit a young scenester with Brent’s appetites for stimulation of all kinds. Amberley stubbornly refused to acknowledge Brent’s boredom, which he saw as “black ingratitude”, and did little to allay his discontent. They often argued about money; Amberley says he felt like a cash machine and Brent, he says, complained of being trapped.
Sherlock  turns and squares his shoulders. Manages to lift his chin to look Mycroft in the eye and stop himself from quavering. His face says that he will brook no argument, but he feels like he’s just written a cheque he can’t cash.
—is palpable. Once they’ve got to the edge of the town and turned down off the road towards the wood, he turns to Sherlock.
“Yes, yes.” Sherlock pressed, growing ever more impatient with every word of description. “What did he say?”
nature, our bodies
It’s been three months to the day since Sherlock was diagnosed, and I think we’re finally getting somewhere with the drugs. It took some time to find the right dosage. He takes one dispersible tablet (for quick absorption) in the morning (carbidopa-levodopa 25/100), two more capsules at 6 hour intervals during the day, and then a controlled release tablet overnight. He’s got some lower dose tablets as well, in case he has an especially long day or needs a top up, but he refuses to consider them.
“Oh?” John asks. He frowns, and the line between his eyebrows deepens. He’s holding the plate like a butler, but sets the cup of tea down on top of the hive. Attentive.
“It’s Parkinson's, Mr. Holmes.”
“Goodbye, John,” he whispers into the silence.
He lets John go when he feels the tightness drain from his muscles and the worst of it is over, and goes back to sit heavily on his bunk. John scrubs a hand over his face. After a moment, he follows and sits next to Sherlock, his head in his hands. For a moment, they just exist, side by side. Then, John sits up, inhales deeply and lays his hand over Sherlock’s, and says, very gently:
Sherlock and Seth had made a good team. They’d made short work of the so-called alibi. The Eastbourne amateur theatrical society had photographs of the theatre on the evening Amberley claimed to have been there, and there was no sign of him. There’d been a woman and a teenaged girl in the seats that matched his tickets. They knew her at the theatre—a regular attendee and sometime participant. Sherlock had sent Seth to speak to her, and the boy soon returned to confirm that she’d been there to watch her neighbour’s performance, and had only taken Amberley’s seats when it had become clear the real ticket holder wasn’t going to turn up.
Molly came over in the afternoon, and Sherlock and her were sitting on the sofa watching Felix playing on the floor as I got on with a piece of homework sitting on my bed. We had been back at school for over a week now, with surprisingly very few things going wrong surrounding the concealment of Felix. There had been a few close calls with people in the corridors, but that was it.
"He is the son of two (now) deceased secret service officers who informed nobody of his existence but a select few, meaning that he is not on the records and officially does not exist. The father was on leave when he was shot this afternoon, but no doubt felt a moral obligation towards continuing with the case he was currently working on. The boy is 4 months old, we have no information on his whereabouts for his lifetime, but at birth he was completely healthy, he hasn't been checked since, so his health is unknown at this point."
"Mmm... yes."
29th January
Standing up suddenly, and feeling overwhelming claustrophobia come over me, I grabbed my work and a pen and I headed for the door.
"Did you hear me?"
"Doesn't mean he has to dress like one."
"Yes. Will you?" Sherlock queried impatiently.
Please Comment if you've enjoyed it, or any sort of feedback really!! :) Thankyou!!
“He likes tea.”
"In your opinion! Well what do you propose we read him then?"
"No! No don't worry it's fine! I will find my dorm and come over to yours when I have dumped my stuff..."
His face lit up, like a child on christmas morning, and he darted off to the sofa, swiftly moving items off it.
Once they finally got to the shopping centre, as they walked through the main square, John started to notice that people were staring at them. They had come a fairly quiet route to get to the centre, and there hadn’t been many people who paid attention to them on the street, but here... Everyone did.
“Yes. I obviously didn’t know that.” Sherlock answered, observing an overly-intimate couple farther away. It was a very clumsy mistake of him to leave scars displayed on his face, inviting unnecessary inquiries. Well, of course, no one would inquire. Except John.
“Oh, John-The gun-
The door opened slowly with John standing there momentarily before crashing down to the floor on his knees, the black gun loosely clutched in-between rough fingers. He covered his face with his other hand and cried violently, just how Sherlock had last seen him at the bar.
Everything was over.
He laid his head on the mattress, his hair messily tousled as he clutched John’s hand and held it tightly to his lips, whispering whatever he could. Occasionally, rivers of emotion would tickle his cheeks as they rolled down, but he couldn’t find energy in him to wipe them away. His limbs gave off a dull ache and his eyelids were struggling to keep itself open.
But now he was no more. Who’d come to save him?
But the voice had drowned in the cacophony of a raging thunderstorm and speedily running water. His eyes flew open to find himself turning the corners of a darkened alley which he recognized immediately as a shortcut to his previous residence: 221B Baker Street.
It was one of those moments when Sherlock would catch John in his gaze and he would find himself loosing equilibrium in the bottomless depths of blue and grey and he would look away, trying to snap out of the trance. But it was Sherlock who looked away this time, exhaling slowly as if he’d been holding his breath for too long. He stared down at his feet.
The voices murmured.
He withdrew his hands and marched swiftly out of the double doors of the pub before he let a tear escape. He thought he heard something.
“Sherlock!” The elderly woman almost screamed from the other side of the hall. When Sherlock rushed to her, she had tears flowing down her face and fear was evident in her eyes.
Twice.
“Please don’t leave.” But Sherlock hadn’t turned back.
“Well, I should be going then.” Sherlock stood up. His lower lip gave a quiver of its own. He gazed down at the shorter man and saw tears dropping to his trousers as he clenched his face in his hands. He reached out to touch John’s shoulders, but stopped. His eyes suddenly left glassy and blood rushed to his face.
Sherlock stopped midway in his path, his smile gone from his features. He started running towards the entrance of his former residence. He stumbled into the space and the acquainted sight and smells rushed through his nostrils; the distinct smell of tea and sweet biscuits along with fruity cakes. He hurried up the stairs within a split second.
Yet not alive. He couldn’t hear, see, or speak. His eyelids would always cover the serene, loving gaze. His pleasantly gruff voice would never be heard from again.
“…A miracle…just for me.” Sherlock started, sniffing breathlessly. Was he asking too much? He let out a few laughs as he imagined the bandaged blunder of John’s face break into a goofy smile.
To run his hand through John’s hair, just like how’d he’d imagined.
Sherlock always knew exactly how to bring John’s smile back. John always knew exactly how to save him in the darkest of times.
Regret was probably one of them. Guilt, too.
“We’ve tried but-umm-he hasn’t been responding-“
But, an event such as this, so inconsequential and insignificant to the rest of the world, was enough the leave loved ones in a state of despair and helplessness and grief, unknown to only those who haven’t witnessed the power and effect of Death on the common man.
“John, please.” Sherlock pleaded. There was silence on the other side. Mrs. Hudson let out a loud sob. “Please open the door.”
(See the end of the chapter for
These events weren’t important to the public and it would probably never make it to the public’s awareness on newspaper articles unless their existence held a degree of significance because, after all, they were common occurrences, happening all around us whether we acknowledge it or not.
Sherlock kissed the rigid, inanimate hands within his own, with quaking lips. He kissed it over and over again, entwining their fingers.
Sherlock didn’t need to hear the rest. He ran into the hallway ahead.
But him? In a pub?
John was limp and weak in Sherlock’s embrace as he grabbed a handful of Sherlock’s wet coat to pull the taller man nearer. “Sh-Sherlock, I love you, too.”
“No, John. You’re mistake-“
Sherlock covered his trembling lips with sweaty palms, shoulders shaking, as he squinted his tears away trying to recognize the blurry faces that peered at him.
The cardiograph was lying.
Sherlock pressed his face to their interlaced fingers and cried out, again.
He thought of his gun. Only his gun could free him.
Had it been mercy or had it been retribution? Would John ever forgive him?
However, not all the darker things were dramatic. Sometimes all it took was being beside someone you loved and cherished as they breathed their last to bring your world crashing down in heartbreak and loss, incapable of being put into words.
“Please don’t be…dead.” He finished, voice breaking.
Sherlock’s throat hurt. What was happening?
He couldn’t bring himself to go back to 221B Baker Street anymore, after Mrs.Hudson left. The place where all his old memories resided, felt desolate and empty, almost dead, just like his heart, whenever he passed by or back when he visited. Even his military trained demeanour wavered.
The sobs were muffled. “No, Sherlock. All this…It was because of me. I’ve lost my chances and made so many…mistakes. I was always untrue to myself and yet-” John wept, pausing to gasp for breath. “I just can’t anymore-“
He started out with a slow chuckle, then the tears came out, like a bursting dam, making his lips tremble. His heart felt shredded to pieces like never before, not losing one ounce of its pain. His form shook as he covered his face with his palm, his very character crumbling within him. The tears were unceasing. Unmerciful.
The eyes followed him, not batting an eyelash.
Sherlock curled his palms around John’s hands, sobbing uncontrollably. He gently placed his forehead on it and sobbed, his tears mixing with the sweat of his palms. His form an ungraceful heap on the cold, unwelcoming tiles of the hospital.
Harry collapsed into a chair at the table, she started to eat the food which was in front of her.
How swiftly everything had changed. He almost didn't believe what had just happened. He looked around at the park but there was nobody there anymore. John had a feeling that they must have left before the shooting or else they would have heard some screams from the overprotective mothers, whose overprotectiveness didn't seems so ridiculous to John anymore.
"Just as a temporary measure! To help us out." John added worriedly.
"Oh that will be Harry, get the door would you John." His mother asked.
"It amazes me you can play the violin so beautifully and find a zip difficult to do up!... Oh, it doesn't matter! Just leave the zip, we've got to go!" John continued, gesturing with one hand for Sherlock to follow him as he walked into the corridor, and along it to the top of the stairs.
Aww bad luck! :(
“What, are we going to do about the child?” John whispered to Sherlock, not trusting his voice to get any louder.
“I was… afraid. I was afraid I was… like Amberley. Twisted. Holding on to y-... My illness, like… a... a black hole. I had to solve it on my own to prove... I was afraid of... losing you, I think.” he said inarticulately, looking down further and frowning.
“And John?”
But if he loves John, he must do this. This is the only thing he can do.
“That was quite rude, wasn’t it? Do you know Mr. Amberley?”
“I do.” Sherlock looks at Seth, pleased, and almost feels like ruffling his hair. “They’ll be fine. They’ll get through this.”
“Good?” John asks, his voice tight. Sherlock opens his eyes. It’s not always easy for John, he knows.
“Help you shall, Seth,” he’d said after a moment, as kindly as he could. “I’m for Eastbourne to check Amberley’s alibi. I’ll need someone… for the legwork.”
Sherlock is bent nearly double, his ear to the back of the troubled hive, when John comes across the lawn, a bacon sandwich on a plate in one hand, and a mug of tea in the other, smiling in greeting, his silvery hair ruffling in the breeze. After years of practice, he has overcome his wariness of the hives. The bees are docile when unthreatened, and John has learned not to react to them. He holds out the plate to Sherlock, who picks up the sandwich and takes a bite without comment.
The hawthorn hedge was just as John described it—gloomy, neglected, overgrown. The garden was wild and weedy, shamefully uncared for, and the house—a converted red-brick barn with two rounded kiln towers at the far end—was indeed a wonderful example of regional architecture, though ramshackle and disintegrating.
Leaning back, his hands on his thighs, Sherlock is distracted suddenly by the index finger on his right hand, which will not stay still, but trembles and jumps out of phase with the rest of him. He is at peace, but his finger is…not. There’s a difficult-to-account-for feeling of fizzing numbness in the arm. It’s not the first time. Sherlock is aware, suddenly, that (as before) he cannot control it. The finger will not be stilled, and his arm feels weak and immobile. He feels... unnerved. He watches it dance and jerk for a moment, his face blank. He feels dismay. The loss of control disgusts him. He tries to make a fist and finds that he can’t, so using his left hand, he folds the right one into a fist and squeezes it, hard and tight, knuckles white, and wills the involuntary movement to stop. After a moment, it seems to. He holds the hand out and flexes his fingers. He lets out a long breath. It’s better. He puts it from his mind. Delete it. It’s nothing.
Seth, on the other hand, had been beside himself. He’d paced excitedly, his long arms and legs charged with colt-like, ungainly energy. “What next?” he’d urged, punctuating his excitement with sharp elbows, hands on hips. “Where to now? Is Mr. Amberley the killer? Mr. Holmes, is he? Should we call the police?” He’d been jumping out of his own skin, his eyes shining and avid. Just a boy… just a boy. So much energy!
Nervous exhaustion, I think. It always was his way to collapse a bit after a case.
“Oh, I know
Mycroft is hatefully prim and self-contained. Tweed, brushed cotton and silk twill, buttoned up just so. He’s out of place in the squalid minimalism of the cell, but looking for all the world at his perfect ease. There’s the slightest hint of a gloating sneer around his mouth, but it doesn’t reach his eyes. His eyes are not sneering at all.
John presses Sherlock for details. Sherlock knows it’s not nothing, but he’s singularly unable (or unwilling?) to remember, or to deduce himself. He’s afraid. John sees Sherlock’s fear and wonders if it’s a cowardice of his own that he doesn’t want to be the doctor here. He doesn’t want to be the one to diagnose Sherlock. He wants to be a partner, equally powerless and frightened. He wants his fair share in the devastation. He withholds his suspicions and takes Sherlock to see a colleague at the local surgery where John still sees patients as a GP two mornings per week.
Dr.  Novakova told us, when all this began, that with the proper management—medication, exercise, diet—Sherlock has many good years to look forward to. Even though I’m a doctor, and intellectually I knew she was right, I’m not sure either of us really believed her. But, after these past few months getting to grips with it, I’m starting to. Starting to feel lighter.
“No,” Sherlock answers, accepting the tea, brushing cool, white fingers over John’s warm ones. John puts the toast down next to it and raises his eyebrows implicatively. Sherlock confirms with a look that he will eat it.
“I just wanted to help,” he’d replied, hesitant. Crestfallen. “I heard Mr. Amberley talking about Brent at the pub, saying he was going to consult you. I wanted to…” He trailed off, reddening. “And then I saw Dr. Watson at his farm and I…”
More than an hour passes in what feels like a blink. Feeling John’s presence in the doorway, Sherlock looks up from his work, turns and smiles, but… John isn’t there. Strange. He was so sure. Sherlock peers out of his now steam fogged windows at the house and loosens his muffler. The kitchen lights are on, glowing warmly in the blue morning light. John is up, then, but not here. Sherlock returns to his work and 10 minutes later John does materialise with a steaming mug of builder’s tea, strong and sweet, and a plate of toast slathered in butter and marmalade. Clean-shaven now, and handsome as always in his particular, weathered way.
“Meet me at the surgery? Around two?” John asks.
It doesn’t go well. Not at first.
So, Amberley was the murderer, then. Easily solved. Bit of a disappointment, really... that it had been so obvious. Anyone could have solved it. Sherlock was nothing special, and he was tiring. He’d begun to stoop. He was slowing down.
The holding cell is bare concrete and stainless steel, lit by buzzing fluorescents set in the ceiling. Sherlock has been aware of the buzz for some time, but he’s disorientingly uncertain of how long he’s been there. Consciousness is fitful, which isn’t logical, because he knows he’s uninjured. It’s as if he simply can’t pull himself back into the light from the murky depths of his mind’s silent rooms where none of this has happened, and where everything has just fallen back into place the way it should have done when he’d returned from the dead to give John his miracle.
As if by way of accompaniment to those thoughts, he’d begun to wonder if it was the bus that was rattling, or him, and to feel the pricklingly familiar companionship of his pathological muscles and nerves. His shoulder and neck were slowly hardening, he could feel the beginnings of a physical dissonance in his elbow and wrist, and an unwelcome, familiar ache in his hip, that was a little worse than usual after an active night and an early morning. It was all coming on a little more quickly than usual after taking his dose. He'd brought the small dose tablets along, just in case.
“Yes,” John says looking at Sherlock, who has come to a stop in front of the silvery trunk of a hornbeam, “He wants you to look into the disappearance of his lover—Brent. Says some of his art work and money is gone, too. Says he kept it in his studio in one of the old kilns.”
“I’ll get the smoker going,” John offers.
Next to it, there was a note in his spidery handwriting, which I noted was steady, entirely legible, and perfectly normal in size:
It was working. I smiled and continued.
Reader, I could.
After a moment: “They seem… louder. Agitated somehow…?”
It’s amazing how fond of a person it’s possible to be.
“Come on, John! What do I care how he keeps his hedge! Cut out the nonsense and tell me what happened with Amberley!”
In the months before his diagnosis, the growing disconnect between his body and mind had been deeply unsettling and almost repulsive, but he’s surprised to find that that’s  changing. Now it’s just oddly fascinating. Sherlock knows that his detachment and the curious neutrality with which he approaches his own condition causes John consternation, but he’s come to almost enjoy his body’s process of separating itself from his mind. He loves observing as the drug takes effect, feeling it bring his physicality into phase with his will—watching and feeling himself tremble and then gradually still, flexing his disobedient fingers and feeling them obey again.
I suppose it is, really.
After a long moment, Sherlock reaches over, turning at the waist to bring his left arm over the stiff right side of his body to drop the tablet into the water. He watches it dissolve, swishes the water around in the glass, raises it to his lips and knocks it back, then eats the biscuit. It will take time for the dopamine to control his tremor, and the biscuit will help settle his stomach. Sherlock has found it’s best if he just waits it out right where he is while the drug does its work.
revealed in blooming heat, my
Sherlock looked thoughtful.
Excellent.
We slept well last night and woke as we fell asleep—wrapped around each other. After lunch, we’re going for a long walk through the wood, maybe up as far as the edge of the hill that overlooks the sea.
John answers on the first ring.
When Sherlock came back from Eastbourne with Seth (who was wearing, I noted with interest, a brown barn jacket and red trainers) and sent me away with Amberley after this preposterous letter in Bells Yew Green of all places, I knew the case was as good as solved and that this was all about getting Amberley out of his hair. I wasn’t angry; I just did as I was told. I knew he wasn’t telling me everything, and I didn’t mind. I did wonder why he hadn’t found a way to let me know, but. Ok. Par for the course. I took it as a kind of backward expression of his faith in me
“Sherl—”
“Look at how they circle a bit with their wings raised straight up before they launch.”
In Bells Yew Green, Amberley and I met with the supposed holder of the mysterious letter, who had no idea what on earth we were talking about. At that point Amberley, looking hunted, demanded to be driven home immediately, and I knew that he was the killer.
Brilliant. I don’t know whether I mean that sincerely or sarcastically. Both, maybe.
“See you later.”
Sherlock is so many things. He’s my partner and lover. He’s a flawed human being and he’s Seth’s hero. He’s a genius. He’s a gardener and bee-keeper, a writer, and a scientist. He’s a sometimes irascible, eccentric old geezer, who gives honey to all the neighbours. He’s genuinely kind, even when he’s not. He’s Parkinsonian.
when the thing holding
The only reason I wasn’t properly exuberant by the time the serpentine belt went was Amberley’s anxiety, which, by that time, was growing in malevolence by the second. His face had taken on a ferocious, pinched aspect, and was drawn into a sneer that made his nose look more than ever like the beak of a bird of prey. He was pacing and loomed over me as if he meant to threaten me. With the car in for repair at the local shop, there was little else I could do but install us both in the inn above the local pub—separate rooms, thank god!—and retreat. He was livid, and I was glad to leave him to his demons. Once I’d settled in to my own rather dingy little room, I was— still not angry, exactly, but not entirely amused to be stuck in a one pub town with a killer. Away from Sherlock.
As for the sabotage, Seth had cut most of the way through the serpentine belt in John and Sherlock’s Volvo with his penknife. The car would run, but after the belt inevitably snapped, the power steering would give out, and together with the consequent drain of the car’s computer on the battery, it wouldn’t last long. When they stopped to talk to the doctor, it wouldn’t start again. There wouldn’t be any real damage to the engine, and the repair would be straightforward and not terribly expensive, but there was a good chance John and Amberley would be stranded overnight, waiting for the right part.
John hangs back, letting Mary hug and kiss him, but coming no closer himself. He reads pain (and anger?) in John’s tight smile and a more complicated riot of emotion that neither of them is willing to read with any clarity in the way John won’t look at him. There’s nothing to do but say goodbye and there are no words that can properly communicate the way leaving John (again) makes Sherlock feel like he’s being cut loose from all that moors him.
John.
“Oh, John. Just, everything!” Sherlock sighed, beaming like a child and reaching for me with his right hand, which was perfectly steady now. I rose from my chair and joined him on the sofa.
If he can live with it, who am I to argue?
Seth comes around, bends to watch them. Replies: “Uhm… No? Not really?”
Ah ha. There he was. Rude as ever. God, I love him.
your hands on my skin.
That afternoon, Mycroft does tell him: it’s to be exile.
The silence of Sherlock’s cell isn’t breached until the next morning, when John enters, carrying a stainless steel tray. Breakfast. Dry toast, cold scrambled eggs, tepid, black tea. Disgusting, but Sherlock clambers gracelessly to his feet and takes it anyway. He sits on the edge of his bunk. Doesn’t look at John.
“Well, obviously, Amberley thinks Ernest seduced Brent away from him and that they’ve run off together with the money and valuables. The very thought seemed to drive him into a fury. He tore up a picture of he and Brent together at an opening in London, and raged that he never wanted to see the bastard again. He told me that if he ever saw Ernest again, he’d not be responsible for his actions.
I’ve wanted to give him his space. He’ll talk to me when he’s ready. If he needs to.
And then, there was John’s love. Sherlock knows better than anyone what it means to have John’s love. He knows John’s depth of loyalty and the superhuman power of his forgiveness. Sherlock knows John’s heart.
Second? Seth. The boy was following John—that much was obvious—and in disguise, too! He hadn’t known Seth had had it in him! What possible reason could he have for doing it? And, how had he known that John would be at Haven Farm? Had he known?
Sherlock thanks the doctor stiffly, his face an expressionless mask, and on the way to the car they don’t speak of it. After a long, silent drive, they arrive home well past supper time. Neither of them is hungry. Sherlock goes mutely up to bed. John listens to him knocking about upstairs, and drinks a glass of scotch alone, standing over the kitchen sink, staring into the darkened garden.
“But Sherlock,” Seth had asked, “Why would he show you? Wouldn’t he just go kill the doctor?”
It takes Sherlock several drowsy minutes to remember what he now remembers every morning: that everything is different now—that
“Sherlock,” he says, very calmly, leaning forward in his armchair to lay his hand over Sherlock’s tensely clasped ones, “I will not take ‘sod off’ for an answer. I know you know it’s not nothing. I know you. Hm?”
Sherlock had planned to break in, but there was no need; the door was open. They found that one of the towers had been gutted and converted into Amberley’s studio space, which was up a short flight of stairs into the roundel, with his archival strongroom in what had once been the plenum chamber, it’s door hanging open to air out the reek of the oil paint he’d used to paint the lintels, jambs and mouldings. The room was empty but for a few of Amberley’s portfolios of sketches, a few paintings stacked against each other along the far wall, an easel and some art supplies.
A case is just the thing. There hasn’t been one in ages.
Sherlock sits on the edge of the bed for a moment before going into the bathroom to take a pill. He eats the water biscuit by his bedside. This time, when he lays down, sleep comes easily.
When they take him, his eyes are open again and his face is impassive, streaked with the silent tears he’s only just aware he’s been crying. His left shoulder is badly wrenched into the handcuffs, but he barely feels it, and he doesn’t resist.
Sherlock tilts his head back, turning to seek John’s lips—finds them. His cheeks are wet. John kisses him, tastes salt, and aches. Sherlock tilts his head back further, half turning his shoulders, eyes half closed, his head on John’s pillow. His mouth falls open and his breathing deepens.
Sherlock nods, watches John as he heads towards the potting shed, and turns back to look at Seth. “Well? What’s first?”
“John, I don’t think this is who I am anymore. I don’t think I… I don’t want to do this.”
It seems harmless enough—he knows it’s not real, he’s not confused—and it doesn’t frighten him, so we’ve taken it in stride. Sherlock says he rather likes having a phantom cat. Much more tolerable than a phantom hound, he says!
“Uh huh,” Seth says, uncertain, watching. “Oh! they do!” He acknowledges finally,  turning to Sherlock, rapt and eager. “What does it mean, Mr. Holmes?”
That said, the discovery has really perked him up a bit, which is brilliant. Sherlock is a great believer in the healing power of bees, and he does love an experiment. I’m a great believer in anything that brings back the mad bugger I fell in love with. I haven’t seen him in awhile. If that’s bee venom, then I love bee venom.
Sherlock turns over in bed. Squeezes his hands into fists. Wills the left one to stop. Blinks into the darkness. Cold. Filled with nameless dread.
After a few moments, John emerges in his worn Barbour coat. They walk in silence awhile. John’s silence—his
John backs away and leans against the opposite wall, his arms crossed over his chest. His wool and cotton clad presence is comforting and warm, familiar but interdicted. He waits.
At the back, near the now quiet hives, he’s got a comfortable little potting shed that he and John have insulated and now doubles as his workspace. An alone place. A place for thinking. John had installed a cast iron, wood-burning stove there, and Sherlock had commandeered John’s old military issue canvas camp bed and set it up along one wall. There’s a workbench on the other, under a bank of dusty windows, and above them, a shelf—a few notebooks, his old skull, beekeeping and gardening references, guides to local birds and wildflowers, and a few sheaves of paper, all bookended by jars of amber honey, and all contributing to a comforting sort of disorder.
“Did you happen to make note of the seat numbers?” Sherlock pressed, avid now.
So, I wait. But, it’s like a buzz. Like my own kind of tremor.
“Really, I’m ok, love. I’m fine! I’ll be home before you know it, and we’ll wrap this up. I can’t wait to hear how you solved it. I knew you could. Get some sleep now. It’s ok.”
On reflection, perhaps I was a bit cruel. After all, it must have been hard for him to feel… out of it all. Anyway, after visibly stewing at my refusal to offer up any information, he finally exploded with frustration.
Sherlock wills himself still and surrenders, retreating into the isolation chamber of his own mind. He allows the world outside his skin to fade and muffle, and allows himself to be the still point around which everything else is rushing. It’s a stillness that doesn’t come naturally to Sherlock, but really, such a lot of things have happened recently, and so many of them don’t come naturally to him. Maybe what comes naturally to him is changing.
Sherlock has managed to procure his bee venom cure, too. In addition to foregoing protection when managing the hives, he’s self-administering intramuscular injections of a gel suspension of freeze-dried, purified bee venom (!!), and he has an acupuncturist twice a week (sent by Mycroft, of course!) who treats him with subcutaneous bee-venom injections at acupuncture points. After about 5 weeks of this, he’s decided he wants to try lowering his dose of carbidopa-levodopa.
“Oh Sherlock. That email? Bells Yew Green? The car? What was it you once said? Elementary. I know you! I soon as I saw you with Seth I knew. Red trainers. I thought… why would he send me away? By the time the car broke down, I was certain. You searched his house?”
I went on. I told Sherlock that I’d been struck by Amberley’s size and strength, something I’d never really noticed before in his visits to the surgery. His expression was fierce and eager and gave his whole presence a kind of aggressive rapaciousness. I also noted that his garden was absolutely untouched and gave one the overwhelming impression of neglect. The house itself, with its wonderful rounded Oast towers—a fine example of the vernacular architecture of this part of the country—was sadly ramshackle and as unkempt as the man himself.
He’s my best friend, as he has been for decades. There’s no one I love more.
“I love you,” John whispers, burying his face in Sherlock’s wild hair, stroking slowly, with a sure and practised hand, tightening his grip just a little, moving faster. “I love you.”
I’ll try not to.
Maybe John knows.
“Stress can make it worse, Sherlock, but you’re ok. I’m ok. It’s all fine. Take a small dose and get some sleep. You know you need it. I’m fine, really. I know what I’m about. Don’t worry about me.”
“Don’t look like that, Sherlock,” Mycroft chides, as if showing remarkable forbearance to a needy child, “the alternatives were much worse. This way we have the ghost of a chance.” He looks down his nose condescendingly. “Chin up, little brother.”
Sherlock— Right. Moving on.
“Oh, Amberley?”
And since he met Mary.
With Seth’s help, the back half-acre is now a pretty little Arcadia of bright, indomitable wildflowers swaying together in the soft breeze, alive with pollinators: flies, wasps, butterflies and of course, bees -- some of them Sherlock’s,  some, no doubt, their wilder cousins or visitors from other nearby hives, and still others are the fat, buff-tailed bumblebees from the new colony under the chimonanthus praecox in the drive. Sherlock loves the abundant wildness of it, the uncontrollable, perpetual renewal, and the way it will all go on without his interference, bees, flowers, seasons, always changing, always new and always the same -- for as long as it is left to do so.
Sherlock gets dressed.
“I’m going to want you as long I’m breathing. I can’t not. We can do this. It’s... a blow, I...I’ll grant you. But it’s why we’re... Sherlock... I’m here.”
“Well, the bees are agitated… and they’re… busy. They’re making a lot of honey and storing food, but… in the brood box? Are these drone cells, Sherlock? Or… Oh. No.” The boy looks up, his face suddenly full of worry. “Mr Holmes, the queen…?”
- Rudolf Steiner from
He’ll be ok. A quiet day is in order.
Now, if only I could stop worrying about him!
“What’s this about, then?” Sherlock had asked.
From the helicopter, Sherlock looks back at Appledore and sees John standing on the stairs, shielding his eyes with his hand, his head turning to follow as they lift off and away.
I don’t know what I want. I asked him to talk to Dr. Novakova about his mood, but I don’t think he did. Doing it for him seems wrong somehow. I feel—torn. I want to help, but being his doctor—I don’t know. For now, I’m going to just keep an eye on it.
“Yes.” Sherlock says, as he takes a tablet out of his shirt pocket and washes it back with swig of tea. “Thank you, John,” he adds, as he flexes the disobedient fingers in his right hand and then tries to squeeze them into a fist.
Sherlock says he’s fine, but he’s been withdrawn and uncharacteristically passive. Depression is natural under the circumstances, and research now says it’s an integral part of Parkinsonian pathology. He hasn’t seemed sad, exactly, just... pliant, I guess. Expressionless and apathetic. It’s so unlike him. I worry that he will lose some measure of his independence to this illness, or his character, and I don’t always like my role in mediating it. I want to take care of him, but I—
John behind him, Mycroft in the helicopter.
“Ok then, Sherlock Holmes. What have I missed?” I hoped he couldn’t read the pleasure in my voice. I made every effort to sound affronted.
“Doctor Watson and I have agreed that he will stay with Mary. There is the child to consider, and our investigations. He will do his best to make her believe that she truly is safe,” Mycroft tells him. Sherlock can feel his misgivings, and shares them. “It will not be easy for him,” he adds quietly.
“How’s the new chapter working out for you, Sherlock? The not getting involved?”
Sitting in his office, surrounded by hand-drawn maps of the stars—white pencil on black card, the heavens as he has seen them from his dormer window—he places that clenched fist and the tremble that preceded it into the constellation he knows best. John doesn’t delete things, certainly not things about Sherlock. He knows that tremor and the subsequent white fist for what it is: a material disturbance in the concrete poetry of well-known joints and limbs. It’s a symptom, and like celestial light bending around an impossible density in the endless mystery of space, it’s a lens, focused on a diagnosis that is not at all unlike a gravitational singularity that John knows is inexorably drawing them both towards it. When he puts all of it together, John sees the shape of something dark and dense, and not at all distant.
He breathes. He focuses his attention on his breath and observes his own thoughts, aware now of the intractable fatigue that’s creeping like a fog through his consciousness. He’s just so tired—so deeply tired of pretending to be indestructible and omniscient when he’s really just feeling flayed open—aching, heartbroken, and as fallible as any man. For months now he’s been struggling against a riptide of irrepressible emotion, and now he’s finally at sea, drifting further and further into the deep. In all the flash and noise, he lets himself float away into profound silence, and it’s a relief, rare and precious.
“I don’t know,” he says, surfacing. “Mycroft will tell me.”
So, today something—I’m not sure whether to call it “interesting” or “disturbing” —happened. This morning I went out back to bring Sherlock a cup of tea—he was up early making preparations to feed the bees. When I came out, he was in the potting shed making notes in his beekeeping journal. He looked at me out of the corner of his eye, without turning, and asked me if there was a cat in the room with us. There wasn’t.
Just like old times. I won’t pretend I’m not delighted.
It was a surprise, then, when he called me in the wee hours, as I was lying awake worrying about him alone at home, to tell me the truth about Amberley—tremulous and full of worry for me. I—
It hasn’t been a good past couple of weeks. The medication, even in a low dose, hasn’t been easy to tolerate, and Sherlock has had headaches, dizziness, and nausea in addition to his other symptoms, which haven’t responded yet. I think he was more comfortable before starting the medication, really. Nevertheless, we’re increasing the dosage, perhaps adding domperidone for the nausea. Dr. Novakova says his body will adjust. What worries me most is his almost total loss of appetite. Getting him to eat is more of a struggle than ever before.
“Bombus terrestris,” Sherlock told me, smiling. “You can tell by their buff tails,” he added, pointing to a space under the hedge against the stone wall where a small congregation had gathered around an opening between the earth and stone, “they live in underground colonies, and their size makes them better able to withstand temperature variation, so they’re active in winter. They’re attracted to the colour yellow, and the scent.”
It’s cold in his concrete box. He shivers and curls in on himself on the bare mattress, burying his face in the dirty ticking and the stale smell of old sweat. The truth is, this disturbance began before those heavy days in Baker Street. He’s been off his game since he came back from the dead. Since the moment he saw the cavernous depths of his own human error in John’s eyes.
After it was all over—bodies found, statements given—I took Sherlock by the arm and led him out out into the disordered garden. He came silently and willingly. He was passive,  almost childlike in his docility. He looked around himself, at the shambolic garden, the thorny, tangled hedge, the neglected flowerbeds, then at me, his face vague and expressionless and said:
In the maelstrom that follows Magnussen’s murder, Sherlock turns to face the light and noise and assumes the position, his heart pounding in time with the blades of the helicopter that’s blinding him. He knows the red dots of the laser sights are crawling over his skin, and his knees hurt. After a fraught moment staring into the cacophony of light and noise, he closes his eyes with the kind of infinite gentleness that’s only possible in the midst of the most appalling chaos. John is behind him, and Sherlock can feel his panic and confusion—his laboured breathing, his pounding heart—as if they were inside him, as if they were his own lungs and his own heart.
“No police. Not yet. No proof! We need to get rid of Amberley,” he’d said to Seth. “We need to search his farm.” And, he’d thought, John would have to accompany Amberley to make sure he didn’t turn back, and to warn Sherlock if he did, but… He couldn’t know. John wouldn’t go if he knew.
The frowning deepened. Impossibly deep frowning.
“The bees will work.... But… after a while, foraging will slow… and the workers might start to lay. There will be too many drones, workers will die, and without a queen, they can’t be replenished... and the colony will collapse.”
He doesn’t.
At this, the boy had just let out a miserable, despairing breath, refusing to meet Sherlock’s eye. So that was it.
“It’s him, John. Amberley. It’s—” Sherlock’s voice is rough and tremulous. He’s breathing harder than he realised.
I’m not sure why I feel that way, but I do.
Last night, after Sherlock’s confession in the drive, we sat together as we used to do in London, in our chairs by the fire. He told me all about the case—how Seth had helped him, how his phantom cat had led him to the bodies in the plenum. Wonderful!
“Goodnight, John,” he says.
I’d arrived at Amberley’s at about 11:15 this morning and noted that his house, once the seat of a flourishing hops farm for the production of a fine local brew (but now fallow), was called “Haven Farm”. The neighborhood was much like the rest of the village, but his house itself, unlike any others in the vicinity, was surrounded by high, crumbling stone wall covered in lichens and mosses, and an even higher Hawthorn hedge, thorny and twisted, and it must be said—ill cared for.
He’s so blank. I want him to be angrier, maybe. Or, sad? Anything, really.
Well, that went better than I ever imagined it would! I won’t go into detail. Suffice it to say that Sherlock took the initiative in ways he hasn’t done in a long while.
Perfect.
I was really getting somewhere now!
It hadn’t been until Sherlock was rattling along on the bus that he’d  thought of being… well, rattled. Could he do this? Could he really?
Shameless! And, wonderful. I put my hand over his, laced our fingers together and pressed his palm against my own burgeoning interest.
By this time, Sherlock was sat up on the edge of the sofa, elbows on knees, hands folded together under his chin. His right hand and arm still shook a bit, but he paid it no mind. I told him that the very first thing Amberley had said was that he was terribly disappointed that his troubles didn’t seem important enough to warrant “the personal attention of the illustrious Sherlock Holmes.” Sherlock scoffed in dismissive frustration and threw himself back into the cushions of the sofa.
The scent of the flowers was strong—not sweetly floral, but spicy and penetrating. I realised I had smelled them from down the road on my walk home. No wonder the bees had moved in. We stood still for a time, watching them in silence.
It seems an uneven trade.
Everyone gets older and life changes for all of us. Parkinson’s is just one of the ways that process will affect Sherlock and me. It could be worse. We’ve seen worse in the course of our lives together. All we can do is carry on. Do what we must to maintain, at whatever level we can, for as long as we can.
Sherlock’s given the honey away mostly—to the neighbours. He takes jars of the stuff everywhere he goes—the post office, the baker’s, the farm shop. He even sent a few jars to Lestrade and Molly this year. Needless to say we have a lifetime supply. The shelves in his potting shed are still lined with amber jars and bars of rendered wax.
with its perfect bridge above
Too soon to think it was anything else.
In the balance of more or less back to normal, I have to admit: it seems it’s less. I’ve bowed out of my hours at the surgery this week. I don't feel comfortable leaving him alone.
God knows I didn’t want to see it.
I wish he would tell me… I don’t know what. I don’t know what I want him to tell me. I just want him to be ok. I know that’s probably 80% selfishness. If he’s not ok, I want him to tell me. God. I hate this.
the crocodiles,
Sherlock cannot avoid the awareness that something in his chest is squeezing painfully. He’s holding his breath, in danger of drowning.
Sherlock doesn’t know whether he really is one of the unworthy, but he does know that the only way to find out is to endure, and do what he must. If these are his final days, he’ll live them fiercely. He’ll live for John, and for Baker Street. He’ll be as brilliant and ruthless as he can be in exchange for the hope of future cups of tea shared in companionable silence on rainy London mornings. He’ll fight for that life with every bit of intelligence and resilience he possesses, and if he dies, he’ll die knowing it was for the only thing that really mattered.
Oh, nevermind the barn jacket! I was loving this. Of course I missed everything! I played the game:
The evening Sherlock knows for certain that something is profoundly not as it should be follows on the heels of the kind of gloriously perfect midsummer day that he is certain can only be properly appreciated by retirees from a lifetime of bustle in the city—those who have seen a retreating horizon of grey drizzle, noise, and smog give way to the deep, unspeakable pleasure of a day spent in the garden under high white clouds adrift in a delicately blue sky. Sherlock spent that day bathed in the gentle warmth of a temperate English sun, breathing air that was fragrant with earth and blossom, alive to a lightly ruffling breeze, the gliding chirrups of house martins, and the industry of his bees.
So, he’d taken his medication, stretched and done his exercises, and he’d eaten—he’d made sure to leave a clear record of his having eaten on the table; it would please John, and make him less likely to worry or follow—and, he’d made an ostentatious show of his own departure, loitering about in the front garden for what felt like an eternity, (were those buds? On the Wintersweet?
John.
On the bedside table, there’s a glass of water next to a plate with a single water biscuit and one small, pale yellow tablet—left by John, just as it is every night.
I think I want to talk about the case with him. About what happened, about that phone call, and about what he said at Amberley’s farm. About what he meant by that. I want to know how he’s feeling. I don’t want to force him to talk if he doesn’t want to. Sherlock has always been very private. But— he doesn’t read my dramatic retellings anymore, and I feel like I want to process this with him. At the same time don’t want to force him to process it with me. Impose on him. Anyway, something tells me he’s not prepared to do so, and that waiting—patience—is the better part of valour.
“Yes. That’s good! What are they?”
We can never really know what it’s supposed to feel like, being alive. We only know what we know. What we feel. Sherlock’s always lived at a remove from his “transport”, except in the moments when he doesn’t. Perhaps it isn’t bothering him so much to lose its cooperation?
Led him home.
To that, he merely glowered. It was adorable. I have missed this!
He told John what he needed to tell him to make him take her back. Sherlock’s suspicions are damning, but they are no more than suspicions. There’s no proof. He told John what he had to so that he would make Mary feel safe, make her feel like she’d won. Enough to keep John’s child safe, and most of all, because Sherlock is selfish, to keep John safe.
After more than a decade living together—bordering and protecting each other—the barriers and uncertainties that once stood between them have eroded, allowing softness and candor to bloom in their intimate spaces. John has always been surprised by how well retirement has suited Sherlock, once the notion had taken hold in his imagination; how unresistingly he’d given up the rush of London and their cases and given in to the quieter rhythm of their life together in Sussex. It was as if Sherlock had given up the bustle and busy-ness of it all to fall into the arms of their slower days and gentler pursuits with something entirely like relief. Since the earliest days of their intimacy, it has always been greedy, naked and honest, but now, where there had once stood laboriously built bridges to span the distance between them, there is a gentler, more natural space, effortlessly and usually wordlessly traversed.
“He was wearing a brown barn jacket! How could you know that? I never mentioned it!”
“Do they?” he asked.
“I did, actually,” I told him, well pleased with myself indeed! But, they were memorable— seats 21 and 22, row b. Of course I thought of Baker Street.
It’s an excellent opportunity to teach the boy.
“Well…” Seth begins, “We need to requeen, right? First, we need to know how long it’s been since she was here. We need to look for eggs and brood!”
But there it is, as promised,
With the excitement of the case passed, things are more or less back to normal today, though I don’t think Sherlock’s as well as he might be. Unusually, he’s still in bed at 9:30 am, after a taciturn evening and a restless night, and shows no sign of rising.
Not entirely good, but... Not boring?
“Four to… about 9 days?” Seth asks, his eyes lighting up when Sherlock nods his agreement, “and… oh! These must be queen cups!” he finishes excitedly, pointing at the larger, protruding cells.
It’s amazing how much of this he has explained away to himself (or deleted?) over the past months (or years?), and kept from me. I almost feel betrayed. But, in his (my?) defense, Sherlock has never been like anyone else. Perhaps he just—legitimately—thought nothing of it. Neither of us wanted to believe anything was wrong. Now I’m wondering if he knew something was wrong, or if it all just felt familiar to him. His way of being in the world. Just a thing to accept and get on with.
Sherlock considers.
I’m looking forward to it.
So… Noted. With some prejudice, I must admit.
“‘No’ you won’t look into it, or ‘No’ he didn’t keep it there?”
Sherlock looks nettled. “I won’t do it. Really, John, how should I know where he keeps things in his house?”
No, then.
“How?”
Sherlock shakes his head faintly, and hums to encourage the boy.
“Sherlock,” he says, sharp and alert, “are you alright?”
“Yes, I think you’ll find what you’re looking for there.” Mycroft looks smug for a moment, and then doesn’t. “Don’t be reckless, Sherlock.”
It’s impossible to quantify just how fond and how—
“John.” Sherlock breathes in response, pushing forward now to meet John’s grasp, his hand reaching back to hold John’s body flush against himself, “Oh, John.”
I knew he could.
Maybe it’s best if John doesn’t come.
I leant over to catch his lips with mine.
“I didn’t do it for you,” Sherlock says dully, to the grey wall.
Sherlock struggles against the torpor, and when he lets them flood back, the last few days and hours play over and over in his mind in a curiously smooth loop, as if there
“John,” he attempts. No sound, just breath.
John draws in a deep breath, his brows knitting themselves together, his eyes filling suddenly. He’s glad Sherlock can’t see his face. He shakes his head, bringing his nose and lips close, breathing in the warmth of the soft skin and disordered curls at the nape of Sherlock’s neck, and speaks in the tone that no one else will ever, ever hear.
There’s a subsequent call to Mycroft and a few days later, they’re in London. There are tests and scans, and endless medical histories. John answers some of the questions Sherlock can’t (or won’t?), and it’s Mycroft’s hand-picked neuropathologist who finally tells Sherlock what John’s suspected for some time—exactly what he’s been dreading:
So many plans he’d thought were carefully laid—dashed. Now only gaol or exile await. If only he’d been as good at being dead inside. If he had been, none of this would have happened.
His voice is warm, intimate. He’s looking at Sherlock’s profile now, his eyes still wet, but his face is open and questing. He runs his palm over Sherlock’s white knuckles. Sherlock’s eyelids flicker closed of their own accord and he feels like he’s capsizing in his silenced mind. He doesn’t reply, but it’s only because he’s under water.
He also told me about his dreams—the ones in which his body is twisted and made unreconisable by pathology. What terrifying thoughts. It's no wonder he’s been low. As he told me, though, it was if he was visibly lightening—throwing off a burden. Perhaps it helped to share them—made them less powerful somehow? Or, diffused them in some way? We’ll see. I hope so. It certainly helped me to talk, once I’d learned to. I’ll remember for next time. Perhaps I could be more help.
At first, Sherlock won’t admit that anything’s wrong at all. He’s dismissive—abrupt and cold in a way he hasn’t been in years. John knows better than to take it personally. By now, he is an accomplished master at managing Sherlock Holmes, of not rising to Sherlock’s barbs, of quietly pushing back just enough, but never too much. He is gently implacable.
We don’t talk much. But then, I suppose we never have. And since we settled here, into this life, even less. We haven’t needed to. We live in peace, secure, I suppose, in each other. We eat and sit together in companionable silence, talk when we talk, and fall asleep pressed against each other. It’s fine. I mean, it’s good. More than good. It’s everything I want. It’s just—
“John…”
“Ex-lover, I’d say, going by his thwarted, futile air. And his slovenly appearance, of course. Blind in his left eye. No, I don’t know him.”
“You’re famous, Mr. Holmes! It’ll make sense!” Seth had urged, his young face bright with enthusiasm.
It had all started so promisingly. He’d woken that morning a little before 4:00am after just a few hours of greedy, dreamless sleep. He’d felt grounded, boneless, and pleasantly sore. He’d woken to  find John pressed against him, his head on Sherlock’s left shoulder, snoring gently, his humid breath ghosting gently over Sherlock’s skin, one leg cast over Sherlock’s thigh, and one arm a dead weight across Sherlock’s chest, pinning him down. Lovely.
Finished! Very Important notes at the end. Plus, this:
He did stop, then, and looked into my eyes. His were wet and pale. He looked at me searchingly for a moment.
Anyway, I’ll go see Amberley first thing tomorrow morning. See if I can’t lure Sherlock in.
John sees. Puts the plate with the half-eaten sandwich down on the top of the hive, and reaches over to pick up Sherlock’s long, white hand, massaging and manipulating it firmly between his own, digging into the pads of Sherlock’s palm with his thumbs, and then moving up the arm, kneading his way to Sherlock’s shoulder and neck, manipulating the joints. Sherlock closes his eyes, his head falling forward, the bees like a halo around his black and silver hair, like he’s been knocked out in a cartoon.
“Seth,” Sherlock had said without turning around, “why don’t you come and sit beside me.”
Sherlock shivers in bed, rolls over and presses his tremoring left hand under the pillow with the weight of his head. Pulls the cold duvet tighter around his shoulders. The bed feels very empty, and all he wants is to be unconscious. He closes his eyes. Wills himself into oblivion.
Suspicions are not enough to break John’s heart again, nor are they enough to heal it.
“I don’t know!”
I’m angry sometimes, and sadness is always there if I look for it these days.
Sherlock does have times when he is slow, creaky, stiff, sore, or shaky but he bears it well. He tires easily, but he’s sleeping better, too. He’s been—more than usually—warm and affectionate. He’s eating—not much!— but it’s better. His phantom cat continues to be harmless, and he’s as sharp-minded and acerbic as ever when he wants to be.
“As ever, John, you see, but you don’t observe.” He was playing now. Teasing me. I schooled my expression. Tried to look cross. I could see it in his eyes that I hadn’t succeeded—they went warmer and darker at the same time.
Sherlock had lain awake for a time, unwilling to move, breathing in John’s animal warmth, his mind racing ahead into the day and onto the case, a sense of energetic purpose sputtering to life, swelling and rising inside of him. It felt… good? Disquieting? Both familiar and unfamiliar: like nothing so much as an old friend one hasn’t seen in long enough that you wonder if you really know them anymore… wonder if you really are still friends after so long.
At the moment, there are no significant psychological effects to report (unless it’s just a peculiar blankness—but this IS Sherlock), nor is there any sign of cognitive impairment. Of course, those are the things I fear most, and those I suspect he won’t allow himself to consider.
Which makes me sad. But. This isn’t about me. I know that.
“John.” Voice this time. Unsteady, but more than just air.
Appledore.
Not nameless.
The end. MY GOD. I wrote a whole, entire story. I'm a little emotional, honestly.
Sherlock is silent. He doesn’t trust himself, not even to speak.
“Hi, Dr. Watson, Mr. Holmes!” The look in his face keen and eager.
“Walk, John.” Sherlock says, and nods curtly to Mr. Amberley, turning back towards the door. He’ll wait outside.
He’d found a kind of peace with it by sinking more deeply into the arms of his routine, his garden, his wintering bees, and his life with John—all comfortable and well-worn. He’d occupied himself with the mysteries of his industrious hives, the continuous—miraculous!—renewal of the garden. His experiments with bee venom had been a satisfying addition. Yes. The bees were his work now. He was, after years of turmoil, a creature of habit and warmth, living a gentler more generous kind of life… Lazy! Old! Devolving. He felt… guilty. His darker more thrilling days called to him as if they were (or were supposed to be?) his truth. His calling.
I didn’t know what to say. He was staring without focus into the middle distance towards the gap in the wall and hedge, into the lane. I nodded, took his hand and squeezed it, and then led him away. Through that gate, down that lane.
“Mm. No doubt,” Sherlock replied sagely, and I thought, with a hint of humour. “A tall, slender man in red trainers and a brown barn jacket?”
“Pupil. Fully dilated.” Sherlocks says, very softly. “And the way he turned his head and shoulders to look at me. Fully. From the trunk.” Sherlock slows. Stops. “So, he came in with a burn and told you all his troubles? You aren’t friends. I suppose there’s something he wants?”
Apparently, some French Parkinsonian beekeeper who’d started a course of injections of bee venom to desensitize him to being stung found that he felt better and needed less medication for the Parkinsonian symptoms with the bee-venom injections than without.
“Dead.” Sherlock confirms, “gone.”
Highlights? After a somewhat storied career as an artist in London with the high, fast lifestyle that accompanied it, he had fallen in love with Brent, a handsome, much younger lad who held court as a barkeep in the Shade Lounge, a members-only SoHo boys club with an exclusive clientele. From what I gather, Amberley’s name and bank account were particularly appealing to Brent, who basically became a kept man. For a while, they’d lived a high life in London—fashion shows, drugs, parties, and God knows what else, but Amberley had wearied of all that. At his insistence, they’d moved to the farm in May. Amberley set up a new studio and archive space in one of the old Oast kilns, and planned to live a quiet, less profligate life with his lover in the country. Perhaps get back to his painting.
Not much to report. Things are pretty stable. Sherlock is managing well, and seems like his old self—by which I mean the “old self” who lives with me here in the country—the one who keeps bees, tends the garden, and does a host of other things I never thought I’d see, like being friendly with the neighbours and holding hands with me on long walks.
“I was thinking,” John says, pulling Sherlock to him, laying his cheek against Sherlock’s shoulder and chest, his hand sliding possessively over Sherlock’s belly, and down around his waist and hip, “that we could walk all the way to the sea tomorrow. What d’you think? Anything else on? Will you be up for it?”
In the past months, Sherlock had often thought of John’s likening his Parkinsonian symptoms to the gravitational lensing that reveals the invisible, all-consuming, inevitable density of a singularity lurking in space. An inescapable disruption from which nothing, not even light, can escape. A black hole in the universe that warps everything in it’s orbit. Sherlock has never had much patience for poetics or for metaphors, especially not scientific ones. Sentimental nonsense! But, the image has lodged itself in his mind, and Sherlock realises that he sees crime this way—as a heavy blackness that shapes the space around it, distorting and reordering the world, warping it to allow him his perceptions and observations—letting him deduce. The density of crime made him what he was. Dark matter.
John nods. Smiles. “Mr. Amberley’s just been telling me…”
“Mm.” Sherlock answers, turning back to his work. He nearly suppresses his smile.
Oh, god. What an idiot he was!
But John, old faithful John, had impressed upon their client that it would make the worst possible impression on the police, and indeed, upon us, should he refuse to follow up so important a lead. There’d been a charade of a phone call in which Sherlock asked their imaginary correspondent to give his letter to John, as he was too unwell to travel, and finally, Amberley had acquiesced and stalked out of the house. John had kissed Sherlock and smiled, and then driven away with a murderer.
“Ready? I can’t wait!” Seth answers, fidgeting with the hat and veil in his hands. He’s excited, but apprehensive, too.
John looks pleased. “Seth will be by today. He’s home on his winter hols. Have you got anything for him to do? He’s keen to see you.”
John will come. He has to come. Won’t he?
He feels movement against his calf and ankle and looks down to see the adolescent ginger tom John had (in a bout of what can only be described as unconscionable sentimentality) given him at Christmas after The Last Case. The cat is a prim, finicky creature whose lavish affections are bestowed exclusively on its own terms, as is its not inconsiderable viciousness. John had insisted on calling it Biscuit. A ridiculous name. To his chagrin, Sherlock loves him -- there’s no other word! -- ludicrous, tiny, insignificant creature that he is, and the feeling is mutual. The cat is insistent, rising up on his hind legs to rub his wet nose against Sherlock’s trouser leg. Smiling faintly, he bends to reach down and stroke the animal’s proffered head with his steadier left hand. It trills at him in response, undone by pleasure. A proper hedonist.
One way or the other, the suffering will be finite.
He squeezes his eyes closed and drifts.
The case is solved, post case crash sets in, and John is kind.
That night, John climbs into bed behind a foetal Sherlock who lies awake staring into the dimness, his right hand trapped under the pillow, held down—held still—by the weight of his head. John burrows close, runs his hand down Sherlock’s ribs and hip. Strokes. Waits.
At Dr. Novakova’s suggestion, we’re starting the process of titrating the dosage of Sherlock’s medication, which I’ll supervise in consultation with her. He’s starting with  a low dose of carbidopa/levodopa, 3 times a day, and we will be slowly increasing the dose until his symptoms respond. We’re trying the controlled release tablets at night, also starting with the lowest dosage, which might help him sleep and lessen the effect of the drugs wearing off overnight. It could take months to get the dosage right. In addition, he’ll be on a lower protein diet (aids absorption) and instituting an exercise regime – perhaps just daily walks for now, and later something prescribed by his physiotherapist, when he’s assigned one?
“Of course I did. I knew you had a reason, Sherlock. I trust you.”
That’s when the serpentine belt went.
No, John had to be… got rid of.
His symptoms seem to be responding to the medication now, just a bit.
that doesn't exist.
They’ve walked over a fallow, wintering field and climbed over the style into the Beech wood now. Sherlock is gazing up through bare branches at a close, grey sky.
John breathes them into Sherlock’s skin. He runs his warm palm down over hip and flank, and back up to Sherlock’s chest, through the sparse hair there, and down again to his belly, sweet, warm, and soft under the duvet, presses Sherlock against himself, and then reaches deeper into the curve of Sherlock’s pelvis. Sherlock straightens his knees a little with a trembling sigh, opening himself to John’s touch. John strokes and hums against Sherlock's hair, kisses Sherlock’s white shoulder, and worries a piqued nipple. He is rewarded by a sharply in-drawn breath and a deep rumble of encouragement. He smiles against Sherlock’s skin.
When he moves to sit up, he is confronted by all the (now familiar) reminders: his neck and shoulder on the right side are rigid and immobile, his right arm numb and heavy as stone, and at the same time, fizzing with the strange energy of his condition. After a few moments, he pushes himself up, slowly and carefully, trying not to wake John, and yes—he finds that he is stiff and trembling. It’s an effort to roll his shoulders back and lift his chest and head. His neck is stiff, and won’t turn to the right without pain. The fingers on his right hand are trembling and jumping where they rest—beyond his control. He can feel the peculiar buzz of his tremor through his elbow and all the way up to his shoulder.
We talked, too, about what he’d said in the drive at Haven Farm— that he didn’t think he was a detective anymore. That he didn’t want to be. That in a way, it felt like he had lost himself—his identity—to age and infirmity, but that in another way, it was as if he were simply another person now. Another version of the person he has always been.
Stop!
Ironic, then, that what causes the physical complaint that warps him now is the depletion of neurons in the part of his brain called the Substantia Nigra. Perhaps, he sometimes thinks (when he’s feeling contemptibly sorry for himself), his life immersed in crime consumed them and left him shaking and weak, hallucinating and depleted. Ridiculous! But, here he is again, immersing himself in crime, and this crime itself disgusts and terrifies him. A man so twisted and desperate that he could kill his lover before he could lose him? When Sherlock thinks of it—really thinks—he can almost hear his tremor, as if it were a sound, building and buzzing in his head.
Only transport.
It doesn’t come.
. After all these years?). He’d waited to see curtains flicker at Seth’s window, giving the boy time to dress and follow. Finally, he’d wrapped up warm against the early morning chill, and set out. He felt a bit shaky and apprehensive, but perhaps the shaking was just the cold.
Ridiculous!
clamouring hot and
“I want John, Mycroft. John first.”
Wouldn’t you know it, but Sherlock has found studies that posit BEE VENOM, of all things, as having a protective benefit to dopaminergic neurons, and studies have indeed shown that it has some efficacy in reducing Parkinsonian symptoms. What are the chances?!
beyond words, beyond control?
of need, together, pulled by
we to fight this love
Sherlock can’t think of anything to say. He’s overwhelmed by so many things, not the least of which is almost suffocating love. He wants to tell John. He wants to tell John that he’s always been the ballast that has kept him stable; that he can endure anything, do anything, with John as his witness. He doesn’t say any of this.
collide, finally. To fall
Lets the East Wind take him.
The only problem at the moment is his diet. Getting him to eat, a trial in the best of times, is still more difficult than ever. We have managed to control the nausea, but he’s just got very little appetite. Not really new. What is new, though, is that he’s lost rather a lot of weight and looks like an aging version of the Sherlock Holmes I first met—thin as a rail, all angles, but—wrinklier. He looks delicate in a way he hasn’t since that first year we spent together, and frail in a way he never has.
“Don’t touch anything,” he’d told Seth, though the boy was frozen in horror. There was little reason to think he would. Tomorrow, when John and Amberley returned, he’d call the police and it would be over.
Despite Mycroft’s tone, Sherlock is aware that he doesn’t really hate his brother, and he knows Mycroft is right. Sherlock tolerates it and replies with the one thing his mind can’t let go.
Then, I told him, Amberley poured out his tale of woe for the better part of two hours.
“No, John. Don’t. If you’re so keen, you look into it,” Sherlock says, turning away. “I should start at the old farm.”
Mycroft leaves without a word.
I took his hand, laced my fingers between his and pulled him closer to me. He came, a bit unsteadily, but not unwilling, still not looking up.
He watches one of his workers as she darts in and out of each speckled bell-like blooms of a tall digitalis purpurea, marvelling as always at the sheer mechanical perfection of the creature’s minute, clockwork movements. Her striped abdomen pulsing rhythmically, dusted all over with pollen, her corbiculae already heavily laden, her legs working constantly to consolidate what she has foraged. She’ll carry it back to the hive to sustain her sisters in their endless, perpetual industry.
Seth looks down at the hive. “Why?” he asks, strickenly.
That’s ok. That’s the way of things. There’s nothing about him I’d trade.
This afternoon when I returned home from the surgery, I found Sherlock in the driveway—the winter-blooming honeysuckle, wintersweet, I think, is its common name—that we planted not long after we moved into the cottage was finally blooming, and for the first time. Sherlock told me that sometimes it takes years for them to flower. Thick-petaled, almost waxy, pale yellow flowers with deep purple centres on bare branches, positively swarming with fat, furry bees. Winter bees! Bees in fur coats! I didn’t know such a thing existed. I expressed my surprise to Sherlock.
Perhaps not. Interesting.
Sherlock is in his shed, smoke coming from his chimney and the smell of his wood fire is one of my favourite things on a day like this. There was a frost last night, and the garden is under a fine layer of silvery ice.
Sherlock loves the eager look in Seth’s eyes, how fascinated he is by the bees. He watches as the boy lifts the honey super off the top and puts it down on the grass, and then smokes the bees in the deeper brood box. Then he takes the smoker, and watches patiently, as Seth lifts each frame, examines it, eliciting his observations, prompting  where he needs to, and keeping watch over the bees, brushing them gently away with his fingers as Seth slides the frames gently back into place.
“Why not? You’re as sharp as ever. Might be a good…”
“He came into the clinic this morning with a pretty nasty burn on his forearm. How did you know about the eye?”
Today he seems perfectly normal—he’s checked the hives for mites, watered the garden. I can see him now through the windows in his potting shed, sitting at his workbench, bent over his manuscript. He’s said nothing to me about the diagnosis.
At this, the boy had gasped, and then, abashed, he’d slid out of his seat to come forward, pulling off his scraggly grey beard and doffing his cap to fall heavily into the seat next to Sherlock’s, his hands twisting the gray mess of the beard in his lap, his eyes downcast.
“It’s something you can still do, Sherlock, if you wanted to,” I told him, “but it’s never been all you are.”
Sherlock can’t look at him.
His state when I got home, though, told a different story. I found him in quite changed— lying on the sofa, twitchy with tremor, stiff and sullen, alert but idle, the house dark and chill around him. It didn’t take a genius for deduction to see that he hadn’t taken his medication, or to guess that his lunch would be untouched in the refrigerator.
I can’t deny that it warmed me.
Apparently, not so for Sherlock, though. he’s gone! On the case!
“Yes, they are. That’s good news. We’ll leave them to it. There’s a good chance they can get themselves queenright. If they do it themselves, their queen will be stronger, and her wildness will ensure genetic diversity in the colony, making them more resistant to parasites and disease. We’ll swap a frame of brood and eggs from another hive to keep the workers foraging and nursing, and then give them a few weeks. If they aren’t successful, we can be prepared to install a queen ourselves.”
Since then, it’s been one fatal mistake after another—too many deductions or not enough deductions—all of it culminating in this flood of suffocating emotion, buffeting him without respite. He wants what he can’t have, and now he’s allowed his own inescapable chemical defect to blind and shackle him.
the roads leading to a castle
Two days later, Sherlock stands on the tarmac of a private airfield.
“Get dressed.”
John forgave him, but Sherlock knows he can’t forget. He’s never deserved John. It wasn’t a miracle, it was a cheap trick, and he underestimated the toll.
Sherlock’s eyes flicker open.
“John?” he said to me, without turning. He paused uncertainly for a moment, tilted his head, and then, hesitantly, “I’m sorry. For... The case.”
I could not have finished this story without the immeasurably kind encouragement and help of  doctornerdington, who loved it, and made me believe in it and in myself. The gift of her help is honestly one of the most important and essential gifts anyone has ever given me. I love you so, so much, Doc, and I am eternally and profoundly grateful that you are my friend. I am lucky.
Sherlock tells John jokes and fairy tales, pleased when the tightness in his face breaks. He locks John’s laugh—the sound of it—away in his mind where he’ll always have it. He considers telling John more than just his name. He considers telling John the only thing there is left to tell him. He considers leaving John with the actual words.
“Dear Mr. Holmes,” they’d begun,
Sherlock is so quiet. He answers me, but initiates nothing. He hasn’t been out in the garden, even. I asked him if he wanted me to have Seth do anything, and he just shook his head. He’s been— shaky, blank and, I don’t know. I found him yesterday afternoon in the passageway between the kitchen and the stairs just standing there as if frozen. When I touched him, he came to life like I'd woken him from a dream. He almost seemed startled. I asked if he was ok, and he said “A little tired, I think” his voice absolutely flat.
“Alright,” John says at last, smiling faintly to himself, “I’ll go.”
If his alibi was solid, Sherlock would be very, very surprised indeed.
“Queenless.” Sherlock tells John, gesturing, after another bite.
He could not deny to himself that he’d been afraid. He’d spent months coming to terms with the reality that his body was failing. That his mind was failing his body. He’d spent months shaking and freezing and feeling numb and tired and trying to...
I rounded the gate to find Amberley coming down the gravel drive towards me, looking very ill and careworn indeed.
“What have you noticed about the hive so far?”
“Yes, yes.” He he said, thoughtful now… and suspiciously evasive, “Very interesting, John. This seemed at first like a quite tedious tale, but now it seems rather interesting indeed. You’ve missed absolutely everything, of course but…”
And it was always Sherlock he thought of. Why, John understood not, but it immensely soothed him. God, he wanted the man-he needed him. But it was too late, wasn’t it?
Didn’t Sherlock know what to do?  John always thought he knew what to do.
They were each other’s savior, indeed.
To maybe hold his hands on a cold winter morning.
His meetings with Sherlock were sparse, weeks after weeks would go by without meeting him. John’s insomnia was back. Mary complained about his mood often, but nobody noticed all the meals left untouched.
I suggest listening to Olafur Arnalds' Reminiscence while reading this, so you may have the same experience as I did while I wrote the chapter ;)
John only heard half the sentence, but shifted off the barstool, leaving his drink. He looked through the crowd to a distant seating area, away from the flashing colors, which seemed like an inviting place to sulk.
“Two years
John had no address, no phone number.
Mrs. Hudson broke down into her handkerchief, sniffing loudly while Greg Lestrade looked red-faced from post-crying as he stiffly leaned against the wall. All there was left was the media to find out. The camera flashes would invade the hospital premises. Then, the news would be all over the papers for everyone to see. Would they cry too?
A cardiograph displaying several tiny spikes and lines, indicating life. His John was living.
Then there was one corpse which was petite in height with a hole a hole punctured at the forehead. Clean and accurate. Only capable of being done by someone with immense military precision.
If anything, he wanted to destroy the morgue. Because, tonight, he felt lost in a state of despair. Tonight, he felt one amongst those grieving humans. Suddenly they didn’t seem like the meaningless faces seen as you passed by in a hospital.
Why couldn’t Mycroft stop this? Why couldn’t he be a competent older brother?
He couldn’t understand yet, he understood perfectly. It truly was a
Sherlock laughed at his own joke. He looked at the couple again. Maybe he knew them.
The second hand moved seven more times, gliding under the glass, in rotary fashion, moving past numbers that represented the many seconds which turned into minutes, minutes which turned into hours that John had spent outside the doors of the bar, lost in thoughts of Mary, which incited certain unwanted feelings inside of him.
“Mrs. Hudson!” He yelled, scrambling frantically around the room.
Is this what John had felt in the two years of his absence? But he’d been there every second on that very absence watching over John, protecting him. So, what went wrong? Sherlock had failed to keep the man he loved so, so much alive. To keep him smiling.
“John!” Sherlock pounded hard on the door.
After Sherlock leaves John at the bar, tragedy strikes.
Please-John. My, John.” He cried onto the mattress.
Sherlock dropped himself beside John before wrapping his arms around the shorter man and buried his face into the humid warmth of John’s coat collar. His tears just would not cease as he cried alongside John, cradling the man in his arms.
“Just one more…m-miracle, John.” A painful laugh arose from his throat and he felt as if he was about to choke on his own words. He heard feet behind him shift slowly.
He thought of the pool where they’d met Moriarty and the bomb that’d been strapped to him and days leading to Sherlock’s artificial death. The ghost of his fingers, still held a sort of temperature within his palm when they were running through the streets of London, hand in hand, making their directionless escape. A sudden surge of adrenaline conquered him. He reminisced about the death, which had torn his soul to pieces. It should’ve known his desires right then; shouldn’t have denied it and tried running from them. He knew better, yet-
Maybe emotions really were disadvantageous.
“John?” He croaked out at the blackness ahead of him.
But this was worse. And it was too late.
Sherlock wanted to destroy the machine and pull out the wires He wanted to rip the bandages off of John and kiss him. Would that bring him back?
His voice broke as he gasped for breath
John would’ve laughed, thinking of Sherlock visiting the bar just to ‘get off’ but John suddenly felt like he knew why, as if he’d heard the unspoken part of the Sherlock’s response. The words hit him like stone, gutting him.
Sherlock felt a shiver as John pronounced his name.
“John, I love you!” Sherlock shouted against the wood. His lungs left out of air as the words seemed to have been ripped out of him. The tears were rushing out like a waterfall. They were unending.
The corpse had John’s face. His sandy brown hair stained in blood. The caring and kind blue eyes rolled in its sockets draped by half-open eyelids, mouth slightly agape.
“No, just stop. Where did you keep it?”
An exhausted breath escaped him and he gasped through his aching throat. He was still crying as he laughed in disbelief.
It circled once.
I thought…you were dead
What he wouldn’t do to hear John again.
“John-my, John. My beloved John. My one and only John. I’m sorry. So sorry.” Sherlock whispered. In reply, John shook his head, wheezing out breaths. “I just-“John just couldn’t find his words. He didn’t want to be freed from Sherlock. Some non-existing had broken in him.
He didn’t want to hear the wails nor the sobs within the waiting room. He wanted to hear Mrs. Hudson and John, as they happily conversed in the mornings.
“It’s a hobby of mine.”
Separation
But suddenly, the insides of his chest gave an electrifying jolt, transfixing him on the spot. A pair of blue-gray irises were starring back; unblinking, unwavering.
Reunion
“You’re here for a case?” John asked, trying to ease the silence.
He pushed his way through the drunk, irritated dancers towards the dark corner, awestruck. He began to wonder if it was an illusion, just like when he was seeing them after Sherlock’s death.
“It-It’s John. He’s locked himself in that room!” She cried, attempting to twist the knob of the door which had sounds of sobbing amongst the sounds of rummaging and yells of frustration.
“Any business here?” Sherlock voiced, averting his gaze from John, and glanced at something to distract him, lips pursed tightly. His disposition hardened, trying to keep calm as John stood inspecting him. He sure hadn’t expected John and it seemed he wasn’t expecting Sherlock here either.
His mind conjured up images of the many corpses he’d seen on his cases; dismembered limbs along with multiple organ deprived bodies. They weren’t frightening at all. It was nothing new.
“Mind moving, if ‘yer not gonna order anything?”
He breathed heavily, clenching his fists. This was worse than Sherlock’s fake death. He was alive, yet he wasn’t with him. John could grieve, yet the tears didn’t come.
He sat on one of the unoccupied barstools at the very far corner, distant from the drunk swaying presences, his hands rubbing his throbbing temples. He shut his eyes, tightly and let out a tired, exasperated sigh. He knew the dejection and the depression all too well. It was coming back.
Sherlock turned to him, brows furrowed slightly.
John approached the very embodiment of the man in his dreams, his daily thoughts, nightmares, what not.
Standing amidst the blank bleached walls that reeked off misery and gut-wrenching anticipation, he really, really hoped it was all just a nightmare. Countless times, he’d been here, such that he practically know the place like the back of his hand. He knew the morgue the best, like an old friend. It would be ‘Christmas’ every time he’d walk through those doors on a case. Sherlock never felt anything navigating through the hallways and thought little of the grief-stricken faces he’d see. But this time it was very different.
Sherlock still had tears running down his face and his throat felt hoarse and dry like sandpaper. The ache was still traversing through his form more now than ever.
The images of the corpses were back. Yet all of them looked like John; dismembered limbs amongst the burned, charred flesh. Yet all of them had that hole on their head.
Sherlock suddenly felt like he’d been dropped down a rabbit hole, drifting between a plethora of twists and turns of confusion.
"She said that it is cool that we have a child."
Sorry its been a while guys! Thankyou for all the support your comments mean a lot to me! So keep going with them if you like it! Enjoy!!
That Saturday Sherlock was excited, he had wanted to do something nice for him and John, but had felt unsure of what to do. Today Felix was 7 months old exactly, and Sherlock decided he could look on the internet for ideas to do with what he might do for the occasion. He had found out that although it was meant for a seven year anniversary, the present to give was wool or copper. He assumed John knew about this tradition, and got extremely excited at the prospect of finding something perfect. so the day before whilst John was at his hockey practice, he had phoned up all the antique dealers in the area and found what he thought was the perfect gift for the occasion, and had it delivered to him the next morning. It was a small wooden box with intricate carvings painted in a copper coloured paint, with copper clasps and a tiny copper key. When you opened it up, there was a small copper music box, which after being wound up, played the opening to 'Violin Concerto in E minor, Op. 64', by Mendelssohn, the composer Felix was named after. Sherlock thought that him and John would give it to Felix that evening, and spent the entire morning pacing around waiting for it to arrive, and when it did, (luckily John was out as he wanted it to be a surprise for him too) he looked around the room panic stricken. What was he going to do about wrapping paper? Sherlock looked over to Felix who was happily playing on the carpet with Sherlock's shoes and some pencils which were lying strewn around, he subtly hid the present behind his back to get past Felix and put it under his own pillow on his bed, as he had no doubt the child was clever enough to spot he had something in his hand and wish to play with it immediately.
I have heard of something referred to as 'The Friend Zone' which when explained to me seemed to be exactly the predicament you find yourself in.
John looked across at Sherlock just as his eyes were illuminated with a burst of shining colour. His friend turned to him and smiled before looking back at the sky, obviously captured by it.
Comment if you like it or want to see anything happen to the characters! Would love to hear your feedback! :) Thanks so much for reading!!!
“Sherlock! I gave you a list! What happened to ‘buy the things we needed’.... off the list!”
“At least your brother understands that a baby has a need for things other than tea and unidentifiable stuff you found in a shop!”
"A 'Jack the Ripper'." Sherlock announced.
For example I did an experiment when I was six that measured the weight of different species of frogs brains.
"I- I don't know- know where we are." He admitted, scrunching up his face with confusion.
Brr it’s cold today!! ;)
"We have to walk?" He asked grumpily.
The pair ran, John holding Felix to him tightly as Sherlock (being the faster of the two) was practically dragging John behind him. They just made the train a few seconds before the doors closed and as they did, the pair paused for a second, breathing in a sigh of relief. Haphazardly making their way through the carriage, they got plenty of stares from the people curious at the latecomers. At last they found a couple of seats in the last carriage and sat down to prepare for the long journey.
“Yes.” Sherlock said as if it was obvious.
“And Sherlock, he looks the same doesn’t he?”
“What? This white piece of fabric...stitched into this odd shape? What eve-?” He said holding the material up and trying to make sense of what they would do with it. He shoved in back, and kept looking through the bags and then looked up at Sherlock again, in disbelief.
Once they had finished looking over the photos John helped his mother make the dinner and he set the table. They were just sitting down to eat when the doorbell rang out.
John groaned. "Anderson? Great. Why on earth Mike hangs out with him. Mike's actually okay! But Anderson..." He shook his head.
One minute left, John had the ball and ran with it, only to have it tackled off of him, leaving him angry at himself. He used his anger to push himself towards the player and he knocked the ball out of his stick's reach and into his own and curved around, following the edge of the pitch down towards the goal. As the goal loomed in the distance John heard the cries of the last few seconds being counted down and he knew he only had one option, and so he hit it with all his might towards the goal, where it sharply just made it past the goalkeeper and with the force that John had flung it, bounced into the back of the net at the top of the goal. There was a fraction of the continued silence from the crowd before they erupted into cheers and clapping.
"Oh. Well that's goo-"
"Well we aren't! How about Rufus?"
“Birth- What.”  Sherlock stuttered, looking over at John. His mind raced, but within a couple of seconds it had dawned on him, through his deductions that John had not told him of his birthday.
“Sherlock, come on it’s my birthday, you can’t be annoyed with me on my birthday!” He grinned, trying to snap his friend out of his silly mood.
"He'll love it." Molly assured, giving him a soft smile, which he returned.
"Um, Sherlock- what are you doing?" John asked in amusement.
You are thinking from my manner of speech that i go to a Public School.
'Great' John thought. 'We have about three useful baby gros and an abundance of incredibly useless baby suits.'
"Well I'm John, and I've got a roommate, um, Sherlock, but he's... not in at the moment."
"Nah, i'm really not." John said, shrugging it off smiling.
"Do you... want to go see him play? Have you ever seen him play?"
“Mmm?” Sherlock mumbled whilst picking up a small screw which he had obviously missed from the cot, and hurriedly putting it in his pocket where John wouldn’t see.
“Certainly not. Now get dressed so we can go do birthday things!”
:D lol
"Jack the Ripper! After he's killed all the prostitutes." Sherlock beamed, "Doesn't he look excellent."
“Sherlock.” John sighed, “Look, I don’t quite understand why you want to keep him, but, but, well- we just can’t.”
"Look. I'll show you how." She declared, before coming round to the other side of the sofa, Felix's eyes following her all the way around.
“I want to do nothing Harry, you know I don’t want a fuss.”
"Well. Yeah, I just didn't want to lie to you. I hoped you wouldn't care-" He looked so sad Harry felt sorry for him and she stood up and pulled him into a big hug.
Sorry it's been so long! Here's a slightly longer chapter to make up for it! :) Please leave a comment if you like it!!! enjoy!
"Yes. I shall have this sorted by tomorrow. Without Mycroft's help!"
"Crime scene do not disturb. There is too much packing for school happening here right now."
“I don’t know! um, baby? What do you want?” Asked John looking flustered.
With this, she leapt from his bed and whilst humming went and began to fill up the kettle for tea.
“Fine.” He said, moodily taking a slurp of tea.
"Oh- well no, really it's not trouble to look after Felix! My pleasure, really, he so adorable! How is he?" She asked smiling as they headed towards the school building, being pulled along by the crowd going the same way.
Buuut, how did you know she was going to die??
"Go into the drivers carriage, there is a lever where you can override the main settings for speed, which is underneath the main desk. After that the rest is simple. Follow the dials on the left hand side of the board."
Ohhh public school??
“And this Sherlock, same year at school?”
“Secret Service, I’m going to have to ask you to hold my child. This is an emergency and a matter of utmost importance.”
I internally shook myself, what on earth am I thinking about? I need to concentrate on my work. But even trying to concentrate I could hear her laughing at something he said to her, laughing at something I should be laughing at.
I amndb likle a kingf of the woirld!!
Enjoyyyyy! :D
After all, the names did make sense logically.
John looked over to the other bed across from him as he sat down again on the edge of his own. Sherlock was tucked under the covers, his hair the only thing which seemed to be peeking out above them. He could also see that Sherlock had his knees to his chest under the blanket and one thin white hand, clutching the outside of the blanket and sticking out of it whilst doing so. John smiled and lay down in his own bed, pulling his covers up and settling down into the soft pillow to sleep, happy his family were around him.
"Good." Sherlock said quietly, glad he had changed the subject.
“John? Wha- What’s wrong?” He looked suddenly concerned, and stopped John from walking forwards any further, by stepping in front of the pram.
This flat was a apparent “Necessity” of Sherlock’s, bought 3 years ago, (with the Holmes’s fortune) and it was “needed” for Sherlock to live when he was sick of the huge family mansion, and home from school. Inadvertently he usually lived there for the entire holiday. His parents didn't seems to care where he was, maybe they thought it boosted his independence, and so long as he was there for Christmas, Birthday’s, and other festive occasions, they turned a blind eye to his absence.
Yes. What is wrong with it?
oh right ;) well don’t you? i mean usually??
Sherlock's face dropped the minute the door clicked shut. He sat holding Felix, a little bit taken aback and disappointed. He had been hoping that John would stay in the dorm this evening, and he would sit with him and Felix for a bit, Sherlock would show John how he'd taught Felix how to point to where the liver was and where the spleen was on his own body. But there had been hockey practice and then he now had friends he would rather sit with instead. Sherlock looked down at Felix's little face looking expectantly up at him, and ruffled his hair and held him close as he leant back onto John's bed, the smell of John wafting around him. He shut his eyes and Felix did the same. Waiting for John came back was all he seemed to be doing at the moment.
He crashed through the doors of the intensive care unit where they’d kept John. He froze, seeing the sight ahead of him. He stumbled towards the bed and fell on his knees beside John.
Thrice.
The memories of their first meeting were still fresh. How fierce his loyalty had been for Sherlock, a man he’d barely known then. Unlike anything he’d seen before. It was remarkable. Extraordinary.
It was John. Distressed and hurt.
John tore his eyes off Sherlock, suddenly feeling unwanted. His heart pounded in his ears. The man who’d been on his mind and caged his heart in denial, all this time, was just in front of him. He wanted to scream in delight, almost. He wanted to grip Sherlock and bury his head into the vastness of his chest and warmth of his neck and maybe kiss him there, because Sherlock was taller.
Oh okay ;) of course you do :) just don't get caught hacking into policey stuff :P
"No. Definitely not... Charles?"
Well have a nice valentines day then! :)
"Cause we just can't Sherlock!"
“Yes.” Sherlock said, abruptly turning around to John. “We are keeping him.”
She ran across the room to her bag. After rummaging around for a couple of seconds, she returned holding a fistful of tickets.
"Yeah, just wait until at least then before any major redecorating!" John said laughing.
“We. Are all going. To a water park.”
Finally, he started to crawl towards Sherlock, but on coming to the first obstacle, a shoe of Sherlock's, instead of going around it, he picked it up and threw it, and then continued. Sherlock, with all the expressions of an overly proud parent, enthusiastically encouraged him to continue.
"You. Capable of bringing up a child?" Mycroft said with a disbelieving half smile.
For Sherlock, he didn't know quite how he felt about the names John had just used. 'Daddy and Papa?' He didn't know what the nicknames meant. He was sure it must mean something. That John saw them as a pair? Something similar? He took a glance over at John's creased up and worried looking face. Of course they were a pair! They're bringing up Felix together aren't they! It just never occurred to Sherlock that they needed names other than their own for Felix to use in the future. He had always referred to his own as Father, he had never used the more childish 'Daddy' or 'Papa' but of course it made sense to be called them, wouldn't it?
“Well perhaps you’re slightly different, but don’t worry Johnny i’m sure yours has plenty of other qualities.”
"Yes." Sherlock said proudly, pointing at the baby's hand with the stopwatch in it. "He even understands when to press it. Isn't he clever John!"
"I don't see a relationship between our mental state and bringing up a child?"
"After Einstein. Albert Einstein. Lot to live up to don't you think? What if he doesn't like science?"
He had been avidly drinking since they snuck into the club through a fire escape at the back about an hour ago, but the mixture of beer and the few vile coloured shots he had been persuaded to do, were starting to go to his head. A fact he wasn't particularly fussed about, as he wanted, (to some extent) to drown his sorrows in the alcohol. Make his mind stop fixating on the argument from earlier, which it was perpetually doing.
"Sherlock." He lifted his head up to face him again, and found that Sherlock was staring back. His ice blue orbs reflecting back at John his own pain. "It didn't mean anything... She kissed me." John found himself saying, not understanding quite why he felt the need to justify the previous action. Sherlock merely stared back, and John no longer being able to take the look in his friend's eyes, looked anywhere but into them.
"They keep them entertained."
Go on... try it... ;)
"Hello! Come in!" John sang cheerfully, suddenly nervous as to what Molly would make of the whole situation.
"You see you wind it up here, and then you open it here-"
"No, certainly not. Where is she?" He said getting exasperated at her frustrating questions.
Sherlock spoke, playing to John's emotional side by flashing him a sad and wounded look.
"Okay, a four month old child, who needs constant attention!" Said John, feeling like the only rational one in the room, and like he was being blatantly ignored by the brothers.
“You know I bet he is great at skiing, streamlined as he is.”
“Harr-“
“I can see that.”
Ah bad luck :( maybe another nice murder will come up :) cheer you up!!
Sherlock followed him dutifully out of the station and onto the little country road which stretched before them into the distance.
Omg Sherlock I am soooo sorry for those drunk texts from last night!! :/
John left the room, and went into the living room and picked up Felix from his cot, and put him playing with his building blocks he had on the floor. He was irritated with Sherlock, he had threatened him with something Sherlock knew that John couldn't compete with. His parents. They thought he had been spending the summer at a Holiday Adventure Camp, which would go towards his DofE award, which in truth, he wasn't even getting!
'Molly has been so great with helping us,' I thought as I looked over at her handing a toy down to Felix. We are so lucky to have her help. Why do I feel... Strange about her then? I had felt this strange feeling about her for a few days now, I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was, I liked Molly... I'm sure that I like her? Why wouldn't I? It was just that way she put her hand there, on Sherlock's arm. And she keeps looking at him like, she fancies him or something. That sideways glance look she just gave him, and the way she keeps bowing her head every time he speaks to her. I didn't like It.... But. Then this feeling... Was it? No, that's absurd! It can't be jealously! Why on earth would I feel jealous? I don't feel jealous! Or do I? I looked back up to the pair of them sitting there. They are too close. That was my immediate thought.
“Harry wai-” John feebly protested, as she pulled on the handle and swung open the door, revealing Sherlock with key poised, holding onto a little bundle in his arms.
Can i ask you something???? :)
"Do you want Felix to have fun?"
"I need to find one. Nobody will bloody work for us! We are too young, or it's inconvenient, or I'm 'too rude'! Nobody will do it!"
There was that lovely moment of peaceful quietness as we took our first sips, relishing the tea. It's strange how whatever irritations or stresses you have in your life, you should never underestimate the power a cup of tea has in putting them to rest for a while, and the clarity of mind it can bring I thought as I relaxed back into the sofa.
They set off down the street, and started walking towards the shopping centre. Sherlock was walking at his normal, long stride, fast paced walk, when he suddenly realised how far behind John was.
"I just got your text... You came to the match?"
“Harry!”
"Ooh, look at you lying to mum and dad! Proper teenager you're becoming! You rascal! What have you been up to then?" She joked, punching him in the arm and grinning, which made him smile too.
“Um, Sherlock?”
That's weird!! :)
I clearly ... don't want anything getting in the way of Sherlock doing his part towards looking after Felix. Good. Now I had that in order. I realised that must be why I'm jealous. And so in the words of my father. I had to move on and get over it. Worrying and debating won't help anyone. Taking in one last breath of the fresh, cool air, I wandered back inside, clear with my reasoning.
"And children actually entertain themselves with... These?" He tentatively held the toy up.
okay well then Sir i can do everything ;)
"Sherlock? Have you been up all night?" John asked, as he looked over his friends face. Suddenly feeling guilty at his own full night of sleep.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hi John." She creased up her face. "Why are you at Sherlock's flat? You, you were kinda mysterious on the phone? What is going on?"
Five minutes later and she was back, holding some materials in her hands.
"One in school?"
How ddid you know that!!!! Woah thats like mind reading!
Is there such a thing?
No way! Like London tube? As in the underground?? :o
John looked up from his page, blinking in trying to adjust to Sherlock from the book.
"No... We aren't."
"She wants to meet him, she loves it though!"
"No. Oliver?"
"Th-thankyou Molly." Sherlock stuttered, taken aback by her generosity for once.
"Do people give these toys to their children John?!"
"He is the most adorable child!" She exclaimed, "he looks just like Sherlock!" She looked surprised, and glanced between Sherlock and the baby.
"Sherlock, be serious! Come on, how could we possibly take care of a five month old child wh-"
A few minutes later John and Sherlock were still staring at Felix with glee, and John, still wiping the tears from his eyes, put him back on the floor and the boy crawled around, picking up various objects and throwing them out of his path when he didn’t want them. The pair of them looked like the most proud parents in the world, their faces plastered with silly grins which radiated all the warmth and love they had for their son.
The school had a rule that if using the sports field, you must be in at least pairs, as the field was half hidden from view from the school building, and the rule was implemented after a nasty injury took place on the field to a lone runner when John was in Year 8, and henceforth meant there were serious punishments to be given if anyone was found alone on the sports field.
With a couple of minutes to go, their team were losing the game and John was getting frustrated. He was starting to feel tired and therefore flagging and losing his concentration and focus he had started with. He gripped his hockey stick and ran towards the ball, determined to win the game. Using his last reserves of energy he sprinted and flung it to another player who hit it into the goal making it an equal score for both teams.
"Of course I like the baby, he's one of the cutest I've ever seen!"
10pm:
He sat up in bed and yawned, and after rubbing his eyes and his vision slowly beginning to creep in, he could see his sister grinning at him from the foot of his bed.
Close enough to touch each other, John thought, staring at him.
Well that's cool I guess! Like a private detective ;)
Once Sherlock got back, he dumped the bags on the floor and collapsed into his chair. John hearing him come in brought the baby through and put him on the floor, where he gave him the union jack cushion of John’s own chair, for the baby to hug. John looked over at the pile of shopping on the floor, suddenly wary as to what Sherlock had bought, he went over and started to root around in the bags.
"Did you hear that? Felix, your Dad likes the names." Putting the stress on the name, with a happy tone playing in his voice. Felix just smiled and looked with adoring eyes between the two of them.
"No why Mol- Oh my god! Is sh-"
John picked up a small pair of blue, denim dungarees and put them in his already growing basket, he had sent Sherlock off in the shop twenty minutes ago to find some pairs of socks for Felix, a seemingly simple task, and he hadn't seen him since. Looking around, slightly concerned, he spotted his friend's tall figure over the other side of the shop, behind an aisle. As he approached him he could see that he also had a basket, a basket independent to John's own basket, which could never be a good sign. As John looked closer, he could see that it was filled to the top with dark looking garments which he couldn't quite identify.
He mumbled a reply that John couldn't hear and hung his head.
"Yeah, the one who doesn't speak a lot and spends all her time in the art department. She said she wouldn't really be in our dorm much." She looked slightly sad as she mentioned it.
"Hey, I was just wondering if you wanted to come down with me to see some of the guys from the team, they're all in the common room we were just gonna play cards or something."
"Greg. Greg Lestrade." He said giving a small smile to John.
I know it's fine.
John didn't realise they were going to try to sneak into a club, and he immediately felt nervous as they were only 16 and he wasn't sure about whether he wanted to try his luck getting in or not. Then again, he thought about his fight with Sherlock and his anger just started boiling up again, no. He would go out. He deserved this, he needed to show Sherlock he didn't care what he thought. He also needed to have fun, something Sherlock didn't seem to want him to have.
“What?”
"Yes. This is Felix. Where is Molly?" Sherlock asked impatiently.
Oooh sarcasm ;) and yeah but barely alive!! My head is killing me I get the worst hangovers :(
“Well i’m not planning on-”
I can't, but I have mastered the technique of typing without looking.
Heya all you wonderful people! Thankyou so much for reading! I'm trying to be better with updating so here's another chapter for you! I have planned out the next few as well so I know where the story is headed ;) but you guys will just have to wait and find out.... :D LOVE YOU ALL! Comment if you like it or want to see something in it :) Xxxx
John smiled wider and looked down at Felix,
“Oh, god. What are we going to do about the child then? Sherlock?”
John picked up his slightly unnecessary water bottle from the side of the court, and started to amble up to the changing rooms along with all the other guys, feeling desperate for some sort of physical activity, after the lack of running he had just been doing during the game. He looked over his shoulder out to the field and the running track longingly, hoping that he might spot some small group out there, bearing the weather, but no luck. Nobody wanted to be out running in this grey and drizzly autumnal time. John sighed and took a sip of water and carried on walking to the changing rooms.
"Jesus...I'm sick of this. It's enough that I have to put up with your childish behaviour half the time, now you're trying to control me and what I do in my spare time."
She was beckoned over by one of the guys in the group, and came over grinning and batting her long and fake eyelashes at the attention, obviously a little tipsy due to her staggering a little as she made her way into the centre of the group. The group eventually made their way back to the dance floor, bringing the girl over with them. As they all danced, the guys jovially tried to push her and John together, by 'accidentally' shoving into them as the crowd moved. John being tipsy and carefree, didn't feel awkward, in fact was quite enjoying the attention he was getting off of the girl and his friends and he began to laugh along with it. The girl seemed to be thoroughly enjoying herself too, laughing and throwing back her long shining hair over her shoulder as she danced, running her hands through it and eyeing up John. So when she asked him loudly over the music, moving close to his ear, if he'd go outside with her so she could have a cig, he happily obliged and dutifully followed her out the back via the fire escape where they had originally entered from.
Ah what? :)
"Come quickly."
"Well I wasn't entirely truthful... I haven't been at a camp for the summer. I've been um, staying with a friend-"
Sherlock crossed his arms and then after a moments pause, turned round to the direction of the kitchen.
“It’s John’s birthday today Sherlock! Didn’t he tell you? Silly billy Johnny”
"Sherlock."
Oh its just that thing you know that you did when you were a kid to each other at the start of the month ;)
“They know nothing John. Nothing. Don't pay attention to people like that.”
"Well may-"
"After his match, this evening."
“That was a silly, bloody feud between you and Mycroft!"  Said John, “And now we have a child out of it!”
Huh? Never heard of that! :)
"Well I'm just not interested in-"
"Wow, so that was when you went to the archery centre then? Look at that Nick." She marvelled, handing the photo over. "How exciting!"
