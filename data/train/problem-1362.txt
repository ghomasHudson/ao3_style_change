"Fuckkkk." The single word, a breathless groan, in Sherlock's deep baritone voice. John felt a jolt go up his entire body and his cock twitched uncomfortably.
But no. That's not what Sherlock wanted. John set the toy on the floor and leaned in toward the detective, licking a stripe up his perineum. Sherlock shuddered. Encouraged, John ran his tongue directly over the detective's puckered hole.
I nodded tersely as he slowly slid the drawer open and dug around in it, obviously relishing the attention. Finally, with flourish, he procured a small tube of lubricant and-
"Yes," Sherlock snapped. "Obviously you're too dim to have seen the face someone makes when they have a breakthrough."
Sherlock nodded, eyes closed. "It just feels... Give me just a moment." They laid in silence for a few seconds before Sherlock finally muttered, "Okay. Faster."
Suddenly, John's grip tightened almost painfully around the detective's cock and he was tugging, up and down and up and down and fuck, Sherlock was cumming-
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: Oh, well actually your deduction is a bit off Mr Holmes...I happen to be an INFJ personality.
John sighed as he got out the pan, hoping it sounded irritated instead of relieved. Even if Sherlock knew John had heard him, they weren't having that discussion. Yet.
Sherlock Holmes: sorry I'm no good at *hic* conversation. I tend to rub people the wrong way. But *hic* I rub Jawn all the right ways. *giggles again*
"Keep the change," Sherlock said, voice dripping with lust. John shuffled as his cock stirred again.
John nodded, bowing his head in a desperate attempt to stay completely still. Christ, it was difficult...
As if to prove his point, Sherlock clenched his arse, and John's hips bucked. A string of swear words poured out of his mouth and he grabbed Sherlock's bony hips. Sherlock slowly stood until he was almost empty, and he sat down again, faster this time.
Sherlock's eyes flashed. "I am plenty reasonable, John. Reasonable enough for both of us, luckily for you."
This is a conversation between teen!nerd!wearing lingerie underneath clothing!Castiel (Destiel, jock!Dean?) and Sherlock Holmes.
John tried to tune out the singing, he really did, but then eight words were breathily sung into the microphone and the doctor dropped the can of tomato soup he was holding.
"What?" asked Sherlock frantically, stomach flipping. He didn't dare open his eyes lest he see John holding back laughter at some secret joke at his expense.
Sherlock pulled out and removed his shirt. “Missionary position, Mr. Watson. You are now ready to be fucked.”
Sherlock looked up again, slightly impatient. "Yes, I'm aware, John. Certain words stir memories for me, some stronger than others. Unless you want me to rip off my clothes and jack off in the living room, I'm going to refrain from saying it."
John fought the urge to deny it, but he knew better. Of course it was a bloody big deal, they'd had a bit of a snog and admitted feelings for each other.
Sherlock's cheeks reddened. "My mental capacities are much higher than most peoples'. Physical stimulus is unnecessary for me to achieve orgasm, and ejaculation only occurs occasionally. I don't need to touch myself because I can manipulate my brain to produce the pleasurable chemicals found during orgasm."
A low, guttural moan, several octaves lower than Sherlock's regular speaking voice. It was the single most erotic thing John had ever heard, and that was saying quite a bit. Almost without thinking, John placed the bottle haphazardly on the kitchen table, walking hesitantly into the living room.
Holmes let out a snort. “Point well made, Mr. Watso- John. Here’s my number.” He pulled a phone out of his pocket and typed a few numbers. John patted his jacket, trying to find his.
Sherlock shrugged, eyes sparkling. "I'm fine. It will work itself out. I'd drink a glass of water before you go to bed or you'll have an awful hangover tomorrow." He leaned in to my ear, lips brushing against my earlobe. "Happy Christmas."
Two more strikes, just below the others. "I want you to list every offense this week, and the number of occurrences. Each occurrence gets one blow." John's voice was louder now that he was in control; more commanding. Sherlock shuddered, wracking his suddenly surprisingly blank brain.
Sherlock Holmes: Well, I have news: The Lestrange killings- it was their butler after all. So cliché- I regret taking that case.
Slowly, as if unwrapping a particularly exciting Christmas present, John peeled off Sherlock's pants. Sherlock shut his eyes just before John let out a small chuckle.
"On the bed. Spread eagle," John commanded, voice slightly hoarse. Sherlock scrambled up to obey, laying down as requested. John started with Sherlock's left hand- grabbed his wrist and yanked, putting it through a slip knot and pulling taut. He repeated the process with the remaining three limbs until Sherlock felt very exposed and very, very hard.
The detective cried out, head falling further down. John pulled out quickly and thrust back in, gyrating his hips again.
Quickly John spat Sherlock out. "I want you to fuck my mouth, Sherlock," he said hoarsely, immediately swallowing Sherlock again.
John chuckled breathlessly, slamming again and again against Sherlock's prostate. "I'm gonna cum. Tell me-"
Sherlock pulled back, coughing, immediately. "What, did I do something wrong?" he managed hoarsely. "I tried to do what you did but I couldn't quite remember- I could try again, if you-?"
John felt his arousal wilt. The word seemed vaguely familiar, but it caused his balls to shrink up inside his body. “Why the hell would I know where you live?”
John had to close his eyes and breathe deeply through his nose to refrain from doing just what Sherlock was describing. "Jesus... What else?"
John gasped but stayed silent, body quickly adjusting to the intrusion. Sherlock pumped his finger in and out of John slowly, warming his body up. He added another digit then, and John cried out, but Sherlock kept the steady pace at which he was finger-fucking John. Now Sherlock began to scissor him, adding a third finger. By now John was getting used to it and was meeting Sherlock’s fingers with his hips eagerly.
John padded over to the toilet, grateful that Sherlock never put the lid down. Not that he had any reason to; he didn't have a girlfriend or a fiancée or a wife. He quietly unzipped his trousers, glad that the water pounding on the tile floor was so loud.
"Maybe this is why all your girlfriends leave you," Sherlock chuckled, moving his attention to my scrotum.
Sherlock sipped his coffee, buying himself a few more seconds. "You've probably noticed I'm not good at talking about... emotions. Feelings. What most people would regard as the 'important' things. And this... this is the most important thing to me. My relationship with you, that is. I didn't want to mess it up by saying the wrong thing, which I did anyway, but I decided to let you make the first move. Which you didn't. It was a very poorly enacted plan on my part."
John's jaw twitched at he filed that under his Things To Talk About Later compartment. "But... you have feelings for me then?"
John hurriedly tucked himself back into his pants and pulled up his trousers, biting his lip and creeping over to the bathroom door.
Even he knew it was an awful lie. Sherlock barked out a laugh, lifting his feet and turning so he was laying on the couch. "That's the best lie you could come up with?"
Hiro Hamada: Well, I take the machines out of my brain, and actually make them. Yeah, I stopped the world from being sucked into the equivalent of a black hole. Or crushed by microbots of my own creation. Or blown up by battlebots. Should I continue?
Once Sherlock had relaxed a bit, John's hand began to move, slowly at first, and then quickly. The noise Sherlock made when John accidentally brushed his prostate made the hairs on the back of John's neck stand up.
Sherlock slowly climbed onto his bed, spreading his legs a bit and resting his head against his pillow. He rubbed his hands together, spreading and warming the lube until he was satisfied. Slowly, he pumped his stiff red cock, mouth opening in silent pleasure. "I like to think... About you... Gagging me with your..." His eyes opened as he gasped, hips bucking as he jacked himself off. "C-cock- and cumming- God... on my face-!"
John had almost gotten the decency to turn around and leave the flat as quickly as possible when there was another sound from the chair.
With one last sharp thrust he cried out, cumming deep down John's throat. John swallowed and swallowed, milking him of every drop.
I hardly had enough time to register that before his lips were around me and in, in, in, Jesus he was taking me deep, tight and hot and wet and tongue swirling-
A T-Rex Who Speaks Human: None taken, sir. Well, I must move on, more people to meet and greet. Goodbye.
John stood on his wobbly legs, hands reaching out and taking Sherlock's shoulders. The way Sherlock looked up at John from between his legs was almost enough to get John ready for round two.
"Those all sound... manageable. How about actual sex? Do you like giving or receiving blowjobs? Or anal sex?"
His toes tingled and warmth spread up his legs, his cock was twitching, God, would it be worth starting over just to cum?
Sherlock Holmes: OI! That bloody hurt! *starts laughing hysterically, holding his bleeding and broken nose*
“Good boy,” Sherlock breathed, looking at John’s exposed body with undisguised lust. “Now turn around and grab your ankles.”
"I've told you already that you are not cumming. Do not ask again," John said sharply. The hand that had just hit Sherlock now gripped the detective's cock again, squeezing gently upwards.
Sherlock looked up immediately when the doctor returned, flagging cock twitching hopefully. John said nothing, only grabbed the lube again and quickly undressed. Without a word, John lubed up his index and middle fingers, plunging them into the detective.
Sherlock Holmes: I'm listening to the sounds of male fornication still emanating from your room, I think what you mean is am I reading. And yes. I just don't find it important.
"Then I'll be back in a mo'," John sighed, heaving himself off the bed. Sherlock smirked, stomach flipping, when he saw the tent in John's trousers. At least he was doing it right, it seemed.
John could feel his orgasm coming, but he slowed down his thrusts until he was barely moving. He leaned forward and rested his sweaty forehead on Sherlock's back.
John let out a breath he hadn’t realized he had been holding. “Oh. Erm… no, I guess not. I always wanted to be a detective,”  John admitted with a slight blush.
John tugged gently at the handle poking out of Sherlock's arse, surprised by how easily it slid out. He was very lubricated and ready. How easy it would be to just bend him over and-
Pleasantly buzzed, Sherlock and I stumbled up the stairs to the second floor, laughing at something that neither of us remembered. It wasn't until Sherlock looked up at the doorframe that I remembered.
Slowly, he pulled his fist back up, thumb sweeping over the tip of his cock, causing a quiet hiss to escape his lips. Sherlock's eyes snapped open suddenly and he leaned forward, maintaining eye contact with me as he pursed his lips and let a glob of spit fall out of his mouth and directly onto the head of his cock. It began to run down the side of his shaft until his first caught it, sweeping it up and over his tip with another brush of his long, slender thumb.
Somehow John had ended up right below Sherlock's impromptu stage, close enough to see how dilated the detective's pupils were.
John heard a shift of leather in the living room. He went to the door, one hand clutching the baby bottle and the other raised in greeting, but he quickly lowered it, shutting his eyes and turning away.
Holmes looked over his shoulder with a satisfied smirk. “Well, enemas aren’t as easy to execute as sitting down and watching crap telly.”
The sound got a dollop of lube as well, and John spread it across the textured rod. He swirled it lightly around Sherlock's slit, slowly dipping it into his urethra.
John cocked an eyebrow. Slowly, he leaned forward and ran his lips gently along Sherlock's jawline, trailing them up to his mouth and parting his lips ever so slightly. Sherlock did the same, his body practically melting into John's as his hands found the ex-soldier's cheeks.
John, still idly stroking his cock, slowly made his way to the stall. He found Sherlock exactly as he'd ordered, his perfect, round arse sticking out and his head bowed as he tried to even his breathing. John could see his very hard cock twitching against his stomach.
“Jim Moriarty rattles you?” Holmes asked with a smirk. Before John could even ask, he held up a hand to explain. “He approaches me almost daily trying to get my affection. I know his cologne, unfortunately, and he’s the only one I’ve ever smelt it on. But here you are, with Jim’s cologne on, so I deduced you walked by him, at the very least.”
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: What I see in his eyes is a depth that cannot be easily defined. Like there's something just below the surface, that under the right circumstances you might be able to see.
Through her shirt, John could see the woman's nipples hardening. Her pupils were dilated slightly, and she pressed her legs together discreetly. "You'll do almost anything just for shits and giggles?" She asked, voice slightly husky. John could almost feel the hormones floating through the air.
"Well, there's a first time for everything," John smirked, rearranging so his mouth was over Sherlock's prick and vice versa. Without so much as a word Sherlock took John's entire throbbing cock into his mouth. His throat constricted as he gagged, but impressively he didn't pull back, just sucked. "Fuckkk..." John moaned, trying not to thrust into his mouth.
Sherlock didn't seem to know John was in the room, thankfully, because the doctor was sure his emotions ran freely across his face for a few moments. Holy shit, he would have never guessed Sherlock could sing, or whatever this breathy moaning was, let alone that he would choose to sing something like this.
Sherlock was laying on the couch, hands steepled as if in prayer. He glanced up at John before closing his eyes again. "One too many Jack Daniels?"
For several seconds John stared at the cup, jaw working slightly. Finally, slowly, his blue eyes slid up to Sherlock's. His mouth had curled into a small, humorless smile. Sherlock knew that look well: John was angry. Very angry.
Sherlock Holmes: *hiccups again* Well, thanks for the advice and the liqueur, Jenah. *reaches in pocket and pulls out twenty pounds* Will this cover it?
Sherlock Holmes: You're a stranger to me. For all I know, you could be Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.
John’s head snapped up as an automatic apology sprang from his mouth. “Oh, shit! Sorry. I-” He froze midsentence, staring at the man he had almost walked directly into. His chocolate brown eyes were kind enough, but below the surface he could see a stare so blank that it made his skin crawl. “…didn’t see you there, Jim,” he finished with a strained smile.
Teen!Artist!Punk!Castiel: She wrote 'Castiel Novak is too gay to function' and I don't mind Dean saying that, but only him though
He glanced at his alarm clock. 9:49. His lips twitched when he spotted a large glass of water and a tablet sitting next to his lamp. Thoughtful, Sherlock.
"He did... stare at this one bus... heading for Surrey," the girl breathed. John could almost see it- Sherlock's lips a centimetre from hers, one hand at the base of her neck and the other stroking her lower lip. With his long, expert, wicked fingers-
John groaned as Sherlock's tongue traced his lower lip, his hips grinding up to Sherlock's. He had only been gone a night, away at a conference in Brighton. What had happened between then and now?
A particularly interesting conversation... dedicated to St. Spike, King Artoria Pendragon on ShamChat.
Hiro Hamada: *rolls eyes* I don't need a mind palace. I just learn the stuff I need. Keep it practical. You ever built a microbot? *has the small thing that hit you earlier flying around* doesn't look like much, does it? Oh trust me. This thing can crush a car. Two can topple a building. Now imagine it in the swarm. I have an army of /millions/ of those things. And yes, I made them, not stole them. And yes, I am fourteen.
Sherlock Holmes: It was great talking you, honestly, but I must be off. I have to save London, possibly the world. You know, ordinary prople things.
“Nothing.” John looked quickly down at the drain of the tub, afraid he would somehow read his mind like he seemed so able to do. He always knew who had and hadn’t studied, who copied whose notes, et cetera. No, his mind was perfectly fine unmolested by Sherlock’s prying gaze.
John was sitting back on his heels, breathing heavily. He had saliva trailing down the corner of his mouth to his chin. Just the sight of him so... used, for lack of a better word, was nearly enough to have Sherlock ready for round two.
Sherlock didn't trust himself to speak, didn't trust himself to move, afraid even a slight draft of air would send him reeling through an orgasm.
John smirked. "Quite." He went upstairs to put on some clothes before coming back down for coffee. "So are we going to talk about last night, or...?"
Sam and Dean: Dean: *checks you out* honestly I’ve seen better/ Sam: *cough* Cas * cough* *gets punched by Dean*
Sherlock's back went ram-rod straight, his mouth popping open slightly and a flush rising to his cheeks. Just as soon as he'd gasped the vibrations against his prostate ceased.
Sherlock jumped, crying out at the sudden bite of pain that jolted up his body. John had grabbed the riding crop from the wardrobe while Sherlock had been turned away, not giving any warning before his first blow.
Sherlock smiled sadly, running his slender fingers through the doctor's short blonde hair. "You should get some sleep. We can talk in the morning. Maybe have a proper snog."
And then his entire index finger was gone, sheathed deep inside Sherlock, and he let out a breathy gasp, twisting his wrist slightly. He pumped it in and out of himself for a minute, face screwed up in concentration as his wrist twisted impossibly, at least into an uncomfortable position if not bone-crushing, and then his hips were off the mattress and his cock was twitching helplessly, a moan ripping out of his throat.
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: I'm just a girl, who spends far too much time thinking about a certain criminal. That's all you really need to know.
Sherlock Holmes: Oh, FLOWERS? Is that truly necessary? Can't I just take out my cock and ram it up his-*hiccups violently*- and call it good?
“Yes. Here and now. On my desk.” Holmes’ voice was nearly hypnotic, and watching his eyes darken with lust was enthralling. God, this was fucked up, but John wanted it so badly. “Fuck,” his professor swore suddenly, closing his eyes in irritation.
Sherlock began riding John more vigorously, his head thrown back in silent ecstasy. John's hand was beginning to slow as his orgasm flew at him, and at the last second, he bucked his hips and hit Sherlock in a spot he couldn't quite reach on his own.
Sherlock stood, face going from paper white to bright pink within seconds. "John, I've sat here waiting for you for four hours!" he shouted. "I was so anxious about this conversation I had to put on two nicotine patches. I'm done waiting for you! This ENTIRE thing was staged to get you to realize I AM NOT A ROBOT. I HAVE FLESH AND BLOOD AND SEXUAL DESIRES LIKE ANYONE and damn it, I want you!"
John scooted over and patted the bed. "Make yourself comfortable. Pretend I'm not here. What do you think about when you're...?"
He closed his eyes and pulled up all the porn he'd watched. It seemed to him most people enjoyed being vocal and that the rougher the sex, the better. Sherlock felt himself shudder at the thought, whether in excitement or nerves he wasn't sure.
“What?” John felt like whining for some unknown reason. “Like you said, I’m not your student. I just signed the papers-”
To John’s surprise, Sherlock placed a pillow just below John’s nose. “Rest your head and neck; I don’t want to strain you. Yet,” he added with what sounded like a smirk, or at John hoped so.
It was the only bathroom in the flat, damn it, and he paid just as much rent as Sherlock did. It was both of their bathrooms.
John cursed himself, cursed the London traffic, and cursed his daughter (but that one he felt immediately bad about and shoved to the back of his mind) as he took the steps up to the flat two at a time. Bloody formula, he couldn't wait until Rosie was a bit older and wouldn't need to eat enriched, expensive foods.
Just as the door was closing behind him, John could swear he heard Holmes say, “Sorry about Dr. Who.”
They both held still, holding their breath, until Sherlock finally relaxed minutely. John took this as a go-ahead and slowly pushed his finger in further.
"What, this?" John gently brushed his prostate again, grinning when Sherlock's back arched off the bed.
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: So, how did you feel when you found out that he's back? Mr Moriarty, I mean.
Sherlock Holmes: Alright then. Will you come down and fetch my scarf? I'm about ready to head out but it's in my room.
"Oh, I know you will," John smiled before heading back to the kitchen, grabbing the bottle, and leaving 221B Baker Street.
John stepped forward without looking, trying to think of something snarky to text. Maybe something like ‘Some professor, hitting on his student.’… but that seemed like a low blow (maybe literally, he thought with a shudder. Damn it. He had to be gay.)
Barista:*nods* Yes, yeas it is. In about 5 minutes you will start to feel the room spin, I can tell you it won't really be pleasant.
John's eyes screwed shut and his mouth opened wide as he came inside Sherlock, and as the first spurt of hot semen erupted out of John's cock, Sherlock leaned forward and dug his teeth into John's shoulder to keep from crying out as he found his release as well.
"I told you last night. Giving oral sex and receiving anal sex. But last night's activities proved more than satisfactory."
John's hand twitched up slowly, slowly, getting closer to the source of Sherlock's problem by millimetres. Sherlock squirmed against his restraints, just wanting John to touch his prick.
John removed his blazer and undershirt first, blushing as he bared his chest. He was glad that he had some muscle at least. Next John pulled down his trousers. All he had left was his boxers now… Sherlock was smirking at him and oh God, those eyes… and that voice… Almost without thinking, John removed his pants and set them hastily in the pile of discarded clothes.
Sherlock felt his cheeks heat up. That sounded strangely possessive and it somehow pleased Sherlock. Already he realized he had sorely underestimated the pleasure that would be involved in sexual activities.
Sherlock rolled off of John, collapsing onto the couch. After several minutes of heavy breathing and shock, Sherlock reached under himself and pulled out the microphone.
Sherlock Holmes: I need to get the public's opinion on me. Keep an ear out, as they say. We don't want another Reichenbach, do we?
"Don't pretend you haven't thought about this," Sherlock smirked, reaching out and unzipping my trousers. I let out another gasp as my cock stirred.
John frowned as he closed and locked the door. Sure, it was tight quarters, but it'd do for the moment. He turned and rolled up the arms of his jumper to his elbows. He knelt down behind Sherlock, reverently kissing his ivory ass cheek.
Sherlock inhaled sharply, looking down at their point of contact. "Of course," he finally muttered, eyes flitting up to John's nervously. "I've logged your bathroom routine in my Mind Palace. Comes in handy."
John smiled into Sherlock's jawline as he pulled back and snapped forward again, barely able to contain the shudder that ran through him at the moan Sherlock made... Besides, he was tighter than anyone he'd ever been with, man or woman... Wouldn't take long at all. He could already feel his orgasm beginning to build in the back of his mind.
“I like girls,” John blurted. He shut his eyes. Oh God… he was an idiot. Now Holmes would never touch him… which was a good thing…? John couldn’t think with his professor breathing down his neck, literally.
John chuckled. "If that's what you want..." Again he tugged in Sherlock's cock, this time a bit faster. "Again? Or do you want me to suck you off again? I'm more prepared this time, I'll let you fuck my throat."
"Do you understand why I am punishing you?" Just as quiet. Just as hypnotic. Just as angry. "You may respond."
He nuzzled against my stiff cock with his nose, smiling. "What do you want?" he asked, mouthing gently at my shaft through my pants.
"Yes," he replied breathlessly. "I'll try. Just... enough of this." His hand fluttered, indicating to John and himself. "I just want... want..."
"This tea is awful. It's too sweet. You didn't level the sugar off when you added the two teaspoons, so I have about eleven grams of sugar in my tea instead of the regular eight. That's almost a forty percent increase in sugar." He slammed the offending cup onto the coffee table, stacked high with papers, slopping a bit down the side of the porcelain.
Hiro Hamada: ...okay, maybe you get that. But of course I did, that's, like, step number one. And I know what's wrong with it. This. *hold up my hand and it's glowing underneath the surface* I was trying to think of a way to avoid getting my stuff stolen again, considering the world almost ended last time that happened, so I built a chip that controls all my bots and put it in my hand. I just didn't consider the fact it would /hurt/. Therefore, over load.
Even as he climbed the stairs to 221B, John could hear the music. Well, it would have been more surprising if he hadn't heard it, actually, considering the volume of the music. The bass rumbled deep in his chest, like it had so often at concerts when he was in Uni.
This all took place in John's head over the course of about 1.38 seconds. There was no other option, unless relieving yourself in the sink was considered decent. John didn't consider it decent.
John stopped once he was all the way into Sherlock. He rotated his hips slowly, bringing a high keening noise out of Sherlock. "I nearly took you then and there at that counter, Sherlock. You're so fucking sexy when you squirm. God, you're tight," John growled.
Sherlock nearly fell off the bed in his eagerness to obey. In record time he had unbuttoned his shirt, yanked off his trousers and then his black pants.
Sherlock slowly stood, moaning at the sudden emptiness his body felt. He quickly  put on his trousers, shoved his pants in his coat pocket, and shrugged that on.
Taking John's stillness as a cue, Sherlock hesitantly thrust his hips up. He found little resistance, so he did it once more, harder this time.
Sherlock nodded, closing his eyes as John situated himself over the detective. "I'll go slowly. I know it hurts, I know."
After a few minutes, I finally opened my eyes, finding Sherlock still spread out, all traces of his sexual activity gone except for the cooling semen splattering his navel and down his bollocks. His eyes were serene and calculating. Finally: "No swelling in my prostate except that due to sexual arousal."
Hiro Hamada: I don't even know what I am. Fourteen. Don't like anybody really. And you wanna go there? I'll go there. When I was six I built a super computer out of steel wool, bubble gum, tooth paste and an iPhone charger.
A T-Rex Who Speaks Human: I have some ability to maintain fitness, by chasing and hunting the wildlife, but other than that, nothing else.
Sherlock Holmes: Then I will call you Mycroft. I assume you're large, powerful, but have not the abilities to maintain physical fitness. Am I correct?
Sherlock ran his long hands down John's back before reaching between them. His nimble fingers fumbled with John's fly before he finally got his trousers open.
teen!nerd!wearing lingerie underneath clothing!Castiel (Destiel, jock!Dean?) has left the conversation.
“How long?” John asked between gritting teeth. Now, along with the God-awful cramps, he had the intense feeling that he needed to use the loo.
John stumbled and fell onto a bed, and Sherlock bent over him, taking both his hands and pinning them with one of his high above his head. Sherlock smiled as he ground his pelvis against John’s, inciting a moan from the latter.
"It was for an experiment," Sherlock huffed, unzipping his trousers. My eyes darted down for a split second before I caught myself.
After several minutes of John just standing there, catching his breath, he finally came to his senses. He actually needed a wash and Sherlock was waiting for him with a cup of coffee.
He reached for the glass and took a large swig before taking the tablet, hoping it was strong and would kick in quickly.
John stood, grabbing Sherlock's hand and pressing his mouth tenderly to the detective's. It was a slow, passionate, almost shy kiss (considering it was one of Sherlock's first kisses, this was understandable.) John ran one hand slowly down Sherlock's back, letting it rest just above the curve of his buttocks. The other hand wrapped around his black curls, tugging ever so gently. Sherlock moaned, breaking away to gasp for air.
Once again, Sherlock straddled John. He nodded, closing his heavy-lidded eyes. Sherlock reached behind him and grasped John's cock, stroking it a few times reverently before slowly sitting, impaling himself with John's cock.
Finally, John stepped forward. He rolled up the sleeves of his jumper (God, that should not be so arousing) and stroked Sherlock's thigh with one gentle hand.
“This is mine,” Sherlock hissed, stepping forward even further and pushing his arousal into John’s thigh. “And mine alone. Do you understand?”
John’s mind froze when his phone buzzed. Oh shit. Oh shit. He was sure it was Professor Holmes, and oh God he wanted to shove a tube up his arse to clean out his colon and oh God he couldn’t do it. He’d have to move to a new university and probably a new city and get a new name and oh SHIT.
Sherlock's mouth was softer than it looked, John discovered. It was minty and tinged with the taste of John's salty cum and one hundred percent Sherlock.
From the corner of my eyes, I could see his fingers slowly kneading and rolling his bollocks, one then the other. They were heavy and hairless- shit, now I was looking, wasn't I?- and just the right size to fit in my mou-
Sherlock turned off the nozzle and crouched down next to John. “Shh. Shhh… it’s alright. You’re doing fantastic. You’re over halfway there, John! You’re doing so good. It’s almost over, I promise.”
"You're right, I don't need to," Sherlock agreed simply, teeth grazing the waistband to my red pants. "But I really, really want to."
By the time John had caught up to Sherlock, Lestrade was hanging up his phone and walking toward the two. John sniffed to hide a smile, fingering the small, fob-like remote in his coat pocket.
"Turn it off," Sherlock gasped as the door closed. His legs were shaking and his face was pink. "John, please."
Slowly, slowly, he pressed himself into Sherlock, exhaling only when he was completely sheathed. "You're so fucking tight. Jesus," he breathed. "Alright?"
John rushed to the kitchen to put away the groceries, hoping that Sherlock would not notice him until he was well away and under control.
Buzz. ‘By the way, don’t be frightened. Many people find enemas quite enjoyable. Arousing, even. -SH’
"What?" I replied too quickly, wincing. "Oh, the...? No, of course not..." My heart sunk. Of course he wouldn't be interested in kissing me on the lips; he had never shown any interest in anyone, and this was merely a joking kiss on the cheek between best mates when they were both slightly drunk.
Sherlock was wanking in the shower! Sherlock bloody Holmes, who found emotion so appalling and had never shown interest in anyone, was getting himself off.
"Are you sure you don't want to leave?" Sherlock finally asked once he had sprawled himself across his bed, legs obscenely spread. I swallowed. I was getting a feeling that Sherlock was not, in fact, going to hurt himself; rather, quite the opposite. Just the same- it would be best that I ensured- wasn't it?
John closed his eyes and rubbed his face, hard enough to make stars bloom behind his eyes when his knuckles came in contact with them. "Quit talking so much. It's exhausting to listen to. Can't you say anything like a regular person?"
"Yes," Sherlock replied, voice strained. Even without stimulus, his cock had not flagged or softened. From where he was laying, Sherlock could not see what the doctor was doing, but judging by the sound, he was searching for something small and relatively unused.
So, on Christmas Eve morning, I grabbed a step stool, a nail, and a bunch of mistletoe, and hung it over the door to the second floor of the flat. Pleased, I went back upstairs before Sherlock woke up, and continued my morning like normal.
Sherlock turned suddenly and grabbed the medical bag (it looked like an IV bag) and filled it nearly full with tap water, adding what looked like table salt in and shaking it. He hooked the sack up on the hook and connected the tube, allowing a bit of the solution to squirt out before closing the tap.
“I figured you would agree, so I filled out all the necessary papers to switch classes,” Professor Holmes explained, mouth twitching. “All you need to do is sign down here.” He indicated to a short line at the very bottom of the last page.
Sherlock opened the door and walked to the sink, washing his hands. "Did I hurt you? Are you angry?" Sherlock asked quietly.
It was off, of course- Sherlock was in the middle of a conversation with a witness and John was still a hundred metres away.
John marched into the nearest cafe and stood at the counter. Sherlock was close behind, and now that he was out of earshot his breathing was ragged and uneven.
“Turn over,” Sherlock ordered. John did so, feeling his fingers trail down his lower back and stop right…  there.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, popping open the top button to his trousers. "I'll say it again: I didn't calculate the effect coffee would have on the paracetamol."
Sherlock chuckled. “Yes, it will be. I can teach you things you never dreamed about, John. But that’s for another time.”
For several minutes the liquid gushed into John’s colon without complaint. But then, the cramps started. The worst cramps he had ever felt. It was like his abdomen was swelling and would burst at any moment.
John soaked this in. "...so this wasn't an attempt to get in my pants?" he finally asked, feigning offense.
John stared for a moment before moving both hands to Sherlock's face, bending down, and crashing his mouth to Sherlock's.
"Y-es!" Sherlock hissed, face contorting as the vibrations suddenly shook through him. "Danger's my middle name," he finished, voice husky.
Sherlock shifted his feet, chest heaving and eyes wide. He looked like a deer caught in headlights; an uncommon expression on the detective. "I shouldn't have said that. Never mind. I'm off to bed."
Sherlock nodded mutely, cheeks flushed and mouth open. John tossed the lubricant back into the nightstand and took the sound out with him, putting it in a pot of water and setting it on the stove to boil.
John moaned into Sherlock's cock, and felt several drops of precum slide down his throat. He moaned again, bobbing on Sherlock's cock rapidly.
My hips undulated as he took in my tip and sucked very, very, maddeningly gently. "I want to fuck your mouth, or your arse, or your cock, I want you to touch me, and don't stop until I cum, and then I'll get you off, if you want that I mean, and if not that's okay, but I really hope you do, because I want to taste you," and I was rambling, but Jesus Sherlock had asked for me to talk and if that was all it took for his clever lips to close around my cock I'd be damned if I would stop talking until I was limp.
“Please, John, call me Sherlock,” Holmes replied with a kind smile. “And if you want to have any kind of relations with me tonight, you’re having an enema.”
"Isn't that what you want?" Sherlock continued as if there hadn't been a pause where he had taken my whole length into his mouth.
Sherlock Holmes: Thank you, madam. I believe this tingly sensation in my extremities is the alcohol?
The last one was the hardest blow of them all, landing just at the root of his cock. Sherlock cried out, hips bucking into the mattress as a dribble of pre-cum leaked from his aching cock. He rut into the mattress, not caring that it was pathetic.
And then Sherlock's head tilted back up, a small, keening sound coming from his mouth before his eyes opened and locked with John's gaze immediately. He didn't seem surprised, or embarrassed, or indignant; rather, his tongue darted out and moistened those Cupid's bow lips, mouth opening slightly and the blush climbing higher up his face.
"Stop thinking," John mumbled, smirking up at the detective. His eyes were dark and bottomless and he could see why all the women fell for him, with his 'come fuck me' gaze and-
John blushed as he stood. Yes, he was very familiar with the position… usually he wasn’t on the receiving end, though. John stepped into the bathtub and got on his hands and knees, face burning with humiliation. Even so, his cock was already half-hard.
He took him deeper, relaxing his throat as he remembered. Slowly he took in his entire cock, breathing heavily through his nose so he wouldn't need to get a breath.
John unzipped his trousers and pulled out his half-erect cock, spitting into his hand and stroking it slowly. Just as he was getting to his full length, Sherlock walked in.
-and he cried out, high and keening, head thrashing as cum spurted out of his cock, trailing the sticky substance down his knuckles and shaft and down his perineum, and my hips were snapping into my fist, seeking friction- and I was getting closer-
"I've been ready for the past ten minutes," Sherlock huffed, squirming violently. "Just do that again."
A shaky "okay?" had barely fallen out of my mouth before his lips were sliding down my shaft and I was completely in his mouth again and his tongue swirled, swirled, and he sucked, and Jesus Christ he knew how to give head.
Sherlock's eyes were intense and he leaned forward. "I was in the privacy of our bathroom, taking a shower. I shouldn't need to keep myself in check when social rules dictate I be left alone anyway. But regardless, that's not what I meant."
There was some sort of snare drum or something involved, a deep, sensual rhythm. Not exactly a Sherlock-type song, John thought as he opened the door. There weren't enough violins.
Barista:*laughs* Well, that might work for maybe a few hours, but not as long as he hopes for romance.
But then, Sherlock held the microphone up to his mouth and began to sing. "You let me violate you, you let me desecrate you, you let me penetrate you, you let me complicate you-"
Sherlock turned the nozzle. “All gone, John. You did so, so well. I’m going to remove the tube, but don’t let any out. Clench your muscles if you need.” He crouched down next to John again, gently taking out the tip of the tube. John sighed as the pain dulled a bit, but it was back soon enough.
Far past the clarity of mind to argue, Sherlock did just as he was told, lifting his hips rapidly and reaching one hand down to hold John's head in place. Fuck, this felt good... Why hadn't he ever let anyone do this to him before?
His hand, which had been working quickly, slowed as he reached down with his other hand to his puckering hole, lifting his knees and planting his feet closer to his body. It was quite a nice view.
Sherlock's eyes flickered to mine, slightly glossy and impossibly blue and brilliant. "Perhaps. She's at her sister's house for the weekend, left this morning."
Quite a bit faster than before, John removed his finger to the very tip this time and quickly (relatively) thrust it back in.
"Are you telling me there's absolutely nothing dangerous in your entire bedroom?" I asked skeptically, already knowing the answer.
They both paused when the bathroom door squeaked open and someone walked across the floor to the urinals. Sherlock looked desperately at John, who nodded tersely.
I held my hand to my mouth and spit, far less gracelessly than Sherlock had done but no less effective, palming my aching cock and stroking firmly. Sherlock's eyes darted down as his mouth gaped slightly, his teeth biting down into his soft-looking lower lip. His finger slowly traced his hole, slowly dipping in the the first digit and then it was back out, circling again.
"What do you want me to do?" John asked, slightly embarrassed by the breathlessness of his own voice.
My mouth opened and closed several times as question after question rolled through my head. Finally, I decided to go with the safest one: "What?"
‘My address is 221B Baker Street, London. Please come, and dress comfortably. Arrive no later than 8:00. -SH’
It burned a little, felt foreign, but it was so intensely arousing Sherlock felt as if the smallest movement of the sound would tip him over the edge. John pushed it back in, just as slowly, until only about a millimeter remained.
"I'm going to finish the blog post. I know you are able to cum without being touched. Do this and you'll be wearing a chastity cage for a month. Do you understand?"
"Such a greedy little slut. Letting his Master fuck him in the loo while he wanks," John growled, suddenly snapping his hips and filling Sherlock.
This continued on for five or so minutes, until Sherlock started using his hips to get John deeper. John rested his other hand in the detective's thigh.
Sherlock stood on the coffee table, the papers all thrown aside hastily. He had moved the table so that it was against the wall, like a small stage.
John pressed his mouth desperately to Sherlock's, his hands curling around Sherlock's black hair as they both came down from their orgasms. He pulled up for air, gasping, and rested his forehead on Sherlock's.
John shifted the paper sack in his arms, about to shout for Sherlock to turn it down, when he finally looked up.
The detective could hear John moving about behind him, could hear the slither of ropes, and he had a good idea as to what the doctor was doing. He rolled his neck, steeling himself for a long afternoon.
Sherlock hummed in agreement as he rummaged through his drawer with his eyes closed, finally pulling out a white handkerchief. He wiped it across his face quickly before throwing it aside, turning onto his side towards John.
The drawer closed and John turned back around, holding a small plastic case and a bottle of lubricant. Sherlock's cock twitched as John came closer, opening the case and pulling out the small, ribbed metal rod. It was about as thick and long as a coffee stirrer straw.
John's eyes were dark and predatory. Sherlock's heart skipped a beat as John slowly sauntered to the detective, not breaking eye contact. He could feel the anger radiating from the older man, the heat from his gaze pooling directly in Sherlock's abdomen.
“Hold it all in,” Sherlock whispered as he inserted the small tube into John’s arsehole. It probably went in two or three inches. “This might feel a bit… odd. But please try to keep it all in.”
Sherlock sighed, sitting up and opening his blue grey eyes. "John, you're drunk. We can talk tomorrow when you're reasonable."
Their tongues brushed briefly before John pulled back, panting slightly. "I have to run this formula to Molly's. Continue when I get back?"
a troll: Well, I apologize for not being such a high class smarty pants as you are, but at least I'm not a discourteous fool who looks down at other people and cause them to question their own well being. But hey, that's totally fine.
Sherlock Holmes: Serious and quiet, interested in security and peaceful living. Extremely thorough, responsible, and dependable. Well-developed powers of concentration. Usually interested in supporting and promoting traditions and establishments. Well-organized and hard working, they work steadily towards identified goals. They can usually accomplish any task once they have set their mind to it.
"Don't pull something like this again, you twat," the doctor finally snarked, standing and walking out of the bedroom to fetch a wet flannel.
“Have you ever considered being a doctor?” Holmes smiled, blue-grey eyes lightening in amusement. As if he knew the internal conflict John was experiencing.
Holmes cocked his head. “Alright… John. Wait right here.” He walked back over to his desk (John relaxed a bit; he had been getting pretty close to him) and grabbed a small stack of papers and a pen.
Sherlock Holmes: I admit that during our brief conversation you've went up 100 I.Q. points. You've now in the positives.
"And what kind of bloke gets off on smacking bums?" John continued, pressing the front of his straining trousers against the back of Sherlock's thigh.
John smacked his bare arse again, extremely happy with the response. Thank God Sherlock had mentioned that he wanted this, or he never would have dared to touch Sherlock like this. "Do you want me to smack you again?" he purred.
His middle finger joined his first, wrist relaxing back to a normal position and moving frantically in and out of himself. From several feet away I could see lubricant streaming over the edge of his sphincter and down into the mattress and I longed for my mouth to be there instead of his hands; a revelation that made my eyes snap shut and sweat bead on my forehead. Okay, so I was officially admitting to myself that I had feelings for Sherlock, then.
They laid like that for several minutes, panting. Then, just as Sherlock's hands began lazily exploring John's lower back, the doctor broke the silence.
Sherlock stood and turned the nozzle again. The liquid continued to flow into him, although now each drop added to the pain until John was sure he couldn’t possibly hurt more, and was proven wrong the following instant.
Again, a sharp nod. Very, very slowly, John withdrew his finger until it was to the first digit and then slowly moved it back in. John could feel his cock straining angrily against his pants and desperately wanted to replace his finger with his cock but for Sherlock's sake he was taking it slow. Probably slower than necessary, but better safe than sorry.
Sherlock whimpered, tossing his head back and forth at the stimulus. "You. I want... your cock... please, no, too much," he gasped as John took him into his mouth.
Sherlock's smirk widened as he dramatically stepped off the table, leaning over John uncomfortably close as the brief music break concluded.
He hailed a cab and yanked the door open. "Take me to the bar down the block. Quickly." John grated out to the cabbie.
After standing there for a moment, John started, remembering the running shower, and stepping in. He let out an indecent moan as the almost unbearably hot water streamed down his chest.
Sherlock opened his mouth to reply but before he could get anything out, John wrapped his hand around Sherlock's cock and squeezed up. The detective groaned, head falling back.
John smiled, his cock twitching at Sherlock's arousal. Jesus, he needed to built up stamina if this was to be a thing. "I would. I'd pull down your trousers, lick that pretty bum of yours until you screamed, and then fuck you until you couldn't cum any more."
Sherlock looked at me, a boyish smile spreading across his lips. "Well, me and my mate snuck under the yellow tape to see the body. John's really into medical shit, but I'm just in it for the adrenaline."
John smiled, pulling back again. "And that was your second. I don't want to take it too fast with you. Besides, I already have enough to regret when I wake up."
He grabbed Sherlock's cock and began stroking it with quick, concise strokes. Every time he reached his head, he ran his thumb over the leaking slit. Sherlock whimpered, swiveling his hips.
Sherlock closed his eyes. "Of course I know that. It's just... Never mind. It's silly. I'll try to turn my brain to hibernate."
"Because I want to try it. With you. I want to see if I can cum just from you... stimulating my prostate," he finished, flushing.
John mouthed gently across Sherlock's neck, pausing to nip gently at his collarbone. "Let's go to your bedroom."
John sniffed and, bouncing on the balls of his feet, looked away. Yes, Sherlock was acting, but it was a rather good act, and John was notoriously jealous. He would have no qualms about dragging Sherlock into the nearest bathroom and fucking him senseless, but he thought it would be best to avoid that.
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: Yeah, I suppose not...Although he isn't anything like Magnussen. That's something.
John shook his head eagerly, reaching for the lube. "No I'm not. It's long and thick, but not too thick. I've seen blokes with twice your ego and half your size. Anyone would kill to fuck a cock like this."
Holmes smirked as John snatched his phone back, checking to make sure his professor hadn’t done anything to it. “Text me between 5:00 and 6:00. I’ll send you the address. Bring nothing other than your mobile.”
“I’ll be out,” he yelled, not sure if his dorm mate Mike was even here. Anyway, it wasn’t like he’d call Scotland Yard if John was gone for an hour or so. He opened and shut the door quietly, walking to the elevator and waiting for it to come.
John stood just outside the bathroom, arguing with himself. Yes, he did have to piss very badly, any yes, Sherlock had walked in on John in the shower before for more trivial things than bathroom emergencies. Plus, to be fair, Sherlock had been in there for nearly half an hour.
"Yeah." I was starting to feel rather uncomfortable standing here, unsure if Sherlock thought he was required to kiss me or not. "Look-"
The last words came out as a high-pitched keen as Sherlock flung his arm over his eyes, thrusting into his fist furiously.
Sherlock cried out, knees buckling under him. He fell to the hardwood floor, hands gripping the duvet in the valiant attempt not to touch his twitching prick.
"For God's sake, John, are you really going to stand here while I rub one out?" Sherlock sighed, running a hand through his black curls.
John closed his eyes, barely suppressing a moan. Jesus Christ, his baritone voice could call him to the depths of hell and he'd come marching. "I could handle that. However rough you get, I've had rougher. A bisexual man of my size in the military... you get the idea."
King Artoria Pendragon: Well I'm kind of alive. The story is a little different though. And by that I mean that King Arthur was actually a woman.
"Shit," he moaned, squeezing his eyes closed. If he looked now and saw John's mouth wrapped around his cock, he would cum on the spot, and how embarrassing would that be?
Sherlock Holmes: I prefer to detach my brain while engaging in sexual activities which leads to be being a bit... rough.
"I would very much like to test that. Sounds like a challenge to me." Sherlock smirked, leaning forward. "But not now. I believe you promised to penetr- all right, fuck me."
“Yes, sir?” John turned to his Forensics professor. John hadn’t ever really seen him up close; from the way he talked and acted, he would have assumed that Professor Holmes was in his forties. However, the man standing before him seemed hardly older than he was- 26, tops. He must’ve been some sort of prodigy to already have gotten a doctorate and secured such a stable job.
Sherlock Holmes: Common mistake. And I know the feeling of the world nearly ending... although I'm always the one who saves the day.
His professor was impeccably dressed, as always. He wore a black suit with a white dress shirt under, topped off by sleek black dress shoes. The only thing missing was a tie. Holmes perched casually on his desk, looking warily at John. He squirmed uncomfortably; it felt as though his professor was X-Raying him.
"Fuck, Sherlock, where did you learn that?" I finally panted after the stars had disappeared from my vision.
John stood suddenly, abandoning his untouched coffee and bending over Sherlock. Sherlock looked up from his chair, uneasy and aroused and unsure of what came next. John grabbed the front of Sherlock's white shirt and yanked up so Sherlock was standing, then pulled his face down. He roughly pressed his lips to Sherlock's, grinding his stiff crotch against the other man's. The detective gasped, giving John a chance to slip his tongue in and claim Sherlock's mouth.
Sherlock panted in John's ear as he writhed in the doctor's lap. "Fuck, John, I'm going to cum-" he gasped, voice deep and rumbly and sexy, and then he stilled, head falling against John's shoulder as his cock pulsed, wetting the front of his expensive trousers.
John's hand flew up and away from Sherlock's body, his cock left bobbing and twitching and dribbling onto his abdomen.
Which made sense, seeing as he had procured a microphone (a rather expensive looking one, John thought) and a large speaker.
John snorted, stumbling over to his chair and plopping down. "What about you? When you're reasonabon- reasonable? Because that's NEVER."
a troll: Wow congratulations to me. I sure feel like a winner today. Thanks to myself, that is, and not to you.
John cried out, hands flying to Sherlock's hair as he came. He could feel it oozing through the fabric of his pants and trousers, forming a small wet spot near the zipper.
"Quickly. Like a bandage," Sherlock grit out. John nodded, steeling himself before thrusting his fingers in. Sherlock cried out, hips arching as he squirmed away only slightly. "Shit, are you trying to kill me?"
Maybe it was the booze running through his system. Maybe it was the fact that he hadn't so much as held hands with anyone in over three weeks. Maybe it was because he was relieved that his feelings were actually reciprocated. Whatever the reason, John leaned forward and, without thinking, pressed his lips firmly to Sherlock's.
John let out a grunt and then a moan before he felt his cock pulse in his hand, hot cum dripping down his fingers as he found his release. "Fuck... yes," John groaned as he came down, the startling white behind his eyes fading back to normal.
John crawled onto the bed and over to Sherlock, easily popping the first three shirt buttons open with only one hand. Perhaps John was more versed in seducing men then he'd let on, seeing as the shirt buttons would be opposite for women and thus it would take more practice to open men's?
Sherlock's walk was almost undetectably off. His legs were several centimeters wider apart than usual, and his knees didn't bend quite as much.
John leaned forward, mouth twisted into a smirk. "You're not the only kinky one in the room, Mr. Holmes."
Sherlock opened his mouth to say something, but John beat him to it: "Stop thinking. For once, just feel and go with the flow. I promise, I won't hurt you."
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: Yes, still close. Though I don't like to rely too much on stereotypical things such as personality types.
For nearly a month I had been working up the nerve to do it. Already I had set up a tree in our living room and hung stockings on the fireplace, and I had been afraid that if I made a move too soon, Sherlock would get tired of it too quickly.
He heard Sherlock leave the room, but John didn’t dare move. Instead he stared at the wallpaper directly in front of him, trying to pull himself together. He had always been a bit… curious… but never in a million years did he think he’d actually do anything sexual with another man. Much less his professor, for God’s sake!
Sherlock didn't respond, instead mussing up his hair and flipping up his collar. Sitting in an ambulance with a blanket around her shoulders was a young woman, maybe 30. She seemed calm enough, considering.
Sherlock racked his sex-addled brain, trying to think. What on earth was he expecting? Oh- "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry," Sherlock gasped, clenching around John.
"I... um... I... woke you up with my violin at 3:00AM. Once." thwack. "And I- I- fuck, I complained about your tea once." THWACK.
John’s eyes snapped open immediately. His professor was staring intently at him, drinking in every detail like it was water to a dying man. John felt his face heat up, but he stared back at his professor.
Holmes jumped off his desk, dark brown curls bouncing slightly. He took a few steps toward John. “I wanted to talk to you about your future.”
Sherlock's head was spinning as he came down from his orgasm, trying hard to regain his breath and return the favor to John. He'd endure whatever pain it took to guarantee another blow job like that.
Sherlock Holmes: Ah! Now that's a name I recognize. Although I wasn't aware you were real... or still alive.
Sherlock Holmes: It's part of my job. I be a 'rude smartass' and the world continues to be idiotic and tasteless.
"Yes, pet. I need to prepare," John groaned. He squirted a generous amount of the lube into his hand and slowly stroked himself, making sure his entire shaft was coated with the clear jam-like stuff.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Don't play dumb, it doesn't suit you. You're already unintelligent enough as it is. I could see your erection from a mile away when I walked in the kitchen."
“I’m sorry, I know I di- what, what?” John stopped mid-sentence, realizing what his professor had just said. “Like, a DOCTOR doctor?”
John slammed his hips forward and Sherlock cried out into his mouth, eyes snapping open. John trailed his lips down the detective's neck, leaving hot, open-mouthed kisses there.
The bottle of lube opened with a snap and the cool gel dropped onto the head of the detective's cock. John rubbed it in, paying special attention to Sherlock's slit.
Sherlock stepped up to her, suddenly bubbling with nervous excitement. "So you saw what happened then?" he asked quietly, as if trying not to attract attention.
And then John had his fist wrapped around Sherlock's cock and he was pumping him, wrist twisting and tugging, and John's hand was dry but it felt so good, Sherlock didn't care, as long as John kept doing exactly what he was doing.
Was John gaping? He wasn't sure. Sherlock's eyes and words had taken ahold of him and were not letting go.
John's eyes opened and met Sherlock's. He nodded at the detective and spat in his hand as Sherlock rose and fell again.
John frowned slightly. Sherlock's voice was unsure and tinged with sadness. He'd have to ask later, because obviously Sherlock was unwilling to talk about it now.
John quickly retreated, nosing at the detective's cock instead. "Soon, love. I want this as much as you do, trust me." He ground his pained cock against Sherlock's calf to prove his point.
And then his mouth was gone, and he was pressing light kisses to my tip and my knees were weak. Jesus.
Herpes, AIDS, and STDs he quickly pushed away. John wouldn't... Of course not. He wouldn't be that careless.
His heart pounded in his chest. From embarrassment, of course, because becoming aroused at seeing his flatmate having a wank in his chair was completely inappropriate.
I hummed noncommittally, bouncing on the balls of my feet and looking to his poster of the Periodic Table of Elements.
Sherlock Holmes: Just- *hic*- a bit impaired. Do you need a good detective? I'm world famous, y'know.
Maddeningly slowly, John pressed the tip of his cock into Sherlock, stilling when he had gone in a few centimetres.
Holmes tilted his head, indicating that John was dismissed. Once assured that he hadn’t done any irreparable damage to his phone, John cast his now-former professor a glance. “Okay.”
"Jesus!" John mumbled, going pink himself and not-so-discreetly covering his manhood. "Yeah, I'll take a cup. Thanks."
The sound John's tongue made as it fucked Sherlock was obscene. His balls ached, so he reached down and rubbed at his poor cock, unable to wait any longer.
"So responsive," John smirked, situating himself so his mouth was right over the detective's cock. "You might be hoarse by the time we're through today."
'bloody fag should just get it in the arse and stop wanking on his keyboard, that's the only way something this bad could be written'
"So you wouldn't mind telling me what you saw, then? I'd really like it," Sherlock grinned at her, eyes slowly raking down her body.
He reached over to his nightstand and took out a small bottle of lube, squirting a generous amount onto his fingers.
