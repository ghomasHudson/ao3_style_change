"Yeah, I know that, but—" Sam keeps looking at Dean oddly, until Dean's ears go hot. "Man, shut up."
Sam's human, whatever Veritas might think, but only by the strictest scientific definition. He bleeds like a human, bruises like a human. Sam takes out Veritas first, but then Dean's on him with a swiftness John Winchester would have been proud of. Dean beats the thing calling itself his brother senseless, hauls the bloodied body back to his motel in the dead of night, and ties it to a chair. When he risks leaving it alone for a moment to wash his bloody knuckles off in the sink, he sees the shape of his battered hands and realizes the change already happened. He hadn't been paying attention. He washes down with a washcloth and changes his clothes. He sits. He waits. Eventually, he calls Cas.
We're trying NOT to get anyone else killed this year Dean.
Alone time isn't something Dean's been able to enjoy very often. He's had his nights on his own, sure, and he had that stretch of months without Sam and without Dad that he really doesn't like thinking about, but this feels different. He knows Sam's safe, cause he's right down the hall, but they're not in such tight quarters that they're basically on top of each other. Privacy is right there for them, both of them, whenever they want it. And yeah, okay, not to put too fine a point on it, but holy shit, Dean can have a whole drawer just for porno mags if he wants. He can jerk off in the comfort of his own bed, and he can do it whenever the urge strikes him rather than defaulting to a fully-silent speed-run in the shower before he uses up all the hot water and Sam bitches at him about it. He can take his time with it. That's good, because he's not getting any from anyone else anymore, and he's certainly got a more active imagination than ever, which is a gift and a curse.
"Mechanics. Funny. 'Cause pipes?"
"You think you're the one who's broken," Dean says. "That's what you said before. You think you're 'defective.'"
isn't happy? They don't usually mess with this kind of magic, and Dean's seen the hundreds of ways spells can go wrong. It itches under his skin. He wants Cas to do what's right for him, but he and Cas aren't always so great at knowing what's right for them, are they?
"It's all right, dear. Let them come back."
"Rowena kinda had a point, though."
to do any of that stuff if you don't want to." Dean scrubs his hand back through his hair. "I guess Jimmy Novak was a missionary kind of guy."
Dean ties off the braid, then gives it a gentle tug. "All right, you can turn around now."
more views when I posted real spells."
. It's good for you, right? Don't—don't stop."
—Cas is talking about. All the pleasant feelings he's been riding along with since that morning fade away as the memory settles heavily in his gut.
"Dean?" Dean looks up from his phone, then shoves it back in his pocket, cheeks hot.
"If I only liked stuff with a lot of women in it, I wouldn't have much left to get into," Charlie says, switching the disc over to
Check out sleeping beauty
Detour in SD gotta deal with something. Also Cas always fucks off I told you that's just what he does don't waste your time
"Benny?" Sam blinks once, twice. Something in his face changes again, and Dean shuts his eyes against it. "Benny. Oh my god, Dean…"
But the guys just move on, heading into the hotel lobby. In the quiet, Dean looks back at Castiel, and it hits him. They don't know who Cas is. They can't see anything but what their eyes tell them. As far as the men who just walked by know, Castiel is a woman, and Dean's a man.
"Yeah."
"Thanks, Alfred," Dean says, rolling his eyes and biting back a smile.
"You've got five minutes to explain yourself, Rowena," Dean says. He clicks the gun's safety off as punctuation.
'Silly' is maybe not the word Dean would use. He has to shut his eyes, feeling them prickle, his eyelashes wet and sticking. Fuck. What the fuck.
"No, I'm not," Sam lies again.
That sobers Castiel's demeanor a little. "Is he all right?"
Sounds fun! ^_^
"Been talking about going over to DJ's next, you wanna come, or…?"
"The point of free will is that you get to pick, buddy," Dean says. "If you haven't met an angel you wanna, you know, get with, you could try hanging out on Earth a little more. Meet some humans. You know, besides me and Sam and Bobby."
Sam gave him a hell of a speech after that first trial. Dean's been thinking about it a lot.
There's still a disconnect. He knows how to get someone else off, he's done that plenty of times. But the angle's all different here, and his dick knows what it likes, but the same approach doesn't really work in this context. It's already better now that's he's warmed up and he's got a little slick going, but he's got no idea how to turn that into something with purpose. He's been told he's pretty good with his mouth, but he can't exactly bend himself in half and eat himself out.
"I'm a very lucky man," Dean says.
Dean remembers being a desperate kid, thinking for the first time,
"There a hunt?" Sam closes his laptop. He perks up (as much as Sam ever does nowadays) at the prospect of getting out of this dingy room reading about how to summon Dean's dick back from the ether or whatever.
there, and another before that, and another, and another. Too many to count.
Groceries are usually Dean's job. Not exclusively, but that just usually seems to end up being Dean's chore when they're back at home base, same as he's usually the one driving, nine times out of ten. But Sam's still giving him that funny look that tells Dean what's really going on. Dean doesn't think of himself as being especially smart, but he was raised by John Winchester, and he remembers what it was like to try to manage his drinking without letting him realize he was being managed.
Dean's cheeks fold into a smile. "Take the coat off, for one. You don't wanna look like a flasher."
life."
"He's just acting like me."
, if I hadn't..."
"I didn't hear you coming up with anything better," Dean says. He tosses Castiel the only prop she'll need, a fake wedding band that she holds up to the light curiously. "It goes on this one," Dean says, and points to the ring on his own hand.
The child's face transforms into a perfect picture of shock. Dean catches the young mom's eye, smiling apologetically.
"Yeah, thanks, Charlie," Sam coughs. "Right now, we just have to focus on trying to find Kevin and getting the third trial done."
Jack chews on his lip. Dean wonders where he picked that tic up from.
Sorry give me a minute Sam's here
Dean's head drops between his knees, his hands grasping the back of his neck. His ears are buzzing. "Great. Awesome. I'm just gonna go fuckin'. Jump into a lake or something, then."
"Here," Dean says, not intending to sound as hopeful as he does. But Cas just smiles at him, with absolute certainty.
And if a few pairs of panties end up stuffed in his pockets too, well, who's gonna know?
Dean huffs, ducking his head. "Uh, yeah, dude. You got stacked at some point, I'm not really sure when." He palms Cas's side next, spanning over the stretch of skin where he's inked. "Never got a good look at this, either."
In the meantime, Dean and Sam pick up another hunting job, something that seems likely to be a vampire on the move heading up towards Montana. Sam and Cas put up a united front to convince Dean it's okay to leave, that Cas has things well in hand back at the bunker. Dean still asks Sam to text them while he's busy driving, just to make sure nobody blew the place up or accidentally opened any more portals to other universes, and he calls Cas as soon as they check into their room that night.
thing, and Sam just says that he froze, that he's been in shock, that Dean's his
"Well, uh. Good for him," Dean says. His voice sounds high and distant to his own ears. "Uh, Bobby, I gotta go."
Thank you so so so so much to everyone who's read and commented, I can't tell you how much it's meant to me that people received the story well. I hope you'll enjoy the conclusion too. Extra effusive thanks to Riss, for being my second set of eyes and cheering me on as I wrote, and to Z, for making my entire life with incredible works of art inspired by the fic. I'm still just amazed at how lucky I am!!!
But he also remembers nightly prayers, and searching desperately through a hundred bloody fights just to find a man who didn't want to be found. Castiel can always find him, but when Cas wants to disappear, what has Dean ever been able to do about it?
close to getting something half a good as his mom used to make. He's just gotta keep trying.
"If you're that worried about them, why don't you talk to Cas yourself? Or hell, if you're still intent on being a middle-schooler about it, just send Claire a message.
He's thought about this before. He can admit that to himself, here in the moment. He's wondered what it might be like to kiss Cas, to be kissed by Cas. Fleeting thoughts of clueless fumbling from a being who had next to no experience, or later, thoughts of a bloodied mouth meeting his, tasting copper and then healing it all with a touch. None of that compares to the reality of Castiel crowding against him like any space between them is too much, opening up for him so eagerly. A leg slots between his, and, helplessly, Dean grinds against it. Sparks of pleasure burst through him, up his spine, until he's dizzy with it.
"I heard your prayers," Castiel said. "Every day. It was very distracting."
"How's this," Thien says, and shifts Dean over to his side, straddling one of his legs and holding the other against his chest. It's a hard angle, but Dean's facing Cas now, fully on display.
The principal's eyes grow a little rounder as well. "Really!"
He's afraid to ask what the price of this might be.
"Yeah, they didn't even get to the best part, where your dashing, supergenius hacker friend is introduced."
"He took off a couple days ago. He didn't tell you?" Sam frowns, pulling his phone out of his pocket, scrolling through. "He texted this morning. Didn't really explain what he was doing, but you know how Cas can be."
, Dean, I don't know where to start. I just want you." Cas kisses him again, like he's starving for it. This is an aspect of Cas's personality he maybe should have had an inkling of, but it's making his head swim anyway, just with the headiness of being wanted so boundlessly. "Show me what you like. I want to know what you like."
"I can do it better than that," Jack says, frowning at the pencil. "I just have to focus." The pencil slices through the air, zipping straight up to smash into the ceiling. Wood chips litter the table, scattered across the tops of Jack and Rowena's heads. Rowena shakes out her chin-length curls with a grimace. Jack's eyes are round and alarmed. "I'm sorry…"
"Well hey, I guess that's something," Dean says, folding his clothes and packing them away on top of the contraband. "Since it's calmed down a little, maybe that's a good excuse for you to grab some shore leave while you can. I was on my way over to Sioux Falls, but I could put it off for a couple hours, catch a movie, if you wanna tag along." Dean has no idea what's showing right now except for the usual October spookfests, and he's not in the mood, but sometimes those are good for a laugh. "We'll get some popcorn and some Sno-Caps. All work and no play makes Cas," Dean says, turning around to a suddenly empty room. "...fuck off."
Frustrated, he rolls over onto his stomach, and oh, that's kinda fun. The sheets are a little bit scratchy against his tits, but in a good way, and somehow from this angle he figures out he can get a couple fingers inside himself while the other hand focuses on his clit. He can't find anything he might consider a "g-spot," but he likes how it feels to have something inside him. He's not gonna go out and buy a dildo about it or anything, but he's starting to get the appeal. He starts trying to move his hips to meet his fingers halfway, fending off the cramp he can feel building, then shifts again until he's full on face-down ass-up, his cheek crushed against the mattress, hips rocking in the air. He can only imagine what he'd look like to someone else.
His heart hasn't stopped pounding since he woke up. He doesn't know how to stop it. Coffee certainly won't help, but he can't think of what else to do to bring himself back to reality, so he starts a pot, pacing in the kitchen while the little machine gurgles and spits.
"Slow down a sec," she says. "He did
Calling the spell Haleigh showed them a blessing wouldn't be totally inaccurate, if you happened to be the target. In truth, it was an energy transfer spell. On a small scale, it wouldn't necessarily hurt its caster— much. It had taken some coaxing to get Haleigh to admit that the spell only called for a
The carnie shakes his head, but he cuts the enormous stuffed shark down and hands it over without another word. Cas, victorious, turns to Dean with his arms full.
"No, you absolutely don't," she says sweetly, and flips open the menu on her side table.
, but he'd thought that was just his personal kind of brain damage. And okay, maybe he'd tried dressing like the women he was attracted to, when he was trying to be a woman, but that was just because he didn't really have any other guidelines for how to do it. Right?
"You look healthy."
"Who's laughing?" Dean says, though he is laughing a little bit. "It's not the kind with tentacles, is it?"
"Did I win?" Cas sets the remaining two baseballs down on the counter. Cas has been looked at before in much the way the carnie is looking at him now. Like the time a volunteer at the shelter handed him a banana and, eager with hunger, he bit into it. He hadn't realized one was meant to peel it open first.
"I really want to kiss you. Can I?"
"You think you're real fuckin' funny, huh?" Dean says, cheeks burning.
Except the vamps aren't biting. He sips his little cocktail and scans the crowd for an hour, but there's something about him that makes him invisible. Mostly he's just surprised by how… liberated the clientele seems to be, for a place tucked away in Nowheresville, Indiana. He spotted a couple of guys getting handsy with each other and nobody even batted an eye, 'cept maybe him.
"I thought he was a monster. But now I think…" His throat closes around it again. He struggles against the ties on his wrists, and to keep from talking.
"How long does this take? Are we just gonna be staring at Cas's ass for an hour?"
"You're really not clearing up my assumption that you're the Slayer," Charlie says. She reaches across to take his hand and gives it a squeeze. She waits until he squeezes back to release him. "And it was
"Jack," Dean sputters, "man, you gotta stop telling people— We're
When Dean wakes up, the first thing he thinks is:
"Looks good, Cas," he says. "Suits you."
"It wasn't really a choice," Cas says. Dean tries to keep his eyes on the road, but he can hear the frown in her voice.
Sam visibly relaxes, then makes a disgusted face. "Really Dean? Spray cheese?"
"Something you need?"
I'm trying to figure out how to reset the alarm.
"You tryin' to get us kicked out?" Dean asks, but he's smiling wide, his eyes creasing handsomely at the corners. He pats the oversized toy on the head, then chucks Cas on the shoulder. "That was fucking awesome. Did you see that dude's face?"
"Cas, is that really you?" Dean feels like his heartbeat is roaring in his ears. He can hardly focus on anything else but trying to find the evidence that it's really his friend in this unfamiliar body. Sam looks at him like he's nuts, and maybe he is, but he can't explain why he knows what he knows. The woman nods wordlessly, as though she can't explain it herself.
"You can't afford that kind of distraction."
"Like
He swipes his hand back through his hair. His mouth still tastes like whiskey.
"Don't be like that," Dean says.
, right?"
"Got it," Dean says. When he looks back at her, she's fiddling with the throw on the couch, eyes downcast.
"I did. I messed up. I'm sorry, I didn't—"
Cas thinks he's enjoying the county fair even more than Dean said he would.
"Castiel said he wasn't sure how long he'd be gone. So, until he comes back, I need to find something I can do to help. I'm still not very good at… at making my powers do what I want them to. But I've learned it's actually… nice. To feel useful."
"Go on," she says, eyes crinkling at the corners. "Ask me."
"Perfect," says Rowena. "That's much better. And you'll remember this next time I need a little help with my Enochian, yes?"
. He can't help but look over at Cas, who's still standing right where Dean left him. He can only look for a moment, because if he looks any longer he'll have a fucking meltdown. He's gone so deep into the well of shame, he's so submerged in it, that it almost has no power over him anymore. Like he opened his mouth, expecting to drown, and found he could breathe anyway.
Dean thinks.
"Right. I think I get it now," Mina says kindly. She squeezes Dean's arm, then releases him. "Can I get you anything? Water? I've got, um, Diet Coke…"
When he goes back to Mina's room, she's in an oversized t-shirt sitting on the edge of the bed. Dean kisses her again, one for the road, and asks her for a pen and paper. He jots down Bobby's number, writes down "Dean," hesitating a moment before he adds "Singer."
"I… yes."
The article helpfully provides shaky video, captured by a student's cell phone, of a bush in front of the school engulfed in flame. Children in uniform crowd around, some shouting in alarm, and there's a collective gasp when the fire is extinguished completely just as suddenly as it reportedly started, seemingly without any intervention.
"And the other guys, that didn't count because I wasn't a guy when that happened, so it's not like—it was different, that was a whole different thing," he says, words tumbling out of him before he can think to stop himself. He doesn't realize what he's said until he catches Charlie puzzling at him.
Dean's face falls, anger bubbling up in his chest. Cas sounds so matter-of-fact about it, and Dean can't believe how fucked up this whole universe and everyone in charge of running it is.
"Come on, man," he hears Sam say behind him, without much feeling behind it.
Big thanks forever to
"Sam, I'm serious, shut up. Stop talking." The smell of the coffee makes his stomach turn, and he bats the mug aside, letting it slide towards the other end of the table. Sam, to his credit, shuts up, setting his mug in front of him and holding it in two broad, white-knuckled hands. Dean massages his temples. All the heat of his anger has leeched from him, leaving cold dread in its wake. His toes are cold, and he curls them up under his feet, staring sightlessly at the scuff marks in the wood of the tabletop.
All of it together almost makes it feel worth the cost. He can't really wrap his head about any of it, Grandpa Henry, and Dad, and the Men of Letters. Abaddon. Dean copes by throwing himself bodily into putting his stamp on the bunker.
He steps outside the motel room to grab the remainders of that fifth out of the glove box, just something to take the edge off, but he's surprised to find Cas is already out there, sitting in the backseat like she's waiting to be driven somewhere. Dean plays along, gets behind the wheel and adjusts the mirror a touch.
"I don't give a shit Lee's a hunter. If I catch you after sneaking around in some shithole with him again, I'll black his eye. You come home by midnight. You stay home. That's part of the job."
"Yeah, no problem." Dean breathes deeply, stroking Castiel's back while he adjusts. Then Cas is moving again, rolling his hips forward, and Dean follows his lead.
"I dunno, just thought about it for the first time in a while. Wasn't sure if you remembered him too. You were pretty young."
When Dean returns, it's with a hairbrush in one hand and a hair tie around his wrist. Sam does look up at that, his little brother senses tuning him in to the crime that has been committed.
Sam signs to Jack, mouthing the word "jealous" with his back turned to Rowena. Jack gives him a goofy smile.
"Metatron," Castiel says, and the name comes out like a curse, "placed the knowledge of this series of films in my head, but I've never actually
"Don't. Don't be stupid, Charlie."
. "What'd you do during your sleepover? Braid each others hair, talk about boys?"
for her beta-ing assistance.
"Broadly speaking, I was never 'a guy'," Castiel says, finally turning away from Jack, who takes in the conversation with all the placid attentiveness of a mathlete in Calculus. That answer rubs Dean the wrong way for a reason he can't really pin down, making him bristle.
He kisses back more out of muscle memory than anything, gripping her hips for lack of anywhere less awkward to put his hands. It's not that kissing a woman is any kind of hardship. More than he had no idea this was where the night was going, and he's wondering how he could have missed a signal that big when he's usually the expert on picking them up. He hadn't gotten a single hint that Mina was a lesbian, is the main thing, but apparently that doesn't mean shit. What are the ethics here? Is it wrong for Dean to let her keep kissing him? It's hard to think straight with a lapful of cute girl shoving her tongue in his mouth. He jolts when she slides her hand under the hem of his shirt and brushes his stomach.
Her eyes flick to Sam's. Aside from that, she doesn't react. Dean holds position, his fingers twitching. Before either of them can move, another voice comes from the back room, thin and lilting.
Sam had watched him. He'd watched Dean get jumped by those vamps, and he'd let it happen. Dean might have been losing his shit, but he knows what he saw. He can't even look Sam in the eye right now. It's a goddamn miracle that Samuel had come, and that he knew a cure for vampirism. Too good to be true, he'd think, if it seemed like Sam gave one single solitary shit that he'd come inches away from something worse than death.
"Yeah, I just woke up the next day ready for Lilith Fair."
," Bobby said, equally horrified. "But you are gonna be stuck like that for a month. Once the moon cycles through back to where it was when she zapped you, you should just go back to normal."
"A witch hit me with a curse, I'm stuck like this for a couple weeks, yadda yadda yadda, it's no big deal, really." He tosses his hands up. "There you go. So you don't need to go bustin' down any doors lookin' for—I mean, I can prove it, just take me back to my car, I've got, you know, all my stuff's in the trunk. I'm headin' back to Bobby's soon. And if we could just… never, ever mention this to him, or anyone else, that would be—that'd be fuckin' fantastic, yeah?"
He slides to the side to escape the closeness of their bodies. He doesn't look back.
"Right," Sam says, relenting. "You're right, of course."
He rents a motel room outside of Sioux Falls and spends the next two hours painstakingly (and sometimes bloodily) shaving his legs. When he's done, he feels like a plucked chicken, smooth and alien, and it's weird how much just that changes the way he moves, the way he walks. He lines his eyes next, and breaks out the things he hadn't messed with too much before, the mascara, the eyeshadow. He's shaky and unpracticed, but he does his best. The addition of the lipstick feels like sealing it with a kiss.
"I guess not."
Cas sits robotically in the chair by the little square table. The light filtering in from the parking lot strikes him more clearly there. He just looks lost, and oddly small. A thunderstorm shoved into a shoebox. Dean rolls out of bed. He's just in boxer shorts and a t-shirt, but the darkness conceals him comfortably. He's in no hurry to flip the light on, and he knows Cas isn't the sort to care about that kind of thing. It's not like he needs it to get around.
He ends up in the kitchen, and he's about to go into the cabinet when he remembers that if Sam catches him drinking alone at— what time is it— one in the afternoon, he might actually try to stage an intervention rather than just giving him worried looks every so often and leaving the keys to the Impala in hard-to-find places "accidentally," like there aren't any other cars Dean could take instead. So, okay. Trash that instinct. What else is there to drink. He opens the fridge. There is milk, there is almond milk, which Dean doesn't think should legally be allowed to be called milk and he's sure the cattle farmers of the good state of Kansas would agree with him, and there is seltzer.
No messages.
new, but he doesn't know how virginity translates. Fucking magic. He sinks in further. There's no "barrier" or anything like that. Again, it doesn't really feel good so much as weird, though he's amazed by how hot he is inside. Something inside him clenches, and he feels the walls tighten around his finger. Jesus, that's weird.
"Yeah, I get it, man." Sam finishes his dinner, picking at the last little bits of diced tomato in front of him distantly.
"Are you pissed at me?"
"Nothing," Dean says too fast. "Coffee. Sorry, wasn't tryna be loud."
like real life," she says. Dean snorts.
"Trouble for
Cas looks at the bottle in his hand like it's a puzzle. "You know I can't really taste it."
, but I've never prepared chicken thighs, I should have known I would just… mess it up."
Jesus.
"Oh?" Cas shivers faintly against Dean's chest while Dean's fingers slide into him, teasing around his entrance.
"Just gettin' some air," Dean says, and slides to the side a little bit to allow Cas room. She hesitates a moment before joining him, her shoulder nearly touching his where she leans against the side door. She looks up at the sky, faded blue where it meets the horizon. There's too much light pollution out here. Dean wonders if angels can see the stars even when it's light out, or if they just see the same barely-there pinpricks humans do. "Want some?"
"Not really. A lot of articles about 'tweets'."
"Um. Thank you?"
"No!" Dean lurches back, just as surprised at himself as Cas looks. He just put so much
Jody pulls her squad car into a space, just down the way from where the Impala is still parked. The engine idles. She studies her hands on the wheels. Dean can feel that she's not finished with him yet, so he stays where he is, knuckles clenched tight in his jacket.
Jack's head peeks at him from between his knees, his hair sticking straight down from his head. "We're experiencing one-ness with our bodies!"
Gwen snorts. "He woulda fit right in. You'd never know from how Samuel talks about the guy."
Your so fucking annoying
Cas tugs the pins from her hair, which tumbles down—her hair does things like
"What happened is I pussied out."
"C'mon. Stay."
He frowns. Rowena's eyebrows lift, her eyes dancing with silent laughter. Dean offers his hand.
What she's actually done is taken a normal pair of scissors and taken them to Castiel's head like it's a topiary. She has Cas sitting on the edge of the bathtub, a towel wrapped around her shoulders and her coat and blazer draped over a towel rack, and there are clippings of dark hair littered all around her. Rowena frowns at Castiel like she's a particularly vexing passage in a book whose language Rowena cannot read.
"No, it's— you know what, never mind, I've embarrassed myself enough in front of you. I already cried in a public bathroom today, you're not gonna catch me telling you, '
"De-aging spell…?" He asks after a minute, squinting at Dean's babyface. Dean laughs, just this side of hysterical.
He sits in the garage, listening to the dead air settle, for a while. Then he heaves himself up, groaning at the way his knees don't cooperate quite like they used to anymore, and goes to shower, to wash the grime from under his nails and shave.
He can't seem to bring himself to tell her all of it. The vague outlines, the sketch of it—that he'd had to kill him himself, that he'd smiled at Dean and held him, like it was a kindness, that he'd stayed behind to save Sam's life and Bobby's soul—these things he can force himself to tell her.
Got a hold of Sam and he told me you're alive, so that's good, you asshole.
Sam and Eileen plan to keep pressing on through the night, hopefully to arrive back home before dawn. Eileen downs another cup of coffee before they pay the bill and head out. But Dean, usually content to push a few extra hours into the early morning if it means making it back to the bunker, insists that it'd be better for them to spend the night at a motel. Cas doesn't fight him on it, though it's unlike him. Dean hugs Eileen, pats Sam on the back, and lets them drive off in Eileen's Plymouth with his hands in his pockets.
"Hardly unlimited," Cas says gravely, and Dean just laughs and dips in to kiss the frown from his lips.
So Dean tells him what happened.
Dean frowns, lost in the unspoken half of her sentence.
"Cohabitation."
Cas shimmies out of the bra as Dean tugs it off over his head. Castiel's breasts are small and triangular, and Dean palms one, lowering his head to the other to suck it into his mouth. Castiel doesn't react dramatically, but when his nipple slides out of Dean's mouth and hardens in the air, he shivers, his grip tightening in Dean's hair. His expression, when Dean chances a look up, is dazed, looking down flushed and heavy-lidded at Dean, his mouth hanging open. Dean grins, thrilled to be the focus of such attention. He spends as much time as he's craving mouthing eagerly at Castiel's tits, since he hasn't sensed any objections. He rolls a nipple between his teeth, feeling the heat where Cas is straddling Dean, and Cas just says his name again like it's the highest praise he can think of.
They sit in companionable silence for a while, watching the sky grow darker and listening to cars pass by on the highway. Dean steals a glance, looking at the dark hair that spreads out over her shoulders.
"Uh-huh. And whose fault is that?" Charlie looks amused as he tries to fold his legs into the passenger side.
He okay?
Cas's hand stills, then vanishes, which is a relief and a disappointment in equal parts.
He wears the bra out of the fitting room, replacing all the other ones on the rack. It's not his first time shoplifting clothes—Sam went through the growth spurt from hell, rendering Dean's hand-me-downs useless, so he's old hat at layering shirts on underneath his dad's bulky jacket and walking out with no one the wiser—and that's gonna be his saving grace today, because holy shit, bras are
Castiel seems just as set on avoiding him as he is on avoiding her, which works out, even though it also leaves him feeling like shit scraped off a boot. He eats breakfast with Jack and Sam, and Rowena glides in at noon every day acting like she ought to be waited on hand and foot while Sam makes a faint attempt at acting like he's not going to do exactly that, and he hardly catches a glimpse of Cas through it all, unless Dean happens to pass through while she's spending time with Jack. She's kept her hair in its braid, and his fingers itch at his sides when he sees it.
"That's all right. Not too far, now."
"Um… like… five hundred thousand…"
"Really. Come on, Dean, you know me. I'm just teasing you. If it's important, I'll leave it alone."
. But no, I'm—I'm beat, man. Go have fun or whatever, I'll catch you in the morning."
"Are you hearing me right now?"
Cas cranes his head back to look at him, his eyes hazy with pleasure, with parted lips that Dean can't help but kiss.
Kevin's alive
He could still be grateful, if he really tried. John was just a man from a different era trying to make sure his son didn't attract the wrong kind of attention. He was protecting Dean. He was doing his best. And so what if his best isn't what you'd expect of a father nowadays? Maybe if he'd been allowed to live, he could've become that kind of father. He never got the chance.
"You can borrow something for now, if you want. I don't… I never really got how clothes worked for you guys."
He thinks,
"Maybe this time we can get you an actual wardrobe," Dean says, trying not to think about the way his shirt's gonna be stretched out the next time Dean wears it. "Something besides your, y'know, uniform."
Dean's chest aches. Next to him, Cas sucks in a sharp breath and goes to Jack, taking his face in his hands before pulling him into a tight hug. Dean watches them a moment, suffocated, before he breathes in deep, coming up behind them, afraid to break the moment, but needing Cas to know what he means. When Cas pulls away from Jack, he looks up at Dean with wet, hopeful eyes. Dean nods. It doesn't feel like enough, but Cas smiles like Dean's given him a gift anyway. Then Sam's there too, a brief hand on the back of Dean and Castiel's necks.
Cas, for his part, is sitting up, one hand on Dean's collarbone, the other slung across the headboard. The hand on Dean's chest tickles a bit, sending tingles of a different sort across Dean's skin.
Yeah all good
Cas flinches.
"No, it's not," Veritas says, agog. "How are you doing that? That's not possible. You're lying to me!"
"Your dads?"
Dean shouts as they disappear from view.
"Okay."
Dude these comics you sent me are weird
Castiel's head tucks up against Dean's neck easily, and it doesn't even jostle her hat, which seems to be pinned to her hair. Dean's a little bit startled to find she's taller than he's used to— almost as tall as Dean is. Taller, with the hat. Her arms close around his back, just as stiff and awkward as Cas ever was, though he's— she's—Dean's got a headache—Castiel has gotten better at them, the longer he's spent occupying a physical form. Cas hugs like he's still not sure he's allowed to, most of the time. But now, Dean hears a little sigh, feels the puff of warm breath against his shoulder, and the body in his arms relaxes an inch, and it feels good. So damn good. He breaks it off before he makes it weird. Or weirder. Sam trusts Dean enough to follow his lead, or maybe he just loves group hugs too much to pass one up, though he still looks bewildered.
"I don't know that it'll ever be truly over, Dean," Cas says. "Not for me."
Dean scrubs a hand over his face, stubble prickling at his palm. "Yeah, all right."
"I think I saw a movie that started that way once," Dean says, quiet and half-hidden by the slice folded in his hand. He grunts when Sam's boot collides with his shin under the table, but next to him, Cas is smiling.
"We're supposed to burn 'em, I know, but I—I couldn't—Because what if he finds his way back outta Purgatory again, you know? What if he—"
"Lucifer is gone," Sam says, bent to one knee. Dean hates the way Sam sounds as he says it, like he's a child again, in need of protection that Dean isn't big enough or strong enough to give him. The very thought of Lucifer reverts Sam to a smaller version of himself, and he doesn't even have to be in the same room to do it. He doesn't even have to be on the same damn plane of existence. "He's trapped. He can't get to you here."
Rowena sighs. "I suppose. I imagine it'll end up rather butch, but perhaps you'd prefer that," she says to Cas, who shrugs.
"You've got the same paperbacks Bobby did," Dean says, eyes lingering on the careworn copy of
"Afternoon," she says.
"I understand the mechanics, yes," Cas says. Dean snorts.
"Anyone ever done this to you before?" Dean asks quietly. His tongue darts out, lapping at Cas's entrance just enough to tease, to get him wet, but not enough to really get him anywhere.
Dean wants to reach out, to touch her elbow, to make her look up at him. He doesn't dare. "Hadn't what?"
Yea nazis long story. I'll call in a min gonna do a grocery run
Yea we're here
. All he really needs is the one, he figures. If he saves his cash for the pants he's gonna need, and maybe a better fitting pair of shoes, he can probably sneak off with a few shirts without any of the clerks catching on.
"Angel Face, you've always been my favorite," she says, flinging off the towel, which collides with Sam's chin.
Benny winces at the first cut, his throat working. By the time Dean gets to the third, he's screaming. As long as Dean's been doing this, it starts to fade out into just so much background noise. Anyway, the screams are nothing compared to the sound the sound the saw makes when it hits bone, or the crack of the ribs.
"What?" Sam looks closer, his brow furrowing. "Uh—"
"You— you can't put out a grease fire with water," Sam says behind him, and the back of Dean's neck burns. He disentangles himself from Cas, leaving his sodden jacket draped over his shoulders. He glances at the stovetop, where something unrecognizable and charred is gumming up his good sauté pan.
"Listen to me, Cas. I'm in this, no matter what you look like. I want you either way. And I want you to do what you wanna do, not… whatever you think is gonna be
"Is she even doing it on purpose?"
As the sweat cools, so does the shamelessness of his little fantasy, and the un-horny kind of embarrassment takes over. Jesus Christ, did he really think all that shit up? Just putting himself in the starring role of every nasty video he's ever jerked off to? What the fuck is wrong with him? He's gotta call Bobby. He's gotta get out of this body,
"Yeah, pretty much," Dean says. "Sam, he really didn't trust Benny. Some bad shit went down, some people ended up dead.
Call me when you get this.
Dean swallows a surge of panic. "Oh, uh— I, maybe it's better if you do it."
, it's—" This is almost worse, being looked at by Sam with the same drippy expression he uses to coax traumatized women into talking to him. "You know what, just get your ass in the car."
"Dean," Cas says again. He stands, gathering his coat up, draped over one arm.
A glance at one of her bookshelves raises Dean's eyebrows. He can see all the Tolkien books, and he spots some Batman comics he recognizes from killing time in the library while watching Sam when they were growing up. He'd love to spend a couple hours looking through them all, but he fights the urge.
"What do you need?" Dean says without hesitation. Maybe he should be more wary of putting their fates in Rowena's hands, but he's starting to get used to having her around, like an annoying roommate. Also he quietly suspects that Sam's screwing her behind his back, which… Like, okay, he's got some critiques about Sam's taste, but Dean can't exactly criticize when he looks at his own history.
Sam scoffs. "Yeah, like dad ever would've let me put one of those bumper stickers on the car."
Dean heads for the bathroom himself after finishing off a second fruity little apple drink and is surprised to find the girl still in there, hunched over the sink. He feels weird being in here, like someone's going to catch him and toss him out, but it's not like he can go to the Men's looking like he does. He can hear her sniffling and trying to breathe evenly while he's sitting in the stall. When he comes out to wash his hands, he peers over at her. She's a short little thing, light brown skin, with tight ringlets curling over her trembling shoulders while she tries to keep her hands steady enough to pluck out her contact lenses.
"Yeah, I'm fuckin' rolling, over here."
"I meant what I said." Castiel's lips skate over each of his eyelids, then his cheek, then his mouth.
He grabs one of everything off the racks and takes them into a fitting room, examining himself in the mirror. His boobs are bigger than Lisa's, he's pretty sure of that, at least. A shrink would probably have a field day with the weird sense of pride he feels about it. It's not like he did any
To be truthful, it's nothing at all like flying. There's no folding of dimensional wavelengths, or even a facsimile of it, like in the hall of mirrors. Dean conceives of an angel's flight as being like a bird's, but in truth it's more like skipping the line for a ride, where the line is the concept of linear time.
"I didn't have a vulva before," Cas says, voice low and just edging into breathless.
"Nothing. Anime, never mind. So—okay, so a witch—forcefemmed you."
Dean sputters. "What? No it's not."
"You don't wanna hear about this."
"Bad night? Sorry, none of my business, but..."
He drops his shorts and steps into the panties.
"Nothing. I made coffee. You want?" Sam stands abruptly, going to the cabinet to get a mug for Dean before he can even answer.
It's not like someone has to be
, I—" Dean's orgasm lances through him, white-hot and overwhelming. Cas holds him through it, fisting his cock until Dean's shooting streaks of come up his chest in pulses, over his belly, over Castiel's knuckles. When he sinks, boneless, back to the bed, Cas keeps stroking him until it's just this side of too much, letting Dean's cock slowly soften in the palm of his hand. Dean should probably feel self-conscious, and he's so overstimulated it makes him want to pass out a little bit, but he also feels so strangely, completely safe. Cas has him. He's not going anywhere. The weight and depth of his regard is bigger than anything Dean's ever felt, big enough to let him sink into. To be held by.
"It was a bad couple of months," Dean says by way of explanation, his jaw working as he tries not to let it show just how bad it really got. "It's fine."
(Dean smothers a nervous laugh at that) and that he'll always have his back.
"I'm glad for her," Castiel says. "I don't mourn the relationship, if that's what you mean. But Daphne was kind to me when I was alone in the world. She didn't have to be."
"I'm just borrowing it," Dean mutters, and goes to stand behind where Castiel is sitting on the couch. "Gonna fix Cas's hair."
"It's okay," she says, studying her hands in her lap. "I want you to."
"You did?"
"And I sounded like I was shooting you down. So in this instance, I'm the one who's an asshole."
"Excuse me?" says Dean.
They all gather in the basement, preparing the spell in an empty room which Rowena selects because it's out of the way and easy to clean, the thought of which ramps Dean's anxiety up a few notches, because what's the blast radius on this thing, exactly? She draws a sigil in chalk on the floor and lights white candles that make Dean's eyes water. She also asks Cas to undress, which Dean puts his foot down about.
"Thanks for the ride," she says. "You wanna come up?"
Dean pauses. No one's ever asked him that before, but now that he thinks about it, he's seen Lisa and her girlfriends do that on outings, all ordering different drinks and letting each other have a taste. This is how women bond. It's just being friendly. He smiles.
"No," Dean says hazily. He's not sure which question he's answering.
I'm gonna stay up here. You bring breakfast back. Is that enough of a compromise for you?"
"Shut the fuck up," Gwen says, laughing broadly.
"Her name is Haleigh," Jack says kindly.
And after that, Dean doesn't have time to worry about where Cas's head is at, or what he admitted in front of Sam, or the spell, because within an hour all of that takes a backseat to the fact that Sam doesn't have a fucking soul.
There's an idea. Dean inherited all his parents' worst traits, so why not just lean into it?
"Sam, where the hell are you?"
"That's it? Huh." Sam looks at Dean again. Dean can practically see him crunching the numbers in his head. "Well, until then, as a feminist—"
"Okay, good. Cause we've got Lucifer's son and an evil witch living in our house, and they're eating all our olives. I can't deal with that by myself," he says with a wet laugh.
Castiel is really worried about you.
"Yeah, I'll die if I don't. It's a whole thing," he says, popping a fry into his mouth and grinning. The guy falters a little bit, but he slides onto the stool next to Dean anyway. He's not bad looking. He's tan from time in the sun, dark hair shaved close to his head, with a neat beard and friendly blue eyes. Two days as a chick and Dean's already getting reasonable offers. He's better at this than he thought he'd be.
"What?"
When she finally wakes, it's just to tell Dean to put on something a little less grating. He grumbles for a minute before switching out
The girl follows him out of the bathroom, introducing herself as Mina, and Dean forgets not to tell her his real name, though she seems to take it in stride. Maybe she heard him wrong over the shitty music, or maybe she thinks Dean's parents thought they were clever, giving their daughter a weird name. He tells her to ditch the bag boys to hang out with him at the bar, and she smiles and takes him up on it. Her friend at the other table makes a questioning face at her, which she waves off and ultimately ignores.
Dean kneels, and the illusion softens when Cas turns his head down to watch. He smooths his hands over Cas's knees, waiting.
"I like listening to you talk," Dean says, 'cause it's true. It's weirdly a total relief to hear about a normal person's problems for a change. It's also a relief not to have to explain whatever's going on with him to anyone else. Just the thought of it makes him want to drink until he can't think anymore. He's floating along pleasantly right now, and he'd hate to ruin that.
Dean chugs the rest of his beer.
"I mean, I don't really, but this is a cool freaking car," she says. Dean comes around the front, sliding in next to her and starting up the engine. Mina startles next to him, laughing nervously. "Haha, and
But Cas, he's still got a chance. It's not too late for him.
Dean lets it drop, even though he would have thought Cas would be the first person to call him a fucking moron. She's done it often enough before. He doesn't know what the hell she's thinking right now. He doesn't have the first goddamn clue.
"Everyone just rallied right the hell around him when he showed up," Gwen says, draining the last of her beer. Dean flags the waiter to get another pitcher. "Even though he's got this backwards-ass caveman mentality about protecting the delicate womenfolk. Fucker died in the seventies, but it's like his brain is stuck in the fifties. Uh, no offense," she adds unconvincingly.
"I don't need a lecture from you." Dean yanks his pants on, then goes for his shirt, shaking it out and shimmying into it. "You disappeared first."
you, then?"
"Hey, that's my brush," he says indignantly.
you?" Haleigh scoots away from Sam, her voice quaking.
"You manipulated little girls into bleeding themselves for you," Dean says. "How much teen spirit you got coursin' through your veins right now?"
"Well, no, not like… not like he usually sounds, but other than that," Dean says, feeling a little foolish about it. He doesn't know how he knows, he just…
"Don't get your titties in a twist." Bobby nudges Dean's shoulder.
"Chyeah, lemme know how that turns out. Tell me about your damn witch, then."
For this chapter, please note that the warnings have been updated with a
"I'd like to show you," Cas says, nudging Dean's forehead with his. Their noses brush. Water drips onto Dean's collar. The happiness Dean feels is like a physical force, ballooning inside his chest until it feels like it might burst. He doesn't know how to do this, has no precedent for it, but it hardly seems to matter.
"Well, I don't need a babysitter. I'll gladly get outta your hair."
of you, thank you so much," Mina says. She turns to her friend. "You off tomorrow?"
You helped me flirt with a guy for a job…
"That's not how I remember it," Cas says. "I knew you were lying, when you said the problem was solved, but— Dean, it's just getting worse."
Dean wants more. He wants to live through this. He wants Sam to live through this, to see what Dean sees in this place, to see what it can be for their family. All the mistakes they've made, all the loss, all of it can be another closed chapter in their lives. There's a future for them here. Dean just has to make it possible.
"Yeah, you're a greedy slut, aren't you?"
Did you get my last package yet?
There was no time, in Purgatory, to think of what Dean looked like to anyone else. How anyone would perceive him. There was no time to think of what he had left behind on Earth. Stopping to think would give death an opening. He had a promise to fulfill. In a way, it was Dean's life's work distilled down to its purest form.
Cas looks up, round-eyed and helpless. "I didn't like what he said to you."
"Ran into 'im at the store a couple years ago. Didn't recognize him, on account of he has a beard now. Got a new name and everything. Like Sonny and Cher's kid, I guess. I had to google some shit after. Dunno why I'm telling you alla this," Bobby adds, an afterthought.
That's the part that really stings. Not the blood welling up in his mouth, the split of his skin under Castiel's knuckles. That Dean could literally go to his knees before him, begging him to come back, knowing that he might be bargaining with his last breath, and Cas would still leave him. He'd escaped with his life, but the part of him that still hoped he and Cas could be… he doesn't know anymore, because he left that part of him behind in the crypt.
Dean slaps himself once, following the slap with another shake of the towel across his wet hair.
Would he even be a hunter? If he'd been raised a girl, would he still be a killer, or would his father have thought of him as something worth protecting?
"Okay, then you'll just keep doing this. Whatever this is," Sam says, gesturing at the two of them, awake before dawn, talking in circles in the kitchen. "Until Cas finally leaves for good. Cause that's working out so great for you."
of what I am. A defective angel. I'm proud to have defected. It's one of the few things about myself that I truly value. It's the thing about me that makes me myself. The thing that differentiates me from the Castiels in other universes, in other timelines, who never realized what it was to care for you. Other beings can see this… crack in me, this deviation from God's intent, and they call it a deformity. In a literal sense, it is. And I love it. Because without it, I would never have earned your trust. I might never have come to know you as I do now, never have learned all the incredible things you've taught me. I wouldn't have a family that I chose above the one that was chosen for me, who love the things about me that Heaven would call deviant. I wouldn't have a son."
"Jesus." Sam scrubs his hand over his mouth, chewing at a hangnail. "I thought he left me alone to punish me."
"See you Monday, then!" Mina waves goodbye. Her friend lifts her eyebrows in response, then returns to her group, still in the midst of settling their tabs and gathering their things. When she turns back to Dean, she looks positively giddy. "She's gonna be all up my ass about that later."
Forty-eight hours later, Dean's scrubbing blood out of his dress in a motel bathroom, cold water running over his thumbs. He's lucky he learned how to get bloodstains out of fabric when he was young. He's honestly just grateful that the dress is already red. It'd be ideal if it were black, but he'll take what he can get.
"Sorry. Shit, Cas, I didn't mean to—" Dean tries to pull his hand away. Castiel holds tight, swaying into his space, so close that his breathing stirs the hair falling into her face. He tenses, sucking in his stomach, trying to curl away from her. Dean's breath feels too loud, his heartbeat in his ears drowning out the sound of his own voice. "Cas?"
Castiel, human, beckons him closer.
she's kinda scary," Charlie says. "Like, she could kill you in a second if she wanted to. But she
Dean grabs himself coffee and a sandwich, considers it while he eats. He could try calling up Cas. It took a Biblical plague to get him down here last time, but maybe now that Dean's back on the board, he'll consider him worth a minute or two of his time. He doesn't know what's going on with that guy these days. He just went and traded one Holy War for another, no time to pause in between. Dean supposes he can't blame him. Dean tried to go domestic, and look how well that went. Cas has been an angel for aeons longer than Dean's been alive, but they're both soldiers. He knows peacetime isn't really
"Awesome."
"C'mon, Cas," Dean says. His eyes are wrinkled at the corners from how he smiles up at Cas. Dean licks his lips, like he's hungry. "Go on. Give it to me."
It's Dean's turn to look at her like she's stupid. Of course he wants the fucking truth. "You're not gonna hurt my feelings."
"Okay. That's a step. And, uh, before you think about how you're going to apologize. Because you're going to do that, because you're my brother, and you don't back down from shit that scares you, right?" Dean rolls his eyes, but Sam just laughs weakly. "Before you do that, I want to tell you that I love you, and I'm sorry. Because I think it must have been really… really hard to go through all that without anyone to talk to. And I hope you feel like you can talk to me about this, because you can."
Cas winds up the pitch. He throws. The ball sails through the center of the pyramid's base and through the back wall of the tent, shattering the milk jug at its center and sending the others clattering down. The carnie startles, muttering, "What the fuck?"
"Right?" Dean accepts the drink when she hands it back, savoring the forbidden apple-y sweetness. Mina orders something else, which arrives outrageously pink and garnished with cherries. Mina lets Dean steal a taste in return. It tastes like pie. Is this what he's been missing out on? Being a man sucks.
"Yeah, we can talk a little more. Maybe you can get me to come around on liking cars." She smooths out her jeans, tucking her hands into the oversized sleeves of her sweater. "Or we can call it a night, and I can say thank you for giving me a ride home, because that was really amazingly nice of you."
"Jack is a kid. A weird, literally brand spanking new kid, who's still learning about the world, and we're the ones who have to, you know, look after him and teach him, and—"
Sam stands, but then pauses, like he only just remembered he was kind of in the middle of something else. "You wanna come?" he asks Dean. "Take a break from reading?"
hitting as many marks as he ought to. Sometimes his stance was all wrong and his focus wasn't where he needed it to be and Dad would say,
The voice on the phone isn't one that Dean recognizes, except for the part where there's only one person it could be. But that doesn't make sense either. It's impossible.
is going on?" Dean just blusters past him, heading for the garage. "Where are you going?"
"I know that. I know I can't. Should I just stand by and watch you kill yourself again? I can't do that either."
"Right, go throw a tantrum about it if that's what you need to do, then!" Sam calls out after him, but Dean's already halfway to the garage.
Dean drops Sam at the motel and drives away, ostensibly to buy clothes, like he doesn't already have them. Dean guesses he could get more. He's got access to his stolen cards again. But that defeats the whole purpose of having gotten this out of his system. He doesn't need new clothes. It's not like he's ever going to be able to wear them again after this is over.
He ends up taking Bobby on a grocery run, because there's hardly anything in his fridge but questionable tupperware and condiments. Bobby stocks up on stuff for the pantry, but Dean also makes good on his pot roast plans, and when they get back to the house, Dean pulls a dutch oven out of the cabinet that he's pretty sure Bobby hasn't used in ten years to get it started.
Dean makes a noise somewhere between a laugh and a sob and kisses him.
Dean thinks about what he'd look like in a sundress. Until he figures out how to get his old body back, he's got two options: hide it, or embrace it. His brain stalls in the conflict between fear of looking like a joke and fear of actually looking good, but the draw of the latter is oddly compelling. The mere idea of examining that thought unsettles him enough that he has to gulp down another glassful of skunky beer.
"Okay, baseline, you oughta know what it feels like for
He hears the blip of Sam responding, but he doesn't look at his phone again until he's back at the bunker. Sam's waiting for him in the garage, looking like a disappointed parent, which is really a hilarious role-reversal for the two of them.
"You okay, buddy?" Dean grits out.
"What’s the point of saving humanity if you don't get to be a part of it?" Dean's chest clenches painfully to think of a world Cas saved without him in it. "You deserve to enjoy it as much as anyone, Cas. More than most people, honestly, even if you are a dick sometimes."
"Kind of a stretch, to link the two things together, don't you think?" Sam says, puzzling at the article.
people like them.
Castiel looks at him with a touch of guilt as Han shoots Greedo. "Sorry, Dean."
"Yeah, the other stuff too! I'm kinda freakin' out here, Sammy!"
Cas frowns, his apologetic tone fading. "I was trying to be helpful."
Dean looks at the two hunters, who look at him right back. There's always a faint aura of mistrust coming off the folks coming and going through the compound, either because despite Dean's pedigree he's really just not one of them, or because he's been out of the game so long and gotten so soft they consider him a liability. Now he's gotta wonder if Samuel, or worse, Christian, told everyone about his little switcheroo. He thinks about trying to play down the fact that he got a magical boob job while hunting with the asshole squad at the same time. He's pretty sure he'd rather eat glass.
"I knew I liked you, Castiel." Rowena says. "Listen to your very sensible feathered friend and your much more handsome brother, Dean."
"Jerk."
A pair of black panties draw his attention like a magnet.
Yeah they're funny as fuck
"As appealing as twelve solid hours of orcs and elves sounds after twelve solid hours of orcs and elves," Sam says, "I think I'm calling it a night."
What's the caper this week, fellas?
He ends up with fishnet stockings, black nail polish, and a black choker. That'll have to be enough to sell the look, cause he's not getting his ears pierced at a mall kiosk, and if Dean has to listen to one more whiny kid scream about lipstick stains over an out-of-tune guitar, he's gonna shoot the damn speakers out. He shoves it all into his secret bag of girly shit and drags it back to the motel. Maybe he can pass it off as having just bought all of it in one go.
"I don't want to hurt you, no," Cas says, low and dejected. "But I like—
"Thank you," Cas says, breaking Dean out of whatever thought he was lost in. His mouth quirks in a crooked smile.
"Right," Jody says. It's dark out, and Dean's dressed like a hooker, so he can't blame her for not recognizing him. He really wishes he'd kept his stupid mouth shut. "Why dontcha hop in?"
The clerk scans over the four of them, tense and untrusting, but after a moment, she holds the curtain back, ushering them in. Dean catches Castiel's eye, then Sam's. He pulls the pistol from his pocket, holds it ready just in case, letting the clerk see him do it.
"Uh, you've got a little... " He points, then reaches out, brushing it away from her forehead. Cas sucks in a sharp breath. Her eyelashes flutter. In the dark, she looks so much like her old vessel.
"It was a joke," Dean says. "I'm being the woman."
We're kind of busy right now let me know if something actually important happens
"Just because I lost my wings doesn't mean I can't feel you." Cas sits on the bed next to him and places a hand on his shoulder. She's speaking softly, but there's still a thread of anger in her voice and in her grip. "I hear you, calling out to me. I will
"Glad you're familiar with the source material," Sam says with a shitty little smile. Dean flips him off. He's not about to tell Sam he's already got the perfect disguise for the job.
"Okay, yeah, look— this is, um, it's gonna be kinda hard to explain—"
Dean looks down at Castiel's socked feet on the tile, because it's easier than looking him in the eye.
"If you girls are done?" Samuel says with a roll of his eyes. And evidently he's not the family picnic type, because he's back on the road inside of five minutes.
"Oh shit," she says, covering her face with her hand.
"I am not trying to
"The mausoleum?"
Bobby rolls his eyes with a put-upon toss of his hands. "Give me a damn minute, Speedy Gonzales. Spent all day reading up yesterday, just gotta go over my checklist with you, now you're here."
Dean rakes a hand through his hair, groaning aloud, "God, this is so fuckin' gay." He could lie to himself and say it isn't. He's gotten really good at that, too. Instead, he punches the wheel with the base of his fist and turns the car around, going to bring back a bag of sandwiches and potato chips from the corner store like he promised he would. He throws in a Milky Way for Jack, and a fifth of Jim Beam for himself. He's gonna need it if he wants to sleep at all that night, and the two beers he had stashed in the cooler only did so much the night before.
and someone has to be
"Are we her guidance counselors now?"
"What does that mean?"
He's never had sex with a man. He doesn't count what him and Lee used to do together sex, 'cause that was just hand stuff. Plenty of straight guys mess around sometimes, and then they get over it, Dean thinks. He's never let a guy fuck him, is the point. He let a girl stick her finger in his ass once, when she was blowing him, and he'd liked that enough he couldn't really look her in the eye after, but that was nothing like getting fucked.
"I just miss you, is all," he mumbles, feeling the blush rise up his neck. Nobody can even see him, but god, he's embarrassing.
Jack smiles broadly. "Principal Andrews, these are my fathers."
Something ugly and cruel in him whispers,
"No, I know that," Dean groans. "I'm just— I dunno." He paces in the empty room, anxiously peeking out the window to see if Sam's back with dinner yet. Dean's never been one to complain about fast food, but if he's honest, he's gotten kind of used to cooking for himself. It's been… well, nice, not to have to eat stuff that came out of a bag all the time. It makes him feel accomplished when something comes out just the way he imagined it. It feels like a job well done, keeping his family fed. "It's not— I trust you, Cas, of course I do."
"Don't think you can bribe me with all-you-can-eat waffles, either." Dean mills around the room, peeking into what he hopes is a mini-bar, but is actually just an empty mini-fridge. He slaps the door shut with an irritated noise.
to fight for. Running into a fight with a death wish, that's an easy way to punch your ticket early and end up losing. You gotta have
"Just seemed like I oughta. Cause he was real happy, you know? After I said hey, Hank, that's his name now, Hank. Good to see you. You look good. He did, too. Old as shit, cause we're all old as shit now. But he looked happy. Happier'n my dumb ass ever made him when we were kids."
"Shut up," Dean mutters.
"I don't know if it is or not, Dean, because you won't fucking talk about it!" Sam stops himself, realizing he's nearly shouting, and lowers his voice significantly, though his face is still twisted with desperate confusion. "You won't talk to me, and Cas is my friend too, and I'm just trying to figure out what's going on."
"I like you a lot. But if you're uncomfortable, it's cool. We can just..."
"Doesn't everyone?" Dean gnaws on his lip, afraid to delve too deep into what he wants to ask. "When you were watching, did you wanna… you know, try it?" He can see the frown on Cas's brow, the way his shoulders stiffen. "Sex, I mean. In general. I mean, I wasn't sure if angels…"
The back room is lined with shelves and drawers. A candle flickers away on a desk littered with jars and stacks of books. In the center of all this is an overstuffed chair, in which a small, fine-boned woman sits. Her face is long and sharp, her copper-red hair cropped short and curling around her ears. Her vibrant eye makeup matches the jewel tones of her long dress, and she reclines with all the careless attitude of the cat who caught the canary.
"Of course not!" Cas looks up again, alarmed. "Of
"Hitting the undo button until he's him again?"
"I'm buying," Gwen says. Dean's jaw works. He ditched his phony cards months ago. He got paid in cash under the table at his construction jobs, and all that money stashed in his duffel is money he earned legit, but he's gonna be back to hustling pool if he keeps spending what's left of it, and his… situation might complicate that, if it lasts too long.
"Cas,
Dean thinks about Cas, holding his hand, calling his soul 'beautiful'. He thinks about Benny, all loyalty and trust, while he stood there and watched Dean take a blade to his neck. Then he drinks until he can't think about it anymore.
"I dunno," Dean says, and tousles his hair a little, not that it needs the help. "You let me approach you. You gonna fix my car, sweetheart?"
Biblical Purgatory. Nothing but monsters roaming around killing each other. Got stuck there for a year taking out Dick Roman. Benny helped me and… helped me get out, so he hopped a ride to the surface. I was… helping him get his un-life together, off and on, but. Y'know. Vampire. Hunters and vampires, we don't really…" Dean shrugs. "So yeah."
The guy grabs his dick and presses the head against him.
"Is Jack up?"
, and then the water just made it worse—"
Dean takes a bottle of seltzer. He hates seltzer, but maybe it will be distracting in how much it tastes like licking a drain pipe full of pop rocks.
"I don't have a—"
"This is what we do," Dean says. Haleigh looks between the four of them, her hands shaking, looking like she'd have bolted already if they weren't blocking the door. "Now just calm down, and tell us what's going on."
"I just need," the girl says, gritting her teeth. She has a contact case open on the counter. "Fuck, thank you," she says when she manages to retrieve a lens from her eye, and as she blinks, more tears spill out over her cheeks. "Fuck dammit." Once she's removed them, washed, and patted dry her face, she fetches a pair of regular eyeglasses from her purse. "Sorry. Ugh, god."
"The fishsticks appeared suddenly in the cafeteria one day," Jack explains. "There's no evidence that anyone actually entered the building in order to leave them there. That's why it was called a miracle."
"You know he's kinda too busy for me these days," Dean says gruffly.
He pauses, then adds:
Cas smiles softly, arms crossed on the picnic table. "No thank you," he says. "Go ahead, eat."
"I just wanna focus on you," he says quietly, coming back to kiss her again. She hums into his mouth, acquiescent. That's good. Now that he's this far undressed, he sort of doesn't want to go further. Maybe it's stupid, but they're pretty, these new clothes of his, and somehow they make him prettier just by being on him. He sort of needs that right now. He's not interested in thinking about why. It's much simpler to just lean his head back, tugging Mina's hips up until she's straddling his chin.
"That wasn't," Dean croaks, his voice betraying him. "That wasn't your fault."
"Okay, honey." He's asleep before Cas can process what he's said.
"Of course I knew him," Jack says. Dean doesn't think he's ever seen the kid look this content. "He and I spoke before I was born."
Cas lets his thumb slip from Dean's mouth when he looks ready to take more of his cock, but Dean surprises him, ducking his head to the tightening skin of his balls and sucking one into his mouth, then the other. His cock slots up against the side of Dean's nose and over his brow, and Dean grips it while his mouth works Cas over, practically nuzzling him. Then he's aiming Cas back where he wants him, mouthing the head and running his tongue along the leaking slit.
Dean glances back, holding in a laugh. He's pretty sure he's used that line on a girl before. Never expected to hear it from this end.
"Everything does," Cas says, her voice low, and her face falls into a little pout of consternation. Dean tries to smother a smile. "It's all just… molecules and chemical compounds. The only thing I can compare it to is Diet Coke. It
plays the opening notes of "In the Light" he just ejects it again, pulling off onto the shoulder and sitting in the idling car in silence. He pulls his phone out for the first time since he started driving. To his surprise, he's got a missed message from Cas.
"Now, Cas?
"Dean," Cas says, like he's disappointed. Dean's face heats, and he grits his teeth, turning around to escape the way he came.
Rowena is starting to look better, now that Dean's actually paying attention. She's taken to sitting in one of the leather chairs in the library while Sam distracts himself with cataloguing everything on the shelves. Right now she's reading through one of the books with a mug of tea beside her. Her hair's grown out a bit more, and she's got enough energy to start looking like a gilded beetle again, her eyelids glittering with powder. She can get around more easily by herself, too, which is both good and bad, because now they really have to make sure they watch her around the books. Sam's started hiding the really dangerous stuff in the basement store room and keeping the door locked.
"Yes."
"Shit. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, I didn't realize." Mina touches his arm, her eyes apologetic. Dean just wants to go back to the part where they were having a good time. He shrugs.
again. He's actually
"Oh, hey, morning. Didn't hear you," he lies. "Sleep okay?"
"Fuckin' finally," Dean says again, against the corner of Cas's mouth. "Christ, you're drivin' me crazy here, Cas."
"How about I show you what it's like?" He clears his throat. "Just, you know. So you're ready for it. When it happens for real."
Dean's brain screams, imagining Cas slotting up behind him, fucking him from behind while this guy takes the front. He's seen that in porn before, too, but this is
I mean there's tits and stuff but it's not like sweet princess asuka or anything
Dean thinks desperately. '
"Am I?" His head cocks to the side, his mouth still curved in a smile.
"Seriously?"
"Okay, here," Dean says, and grabs Cas's phone out of Jack's hand. He waves Cas and Jack over, until they're in the frame together. "Do a duckface."
And that had stood out to him, because Dad was usually the one telling Dean when he messed up. Sometimes Dean's grip really
— Okay, smart guy, you wanna be cute, what's the deal with you and Rowena?"
"I can help," she protests.
Heart in his throat, he even tries getting a hold of Cas. "Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray Castiel will pick up the damn phone," he says quietly. His hands make loud rustling noises on top of the blankets in the dark room. "It's just you and me, buddy, if you're listening up there. Or wherever you are. You there, Cas, or are you too busy shanking halos? Cas? Castiel?"
Images flash through his head: blue eyes glowing so bright they burn out. Black wings seared into the sandy ground. The last embers of a hunter's funeral. A flash of red staggers past him. The air is hazier the closer he gets to the kitchen, where dark smoke is rolling across the ceiling. In the corner is Jack, hands outstretched, Cas standing in place at the gas range, his arms engulfed in flame.
Shit. I'm so sorry. You want me to call?
"Okay, Pip, you're gonna have to break that one down for me. What counts?"
"Dean," Castiel says, like there's nothing that brings him more joy. Just saying his name. He holds Dean's hand, knife pointed down at their feet, against his sternum, stepping close enough to share breath. Castiel's lips are dry and chapped, parted open on a sigh. "Dean."
"I've just had to lose too many goddamn people," Dean says. "I dunno if I can do it again. I—and Sam, he's—I dunno, Charlie. I dunno."
"Wouldn't get much work done," Dean huffs.
"She's hot
He doesn't have a hairbrush, which is how he excuses getting all ten of his fingers on her head and scratching his way down her scalp, gently tugging his fingers through to get the tangles out. There aren't many snags this time, and he gradually combs it out, tucking it behind her ears and trying to brush it away from her face as best he can before he starts braiding. There's a few wispy little stray hairs at the back of her neck that escape no matter how much he tries to manipulate them. When he reaches the end, it takes real effort to summon his voice to ask if she's got a tie. Cas holds up her hand. The tie is secured around her wrist. Dean slips his finger under it, easing it over and off her rigid hand. Her fingers are long, the nails blunt and short.
Cas looks at him tremulously. "I—I wouldn't know how to fix your car, Dean."
"The police would've seen us."
"I don't care," Dean says. "I just don't want him to get hurt." He ducks his head when Sam's face softens into a smile.
He loads up a tray with whatever's quickest. None of it looks that good to him at the moment, honestly, but he can't have Sam giving him any more Concerned Sam™ looks. Yogurt cups, a few dinged-up bananas and oranges, a single-serving box of Apple Jacks, a muffin, and two coffees. He can probably choke at least one of those things down.
Fact is, his brother had always wanted more from life than Dean could give him, and that hurt more than he wanted to admit. Dean had been the one to drag Sam back into this life, kicking and screaming. Now Dean's finally starting to see his perspective, and here's Sam, worn down to practically nothing, saying he's done running from it, and all Dean wants is for him to run as far away as he can get. He'd give anything for Sam to throw in the towel, to say he quits, that he's giving this all up to go back to school. Or hell, anything else. Sam's smart and he works harder than anyone when he sets his mind on something. Sam should be a lawyer, or a teacher, or a goddamn alpaca farmer. He shouldn't be killing himself trying to slam the gates on Hell.
"Okay, shatter all my illusions why don't you," Dean says. "They probably only talk to virgins anyway, right?" He takes a glass and fills it with water from the tap, sitting across from Jack at the kitchen table. "What're you up to?"
Dean coughs out a laugh. "Uh, funny you should ask, Cas." Dean sweeps a hand across his body.
Mina's laughing shyly. "This is usually what I listen to when I study. If it's weird I can turn it off."
I left it in the
There's a table in the center of the room, a knife with an ugly edge and a handle carved from antler jutting from the wood. Beside him is a man, threadbare clothes and careworn features. He holds Dean's hand, long, blunt fingers woven into his. His hair curls around his ears with rough-shorn edges, his beard in need of trimming. He releases Dean, walks over to the table, and, with some effort, tugs the knife from the wood. He looks up, a dreamy smile on his lips. His eyes are dark, wide pupils rimmed with blue.
"What is so damn important that we need to shack up with the witch? Do I have to remind you the shit she's done to us? To you in particular?"
Sam snorts. "I mean, sure, that. But not just that. She… She doesn't handle me with kid gloves."
"How'd you guys even get into all this stuff?"
. Except for how he keeps doubting himself.
After a bit, Dean asks, "How'd your hunt with Claire go?"
. Dean doesn't make a lot of friends, living the way he does, and Benny had gone and moved himself up in the ranks as one of the closest he's had.
"No, I like it," she says. "You can… Please, if you don't mind."
on a battered old TV. Dean sitting shotgun in the Continental and hearing the mixtape he made for Cas coming out of the speakers, watching Cas mouth along with his favorite lyrics. Castiel, who saw the birth of life on this planet, who watched the stars and the planets formed from nothing, who has lived through more lifetimes than Dean's mind can comprehend, content to sit with him in a greasy diner, knocking knees with him under the table while Dean eats and debating whether he ought to spend a quarter on Dusty Springfield or Elvis.
"I'm reading the news," Jack says.
"You mean yesterday?" Dean swallows, heat prickling down into his belly.
"For the most part, yeah," Charlie says. "That has its good points, though. You know. For people like us."
"Like a heartbeat drives you mad," Stevie croons, "in the stillness of remembering what you had, and what you lost."
"I want you to stay," Dean says, voice straining in the quiet. "Please. I want you to stay with me. I want… I want
The walk back to the car is quiet and companionable. Safely ensconced in the Impala, Dean gnaws anxiously at the skin of his lower lip.
"That's bullshit," Dean says. "What's the point of doing all this, then?"
"I— yeah?" Dean clears his throat, glancing back at Sam, who thankfully seems occupied by shaking up a plastic tub of salad.
They've got a whole library full of books, but they're all about monsters and crap, so Dean keeps a milk crate in the back seat of the car and starts filling it every time they go out on a job. A used bookstore they pass by in Nebraska has the
, and moves on.
It's not fair for Cas to come back like this and shake everything up. To give him an excuse to act the way he could never allow himself to. To touch and be touched. To do so openly, where anyone could see them.
She startles a little, stepping back and turning to him with her chin tucked down guiltily. "I'm sorry… I wanted to return your clothes." Now that she's turned toward him, Dean can see his jeans and flannel folded neatly in her arms.
"Dean, why didn't you ever say something?" When he glances back up, Sam's looking at him with big, sad I'm A Sensitive Guy eyes, and Dean wants to jump in the car and drive as far away from it as possible. "I mean, you know… you
Sam examines Haleigh's setup more closely, his eyes scanning over the mess she's made of it, and at the open book on the desk by her tripod. "This is… This is some seriously powerful stuff for a kid to be messing with."
"End of conversation, Sammy!" Dean shouts, and Sam recoils an inch, his mouth clicking shut. "Jesus fucking Christ." Dean turns, marching toward his room, yanking the door open, and tossing his bag inside before continuing down the hall. "I'm taking a shower."
Cas doesn't mind the heat, but Dean looks happier at the picnic bench under the oak tree. He really ought to use sunscreen—they haven't been at the fair for an hour yet, but he's already pink across his nose and cheeks, and the backs of his arms where they aren't covered by his t-shirt. He spears a round, fat strawberry with his plastic fork and pops it into his mouth. He moans faintly around it.
Dean gasps.
Dean wets his lips. His eyes blink open slowly. Cas must have turned the light out while Dean was sleeping; everything has a hazy, monochrome quality to it in the darkness, but he can make out enough to tell that he's basically face-level with Castiel's breasts. Yeah, there are definitely worse ways to wake up in Dean Winchester's book.
"Right. You want any help with—"
Dean walked into that one. Poor guy.
He'd tried taking Cas out to experience the good side of living on Earth firsthand. Didn't really go as planned, though it's still one of the high points of Dean's ridiculous life. Seems like a shame for Cas to give his whole life up for humanity if he doesn't even get to enjoy the perks.
"Sorry for making you see it, then."
"Thank you, Dean."
Jody leans back, giving him space. Dean pictures himself through Jody's gaze, a billboard with haunted eyes and the number for a hotline for victims of human trafficking. An unsteady laugh escapes him.
"Sure, Cas, anytime." Dean scrubs a hand back through his hair. His bashful smile warms Cas through. "Honestly, I'm surprised we don't do jobs at places like this more often. Pretty sure half of all carnies in the continental U.S. are some kinda spooky something-or-other." He knocks his knee against Cas's, on purpose this time. Cas knocks right back.
"A shared hatred of Satan?"
And then, things are just… normal. Dean's body doesn't know how to relax into it. He's been in his head about this for such a long time— weeks? Depending on how you count it, years; maybe even since he was old enough to know to be worried.
Once, he had demanded fear and respect, seen it as his due as a soldier of God. Now it sickens him to think that Dean could be afraid of him.
"Look, I know you're pretty mad about Rowena," Sam says, and Dean's so genuinely caught off guard that he laughs for the first time in days, a little snort and a huff. Honestly, he'd been so distracted by everything else, he forgot to be mad about that.
Shockingly, there's not all that much to be found in the Campbell library on this kind of thing. There's plenty of lore on weird gender-fuckery among various non-human species (the lore on shapeshifters makes Dean's head hurt a little) and there's generalized talk on breaking curses, but they all come to the same conclusion: undoing a curse is basically the same as casting it, just in reverse. To do that they need a witch with the know-how and the materials to reverse-engineer the spell. The closest they've got is Bobby.
"No—Well." Dean puzzles that out. "They have to act like they don't wanna have sex, because people talk shit about sluts. Not me, though," he says proudly. "I
"Bobby," Dean says, "it's me."
He thinks about it when he's scrubbing red facepaint off his face in the shower, and he thinks about it lying down and staring at the shadows drawn across the ceiling when he's trying to sleep. He's still thinking about it when they stop for gas and breakfast at a Gas 'n Sip on their way out of town. Sam hands him a cup of coffee and sets a bag of granola bars and a banana on the seat between them. When Dean doesn't say anything right away, Sam waves his hand in front of Dean's face, like he's snapping him out of a trance.
"It'd be nice if ghosts actually dropped gold coins and shit when you iced 'em."
Dean's jaw works. He sucks in a breath and holds it, fuming.
of me." Rowena's voice is low and wounded. Her body quakes to stand. She looks like she might crumple, but Sam ducks to catch her arm, his hand at her back guiding her back into her chair. "I can't just— I can't just lie here, helpless, when he might—"
Rowena scoffs. "He means he wants to put me under house arrest."
Cas nods. "The sigil is meant to concentrate existing magical power, to… to amplify it. This Haleigh might actually be a witch."
Dean gasps.
forgive you, Cas. You think I haven't made just as many mistakes as you have? You ever think I don't wanna be me sometimes, too?"
"I can still see it." Castiel breathes the words into him. "Your soul. Layered over your body, like ink bleeding through paper." He untangles his hand from Dean's, holding his face, thumbs rubbing circles over his cheeks. "When you're happy, it's like it's bursting with light. Green and gold. Sunlight through the leaves." Dean's eyes fall open, disbelieving. Cas sighs, kissing him softly again. "Yes, like that."
Okay, so he needs to keep it down if he doesn't want to alert the entire bunker. Got it. Not that it's easy when Castiel's rolling his hips like he's trying to start a fire or something. Then Cas is reaching down between them, taking Dean in hand, holding still long enough to get him lined up so that he can slide inside. Cas breathes in sharply when Dean bites down on his shoulder to muffle the sound that threatens to spill out of him. The gasp turns into an unabashedly loud groan as Dean sinks in deep.
"Okay sounds great Cas gotta go bye!"
"I dunno," Dean mutters. His whole head feels like it's burning, and it's not just the alcohol. "Maybe—maybe six."
Dean nods along. He remembers when the switch flipped for Sam, when he got to be old enough that John decided he wasn't supposed to be babied anymore. Dean had been the one to spill the beans about their dad's real job, but there had been a childish sort of wish behind the admission even then.
"All this ugly shit in my head, and you said I… you said my soul was 'beautiful'. And I couldn't even ask if that was true, if you really meant that."
The guy that takes him home doesn't care what his name is, or how cool his taste in drinks is, or even how much time Dean spent trying to make himself look like a centerfold. He's not taller than Dean, but he's broader, and his hands are thick and rough and perfect when they peel Dean out of his little red dress like peeling the sticker off an apple.
"Got it. I'll just clear out before you guys bust out the hand mirrors to study your vaginas or whatever."
Sam and Samuel turn up later that day, rumbling into the scrapyard like a stormcloud. Dean pours himself another cup of coffee and watches Bobby and Samuel size each other up like a couple of fighting dogs.
"But yeah, she, uh. She liked anime, and we'd stay up too late in the TV room with whatever we could get from the Blockbuster, until we got in trouble for that. And then we started staying up late sleeping over in each others' beds, reading comics under the covers with a flashlight. And then, uh. Well. Y'know." Charlie bites her lip, resting her head on the side of the couch. The movie plays on, totally forgotten. "Until people found out, and then I was Our Lady of Not Allowed At That Group Home Anymore," Charlie says, laughing awkwardly. "So, yeah, I figured out, you know, if they're right about me, then like. I can either try really hard to prove them wrong, or I can just say, you know what? Frack you. I
Jody waits for him to start his car and drive away before she follows. He's popped a different tape into the deck for the drive back, one of the ones Dad would only listen to when he was real quiet and feeling sorry for himself, because Mom had loved it. Judy Collins croons, low and rambling, and then jubilant,
Dean swipes his tongue across his lip, swallowing panic. He hadn't thought far enough ahead to think he'd need a name. "Dee," he blurts out, which isn't really a lie. He can say it's short for Deanna, which isn't really a lie either. He hears Bobby's voice in the back of his head,
thought about it. Maybe once he's had a chance to prepare a little. "Later. Definitely. Uh, rain check."
, fuck."
He can't look at Cas for long. It makes him feel too much, his head too full. He can still feel his eyes on him, on his face, on his body, watching some other man's dick plunge into him, making him arch and strain and clench his fists into the sheets. It's been more than a year since Cas told him he'd never been with anyone like this before. Has that changed? Dean doubts it. Does Cas even know what it feels like, or can he only guess from watching? Dean wants him to know it's good, wants him to know what he's missing out on. He bites his lip between sharp teeth.
Dean cracks an egg into the pan. The shell splits, parts almost evenly into halves, allowing its contents to slide into the oil to pop and crackle and set in the heat. Wet eggwhite trails behind and sticks to his thumb. Dean tosses the shell into the compost jar, and runs his hand under the faucet.
Then he thinks about angels watching over him, just like Mom used to tell him. He thinks about angels, pulling strings, shooting arrows, penning his parents in together like you'd breed animals. And then he thinks about Castiel, tearing the whole rotten operation down with a touch.
"A few weeks ago, there was another 'miracle'," Jack says, and clicks over to a new tab, where a second headline reads,
Dean has never been talked to like this by a woman before. "I'm not uncomfortable," he lies. "I like you too. We were having fun." He didn't plan for things to go this way, no, but he should be leaping at the opportunity to have sex with her. A year ago, he would have. Right? Even in this body, 'cause what red-blooded heterosexual man hasn't enjoyed watching a little girl-on-girl action? And he is. That's what he is, he tells himself. He is.
Dean's cheek spasms.
"Yello," comes Bobby's tinny voice through the phone. Dean's still nervous, but he feels his shoulders relax an inch.
Dean scrubs his fingers through his hair and down his face, forcing himself awake. "Thought you'd cooled it on watching me sleep."
"That's not what I mean, and you know it." She scratches her fingers back through her hair, stopping where her ponytail pulls it tight. "I. You know you can do whatever you want with your life, right? You don't have to wait for… for something crazy like a
Not Mary Winchester, the homemaker in a consignment shop sundress, the woman who sang "Hey Jude" when she tucked him into bed, the woman John Winchester mourned with violence for twenty years. Mary Campbell, the hunter's daughter. The girl who grew up with salt on the windowsills and holy water on the nightstand, just like Dean had. She had wanted more from life, and for a few years, she'd tried to have it. She packed away the knives and the crucifixes and lied, and lied, and lied, every day of her life, to give her family the normalcy she'd never had.
"Shutting up," Sam says, tossing his hands up in surrender. A minute later he ruins it again. "I just wanna say, I think it's nice to see you—"
What would Dad think if he knew about Jack? Hell, what would he think about Cas?
collection when he was thirteen. Of course, they'd made a deal where Dean promised not to tell Bobby if he got to look, too, but he doesn't think that play's gonna work here.
"I'd offer to pay for dinner as an apology," Cas says, an untouched slice with Dean's name on it sitting in front of him on the table, "but I'm afraid I don't have any money."
when he was younger he was actually maybe, just a little bit, somewhere in the back of his head,
Samuel feeds them their next case, too, a string of vampire attacks back north. The missing all fit a profile: young, pretty but bookish, and when they follow the leads, it all points them to an honest-to-god goth nightclub.
"Sam, drop the Amelia Bedelia act." Dean crosses his arms. "It's okay."
"I…" Dean feels his face growing hot the longer it takes her to say anything. He clears his throat.
"This is real magic," Sam says.
There's not an immediate response. He knows he can't force Cas to respond. He also knows that if something were really wrong, he would have at least heard about it from Jody. But he still lies awake for a long time, unable to decide who to be more pissed at for the silence, Cas, or himself.
Nothing right now Sam's sick so we're taking a breather
He and Sam have been teaching Jack the fundamentals of hunting together, too, but there is one thing Dean feels solely responsible for, and that's Jack's cultural education. That's how Cas, Jack, Sam, and Dean all end up piled in the TV room, popcorn ready, watching
happened to him," Dean says through his teeth. "Second verse, same as the first."
"A whole month?" Dean tries to wrap his head around it. He'd thought his options were
"Not that I'm not grateful," Dean says, setting the beers down on the counter and popping her fridge open to put them away while Charlie digs through the takeout bag for her curry. "But I'm surprised you wanna hang out. Thought after last time all you wanted was a restraining order."
"Jesus, Cas," Dean says, blinking to keep from letting his eyes water. "Where's this all coming from?"
Sam gives him another look, which he pointedly ignores. Cas turns to look up at him with a question in her eyes, but Dean just gestures for her to turn back around, then gathers the snarls of her hair together in his hands, drawing it off her shoulders and over the back of the couch. He slides his fingers through it as best he can, separating it into sections, then starts from the bottom with the brush, working his way toward Castiel's scalp to detangle it.
do you keep calling him—what, are there pictures in those stupid books?"
And he's handsome, even if it's borrowed handsomeness. All those big ideas and contradictions sheathed in that perfectly normal human vessel make him something, someone different. Someone special. It's not hard to think that would appeal to some woman out there.
Castiel looks at him, oddly soft. Dean ducks his head again. He's not usually so shy about sex, but this feels different.
"It's not a waste," Dean says, but he brings his hands up to cup Castiel's jaw, skimming his thumbs over his bristling cheeks while he kisses him again. "You're here, right?"
It's a lot more abstract than that. Some kind of a confidence thing. Or at least it is for him. Looking at a guy and thinking he's cool, he's tough, he's got style, and being drawn to that— that's pretty normal, he thinks.
"Nearly-unlimited angelic powers, and you're using them like a sex towel."
"He was verbally abusing you. You wanted that?"
Sam is a wet blanket who spends the movie flipping through some dusty old book, but Dean still feels proud of his choice, because it's clearly a hit with Jack, who is following all the emotional highs and lows of young Luke Skywalker with rapt attentiveness. On his other side, Castiel is leaning forward with her elbows on her knees, watching quietly, but she keeps getting distracted and blowing her hair out of her face. A few errant locks keep falling into her eyes, and the more she shoves them out of the way, the more her hair turns into a bird's nest. Castiel rarely had tidy hair when it was short. The added length has made that fact disastrous.
get turned. Whoever that guy on the other side of the door was, it wasn't his brother.
"Nah, man, I'm just, you know… embarrassed."
"I miss waffles," Cas says a little wistfully. Dean puts a comforting hand on her shoulder.
so goddamn much when he runs, seriously, what is
Dean's too tall, his body too long for her to kiss him while she tiptoes her fingers down his stomach and under the band of his panties. He feels enormous next to her, somehow, taking up too much space in her little bedroom. She tugs the cups of his bra down to expose his nipples, a fun loophole to his bra-on rule that lets her slide her fingers into him while she mouths at his breasts. He does like that, the wet heat of her mouth followed by a shock of cold. She tries to slide his panties off, and he stops her again, praying she doesn't make him explain. Thankfully, she just keeps going, working his clit between her fingers.
"Cool," Sam says. They eat in relative silence for a while while Dean ignores the string of emojis Cas has sent him, before Sam ruins it by talking again. "You guys got everything figured out, then?"
"So you're not... Does that mean you never found some bangin' angel lady to settle down with? You know, when all this is over."
"And before that. When I kissed you. I could feel myself causing you pain, and I couldn't figure out how to stop. I thought I was pushing you too hard, too quickly. I'm sorry, Dean."
😎🧊🕶️❄️
He's really not what I expected an angel to be like. He's kind of a dork.
"I just—I mean, that's cool. Not cool that you broke up, but." Dean winces, because what the fuck is he
It's not even 5 AM yet. Dean throws himself out of bed and into his robe, rushing his way through a cold shower that leaves his teeth chattering. What the fuck. What the
Sam doesn't trust Cas. He thinks something's wrong with him. Dean thinks he's right, but he's afraid to say so out loud. He's afraid to bring him up, to say his name. He's afraid to even think about him too hard. He still doesn't know how Cas got out of Purgatory, and he's been acting weird the whole time he's been back. He flits in and out without warning, but he hasn't seen him since Crowley nabbed that Weenie Hut angel. The whole thing left Dean feeling off-kilter. He can't spend every day worrying about Cas, and he feels like Sam would be the first to tell him they can't afford the risk of praying to him, but he'd kind of gotten into the habit. Dean doesn't know what to do if he's not worrying about Cas.
"Whatever happened to her? Dean, um, told me about it, afterwards, but…" Sam glances at Dean uneasily. Neither of them particularly like remembering that chapter of their lives. Castiel likely doesn't remember it too fondly, either, though he certainly seemed to be enjoying his faith healer phase well enough before Dean showed up and ruined it.
"No, I'm stuck babysitting you, Tootsie."
Then Dean remembers— something Cas said a few days before.
"Maybe that's why," Dean says, eagerly seizing on any explanation. "Because we burned his body, so he needed… I mean he had to get one
"It's means I've been avoiding him, just as much as—" She looks up, then away, lips thinning. "Whenever I remember that I'm in this body, I feel so much
"Yeah, well." Dean taps his fingers on the steering wheel, feeling jittery. He doesn't like this conversation. He's not particularly enjoying the direction it took. He regrets ever bringing it up. "I had to learn sooner or later. If he got hurt, he'd need a getaway driver."
, Cas."
"Of course you only remember the dog," Dean mutters.
The ride back to the motel is comfortably quiet. Now that it's quieter, of course, there's nothing standing between Dean and his thoughts.
He thinks about Mom, putting away her knives and putting on a sundress, unwrapping a store-bought apple pie and presenting it to a child who couldn't tell them apart from the ones he saw on TV and would spend the rest of his life watching screens for guidance on what life should be like. He thinks about Dad, about the photos left behind in a box in the basement of a house that devours people whole. How he pasted over their mother with polaroids so he could tell them stories about an angel.
Cas sucks in a sharp breath. "The creation of Nephilim is one of the most profane acts under Heavenly law."
"I know! I was kidding! Jeez, sorry," Sam says, and almost looks contrite as Dean starts up the car and takes them back out on the road.
"Right. Got it." He has not got it. "That was—that was stupid, and, you know, it makes sense. Like, if I were a chick, I'd wanna be a chick I thought was hot," he says before he can stop himself. "Hypothetically," he adds, when Charlie looks at him oddly. "But… I dunno, if you date people you wanna be like, don't you just get jealous or feel… like, not good enough?"
are two different things, aren't they?
"Oh," Charlie says, her eyes going round. "Well... shit."
"Don't worry your wee head about it," Rowena says, picking up on the silent exchange. "Did you really think I hadn't figured out who Jack is by now? I know you're not the brightest Winchester, but honestly. Jack's nothing like his father. He's a good, honest little boy, aren't you Jack?"
Something is pounding on the door. Dean recoils from the sound, cowering. Irrational little-kid fear surges through him, and he wipes at his eyes with the backs of his hands, holding his arms over his head. A second later, it occurs to him that he has a gun, that he needs to get his gun
"I still don't get what actually
to be. Besides, Dean had stopped stealing sugar packets and half and half from diners after his stint at Sonny's, and that meant training himself to enjoy the taste of black coffee.
"Sorry," he croaks. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't've—
"Stop." Castiel's voice is strained, like it's taking all of her strength just to speak. Dean's stomach drops and cold anxiety creeps in. Her fingers tighten on his wrist. Dean flinches.
I asked him to go out and pick up snacks because he was starting to distract me with all the fidgeting and pacing around and asking about you and Sam.
Dean won't stop looking at him.
Dean shuts his mouth. Cas looks at the ceiling, eyes darting back and forth like he's trying to read through the script of his own memories.
"Don't get me wrong, I, uh— I mean. Jesus." He's thought about it. He's
Dean look I know you're pissed at Castiel but he hasn't come back from the store yet and it's been a while and I'm kind of worried. Does he have a cell? Should I pray to him or something???
Dean pushes past Cas to grab his pants off the floor, fishing his phone out of the pocket. There are seven missed calls, and twice as many texts. He turns off the screen, running his fingers over his face.
"Dean, shut up for like, a second. Please?" Dean shuts up, but that doesn't mean he has to be happy about it. Sam hunches down to speak to him in a hushed but fervent tone, one hand on his shoulder and the other splayed in an attempt at a calming gesture. "Look, can you just… can you please be cool about this?"
"My mom's sitting in a box in the trunk of my car," Charlie says. Dean looks down at her sharply. "I, uh. It went really fast. After they disconnected the machine. I read to her for a little bit, but around the time they got to Mirkwood, I looked up, and she, uh… she was…" Dean can hear her throat working. He squeezes her hand, and feels her squeeze back. "She, uh. She already kinda didn't look like my mom. Like, the way I remember her, she was so—so vibrant, and laughing all the time, I can remember her laugh so well, and then there's just this person lying in a bed, looking so
This is another thing he's picked up after a year of watching Lisa go through her morning routine. The only other woman he'd been so close with was Cassie, and she hadn't ever let Dean in on her morning routine. She just always showed up looking perfectly put together. Lisa was the one that showed him how much work must have gone into that. He starts with the eyeliner, leaning over the sink and trying to line it up with his lash line. It's harder than it looks, keeping a steady hand and not stabbing yourself in the eye. Dean wondered why Lisa always had to make a goofy face while she applied makeup, but he finds himself doing it without meaning to. The lines are shakier than he wants, and he has to go over them a few times to get them sort of even. Then he has to repeat the process on the other side, which means even more frustration as he tries to match the coverage on both eyes. He ends up with much thicker eyeliner than he intends.
"Yeah. Your big war. The thing taking up all your time and energy and give-a-shit."
"I wanna…" Dean huffs in frustration, radiating heat. There are times when Cas believes him audacious, reckless. Other times he is as shy as a child. Cas is helpless, in either case. He wants to know what Dean wants. He hears the button of his trousers pop, feels the rough slide of Dean's fingers into his waistband, the edge of a fingernail catching on his skin. "Can't stop thinkin' about it."
"I have an idea," Sam says, and looks at Dean like he's about to get punched for it. Dean grits his teeth, but bids him to continue. "Honeypot?"
"Maybe next time," he says. The road stretches out ahead of them, the wind roaring past, and for a little while, Cas doesn't miss flying at all.
Even Sam can't argue with the amenities, though. Dean's gone full tilt, drilling pegs into the wall of his bedroom to display his favorite weapons, putting out the family pictures he's had folded up in his wallet for years, while Sam still seems to be treating the place like a free motel. But Dean's seen the growing collection of toiletries in Sam's corner of the shower room, so he hasn't given up hope that Sam will come around.
"Hello, Dean," he says. Dean's eyes sting.
Cas takes the keycard from Dean's back pocket, while Dean sucks in a sharp breath and leans into him. He opens the door and ushers Dean inside as quietly as he can. Sam is already asleep across the room, headphones in and mouth hanging slightly open with his breathing. Dean crashes to the bed, dead weight. Cas lifts his leg and begins to unlace one of his boots.
"Ha, ha. See you soon, kid."
Cas frowns at him. "No. I used scissors."
"I'm good to drive," Dean says, eyes fixed out the window. Aside from him and Jody and the Impala, the parking lot is empty, and the windows of the bar have gone dark. He can see the moon over the treeline, a round, yellow clockface. His time isn't anywhere close to up, not yet.
, slid it up over her arms, but every time Dean manages to get all the hooks in place he feels like he's getting strangled, and the twisting and turning only makes it worse. Eventually he sorts out that the numbers have something to do with the band size, and he needs to go for the higher numbers, but then he's got issues with the goddamn straps falling off or digging in too hard, and then the cups are all wrong and he has to start all over again.
"Uh, yeah," he says. "A few times, actually. Got in a pretty bad wreck a while ago, basically had to rebuild her, but she still runs like a dream."
"Cas?" He's whispering, his voice weaving into the white noise. "Castiel, if you're around… You can come down, man. I wanna talk to you."
"I think she's serious about it, yeah. At the very least, she likes being owed favors. But you're… I mean, you still…?"
"I know,
The clippers buzz in Dean's hand, loud against the tile.
"You idiot," Dean says, struggling to breathe normally.
Dean bends over him, trailing kisses down his sternum, over the dip of his ribcage, across his stomach as it rises and falls. He bends Cas's leg, turning his attention to his thighs, and Cas lets himself be maneuvered, craning his head down to watch Dean suck marks into his skin, blue eyes wide and amazed. Then Dean dips down to lick his way up Castiel's slit and Cas's eyelids flutter in his struggle to keep them open.
Castiel doesn't enjoy food like he did when he was human, but Dean has impressed upon him the importance of triangles when eating a sandwich in the past. Castiel had proceeded to talk about the mathematical beauty of triangles, which Dean supposed was Cas's way of appreciating Dean's culinary artistry. He's about to appreciate getting a good solid bite out of that cross-section when Jack wanders in.
you are." She taps her fingers on the side of her bottle, eyes distant. "Like, kids would call me a lesbo, and I don't think I even actually knew what that was. I'd never heard that word before. But I knew they thought it was something bad."
Dean's met angels, and they're nothing like the stories either.
, Charlie was very specific on that point. Dean probably ought to change back into his regular clothes, but there is something about watching
"Whatever I want?"
." She leans forward, her motions slow and deliberate. "If you'd have let me do it, I could have helped you find a better ensemble. But I suppose that just wasn't in the cards, aye?"
"Your
into making himself look good. And he made such a big deal about it on the phone with Bobby. "No, I— No, that's okay, you don't need to waste any grace on me."
Is that you, angel face?" Cas shifts awkwardly next to Dean, and Rowena's eyes sparkle with mirth, taking her in. "You look
"You've been gone for twelve hours," Cas says, irritation bleeding through. "I promise I'm not so incompetent I can't occupy my son and one witch for one day."
Castiel holds a lock of her hair, looking at it like it's an elusive foe. "I'm not sure." Dean rolls his eyes.
"No comments from the peanut gallery," Rowena snipes. "Now. Are you ready, dear?"
"You know exactly what shit. The shit that made you call me Samantha all the time. The shit that made you say you hate glam rock and pretend you haven't seen every episode of that Dr. Sexy show." Sam sighs, and Dean can picture his pitying expression even though he absolutely cannot look him in the eye right now. "You say all that stuff cause you think you have to, but you don't
"Yeah, and Cas pulled a Kool-Aid man and patched me up," Dean says, waving him off. "It's all good. Just, you know." Dean's knee is bouncing under the table. Cas's half-empty mug of coffee vibrates with it. "Ready to hit the hay, I guess."
Sam lets out another bitchy little huff, then closes the door again. Finally.
Engines are still rumbling to life on their way towards the action when Gwen comes through, a sour look on her face. She takes the chair across from Dean, crossing her arms on the table and setting her chin down on them. Dean frowns at her while the trucks roll through the gates, the sound fading as the distance grows.
me, and I wish everyone would stop fucking trying to. Everyone's always so careful, all the time, all this sneaking around. At least when I'm pissing you off you say what you're really thinking."
Dean reclines on the cement, working lubricant into the gears of the old motorbike. "Cas: I need to apologize to you for being a fucking dick. I'm a huge fucking dick, and I can't stop myself from being a huge fucking dick sometimes, and that's not fair to you, because you deserve a friend who's not gonna treat you like… like a huge fucking dick. I'm sorry. About me. Being a dick." Oil drips onto his nose, tickling his nostril, and he sneezes violently, ruining the shine of the paintjob. "Shit. God damn it. Stupid."
"Not completely," Charlie says, and hops down off the counter. "You've got me."
"Not now. But maybe if we help her recover, she'll be inclined to help us when she's able."
"Don't— say shit like that, are you kidding me right now," Sam says with a baffled cough of a laugh. "God. You're an adult. Act like it. Step one: Have you tried apologizing?"
"Okay. I'll go get 'em."
Thanks for the great response to the first chapter, I'm screaming into a bag about this one so I really appreciate the kind words! Also I want to put "unfathomable gender experience" on business cards.
"Yeah, definitely another time," Dean mutters, then tries to distract himself from the way his heart is racing by getting himself another mouthful of tit. So maybe he's got kind of an oral fixation, sue him.
"Mm." Cas seems unbothered, and kisses him again, groping the soft skin of his sides under his shirt once before releasing him. Dean has apparently unleashed some kind of ravenous horndog monster. But Cas does, in his benevolence, eventually let him slink away into the bathroom.
A few weeks ago, Cas sat on a dingy motel bed and told him he wanted to die. Dean hasn't even had a chance to talk to him about it since then. Cas has been cagey and hard to read, and Dean's been too chickenshit to pray, even though he spent a year in Purgatory praying to Cas nightly, even when he had nothing left to say. When he ran out of pleas for Cas's safety, for his own, for Cas to hang tight because Dean was coming for him, whatever it took, Dean just talked about nothing. He talked about TV shows he was missing out on, and he talked about stuff he was gonna do with Cas when they made it out together. He talked about late night movies, and mini-golf, and roadside barbecue stands. He talked about how worried sick he was about Sam, about how Sam was probably a wreck without Dean or Cas to look out for him. Yeah, that one was a real kick in the head.
He tries that night. Opens his phone and pulls up Claire's number. Stares at the screen for a while, trying to think of something to say that isn't completely mortifying, before he tosses the phone across the bed, where it slides off the blankets and lands on the floor with a clatter. Dean curses, scrambling over to inspect it, but the screen's not broken. Which is good, because the amount of fights he gets into, he's broken a lot of phones, and it's a real pain in the ass.
"Help me? How are you gonna help me?" Dean sits on the edge of the bed to yank his boots on, tying the laces with enough strength to hurt his feet. "You can zap me all you want, you can't fix this shit," he says, and gestures to his head, to the swirling buzz inside it.
"Later? I feel like I've already wasted so much time."
"Cas… come over here. Sit down or something."
"An hour ago. Everyone was asleep." His gaze drops, his stiff posture still somehow radiating embarrassment. "But… what you said."
"Okay, but come on, it's perfect. I get to go out without a bunch of loud-mouthed hunters acting like assholes, making me clean up after them when they end up face-down in a toilet. If I'm lucky, all the dudes at the bar see me hanging out with you, they think we're the Indigo Girls, they leave me the hell alone. I get to drink in peace, everybody wins."
"Um…" She starts, then breaks off, laughing nervously. "So, um, look, am I reading this wrong, or… If I am, that's totally okay, but."
There's a high pitched shriek and a clang as the girl inside drops her knife, which strikes the side of the bowl and sends it clattering to the floor, along with its contents. She's got a tripod set up on one of the desks, and she drops to the ground, cowering under it.
to you!"
He's startled out of his spiraling thoughts when Charlie sighs wistfully. He refocuses on the screen. Galadriel is staring into Frodo's eyes, glittering and intense. She's about to go nuclear on him, and when she does Charlie bites her lip in excitement, then mouths along when Cate Blanchett bellows,
"Are you and your son new to the community?"
. From a distance, he can rationalize it—Cas probably knows worse things about him than whatever he just saw. Cas has seen his life, all his failures and misdeeds. He's seen Dean in Hell, at his objective lowest.
you, and you can't just play fast and loose with his feelings because he looks like—"
people leave, if I act like I know it's coming, it'll hurt less later. And that's a shitty way to act. And I didn't… I didn't mean what I said. I don't think you're broken, Cas. And I get why you'd… I mean, we've gone though a lot of the same garbage, and I think I understand, but—"
right now. He swipes his hand across his face, like he can wipe the blush of embarrassment away. "I'm sorry, can we back up to the part where everything was going really good, 'cause I sound like an idiot right now."
"Jesus, Mary and—" Dean clutches his chest, willing his heart to calm. The tank he's wearing dips low enough that he feels bare skin.
Dean knows he hit home when a day later, Sam knocks on his door to lean in and sheepishly tell him, "Cas is headed up to Sioux Falls."
"Sorry, don't wanna cause a… problem?" Dean's apparently waded right into the middle of some kind of weird girl fight.
," Dean adds petulantly.
How do you know about Princess Asuka?? 👀
Dean huffs. "We spent a couple days chasing her around Ann Arbor. One dead, turned up with a little curly pig tail."
"Into a chick, yeah, hilarious move on her part. Are we good?"
If Dean had kissed him like this in the mausoleum he wouldn't have cared if Sam or Eileen or the cops or God or Death herself were watching. Dean sighs again, shoulders shaking with it, when their bodies slot against each other, "Fuck,
Dean's bubble of panic bursts. He musters up a smile. "Yeah, I'm very offended. See, my grandma was a car."
Back at the motel, Sam finally lets how stressed he is show.
"Where to, ma'am?" he drawls. Castiel doesn't laugh. Dean chews the inside of his cheek, letting Cas's eyes bore into him in silence for a minute before he asks. "You okay, Cas?"
"Jack's been asking after you," Dean says, redirecting the attention from his failures.
What do you want
"You thought about tying it back? Hell, I can cut it off. I cut Sam's until he got too cool for it and decided he wanted to look like a damn hippie."
"Need a ride? I'd be happy to take you the rest of the way."
"Oh. I don't know. I never saw him have sex with his wife. And he's dead now, so I don't think it would be polite to ask."
It's a week until Dean sees Castiel again. A week of Sam skirting around him like Dean used to skirt around their dad, a week of Jack asking him if Castiel will be back soon like Sam used to ask Dean about their dad, and a week of Dean looking at his tired, bearded face in the mirror every morning and seeing his fucking dad staring back at him. Sam took after their dad more in looks, whereas Dean always favored Mary, but it's impossible not to see the resemblance with dark circles under his eyes, sweating because he's trying to dry out even though all he wants is another drink.
