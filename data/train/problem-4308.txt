"Anna Milton," Judge Death said.
Balthazar declared, "Castiel was my best friend. We've been close all our lives. Now, I've got to live the rest of my life without him. As you can see, I haven't figured out how to do that yet." He swallowed hard. His Adam's Apple bounced up and down. "I don't care what you do with Dean Winchester. You can execute him, or you can lock him up for life. It doesn't matter to me. Whatever you decide, it won't bring my brother back. So, do whatever my brothers and sisters want. Just make sure nobody forgets Castiel. I know I never will."
Benny is touched by this, but he cannot show it. So he shrugs and mutters, "I didn't do it for you."
"Who is it?" Castiel murmured, still too unbalanced to look at his husband.
'So, why didn't he, Anna? Why didn't he defend himself when he was being attacked?'
No, Sam decided as he unfolded the page.
"Am," Dean admitted. "What does it matter? He's gone now."
Unsay them.
"It does matter!"  Dean shook his head and averted his gaze. So Sam switched tactics. "Look, Dean, I know what it's like to lose a love."
If I had
"We were hiking in the Smoky Mountains one day, Dean, Cass, me and my boyfriend, Benny. It was a crisp fall day, and we were so excited to see all the beautiful leaves. Castiel stepped a little too far out,  and the earth kind of gave out under him. We all thought he was going to fall and break his neck.
Not after all that they went through together.
"I know you didn't, but I'm grateful all the same," Castiel responds. He pauses. "I owe you everything."
Every time
Destiel is canon!! Still feels great!!
"...Benny, tell him." He hears Dean request.
From all the evils
The moment Benny feared has come. Dean has reconciled with his true love, the angel Castiel. Although Benny has expected this all along, it's still a punch in the gut for him. An irrational rage washes over him as his human dotes on the angel. Dean does not even realize how fidgety and uncomfortable Castiel is with him there. Hell, he didn't even hug him back!
Benny enjoyed those passionate nights with Dean, but he found himself feeling like he was a teenager on his first date. While they came pretty darn close, they never quite made love. Maybe it was because they'd neither of them had ever done anything like this before. Dean reminded Benny of a virgin who wanted to go all the way but was afraid of disappointing God or his parents.
Dean and Castiel go back and forth about it for a while. It's Dean's insistence that keeps the conversation going. To Benny, it is clear that Castiel does not want to put Dean at risk by tagging along. He's saying it outright, but Dean just will not have it.
It was not that Dean liked Anna so much. She was nice when she wanted to be, but she could be very cold and manipulative as well. Nor was it that she was a particularly great lover. Their tryst had been good, but not like it had been with Cassie or Lisa.
Castiel listened to Sam‚Äôs message and rubbed his swollen belly slowly. He had two months left before he was due. Hannah said she would stay with him till the baby was born just to make sure he survived. She said as politely as possible that she couldn‚Äôt be around his abomination.
Dean whistled lowly summoning his very own pet hellhound. The growls came instantly and the heavy thuds of the beasts paws made the Priest shiver the rancid smell of piss filling the air. Dean scrunched his nose in disgust. ‚ÄúMary be a good bitch and reduce him to bones and make sure he feels most of it.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat have I done?‚Äù Castiel whimpered gripping his brother tightly his breath coming out in panicked sobs.
Meg frowned at him pulling his face to look at her when Castiel shook his head in disbelief. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not angry,‚Äù Castiel spoke his voice low and distressed.
'Try not to worry. It'll be over in a minute.'
"Dear Castiel,
'I... Castiel wanted...'
Longer for
But Dean had opened up to the Priest for other reasons. Dean was determined to be reunited with Castiel in Heaven. That dream could not come true if he didn't seek forgiveness from God. His Protestant roots had shaped his belief that he could atone with God alone. But this was too important to risk. Dean had to see Castiel again. He had to earn a spot beside his soul mate in the Eternal Kingdom.
Face twisted in annoyance, Dean protested, "Aw, c'mon! Tombstone is awesome!"
Flashback to how Dean and Castiel met. üëº üíò
Dean felt Castiel shake beneath him as he unhooked his belt. It worried him that it might be too much too soon. But Cass's hands were rubbing up and down his back and chest, and the angel's lips were tickling his neck, and he could not stop. Feeling his blood coursing through him, Dean started to undo the zipper of Castiel's pants. It was all so fast. Dean never thought he would be so ready for so much so soon, and he hoped to God that Cass was, too.
As it did
"Dean, I do everything you want. I listen to your favorite music, watch your favorite movies. I've seen Tombstone a hundred times."
'I'll always be here for you if you ever need me.'
A quick smile flashed across Sam's face.
What Sam experiences directly after the verdict.
God had other plans for Sam. Not long after the tragic death of his girlfriend Jess, Sam met Ruby. Ruby had dragged herself up from the pits of Hell. She had served time in juvenile hall for a small part she'd played in a robbery. Had it not been for a friend throwing her to the wolves üê∫ in exchange for his freedom, she would not have been incarcerated. But, while locked up, she earned her diploma with honors and acceptance into college.
How could it mean anything with Anna? Even if it was the best sex of Dean's life, which Sam highly doubted, wouldn't all of the pleasure lose its worth when Castiel's broken heart came in to play? Was that not exactly what happened when he found out about Jo? Did Dean give any consideration to the consequences of his actions before he laid down with his spouse's sister?
Sure, it might take some time. Castiel would need space. Maybe he would stay with Balthazar for a while. But Dean could win him back. Yes. Dean would take Castiel out to nice restaurants and buy him sentimental gifts. They could take family trips to Dollywood and Disney. Dean would swear off women and prove how devoted he was to Castiel. Yes. He had made the right choice in dropping the gun. Dean and Castiel would be back together again in no time.
Castiel had always believed that True Love was just a myth, something corporations developed to sell candy and jewelry on Valentine's Day. But when his eyes locked on Dean's, Castiel felt his whole world flip upside down. His heart grew three sizes just like the Grinch's did when the Whos sang carols on that stolen Christmas morning. When Castiel stared at Dean, he knew that his life would never be the same again, and he could only thank God over and over and over.
Benny's feelings for Dean had sneaked up on him out of nowhere. In both of his lives, Benny had only ever been with women. He'd been married and had children before his maker turned him.
Castiel tried to calm his heart, which was racing in his chest. Dean had looked at him that way before, and nothing had come of it.. There was a chance that history would repeat itself. More than a chance. If Dean did love Castiel, he would not act on it.
I dreamed of being a writer since I was a little girl but I would never have imagined I'd ever get 900 hits. Thank you all so much!!
'6" I'd say.'
Dean had cried out, and Castiel had taken vigil over his bedside. Cass was like an honest to God angel, saving him from Alastair and making him feel safe in the place he despised more than anything else. It didn't even faze Dean to hold Castiel's hand. It didn't make him feel less macho at all because he could sense that Castiel would never judge him.
'Everything's gonna be alright, you know. There's nothing to be scared of.'
When Sam was growing up, John Winchester never tired of pleading with Sam to be more like Dean. It seemed like he thought he could change his son by nagging him every chance he got. No matter what he did, Sam could never be as obedient as Dean, as loyal, as unquestioningly devoted. It was difficult to bear it. Hell, Sam had left home as soon as he could to escape the constant disappointment he caused his father.
But he was still shivering like crazy, even with Benny's coat covering him. Benny had never tried to hold Dean when he was conscious. He was not sure how the hunter would react. Hugging a vampire wasn't the safest pastime in the world, and Dean didn't seem like the most touchy-feely person as it was. But he couldn't stand watching his friend suffer.
Dean gasped, and Sam jumped out of his seat to check on him. Blood gushed from a big gash on his palm. Sam pressed a white dish towel onto the wound. It stung something awful, and Dean groaned.
Dean's heart wrenching cries awoke Sam with a start. Sam stumbled out of bed and raced to his brother's bedside, crashing into the door along the way. His brother was yelling and thrashing about in his bed. Sweat rolled down his face and collected on his chest.
Castiel was kind like Mary. Strong like John. Smart like Sam. Protective like Bobby. Devoted like Dean. Yet he was silly and provided Dean's life with some much humor. And, despite all of the horror they'd witnessed, Castiel maintained an innocence that Dean would defend to the end.
During the song, Roger tried to stop Mimi from relapsing on Heroin. The sight of the needle triggered Dean again. He fidgeted in his seat and closed his eyes. It was more than Castiel could bear.
"No, abandoning him in Purgatory with only a vampire as a friend wouldn't hurt him at all."
But Benny is still angry. He's angry that he's lost his boyfriend, if he ever truly had Dean. He's angry there is yet another contingency to their plan. He's angry he allowed himself to like Dean any more than just a friend.
'I know it sucks, but you need it to get better.'
At last, Dean snaps, "'Cass, we're gonna shove your ass back through the eye of that needle even if it kills all three of us.'"
"Are you gonna open it or just stare at it like it's a toy in a store window you can't have?" Ruby asked.
But Dean did not want to sleep. His heart was too heavy with sorrow and emptiness. His mind was spinning, trying to dissect his conversation with Death Billie.
Out of the blue, Castiel calls out, "Vampire?"
He was not
But Benny can see his true form. Castiel is magnificent. He is huge, powerful and strong. His eyes are a bright, pure blue, as if made from the heavens themselves. Benny can't help but feel a twinge of gratitude that Dean is incapable of beholding the real Castiel.
Sam tries to help Dean in his grief, and he makes Dean face the possibility that Destiel is real.
Benny is going to hold up his end of the oath the best way he knows how. By decimating Leviathans, of course, but his most important task is to remain a loyal friend to Dean. If the angel does fly away, Benny will ensure Dean's safe exit from Purgatory and his healing back on earth.
Sam asked if Dean was okay, but Dean could not speak. His lungs had shriveled up like raisins, and he could not catch his breath. When he felt Sam's hand on his shoulder, Dean realized that he had to calm himself down somehow.
"Maybe we were wrong," Castiel whispered.
'I promise I won't.'
"Thank you, Ruby. I've gotta go."
"This is about Dad?" Sam felt the anger and the grief boiling up inside of him. "Dad's been dead for ten years, and we are still having this same fight! Are you kidding me, Dean?" Sam was aware of the wounded look in Dean's eyes, but he could not stop. The anger wouldn't let him. "Maybe Dad wouldn't have been thrilled that his son fell in love with a male angel. But he wouldn't have cared all that much. All that really mattered to Dad was that you're safe and maybe even happy."
Dean and Castiel get all goo-goo eyed again. Maybe Castiel whispers his name with such softness that only a being like Benny can hear it. It doesn't make a difference. They are so lost in each other that they couldn't find their way back with a map and directions.
The door as
Husband. Of course, Castiel knew why Dean had said that. The staff would not let them stay together otherwise. Still, the word husband sounded almost as delectable as the name Dean. Like love, marriage had been very abstract and unattainable before. Now, the music of Dean calling him his husband was a drug that Castiel had become addicted to, and he liked this disease.
So, he pinched himself. It was his best way of figuring out when he had been dreaming: then or now. It had to be now. He fully anticipated not feeling when he tugged at his skin. His fingernails dug into his arm, and, sure enough, it hurt.
Vitriol.
The angel nodded, and Sam commented, "I don't know what to say."
Be struck still
Forever eager to please Dean, Cass skimmed the rack for another film. He selected a DVD. It was an old black and white movie about American GIs in World War II. Dean smiled. As always, Cass knew just what Dean would like.
"'Open your door. I'll be your tenant. Don't got much baggage to lay at your feet. But sweet kisses I've got to spare. I'll be there and I'll cover you. I think they meant it when they said you can't buy love. Now I know you can rent it. A new lease you are my love one life. All my life, I've longed to discover something as true as this is. So with a thousand sweet kisses, if you're cold and you're lonely, with a thousand sweet kisses, if you've got one nickel only, with a thousand sweet kisses, when you're worn out and tired, with a thousand sweet kisses, when your heart has expired. Oh, Lover, I'll Cover You.'"
Castiel hates gym. Don‚Äôt get it wrong, he‚Äôs good at sports, like really good, but he hates gym. He especially hates his attractive gym teacher who has no right to be that damn attractive. Dean Winchester. The teacher every girl swoons over, the teacher every boy tries not to check out every time he walks by in those stupid tight red shorts. Castiel would bet his entire fortune that every person who has ever been in that man‚Äôs gym class has had at least one wet dream about him and those fucking tight red shorts.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre home.‚Äù A voice spoke low and full of surprise, and Castiel quickly stood to his feet and whirled on the alpha behind him snarling. Chuck tilted his head slightly a small sign of submission but not complete surrender. ‚ÄúCome now, Castiel. I don‚Äôt want to fight. I‚Äôm done with the fighting.‚Äù Chuck stared at him with sad blue eyes, lines covering his face, thick stubble left unattended to grow on once smooth skin, and his curly hair a mess on his head. His shoulders seemed to slump in on themselves.
Castiel hummed happily, ‚ÄúYou. I just want you Dean.‚Äù
Dean laughed in shock ignoring the angel‚Äôs first words in favor for the end, ‚ÄúCas, I‚Äôm shocked, who taught you that kind of language?‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, you poor girl. He really did a number on you.‚Äù A woman with a distant accent crooned and squatted before Lilith her fiery red hair catching Lilith‚Äôs attention.
Hey guys, so I have written, and re-written this chapter a dozen times trying to get the tone I want to set just right and I'm still unsure if it's exactly how I want it. But, this has been my favorite version so far and I wanted to update this fic badly for you guys.  Just a fair warning Castiel's wolf does say some verbally abusive things toward Castiel at the end of the chapter. Also, there is some NSFW content in this chapter. As always I love hearing from you if you have any thoughts or questions I'd love to hear what you guys think!
Castiel glared up at Dean and he smirked back down at him.
‚ÄúEasy, alpha. I‚Äôve got you. I‚Äôve got you.‚Äù A low baritone rang in his ear and Castiel‚Äôs eyes fluttered shut his senses being overloaded with this man‚Äôs scent unknown and wholly encompassing. It was all that mattered all that he desired.
The old Priest spat spit at him, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt live past tonight Demon I know your kind. Kill me now I won‚Äôt tell you where Castiel is. He‚Äôs safe from the likes of you.‚Äù
Dean took two steps forward, and the man took two quick steps back. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need for violence, Dean. We‚Äôre all very much aware of whose rack you were on for years, and none of us would like to be on your rack. All sarcasm aside I don‚Äôt know where Crowley is.‚Äù
Dean grinned happily. ‚ÄúSee was that so hard my pretty little lamb.‚Äù the demon moved inside Castiel with an unrelenting pace quickly hitting his prostate every time causing pretty little moans and curses to come tumbling out of Castiel's mouth.
Chuck stared at Castiel hard as if trying to decide what they should do next. ‚ÄúAre you sure this is what you want?‚Äù
‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have done that,‚Äù Sam spoke the accusation slurred into those words. Sam didn‚Äôt miss anything, the emotions he felt sometimes spoke louder than the thoughts Dean could hear. He‚Äôd felt Dean‚Äôs pain at seeing a mate that recoiled from him, but he could feel Castiel‚Äôs confusion, and Meg‚Äôs grief as if it was his own. He had to filter through so many emotions that sometimes he couldn‚Äôt help but defend the feelings he felt.
‚ÄúFuck off,‚Äù Castiel muttered to himself his wolf chuckled in delight as the alpha across the bar finally stood up and walked over to him his large frame lumbering as he moved.
‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have been able to get in. How did you even find me?‚Äù Castiel hissed his hand inching under his pillow for the demon knife he had hidden under there a gift from, Hannah. He was trying not to let the panic show in his face as he stared back at Dean.
Castiel looked up slowly Sam looking down at him in shock. ‚ÄúCas? Where‚Äôs Dean?‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just that. He‚Äôs seen the night you scratched Meg‚Äôs face. He‚Äôs seen your encounters with Lilith, he watched as you were lost to your own mind in the angel war and saw you with Chuck last night as you decided to turn yourself in with the end goal to kill yourself. How would he know any of this?‚Äù She spoke in quick succession and Castiel‚Äôs hand just kept tightening. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs lying Castiel. Kill her. Kill her! She doesn‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs talking about.‚Äù
Sam rolled his eyes and moved up to the front of the class to demonstrate the next pose. Dean winked at Castiel and went towards the back of the room. ‚ÄúStay after class, Cas, there‚Äôs something I want to talk to you about.‚Äù He said to Castiel as he passed him.
‚ÄúNext time, Cas, I suggest you look where you‚Äôre going.‚Äù
Hannah shook her head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he knows exactly where you are otherwise he‚Äôd already be here, but somehow he‚Äôs closing in and quickly. I want to move you both here soon to a different location. I was hoping to do that next week if that‚Äôs alright with you.‚Äù
Dean turned to Castiel looking him over his eyes filling with guilt and anger. ‚ÄúGoddamnit.‚Äù He hissed running a hand through his hair then he looked back at Castiel with bright green eyes filled with helplessness. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I just, I knew she wouldn‚Äôt leave, and she‚Äôs‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs done enough.‚Äù He muttered walking over to where Castiel collapsed and sat a crossed from him. Castiel felt numb, his limbs heavy, and a cold sweat broke out over his skin. And as he gazed into those beautiful green eyes his stomach rolled in disgust. How could someone so beautiful be so monstrous? Dean sucked in a sharp breath his eyes falling away from his own to his hands clenching into fists.
‚ÄúStop it.‚Äù Dean hissed and the images began to recede as did his wolf, but the damage had been done as Castiel grasped his head shuddering violently. He couldn‚Äôt escape his own mind. He would never escape this. Death would be better than this, surely. Dean lurched forward and grasped Castiel‚Äôs hands squeezing them tightly. ‚ÄúLook at me. We‚Äôre all monsters, Castiel. There is not a day that goes by that I don‚Äôt think about what a monster I am. What I can do violates every personal boundary a person has and believe when I say I‚Äôve held a gun to my head and almost pulled the trigger. If I didn‚Äôt know the havoc it‚Äôd cause on my family, I would have done it already. I hear how much my family loves me, and I can tell when someone hates me,‚Äù he paused licking his lips his eyes hurting, ‚Äúbut being a monster doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt continue to live. Being a monster doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt change, Cas.‚Äù Castiel wasn‚Äôt sure if it was the words that breached the cloud in his mind, or the soothing smell, or maybe those damn green eyes with all their sincerity. ‚ÄúYou can change,‚Äù Dean grunted his green eyes fierce.
Dean focused on the words being said in Latin, ‚Äú
Dean chuckled. ‚ÄúYour wish is my command.‚Äù
Dean turned his head to look at him water dripping down his face a dangerous look in his eyes. Sam‚Äôs eyes opened wide when suddenly Dean looked alarmed groaning loudly his nostrils flaring as he shook his head the darker demonic tone bleeding back into his voice as he fought something going on inside him. Dean bared his teeth at Sam but his eyes were afraid.
Castiel stilled at Dean‚Äôs old nickname for him. Castiel couldn‚Äôt help the tears that rose to his eyes of all the times Dean had whispered the word into his ear like a pray when they‚Äôd made love. Castiel stood abruptly from the chair not even caring that tears were falling from his eyes as he said, ‚ÄúFuck you, Dean Winchester.‚Äù
‚ÄúDammit, Cas just let me comfort you. I didn‚Äôt mean what I said.‚Äù Dean hissed in his ear.
Castiel nodded quickly already to far gone to care what he was about to do. ‚ÄúI give myself to you, Dean Winchester for all eternity.‚Äù
Castiel felt his cheeks heat up in embarrassment, and he hissed, ‚ÄúLube and a condom? Are you fucking serious right now, Gabriel?‚Äù
Sam took a couple steps forward pointing his finger. ‚ÄúNo, no you don‚Äôt. You don‚Äôt get to quit. We don‚Äôt get to quit in this family. This family is all we have ever had.‚Äù
Sam nodded. ‚ÄúI convinced Dean it was something you all should learn, and he got the permission for me to teach you guys every Friday.‚Äù
Castiel shook his head hard as he listened to the message. He even called Sam back but the human didn‚Äôt answer. Castiel sank to his knees caressing his stomach. Dean would think his child was an abomination just like everyone else. The greatest sin in eternity. He should never know.
Dean sighed his gaze becoming cloudy. ‚ÄúIf I was human‚Ä¶ would it be easier?‚Äù
Even without his powers, though, he was feeling stronger by the minute as he thought about all of his training. He had been the best fighter in his Garrison. He wasn't anything without his powers because he was still a trained soldier. Castiel could feel the blanket of that mindset washing over him. He didn‚Äôt need to be a parent right now, he needed to be the soldier he was. Castiel walked from the bathroom for the first time since before his son was born with his head held high and his back straight. He‚Äôd lost sight of what he had been. Over the years fighting for the Winchesters he‚Äôd lost sight of how powerful he was. Thoughts of being a failure, weak, unworthy had plagued his thoughts and dreams. No more. Castiel was strong, he always had been, and he was going to get his son back.
The omega said curtly his eyes never leaving Castiel‚Äôs a hard glint of agitation in them.
‚ÄúI never said those exact words about her. I made her mine, called her mate, but I never told you she was our mate. He is‚Ä¶ Castiel just look around,‚Äù and Castiel was looking around and all it brought to his mind and heart was panic and resentment of this being who was having visions of him for years and never tried to find him.
Castiel shook his head. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know him like I do. If demon Dean finds out he won‚Äôt care. He might find me out of curiosity and would have no problem killing me and our child. He‚Äôs not capable of caring Hannah.‚Äù
Meg frowned running a hand through her hair. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to the Winchester clan?‚Äù
Dean‚Äôs hands cupped Castiel‚Äôs face, kissing him gently at first, then deepening the kiss when Castiel began to respond. He kissed back much dirtier than Dean had expected. Dean wrapped his arm around the younger male‚Äôs waist, pulling him tightly against him while his other hand wrapped into Castiel‚Äôs dark hair.
His wolf moved into his line of vision Castiel‚Äôs eyes tracking him till the phantom stood in front of the omega his hand caressing that beautiful face. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù The wolf whispered and the omega‚Äôs eyes fell closed as if he could feel the phantom hand his lip jutting out into a small pout.
‚ÄúWhere do I take my sister?‚Äù He replied, and the alpha grunted letting them into the beautiful home and led them back into the left wing of the house into a medical bay where a man with a scruffy beard and an old battered hat stood looking over an ancient tome written in elvish. He glanced up at their approach and introduced himself as Robert Singer. Castiel nodded at the introduction and moved to set his sister down gently on the bed.
Meg shook her head anger tinging her words. ‚ÄúNo, no I found him beaten to all hell. I had to take him to a fucking hospital. He had internal bleeding. You helped me take him!‚Äù Meg accused a long clawed finger pointed and Gabriel who looked at her helplessly like she was a pig-headed alpha who wouldn‚Äôt see reason.
Gabriel shook his head, popping the lollipop back into his mouth as he slung his arm around Castiel‚Äôs shoulders. ‚ÄúNu-uh, you have to wait for the awesomeness that is Sam Winchester, who‚Äôs probably the most bendy person I know, besides you.‚Äù
‚ÄúLeave me alone,‚Äù Castiel growled his inner hackles raised as the man‚Äôs putrid and rotted scent rose to his nose. His wolf hissed in his ear low and mean. ‚Äú
Hannah nodded. ‚ÄúFor what‚Äôs worth Castiel I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù
‚ÄúCas!‚Äù Meg called but Castiel couldn‚Äôt hear her following after him watching his body from a different angle as anger seethed through him. His wolf followed the omega out into the forest past all the packmates that gather to watch them and through buildings and trees.
Every time he cursed Dean hips would stutter, and he would moan loudly all the while muttering to Castiel. ‚ÄúSay it louder, babe let me hear you scream it.‚Äù
This chapter deals with themes of suicide, and violence. Please, please do not read this if things like that bother you. No one commits the act, however, it is thought about so if this triggers you, please skip this chapter. I am putting a summary of this chapter at the endnotes of this chapter if you'd like to continue the story, but not read this chapter.
‚ÄúI feel better, Cas. These people are going to help me‚Ä¶ and you.‚Äù She added hurt lingering in those eyes. Ah, so she‚Äôd been told. She now knew his promise to her yesterday had been bull shit and now he had chipped away at her trust.
Castiel met those green eyes that held his so passionately and nodded. ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou killed every single demon I sent after you, so tell me, Dean, do you have any feelings for the child?‚Äù
‚ÄúSince he stopped looking crazy.‚Äù Castiel murmured disturbed by the cool look his wolf gave him a level of calm Castiel‚Äôs never seen him achieve. There was always a tick, an angry look, his eyes glowing with glee for the next kill, but none of that was here now. He was determined, and calm awaiting something.
Dean stopped twirling the knife at his mother‚Äôs name. ‚ÄúHow sweet.‚Äù He spit.
‚ÄúIn fact, your, uh, guilt ridden, weight of the world bro has been M.I.A for quite some time now. But I‚Äôm loving the new model. Lean, mean Dean.‚Äù Dean said confidently.
She smiled weakly. ‚ÄúThank you for coming, Castiel. It‚Äôs really good to see you.‚Äù Castiel smiled softly pecking her forehead with a soft kiss then made his way back downstairs his legs feeling heavy with guilt.
‚ÄúYou a rogue ain‚Äôt ya? You smell wrong, misplaced, feral. We don‚Äôt accept your kind around here.‚Äù The alpha growled puffing up his chest his pot belly sticking out like a pig waiting to be gutted.
Dean added another finger stretching Castiel wider. He loved the way Castiel squirmed with discomfort and he loved the way all that changed when he hit his prostate with every stroke of his fingers.
The man chuckled. ‚ÄúOh, did you and Crowley have a falling out?‚Äù
‚ÄúGabriel. I named him Gabriel Mary Winchester.‚Äù Castiel whispered.
‚ÄúDo it, Dean.‚Äù Castiel hissed. Dean shrugged and held the cup to Phoebus's throat. Castiel slit his throat quickly and listened as the demon's essence hissed and dissipated as the blood lurched forward and into the cup. When the cup was full Castiel dropped the body to the floor. He met Dean‚Äôs gaze easily challenging him to say something.
‚ÄúSoon angel you have to give me time to prep you.‚Äù Castiel let out a noise of annoyance, but other wise nodded lying back into the bed watching as Dean stuck one lubed up finger inside his hole.
Dean turned away from Sam touching his chest lightly at the small pure light that he could feel move inside of him, ‚ÄúBecause no one else would have held my interest long enough. Go tend to your Priest. I have a little lamb I need to collect.‚Äù
Dean reacted immediately, removing his hands from around Castiel‚Äôs neck, and threw punch after punch into Castiel‚Äôs face keeping up a brutal pace into him. ‚ÄúHow dare you fucking say her name! You don‚Äôt have the right to say her name!‚Äù
, and no longer Gods.
‚ÄúThere is a fucking reason I haven‚Äôt sought him out, Sam. He‚Äôs been manipulated by witches one too many times in his life and mate or not he won‚Äôt give a damn when he finds out that I can hear every thought he has and see any memory I want. Now-.‚Äù He cut off suddenly as the two packmates entered the room green eyes meeting his own. Castiel stopped dead in his tracks. He knew those eyes. He‚Äôs seen them in dreams staring at him in the dark before disappearing into nothing. ‚ÄòMate or not he won‚Äôt give a damn when he finds out that I can hear every thought he has and see any memory I want.‚Äô
Shivering with emotion, and with tears flowing with freedom down his face, Castiel replied, "I can't be with you knowing that you're sleeping with somebody else. We're over, Dean. I'm sorry."
Benny caught a whiff of Dean's blood as it pulsed within the major artery in his neck. His mouth salivated. His nostrils twitched. It had been years since he'd tasted human blood, and the thirst burned like a case of strep throat that no antibiotic could ever cure. Every one of Benny's natural instincts told him to attack. Dean smelled delicious, like his blood was made of bacon cheeseburgers.
"I do love you, but enough is enough."
Although Jack had always sought Dean's love and acceptance, in all honesty, Dean had never cared for Jack as much as Cass had. He'd justified it as Jack and Castiel being blood relatives. He and the boy did not share that same connection. But that wasn't the whole truth. Dean thought that there was an inherent evil in Jack because of how awful his biological father was. He believed that Jack manipulated Cass. Yes, that was so.
She sniffled. 'He loved Dean too much to hurt him.'
At some point, Sam returned. He was speaking, but Dean could not make out any of his words. The next thing he knew, Sam was pulling him to his feet. Dean's legs were unsteady, but he didn't want to ask his brother for help. Sam scooped Castiel up and cradled him close to his body. In a most irrational way, Dean hated how Sammy was holding Cass, but he could never articulate that feeling.
Dean pursed his lips in amusement. ‚ÄúWell, the ex-angel has some bite left. I‚Äôd thought it‚Äôd all disappeared.‚Äù Castiel continued to glare at Dean the demon huffing in annoyance. ‚ÄúFine. I know where several of Crowley‚Äôs hideouts are. Instead of checking each and every one of them I figured I would go after one of Crowley‚Äôs right-hand men and find out which one he‚Äôs currently inhabiting. Does that sound good to you angel face?‚Äù
‚ÄúWill you let him tell Dean?‚Äù Hannah asked from the couch reading one of the many books she‚Äôs gotten into.
Dean chuckled again and dug his nails into one of the cuts on Castiel‚Äôs face. Castiel hissed turning his head away from the demon above him, tears streaming down his face. ‚ÄúCome on Cas, don‚Äôt you have something to say to me?‚Äù
‚Äù His other half hissed his back to the alpha looking at the house too. Castiel wondered idly if the wolf remembered the horrors of this house that split them apart, to begin with, and if that was why he too just stared at it waring with his own emotions.
‚ÄúYour son‚Ä¶ can he read everyone‚Äôs mind as easily as he can read mine?‚Äù His voice wavered in the panic settling in again. Rowena had played games with his mind, and so had Lilith and the mere thought of someone else rummaging around in his mind was‚Ä¶ terrifying.
Dean leaned down and kissed Castiel passionately, while speeding up his thrusts inside of him, matching that pace with his stokes down Castiel‚Äôs cock. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you cum if you repeat exactly what I say, Castiel and only if you repeat
Dean took another step closer, their bodies only a few inches apart. ‚ÄúLet me rephrase the question, do you not like my attention?‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, he is, I‚Äôve seen him. He‚Äôs got the body of a God.‚Äù Castiel froze at the sound of his brother‚Äôs voice from behind him. Castiel turned to look at his brother, who was not surprisingly, sucking on a lollipop.
‚ÄúNo. No. No. No. No. No. It‚Äôs a lie this isn‚Äôt real this isn‚Äôt real!‚Äù Castiel roared struggling in the omega‚Äôs grasp. Mary rushed forward pressing her palm to his forehead his gaze growing fuzzy darkness overcoming it.
Dean smirked, ‚ÄúWell I would never.‚Äù
Castiel sighed heavily and Sam could almost physically feel Castiel‚Äôs sadness. ‚ÄúYes. I thought it was fitting, just like I thought Mary was a fitting middle name.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat were you thinking of leaving me behind? They said you were going to kill yourself.‚Äù Tears leaked down her face Castiel rubbed his face but stood there in shock as he realized he didn‚Äôt feel angry, his wolf didn‚Äôt try and react, and when Castiel glanced at his phantom self he was staring off where the other man had disappeared his face guilty and suppressed.
‚ÄúGod damn it Castiel I have worked to damn hard to keep you alive to want to throw your life away. You will get treatment, and when the doctor deems you to be safe to be around other people, we are going to hit the road like we always have, and we will live our lives together till we‚Äôre old, do you understand?‚Äù She roared at him her gaze petrifying.
When Dean bottomed out, he groaned against Castiel‚Äôs back, thrusting shallowly a couple of times, as if to test it out. ‚ÄúYou ready, Cas?‚Äù
At the sound of his father‚Äôs name Gabriel stopped crying loudly just small sniffles coming from him. Dean sighed patting the one year old on the back carefully. Dean didn‚Äôt really understand why he was doing this or why it meant so much to him. Before Sam had injected him with human blood he really hadn‚Äôt felt anything at all. There would be hints of emotion here and there but nothing that resembled what he used to feel. Dean loved being care free, not a worry in the world because he didn‚Äôt have enough emotions in his body to care. Now, things were a bit different.
Dean grinned. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a surprise of sorts, head to the weight room.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe night you saved me from Lilith, how did you know where I was? How did you save me?‚Äù Castiel questioned his gaze firm as she crossed her arms her face weary.
Sam returned to the room only to find Dean passed out his head hanging and looking as if he were dead. Sam rushed forward slapping Dean‚Äôs face and holding it. ‚ÄúHey! Hey! Dean! Come on! Come back.‚Äù
Meg stared blankly at Chuck before glancing at Gabriel who sighed and nodded in acknowledgment. ‚ÄúHe looked so angry laying there like the wheels were turning in his head for what to do. Chuck had his back turned and you could see something click on his face like he‚Äôd been made an offer and snatched it up. His eyes turned red and he lunged at Chuck. Took a good chunk out of his shoulder and scratched the shit out of his back, but even with his wolf‚Äôs power it wasn‚Äôt enough.‚Äù Gabriel spoke his voice low with regret, but his eyes held true.
Hannah shook her head fixing her gaze back on him. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs getting closer.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not my brother, I‚Äôd rather not have all their eyes on me.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou did very well Castiel; you‚Äôre a natural,‚Äù Gabriel coughed. ‚Äúand you as well Gabriel.‚Äù
Dean sneered, ‚ÄúCoward.‚Äù
The demon chuckled delight shining in his beautiful features. How could something so beautiful, be so evil? The demons hair was a dirty blond glinting in the small amount of moon light admitting from the one tiny window. His sun kissed skin lightly freckled, his lips slightly chapped, his face seemingly chiseled from stone.
.‚Äù Castiel hissed shoving the alpha aside taking control of his body once more. He felt wrong as he kicked his bike into gear and took off after Meg, he always felt like his body wasn‚Äôt his own after his wolf took over, and it angered him even more. He was never comfortable in his own skin, and he always felt rage brewing under his skin in boiling waves over it. Wrong, unworthy,
He wrapped his finger around Castiel‚Äôs cock stroking gently spreading pre cum down his shaft while pleasuring him. A wicked thought came to Dean then. If he could get this human to pledge himself to him then it would forsake his now weak connection to God, and he would eternally become Dean‚Äôs. Dean grinned, he wasn't sure why but he just had to have this Priest for the rest of his wicked life.
Sam smirked slightly but nodded and waited for him to connect the dots, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the teenager who took care of me isn‚Äôt he?‚Äù
‚ÄúDo you think I‚Äôm giving him too much attention, Michael? Perhaps you want all of my attention on you, hmm? Well, I wasn‚Äôt going to say anything, because, well, quite frankly your pose is completely wrong. Here, I‚Äôll help you fix it.‚Äù
Castiel didn‚Äôt expect to see Dean flinch at his words, but the demon covered the show of emotion quickly grabbing Castiel‚Äôs shoulder and teleporting them to a different location in a blink of an eye. Castiel pulled out of Dean‚Äôs reach the moment everything settled. Dean shrugged and moved forward into an apartment not bothering to check if Castiel followed behind him.
Gabriel waggled his eyebrows. ‚ÄòMaybe he wants some?‚Äô
‚ÄúBack off please.‚Äù Castiel bit out breathing a sigh of relief as the omega stepped away from him standing to his full height and looking down on the alpha with a mixed expression like he didn‚Äôt know what to think of this alpha before him.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll cum when I tell you to because I know your pretty little cock can cum all on its own.‚Äù Dean's grin was wicked as he focused on hitting Castiel prostate with every thrust.
Dean dipped his hand in Holy Oil and they both watched as it slid down his hand covering his entire arm in its slick. Dean smiled and leaned down to kiss Castiel while he slowly circled Castiel‚Äôs rim with his slicked up fingers.
‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù Meg asked and Castiel watched as Dean‚Äôs eyes flashed a brighter green and suddenly Meg‚Äôs shoulders dropped, and she walked out of the room without another word. The glimmer in Dean‚Äôs eyes dissipated as he slammed the door shut and shuddered running a hand through his hair angrily. Castiel stared at him in a slow-burning horror his stomach twisting in knots. The look on Meg‚Äôs face had been no different from his father‚Äôs
‚ÄúWeak, when do we take her?‚Äù Castiel rumbled lowly settling into one of the comfy chairs his posture stiff and uncomfortable. He knew this house with startling clarity, but it felt like a shoe that no longer fit. Tight and unforgiving like it never belonged to him in the first place.
‚ÄúI want you to know, Castiel,‚Äù Castiel snapped his eyes up to those green orbs hearing his name on those lips struck a chord in him, made this omega real to him for a reason he couldn‚Äôt explain. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tied to you, to your mind and your soul. I couldn‚Äôt ignore your thoughts even if I wanted to and I won‚Äôt hide what I am from you either. I can hear every thought, they bleed into my dreams, and I can feel your emotions.‚Äù Their faces were mere inches apart and Dean‚Äôs scent went over in him in waves both calming and stirring. He smelt divine, and Castiel shuddered as a sudden wave of arousal coursed through him.
Dean snorted behind them as he walked up to the door. ‚ÄúGabe, I‚Äôm going to pretend I didn‚Äôt hear that.‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have him anymore. Crowley took him when I wasn‚Äôt paying attention. I‚Äôm here for both of your help on getting him back.‚Äù
Dean sat back thinking back to a time when his eyes didn‚Äôt flash back, and he hunted what his brother and him have been for ten years. He vaguely remembers staying with a family that took them in for the night when Sam got hurt badly. There was a 15 year old boy named Gabriel who took care of Sam while Dean took care of the local werewolf problem.
Castiel scowled after his brother as he caught up to the younger Winchester who shut the door firmly behind them. Dean cleared his throat. ‚ÄúSo, what did you think about what Michael said today? Do you think I‚Äôm giving you too much attention?‚Äù
Castiel walked into the woods through the night, his backpack on his shoulder containing his few belongings. Like he was leaving, and his heart hammered with every step away from Dean. Fear crawled across his skin painfully splitting every nerve and putting him on edge. He repeated the plan over and over in his mind.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a boy. A very healthy one at that. I think it used up every last bit of grace you had to keep itself healthy the little parasite.‚Äù Castiel flinched at the word but continued staring at the screaming bundle. It‚Äôs hair was a light blond and it‚Äôs eyes blue for now.
Doesn‚Äôt sound so bad right? Hot gym teacher, something nice to stare at all class period, at least it‚Äôs better than the creepy old dude who teaches the other gym class. Well for Castiel, he‚Äôd much rather have the creepy old dude, who he‚Äôs sure would molest him if he had the chance. For whatever reason, Dean decided to make Castiel a sort of star of the class. Dean was picking him for demonstrations, always giving him those dazzling smiles, and giving him candy for best effort at the end of class almost everyday.
Did he want to share anything? Was there anything this stranger didn‚Äôt already know? Dean gave no indication to have heard his thoughts, those green eyes just bored into him waiting for whatever answer he‚Äôd give. ‚ÄúI like cheeseburgers,‚Äù Castiel said his voice rough and weary when suddenly the omega threw his head back and laughed long and hard. Castiel didn‚Äôt know what was so funny.
‚ÄúNow, now, angel, keep still. The more you struggle the more it hurts, or so I hear.‚Äù Dean used the blade to rip all of the angel‚Äôs clothes off, looking over Castiel‚Äôs exposed body. Dean was slightly surprised to find himself getting hard at the sight of Castiel naked before him, but he got off on a lot of new things these days. Getting hard from a naked angel wasn‚Äôt the worst thing he could possibly add to the list.
His thoughts flickered to Lilith and he could clearly see those crystal clear blue eyes that sparkled with secrets that pulled him in like a moth to an open flame ensnaring him in their light till it was too late. He could still feel the scars left in his wolf‚Äôs presence from her hooks that had been filled with rust and poisoned his mind but wouldn‚Äôt bend and break. Meg had warned him, but he hadn‚Äôt listened too caught up in the feel of her, the smell of her, the way her voice rasped in his ear the promise of a mate and salvation only for her to take it all from him. Only to watch her tear him apart from the inside. She‚Äôd be a mistake he‚Äôd never be able to make up for because the scars went to deep.
‚ÄúYeah, I get, you don‚Äôt like me, that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going to let you bleed out through your nose. That‚Äôs a dumb way to die.‚Äù He muttered squatting down in front of Castiel his green eyes concerned and weary.
‚ÄúDoes he know I‚Äôm here?‚Äù It was a dumb question Castiel knew that his father had allowed him into the territory of course he knew.
‚ÄúIf you find an airport, I‚Äôll pay for everything,‚Äù Gabriel said his voice hopeful.
‚ÄúAre you ready?‚Äù She asked her voice soft.
Castiel nodded quickly. ‚ÄúSlowly, please. This is very hard for me, Dean.‚Äù
Sam sighed looking out at the road as he drove. Castiel had called him in a hysteria and all that Sam really caught was Dean took my son and Castiel‚Äôs address. Sam hadn‚Äôt even thought twice as he drove down to pick Castiel up.
‚ÄúLilith the crazy psycho bitch bad, or what
Finally, she broke her expression turning hard. ‚ÄúThe night you turned rogue, what happened, Castiel?‚Äù
Dean then grabbed his shampoo and conditioner and sat down in front of Castiel in rubbing both into his scalp and smiling softly at the way Castiel mouth was hanging slightly open and his eyes heavily lidded. Once Dean was sure he cleaned Castiel thoroughly he washed himself up quickly eager to get Castiel out of the heavily steamed room and into their bed so he could rest.
‚ÄúYeah, I pretty much figured that out.‚Äù Sam spoke his voice almost defeated.
Dean grinned. ‚ÄúIn the flesh.‚Äù
‚ÄúOkay, okay. There is a golden cup in my bedroom. If you fill it with human blood it brings you into direct contact with Crowley‚Äôs cup. Please, that‚Äôs all I know.‚Äù The demon spat his voice quivering.
Sam sat forward angry and confused. ‚ÄúAnd what exactly is that supposed to mean?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat are you saying?‚Äù Castiel whispered shaking in the demon's hold.
Dean snorted and wrapped his hand around Castiel‚Äôs neck squeezing tightly while angling his hips just right to pull grunts of pleasure from the angel. ‚ÄúWhen are you going to learn angel? Human‚Äôs are corrupt. They don‚Äôt give a shit about anything other than themselves.‚Äù
Almost simultaneously, Sam and Castiel said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll what?‚Äù
Sam had done it. He had Dean in the dungeon and he was going to cure him. He walked in calmly the bags of blood in the cooler his brother gaze following every step. ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù Dean drawled his gaze on the cooler as he set it down.
Castiel bristled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not helpless, Dean.‚Äù
Gabriel grinned, pushing Castiel forward.
Sam sighed walked forward meeting Dean‚Äôs gaze. ‚ÄúBuckle up.‚Äù
Uriel snorted behind the two of them. ‚ÄúWho doesn‚Äôt want his attention?‚Äù
Sam turned and dropped the needle onto the table. ‚ÄúOr, you‚Äôre just messing with me. Either way, the lore doesn‚Äôt say anything about exceptions to the cure.‚Äù
I'm sorry for the short and late chapter. I had written out a good chunk of the third chapter when I'd left my computer alone for a while and it died and I lost all of my progress. I hope you guys enjoy.
Dean turned the shower nob on checking the water every few seconds. Dean was glad when he decided to have the place built that he made the shower big enough to fit ten people easy with shower heads shooting water down in almost every direction. Dean sat Castiel‚Äôs naked body down on the small corner bench he had built in there and stripped his clothes off watching Castiel closely for any movement indicating he was going to fall. Once Dean was rid of his clothes he closed the door to the shower pulling Castiel up again and helping him sit down in the middle point of the spray from the water that was coming from every direction.
Dean huffed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather you came. At least I know I could trust you not to get man handle around like a rag doll. I‚Äôm sorry Cas, but you haven‚Äôt exactly proven yourself worthy. Without your powers, it‚Äôs like you freeze up.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou were trying to get a 20 on Crowley and me from any demon you could snag. But Crowley didn‚Äôt want to be found, and no one showed when you summoned. But, you found a way didn‚Äôt you, Sam?
Dean nodded biting his lip. ‚ÄúOkay, we‚Äôll take this slow.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm a monster.‚Äù Castiel croaked tears flowing down his face as the door busted open Dean standing there his face furious as he glowered on the both of them. His smell was warm of birch and vanilla, but it did nothing to dissipate the ache in his chest, and the hollow feeling in his stomach.
Dean‚Äôs eyes opened wide in shock. ‚ÄúOkay Cas whatever you want it‚Äôs yours.‚Äù
‚ÄúSam, I have to tell you something.‚Äù Castiel murmured his gaze at his protruding stomach.
‚ÄúCastiel, I don‚Äôt think you realize how good you feel. You‚Äôre so warm and tight around my cock. You‚Äôre doing such a good job taking it all in right down to the hilt. How does it feel, Cas to have me inside of you?‚Äù
‚ÄúI can cure him, Cas. We know how to.‚Äù Sam gushed but Castiel just shook his head.
Sam was combing through police reports and the news looking for anything that could point him to his brother when a loud banging came from the bunkers front door. Both him and Castiel looked up at the door both their eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúWere you expecting someone, Sam?‚Äù
Castiel turned and looked over at his brother, mouthing, ‚ÄòWhat the hell do you think he wants?‚Äô
The wolf frowned at him shaking his head in disappointment but said nothing more. Castiel jerked as he felt two hands clutch his face rubbing soothing circles on his cheeks a lilting voice breeching the screaming. Slowly, ever so slowly Castiel opened his red eyes staring deep into brown depths as Meg talked him down. Castiel felt hollow as he realized none of that had been real, he‚Äôd been standing stock still the entire time. He could see the red of his eyes fade in the reflection of her own in till blue stared back at him. He‚Äôd almost lost it again, had almost lost himself away in his mind while his wolf would have controlled him.
Gabriel glanced over at where Dean and Sam stood speaking in hushed whispers with defensive looks on their faces. ‚ÄúWell if I had a guess, he‚Äôs wearing bright red shorts right now.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to meet you, Castiel. Dean‚Äôs told me a lot about you. You‚Äôre a good at the piano right?‚Äù
Their bedrooms were on the third floor and Castiel crept into his room silently saying nothing to his companion. He was grateful for the attached bathroom showering off all the remaining blood from his face and chest. His mind was exhausted and when his head hit the pillow, he was out cold seconds later and he dreamt of green eyes and a handsome face.
‚ÄúMeg-‚Äù Gabriel started but Chuck held up a hand to silence him his blue eyes weary as he starred Meg down his alpha scent thickening with the scent of a challenge.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not entirely true,‚Äù Gabriel spoke, and Meg‚Äôs eyes locked onto him a spark of hope twinging in her gut. She tried to squash it knowing it would probably lead to disappointment she found though she didn‚Äôt care. She was desperate.
Dean took a step closer. ‚ÄúDo you not like the attention?‚Äù
Castiel woke to a gentle shake of his shoulder his eyes flicking open to stare into two brown orbs, dark circles underneath catering underneath them. She didn‚Äôt get any sleep. Castiel sat up slowly the sheet of the bed bunching around his waist cold air hitting his chest. He stared up at her waiting for anything, an expression, words, a movement. Instead, Meg stared blankly at him her chestnut curls a mess from her hands running through them more than once a clear sign that she‚Äôd been stressing over something. She was dressed in a grey tank top, tight black jeans that had holes from being worn too many that had thinned out from too many washes, and her leather jacket one of the few things she‚Äôd kept when they‚Äôd left that night.
Castiel pushed against Dean‚Äôs chest and immediately the demon pulled away from him, but he kept his arms firmly wrapped around Castiel. ‚ÄúToo much,‚Äù Castiel whispered.
Seeing Castiel had been a shock really. Besides the fact that Dean was pleased he‚Äôd accomplished what he‚Äôd set out to do, he‚Äôd been genuinely happy to see the angel. The fear radiating off of his old lover both pleased him and made him sick. It was the human part of him that was making a headway in his dark mind. Crowley had warned him that he would feel some things for quite awhile afterwards. He said eventually the emotions would disappear.
And he did. Screaming at the top of his lungs profanities he never once had said before tightening around Dean‚Äôs cock pulling the demons orgasm from him. Castiel didn‚Äôt know how long he had blacked out from the sheer force of his first orgasm, but even as he came back up to reality all he felt was warm and satisfied for the first time in his life.
They haven't asked him to do that. He just can't stand seeing them like that. In Castiel's embrace, Dean smiles in his sleep. And all of the distance Castiel tries to put between them during the day vanishes at night. Castiel lights up when Dean cuddles with him. He looks like a kid on Christmas morning when Dean dozes off on him.
Because, when that poison stopped his heart, Dean would be with Castiel. And Mom. And Dad. And Bobby. He would be able to apologize to them all and tell them all how much he loved them. He would beg forgiveness. And when he held Castiel in his arms again, for all eternity, there would be peace when Dean's life was done. Castiel was living proof that there was a God, and a Heaven, and that Dean would be welcome there, despite his terrible transgression.
Sam closed his eyes for a minute. Frustration started to constrict him like a snake. Although it would be selfish to admit it in the face of the extraordinary grief that Dean was feeling, Sam was hurting, too. He had witnessed his friend's murder as well. He had anger and sadness to deal with, too. But, he had to control it. Sam could not cause Dean any more pain than he already felt. Because that was all this was: Dean's broken heart battling against regret and tired excuses.
Because you feel
Imperfections
The final person to address the court was Balthazar. Before he rose to his feet, he took a swig from the flask in the pocket of his jacket. Like Anael, Balthazar had always been the life of the party as well. But now he was drinking to drown the pain. His spunky spark was gone. The days when he used to be selfish and in constant search of sin were a thing of the past.
Benny sees it with such clarity. He might even understand it better than they do. He's had the good fortune of being both a natural and a supernatural creature.
As you sleep and
"Babe, what's wrong?" Dean asked, reaching out again for his mate.
But, in that courtroom, as he listened to Anna Martin recount the details of their affair, Sam found himself thanking God that He had made him so dissimilar to his brother. The idea of sleeping with one of Ruby's sisters would never, ever even cross Sam's mind. Sam could never do anything to hurt Ruby, let alone something as awful as this. Sam believed that his purpose in life was to bring Ruby happiness. When she cried, he cried with her. When she laughed, he felt as though all was right with the world.
Unless‚Ä¶
But Dean was glowing for another reason. He'd lost count of how many drinks he'd had. It seemed one friend or another kept showing up with another shot of smooth Tennessee whiskey.
Castiel tried to read a novel he'd gotten on loan from the library. But he could not focus on it. His eyes bounced back and forth between the windows, the book and his cell phone. At any moment, he expected it to ring and bring the worst possible news. What if Dean had been in an accident? What if he was lying helpless in a hospital bed, his skin getting pricked with IV needles? Oh, what if he was so scared and alone?
But, had Dean not made Castiel happy for all those years? Didn't that mean something? Would Castiel have ever fallen in love if Dean had died? Castiel always said that they were soul mates. Dean still believed that with all his heart. Surely some of the Shirleys still thought yhst as well.
It's devastating.
"I do."
Later on in the movie, Angel, the boy in the skirt, lost his fight against AIDS. As the illness consumed him, Mimi and Roger sang a heartbreaking song about their terrible break up. Castiel glanced over at his humans. Tears stained Sam's cheeks. Sam's sensitivity always impressed Castiel, but he was glad that Dean was not an open book. Castiel liked being the only one who could understand how Dean felt way down deep inside.
Dean and Cass were holding hands.
'I will.'
Falling. It does
If anyone writes a story where Dean tells Castiel he loves him before Cass dies, please I need to read it!!
Dean sat in the cold, wet grass, gazing at his angel. Time meant nothing. He had no idea how long he was out there. But every minute that passed brought a new hurt. More than anything, he wanted to cry, to unleash the pain as if it were a wild beast in a cage that he could set free. But tears eluded him. He was in too much pain to cry.  He wanted to scream from the pain, the worst pain he'd ever felt in his life, but no sound came out when he opened his mouth.
Through eyes almost swollen shut, Castiel saw Jack racing down the stairs. His face was pink, and Castiel hoped that he wasn't crying. It upset Castiel so much that Jack was hurting. More than anything, he wished his child hadn't had to see this.
Dean fished in his pocket for his cell phone. It was a number he did not recognize, but that meant very little in their line of work. He pushed the button to answer the call.
No, he was quite far from it. He felt like he wanted to laugh like a maniac and scream bloody murder at the same time. He felt like he was missing something important, but he could not quite figure out what he needed to fill that deep hole.
The thought of Castiel rejecting him left Dean absolutely terrified. Sure, he'd been shot down before-who hadn't? But he'd never put all of his cards on the table before, not like this. Life without Cass had been intolerable. If Castiel broke his heart, Dean would not want to live anymore.
"Has the jury reached a verdict?"
Much to go
Castiel beamed. "Thank you, Dean."
When Dean continued to pound on Castiel, Jack charged him. But Dean was too strong and Castiel too weak to defend the boy. Dean shoved Jack, and he fell hard against a coffee table. A ceramic lamp crashed to the floor and shattered.
The miracle came as Balthazar and Gabriel swore at the world's longest red light. The man blinked and opened his eyes. Even though they were bloody and puffy, Castiel thought that they were the most beautiful eyes he'd ever seen. As if the words flew from his mouth on their own, Castiel told the man that his eyes were the color of the Earth, God's most incredible creation. He could've died of embarrassment. But the man managed a frail chuckle and answered that Castiel's eyes were as blue as the sky.
Ashamed and emotional, Dean looked away from Jack. His son's words were beautiful and devastating. Castiel had raised such a fine young man. Dean wouldn't take credit for it. Jack was wonderful because of Cass and Cass alone. At such a young age, Jack had a grasp of true forgiveness as God had intended it. 'Cass would be so proud.' The knot in Dean's stomach dug in deeper.
Dean had to see Castiel.
In all of his messed up life, Dean had never felt pain like this. His chest throbbed. His head was spinning, and it was making him dizzy. His lungs had shriveled up like raisins, and he could not catch his breath. He never thought he'd ever be able to stop crying. And maybe that was okay. Considering what he'd done, he did not deserve to feel better.
What had he done? Dean hated baring his soul like this. Even though he acted like nothing fazed him, Dean was very scared of getting hurt. In fact, when he reacted with anger, it was to stop himself from feeling sadness. And here, now, he'd laid everything on the line. Cass could stomp on Dean's heart and smash it into a million pieces if he chose to.
DESTIEL IS FINALLY CANON!! I AM SO HAPPY AND HEARTBROKEN AT THE SAME TIME!!
"No, Sammy."
Speak. I do not
With my cruel
Losing Cass was one of the most difficult things that Sam and Dean had ever gone through. Castiel was their family, their brother. But he was so much more than that. He was their rescuer, their healer, their protector.  His absence was everywhere. Without him, the world was darker, colder and crueler.
Dean cooed, "Baby, it's late. You're tired, and you're stressed. Let's just go to bed, and we can talk things out in the morning."
Like Michael, Gabriel understood. For what Dean did, there could be only one reasonable reaction. But, like Anna's confession, Gabriel's recount of the night they all met hurt Dean in his heart. Oh, sure, it was true. Even Dean wished that Alastair would have killed him. If it would have turned out that way, Castiel would still be alive.
Dean nodded his head towards the needle. 'I don't need it.'
Dean opened the door leading into Castiel's bedroom. The bunker was warmer and cozier with Castiel back inside. Without him, the bunker had stopped feeling like a home. Now, there was nowhere else in the world that Dean would want to be. Sort of.
Much as he hates to admit it, Benny enjoys watching Castiel defend them. The angel makes monsters' eyes burst out of their skulls. He and Dean almost have no need for their weapons. It's pretty great.
"I saw you staring at her like she's a piece of meat, and I didn't like it," Gabriel told him.
Like this, apparently.
The Impala slid down a little hill, past a church with a glowing cross on the roof. ‚úù A few feet from the church, there was a phone booth in a grassy lot. A figure hid in the shadow of the phone booth. In all his life, Dean had never been so happy to see an old outside landline. He parked the Impala and closed the door. Sam followed close behind as the figure emerged from the darkness.
‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not that. I‚Äôm sorry, Meg. I‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù Castiel said trying to swallow around the lump in his throat. He‚Äôd been weak, so very weak, no light at the end only madness and destruction and he hadn‚Äôt wanted to deal with that. He made a silent promise to himself he‚Äôd try harder just so that maybe he‚Äôd never have to see that devastated look on her face again.
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt refer to him like that.‚Äù Castiel hissed and Meg snorted.
Dean sighed. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think I don‚Äôt know that? I know about 90% of the class wants in my pants and the other 10% is in denial. Hell, there are teachers here who have warned me of getting too close to students because of how good looking I am. The thing is, Cas, I‚Äôm tired of denying the want I have for you. The reason I put you on display to the class is because I want them to see how amazing you are. I, for whatever reason, thought that if I always put you on display like I have been others would stay away from you because I made you stand out so much.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù Dean screamed back at the crying baby his eyes flashing black in anger. The baby took one look at him and started crying even harder. Dean huffed changing his eyes back. Dean shook his head at the crying baby his features so similar to his own. If Dean had any doubts the kid was his it was squashed when his eyes had first landed on the sleeping form. Dean couldn‚Äôt believe it as he‚Äôd picked up the child and it had awoken instantly it‚Äôs green eyes going wide in alarm and crying. There was hardly anything in the child‚Äôs features that reminded him of Castiel.
‚ÄúSammy.‚Äù Dean said calmly his green gaze staring up at Sam. ‚ÄúYou know I hate shots.‚Äù
Castiel was surprised as he slipped back into his own body the wolf seeming content to let him control their body. It was odd to feel the pull of the full moon, and yet be in control of his own movements. In the end, Castiel laid back down comforted by the warmth of his longtime friend and committing the moment to memory for when he inevitably stayed here, and she left on whatever journey awaited her away from him.
Castiel whimpered again pawing at the demons back, and moving his hips against him encouraging the demon to move. Dean shook his head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll move when you tell me exactly how you feel with me inside of you.‚Äù
Castiel cried out suddenly when Dean angled his hips a certain way that hit his prostate dead on.
Gabriel sighed looking between the two of them running a hand through his hair. ‚ÄúI can work with in between, but if you get that bad again you have to go back, Cas. We can‚Äôt lose the real you again.‚Äù His brother pleaded, and it was genuine concern Castiel saw in his eyes and heard in the tenor of his voice.
Dean pushed in further and smirked when he found that spot that maked Castiel cry out in lust. With every thrust of his fingers he hit that place reveling in the way Castiel nails dug into his back pulling him closer, and in the way Castiel voice was a mere whisper filled with pleasure.
Dean lurched forward claiming Castiel‚Äôs lips hungrily. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a game to me, angel. Not anymore, because I want you.‚Äù Castiel shuddered violently in Dean‚Äôs arms hearing those words leave his mouth. Even human Dean could never admit aloud that he wanted, Castiel.
The man began shaking blubbering about something or other, but Castiel no longer cared. When Dean reentered the room with the cup Castiel spoke clearly. ‚ÄúHold the cup to his throat, Dean.‚Äù
Castiel groaned closing his eyes, ‚ÄúGive me more Dean. I need more than that.‚Äù
He took them to their room and straight into the bath room, ‚ÄúYou reek of holy oil Cas. I‚Äôm going to clean you up Cas I‚Äôm going to take care of you. Anything you need Cas I‚Äôll give it to you.‚Äù
Sam left Dean there for awhile heading into the library in search for his phone. He dialed Cas and to no surprise he didn‚Äôt answer. ‚ÄúCas, hey it‚Äôs me. I‚Äôve started treating Dean hopefully he should be better here soon. I know you didn‚Äôt want me to tell him, but when he‚Äôs all better I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll want to know. Just give me a call okay?‚Äù
Dean frowned. ‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôll only hold me back.‚Äù
He jogged down the stairs the beta hot on his heels snarling and he saw in her mind as she went to push him down the rest of the stairs in her anger and stepped to the side catching the back of her shirt as she began to fall and pulled her ear close to his mouth. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not the one who has ripped her friend's safety net out from under him and left him to the horrors of his own mind. Think about that while you scream about how horrible I am.‚Äù Dean hissed yanking her back onto the stairs her ass hitting the steps with a solid thud and jogged the rest of the way down the stairs satisfied as he felt the guilt echoing in her mind.
Castiel tilted his head in thought. ‚ÄúI believe there is a God, and therefor I believe in all of his creations even if you cannot see them.‚Äù
‚ÄúSorry for the cold greeting. I‚Äôve been pretty stressed out lately. How is she?‚Äù Gabriel asked his voice concerned and as tired as Castiel felt.
His other half purred stalking towards the omega and inspecting him up close. Castiel growled low and took off up the stairs ignoring his other half. ‚Äú
Dean stood up, ‚ÄúYou were to out of it to remember, but do you remember that werewolf hunt in Wisconsin five years before we took to the darker side of things?‚Äù
Crowley chuckled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find out when you get here. See you soon, squirrel.‚Äù
****TRIGGER WARNINGS*****
Mary gave them a tour of their home and of the grounds after he and Meg left their room. Mary introduced them properly to her son Sam, and her other son Adam both equally friendly and reserved as if waiting to see if they would be staying before they got attached. Both John and Dean were nowhere to be found the entire day. When the sun began to crest the mountains Castiel‚Äôs skin prickled uncomfortably. He would change soon, and he wanted to be far from the rest of the clan before he did.
‚ÄúWho?‚Äù She demanded, and Gabriel gave her a look.
The line was silent for a long time. ‚ÄúCas, man I don‚Äôt even know what to say to that. Did Dean know? I mean does he know?‚Äù
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean shook his head tisking again before he slapped Castiel across the face. The angel under him jolted to consciousness, and immediately groaned at the brutal pace in which Dean was taking him.
Thank you all for sticking with me through this story. I know the updates have been sparse, but I will finish this story, and I am so glad to have you all with me. Thank you.
Castiel dragged his eyes away from the hallucination and back to Meg who glanced at the area he was staring and back at him with sad eyes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre seeing him again.‚Äù She murmured worry thick in her voice.
Castiel rolled his eyes and shook off the hand still placed firmly on his shoulder. ‚ÄúWhatever.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right big boy pay attention to me. We‚Äôve got to go or else they‚Äôre going to kill you.‚Äù She pleaded, and the wolf growled grudgingly yet followed her out of the bar and into the dark of night.
Hannah nodded picking up the infant carefully and placing him into Castiel‚Äôs arms. The babies wales quieted almost instantly as it yawned and look up at Castiel with it‚Äôs bright blue eyes. ‚ÄúHello, Gabriel.‚Äù Castiel rumbled.
Castiel cocked his head to the side. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù
‚ÄúCastiel, if you had the chance to no longer be rogue, would you take it?‚Äù His gaze flicked to his wolf who was leaning heavily the wall of the manor is features expressionless waiting for an answer.
He took too long to reply, his silence deafening as she tried to fill it with questions of him that he didn‚Äôt want to answer. ‚ÄúI knew it was bad. Gods I knew it was bad, but you wouldn‚Äôt listen to me to get help. Mary told me what happened, your plan, and how she and the omega stopped you. Why, Cas? Why wouldn‚Äôt you let me help you?‚Äù She asked her fathomless brown eyes pleading for an answer on why he‚Äôd leave her.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a demon you can‚Äôt find anything beautiful all you see is destruction.‚Äù Castiel murmured trying even when he knew he was lost to fight him. He was trying to fight the pull of Dean Winchester, but with breath he found himself loosing his resolve.
Castiel nodded running his hand threw his hair. ‚ÄúHow are you going to keep him from finding us again?‚Äù
Castiel wakes up in the medical room within the Winchester Mansion. Quickly upon waking he realizes that he can no longer hear or see his wolf and that Lilith is still connected to his consciousness. This causes Castiel a lot of anxiety, and he sets out to find her. Upon finding her he comes across Bela who seems distant and overall just off. She's watching over Lilith and explains Dean is not allowed near her for the fear that he might try and get inside of her mind and might break her mind before they can get any real information from her. Castiel finds his wolf, looking sickly standing next to Lilith and notices she's holding a black rock that draws him in. Castiel begins to feel overwhelmed so he goes to the forest to decompress and calls Meg to tell her that he is scared that Lilith is still messing with him. She hops on the next flight to come to him. Hours pass and Dean goes and finds Castiel. The spell that Lilith cast at the end of the last chapter kicks in, and he ends up attacking Dean to try and kill him. Meg shows up to stop Castiel, knocking him off of Dean in her wolf form. Castiel tries to change into his own wolf form and is unsuccessful. This brings on a panic attack in which Castiel spirals and thinks about ending his life to get away from Lilith. Dean puts him to sleep then the chapter switches to Dean's point of view. Meg yells at Dean for letting Castiel near Lilith, and the two of them return to the village where they meet up with Dean's family, Castiel's, and Bela. Adam is having visions of the future, and he and Dean try and decide on the best one. They choose one and they go to find Bobby who got in contact with his druid friend, Jody, who is coming to help them with Castiel. Dean is suspicious of Bela and finds her mind to look through it. He finds her in front of Lilith's cage talking to her about how she failed to kill Dean, and is going to lose Castiel. Lilith tries to ask for a second chance, and Bela denies her. She has a thought that it is her turn to try and kill him. Dean tells John about what he saw, and his father goes to find his mother to take care of Bela. Dean takes Castiel to Bobby, and Jody is already there. She explains that Lilith didn't have enough power to do this spell and would have had to have help from Rowena. She theories that Rowena's real goal was to have Castiel pass away which would cause Dean to be weaker. Without the other half of his soul he would pass away. Because they trapped half of Castiel's soul in an object instead of attaching it to another soul, which would have been an option, that was probably not told to Lilith there is an extremely high chance of Castiel's other half of his soul to die and so would he. Castiel wakes up and tells them that he believes his wolf's soul is in the rock she was holding and that is the object his soul is in, and Jody asks Dean to go with her to get the stone. The story switches back to Castiel's perspective and he has a touching moment with Meg where we find out she's been mated for about two days, but she'll always be there for Castiel. Bobby interrupts to explain to Castiel that they will put him in a dream state and guide his wolf into the same dream state where they will have to reconcile otherwise his wolf's soul will die without it being attached to anything, and Castiel will not live long without the other half of his soul. Eventually, Dean and Jody come back in and Dean is covered in blood. Castiel wants to ask about it, but he's shot down by Dean to talk about it later. Castiel asks everyone to leave, and he apologizes to Dean for trying to kill him. Dean says they will talk about this later as well, and just tells Castiel to come back to him whole when he wakes up. Castiel takes a potion that Bobby gave and falls asleep the last thing he hears is Dean saying, "Please come back to me."
Castiel couldn‚Äôt deny he wanted Dean, just like every other person who ever entered his class wanted him, but he had to wonder. If he agreed to this and found he wanted more of Dean, if Castiel truly got to know Dean could they be something more?
Castiel watched the omega stop and look back at him cursing, ‚ÄúSon of a bitch.‚Äù He jogged back to him and Castiel growled menacingly the omega rolling his eyes.
So this work is for a reader of mine IDontUnderstandThatReference. She requested me to do this so long ago and I just now had the inspiration to start this. This does take place in Season 10 so if you're not there yet I wouldn't read this. There won't be to many spoilers I think, but who knows. I did take the dialog from the episode where Sam tries to cure Dean. I only change it at the very end. So no I don't own any rights over the dialog or the characters, but the dialog was need for what I was going to do while trying to stay true the story as much as I can given the prompt. So I hope you enjoy the first chapter, and to IDon'tUnderstandThatReference I hope this comes out in some fashion that you've imagined.
Away into
Okay so i know in reality Dean would not get sentenced to death for this crime... It's just for the sake of the story...
Still, he found himself feeling thankful that Anna had kept the secret for as long as she had. If Castiel would have found out before he passed, Dean would not have been able to handle his love's reaction. While letting Sam down upset Dean, nothing could ever hurt him as much as breaking Castiel's heart had.
"You shouldn't be with him," Jo Harvelle whispered, pulling the blankets over her bare chest to block the late night chill.
As machines clicked on and warm liquid swam into his veins, Dean held Sam's gaze as long as he could. Tears fell from Sam's eyes, and he leaned closer to Ruby for comfort. Dean knew the heartache he was causing his brother, and he prayed his brother would find solace. After all, in mere seconds, Dean would be reunited with Castiel for all eternity. And, in a few decades, Sam and Dean would be together. Dean didn't want Sam to be sad. He wanted him to carry on.
Sometimes, they would go further. Dean's strength had returned, so the idea of being intimate with him frightened Benny a little less. But Benny still had to be so careful. The last thing he wanted to do was drink his friend. Not even for a second did Benny want to be undeserving of the second chance at life that Dean was giving him.
As always, Billie had been able to see right through him. She could tell that he had lost his will to live. In a span of ten minutes, he'd lost his best friend Cass, his mother Mary and his friends Crowley and Kelly. After being dealt such a blow, what was there to live for? Sammy? As Sam had proved during Dean's stint in Purgatory, Sam could get along just fine without his brother.
"Ruby. It's Castiel. Is Dean still with Sam?" Castiel pressed.
The look on Dean's face as Castiel leaves the bunker in 15x3 is haunting and beautiful and so so sad. I wanted to explore what was going through his mind as he faced one of his greatest fears and heart breaks.
The acrid scent burned their noses when they breathed. Smoke swirled into the sky like a tornado. The fire crackled as it consumed Castiel's body.
Ruby had never liked him much. The feeling had always been mutual. But Dean could see that Ruby was struggling to hold herself together for Sam. Much as they never got along, Dean always admired her resilience. And, say what he would about her, but Ruby loved Sam. Dean knew that his baby brother would be safe with her.
And, Sam had always adored Castiel. He considered him family from the moment they'd met. He thought him a perfect match for Dean, and he was happy to see his brother had found someone so special. It made no sense. How could Dean have beaten Castiel to death? Castiel, who fed stray kittens in the street. Castiel, who was such an excellent beekeeper that his bees never stung him and whose honey was the most delicious in town. Castiel, who brought Ruby a bouquet of sunflowers üåª and a homemade pineapple upside down cake at the hospital after the birth of their son. Castiel, who'd raised Jack to be such a fine, loving young man, in spite of the emotional distance of his own father, cult novelist Chuck Shirley?
Next week Castiel might tell Dean about his deal with the Empty and I don't know how i will deal. üò≠
' Given your suspicion, did you and your brothers and sisters talk to him about breaking up with Dean?'
Anger flickered in Dean's beautiful green eyes. It caught Jo by surprise. Her complexion paled, and her puppy dog eyes swelled with sadness.
LOVE üíò
Dean's heart raced, and his stomach twisted. He could feel the adrenaline and the fear heating up his blood. It seemed he was the only person in the world more afraid of the injection itself than the lethal poisons contained in it. But he put up no fight today. It wouldn't have made a difference, as he was strapped to the bed. Regardless, he had decided a while back that he would focus on all of the pain and the fright. It was nothing compared to the terror Castiel had experienced before his death, but it would be Dean's final form of penance.
Gabriel and Balthazar called him crazy and headed for home. They could not understand his devotion to a complete stranger. As he watched Dean sleep, glancing at his heart monitor every so often, Castiel could not quite comprehend it either. But he could not abandon Dean. He wouldn't.
Somebody across the bar put a quarter in the jukebox, and a country-rock song blasted around the room. Excited, Anna took Dean by the hand and led him on to the dance floor. Dean's temperature began to rise as Anna rubbed her body against his. He remembered how seductive she was in that slinky black dress at the wedding. Now, in those tight jeans that hugged her hips and the low cut sweater, her tiny hands sliding up and down his rock hard abs, he found her irresistible. In her eyes he could see the desire, and he could almost taste it when she nibbled on her lower lip.
But, of course, Dean was giving him a hard time about it. It wouldn't be Dean if he wasn't making things difficult. Castiel loved that about him. Castiel loved everything about Dean.
Even before Castiel had inspired Dean to explore the Christian faith, Dean pretty much knew the passage by heart. Psalm 23. It had been recited at his mother's funeral. And his father's. And Bobby's.
I may edit this more and make it stronger because I love Ruby/Gen so much. I want to do her justice but I'm really tired now lol...
'You were almost beaten to death!'
Despite Dean's best efforts to be strong, he got choked up. Tears pooled in his eyes and started to leak. Overcome with emotion, Dean hung his head. Never in his life had he ever felt so vulnerable.
With trembling hands, Sam tore off the packing tape. Beneath the flaps he found the summation of his brother's life in the time since Castiel's passing. The warden had given Sam and Ruby all of Dean's possessions after the execution.
Not that it matters all that much, Benny soon realizes. Dean is glowing as he pulls Castiel into a bear hug. The angel does not embrace him back, but Dean is too relieved and happy to notice.
Even worse to behold was Balthazar. Dean had always liked Balthazar. He was a playboy who lived every day as if he were a resident of the playboy mansion. Never before had he seen Balthazar without a mischievous smile on his face. Tonight, it had been replaced by a broken frown. His dark eyes were absent, as if his mind were anywhere but there.
"Whoa!" Dean exclaimed.
And now
Mom and Castiel would never have wanted that. If anything, Dean giving up would have infuriated Castiel. Dean remembered when he wanted to say yes to Michael during the Apocalypse. So hurt by his betrayal, Castiel gave Dean the worst beating he'd ever endured. Dean had more than paid Cass back for that when the Mark of Cain possessed him to almost beat the angel to death. But he'd never forgotten how important it was to always keep fighting. So. No. Now, just like then, Dean would have to muddle through his doubts and his pain.
"Dean! Cass! Dinner's ready!" Sam called out.
Michael stomped back to the spectator's area and rejoined his family. Raphael and Uriel patted him on the shoulders. They shot menacing looks Dean's way, and he returned the gesture.
Intrigued, Benny inquires,"What?"
This is the final chapter. Thank you to everyone who has read it and stuck by me over the past few months. This story is so important to me. I will miss it a lot.
Dean's heart pounded against his chest hard enough to break his ribs. His mouth fell open in surprise. Tears pushed at the corners of his wide eyes. He lost focus on the road, and he had to swerve the Impala to avoid a rock wall.
Dean was jealous. He always got jealous when somebody else had Castiel's attention. Though he rarely spoke the words, his body language always gave him away.
But he had to see him. Dean had to hold Castiel in his arms. He had to feel the angel's comforting touch. He had to lose himself in those ocean blue eyes. Dean had to see Castiel.
Castiel welcomed him into the room with a kind smile. Dean's knees wobbled, and he worried that he looked ridiculous as he walked. Chuck had really outdone Himself when He made Castiel so damn beautiful, with those pure blue eyes and that soft black hair. And that mesmerized stare that Cass reserved just for Dean.
My numerous
"If...if something happens to me, promise me you'll watch out for Dean."
"You have to write a statement," Sam advised, sliding a legal pad and pen across the table.
Castiel feigned a smile, but it was quite obvious that it was a fake one. Sam rose to shut off the video. They glanced at the clock: 1:52am. Another day of chasing Kelly Kline and the British Men of Letters awaited them. For the humans, this meant it was time to get some rest.
"No."
Castiel turned to the nurse. 'Does he really need the IV?'
Dean considered slowing down a bit. They were moving so, so fast. Castiel did not have much experience with physical intimacy, and this might have been a bit much for him. There was significant risk for Dean as well. Castiel was much stronger than Dean, and he could hurt him without meaning to. More than that, Dean wondered how all of this would affect their friendship, their partnership and the love that was blooming between them like flowers peeking their heads out of the soil before the snow melted.
Thank you all so much again for your kindness and support. God bless you all! Please enjoy!! üéÑ
Are battered and
Although it was undoubtedly the truth in Dean's case, the insanity plea was still a long shot. The jurors were avoiding Dean's eyes, and they had only deliberated for a few hours before reaching a verdict. Those were not good signs. It didn't help that southern laws stipulated that a murder charge could stick if, in the course of committing a felony, death of a victim occurred. The assault on Castiel led to his death, and that equalled murder in the eyes of the law.
Dean was attracted to him.
Jack opened the piece of paper and read, "Anytime I did something bad and Dean and Cass punished me, I would ask them if they still loved me. Castiel always said, 'You can still love someone and not like what they did. That's what love actually is: understanding that people are imperfect and being able to accept them and treat them with kindness.'" Jack lowered the page away from his face. His glossy eyes met Dean's. "Dean, I really hate what you did. I miss my dad so much; it hurts all the time. It was wrong of you to take Castiel away from us. But I will always love you."
Destiel is finally canon.
For me to
You just don't see
Thank you so much everyone! I hope you all have enjoyed this!! I'm really proud of it. I believe it turned out better than I had hoped.
"Cass!" Dean cries out.
And what he said about Dean not being able to stand losing Benny, well, it must be true. Angels possess telepathic powers. Dean has mentioned before how Castiel gets him better than anyone else in the world as well. Castiel knows what Dean is thinking and how he feels deep down.
"We the jury in the above titled case, find the defendant, Dean Winchester, guilty of Capital Murder in the death of Castiel Winchester," Judge Death read aloud.
No. Dean would continue to hunt. He would get the job done, just as he always had. And it would not be because Billie or Chuck had decided that they needed him to do things for them. Although it would be half-hearted, he would do it for himself. Maybe he failed, a lot, but, for better or for worse, Dean Winchester was a hunter. If he gave up on hunting, he gave up who he was.
Not wanting to bully a grieving sister, Sam backed off. He offered her a glass of water, which she accepted. He gave her an apologetic smile. He did not want to hurt Anna or any of Castiel's siblings.  All he wanted to do was save Dean.
"Because it's wrong, Sammy!" Dean snapped. His usual anger and fire were back for the first time since they'd lost Cass, and Sam was almost grateful to be on the other side of his brother's tirade. "Because I wasn't supposed to be in love with him!" Dean slammed his fist down on the table, rattling their drinks. His voice softened. "But I was."
Dean tried to tell himself all that. Castiel would not want him to mourn. Castiel never wanted Dean to be sad. Quite the contrary, Castiel went out of his way to protect and please Dean. He would not like seeing Dean going through this, especially because of him.
Each table in the reception hall had its own little white Christmas tree. A small bar offered up whiskey and beer. Waiters served hamburgers, steaks, fish and chicken, as well as vegetarian garbage for Sam. Champagne flowed like water. Everybody was laughing and enjoying the party.
I was blessed to spend the most amazing weekend with the best friend that I love with all my heart. I really feel how Castiel felt in 15x18 when he said he loved Dean and that happiness isn't necessarily in having but just in saying it. But I am not as strong and kind as Castiel. I want to have my best friend, and it brought me more joy than anything else in the world when he said he loved me too.
"What was that now?" Benny cannot believe what he is hearing.
Have caused you. Still
In desperation, Dean stared up at the Heavens. Majestic stars dazzled in the dark night sky. Dean prayed to Chuck to bring him his  angel back, as He had done in the past. He begged Amara to give him the thing he needed most, as she had done with his mother.
Dean was seated at the head table at his wedding reception. His glass of Tennessee whiskey was half full in front of him. Everything looked Christmasy and pretty, from the snowflakes to the mistletoe and holly that decorated the venue. All of his friends and family were gathered there, eating and drinking and celebrating such a jolly occasion. The room smelled of balsam and sugary sweets, just as he remembered.
There was not a hint of his usual sarcasm when he spoke. His question sounded genuine, like something he hadn't noticed before had just been pointed out to him. The rage from the previous moment melted away, and, somehow, Dean seemed slightly smaller.
Castiel clutched the DVD to his chest. For a long time, Castiel had wanted to see Rent. He'd caught a few minutes of it in a motel room one night. They were hunting demons in Nebraska and the boys needed a burger break. While Sam and Dean ate, Castiel channel surfed. He loved TV and thought it was one of humanity's greatest achievements.
Pushing Dean never worked. Dean always had to deal with his problems in his own way first. Then, once he'd done that, he would open up about his feelings. Still, Sam couldn't help but think that this was different.
No. Never again.
Dean lifted his bruised hand up just a little and opened his fingers. Touched, Castiel offered Dean his hand. Electricity coursed through Castiel's body as their fingers laced together. Until now, he'd thought that feeling was just another fable in the mythical annals of love. Never in his life had he ever been more wrong.
To leave me.
Sam decided to keep Dean's clothes, as well as the pictures and letters Dean had received while incarcerated. Ruby threw out his toiletries. It was odd that the guards had even packed them up.
Sam and Ruby. Dean wished that he could tear himself free of these bindings, throw his arms around his baby brother and shield him from this horror. It was what his father had always expected of him, and Dean had let him down in the worst possible way. Instead of keeping Sammy safe, Dean was causing him grief and despair. Sam's eyes were already pink and puffy, and Dean could not imagine how much worse it would be for Sam when the guards pushed the buttons.
The creepy
Of saving grace.
Anael took her place in the spotlight next. Dean had always liked Anael, even though she had made clear that the feeling was not mutual. She and Castiel had been very close because they were polar opposites. Anael loved being the center of attention, while Castiel enjoyed working the behind the scenes magic.
"It's not what you think," Castiel utters.
But Sam could not even begin to imagine how hard this was for Dean. Castiel was Dean's angel. Dean and Castiel loved each other in ways Sam could never understand. Castiel could reach Dean in ways that Sam never could.
Of course, Ruby could understand their anger. But, for the life of her, she could not fathom how they could not walk a mile in Sam's shoes. Sam didn't want to lose his brother any more than they'd wanted to lose theirs. It wasn't that complicated. It didn't mean Sam didn't care about Castiel, only that he had tried to save his brother from the gallows.
From somewhere deep down inside of him, from the place in his soul that allowed him to sacrifice himself for Sam time and again, Dean Winchester drew out courage like water from a well.
Castiel's eyes widened as Dean started to unbutton his flannel shirt. Cass pulled Dean back for another kiss. The angel rubbed the hunter's chest, held his hand to his racing heart. Dean tugged at Castiel's tie, trying to undo the knot.
Our eyes meet, but
Castiel peered out the window. Then, at long last, bright white headlights shone into the driveway. The Impala's engine hissed as it shut off. 'Thanks be to God'.
Judge Death was not an unattractive man. He had no scars, and he had pretty brown hair and warm eyes. He dressed smooth and classy in fancy suits. It made him look like he was a member of the Dilinger gang in the 1930s. Yet, there was something very intimidating about the way he carried himself. His voice was cool and calm and eerie. He relished his power and felt untouchable because of it.
Tying the laces of his heavy black boots, Dean ordered her, "I said, drop it."
Dead to you.
At Sam's recommendation, Dean pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. It was his best defense. From his history, his fear of abandonment would make him snap at the thought of losing Castiel. The psychologist they hired to examine Dean testified as such. There was no self defense, as Castiel would never have done anything to hurt Dean. It was the only plausible explanation as to why Dean would destroy so many lives and dreams, including his own.
In their line of work, looks were quite often deceiving. They'd only gotten to meet the ghoul wearing Adam Winchester; they'd never had the pleasure of meeting their little brother. A shapeshifter had used Dean's skin to commit murder. A demon had possessed Bobby and had almost forced him to stab Dean to death.
"I can change, Cass. No more cheating. No more lies. I swear. I'll do anything you want."
He let me
Before all of this, Ruby had considered Castiel's family as her friends. She'd been quite close with Anael, like Samantha and Miranda from Sex and the City. Now they could barely bring themselves to look at her, as if she'd been the one to ravage their family. It was ruining their relationship with Jack, as well. This had caused Sam great pain, but Ruby had assured him that he might choose to come to them when he got older. Deep down inside, hidden in a place where Sam would never find even the faintest shadow of doubt, she hoped her own words were true.
It's him.
Pain I've
Dean wakes up soon after, and it's back to business. It's as if this conversation never took place. Benny and Cass continue to bicker. Dean continues to insist that they must bust out together.
But, Dean knew that Sam would be okay. Sam had Ruby, and their two wonderful sons. It would be hard for Sam, but he would thrive, just as he had at Stamford.
"Family secret. But I hope you appreciate the lesson I was teaching you."
"Dean raced over to my brother and grabbed a hold of him before he tumbled off of the mountain. His determination to save Castiel was unlike anything I've ever seen.  He held him on his own until Benny was able to help pull him back to safety. When he was steady on his feet, Dean pulled Castiel into the tightest hug; and he touched his face in such a tender way. Dean had the most grateful smile on his face.
Benny considered turning Dean. He'd never turned a human before. But he'd seen his Maker change people. It wasn't difficult. That way, at least Dean would not die.
Dean stands trial for Castiel's murder.
Dopamine.
Anna accepted that. Though, she did not have much of a choice. There was no way she could blackmail Dean without screwing herself in the process. She could not tell Castiel the truth without ostracizing herself from her entire family. Nor could she even stand to think of how the church would react to her disgraceful infidelity. It was a lose-lose, but it was just desserts in light of what they'd done.
Cass. It was like a bullet to the chest, only worse. It caused him agonizing pain, but it was not enough to kill him. He slammed his fists against the table, startling Sam and making him jump.
'Was it because you weren't that worried about the safety of your brother and your nephew?'
Dean stared at the fire, but he saw nothing. He didn't see his best friend turning to ash. He didn't see the flames climbing the pyre. He didn't see Sam blinking back tears. He just didn't see.
Because of all of the emotions he was experiencing, it took Dean a few moments to realize that he was no longer feeling Castiel's chest moving up and down against his head.  But he became very aware of it when Castiel's arms went slack and fell from their embrace. When he did, a horror he'd never felt in his whole miserable life swept over him. With more gentility this time, he pushed Jack back to give himself some room to tend to his love.
"I love you," Dean declared.
If there were any high points in the trial for the defense, it would have been Anna's testimony. Just like Naomi and Anael, Anna had been called upon by the Prosecutor to attest to the violence she'd witnessed Dean perpetrate against Castiel. While Naomi had come across as almost robotic in her honesty and Anael very theatrical, Anna was emotional and sympathetic. In order to undermine her credibility, Sam knew he would have to go for the jugular.
Gabriel, Anael and Balthazar give their victim's statements. Judge Death renders his sentence.
Broken look
'STOP BICKERING LIKE AN OLD MARRIED COUPLE!'
"I know you miss Cass. Even Gabriel and Michael know you miss Cass. Look, all I'm asking you to do is write about how much Cass meant to you and how sorry you are," Sam whispered.
'Yes.'
Before the bohemians could exit the train on the small screen, Dean had hollered at Cass to turn that junk off. Always eager to please Dean, Cass changed the channel to an old black and white movie. It was a good movie, and it held Castiel's attention for the duration of the boys' meal time.
'It isn't!'
But, he had kept those thoughts to himself that night. Sam had had that same argument with Cass since the day the angel admitted his feelings for Dean. Everytime Cass expressed doubt, Sam would promise him that Dean would open his full heart to him one day. That night, with that dejected look in Castiel's eyes, the argument sounded very hollow. Instead, Sam elected to pat Cass on the shoulder and let him be alone.
My whole life.
Sam sat down on the couch. For a moment, he just studied the note. Should he read it? Was it a violation of his brother's privacy? Did it matter?
"I need you, Castiel."
Face lit up with hope and excitement, Dean shoved past Gabriel. All that mattered was seeing Castiel. As he searched for his best friend,  Dean stopped caring about how Gabriel gave him those terrible visions. Once he found Castiel, they'd be nothing but dreadful memories. But until he touched Castiel, until his eyes beheld him, he would not be so certain that everything he'd experienced had been fake.
It was always Sam's impression that Dean did not know about Cass chasing Dean's night terrors away. But perhaps he was wrong. Perhaps Dean had known all along. Now, he would never know that safety again.
"'Was'?" Sam pried.
"I said, 'no', Sam! I am not going to spill my soul in front of a whole bunch of strangers who don't give a damn about me or my family!" Dean shouted.
For that reason, Benny decided it was best that they didn't take that big step. It would have hurt them both in the end. Well, it still hurt, because Benny liked Dean so much more than he could even wrap his mind around. But he knew it would have crushed him to face that ultimate rejection when Dean was reunited with the person he loved.
The judge leaned towards the foreman. Around the county jail, the men had nicknamed the judge 'the Fourth Horseman.'In part, it was because of his terrible name: Judge Death. Mostly it was because he never hesitated to sentence a defendant to capital punishment. He was always eager to bring about the end of life.
I don't give up.
"Gabriel? What the hell was that?" Dean demanded.
In a frail, uneven voice, Dean whispered, "Take care of my brother, Ruby. Goodbye Sammy. I'm so sorry...for everything."
Time and space,
It was always difficult for Dean to disappoint Cass. But, damn, really? A musical? That was a lot to ask.
"Hello?" Dean said.
I know it
More than anything, Sam wished that he could lie to Dean. Oh, how easy it would be to assure his brother that the angel knew how the hunter loved him. Doing so might just take a pound of weight off of his brother's shoulders.
Thank you all so much!! God bless!!
I hope y'all enjoy it!!
For all of the
"Cass!" Dean screamed.
Benny extends a hand and helps Castiel back to his feet. Then he steals a glimpse at Dean. Dean is panting a little from leftover nerves. But he is glowing with relief and gratitude.
He looked to his brother, but Sam just shrugged. Sam never liked getting in the middle of any of their quarrels, petty and insignificant as they may be. He couldn't count on his brother to back him up on this. When Dean turned back to Castiel, his resolve began to crack.
But those green eyes trapped him yet again. Dean stared up at him expectantly with those doe eyes of his. He looked so human and so fragile, and yet, so hopeful, as he awaited Benny's response.
Against his own will, Dean finished the tea. He tried to rest again, but he was just too cold. Even with the tea in his belly, he could not stop shaking. The sun had slipped below the horizon, and darkness was close at hand.
"'Obviously I'm less than comfortable with that,"' Benny remarks, not that it will change anything.
It wasn't right for him to pretend to be in some perfect fairy tale marriage. Dean and Jo could be so happy together, fishing and hunting and going out to bars. He never did things Dean enjoyed. Why should Dean wake up in his bed every morning?
Cass's return had healed all of his wounds. But it had done more than that. It gave Dean hope. Better than that, Dean now had another chance at true happiness, a chance to accept who he was and what he wanted most out of life. He had what every person in the world who had ever lost a loved one dreamed of for the remainder of their days.
Dean's execution üòø
Sick with sorrow, Castiel stumbled back into the house. Dean held onto his arm to steady him, but Castiel pulled his arm away. His heart felt as if it had been thrown on the floor and stomped on.
And he was
'"You know, and you didn't‚Ä¶'"
Cass gave him that darling look of confusion again. "We don't smoke cigarettes," he whispered.
No. Dean didn't care about any of that. For once in his abnegation life, Dean was going to be selfish. Dean wanted Castiel. If he couldn't have him, he was going to take out all of his anger and grief on every stupid son-of-a-bitch that dared to cross his path.
The guard slammed the door behind him as he stepped out. Sam loosened his tie. The room seemed so much more uninviting. Dean's hands were still unsteady as he adjusted his restraints and tried to make himself comfortable on the hard metal chair. Seeing that did not put Sam any more at ease.
"But I die, Without You!"
'I promise I won't.'
You. Still I
And, of course, Dean hated himself for sleeping with his husband's sister, of all people. But sex with Anna was addictive for its forbidden-ness and for the sensuality she exuded every time she moved her thin body and shook her long red locks.
A warning?
No. That wasn't it.
What Dean was thinking as Castiel left the bunker in 15x3
"Yes, there was violence. Yes, the relationship was unhealthy. But Dean and Castiel were in love. There was so much love there. Dean made Castiel so happy. Of course, I think Dean should spend his life trying to atone for killing Castiel. But please, don't kill him. It's not what Cass would have wanted. And I don't want Jack to lose another father. I thank the court for its time."
Benny has not forgotten about his conversation with Castiel and his promise to keep Dean out of harm's way. It still troubles him that the angel may bolt on them again at some point. But he has decided not to share his suspicions with Dean. There's no need in worrying him over something that may never happen.
But Benny could not do it. Becoming a vampire was not something he would have chosen for himself. He would not impose this life on Dean. Dean would've hated being one of the freaks he hunted. Not to mention, their escape hatch would not open if Dean was no longer human.
A hush fell on the packed courtroom as Jack approached the witness box. He did not look at anyone as he walked, and he seemed to be trying to make himself smaller and less noticeable. Yet, he was impossible to ignore, with those bright golden eyes and almost supernatural beauty. To his chest he clutched a folded piece of paper. His movements intrigued the journalists, who jotted down notes and snapped photographs.
It may have been too late. Maybe nobody would ever hear his words, not even Castiel, who so deserved to hear them. Maybe it would be scary and hurt like hell.
To leave. If
Tried harder
The judge scheduled the sentencing hearing for the following day, and Dean was escorted out of the courtroom. Sam followed the paddy wagon to the county jail and arranged for the use of a consultation room. Sam had always hated coming to the jail. Even as a visitor, the snapping of the locks made him feel super claustrophobic. He never understood how his clients could bear it, never tasting the rain and the snow in an open meadow, never being able to escape barbed wired walls and armed guards.
In his mind, Dean conjured up the image of Castiel in the hospital on the night they'd met. He'd been suffering with grave injuries and surrounded by strangers with their faces hidden behind masks and holding sharp objects in their hands. It had been overwhelming and scary.
His mistakes
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel was glowing as he greeted friends and family and indulged on Christmas cookies. Dean had never seen his husband so happy. He was glad to have been able to please the person he loved most in this world.
Dean/Benny is also canon!! I had to include Benny in the story. I just love him and I love canon Denny as well!!
Still, it was true, what she had said. How could Dean deny it? He could not be in love if he was crawling into Jo's bed every chance he got. Clearly something was missing in THEIR relationship. So it needed to end. Dean needed to be with the person he was into the most.
As Balthazar left the witness box, the judge turned to the defendant's table. "Mr. Winchester, would you like to make a statement?"
So, Benny lied down beside Dean and scooped him into his arms. Benny had thought that this was only going to soothe Dean. But nothing had ever been so comforting to Benny as the feeling of Dean's heart beating against his chest. It had never occurred to Benny that he would miss intimacy so much. He hadn't missed physical contact so much until he hugged Dean. But now that he had, he could not fathom not having that connection anymore.
DESTIEL FLUFF!!
Cold and callous. Anna hadn't always been that way. When he'd first met her, she'd been sweet and shy. It was only after Dean refused to leave Cass for her that she'd changed. Still, he would have never thought that she would want him dead, not over their meaningless liaison from so very long ago.
Rebounds can be fun. It's casual. There's no drama, no strings attached. Benny has nothing against rebounds, when he is prepared for it.
Sam enjoyed arguing cases before a jury. He liked using word play and the occasional smokescreen to achieve his desired outcome. But he still could not stand visiting this God forsaken place.
To his surprise, Dean's mesmerizing green eyes locked with Castiel's own mystic blue ones. In Dean's sad stare, Castiel could see the decades of torture with needles that Dean, who had never liked needles to begin with, had suffered in Hell. Castiel still expected Dean to withdraw from him, as he always did when things got too emotional. Instead, Dean inched closer to Castiel on the couch and relaxed at the Angel's protective touch.
"Cass?" Dean managed to squeak. Sam gasped.
Trying to be sly, Dean let go of Cass's hand. Although Castiel had expected it, he could not contain a noticeable frown. In an effort to soften the blow, though,  Dean admitted, "That wasn't the worst two hours of my life."
Pure sorrow
As it starts to sink in, Benny murmurs, "You're gonna ditch him. Again."
It was only in the arms of his angel did Dean realize that he had started shaking, and it was only in Castiel's protective embrace that it began to abate. Once Dean was able to steady himself, he stepped over to the rack and picked up the West Side Story DVD.
It's just the way they look at each other...
When Dean refused to respond, Sam cleared his throat and said, "C'mon, Cass, I'll watch it with you."
"All that mattered to Dad was that YOU were safe," Dean argued. "I had to be responsible. I had to be perfect."
Dean stated, "Stop it now. You're going to wake Jack."
'Hey.' Dean gave him a pained smile.
Dean loves Castiel.
Frowning, Castiel placed the DVD back in its spot on the store shelf. Sam had insisted they go to a real store to shop for fruits and vegetables. Despite Dean's whines that he was not a bunny and wouldn't eat like one, he still found himself meandering around the entertainment section while Sam raided produce. Cass had asked if they could have a movie night, and Dean had agreed.
'If I've ever seen anyone that does.'
I can never
Blood I drew
In all of the time they'd been seeing each other, Jo had never felt Dean's legendary wrath unleashed on her. It wasn't so much that she was afraid. Her mother had taught her to fight at a young age, and Jo was confident that she could defend herself if need be. But Jo cared about Dean and didn't want to agitate him.
Had any
Apart. It
In an even more unbelievable twist of fate, Dean started to unbutton his filthy flannel shirt. Benny pressed his lips to the hunter's cheek, then kissed below his ear and on his neck. It was all too good to be true. In their excitement, neither of them had considered the risks of what they were doing.
Knock! Knock! Knock!
Faced in
As he did so, a folded piece of paper fell from the Bible. Sam bent down to pick it up. He noticed the word "Castiel' written on the front in Dean's messy print.
The last thing Dean remembered was falling asleep from the medicine the warden had injected into him. He checked his arms for the IVs so that he could rip them out. Instead, he discovered that his suit jacket was covering unharmed, Virgin skin with no traces of needle  whatsoever.
Castiel's mind drifted back to their wedding day. Dean's smile had swallowed up his entire face, and his eyes had sparkled with delight as Cass started walking down the aisle. Castiel had to keep reminding himself not to race down the aisle and into his boyfriend's arms. When the minister pronounced them as husbands, the kiss they shared had brought Castiel to tears of joy.
I may come back and rework this a little more. I didn't realize how short this chapter was, so I added to it. But now it feels a bit choppy. I really hope you all liked it. The following chapters are longer and much less choppy.
The worst part of it is, Dean means what he just said. He is not the type to renig on a promise. It's not in Dean to let down someone he cares about, especially not Castiel. The intensity of the love in Dean's eyes for that angel has Benny convinced that Dean will sacrifice everything for Castiel.
Despite his 6'4" frame, Sam looked so small in the plastic white folding chair. It seemed like her husband had changed in the blink of an eye. His skin was pale and dry. He'd lost weight, which was something he could not really afford to do. She couldn't even remember the last time she'd seem him smile.
There was love in Dean's eyes.
"Dean? What's wrong?" Castiel whispered, setting down the plate of Christmas cookies he'd been filling.
I just love being able to say that!!
Benny considered whether or not he could reciprocate those feelings. He'd never been into a man before. It was new and curious.
It was best for kids. His wife never gave it to him when he was sick. But it wasn't like Benny could run to the local Piggly Wiggly. This would just have to work.
As they walked down the aisle, Dean recalled the night they'd met once again. Dean had thought that Castiel was an honest to God angel on earth. üëºHe was so kind and purely good, and his eyes were as blue as the heavens.
Thank you all so so much!! üòªüòªüòª
"Dean! Stop!"
Lips still pressed together, Dean pushed Castiel on his back on the bed. Stealing quick breaths in between kisses, Dean climbed on top of Cass. When their lips parted for Dean to get some air, Cass grinned the sweetest, most satisfied smile. His big blue eyes were sparkling with love. Even though he did not have to breathe, his chest was heaving, too.
I hope everyone has a blessed Easter! üê∞
When that happened, it had to end. Dean never had any intention of breaking up with Castiel. The thought had never even entered his mind. Dean loved Castiel more than anything else in the world. There was no way he was going to live without him. Even if he didn't have a great marriage with Cass, Dean did not love Anna. He would never pursue a relationship with her.
Sam gazed at her with those woeful puppy dog eyes of his. The look wounded her, and she recoiled a little. Of course, he knew that she hadn't meant to be so cold and snarky towards him, not about this. Ruby was having a very difficult time with this baby. The doctors expected her to wind up on IV nutrition due to her severe nausea and weight loss. And, to be fair, she'd requested that he move the box off of the coffee table three days ago.
Even in some crazy alternate universe where Sam would want to cheat on Ruby (which would never happen), he could never go through with it. The what ifs would eat at him. The affair wouldn't even be the worth headache it caused.
On the other side of the wall, back pressed up against the door, Sam whispered, "'525, 600 minutes, 525, 000 moments so dear, 525, 600 minutes, 525, 000 seasons of love.'"
Sam's anger grew right alongside Dean's stubborn resolve. "Do you really think this is what Cass would want? For you to get the lethal injection?" Dean winced. "If Cass were here, he would want you to keep on fighting!!"
Because he
"I take it you didn't like the ride I sent you on," Gabriel teased.
In the treatment room, doctors and nurses pushed Castiel aside as they shined lights in Dean's eyes, pressed on injured spots and asked him even more questions than Castiel had in the car. It was agony to Castiel to be forced to separate from Dean, even if it was for his own good. Each time the staff members shoved Castiel back, Dean moved his battered body around to try to find Castiel again. Once he did, another nurse would block their view, and he would have to maneuver himself all over again.
Then, Dean felt a warm hand on his shoulder. All of his fears disappeared as the hand pulled him further from the chains of the past and closer to the freedom of the future. Dean curled his body into the arms of his savior and waited in breathless anticipation for the moment he'd dreamed of for so so long. Joy danced in his heart when he heard the voice he'd missed more than he could ever articulate.
Blindness.
His eyes blinked rapidly. His heart was beating out of his chest. His head spun in every direction as he tried to make sense of what was going on.
Castiel shakes his head. "Dean would die before he let anything happen to either one of us."
They both jumped as the one phone they owned shrilled to life the wood nymphs chittering in the woods in distaste. Castiel dug the phone from the backpack and answered it with a clipped, ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù
Dean leaned down catching Castiel‚Äôs open mouth in a passionate kiss. Dean‚Äôs hands traveled all over Castiel‚Äôs body exploring everything that made up his bond mate. Castiel arched into the touch huffing out pleas for more and Dean wasn‚Äôt going to deny him anything. No he would give Castiel whatever he wanted no matter the cost.
The man repeated that over and over. Dean snarled the candles flickering out, and his eyes flashing red for the first time in months, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt have him back!‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat do you want, Gabriel?‚Äù Castiel asked the alpha sharing a look with Meg. The last time they‚Äôd heard from Gabriel it‚Äôd been when Castiel had been released from the psych ward telling them he‚Äôd paid for everything and then some getting them new bikes and extra cash.
‚ÄúThis is me yanking
‚ÄúI know,‚Äù Dean whispered and turned away his body cracking and changing as he fell onto all fours a gorgeous blond wolf taking off into the woods and all Castiel could do was sit there and watch silently. He didn‚Äôt know what to do. It was becoming nightfall by the time he moved a restlessness settling into his skin. Tomorrow was the full moon and he could already feel the itch of it as he hiked his way back to the Winchester‚Äôs home.
"Anna? I would never..."
You will never
Dean's eyes widen in horror as the leviathan prepares to feast on Castiel. His chest is heaving. It's like he wants to cry, but he's in the middle of something so terrifying and he just can't shed any tears yet.
It was not that he wasn't afraid of what was to come. Dean was terrified of receiving the lethal injection. But, the truth was, he'd died right alongside Castiel on that stormy summer night. Now, after the hacks shot their venom into him and the physical pain passed, his suffering would end. If Castiel was right about Heaven, then Dean would be reunited with his love in a matter of minutes. If by some unlikely chance Castiel was wrong, then at least Dean would not have to feel the unbearable grief of his loss and mistakes day in and day out. Either way, Dean would finally be free.
Idea that
As Anna returned to her seat, the onlookers shot dirty looks at her. In Sam's opinion, her statement might have done more good for Dean than bad. After all, not many people would feel tremendous sympathy towards the grieving sister who slept with the victim's husband. Rational people wouldn't be likely to heed her call for blood.
And that damn
"I disrespected my husband. I shamed my family. But worst of all, I betrayed Castiel. And if anyone in the world did not deserve to be hurt like this, it was Castiel. I'm so sorry for what I've done. I have felt terrible about it for years. But Dean has never shown any regret for his actions. He's a dirty dog, and, for what he did to my brother, he should be put down just like a dog."
"Are you okay, Dean?" Castiel asked.
his angel in a trench coat, aimed a blade at Alistair, and gave Dean some much needed hope. Then, to Dean's horror, another angel blade protruded from Castiel's belly, and white light glowed in his mouth and eyes.
There's a pinch of sadness in his words. His love for Dean really does trump all of his other concerns. Benny can't help melting at it. Damn this angel! Much as Benny wants to, he just can't hate Castiel. He still dislikes him. That's natural. But, if he were not Dean's true mate, Benny could see himself befriending Castiel.
Doctors and nurses and protocol be damned, Castiel raced over to Dean's bedside. He wasn't sure how he could help, but that wasn't going to stop him. Something about Castiel's presence calmed Dean in an instant. As he relaxed, the nurses and doctors loosened their grips on him. The whole situation deescalated in the few seconds it took Castiel and Dean to reunite.
Dean gets too upset to even finish his statement. Benny can feel his fangs scratching against his gums. Of course he knows he cannot harm an angel. He'll be zapped into oblivion before he comes within a foot of the seraph.
At some point, Gabriel grabbed a hold of Dean's shoulder and asked him to come to the bar. The boys were watching the Dallas game and wanted him to join. Stealing one last glance at Anna, Dean followed his new brother-in-law to check the football scores.
For the first time in his life, Dean Winchester felt whole. He felt a strength inside of himself that he had never known before. He felt complete. For once in his life, he felt like happiness was within his reach.
One night, they camp beside a stream. Dean has enjoyed a decent meal of fresh caught fish and cool, clean water. With a full belly, Dean has fallen asleep in Castiel's arm. Considering the circumstances, he is as content as a man can be. Castiel wears a soft smile of solace as he massages Dean's scalp. Benny is using his knife to sharpen a stick into a stake. They don't really need another weapon, but he can't just sit there and watch Dean and Castiel spoon. It will eat him alive if he does.
From his experience under Gabriel's influence, Dean had learned a few very important things. First, he could not live without Castiel. Second, he had a lot to be grateful for, as clich√© as it sounded. But the most vital fact of life that he'd discovered was this: it would be his own insecurities that would lead to his undoing. If he didn't exorcise his own personal demons, they would ravage him and his family.
Sam's thoughts on Dean's affair with Anna.
Dean stretched and pulled himself up off of the couch. Castiel's heart sunk like a ship as he watched Dean disappear into his room without even acknowledging what had just transpired between them. It was as if it had never even happened. His stomach twisted in knots.
Planning the wedding had brought Castiel so much joy. It didn't give him much time, but he'd wanted a Christmas wedding. With limited time and finances, he had worked real wonders. The church and the reception hall were decorated with garlands, poinsettias, Holly and mistletoe. Live Christmas trees filled the air with the scent of balsam and cedar. Snowflakes danced from the ceilings. Santa's and snowmen waved as the guests arrived. Castiel had created a true winter wonderland.
"No, Cass, we are not watching West Side Story!" Dean protested.
"Cass! You're not making any sense!" Dean answered.
To top it all off, Castiel won't even be able to escape with them. It's a human portal. It won't work for him. This is all just a waste of time. But when Benny brings it up, it just starts a fight. Not with Castiel though, oddly enough he does not disagree with Benny. It's Dean that can't get the simple facts through his hard head.
'No one's ever done anything like this for me before.'
Now, with the angel turned to ash and Dean nursing the world's worst broken heart, Sam wished that everything had been different. He wished that he had fought with Cass again the night they watched Rent. He wished that he hadn't heard Cass resign himself to yet another rejection.
Castiel was gone. Just like Angel. But at least Collins had had the courage to confess his true feelings to Angel before he died. Dean had just been a coward.
Dean froze. Their gazes locked. Castiel's heart thudded as he watched tears spill out of Dean's soft green eyes. On the day they met, Castiel had told Dean that his eyes were the color of the Earth, God's most incredible creation. Even as his body was giving out, Castiel still believed what he'd said all those years ago.
I hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving!!
An uptempo hip hop song played through the speakers. Women bopped on the dance floor as men cheered. As if demanding all eyes be on her, Anna gyrated to the beat in that skimpy black dress of hers, her red hair swaying in such a seductive way.
At him like
"Who I am???" Dean demanded.
Dean jerked his hand away and rolled his eyes.
'You know I will.'
Dean says goodbye to Castiel.
As Sam started to sift through Dean's things, he couldn't help but think of the song "Seasons of Love" from Rent. This small box of meager belongings were the measure of Dean's last year on Earth. So were 'the truths that he learned, the times that he cried, the bridges he burned' and 'the way that he died.' Dean had cried, burned bridges and died within the past 525, 600 minutes. That was for sure. But Sam couldn't help but wonder about the truths part. Dean had gone to his grave without ever acknowledging what Castiel's death had taught him.
"Dean‚Ä¶"
'Please Dean. Do it for me.'
Ready? Why
Although Sam had manipulated Anna into downplaying the severity of their fights, it was still an uphill battle, and both brothers knew it. The prosecution had Jack as an eyewitness to the crime, as well as Naomi, Anael, Gabriel, Balthazar and Michael attesting to the abuse they witnessed their brother suffer. The physical evidence was overwhelming, from the unregistered gun to Castiel's blood on Dean's fists.
It was the way Dean carried himself that drew Benny in, though. They were so alike in so many ways. They were both strong, tough and quick witted. When they fought together, they moved as one. Neither of them had a back. Neither of them had a vulnerable place. The other was right there to keep him safe. Benny had never known that sort of unity with any one.
But, Dean wished to God that Cass was there to knock some sense into him. He'd never felt smaller and more confused in his life. Though he knew that he couldn't, he had never wanted to throw in the towel as bad as he did now.
A collective gasp echoed across the room. Castiel's brothers and sisters exchanged quiet hugs and grateful tears. Journalists snapped photos and entered notes into their journals and tablets.
Te Amo Dean!
(See the end of the chapter for
"Dean‚Ä¶"
Prayers for my #spnfamily during the quarantine. I feel blessed to have you guys in my life.
By the worst
'I've had worse.'
Two nights later, Dean started showing some signs of improvement. He was able to stay awake for a few hours at a time. Although they couldn't tell his temperature with any accuracy, there were times when he didn't radiate heat like a gas stove.
"I know I've screwed up a lot. I know I've pushed you away. I know you deserve so much better than me‚Ä¶ I know I should've told you a long time ago‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶"
"If they can't see how much I miss Cass, then that's their problem. It's not mine."
Sure, Castiel's brothers and sisters had freaked out when they saw his face. Gabriel and Balthazar had tried to convince him to go to the police, and they'd even offered to welcome Castiel and Jack into their homes. Michael and Raphael had threatened to give Dean a taste of his own medicine. Naomi and Anna had suggested he see a doctor. But none of them knew the truth. Dean was the best husband in the world. He just lost his temper sometimes, was all. Everything was fine.
Ordinarily, Sam and Dean would shoot the breeze for a while. It was their way of pretending that things were somewhat normal. But Sam was all business now. He could not stand this place another minute. After the ordeal of the guilty verdict, Sam wanted nothing more than to watch the Dallas game and split a six pack and a cold pizza with Ruby.

The song ended, and Castiel chickened out. He couldn't stand the thought of upsetting Dean. Nothing mattered more to him than his friendship with Dean. Nothing.
"I mean I'm not going to do anything to put Dean in danger," the angel asserts.
The darkness,
'What's wrong, Dean?'
' If only I had not acted like such a jerk to Cass about that damn play,' Dean thought.
"C'mon, I'll stitch you up."
Have been fine.
Many long nights had come and gone since Sam had last enjoyed a full night's sleep. Ruby had called Sam's doctor, who'd prescribed him some medication. But he hadn't taken it. He wanted to suffer through this. He felt that he'd let everybody down. Much as he hated to admit it, he had a self deprecating, masochistic streak that could rival his brother's.
It was almost as if his eyes were not open at all.
Maybe then
Dean lifted the sheet just a little. People always said the dead looked like they were sleeping and would wake up at any time. But Castiel didn't sleep. He would never wake up again. Never again would he gaze at Dean with those innocent little eyes that were as blue as the sky on Christmas morning, as blue as the ocean on a clear summer night.
Me to come
Dean had been pacing the hall outside Cass's door for a half hour. The beers had been burning cold against his sweaty palms. The butterflies in his stomach were making him sick. He had to do it, but he just did not know how.
'Yes. They used to share clothes.'
"Cass?" Dean cried out. He pressed his ear to Castiel's heart and a hand to his mouth. The nothingness was as enormous as an elephant. "CASS?? CASTIEL!"
It shouldn't have happened in the first place. The human was only meant to be his ticket out of Purgatory, nothing more. Benny Lafitte was not supposed to fall for Dean Winchester.
"Cass asked me not to," Sam confessed. "He wanted you to be happy, and he didn't want you to be with him just because you felt bad. He wanted you to be with him because you loved him."
Never again would Castiel misunderstand a cultural reference. Never again would his goofiness humor Dean. Never again would Castiel tear down Dean's walls. Never again would Dean feel the security of being held in the arms of an angel.
Despite the judge's warning, a collective gasp rolled through the room like waves at the beach. Several members of Castiel's family thanked God. Journalists scribbled notes and cameras clicked. Right beside him, Sam buried his eyes in his hands and started to cry, his large body shaking with sorrow. Ruby reached over from her seat in the audience and placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder.
After everything that has happened to them, what happens when Cass wants to watch another musical with Dean?
"Cass? Is it really you?" Dean asked, praying to Chuck over and over that this was happening.
Cass was gone.
And then, a miracle.
"Nobody's perfect," Sam countered. "But there's nothing wrong with who you are."
Dean let out a sarcastic chortle. "No, I'm pretty damn far from it."
Your sweet sliver
Not the words I
"Thank you, Benny."
In Dean's daze, he was cognizant of Lucifer dragging his mother into Apocalypse World through the portal that Crowley's spell had sealed shut. Maybe he screamed for her, but sounds were hazy, too. He felt as if he were outside of his body. None of this was real. Nothing was real.
Because my wings
Castiel sighed, "If I had a dollar for every time I've heard that, I'd be a millionaire."
Destiel is canon!! I still love saying it!!
Benny would do anything for Dean, but he's sure as hell not going to die for the angel.
Happy Birthday to Justin in Heaven 11/6/88-10/5/16 I love and miss you always!!
A bright white light drew Dean forward. He couldn't help feeling a bit apprehensive as he approached it. It was a bridge he was frightened of crossing alone. Although he believed in Castiel's God of mercy and love, Dean was still having a hard time imagining that anyone could forgive the awful thing he'd done to Castiel.
MERRY CHRISTMAS!!
Dean glanced at the paper for a second, then shook his head and returned the items to his brother. "No."
'"I know,'" Castiel admits.
Dean asked where they were taking him. Castiel responded that they were almost at the hospital. In his arms Castiel could feel Dean go rigid.
Not to mention, if he'd had his choice of lovers, Dean would have picked the much more beautiful Anael. But Anael was not an option. Anael glared at him or laughed in a mocking way when he attempted to gauge his chances with her. She was loyal to Castiel with all her heart, and she would never do anything to hurt him or shame herself. Not like Anna was willing to do.
In all her life, she'd never had a problem with claustrophobia. But the tiny viewing room seemed to be shrinking as more people entered. Castiel's brothers and sisters glared at her and Sam as they took their seats. They could not forgive Sam for defending his brother.
Benny coaxed the tea into Dean. It was a fight. What didn't this guy make difficult? It seemed to him like humans were always getting in their own way. But Dean was a harder case than most.
Thank you so much for reading!!
Dean would start right then, right there.
My heart is made
I hope you guys like the twist!! I love Gabriel/Trickster and am a low key Sabriel shipper lol.
In joy, Castiel hugged the man and peppered him with questions. 'What's your name? Where are you from? Why were you fighting with Alastair?'
Dean retrieved one of his guns from its place near the fireplace and aimed it at Castiel's head. Staring with intensity at his lover, Castiel placed a frail hand on Dean's wrist. It shouldn't have been anywhere near enough to hinder an assault, but it gave Dean pause.
Gabriel chortled, "Yeah! I know you won't! Now!"
Can never
Castiel squinted his eyes in that sweet way he did when he was confused. "What's wrong?"
Meant to be
"Cass," Dean whispered, wincing with pain. "Remember the hunt against Ramiel, when he speared Cass with the Michael Lance? Cass said he loved me. I never told him."
KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!
Dean had decided to chicken out. As he'd turned towards his own bedroom, a memory assaulted him: Dean yelping as the needle pierced his chest, and Billie tormenting him by sending him back to life with that damned broken heart of his. Never in his life had he felt so low as to break his promise to Sam and tell the Angel of Death that it was okay if she took him. All that, because he'd lost Cass.
"NO!"
' No. But we knew.'
Cannot wash
I guess I should have said this in the beginning lol but I don't own Supernatural, Rent or West Side Story. The lyrics I "borrowed" need to be credited to Jonathan Larson for Rent and I think Stephen Sondheim for West Side Story.
"Yeah, dumbass, about how you need to take damn good care of my brother‚Ä¶"
Wearing the most callous scowl on his handsome face, Michael sat down in the witness box. He commanded Dean's attention with his vengeful stare. Castiel always used to say that there were very eerie similarities between Dean and Michael: the color of their short hair, the seriousness of their stares, the ferocity of their attitudes. Since Dean and Michael never got along, neither of them liked hearing that. But, listening to Michael speak, and watching his defensive body language, Dean had to concede the fact that they were very much alike, albeit much too little, much too late.
Billie would not let Dean stay dead in "Advanced Thanatology." Now he has no choice but to figure out how to live without Castiel.
Sam was not willing to feign normalcy any longer, not if it meant that he could explode the same way Dean had. Ruby and the children were everything to him. And, what was the point in prolonging the inevitable?
Knows how to
"You're a brilliant hunter. You're a good friend. You're the best big brother in the world," Sam told him. Dean's eyes softened as he absorbed his brother's words. "You're a good son. You're a good cook, and a great mechanic. You're a brave man, a strong man." Sam took a deep breath. "You are a man who was fortunate enough to have found his soulmate."
Dean paced around the table, touching the sheet every so often. There was so much that he wanted to say, but he could not form any words. How could he even begin to articulate how much Cass meant to him, how much he would miss him? Every time he blinked, he saw Castiel's form exploding out of his vessel. Every time he breathed, he felt a sharp pain in his heart.
It took several days of force feeding Dean catnip tea and any scrap of food he could find. But at last Benny nursed Dean back to health. Even though he was happy to have his friend back on his feet, Benny couldn't help feeling a little sad. He would miss the warmth of human flesh against his icy skin something terrible. He was sure that what had transpired between them would be a one time thing. Nothing more would come of it.
Dean's heart shattered into a million pieces as he scooped Castiel into his arms and pressed him to his chest. He buried his head into Castiel's shoulder and allowed his tears to fall with complete freedom. Across the room, he could hear Jack crying as well. But the boy did not approach him, and he was thankful for that. In this moment, Dean could think of nothing else but Castiel.
"Dean."
Dean closed his eyes and leaned closer to his new friend. Castiel whispered a prayer as the nurse stuck the needle under Dean's skin. The bones in Castiel's fingers creaked as Dean's death grip tightened with each second that passed until the nurse connected with the vein in his hand. It surprised Castiel that Dean was tough enough to endure a beating from the evil Alastair without complaint and yet be so afraid of a needle. It was endearing. Dean had a lot of layers to him, and Castiel hoped he would someday unravel them.
"No," Dean whimpered. "Cass! Please. Don't leave me."
"You don't love him," Jo repeated. "We belong together."
Unable to catch his breath, Dean sat up and buried his face in his hands. His whole body shook with fear and emotion. Sam placed a hand on his shoulder, wishing with all his heart that, somehow, Castiel would appear and make everything better.
Now, Dean felt like this song was all he had left of his angel, and he wished to Chuck that he could take back every mean thing he'd ever said to Cass, particularly about Rent. But he couldn't.
(See the end of the chapter for
Words I shot
Anyone
Castiel shakes his head. "I love Dean more than anything in all of creation! I could never hurt him!"
But Benny is just so angry. This ragged mess of a fallen angel is who Dean chooses to love. Castiel does not deserve Dean. Dean spent months searching for Castiel, almost losing his own life in the process. Castiel abandoned Dean in one of the most dangerous places in all of God's creation. Castiel does not deserve Dean.
Ruby interrupted, "... Cass, Honey, Sam never went out with Dean tonight." Castiel gasped. "Sam has the flu. That's why I'm up at this God awful hour; I'm trying to bring his fever down."
After their hunt in Dodge City, and their successful take down of the Dave Matter ghoul, Dean promised himself (and yes, a very nosy Sam) that he would go through with it. He had to. During the hunt, when they went to talk to the Sheriff, Castiel tried so hard to be a believable cowboy. He was wearing that silly hat, and he introduced himself as 'Agent Val Kilmer.' He was so adorable.
Cass moved towards him with the DVD in his hand. And Dean didn't know what happened. Maybe it was just the way the ever ominous fluorescent lighting hit the angel, or an expression that crossed his handsome face. Whatever the cause, Dean's mind brought him back to the cottage in Washington and he could see the damned light glowing from Cass's knife wound and hear Lucifer's vile chuckling and Dean's own horrified screams. And he would never ever forget the sight of Cass's broken black wings outstretched above his still, lifeless body.
But Cass never forgot about Rent. He longed to hear the beautiful music again. He wanted to find out why the artists were singing about moving out of New York City.
"CASS! CASS! CASS!"
To Castiel's surprise, this small show of support and affection was not to put his friend at ease.
It closed
Their time together matters so much to Benny. How can it be that it doesn't mean as much to Dean? Now Benny isn't sure that's even a fair assessment. Dean has not done anything to make Benny feel unimportant. Dean hasn't done anything at all, to be honest.
Dean Winchester rolled his eyes. "Don't start."
Sam had never been more confused in all his life. Because, with all his heart and soul, he knew that Dean loved Castiel, Sam could not understand how Dean could sleep with Anna. In a twisted way, the murder made more sense than the affair. He killed him because his fear of living without him overtook him. But why would he hook up with Anna?
In her quiet voice, Anna recited, "I was Castiel's big sister. He was always coming to me for advice. Most of the time, I wouldn't tell him exactly what I thought. I would try to guide him, but, ultimately, the decision would be his. I wish to God I would have told him to stay away from Dean Winchester, like our brothers did.
Castiel was perfect.
Sam worried that, without Castiel, Dean would never be the same. This grief would follow him around like his shadow. It would shape every decision he made. It would inhibit his ability to love and trust others. Of course, Sam had faith in the brave, kind, fiercely loyal man who had raised him. This wouldn't jade him. But it would influence every aspect of his life, and Sam hoped that Dean would think with his head and not his broken heart.
But there was more to it than that. Sam wanted to be in his right mind for this. Because of his failure, he felt that he owed Dean his full focus. Ruby did not blame him for the defeat. Dean didn't either. There was nothing more Sam could have done to change the outcome of the trial. Nonetheless, she understood his desire to keep a level head.
He waited for Castiel to say 'I promise I won't', but the words never came.
Then I would have
Overcome with emotion then, Dean chucked his bottle across the room. It smashed against the wall, breaking into a hundred little pieces. Beer puddled on the floor; the odor wafted up around the room. Sam frowned, his eyebrows tilting down in concern.
"You don't love him," she insisted, shaking her head and making her long sandy hair sway.
Was cheap sex worth risking his relationship with Castiel? Sam could not fathom it. Before Sam married Ruby, Dean used to run Sam about not getting enough action. But Sam valued sex. He couldn't mess around with someone he didn't care about. The sex had to mean something.
Sam had always known that. For so long he had prayed for some of Dean's fire. But he could never ignite that same flame in himself. It used to bother him that he could not share such a strong bond with his brother such as the one the Shirley family enjoyed because of how unlike he and Dean were.
Alas, Sam could not deceive Dean, not about this. Not about Castiel. Dean could always tell when he was lying. Even if he said what he wanted so much to say, Dean would never allow himself to believe it, anyway. Maybe it helped him in some way to hear people verbalize it, but he wouldn't let himself take it to heart. His pride and unnatural sense of responsibility made certain of that.
He could bear
I hope you like this one too!! üòª
It hit Benny then. Dean would not survive the night. The realization was a blade to the vampire's throat.
Castiel placed his hand on Dean's shoulder. Although he kept a straight face, on the inside Castiel was swooning at how strong Dean was, how broad and firm his shoulders were. Thank God Gabriel and Balthazar were watching TV in the waiting room. If they had been there to see this, Castiel's cat would have been out of the proverbial bag. üê±
You want to hear.
Maybe Benny will watch out for Castiel along the way as well. He's off his rocker, and he's a walking monster magnet. Worst of all, Dean's heart belongs to him. But Castiel is good and selfless and funny as hell. If they didn't love the same human, Benny thinks he might even be friends with that silly angel someday.
"What do you mean by that?" Benny presses.
If Sam hadn't been waiting to hug Castiel, Dean would never have let him go. Now that he knew what it felt like to lose him, he understood what a blessing he had and how he'd been taking him for granted for all of these years. Now, he knew so much better, and he would not make the same mistakes again.
