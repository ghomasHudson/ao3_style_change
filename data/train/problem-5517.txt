Time marches on. The lives of the boys pass through the changing of the seasons, but a deadline is fast approaching. What will Tony do when he realizes that he is about to lose everything? Destiny is about to cut the ties that bind.
But Steve was stubborn. He loved Bucky and knew that he always would, ‘til the end of the line. His best friend. His lover.
“Tony, you didn’t have to take us anywhere.” Steve said. “We woulda been happy just stayin’ in and making dinner.”
They would talk with him, asking questions about his favorite things. Steve had asked about his favorite memories growing up and what his favorite foods had been. Bucky had asked more diverse questions. Ranging from: Had he ever flown in a plane? To: Had he ever been in love? That last question had made Tony want to smother himself with his pillow.
Steve took a steadying breath, then another. Just describe what he wanted. He could that. “I want to know what it feels like to have you focus on me. You’re so smart and strong and confident, and I…I thought about you holding me down and
Bucky’s eyes had grown wet, the relief of finally understanding why he felt this way and being validated for it was something he’d wanted for so long. “Thank you,” he said thickly, “for explaining that to me.”
Tony struggled to obey. He worked to keep his tongue firm enough so that Steve could rub against him just right, but Bucky was currently driving him insane. As Steve lazily rode his face, Bucky was teasing him mercilessly, mostly sticking to the outer edges of where Tony really wanted him. When he would finally pay attention to his hole, it was all too brief for Tony.
The first thing Tony noticed besides the darkness was that he was lying on the ground. The second thing he noticed was that it was dark because his eyes were closed. The third thing he noticed was that he wanted to vomit.
Thor’s head bowed as he closed his eyes. Steve could hear him speaking quietly to himself, but he didn’t understand the words or their meaning. After a few moments, Steve could have almost sworn that he felt their joined hands begin to grow warmer, the tips of his fingers almost tingling from the heat.
Steve just hugged him tighter as JARVIS answered, “Sir has always prided himself in seeing the possibilities of what could be. He once said that when he looked at something, he saw more than its function. He saw what it was capable of becoming.”
“There are a couple that are similar.” Tony nodded, “There is definitely one that I want you to try since you love spaghetti so much.” They both perked up at this as Gianetta returned with their plates and wine. She opened the bottle and gently poured it into a decanter. “I’ll be back soon with your caponata.”
He wondered if Steve was experiencing another download of information too. Probably, he figured. After Dr. Banner’s explanation of what was happening to them and Thor’s big reveal, most of the team had went off to search for help, looking for that Strange guy or anyone else who might have some information about magic. He and Steve had been benched and were not allowed to leave the tower at the moment.
“Right on time.” The man was Michael Walsh. Tony had talked to him a few times over the last couple of months and made an agreement with him that for his help with this, Tony would build toys for his three children for Christmas. It was a good deal for both of them. “I just finished wrapping the gifts.”
Today, Tony had a meeting with Colonel Philips, and he was fully prepared for it to be tense and awkward. He wasn’t proven completely wrong upon their first conversation, but he knew that it definitely could have gone worse.
Tony struggled to quickly think of what to tell the man. He hadn’t prepared for this conversation to go this way, and a lot of his previous arguments were useless.
Tony looked at the earnest faces of the young men. Both waiting patiently for him to explain himself, but he couldn’t. He couldn’t…
The relief that had swept over Bucky had been immense, to the point where he’d had to sit down. As he’d asked questions, he couldn’t believe the things Steve was telling him, but under every shocking revelation about the doctors and Tony’s insistence that he was healthy enough to leave, and Steve telling how he was ending his contract with the hospital, Bucky had always returned to the thought that Tony was alright.
“I’d heard he was having trouble with a piece of his machinery from a neighbor who is a technician, but he seemed to think the problem was beyond repair.” The older man’s eyes were scrutinizing him again.
“Bucky told us not to avoid each other just because he’s gone.” Tony reminded him. He was done with dancing around the Bucky shaped hole between them. “Our sweet love knows us too well, baby. These past few days have been hard enough, and I don’t want this to be what our relationship is like without him,” he finished honestly. Tony grabbed Steve’s hand and gently squeezed. “We’re closer than this.”
Tony grabbed a condom and tore open the packet. He rolled it on and applied some more lubricant before he lined himself up. He looked up at his boys. Bucky was breathing heavily, but he lifted to his hands as he felt the head of Tony’s cock brush his rim. Steve had stopped touching himself as was simply staring at Tony with a look of pure lust.
Tony looked into Steve’s eyes and watched the look that passed over Steve’s face as he’d said that. His features held defiance and challenge, but Tony knew it was being used to cover a lot of the pain caused by Bucky’s absence and fear of being left behind. Tony knows because he’d felt the same pain and fear these past few days. He knew what Steve was asking without him having to actually say it. He knew what Steve wanted, what he needed.
He hadn’t wanted to startle Bucky and trigger his fighting instincts as he stopped at the doorway, but Bucky must have sensed him anyway. He watched the distraught brunet spin around in a defensive stance. Wild, tear filled eyes met his, and he heard the uncertainty in his own voice as he softly called out, “Bucky?”
Bucky was out on the dance floor with his date. Both of them seemed to be having a great time as they danced and spun. Each couple seeming to complement each other perfectly; the dancers, the mechanics, and the artists. Steve looked like he was having the time of his life.
“That much is obvious,” Jacobson huffed as he looked to the ceiling. “The guy wins a street fight, and they make him a performer.” He looked back to Steve. “You do understand why you’re here, right?”
“That’s fucking priceless!” Bucky gasped. “We gave them polite kisses goodnight, and they go up to find you makin’ time with their roomie!”
The guys each departed once they’d reached their assigned floors, all of them agreeing on a time to meet in the lobby later so they could walk to the pub together. Tony and Bucky were the last to reach theirs since it was almost at the top of the building. Tony used the key and opened the door to a huge living area that spread into a small kitchen and had several doors connecting to it. So, this was what a suite looked like, Bucky thought before Tony closed the door behind him and dropped their bags.
“So that’s why you’re here?” Howard nearly sneered, “To share your common sense with me? Well, I’ve got news for you, Anthony. That and our last name will be the only thing we’ll share. You are merely a consultant and will never get credit for Project Rebirth. So go ahead and give me all the common advice you want.”
“Thank you, my friends,” Francesco said thickly. “I am truly lucky to be here and know such good people. Not everyone is happy with my home country right now. Some days it is difficult.”
“They’re thirty miles behind the lines,” Phillips harshly told him, “through some of the most heavily fortified territory in Europe. We’d lose more men than we’d save, but I don’t expect you to understand that because you’re a chorus girl.”
Also for any history buffs out there, yes Steve would know about traffic lights. They were primitive and manually operated by police officers working together at the major intersections of large cities, but they did exist. Honestly, the research I do for two sentences of dialogue.
Steve had only gone a handful of times after he’d been found nearly three years ago. He hadn’t liked the sessions or the thought of them. Talking to some stranger that was paid to listen to your problems had not appealed to Steve. In his defense Steve had grown up with a mistrust of psychiatric anything and the people who worked in that field. He’d grown up knowing that it was best to keep your secrets to yourself.
The rest of the future Commandos were also staying here with Steve’s permission, but they were currently getting food at the mess tent. Dugan had promised to bring something back for Tony and Bucky since the others agreed that their Sergeant should be resting.
He didn’t want Tony to push aside his issues. Steve wanted Tony to use him as he worked through them. The same way he wanted to use Tony dominating him to work through what he’d been feeling. He needed to feel something other than the weight of Bucky’s absence. He needed to remind himself that he wasn’t useless like the army and everyone else kept telling him he was. He needed to let go and just focus on physical sensation. He needed Tony.
“To you?” Bucky and Steve both asked together, and something warmed a little in his chest as he remembered many other instances of them speaking simultaneously.
Bucky shouldn’t. He knew if he had an ounce of decency he would pull away and tell Steve that he could only be his friend. He couldn’t, though, and when he remembered what it was like to be with Steve and Tony, and how they made him feel, he was selfish enough to want that again.
Bucky blushed deeply at the reminder. “It’s Ok,” He murmured and admitted “I, uh, I actually liked it.”
James nodded, though he was still wearing that signature scowl. Tony had seen pictures from the war. He knew the man before him used to smile so easy. He’d been dashing, and it had shone through grainy black and white photos and newsreels. Tony wondered if he ever smiled anymore. Tony hoped he could see that one day.
Steve looked at him. “We already knew he’d fought in the past. He told us that the second day we met him, how he was captured. Then, he told us more the night he had that nightmare.”
It was alright, he supposed. The windows were pretty, and the candles were nice. The fact that he didn’t seem to know when to stand hadn’t seemed to bother anyone. And even though he understood the Latin the priest was speaking, he didn’t know when or how to respond, but he was trying. This was important to Steve, and for him, Tony would try. Bucky had come along as well. He’d obviously been raised in the church, even if he hadn’t attended a Sunday’s mass since Tony had arrived. He wasn’t lost or uncomfortable like Tony was.
“I was a runaway that joined the circus.” Clint volunteered, adding to the conversation. “Once I was grown and had left with a dangerous set of archery skills, I got into some trouble before S.H.I.E.L.D. found me, and I became their spy/assassin. I’ve been on my own most of my life. This place with you guys is…well, it’s a hell of a lot better than anything I ever thought I’d get to have. Fuck, I can’t even remember the last thing I had to pay for, and I’ve got teammates I can trust and a hot boyfriend. Not bad for a circus freak reject.”
He’d promised Tony and Steve that he would come back. Tony had been right; it was a foolish promise.
Talking was something Tony was good at. He could usually talk circles around anyone, but as he stood in front of her, Tony measured every word spoken.
Bucky shook his head. “If I volunteer now, I’ll be able to get into training programs to become an officer. I can choose to enlist in the branch I want to serve in. I really don’t want to risk being in the navy or the air force. I get seasick, and the thought of flying kinda scares me cuz I really don’t like heights, not like that anyway. Most of my nightmares are of me falling. It’s probably best if I join the army and stay on the ground,” he tried to joke, but his smile looked pained.
When he spoke again, the man's voice was uncharacteristically tired. “We need more victories like this one. We’ve been losing more men than we can afford. Hitler’s got most of Europe in a vice grip, but we’re making slow progress in breaking through. The real threat, however,” the man turned to look at Tony, “is HYDRA. The Nazis are mostly run on fear and propaganda. Men who don’t believe in the cause they’re made to fight for will lose. Period. But HYDRA isn’t a cause, it’s a cult. It is a way of life and a fundamental belief of everyone under Schmidt’s control. That’s what makes him so dangerous. Now he’s got technology our best minds can barely understand to help him on his way.”
Finally the other man said, “I believe I can do something for you, but first, you must answer one question.”
“Buy a paper, Mister?” The young boy asked him as Tony tried not to have a panic attack out here on the street.
Their progress was slow, too slow with the wounded and half-starved men that made up their ranks. Thankfully, Bucky’s wounds so far had been minor and mostly superficial. He’d been trying his best to make sure the injured had their wounds cleaned as much as their situation allowed. They’d taken very brief stops where they risked a fire to heat water for cleaning wounds and bandages. Despite his efforts some had died anyway.
“Much older than that?” Tony finished for him. “That’s fair. I partied for the better part of two decades, and the last few years have brought some wear and tear.”
After Steve had admitted that he’d want to top Tony, and they’d continue to discuss the things they all liked, Tony had given Steve several do’s and likes that cranked his arousal. He wondered how far Steve would take it. He hoped pretty far. The hair pulling was just the beginning, and Tony found himself increasingly ready to be used and ordered around. He followed Steve’s orders on the battlefield, why not the bedroom?
He looked closely at Tony. “I do not wish to know about my future as I agree with you that things should not be changed, but am I right in guessing that you know more about me than you have pretended?”
Steve’s eyes never left his as he moved over them, his hips rocking all of them in smooth unhurried thrusts. Bucky could see his muscles rippling every time he buried himself into the man between them, pushing the dick inside Bucky even farther. They were both fucking him.
Or maybe he was fucked up enough to get off on the thought of Bucky naked and sweating, talking dirty in that woman’s ear as he prepared to drive himself into her with Steve so close Tony could easily grab him and grind himself against the younger man, relieving this ache until he came. FUCK
He didn’t know how long it took for him to stop yelling. He’d been crazed, cursing and hitting Steve when he’d approached him, but the blonde just took it until he’d finally wrapped his arms around Bucky in an embrace. Bucky started screaming then, even as he’d wilted in Steve’s arms. He’d screamed at everyone and no one. He’d raged at his life that was taken, against Hydra and against the Avengers who were stupid enough to take him in. He’d screamed himself hoarse, and Steve had never spoken or pulled away or tried to quiet him.
“I’m here with Cap,” Tony had told him. “Someone had to have his back after Rebirth, and he was forgotten about.”
It shouldn’t be important. If Tony didn’t want to discuss his feelings at certain times, he shouldn’t have to. It’s not like he didn’t express himself and communicate to Bucky and Steve because he did. Bucky is almost positive that Tony has never been so real and vulnerable with anyone as he is with them. There is still that little bit that he holds back, though. Thoughts and emotions he hides from them. No, it shouldn’t be important, but it was.
Steve shook his head. “No, you guys get some sleep. I’m gonna take watch over this group. I’ll wake you when it’s time to go.”
Tony didn’t blame James for his actions as the Winter Soldier, many of which were gruesome and cold blooded, because it truly wasn’t his fault. Tony had found enough of the leaked information to know what the guy had been through. Subsequently, Tony hadn't eaten for three days after seeing those files.
Bucky shrugged. “I never saw him perform. It was before the war, but he was very strong. He was good friend,” Bucky finished lamely as he silently missed his comrade.
Bucky walked down the sidewalk on his way to meet Tony where his partner was finishing a small job fixing the lighting of a nearby bar. Tony had said that it wouldn’t take him long, and Bucky could pick him up so that they could walk home together. Steve was supposed to be meeting them, too. He had gone to drop off one of his paintings that morning and was supposed to catch a movie while he waited for Bucky and Tony to be done for the day.
Tony shrugged. “I’ll just end the war.” He had privatized world peace once already, he could do it again if Steve wanted. History be damned. “If it gets me more time with you, I’ll start on it in the morning.”
Tony gulped. That was a less than passive suggestion. Tony should politely decline. He was going to, but then he thought of  Steve and the rumors he worried about. Tony probably should be seen out with a woman. He just wouldn’t have thought one this
Steve blushed as Tony tugged on his hand walking backwards to the bedroom while curling a finger with his other hand, motioning for Bucky to follow.
Steve wished he could drink the stuff like Tony did. He hated the mornings. His back always ached when he got up because of his curved spine. His joints took time to loosen up when he’d start his day, and because it was winter, Steve knew that if he went outside his lungs would have trouble with the cold, frosty air.
. A little sore, yes, but not enough to warrant all of this!” To prove his point, he began to flop up and down on the bed, which was infinitely more difficult than it should have been because of his casts and their elevated positions.
Tony’s thighs came to rest against his ass, and Steve felt his lover’s hands tighten on his hips. Tony didn’t wait long before his cock began to pull out. The moment the head tugged on Steve’s opening, Tony pushed back in a little harder than before. Steve groaned.
He’d watched them play-climb over the rubble, but the laughter was missing. They played because they were kids, and that’s what they did, but the joy was gone. He wondered how many had been orphaned. He wondered where they slept since most of the buildings didn’t look safe to be in. He wondered if they even remembered life before this. The war here had been going on for years, after all, for most of their lives.
He felt a presence in the room with him and spun defensively to see Steve standing at the doorway, looking at him with worry etched into his face. Bucky now knew why he hated to see that worry.
Bucky, take him and hold him and cherish him in all the ways he deserved. Bucky deserved the world; he always had. Steve didn’t realize that he could love Tony more than he already did in his new memories, but he was wrong. Tony had done this. He’d given Bucky new memories, ones that Hydra had never touched, even if this was all by accident.
“Only for me, Stevie?” And Bucky groaned at that thought. “You’re right. She doesn’t get to have this. None of them gals do. This is mine. To touch. To lick. To suck. I’m always so good for you, aren’t I?. I take you so well. You want my mouth, doll? Please let me taste you.”
“Christ, what I wouldn’t give for beer,” Dum Dum muttered. “It wouldn’t have to be a good beer, just any beer.”
Bucky smiled at the new bottle of cologne and hair pomade, both his favorite brands, along with the new hat Tony had gotten him because that man looked damn fine wearing one. Tony also got him a new lunch pail and work boots for “when you get your new job” Tony told him because he wanted Bucky to know that he had faith in him.
Bucky himself had already told Steve that he didn’t remember much about them. He also told him that what he did remember was like a shadow of someone else’s life.
“Unh,” James answered as he started unbuttoning his dirty, sweat-soaked work shirt. He slipped off his suspenders from his shoulders. They fell, hanging from his waist and brushing past his knees. Peeling the shirt off, he continued, “You won’t believe the day I had, Stevie.  Almost got crushed when a crate bigger than our couch popped it’s chain. Then, I had to pick up the wreckage. Thought Old Man Talbot was gonna use it as an excuse to fire me.”
In fact, he didn’t care about a lot of things anymore. Steve and Bucky were his only concern. Everyone else felt…distant? Removed? He didn’t really know how to describe it. Even the good friends he’d made in the past three years had somehow lost his consideration. He cared, but not as much as he should, as much as he once did. It felt like a piece of him had changed or…or died. It hadn’t been noticeable at first, but the feeling had grown over the past few weeks. Ever since he’d come home from the hospital, really.
OK, just breathe, loyal readers. Breathe. You are probably wondering "what the fuck!?" This was one of the reasons I debated on visiting the future. It all would have been explained at the end without me looking like a monster. Just remember that I do promise a happy ending to this story, I swear. I know that cliffhanger was a bitch, but honestly you should know better by now. I can't resist. Be assured that more will be explained in the next chapter along with a deeper insight into the effects this is having on Steve and Bucky once this discussion is out of the way. I just ask that you trust where this is leading.
As Tony entered the door to a second, side entrance of the center, Tony was having minimal success trying to control his nerves. What if they don’t meet? What if something goes wrong? What if…
Steve had helped James through school, from classwork to outright lying for him to keep him out of trouble, because who could ever believe that Steve Rogers would lie? James kept Steve from being beaten to death on a regular basis when the guys mouth just wouldn’t stop running at schoolyard bullies. Steve never did like bullies.
“What?” She asked in surprise. “Colonel Phillips, but he’s very busy at the moment!” She yelled because Steve and Tony had already begun running toward the officer’s tent. Thanks to his enhanced senses, Steve dimly noted that she was running along behind them.
“You ever notice how much Bucky talks and gestures with his hands while he shuffles?” Steve asked. “He started figuring out those tricks when he was twelve. Taught a few to me after he got really good at it, and like you said, no one ever suspects me of cheating. I never cheat if money is involved though.”
The things he’d said to Steve, calling him a science experiment, saying it was the contents of a bottle that made him special, he’d never get to take that back. Even if he somehow managed to change future events, and Steve never had to actually hear those words, Tony had still said them. No, he couldn’t take it back, but he was thankful that he’d at least learned to do better.
This morning that glowing reputation had come to fruition. He was practically bouncing as he walked to their apartment, so full of good news and good feeling that he was liable to burst. When he’d been approached by the senior physician at the hospital, he’d been expecting a good job that paid well. The man was the chief of medicine; he could afford to pay for quality work. Tony had gotten so much better than a crisp ten dollar bill and a thank you. He just couldn’t wait to tell Steve, and then later Bucky after he got home from work.
“I’m suddenly feeling very patriotic,” Tony began, “but I had a little issue with the draft board. It’s just as well because I feel my talents would be better suited somewhere more specific.” He took a deep breath and rolled the dice. Leaning forward and keeping his voice low, he asked, “What are the chances you’d be able to get me into the army, specifically under the Strategic Science Reserve?”
Their breathing was ragged as they both laid there recovering. The heat of Tony’s skin beneath him was comforting as Steve lifted his head to find Tony’s eyes.
Steve looked at him in disbelief before he burst into laughter. Tony smiled at him, pleased with himself for getting the reaction. Steve shouldn’t be worrying about some idiotic dame when he could be here with Tony laughing at his crude jokes. That’s just what he did, too.
Tony decided he couldn’t take anymore and went home well before noon. As he walked into the apartment, he saw that Steve and Bucky were sitting on the couch staring at the radio.
“Haven’t I always?” Bucky asked before looking sad. “Are you gonna have to leave now, Tony? I’m pretty sure Steve’s days in the USO are over, and you’re a civilian. I don’t want you in danger, but I don’t want you to go.”
So, no, not OK. There were still so many uncertainties, so many things that could go wrong, but Tony was tired of feeling helpless. He had been through too many situations where people thought he was helpless and at their mercy. Those people had been wrong every time.
“Dum, I’m too tired to hit you for that right now,” Gabe told him as he leaned his head against the metal, “so expect to be woken up by my fist in the morning. I’m gonna knock all those teeth out.”
Steve groaned as he kept pushing back against Tony’s hand. “UUnnhh, yes, Tony. More, I need more.” Steve liked a fast prep; he relished the burn it caused.
It was so strange to suddenly remember someone you love, someone who had made you so happy, but Bucky had gone through that for two people today. At least Steve was here to help him through it, but the comfort somehow didn’t feel complete without Tony. Until this curse had given him these memories, Bucky wouldn’t have believed it possible for Tony to be so caring and supportive, but he had been.
He watched as Tony exhaled a smooth stream of smoke from between his lips as he brought his glass up to take another sip of what Bucky guessed was scotch. Tony liked scotch, good scotch. He didn’t drink that often, but when he did, he wanted the good stuff. The smoking was an even rarer vice that Tony had, and he never did it around Steve because of his asthma. Tony smoked when he was deeply troubled, and Bucky wanted to ask him what was wrong, but he wouldn’t. He figured that he already knew the answer anyway.
“Fine, I guess it wouldn’t be too bad to sit while I can, enjoy the scenery for a bit,” Bucky said as he looked at the trees and moon above him like he'd never seen them before, or like he thought he'd never see them again. After a while he looked back to Steve. “I still wanna know what happened to you, Steve. How are you here? How are both of you here, and you’re so big…and a Captain?”
“Yes,” Tony groaned, his head pressing back into the pillow and eyes closing as he felt Bucky tug on his balls while he sucked along the head.
love each other. So stop acting like children who don’t know any better and remember that! I will not waste the precious time we have left together listening to this shit!”
Steve was beyond stunned by this conversation. He hadn’t expected any of this. He hadn’t expected Tony to know about the doctor. He hadn’t expected Tony to beg him to fight as hard as he could to be accepted. It scared Steve if he was being honest with himself. What was Tony keeping from him?
Their evening was a subdued affair as they just sat and listened to the radio reports coming in. None of them could muster up the will to eat something. They listened long into the night before they finally decided to go to bed where they just held each other.
He watched as Steve seemed to push aside his words, so Tony repeated them. “Steve, I promise you’ll never lose me. I’m not leaving you, baby.”
Now that the sun had set, the temperature continued to drop, and though Tony had improved the radiator a couple weeks back, it still wasn’t enough to keep the chill out of the apartment. The walls were too thin and so were the cheap window panes that only seemed to let out the heat while letting in the cold. It wasn’t good for Steve who was still recovering and under doctor’s orders to stay dry and warm.
“Yes, daddy,” Bucky moaned as Tony thrust in harder. Tony saw his arms tighten around Steve, obeying his order.
“I shall leave you to decide on your dinner.” Francesco said as he began to back away. “Gianetta will be in shortly to take your orders, but please, call if you need anything.”
Bucky panted over him. “I do.” He said as he pulled Tony’s thighs farther apart, almost bending him in half, so he could see all of Tony’s chest. “You’re so strong to have survived that.” He pulled his hips back, letting Tony get a breath before pushing back in. “It makes me feel safe knowing that you promised to take care of me. When I feel them on my skin,” he groaned as Tony swallowed around him, “it just makes me want you even more.”
“Oh, my sweet beautiful boy.” Tony said quietly as he moved to wrap his arms around the younger man. The feel of the larger body against him, as well as looking up to meet his eyes, would take some getting used to, but it was still his Steve. “You’re just stronger now. I’m sure you’ll learn how manage this new…everything of yours.”
Yes, his Daddy always took care of him. His Daddy protected him. The feel of strong calloused hands removing his clothes and moving along his skin made him feel dizzy with want. His Daddy’s touch had conditioned this response in him, and Bucky was going to be a good boy. He was going to submit completely to whatever happened.
“So that’s all we have?” Steve asked as he looked across the empty entrance hall of the sanctum. Everything was mostly in order, and the building appeared to be empty. The only thing out of place was the cell phone they’d found lying on the floor almost directly beneath a hole that had been blasted through the ceiling.
The kitchen light had been flickering when they’d eaten their dinner. Bucky said it had always done that. Sometimes it’d be fine, and other times it would flicker all evening. Then Tony thought about the two showers he’d taken since arriving, lukewarm at best. The water heater was obviously on its last legs. With a sense of purpose, he checked the lighting fixture and the closet that held the water heater. He made a list of materials he’d need to fix them and the radio before going out to find a hardware store.
Howard looked at him for several moments, then huffed, “You’re just trying to get me to name one of my children after you.”
“Je n’en reviens pas. Comment as-tu pu survivre a ça ?” A smaller man spoke quickly in French as he looked down at Bucky’s attempts to catch his breath after drinking. Steve guessed from the disbelief in his tone, he was surprised to see Bucky again. The man crouched and spoke more slowly in English. “Lucky tough bastard, Barnes.”
“Let’s just be glad it worked,” Bucky answered, not needing to be reminded of what he’d done as he picked up a canteen from the body at his feet. He rifled through the man’s pack and found food rations along with a few hygiene supplies and a blanket. He grabbed one of the empty packs they’d brought with them and began to fill it with their spoils. He grabbed clean socks and,
‘No, sir,” Steve panted. “I can take more. Please.” He needed Tony to fuck him. Tony was so thick that sometimes Steve himself couldn’t believe he could fit inside of him. It was an exquisite kind of almost pain when Tony claimed him.
He then rushed to the medicine cupboard. He’d stocked up on some things when he realized just how sick Steve was prone to get sometimes. He found the bottle of eucalyptus oil he’d bought for possible respiratory infections, but it would do for this too. He ran back to the sofa as he opened the bottle to pour a few drops on the handkerchief from his pocket. He put the piece of fabric under his nose without blocking his mouth.
Almost immediately, Tony’s hands were running over his arms, and Bucky sighed at the light touch. He’d craved this. The stolen moments and gentle caresses he’d shared with Steve and Tony the past two days had barely filled his need for this. His body still hurt, and Bucky was so relieved that he got to stop pretending that he was OK. He wanted to curl up in Tony’s lap and be held and soothed and taken care of. He was so thankful that Tony had gotten them this room so they could have this.
Steve rubbed at his temples as he squeezed his eyes shut, concentrating. It was so much information to sift through. “Just about three months, I think, because it’s almost Christmas in my latest memories. Bucky just lost his job. That’s all I know until the next wave of memories hits.”
The moments stretched in silence as everyone watched and waited for the rest of what Steve was going to say. For whatever reason Steve was having trouble getting it out, so Bucky pulled on his big boy pants, bit the bullet and finished Steve’s sentence.
She took one step forward. “And please remember that we are more than the things we’ve done. Any time you need reminding of that from someone who also has red in their ledger, come and find me. It’s good to remember we’re not alone.”
“The woman who helps run the center had seen me at the dance hall when I’d go out.” Bucky finished. “And she said she’d been impressed cuz I was very good, and they’d needed a guy to help with their lessons so she’s gonna give me a chance.”
Bucky had to leave. There was nothing he could do to change that. Steve would have to undergo the procedure that injected him with the serum because he would be needed to save Bucky in Italy. That is when Steve would truly become Captain America, and Tony had to be there.
“Um, thanks,” Bucky said because this was a shit situation, his head was pounding, and the man was talking like they were enjoying high tea. “I’m Sergeant James Barnes, and you are?”
Tony gulped as his mind began to race. It was only hours ago that both of them had been in this room on one of these beds making love as Tony listened through the door. He felt dirty. He’d violated their privacy, and here they were offering to share their bed with him so that he was comfortable and could rest.
“That is fine, Tony.” Erskine assured him. “I only need for you to meet with him a few times before the project is underway.”
Tony didn’t handle hopeless well, and all of the emotions he’d been trying to overcome since he realized he was stranded here crashed down on him. He wanted to go home. He wanted his workshop and his robots. He missed JARVIS and Pepper and Rhodey and Happy and that band of lunatics he called his teammates. He missed the uncomplicated interactions he had with Cap and James. He missed fighting over stupid things like using someone else’s coffee mug and what movie they should watch and what Chinese place they should order from.
“You could teach me.” And then his mind was off, thinking of scenes from Dirty Dancing. Bucky was Jennifer Grey, of course, because let’s face it, Tony’s too old to be crawling across the floor of a dance studio. “I mean, you know I’m not really up on all the new moves people are using nowadays. I saw you at the dance hall. You’re a natural.”
He wrapped his hand around Steve’s leaking cock and began stroking him quickly. “Always,” he promised, “Always, love you two so much. Fucking need you. You’re mine, always. Come for me, come now!”
The other men nodded, and Steve couldn’t find it in himself to refuse their kindness, so he accepted the almost empty canteen and took a drink. He was immediately grateful for it because he’d been thirstier than he’d realized. It wasn’t much, but it was enough to keep going.
It had been seven weeks since he arrived, and each day seemed longer than the one before. He missed his partners. He missed home. It was evening as he laid down tiredly in his bunk. The shower he’d recently taken had washed away the sweat and grime, but it had done almost nothing to soothe his muscles. He’d really gotten spoiled to the shower that Tony had worked so hard to perfect in their apartment.
Halfway down he pulled away, Tony watched as Bucky used his lips to push the foreskin back before circling the freshly exposed head with his tongue then digging it into the slit. He repeated the swirl of his tongue then used it to press it along the length of the shaft before moving back to gently suck the tip.
“That’s it, sweetheart. You just enjoy this. Daddy and Steve are going to take you away from everything.” Bearded lips said beside his ear, brushing his skin.
Byrne had turned even paler. Tony could see that the man knew what could happen. The butcher was generally a pleasant guy, who was helplessly in love with his wife, despite her indiscretions, and it made him very jealous and possessive. Rumor was he’d already put one guy in the hospital for being a little too friendly with her. The guy had been too scared to press charges.
“Do you want to talk about what’s been botherin’ you?” Steve asked, not sounding particularly hopeful that it would happen.
about you, Mr. Stark.” Erskine told him bluntly, but not unkindly. “I do not know what because I am not trained or learned enough for that. I only know enough to inform me of my surroundings when I encounter the mystical, and I know that you are something other than normal.”
Tony chuckled without humor, suddenly exhausted. “I’m just a former genius, billionaire, hero and philanthropist. Though I guess I’m still a genius for all the good it does me.” He took a deep breath. “In the simplest terms, I’m a time traveler.”
Tony’s mind blinked with static as he felt heat curling in his gut. He knew it was wrong, but it didn’t seem to matter, he was so turned on right now. Steve continued talking, saying filthy things to Bucky as he (from the sounds being made) very enthusiastically sucked Steve off like it was his job.
She laughed as she set their traditional decanter of wine on the table. “Keep flirting, Mr. Tony. I know I don’t stand a chance against your loves, but it still makes my heart sing.” She gave a sly smile to Bucky and Steve.
While Bucky continued to fuck his face with Tony’s dick, Steve reached back and grabbed a handful of Tony’s hair. “Been thinkin’ about this since I saw you do it to Bucky.” He said, his voice full of authority. “Now it’s my turn. I’m gonna ride your face, and you’re gonna make this good for me.”
The brunet leaned against him as Tony supported his other side with his gun drawn, ready to shoot if they encountered anyone on their way out. Steve hoped the other prisoners were able to get to safety, but his biggest concern were the two men next to him. He couldn’t believe they’d gotten this far. His and Tony’s stealth mission had been a huge success, but Steve still couldn’t believe their luck. Hell, he couldn’t believe how easy some of it had been either.
Tony reassured him. “You are not weak. It doesn’t make you less of a man, and there is nothing wrong with it. Wanting to be cared for by someone you love and trust is never a bad thing.”
Tony sighed. “Look, I have the money, and it’s not like I’m going to be using it when I have to go off with Cap. I know it’s awkward that I’m even offering, but, well…You just got out of a living hell, and who knows what you’ll be doing next? I’m going to a hotel, and I’m going to make Bucky and Steve get a room there, too, because he’s been through enough without having to sleep in an overcrowded tavern or military base or whatever.
. “Hey, fellas,” he answered as he rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “Sorry. I tried to wave and get your attention when we left, but I guess you didn’t see me.” He hadn’t quite met their eyes yet. “I walked Lucille home.”
“Yeah, Steve’s much more capable at defending himself, that’s for sure, but he’s still going to need people to watch his back.”
Steve was eating popcorn that he was sharing with Bucky as they approached a large stage that had a crowd gathered around it. In the middle of the stage was a red car. Just then music started, and a line of very pretty women came out dressed in show girl tuxedo outfits. Girls around them in the crowd started yelling “There he is!”, and yup, there was Howard.
As Tony watched Steve meet Bucky’s eyes, he heard what the blonde wasn’t saying. Bucky didn’t have to come. He could just enjoy his rest before he got assigned somewhere a little further from the action. A very large part of Tony wanted Bucky to take him up on that unspoken offer.
Tony’s eyes had teared up somewhere in the middle of the letter, and he sniffed as he looked over to Steve from where his head still rested in his lap. Steve’s eyes weren’t any better than Tony’s, and the tip of his nose was pink.
“Yeah, you, queer lover.” This fucker was on Tony’s last nerve. “Where’s the shrimp? I’d have thought that he would be followin’ you ‘round like a mutt after a bone.”
A second bottle of wine was soon opened, and conversation began to pick up. Tony told them about his day and some of its funnier moments. Bucky and Steve told him about their little misadventure to get the wine, and how Bucky had talked his way into getting two more bottles than the guy originally offered.
Louise apparently knew Steve’s date (Ann she’d called her), and the two of them spent a few minutes catching up. Tony tuned out their conversation in favor of watching Steve. He was hunched in and looked tired but resigned. Tony nudged him with his shoulder.
Yes, once again time seemed to be passing so quickly, but Bucky’s absence also made it seem like an eternity. Tony had felt this way since he’d first arrived in the past. Days racing by and dragging slowly, all at the same time.
Natasha seemed to read his thoughts as she said, “We don’t know enough to do anything more at the moment, Steve. We’re just going to be discussing theories and doubling back on what we’ve already done. Take the time to rest and adjust,” she finished as her eyes motioned to Bucky.
“Look at you taking me,” Tony panted as he watched himself fuck into Steve so roughly it was almost dizzying. “I can’t believe it. I expected to split you open, but just look at how you bounce on my dick.” Tony’s voice deepened. “And I can still feel you trying to push me deeper.”
“I got a promotion,” Steve told him lamely. He couldn’t explain here in front of everyone, and it wasn’t because he didn’t want to give up command. He wasn’t sure that he should just be telling everyone that he was part of a top-secret military experiment. So, he just used his eyes to silently beg Bucky to leave it alone for now.
Steve knew Bucky still wasn’t as comfortable with the other Avengers as he was with Steve, but he hoped that would improve over time. He also hoped his teammates had patience with Bucky while he adjusted to everything. He figured that as long as Bucky didn’t shoot at them too often, it shouldn’t be a problem. If anything, he should be shooting at them less after remembering more of who he was.
“Stark will not die, not from illness or the passage of time.” Thor told them. “He will only be released from this curse upon your death. He will not age. He will never be free to create a life for himself because he will never be able to stay anywhere longer than the span of years it would take for others to notice. The purpose of this spell is to
Bucky gripped the table as another wave of memories hit him. This one came with intense emotions, too intense. His breathing became labored as once again his mind was filled with a new version of his past. This time, it was almost too much for him to push away.
Bucky shrugged as he chewed his food. “It was a bitch of a walk, but I made it. Feels good to lay on a cot, and I feel a bit better every time I eat. All things considered I feel pretty good.”
Steve didn’t see it that way. He’d helped, but they’d fought for their freedom and won it themselves. He was still having trouble wrapping his head around the respect they showed him, but he still appreciated it.
The only thing he’d seen that resembled this level of grief and anger had been after the Chitauri Invasion, but this was different. That was the aftermath of a battle that was fought in one day in one city. This was a war that would take years and span the globe.
“Great!” Tony clapped his palms together. “So let’s see what we got for Steve to cook. I can buy food all the live long day, but trust me, you do not want me in front of a stove.”
He’d also gotten them two new shirts and a belt for each of them because it was nice to feel good about what you wore sometimes.
“This is where your trust in Steve and me is so important.” Tony told him before he looked to Steve.
Bucky came in carrying a plate of sandwiches and a glass of milk. “The only demands that matter right now are ours. You stay put ‘til that wound closes, or I’ll tie you down.”
A cab was pulling up to them as Bucky leaned in to whisper, “It was, honey. I don’t know why you don’t wanna see it, but it was. You’re our hero.”
News came in steadily from around the globe. The destruction of Europe and the threat of the Germans and Italians rang out more often. News of Japan and Washington’s growing tensions put Tony further on edge. Japan was invading China, and the U.S. retaliated against the atrocities being committed by battering them with a list of economic sanctions and trade embargoes.
Not waiting for a reaction and ready to get this back on track, he went to the bed and crawled over to them. He kissed Bucky before turning his head to kiss Steve. This time he let his mouth linger in the kiss as his hand went to Bucky’s thigh. As he slid his tongue into Steve’s mouth, his hand also slid up higher until he got to Bucky’s cock.
Steve watched as Tony gently leaned Bucky against the railing before he pulled off his pack and began searching through it. Tony’s hand reappeared with a length of rope as he quickly walked up to Steve and began wrapping it around the hand that wasn’t holding the shield.
Bucky didn’t answer. He just took another deep breath and exhaled, obviously having fallen asleep. Tony realized he was half hard and sandwiched between the two of them. Both their heads on either of his shoulders. He looked up at the ceiling, once again wondering how this was his life.
He watched as Steve lifted himself up on his knees and grabbed Bucky’s dick to line him up with his opening. Steve’s head fell back as he began to sink down on it, panting for breath as Bucky groaned beneath him, and Tony watched as every thick inch slowly disappeared from view inside Steve.
He had thanked Tony several more times and promised to tell his friends about what a miracle worker he was before Tony finally made his leave. So, yes, it had been a really good day he thought as he walked along 73
“Is there anything else the history books left out?” Sam asked as he added a piece of bacon on top of his waffle before eating it.
look at Tony. Trust that Bucky would see it anyway. That just made Steve even more conflicted about his recent feelings toward his teammate. He’d finally gotten Bucky back, his soulmate, but it wasn’t really his Bucky. Steve sometimes wondered if he wasn’t just so lonely and desperate that he’d latched on to Tony.
Tony understood the reasoning behind it. They hoped that without the money from trade, as well as supplies, metals and oil, Japan would have to reign themselves in from their expansionism. The two countries’ negotiations were going nowhere as Japan proudly stood their ground. Tony knew where this was heading, and it caused him many sleepless nights.
The man nodded quickly before telling Tony the total of the week’s stay, and Bucky just barely kept his reaction quiet. The other guys were not as successful, and Bucky was pretty sure he was already learning to curse in French.
“Is that a C-ration?” Bucky asked as they both watched Tony use the metal pin-key to open the container.
Tony could hear his voice rising with every word as his breathing hitched, but he couldn’t stop. “Bucky, we know you are not a bigot. Steve, now is not the time to be morally righteous. We are about to declare war on
“Shit!” Steve practically hollered. “Yeah, Bucky, your mouth is so good, so hot and wet. You’re tongue’s fucking perfect. So good to me, lettin’ me fuck your mouth.”
“Merry Christmas!” He called out, and they spun around to see him in the kitchen covered in flour and stirring a pot over the stove.
They’d arrived at the military base, and an escort had been there waiting for Steve. His blonde partner had just shrugged helplessly before promising to meet them later. Dugan had yelled the name of the pub they’d all be going to later, and Steve called that he’d see them there. They’d watched him leave before collecting their bags and moving towards the outer gates so they could find some cabs.
Steve looked to argue that, but Tony cut him off. “Nope. It’s done. If you’re nice enough to let me stay, then let me be nice enough to earn my keep.”
“Well, I’ve been told I’ve got quite the mouth myself. In any case you really should go home and rest. Which way is it?” Tony motioned for them to start walking. Steve went along with him towards the street.
So, he took a breath and got up from his chair at the island. He grabbed his juice and moved to the fridge to refill the almost empty glass, then he walked over and sat down at the table across from the other three. They stopped their conversation and looked over to him. He could see Banner and Barton’s surprise, though Banner seemed more polite about it. Natasha’s small smile returned as she nodded to him again.
They had just sat down when Steve exited the bedroom. A mess of blonde hair atop his head, puffy sleep-reddened eyes and a too big white shirt and boxers hung from him. He looked adorable, even with the split lip and black eye.
“Well, if it isn’t the Star-Spangled Man with A Plan. What is your plan today?” He asked with that usual bite in his tone. He looked past Steve and saw Tony. “What the hell is Stark doing here?”
Steve felt someone appear beside him. The fact that he hadn’t heard or sensed their approach could only mean that it was one of two people, and he already knew where Natasha was. “What do you think, Buck?”
Bucky had heard the impact of Tony’s back hitting the wall, just as he heard the sound their heads knocking together as Tony got Joe off of him. Joe stumbled, and with a few more quick punches and a kick, Joe was on the ground with Tony on his chest.
Steve rolled eyes. “You were great today with the groceries, Tony, but you don’t have a job either.”
They finally pulled up to the address Tony had given the driver. He paid and tipped the man before stepping out in front of the cozy Italian restaurant that would be their venue tonight.
Tony looked up from the pan, looking kind of surprised at Bucky’s realization. “Huh, no I haven’t. Wanna make me a cup, sweetheart?” He asked as he batted his lashes ridiculously at Bucky.
good at what he did. He didn’t know it, but a lot of people also called him kind. If a widow with kids or elderly couple didn’t really have the money to spare, he’d take something in trade. A cake or pie or crocheted blanket, anything they would offer for his time. He’d fixed an old woman’s furnace so she wouldn’t go without heat, and all he’d accepted from her was a lovely blue scarf she’d made him.
“Shit, Bucky, you should see yourself.” Steve panted. “Taking both of us. You feel so good, love. You’re incredible.”
He sat down with a groan as he leaned back against the cushions. The silence was too heavy for Tony so he finally asked what he’d been wondering the whole walk home. “How did you two find me? What were you doing there?”
“Good idea,” Tony murmured at the action. As soon as Steve turned his back, Tony grabbed one of the clips for himself. His power problems for the gauntlet had just been solved.
Tony watched the horror on the faces of the men at that revelation, and he tried to reign in his anger. Tony had known, but it didn’t make it any easier to hear it.
Bucky looked up at him. “I do like who you are, Steve. I see bits of the old you when you take care of me, or how stubborn you can be. I like that you push me to think for myself and don’t try to change me. And even though it’s different, I do like the big you.”
Tony chuckled, shaking his head. “Hardly, I’ve slept on rocks, while freezing my ass off by the way, last night was heaven compared to that.” He took another bite of toast, lamenting the lack of coffee, but he wasn’t about to bring it up. He didn’t
“Why?” Dum asked from beside him. “You make a harder target at night. You’re four feet away, and I can barely see you.”
Bucky shook his head. “No, you were thinking of me before when you looked worried. Then, you started smiling when you thought of Tony.” Like Steve said, Bucky was very observant.
Dugan tipped up the brim of his hat to look at him. “I think you’ve got me confused with your mother, Jones.”
“I liked the beard,” Bucky said, and since he’d already drawn all of their attention to him, he might as well finish what he’d been thinking. “It made him look rugged, handsome.” Fuck them if they didn’t like his opinion. He knew Steve agreed with him.
“I thought,” Tony struggled to voice the thoughts that had been in the back of his head for over two months. “I thought you didn’t let me pay rent because you didn’t want me to have a claim here. I’m a guest. This is your home.”
Another two weeks pass, and Tony had been making good on his promise to himself. He doesn’t let his thoughts wander inappropriately, he doesn’t stare at Bucky’s muscled arms and trim waist. Or Steve’s compelling eyes and graceful hands. He. Does. Not.
“It was just something I remembered.” Bucky said uncomfortably at the island counter where he sat across from Steve.
Steve and him had finally taken a chance and fooled around like they used to do. No quick hidden kisses or silently jerking each other off in the middle of the night so they weren’t discovered. And Fuck, it had been good.
“It’s not wrong,” Steve told him as he pulled away and began making his way back to the stove. “You and I have both changed after everything we’ve through, but we’ve still found a way to move forward and create something new. Tony’s already proven he’s capable of doing that so many times. We’re not going to lose him, Buck, not the things that really matter anyway. Tony’s stronger than that.”
Steve didn’t care. He was through being dismissed. “I just need one name: Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th.”
A teammate had gone missing, and as their leader, it was Steve’s responsibility to find him and bring him home. Then, the flood of memories signaling the curse taking effect and changing Tony from a missing teammate to the man he loved being trapped decades in the past with no way of returning.
It should have been awkward. They were in bed wearing their pajamas. It wasn’t, though, and he had to stop himself from openly crying again. He’d never had this. Not with Pepper. Not with anyone. For the first time in nearly two months, Tony wasn’t sure he wanted to go home. He didn’t think he could give this up. He’d trade the future, his fortune and his life to keep this as long as he could.
“I’ve been following and assisting the Captain on tour, making sure he eats his vegetables and remembers his lines. I needed a job, and he was hiring,” Tony said spitefully.
Bucky moved farther up to the head of the bed. He turned to bend over on his knees as he rested his head on his folded arms. As he watched, Tony realized he needed this. Both of them following his orders and giving him control. Everything had felt so beyond his control this week that the realization of this being something he
The place was in full swing when they’d walked in. Couples were dancing out on the floor to songs by Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey and all the other big names he heard on the radio. They’d found Steve and Bucky soon enough.
Bucky just shook his head so Steve picked up the story. “He came by not long after you’d left this mornin’. He said he knew what he’d heard us doin’ last night, and he wasn’t gonna live next to that.” Steve took a steadying breath. “ He said we needed to leave, move out, or he’d tell everyone and call the cops.”
And there on the screen, Bucky could see the flash of hurt on Tony’s face as the man’s words finally hit their mark. A second later, however, Tony’s face shut down. His voice was deliberate and menacing.
Bucky vaguely realized he was crying as he desperately shook his head harder at the mean voices, voices who all sounded like him.
Steve watched as Tony looked up from his book. He wasn’t sure how Tony would react to his news. He was already worried about Tony since Bucky had left the previous day.
Abrams stared opened mouthed at him for a few moments as Tony’s words sank in. He could see the point when the doctor rallied himself before saying, “As an employee of this hospital, you are required to stay here and…”
Ever since the serum had cleared up his asthma, Tony didn’t feel compelled to smoke away from Steve. Which was a good thing because that meant Steve actually got to see him. Tony was smoking now more than ever. He’d spent a small fortune on them before packing for this trip, and his supply seemed never ending.
He’d never heard James talk so much, which he now thought was a shame because the guy was kinda funny, and that voice...
Tony blinked and more tears fell. “I’ve lost…everything.” He managed to get out. “I can’t lose you. I love you too much...to lose you.”
Tony realized where she was going with this. It was proof that even though he was a genius, he still made stupid mistakes when it came to common sense.
One or both of them gave a small cry that was probably lost in the noise of the fight when Tony took a hit to the face, but it didn’t seem to slow him even as his knee hit the ground. Punches and spinning kicks and more punches, and then it was just him and Joe.
It hurt. Everything hurt. His veins still throbbed from whatever they’d injected him with. He could do little else but scream from the burning pain the syringe produced. Every time it happened, he’d think, this is it. There’s no way he’d survive this again, but he had been wrong because after what felt like an eternity later, they’d inject him again.
But something was wrong. His chest was tight, and his breathing quickened. He felt anger and fear, followed by pain before heart breaking guilt and worry. The feelings always came faster than the thoughts that inspired them, so a split second later, he was overcome with the actual events of that December.
None of the memories he had of being with Steve included him after the serum, and Bucky was taken aback. Yes, since they’d moved into the tower, he’d seen Steve every day. He’d even seen him without a shirt while they were working out or changing in the locker room, but it had always been with clinical detachment. He’d never looked at Steve, or anyone for that matter, in a way that could be described as appreciative.
“Absolutely, Cap,” Clint said with a lumpy half-formed meatball in his hand, “we’ll get this fixed in no time. Strange has to resurface soon, right?”
“You’re absolutely right, Pep. Of course you are, but my lab is on lockdown at the moment. As soon as I get back to the tower, I’ll grab those applications and bring them right over.” Tony said, hoping to appease his angry CEO and praying that there wasn’t coffee or motor oil stains on them.
Tony then pulled back to get off the bed and headed to the bathroom. He wet a washcloth and brought it back to the room. He crawled back over to Bucky. “Can I clean you up?”
“Tony, please. Never really liked the Stark.” It reminded him of Howard who, he was just realizing, was alive and younger than him right now. Weird. “And really it’s no big deal.”
“Now we get to worry about other things,” Bucky said as he moved to sit up more carefully this time.
“You really think we’ll get to see somethin’ like that?” Bucky asked, eyes bright. Yep, he was definitely going to make an armored, flying car.
Bucky and Gabe both had to struggle to hold in their laughter as they marched along. Dum Dum could always be counted on for a crazy story.
“Well, now that you’ve proven you’re not completely useless,” the colonel barked, “the doctor said that you would be handy in the lab. Can I ask how a repairman from Brooklyn is qualified to work on experimental government technology?”
Bucky was charming, playful and mischievous with lean muscles, a strong jaw, thick hair and eyes like an arctic ocean.
“So fucking sexy,” He repeated as he firmly pushed forward, using just enough pressure to slip through the ring of muscle without going too fast. Both he and Bucky groaned as he entered the tight heat that was always so perfect around him.
It seemed as though Philips was also jockeying to be on Tony’s list as the man shredded Steve’s self-worth and dreams in just a few sentences. Honestly, Tony wondered how the man could be so thick-headed. What Steve had done today proved that he should be given a chance to fight, but the man had completely dismissed him. Tony watched it all from his corner where he was ignored.
“That,” Steve said as he motioned vaguely with his hand in the direction their host had just left. “How do you know him? And you speak Italian? And why are we in this fancy room?”
It was Bucky’s turn to give him a dry look. “Bein’ queer’s not exactly unheard of in this neighborhood. You have to know that by now. The hotel a few blocks away is pretty much a haven for ‘em, and you musta seen some of the guys dressed as dames on the street at night by now. And everyone knows what goes on at night at the navy yard a few blocks away.”
“Holy Fuck,” Tony breathed out before he crossed the distance, grabbed Bucky and kissed him hotly, cutting off the sound of surprise the other man made. He sucked on his bottom lip, licked at it with his tongue before letting his teeth run across the plump flesh and taking a playful nip as he pulled away. “I’m crazy about you, both of you. I just never thought you’d want me back.”
“Do you get hurt a lot?” Tony knew Steve had been bullied and had gotten in a few scrapes, but the way Steve had said it just now made it sound like a regular part of his life.
At that moment Colonel Philips entered the barracks. “On your feet, men!” He bellowed as Steve and everyone scrambled to attention. He wondered what fresh hell they were about to go through. Steve didn’t think he could take another surprise night-training session. Yeah, Bucky’s letters had definitely not shared the worst of his experiences during his training.
“We’re getting you out of here, gorgeous,” Tony told him as he grabbed one arm to loop around his shoulder and support him as Steve did the same for the other.
Slowly, Bucky wrapped his hand around his member and squeezed as he gave himself a long stroke up to the tip. He felt the small amount of fluid that rubbed onto his fingers as he moved his foreskin away from the sensitive head. He thumbed at the slit and thought of Tony’s tongue doing something very similar, and his breath hitched. As he moved his hand back down to continue stroking himself, he thought of Steve’s hot breath against his neck as his hips continued their movements, creating the slapping sound of their skin.
he figured from the looks on their faces. He actually saw fear there. They were afraid of him, and a large part of himself couldn’t blame them for that. Tony knew he was capable of violence. Iron Man came with a certain amount of violence, both done to and done by him. But this wasn’t Iron Man fighting, this was Tony being brutal because these men happened to be there and had earned Tony’s anger.
“No, Steve,” he said seriously, “you create. You turn a blank piece of nothing into art. Sexy art , but it’s no less beautiful. It may not seem like much to you, but it makes people happy. Fuck the stigma that comes with it. This world is filled with a whole lot of awful, cruel things. I think bringing happiness to people, however they choose to find it, is nothing scoff at.”
As a big band song began on the radio, Bucky stepped back up against him, smirking. “Perfect tune. Let’s see what you’ve learned.”
And Steve let out a long groan that signaled his release. It was soon followed by Bucky’s harsh grunt as he must have come while trying to swallow Steve’s.
I hope this was worth the wait. I've never written smut before. I hope the way they got together felt natural enough to be believable and didn't take you out of the story. I know the discussion they had before sex was vague in some parts, but I didn't like the idea of Tony throwing out terms and labels that the boys wouldn't understand so I had him try to explain it in ways they would. Plus, I believe that sexuality is fluid and don't like to label myself as one thing or the other because dynamic can change for a lot of reasons, depending on the person's head space at the time or the person they are with. It's why I wrote Steve to be so versatile since he has two very different lovers. He just wants to make them happy.
“Fuck, Tony looks so good taking you.” Steve moaned as he ground his pelvis against Bucky’s face. He pulled back freeing himself and asked, “How’s his mouth, love?”
Tony’s heart stopped when he saw his sweet boy on that table as he babbled a series of numbers to someone that wasn’t there. Tony knew those numbers. When the pain in his hand had been at its worst, he’d closed his eyes and heard those numbers. “Sweetheart.”
“You were headed to eat?” Tony asked because besides the fact that he was hungry by this time of day, he didn’t want to leave the German doctor. Not yet. The temptation was too strong to talk to him.
Bucky nodded along with Steve, less embarrassed about this fact than he would have been before Tony explained it better to him.
“Can I?” Steve motioned to his chest nervously, and after a couple moments consideration, Tony nodded.
Steve couldn’t say exactly what it was, but it was there in his eyes and smile and the way he looked around himself sometimes like he was seeing something different than the people around him.
“There is nothing wrong with the tubes.” Abrams answered looking flustered. “It was only a bad image.”
Steve would take Lucille to the park or a diner, and they’d talk about art. Bucky would go to the dance hall almost every weekend with the same pretty girl on his arm. Tony and Ruth would go to the movies or jazz clubs and just enjoy their friendship.
He thought about his lovers. They were probably eating dinner right about now. Steve would have made something delicious. Tony might have helped him with it if he made it home early enough, but Bucky doubted it. From the letters he’d received, Bucky had gotten the impression that Tony was working himself ragged with everything he was juggling. The worst of it seemed to stem from whatever secret consulting work he was doing.
Tony smirked, “I wouldn’t dream of it. You don’t even like me.” Tony hesitated before finishing, “Do it for your father. If he or his legacy means anything to you, do it for him. My own father was a nightmare. He made my life hell when he wasn’t ignoring me. If yours was better than that, do it for him.”
I always felt cheated that we never got to see Steve adjust to his new body other than that one wobble and fall while he was running. It would have been a huge adjustment. So, I wrote that for myself.
No, they were distraught upset, and that sent Tony into angry protective mode. What had happened during the day?
“Steve,” Tony had to cut him off because he couldn’t watch their concern, “the only people who scare me are bossy redheaded women, and none of them are in this camp. I can handle Phillips.”
Steve carded his fingers through Bucky’s hair. “I want him to feel it, love. Want to watch him choke on you.” He looked down at Tony, mouth still open and waiting. “Ask him for it.”
Tony couldn’t keep up with his emotions. Relief, gratitude, exhaustion, awe. He finally settled on hungry. “That sounds wonderful. Thank you.”
Steve shook his head as he thought back to one of their first days of school when Buck had been upset that four other boys had his name, and Steve had piped up and told him that he’d call him Bucky. They’d been best friends ever since. Bucky had always continued the tradition of renaming every James he found.
“You don’t have to patronize me,” Steve told him softly, looking almost defeated. “I appreciate you supporting my decision to keep trying to enlist, but we both know I’ll probably never make it to any kind of battle.”
“Not as hot as watching the two of you,” Tony said as he undid his pants and pushed them and his boxers down in one go. “I’m so fuckin’ lucky. You two naked in bed and waiting for me.”
“Yeah,” Bucky said. “After you left this mornin’, me and Stevie were sitting on the couch. I was lookin’ through the paper, and the radio was playin’ when the song we danced the foxtrot to came on. And I said ‘wish I could just get paid to dance cuz I know I’m good at it. I taught Tony in no time’, and Steve said ‘well, why don’t you?’”
“Tony,” he began more softly than usual, “do you know why I am the way I am? It’s not like…You said it wasn’t unusual.”
“I know, sweet boy.” Tony soothed him. “I’m gonna take good care of you. This is for Steve. You wanna be good for us, don’t you sweetheart?”
Tony was about to say ‘fuck it’ and grab his dick, when a long, drawn out moan sounded from the bedroom. The squeaking of the bed stuttered and seconds later Bucky let out a low groan.  The following silence was disturbed only by the sounds of heavy breathing of both the lovers in the room and the two men on the couch.
“I’m still pretty pissed about that,” Steve said. “They told me this list of things that had me worried he would never wake up, never walk again, or he’d have brain damage, and none of it was true. When he was sayin’ how he was fine, I had my doubts until they took the casts off, and Tony got out of that bed by himself. He was a walkin’ collection of bruises, I’m not gonna lie, but he was walkin’.”
Bucky wasn’t ready to share at the moment, and if Steve was being honest with himself, he wasn’t sure he was ready to hear it either. He would though, when Bucky finally wanted to tell him. He didn’t know how long that would take, and he didn’t know what that revelation would mean for them moving forward.
That was OK, though, because right now in this shabby little kitchen of their too small apartment, they had each other. They were family. And Tony’s mind flickered to images of the Grinch’s heart growing three sizes, and Tiny Tim’s squeaky voice saying “God bless us, everyone.”
Steve just stood there in his towel and waited for Bucky to speak. He looked just as tired as Steve felt over the events of today. After a few more silent moments, Bucky spoke. His voice was so soft that Steve probably wouldn’t have heard anything at all if it hadn’t been for his enhanced senses.
James just rolled his eyes and muttered something that sounded like, “You should have been placed in Slytherin. I can’t believe the computer said you were something cool like Gryffindor.”
When Steve realized that he was finally fully naked in front of Tony for the first time in this body, he grew a little uncomfortable and looked to the side.
Tony started slow, watching Bucky move forward with each thrust to take more of Steve. The tight stretch around him felt incredible, and he soon found himself building a faster rhythm. Tony looked down to see himself disappear into Bucky before sliding out again, his hole stretched around the cock moving inside him. He tilted his hips to find the right angle and knew when he found his mark.
James snorted in disbelief. “On that thing? You don’t have to be gracious, it’s like sleeping on rocks.” Next to him Steve nodded tiredly in agreement.
Tony woke up in the dark, gasping and thrashing against hands that were trying to hold him down under water, hold him down as they carved into his chest and broke bones that were supposed to protect his heart.
“The reference isn’t what’s important right now, Cap.” Sam said as he turned to (apparently) his lover with a look that clearly read as
“I did,” Dugan said. “Depression got bad and they couldn’t afford to pay all of us. So, I left. It was only fair. Some of those people couldn’t get jobs like everyone else, that’s why they joined the circus in the first place. Regular people don’t hire the deformed, do they?”
Tony just hummed around him before sucking harder and tugging on his balls. Steve’s hips jumped as he released a harsh groan and came hard down Tony’s throat. He never let up as he stroked Steve though it and swallowed everything.
He kept repeating that thought, willing himself to believe that there was something for him to do in this hopeless situation. If he did that enough times, maybe he could finally believe it. Maybe he could believe that he wouldn’t lose them both. It was still repeating in his head when he finally closed his eyes and slowly let sleep claim him.
Bucky just kind of shrugged and muttered, “Different.” He hadn’t really met any of their eyes since they’d come into the kitchen. That was alright, Steve thought; he’d get their at his own pace.
“I know,” Bucky agreed. “I keep waitin’ for the day when he gets sick of us, or he’ll realize how much we’re holdin’ him back, or…we slip up and he catches us. I don’t think he’d do nothing to hurt us, but I can’t imagine him staying after that. And the longer he stays, the more I know it’s gonna hurt when he goes. He’s more than our friend, he’s….”
Steve didn’t know why he’d thought coming to Europe could be a good thing. He supposed it was that (admittedly stupid) optimism that he had never been able to get rid of. He always had to try and hope for best. He never really wanted to consider the worst that could happen if it was something he really wanted or believed in. Sure, he got down sometimes. Doesn’t everyone? But he’d always believed that if you worked hard enough and tried to see the best in a situation then it couldn’t turn out too bad. Right?
“As am I,” the man quietly agreed. “To answer your earlier question, we are at an unknown base in Austria, I believe.”
He went to the icebox and removed the remaining bottles from the top compartment before placing them in the bottom section. “Can’t let them get too cold.”
He struggled to focus his eyes because that voice sounded real. Growing clarity made the touch feel real. Finally the haze of his mind broke, and he saw… “Steve? Tony?”
It didn’t fix anything. It didn’t change anything, but for the first time in his life he was able to see Howard as something other than the cold, abusive man he’d grown up with. Howard was a flawed human being, but wasn’t everyone to varying degrees? No, nothing had really changed, but Tony had gotten the chance to speak with his father as an equal and come to an agreement.
As he and Steve hurriedly each packed a bag of what would be needed in their rescue of Bucky, Tony’s heart was racing. He had to keep reminding himself that this would work. They would find the base and rescue Bucky along with the other prisoners. Tony knew this, but it didn’t calm his nerves. Which was bad because Tony’s mouth tended to run away from him when he was like this.
No, he knew why. He just didn’t like the reason. They were all scared shitless, and none of them could handle the responsibility of getting them out of this. It’s not like Bucky wasn’t scared. It’s not like he actually knew what he was doing. Hell, he was the youngest of the officers here, but apparently, he could fake it better than any of them. A lifetime of lying helps with that, he supposed.
Tony’s fingers once again found that spot inside of him that was so sensitive, too sensitive after coming so recently, and began his assault all over again. Steve’s nails dug into the muscles of Tony’s upper arms as he groaned beneath him, biting his lip and grinding down into Tony’s fingers.
Tony sighed in relief. After joining this project and getting an unfiltered look behind the scenes, Tony had been a little horrified by how much Howard cared more about staying on schedule than ensuring the safety of the man who would be the recipient of the serum. He seemed to be under the notion that once the serum was administered, it would simply protect whoever was injected from anything that went wrong with the procedure.
Bucky shivered, his body warming at the thought of what would happen tonight. Tony just chuckled at his reaction and stepped back. He turned his head to call out over his shoulder, “I’m heading out, Mike! Thanks for the drink and smoke.”
Steve looked over to him as Tony pulled his mouth off Bucky, his hand moving to gently pat Bucky’s hip. “Roll over, sweetheart. Hands and knees.”
“I’m afraid that is correct, Captain.” JARVIS apologized. “Since they, and every associated record, would have been changed at that time.”
Just as he was building up the initiative to move, the bed shifted, and Steve got up to go over to the little garbage can in the corner, returning with it. He was a saint.
Suddenly, Steve felt metal fingers grab his chin before they forced his face to look down and meet Bucky’s eyes. Steve’s vision was blurred, but he could see that Bucky looked angry. “Don’t ever let me hear you say that about yourself again, punk, or I swear to Thor and his whole family that I will beat some sense into you.”
Tony nodded. “Yeah, I don’t think we’re getting the worst of it, but trust Bucky to try and find the best parts to write about. Look at that, he misses following my orders. That’s so sweet.”
Monty nodded, “The Captain said he’d asked on our behalf to make sure we got the time to rest. He really is quite a decent chap.”
“‘s okay, Tony,” Steve continued with even less clarity. “Bost’n, there’s always a party somewhere.”
Tony looked up, surprised, but smiling to see the younger officer. Fortunately, Bruce wasn’t there yet to witness Jane’s unusual show of immaturity. Tony was still getting himself settled in for the day at his desk, and he gestured for Jane to come in between starting up his computer terminal and organizing his pencils.
“Darling?” Tony drawled sleepily, startling Steve out of his thoughts. He held out his hand, reaching for Steve and urging him closer. “You’re back.”
“What do you mean you have no further witnesses?” Hansen hissed at Natasha, furious at the unexpected turn of events. “Call me to the stand.”
Sharon’s hesitant smile grew with genuine relief, then she quickly excused herself. She had a court case to get ready for, after all.
The elevator came to a halt on their floor, and Steve stumbled after Tony’s lead down the hall. “Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,” he rasped, scrubbing a hand over his face. When had he started sweating? “I thought I was gonna go away for assaulting someone expensive.”
“Tony,” Stephanie said with a quiet, but sincere, laugh. “You speak as if you could wield magic. Truly, you amaze me.”
“What do you think?” Tony asked as calmly as he could, though his excitement was so overwhelming that Steve could practically feel him vibrating from two feet away.
The young man paused and stared. Steve arched his brow and gave him a meaningful look as he tried a sip of his coffee.
Steve had no time to waste. He rushed to pull his sweater off while kicking off his jeans, stepped out of his boxers to pull on a fresh pair, and finally clawed his way into his t-shirt. Already it felt too small and confining, but one night of bad sleep next to Tony was worth it. He’d find a waxing place, maybe even squeeze it in on his lunch hour, he—
Tony turned his head to brush his lips over Steve’s, sucking on his bottom lip softly before releasing it reluctantly. “Pier first?” he said under his breath, confident that Steve was so focused on him that he would hear his question easily.
He released Steve’s soft cock from his lips with great care, then sat up to look around them. Only the other masters remained with their respective pets.
“Ben, do not listen to him!” Natasha shouted, and Ben’s arms visibly shook with the effort to keep the gun trained on Pierce’s head. “We do not murder in cold blood, that’s not who we are.”
“Fifteen year olds in the south drive legally: I have faith in you,” Tony assured him, then without waiting for an answer, tossed Steve the keys. “Shotgun!”
“Alright, I’ve got the first question,” Karl started, clearing his throat and gathering himself to ask the very serious question. “Steve: what was the name of Tony’s character in
“Whatever you did or didn’t do, he has no right to talk to anybody that way,” Steve said as he turned to face the man waiting for them in the lobby.
So Tony stayed with him. He shared Steve’s bed and held him through the night, comforting him to sleep and reminding Steve that he wasn’t alone each time he jolted awake.
“Sort of,” Jane said quietly, watching him carefully as if trying to decide if it was really him. Ironically, it wasn’t until Steve turned his back fully that she smiled knowingly. “Yeah, that’s him alright. He works with Thor at the hospital.”
“In my time, ten seconds is nine and a half seconds longer than you live once you were face to face with Rumlow,” Steve told him coolly. “You’ve exposed him to decades of torture and isolation, feeding him only a cocktail of training to make him more violent, more heartless, and more intelligent. I will only ask one more time,” he finished with slow, biting words. “Why are you still alive?”
The thoughts kept circling through his groggy, bristling mind, and finally Steve rolled onto his back and stared up at the ceiling. He had been so near sleep a few seconds ago, but now he was wide awake with no hope of sleep in sight. There was no reason for him to be bothered about his friend having met someone and started a new relationship. He’d been happy as hell for Bucky when he and that stunt woman went from seriously dating to seriously engaged. Bucky, who’d been his friend since the first day of drama school, who Steve never went a week without texting or emailing or talking to somehow. Hell, even after he introduced Bucky and Sam on the set of
Sharon stared Phil down before he could finish his thought. “We assigned the outlines last week,” she said primly, then turned to Steve with a smug smile. “The answer is no.”
But caught as he was between the conscious and unconscious world, Tony could only lie limp and take it at Steve’s measured pace. Tony wept for begging, so desperate to free himself from the sweet, aching tension that teased and tempted him to near lunacy.
As he listened, Tony rolled to drape himself over Steve, loosely embracing him and resting his chin on Steve’s chest comfortably. He hummed in understanding and asked, “Have you had sex since you moved to Fiorera?”
After all, a kingdom could flourish without a king, but not so without compassion. After a lifetime of work and raising her own children, Agneta had left her childhood home and learned a new language for the benefit of children far away.
“Then why don’t you put me in my place, soldier?” Tony purred, then, as if by magic, he assumed the posture and presence of a self-made ne’er-do-well with a taste for purchased affection. “Forget the boyfriend experience, darling: if you give it to me hard and fast right here, right now, I’ll give you five big ones. All you have to do is make me come before anybody finds us.”
Steve stared at the cheese plate Tony had prepared and tried to parse out what that information could mean outside of Tony’s blind faith in their Governor.
Steve laughed, easily and without irony. For all that he moaned and complained, Captain America was dear to Steve, and part of his motivation for returning for the fourth installment had been that impulse to protect the franchise. But every minute spent with Tony was a lesson in how dedicated he was to developing Iron Man into a hero with a profound heart, a hero who people could love and get behind. Now, Steve would only be relieved to see Iron Man move into the fore. There was a chance he was more eager and excited to see Tony Stark top billed for the next Marvel cinematic feature than Tony himself.
“You know,” Steve said with an encouraging smile, “mixers, formals, trips to the Cape? Ways to get to know each other.”
From behind him in his room, Steve heard Maria mutter ‘typical men,’ but Natasha didn’t react either way.
For a second, Steve watched with morbid satisfaction as Tony blinked up at Natasha before finally acknowledging him again. Steve’s vindictive streak had no chance against those big brown eyes when they cried ‘put me out of my misery’ as easily as ‘please choose me.’ Even before they were dating, that look would’ve had Steve clapping him on the shoulder or pulling his friend in for a firm hug. He’d have done anything to smother Tony’s inexplicable fear that his friends don’t actually enjoy his company or his exceptional mind.
“Steve! Oh, good,” he breathed when he spotted Steve sipping bourbon by the large west-facing windows. “You’re alive, I was—god, that’s not fair,” he murmured when he noticed Steve’s beautifully tailored, dove grey suit. “Why—you packed this? Of course you packed it, it’s made for your body.”
Without a word, Tony raised his left hand - the one closest to Stephen - to bring his attention to his naked ring-finger. Stephen retaliated in action, too, bringing out a printed shot of Tony’s most ambiguous and controversial Instagram post yet.
An icy chill washed down Steve’s back, and he struggled to outwardly keep himself as calm as possible.
Steve was struggling to peel the wristbands of his gloves off with his teeth when his phone started vibrating in his gym bag.
“You told him about Montana, didn’t you?” he mumbled around his mouthful. “That’s—that’s it, isn’t it?”
He returned to Steve’s bed, and laid his head down on Steve’s pillow. It occured to Tony that soon Steve’s smell would only be a distant memory. Sleep abandoned him, and instead Tony hugged the pillow more closely, determined to indulge in every moment they had left.
Tony grunted in understanding and quietly turned to his new task. All the machinery was in place, and the broad aspects pre-programmed. Bucky already armed the pen with a sonic taser, a carbon dioxide laser, with a one time use self-destruct explosive package. Sam programmed the stinger with its GPS tracker, wings, and four total doses - two lethal, two tranquilizers. But the stinger needed to sync up with the pen’s targeting system, and it needed to find its way back to the pen fast.
,” Steve begged as Tony sucked a wet trail of hickeys down his abdomen. Whether Tony finally heard the tone of desperation in Steve’s voice, or the irrepressible thrusts of Steve’s hips gave it away, Tony gave in: he grabbed up a wrapped condom and tore it open.
Beside him, Bucky, Carol, and Sharon applauded and hollered at the top of their voice when Sam’s name was called. Carol’s wolf whistle might have even rattled eardrums. Steve quickly put his phone away to join in the ruckus, and by the time Sam made his way across the stage, accepted his degree, and completed the herd, Steve forgot about Tony’s last text.
It didn’t take much coaxing before Steve obliged him, rolling onto his side and smiling up at Tony. “You’re not dreaming, Tony,” he whispered, if a little distracted, and soon he was reaching up to run his fingers through Tony’s otherworldly bedhead before dropping his hand in Tony’s lap again.
After a long day actively engaging with others, being ‘on’ and speaking to strangers from morning through the evening, they had shut their door on the world and fell into bed together. Steve only slept on his back, so he stretched out and pulled Tony in close. They slotted together like two halves of a whole, Tony tucked under Steve’s arm and his cheek resting on Steve’s chest. Steve barely had the energy to speak anymore, but the presentations and conversations from the day had left him with so many questions. All he could do now was ask them quietly into Tony’s soft hair between chaste kisses and the absent touch of his fingers drawing figures over Tony’s back.
“Good morning, Steve, congratulations on the film! Thank you for making time for our Award Season Mashup today. I know you’re heading out soon, so. Let’s get to it. It’s been a minute since we’ve seen you on the big screen, it feels like,” Josh started with a smile as he started the recording. “And then of all movies, you step into
The woman ahead of them in line picked up her stack of books, thanked the whole collection of people who’d made the signing possible, and shuffled away with an animated bounce in her step. A helpful staff member waved them to the table and reached for a book to get the process started, except neither Steve nor Bucky were carrying a copy of the latest Stark sensation.
Graham hid his mouth behind his cards, and with a little smirk in his voice whispered, “The gentleman doth protest too much, methinks.” Then, once the laughter of the audience had died down into reasonable giggling, he continued. “There are people who have noticed you, sir, and they have devoted a whole website to the, well. To the shape of your rear.”
Steve thought he heard Tony chuckle quietly on the other end of the line, but he couldn’t be sure. “You should get some sleep, big guy,” Tony lowered his voice to say, and Steve hummed happily in answer to Tony’s deeper, softer tone. “Want me to let you go?”
“That is not fair, and you know it, Buck,” Steve said before Bucky had a chance to finish his thought. “She loves what she does, and her work matters. Not just to her, but to others.”
He left plenty of space between his caption and the picture so the picture wouldn’t pop up on Steve’s lock screen. But if he didn’t know there was a picture attached, Steve might be less inclined to respond quickly, and that was irritating. Tony glared at his phone for all the ten seconds he managed to be patient before trying something different.
Steve pushed his middle finger in all the way easily. Again Tony moaned, and again he pushed back into Steve’s touch, only growing more excited and more demanding as Steve felt around inside him, curling and thrusting his finger in turn as he searched for Tony's prostate.
“Of course it is,” Bond eventually said, his voice colder and more distant than Tony had ever heard. The line died, with no other words or explanation.
Patrick was away for a week to visit his girlfriend in Connecticut, so Steve had suggested they study for his exam in his dorm. After all, when you didn’t try to cram the entire lives of two strangers into it, his room was quite spacious. He had spent the whole morning cleaning up to get rid of that stale smell of old gym shoes and library books, but it wasn’t until Tony texted to say he had parked and would be up any minute that Steve realized he’d never be ready. This was the first time Tony was staying longer than the minute it took to introduce himself to Patrick the roommate or Steve’s friends. But this time they were planning to spend three days and two nights together ahead of Steve’s midterm, and Steve could have scrubbed the whole floor on his hands and knees and it
“Stop, please, please stop right now,” Tony mumbled through pursed lips, genuinely trying not to laugh in Steve’s face.
They talked briefly about the possibility of bringing a decorator in to re-do the bedroom until they came to the front doors of the building where a car and driver were already waiting to take Steve to the airport.
By the time they had dried off, brushed their teeth, and gotten under the covers, Steve felt like himself again. Curled under Tony’s arm and cradled against his side, Steve closed his eyes and breathed in the clean scent of his skin.
However his gamble played out, Steve was keenly aware of what he had already lost. Win or lose, he would never be able to return to this life he loved—the dream he had worked tirelessly for, and painstakingly made a reality.
“Rhodes, he’s not here,” he told Rhodey, speaking as calmly as he could for Steve’s sake. “Keep me posted.”
“I feel cold just looking at you,” Steve said under his breath, draping the blanket around his boyfriend before taking Tony’s hands in his to help warm him up by squeezing and rubbing feeling back into them. “What do you have in those bags, anyway? Is there anything left in your apartment?”
“Hey, hey sweetheart?” Steve tried in a low, gentle voice, trying to soothe Tony’s minor outrage despite the quiet laugh still lifting his voice. “Something is warming in the oven for you. Why don’t we take a look?”
“That’s it, baby. Easy,” Tony purred, his legs still stubbornly locked around Steve’s hips and he rubbed his hands across Steve’s shoulders in absent, soothing gestures as Steve came down from his high. Steve eased his weight down on top of Tony, taking comfort in his affection and gentle touch.
“Maybe it was a high school sweetheart and they just thought that’s what they had to do? It wasn’t uncommon back then,” Bucky offered as a possible theory. “Or they got pregnant and her dad insisted.”
“It’s working out, good,” Tony managed, clearing his throat one last time. “How’s he doing on the dates?”
“What do you want, double-oh-pain in my ass?” Bucky muttered down the line, his voice intermittently indistinct against a backdrop of explosions and Sam’s shouts of triumph. “You’re taking me away from the ka-booms and the ka-pows, man, this better be good.”
. Tony couldn’t believe he’d had his hands all over Steve only minutes ago, and, Lord help him, he was about to have his way with this man again.
“It’s, uh, it’s a big oven,” Steve said like a perfectly normal person might. A perfectly normal person who was very warm all of a sudden and needed a glass of water, so that’s what he did.
What had he been thinking, inviting Tony back to the apartment? His room was a mess, but worse than that,
“Short temper, yes, that’s the diet,” Steve agreed, “irritable, that’s the diet. And maybe I’m reading too much into it,” he admitted, “but I need you to know I’m not going to be upset with you if you’re angry with me.”
The lights came on all around them, and Steve sat up in alarm as Tony spun around to see a woman approach from across the living room. She was still dressed for the day in jeans and plain cotton shirt under her plaid long-sleeves. She was beautiful, and even from a distance Steve could see so much of Tony in her eyes and in her smile.
Steve laughed and whined on the same breath. “I’m still recovering, where’s your compassion?” he moaned, and he got no farther than the living room. He rolled into his big, blue velvet sofa like a well-dressed rag doll and waited for Tony to find him.
“Great!” Steve interrupted him with an air of exaggerated relief, then sat up to give Tony an impish grin. “So, Stark, was it? What’s your name?”
Tony had seen the explosions on TV. It was all anybody would talk about - nineteen fatalities, thirty-four injured, and no explanation. Some newscasters remarked how unusual it was for such an act of terror to go unclaimed, and others celebrated the great community response supporting the families of the victims in their hour of need.
He shuffled back a fraction, lowered himself until he sat mostly on Tony’s upper thighs, and thrust up. The
An uncomfortable silence stretched between them at Bruce's backhanded reply. Tony's gaze drifted from Bruce's face to the delicate golden chain around his wrist, and the golden engagement band on his right hand.
“Tony,” Steve said with a grin, gesturing to Bucky. “This is Bucky. We’ve been friends since… what was it, fifth grade?”
He slept fitfully that night only to be startled awake at the crack of dawn on Monday morning by someone pounding on his door. Disoriented and barely awake, Steve threw on some clothes and stumbled to see what had happened.
“Thirty minutes ago. I haven’t heard from anyone,” Bucky reported with intentional calm, his jaw set in his determination. He would stick to the clear facts, however scant and unsatisfying they were. “The walls must be up; there is no communication with Consone. The only message we received was from Pepper regarding Lila’s safety.”
“If you wish, you could go first,” Yinsen suggested gently, “then take the remainder of the day remotely.”
Fury’s personal secretary calling was enough to interest Steve, and he was waiting across the desk from her again by the time Sharon hung up the phone.
For the next push, he tried to raise his hips to avoid the torturous grain of Tony’s jeans against his cock, but with the changed angle of his thrust, Tony winced sharply and tensed up under his hands.
With one more parting kiss, Tony got to his feet and did as he was told. He undressed, put his clothes away, and he was easing into the hot, bubbling water when Steve caught up to him.
“That was… unexpected, but effective,” Tony managed after clearing his throat. He was a master of swallowing things, including his pride. “You saved my ass today; I could have ended up as a filler episode for Law and Order. How can I thank you?”
Before Tony finished snarking about his tragic lot in life, Steve abruptly cut him off by tugging Tony’s chair away from the desk and spinning him around. Speechless, Tony watched Steve sink to his knees between Tony’s feet.
“Why don’t you put rocks in your pockets and jump in a river?” Tony snapped, then he raised his voice to be heard over Bond’s laughing. “Command on standby. Good luck, 007.”
Steve hummed in reply, laving his tongue over the darkening bruise with a proprietary confidence. When he lifted his head at last to nuzzle at Tony’s cheek and see what he had to say, Tony couldn’t have stopped himself from smiling back if he tried.
“Thank you,” Steve answered the second year with a genuine smile and walked to where a group of his peers were settling in.
The tension of his stretch, of being folded into this position, accentuated the girth of Steve’s already thick cock, and Tony squeezed his eyes shut, whimpering and clawing at the cushions as he tried to breathe through the intrusion. A sob heaved through him again; he had been so close to release and now it was almost too much and too little all at once—his whole body had been singing moments earlier, excitement and pleasure tickling down his spine and everywhere Steve touched him, but now his entire world had narrowed down to the heavy, unyielding pressure stretching him apart and leaving him no space to breathe.
As if by magic, Steve and Natasha had acquired a giant pretzel each, and like the curious imps they could be, they were watching the competition begin as if it was the most exciting game in history.
“You,” Tony whispered, clearly a little surprised. “We’re doing brunch tomorrow, you won’t… won’t you get ...you know. Get tired?”
He gestured accusatively at the fridge again, where sure enough, Steve had stocked up on chocolate cake, chocolate milk, whipped cream, pounds of bacon, pop tarts, and a mostly-finished sour cherry cheesecake.
“Don't move. Do not touch yourself,” he warned him in a low rumble, then, to Tony’s dismay, Steve got up and walked away. Tony stared after him, barely restraining himself from moaning his frustration in Steve’s absence. His cock ached and throbbed, and soon he needed to reach back to clutch at the couch cushions if he was going to resist touching himself.
“I guess I should thank you for unveiling the secret here with us,” Carol teased him after a needed hug. “I couldn’t have asked for better publicity, people will be talking about the Initiative for weeks because of you.”
, Steve. I was,” he insisted, lowering his voice to a gentler tone. “You asked me for a second chance yesterday. I’m asking you for a second chance today.”
Tony turned towards Jane now that she finally addressed Tony directly, and the fear in the young officer’s eyes hit him like a punch in the gut. He wanted so badly to say he had been wrong, that it had only been a figment of barbaric 21st century imagination. That no man could devastate countless innocent lives for petty ambitions such as revenge or greed.
“I was writing today. Editing, actually,” Tony corrected himself with mischief bright in his eyes. “The scene you helped me with last week.”
“I will give you some time to collect yourself, Tony,” Dr. Odinson said in his low, soothing rumble, before turning to Steve. “You have already said that this is your first serious relationship, Steve. You care enough about Tony to attend couples therapy. Could you tell me what it is about Tony that made you interested in pursuing a relationship?”
“It’s none of my business, I know, honey,” she quickly said to Steve, who was feeling increasingly uncomfortable by the conversation. Instead, Sarah turned to Bucky with a meaningful look and told him, “Set him straight, James.”
They made it back to Steve’s (Sarah’s) apartment without too much time spent ducking into allies to kiss each other breathless, going the wrong way because they were too busy walking without paying attention, or pretending they were respectable people when they inevitably had to take the subway back. Steve unlocked the door and reminded Tony to be quiet since his mom was asleep before letting Tony in ahead of him.
“Captain Steven G. Rogers, you could not possibly be suggesting that we voluntarily wade through the unrecyclable garbage and unholy excrement of an entire city.”
Steve kept his thoughts to himself, and instead tried to focus on Tony in the moment. With the advantage of the warm water around them to help Tony’s body relax, Steve smoothed his hands down Tony’s back more firmly, rubbing gentle circles down his spine. Even with a superficial touch, Steve could feel the knots of tension all across Tony’s back, and especially over his mid to lower back from the constant strain of sitting at his desk.
Steve watched color rising in Tony’s cheeks as he stared down at him. Unbidden, Steve found himself marveling at the affection and warmth in Tony’s beautiful brown eyes. His breath caught in his throat at the odd thought about his friend, and he probably should panic or run away or call his therapist, but Tony turned his blushing face into the couch cushion and groaned.
Tony bit at his lip in an effort to quiet himself, but it was no use. He groaned softly under his breath, sinking further into his seat while palming his cock through his jeans.
Steve stopped dead in his tracks. He’d recognize that body anywhere. Could the world really be so small?
“A laudable choice, Tony Stark,” Jane agreed, though she still seemed shaken by the mere suggestion of the ghastly Führer. “His name is one to be forgotten, without exception.”
“Procreation is conducted in the lab,” Tony told him matter of factly, turning to face him only to find Steve inches from his face again. He gasped in surprise, then tried to regain his calm to explain. “Fluids are purified, screened, and transferred by authorized medical personnel. For the mother’s safety, children are grown in incubation chambers at medical facilities, where the parents can monitor their growth and visit their children at every stage. It is a peaceful, healthy, and painless procedure.”
“Thank you, Your Honor,” he heard Tony saying on his way back to the bedroom, and Steve quickly scraped the sheets and duvet around his lap before Tony came in. “Yes, Your Honor, and not a minute later.”
It was easier than expected to leave the crime scene unnoticed, and as Steve had guessed, even easier for Bucky to break into Tony’s brownstone. They started in the living room where Steve showed Bucky the table that had been their alter, but they both quickly agreed that at that time of night, there was no clear view of Tony’s dining room without special equipment. The chances that someone would be lying in wait for hours or days with the right tools and with the right angle to see the dining table were too slim.
Tony took a deep breath, then slowly let it out through his nose. “I don’t mean to blame my actions on others. This was my fault, I know that. I can only promise that there is nothing and nobody that could make me make that mistake again. I don’t know how to prove it to you without a chance to show you, except to say, on Rhodey’s life, I will not keep important things from you again.”
Sharon spun on her heels to stare at him with wide-eyed excitement. “We did not requisition hoverbikes, Tony,” she whispered urgently.
But Tony wasn’t the convenient type of genius who was socially unaware; too many excuses, and he would see right through Steve’s avoidance. A vindictive thought slithered through his mind, pushing Steve to accept that it could be that easy. Give him enough excuses, and Tony would do the dirty work for him. Leave the crumbs out, and once Tony understood he was no longer welcome, Tony would pull away on his own. And at the end of the day, who could blame Steve for protecting himself?
Slowly, Steve pushed himself up on his knees. He wiped a hand as clean as he could in the grass around them, then tried to clear out his eyes so he could take a look around them. Before he had to wonder if anyone had noticed them breaking into the country and whether he’d need to discuss border control with Tony in the future, he saw a dozen armed soldiers on horseback making their way up the craggy, inhospitable mountainside.
“Maybe Justin can be that guy for you,” she said softly, “you won’t know unless you give him a chance. One date won’t hurt. We could even do a double—”
Those pockets of time slowly grew to include more than just a weekend, and by the third month, Steve had practically moved in with Tony in his new condo close to campus. During the day Steve had his classes and Tony worked, and in the evenings they found other ways to occupy their time - some nights that meant going to local performances or pub trivia, while other nights that meant staying in with a bottle of champagne and a rigged game of strip poker.
Bond laughed shamelessly. Water ran in the background, and Tony could picture the agent preparing a shower. “I like you,” he said, “what’s your name?”
President of 1919-1921, Edith Wilson), but he, too, wanted to make the most of Tony’s time in office.
CERN had invited Tony to visit as part of a handful of engineers and physicists they wanted to wine and dine for future collaborations. While it was a genuine honor to be recognized as a leader in his field already, Tony was the only one in the group who hadn’t been driving when the Jackson 5 were still a thing.
Thankfully, Rhodey’s preemptive consideration paid off big-time, because when Steve showed up unannounced at the youth center, Rhodey was waiting. He was the one who stood in the doorway and told him that Tony had moved on, and that if Steve hurt him again, Rhodey will make him regret it.
Steve made it far in the hammer throw competition, and then to Tony’s endless relief, he was quickly eliminated in the caber toss. They spent the next hour or two wandering through the crowds, and Steve comforted himself with roast lamb and a platter of grilled peaches and figs with ice cream for all his effort and losses. They paused here to watch young children competing in agility courses with their bunnies, and there to see the older kids doing the same with their dogs.
“What about the Constitution!” Tony shouted just as Steve slipped into the room. “What, are they so busy justifying the second amendment that they just skipped over the first? This is fundamentally un-American, Chief, how could you let—”
“Why’d you stop there?” he wondered when Steve let him keep his t-shirt on. He kicked off his boots and trailed Steve into the kitchen, where he accepted the cup of hot tea Steve pressed into his hand without question.
The months that followed were their happiest days. The kingdom celebrated the happy news widely, and gifts poured in from far and wide for the mother-to-be. Nobody could have known then how the long-awaited birth of their future king would end the life of their beloved young Queen.
That was when he felt it: the twist of the wrist that dropped the canister into place. Tony sobbed openly in his relief at the familiar blunt pressure of the canister head pressing against his throbbing hole, knowing that as soon as the canister was fully fucked into his body, his starved body would finally be satisfied, the hollow ache deep in his body finally chased away. Just a little longer, all he had to do was hold on a little longer, and he would get his fucking and he would have made his master proud, he’d make Steve so proud of him.
Steve gritted his teeth and glared up at the ceiling with a vengeance. How had his life come to this, a choice between helping his friend and preserving his goddamn dignity?
“What the hell is that?” he muttered under his breath, indulging in deep breaths of the sweet, citrusy flavor warming the air.
Cold or not, the eggs tasted better than anything he had eaten in a long, long time. The very best part about the eggs was that Stephanie had made them for him, and he cherished every bite.
Steve facepalmed and tried to muffle his whine of embarrassment, but Tony must have heard him anyway.
Sharon rolled her eyes, but she came around the workbench all the same to plant herself next to him and open her laptop in front of him.
“Turnips! My favorite,” the voice said, and Tony turned and stared. Stared, because there was a short, fat donkey licking eagerly at his plate.
“No,” she whispered as her eyes grew wide in dismay, and she and Clint both stared at her as a golden light shone from within her chest like a bright, white star until it consumed her entirely.
“When I was a student? Yes, that was before I was a lesbian; I was still sorting myself out, as you do at university,” she started, answering thoughtfully and fearlessly in a way Steve rarely witnessed in Hollywood. “I was on my bike and we stopped at the traffic lights, where there to my left or right, whatever it was, there was a car; an open car with an American soldier inside. And something crazy took hold of me then. You know that feeling,” she added, looking to Rob on her left and Tony to her right.
“That’s why there’s two of us,” Steve teased, whispering the words into Tony’s hair before pressing a kiss to Tony’s temple. “You’re the genius, and I’m the iron man.”
But what truly unnerved him was the silence. He couldn’t hear anything or anyone around him—not even the ever-present bustle of their living, breathing city. The only window he could see in any direction was a small, circular window near the ceiling, but it was too dark to tell if the distant sparks of light were from stars or tall buildings.
As much as the students wanted to impress Tony, however, it was usually Steve whom they gravitated to in their excitement. Steve couldn’t ask detailed technical questions, but instead he was curious to know how they’d even started to think about their project. When one little girl admitted she’d gotten into laser technology because it was the only way to get back at her brother for cutting her ponytails off, Steve had spluttered with laughter and high-fived her for revenge well done. One teenager had authored a history of food in old Machtberg on her own, going back to the earliest known settlers before the Middle Ages and how each distinct wave of immigration affected the food culture of their country all to disprove her father’s theory that burgers didn’t exist in Consone before the arrival of American veterans following World War II. Unfortunately, she had only proved her father right, but also brought to light many exciting and unexpected effects of the food immigrants brought with them on the kingdom, the biggest of which was the expansion of agriculture through unification. Steve had spent nearly an hour listening as she pointed to different components of their dinner and talked about how pistachios had once been accepted as currency because of their rarity, or how an inadvertent consequence of World War I was that mare’s milk became preferable to cow’s milk in Machtberg.
“Darling, I’m sure they’re the best quality,” Tony said in a patient voice that made it clear he was trying pretty hard not to laugh. “But designer gloves aren’t made for working barbed wire fences. Now, keep this on, would you?” he added, dropping a wide-brim cattleman hat on Steve’s head.
Tony tilted his head to the side in thought, then peered at Steve curiously. “Listen to them talk about it, or talk to them about it?”
“Another night to savor the dream, Natasha,” he murmured, a softly growled whisper that warmed her cheek before he sealed it with a tender brush of his lips over the corner of her smile.
It was only a few minutes past four in the morning, not that that mattered anymore either. He thumbed at his phone with clumsy fingers, found Pepper’s contact, and called her. When she didn’t pick up the first or second or third time, he climbed out of bed, threw on his robe and walked across the hall to bang on her door.
“This is some Mission Impossible shit,” Rhodey whispered, reaching to touch the skin with respectful care. After all, this was one of Tony’s prototypes. “I can’t believe you made this—”
“You are breathtaking,” he heard Tony murmur up at the dragon with great reverence and tenderness, and Clint’s stomach roiled in horrified despair. Tony was already lost, there was no chance for him now; Clint should turn and run while he still had the freedom to save himself.
Tony pulled away from under Steve’s arm so he could sit facing Steve on the couch. As Steve straightened to return his attention, Tony took Steve’s hands in his and brought them to his lips, kissing the back of his hands one after another. “May we have this a little longer, Steve? We have the rest of our lives to give to duty and to our people. Can we have this year for ourselves?”
“Is that what you want?” Steve wondered, shifting a little in his seat to face Tony better. Tony kept his eyes on the road, but his frown made it clear he was confused by the question. “A family? Maybe some goats.”
Tony was dying, crying and giggling breathlessly. “Oh my, my fucking—Mean Girls?! I just can’t, I fucking love you, this is, uh. It’s, uh.”
Steve dug around for his Size A needles and carried the wool and his needles with him as he inspected the rest of the apartment. The bathroom was as spartan and clinical as he could had feared, but Tony had gone out of his way to provide tissues on the counter to replace the three seashells. The kitchen was spotless and the fridge was well stocked with both ready-made meals and some groceries. A jar of honey sat on his counter alongside a big bowl of walnuts. Nothing else had been placed out for him, but he ignored it for now and grabbed a bottle of water to take along.
“Uh, no—stop laughing,” Steve grumbled, though a blush was creeping up his neck and undermining his whole expression. “I do things when I don’t work! I, uh.”
“Steve Rogers, how certain are you of this decision?” Tony whispered, looking at Steve with a grim expression.
And it didn’t hurt that Steve couldn’t stop smiling. He leaned in close and kissed Tony’s cheek before cupping his face gently in his hands and kissing his lips. Tony melted into him and (much too soon) decided to forgive Steve for his underhanded bargaining.
For those unfamiliar with Cooper Union, it is an incredible and a historic institution of the arts in New York City that's been there since 1859. It's relevant in the context of this story because
“Yes, mom,” they chorused, and turned their horses around, riding off in the direction of the east lake.
“Outside Porto Seguro, Brazil,” Bond replied. “Mansion, new money. No class; Persian rugs in the bathroom aren’t even hand-woven.”
Antonovich was a ghost. His neighbors hadn’t seen him for weeks, and his credit cards and his cell phone showed no signs of activity since late October. Steve put out an APB, but Long Island City was out of his jurisdiction. Even with the local precinct's cooperation, it felt wrong not to be directly involved in the hunt. His previous crimes had only been days apart, and Steve could feel time slipping through his fingers. He needed this bastard caught before three victims became four or five or six.
Tony was so lost in the hypothetical paradise Steve was painting for him that he took a wrong turn somewhere. He was quiet for a while, thinking over Steve’s words a few times before leaning back and giving him a weird look. “Brooklyn—your
“Alright, sure,” Tony said with a smile. Why not? Who would look for him in the children’s room, and he needed some way to pass thirty minutes. When had a life decision been as easy as puppy therapy or no puppy therapy? Or was it an adult dog? He looked at the dog more curiously, then reached out to pet its head.
“Yeah,” Tony lied, because the truth would probably end their conversation, and Tony would take that beautiful smile (or those glorious biceps) over two dozen overzealous teenagers any day.
,” he told them, doing his best to sound like an adult whose heart hadn't just broken over a puppy’s hurt feelings.
If his head wasn’t spinning already, Tony might have hung on to that thought - to the realization that Steve was coaching another creature on how to fondle him, how to turn him on, how to fuck his ass open for a successful harvest. In his sorry state, the thought alone was enough to unravel his last defenses. Instead, he pressed his face into the cushions and did his best to make Steve proud, to lie still and mimic a sleeping boy as best as he could while the student timidly finger-fucked him.
Steve slipped his hand quickly under the blanket to pick up the canister, and with the same care that he entered the room, he slipped out through Tony’s closet door to return to his own world.
“Vegas it is,” he rasped, his voice pitched noticeably deeper after the kiss. Steve felt himself grow weak in the knees, twitching and aching all over for Tony’s attention.
“Well… I can only eat that once,” Steve pointed out, and as a reflex, Tony slapped him through his laughter. But as they passed an unassuming set of mail boxes, he sobered up and cleared his throat.
Tony hesitated for a moment, glanced at Steve with a considering look, then quietly said, “A younger brother. He’s back at home. He likes the ranch life better than I ever did.”
Tony gave him a quizzical look, but rather safe than sorry, he leafed through his papers to compare the marriage and prenuptial agreements against her license. He turned around in his seat and Steve immediately leaned in closer to hear.
“You’re having the wedding here,” she told him, smiling with the satisfaction of a woman who only allowed people to agree with her. “Go get dressed dear, we’ve got work to do! I’ll go get Howard’s pocketbook.”
“If I read one more script about soldiers or police officers or special agents, I’m going to scream.”
“Don’t even joke about that,” Steve grunted between panting breaths, and he could feel Tony’s answering laugh vibrating against his chest. He moaned plaintively, pressing sloppy, lingering kisses across Tony’s chest as he nosed his way to the elegant, unblemished column of Tony’s neck.
“I looked at four estates here, a condo in San Francisco, a beach house in Malibu, and the two rings that had sapphires—”
Tony spun around to face him with a beaming smile, until he must have realized it wasn’t appropriate. Steve watched as Tony ducked his head for just a moment under the guise of rubbing his nose, then looked up at Steve with a more contained expression.
“I’m still here, Tony,” Steve heard himself say. Tony’s gaze snapped back up to Steve with a strictly focused attention to hang on his every word. “We can be friends, I think. I, I just need time. To adjust. This hasn’t been easy.”
It was easy to stay organized with the structure Pepper had developed over the years. Over the next several hours, Tony and the two detectives pored over box after box of nasty fan letters, only coming up for breath when lunch arrived, courtesy of Tony Stark. He hadn’t known what to get, so he’d ordered a little of everything - Chinese, pizza, sushi - but he’d made sure to include the one universal police food: powdered jelly donuts.
In the center of the room there was a wide, sturdy platform covered in soft, plump, resilient cushions. There was a sleek contraption hovering inches above the platform cushions, but it looked more complicated than anything Steve used on Tony at home. The mechanical arms that loaded and pumped the canisters were also absent, so it was difficult to imagine which was the front end or even which way was up.
Steve smiled back brightly, feeling himself sit up taller in his seat. While it seemed the other first-years were less hostile in this environment, he was deeply grateful to have a friend on the team.
Steve shook his head, and Tony quieted immediately. He looked so shamefaced and wrung out that Steve worried he’d cry any second. Steve closed the space between them in two quick steps and reached to comb his fingers through Tony’s hair. The soft, gentle waves of his hair were too weighed down with grease and grime from the lab to slide through Steve’s fingers like they always would, and Steve’s heart broke at the thought of how badly Tony had misjudged time.
“It’s the first website that pops up when you Google gay sugar daddy,” Tony said, his words slowing the more he thought about the complication Sam brought up. “I’ll see if Preston was a past or current member on other services.”
All this time that he’d been so stubbornly against marriage, Steve silently kept his ring. He had wanted to marry him, but he’d respected Tony’s decision - Steve had denied himself something that clearly meant a lot to him out of respect for Tony’s opinion, and here Tony had strong-armed him into sharing something private and sensitive out of misdirected jealousy.
“Tony, I don’t—hey, hey, Tony? It’s going to be okay. Sweetheart, it’s not even two weeks. I know it’s a big step and it feels like a big change, but we’ll—we have all summer to think of something. You always think of something,” he added with a smile in his gentle, calming voice. “And if I have to commute, I will. Plan Z maybe, but, at least it’s there. Okay? Everything will be okay. We will be okay.”
“Again: Not believing a word until I see it myself,” Tony reminded his impish friend. His damn lucky friend.
Tony stopped dead in his tracks on the threshold of Steve’s bedroom, and heaved a slow, measured breath. Then, he took two more steps, and five more, and three more, until he pulled the covers back and (less than gently) dumped Steve into bed.
Steve’s icy glare spoke volumes of his irritation and his anger. “This is not a negotiation, Colonel,” he growled in a whisper. “This is a direct order from your king. There is no man I trust more to ensure my husband’s safety than you, no man he trusts more. We will depend on you to defend the kingdom while we rest. I will depend on you to keep my husband safe. So, I will repeat it for you: take your team. Take Bucky. Get out of my sight.
“I can’t answer that!” Steve insisted, but the way he refused to meet Tony’s eyes seemed be enough of an answer.
In the honeyed limbo between consciousness and sleep, Tony felt his weightless limbs drifting apart. He felt drunk on the memory of Steve all around him - the scent of Steve’s body filling his senses, the familiar touch of his lips teasing an old bruise on Tony’s neck. All Tony needed now was for those memories to to fill more than just his senses. What he wouldn’t give to feel Steve’s weight bearing down on him, anchoring him in this lonely, intangible world. The smell of his skin, the touch of his lips weren’t enough; Tony sobbed with the need to be filled, to be fucked, to be reminded of the man he belonged to in every other way.
Thor and Yinsen looked as surprised as the rest of the staff to hear Tony speak up. Tony arched an eyebrow at the dry, questioning looks he was being given, and valiantly continued.
“I’ll text you at lunch,” Steve promised, bringing one of Tony’s hands up to kiss the back of his hand. “Have a good night, Tony. I can’t wait to see you tomorrow.”
Steve had no ulterior motive, no ego to feed. Steve wore his heart on his sleeve, and he was that reliable, self-less source of comfort and guidance Tony was only ever grateful to follow.
Rachel spoke so quickly that Tony barely caught on to what she was saying. He wasn’t sure if it was the sleep deprivation or if she was on something, but in a brief moment of lucidity, he wondered if maybe he should have taken Steve up on the offer to do this solo. Between the plane ride, his night with his handsome English lothario the night before, and the long days in New York before that, Tony wasn’t really firing on all cylinders anymore. Maybe it wasn’t too late to say yes—
“Anyone ever tell you,” Steve whispered, brushing his fingers through Tony’s hair, “that you are gorgeous first thing in the morning?”
Tony’s eyes slid shut as he listened to Steve’s voice and lost himself to the slow, hypnotic touch of his hand. Hundreds of eyes on him, on his splayed, debauched body. An object for them to study until they could make his body perform like any instrument of pleasure. Steve would reveal the secrets of his body to all these strangers like it was a diagram to learn, a roadway to his erogenous zones, his most intimate desires. Steve would demonstrate how to work his ass open, gradually and so very carefully, so a human would not wake during the harvesting.
Time stood still as he cast around desperately for something to say, until he noticed his dog. His poor, sweet Marple looked miserable. Her head drooped in a guilty show of submission, her ears were pressed back against her head even as she blinked up at Tony with pleading eyes. If dogs could weep, there’d be tear tracks down her soft, ginger muzzle.
More than that, the palace was never as alive as when it hosted dozens of children and teenagers. It wasn’t unheard of for the palace to receive guests, but there was something special about the joy and exuberance that children brought with them. Maybe it was because they didn’t feel the pressure to act sensible and level-headed the way adults did. Since their presentations were in the mornings, the students had a full audience of leading experts in their fields, family, and their kings. It was treat to watch the enthusiasm bright in their eyes when their ideas and projects were praised, especially when someone took the time to explain the value of their contribution and described how their little school projects could be folded into a bigger vision and lead to remarkable changes.
“Call Happy,” he told Jarvis quietly as he watched the girls walking through the library, inevitably closing the distance between them.
“Oh, crap—I know this,” he murmured to himself, and Tony stared as Steve racked his brain for the answer. “It was… it was Julián something. Julián de los Santos?”
They shared a taxi to Steve’s place, which was about midway between Wayne Tower and Tony’s apartment. But when Steve climbed out, Tony asked the driver to wait and followed him out to the curb.
“That’s what I was doing, too,” he explained once he had his nervous laughter under control. “I, uh,” he held up the Hostess box in a helpless gesture. “I eat when I’m nervous. Here, have one; save me from myself.”
They both knew Tony didn’t believe in an afterlife, just like they both knew Steve did. In the early days it had been a source of frustration, but Steve had learned that the idea of an all-powerful creator made Tony uncomfortable in the same way Tony understood how after watching thousands of young soldiers wasted away in battle, it brought Steve peace to think it wasn’t for nothing. Now, Tony only smiled when Steve spoke of his faith. Whether he believed it was true did not deny the intended sentiment.
Steve, who was already in the process of buttoning up his jeans and buckling his belt into place, came back to bed to stand between Tony’s knees. He didn’t patronize Tony with an answer, and instead leaned in to give him a kiss on the forehead, then another kiss on the cheek.
Steve kept it simple: a machine with a collecting canister attached on a piston rod, and an adjustable sleeve that could be fitted over a hard cock or a fist to simultaneously harvest and inject from Tony’s body directly to the wearer. The sleeve cut out any intervening process, and allowed whoever was fucking the human to mainline his hormones directly, making Tony irresistible—and, most importantly, priceless.
Tony quickly held up one finger to ask Bruce for some time, and returned to his call. “Be well, happy Warden Harold Hogan. As my Monday duty log irrationally requires it, I am hereby querying you on the prison population update. Does the tedium continue?”
Steve wasn’t sure if his ears were playing tricks on him, or if he’d genuinely heard the suggestion that Tony was on the market. His heart skipped a beat, and distantly, Steve hoped and prayed and wished he wasn’t already sweating in his premature excitement.
Tony blinked up at him, surprised but pleasantly so. He had felt that Bucky’s competitive side came from a good place, but he was blindsided by what that could mean - how rare it might be, or how it would affect his Steve. Emotions he wasn’t ready for rose in his throat, and it was by sheer will power that he pulled it together. After all, they were still in public.
To his left, Tony whimpered in muted horror. He hurried to clear his throat and to address Steve in a strict, businesslike tone.
“Yes!” Tony cheered just as the lights went down. He enjoyed his popcorn and his drink, and even if he was a little louder than the average person, Steve didn’t find it too difficult to ignore the sounds of Tony’s slurping and munching.
A loud knocking on the door woke Steve the next morning before his alarm ever had a chance to ring. Sluggish and still disorientated from sleep, Steve stumbled out of the bedroom, through the sitting room, and down the hall to the front door.
“You said you liked honesty,” Steve reminded him, a touch bashful. He knew it was unusual, but Tony wanted honesty, and wasn’t that the whole point he was trying to make? “Sex is kind of easy, one-night stands, whatever. Spending time with someone, listening to them, remembering what they say… that takes effort. And for someone like me? My life is my job, I’m away for business a lot. The effort feels pointless. I can’t plan a future, I can’t make any promises, and that’s never been a problem. Until you. The more I learn about you, Tony - how clever you are, how you treat people in need who have no business asking you for help - the more I want to know.”
When Tony eyed him skeptically, as if Steve’s choice was a test, Steve smiled and added, “Go have fun, Tony. I’ve got my phone on by the bed, call if you need anything? Anything, and I’ll be there.”
Steve cupped his face in his big, gentle hands, brushing his tears away and bringing him back to the present. “You know how lucky I’ve got to be to find someone who understands? It’s not… there’s no point, it’s not a pity parade. I haven’t thought of myself as a victim, Tony, I never did. I never could. I’m one of the lucky few with a second chance, and I worked my ass off to get it. I just never thought I’d find someone who could… understand what that means.”
Clint stared at his dad as if he couldn’t quite believe his ears, and Maria whispered across the table in warning, but Howard seemed apathetic to their scrutiny.
“You should thank your dog,” Mr. Perfect said with another breath-taking smile. “She found me on the trail and herded me back to you.”
“A week,” Sharon interrupted in a rush, and she barely managed to keep speaking when she felt Steve freeze beside her. “The paperwork, sir, I—it will take two weeks to go through, but, but Mr. Rogers hasn’t taken his vacation days for three years, I think it could be—”
“Human trafficking, Houston,” Sam said in return as they took over each other’s stations. “Bond lost Lucy to Vargas in a card game.”
“You’re such an asshole,” Tony laughed shamelessly, but as his laughter eased to a chuckle, he quietly said, “Hey, it’s really late over there. I’ll let you go. We’ll catch up soon, alright?”
“Prophylactics,” Tony corrected mildly and with a straight face, reacting only by nodding in encouragement. “Your mother is a very intelligent woman, and so are you. Keep it up.”
Steve chuckled, bowing his head to nuzzle at the crown of Tony’s head. “You can undress me all you like, as—”
Steve glanced around them anxiously, crouching even lower to make sure nobody could see him from the door or through the lone little window of Clint’s cell.
He glanced at Tony, but the visceral sympathy and heartache on Tony’s face only made Steve more uncomfortable. A part of him wanted to shout at him that he wasn’t that weird—he was just a foster kid. There were over four-hundred thousand of those in United States alone, and that was by conservative estimates. He wasn’t some freak to pity.
Steve and Tony had decided early on not implement direct changes to the cultural traditions of their united people. The freedom to practice any custom or religion that did not actively vilify or harm others was protected, but the rest was left to individuals and local government. There was only one exception.
“Greetings Lieutenant Robert B. Banner, Lieutenant Anthony E. Stark,” Jane said with a formal salut in the doorway to their office. “Chief Director Nicholas Fury requests your presence at the Cryo-Prison for Captain America’s temporary reinstatement.”
Steve rolled his eyes, but rather than answering him, he stepped back into his hotel room, leaving the door wide open in his wake as a giant hint for Tony to follow. It wasn’t long before Tony stepped into the room and let the door fall shut behind him.
There was a moment of chaos where Steve and Rumlow fought like animals on the floor, Pierce leapt from his chair at Ben, and the Scraps either bolted from the room or dropped to the floor to avoid accidentally being shot as Ben and Pierce fought over the gun.
“And they will have that chance, Mrs. Hansen,” Natasha promised her in a gentle tone as Mrs. Hansen fought back tears. She offered their client tissues and gave her a moment’s peace before continuing. “We will do our best to make this as painless as possible, and soon you and your children will have every opportunity to begin a better life together.”
If circumstances had been different, Steve would only look forward to telling Tony all about his first day over dinner. Instead, he was stuck staring into his wardrobe dreading what to wear. Tony always loved him in blue, and he was very partial to green or black. Blue would look like Steve was trying too hard, like he purposefully wanted to peacock for Tony.
“Clint?” Tony asked for his brother, turning to find him. When he saw Clint talking to the Reverend a few yards away, he called his name and waved him over. “I need a witness, get over here!”
She pursed her lips, then with a huff she hung her head and groaned. “Whatever,” she muttered. “Genius.”
“I only had one partner at the time,” Tony reasoned, but he sat up to enjoy the view of Steve’s back and backside. Those firm, glorious shoulders, that tapered waist—hell, that
“I’ve never seen someone turn that shade of red before in my life!” Tony gasped between breathless giggling, wiping tears from his eyes. “My god, that was good, that—that was gold, Jesus.”
Steve scrunched up his nose, clearly unimpressed. “No,” he decided. “That’s kind of outrageous, but no, Tony. I know you. You can do better than that.”
“Sorry! Shit, sorry,” Tony rushed to say while Bruce plastered himself to Tony’s back and giggled madly into his shoulder. “It’s only water, it shouldn’t stain or—damn,” he muttered when he couldn’t even find a packet of tissues in his jacket pockets. “I’m sorry, man.”
“I… beg your pardon?” Tony whispered, and glancing down, he realized Steve had steered them to a manhole cover near the Governor’s building.
Clint perked up, and briefly paused in rubbing her arms through the quilt to ask, “Yeah? What’s that?”
Tony’s low moan turned into a quiet, throaty laugh. He combed his fingers through Steve’s hair, then gave it a tug at the end to make him look up. “Is that what you want, Sparky? Want me to ride you like a bull? Turn you into a boneless mess?”
Steve’s confidence and focus started to fade as Tony got to his feet to stare back at him, face to face.
“Really?” Steve asked after a beat, and Tony might have enjoyed the look of naked confusion on his otherwise composed, professional face, but he found he genuinely liked the question.
Across the sky the stars and the water all became one, smoothed under the cool moonlight. Steve remembered those last, desperate seconds when instinct took over and his eyes slipped shut, and as the pleasure consumed him, thundering through his parched body and brought him back to life, Tony pulled his hands free to cradle Steve’s face like a treasure, chasing his uneven gasps with tender, loving lips until Steve forgot about all the world and the light around them and lost himself in Tony’s soft lips and breathless kisses.
Without moving from his comfortable home in Steve’s arms, Tony asked, “Doesn’t your mom have a ring?”
But Steve couldn’t relax; he couldn’t even speak. When Tony inevitably pulled his cheeks apart, exposing Steve’s hole in a way no-one had in more than a decade, Steve’s whole body went tense, involuntarily clenching in anticipation of the inevitable, blunt pressure of a cock breaching him.
“You wish,” Paulette scoffed quietly as she pulled apart a blueberry cake donut and pointed one end at Steve. “She’s gonna skin you first, and then if you’re lucky she’ll kill you.”
And just like that, something more pressing than sleeping stirred in Steve’s body. Before Tony noticed, he pulled away and promised to be back soon. He straddled the rim of the cold, porcelain tub and counted backwards from fifty while he brushed his teeth, but neither attempt did much to cool him off.
Tony did his best to keep the vibrator inside Steve through his sudden orgasm, leaving it to massage and milk his prostate to the last drop before easing it out of Steve’s slack body with care.
“I am,” Tony said with a wry twist of his lips, but he couldn’t quite meet Steve’s eyes when he said it. “It’s been so long, and, well, eating sugar makes me sick. I’m sorry, Steve. It’s… it’s fucking gorgeous, I can’t tell you how badly I want to eat it.”
Stephen grinned like the fanboy he was and listened eagerly, loving this personal ‘inside scoop’ of what Steve Rogers was like. “So, like, you never have fights?”
. But, we heard you had a tough flight here,” Karl said with his cheerful smile, “so we thought instead of the regular show, we’d switch it up a little. Now, we had you answer some questions before you came on stage,” he trailed off with meaning, and Tony cringed.
Steve laughed and told him to eat slower, that there was plenty more if he wanted thirds or fourths. Then he told Tony about his day, about Pamela, the Marine who Steve was helping regain dexterity and control of her right hand, and Trey, the music teacher who was recovering from recent back surgery. Steve worked with the same clients on a weekly basis, and he often learned about their lives and families in the process. Tony had never met these people, but through Steve, they felt like good friends.
Steve squeezed his eyes shut and tried to calm himself. He medaled in the NCAA, he could fucking do this. All he needed to do was focus. Words were arbitrary, completely and absolutely pointless except for the socially constructed meaning applied to them. It just so happened that some people used this word to mean a violent, territorial fighting machine, while Steve used it to have a good time.
liked it,” Steve promised him, sounding achingly sincere for someone who Tony knew was so bored and done with the day. “For a movie on this scale, I think we really needed another hero. Not someone secondary or someone who’d bend over every time he heard Captain America said so. Then for this hero to be someone like Iron Man, I think we’re—we owe a lot to the writing team. He’s not the creation of a German scientist, Iron Man is what and who he is by his own doing, he’s… he’s a hero we can all aspire to be more like. You don’t have to be a billionaire genius to be a hero, but sometimes you can just look around and think, what can I do to make this world a better place?”
“That’s—no! That’s not how that works! Don’t you hear yourselves? Toxic fucking masculinity, why do I even talk to you two?” Tony muttered, but before he could continue, he was interrupted by his ringtone. When he saw the name on the display, he gave both Thor and Bruce stern looks, then picked up.
“What if,” Steve said more slowly, wetting his lips as he imagined his wish coming true. “What if I wanted to kiss you?”
“Wait. Last Thursday?” Carol said slowly, shocked and mildly upset, like Tony had told her Pluto really wasn’t the ninth valid planet in the solar system. “Tony, Steve got you that in college. We were all there. If you didn’t know about it, where has it been?”
The tunnels of the sewer system were vast, unclean, and inhospitable. What the Scraps had done by laying down plans to create space where there was none, then filled it with families and little business fronts, was nothing short of the miracle Tony had been told of New Yorseylvania all his life.
“Help yourself, it’s too much for me anyway,” Tony promised, and who was Steve to ever decline mac and cheese? Tony carved up the last of the chicken and put half on Steve’s plate before pulling up his own stool.
“Right. Sure,” Tony agreed agreeably, not unlike how Steve had agreed to hand over his credit card in the too-recent past. He turned to their grinning audience of three with a pointedly serious look. “Got anything for me to do?”
Steve’s assurance never failed to calm Tony’s worst fears. They had had this conversation many times before, and Tony had heard variations of the same answer so many times he could practically recite Steve’s answer from memory. But whatever the reason - the light from sunset reaching their kitchen just right, Steve’s crossed arms in his unbuttoned Henley - the ring around Steve’s neck caught the light just right and caught his attention.
