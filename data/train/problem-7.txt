“I went back to my sister, and she told me there’d been two geese with black tails. Two! I demanded to know where the other way, which surely had the stone in it, and she told me she’d sold them all to that Breckinridge. I ran just as fast as my feet could carry me to the market, but it was too late! He’d sold them too, and not a word he’ll breathe of where or to whom. My sister thinks I’ve gone mad. Sometimes I think I must be. What else must I be—I have branded myself a thief, and for what? I shall never ever touch the riches for which I’ve sold my character. God help me!”
“Then you are very much in luck! Mrs. Burns is roasting a goose for us tonight. A most unimpeachable Christmas goose, at that.”
It was a silly idea, thought Watson at first, running a line between their bedrooms–a children’s game. But whenever the nights grew lonely, he was grateful for the rattle of the tin can against the window. Pressed against his ear, the best he could make out was a garbled echo that he knew meant: “I love you.”
“How awful, too. This man Horner has a previous conviction—another shall be a very dark mark against him, indeed.”
Thanks as always for reading, commenting, and leaving kudos!  The next few chapters after this one are some of my favorite that I've written so far--looking forward to posting them in the next day or so!
John nodded, and when he looked as if he would start to bawl once more, Mycroft passed over the plush lion and John buried his face into it as he clutched it in his arms.  Later, he would press John to find out what had happened.  For now, he simply needed to comfort the boy and assure him that everything was going to be okay.
John quickly flipped over, stuffed lion beneath his arm.  He reached for the pacifier Mycroft had left on the night table and popped it into his mouth.  He didn't usually go to sleep with his pacifier, but tonight he thought it might help.
An anxiety Greg hadn’t realized he was clinging to at long last began to settle.  Not only was Sherlock cleaned up and supervised, but Bunny was resting after the ordeals of his morning at the crime scene, and he had both boys in his arms.  There were questions to be answered about what was going on in the mind of each boy, solutions to find for problems Greg did not yet fully understand, and conversations to be had with the boys and with Mycroft.  For the moment, however, he knew they were safe, and that was paramount.
He didn’t say anything more.  John knew Sherlock had seen the good ageplay had done for John, the good it still had left to do for him.  Even so, John wasn't sure he could be little without feeling guilty over his relationship with Mycroft.
Mycroft sighed a sigh to rival little Sherlock’s when he’d been sent to time out, and Greg crossed around behind the man to wrap an arm around his shoulders.
John had his fingers in his mouth.  He was feeling particularly young, surprisingly close to tears.  Mycroft leaned down to kiss him on the forehead and bring the blankets up beneath his chin.
It had been bad since Sherlock was talking about the thunderstorms.  He didn’t know how much longer he could hold it.
John nodded slowly, then raised his arms to Mycroft, signaling that he wanted to be picked up.  Generally, Mycroft carried John up to bed, but it seemed now that the boy just wanted to be held.  Mycroft wasn't sure just how long he would be able to hold the man on his hip, but he lifted him without a second thought and let John wrap his arms around his neck.  The boy was far more clingy than Sherlock had ever been and probably ever would be, but Mycroft found it adorable, although a bit worrying if indicative of John’s current mental state.
“Probably not, kid,” Greg shrugged, returning to the food and setting a plateful of French toast on the kitchen table.  “You’re a big boy.  But you don't have to use it, and it's probably a good idea just in case.  Then you won't have to worry about the long car ride.”
“That’s a good boy,” Mycroft said as John helped him clean up his accident.  “It’ll be good as new when we’re all finished.”
The story wasn’t particularly prolific or eloquent, but Greg had to admit he could tell a pretty good adventure tale when prompted.  Not that the boys were much aware.  They were both asleep within five minutes, sucking their pacifiers as they cuddled comfort items to their chests.
Sherlock had been right; Mycroft was being a bit of a Scrooge.  Greg’s plans were all rubbing him the wrong way, and he felt a bit overwhelmed by being back home and thrown back into family life with the boys.  He just wished he knew why, exactly.
I expect to have one or two more chapters in this particular story.  I'm sad to see this story coming to a close, but excited for ideas I have to explore new scenarios in new stories for the Little Brothers Mine series!
He reached out to pat Sherlock’s knee, and Sherlock jerked away from his touch.  He forced himself to swallow down the tears.
It was clear they needed to take stronger action to encourage Bunny in his interests.  This was not only something the boy wanted.  Greg could see now that it was more than that, that, on some level, it was what he needed.
They were two hours into the trip, and Mycroft was not doing a very good job of keeping himself from frustration.  Sherlock had been quietly moody for a blessed forty-five minutes, leaving Mycroft with his thoughts and a quiet morning drive, but his little brother had soon started grumbling about the traffic they’d hit and the boredom he felt, shifting in his seat and complaining about the length of the drive.  He spent long minutes kicking against the footwell and incessantly changing the radio station before attempting to distract himself with his phone, and when that proved futile he took up complaining and whining once more in an endless cycle that was testing Mycroft’s last nerve.
Still, it was wrong for Sherlock to take his own feelings of frustration and confusion out on his brother.  Mycroft needed to put an end to Sherlock’s evasive moodiness, which likely meant bringing the events of the morning out into the open once and for all.  First, however, he needed to make sure his brother, trying to mask his squirming in the corner, got to the loo.
“John?” Mycroft called as he knocked on the man’s bedroom door.  He had followed a few minutes after John left the kitchen with the pull-up.
But as he began to gather the laundry, he could not help but catch the pad of his thumb on a cold, damp patch on a pair of Sherlock’s trousers.  It was then he noticed the smell, and sure enough when he ran his hand along the inner seams of each pant leg, they were wet in a very telling pattern.  He found a pair of what he knew to be John’s jeans in the same state, and sighed.
John lay on his stomach in the living room, kicking his feet as he colored with the glitter crayons his Daddy had bought for him.  And when he felt the pressure in his bladder from the water Greg had given him the last time he put him to bed and the tea and the orange juice from that morning, he felt only the smallest hint of guilt when he paused the scribbling of his green crayon and began to pee.
“What was that, Bunny?” Daddy asked, glancing up from where he had been wiping tears from Sherlock’s face as the baby finished the bottle.
“Hey, grumpy,” Greg teased from his place in the doorway.  “Want to tell me what’s going on with you?”
“Barely noticeable,” John shrugged, reaching with his fingers to rub at his cheekbone with a wince, as if it were possible to make the yellowing skin disappear.
“You don’t have to use it,” Greg said, kneeling down so John could step into the training pants.  “But you know an accident means a pull-up.”
John thought he understood.  He hadn’t given it a whole lot of thought, but he supposed there were differences between his little girl side and his little boy.
Mycroft was seated on the edge of the bed, and John tried not to focus on the awkwardness he felt now that the morning was shedding light on the events of the night before.  He had fallen out of headspace but had still allowed himself to be bathed and brought to bed by Mycroft.  He had fallen out of headspace but had still asked to be dressed in a--thankfully, still dry--pull-up.  Mycroft had seen him have a panic attack, and John had let him rub his back until he’d fallen back to sleep.  John was slowly learning not to be embarrassed by what happened during ageplay sessions, but there was no way he could forgive himself for the childish behavior he’d exhibited while fully adult.
“Hey, love,” John said, heart wrenching as he took in the state of the boy: hair mussed and eyes red-rimmed from crying.  “Is it alright if I talk to you for a minute?”
Sherlock scrubbed sleep from the corner of an eye.  He felt a little older than he’d been the night before, somewhere between his youngest self and his usual baseline of seven or eight.  His slightly older headspace meant he was more capable of speech, but it also meant he was more attuned to the frustration he felt over finding only Papa in bed with him.
Mycroft had hated the science sleep-away camp--something his parents had forced him into in the hopes he would socialize with children his own age with shared interests.  They had bribed him with the promise that they would write him a note to get him out of gym class come the beginning of the fall term should he attend the camp.
“His skin is ice cold but he’s been sweating and says he’s warm,” Daddy said, lifting Bunny back into his arms and handing him Willa the rabbit.  “I think he may have a low-grade fever.”
Sherlock looked back up to Greg for approval once more.  Mycroft was impressed.  It was clear Greg had had a very productive conversation with Sherlock, that he had gotten Sherlock to process the events of the afternoon in a way even Mycroft was unsure he would have been able to.
is some time away from you!” Sherlock sneered, reaching to unbuckle his seatbelt and climbing into the backseat, his long limbs jostling Mycroft as he kneeled on the center console to throw himself as far from Mycroft as was possible in the car.
The lake house was small but comfortable, all wooden beams and whitewashed furniture.  There was a big kitchen attached to the living room, where large couches sat in front of a large television in a room surrounded by built-in bookcases, and a half bathroom just off the entryway.  Upstairs were two bedrooms in addition to a master bedroom en-suite as well as a hallway bath.
However, he could see defiance just behind the boy’s eyes; Sherlock was clearly waiting for any excuse to kick and scream.  Mycroft needed to tread carefully if he wanted to get the boy changed and back into bed without incident.
Bunny was still sniffling, but he did seem a bit less upset and worried.  He nodded and seemed to gain back a weak smile when Greg put the Ariel nightgown into the trolley.
Greg had been able to read the vulnerability all over him, had immediately asked him if he was okay and pressed when Mycroft tried to sidestep his questions about his time with his parents.  He’d managed to convince him that all he needed was food and rest, but he knew Greg was tracing his body language, and had likely been able to tell that Mycroft was more than a bit relieved to find himself back at his own place, on his own terms and with those he most enjoyed spending time with.
His brother hadn’t bothered to yank down his underwear, but the cotton briefs did nothing to protect against Mycroft’s heavy hand.  He writhed on Mycroft’s lap, feeling tears spill over onto his cheeks as he struggled against the welcomed pain.  For a brief few minutes, he was outside of his mind, nothing but pain and remorse and the promise of eventual comfort.
"None of that, now," Greg's mum said with the click of a tongue, her voice quiet and warm.  "You'll feel better after a little rest."
When Mycroft next spoke, it was to address Sherlock, not Bunny, so Bunny turned his face back into Mycroft's neck.
“Promise you’ll be a good boy?” Mycroft asked, teasing the man as he figured anyone in comparison to Sherlock’s naughtiness would rank as ‘good.’
“I know,” Sherlock said, nodding.  He remembered the conversation he'd had with Mycroft after learning that he was Bunny's Daddy.  “That’s why Bunny’s my little brother but today he was my big brother and why you’re his Daddy but just my Mycroft.”
“I'm going to sit right out here, kid,” the voice that sounded like Uncle Greg said.  “And when you're ready you come on out and we’ll get you all cleaned up and nice and settled, okay?”
The good news was that, with Sherlock’s mind focused on weeding through the negativity, he would more than likely lack the energy needed to conjure up the energy it would take to lie to Mycroft about the accident.  Mycroft hoped that, if Sherlock weren't putting on a false front, he would be able to read his mental and emotional state accurately, and would be able to put together a gameplan for helping Sherlock through what he suspected might be a fairly tough day for the boy.  Although Sherlock was generally less susceptible to his anxiety when in littlespace, his bouts of depression came without provocation on a consistent basis.  Ageplay helped, but Mycroft knew even headspace could not guard fully against the chemical imbalances.   All Mycroft could do was monitor his brother and care for him as gently as possible.
“I know, kiddo,” Greg said.  “He needed to make sure you would think twice before putting yourself in a dangerous situation like the other night.”
He needed to take a shower, to get dressed in dry clothes.  Perhaps cold water would settle him  a bit, ground him back into himself.
“Is the mattress protected?” he asked.  “I’d rather not risk waking him when he’s finally sleeping soundly.”
Greg was disappointed in himself.  He should have realized that Bunny’s choice of pajamas may be a sign of the kid’s gender identity at the moment.  He knew it was difficult for Bunny to speak up when he was not feeling like their little boy; Greg should have been a bit more observant.
Greg seemed to immediately register that John was slipping down into headspace, and he sighed, loosening his hold on John without letting go.
Sherlock’s mother did nothing to eradicate the problem, consistently using pet names and nicknames with both himself and Mycroft, asking them to help her decorate Christmas biscuits, even insisting that they all watch claymation Christmas films
It was a lie when Sherlock said he hadn’t had to go badly.  He’d been feeling the need for the loo for over 45 minutes, and had needed to hold between his legs a time or two during his tantrum to keep from leaking.  His bladder had been ever-present during his spanking, and he’d needed to shift up onto his knees to keep his bladder from pressing sharply against Mycroft’s lap.  He wouldn’t be able to hold it much longer, he knew.
It was easy enough to find a pair of clean briefs in Sherlock's top drawer, even if he did have to dig beneath what he could only assume to be a mold experiment of some kind to find them.  The pajamas were a bit more difficult.  Sherlock generally slept in cotton pajama trousers and nothing else; it was only once John had yanked out the second drawer entirely that he found the aforementioned pajamas, pressed against the back of the bureau.  John pulled them from their hiding place.  They were blue and red striped cotton pajamas, soft elastic at the wrists and ankles, a trait often seen on children's pajamas.
Greg disliked spanking the boys, but he knew even Bunny’s inevitable puppy-dog eyes and tearful apologies would more than likely not be enough to convince Mycroft that wandering away in the store did not warrant a spanking.
“Well that’s just silly,” Greg said, popping the DVD into the player.  “Who ever heard of a movie being only for a boy or a girl?”
But as he began to pull out of the gas station, John caught sight of the duffel bag in the back seat, and he glanced up in irritation.
And then Bunny was alone, and wetting his pants didn’t seem like such a great idea now that the accident was over.  He pressed his hand against the dark circle of pee spread beneath him on the rug, could feel the liquid already cooling beneath him and sticking to the skin of his legs.  This hadn’t been an accident at all, and Daddy hadn’t even noticed and had called him a boy again, and now Bunny felt naughty and sad.  What had he done?
The boy hesitated for a moment, but then nodded, scooting away from his Daddy so they could climb out from beneath the desk.  Mycroft took control when they were out in the open, sitting in the desk chair and bringing the boy close between his legs, where he stripped him of his wet nightshirt and soaked underwear before beginning to wipe him down.
John glanced down and noticed the stain, then, in confusion, reached a hand down to feel his pajama pants between his legs.  Greg could not help but smile at the boy’s innocence.
“I’m weeing, Mycroft,” he whispered, glancing down to where he was grabbing at the front of his pull-up.  “I can’t hold it.”
Mycroft leaned down to kiss John on the forehead, then walked to the other side of the bed and tried to kiss his brother’s forehead, but Sherlock squirmed away from the kiss, raising his arms up to cover his face.   It was clear Sherlock's patience level and ability to accept comfort had been exhausted for the night, but that was okay.
Mr. Ryder mopped his forehead with his handkerchief and told us how he and Miss Cusack had conspired to steal the stone. How, once Horner was arrested, Mr. Ryder had needed a place to hide the Blue Carbuncle, lest he be searched. He told us of his sister, now Mrs. Oakshott, who keeps geese in her home on Brixton Road, and who promised him his pick of her Christmas fowl. There seemed in the moment, Mr. Ryder explained, no better place to store the gem than inside his promised goose. He chose a distinct-looking bird—white, with a black tail—and forced the stone down its gizzard. He carried it off with him, or so he thought. But when the day came to slice it open and recover the carbuncle, Mr. Ryder found nothing.
Just because we are retired, does not mean we do not keep ourselves busy; Holmes has his bees and I have my motor car. A funny contraption, when you think about it, as full of parts as the human body is full of organs. Though I doubt I shall ever be as good a mechanic as I was a doctor (a very sad fate, indeed, if some of my more exacting patients are to be believed!).
At the moment, Papa’s voice was so calm and grounded that Sherlock found himself unable to do anything but obey.
Okay, on to the new chapter.  It probably should be split into two and I'm a little self-conscious about the schmexy stuff, but I'm trying to work on my perfectionism, so I'll just let it be for now <3
He considered calling John as he hailed a cab and directed it to the government building where he assumed Mycroft would still be hunched over his work in his dark office, anticipating that John would be best able to report on Sherlock’s current state of mind.  But he was sorely lacking in details from the morning’s conversation, and he didn’t want to risk upsetting Mycroft or the boys by mistakenly saying something he shouldn’t.  He would talk with Mycroft, and hopefully convince him to accompany him to Baker Street, where they would ensure their little ones were alright.  However adult they may be at any given time, Greg had begun to find it difficult not to see Sherlock and John as they were when they were small: innocent and vulnerable.
“I’ll try to be good,” he said, allowing himself a small bit of vulnerability in Bunny's presence.  Bunny unbuckled his seatbelt and scooted across the middle seat until he could wrap his arms around Sherlock and rest his head on the man’s shoulder.
“John, Greg and I care for you.  We want you to be happy.  And neither of us want you to stifle your desires or censor yourself simply for the sake of propriety.  There’s nothing wrong with this, kid.”
Sherlock looked ready to cry once more, as if unable to fully process his emotions in the moment, but Mycroft could see that, on some level, the idea pleased the boy.  Sherlock nodded, even as a fresh wave of tears slid down his cheeks.  Mycroft hoped a change of scene might quell the kid’s teariness.  At any rate, fresh air and some sunshine couldn’t hurt.
“Why don’t we go on up and get changed into some play clothes?” Mycroft asked, seeming to choose to ignore Sherlock’s rudeness.  “I’d like to take care of you, right now.”
“What is it, Bunny?” Daddy asked from his position pacing the hallway.  His voice was tight, the way grown-ups sounded when they were trying to pretend they weren’t angry or upset.
“I would suggest you cease flopping about like a fish and sit up so that we can process your decisions today.”
“It’s unsafe for both your brother and yourself,” Mycroft said, raising his eyebrows as he waited for an explanation.
“Listen to me, bud,” Greg said, waiting for the boy to look up at him before he continued.  “There is nothing wrong with wanting to wear an Ariel nightgown, or wanting to play with bunnies, or wanting to color pictures of unicorns and mermaids.  It’s the same as Sherlock wanting to dress up in his pirate shirt and play with dinosaurs.”
John lost count after his fourth pint, both of the number of beers he’d had and of the hour of the day.  The bar was perpetually dark and dingy no matter the time, but it must have been getting on towards evening as when John next looked up he found it had grown quite crowded, men and women laughing and flirting at scattered tables and all along the bar.  The change in atmosphere increased his loneliness, and he was suddenly filled with a short-tempered anger when, some time later, one of a group of passing blokes knocked against him.
This version of Bunny had her own opinions and ideas, was excited by the prospect of sharing them loudly and of taking things into her own hands in order to see them come to fruition.  This version of Bunny wasn’t about to let others call all the shots, and Sherlock realized with a jolt of cold fear that he was no longer in control.
Mycroft tossed aside the throw pillows and pulled back the duvet and the sheets so Greg could settle Sherlock into bed.  Sherlock was sleeping soundly, and Greg was pleased to see the boy had let his guard down enough to accept his pirate pacifier.
“Even if you hadn't been in headspace," Mycroft assured him, "there’s nothing to be upset about.  It happens.  If anyone saw you it's likely they assumed you were sick, as you would assume if you saw another man wet his pants in public.”
He wasn’t surprised when the pull-up began to leak, trickling down the inseam of Sherlock’s pajama trousers, but Sherlock certainly seemed to be distraught, whimpering as he did a frantic potty dance in an attempt to put an end to the accident.
Mycroft leaned down to kiss Sherlock on the top of the head, and Sherlock could not help but sigh in contentment as he settled in for time-out.  Bunny had forgiven him, and Papa had forgiven him, and he was well on his way to being forgiven by Mycroft.  He was clean from his bath, and feeling little from his spanking and his diaper, and Mycroft hadn't made him take Bunny's pacifier out of his mouth.  He had brothers and Papas and Mycrofts who loved him.  And he never, ever wanted to feel separated from them again.
All of that said, the sexual elements of the story are rather minor in my mind (you could probably miss them if you weren't looking for them), so hopefully they don't keep anyone from reading.   I'll be interested to hear what you all think and will use your thoughts to inform the direction John's character will take in future updates.
I'm debating between doing an in-depth christmas day at the Holmes house vs. the Lestrade house for each pair or just glancing over their mornings in order to get them all back to Mycroft's for their own Christmas celebrations.  Let me know which you would prefer!
Mycroft, for his part, seemed to have deduced what was wrong as John stood frozen in the purple room at the lake house.
Sherlock stood to stomp his foot, which only had the effect of emphasizing his littleness, as he stomped his bare foot directly onto the puddle of urine he had just peed onto the carpet while playing.
“Oh, lovebug,” he said, pulling John, still wrapped up in the blankets and sheets, into a hug.  “Uncle Greg didn’t buy diapers for you.  He bought them for Sherlock.”
“Okay, sweetheart,” Mycroft said, vowing to keep an eye on John and Sherlock to assess whether or not they were coming down with something.  “Just close your eyes and try to sleep.  We’ll get you to bed, soon.”
John breathed in the chill quietude for a moment, then pulled his phone from his trouser pocket.  Harry’s mobile went straight to voicemail.
“There was once…” Sherlock paused, drawing out the end of the word to signal that John was meant to fill in the next detail.
Mycroft should have guessed, given Greg’s allusions to the nightgown and paper dolls Bunny had picked out at the store and the fact that Sherlock would not be wearing pull-ups until he was feeling older, that Greg had purchased the girls’ version of Goodnights for their kid.
Greg needed sleep, himself--especially after the day he’d had--but he knew there was a conversation that needed to be had with his brother before he could settle down next to Bunny for rest.
“Greg, can you get the Bunny dressed for the day while I chat with Sherlock?” Mycroft asked, testing the waters of John’s headspace by suggesting that he should be dressed in something other than the jeans and sweater that were his go-tos in his everyday life.
He was feeling helpless and alone, was confused about why everything had gone wrong for him throughout the day.  He pressed hard between his legs when another strong urge hit him, trying desperately to pull on the drawstring knot with one hand.  But he couldn’t hold it anymore, and there was nothing he could do but collapse against the bathroom door as he lost control, urine streaming fast and warm into the pull-up.
“Here’s the plan,” Mycroft said, finding that he was relieved to be finished with the first half of the punishment.  “We’ll get you dressed, and you’ll sit in time-out while Uncle Greg and I make some lunch for you and your brother.  Then, if you’re a good boy and get some food in that tummy, you can show me your new toys, and then you and Sherlock can take a nap in the big bed in Daddy and Uncle Greg’s room.  Okay?”
The story of Sherlock’s childhood dog was weighing heavy on John’s mind as he contemplated the sense of loss and injustice which would have needed to be processed by Sherlock at such a young age.  But there was something more, something which didn't quite compute regarding Mycroft's story of the conniving neighbor girl.  He couldn't exactly place it, but it seemed Sherlock was caught between attempting to recall more details and attempting to distract himself from doing so.  If that was the case, Mycroft had not been entirely truthful that morning, and Sherlock knew it.
John filled the sippy cup halfway with apple juice, then diluted it with water and screwed the top back on before placing the cup before Sherlock.  The man reached for it and drank greedily from the spout.
The crying man pulled himself out from beneath the sheets, immediately sitting up, pulling his thumb from his mouth, and scrubbing at his tear-streaked face.
When Bunny was finished, he sniffled, then glanced up when Greg turned back to him.  The boy was shame-faced but clearly content.
He hesitated, wanting Papa more than anything but afraid of Papa’s big brother, who was taller even than Daddy and Sherlock and who had big, square shoulders and strong arms.  What if he didn’t like that John was small right now?  What if he teased or yelled or noticed that Bunny had wet his pants a little?
But Greg sighed as they stepped into the master bedroom.  He'd forgotten about the sheets on the master bed, had assumed Mycroft would have changed them while Sherlock had been in time-out.  But the bed was still rumpled and unmade, sheets dry but stained with urine.  Guest bedroom, it was.
Papa and Daddy had argued after Papa bought Bunny her first nightshirt and her pink and purple pull-ups.  Did Daddy not like the unicorn headband? Had Daddy not been honest when he told Bunny she could be a girl when she wanted to be?
“I received a call one night.  It was Sherlock.  He’d failed a recent group project because he’d refused to work with the others and turned in his own work individually, and he’d had an argument with his roommate, who’d put in a request with student services to have his room changed, who’d taken to calling Sherlock a freak.  He sounded so small on the other end of the line, the way he had as a child, and I drove to university and picked him up in the middle of the night.”
Bunny had certainly peed himself before, but he’d never done it after announcing what he was about to do.  Usually, he waited until he couldn’t hold it anymore, and didn’t fight too hard against having an accident if he was feeling in the mood to be wet and little.  This was different.  He had to pee, but not badly enough to cause an accident just yet.  He would be peeing in his pull-up on purpose.
“You did good, kiddo,” Papa said, smiling warmly as Mycroft reached out to squeeze Sherlock’s shoulder.  “We’ll choose one a bit later, once you’re feeling up to it, alright?”
He stood and cleared his throat, crossing out of the bathroom and across the main room to the opened doorway.  He needed fresh air.
Sherlock had not realized just how dependant he was on Mycroft until John had entered his life, perhaps had not realized there was anything abnormal about their brotherly relationship until John spoke of his own lukewarm relationship with his sister and questioned why Mycroft was so protective.  Sherlock had made a disparaging comment about John’s fairy-tale need to see sentimentality in all aspects of his life and shrugged it off, but he soon began to observe his brother’s actions as something to be studied.  And he had come to understand through his gathered data that what he had with Mycroft was not something easily found, not something that could have existed unless it was fully grounded in Mycroft’s love for his little brother.
“Daddy?” he asked, suddenly reminded of the last conversation he’d had when alone with Mycroft, when he had hid in his room to cry after going to the store with Uncle Greg.  “‘member when you called me ‘baby’? After I was crying before?”
Sherlock nodded, allowing himself to sink into the comfort of the blanket and his thumb and Mycroft’s care.  It had been a difficult few days, but he was headed back to London and to John and Papa.
“Listening,” he said once he was dressed in a dry pull-up and Mycroft was stringing his pajama pants back up his legs.
Mycroft was right, of course.  John had earned himself a harsh punishment after using his fists instead of his words.  But Greg was hesitant about spankings, and was feeling both responsible for John’s outburst--after all, he’d been the one who’d permitted the kid to tag along to the crime scene in the first place--and conflicted about using violence to punish violence.
“You can be whatever you need to be, champ,” he said, reaching to place his hand over one of John’s.
“Perfectly,” Sherlock said, smirking up at John for a moment before dropping the grin, putting on the act of nonchalance.
When the boy glanced up, finally making eye contact, Greg knew he’d surprised John by leading them into new territory.  They’d both become accustomed to the routine assurances.
He rocked the boy where they stood in the hall bathroom, holding him close against his chest.  It was a relief to have the kid in his arms.  Yes, it would be easier were the kid to have sunk down in age when they reached Mycroft’s--where he could rock Bunny in the big rocking chair in the kid’s room and let him take comfort in the familiar surroundings of his forest-themed bedroom, but even in the present circumstances, Greg would rather Bunny than a hurting, conflicted John.
Mycroft seemed relieved by Greg’s suggestion, and soon he and Greg were settled with their breakfast dishes and tea cups on the coffee table, close to their boys.
A part of John questioned whether he should go through with the plan, but the slight warmth of his damp briefs against his skin was comforting, and the thought of helplessly wetting himself, the knowledge that he was so close to losing it in his pants, was already making him feel smaller.  So, with a deep breath and a burying of his face into the knees against his chest, John released his bladder and began to pee.
John’s attempts to make himself appear presentable, however, did little to convince Mycroft that John was adult.  The man looked, more than anything, like a rather pitiful child.  John’s eyes were red from crying, his face flushed and hair mussed from being under the sheets, and before he’d pulled the sheets over himself, Mycroft had been able to see that he was dressed in nothing but a crumpled t-shirt and yellow-stained briefs.
“Don't talk with your mouth full, Sherlock,” Greg chuckled as he shared an amused look with Mycroft.  Mycroft was glad to see his brother eating hungrily after not eating anything more substantial than ice cream for lunch.  He reached to take the pacifier from John’s mouth, wanting both of his boys to get something good into them before the end of the night.  John whined a bit but did not give Mycroft too much of a fight when the pacifier was taken away.
They were soon making their way back toward London, John babbling to Willa in half-coherent statements, wondering about the presents Santa may have brought and telling stories of Santa's reindeer.  It was a relief that the kid had finally given into headspace, but Greg was eager for Mycroft and Sherlock and home, eager for them all to be together.  Greg had been planning their little family Christmas for weeks, had set aside the stockings and the ribbons and the gingerbread biscuits.  It had been a tough few days, but he finally had the chance to spoil the kids rotten, and he was planning to take full advantage of the opportunity--no matter how much Mycroft teased.
John had been struggling as the day wore on to keep his footing as a put-together adult.  He willed himself to remain adult for just a few hours longer, just until he could be alone with Papa.  He ran a hand down the back of his neck and cleared his throat.
No matter how old he got, at home with his parents he felt young and constantly watched, nothing more than a larger version of the child he had been while growing up.
Mycroft paused in the process of washing the boy’s hair.  He did not want to upset the boy, but there were questions he felt it necessary to ask, points he needed to reassure for Bunny’s sense of self.  He dropped his hands to the lip of the tub, causing Bunny to glance up from playing with his glittery plastic mermaids.  Mycroft was relieved that, even when young, John could sense when the mood had shifted.  He looked up at Mycroft in anticipation, knowing his Daddy wanted to talk about something important.
Sherlock was squirming out of his chair, more interested in playing than eating lunch.  His Daddy glanced up from where he was trying to get Sherlock back into a seated position, but he was looking over his head at Uncle Greg, not at him.
“I don't want to play, anymore,” Bunny said, his voice sounding far more panicked than he had intended.  He yanked at the rope around his wrists, and when he made no progress in getting himself free, he felt the tears welling up in his eyes.
Mycroft nodded and Greg turned to reach a hand to pat Sherlock, who had finally stopped crying long enough to catch on to the fact that they might be able to return someday, on the knee.
Greg could do nothing but lean to kiss the boy’s head again, clucking his tongue in an apology.  The boy was not in a state to accept rationalization, and Greg unfortunately did not have the time to indulge him.  He was more than grateful that Mycroft stepped in before the boy’s puppy dog eyes had him actually agreeing to take the baby with him, too.
Bunny couldn’t help it; he sat back on his heels and began to cry, hitching on his breath as he wailed over the destruction of his beautiful dolls and their colorful clothes.  Someone had ripped up all of his pretty paper dolls.  His Daddy and Papa came immediately into the room, asking what was wrong just as Sherlock, with flushed cheeks, fled past them and ran from the room.
“Let’s drop it, alright?” John asked, pulling his mobile from his coat pocket to keep from having to look at Greg.  “I’d like to just forget it.”
“You shouldn’t have done that back at the bar,” John breathed as Sherlock pressed him against the wall and leaned in to kiss him against the neck.
“Yeah,” John nodded, feeling a bit more confident after Uncle Greg’s game.  Uncle Greg wasn’t mean or scary; he was the same as he had always been.  And, John realized, if he was, he would have Mycroft to deal with.  If Greg wanted to sustain any type of relationship with the man--romantic, as it had seemed lately, or otherwise--he would need to keep Mycroft happy.
“John,” the man said, voice caught between surprise and amusement.  “I’m sorry.  I thought you were one of my daughters.”
“Jealousy is natural, yes.  But you’re not…” John thought for a moment before hitting upon the right word.   “Resentful?”
So, he sat perched outside Sherlock’s door and vacillated between trying to think through and prepare himself for all of the various ways Sherlock may deal with the news that Mycroft had become John’s daddy and trying to think through all of the ways he himself could apologize to what would surely be a disappointed and frustrated boyfriend come morning.
Bunny shook his head and put his thumb in his mouth, his pacifier having been left behind somewhere in the ordeal.
Sherlock figured this had probably been a plan of Mycroft’s all along.  Sherlock was used to Mycroft trying to teach him new things while he was little; his brother was always attempting to use littlespace to broaden his horizons.  It had actually been on a short trip away from the city years and years ago that Mycroft had first gotten Sherlock out of the house while in headspace.  They had gone to the grocery store, and Mycroft had been so supportive and discreet that after that trip Sherlock had been progressively more comfortable being little in public.
John glanced at Sherlock in the aftermath of their laughing fit, able to breathe for a moment, but when Sherlock looked at him with wide eyes and a goofy expression, his nostrils flared and he once again found himself succumbing to a deep, guttural laughter.  Sherlock was set off again as well, and when he laughed so hard that he snorted, John felt tears streaming down his face.  Sherlock noticed and joined him in silent, deep-bellied laughter.
There were questions to be answered and issues to address, but Sherlock was unconcerned, confident in the fact that Sherlock Holmes and John Watson had not yet met a puzzle they couldn’t solve.  The surety was a bit of bravado on Sherlock’s part; there were unsolved cases and unresolved emotional issues in their pasts which remained glaringly unsolved.  But Sherlock was still riding the high of the morning, replaying John’s gasping breaths over in his mind, and he was inclined to allow himself the foolishness of selective memory, if only for a moment.
The other tech removed the man’s wedding ring and placed it into an evidence bag, then continued on with fluid collections, swapping blood and saliva.  Anderson began bagging the empty whiskey bottles and fast food wrappers.
“What’s the plan, then?” Greg had asked, hoisting himself up to spoon another serving of rice onto his plate.  “We can’t very well keep Sherlock separate every time the little one’s feeling like a girl.”
In actuality, John was well on his way.  But he knew a bit of extra attention from Greg would help to solidify his headspace.  Greg turned to smile at him.
But Mycroft left the room without another word.  Because as much as he’d like to explain that he was just fine, the truth was that he was feeling anything but.
Greg paused at the doorway.  He turned around and came to rest on the edge of the bed next to where John lay.
Sherlock had turned back to cartoons after accepting the pacifier and his stuffed alligator, both of which Mycroft had held out to him sometime during their conversation with Bunny.  His alligator had been given to him as a consolation for Mycroft taking away Dmitri the dinosaur, who had gotten a bit worse for wear during Sherlock's messy eating.   Sherlock stopped his whining only when Mycroft assured him Dmitri would be back in no time, and he returned his attention to the telly.  But his focus was pulled away once more when Bunny next spoke.
“I...wasn’t there for him before,” Mycroft admitted.  “At least not in the way I should have been.  I was...distracted, aloof.  I won’t be the one to cause him a repeat of that upset.”
Greg’s mother forced appetizers and warm cider cocktails onto John and Greg whenever she could find them in the mass of guests, telling them to drink and have a good time.
“Let’s chat for a minute before we go inside, alright?” Greg said, placing a hand on Bunny’s shoulder to pause the boy in his attempt to scramble out of the car.
Sherlock pulled the thumb from his mouth and wiped it dry on his trousers, not missing Mycroft’s glance.  He was in enough an in-between-state of headspace that it wasn’t difficult to blink away the beginning stages of little space.  He’d rather be an adult and talk with John than be little and deal with a grumpy Mycroft right now, anyway.
There was a break in the sobbing after what might have been a shocked gasp, silence taking over for long enough that John began to think he may be forced to let himself in unwelcomed.  But just as he raised a fist to knock once more, the door opened, and a chagrined, tear-stained Sherlock stood before him.
Daddy rubbed his back as Bunny cried against his shoulder, mumbling, legs tucked beneath himself to keep his feet and ankles free from the scary monster’s grip.
It was the first time John had called Mycroft Daddy outright instead of calling him by his first name, and his stomach fluttered with nerves thinking about what Mycroft’s reaction may be.  But, as ever, the man seemed unphased.
“Uncle Greg and I think it might be good for you to keep learning how to be little without Sherlock, and one small step we can take to start that process is to try sleeping in separate rooms.”
“I know, kid,” Mycroft said, reaching and gently guiding John, who was too emotionally drained to do anything but comply, back towards him.  “That doesn’t matter.”
Had it been Mycroft, Sherlock would have disobeyed and misbehaved until his brother had no choice but to prove that he cared by taking him over his knee and settling him into submission.  But Papa operated on a different set of expectations, and Sherlock had long since come to understand that Papa could not fulfill the same role as Mycroft in his care.
He knew the man was still struggling against the fast-paced jolts of his adult mind, knew that Sherlock was no more child than John at the moment.  But Sherlock was allowing himself the ritual, and, if they were lucky, that might just be enough.
Sherlock turned to Mycroft with his mouth open, his face full of all the shock of someone who felt they’d been unjustly wronged.
Mycroft could see from Greg’s expression that the man was hesitant.  As far as Mycroft was concerned, there was no question that John’s behavior that day was cause for a spanking.   But it was no secret that neither John nor Greg was a fan of physical punishment.
It was rare that John heard such honest--albeit convoluted--expressions of emotion from the man, and it concerned him.  Sherlock looked to be in pain, and John could tell from the drawn look on his face that he more than likely had not been sleeping or eating wherever it was he had been.  He did not need to have Sherlock's powers of deduction to know the man had more than likely been in a drug den.  But this sudden need for Mycroft was something unexpected; the Holmes brothers were not even getting along presently, and John had to admit he felt put out when Sherlock requested his brother instead of letting John help in whatever way he could.
He should tell Mycroft what had happened, should explain and apologize and stop the cycle of lies.  But he was ashamed, and it was easier to reach to flush the toilet, turn on the sink faucet to splash water on his reddened face, and pull open the bathroom door as if all was okay.
“How can I help?” Papa’s brother asked from his place at the bottom of the stairs, and Bunny was exceedingly grateful for the lack of judgment in his tone.
Greg, to his credit, had taken in the facts without any of the histrionics others might have.  He sat and listened without judgment, a man used to containing his reactions.
The overgrown child had curled himself in an armchair for the majority of the day, arms crossed over his chest as he mumbled derogatory comments under his breath.  Each time one parent or the other took an action Sherlock classified as inane--their father tuning the radio to a station playing Christmas carols,  their mother setting out cheese and crackers on Christmas platters, both of them answering phone calls from Aunts and Uncles and family friends requesting updates on Mycroft and Sherlock--the man rolled his eyes and breathed insulting comments.  Eventually, it was only Mycroft’s pointed glares, which hinted at threats of spankings and exceedingly long time-outs once they were out of sight of their parents, that kept him from voicing his vitriolic comments.
Sherlock did nothing but stand with his legs spread as he wet himself, clearly mortified that John was watching.  But somehow John understood that this was some sort of tell, some Sherlockian signal from Holmes brother to Holmes brother which would cue Mycroft into what Sherlock was asking for.  John could clearly see a lapse in Sherlock's agitated state that he knew had to do with more than the state of the man's bladder.  He was calmed; somehow the act of wetting himself had provided him a semblance of respite from the negative thoughts and overriding depression he had clearly felt overtaking his mind.  John was confused.  Did he really believe the wet warmth spreading through Sherlock's crotch and down his legs had comforted the man, had made him feel safer and calmer than he had before?  Even as Sherlock began to cry in his vulnerability--and, when was the last time John had seen Sherlock cry?--the man breathed normally once again.
“Good,” Sherlock grinned, settling his thigh beneath John’s crotch as he stepped closer and continued to tickle relentlessly.
The detective had refused, however, to sleep in his own room.  He would not let Mycroft out of his sight; Mycroft compromised by laying his brother down to sleep in the living room couch while he and John sat at the kitchen for a moment of quiet and a cup of tea.  Sherlock had sunk into stillness after only a few moments, face burrowed into his dinosaur, and, once he was quiet, Mycroft began from the beginning without John having to ask.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft warned.  “You’re not feeling well.  It’s probably a good idea to be safe tonight.  You can wear your big boy underwear tomorrow morning if you’re still feeling big, okay?”
“Ma, you can’t treat everyone like they’re your grandchildren,” Greg said with the breath of a laugh, unsure how else to gauge the situation.  He leaned onto the jut of countertop where he used to eat cereal as a kid, one foot finding traction on the lowest rung of a kitchen stool as he watched her put a tray of brownies to warm in the oven.  “John is a grown man.”
“John?” He asked, voice probing and now a bit confused, likely having registered the fact that a grown man was carrying around a plush toy.  “Everything alright?”
Bunny, sitting at Daddy’s kitchen table, was fighting the urge to suck his thumb as he ran his fingers methodically over the soft, delicate fur of his stuffed rabbit’s floppy ear.  He had known from early that morning, even as Papa arrived at Baker Street to help him and Sherlock begin the process of aging down, that there was a plan set in place for the week, that conversations had been happening both with and without the boys in order to establish ground rules and plan expectations.
Greg scoffed, then joked with his mother about wishing she were the one monitoring his stats when he went for his yearly physicals.
It wasn’t that John didn’t appreciate what Mycroft had done for him--the man had waited outside the guest room door knowing John would need him.  He had slept upright in an old wooden desk chair the entire night.  He had offered support and comfort that John had desperately needed.  It was just that Mycroft reminded John of his own perceived weakness, and at the moment he was in danger of being swallowed whole by the reminders.
The boy nodded, and Mycroft ducked his head and crawled under the desk on his hands and knees.  It was a tight fit given his height, but he maneuvered his body until he sat facing the boy, his back pressed against the opposite side of the desk from Bunny.
They spent the next ten minutes in front of the window, looking out onto Baker Street as Sherlock slowly moved from short-sentenced quips to prattling on about their neighbors and the occasional passer-by.  It was only when a woman passed by walking her dog that Sherlock became quiet once more, pausing in the midst of a discussion of late-night traffic patterns to hide his face against Mycroft’s shoulder.
John also found a pair of superhero undies that he placed on the pile of clothing.  If he put the undies on over the pull up and then his dressing gown on over his pajama pants, maybe Uncle Greg wouldn’t even be able to tell he was wearing a pull-up beneath his big boy underwear.
Greg wouldn’t have been surprised if the boy had already wet the pull-up earlier that night.  The pull-up certainly seemed to be fuller than a single wetting, particularly given the amount of liquid which had spilled into the bed and into a puddle on the floor beneath Bunny.  He should have checked if the boy was wet before putting him down to sleep.
Mycroft lifted the man and placed him in his lap sideways as he sat on the edge of the bed.  John looked up at the taller man, taking a small amount of comfort from being pressed close to him.  He was grateful that Mycroft seemed to know how to keep him aged down because John did not want to age back up yet.  He was feeling too vulnerable and shy to be an adult.
Mycroft nodded, unable to keep from eyeing the darkened patch of urine on the sheets from Sherlock's earlier wetting.
“Right,” John said, half listening as he read back his last sentence and edited out a misplaced modifier.
There was pain in Mycroft’s expression, but he glanced across the kitchen towards the table, where Sherlock sat mumbling to himself happily and scribbling looping lines in crayon inside a dinosaur coloring book.
Bunny mumbled an okay, but he looked so disappointed that Mycroft could not help but think there was more to the situation than he knew.
“Here you go, love,” John said, smiling at the picture Sherlock made so young and sleepy.  The man allowed the pacifier to be pushed between his lips.
I hope I'll be able to get another chapter up within a week--I'm going to do my best to stick to that schedule if at all posssible!  I will respond to the comments from last chapter ASAP, but don't have time now (need to sleep!).  Let me just say that you're all amazing and your encouragement means the world to me--thank you for commenting!
“Okay, love,” he said, turning the key in the ignition before twisting over his shoulder to catch John’s teary gaze.  “Let’s get you home to Daddy and Sherlock, okay?”
Sherlock was galloping around the flat, but he was clearly still following the train of conversation.
They only made it to the top of the stairs before Uncle Greg refused to go any farther for safety’s sake as well as the sake of his lower back, but the boys had had their fun, and they both hurried down the stairs and skipped into the kitchen to find Mycroft and tell him Uncle Greg was the strongest man alive.
“Mycroft,” Greg said, taking the stool next to the man before turning to face him.  “I know you and Sherlock had a rough few days, and I know the holidays don’t always bring out the best in everyone.  But there’s something to be said for the routine of it all, for making time to appreciate loved ones.”
Sherlock was more difficult to lift than Bunny.  Mycroft had learned the tricks to navigating the man’s long limbs over the years, but it had taken a bit of trial and error on Greg’s.  Lately, however, the man seemed to have gotten used to shifting Sherlock up onto his hip in just the right way, and the boy was accommodating enough to anyone willing to carry him that he made the task as easy as possible, latching his legs around Greg’s waist and looping his arms about his neck.
Sherlock spat out his toothpaste and glared at John, who had managed to get a tiny trickle of urine into the toilet.  John felt sad that Sherlock was angry with him; there had been plenty of other nights when Sherlock had been put to bed in a pull-up beside an underwear-clad John, but it was obvious the contrast had upset Sherlock tonight.
Greg closed the back door, then circled around to the driver’s seat.  Greg had been hoping he’d get a chance in the loo as well, his own need pressing, but he didn’t feel comfortable leaving Bunny alone at the moment, and it was clear the kid had some aversion to the rest stop bathroom.  He’d be fine until they made it the last twenty-five minutes home to Mycroft’s.
They were in luck; the women’s pajamas section seemed just as preoccupied with bright colors and cartoon characters as was the girls’ section.  For once, Greg felt grateful for nostalgia marketing and society’s preoccupation with infantilizing women.  Bunny wandered, eyes on the floor except for furtive glances up at the items in the section.  It was only once Greg found an oversized sleep shirt with Ariel and Flounder from The Little Mermaid on the front that Bunny seemed to forget his self-consciousness.
If Mycroft hadn’t been attempting to show Sherlock he cared, Sherlock had no doubt he would have been punished for sticking his tongue out at his brother.  As it was, Mycroft had apparently decided to allow Sherlock the semblance of seclusion he received from hiding his face.  He said nothing until he had placed the  final bandaid.
Bunny fought when Mycroft tried to take away the remote control, yelling that he wanted to watch the ponies and hiding the remote between the armrest and his body, lifting his legs to signal that, should he come closer, Bunny was prepared to kick away his Daddy.
“I want to play dress-up,” Bunny said around a spoonful of macaroni, glancing up at his Daddy as Uncle Greg re-filled his sippy cup with milk, and Sherlock, despite initially saying dress up was for girls--a quip John knew he made not because he truly believed it but because it fit into the rougher and more boyish personality he took on when he was little--clearly hoped Mycroft would permit the game, too.
at their parents’, who was Mycroft to stand in his way?  He had made assumptions for Sherlock and had dictated how he was to behave, and that was not his place when Sherlock was out of headspace.
Sherlock seemed to have fallen back asleep, and Bunny was glad when his Daddy lifted him into his arms and carried him out of Sherlock’s room and into his own.
John sighed.  How could he explain that he himself hadn’t even fully processed his relationship with Mycroft, how could he explain that he was still in the midst of understanding just why he felt so drawn to ageplay?
John had fallen asleep almost the moment they had set off.  After tugging on Mycroft’s sleeve to ask for his pacifier as discreetly as he could, he had curled up against the door with his stuffed lion as a pillow.  Sherlock would have teased John for the pacifier had he been in a younger headspace.  He thought about pretending to be little in the moment just for the excitement that would come from teasing and getting scolded by Mycroft, but he was still feeling annoyingly adult, and it felt cruel to tease the bunny while Sherlock himself was not young.
Mycroft had dressed and packed up the boys, fed them breakfast, made them wash their faces and use the loo before he sent them, slathered in sunscreen, off with Lestrade.  Now that John and Sherlock’s flat was empty, he packed up and called for a car to take him to the office, where he settled down with his tea and newspaper and spent the morning absorbed in work and conference calls with rather incompetent people.
“None of that, now,” he said, shaking his head.  “We’ve talked about this before.  No apologizing for what’s out of your control.”
Sherlock did not respond, feeling small and safe for the first time in months of cases and holiday plans.
The day had been draining.  John was feeling the effects of the emotional ups and downs, particularly given his breakdown up in the attic earlier that afternoon.  Being young comforted and calmed him, but there was a different kind of comfort in coming up for air every once in awhile to process his thoughts as an adult.  John needed moments of adulthood between long sessions in headspace or he was prone to pulling himself out of headspace with overthinking.  At that moment, sitting sentinel over a sleeping Sherlock as Mycroft and Greg settled to sleep down the hallway, John was glad for the quiet moment to process the day’s events in his adult mind.
“It was obviously never sold!” Sherlock said to the mobile.  “Opportunistic brother-in-law taking advantage of his sister’s predisposition for half-witted men.”
He passed Sherlock a pint, then sipped from his own.  But Sherlock was not reaching for his glass, and when John turned towards him, about to question whether he was going to drink anything more that night, Sherlock took his hand in his.
“One question, before you go,” Miss Holmes said. “I should be so curious to learn where you got your goose—the first goose. I consider myself something of a fowl fancier, and I thought that one quite unrivaled in size and quality.”
“Breckinridge, Breckinridge... don’t know him. Well, to your very good health, my man. And to the prosperity of your house,” said she, placing some coin on the bar and starting for the door. “Come along, Janey, dear.”
“Yes, very. Oh, but, it’s after five already. We shall have to hurry, if we mean to get it in the evening papers.”
“No time, no time!” Miss Holmes was already striding into the hall, a man’s round hat in one hand, and an overcoat in the other. “Besides, I suspect a pair of trousers may get us straighter answers from a barman than a skirt should. Come along, Jane, and don’t forget your muff!”
“I beg your pardon,” said I with a hurmph. I should have been ready to say more, only Miss Holmes caught my elbow and the publican’s eye with a wave.
“Best let me watch over ‘em, eh? Wouldn’t want you forgettin’ ol’ Joe again. They’ll be ready for you soon, Mr. ‘olmes. Best of luck to you.”
It was an unholy thing to see him like that, a divine thing. The arch, the tension, the quick intake of air, and then the sigh, barely audible through parted lips, as his arrow hit home. The martyr, devout until his last breath.
“I should have returned it to you sooner, only I had no way of contacting you. Why-ever didn’t you advertise?”
“The game is up, Ryder. But you’re so pale. Have you not courage enough to face your felonies? Watch him, Jane! Or he’ll topple into the fire.”
“Is it really?” he asked, reappearing by the attic window with ewer in hand. He turned it over in the light, looking, no doubt, for some maker’s mark. Watson has always had a soft spot for silver with a pedigree. “Whose is it? Yours or mine?”
It took them both working together to uncoil the rest of it. When he was finally freed, Holmes struggled to his feet with Watson’s aid and gave one or two half-hearted attempts at a stretch before collapsing onto the settee. Braided ligature marks in red and purple criss-crossed their way along Holmes’s limbs. Rewards for his fool-hearty attempt.
“I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies,” said she, “Send him to jail now, and he will be a jail-bird for life! No. I do not think we will hear of any more criminal exploits from Mr. Ryder. This experience has, I believe, frightened some sense into him. See if it doesn’t!”
the fine free-thinkers of the Royal Society?” asked Holmes, “Proffering any new technological wonders with which to revolutionize the medical sciences?”
By the glow through the fanlight, I could see Miss Holmes had been right to suspect him of drink; his face had a reddened, mottled appearance, the sort caused more by bad habits, than by the cold.
Watson could not help but smirk as Lord Ansley bemoaned the ‘middle-class manner of the chap who answered the door’. As his Lordship paced the sitting room, Watson wondered whether or not to tell him that only the week before that ‘middle-class chap’ had had an audience with Her Majesty the Queen.
From the mantlepiece, the eyes of the bronze ibis bore into Watson in their hungry gaze, hotter than the sun in that Damascus market.
“Has it returned to life and flapped out the kitchen window?” Miss Samuels asked sardonically, much to the amusement of the other girls.
But my remark was premature, as at that same moment there was a great cacophony of overturned buckets and smashed crates coming from the same stall. We hurried in the direction of the commotion and watched as a tall, russet-haired fellow in a white apron stood in the stall doorway, shaking his fist at a whinging figure crouched before him.
“No, no, he found it. The owner is unknown. A fascinating intellectual problem, to be sure. Listen, and I shall tell you how it came here.”
Shirley Holmes had opened her mouth to reply, when there came a desperate cry from elsewhere in the house. I sprang at once to my feet, and, feeling Miss Holmes’s hand upon my elbow, would have charged into unknown dangers, had not the door to the sitting room flown open at that moment, revealing the cook, Mrs. Burns, clutching a hand to her chest, her face flushed and gaping in astonishment.
He made his way across the room toward me, his eyes set upon the uniform which I had laid out atop an old writing desk.
“Exactly. Yet, now it is quite shabby and worn, all suggesting that, while he could afford a good quality hat three years ago, he has not be able to purchase one since. As to his powers of foresight—these holes here in the lining are from hat-securers. They are never sold with the hat, always an extra. That he considered them a worthy investment at the time suggests prudent care for the future, while the fact they have since been lost, along with his fortunes, suggests the opposite. A man who goes from rich to poor, and from prudent to careless in three years is usually the victim of some demonic force or other. Peterson’s account of the man staggering home at four in the morning would make drink the likely culprit.”
“You know my methods,” Miss Holmes replied. From the pocket of her dressing gown she drew a lens and handed it to me, eyes alight with mischief. “Take a look for yourself and see what you can deduce about the man who has worn it.”
We turned our faces southward and strode on, though to what conclusion, I could hardly then imagine. It all seemed so improbable; the goose led to a man, led to a man, led to a man… but I could not fathom how it led to a jewel. I knew better than to ask Miss Holmes for her opinion. It was a founding tenet of hers never to speculate before knowing all, and her eagerness to press on to Covent Garden told me she knew no more than I.
I turned my head to glance up at her. Between the tall grey hat she wore and the woolen muffler wrapped about her neck, her face was framed on all sides. In the lamplight, the curve of her nose and the sharpness of her brow seemed all the more handsome. I felt the brandy’s warmth rising in my cheeks as I recalled her words to the landlord.
“Gone as well! Dropped his goose and hat, and took to his heels. No doubt he was startled by Peterson’s sudden appearance, and in his, shall we say,
“You aren’t my patient,” Watson scoffed. “If you were, I’d be charging you two bob a stitch. Hold still, will you?”
Holmes did not know if his affections were returned, though he suspected as much–approximately a 61% likelihood, if such things could be measured in percentages. Shyly, he stole a glance at Watson beside him in the loge. As the music swelled, Watson reflexively gripped Holmes’s forearm. 67%.
“I was just wondering what I’d done with it. I had a notion of trying my hand at a sort of sub-continental adventure story. You know—tiger hunts, traipsing through the jungle, roaming bands of thugees, that sort of thing. Thought I might have some notes stashed away in here. Something of my time in India.”
Mycroft rises at half past six every day, even Sundays. He stretches, washes, dresses, breakfasts (four eggs, two rashers, toast with butter and jam), reads the paper, does this and that, keeping excellent time, like a figure in a German clock. A routine is a comfort and a prison.
These were the first words which greeted the good doctor as he stepped into the sitting room one fine July afternoon to find his friend writhing on the hearth rug, trussed and bound like a prize pheasant.
“Ah, yes, I’d nearly forgotten. There are tallow stains here, all along the brim and crown. One stain, possibly two or three, may be due to random chance, but I count over thirty. He therefore must come into contact with burning tallow quite often. As we already established he is something of a home-sitter, it stands to reason it would be at home. In any event, he didn’t get these stains from a gas-jet.”
There was a faint murmur of agreement among our audience. Miss Holmes set the hat back on the sewing table. A satisfied smile crept across her lips. I sat there, admiring her genius and the way the faint afternoon sun made her grey eyes sparkle.
It is a difficult thing for an Englishman to hate the rain. Not being terribly fond of the outdoors, I have never been bothered by it, and, indeed, take a small measure of satisfaction in being snug indoors while the rain carries on. Sherlock, on the other hand, can see nothing but the destructive force of the storm, which obliterates foot prints, cigarette ash, and so many measures of sin.
Mr. Baker was delighted by the substitute. It was a fat, fresh goose, a fine looking candidate for any dining table. Silently, I wondered how Miss Holmes had managed to afford it.
We set to work again. A tallboy was unearthed, its drawers pulled open, its contents sorted. A pair of rugby boots—to the jumble. An ornate bone topper, which had once been attached to a walking stick, I kept on the remote chance its stick might be found or another might be crafted for it. Three pair of bracers, a seemingly-functional hot water bottle, and an odd assortment of buttons would require further inspection.
“Have you?” he asked. His hands came to rest on my knees, and mine upon his. There was that impish smile, half-hidden beneath his mustache, which had first won me over a lifetime ago. He continued, “Suppose I were to augment my terms in light of the circumstances?”
, he sees once more the oaks, limes, and fens of his ancestral home; smells the chalky damp of the halls; thinks distantly, fondly, of a friend he’d once had… the wisest and best man he’d ever known.
“It was more a conversation about whether or not it’s advisable to use green wallpaper in nurseries.”
“Oh, but I haven’t—“ I stammered, looking at the full glass before me. Without thinking, I tossed it back before dashing to join Miss Holmes on the street.
And no more words were needed. Mr. Ryder bolted from the room. We heard the knocking of boots on the stairs, the bang of a door, the sharp reprimand of Mrs. Hudson, who does not permit such extremes. Then, there was silence once more. When Miss Holmes turned back to me, I could see she had been crying.
Thank you again for your invaluable help in the Cadogan West affair. I regret to be requesting your aid again so soon, but I was wondering if you could put me in contact with your brother, Mycroft. I have been unable to find him since the case’s conclusion, all of my inquiries at Whitehall have been met with a stone-faced insistence that no such person exists, and I must contact him urgently as it seems he accidentally made off with my umbrella…
“Quite true, my dear man, quite true. Still, I hate to see art in the hands of someone unable to appreciate it. I considered that ewer the bonus for keeping my opinions of
It was a short and brutal fight. Fifteen minutes, start to finish, but with enough blood in the sawdust by the end for a championship bout. Watson couldn’t help but recall the time Holmes had sent Mr. Woodley home in a cart. How was it Holmes had put it?
“Three months is a long time, my dear Watson,” he wrote, “and I do not trust myself to behave like a gentleman.”
“Can you?” he asked, his dark, beady eyes narrowing at the two of us. “What can you possibly know of it?”
Someone on the other side of the bar had called out to Big Joe. Watson watched his broad back disappear among the crowd before downing the rest of his beer with a grimace.
“Ah, Mr. Henry Baker, isn’t it? Tell me, sir, is that your hat?” Miss Holmes asked, pointing to the sideboard where the object lay.
Miss Holmes drained the last ruby drops of claret from her glass with relish, the color of the wine seeming to spread across her cheeks.
“My dear Jane, there lies the problem,” Miss Holmes said with a smile. She settled back into her chair and steepled her fingers before her. “While there
Watson shook himself free enough to draw the wallet from his waistcoat pocket. Two five pound notes appeared and disappeared in a flash as the bookie snatched them from Watson’s fingers with practiced ease.
choose the one day I actually had somewhere to be. Couldn’t possibly have waited until I came home.”
“I’ll hear no more about you and your geese!” shouted the tall man, “The Devil take the lot of you! Mark me—if you come ‘round here again, I’ll set the dog on you. You’re so curious about them geese, you bring Mrs. Oakshott here; I’ll answer to her. But not you—what’ve you to do with any of it? I didn’t buy them geese off you, did I?”
“Shillings are not as plentiful as they once were,” Mr. Baker admitted sheepishly, “It is such an old hat, I thought the odds not particularly favorable that anyone would bother to return it. At least, not favorable enough to bet my meager coin against. So you see, sir, I really am grateful.”
Some boys have aquaria, or keep toads in boxes, I had Sherlock. How amusing, how enthralling to watch him learn first how to hold a spoon, then how to decline Latin, and, at last, that he was much more clever than the rest of them. While I have always enjoyed watching him learn, I never supposed he had anything to teach me; nevertheless, watching them now, together, I am learning what it means to love.
“You’re a good man, Mycroft Holmes,” Greg said, a sentiment he had expressed before but one he knew Mycroft was often hesitant to accept or believe.
Bunny, unable to speak, picked up a handful of the remains of his paper dolls and held them out to his Daddy and Papa, then collapsed onto the floor as the men came closer to him.  His face pressed into the carpet where the torn paper dolls were scattered.  He cried over the ruined paper dolls and because he wanted his Little Mermaid night shirt and his pacifier, but, more than anything, he cried because he knew it was Sherlock who had done this to his dolls, Sherlock who had wanted him to be sad.
Mycroft knew he and John had never discussed John’s desire to wet, but Mycroft and Greg had discussed the issue at length when Mycroft had arrived at Baker Street.  And it had become clear that both men could see the torment John was under regarding the issue.
Greg stopped the movement of the rocking chair and helped Bunny sit up on his lap so that he could see his kid’s face and eyes.
Nevermind.  He wiped the saliva onto his pant leg and pushed the pile of crayons towards Bunny, who nodded with an enthusiastic smile.
“Close your eyes, little one,” Greg said when he caught Bunny in a yawn.  “It’s past your nap time and it’s been a long morning.  You could use the rest.”
“I thought I might be seeing you tonight,” Mycroft said as John took a seat at the kitchen table across from him.  “Are you doing okay?”
“Not a baby,” he said, knowing what Mycroft was suggesting, but the words were more hesitant than argumentative.
Greg may have attempted to assure him that whatever it was that had made Mycroft so concerned about a female Bunny interacting with Sherlock was not his fault, but John had been able to see even while young that it hadn’t been exactly true.
“How much longer?” Sherlock asked, stretching his body to tense all of his muscles and then flopping back onto the seat with a groan when he was met with silence.
But Sherlock’s words only made Bunny cry harder, and as he felt the pull-up thick and heavy and his bladder still emptying, he knew it would leak even before he felt the trickle of urine run across his thigh.  Bunny knew Sherlock could see the pull-up leaking down his leg and onto the floor, and he couldn’t do anything more than collapse onto the ground and hug his knees into his chest, hiding his blushing face and trying to keep Sherlock from seeing that he was still wetting himself.
Sherlock rubbed at his eyes and stifled a yawn.  He pulled out his mobile to text John, then second-guessed.  John hadn’t been in touch, and Sherlock shouldn’t disturb him while he was with his sister.  He wanted him to have a good visit; he knew how much it meant to John.
John seemed to relax a bit at Sherlock’s nickname, which Sherlock indeed had used in order to tell the man it was alright for him to stay small.
Wow, I definitely got myself into a bit of trouble by trying to update two stories at once.  The first 2 chapters of this story were already written when I started updating, but in the process of writing and editing chapter 3 and 4, there were some developments that came about which then changed the course of the events of "Weekend at the Lake."  I had to go edit Weekend a second time so that the narrative will work between this story and Weekend.
John smiled, at comfort with the thoughts in his mind for what felt like the first time since he had begun ageplaying.  It would all be okay.
“Bud, did the Bunny tell you he wanted to be fed?” Mycroft asked, ignoring for the moment how much of a drama queen Sherlock was being about his vegetables.
“Daddy, I was such a bad boy at the store and in the car.  I have to tell Uncle Greg sorry and then sit in time-out for a really, really long time, okay?”
John could not find the energy to tell him off for the praise or the childish endearment.  He knew Mycroft meant well, that he could not help but see John for what he was after his worst nightmares: vulnerable and a bit broken.  There was a way in which ageplay carried over into their adult relationships, and it had recently become increasingly clear that Mycroft viewed John as a second younger brother, as much perpetually child in his eyes as was Sherlock.  It was frustrating, particularly when he treated John gently when they happened to be in public, but John supposed it was rather inevitable given the way he depended on Mycroft while in headspace, given the way he’d been unable to keep his insecurities tucked away.
“I’m scared,” John mumbled, pulling at his lower lip where he sat at the kitchen table across from Greg.  He realized he was sucking his thumb and yanked it out of his mouth, wiping his fingers on his trousers.  What if Uncle Greg got angry if he sucked his thumb or misbehaved on accident? Greg had never been angry before while the boys were little, but that was when he was with Sherlock, too.  Did he know the rules Mycroft used for John, the rules that were different than Sherlock’s rules?  What if Uncle Greg wasn’t as nice when it was just the two of them alone?
But Greg breathed a sigh of relief when Bunny grinned wide.  The boy actually giggled, no longer in danger of breaking down into full-blown tears.
Mycroft hummed his assent.  “We’ll need to settle on one eventually.  Your own, separate from Sherlock’s.  For now, what do you think about the household rules?”
Sherlock was choosing to ignore the fact that he was having difficulty sitting still, that his frantic rocking back and forth, the jiggling of his legs, and his occasional desperate grabs to the front of his pants may be the reason he was losing the same video game level over and over again.
When Bunny woke up because of his full bladder, it was to Sherlock sitting up in the bed next to Bunny’s cot, staring down at him from his higher position.  Bunny followed Sherlock’s gaze to glance down and see that his nightshirt had ridden up to expose his flowered pull-up, and he quickly shifted and yanked the hem of his shirt down to cover himself.
“I know, princess,” Mycroft said, taking Bunny’s hands in his own.  “And you didn’t do anything wrong, kiddo.  It was just an accident, and you had on your pull-up so there’s no harm done.  Daddy and Papa were only teasing about Santa, love, which wasn’t very nice of us, was it?”
“Missed you, Daddy,” he mumbled, opening his mouth to accept the pacifier pressed against his lips even as he knuckled at tired eyes.
“Here you go, sweetheart,” he said, holding out Bunny’s new headband.  “Don’t forget your unicorn horn.”
“Then there’s nothing wrong about taking enjoyment from this,” Mycroft said.  “What does it make you feel?”
Mycroft arrives to babysit his brother and finds a frazzled John just about at his wit's end with little Sherlock's misbehaving antics.
“Do you need to go potty, baby?" Daddy asked to distract him, and Bunny, trying to be a good boy and keep from crying over losing his pacifier, rubbed his eyes and nodded.  He’d needed to go since he’d woken up, and he knew Daddy must have seen his squirming.
“I won’t pretend I fully understand it,” the taller man said, patting Greg on the back.  “But I’m happy for you, Greggy.”
Sherlock smiled and lay his head against Mycroft’s forearm where it rested on the center console, a sign of affection and gratitude.
But Mycroft could sense the way Greg was hedging, and he raised his eyebrows, knowing there was more information to be had.
Greg had grown quite close to Sherlock, had begun to understand the man’s younger self just about as well as anyone.  But this was a family matter, and it had the potential to impact Sherlock’s adult state of mind just as greatly as his younger.  Only Mycroft had the full subset of knowledge necessary to anticipate the myriad ways Sherlock may be affected.  He needed to be alone.
“Alright, bud,” he said.  “But you should come in to use the loo.  I’ll stay with you the entire time.  We’ll go right in and right out.”
“He looked like him,” Bunny whispered, tears spilling over onto his cheeks once more as he pressed his face into Greg’s collarbone.
Greg smiled and, reaching into the shopping bags he’d earlier dropped off by the sliding glass doors, pulled out the plush bunny John had seemed instantly attached to at the store.  He yanked the tag from the fuzzy ear, then tossed the toy across the table.  Mycroft caught it.  Greg reached in again and found the Little Mermaid nightgown, which he also passed over to Mycroft.
He twisted about and whimpered, dropping the controller to press both hands hard and fast into his sopping crotch, grabbing himself in a last-ditch effort at control, level forgotten.  But it was too late.  Warmth began spreading down his thighs, and he could not make it stop.
Bunny nodded, distractedly, and held out his arms.  Greg lifted the boy from the car and hugged him close, knowing he needed a bit of comfort to calm the nerve he was now feeling.
He began to cry when the coughing was finished, wiping his mouth.  He didn’t want to be sick, and he hadn’t really wanted to get little.  Now he was both, and there were too many feelings to process all at once.
“I'm going to put a call in to Donovan,” Greg said, slipping his hand into his pocket for his mobile.  “Get Anderson and the forensics team out here."
“Okay, now I’m the pirate captain,” Sherlock said as he sat back on his heels, placing his pirate hat back onto his head.  He had removed to it be better able to see while he drew.  The hat crushed the curls of hair on his forehead into his eyes, and Sherlock scrabbled his fingers over his face to push them away.  “And you’re the damsel in distress.”
He wasn’t sure how long he’d been perched in the old treehouse by the time Greg found him.  He’d stumbled upon the structure quickly in his short walk through the woods, and had ventured inside when he’d seen Greg's and his brothers’ initials carved on the doorframe.  The structure was built only a few feet off the ground, stabilized by four trees, which the planks had been cut to accommodate, one at each corner.
This time, Mycroft followed him to the kitchen, taking a seat on a bar stool at the counter while Greg set the tea kettle to boil.
“Now,” his brother said, releasing Greg from the bear hug with a deep breath in.  “I know you’ve usually the one setting bedtimes.  But I’m sending you up to sleep.  You look about ready to collapse.”
“Tell me what scared you,” Mycroft said, trusting that Greg was caring for their little Bunny downstairs and wanting to address the emotional state of the boy in his lap.
When Daddy reached up to graze a knuckle over the bruise on Bunny’s cheekbone, the boy jerked his head backwards to escape the attention being brought to the purpling contusion.
“It’s, ah, it’s alright,” John had said, standing from what had become his bench over the past three hours to glance at the schedule.  “There’s a train coming in forty minutes.  I should have noticed before I called you, but, ah, I can take it back to London.”
John shuffled to where Mycroft was sitting.  Mycroft’s arms were in use, so he hooked the leg of another kitchen chair with his foot and pulled it out from the table until it was positioned across from where he sat holding Sherlock.  Bunny scrubbed with his fists at red-rimmed eyes as he took a seat.  Mycroft hooked his feet on either side of the chair and pulled it and John closer to him, spreading his own legs so John was as close as possible.
“I was so naughty, Bunny,” Sherlock said.  “I was mean and I shouldn’t have torn up your dollies, and I’m so, so sorry.”
“I’m not eating,” he said, pushing the pirate plate Papa had set down at his place away from him.  “And I don’t need a baby plate.”
John nodded; he hadn’t gone on the train, and had started to feel the need over an hour ago.  He’d been trying to keep from squirming on the station bench for the past half hour, the cold making his need rather pressing, causing him to glance around in case there was a secluded spot he could sneak away to should the matter become urgent.
“He’ll realize what you’ve left out, eventually,” Greg said after sitting in silence while Mycroft relayed the events of that morning.
“Sherlock, you know better than to call your brother a baby,” Mycroft warned.  “You’re in time out.  Go stand in the corner.”
“It’s really late, kid,” he said.  “How about we just get you cleaned up with some wipes and fresh sheets?  You can take a bath tomorrow after breakfast if you’d like.”
It was true.  Greg’s family was not exactly picky when it came to welcoming people into their homes, but they had clearly been enamored with John.  Even if they hadn’t sought Greg out to tell him how wonderful they found the man, he would have known from their eagerness to interact with him, from the stories and jokes they shared with him, the hands clapped on his back when they said their goodbyes.
John watched the process with sympathetic amusement, but turned back to the newspaper when he caught Greg’s eye.
“John?” Sherlock said, putting his thumb into his mouth as he lay back down and shimmied down under the sheets.
“Bunny sometimes feels big and he sometimes feels little, just like you,” Mycroft explained.  “But what's a little bit different is that sometimes, when Bunny feels little, Bunny feels like a little girl instead of a little boy.  He might not know where those feelings come from, but they’re there the same way your feelings about being five years old are, and he needs to trust them."
“Right,” Greg said, lost in Mycroft’s tangled web of thought.  He ran a hand down his face in exasperation.  “Meaning...?”
“You’re alright, baby,” Mycroft said, hushing the blubbering boy.  “We’ll get you all cleaned up and everything will be okay.”
No real ageplay in this chapter, just a couple of stubborn boys refusing to acknowledge they need their Daddy and Papa.  the cuteness will return, soon, though!  Enjoy!
“That’s the term used to describe the mental state a person enters into when they participate in ageplay, when they regress.”
He glanced at Greg once more, but then his posture dropped a bit, and Greg knew he’d won for the moment.  Mycroft turned to guide Sherlock into the kitchen.  He looked back at Greg with a raised eyebrow before disappearing around the curve of the hallway.  Greg could hear Sherlock prattling on about dinosaur facts and statistics, and asking for ice cream and cookies.
“No,” he said, reaching for a dinosaur chicken nugget and dunking it in ketchup.  “Uncle Greg, can we get more pink pull-ups?” he asked, mouth full.
“Okay, Uncle Greg,” Sherlock said around the thumb in his mouth.  He felt numb and out of sorts, not up for making any decisions.
“I want to go with you, Papa,” Bunny said, rubbing his runny nose on the back of his wrist, an act for which Daddy gently chastised him as he passed him a napkin.
Mycroft pretended to be deep in thought for a moment, but he soon relented, giving his okay.  Sherlock leaped into Mycroft’s arms with a litany of exclaimed thank yous.
He had to remove his thumb to speak, which was a bit of a surprise.  When had he put his thumb into his mouth, and why did he have the instinct to glance around to see if his pacifier was nearby?  Maybe he was feeling a bit younger than he’d realized.
“I d-didn’t wanna wet my p-pants,” the boy sobbed, burying his face into Mycroft’s shoulder.  “I w-was b-big but I woke up and--and felt s-small and h-had to go so b-bad.”
His own father had barely known the names of his best friends, yet here was Greg, understanding John’s unease even while John did everything in his power to present himself as capable.  It wasn't the first time he'd been struck by the injustices of his upbringing.
--was nonverbal and clingy and acting the toddler.  John was not about to put Greg through that.  No matter how much his worry about Harry had him feeling sick to his stomach, no matter how much he needed someone to calm the self-deprecating comments with cuddles and bedtime stories, no matter how much his heart leaped when Greg called him ‘kiddo,’ the Detective Inspector deserved a celebratory Christmas Eve with his family.  John was not about to take that away from him; not if he could help it.
Mycroft had a lot to discuss with Greg during the boys’ naptime.  He had his reservations about John exploring his feminine side while in headspace, and he didn’t think it wise that Greg had purchased so many items for John which allowed him to do just that.
“Besides,” Sherlock said after a moment.  He smirked and looked down at John with mischievousness.  “I wouldn’t take ageplay away from you just as you’re coming to terms with your own propensity for pissing yourself.”
“Can I talk to her?” he asked, clearly eager to set things right.  “I don’t want her to be sad and never play with me again.”
“Hey, none of that, alright?” John said.  “It was a hard day for both of us.  Maybe we just let ourselves off the hook for once?”
Sherlock squirmed a bit in Mycroft’s arms, the words hitting a bit too close to home.  He’d been told the same thing after punishment far too often.  But Mycroft patted him on the thigh and Uncle Greg ruffled his hair as he came to stand behind them, and he settled.
Remember a few chapters back, when I said I would probably finish up this story in 2 or 3 chapters? Well, we're 2 or 3 chapters later and we've still got a bit more to cover of the weekend, so expect at least a few more chapters before this one is wrapped up and a new story in the series begins.
“I know you’re not feeling well, kiddo,” Daddy said.  “But that doesn’t mean we ignore the rules and act disrespectfully.  Do you understand?”
John cried because he wanted Mycroft.  But he also cried because Uncle Greg was being so nice to him, and wasn’t judging him, and didn’t mind that he had yelled, and had let him choose dinner, and had put out his lion, and didn’t seem to think he was a baby even after he had more than likely seen his pacifiers and could see how much John liked his new baby bunny blanket.  And he knew he shouldn’t want Mycroft when Uncle Greg was doing just about everything right. But he did.  He wanted him more than perhaps he ever had, and that hurt.
“The little one’s got you wrapped around your little finger,” Greg had teased after dinner as the boys colored in the living room and he and Mycroft took care of the dishes.
“Remember,” Greg said, guiding Bunny’s thumb away from his mouth by gently pulling at his wrist.  “Your tongue has an owie on it.  No sucking until bedtime.”
“Alright, buddy,” he said, shifting the car into park and taking off his seatbelt in order to turn himself fully towards the kid.  “Talk to me.”
Now, aged down and seated at the kitchen table in Daddy’s lap while Papa pointed out the details of their very own potty training charts, Bunny felt less sure about the whole idea.  Sherlock had spent the morning fighting against headspace and was in a grouchy, pre-teen mood.  Bunny had dropped into an emotional, clingy headspace as soon as the opportunity arose, but was feeling nonverbal and very young.  He was nervous, afraid of what he had gotten himself into and unsure of his young self after so many long weeks of staunchly remaining adult.  It was all a bit overwhelming.
John yanked the duvet off of the mattress into a pile on the floor, then began stripping himself of his wet pajama trousers, which were hanging heavy on his hips.
“My name is Holmes and it is my business to know things, which others do not. Pray, step into the cab, Mr. Ryder, and I shall be able to tell you everything you wish to know.”
I shrugged and sat down on an old trunk. Feeling I had earned a rest, I drew my pipe from my pocket and cast about for matches.
Mr. Ryder swayed, knocking against the mantelpiece. I reached over and grabbed his sleeve, steering him slowly back to his chair. He stared at me with frightened eyes, as though I were a specter. Miss Holmes returned the gem to her pocket and smiled.
With a tedious and effusive ‘good evening’, Mr. Baker made his departure, leaving Miss Holmes and myself alone in the library.
“What about the hat?” I asked. In spite of my hunger, I was curious how this battered old felt could have held Miss Holmes’s interest.
“But, Shirley… if this John Horner stole the carbuncle, what did he do with it? I mean, how did it end up in a
This was how we found ourselves one bright and golden morning in May, not out in the garden, nor enjoying a walk along a country lane, but instead hunched over in the attic-room, picking at the detritus of our combined sesquicentennial years on this Earth, bickering as to which of our heirlooms to part with.
“After you welshed him at the Derby, I thought we all agreed you’d do better as a spectator than a speculator.”
At that, she raised her head, and, for the first time since I had entered our room, looked at me. Her hand reached across the space between our beds and sought mine. I gave it to her willingly, and was rewarded with a beatific smile.
So it was that by the time I returned to Baker Street, the frosty day had become a bitterly cold night. As I neared 221, I spotted a man, his overcoat buttoned up to his chin, standing on the front steps. A
He asked the barman for a gin and, as the fleshy, imposing form of McMurdo joined Holmes in the ring, the doctor swallowed his drink. The two men faced one another, sized each other up. McMurdo did seem larger than ever. Softer, though, a bit stooped in the shoulders. Next to him, Holmes looked like a miniature. A toy soldier with ropey bruises across his arms.
“I daren’t even try. Good Lord, I can’t remember having been so thin as all this—look at this collar! I must have been a waif. I think the trousers are still in here as well—those will really be good for a laugh.”
“What about the wife?” asked Miss Jones, clutching her dog to her chest, “You said she had ceased to love him.”
I shall spare the reader what came after, for such scenes are perhaps less picturesque and certainly less energetic than they once were. But, suffice it to say that by the time we made our way to the garden, we were forced to share our meal with a horde of ants and a rather persistent wasp. Still, the weather was splendid with a light breeze perfumed with the last of the peony blossoms. Even a modest meal is a feast in such surrounds.
“Well,” he concluded after a moment, “If it hasn’t been missed for over a decade, I suppose there isn’t much harm in holding onto it a while longer. It would look quite handsome on the sideboard, don’t you think?”
In the foothills of the Himalayas, there is an Englishman who lives as a wandering pilgrim. He sits in his lowly hut, writing letters he does not dare send. They always begin the same way: “My dear Watson, please forgive me.”
“It is. You were in no shape to fight this afternoon. You even admitted it, which is—well, I shouldn’t have insisted.”
I washed up and changed from the dreadful starched collar of my uniform. How shall I describe the feeling I had that afternoon to be in my own clothes once more? Many may write it off as a woman’s frivolity, but there is much to be said of the comfort and cheer that a pair of slippers or a simple gown hold, particularly for the lady professional. A metamorphosis from the seriousness of toil into a more gentle reality.
In the light of his consulting room, Watson was pleased to discover things weren’t as bad as they looked. Only a broken thumb, some bruising to the ribs, a split lip. The worst of it was a gash along Holmes’s hairline where his head had collided rather unceremoniously with the lip of a water bucket. Benign, but a wellspring for bleeding and in need of stitches. He mopped Holmes’s brow and set to work.
“So they does. And that’s just the kinda bloke I am—forgivin’” Big Joe agreed, his grip on Watson’s shoulder tightening. “You wouldn’t ‘appen to ‘ave the rest of me money with you, would you, Doc? Cash this time.”
We walked briskly, arm and arm, looking to all the world as any other young couple. Cold as it was, the streets were quiet and calm. In such weather, the yellow glow of lamplight in the windows seemed so inviting, almost holy. It was easy to imagine that behind every pane of glass was a happiness, a love, a family; in my adventures with Miss Holmes, however, I knew, too, how likely it was that those same rooms concealed something devious, even deadly.
MUMMY'S CURSE STRIKES AGAIN: POLICE SEEK LOOT FROM PRINCE'S TOMB AS MYSTERIOUS PLAGUE CLAIMS ANOTHER LIFE.
Mycroft Holmes was not a man to be swayed by fashion; he had withstood bowlers and ribbon ties, plaid suits and square shoes all with equal disinterest. Imagine the laundress’s shock, then, when Mr Holmes, having come into possession of a silk pyjama suit, promptly requested all his nightshirts be converted into dust rags.
“Of course, we do still have the trimmings of the one you lost, should you want them. Feathers, bones, crop…”
Watson had always enjoyed his signature. He liked the way it looked at the bottom of a patient note, across the top of a story sent off to The Strand, on a tender letter to a loved one. But when the time came to sign the affidavit regarding the events at Reichenbach, the black curl of his name across the page was the ugliest thing he had ever seen.
“Yes. A remarkable creature, that goose. It’s little wonder you should be so interested in it. It laid an egg after it was dead—the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here, in my waistcoat pocket.”
Holmes’s voice was a velvet rumble. Watson glanced up to find his friend looking, in spite of the hand splint, bruises and bandages, quite comfortable. Handsome in his own, roguish way. There again was that look in his eyes that made Watson’s face hot.
Miss Holmes and I shared a glance, our eyes affirming that we both understood: Mr. Baker had no idea of the treasure concealed within his goose.
“You could have chosen a better time, you know,” Watson remarked, sinking into his own chair with a disgruntled harrumph. “Suppose I hadn’t returned for supper, what would you have done?”
Her words caught me off-guard. I confess, I flushed to hear myself called ‘wife’. I was stammering for a reply when the landlord interjected.
“Very well,” said the doctor, fetching his stick from the stand by the door. He gave the knob a twist, drew his blade and, with a quick stroke, severed the lines connecting Holmes’s hands to his ankles.
“Did you?” asked Miss Holmes, leaning her elbows on the bar with such casualty, one would think her a frequenter. “I know a couple of salesmen down that way—do you remember the fellow’s name?”
The words were no sooner out of my mouth than there came the sound of Mrs. Keeler’s tread upon the attic stair. She appeared from behind a brace of snowshoes and proclaimed the luncheon table was set in the garden and urged us not to delay, lest the insects get to it first. With that, she trotted back down the steps, blissfully unaware of the position she’d forced upon me.
The crowd was stirring now. Gone was the sour-noted piano refrain, replaced with the hum and buzz of speculation and wagers. Watson bundled up Holmes’s discarded things and followed him towards the edge of the ring.
Miss Holmes gave a triumphant harrumph and offered her hand to help me into the cab. I smothered my own astonishment to smile reassuringly at the man. It was an awkward, silent ride back to Baker Street. All the while, our new-found companion fidgeted and jostled with nervous energies.
Holmes rolled forward, putting his head between his knees, his back making an audible crack as vertebra slid into their proper alignment.
Watson’s initial reaction was one of shock, which was, in and of itself, disappointing. After five years at Baker Street, he really
“It certainly is something to think about—rendering your helpless, pliant… I could find quite a few uses for you.”
“I see. And the temptation of easy wealth was too much for you, I gather? Still, it was a cruel jest to pin the theft on this man Horner, the plumber. But that is precisely what you did, isn’t it? You knew that Horner, once convicted of the same, would be the ready suspect. And clearly he was, as he sits now in jail, where your evidence has put him. But it was not Horner who stole the jewel, was it? It was you. You broke into the Countess’s bureau. You took the jewel from its case. You—”
“I believe I have all the essential facts of the case, though there are one or two details which I am curious to know. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar’s?”
“Shirley,” I asked in a low voice. “Why did you say that to the barman? About my being your wife, I mean.”
You once inquired, perhaps rhetorically, if I ever cared about my brother’s wellbeing. Let me assure you that any fraternal concern I possessed was quickly dispensed the moment he entered the schoolyard as a boy. Ordinarily, I believe, it is the older sibling who defends the younger against tormentors, but Sherlock had a murderous straight left, even then; I have never since had cause to worry.
Watson’s eyes crinkled with amusement. A chortle rose from the back of his throat, breaking out into a guffaw.  He shook his head.
Miss Holmes held the hat aloft and gazed at it with that peculiar introspective fashion of hers. By now, half the denizens of 221 Baker Street were gathered in the sitting room, eager to witness what Alice Stamford called ‘the show’. While it angered me to think of Miss Holmes’s talents regarded as no more than a cheap parlour trick, it nevertheless amused Miss Holmes. She had a flair for the theatrical and was apt to indulge it in such moments.
And that it was. A bright red wool tunic, trimmed at the collar with a captain’s crown and star. Though  lately it had served more moths than monarchs, the brass buttons which decorated the chest still shone with all their patriotic splendor. Forty-five years in his company, and I had never once laid eyes on my soldier in uniform.
“No, you wouldn’t,” Holmes repeated. “You said it was a sure thing—when has my losing ever been a sure thing?”
“I told you I was too tired to fight. I wouldn’t have gone if it wasn’t for your insisting. You… you and your
Though it was to me that she spoke, it was not I who needed convincing. I rose and moved to her side, wrapping my arm about her waist. When she looked at me, I could not help but smile.
Holmes took a deep breath, forgetting his tender ribs, and hissed. He took another, shallower one and sighed.
from a side table and buried his face in its pages. “Do you suppose Big Joe’ll consider it a forfeit? I—where are you going? Holmes!”
“Excluding, naturally! I shouldn’t want the town council accusing us of encouraging gambling or card-sharping.”
a card tied to the goose’s leg which read ‘For Mrs. Henry Baker’ and, while the initials ‘H. B.’ are inscribed in the lining of this hat, there are no less than three
“No, Holmes, I don’t hate you,” he said from behind his hands. “I could kill you, but I don’t hate you.”
They arrived in time to enjoy two, mildly-stale beers each before a meaty four-fingered hand clamped onto Watson’s shoulder.
It is a truth, which ought to be universally acknowledged, that a crowded omnibus on a winter’s evening is one of the least pleasant places for a young lady. While it is much preferred to walking, particularly in icy weather, and more affordable than a cab, there is a propensity for ‘bus wheels and gentlemen’s hands to go sliding into places they should not. The former is liable to impede traffic and break axles, while the latter adds insult to injury, and, if a lady is in possession of a good hat pin, injury to insult.
So I sat, drawing my feet up under myself as I listened to the story of the hat and the goose. The facts were baffling in their simplicity: at four o’clock on Christmas morning, Peterson was returning home to Tottenham Court Road, having completed his rounds for the night. Before him walked, or, by Peterson’s account, staggered a man—evidently very full of ‘Christmas cheer’—with a fat, white goose slung over his shoulder. As they neared the corner of Goodge Street, the man was set upon by a pack of roughs. A brawl ensued, a window was smashed, and as soon as Peterson rushed forward to protect the man from his assailants, the whole lot dispersed into the labyrinthine alleyways.
“Precisely so. And now, Jane, I believe there is one more bird for us to investigate this evening. Shall we venture into the kitchen and see what Mrs. Burns has saved for us?”
“Good evening,” replied he. The man glanced from me, to the brass plaque beside the door, which read: ‘Mrs. Hudson’s Lodging House for Young Ladies’. “I… I am afraid I’ve got the wrong address.”
Miss Holmes smiled at me, a fond smile, which set my blood afire. “Oh, Jane… you see more than you know. You are simply too timid in drawing your inferences.”
“Ah, yes, of course,” I said, with no small amount of annoyance in my voice. I sat on the edge of my bed and bent down to unbutton my boots, stretching my tired, stockinged feet towards the fire. It was a cold night, and the windows were thick with ice crystals. “I suppose, homely as it looks, that this old hat has some deadly story linked to it, that it is the vital clue which may lead to the solution of some crime—the chapeau of a murderer?”
It was early still. Though the ring had been cleared, the crowd was docile as a cart horse. Masses of thick-necked, low-browed roughs in threadbare jackets hovered about in a morose quiet, staring into dirty glasses and muttering to one another in low voices. In the corner, a worn-out little man at a worn-out little square piano beat out an unforgivably tinny rendition of “Asleep in the Deep”.
–if not for Mycroft’s sake, then for propriety’s, or possibly, for our own. I should be lying, if I did not admit there is a certain, youthful thrill to be had waiting behind the summer house on a moonlit evening, listening carefully for the sound of a familiar footfall, or the quiet call of your name from your beloved’s lips…
“I’ll get a clothes-dummy and put it up in my study. Then I can imagine I’ve a handsome, young soldier at my beck and call.”
His face bore a serious expression. Or, the best attempt he could manage at one—there was a crinkling about the eyes which gave him away.
Not that I am alone in my untidiness! As medical men go, Watson is by far the most bohemian and relaxed fellow I have ever had the good fortune to encounter. An odd pile of books here or an unwashed teacup there hardly registers with him, and he is tolerant, if not exactly accepting, of my peculiar habits concerning tobacco storage. He is also a man of the world, who has travelled far and wide, both at my side and independently, and he, too, has amassed a rather unusual collection of oddities which befit such a man. Among his more harmless vices is the queer love of regional mementos manufactured specifically for the Englishman abroad.
I have said that when she is in drag parts, however convincing they may be to others, I see only Shirley Holmes. That is not entirely true. There is an expression she makes while in her gentlemanly disguise, a faint tilt of the head, and a debonair smile, which fills me with a girlish excitement, so that I, too, am apt to forget. Miss Holmes looked at me then, with that same expression, her eyes bright with such mischief that it felt almost wicked to be alone with her.
Miss Holmes squeezed my hand tightly. “Promising, Jane, this sounds very promising, indeed. Whenever else has a man been in such an agitation about geese? Come, let’s see what we can make of this fellow.”
to have outgrown the ability to be surprised. Compared to the usual parade of police inspectors, tramps, poor-unfortunates and, once, a particularly irate ostrich, this was practically a non-event. Thusly, Watson’s shock gave way to an all-too-familiar feeling reserved specifically for Mr. Sherlock Holmes—a feeling of fond aggravation.
“Then, go and ask the Devil, for all I care. I’ve had enough of you. Our of here!” With that, the tall man lunged forward sending the other skittering off into the darkness.
A commotion ensued. Miss Jones’s Pekingese danced between our legs, yapping all the while. With a bit of wrestling, we managed to coax Mrs. Burns into an armchair. There was no water at hand, but a splash of brandy brought her around in a pinch.
“Ah,” exclaimed I, after a few bites, “I cannot tell you how glad I am to have something besides beef tea and cold toast. Even for Christmas, the best the nursing staff received was a bit of roast and stewed carrots.”
Back at Baker Street, Holmes wrinkled up his nose and tsk’d, “They’ll give you thirty days for that, you bouncer.”
We hurried through the market after the curious little man. Miss Holmes, in flat shoes and trousers, was much quicker than I, and in short measure managed to overtake our quarry. She seized him by the shoulder, causing him to cry out in alarm. I hurried to her side.
With that, she brought my wrist to her lips and pressed a tender kiss there, her eyes alight with mischief.
Holmes’s cheek was warm against the palm of his hand and he could feel Holmes’s pulse beneath the tender bruising. They grinned at one another with tired, world-weary grins.
Miss Holmes is a collector of unlikely friends. Some days, I suspect she must be acquainted with half of all Londoners, for everywhere she goes it seems there is someone who recognizes her, or credits her with the solution to one of their problems. While she is not, regrettably, universally well-liked, she has a particular rapport with the veterans who serve as night-watchmen and commissionaires, this man Peterson among them. Still, what a sight it must have been on Christmas morn to see the elderly Peterson calling on the young Miss Holmes with a goose and an old battered felt as gifts. I giggled to imagine what the neighbors must have thought.
“Yes. My wife here was talking not an hour ago with a Mrs. Henry Baker. Seems her husband’s a member of your goose club. So impressive was this goose of yours that the wife demanded we come straight down and get one of our own. Isn’t that so, my dear?”
“Well, Holmes,” said Watson, “It seems my dress uniform will be going to the church bazaar after all. So much the better—perhaps it’ll be put to use in a pageant or play or something.”
thought you’d laid your money on McMurdo. And seeing as how you’ve had the most impressive losing streak this year, I thought I’d give you a little bit of a boon. To whit… I… lost.”
“Lottie! Lottie, you’re missing it! Shirley Holmes is going to grace us with one of her divinations!”
“From what I ‘ear you’ll be needin’ it—they say McMurdo’s up to nearly twen’y stone now. Cheers, gentlemen.”
That night, as we entered the library, we were greeted by a tall young man in a brown suit. Or so Mr. Baker believed. Knowing her as I do, I cannot look upon this young man and see anyone other than Shirley Holmes, it never fails to amaze me how wholly convinced most people are by a bit of lime-cream and a confident air.
I do not wish to slander any of the young ladies with whom I share a roof, and our landlady, Mrs. Hudson, runs a most respectable and godly household. It is merely that, as the estimable Charlotte Bronte put it, women feel as men do, ‘they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it’. So it is that all the residents of 221 Baker Street are well-versed in the creation of action.
Mrs. Hudson straightened herself up in preparation for rejection. All of us girls were familiar with this moment, when the ordinarily tender, almost motherly, expression on her face hardened with the sternest of her trade. It was this expression which always preceded a chiding about noise, or a polite reminder of a late remittance. But, before she could speak, Mrs. Hudson’s eyes caught once more the sparkle and glimmer of the stone. As her face softened, I could nearly see the words ‘paid in full’ dance across her features.
As he drew closer, I sat upon the writing table, the tunic and trousers tucked securely underneath me. He came to a stop before me, his legs against my knees. We gazed at each other for moment, my eyes tracing across the face I knew so well.
“Yes, here we are—just as I recalled. ‘December twenty-second, Cosmopolitan Hotel. A plumber by the name of John Horner, age twenty-six, brought up on the charge of having perpetrated the robbery of the gem known as the Blue Carbuncle of the Countess Morcar.’ Let us see… ‘ the stone’s value,’ et cetera, et cetera… Ah, yes. ‘The chief evidence in the case was provided by upper-attendant of the hotel, James Ryder, to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess for repairs. Ryder was called away for a short time, and upon returning to the room, found that Horner had disappeared. A bureau drawer had been forced open, and the Morroccan case wherein the Countess kept the priceless jewel, lay empty on the dressing table. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court’.”
Her thin lips quivered with a smile. “It seemed the most savory explanation for why a young woman such as you would find herself in a public house in the company of a man… Why? Do you object to my calling you that?”
“Ah, Mr. Brownlee, good evening,” said Holmes, drawing his pipe from between his lips. “Watson tells me you two’ve patched things up. That’s very touching, really. They do say to forgive is divine.”
“Oh, sir, please.” Mr. Ryder’s voice was hoarse, his lips trembling as he spoke. “Please, can you tell where it went to?”
“Yes, well… I settled a few accounts last week and have a bit of a surplus. Why shouldn’t I lay a wager when the odds are good?”
“Right you are, Jane. Get dressed, quickly, and take our note down to the advertising agency. Put it in every paper you can name. I, meanwhile, am off to find a goose.”
Inspector Lestrade considered himself an amiable fellow, as game for a joke as any man. But even he could not abide Dr. Watson's smug smile and Mr. Holmes's cackling.
It was late when we arrived at Covent Garden Market. Many of the proprietors were shuttering their stalls, and many a shopper was trying to make his way home with the newly gotten goods. We wound our way through the crowds for some time, until, at last, we came upon a large stall bearing the name ‘Breckinridge’. From a distance, it was clear the stall was shut up for the evening.
, feared getting hauled in for disorderly conduct. So there stood Peterson, with a fine goose and an old hat for his troubles.”
I looked down at my temporary bench. Hard wood, possibly oak. Black paint chipping around the iron fittings which were themselves ringed in rust. I leaned over one end of it. Near the handle was a paper label, faded but still legible. It read: “WANTED ON VOYAGE — HMS ORONTES— HOLD — BOMBAY TO LIVERPOOL”. Around the front was an inscription in bold, white lettering.
Once more, Mr. Ryder dissolved into tears. I confess that I, myself, was moved by his anguish. For a moment, the three of us sat, the sound of Mr. Ryder’s sobs and the ticking of the mantel clock the only sounds. Then, Miss Holmes rose, and gazed into the fire, her hands in her trouser pockets.
“Oh, yes. But the thousand pounds offered for its recovery is barely even a twentieth of its true value.”
“No, no. No crime,” Miss Holmes declared with a laugh. She swung her legs over the edge of the bed, and began casting about for her slippers. “Merely one of those whimsical little incidents which result from having four million human beings all jostling about in the same few square miles. In so dense a swarm of humanity, many a mysterious and improbable combination of events may occur that are striking, or bizarre, but not exactly criminal.”
Her voice was warm, passionate, as when she spoke about her cases, or her aspirations, or when we were cuddled together in bed. We were paused at the corner Endell Street, waiting for a clutter of carriages to disperse. Miss Holmes put her hand on my elbow and bid me to look at her. I shall say no more other than we kissed, and with such tenderness and affection as I hope shall be granted to every lover.
“I don’t want you to do anything for the next week besides rest, even if it means I have to tie you to the bed.”
“And let you collect off a forfeit? No, my dear fellow, I am determined to teach you a lesson in odds. Here, now, be a good boy and watch my clothes, won’t you? It’s nearly time.”
A metallic clank rang out as the needle driver and forceps landed on the bottom of the wash basin. Watson made quick work of tidying the blood-soaked gauze and stoppering the liniment bottle. This, he supposed, was his boxing ring. There was comfort in the routine of surgery, in the familiar smell of antiseptic and ether.
“Yes, I’m afraid we had to, or it wouldn’t have been much good to anyone. However, I do have another goose of about the same weight and quality as the one you lost, if that will be a satisfactory substitute? Miss Watson, would you be so kind as to ask Mrs. Burns to bring in the goose?”
There was a clatter of something which I hoped very much was not the Duke’s Cellini. Watson appeared from behind an upright toboggan, brimming with excitement. He waved me aside and I complied as quickly as my old bones could manage.
“You don’t think I could have actually lost to that ham-fisted Goliath, do you? I’m just glad I managed to hit the bucket on the first fall. Scalp wounds are wonderfully dramatic, don’t you think? Hadn’t counted on him trampling my hand, though—pity, that. I should say whoever pegged him at twenty stone was giving a rather conservative estimate. Probably closer to twenty-three.” Holmes gave his thumb an experimental wiggle and cringed. “…Do you hate me?”
I shook my head in amusement, glancing again at the well-worn headpiece on the sewing table between us. “Oh, but what clue can this hat afford?”
“You’re joking.” Watson sank back against the edge of his consulting table and buried his head in his hands. “Please, Holmes, tell me you’re joking.”
“I can’t imagine why I should!” Mr. Baker declared with a laugh. “Expect, perhaps, as a souvenir of my misadventure. No, this goose will suit me splendidly. Good evening to you, sir, miss, and thank you again.”
"What a marvelous help you were to me tonight, Jane,“ said she, taking my wrist in her hand, “I don’t know how I shall ever repay you.“
Was there, at that moment, a warm little room wherein sat our jewel thief? Or was he, as we were, roaming the icy streets in the lamplight, searching for his lost prize? So lost was I in these musings, that a quarter of an hour passed without my notice. When next I looked, I found we were in Bloomsbury, standing at the door of the Alpha Inn. With a quick glance to Miss Holmes, I pushed open the door to the private bar and was greeted by the bellowing of the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.
“They may be inclined to do so anyway, if we show up to the sale with ten or twenty sets between us.”
Tam o’ Shanter bonnet of green felt balanced atop a head of grey hair. Upon hearing my footsteps up the stairs, he turned and regarded me with a confused gaze.
“You’ll recall,” I mumbled, pipe stem between my teeth, “what a particularly odious person he was during that affair at the Priory School.”
“Further more,” my friend continued, unfazed by these outbursts, “he lives a sedentary life, is middle-aged, has recently had his hair cut, uses lime-cream, and does not have gas laid on in his home.”
At that moment, the door opened, and the both of us were shown into Mrs. Hudson’s library, which, for an extra half-week’s fees, Miss Holmes made use of as her private reception room. A small price to pay to be able to receive guests without suffering an impromptu recital at the piano forte, or the unwanted affections of Miss Jones’s dog. It was small, cheerful room, decorated with rich reds and golds, and furnished with high-backed wing chairs, which never failed to make Miss Holmes look distinguished.
, merely one who has lived long and well and who has made it his business to know a great little about a great lot. As such, odds and ends have a way of clustering about me, burrowing into the corners of rooms, perching on rafters. Bottles of chemicals, criminal relics or other mementos of old cases, notes and newspapers abound.
That night, the Punch Bowl was particularly detestable. Though the evening was cool enough, calm winds made for an unpleasant indoor atmosphere. With no breeze, the open alley windows brought little relief and thick bands of smoke settled in stagnant air, the smell of rank tobacco mingling with the sickly sweetness of spilled porter and perspiration.
At the sight of it, Henry Baker let out a cry of excitement and seized it. “It is! It is my hat—oh, bless you, sir, for returning it. I must admit, this old cap is not very befitting of my years, nor my bearing. I thank you.”
Out went the Inverness, and the rest of the heap along with it. The first incision made, as it were, the task no longer seemed impossible. I reached above an armoire—which was, in all probability, destined for the jumble sale itself—and pulled down a suede bergère hat that I had no memory of ever seeing before.
To the best of my knowledge, my dear friend’s experiences in India were utterly lacking in anything so remotely exotic as a tiger hunt, but I kept such opinions to myself. I have, countless times, witnessed how Watson can transform the most trivial and straight-forward of cases into the highly sensational and flowery retellings which have made him famous. No doubt he could conjure up a tale of traipsing through the brush in search of a Maharaja’s stolen treasure from a few scribblings about marching under the hot sun or being laid up with enteric fever.
“Plenty. I know there was a goose, sold by Mrs. Oakshott to this Breckinridge. And from this Breckinridge, I know it was sold to the landlord of the Alpha Inn, to be given away as part of their annual goose club. I know that it was given away, and to whom, and, what is of much more importance, I know where it is
“Can you help me with this–I’m all thumbs today,” Holmes professed after his fifth unsuccessful attempt to fasten his cuffs. If it was a ruse, Watson didn’t let on that he knew. With surgical precision, he slid the first cufflink in place and smiled as he felt an arm wrap around his waist.
Sherlock glanced over his shoulder at a snivelling John and then turned back to Mycroft.  He took his pacifier out of his mouth and scooted closer to his older brother, not wanting to hurt his little brother’s feelings by speaking out of turn but knowing he just wanted Bunny to be happy again.  Bunny’s sadness was making Sherlock sadder.
But even Mycroft’s forward nature did not seem to shake John’s resolve to take care of his soiled briefs himself.  The man cleared his throat as he blushed at the mention of his accident, but held up a hand to signal that he did not need Mycroft to come any closer.
Greg chuckled and, after putting the car in park and turning off the ignition, stepped out of the driver’s seat and around to the back.  He pulled open the door where John was seated and helped the boy undo the seat belt he’d been struggling with.
“I know you’re a big kid,” Mycroft said, following John’s gaze.  “But I think it might be a good idea to wear a pull-up for naptime, just in case.  How does that sound?”
“He spent nearly the entire car ride kicking and yelling,” Greg concluded.  “By the time I pulled into the driveway he’d already unbuckled himself, and he climbed out of the car and ran into the house before I could even put the car in park, adding to his long list of broken rules for the day.”
“I’ll take care of it,” Uncle Greg said when Mycroft turned to follow after Sherlock.  “You look after the little one.”
“You’ve called me nothing but ‘Mycroft’ all day,” he said, shifting back into confident caretaker.  “Do we need to discuss?”
“I’ll be just a boy, Daddy,” he said, voice desperate as he tried to hiccup back his tears.  “I’ll be only a good boy, okay?”
Bunny ducked his head as Daddy pulled a blanket over each boy, settled himself back between them, and leaned down to kiss Bunny’s head.  Bunny pulled away from his Daddy’s kiss.  He knew he was trying to thank him for being good and letting Sherlock have his way, but Bunny didn’t want to be thanked.  He had given in to keep Daddy happy,  but he was also tired of having to always be the one to give in, was tired of doing things to make others feel good when they only made him feel sad.

Sherlock looked up from where he had been making his alligator climb over his stomach, kicking his legs until Mycroft had stripped him of the wet pull-up and wiped him down.
After getting a fitful little Sherlock to sleep, Mycroft sits John down to explain the inner workings of Sherlock's ageplay.
“Don't be a baby,” Sherlock said, voice harsh, glaring at Bunny because he had broken out of character and called Sherlock by his real name.  “This is how you play pirates.”
“Well,” he said, making a show of deciding that made Mycroft roll his eyes at the syrupy sweetness of it all.  “This little one is brave like a lion, but he needs his pretty nightgown if he’s going to be Papa and Daddy’s little princess, right?”
