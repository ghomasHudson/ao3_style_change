Zeppelin shot him a grin, then reached out, grabbing his finger.
Sam rubbed his chin. "Hmm."
"Good. I demand love when I get home." He grinned, nipping at his chin.
“No. Stop that, Dean,” Cas ordered sharply. “You make me happy.”
Dean looked over at his mate. "How's dinner going? Our boy is about done with his plate."
“Good. I missed her.” He grabbed another bottle of water.
under his breath.
Gabriel nodded, then frowned as he realized he didn't have his phone. "Can you clean up the back yard? They don't need the reminder when we get home. It's a picnic." He looked back at the doctor. "Sorry about that, but it's been a hell of a day."
Once Cas was settled once more, Sam closed his books and picked up the phone. “Is he all set for the night?”
Sam snuggled Gabe as he slowly rocked their chair. “Aside from poor Cas, today was amazing.”
“I don’t care! What did you do to my son?”
Dean paused in sipping his coffee.
“I could cook with you,” Cas offered shyly.
"Because we found Gabriel. He's okay, well... he's... he's been through hell, and when we got there, the son of a bitch had been injecting something into his neck or something and then was standing over his bloody body. He looked
The sound made Cas's dick harden painfully. "Oh..."
Pouring himself into a chair, Dean reached for the drink in front of him only to pause. "More ibuprofen'll help. What time is it anyway?"
Desire rushed through Sam as he let his head fall back. “Please, sir. I need your mouth on my dick. Please. You’re the only one who knows how to take care of me.”
"Good, hm?" Dean smiled as he watched him drinking.
"Food'll be awesome- we didn't have time to stop earlier before the appointment like we thought," Dean explained, watching Gabriel hug his brother.
"Such a good boy. Don't move." Gabriel moved, straddling Sam's hips. "This oil is a massage oil."
"Can you tell me your name?" a nurse asked him, working side by side with Meg, but the man- if he had been conscious- seemed to be rapidly slipping. "Meg, where's the doc?"
Sam stood beside Gabe, amazed as Cas’s eyes followed Dean. “He’s watching Dean...”
Dean gave her a treat, grinning as she took it.
“They… put things… in me…” Castiel’s voice broke as he spoke.
“I still worry,” Cas finally admitted. “He’s young, a veteran, a good man. He deserves so much more than... me.”
"Yes, anywhere you want." Sliding his hands under Sam's shirt, Gabriel moaned at the warm skin.
“Good...” He let out a loud yawn. “Is Cas okay?”
Dean blinked, moving to open the door. "Sammy?" He yawned, completely forgetting that he was still buck-ass naked from his shower.
Sam straightened up and obediently went to his lover’s office. As soon as he stepped inside, he practically felt Gabe’s presence. Everything in the room had Gabe’s touch and it was oddly soothing to him. He retrieved the lube and set it on the edge of the desk as Gabe had ordered.
“So you need to marry him.” Cas closed his eyes. “You won’t find anyone better.”
"He is so sweet." The woman let him out and watched as Gabriel fell in love, taking the ball and rolling it back to the dog, who had markings that looked like angel wings on his back. "His name is Angel."
"So do I." Gabriel stroked Sam's jaw, grinning a bit. "Our girl had you soaked."
Still laughing, Cas held his arms out for a hug. “We both left...the movie...and we had hickies.”
"I want to fuck you against the wall later. Lift you up and push my cock inside of you..." Dean gripped his hips, sliding his hand down to stroke Castiel's cock.
Cas got up and kissed Dean's cheek, then grabbed his bag from beside the door. "Where can I change?"
"Damn right. We protect our family, Emma, and you, Theo, and Ben are part of it." Dean told her.
Climbing into the vehicle's passenger seat, the blind buckled in. "Ready when you are, gorgeous."
Castiel had to laugh softly. “You will never get tired of that, will you?” He teased lovingly.
"Num num?" He told him, putting the pie in his little mouth- or what would fit.
"Do you mind?" Dean's lips stilled on Castiel's skin, and he pulled back a bit.
Considering for a long moment, Gabriel nodded. "All right, loves. Let's get cleaned up in the bathroom, then into bed, okay? You're both exhausted. There's a TV in there if you want to watch while we drift off." And he needed to talk to Charlie.
“She really is.”
“Gabe!” Large hands began rubbing his back. “Gabe, it’s okay.”
“I love when I touch you and render you nearly speechless,” Cas rumbled. “I love thinking of you and touching myself.”
The younger man snorted and nodded. “Probably.”
"How are you doing this morning, Sam?" Dean sipped his coffee with a happy little sound.
“Should we pick bedding for Charlie and our brothers, or let them?”
and pinning him... and fuck, the way he'd taken it when Gabriel'd swallowed him down. There were so many naughty delicious things that he was going to do to him.
"Careful, Charlie... I might enjoy it." Oh, she was so going to get fired for being unprofessional- that just wasn't done.
Sam groaned softly, pressing closer to Gabe. “Love that.”
Dean pulled his legs into a comfortable position, then patted him.
Ah, so he was right. Dean tugged Castiel gently towards the stairs. "Mm... Well, I'll help you to manipulate him some. That, or I'll sneak you some of mine."
“Well...I know one thing. I’m not going anywhere. I’m going to be by your side for all of this.”
Gabriel stirred, groaning. He forced his lashes open, his head pounding. He couldn't think, and the world swam as he looked at his mate.
Smiling widely, Cas stepped into the shower with Dean. The water was perfect as it pulsed down on them and Cas resumed kneading Dean’s ass.
“And I’m looking forward to meeting your extended family.” Even if he was quite nervous. What would they think of him? They were a different breed of people from him, and so impressive...
Amused at the dog, Gabriel scratched at his ears only for the dog to gently take his hand in his mouth and swim towards the edge of the pool. "...Are you trying to save me?"
Sam nodded frantically, closing his eyes. “Please don’t stop. You’re incredible.”
Gabriel smirked, watching Bobby and Dean carefully as the pair headed outside.
James let out a huff and curled into his chest, clearly displeased with being moved abruptly from her cozy spot.
Dean set down the duffle bags, then looked back to Castiel. "Honestly, I was trying to give you an out with your brother. All right?"
Cas shook his head and tucked the ring away again. “I don’t know.”
“So am I.” Cas gladly walked with Dean. “I should have one of the protein shakes Gabe made for me.”
The hotel door suddenly opened and Sam strolled in, dropping his backpack. “Babe?” He looked curious when he saw Gabe hugging another man.
"Cas..." He wasn't wrong. Dean'd seen it enough times to quote it, but what was he supposed to do? Castiel was younger, innocent- though not that much younger. About Sam's age...
When Dorothy sat off towards the corner, Gabriel frowned. "Isn't she joining us?" He whispered to Charlie.
Not wanting to discourage Dean, Cas continued to grab clothes for himself. He worried that if he said anything, Dean would try to take the clothes back, and that was the last thing he wanted.
Gabriel cried out, holding Sam as tightly as he could. His ass gripped him, and he was painfully close
Gabriel moved, helping to get the clothing off of Sam so that he could check him. "Very good, Sam... we're nearly there. You need to let me know when you start feeling pressure, okay?"
He blinked as he felt her hand on his arm. "Oh. That's... thank you. I know it's expensive, seeing a vet."
“Just for the two of us...” Cas closed his eyes, smiling dreamily.
Sam shook his head, wanting to hug the kids but unsure the gesture would be welcome. “No, Theo. You did nothing wrong.”
"Good." Dean praised him, carefully feeding him.
Cas’s eyes flew open and he rocked into Dean’s hand. “Yes!”
“You’re bisexual?”
"Don't need perfect..just you..."
"She is. She's going to be in third grade by the time she finishes learning her name, but she's ours." Gabriel leaned over, kissing Sam.
"Eh, it might be out of my range." He laughed softly, shaking his head. "I mean, is there a required reading that I should do to be able to follow along better?"
“Much better.” His eyes closed as he stroked Dean’s chest.
"Sounds like a nasty person." He wasn't surprised. Michael had his mother's hateful attitude toward those who had less money than he did.
"See? That's my man." Dean smirked, patting his hip. "Let's go."
Gabriel looked at the doctor. "Sam is going to help bathe me after we get into that room. I... I feel vile."
"There are a lot of alpha instincts with that." Gabriel conceded, patting Sam's hand.
Angel tilted his head at Sam, then climbed over into Gabriel's lap- he wasn't upset, just not interested in getting out.
Dean squeezed his hand, hugging him close. "So good. What was left? Pickles?"
Dean tickled the kitten's belly, smiling at it as it tried to attack his fingers. "All right, kitten..."
Tears gathered in Sam's eyes and he dropped to his knees with Gabe. "Gabe, I love you so, so much. Of course, I'll marry you."
"So damn beautiful. My man, my fiance. Wanna feel you come for me, baby." Dean sucked a mark on the curve of Castiel's neck meeting his shoulder, his teeth teasing him in a bite whose pleasure was just this side of pain.
Shit. He was going to be catching his pup. Dean took a deep breath, then focused. If Castiel could deliver them, go through the labor, he could do this.
“I mean taking whipped cream, or some of this cheese, spreading it all over you and licking it off your sweet skin,” Cas whispered.
Cas ran his fingers through Jack ’s messy hair. “We’ll talk about it after the party. I think someone is here already.”
"Then what does that make us?" Gabriel cut off a bite of the crepe, making sure to get a perfect balance of the cream as well as the fruit before holding it up to Sam's mouth.
"Then I'll just work extra hours at the ranch." Grabbing his drink, Dean sipped it with a stubborn tilt of his jaw.
Restlessly shifting his hips.
“It’s true. He has a company credit card because I don’t want him to pay for work expenses,” Cas confirmed.
"I am always careful, Cas." Dean kissed him, running his hands over Castiel's shoulders.
"Oh, Hannah... no, sweetie." Dean hugged her close, rubbing her back. "You and Alfie will move on in your own time. You don't need to do a damn thing you're not ready for."
"Sweetness..." Struggling to keep the laughter off of his face, Gabriel pulled Sam into a kiss, grinning into his mouth. "These." He winked as he put his hands behind his back, leaning over the table.
“Agreed,” Sam rumbled, kissing Gabe softly.
coffee.
"He's a keeper." Nodding towards Castiel, Sebastian watched as Dean's eyes trailed after his lover. That look there was almost perfect.
Stroking them over Castiel's ass, Dean spread the lubricant around his hole, then eased a finger inside. "Good, honey?"
Dean rubbed Castiel's back, handing him his phone that had a picture of the kitten and puppy.
“Okay...” Cas yawned and finally stood upright on his own.
Dean nudged his brother. "That work for you? When's class start?"
"Our wedding, love, was completely perfect." Dean cupped Castiel's face, kissing him softly.
"Cas?" Dean rasped, hugging him close. "You okay?"
Cas watched them intently. "As long as we're not separated…"
Taking a breath, Cas settled between Dean’s legs. “Please tell me if you don’t like this.”
"Nope- there's a doctor coming to examine him," She corrected him firmly.
Smirking, Cas gently tweaked Dean’s nose. “I’m not allowed to have alcohol. But Gabe found this delicious nonalcoholic wine just for me.”
Gabriel sipped at the water, taking a moment to let the cool liquid soothe him. "Thank you, Samshine."
“It’s okay, Tempe,” he assured her sweetly as he quickly found the puppy pads and placed one on the floor.
"Why?" Frowning, Dean went to check on him onto to be stopped by Gabriel.
Dean had taken a quick shower and was in the process of getting dressed when his mate came in. "Hey, you okay?" Maybe he was just worrying about everything- hell, he'd probably been talking to his brother, but…
"Hey, it sounds awesome to me," Dean told him with a grin.
Castiel looked at his big brother pleadingly. “Can’t you convince them to discharge her? You’re a doctor. You know how to watch her oxygen.”
"All yours," Cas breathed as his body adjusted to his mate. "All yours."
Sam shrugged. “It still runs...” sometimes.
Thankful for something to do, Sam nodded and rushed out of the room. He came back a few minutes later with a cup of ice and a glass of ice water. "Here, Dean," he said as he handed his brother the cup of ice. "The nurses were really nice and said Cas could have as much ice as he wanted." He set Dean's ice water within his brother's reach.
Dean grinned, shaking his head as he took a bite of his lasagna. "Just imagine in about a year- we'll have four toddlers."
Cas looked longingly at the headphones. He wanted to hear Dean sing. With a trembling hand, he managed to point to the headphones.
“It’s not as tasty as Dean and Gabe’s apple pie, but it is delicious.”
“We tell him?” Luke was definitely a bit reluctant, but they owed it to their brothers.
Sam had never kissed a man and had only kissed a couple of girls. This was different, so different. Gabe was muscular, but not overly so. He was eager and taking control, and Sam was glad to give it to him.
"Eh, pie's better..." Dean mumbled, moving to sit back down next to Castiel.
“He’s just an ass,” Sam repeated staunchly, his hand gently rubbing Gabe’s arm.
“I love you, Dean...”
"Oh no! What happened to it." Charlie bit her lip, moving to check it out.
"'m fine..." He nuzzled Gabe again and closed his eyes.
Gabriel managed to control himself as he walked Angel. "Sam... I don't like the idea of Castiel moving out. Even if it's with Dean and their pets. That's bad, isn't it?"
Sam sat down beside Gabe while Cas insisted, “I’m really okay. Promise.”
Four heads immediately snapped up and Cas nodded tentatively. “Water?”
"No... I think he didn't tell me something, it's not your fault... and I have a feeling that I know what it is." Remembering the traumatized look on Sam's face... the fear- it was way too close to him.
Sam and Cas both chuckled at Dean’s vehement protest.
"Exhausted. We were using the kitchen to make orders for the shop, and there were a ton that had been prepped ahead of time." Gabriel explained, trying to keep his eyes open.
Castiel grumbled and nuzzled Dean's shoulder. "Mmm."
Gabriel pulled Sam to him, kissing him softly. "You, Sam Winchester, are an amazing man."
"I know. He talks to me too! Mostly when he's on his balcony, Daddy. Does he like Sam? I saw he's gonna marry him!"
“But not too fast,” Sam cautioned as Cas opened the bag.
"Night!" Gabriel and Dean said in unison. Gabriel looked down at Dean as he carried him to his room. "Thanks for the lift. How are you doing?"
"That's my boy, hm?" He grinned, scratching at his ears only for Chopin to be climbing into his lap as well.
“Morning!” Charlie hugged Gabe for a moment.
He pressed into Gabe’s hand and closed his eyes. “How are you not already married?” He murmured.
He closed his eyes and nuzzle into Dean. “For not understanding, you know exactly what to say.”
A rush of fresh slick poured out of Castiel as he writhed under Dean. “Yes, Dean. Yes.”
Gabriel blinked, tilting his head a little. "Seriously?" And he'd worried that it had something to do with his tattoo...
“I’ll have you arrested for assaulting me!”
They so weren't making it through this movie. Dean yawned too, internally grumbling.
“It’s not exactly… orthodox.” She squeezed his hand. “There’s a woman named Missouri Mosely. She has a… a gift.”
"So my man's hungry to the point where I am being sent off on an adventure, hm?" Grinning, Gabriel nudged him gently. "Gotta move for that, Sammich."
“Yeah, That should be fine.”
Weakly Cas tried to get closer to him.
Dean looked over at him, tilting his head. "How about we go see our girl in the morning when we're bright eyed and bushy tailed?" He moved, rubbing his back gently.
Smirking, Gabriel leaned forward and scraped his teeth in a teasing bite. "Then beg for them."
There was a group of people debarking the plane, and Ellen spotted him first. "Bobby!"
“He is,” Castiel agreed warmly. “We’re so lucky.”
Cas took the card and saved Dean’s number in his phone. Then he put the card in his wallet. “Thank you, Dean. You’re being so kind to me.”
"Let me feed you." Gabriel smiled against his lips, grinning as his own stomach growled. "I promise, you can have as many of my kisses as you want."
Sam gasped in pleasure as Gabe's fingers tightened in his hair. "Whoa... do that again."
"Very true. You just have to pout at him." Shaking his head a bit, Dean smiled at the thought. Castiel's eyes were so damn beautiful... "I have a surprise for you."
“Sounds good. What did you have in mind? A slasher or a comedy?”
Cas held the rose delicately, his hands trembling slightly. “I love it...”
“I know.” His lips curled up in a little smile. “But despite it being interrupted… I can’t imagine a better first kiss.”
"You're amazing, and you're going to kick it in the ass."
"So what's your girl's name?" She had the puppy eyes down, and Gabriel knew that they were going to be spoiling her like crazy.
His gaze dropped down and he inhaled softly as he looked at the doctor’s hard cock. Fuck, he was just as big as Sam was... “You do...”
"She's chosen who she likes. Can't blame you, pup. He is gorgeous." He told him with a wink.
Gabriel finished rinsing his mouth, looking up at Sam. "...Something wrong?" Why was his Sam suddenly puce?
"No problem, Professor. I definitely look forward to it." He just had to work on the Milton statue around his garage shifts, Sammy's
“Jack,” Cas interrupted softly. “We have help for that. You just need to worry about being a child.”
"Shh. Cas. I am right here. Don't be sorry " Stroking his fingers through Castiel's hair, Dean sang softly to him.
Dean smirked at Castiel, leaning against the truck. He bit his lower lip and then grinned, slowly pulling it free in a way that promised he was going to do some truly naughty things to Castiel.
"Well... no. I know, I've said it a few times." His cheeks heated, and Dean rubbed the back of his neck. He was a bit loopy from the let down of adrenaline- dealing with Don- the monster- and then the FBI, and then the labor and delivery…
"Hey, hey-" Dean's tone was soft, and he held up the hand that wasn't holding Ben on his lap. "It's okay, buddy. I just thought you might wanna help with them."
After breakfast, the little family cleaned up and drove to the hospital. Jack was still sleepy and Cas indulged him by carrying his boy inside.
Sam snorted. "And with that, I'm gonna go do some paperwork. I'll call you back later, okay?"
“One of yours,” he requested, sitting on the edge of the bed.
“That feels...so good.” Cas breathed deeply and let the new sensations wash over him.
Charlie melted and smiled at the dozing newborn. "Hi, Benny…"
Thankfully, the dishwasher was a quick and easy install, and Gabriel began loading in the dishes.
"Stubborn bitch,” The brothers quipped to each other, both smiling a bit.
"Good, baby?" He reached down, wrapping his hand around Sam's cock and stroking.
"She's getting so big already... I can't believe it." Dean shook his head, smiling.
"You hungry, baby? I grabbed us some food." Cuddling his boyfriend against his chest, Dean smoothed his hair. He felt a bit guilty for leaving, but he'd been sure that Castiel would sleep through it.
"Be safe. We will be there in fifteen minutes." Gabriel hung up the phone, going to his closet to quickly dress. "Someone stabbed Cas. Dean is following the ambulance to Saint Mary's hospital."
he couldn’t sing worth a damn, but he didn’t care.
“Oh yeah. So how are you? I miss you a lot.”
“Dean, you should have told us!” Sam said sharply.
“Fuck, Dean...” he rolled his hips tentatively, trying not to come far too soon.
“Yes, sir.” Sam grabbed the bottles Gabe indicated.
"There you go, Samshine. Look at our little girl..." He grinned, grabbed Sam's bagged phone to take pictures.
Sam heard the water rushing and he looked around curiously.
“Sorry...” Cas murmured.
Dean cried out, his hand tightening in Castiel's hair. The hot, tight
A ragged moan escaped Gabriel, despite his best efforts to stay quiet. He tried to move back against him, but his fiance had him trapped. Nipping at Sam's mouth, Gabriel gripped his shoulders.
"Did he?" Gabriel grinned, seeing Bobby's cheeks heat.
Cas lit up and waved at his boyfriend. At his feet, Scout was doing her business. “Hi, sweetheart!”
"I would love to see that," Cas told Bobby as he also took a bite of his lunch.
"Castiel..." Dean took a deep breath as he watched him, telling himself to man up. "I love you. I'm more sure than I've been about anything in my life."
Sam laughed sleepily. “Do you have a desk here?”
"Sup, Mikey?" She moved to hug Castiel, smoothing his hair. "How are you doing, Clarence?"
“You’re just realizing that?” Sam reached for his tea, his eyes twinkling.
"Stand up and take off your jacket, which you may hang over the back of the chair. Undo your vest and shirt, but leave them on." Gabriel ordered calmly as he toed his shoes off.
"Perfect." Gabriel leaned up to steal a kiss before he headed into the living room.
“No!” Elias wrapped his tiny arms around Castiel’s neck. “My daddy!”
Dean stilled, biting his lip as he looked up at him. "Cas?"
"Well... I'm... it's just the truth." Smiling at him, Dean pulled him into a hug, holding him tight for a long moment. "I need to get back to the shop- I've got the bar tonight, and tomorrow I'm working at the garage."
"Bacon cheeseburgers- it's a request from Sammy after I said Cassie liked burgers when he was younger. Apparently, Dean likes them." Heading to the fridge, he started getting ready to cook.
"I need, I need it harder, please... faster." He clung to him, kissing him deeply.
"What would you love?" He shivered a bit as his lips teased his skin.
Thrilled and eager to please Gabe, Sam flipped him onto his back and settled between his legs.
That didn't stop the man from sweeping her up into his arms as he hurried over. He pressed a kiss to her hair before stealing the bags. "I am just here for the bags."
"Well, get out here and eat, Sammy. You have her in her carrier, and you can eat with your hands-free," Dean told his brother, shaking his head a little. "You haven't even said anything to Emma, Theo, and Ben."
Grinning, Dean pulled his grumpy boyfriend into his arms so that he could steal a kiss. "Good morning, Cas."
He kissed the top of her head. "You're our family, too."
Jack picked up on her unease and he started to fuss.
"Fuck, Sam..." His eyes darkened, and he kissed him again. "That sounds perfect, Baby."
Sam had tears in his own eyes as he snuggled the pup. “Look, Scout. A puppy.”
She snuggled against him, smiling sunnily as he did so, then babbling.
"I am a black belt in Krav Maga and a few other disciplines. I am also a master with most guns." Not that she talked about that much, but... "I can teach you."
"This is true." Dean looked up at Garth. "What do I owe you?"
an explosion on TV.
"That makes me quite happy," he rumbled.
To be fair, he wasn't teasing as much as making sure he felt all right, considering the past.
Sam dropped a kiss on Gabe’s head. “I love her already.”
“Alright.” Cas chuckled softly as he sat down with Jack.
Gabriel smoothed his hands up his thighs, then teased his balls. Fuck he felt amazing- he tasted delicious, and he wanted more.
"I've got some kick-ass bud if you want it," Gabriel told them, unsure if Cas would even want him to offer anything.
"Of course." Gabriel stood, then gave Dean a look as he started to help clean up, which the taller man ignored.
“We have a storm coming in tonight,” she replied absently.
"Hell yeah, my man did!" Dean pulled him into a tight hug, lifting him in the air. "So damn proud of you!"
Well damn. Now Gabriel just had to go and approve of the tall jerk.
Cas rubbed his face. “Call Bobby down so we can eat.”
Cas looked to the window wistfully, and as promised Meg came strolling in.
Dean finished trying on the sneakers, adjusting the laces before he headed up to the register. Seeing the slippers, he raised a brow as he set the empty box on the counter.
"Fuck, honey- that feels so good." Reaching down, Dean gave his cock a slow stroke, using the precome to slick the way. It made him clench a bit on his fiance's thick cock, and he rocked his hips back for more.
Cas grunted softly, relaxing into Gabe’s hug.
"Son of a bitch!" Dean sat up, reaching for his phone. Moments later, Metallica filled the room. He'd yell normally, but it was their wedding day.
A deep groan escaped Sam’s lips as he came, his come painting his chest in thick ropes. “Gabe!”
Nodding, she grinned at him as she gummed at the berry, her two teeth showing
“A little. Need my energy so I can fuck you against your desk,” He responded softly.
The younger man nodded, grabbing a piece of chicken. "Delicious."
The younger man let out a pleased sound and finally began kissing back messily.
Startled, Sam threw his head back and laughed. "And now I find what was always in my mind was in your mind, too. Who knew? Fantasies come true!"
“Okay, baby. I’ll find you when I’m finished?”
“Dean.” Charlie’s voice was small. “We’re at the door.”
"Damn straight I am- I mean, seriously. We're going out for food, and we're not going to eat healthily." She smirked, turning the music up.
Sam closed his eyes and relaxed, patiently holding still. “I don’t let anyone touch my hair.”
"He is having a growth spurt." Gabriel tickled Elias, grinning when he looked up and saw Sam watching.
Cas got his laptop turned on and grinned. “I know you’ll get sick of hearing this, but Meg talked about heart-healthy chips that you can make for me. Can we look into it?”
"I know, my little trouble maker." He wiggled his finger for her. "Daddy's girl."
“I’m right here.” He grabbed Gabe’s hand and squeezed it. “I’m here.”
“You’ll love her so much. And you won’t believe how tiny she is.”
Gabriel just stuck his tongue out at his brother.
XXXXXXXXXXX
"Exactly." Cas followed after Dean, still sleepy and adorably rumpled.
Grabbing the plates, he set them on the table before he sat in his lap. "This all right, love?"
“Well, we won’t start without them. I am so pleased you were able to finish Gabe’s statue in time. He’s going to love it.”
Dean went to grumble at her but his phone buzzed. "Oh! Sammy's here!" He grabbed Gilda's hand with a smirk. "Remember how I told you that he had a present for you? She's here."
! In the drawer- I should be open, please-" He moaned at a wicked move of Sam's
Hugging him back, Dean relaxed in spite of himself. "See you soon, Cas." He hugged him tighter before he headed out of the room, forgetting his clothing from the night before.
Gabriel tilted his hips a bit, then cried out as Sam hit his prostate. "Oh- fuck- yes, Sam!" The pace was driving him wild but he fucking loved it
"Let me know if the fire department can do anything. We love helping charities and people in our community." Dean smoothed Castiel's hair gently as he spoke.
“That’s great,” Charlie answered, squeezing Dean’s arm. “He’s strong.”
Licking his lips, Dean leaned down to kiss him softly. He couldn't help it- that look on Castiel's face... he was beautiful.
Gabriel blinked, fully facing Castiel. "I didn't realize that you were an omega." Where had Jack gotten that idea?
He gave a wicked chuckle, his brown eyes hot. "Because I promise you, it feels fucking amazing, and I want to see how wild I can drive my boy."
“They love you.” He closed his eyes and held Dean closer. “They love you so much.”
"Well, technically they're an aggregate fruit. Cucumbers are berries, though, as are watermelons and bananas," Gabriel told him helpfully.
Knowing it would be quicker to let him help than argue, Charlie worked with him to get the babies settled in their bassinets. Once they were both sleeping, Charlie hugged dean again. “Go.”
"Fuck, Sam, that's..." Gabriel bit his lower lip, letting his hips rock to fuck his fist. Most days, he'd have slicked his fingers and fucked himself on them, but he'd just sucked Sam off- still had his taste on his tongue, and he was
“I know.” He let out a deep breath, relaxing as his headache slowly eased.
Sam bounced Zep on his knee. “Hi, Eli!”
“I do.” Sam reached for his fork to try a crepe.
"But why?" The boy reached for his juice, sulking a little.
“No, but I did have to bribe him. He wants a new sketchbook. And that gave me an idea”.
Castiel’s heart melted as he also looked at Sam. “He’s always so relaxed with you, Gabe.”
At poets, pastry—cooks and kings, at folk sublime and small,
Cas wasn't thrilled but he returned Dean's embrace. "Will you promise to text me if you need anything?"
"After class ends he can just... move on with his life. I'll be that weird professor, and that's... that's the way it should be." Fuck knew Kali would agree. He'd been damn near useless, he'd been told as much, and he couldn't blame her.
Breathing in Gabriel’s scent, Sam smiled against his skin. “I’d like to try it for a while. But I also just want to hold you.”
"Nope. He just asked that I add pepperoni to the sauce." Moving to check dinner, Gabriel messed up Jack's hair
Zachariah snagged Sam’s check from Ruby’s hand. “I’m gonna need you to fill in tonight for James.”
Snorting softly, Dean shook his head. "Sammy, he underestimates the way I can eat pie."  He grinned, excitedly serving up pie for each of them. "Here, Cas- you can have some pie, right? Just a little?"
"You know, sweetheart, I can't nurse you as nice as my chest is. Daddy's working on your bottle, and it'll be ready soon." Gabriel smiled down at her, smoothing her hair.
Spotting Sam, Remy started to bark, racing over to the tall man for the guaranteed belly rub.
Gabriel swore at a crack of lightning. "Shit, I'm glad that our girl's at home." The storm had been darkening the horizon all day- and then it was suddenly there. Just utterly pouring. The doctor slowed down as the back roads started to get muddy. "Fuck."
“That’s wonderful. I’ve always wanted a tattoo but I never found one that meant enough to me.”
"How are you feeling, Cassie? Is there anything that you want to change about your care?" The doctor finally managed to ask after a moment. "I will be glad to answer any questions that I can. I am an excellent phone a friend."
Ash shook his hand, using it to pull him into a hug. "Welcome to the family, man. Sit down, I will load you up with beer and burgers."
"We should." Gabriel straightened his tie, then headed towards the door. He was marrying Sam, and nothing was going to stop him.
Dean spotted them, hurrying over. "Just a headache? We'll see what the MRI says."
“As long as you’re sure.” Cas tentatively gave Dean’s cock a squeeze.
Licking at his face, the dog sat in him, a big furry ball of excitement. Not to be outdone, the other two dogs raced over as well.
“All for you,” Sam breathed, loving how infatuated Gabe looked.
“Hey. You’ll be with me again soon, right?” Sam wanted to kiss his man so badly. “It’s going to be okay.”
"I'll pay for it. I mean, if that's a nice way of saying that it's too soon to meet, fine, but I have no problem doing that." The vet bit his lower lip, pacing the kitchen a bit.
"Well, he's safe now. He's safe and with his family."
“This trip is for you, Dean. I have more clothes than I know what to do with.”
“Is Jack settled in?” Cas asked, his voice raspy.
"I just shared the god of all desserts with you, pie," Dean told him with a grin. "But yeah, you're legal. We'll go out for a drink."
"Take your time. He was restless last night." Dean told him quietly.
He took a long breath, trying to gather himself together again.
Sam nuzzled Gabe’s hand. “You’re so tense, baby. What was the nightmare about?”
Gabriel ran his hand through Sam's hair, his eyes hot. "That look... right there is so fucking hot…"
“Allow me to fix that.” Sam reached between their bodies and tugged at Gabe’s silk boxers.
“They have your back every day. I want to know all of them.” Castiel kissed his cheek before finishing his breakfast.
Cas melted into the hug and closed his eyes. “I’m lucky to have you.”
Dean's mouth went dry with anticipation before he licked his lips. "I, yes, Sir. I understand. I'm yours."
He gasped as Lucifer’s fingers tightened around his throat. “Please!”
“Of course I would claim you. And I am possessive… in healthy ways.”
"Of course, Honey. We just have to talk to security after the hospital, okay?" Dean kissed his hair.
"We'll go any place you want." Pressing a kiss to Castiel's cheek, Dean couldn't stop himself from slipping his hand into the younger man's.
Cas let out a soft whine and slumped against his pillows. “Oh...”
Dean grinned, pausing in cutting up his food. "Can I?"
Cas’s cheeks flushed again. “Dean says… I’m handsome...”
"So we have to soak the fries in water to start with," Dean told him, making easy work of chopping the fries.
"I see just fine," Gabriel turned towards Sam, slowly looking up his body before shooting him a wink.
Sam watched him adoringly. “We should have a big cookout this weekend.”
Sam was too fucking perfect- and he was all his. Gabriel moaned, his own nails digging into Sam's shoulder as he tried to move faster against the younger man.
Cas nodded eagerly and moved the pie a safe distance away. “It’s been a long time since I’ve done this… willingly.”
"Of course I would. Communication solves a lot of things." Dean nuzzled along his jaw.
And Dean was definitely curious as to what his man wanted.
“Not as amazing as you.” Sam brushed Gabe’s hair away from his forehead. “Why didn’t anyone tell me we were having a family meeting?”
“Okay...it’s been years since someone...”
Ignoring the protest, Sam crooked his long finger, brushing firmly against Gabe’s prostate.
“That works.” Sam pulled off the highway and into the diner parking lot.
"Er... yeah. I make all sorts of flowers." Dean slipped his arm around Castiel, grinning.
"That is precious," Cas murmured.
It was going to be a lovely night.
"You're not meant to be here yet, Castiel." His wife shook her head fondly, moving to slip her arms around him. "My love... You've been blaming yourself for far too much."
"Mm-hmm..."
"Please? I... it'd make me feel better." Honestly, he wasn't sure if it was Cas not handling him being gone so much as he wasn't handling being away from his brother.
“I will.” Sam suddenly felt devastatingly exhausted. “I wish I could hold you.”
“Of course we can.” He playfully grabbed Gabe’s ass before setting him down. Then he grabbed Gabe’s bags and slung them over his shoulder. “Cas and Dean were cooking something delicious when I left.”
"She definitely is." Emma stepped up next to him, worried, but Jack just reached up to pet her.
Sam finally sat down and grabbed a bite of his own food. "Mm…"
He sheepishly smiled at his mom. “Look, mama! I found Dean and Remy!”
“This is going to be a constant point of contention,” Sam teased his husband.
Cas twisted around and buried his face in Dean’s neck. His heart was pounding in his chest and he felt sick.
“Please what, baby?”
Gabriel smiled, "You're so good for me, Samshine. So gorgeous. You make me happier than I ever thought that I could be."
The kiss turned more heated and Sam slipped his hand under Gabe’s shirt.
He reluctantly followed, his heart torn. How many times had he wished for this very moment, to see his little girl again? To hold her? To kiss Amelia?
“But Gabe...”
John's hand flashed out, hitting Castiel in the side as Dean's fist connected with his father's jaw, knocking him back and to the ground, still. "Son of a bitch!"
Slipping his legs around Sam's waist, Gabriel kissed him back. "Mm... I can't wait until I can convince you to move."
Dean moved, hugging his moose of a younger brother tightly. "Good. I might fly out if I can get some time off to see you..."
“He’s in a great mood tonight so he’s celebrating.”
"An hour isn't soon enough!" Don swore, looking at his watch.  Forty-five minutes had passed, and he was screwed if he didn't show up. "I want it in a suitcase, unmarked bills. You know what we agreed on." He didn't want to get stuck with the squalling brats, he wanted the damn money.
"I'm not brave, Samshine. I'm just stubborn." He stroked his fingers through Sam's hair, kissing his temple. "I know how hard you've been working. You're almost there."
Gabriel closed his eyes, relaxing into the embrace, feeling strangely at home in his arms. Almost like he didn't have to be the one in control as much with everything.
“I actually wanted to surprise you, sweetheart.”
Sighing, Gabriel thought for a moment. He felt like there was no good answer. "Sam's bringing him back, Cassie. You just have to figure out how to apologize."
Cas nodded eagerly and let Dean help him upstairs, while Sam and Gabe playfully squabbled over the bags.
A big, gummy smile illuminated Cas's features. "I feel the same about you, Dean." He gave Dean another little kiss. "Come on. I want to get our new babies home."
“Kay...”
"And you're not?" He padded into the room, moving over to his side. "And Sam had a nightmare that woke Gabriel who ran to him, so I just get Gabriel back to his room- and he's fine, so no worries."
"It's just... so breathtaking," he finally managed. "I'm lacking the right words to express…"
"I did too. When I told you that I loved you." Yes, he'd implied that it wouldn't be
let me see your side."
"Fair point!" Gabriel grinned! Then headed down to the Uber he'd ordered earlier. Thankfully! It didn't take them long to get to the jeweler's.
"It'll be all right." Dean patted his back, then rubbing along his shoulder.
Gathering the viscous liquid on his palm, Dean wrapped his hand around Castiel's cock and stroked, watching his reaction before he moved to lick at the head of his cock.
Cas nodded and carefully scooted out from under Sam. He gave Dean a little kiss and stood up, padding after his big brother.
“I have faith we will.” He embraced Dean for a moment. “But today is for Sam and Gabe.”
Gabriel let Sam arrange him in his lap, then snuggled against his chest as the male orderly searched the rubble for Doctor Sexy.
"Shit- sorry." He rolled away, then swore as he fell out of the bed. "...Ow."
Dean stopped and Garth pulled him into a brief but tight hug. “I’ll go double-check the windows and doors.”
Sam squeezed his boyfriend again, nuzzling his neck. "Come on, sweetheart. I saw some ice cream with our names on it."
"What's your color, love?" Dean gently stroked his hands over Castiel's thighs. He was tempted to mouth his cock, but not yet.
“I can’t do this, Gabe.” The younger man was bordering on panic. “I can’t.”
Two cases caught Sam’s eyes and he picked them both up. One was an otter box and the other was a Life Proof. “One of these. Just have to decide which.”
“I don’t need the world. Just you.”
Dean bit his lower lip as he heard the beeps and stuff from the different monitors as they were attached. His poor love...
He grinned and sipped his water. "Can we go eat at Balty's soon?"
Michael narrowed his eyes at Dean. "I will be expecting my money back by Monday," he snapped, walking away from the group.
“I’m almost done.” Castiel had nearly cleared his plate, to everyone’s relief. “This was delicious, Gabe. And my stomach is fine. No nausea.”
She rolled her eyes at him a bit. He was so gone on Clarence. “You know I don’t mind. We just had lunch and now that you’re back, I have a date to get ready for.”
Nervous, Sam retrieved the lube and came back to Gabe. “I’ve only ever touched my cock,” he explained hesitantly.
When they arrived at the mall, Dean parked Baby and helped Cas out of the car. Cas regarded the mall in curiosity. “It’s been so long...”
“Shh...” Sam shakily cleaned them both up. “You make me so happy...”
"Exactly. I don't like it either." Gabriel pet the dogs only to raise a brow as he saw his nephew at the table. "What are you up to, Jack?"
"Mmm...." Gabriel had to be slightly less enthusiastic than he normally would be, but it didn't matter. He licked the precome from Sam's tip, jerking him with his hand.
Jody followed Donna inside. “Sounds good. But first thing is first. I want to see if she has been micro-chipped and if she has an owner.”
Dean shrugged a little, sitting by Sam's side. "We did. You need to take care of yourself so that can be here when Sam really wakes up."
"Are the cops coming? Is he conscious?" Fuck, did he mean gone as in dead, or gone as in physically? Dean felt sick, and he wanted to reach over and touch Cas, but he needed both hands on the wheel.
“It was the least I could do.” Cas welcomed Remy with open arms. “Hi, Rem.”
“I’ll see you soon, angel.” Sam’s voice broke a little, and he swallowed hard.
"Wait." Cas set his roses aside gently before crawling into Dean's lap. "Better."
“Of course.” Crowley excused himself and left the studio.
"We'll be back in a couple of hours. When do you think dinner will be ready?"
Tilting his head, Gabriel winced, then sighed. He was too damn stiff. But Dean was taking care of Cas, making sure he got some dessert.
Dean looked up, grinning at his brother. "Sounds good. What're you making? Need help?" Alright, it was a big brother thing. He couldn't help it.
Cas managed to stop laughing at Dean long enough to say, “Gabe, no pictures!”
He hadn't said anything to Castiel yet, as Dean was normally around, and he'd wanted Castiel not to have to feel pressured.
"Of course, Cas. Honestly... I don't want a puppy. I want a dog- there are lots of people who will adopt the younger ones." He greeted the man at the desk, who beamed at them, asking them to go down the hall with the dogs.
He smiled softly and wrote a check for $500,000 to the shelter. "This place does great work. I just want to help."
"Well, we're here, Sammy. We've got you." Poor bastards couldn't catch a break. Dean rubbed his back, "how about we watch a movie after dinner? Big cuddle pile?" He knew Castiel would understand.
The younger man let out a watery chuckle and tried to dry his eyes. "Sap."
"Oh. I thought you knew that." Blinking, Gabriel shrugged a bit. Charlie must have texted him. "Oops?"
Cas chuckled, rubbing Dean’s wet back. “I still like you.”
“No problem.” She looked at him cautiously. “What about you? Is there a chance you have a pup, too?”
Gabriel looked up at Sam, trying to steal a kiss. "I want that, Sam, I want your cock inside of me..."
"God, I love you, Cas," Dean breathed, pressing their foreheads together. Six months felt like hell, waiting for heaven, for this moment.
Cas held him as his orgasm rocked his body. “Good boy, Dean. So good for me.”
"Here, Sammy. Take a baby, okay? You haven't gotten to hold Jack much." Dean told him, grinning at his brother. "See, Gabriel's all right."
“Thank you, baby.” He gave Gabe a kiss before digging in.
"Dean, get washed up, Gabriel glove him up," Garth ordered as nurses moved around the room with various instruments. "We're going to get you into the stirrups while he's getting ready, okay?"
That tone, that look! Dean bit his lower lip, then nodded, carefully doing as Castiel ordered. "Like this... Sir?"
As the door closed, Cas finished his breakfast. “I’m all yours, Dean. What should we do first? Sex or a nap?”
“Good...” Cas held Dean in his arms, smiling tenderly.
"Text Dean you're going to bed, or I can, Cas." Gabriel moved, setting up a little box in Castiel's bathroom as Sam brought in the kitten. The little ball of fluff jumped from his arms onto the bed.
Castiel watched him with adoring eyes. “I don’t deserve you.”
He closed his eyes tightly. “Please… I want forever… if you want me.”
"I was going to come to get you lunch." Dean headed to the sink to wash his hands.
Cas glared at his brother.
"It is?"
Wrapping his hand around Sam's cock, Gabriel gave it a slow stroke. "Fuck- Sam, that's..." He groaned at the feeling of him pulling his hair. His plans were rapidly starting to fall away.
His stunning blue eyes filled with adoration and he gave Dean’s hand a squeeze.
Sam sat up carefully and gladly took the juice. As Gabe sat down beside him again, he sipped at the fresh orange juice. "So good…"
“Yeah… of course. Do I need to wake him up or anything?”
Sam gladly took his daughter and laid her against his chest. “I know, baby. Daddy expects us to be chipper and it’s just too late in the day, huh?”
"It's been a while since Cassie trimmed it." Turning his head, he kissed the soft inner part of Sam's wrist.
Cas wanted to sob in pleasure at the mere thought. “I need it...”
“Shh... you’ll be fine either way.”
Gabriel paused, then grinned. "Do you know how sexy you are? We'll do that, and we'll get out a couple of thousand to do as well- just to give out as cash." Hell, maybe they could buy the whole trees worth of kids who needed help.
"Monkey!"
“Dean? I stopped to grab a change of my clothes...” Cas laughed when Remy ran to greet him. “Hi again, Rem.”
The nurse came back with ice chips and she told Dean, “This afternoon, we’re going to get Sam up and moving around a bit.”
"Well, you can get a new computer, at least, considering... I mean, I know that computer is just..." A POS that Sam'd been struggling with for years.
"No shit?" Gabriel's lips curled into a mischievous smile. "Of course, she will have to go to dinner with us."
“Yes. She interrupted my very first kiss.”
"You gonna ride with me on a four-wheeler or do you want to take some of the horses?" Dean smiled, unable to do anything else when faced with that smile.
Gabriel sipped his chocolate milk, eyeing his brother. He'd wanted to put on coffee, but Sam'd given him a look. "How's it feel, Cassie?"
“It’s the truth.”
"Sam, I can't..." Gabriel sighed, then looked at his brother. "Can you turn off the meat for right now? I'm going to get him upstairs to sleep some more. His version of 'fine' and mine are apparently vastly different."
“As much as I would like that, shouldn’t we be thinking about dinner?”
"We don't have to if you don't want to, Samshine." Gabriel moved, grabbing a package from his nightstand, then handing the plug to Sam. "This is what I'm talking about."
“Gabe, I’m fine,” Cas interrupted tersely. “I’m with Dean. We went shopping.”
"Did I ask for it harder?" He raised a brow, sitting up on the desk more.
“I see.” Cas turned and ran his fingers through Dean’s hair.
After their little snack, Cas felt re-energized, so he headed out to the Highlander and began bringing Emma’s bags in. He couldn’t wait to fix up her room so she would feel more at home. His goal was to create a safe haven, a sanctuary where his daughter could feel completely safe and protected.
Gabriel smirked a little as he thought of Dean's reaction. "If Cassie is trying to impress Dean, he might just kill me if I do."
Gabriel sipped his wine before offering the glass to Sam. "I happen to love it. Normally, I tease myself for as long as I can hold off, fingering myself before I finally touch my cock."
"Just... for anything. I want you to have anything you want."
Slowly, almost uncertainly, Cas brought his hand up and rested it on Dean’s head.
Cas didn’t argue with Dean. He took the ibuprofen and let Dean shift him very gently onto his side.
Somehow Sam managed to hold Gabe as they rode the waves of their pleasure. “Gabe...”
Doing as he was ordered, he bit his lower lip, his cock springing free of the panties that he'd put on this morning as he obeyed. Cas had seen them a few times, but these were a new pair, and he hadn't exactly been wearing them with the intent to show them to him.
The machine beeped, and the woman cleared her throat. "Sir, I'm sorry, but there seems to be a problem with your card..."
"There's a place called Opus that's pretty good- or do you have a recommendation?" Dean would have suggested his apartment but didn't want to give him any weird ideas that he was pushing him.
Gabriel looked to Sam, stepping back from the cake. "What's wrong, Samshine? You're quiet." He had been all morning.
"He'll get over it when Castiel pounces him. You know he will." Taking a sip of his drink, Gabriel laughed a little at the thought.
"I can see her and Zeppy having some issues with that when they're older because Zep's not a princess either," Dean told them, thinking of the two growing up together.
Grinning, Dean watched as Elias kept on playing, ignoring the fact that he was being cleaned up. The rubber ducky, after all, was the most important. He snickered. "So that's the purpose of a rubber duck, huh?"
“I can’t lose Dean again...”
"Then these are what we're getting." He told him firmly, handing him the books before he turned to peruse the other Harry Potter paraphernalia.
“I have to see him,” Gabe rasped, his eyes searching Crowley's tired features.
"Can't nap long," Cas mumbled, his eyes already closing. "Still have to cook dinner."
“Dean! Dean, calm down right now.” Cas’s voice was firm and commanding.
“Gonna fuck you so good, Gabe!” Sam grunted as his balls slapped against Gabe’s ass.
Dean watched her head up the stairs. Shaking his head. "We need to spoil her."
Gabriel laid his hand over Sam's, giving it a gentle squeeze. "I care about you-thank you for accepting her." He was going to remember the happiness on the younger man' face forever. He was so gorgeous, the way his hair framed his face and the shine in his
Rem wagged happily, snuggling against his second favorite person.
Elias pointed at the tub, squirming happily.
Gabe’s hands were suddenly full of a bloody, squirming pup. A few moments later, tiny cries filled the room.
“Great!”
"That's it." Hugging him close against his chest, Dean softly started to hum.
“Sounds like it. Are you hungry?”
“Emma.” Cas opened the baby food and held Ben upright. “You did what you could, sweetheart. No one is angry with you. In fact, I think you are amazing for protecting your brothers.”
Cas pulled out a bottle of wine and two glasses. “I thought a little wine would be nice.”
He had to smile at the look on Castiel's face, brushing his lips over his jaw. "Was it?"
He shook his head. “N-no. I want a kiss.”
"I've got that," Dorothy reassured them, going to grab the mop.
Climbing off of Sam's lap, Gabriel grabbed the lube and his shirt. He winked at his fiance, then padded towards the bedroom.
“It’s supposed to be exquisite.” The car stopped and Gabe paid the driver before they grabbed their bags and walked into the hotel.
Cas looked at Rosie. “Hey, that’s a good girl!” he praised.
“Like that! Just like that!” He was so close to coming and he couldn’t believe it. “Harder!”
“Oh!” Sam tossed his head back and thrust his hips.
Sam sat down on a mattress and gave a little bounce. “I was just telling my boyfriend that I don’t have much style. I’m more concerned with comfort.”
“We’re going home. Get in the SUV,” Sam said lowly.
"What's that, loveling?" Cupping Sam's face, Gabriel tilted his face up so that he could press a soft kiss to his lips.
"Doc, you're pushing it." He frowned only for Remy to give a snort against his palm before licking him. "...Fine." he'd do anything for his dog, even if he didn't like it.
"I really wish I'd met Adam. He sounds like he was amazing... and he gets to live on through them." She hugged him, rubbing Sam's back slowly.
"You can talk to me about that, any time Cas... but you don't need to unless you want to." Dean stroked his fingers over Castiel's chest. "And I may see a few scars, but I also see that my running Professor is pretty damn fit... and your hip bones are lickable. If you were worried about me finding you attractive. I've noticed that you don't want me to see your chest, or you don't seem to... and then.…"
Stunned, it took Cas a moment to process what Gabe had just done. But then he snatched up a pillow and whacked Gabe upside the head with it.
Charlie shrugged, biting her lower lip. "Sam, Cali's nice, it is, but... it's not home. I haven't felt like I had a home since I lost Mom." She sighed, shrugging. "I'd planned on following you anyway."
"Just ignore her, Cassie. The nurses are a little... protective of me, that's all." Well, he had worked with them for years, and they were a family.
Cas walked up behind Dean and lightly grasped his hip. “I love that you love her.”
"Cas and Dean are going to love the little gown. Thanks, Samshine." Gabriel leaned over to kiss his jaw.
protective of him.”
“He’s very fond of you, so I’m certain he will. I’ll make sure to compensate him generously.”
Nodding, Dean pressed his face into his shoulder for a moment, taking a deep breath. "That'll be perfect. This... thank you, Bobby. Seriously." He stepped back, trying to discretely wipe at his cheeks before he cleared his throat. "We should do more presents."
"Yes, Sir." Cuddling his mate, Gabriel closed his eyes.
“You’re welcome.” He reluctantly released her. “Go use the bathroom. I’ll straighten up your bed.”
If Dean could have purred, he definitely would. Athena was flopped in by Jack, so at least they had room on the bed for once. He made a pleased sound, feeling Castiel against him. "We could cuddle in here for an hour or so..."
Dean barely remembered the next few hours. It was taking forever, for Cas to go through the MRI and the doctors to examine him- and there were a lot of them. He was finally being brought back into the room.
"Works for me." Gabriel moved, handing Sam the controller in a move that showed off the wings on his back and arms. "Here you go, Samshine."
Now Cas was excited as he took in their surroundings. “We’re getting our dog!”
"Oh." The thought of her all alone in the NICU damn near broke Dean's heart, and he cleared his throat. "Poor kiddo…"
“I know...” He sniffled and buried his face in Gabe’s hair.
Cas noticed that Dean let him set the pace, and soon they were walking alongside the river. Athena happily trotted beside Castiel, her tail wagging.
Confident he had Dean’s attention, Cas rose from the bed and cupped Dean’s cheek in his hand. “Everything is okay.”
"Yeah. Love when you-" He gasped again and wrapped his legs around Gabe's waist. "Love when you fuck me."
This seemed to reassure Castiel and Sam, at least for the time being.
As Sam talked, Cas took a long drag from Gabe’s joint. Then he passed it back to Gabe and relaxed into the couch as the group of men spoke.
"Damn straight." Nodding, Gabriel looked up at Sam. "Besides, it's my honor to protect you," He proclaimed dramatically, only for Dean to peg him with the napkin.
“I should have been with you...” Fuck, if he’d been there, he could have saved him…
"Eh, I want our traditions. Not other people's. I'm not leaving you either way, but I was serious when I gave you that." He pressed a kiss to the ring on Castiel's finger.
Dean innocently stole Castiel's orange juice, taking a sip.
"Now they normally call each other a Bitch- well, Sam's the bitch- he's got a great bitch face-" Charlie explained, then pointed to Dean, "And Dean gets called a jerk by Sam."
"You know that you can, Cas." Dean reached down, running a hand through his hair. Fuck, that little hopeful look there, the desire...
“Yep.” They talked for a little longer before Dean had to go, and when the call ended Sam felt a little twist of sadness. He almost wished he hadn’t gone so far for school, but he and Dean knew it was best for him. It didn’t stop him from missing his brother. And Adam...
"I'm a bit of a tease, yes," Gabriel told him, picking up his fork. "I'm not cruel about it, though. Please, eat. The desserts are delicious."
"Ignore him, Cas. We're-"
"Did you guys finally have sex, then?" Gabriel raised a brow, grinning as he dug into his food.
Gabriel laughed, pointing to the screen. "See? It looks like a turtle, nearly."
“Yes.” Cas draped the jacket over his arm.
“You’re the brat.”
Dean bit his lower lip, watching him. "I never stopped. Not for a moment, Cas... neither did Gabriel."
“But it’s hot,” Sam breathed, his eyes darkening.
“I do since I register them. These babies will grow to be champions, but right now they just want snacks.”
Sam raised his head a bit. “I want to walk to you,” he replied certainly, feeling a little breathless.
“Hi, baby. We made it to the hotel.” Sam pulled the phone back to show his naked body. “Got my own room.”
He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. “Are you any good at repairing vehicles?”
“I wish, kiddo, but I’m not sure bacon on the day I get home would be a great idea.” Gabriel sighed, shaking his head. He felt terrible about his brother’s dietary restrictions.
"Shh... what do you have to be sorry for? You're the one who was hurt." Dean cupped Castiel's face, then stroked his thumb below the older man's eye. "I've got you."
“I’m here. I’m right here.” Fuck, he had caused all of this. He cupped Gabe’s cheek in his hand. “I’m not leaving you.”
Gabriel checked the time, then sent a text to his boyfriend, asking him to call when he got a chance.
"Nice slippers, Cas." Dean grinned as he watched him. "Mine got eaten by Goof, the station American bulldog. He's Rufus's." Really Dean?
“Because I woke up and saw this...” his hand slipped between their bodies and gently cupped Dean’s erection through his bottoms.
"You're gonna make me the most popular bastard there." Dean pulled him close, kissing him.
“He is in surgery. I have the best surgeons working on him,” Crowley quietly assured. “Sam-“
“There are wipes... in the nightstand,” the older man managed.
Cas pulled Dean close. "We," he corrected firmly. "We have the coolest niece or nephew."
Stroking his fingers through the older man's hair, Dean made a soft, pleased noise. "Cas, did you hear what she said? We had to pretend that I was your husband."
"I like this. You taking pictures of me." Gabriel stroked his cock, making a soft noise even as the material muted the caress.
Sam groaned again as he struggled to sit up. “Good idea.”
"Shh..." Dean slowly started to pull his fingers away. Hell, even he knew that was cat for no.
"Yeah." Gabriel snorted softly, standing to pace around the room a bit. "Cas, he's a student. He's how much younger than me? I hold power over him and his education. It's not appropriate- I'm not even going to go into what the hell it says about me psych wise that I'd..." He sighed, pacing back over to his brother.
Sam settled one of the babies into the isolette. “He’d want you with her.”
"Yeah, it does," he agreed contently.
"We can hire someone to come here, groom them, give them a look over..." So Dean could pay off any owner.
"And I've always been fascinated by sign language, so I sought out ways to study and learn it," Cas finished, squeezing Dean's hand.
"What?" Castiel hadn't answered his first question, and Dean frowned in confusion. "Cas, that doesn't make sense. I don't..."
Jack and James, after a bottle and diaper change each, were quiet and settled for their first flight. The dogs, at least, had settled once they were in the air.
“I do.” Sam’s voice was low and husky, and fuck he wanted to come again.
Gabriel grabbed at Sam's shoulders, nipping at his throat. "That's so fucking hot, Samshine."
Dean patted Sam's back gently. "You go ahead first, Sammy."
Sam caught Gabe by the arm and pulled him close. “Before we do anything... I need to tell you that Jessica was the only person I ever...”
"Hey, it's not my heart, Sammy. It's his." Dean told him, trying to get his open. Damn, Bobby'd used a ton of tape.
Gabriel stroked his hair gently,  feeling it start to dry under his fingers. "Of course not- and I won't tell Cas, either. That's for Dean to do."
"I can't, big guy. But you guys have my number. You can text me any time and I'll answer."
Sam smiled and gave Emma a little wave. “She was born yesterday. She’s brand new.”
She wagged her tail as she relaxed more, nudging Sam's hands for more pets.
Sam happily followed Gabe to their bed and climbed in with him. Then he gathered his man into his arms and wrapped himself around him.
Gabriel reached out, rubbing Castiel's back. "I am sure that they will."
"Shh, baby. I have all the time in the world to convince you, hm?" He kissed him, stroking Sam's hair.
"Absolutely." Cas dug into his second piece of chicken enthusiastically.
"Pair that with dessert and it sounds perfect." He placed the call, ordering the same for them both, then dessert as well.
“It’s a wonderful surprise. And I love the idea of touching myself to the memories we’ll make.”
"Well... he was hungry." Standing, Dean moved to get more coffee and food for his mate.
“I know you do.” He rubbed Dean’s back soothingly.
Biting his lip, Sam closed his eyes and tried to distract himself. He didn’t want to come in under a minute while Gabe was giving him his first blowjob.
"No? But I am betting that it has led to her current attitude." Slipping into the shower, Dean moaned at the hot water.
"Good." Gabriel moved, getting out what he needed for the cocoa.
Dean hugged him close, then paused. "Cas... you really don't mind me kissing and hugging you? I... I know something awful must have happened..."
Sam started to lean down as Cas came out of Dean’s room.
"Sammich!" Bouncing into the room, Gabriel moved to steal a kiss. "I want you to show me Palo Alto."
"... So we have a kitten, too." Nodding, Dean looked at Castiel. "Are you okay with that?"
Looking at him, Gabriel broke and pulled his younger brother into a tight hug. He couldn't help it.
“Whatever you’re comfortable with. It’s your bed.” Sam slipped under the sheets.
Sam blew out a heavy breath. “Can I have a shot first?”
Jack’s eyes lit up. “What is it?”
"I'm really happy for you-  and for Dean." Charlie fanned herself, laughing. "Let me tell you, I walked in on him and Cas- the first time ruining their first kiss- so this time, when I saw Dean holding Cas against the wall and kissing the hell out of him, I turned around."
Fuck. Gabriel swallowed hard, wanting to run his hands up the other man's legs, tease them both... He did his best not to fidget, though his cock twitched.
“Just grabbing dinner with Charlie. Why?” What the hell? Dean sounded weird.
Cas tried not to look too guilty. “A couple. I’m sorry if I overstepped.”
“But was it okay? I was worried I might have been too...” Too forceful. Prior to Dean, he’d never thought about such things. With him, though, the thoughts just flowed.
“Me too.” Sam kept his eyes on the road, but he grabbed Gabe’s hand. “I want you to rest. I’m going to take care of you.”
Cas squirmed and swatted at Dean’s hand. “I like tomatoes, pickles, ketchup, mustard...”
Dean pressed a kiss to Castiel's hair. "Ready to see what Rowena brought me to wear? She picks my outfits for the shoots."
"Well, since my husband is so sure..." Gabriel kissed him again. "I want to get out of here."
"Me too... Gabe chased me away when I tried to check on them." Dean pouted a little, stroking his hands over Castiel.
He managed another squeeze, this one a little stronger.
A rumble stirred in Gabriel's chest, and the alpha nipped at Sam's mouth. "It is a promise, provided our pup behaves…"
“My brother isn’t one to cheat. Ever. He has his flaws; everyone does. But he’s a good man.”
“Of course.” Sam snuck a little kiss from Gabe. “Right now, let’s relax. I want Cas to rest.”
Gabriel winked at him, pulling a joint from behind his ear before he lit it. "You know, Cassie... I'm glad you have Dean-o."
Dean kissed him, pulling Castiel's body against his own. "Love you so much..."
“Neither have I,” Sam added.
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us
“I know. I’m just thinking,” he replied honestly.
"Cas?" Dean nearly pouted, immediately missing the sensation and he looked at him over his shoulder.
His sweet Anna... he had to be there for her. Slowly his foot shuffled forward. One step, two...
Dean's eyes widened a bit. He'd hoped a bit that he'd find a ranch hand job just because of the housing. He'd not expected this. "I can easily do a lot more than that, Sir."
Gabriel found the lube and a small vibrator. "Who is topping, gorgeous? I would love either..."
Gabriel paced around the kitchen, checking on dinner for a moment before he stepped back- right into Sam. He let out a small shout.
“Emma has the magic touch. Apparently, she was holding in a really good burp.”
Hm. He'd never seen that smile on Castiel's face before, soft and content. Gabriel vowed to make sure that it showed more often. "Thanks, Dean."
Elias shrieked and giggled while Cas watched them adoringly. "I can't believe it. It's like...I just needed you."
He bit his lower lip, considering as he watched the other man. He'd never been good at talking about emotions, but the last thing he wanted to do was upset Castiel by seeming like he was ignoring his earlier conversation about seeming like a good boyfriend. Still, Denial wasn't just a river in Egypt. "Maybe we can do a salad too? Potatoes are veggies, but even with ketchup, they're not all that healthy."
“Don’t tell Charlie that. She’d likely punch you.”
"Of course, Cas. I was thinking we could walk by the river a bit?" He suggested, giving Castiel a gentle squeeze.
Slipping the pants on, Gabriel's lips quirked up. "Well, I'll make her a dessert so delicious she won't even care."
"That is too damn adorable. We should print that off for them." Dean told him, plotting a frame that he could make for the picture.
"I thought that we were already doing a reward?"Dean frowned a little, sipping his cocoa.
"That won't be hard for him," Dean laughed, starting again.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Dr. Novak. I’m Amelia Sheppard.” She shook his hand firmly. “We want to get Sam up and down the hall at least once this morning.”
“It… I was back there...”
Nodding a little, Cas touched the picture.
“And you’re a dirty liar.” She playfully thumped his chest, then turned around. “Well? Introduce me to these gorgeous men here!”
Cas nodded against Dean’s chest, and his stomach rumbled loudly.
"You know what? We're going to watch Firefly. It's brilliant, and I bet that you will enjoy it." Sipping his whiskey, Dean made a soft sound. "Damn, that's good."
He smiled shyly. “A first kiss?”
Sam leaned into his man, chuckling. “De?”
He parked the car, heading inside. The first thing he wanted was a kiss from Cas, then food.
"Emmie! Emmie! I gotta pee!" Theo told her, racing for the potty.
Sam nodded intently. “I know.” He carefully shifted until he was straddling Gabe’s hips again.
Moaning into Castiel's mouth, Dean pushed his hands down, cupping his ass and pulling him closer. "Fuck, Cas... you feel so good."
Cas made the table while Gabe cooked.
Everyone cracked up at that, including Sam. “Hey, this is my professor,” he teased his brother, slinging his arm around Gabe’s shoulders. “Get your own!”
Flipping on the music, Gabriel hummed to himself as he started to make his brother's sandwich up. He was determined to make it the best possible food since Cassie'd had a limited diet before.
Fuck. He lifted his hips, letting him pull them down and off.
"Good. I want your hands on me." Pulling at Sam's shirt, the shorter man tried to strip it off before giving up and stripping off the rest of his own clothing instead.
Cas immediately rushed back to Jack. “Jack? What’s wrong?”
Watching him for a moment, Dean shook his head with a smile. "All right, all right. You can have the shower first. Make sure you add cold water to it, or it'll scald you- towels are there under the sink." He should get his ass to work in the work shop anyway, and get to work on that statue. He only had so many weeks until Christmas.
“I do. I love how your body reacts to me.”
Sam eagerly helped his man make the table. “I can’t believe I get an extra week here.”
"Of course I do. Didn't I warn you about that before?" Dean teased him, running his fingers through the older man's hair. "I'm a bit selfish. I like knowing that you're mine."
Sam waited patiently, moving to his California king size bed that seemed even bigger without Gabriel.
Nodding, Cas leaned over and took the proffered bite. “Mm!”
Relaxing, Sam held him close and looked at his ring for a long moment as he held Gabriel. Damn, Gabriel really had found the perfect ring! He really had needed his help! “I’d like yours to match mine.”
Their eyes locked and Cas squirmed at the intrusion. “Good...”
Gabriel Novak always took his work home with him, it seemed.
Damn. Dean felt his chest tighten in emotion, then rubbed at it, before looking at his kids. "Okay, Sammy,  Gabe- I get it. Next time I need to be told off, I'll ask." He winked at them, then moved to burp Alex.
He gave it another minute before his body felt relaxed enough for him to move. Slowly he began to lift
“I can stay. What would make you feel better?”
"I promise, Samshine." Rinsing off his hand, Gabriel grinned at him. "So, gorgeous..."
"I love you too, Samshine." Kissing his mate's neck, Gabriel yelped when his daughter pulled at his IV. "Zeppy, Daddy needs that. We're using that to get Daddy some fluids."
"No one touches me but you." Dean turned, stealing a kiss from Castiel.
Biting her lip, Charlie took a shaky breath then replied,
"Sammy!" Dean glared at him a bit. "You're my kid brother- and if anything, I depend on you. Hell, you're always checking on me."
“Exactly.” He sniffled again and closed his eyes.
Gabriel cleared his throat, "When you were shot, Remy, Lucky, and Chopin tore John Winchester to shreds." He had to save Sam and Dean from saying it. He was their father...
Pleased, Cas wrapped his arms around Dean. “I want to get her clothes, obviously. But I also want to get her art supplies and a small TV.”
"Of course not. You don't have to at all, I promise." He assured him as he moved to smooth his brother's hair gently.  "Sam, I know you don't know me... Cas, hell... you don't know me or remember me enough... but I promise, I will not hurt you."  He stood, "Let's get you tucked in, okay? The room has a queen bed. Is that enough?"
Dean made a soft sound, trying to get a little closer to his fiance. "Drink your water, Cas."
Suddenly Elias grabbed another slice of banana and smushed it against Dean's mouth. "Eat!"
Sam arched into his touch, gasping. “You… you decide!”
"This is awesome- thank you all." Pushing his hair back, Dean told himself that he wasn't even slightly teary as he watched their girl.
"No problem, Cas." Dean sat on the other side.
"I want to run some blood work on you... check you over, all right?"  The Doctor knew why Sam wasn't going to be in heat, that was obvious... Castiel... they'd been here about four months. It was more than enough time for Cas to have gone into heat. "Then we can get you on suppressants."
Cas sat down and reached for his plate of waffles. "That would be appreciated."
“You like when I boss you around.”
Michael's teeth ground together at the visage that Dean's words painted for him. Fuck. His poor brother...
"See? She's got the eating thing down." And damn if that didn't make Dean relax. He'd been worried about their girl and looked up preemies, and complications... all he'd managed to do was terrify himself.
“Gabriel!” Sam came running toward them, his expression horrified.
"Nothing new. Deal." He'd get Sam a classic that Dean could work on with ease without having to worry about a computer system to screw it up every time a sensor went bad. "Actually... what if I give you a car that I already own? You can pick- just not Cherry."
“Haha, loser.”
Sam gladly leaned into the kiss, nipping Gabe’s lower lip. “God… missed you...”
Gabriel couldn't deny him anything, honestly. He was going to have to work on that, though he didn't see it happening. Castiel would laugh when he told him that, he was sure. They paid for the cleaning supplies and got them put into the car for ease of carrying before heading back inside. "Where to next, Samsquatch?"
"Always, Honey. I always told you I could talk enough for the both of us, didn't I?" He sat back down in his chair. "Eat your breakfast, love. We've got a busy day and the wedding's at noon."
"Just make sure that he knows it's not just because he's the first pretty...
"How so?" Gabriel moved to finish getting his shoes on, knowing that time was winding down.
Sam sighed dramatically. “I just wanted to suck you off.” He waved a hand at his legs.
“We can talk about it when we get home. Let’s pay for your makeover, then we can hit a few more stores before we meet the boys for lunch.”
Dean groaned, pulling Castiel over him. "And I want it to feel good like it should, Castiel." He shifted his hips, pulling his legs up so the older man settled between them.
"I know. He's going to freak out." Dean pressed his face into Castiel's shoulder, sighing. He wouldn't blame Sammy- fuck knew that he'd freak out too in his position.
Dean shrugged, trying to hide the way that his cheeks were heating up. "Well, finish eating... then we can open presents." He looked at Castiel. "How's the French Toast casserole?"
The last thing that Gabriel expected to see when he walked into the hospital was Michael and Lucifer walking towards Castiel's room
Beaming, Sam kissed Gabe softly. “I love you so much,” He rumbled.
"It's just the truth, Cas." Dean licked his lips, watching Castiel closely.
Cas grinned and willingly molded against Dean’s side.
Cas gave Dean a grateful look as he settled his brother on the plush couch. “Dean’s right. You’re fine... I’m going to get you some tea.”
Cas slowly petted Remy, smiling.
"Anywhere you want. Go ahead and take off my pants if that's what you want." Gabriel took Sam's hands, sliding them over his chest towards his navel.
"Always." Dean kissed his hair, then grabbed at the food, holding out a spoonful of food to Castiel. "You need to eat."
His hips thrust upward and he reached between their bodies to stroke himself. “I need you to touch me. Please. Just like that.”
Bobby sipped his beer, eyeing the growling box by the door. "What do you suppose is in there?" He asked Ellen, tilting his head.
Stroking Cas's back gently, Dean hugged him closer. "He's going to be all right, honey." He looked up at the brothers. "Cas kept his cool, helped us get Gabe free, and found the syringe that we connected the Talwin with."
"Shh... I know, love. I'm sorry that I couldn't come with you, but soon. And we'll get a massive bed so my Samsquatch can sprawl out like you like while you hold me." And his heart ached, along with his empty arms. Still, he'd bear it because he'd do anything for Sam.
“You are something pretty,” Sam replied, cupping Gabe’s cheek in his big hand.
“Is it Castiel?” She sniffed, resting her head on his shoulder.
"Now... I'm wondering.. would you allow me to tie you up for this A, Sam?" Gabriel started to unlace his tie, watching the younger man closely.
“We… did this...”
"Rem... sh... it's time to sleep." The Marine scratched at his dog, trying to keep that fuzzy haze of sleep.
XXXXXXXX
Gabriel paused in working the tea box open. "But..." He glanced out at the couch and sighed. "I guess you're right. I'm sorry."
"Zachariah, that makes no sense. You made it pretty clear that you're not even attracted to me. Besides, I'm engaged." Completely confused at his ex's behavior, Gabriel made a note about the water he'd taken from the cooler. It gave him something to do, at least.
Sam sat up carefully, worriedly watching his boyfriend. "Gabe? What's wrong?"
"Did I forget an important date?" The blond tilted his head, a lock of hair falling in his face.
“That would be wonderful.” Cas’s fingers were skilled as he worked diligently.
The small boy wrapped his arms around Dean’s neck. “This!”
“Sam..” Cas shook Gabe. “Gabe, wake up!”
Nodding, Sam opened the freezer and pulled out a pack of chicken breasts. “I’ve had fantasies about cooking with you. Is that weird?”
Unable to resist the pull of the desirous illusions that lay ahead, Gabriel headed into his office, pausing as he saw Sam to allow him to appreciate what he wore.
Gabriel was shaking as he fished out his card and handed it over to Dean. "I'm sorry-"
"I... I think I need help." Gabriel's voice was husky and broken up.
Sam froze, his eyes widening. His dick immediately swelled. “Y-yours?”
Looking at him for a long moment, Dean gave a helpless little shrug. "I don't know, Cas. I don't even know."
Nodding, Cas spread the Nutella on his waffles eagerly.
"Mm. Me either. Identical twins, too." He couldn't stop himself from grinning at the thought. "Three boys. Zeppelin is going to be the most protected girl that there is."
"Indeed you did. You were very good about it." He smirked a bit, alluding to the punishment fantasy and how he'd told him that he was good in the bookstore.
Cas was far more relaxed, but there was still that tiny voice of doubt on the back of his head. “You mean that?”
"For your thoughts? Penny for your thoughts?" He felt himself flushing a little.
He let out a shuddering breath and used his free hand to stroke Dean’s hair. “Oh...”
"Sam's gullible like that," Dean muttered, opening the workshop again, letting them in.
"That's enough of a scholarship that you wouldn't have to worry for a while," Gabriel assured him with a smile.
“That’s so nice...James too?” Cas whispered.
"Kittens- they're cold. Hold them close to your body while we get home. They look about weaned, but..." Dean shook his head, holding out the bag gently to him.
Sam held a large hand to tara’s belly. When he felt the baby move restlessly, he gasped.
Emma froze as she saw the picture, her jaw completely dropping.
"Well..." Cas produced a black silk thong. "Can I take these off of you...with my teeth?"
The green-eyed-man was a quick learner, and honestly, the work was good and honest, and it kept his hands busy. Less time to get stuck in his head.
Can yawned loudly and rubbed Dean's arm. "Night..."
"Reasons why I am short." Gabriel shook his head, handing him the waters before climbing into the bed.
“You’ve just had a traumatic experience. But you’re safe.” He kissed Gabe’s lips softly.
Nodding, Cas found Athena's collar and struggled to put it on her. "Dean… Help?"
"Dean... can you check on Cassie? I normally do about now, and... well..." He motioned to his leg, making a face.
Sam snacked Dean’s hand and bolted out of the room, leaving Dean to eat his dust.
"Sam..." Gabriel licked his lips, his breath catching. "We should shower, continue this when we're a bit cleaner- not that I'm not loving this." That at least would stop him from doing stupid like coming when Sam was touching him.
Dean blinked, tilting his head. "They aren't straight…"
He leaned into the little kiss and curled up with Dean. “Tired...”
"Oh?" Dean raised a brow, blinking as he saw Gabriel dancing around the kitchen with MC.
Dean glanced at his husband, finishing the bite of food in his mouth after a long moment. "Do you want to, love?"
"Hold on, I'll get us a blanket." Dean grinned, heading inside. He grabbed a few from the closet, figuring Gabriel and Sam might want to join them.
Moving around the kitchen, Dean poured him a glass of juice before he set it in front of his boyfriend. "Kiss, Cas?"
Dean slowly raised an eyebrow at Charlie, not sure what else to do. He didn't understand her.
"Thanks, guys." Dean yawned, trying not to fall over
"You think he'll like it, Cas? I want to do something romantic for him at least once a day." Gabriel looked at his brother over his shoulder.
Dean grunted a little as Castiel's weight shifted in his arms, but let them cuddle for a bit.
"Sam, oh-
"Oh fuck!" Tilting his hips, Gabriel wrapped his legs high around Sam's hips. Being pinned by him was so nearly perfect- but just not quite. "Can feel you leaking, Sam, I need you."
"...Dude. I've had one for a while. Pretty sure I know that by now." He was just being a smart ass.
Gabriel glanced over at Sam where he was studying before looking back at his book. He didn't want to distract the other man from his goal. He knew that he wanted to get his homework done.
“Sounds great,” Cas yawned, rubbing his eyes. “Gabe, come give me a hug.”
Gabriel set his phone down, starting to cut into his steak.
Dean bit his lower lip, looking Castiel over. Fuck, the man was beautiful... and the look in his eyes...
The young man grabbed his backpack and slung it over his shoulder. "Just thirteen days of class left," he said brightly.
"Brats, you're all brats." Gabriel rubbed himself along Sam before sitting in the chair that he'd pulled out.
"I know, Samshine. You're not going to lose Dean." Stroking his fingers through Sam's soft hair, Gabriel sighed a bit. This day hadn't gone as planned, to say the least. He was still a bit in shock. Ketch and Mick were in the cockpit, flying the plane, of all fucking things.
