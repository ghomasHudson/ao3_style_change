Gently his slender fingers caressed the letters before he opened those doors as well.
‘’ Okay, shut up, John Shut up. The first time we met—the first time we met—I knew all about your sister, right?’’  he then speaks desperately.
"Genius detective proved to be a fraud and in grief of all the makes best friend commits suicide, ‘’I have read it in the paper so it must be true. I love newspapers. Fairy tales... and pretty grim ones too.’’ And through dark lashes Jim looked at the other male daring him to make continue.
But now he stood on the rooftop trying to be as brave as he could be
Heart beating fast John struggles to find a way to get out of this but he cannot find one and he groans softly as he clutches the sides of his head in frustration.
'' Sherlock and his brother and all the King's horses couldn't make me do a thing I didn't want to’’
‘’ What? Sherlock asks the tone in his voice demanding.
Swinging open the heavy oak doors he walked right to the west wing which was labeled
To soon a group of paramedics rushed in and pushed Sherlock out of the way.
‘’I will burn you. I will burn the heart out of you’’ the treat hung into the air as Moriarty talked to Sherlock.
‘’JOHN’’ he gasped as he turned around and ran away leaving a baffled Mrs Hudson   behind.
It  indeed did not take long for Sherlock to find one of his old dealers and get high as soon as he sat foot in Bakerstreet
Mrs Hudson probably helped him.
'' Oh God no'' Sherlock gasped as tears began to fall '
From the first moment this had started John knew it would come to this. He had known from the moment Moriarty had kidnapped him to get to Sherlock. The way the male had looked at him while strapping the bomb onto his body. The consulting criminal wanted to get to Sherlock, and to do that he needed John Watson. Heart pounding wildly in his chest he had looked as Sherlock, clever amazing Sherlock as he talked to the devil himself. Yes John had been afraid he might die right there and then, but if it meant protecting the others he was perfectly fine with it. The red dots flickering on the spot where his heart was. But his gaze is fixed upon the red dots on Sherlock’s head. He needs to be alright. It doesn’t matter if he dies. But the world needs Sherlock.
And from one of the rooms the army doctors voice spoke softly ''
'' John what’s going on? ‘’ Sherlock asks although his clever brain must have figured it out already.
At that Moriarty shrugs ‘’ Oh he won’t. He will grief too much, so please just kill yourself. It's a lot less effort. Go on, For me’’.
Sherlock could barely remember the days passing leading up to Johns funeral.
’’ No, I'm coming in’’ the raven haired males replies and he moves closer to the building, Getting ready to run in and save the doctor.
It is exactly at that moment the great Sherlock Holmes, the worlds only consulting detective completely falls apart.
Even though the figure below is small he imagines he sees the look of shock on the detectives pale face.
He thought she had been in danger but with a jolt he realized who truly was.
and he swallows fighting back tears/
John can hear it clearly over the buzz of the traffic as if Sherlock was right behind him. Then without another though he trows away the phone having recorded Moriarty’s confession.
’’ Okay, shut up, John Shut up. The first time we met—the first time we met—I knew all about your sister, right?’’
There were no words to describe what Watson was to him. How can one properly describe the center of ones universe?
John forgets to breathe for a moment ‘’Sherlock’’ he gasps.
‘’This phone call, it's... it's my note. That's what people do, don't they? Leave a note ‘’
This was not supposed to happen. Sherlock, Mrs. Hudson,,Lestrade, they are all going to die now.
‘’Yes, of course. My suicide'' the army doctor mutters softly,
‘’ Alright Keep your eyes fixed on me.   Please, will you do this for me’’
‘’ Oh god. John’’ he gasps ‘’ Listen I— I— I can't come down so we'll just have to do it like this.’’  His lover speaks and Sherlock feels his concern grown. What has Moriraty   said to him?.
The older Holmes was interrupted by a growling Sherlock who had flung himself out of his chair and was now inches from his face
‘’Just. Do as I ask. Please stop there’’ a quick pause'' Okay, look up. I'm on the rooftop''
The chair the doctor would never sit in again, read his newspaper or one of the badly written spy novels.
Standing a bit straighter, every bit the soldier he was John glares at the other male ‘’ Sherlock can still prove that you created an entirely false identity he doesn’t need me for that’’
To be honest he could not even remember waking up the day of the funeral, and getting to the church.
John forces his voice to be even although his lips are trembling ‘’ Nobody could be that clever. Sherlock ‘’ but in his mind he quietly adds
'' Okay, look up. I'm on the rooftop''
At those words Sherlock feels his stomach drop.  Never in a million years could he imagine John saying those words. ‘’ Why are you saying this? The detective speaks swallowing back tears . But   instead of comfort only comes more pain.
He had moved John's chair upstairs because he could not bare to look at it.
Even though   Sherlock knows that John probably does not mean it he cannot fight the shock ‘’No. Alright, stop it now.’’ And Sherlock takes a step forward. He is going to end this now. But before he can move John almost yells at him.
John thinks frantically hoping Sherlock might pick it up. But sadly his friend does not .
‘’ John what’s going on? ‘’ Sherlock asks demanding an answer to this madness.
But his spoken reply is different and much harsher ‘’ How do I know you did not I researched me?. On the other side of the phone he hears the sharp intake of breath.
''Nobody could be that clever. Johns reply is strained like he is fighting back tears. ‘’ How do I know you did not I researched me?''
‘’No. Don't….
John takes a deep breath before he finishes the sentence for Moriarty ‘’ Unless I kill myself and complete your story’’
Trowing it in the trashcan the detective made up his mind., in order to move on, to not go completely out of his mind, he needed to delete John Watson. Every memory, every bit of love needed to be disposed of.
With a heavy sigh Sherlock laid himself on the sofa, hands in a prayer like position.
The memory seemed so recent yet years away as Sherlock found himself face to face with Mrs Hudson.
The service was simple but beautiful.
At that Mycroft had to duck in order to avoid the still full cup of coffee that was thrown against the wall, barely missing him. Raising an eyebrow he watched the cup fall and the large brown stain that was now on the wall.
Faking disappointment the dark haired male shook his head ‘’ Nah. You talk big. Nah. You're ordinary. You're ordinary. You're on the side of the angels’’
sorry for the long wait for updates!
That evening he found himself back at 211b setting behind his microscope. ''John can you give me'' as soon as the words left his mouth Sherlock bit off a strangled cry. This was never going to get easier.
BUT my muse is back so weekly updates for this fic!
And before he can do anything a sickening thud slashes through the air making his blood run cold and knocking the breath out of him. His mind palace completely freezes over and comes crashing down. Its large majestic walls tumbling down and completely shutting down.
Suddenly after a moments silence Sherlock replies. There is anger in his voice and hurt and panic the doctor realizes.
‘’John, are you okay?’’ He   asks wondering why he was there.
'' What do you want Mycroft?''
A small crowd gathering, and to the sleuth it seemed that they seemed to keep him away.
''This needs to stop'' he muttered as he stood up picking up one of Johns jumpers discarded on the sofa. (Fighting back the memory of clutching it while sobbing merely hours ago)
The fact that he was high as a kite did not help much either. The disapproving looks of some of the quests said enough,
Johns reply was immediate but firm ‘’Oh, I may be on the side of the angels, but don't think for one second that I am one of them''
Biting his lower lip John then walks to the edge of the roof watching the traffic go by, Then he sees the person he hoped he would not see.
'' Goodbye, Sherlock’’ he manages to mutter although his throat is thick with grief and tears that he wants to shed.
''I was afraid you were to far in your mind palace'' the government official spoke as he gazed at his younger brother
He screams as he sees his lover jump from the edge.
Finally, reaching the body he fell down on his knees managing to grab the army doctors wrist, and finding no pulse.
Grabbing the phone out of his coat he dials the now familiar number which is quickly answered by the deep baritone of the consulting detective.
The screen flickered before the next line appeared
‘’Well you…are the …heart..thump thump.. thump thump’’ and slender fingers mimic a beating heart.
Gasping he calls out ‘’Sherlock No, stay exactly where you are. Don't move.’’
Nodding John agreeds ‘’Yes Sherlock told me’’
Trembling fingers pushed Yes.
At this Moritarty grinned 'Atta boy’’ he purred happily.
‘’No. Alright, stop it now. John’’
At those words the detectives hues widen in shock ‘’ Leave a note when? He then asks but he already figured out where this is going.
''Doctor Watson, I am afread you just made him worse than ever''
The days seemed to pass by in a blur.
with a golden plate.
Clearly sticking out of the crowd with his tall slim figure with raven hair and long coat is the only man he had ever really cared about, the love of his live Sherlock Holmes.
It hurts John to hear the concern in his best friends voice but he cannot turn back now.
''Please'' the detective choked out. ''He, he is my friend let me through!''
Moriarty was right. falling is just like flying. The blonde thinks as he falls. Luckily it’s over before he has too much time to think about it. A short THUMP and everything goes black.
John had known that it had not been Sherlock he really wanted. Every fiber in his body wanted to cry out to Sherlock. But he couldn’t it would be the death of him, of them both and god knows who else was unfortunate enough to be close to the pool outside. And he cared about the dark haired male far too much.
"Staying Alive, so boring, isn't it? It's just... staying. All my life I've been searching for distractions. And you and Sherlock Holmes were the best distraction and now I don't even have that. Because I've beaten you both. And you know what? In the end it easy. It was so easy. Now I've got to go back to playing with the ordinary people. And it turns out the great consulting detective and his little helper were ordinary. Just like all of them. Oh well.’’ Jim purred as he stalked towards John
And to his horror John sees Sherlock taking a step forward.
‘’John, are you okay?’’
‘’Sherlock no, stay exactly where you are. Don't move.’’ And of course Sherlock obeys   .
The consulting criminal grins happily As if proud he thought of such a thing ‘’You gotta admit, that's sexier. Now Off you pop. I told you how this ends. Go on. Your death is the only thing that's going to call off the killers. I'm certainly not going to do it''
Suddenly John’s head perks up and even a smile touches his face. Perhaps there was a way to come out alive and he openes his mouth to speak.
''You brother mine, are completely and utterly useless!'' Sherlock spits out
Mycroft utterd a pained sigh as he watched his brother leave
Moriarty then walks up behind him placing his fingers on John’s shoulders, not unlike the caress of a lover.
[ Keep close eye on Bkr street, 7% solution unavoidable]
’ Leave a note when? Sherlock asks but John knows he already figured out where this is going.
Moving forward quickly John grabs Moriarty’s coat threatening to throw him over the edge and meet his fate with a stop on the pavement ‘’ You're insane.’’ The blonde growls angry.
that mantra keeps on resounding trough his mind as he walked up the stairs towards Moriarty who smiled like him like a small kid getting his Christmas presents.
Pulling out his mobile he send a quick tekst to Anthea
‘’There's a recall code or a word or a number. I don't have to die if we got you Moriarty’ The blonde male then spoke finding his bravery again.
‘’ Listen I— I— I can't come down so we'll just have to do it like this’’
Moriarty smiles even wider as he looks that the blonde doctor.
The dark haired males eyes widened in feigned surprise ‘’ You're just getting that now? Okay, let me give you a little extra incentive. Your friends will die if you don't’’
He did not even flinch as hand pulled him up and dragged him inside pushing him in a chair. And after a moment a cup of coffee appeared in his vision. Finally, he managed to look up.
Uttering a small sigh he continues ‘’This phone call, it's... it's my note. That's what people do, don't they? Leave a note.’’ And he gazed down to where Sherlock is looking up at him. He feels those dazzling colored hues fixed upon him.
Voice dripping with venom the blonde male then continued ‘’I am prepared to do anything. Prepared to burn, I am prepared to do what ordinary people won't do. You want me to shake hands with you in hell? I shall not disappoint you''
Immediately he sees the raven haired males lithe form stop dead in his tracks.
‘’ Sherlock’’ Johns gentle voice speaks to him.
‘’ Turn around and walk back the way you came’'
In the distance his voice ran out
Sherlock was at the table, looking through the lens of his microscope studying the decomposition of nocnitsa liver when exposed to certain types of fungal matter. Lestrade had messaged after John had already gone up to bed. Sherlock had gotten a text, no more than a four he concluded, but since Sherlock was particularly bored right now he figured he would take what he could get. He bounded up the stairs, not bothering to knock on the door since John would be asleep by now anyway. But imagine his surprise when John sat up as soon as his door was flung open, his eyes glowing violet. When John registered that it was Sherlock his eyes returned to his usual deep blue. Another puzzle to figure out at a later date. Of course, he had known that John was Fae, it was painfully obvious, but he couldn’t figure out what type. He had been trying to since he had first seen him in that lab at St. Barts all those years ago, but still nothing, his scent didn’t give anything away other than that he was a submissive, or as submissive as Captain John H. Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers was ever going to be. He was tempted to just give up and ask John himself but that would be boring.
He encountered Juno Caelistis at the door, head of security for the entire place whenever she wasn’t causing war amongst the mortals. Sherlock passed her with a curt nod and kept going, he headed straight for the restricted section where most of the First, Second, and Third Hierarchies resided when they came to the surface in this area. Sherlock entered the Second Hierarchy’s designated area. He went looking for the Dominions since they usually congregated around one another. Andromalius was seated on a plush couch towards the left hand side of the room, he was conversing with Curson.
I rattled off details and a statement to Gregson without hardly hearing myself speak. I took no pleasure in the conclusion, however clever. A police surgeon put stitches in Watson’s shoulder in the other room, and Gregson gave me a queer look when I asked after the man’s competence.
“It’s nice to know that’s still possible,” he said, “after all this time.”
“Since we’re both awake and I find the cursed eyeglasses weighing on my mind,” I said briskly, like I had never intended to say anything else, “I may play something. I had the Stradivarius retuned last week. Mycroft kept it in relatively good condition, considering how little he knows about instruments.”
“Eventually.” I remembered those early days. His chronic insomnia, his nightmares. They followed him like a shadow. The ones I saw around him now were different, slow to lift. That was true for both of us.
And with that, he threw himself sideways onto his chair with a tremendous sigh.
Watson looked up, searching. His face sweetly lit by the smoky lights. On a whim, I raised one hand high in the air and waved.
“If you promise to keep that to yourself,” he said, “then I’ll narrate the end for you.”
And I wished, or hoped - not for the first time but never quite so clearly as this moment - that he could read in my face the shape of my own thoughts, the kind I could not find a way to put into words.
It was late, the night quiet. And it had been some time since I’d played for him or anyone to hear. I ghosted fingers over strings in scales, perfunctory. He was quite right; he could never tell a well-performed piece from a poorly presented one, and always mixed up his Baroque composers.
I chose Brahms; a bit ambitious, but it suited the night. Opening chords, the strings bit into my fingers in that old and familiar pressure.
“What is it?”
“Let me,” I said, guiding his fingers out of the way. He let me, wide-eyed, and I pushed the heel of my gloved hand into the juncture of his shoulder until he hissed. My pulse beat heavy in the tension-hot heel of my hand, and I could feel his own there too, unsteady.
It was a curious thing, his anger. Sometimes it rose with a righteous determination from the bottomless well of his steady hands. Sometimes it was quick like a flash. He rarely held grudges, but he remembered arguments, like conversations, from the perspective of a storyteller. For my own sins, I had been known to linger on frustration or jealousy for hours or days. Watson didn’t like to let things fester.
“He is getting away,” I said instead, shortly.
I knelt in the mud next to him, followed the pointing line of his finger. He had an intermittent tremor in his hands, but it was absent now. There was a wound, bloody, hidden beneath her hair. He had lifted her braid to find it.
I knew him well enough to read the unwritten thought between those words. Men he’d known, like his father, who hadn’t learned the lesson that there was no pleasure in anger.
“Don’t worry, Mr. Holmes,” he said, shaking his head. “You know we admire the doctor around here. He’ll be alright.”
“You may wake Mrs. Hudson,” Watson said, “and she will have your head.”
“And you loathe pointing out the obvious,” Watson said, which was well deserved. “You’re right as usual, old man. I can’t say that I am. I thought it might improve, moving back here. It did, after the war. Eventually.”
Over the last three years, in my far journeys, I had thought to have grown the kind of spine that could not be shaken. The things I had seen, had done. I had been well-prepared, I assumed, to return to London and face whatever peril the final removal of Colonel Moran might involve - and the possibilities were always clear as glass in my mind. Danger, to my housekeeper, my brother, my friend.
Sherlock had the suspicion that despite the way things were, there was something wrong. After that first day, after Sherlock had come back, things had gone back to the way they were before he had left, albeit with far more casual touching than before, like he and John were just picking up where they left off so to speak. Mrs. Hudson had slapped him, and cursed him six ways to Sunday, but she was the same as ever, even if she was also still hurt by his deception. But John…
“Oh, oh Sherlock, Spirits look at you. What happened?” it was whispered into the quiet of the room around them, but John didn’t get an answer, Sherlock just looked down and stared at the floor. They sat there in a heavy silence, and John was just about to give up and ask something else when Sherlock let out a sigh, his shoulders slumping and his face falling. Sherlock’s voice was so quiet John almost couldn’t hear him speaking, even with the heightened senses. “Moriarty, he was after you, you and Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade, and I… I couldn’t let- I couldn’t let him get to you. He would have hurt you, tortured you, killed you and I… he couldn’t, I wouldn’t let him. So, I jumped, but I was never dead, but he had to believe it and that meant you had to believe it too, or he would have had people get you. I was all across the world taking out his web, and it was so extensive and big, and it took what felt like centuries, but I hunted down every person in it and I killed them so they couldn’t kill you. And I’m sorry John, I’m so very sorry for hurting you too.” Sherlock was almost in tears and John threw everything to the wind, his anger and loss and heartbreak.
John graduates from school with little fanfare. His grandparents were dead, his family didn't really speak to their cousins and aunts and uncles, so it was just his mum and Harry, the latter of whom had been on her way to drunkenness, his dad was already there and thankfully at home still. He didn't have many friends to cheer for him as he walked across the stage. It was a little disheartening if he were being honest.
His mother notices first and after she finished lecturing him she brought him into a tight hug. Once he was feeling a little better, meaning after he had taken a shower and eaten, he explained what had happened. His mother looked slightly nauseous at what he said, about how his body had reacted. She made him swear to never do something like that again. He told her that he would have to be barmy to even consider it. He had gone to bed that night, his hair back to its original length, with the thought that he would have to be content with this from now on.
“Well, as it were Angel, I need to call in those favors from you two.” Both demons glanced at one another then stood, Crane gestured to follow after him and Sherlock did. Crane led them through corridors and to a counsel room of sorts.
When he returns to school the next week, nobody will even look in his direction; the other students avoid him when he walks by. Some are reverent, most people have never seen a Fae in person and believe that the Fae are holy beings, gods that deign to walk amongst men. Some in fear, the Fae are powerful creatures one and all, no matter how weak to other Fae they may be even the weakest among them is capable of things most humans would consider impossible. And some in disgust, those few believe that the Fae are less human which technically is true, not that they're less then human but not human in the first place, even if some do look human, but that they were nothing more than beasts which could be said about a few Fae since they
From a distance, I could see the moment he came to the realization. His face stricken and his hands shaking. Holding aloft my cigarette case and the letter. His legs gave way.
From a distance, I saw Watson approach the scene of my fabricated crime. It would have been the scene of my demise, without luck or chance. I had written him a letter knowing it might be the last thing I ever put to paper - knowing that he would want those final words for himself. When we'd met he had been a shell of a man who'd previously been a doctor and he'd transformed, with slow time, into somebody very nearly a writer. It shouldn't have mattered to me, whether or not anybody heard the record of my last thoughts. My triumph should have been able to stand on its own. But it would matter to Watson. And I found, as I wrote them down, that I very much wanted him to know them.
“I have this feeling,” Watson said, and his words were slow, coming out of him in starts like he wasn’t sure of their destination, “that I can’t seem to shake.”
“How did they manage to get here before we did?” Watson, hurrying at my elbow with his uneven step, sounded out of breath. I didn’t answer him, just pushed my way past a burly police officer until Lestrade saw us approach and waved us over.
The front door to 221B had a specific timbre to it when slammed, which caught my ear like an accusation every time.
And then it softened, the comfortable familiarity of our middle age and the creased lines around his mouth. I saw there the feeling behind his words, behind his easy forgiveness, even behind his anger. That steady love I knew I could always find when I looked for it.
The purely physical reactions of the body to its own emotion. I swayed, he steadied me. He caught my face in his hands. My own had not left his shoulder and I could feel the rapid race of his heart. When I tried to count it into beats I found I couldn’t and again, on an impulse, I leaned forward to meet him. It was easier, the second time. Our mouths met, his pulse leaped.
“Exactly so,” I said, and stood. He followed stiffly, rubbing his hands together in the chill.
“I saved you the paper,” I said, “as you didn’t stop to read it this morning.”
“Dead?” Watson’s voice was unnerved and his eyes, following my face, clouded over. “We were too late?”
"Do you mean to say that you read my train of thoughts from my features?"
“It isn’t necessary,” Watson said, gently shooing Mrs. Hudson out of the room with the kind of grace that completely disguised it as an attempt to be rid of her. “Really, it’s quite superficial. If I am in any pain tomorrow, I will call on the hospital. I promise.”
Even high above them, the falls roared in my ears and the only thing louder was my own frightening pulse.
“That you were dead,” he said, ending his own sentence like I hadn’t spoken at all. I had missed something. He turned to the window again.
“My dear Holmes,” Watson said. “Look at me.”
I saw it, so clearly in his eyes and the set of his mouth. He asked me a question without words.
Across the platform, moving closer towards me with every step and every moment, Watson smiled.
3. 1894
I reached to touch the bare skin of his shoulder, the edge of his new stitches. Watson’s eyes dropped fast to my hand, then returned to my face just as quickly. His skin was hot with injury and he hissed through his teeth until I moved my fingers across the width of that old scar. I had not imagined it, before. I could feel his pulse against my hand.
But they were not final. My luck - and my folly.
I was waiting for his disappointment, the well-thought-out lecture, the tired sigh. Instead, he was busy removing his sodden boots, with none of that on his face.
I’d know that gait anywhere. Could pick it out of a hundred people, or a thousand. Blindfolded, I would still hear it and know. One step slightly longer than the other, and a shift of the weight from left to right rather than straight. Leading with left hip, right shoulder. Old injury, developing arthritis, and time.
The victim was a young woman who, two days before, had sat herself in front of us in our rooms at Baker Street and told us a strange tale involving doors that should be locked, and a gentleman following her in shadow late at night. From a distance, I could see her neck was bent and twisted. Nothing natural about the shape of her fallen form, nothing living. Two days ago, Watson had brought her brandy to calm her nerves, brought laughter to her face in spite of her fear. He attempted to peer past both Lestrade and myself into the alley, and I turned to block his way.
“To prevent her death.” I could not coat my words in reassurance, even in the face of his blue eyes and the strife there. I could only say what I knew. “But not too late to find who murdered her.”
“You perplex me,” I said again, and I touched his hand and stood to fetch him the paper.
“Holmes,” Watson said, voice soft in that tone he adopted when talking to the families of murder victims and sobbing widows in armchairs. Something delicate, as if he expected me to flee. In spite of all my attempts, I was doing a poor job of disguising my own malcontent. “I promise, I am quite alright.”
The platform was crowded with people, all impatient that the train should arrive. It felt strange to be in the city again, anonymous in a crowd when I had gotten used to a room turning to ask my advice. I relished it, and pulled my scarf around my face tighter against the chill. Even the press of bodies and rising voices couldn’t cut it, and it wasn’t until the tracks began to rattle and steam that time began to snap forward again.
We sat in companionable silence for a long moment, looking at each other from our respective armchairs. The fire threw steady light and shadows across his familiar face. Watson sipped his whiskey, propped his bad leg up and opened the newspaper with a rustling of paper. I relit my pipe and watched the snow, now coming down in earnest.
I was too far from him to see the expression on his features, as I would ever be again. That was as clear as the salt spray on my stinging face. As soon as I glimpsed the outline of a second man, a sharpshooter’s eye and the second attempt on my own life, I knew. The web was more tangled, and more dangerous, than I ever anticipated - and Watson could only be free of it if he knew nothing of it.
“An oddity,” I agreed. “London seems to be awash with them these days. And they do have a way of finding their way here.”
“I’ll give her that one.” I pointed at the decimated bust of my face, the round bullet hole in its forehead open like a third eye.
I did not move, until he righted himself and turned away. He would be back soon, if I knew him at all, with more men to help search. They would find Moriarty's body at the bottom of that steep ravine and that would be all. And end of it's own kind. Watson would carry that story back with him, and all I hope is that he could find a way to someday understand.
“I wanted to know the identity of the killer,” I said, sulkily.
For three years, I had closed my eyes and envisioned that shape as I had seen it hundreds of times. Set against his armchair or peering from the front window into the street. Leaning over the paper and breakfast or asleep across from me in a train car or at my elbow. Ready with a reassurance, with the right words I could never find to soothe a scared mind, with a well-aimed shot, with orderly stitches and a steady hand.
Watson lowered the pages halfway, to reveal his raised eyebrows. “You accuse me of pretending?” He asked. “If I wish to fall asleep before supper I will do so without shame, my dear Holmes.”
“Would you, please?” Watson nodded, eyes closed. “I’m chilled to the bone.”
“And yet I have, with only a reasonable measure of complaint. What,” Watson’s eyes creased when he smiled now, a new addition with age, “I wonder, do you suppose that says about me?”
I did.
The paper dropped. He was, indeed, holding onto the corner of a book beneath the paper but it wasn’t, as I had guessed, the hated Verne adventures he kept bringing home.
I had behaved abominably, been mean, inconsiderate. Through the years I studied his habits and his edges, his fathomless limits. I had seen him lever weight into his hands to sit to breakfast, favoring one leg and one shoulder, and I had allowed myself to act in order to hurt anyway. An apology was an admission of that. I wanted him to demand one of me, to make it easier to stomach.
“Your officers are inexpertly examining the body of a young brunette woman in a dark house coat, a distinctive mole under her left eye. A typist, lives with her mother who is heavily in debt and refuses to leave the house, routinely walks this street late at night because she has nobody to accompany her on her errands.” I said it flatly, “Unless I am much mistaken.”
“No,” I admitted. “No it is not. Perhaps we ought - “
Watson ignored this dig in the direction of the Yard, and he didn’t turn to look at me.
“Can you tell me why,” he grumbled this half under his breath, pulling off gloves and scarf and swatting at the melting snow on his hat with businesslike disdain, “the day a bloody blizzard blows into this city, half its population who have never before expressed concern over their own health suddenly decide they must consult me about it? The street outside is more frozen over than the river. I’m surprised I didn’t fall and crack my own head open.”
We had hoped to reach the street quickly enough to stop the impending disaster, but we arrived too late. It had taken me far longer to sort through newspaper archives than I expected, and so by the time I returned to Baker Street and all but pulled Watson out the door behind me, the sun was already darkening the sky. He had been surprised but game, already a pattern in the three cases I'd invited him to sit in on. Since the night of the Hope affair I'd had no reason to ask him to dash after me to follow a developing trail, and there was a part of me that was eager to see what he'd say.
“Watson,” I said, and then stopped. His own seat at the window, and mine leaning against the frame, meant he had to look up to me. I did not know what I wanted to say, exactly, but acknowledging his fears and my own, mirrored but not the same, was what he would insist on were he in my place. So I thought, until I saw his expression.
This wasn’t what I’d expected to hear upon his return from his rounds, and so I hung onto his familiar irritation, nonspecific and well-meaning, as long as I could.
I pulled my fingers from his hair, crossed around the armchair to pull my knees back under me. He was humoring me, or perhaps even laughing at me in the peculiar way he had, turning a joke back in on itself so I could share in it.
He ran, alone, away from the falls and towards the town and help. I turned, alone, towards the cliffside, and the future.
He stopped a second time, shutting his jaw on his own words so quickly I could hear his teeth snap against each other. The sharp sound dispelled the strange and tenuous stillness cleanly, and I found my own voice steady on my reply.
2. 1891
He stopped short, like he had forgotten himself.
I flattened my hand across his shoulder, covering both old scar and new. Such fleeting warmth that I tried to press into my mind even as I moved to turn away, hoping he could accept it for what it was. Both my intention, and my fear.
It was followed by a step on the stairs, seventeen of them, and then Watson opened our door, bringing with him a gust of frigid winter air. It tossed papers and the embers of the fire, biting across the nervous system like a slap. From my armchair, I could see fine crystals of snow gathered on the shoulders of his coat and the brim of his hat, his face red with the cold.
6. 1918
“I’m fine,” Watson snapped this like a command to my unasked question, a rare tone of near-military precision that didn’t suit him or the words.
Watson’s expression as he moved past me read trepidation -
“Holmes,” Watson said. His voice creaked, late night disuse dropping it low. “I woke you.”
“I deduce,” I said, “that you are holding a novel beneath your paper, which I can judge by the strange position of your left hand and the fact that you’ve only turned the top portion of the page over. If it’s another dreadful Jules Verne I shall toss it out the window.”
Watson fired. Once, twice with neat precision. Our target collapsed, howling and clutching his leg.
I waited, raking the commotion with my eyes in search of my target, increasingly desperate as the minutes wore on and the crowd pressed closer to the train. I didn’t know what he was wearing, where in the train he’d been seated. I only trusted my own ability to know him through anything, no matter what.
“What do we do now?” His face was a question; he looked at me to see an answer.
So when I turned to usher Watson away from the alley and the body, I found myself stopping short to see a flash of clear anger on his face.
1. (1881)
he said without words,
“Isn’t it obvious?”
He stopped, wet his lips. He hadn’t spoken in detail of Mary’s death, and I hadn’t asked.
What I did next was an impulse. An illogical one, crossing an unspoken line we two had walked for years. Since I had returned. Perhaps since the very first day we met.
Watson’s face cleared. A raise of the eyebrows, released tension in the jaw. He nodded, an acquiescence of my suggestion, and beneath his careful reluctance I saw the flash of something bright and alive.
“I know that.”
“Excellent, Watson,” I said. The nature of the injury was already aligning with the details inside my head and I could see the way this act of violence unfolded and why.
“Your edits returned, I believe. I left them on your desk. Watson, you perplex me.”
“There were times,” he said, “where I’d wake and before I opened my eyes I’d be certain to find myself back here, at Baker Street, with you waiting on me to dress and catch a cab. I would be so certain, down to the suit I’d don and the clues we’d be following. And when I’d open my eyes I’d find myself right where I was supposed to be, with Mary asleep next to me. Or, later, sitting in my office or by her bedside - “
“We hardly parted on good terms this morning and you’re asking after the paper,” I pointed out. I could still hear his angry footsteps, the sharp slam of the door.
“Then I can be thankful for my own face,” he said, smiling. “I’ve been called an ass before, but not for that reason.”
“He grazed me,” Watson said, “it isn’t serious. It stings, is all.” But he didn’t push my hand away.
I looked up at him sharply, and he leaned forward across the space between our chairs to put one well-callused hand on my knee.
“She was strangled, wasn’t she?” Lestrade sighed again and shuffled his feet in the mud. The night was growing damp and colder, fog settling in. He wanted to be out of the street. I wanted him to make himself scarce, as well. “Even I can see that.”
“Watson,” I called it across the platform, across the space between us and all that time. Intolerable fraught months separated by a continent and joined only by our erratic letters and mutual worry, those long three years, and decades and decades. He couldn’t possibly hear me at that distance. It didn’t matter. He held his hand aloft. His face was a beacon, creased and tired and beloved like nothing else I’d ever known.
He stared at me for a long moment and there was nothing I could discern on that face, features now more familiar than my own and as legible as the front page of a book.
“Behave yourself,” I said, and swatted him away. His grin was boyish. It always drew to mind an image of the very young man he had been, long before we met. Round-cheeked and rugged and easily charming.
My hands were unsteady, a tremor in the knuckles I could not stop. The purely physical reactions of the body to its own emotion were inconvenient, and fascinating.
“Much to the relief of Scotland Yard,” Watson said, relaxing slightly into amusement. “You do know their number of unsolved cases nearly tripled in the three years that you - “
The bullet had hit him at the edge of the considerable scar his shoulder already bore, and the neat stitches he’d received from the police surgeon pulled the tissue white and flat. Three lines of black thread, carefully tied off. I counted them with my eyes, studied the red edge of the wound, the crater of scarring a souvenir from the bullet that had, years ago, entered through his back, shattered his shoulder blade, and broken his collarbone. The new injury was clean. It would heal without trouble.
That particular vein of deadpan humor was new in the last three years, and somewhat alarming. “Now is hardly the time to employ me as a whetstone to sharpen your wit,” I snapped.
The good grace that came so naturally to him - concern and reassurance, compassion, grief, romance - so often seemed to escape me. From my hands such gestures felt cold or clumsy, unnatural. I was not suited for such things.
It felt self-aggrandizing to assign myself all the blame. I could not determine, without data, which of the changes I could see stemmed from my own actions, from the loss of his wife, from the simple passing of time. Perhaps they were all tangled together.
“Sometimes,” Watson said diplomatically, “things happen that even you cannot predict. A mad arsonist with a gun would qualify.”
“Come here,” he said and, not understanding, I crossed the room to him. I wanted to leap into the certainty of determination, reveal his intentions to myself before he revealed them to me and also - I did not dare to guess what he was thinking. I did not want to dare.
“Just as I knew the man was dangerous. I should not have - “
“Holmes.” He still hadn’t moved to pull his shirt over his shoulder, standing still under my scrutiny for far longer than I needed to bear witness to the facts. “I knew the danger, too. I chose to go with you just as I chose to shoot him. Being fussed over by a police doctor is not an experience I enjoy, but please let’s not pretend I am not capable of accepting the consequences of my own decisions just as you are. I wanted to be by your side. And I’d rather you than me. You’re a terrible patient.”
But an idea in concept was not the same as being faced with a moment of physical terror, no matter how often considered. Watson belt double, clutching his left shoulder with his right hand. I absorbed detail; the tear in his jacket, the smell like burning fabric covering a low coppery tang, the pulse in his throat right under his jaw. His eyes looked to mine, their color lost in the late night gloom, and whatever he saw on my face must have startled him because he straightened faster than I could stop him. All in a matter of seconds, precious time to lose track of our target.
“You were angry,” I pointed out stubbornly. “I vexed you.”
Two days ago, Gregson had nearly knocked down our front door with an urgent plea. I had been secretly pleased at the number of improbable cases the Yard walked my way in the six months since my return to London, and this one was no different. Three mysterious fires, a suspect seen fleeing the scene, and a member of the same family present in each home that shortly afterwards went up in smoke. It had all unfolded quickly after my discovery of a set of ash-coated footprints, and night found us in quick pursuit, our suspect dodging cabs and leading us on a merry chase through alleys and back streets. I was grateful for Watson, and his loaded revolver, three steps behind me as we rounded a corner to find a dead end and brick walls.
He didn’t move. Did not even blink.
“Turnabout is fair play,” Watson said, instead of bristling at my tone. He tossed the jacket aside despondently. “As I am so often the whetstone that knocks away the obviously incorrect conclusions you may otherwise be forced to spare time considering.”
I felt, for the first time in this long winter, in years - positively young.
It read thus, flat out in the crease between his brows:
4. 1895
The silhouette cast in the front windows was so familiar that it stopped me still for a moment.
Which led to this moment, and the cornered suspect firing a wild shot down an alley in our direction. In spite of myself, I flinched but it was Watson who stumbled backwards with a bitten-off cry. He stumbled, breath coming fast. I could not afford to take my eye off our target and yet I did, for a moment, turn my head.
“Man is but an ass,” I said, “if he go about to expound this dream.”
“Watson,” I said it low enough so Lestrade, still hovering behind me, couldn’t overhear, “could I trouble you for your professional opinion?”
“Well, that may have gone worse. The greatest casualty of the whole encounter is the state of this jacket.” Watson held the tattered garment up with one arm, frowning. “Torn clean through. And this stain! I should know better than to wear new jackets out when you get ideas in your head.”
“Mr. Holmes,” Lestrade sighed. “Dr. Watson. I should pretend to be surprised to see you here when we barely found out about this a half hour ago, but I haven’t the energy.”
He opened one eye to stare up at me through his brows, tilting his head back. At that angle, he was square-jawed and handsome, his lashes blond. He had done an untidy job shaving that morning, and hadn’t noticed.
“She came to us for help,” I said. “Two days ago.” His sour expression darkened into a true scowl.
I encroached the edge of something yet unspoken between us, and we both knew it. I had spun for him a remarkable story and he, shirt collar still loosened and brandy on his lips, had listened as he always had. Had followed me as he always had, into danger and triumph. That night, he and I and Mrs. Hudson had sat up and marvelled at our success, laughed like the old days, and when asked, he had moved his belongings back into Baker Street with no hesitation. But we had not spoken of it.
Considering a little extrapolation of my own, I understood so swiftly it nearly rocked me back on my heels.
And even with this surplus of data about my new flatmate at my disposal, Watson had managed to surprise me.
“My dear,” he said, “I was rather vexed, and now I am not. Tomorrow, you may well set fire to the curtains and vex me in a new way. I await the surprise. If you think you are capable of vexing me enough to truly drive me from this armchair, well - “ he squeezed my knee, his fingers now warm through my dressing gown. “You can certainly try. Will you hand me the paper?”
Suddenly, my heart was in my throat. Anxious and unsteady, my every nerve was hung on the edge of a great precipice. Icy water and wind at my back, and the promise of something magnificent before me. But not the great reveal of logic on which I had my career. It was nothing that anybody else in the crowded train station would notice, or care to notice.
Watson laughed, a genuinely amused version of that sound I cherished most. He had one version that turned a little vicious, for when something wasn’t actually funny. And another that, years into our friendship, I had been astonished to find came out only when in bed with him.
“They could try harder,” I said. “So many of them are so obviously fake. I much prefer a good murder.”
The constabulary had already gathered in the street, blocking a dirty alleyway, and I was somewhat relieved to see Inspector Lestrade’s familiar face among them. I couldn’t say I respected the man, but I could count on him not to turn me away from the scene of a crime without hearing me out first.
An inverse of what we knew. Old rhythms, well established, turned on their heads. I couldn’t bring myself to care  Where he led, I followed.
“You do prefer to see things for yourself,” he said. “Go on.”
“Nonsense,” I said, to say something. “My body may not have moved but since this morning I have resolved seven little mysteries and one rather interesting old murder case all described in those letters stacked on the mantle, mailed here over the last fortnight.”
Buttons undone, Watson pulled his own shirt down over his left shoulder with his opposite hand, and turned around to face me. His gaze was steady.
“There’s more to it than you first thought, then?” There was something off-balance about the night, his furtive glance in my direction. He presented the question clumsily but surely, and I leapt at an excuse to follow a normal conversation. He, asking and I, explaining.
He kissed me.
“Did you already exhaust the newspaper?” Watson asked from behind the folded pages. “Or would you like me to read you the agony column?”
“Hold still,” Watson said, teeth gritted in a rictus. With one hand, his left, he pushed me flat against the brick wall and with his right he raised his revolver and sighted along his own arm. I held my breath. If he had not asked for stillness, I would have given it anyway. If I breathed, my ribs would be pressed against his own. His right hand was slick and red across his fingers and I felt the moment he held his breath and pulled the trigger.
The police arrived in enough time for a red stain to spread across the shoulder of Watson’s coat. I watched it grow, steady but slow enough that, rationally, I could calculate the size and depth of the injury. It had hit him in the left shoulder below his collarbone at an angle, tearing his jacket and shirt and scorching his collar. Not deep but bleeding freely - my mind could accept those facts. Still, watching that stain spread as Watson bent over our suspect until the police pulled him upright and into cuffs was intolerable.
“I hope you’ll not hold it against me,” Watson said, and accepted the folded pages. He reached up, touched my chin and then my cheekbone. I leaned my face into his fingers for a moment. “And perhaps consider holding something else against me instead, as an apology.”
“I have not,” I said, trying not to smile, “and I might like that if I had any reason to believe you were actually reading the newspaper.”
That was cause and effect. Like evidence. An experiment worth repeating.
“That I have,” Watson said, glancing my way as he tossed his outer garments across the back of a chair with vehemence. “And you remain in the exact same position in which I left you this morning!”
We stared at each other, me caught in that plea.
And so we returned to Baker Street. Watson held onto his own elbow in the cab, careful to not put weight against his own shoulder. I stared past him at the dark street, and said nothing.
“I know that I am difficult,” I said, stiffly, “erratic, messy, and exhausting. A sane man would find me impossible to live with, no less weather it for years. I can only admire your patience."
She had the audacity to cast me a glance as she left, and Watson shut the door on her with a sigh. He turned back to his tea, sipped it one-handed with the balance of very old practice, and started to work his jacket off slowly. I could have offered to assist but didn’t, just lingered at the fireplace and simply watched as he pulled his own arm through his coat sleeve, wincing and muttering.
“Rather my fault.” Watson gazed out the window still, and so I made myself cross the room to remove the strange space between us. I chose a pipe from the mantle, joined him against the sill with the stem between my teeth. The light was a swift glow of warmth between us. “You’ve been built up to something rather sensational, I’m afraid. All of England seems eager to dig through their own family histories for a something strange enough to attract your attention.”
“I will know,” I said. The longer I studied the black threads in his skin the longer I could avoid considering the rest of him, exposed throat and the remains of freckles on his upper arm, the hair on his chest.
My own knowledge, its scope and utility, hard-studied and well-earned I had always thought, felt momentarily insignificant.
How fascinating, I thought, to watch the pull of panic take its toll on me from the outside in. Such emotions were easy to dissect in other people, a cause and effect explanation for their actions, their irrationality. I had accepted long ago that I could not remove them entirely, but had resolved to not let them act on me. Now, I could scarcely do anything more than watch them work.
I had taken stock of his tanned wrists and military bearing, his distinct limp and the way he pulled one shoulder tighter than the other - and made deductions. His tendency to startle at a sound from the street, and his late-night pacing, and his brother’s pocket-watch and nearly vanished accent - and made more. His carefully controlled anger, his deflection toward his own past and attempts to look like he was interested in my own, his obvious gambling habit and aversion to drink unless prompted. They painted a picture of a certain kind of man - unobtrusive, moderately intelligent, middling good company with shattered health and a few bad habits.
“Well,” Watson said, smiling with a kind of open mischievousness that I’d come to recognize through long experience as an indication there was something he wasn’t telling. “I’m afraid it’s one of those mystery stories you abhor. The kind with pining lovers, and twins separated at birth, and a lurid murder. I’m also afraid that I did very much notice my bookmark has been moved since I set it down yesterday.”
He gave me a look sideways. Pipe smoke drifted between us in a slow haze, trapped against the window glass.
It was a marvel, how he said such things aloud when I had barely begun to try and make sense of them in myself. Baker Street - its busy street and seventeen steps, the things I had left behind scarcely moved, and its three inhabitants - nothing more than a dream. A reprieve, more mutable than memory. I was no stranger to that.
“Nonetheless,” I said
In the dim light from the street I archived his face, cataloged the consistencies and the changes there. He wore his mustache longer than he had before, three years allowing for a change in fashion. He was thinner. There were lines around his mouth and shadows under his eyes he never had before, not even freshly returned from Afghanistan thin and brown and desperate. And there was a reticence in his gaze that had never existed before, a dividing wall between his thoughts and his face. Or perhaps I had simply lost the touch to read them so clearly. I had used the trick in the past to bemuse him. Now, it felt like an intrusion.
“She was struck from behind with something sharp,” Watson said definitively; if it were somebody else I might have snapped to spare the obvious but I let him finish. “While somebody had their hands around her neck. More than one man was here?”
“Doctor,” Lestrade shrugged, and stepped aside to clear our way into the alley.
Watson was a predictable man - patient, effective, in near-unfailing good humor. Still, it infuriated me.
“I know.”
“I will have one more scar where I already have many.” He was watching me study him, and the act of being observed made the process more intimate. “In time, nobody will be able to tell it even happened.”
Could it have something to do with John’s biology? Maybe something had happened at work that John hid exceptionally well. Or some other outside stressor, Harry maybe? But John hadn’t spoken to her in weeks. Sherlock just didn’t know, there were too many unknown variables, and until he had at least half of those he couldn’t go any farther and everything was mere speculation. Sherlock didn’t make assumptions, he had proof supported by cold hard facts. This whole entire ordeal was taxing, but what was he to do.
John sighs in exasperation at himself, wallowing won’t help him right now –though all the looks he’s getting aren’t helping–, he has more important things to think about such as finding a job and new place to live as soon as possible. His army pension only covers so much, and the bedsit was, well it was unacceptable for a number of reasons, the main one being he was liable to go crazy if he stayed there any longer. That or off himself as he had been contemplating with startling frequency as of late.
It was even colder and darker the next time John opened his eyes, he was too cold to kick his feet or flail his arms, his stomach was empty and cramping, and he was still alone. So he cried some more, though at this point his throat hurt from the frigid air, but he continued to wail. It was on a particularly harsh scream that he heard a noise, but that only made him cry harder and louder, but soon he heard someone speaking and he was being lifted into warm arms, and he was being shushed and rocked like his mother did, and even though this wasn’t his mother he still quieted before falling back asleep.
They arrive at the scene within thirty minutes of Sherlock receiving the text from Lestrade, the alleyway is sectioned off by the police tape which Sherlock ducks under quickly, John right on his heels. The flashing lights are irritating John’s eyes, Sherlock can see, but he doesn’t complain or say anything so Sherlock doesn’t worry and instead focuses on the scene in front of him. The NSY are watching him with varying expressions as Sherlock flits around from one place to another examining seemingly unimportant details with his magnifying glass.
Sorry this took so long, my laptop finally died after seven faithful years of service (may it rest in peace lol), but it's back to regularly scheduled updates now.
“I did. I told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flat mate for.” Curly starts putting his coat on at this point. “Now here he is, just after lunch with an old friend clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan. Wasn’t a difficult leap.”
Blackness… sweet relief from his world imploding for a second time.
When John is fifteen he gets his first girlfriend who he suspects likes his hair more than she likes him, and thinks him some novelty. She’s taller than he is and she likes to call him adorable, as if he's a puppy. He breaks up with her within three weeks. When he reaches sixteen he's on his seventh relationship, this one being his third boyfriend. He was nice, good looking, and was on the rugby team with him, which John was the captain of. When John finds out about the two other "boyfriends" John drops him like the sack of shit he is. As retaliation his ex thinks that he'll cut John's hair in the middle of class. What actually happens though is that when the pocket knife tries to slice through his hair it shatters like glass and John is up and out of his chair turning to snarl at whatever threat is behind him, only to be stopped short by the terrified faces of his classmate. He doesn't know what he looks like, what with his elongated canines and his violet colored eyes and his floating hair or the pulsating marks on his skin. He runs out of class and all the way home, and doesn't come out for two days after.
It is as John is unlocking the door to the flat that the hairs on his arms and the back of his neck stand on end, he’s suddenly quite sure that there is someone in his flat. And not Mrs. Hudson, which means that this person doesn’t belong and is about to eat one of his bullets.
John is about half a second away from pulling the trigger when the person who is supposed to be dead and buried six feet under speaks. And it’s only one word, but it’s said with so much emotion that John doesn’t know what to do.
Maybe this person is a demon, or maybe just a shapeshifter.
“It was her ex, abusive, which is why she broke up with her in the first. Jane Doe was out with friends to celebrate her new singleness but also to forget about her ex-girlfriend. Said ex-girlfriend works at an office job, and goes to the gym regularly, bashing someone’s head in with three… no two blows is rather impressive, she’s muscular but not overtly so.” Sherlock ignores the look that John shoots him,
After Lestrade came by John resolved himself not to wither away like his father had after his mother died, whenever he wasn’t drunk enough to forget she was even dead that is. He gets up and cleans, cleans up the left out and forgotten experiments, cleans the kitchen but especially the fridge, cleans the sitting room, cleans his own room, the bathrooms, everything. He organizes all the papers and books and knick-knacks that litter every surface of the flat, but he leaves Sherlock’s room for the most part. He folds the clothes that are left out, he makes the bed that he now sleeps in, but aside from that leaves everything else, he can’t bear to touch anything else at this point in time, and probably won’t ever be able to really.
. He is dead and John grieved and mourned, so he’s not here standing… kneeling in front of him looking like he’s been through hell, but maybe he has and now he’s back from his apparent death and John thinks that he’s hyperventilating and possibly about to pass out and Sherlock, Sherlock is talking and reaching out for John, but John is shaking his head and he thinks there are tears streaming down his face, but he doesn’t notice that now his hair is whipping around him in the torrential wind, and then…
It doesn’t translate very well into any human language that Sherlock had come across in his time on earth, however relatively short it is compared to others of his kind, but if he had to come close; caitiff, a cur, gutless, degenerate, a deserter,
When most people thought of John Watson, most probably didn’t think Fae. After all when most people thought of the Fae they imagined tall, pale, and ethereally beautiful. They imagined beings like the elves, vampires, incubus and succubae, and the like. Or if they were of the younger variety they might think of small beings who fly around with dragonfly wings and grant wishes, and while some Fae do have wings and can fly none are so small as what is usually depicted and the only beings who grant wishes were the djinn and you usually didn’t want the type of wishes they offered to fulfill. And while they might be correct on both accounts, they were not the only Fae in existence. For instance John doubts people think of goblins as Fae, or other such nightmarish creatures. Creatures like trolls, boogeymen, tsuchigumo, or homunculi. But almost every piece of myth, legend, and folklore had to come from somewhere. So most creatures, both good and evil, both beautiful and horrendous, both heavenly and demonic are real, and they were all Fae.
John was no saint, he knew that, but he had never felt the need to tear someone apart the way he had with Sally, or at least not since the war. To tear into her flesh and rend it from her bones, to crush those bones into nothing but a fine powder. To turn Donovan into nothing more than a pile of viscera and burn her remains. And for what? Because she had insulted Sherlock? As if she never had done so before. Maybe it was because of the word she had used? But that still shouldn’t have mattered, nothing John can think of should have set him off in such a way, and even now almost an hour and half later there is still this need to go find Sally and make her pay. John could feel his power, lingering just under the surface, waiting to be let out. And John was honestly afraid of what would happen if he did.

Maybe he wouldn't have had his shoulder torn out by a bullet that shattered his scapula and almost killed him.
“And what’s wrong with the landline?” Mike enquired, and John was a tad bit curious as well.
in fact animals. But to say to an elf or demon or vampire or faerie that they were no better, that they were less than a being, well odds are you would be lucky to escape with your life.
It wasn’t until John was twelve that he started to hate having long hair, the teasing was never ending, and the boys that
Comments and criticisms are welcome, Pyxy out.
John wraps his arms around Sherlock’s neck, pulling the man to him. Sherlock buried his face to the crook of John’s neck, wrapping his arms around John’s waist and squeezing tight, it was a little awkward with the height difference but Sherlock probably wouldn’t be moved and John would let him cling as long as he liked, wanted, needed. Sherlock had never expressed such grief or sadness or anything of the sort really. He hid all of that behind a deceptive mask of indifference that he claimed was just sociopathy. John knew otherwise of course, knew just how much Sherlock was capable of caring about those he considered close to himself, but John never knew he would ever let him witness a show of such emotion, especially any emotions that could be mistaken for weakness.
What John hadn’t realized, was that that long day would turn into long years. Of knowing Sherlock and living with him, and growing attached to the crazy elf. When Sherlock falls, John honest to gods felt a piece of himself die with Sherlock. John had gone home at the end of that awful day and despite how much John knows Sherlock would have hated it, goes into the man’s room and crawls into his bed, burrowing under the covers to submerge himself in Sherlock’s scent. He proceeds to cry, to wail and scream and shout, because it’s so terribly unfair, and John

“Then who said anything about flat mates?” John asks regardless,
He did heal more quickly than any human would have and when he could at least mostly function on his own, he was shipped back to London with his aching and broken body, where he had an empty bedsit to greet him, his useless therapist to talk with, and a loaded gun in his bedside table.
After the coffee and the talk on the park bench, Mike led the way to Barts, John following along at a sedate pace. They reached the lab before long and were greeted with the sight of a head of startling black curls, the face belonging to said curls was pressed to a microscope.
Mike had a rather sly smile on his face as John took a moment to be stunned, he took another moment to breathe, remembered not to be so paranoid despite the fact that this man had just raised every hair on his body, as he did whatever it was he was doing on John’s phone, before asking a question of his own. “Sorry?” Not a very brilliant question but he felt it was an important one none the less.
But he really couldn’t help his looks, he’d tried cutting his hair before, it was a very unpleasant experience that he avoids thinking about, and he can’t help how short he is or how… feminine he looks to be frank, not elf standard beautiful but not human either. His narrower waist makes his frame seem more delicate than if he had a more streamlined torso; his lack of a sharply defined jawline gives him the effect of softened facial features, and the long hair is just sort of icing on the shit cake that is his masculinity. But the worst part, the absolute worst part about all of this, is the fact that nobody even knows what type of Fae he is. Nobody. At least if he knew that all fae like him looked like this it wouldn’t be so bad. Thankfully John has more or less grown used it, and he’s mostly secure in who he is at this point.
to call his hair cool and have long hair themselves now call him things like, twink and faggot and nancy. So he tries to cut his hair, it reaches almost to the middle of his back at this point and he had never entertained the thought of cutting it before but now the hair has to go. So when he gets home from school one day, when he knows that his parents are still at work and that Harry won’t be home until later because she went out with friends today; he rushes upstairs to the bathroom and gets the big pair of scissors from under the sink, grabs his hair at the base of his skull and has the scissors lined up just beneath. When he tries to it feels like his skin is trying to crawl away from him, but he steels himself, it is just hair it will grow back he thinks to himself, so he takes a deep fortifying breath and cuts his hair.
John rather liked uni, and not even mainly for the classes, though he did like those as well, but because people were more worried about themselves than they were about him. Not to say that he didn't still get lots of looks. After all he was nineteen and was as tall as the average girl with hair longer than any other girl’s on campus, and not even his musculature could make him look more masculine. Some guys liked that, even some girls, so he had more off and on relationships than he could count by the time he finished with his rotations at Bart's.
Curly, as John had just mentally labelled him since the man has still yet to give a name didn’t even look up as he repeated, “Which was it, Afghanistan or Iraq?”
“Lestrade this is barely even a four, if I’m being generous. You really ought to work on your marital problems, it’s slowing you down.” Lestrade makes an indignant noise but doesn’t deny or dispute it. Sherlock sighs and has to resist the urge to rolls his eyes at the level of incompetence that he has to put up with.
Everyone in the surrounding area can feel it, the sudden drop in barometric pressure, like an incoming storm, can feel the electricity skating across the top of their skin, raising hair and goosebumps in its wake. All eyes turn to John, and though he doesn’t know it his eyes are now heliotrope in color, are fixed firmly on one Sally Donovan who seems to have cottoned onto the fact the she may have overstepped several lines, first of which is never cross John Watson.
He came face to face with a portly looking man a several inches taller than himself, not that that was very hard or anything. He wore glasses and had streaks of grey through his brown hair, all in all, very ordinary if vaguely familiar. The other gentleman held his hand out. “Stamford. Mike Stamford. We were at Barts together.”
He has but a split second to find something to say to Donovan, but can’t for the life of him think of what, and what good is he without his cutting words. But the shock of not only Donovan knowing that word, but directing that word at him, has briefly short circuited him.
John sighs quietly, making sure to keep the heavy suspicion out of his voice when he replies with a slow, “Afghanistan. Sorry how did you know…” he trails off as a woman comes into the lab carrying a cup of coffee, which she hands to Curly as he speaks.
“How do you feel about the violin?” Curly asked. It took a moment for John to realize that the man had even spoken to him, and he hadn’t even heard the question.
When John turns away Sally collapses in a heap, a dazed expression in her eyes. Gravity seems to once again take control, everything in the air crashing to the earth abruptly, a few tires burst, and people stumble, but overall damage is minimal. John touches Sherlock on the shoulder as he passes, the genius gasps and lurches forward as he’s suddenly released from whatever was holding him, and immediately turns to follow John, not caring about anything else aside from getting him home, calming him down, making sure he’s okay now.
