After a moment, it was Cas who looked away, defeat clearly written on his features. Right away, Dean felt the need to explain.
would already know about Cas’ accident. Trying not to let it get to him, Dean leaned back against the railing.
idea. Jo was the sunny one, wearing all yellow, while Charlie wore green, which went wonderfully with her red hair. Dean himself sported a purple outfit.
And he honestly needed something to distract himself from that rough and melodic chuckle. “I feel like I missed something.”
When he’d had his fill – for now – he leaned back and simply gazed down, waiting for Cas to open those blue eyes so he could get lost in them again. He didn’t have to wait long, Cas’ eyes fluttering open, his smile instantly stretching even wider. Not a word was uttered because none were needed as Cas simply pulled him back into a long kiss, back into his embrace. Back into letting their bodies speak of the love between them.
“Hello, Castiel,” Dean heard himself say, still caught in this intense gaze. How he had been able to sound so normal, he had no idea, for his heart was still racing and he didn’t seem to be able to calm it down.
Well, there was one thing Dean certainly couldn’t deny: the guy obviously made Cas happy - which, of course, was good.
want it, now that he was allowed to kiss Cas? Closing his eyes in clear invitation, he was quickly rewarded with the press of Cas’ lips on his, so careful and sweet, as if Dean was something breakable; something delicate that Cas simply had to cherish. And Dean would be lying if he tried to deny that he liked this feeling of being treasured.
Thank God, at least he was “Daddy” again. Grace also seemed to be in quite a good mood, so maybe his other problem was already solved.
Dean even had a good and long talk with Chuck and while he enjoyed every minute of it, part of him felt melancholic, knowing that any of these talks could be the last real one they ever had. In some ways, it hurt. He had known that man for forever, had listened to him whenever Chuck had to put teenage him and Michael back in line, had followed his advice over the years. After Lisa’s death, Chuck had taken Dean and Gracie in but long before that, he had been another stellar father figure in Dean’s life; next to Bobby.
“Caaaas!!” Gracie wailed, clinging closely to him as her tears soaked his shirt, the cold of her face slowly seeping into his skin.
“Cas, I love you! Always have and always will. I was just too stupid to understand it when I was younger and... I know it’s probably too late now,” he added, swallowing thickly. “You chose him and not me and I can understand that.” He could… he really could understand, even if it killed him. God, he would be such a hypocrite if he pretended otherwise. “But I needed you to know. You... you had the right to know. I’m not going to tell you that I’m the better choice because I love you more than that snob up there ever could –”
[Eileen 11.36pm] Dean, seriously, call us! Michael texted that Gracie kept Cas from leaving. How is she? And how are you? If you need to talk, we’re here for you. I’m here for you! I even promise not to tell Sam anything we’ll discuss.
Maybe it was because she had just shown him once more that he had done something right in the way he raised her.
Lying in Dean’s arms that night was unbelievable. It was unlike any feeling Cas ever had; he felt content and safe and warm but on the other hand, there was a mix of protectiveness and maybe a little bit possessiveness, as well. This was his man, the man he loved, the man who loved him. They hadn’t said it yet but they both knew.
. But still. I could meet the cutest guy possible, I could go out with him or hang out – and we still wouldn’t realize it was the other one unless our skin touched at least once and we then messaged each other. Tell me how that’s possible with social distancing.”
There it was again. Those words that, while true, hurt so much. And Dean couldn’t take it anymore. He finally took a leap of faith.
Well, look at that... the Night before Christmas grew so damn long I had to split it 😂 but fear not... this simply means one more day of Lumberjack Cookies for you, because part two will be posted tomorrow 😉
After having another restless night, Dean digs up some old memories. Later that day, it's time for the first Sunday dinner at the Shurley's.
Cas’ reply sounded somewhat forced, but the happy smile was still on his lips and it gave Dean a smidgen of hope. He wasn’t willing to let go of the man just yet, too captivated by his eyes, and as it seemed, Cas wasn’t rushing either. Just like the day before, the tingling where they were touching was almost driving him crazy. Maybe even more this time, since it was skin on skin.
“Ehm,” Cas replied and looked down at his hand as if he had to check, “broken wrist; shoulder was dislocated; a few bruises, cuts, and scrapes. I’ll survive, though,” he assured him, looking back up at Dean.
Dean watched his arm until the last of C’s writing vanished and even the tingling sensation was gone again. Only then did he march back to his bed and flop down on it. Right away, his eyes wandered to the wonderful words on blue paper again.
Somewhere in between posting a sign with the prices and setting up the float, Dean was tackled by an excited ball of energy. Looking down at his daughter, Dean was unable to tame the smile that appeared when he saw how happy his daughter looked in this moment. Face red from the cold, a wide grin, and sparkling eyes, Gracie was the purest picture of joy and Dean wound an arm around her shoulders, hugging her close as she clinged to his side.
Taking a new piece of paper, he tried his hand at copying the picture Mary Bailey had of George lassoing the moon for her. Okay, well… in Dean’s picture, it was nothing more than a stick figure that held a lasso, which in return was wound around the moon, and Dean was sure even a ten-year-old would be able to draw this better… but he kinda liked it.
If things had been different, he wouldn’t be here as a friend who counted as family. No, he might have been here as one of these loved ones–
“Sure,” Dean threw in when Gracie had to take a breath, quickly stopping her flood of words. Looking up, he saw Cas watching them with a soft smile, apparently enjoying Gracie’s excitement as well. “As long as you stay with Cas, you can do whatever you want.”
“That’s not-” His voice gave out - which was probably for the best. He had no idea what to say anyway. Though his gaze was on their joined hands, he still noticed Alice’s head moving out of the corner of his eye and he was sure she was examining him closely.
Finally done, they made their way to the stage, Eileen nudging him in his ribs as he tried to rein in his smile. It was harder than he thought and he gave up after a while, just bathing in this happy feelings.
“That’s not …” Dean started and didn’t know how to go on, shocked into silence. It seemed he really needed to select his words more carefully with Cas. Sighing, he pushed away from the frame, deciding to stop hiding behind jokes and cocky behavior. “That’s not what I meant, Cas. I’m sorry. I just … I came here to talk to you.”
One last option to win back Cas’ friendship and if this wouldn’t work, he would stop bothering the man.
He sighed again, turning back towards the door. “Forget it,” he told him quietly, knowing that he had blown his one chance. Just because he couldn’t find the right words.
Instead, he watched as she lifted one of the smaller, decorative flagstones. When she looked up, he wordlessly handed her the hand fork and kept watching as she loosened the ground just far enough to press the letter in before putting the flagstone back down.
“Yes, I did - though it didn’t answer my question,” Dean replied as he stopped in front of the outer door and pulled on his jacket.
Cas sighed as he dropped his pen. Reading that his soulmate had been with someone else… it hurt. It truly did, though he knew it hadn’t happened out of malice. To be quite honest, he had long realized that he had feelings for D beyond the normal soulmate connection. It might be the demisexual side in him, but all the writing with D… yes, he knew he had fallen for his soulmate, deeper and more thorough than he had ever heard from any of his friends or family about their experiences with their own soulmates.
They’d been talking all day, Dean not feeling like doing much else on his day off but to be there for his soulmate. Now it was getting late but he was still lying on his couch, no real energy to get up and go to bed. Or maybe he was too nervous to focus on that. C had already retired to bed, even though they didn’t plan on sleeping yet, simply lying down and getting comfortable and Dean was glad to see that C was still taking it easy. Especially since they had physical therapy that morning, they were always worn out afterwards.
Bart shook his head, holding his pregnant wife close. “Of course not. I’m still beat from the flight anyway. Let’s head home.”
The group chuckled and Dean easily joined in. “Oh, definitely. But I’m also looking forward to torturing you again once we’re all back.”
Dean was too stunned by his brother’s blindness to do more than gape and it was Eileen who gave her husband shit. “Really, Sam?” she pressed out between her giggles. “You hadn’t figured
He had no idea how long he was standing in the middle of the road, staring at the spot where Cas had stood, mind racing and completely silent all at once. Bare of any coherent thought.
Right away, he spotted a door diagonally across from where he stood. It was opened and Dean swallowed hard, stepping closer. Just as he got close enough, someone opened it further and then blocked the doorway – and Dean stopped abruptly, rooted to the spot, breath knocked out of his lungs.
Reaching out, Dean let his fingers run over Cas’ shoulder blades, caressing his skin, mapping out his body. Cas was lying on his stomach, face turned to Dean, hugging his pillow. The blankets only covered him to about his midsection and if the room hadn’t been so pleasantly warm, Dean would have pulled them up to make sure Cas wasn’t freezing.
Still, Dean stopped where he was the moment the door closed behind Gracie, still a few yards away from his porch. Looking up at the man standing there. Waiting for the first move. When Michael simply sat back down on the porch swing and kept his gaze on him, Dean sighed and closed the last of the distance, sitting down next to his best friend.
He had to close his eyes for a moment, so damn conflicted between his need to be by his family and his very strong wish to never let go of Cas again.
The silence that fell instantly around them and the few gasps of shock had him buzzing with excitement and by the way Cas’ lips – still pressed to Dean’s – pulled into a grin, he noticed and enjoyed it too.
“Thank you, Castiel. For letting me sit with you,” his daughter said, already all packed up. “And for the pie and hot chocolate.”
Getting out of the car at last, he shot a quick message to Sam, asking if they were still coming over for dinner tonight, as he made his way over to the barn. With any luck, a good old quality family time would soothe his aching heart...
“And that’s it,” he interrupted his own train of thoughts, quickly getting up and making his way to the bathroom. He was only halfway there when his alarm started to play
Yes, Dean could totally see why that was. But before he could reply, someone from behind shushed them. So instead, he grinned at Cas, hopefully telling him without words that he understood and that this topic wasn’t over yet.
So for now, this was the only measly explanation he could give. “But Cas, you… you’ve always been my exception somehow.”
Closing his eyes, he tried to add another lock to his feelings, tried to continue to keep them bottled up. At least for long enough to hide from his family.
I know some of you have both stories open to read them side by side. If you do and you downloaded AC at one point, I would like to ask you to please refresh it. My dearest beta
“Wow,” Dean replied, not able to stop himself from opening the book to leaf through it. He had seen copies of it before, but never this well kept, never this beautiful. “Wow, where did you get this?”
Max hesitated and Dean had an inkling that it was not because of the question itself but more because he had no idea how to answer. In the end, he nodded.
“Huh?” Dean asked in confusion, tightening his hold on Cas’ back. It didn’t look like he was going to run away but Dean still wanted to make sure… “What do you mean?” he finally asked. “We had it yesterday.”
“And Uncle Chuck was there as well to watch it. And of course Uncle Michael. And all his siblings, even that one brother – Dad, what’s his name?”
Deep in his head, it took him a moment to notice that Cas seemed just as thoughtful. There were fingers on Dean’s back, drawing lazy patterns, but every now and then, they would still and almost clutch at him. After the third time he caught this movement, Dean gently asked, “What else is on your mind?”
But mostly, he tried to ignore the warmth that was coming from his knee being pressed into Cas’. Tried to explain the tingling feeling in a rational way.
“I’m sure Gracie has a lot more she wants to show us. And should we get cold, I’m sure Luke won’t mind we spend a bit of time in his diner.”
“A few weeks ago, I decided to write a letter. I never expected to get a reply – and I never actually did. Not in the usual way, but…” She bit her lip again, fiddling with the edge of one of the notepapers. “I think I just… needed a way to write out all my thoughts. Other than just telling them to mom. And I felt like this was the only person I could tell it to without it getting back to you. I mean, I trust everyone in our family but… I didn’t… well…”
Dinner was almost over, the last of them scraping forks over their dessert plates for wayward crumbs, when Dean finally leaned closer to Cas.
“I just want to tell all of you how happy I am that you all followed my wish for such an extraordinary family Christmas – and of course, my dear Winchesters, you all count as part of that family as well.”
Trying to get them in a more comfortable position, Dean bent his knee. But it only resulted in jostling them and Dean was reminded of the mess between them. Before he could offer to get up and grab a towel, Cas was already leaning back, forcing Dean to drop his arms once more.
Could see himself taking Gracie there one day. Maybe walk along the Seine with her, or around the Louvre, watch his daughter take in the art and be amazed by the new culture, meeting new people. He saw them in all the places Charlie and Jo described to them in such detail…
Checking his phone again, he had to stop himself from smashing it against the wall when there was still nothing. He was so worried sick he didn’t even know what to do anymore.
“Hey, Dad,” Gracie replied, sitting down with him on the couch – more so on his lap than anything – hugging him close. “Merry Christmas.”
And for the first time in a long time, Dean let his heart speak before his brain could shut it down.
“Dean, she has been gone for so long now. Do you really think she would have wanted you to be alone? For you to not love again? Or that
Cas was saying something to Gracie which Dean couldn’t make out, but his daughter shook her head and as he drew closer he heard the rest of her answer.
“Yeah,” Dean replied after a quick glance showed him that they were alone in the kitchen. “Sure. Why do you ask?”
How long they stood like this, he didn’t even care to tell. It didn’t matter – time and place held no weight as long as he was with Cas. As long as he was in his soulmate’s embrace.
important thing for him. And if that meant talking to her because her time of wallowing alone was over – well then Dean would have to suck it up and let it happen.
He was about to go get his phone to check for any messages and call Cas in case there were none when the front door opened. The flicker of hope he felt in his chest was smashed in the worst way he could have ever imagined. It was Gracie and she had obviously been crying.
“Well,” he replied, and by the calm tone, Dean was sure the topic didn’t bother him at all. When he looked back at him he also reached for Dean’s hand. “Sometimes it just takes a bit of time.”
The evening progressed in a somewhat normal manner. The atmosphere was relaxed, everybody was in a good mood, and conversations were all around. Apparently, Dean was the only one who couldn’t quite enjoy it. Even though he tried not to – especially with Michael apparently keeping an eye on him – he found his gaze drifting towards Cas almost constantly now. More than once, he thought about just walking over and starting a conversation. But then Cas would look right at him and quickly avert his eyes, clearly not interested in any interaction at all.
Contrary to the previous night, the next morning went as smoothly as planned. Sam was there ten minutes early, Alice and Harry already packed and ready to go. After an extra long round of goodbyes, Dean and Gracie stood by the door, waving after them until Sam’s car took a turn and left their view.
So now not only did Cas ignore him and confuse him in the process, his best friend was also keeping an eye on him to … to what even? What was Michael thinking Dean would do?
It seemed, the man was a little geek when it came to Harry Potter - which Dean thought was positively cute. If only Charlie were here - she would have loved the man to pieces. But he couldn’t think of that now. No, Dean had to stay focused and not get distracted by the moment. Had to listen to Cas’ arguments.
Pushing all his emotions aside for the moment, he put the flashlight away again and followed Cas with a few quick steps. Not even giving the man a chance to react, he picked him up, bridal style, always making sure to be mindful of the messed up arm.
A chorus of various replies, from “of course,” to “bye, Mr. Winchester,” or “thanks, have a good one,” was his answer while he walked around the table and sat heavy in his chair, waiting for the room to clear.
A few short minutes later, Cas’ car finally pulled into the driveway, the rainbow completed with Cas in a matching blue outfit, Zar in bright orange that fit him more than should be humanly possible, and Meg in her devil’s red dress.
It was a long time until Dean felt like they were blanketed in a calmness that would allow them to talk about the one big thing still standing between them. Like they could discuss the elephant in the room without it touching their peaceful bubble.
Winding his arms around Cas’ body, Dean pulled him as close as possible, vowing never to let go again if the man would allow it.
Her question made him hesitate for all of two heartbeats, before he grumbled, “What’s that supposed to mean?”
Quietly, Dean got up and made his way to the living room where his laptop stood. Checking on Grace on the way back, he found her sound asleep. Good. After a little detour to his office to get his headphones, Dean made his way back to his bedroom, quietly closing and locking the door.
“Castiel, hello.” Eileen’s exclamation pulled Cas’ attention away from Dean. The moment the blue eyes weren’t focused on him anymore, Dean could breathe again.
By the beaming smile on his daughter’s lips, he was sure it was more than alright for her. After a moment, she also threw herself back into his arms, hugging him close. He kissed the crown of her head while pulling her closer and just like that, the topic seemed to be done.
After a few more seconds, Cas seemed to be ready. He hastily wiped his hand clean on the bedding and then reached for the lube again, coating Dean’s cock with it before Dean’s brain had even caught up with the movement. The cool liquid on his overheated flesh had him breathing heavily and he gripped Cas’ hips tight, seeking something to keep him from floating away with all these sensations.
“Exactly.” Gracie’s grin matched his and in a burst of nostalgia, Dean was reminded of the little girl she used to be. The two of them sitting on her bed as he read her fairy tales, Gracie hugging one of her cuddle pillows or plushies close and complaining about ‘innocent’ dragons being slain for no reason. No matter how often Dean tried to explain to her that the princes were only saving the princesses, Gracie had never seen it that way because, “What did those poor dragons ever do to them? Maybe the princesses liked them. Maybe they just protected them. Did a prince ever think about that, Daddy?”
after school for all three of them was fast becoming a regular thing and adding it to… whatever his relationship with Cas was, Dean found himself really fighting to keep his feelings in check. Which was not an easy feat. Now that those feelings were out in the open - at least in his head - they were not as easily buried and ignored again as Dean had hoped.
His voice cracked on the last word. Breaking Dean’s heart in the process, pulling him forward a tentative step without his conscious thought.
His hand was gone from Cas’ chin in the next heartbeat and he had to take a step back. Bile rose, burning his throat as the words sank in. He couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think. And still, Cas stood there. Expressionless and somehow… empty.
He didn’t need him to elaborate and not wanting to have the mood drop by remembering those few days they both had thought it had been all over, Dean quickly went on. “And thirdly, if you hate Papa John’s so much, why aren’t we ordering from your favorite place?”
part!” Cas replied with a grumble, ignoring how his friends rolled their eyes. He hated when they gendered his soulmate. As if it was a given that they were a man. Cas didn’t care either way – that’s what it meant to be pan-sexual. Just because his partners had only been men so far didn’t mean gender mattered to him.
Tomorrow, it's time for Christmas with the Shurleys, lots of presents... and a very fateful mistletoe...
Not that he was complaining, not really. But he would have rather spent the rest of the day without some more work to handle.
Gnawing his lip, Dean wondered what that other flag would’ve been. Would it be a bisexual flag like his? Or the one for gay men? Damn, Dean wanted to know.
I would really love to know: back when you read AC, did you suspect that Dean had seen Cas in front of the theater and that
Squinting and completely taken by surprise, Dean tried to follow Cas’ train of thoughts. “Ehm, so? I thought we would take your car?”
Especially, when he realized that Cas would have to come up here and shake his hand. Was that childish? The fact that he enjoyed the thought of coming close to Cas again?
There was absolutely no need to pretend like they wanted to spend much time out here, so they stayed at the bar and quickly enjoyed their pizza. They were down to the last few pieces when a very familiar song started softly playing from where he had dropped his duffle bag and coat near the entrance.
“I took my aunt’s last name,” Cas went on explaining, turning around and nodding in the direction of the woman Dean had seen by his side earlier. “That’s Amara James, my father’s sister.”
When Gracie got up, Dean quickly looked to the side, wiping the wetness-that-was-not-tears away from his eyes.
For me, she leans more to the Winchester side of the family: blonde or dirty-blonde hair (a bit like a
This time, we'll hear a bit of Spanish - once again, translations are there as "hover overs" as well as in the end note.
Scoffing at that thought, Dean shook his head. Since Fate was such a bitch lately, he most likely would. He would dream of Cas the night after he had lost him – most likely for forever.
For now, he played along, pretending the Impala-argument had convinced him. Throwing his hands up in defeat, he focused on his best friend.
Dean actually hated that - hated that some people thought his daughter had to be cozy with them. Even when she was little, Lisa and he always made sure she had a choice. If Gracie didn’t want to be hugged or kissed or even touched, they never forced her to. Not even when other people had the audacity to tell them that their daughter was misbehaving. Quite on the contrary, those people had another thing coming because Dean was always quick to tell them that he would not force his daughter into doing something she did not like. He had raised her to know her own boundaries and he would never tell her to break those just to look like a well-behaved little doll.
“Hello, Dean, hey Gracie,” she said with a wide smile. That sort of smile Dean had come to learn meant she was trying to get his attention. One that was usually followed with her hand on some part of his arm, sometimes even his hand.
Before the weight could even settle, before consciousness had even fully won, and before he had even opened his eyes, Dean became aware of the sounds and smells in his house. He heard the clattering of dishes and pans, smelled bacon and eggs and pancakes and freshly brewed coffee. But most of all, he heard laughter.
Shaking himself out of his musings, Dean turned his attention to Kirk, helping him set up the tables that would soon hold a wide array of cookies. All the while, Kirk was his obnoxious self, measuring the tables this way and that, to assure they fit the norm and the safety procedures - not that Dean had known there was such a thing for a simple cookie sale, but whatever.
“Got a secret lover we don’t know about, little brother?” he asked cheekily. To Dean’s surprise, Cas sent his brother a withering glare - but otherwise did not reply.
thinking along those lines. Yes, maybe that made him seem dense, not realizing what his feelings truly were. But this wasn’t the time to dwell on the past.
“Oh, so … you actually do remember my first name,” he said, thankful that his voice sounded normal, maybe even a bit haughty. “I wasn’t sure if maybe you’d forgotten.”
He knew Eileen kept them updated on everything Dean-related and him openly admitting to his feelings like he had last night was something huge - even he knew that. Therefore, it really was no wonder his friends had been informed right away. Dean had long gotten used to his friends and family talking behind his back about him. They only meant well and tried to do what they could to keep him safe.
With one last kiss for Gracie and a wave to the other girls, Dean finally left the backstage area and made his way over to the seats in the first row he’d saved earlier. The other three were already taken, his thick coat settled on the last free chair. Picking it up, he pulled it on before leaning down to great Eileen with a kiss on her cheek and a quick hug.
As he focused on the scene rather than his feelings, Dean noticed that something was different today. There was a third cup of coffee, another piece of pie, and an extra chair at their table.
How come, sometimes, nothing happens for weeks and then everything seems to happen within a few days? With every encounter between him and Cas, it felt like a push and pull and every time Dean had time to
Making it to campus in record time – possibly ignoring some speed limits – he parked his Baby and hastily scribbled back a
Cas was obviously thrilled about this reaction – well, who wouldn’t be? – and once Gracie let go of him to pick up a box, Cas stayed on the floor, simply leaning on his elbows so he could continue to watch Gracie. Meanwhile, she let out another squeal of excitement and hugged the box close to her chest.
When Cas nodded, Dean moved his head just so that he could press an open-mouthed kiss to Cas’ forehead, before starting to explain. “I think I mentioned earlier that I felt guilty when I first met you again, right? Because of Lisa and my feelings for you?” He had rambled so much and so quickly, fearing that Cas would run away again at any second, that he couldn’t even recall all he had said. Thankfully, Cas nodded, so Dean went on. “I mean, please don’t get me wrong: I did love her. I still do, actually,” he admitted, swallowing softly. Lisa would always be a part of him; not just as the mother of his child but also as his confidant, his friend, and, yes, as his wife that was taken too soon in life. “She’ll always have a place in my heart, and I can only hope you’ll understand that.”
It was no secret that the two families were close and that the Winchesters spent their Sundays over at the mansion. So that covered that topic. On to the next one.
Dean could see a happiness in his eyes that told him Cas was not judging him for what he did. If anything, he seemed rather… glad about it?
Dean’s mouth dropped open at the sheer picture C was painting here for him. In his mind, it all looked so fantastic and he would love nothing more than to see them like that. Like the angel he knew them to be. Damn, why was life so unfair? Why did it keep them apart instead of just letting them be together?
Careful not to jostle the two figurines, Dean pulled his daughter to his side with one arm, pressing a kiss to her head.
Stepping up to the table, he waited for a few more heartbeats, seeing if either would notice, but neither did.
For the first time, Cas did not reply with a nod and a stoic face. No, for the first time since his return, he actually smiled back, leaving Dean perplexed. On his own accord, Dean’s smile spread and it was a real battle for him to follow his daughter right away without saying anything to Cas or even walking over to him.
Sighing, Dean accepted the limitations and instead of being moody about what they couldn’t share, he lay back on his bed, eyes on his arm, pen in his hand, and began to enjoy all that they
The touch pulled a breathy moan from Dean, his arm around Cas flexing even more. “Totally different,” he breathed out, tilting his head to easily capture Cas’ lips.
Cas’ back arched off the bed, pressing them even closer together, and his moan alone sent fire through Dean’s whole body. But it was Cas’ answer – breathy, and yet so sure, so prompt, as if he’d longed to say it for ages – that had Dean nearly lose it.
A friend on Facebook asked me how I picture Gracie. It made me realize that I never gave you a real description of her, mostly because I like to give my readers the freedom of imagining an OC any way they want. But I was wondering: would you like me to add that in an author's note?
Quickly, he booted up his laptop, trying not to lose the fickle thought of a quote whispering around his mind. He was sure he was remembering correctly. Sure that there was a saying similar to what he was thinking of. Pulling up Google, he quickly typed in some keywords and not even a minute later, he was whooping in triumph.
When he opened the door though, it was Bobby. His words brought exactly what Dean needed; finally something to do.
Gracie complied, switching off the torch and putting it aside. Her nose was already back in her book before Dean had even turned around.
Dean had been too numb to react or defend himself in any way and what should he have said anyway? Of course, he knew how it must have looked to them. Of course, he understood. But nothing they could say or do –
With the cookie sale relentlessly drawing closer, Dean kept a close eye on the clock, not breaking up their time until it was absolutely necessary. When he really had to leave, to make it in time for his students to arrive, Dean got up.
Instead, Dean tugged Cas’ hand and once he had pulled his attention from where Cas was still fondly watching Gracie, Dean nodded towards the barn door. They told Gracie good night and headed outside, bracing the storm once more. Dean was relieved to notice that even with the addition of the battering wind, Cas’ footing seemed more sure than when he’d first arrived, maybe even back to normal if it hadn’t been for the ice and snow. He was sure there was still a little bit alcohol left in his system – but he didn’t appear drunk anymore.
“So am I,” Dean gave back, still looking straight ahead to keep focused on where he was going. He only made sure to tighten his hold, just as a precaution.
Despite his forced calmness, his voice was still bathed with authority. He knew his students hated this voice. Probably as much as he hated using it. But he wanted - no, he
She was under her covers and looking up at him before Dean had caught up with all the activity. Finally, he shook his head, chuckling as he sat down on the side of her bed.
At least this time, the guy was dressed – though his gaze was just as calculating as before. But Dean refused to back down, staring right back. Whatever the guy was thinking about him or his and Cas’ history, it didn’t matter. Really, if Dean thought about it, no one’s opinion or judgement would ever matter; no one’s but Cas’ and his own.
Scary as it was, but the second option certainly made more sense. Most likely, his feelings for Cas made him hallucinate.
“I’m glad to hear that,” he replied, winding his arms back around Cas. He had dropped them somewhere along Cas leaving kisses all over him.
Dean had no idea how to reply to that. Hell, he had no idea what to say at all. Should he tell them that they were right? That he had witnessed the same? That over the years, his daughter had learned to live with the loss of her mother but of course, had never gotten over it? She still wasn’t - most likely never would, if she was anything like him… which she was.
“Yes,” Dean replied, only to backtrack right away. “I mean no. Not for marrying Lisa. But … for … for … damn, I don’t know, okay? For him having to suffer, or whatever.”
“Get it together, Winchester,” he admonished himself, brushing a hand through his face before hiking up the lapel of his jacket to protect himself further from the cold. Fastening his grip on his duffle, he turned around and marched back from where he had just come. He had made Gracie a promise – more or less – and he would not let his own insecurities get in the way of that.
Gracie though… Gracie was another story, of course. Even though she had inherited Dean’s laid back way in many things, she was also still a kid.
Excusing himself, Dean left the living room. Maybe meeting Cas alone would finally help Dean to find the right words to mend this.
❄️ for leaving me comments still, some asking, some pushing, some begging – I assure you, they were all read, appreciated, and often enough a push in the right direction.
“No. Everything was okay when we got back,” he quickly summarized, unable to move away from Cas. “I’d already sent Gracie to bed. But Bobby had a gut feeling and checked on her a second time around midnight. We’ve been with her ever since.”
While Dean continued walking around the front and to his driver side, he watched as Cas hastily got into the night blue Chevy and was gone within seconds. So this beauty of a car belonged to his old friend. Well, at least the guy had taste.
One eye cracked open and his daughter grinned cheekily at him. “But I know you were going to do it anyway.”
Seriously, how dare he? Probably sensing it was for his own good, Gabe backed down, raising his hands in a defensive gesture.
Not for the first time, he found the man’s eyes on him and the intense gaze made him swallow hard and let him hasten his steps. It also had his heartbeat quicken. What was happening with him? He had a soulmate, for God’s sake.
As if in a horrible déjà vu, he saw the tears well up in Cas’ eyes, just before the man bowed his head, turned around, and ran.
Dean’s eyes went wide. Cas had a partner? With all his thoughts about his own confused feelings, the thought of Cas maybe being taken had never even crossed his mind.
He had no idea how long he stood there, rooted to the end of the hallway that opened into the living room and the kitchen area. Rooted there and just looking around dumbfounded. There really was no one here.
Reaching out from under the warm covers, he let his hand wander over the bed to grab Cas and pull him close again… only to reach into emptiness.
Without another word, he turned Cherry back around, kicking her into a slow canter, knowing it would be the smoothest of her faster gaits. Walking would be too slow, a trot too uneven for Cas’ dislocated shoulder, and a gallop was out of the question with two of them on her back. It didn't take him long to notice that Cas was struggling to hold on tight. His left hand was useless after all and no matter how much Dean tried to support him, there was only so much he could do.
How he had made it back home in time to get Gracie and himself to school, Dean had no idea. Just as he couldn’t remember how he had made it through the day without going insane. His mind constantly jumped between his worry over Cas, mulling over his newfound revelations, and replaying every moment of contact between them. Especially that last moment, when Dean had helped Cas off Cherry, their bodies moving close together for barely a few heartbeats.
He was sure he was in for some stern words – when his girl surprised him. Instead of giving him a lecture, Gracie moved over to the bed and crawled up on it, right into his arms. Dean didn’t hesitate but quickly pulled her into an embrace, holding her close.
“Hey,” he breathed out, his eyes flicking around the various faces that were turned towards him. He didn’t even try to read their expressions. All he needed was to see the man currently leaning over a suitcase on his bed, already packed to the brim, making Dean’s heart even heavier. “Can I talk to Cas for a sec?”
Back in the kitchen, he prepared himself a cup of tea. Waiting for the water to boil, he watched the numbers on the microwave slowly ticking towards five-twenty in the morning and just a few minutes later, he found himself outside on the porch swing, dressed in his warmest pajamas and a pullover, covered by two blankets, and sipping away on his tea.
Dean waited but there was no immediate reply, so he went back to work, bending over the open hood of the Volvo he was currently tending to. After he had turned sixteen, he’d started working for Bobby here and there; but for a year now, his job in the garage was full time – and still, there was no job Dean could think of that he would love more than this. He still silently thanked C every day for giving him the push he had needed to follow this dream.
Dean had to chuckle at that, moaning softly as Cas began to nip and suck and lick along his collarbone and up to his neck. “Oh yeah, because making pancakes takes up such a huge amount of time.”
The words stung in his chest but he refused to let it sit and fester. Instead, he moved to his daughter and sat next to her on the bed. Immediately, she crawled up to him and curled into his side.
But Dean didn’t have long to think about it, as he spotted Lydia and Emma within the crowd of newcomers. They had apparently already spotted him, as Emma ran over to greet him with a hug.
Speaking of kids, in yet another attempt to lighten the mood, Dean pushed Gracie in front of him, as if using her as a shield. He knew just how much his daughter had all the Shurleys wrapped around her finger. Surely, Gabe and Cas would forgive at least
A love that since then had turned into hate for how he had hurt him, how he had treated him. A hate that had probably deepened over the past decade or so. A hate that certainly explained the coldness Cas had shown towards him when they had met again.
Dean was unable to do much of anything really. Only able to grip Cas’ waist so damn tight, needing the hold, needing an anchor. He was hardly able to breathe, knowing he was already way too fucking close. His stamina was usually better than this but
“But that’s not even all. I mean… the fact that we’re even allowed to still meet here?” He made a wide gesture around campus where Charlie and he currently occupied a table, far away from everyone else, sharing lunch while Dean studied for his classes and Charlie used the free wifi to work on her codes for one of her programming jobs. “It’s all so…”
Letting go of Cas’ waist, Dean wound his arms around Cas’ shoulders and his back. He needed more, he needed him closer, he needed his lips. Pulling him into a deep kiss, Dean didn’t care that it was filthy and hardly a kiss, more like panting against each other while they both rutted into Cas’ hand and fuck, that was a feeling Dean wanted to feel every day, every hour, every minute. He wanted Cas like this, with him, for the rest of their lives.
“Well, of course I’ll always be here to listen and to help you. But… Gracie, your dad might be getting old, but not daft.”
He completely blanked out on the conversation going on between Eileen and Cas, only pulled back to the present when Cas’ laughter rang through the foyer, intensifying the turmoil in Dean’s stomach by tenfold. After grinning at Sam – and God, did Dean want this grin to be directed at him – Cas left the room with Eileen on his arm.
He had to put his hand on Cas' shoulder - the good one, of course - because if he didn’t, he would have wiped away those tears that had welled up in Cas’ eyes. And he was fairly certain that that would have been a tad too invasive.
In the background, Dean saw his daughter finally move towards Michael, the last of the Shurleys. Eileen must have seen it as well, knowing that this meant Gracie would be done soon. “I’m looking forward to talking some more with you while you’re here,” she told Cas and Dean was pleased to see that Cas seemed honestly thrilled at the prospect.
He really had no patience for Lydia today and if Emma was close enough to call out for him that meant her mother wasn’t far. For just a fraction of a second, he thought about ignoring the girl – only to instantly feel guilty about that.
“Mr. Winchester,” he heard the reply and was pretty sure Cas was nodding at him in acknowledgment. Then he was gone, once again not giving Dean the slightest chance to reply, let alone start a real conversation.
As Cas pulled him in for another kiss, Dean decided that any further discussion could wait until later.
There was so much cheek in those words alone, along with her grin, that Dean knew he really should reprimand her.
Reaching for the remote, he muted the movie and sat up straight, watching as his daughter pulled something out of the pocket of her sweater. It looked like wrinkled pages and when she unfolded them, Dean noticed the coloring and pattern right away.
Watching Gracie chat happily with her grandparents now, he couldn’t help thinking about how close she had grown with Cas. Even though it had been such a short time, Dean was sure it was even closer than she was with Michael and maybe even Sam. Or maybe it was just another kind of closeness.
Before they could all pile into Sam’s car, Dean was struck by a flash of genius and dashed back into his office where he grabbed the envelope from its place on the shelf.
There was a long moment of silence, Claire looking around the classroom. Dean could see and feel the barely suppressed excitement. Man, if his students were as excited about Vonnegut and Shakespeare as they were about gossip and his private life, it would make his job
The silence that fell between them was unbearable for Dean but he couldn't find any words at all. Yes, he had loved Lisa. Yes, he had stayed with her because he loved her - but also because it was the right thing to do. He had loved her… but the more he stared at Cas at this moment, the more he saw into these blue eyes… he wondered if maybe there were different kinds of love. Well, obviously there were when it came to friends and family and lovers. But… were there also different kinds of love when it came to love interests?
The coldness between them thickened and Dean knew he was suffocating in it. But it did nothing to cool down the anger rising within him.
Gracie’s giggles mingled perfectly with the rumble of Cas’ voice, the noises forming a melody that chased away the heaviness before it took root in Dean’s chest, the dark memory becoming nothing more than exactly that. A memory.
A door down the hallway opened and Dean’s eyes went wide, a pleading look directed at his friends. They both nodded just before Gracie entered the room. Contrary to any regular Saturday, she was wide awake. “
A second later, they tumbled onto the mattress, Cas on top of Dean who had anticipated the fall and caught himself and Cas just enough so they wouldn’t get hurt. Chuckling, their lips found each other again right away, and their kisses grew in eagerness and passion and fire when they resumed. But between it all, they still stayed tender, perfect.
. I know it sounds crazy, but believe me, I’ve done my research.” Not that he had to do much more after the same had happened to Jo a few years back. And if watching porn to see if he was into other men also counted as research as well, then… well, yes, he had done his research. “There are actually many people who identify as straight or gay but then that one person comes along and suddenly gender doesn’t matter anymore.”
Huddled up like that under the blanket, they ate their breakfast, Dean feeding Cas and Cas using the time to let his hand wander all over Dean’s body. Eliciting soft moans from him. Dean couldn’t get rid of the plate fast enough, all but stuffing the last piece into his mouth so he finally had his hands free as well. The moment the plate left his hand, Dean pushed Cas back onto the deckchair, letting his hands wander and roam and caress.
“Exactly,” Cas agreed as if he hadn’t heard Dean’s sarcasm. “Way too long. All that time that I could spend kissing you instead of you cooking.”
“What? No. It’s not...” he began, apparently searching for words. “I just didn’t pay attention this morning, is all. So the sudden light distracted me. It had nothing to do with you.”
After enjoying their breakfast together, Sam and Eileen also stayed for Charlie and Jo’s weekly call.
Anger at himself for not listening to his gut; anger at Cas for leading him on; anger at this stupid situation; anger at the past and the present and the future and at anything and everything.
Gracie nodded into his chest before letting go, her eyes immediately back on the short letter as she turned around and marched back to her room. It wasn’t until they heard her door click shut that Luke turned around to Dean.
When Cas first spoke, Dean was amazed at how unaffected he seemed by all this. Then, however, Dean looked at the man.
It was only one of many reasons why Gracie loved Cas’ books so much. In his books, girls were never weak. They were human, yes – but they weren’t helpless damsels just sitting around, waiting to be saved.
Trying not to think the worst, Dean remained in the living room for a few minutes longer, trying not to make it obvious he was following Cas. When he was sure enough time had passed, he left the living room through the other entrance, took a little detour but ultimately made his way to where he assumed Cas to be. Sure to find him in the kitchen Dean checked there first, then on the porch. As he found both empty, his heart sank and a dreadful sense of déjà vu settled in his stomach. He half expected Michael to show up any second now, looming around so Dean would stop stalking his brother…
Once Dean drew closer to the back porch, he became aware of Cas’ voice. It sounded like he was talking to someone, but no answer followed. Which either meant Cas was having conversations with himself or he was on the phone. With the full intention of making himself known, Dean stepped into the open doorway. The first words he made out, though, threw him off guard.
Dean was not really doing anything. Some student papers lay in front of him and theoretically, he was grading them - but tomorrow was the last day of school and no student wanted their papers back before the holidays anyway. So really, Dean was much more occupied watching the scene in front of him.
Dean held his breath, prepared for Cas to run again, but thankfully, this time, he continued to talk.
Soon after, Bobby told them it was time for an old man to go to bed. Since the storm was still going strong – maybe even worse than before – he also offered Dr. Richardson the guest room to which she gratefully accepted. It wasn’t the first time – and more than likely wouldn’t be the last – a late night emergency call kept her stranded at one of the ranches surrounding Stars Hollow.
“It will all be alright,” he had told him – like an all-knowing God who had already seen how this story would end. “You’ll see, Dean. Just have a little faith.”
“I wanted to go after you. I wanted to talk to you. I should have,” he added, rubbing a hand over his face to clear his head. “But… I thought I had time. I thought I could do it later. I just – I didn’t want to ruin Lisa’s big day. And then… you were just
“Hey, we will be gentle, promise,” Charlie replied with a wide grin that had both Dean and Jo chuckling.
At least, that was the definition he had always gone by. And seeing how other men still held no interest for him, right now it felt the safest to stick to it. There would be time in the future to fully dive into the discussion of what to label his sexuality – if he so desired – but this was not that time.
“Since you think it’s fine to do it in class, I guess it will also be okay for you to have me read this out loud?”
Yeah, there were some things that simply would not happen – and his baby getting behind a wheel at the way too young age of sixteen was one of them. Not when there were idiot drivers out there and drunk drivers and asshole drivers and simply…
that got her to at least calm down and behave again. It also got her pouting at him, but he was used to that. Hating himself for doing this, he took the book she was currently reading and left her room.
Dean smiled at Gracie, and after checking the stage to make sure everything was set he hopped down and went over to the group of giggling girls.
Even though Cas hadn’t finished the school year at Stars Hollow High, Dean had made sure his picture would still be included – it just wouldn’t have been fair to shove him aside as if he’d never been part of the school and this grade.
Before he could continue, Gracie had made her way around the car and was coming up next to him. “But, Dad. Our snowman. We wanted –”
The picture of her hugging Chuck and their little talk about Gracie’s performance distracted Dean long enough to only realize the magnitude of this moment when he saw Michael and the other Shurley siblings. They waved in hello, but hardly took their eyes off a man that stood right in front of Dean, his back turned towards him. Dean knew who it was without asking, without even having to see his face, and right away, the deafening silence around them registered with Dean, making him stop in his tracks. His heart was speeding up again, without him fully understanding why.
Lydia only answered with an awkward smile, no more words left as Cas moved passed her. Without hesitation, Dean took the proffered drink, his gaze following Cas as he handed the second mug to Gabe, who handed it over to Michael. Gracie was carrying the non-alcoholic drinks for Anna, Rebecca, and herself.
Well, Cas had told him, hadn’t he? Explained that what Dean had done to him ruined a once beloved family legend. How it turned into such a bad memory he wasn’t even able to eat those cookies anymore without thinking of that terrible moment.
thought that had been a good idea. How he had thought silencing the last shred of reason screaming inside of him would be a
Of course he knew it to be a utopian wish… but still, to underline his words, he sent a threatening glare around the room in general.
He cleared his throat, aware that he had been silent for too long. “Uh, yeah. Sorry. Ehm, Sammy took a picture of them… I can, uh... I can show you tomorrow, it’s on my phone but it’s charging at the moment. Anyway, uh, yeah between that, hanging out at
“Not a word to Grace about this,” he hissed towards the laptop. “And actually, this conversation is over.”
“Technically, it’s not your decision to make,” Cas had the audacity to throw in, pissing Dean of for real.
Which was probably why it didn't take much begging from Grace for Dean to go and check on Cas. He needed to make sure that Cas was alright himself and he needed for this stuff between them to be sorted. So while Gracie was still working on her homework, he drove over to the Shurley mansion.
“But Babette, don’t you think he would hide? Poor boy. Keeps getting into these awkward situations.”
Since he didn’t have a salvage yard around here, he decided on the second best thing and he drove until he found himself at the school’s parking lot, quickly leaving the car and marching over to his classroom. Inside, it was eerily silent. It was late morning by now, and outside he could hear the people already mingling around the streets of Stars Hollow again. But inside the school’s building, he was a lone soul, of course, given the damn fact that it was
Cas was beautiful, there was no denying that. And it wasn’t even the first time Dean realized it. He’d known it all these years ago as well. Had always thought of Cas that way, even while still a pit pudgy, wearing nerdy sweaters.
came Sam’s reply and Dean knew right away that his brother was forcing himself to stay calm and not yell into the phone.
Dating her had been nice and the time together certainly hot and passionate – but that was about it. And it wasn’t all that Dean wanted.
Growling, Dean pulled Cas in for a quick kiss, just to wipe that smirk off his lips. It was harder than he thought, given how Cas would hardly stop chuckling.
Dean couldn’t think of anything in this world that would feel better than this right here. The two of them, finally in each other’s arms.
When his laptop rang, indicating the incoming skype call, he took one last breath and then sat down on his couch.
At least, he had his family around this time. Sam and Eileen had, once again, decided to spend the night at Bobby’s. Their excuse had been the weather but really, Dean was sure it was actually for his benefit. He could tell they wanted to be close in case he needed them.
“Yes, you do,” Dean insisted, just so keeping himself from strengthening his hold. He didn’t want Cas to run but he didn’t want to keep him against his will either. Or, God forbid, hurt him in the process. So instead, he used the moments they had to speak his mind. “And you’re constantly finding a way to avoid me. You even stopped running in the mornings just to do so,” he added, his words filled with sadness as he admitted to himself just how true his words were and how much the truth hurt.
Sighing deeply, Dean gathered all the papers and put them back in the yearbook. After one last glance at the old picture of Cas, Dean shut the book but didn’t bother putting it away. Somehow, he had the feeling he would be looking at it a few more times over the next few weeks.
“Shit,” he said, not able to hide all of the panic boiling under his skin. But he needed to stay calm, needed to save Cas. Needed to find a way.
Cas deserved to hear those three words from him in broad daylight and with total abandon. No heavy emotional talk leading up to it, no drama, no stipulations. Instead, nothing but joy and contentment.
As always, seeing his friends on the screen warmed Dean’s heart. He missed these two more than he would ever tell them. Thankfully, it wouldn’t be much longer until he would see them again in person. Just a little over a week. They would be back in no time…
Before they could go on, the door flew open and a whirlwind came rushing in. So much for a snowball fight. It seemed his daughter had other plans for her Sunday afternoon. Sam stepped into the house shortly after, giving them an apologetic smile, and followed Grace into the kitchen where she was starting on some hot chocolate.
His mom and dad hadn’t been thrilled all that much about that perspective – but C had told him to go for it if that’s where his heart was.
“Tell us about him. How did he become so close to Gracie?” Alice asked - and again, no malice to be detected.
Right now, he was sitting on campus as well, enjoying some lunch while reading a good book, and Dean’s eyes had wandered towards him more often than he cared to admit. Damnit!
Next to him, Cas nodded and even leaned in just a bit. As he whispered back, Dean had to concentrate on what he was telling him instead of getting distracted by the proximity or Cas’ warm breath.
Thinking about it for a second, Dean’s eyes grew wide at the realization. Cas’ loud laugh told him that he saw the moment Dean made the connection. Dropping his head in his other hand, Dean chuckled along before mumbling. “Well, now you see it for yourself. Your soulmate
This was his soulmate, and he couldn’t believe he was so lucky to finally have this and never have to give it up again.
Dean looked at him, trying to understand what he was playing at. “Why would it bother me? Other than the fact that it was my wedding, of course.”
Dean was still in the process of figuring out his confusing feelings when he saw Cas leave the room. He waited for him to come back, but it never happened. It became hard to follow his conversation with Gabriel and Crowley, Anna’s husband, about … yeah, well, he actually had no idea what it was about, not having paid attention at all, even when Cas had still been in the room.
When Sam didn’t continue to speak, Dean rolled his eyes, knowing his brother was waiting for him to break and share all his feelings or some shit. Yeah, as if that was ever going to happen.
Instead, he focused on his daughter in a desperate attempt to get a grip back on the moment. Seeing how she had already begun to read the draft, he closed the small gap between them and brushed a hand over her hair.
So with great effort, he shook his head. “Naw, man, it’s– it’s alright. I’ll just…” he pointed over his shoulder and already stepped back – when he remembered something. “I mean, could you maybe just– could you give him this?” he asked, hastily pulling the envelope from the side pocket of his duffle, holding it out for the man to take. “It’s uhm… it’s one of his Christmas presents. He– he dropped them, so… yeah. Could you do that?”
As usual, that only got him an eye roll out of Charlie. “Yeah, and so does about ninety-eight percent of the world population. Doesn’t mean you can’t fall for someone else.”
“Are you... are you mad at Michael for giving us the family recipe?” That really, truly couldn’t be it, but Dean needed to believe it was something harmless such as that. “Or at Gracie and me for having it? Because if that’s the case, let me tell you that Gracie certainly isn’t at fault –”
A quick kiss was planted onto his cheek and before he could react, Gracie let herself fall back onto her bed, using the bounce to get the covers loose and bury under them.
“Hey, hey,” Dean stopped him as he tried to turn around again. “Cas, stop. What the hell is going on?” he asked again, able to glimpse a closer look at his face at last.
This might be his first time with a man, but it surely wasn’t Dean’s first sexual experience and he knew what it felt like to drive his partner closer and closer to the edge. Knew by the way Cas’ breathing hitched, by the way his hold around him tightened, his babbling becoming less and less sensical. Cas was so damn close and so was Dean and the moment he knew Cas was there with him, he let himself tumble over the edge with one last, hard thrust. As much as he wanted to hear Cas’ scream, his desire to feel those lips again was stronger and he sealed their lips together, catching Cas’ scream and holding him tight as he trembled in his arms.
But he also needed to figure out if all this even mattered. Because really, would it make sense to finally have it all sorted out when Cas was so obviously not comfortable in his presence anymore and had a very, very possible boyfriend back in New York?
Air. He needed air and it wasn’t until he was outside that he could feel it fill his lungs again. It was dirty and filled with smoke and exhaust fumes and someone was smoking somewhere nearby and the noises around him were all-consuming and he needed the fresh air from the ranch, he needed to be back in Stars Hollow, he needed the peace and the quiet.
Flinching, Dean nodded and tried not to let it get to him how he’d just spent the drive to school thinking about a sex dream while his daughter had been in the car.
Once a month on Friday, it was poker night for the Winchester family and their friends. With Charlie and Jo on vacation and Michael and Chuck busy with their visiting family, it was just Bobby, Sam, Eileen, Gracie, and Dean tonight. A small circle, but it was still nice. Although no one cared all that much for poker anyway - it was more about catching up and spending time with the family.
When Cas had handed him back his scarf he had protested, of course. But since Cas had seemed uneasy with keeping it, he had taken it anyway.
“Man, I just love this movie,” Dean couldn’t help but whisper as they watched George Bailey find his daughter’s petals in his pocket, laughing in joy.
The words had been such a source of strength for him ever since C had written them. Brushing his thumb over his left forearm, Dean thought of all that they had shared in the past few months. How could one long for a person so much when they hadn’t even ever met them yet?
Helplessly, he made a sideways gesture towards all the papers on the table. Cas followed that gesture and let his eyes wander over all his work. For a short moment, Dean wished - more than anything - for Cas to invite him to stay.
“I think we have a lot to talk about,” he murmured, hoping that soon, he would be able to take all insecurity away from Cas. He didn’t like seeing it there but he understood and he would make sure to slowly free him of it, one day at a time.
The main floor held everything, from a library to a huge kitchen and a wide living room. Dean remembered Bobby grumbling once - one night when he’d had a couple of extra whiskeys -  about how much he had wished for the spacious main house to have a better purpose than housing an old grump like him.
“Hey, Daddy,” Gracie greeted, helping him to snap his attention away from Cas. “Castiel was so kind to let me sit with him. The diner was packed earlier because of the snow.”
They didn’t get far though, their stomachs soon rumbling, reminding them that they both had barely eaten anything yesterday aside from their pizzas. Trying to ignore it for a little while, they soon couldn’t help but chuckle every time it happened, finally deciding to eat first and then get back to bed right away.
For now, he continued to kiss Cas’ jaw and neck, giving Cas a moment to just enjoy the feeling. Giving
.” Cas’ voice rang through the clear morning air, even faintly echoing, his words rendering Dean speechless. “And I still am. Do you have any idea how painful it is to be back in this town? To
With the man so exquisitely presented to him, Dean took his damn sweet time removing the tie and then kissing all along that ravishing neck. He busied his fingers with the buttons of Cas’ dress shirt – so many fucking buttons, damnit – never rushing any of his movements. There was no need. Yes, they were both tired, yes, they were both eager. But by God, they had waited long enough for this moment, so they could very fucking well enjoy it. Draw it out, prolong it, savor it.
Sitting down, he opened the book and browsed through the pages, stopping here and there, smiling at the memories. His search ended when the book fell open at the section with the portraits, a handful of papers pressed between the pages. Putting them aside for the moment, Dean looked closer at one portrait in particular.
“Yeah, whatever.” Ignoring Taylor, Dean pulled Gracie along with him towards the entrance. School was starting soon, and he didn’t want either of them to be late. Right before they would have to separate, Dean hugged his daughter close once more. “I’m really sorry.”
Dean waited for Gracie to be occupied with her dessert before he pulled Cas a bit closer, bringing his lips close to his ear so he could whisper, “You told Meg, didn’t you?”
Michael, on the other hand, leveled him with a stern gaze that Dean was sure was usually reserved for the courtroom.
Dean’s heart sank and he was unable to stop his mind from going to the worst possibilities right away. After all, if a soulmate died before they had ever met, the other one would never know. He couldn’t believe that he had been with someone else for two weeks while something had been wrong with his real soulmate!
Sunday dinners at the Shurleys was always a loud affair – but today had to top every one before and Dean simply enjoyed it, soaking up the laughter and joy, the atmosphere of warmth and family and love. He laughed with Michael about Gabriel’s antics as the younger Shurley brother trekked around the house, playing hide and seek with the kids; he spent some quality time helping decorate the tree together with everybody else; he joined Sam when his brother went to bring in their presents once the tree was deemed complete.
There will be a bit of Portuguese in this chapter - translations are added as "hover overs" and in the end note in case it's not working.
maybe - that it was just a crush. That he would get over it. I didn’t want to lose his friendship over that. Or see him hurt. So I… I…”
The fact that he hadn’t even bothered to greet Dean was like a bucket of ice water over the budding hope of maybe amending his mistakes tonight.
Okay, maybe not completely straight forward. Somehow, Dean really hoped that Cas would get what he wanted to tell him without Dean actually having to say it.
Zooming in on Cas, he couldn’t help but stare at him for a while longer, his eyes roaming over Cas’ smiling features. On the spur of a moment, Dean saved the picture as his new background, locked the screen, and put the phone away.
As he looked into the eyes of his students, two feelings warred inside of Dean: shock and anger. He did his utmost to keep his cool, to appear as if this wasn’t shaking him to the core. But he had never suspected that all this could become such a huge issue again.
On the other hand, maybe Dean was just reading too much into this. Which was probably stupid. He blamed Gracie for his paranoia.
“Fuck,” he groaned, quickly reaching for Cas’ hands to warm them with his own. “They’re ice-cold,” he continued in a scolding voice. Seriously, Cas clearly had no self-preservation instincts. “What the heck were you thinking, running out into the cold like this?”
“Me too,” Cas said, still on the phone. “Hey, Zar. Can I call you later? It’s dinner time soon and I wanna wrap this up here.”
With that, Dean slipped through the door and hastily made his way to his car, leaving Cas behind him, wishing that they wouldn’t have to interact with each other very often for the next few weeks.
– whatever the hell that meant. He’d tried to suppress his feelings for over a week now and it had let him nowhere.
“Alright,” he finally agreed, but ignored Gracie’s triumphant, “yes,” to add, “but if anything scares you or you don’t feel well, you call me and I’ll pick you up, got it?”
“Hey, man, I'm always here for you to talk to, you know that, right? No matter if you need to rant or if you need advice. I’ll listen. Anytime.”
It was just after half past five in the morning by the time Dean gave up. Somewhere along the night, his memories of Cas had turned into dreams, letting him relive various states of their friendship. While some of them – most of them, actually – were great and made him smile, giving him a content feeling in his sleep, there was the occasional one that made him toss and turn, waking him up every so often. For about half an hour, he’d tried to fall back asleep after an especially unpleasant memory. Or did that count as a nightmare? It certainly had been more than awkward when a wide-eyed young Cas had caught him with some random chick behind the bleachers. Weird, he didn’t even remember her name, but he certainly remembered how red in the face the eight-year-old boy had gotten before turning around and running away. Dean had been sixteen back then and the girl certainly hadn’t been the first. But it had been the first time he’d stopped and told her they would continue this later. He’d gone after Cas, but the boy was already gone and by the time he saw him next, there was always someone else with them so Dean had felt weird about bringing it up. Somehow, it had just petered out.
There was no reaction at first, giving Dean enough time to memorize every inch of Cas’ face. The winter sun played in his dark curls.
Now he really needed a second to calm himself or he would go into full-on panic mode and that would neither help Cas nor the situation nor anyone at all.
to understand this. His thoughts were rushing around his head, trying to come up with an explanation.
Trying not to think about the morbid answer all of the adults knew to be true - that Chuck’s funeral would surely bring Cas back one more time - Dean shrugged his shoulders.
And damn if those words weren’t true. This ride was going to be hell on Dean’s composure. He was pulled out of his thoughts when Cas shivered in his arms.
Dean scoffed at that, for once too tired and emotionally drained to keep pretending at playing nice. “We both know people here gossip all the time. I don’t give a damn about what they say about me. But if it starts hurting those I love–”
“Yeah, true,” Dean admitted, letting his thoughts wander back to more recent times as he curled further into Cas’ space. Maybe to seek his warmth, maybe to chase away the pain that came with those memories. Those first few days after they had met again. “But only because I knew you were using it to keep a firm wall between us.”
“Dean,” he heard Cas try to stop him once more but Dean was on a roll, something inside of him pushing him on, knowing this was his only chance.
“Dad, guess what! Kirk is offering sleigh rides,” she told him before he could even begin to answer. “Can Cas and I go, please? Just one round. Can we? It will be so much fun.”
He was starting on his fifth baggie when Gracie appeared next to Dean again, once more hugging him close.
Once or twice, Dean found Cas looking right back at him but he always averted his gaze the moment Dean caught him looking. The almost physical pain in his stomach intensified every single time, making Dean almost sick with this confusing rollercoaster of his feelings. He lost count of how many times he asked himself
Chuck Shurley surely was the grandfather Gracie would have never had in John Winchester, which was why Dean was even more grateful for Michael’s father basically adopting them after Gracie had lost her mom. It stood to reason that he’d mostly adopted Dean to help him get over the loss of his wife four years ago, but either way, Gracie was now part of the Shurley clan in almost every way imaginable.
Here was Dean’s chance to talk with Cas some more instead of just standing around stupidly. His daughter was still busy talking to Michael, so Dean frantically searched for something to say.
“Because… I- I think I just…” Taking a deep breath, Gracie pushed out of his embrace and sat up, turning to look straight at him. “I want you to know that I really meant it. What I said, yesterday. I want you to know I’m not just saying it because I like Cas. But because I think you two could be happy together.”
Instead of a verbal reply, Dean had to wait only a few seconds – until suddenly, he could feel his skin tingle in other places than his usual left arm. It started on his shoulder and right away, Dean realized what C was doing. One after another, rainbow flags of all sizes appeared all over his body, vanishing as soon as he saw them, making room for more, for bigger and brighter ones.
“A pie,” Cas replied, grinning at him - a grin that warmed him and spurred those butterflies back into action. With his newfound revelations, Dean was ashamed to admit those butterflies had been there years ago as well, only he hadn’t acknowledged them back then. He was so thrown by that, it took him a moment to catch the rest of Cas’ words. “We thought it would be nice to share some of our winnings with you.”
“I mean… yeah? I guess?” Cas replied carefully, letting his fingers wander over the naked skin of Dean’s chest. He wouldn’t quite look Dean in the eye, so Dean put a finger under Cas’ chin, carefully lifting until their gazes met. Not wanting to push, Dean waited for Cas to find his words. “I mean… now that we’re official I really don’t want this to be a long-distance thing. I– I want to be with you.”
Cas grasped his dick and held it in place as he slowly sank down, taking it inch by inch and Dean was sure he was seeing stars. He couldn’t breathe at first, it felt so damn good; their mutual moans filled the room and Dean let his mind float as Cas’ name fell from his lips, again and again. His body was on fire and yet he was sure he was shivering, not from the cold but from the anticipation. He felt like a teenager again, having sex for the first time – and maybe it was even true, in some ways.
Wiping away the tiredness from his face, Dean blindly reached for the pen he had left lying next to his pillow.
There were some more shushing noises from different directions and Dean was fucking beaming when that didn’t dampen Cas’ little snicker. Nor did it keep him from continuing.
Michael offered to help and even though Dean had a foreshadowing feeling about it, he couldn’t really say no, seeing how there were way too many drinks to be carried. His gut feeling had been right, however. They’d hardly left their group when Michael started talking.
They had reached the ranch and Dean had switched off the engine by the time Gracie formulated her answer.
“Breathe, Dean,” Eileen told him, grinning. “It’s just a little bit. Don’t you wanna tell her how gorgeous she looks?”
Thank you again for sticking with me on this journey, and I hope to see you soon… because, you know…
even mattered in the whole soulmate business, of course. There was no guarantee they would ever even meet or get together in that regard.
Cas didn’t reply, not right away. Instead, Dean watched as he looked at the letter again and Dean was sure that only now, he really focused on what he held in his hand. The movement of his eyes was slower, more focused on every single line, instead of flicking around to understand what Dean had gifted him. Watching him so closely, it was easy for Dean to see the moment Cas’ eyes began to well up, if only a little bit. Not enough to actually cry but enough to show Dean just how touched he was.
“Be right back,” he promised and then rushed to the bathroom to first get himself cleaned up and then wet a towel with warm water.
Switching off the lights on his way out, Dean made his way over to his bedroom. Kissing his fingers, he pressed them to one of the framed pictures on the bedside stand. “Good night, Lis,” he whispered, sitting down on the bed and switching off his own lights as well. “Wherever you are.”
Equipped with blankets and lunch packs, they soon joined a big group of Shurleys who were already there, the little kids excited for the movies to start. Parts of the family had made it early enough to the square to not only secure themselves a good spot but to reserve some for the rest of the big family as well as some friends, who all would drift in and out for the different movies.
Relief washed over him and only now did Dean realize he had not only dreaded his daughter’s reaction because he knew she would be hurt – but also because he had feared that she would blame
Cas obviously wasn’t interested in what he had to say anyway or else he would have interrupted his rambling already.
A smile spread across his face at those words. Sure, he didn’t know what this meant, still didn’t know anything about D’s gender or sexuality. But it sounded like there was something about them that their parents hadn’t approved of and now they were finally breaking free. Picking up his pen, he wrote back a note before joining his friends again.
But thanks to the nice warmth blanketing them, he let himself enjoy the view, his gaze following his hand as it roamed over Cas’ skin.
Once again, he did not need to. Cas did not seem interested in his input anyway, as he took a further step away from him, interrupting whatever attempt of speaking Dean had.
It seemed to have the desired effect, pulling Cas from whatever spell he had been under, waking him out of his stupor. Still, he looked rather ashen as he reached for the Angel Cookie and Dean’s eyes narrowed.
Cas was silent for a brief while. Long enough for Dean to open his eyes again, noticing that Cas had his eyes closed as well.
whole issue. He still didn’t like to remember the time when Lydia had pursued him for real and he had to find a way to let her down easy. Perhaps he hadn’t done it well enough.
As if on autopilot, he rushed forward, meeting his baby in the middle of the living room where she threw herself into his arms, letting her tears run.
Leaning back against the couch, Dean gave himself a minute to sort his thoughts and mostly his feelings.
It was getting colder yet, the smell of fresh snow cleansed his thoughts, setting his mind at peace for a while. He didn’t think about what he could do or what he would say once he saw Cas again. Somehow, he had faith that things would work out as they needed to.
he replied without even thinking. He knew it was his usual defense mechanism, but he felt cornered and he hated it.
back on board and willing to sail this ship. With any luck, Cas was done talking. Dean certainly was and he sneaked a hand under Cas’ body, gripping his hip, pulling him closer again. He wanted to get back to where they had been before all the talking had started. Wanted to get naked, wanted to sink into the wonderful bliss that was sex.
Gracie skipped into his office and threw her arms around his neck, resting her chin on his shoulder as she looked down on his desk.
“Yeah,” Cas agreed, a grin flicking over his face. “I guess Michael would have killed you had you made a move while I was fourteen and you were twenty-three.”
His whole demeanor showed the same, especially when a humorless laugh left him in a huff. He shrugged his shoulders and raised his hands in a helpless gesture before dropping them again. He looked so lost Dean had to literally ball his hands into fists so not to reach for him. To give him space, lest he scare him into running again.
He didn’t even realize when he finished his coffee, only coming back to reality when Gracie packed up her stuff. Were they ready to leave? Already?
It seemed no matter what he did, Cas got hurt, be it at Dean’s own hand or because of their past and some gossiping harpies Dean wasn’t able to protect him from. His heart hurt just remembering those tears and how every nerve in his body had wanted to run after Cas. Hold him, wipe away those tears and all the pain. Or allow him to punch him, whatever helped most.
“If you don’t get this fixed, I will deny ever handing you his address, understood?” When Dean nodded and took the paper, she continued. “Good. Now, be quick. The helicopter should be at Hartford-Brainard airport by eleven.”
Michael’s comment had sounded so innocent, and looking back, Dean was pretty sure he’d been able to sound convincing when he’d thanked his friend and then played it all down. Actually, there hadn’t really been anything to play down. At that moment, it really had been alright.
“I... I’ve heard parts of your phone calls,” he finally admitted. “And his picture when he calls – I was suspicious this whole time and when you said your future was here in New York –”
Still gnawing on his lip, Dean thought about lying for a second – but this was his soulmate and the last thing Dean wanted to do was lie to them.
Not even trying to hide his cheeky grin, Dean right away replied. “Probably.” If only to keep this little game between them going. This game that, even though they had both forgotten for a little while, now held such a fond meaning for Dean.
they wanted to go. Was C a gay or bi man? Was C a bisexual woman? Were they pan or trans or ace or demi? Were they maybe an ally?
Dean had no idea what all she wrote to her mother, had never asked, never pried. And that was okay for him. This was between Gracie and her mom and he would never dare to invade that. His daughter knew she could tell him everything – so he trusted that she would if it was for him to know.
Quickly letting go with one of his arms, Dean took the phone. Well aware that he was certainly not in the right head-space to talk to Grace much longer. His voice already sounded rougher but he prayed that Grace wouldn’t notice enough to question it.
“Yeah, next year would have been my turn. I’d already forgotten about that,” he admitted, checking on the pasta.
As was to be expected, the morning went by in an easy-going manner. Maybe he was a bad teacher by openly admitting he had no desire to be doing anything productive either, regardless that their principal insisted they teach to the last minute. But the students in his classes were happy and that’s what was important, at least in his book. They played games and spoke about holiday plans, his senior class even using the time for last minute preparations for the cookie sale that would happen later today. But even with all this fun-time there was no denying everyone was glad to leave the building when the last bell of the day rang.
Dean was so startled by the sensation on his skin, he actually banged his head against the hood of the car he was currently working on. Quickly reaching for a pen, he scribbled back before the words in his mind even made sense.
“Yeah, well,” Dean said, trying not to let the words get to him - did Cas think badly of him now? Did it remind him of that day at the church, when he had essentially blown
But of course, that was not the only reason for him to play errand boy right now to fetch them from the kitchen. As he stepped through the kitchen door, a body collided with him.
. You deserve to find someone again. Letting someone into your heart again won’t mean that you forget about her.”
He heard Cas tinkering around, then the water running a few times, but it was all background noise. He was so, so close to simply drifting off…
Cas had never heard his confession, and Dean could no longer fool himself. He had said the words – but he hadn’t actually
But despite that, Dean couldn’t stop his mind from mostly being focused on the man sitting diagonally from him at the other end, his eyes wandering over every so often. What was it about Cas that confused him so much? And why wasn’t he able to solve this enigma?
” she greeted them, before giving her dad a kiss on his cheek and then snuggling up on the couch. “How is Spain?”
Putting his pen aside, he picked up his phone and scrolled to his conversation with his best friend (aside from his soulmate).
“May I guess, then?” he asked, not even trying to hide his amusement. “Given how you reacted, I would say it’s about me and my private life again. And I would guess, Saturday has something to do with it. How am I doing so far?”
Without any preamble, Gracie pulled Eileen to her room so they could get ready together. They wanted to show up at the Shurley’s around noon and apparently, that meant his daughter needed to start getting ready now, about one and a half hours before they needed to leave.
Are you ready to see what the boys were up to in New York while we weren't watching them in Angel Cookies? 😏 then tune back in tomorrow 😇
He would have never thought that hearing young Cas call him Mr. Winchester in return would hurt like a bitch.
Alice made a sad noise and Dean saw Harry squeeze her hand. Whenever they would visit, the two of them had come along for Sunday dinner and while they weren’t exactly close, some sort of friendship had formed between the three of them over the years.
angry with her about it, especially when he usually failed to keep his smile off his face. “Come on, the others are waiting already.”
He was by no means homophobic; the times that his father was able to control his thoughts that much were long gone. But still, these were his friends, and most of them were taken. All of them actually, except for Cas.
thank you all so much for your kind comments 😍 they always bring a smile to my face and brighten my day 😘
Inias looked confused when Dean showed up at their door, but still let him in and told him where to find Cas. Somehow, Dean was glad that Michael didn’t seem to be home yet.
When he opened his eyes again, it was to a closeup of one guy riding the other, no faces to be seen, just cocks, asses, and firm naked skin.
Finally reaching the bedroom, Dean gave in to his desire of fully feeling Cas in his arms once more, lifting him up to carefully crawl onto the bed with him. It was a wonderful sensation and only reluctantly did he lower him onto the bed, laying Cas out under him like the precious gift he was. For a moment, all he could do was stare into those ocean blue eyes that shone back at him with love and desire, illuminated by the lights of Manhattan shining through the window; making them sparkle all the more.
