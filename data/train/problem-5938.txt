Tony chuckled, leaning into Steve's side.
Steve was silent for a long time. Slowly, the happy feeling Tony had when he'd discovered what his feelings meant made way for dread, sinking like a brick to settle uncomfortably in his stomach. He'd only seen love between Jarvis and Ana, who loved each other dearly, and the people on the boats. He'd never even considered the fact that his love might not be reciprocated.
It was a sketch of a monkey on a unicycle, holding cymbals.
Tony reluctantly accepted that. The rest of the day, Steve made his homework and Tony, who wasn't allowed to do anything school-related, made a Sudoku. Or multiple. Eventually, Tony got bored.
The same three people came back the next day, Steve looking as excited as Tony felt at seeing him again. It wasn't long before he was in the car, resisting the urge to press his face against the window, fascinated by everything rushing by outside. His mouth fell open when he noticed the car had stopped.
"And you?" Tony asked, turning to Steve. "You didn't introduce yourself."
"I like him," Nat stated before turning around and taking a seat as the teacher entered.
"I wanted that one..." he whined.
"No, I don't. I'm not smart enough for that." He winked. "But don't worry. This is the first day, so this will be your last period. After that, everyone is going to their dorms and has the opportunity to make themselves at home there. Do you know where your dorm is?"
"Why do you hate it so much?" She asked. "When people call you dumb. Why do you hate it? You're the smartest person I've ever met. Why are you still so bothered by that lie?"
Ignore any grammar mistakes, still not originally English! c:
Tony felt his eyes droop, exhaustion pulling him back under. He barely registered a soft kiss on his messy curls before he drifted off.
May thought back to just moments ago, to the way the teen's face had lit up like the sun over a simple
Clint smirked.
in his ear, but he pushed it away. He didn't know what this was. It would likely pass with time.
"This is gonna be a long day."
He dropped from the vents into the hallway, knocking softly on Tony's door. He heard a soft mumble and Clint took that as an affirmative. The Archer pushed the door open softly, finding Tony in the same position he'd seen him in while he was lurking in the vents.
"You talk to him, Steve. You treat him the same. You of all people should know that crushes come and go. Maybe he just likes you because you've been so nice to him. It'll most likely pass given time. But you don't let him deal with it alone, alright?"
"I'll be just across the hall if you need me, or you can just ask FRIDAY," he told him. Oh, had he mentioned the amazing voice in the ceiling that ran the entire building and sounded like an actual person? Yeah, Tony made that. Apparently.
The boy's eyes lit up in recognition and pointed at himself. "Antonio, Tonio. Or... Tony," he said softly. Bucky grinned as he extended his hand.
"No funny," Tony grumbled before plopping down on a chair by the table.
It was a warm, sunny day when Steve, Tony, Clint, and Natasha decided to go to the park. It was their day off from training for the first time in a while, and they'd decided to make good use of it. Steve, Clint, and Nat were in a heated conversation about something Tony didn't bother to focus on as he just enjoyed their soothing presence. He smiled, reveling in the sunlight on his face and the feeling of Steve's hand in his.
something. Not just lie in bed all day. I'm not
Please, tell me what you thought in the comments, I'd really love to hear what you think!!
"Stark, I am your captain-"
"Thanks, Nat," he said.
"Um, okay," he started, and only years and years of perfection and practice kept him from breaking out laughing at the captain's red face. Peter, unfortunately, hadn't had that amount of practice yet, causing him to double over in laughter.
"Are- are you okay?"
"Why?" Peter asked.
"Hey, man," he said softly, sitting next to him. Tony didn't respond. "Oh, come here." Clint pulled the genius close, allowing him to rest his head on the blonde's shoulder. "Look, I know what happened back there was rough, but Steve doesn't mean it like that," Clint said after a moment of comfortable silence.
the one who made you cry! You- you should be angry, you should be yelling!
By the time he'd finished, he was back in tears, voice breaking and face hidden in Steve's shirt. Steve closed his eyes, burrowing his face in Tony's soft curls as he held him.
"Hey, Tony," Steve nudged him gently. "Hey, can you look at me?"
"Calm down?" He sneered. "
, Steve," he whispered brokenly, and Steve felt a wet spot forming on his shirt from Tony's tears. Tony never actually cried, getting defensive and snappy instead. So Steve knew Tony was really tired, and really sick if his emotions got the better of him so quickly. "I don't want to let them all down, you know? But no matter how hard I try, I just can't do it, Steve. I can't do it..." He broke off into soft sobs that had Steve's heart break and he quickly pulled the smaller man against him, holding him close.
be the most embarrassing moment of your childhood?" Clint scoffed.
"Why'd he take you?" Steve asked softly. He felt Tony's hand tighten its hold on his shirt.
"What?"
, right? Don't you just
Something like this wouldn't be caused by school bullies. Especially the scar on his chest. He remembered the Tony he'd met a few weeks ago; quiet, jumpy, shy-- or was he? Was it shyness... or fear? The way he curled into himself whenever someone's attention was on him or how he wouldn't speak unless spoken to. How he wouldn't ask for help even though he couldn't figure it out on his own.
"I know, but I think you wanted to look at them, maybe."
Tony nodded weakly, his head rolling against Steve's suit, listening to the strong heartbeat. It was pulling him down and he wanted nothing more than to just drift off. Before he could, however, he was pulled back to reality, the physically painful reality by someone shaking his shoulder.
"Really boring, I had absolutely nothing to do. Luckily, Aunt May called Mr. Stark and he told me I could come over! Cool, right?"
"Is he going to be okay?" Peter couldn't help but ask after he and Clint had exited the room. Clint didn't hesitate to smile reassuringly.
"These are American Pancakes. Very delicious, very unhealthy."
"You okay, Tony?" He asked in a gentle voice. Peter noticed and turned the music off, saving his and Tony's work and sitting on the workbench. "And don't say that you're 'fine', because you say that every time,"
"Hey, none of that," Steve stopped him immediately, his hand reaching out to touch the brunet's. "I get it, it's scary when there's something wrong with your dog. I get scared too, trust me."
"Oh! Uh- yeah. Yeah, sure," he stammered. "What seems to be the problem?"
"Alright. Yeah, I guess you're right," he agreed, a little awkwardly. He was reluctant to leave knowing Tony might be uncomfortable or unsafe in there, but there was nothing he could do without any proof. "Well, goodnight."
As much as Steve hated himself for what he'd done, he wouldn't dream of defying Natasha's demands. He wiped his face in a futile attempt to hide the fact that he'd been crying and opened the stall. Nat gave him a small smile.
"Explain," even Natasha looked amused.
?" He asked in fascination. Peter straight-up laughed in his face, and he hit him up the head. "Excuse me, you seem to have forgotten to mention the fact that I'm apparently a
"Please, put down," the small brunet said softly. Bruce put the plates on the counter. Immediately, Tony walked over and took the plates, walking back to the table to set them down. Bruce frowned at the sight in confusion.
"Well, we were never ones for subtle," Steve replied casually.
"Um... it taken," he stated. Bruce winked behind his glasses.
Peter try to stop the grin from breaking free, elation bubbling up in his chest. "Yeah, outsider buddies! You'll love it, we can do so many cool things! Have you ever built with Legos?"
Tony seemed so excited by the mere thought of petting a dog, Steve thought it was actually rather cute. He couldn't help a stupid smile from spreading over his face as he watched Tony light up completely. The way his eyes sparkled and his youthful face completely lit up. Those big, sparkling eyes turned to Steve, and Steve could feel his stomach flip-
"Uh, what?" Peter's expression turned even more confused before realization dawned. "Wait a minute... You're not English, are you? Oh, man. That's awesome! So, like, where are you from? Oh wait, you don't understand me now, do you?"
Happy sighed, running a hand down his face.
"Class, calm down, please. Take a seat," Hill ordered. Once everyone was seated again, she continued. "Everyone, this is Antonio, he's a foreign exchange student from Italy. As he is in your homeroom I expect you all to be especially nice to him and help him when he needs it, because he can't speak our language very well yet. Other teachers have been informed, but I need you all to help him adjust." She fixed them all with a stern glare before looking back at the shy kid behind her.
"And yesterday."
Ciao, Zia Peggy: hello, Aunt Peggy
"Mr. Stark is finally letting me work with him in the lab," he said, practically bouncing like a little child.
" Loki explained with a straight face. Tony giggled at Clint's affronted look before ducking back into Steve's side when that turned the attention to him.
"Sir, there is an alert of a troublemaker causing trouble in the city," FRIDAY alerted the three people standing in the kitchen. Tony sighed, putting down his coffee.
"Good," the assassin said suddenly, getting up and ruffling Peter's hair. "Now, while they talk that out, I suggest we do the
"Alright," Steve started, opening the box and revealing multiple old-fashioned games. They looked pretty worn out, so Tony guessed they were something Bucky and Steve were busy with when they weren't training. He took out a pile of old cards and put the box back on the ground. "This is a version of Never Have I Ever, only Buck and I changed it up a bit. If you have never done the thing that's mentioned, you're in the clear.
"So I could grill you out on that 'secret crush' of yours."
Tony had already sagged back, the grin wiped from his lips.
"No, the coffee machine is over there," he pointed to a corner. Dum-E made another noise before rolling away again. "That's right,"
"Having fun?" He asked, a smile on his lips.
. He screamed and kicked against the hands holding him down, panic overtaking every sensible part of him and drowning out every rational thought.
walk away from him. Do you realize how selfish you're being? That boy is hurting because you decided to throw his worst insecurity in his face. Do you even realize how much he admires you? Do you have
(Oh and for anyone wondering, I use he/they/she pronouns, any of those, i dont really care but using he/him makes me happy i've discovered. thanks babes :3)
Tony painfully turned on his back before allowing Steve to pull him into a sitting position, still cradling his broken wrist close to his aching chest. He bit his bottom lip and looked at Steve with tear-filled eyes.
Tony quietly opened the door to his own room, peeking inside. The room was like the living room- cozy but spacious. It was bare with just the basic necessities like a bed, sink, and a closet to hang his clothes. His bags were in the middle of the room.
He figured the boy would forget about it in the morning, and no one had to know.
Smiling to himself, he got set on Steve's schedule. Through the glass window, he made brief eye contact with Ana. She winked at him. He smiled. She was on board.
Tony turned around to face Peter, a casual smirk on his face and an eyebrow raised.
“Take your time, baby girl, we’re right here” she heard Tony’s voice next to Steve’s. They must be on speakerphone.
“You sucker punch me, I sucker punch you.
“Bye, Tati,” she said as he walked to the elevators before turning to the family.
“Yeah,” Steve said with a nod, leading the two over to sit on his bed. Tony followed him before gingerly tracing his finger along the spine, looking up at him to make sure he was okay. Steve just smiled and nodded, rolling his eyes fondly at the brunette.
“What’s the vibranium for Pops?” he asked excitedly. His Pop only glared back at him, crossing his arms to keep a smile from breaking thru. Peter turned to his rather silent father, who was currently looking out the window pretending to be intrigued by clouds. He smiled to himself as he carefully maneuvered himself to sit fully in his Dad’s lap, turning away from his other protesting father.
“To what?! What dastardly deed is she doing?”
She fell asleep smiling.
Steve rejoined them a minute or two later, sitting down in his original position before putting his arm around his husband’s shoulder to bring the pair closer.
It was almost as if she was coming between her and her father.
“Alright, Elsa. Who else? Pete?”
“Oh shit,” Bill said before he covered his mouth with his hands.
"WAIT! Just tell me where it is-!" she tried as she heard her dads talk before the darker haired one reappeared; fully clothed. He was wearing an ACDC t-shirt and sweatpants and gently closed the door behind them as he ushered them away.
“So you’re really not doing anything for your birthday, huh?”
“That’s very sweet of you Tony, but I would like an actual paying job. And would probably like to wear clothes sometimes too…”
“Daddy always said
“Hey,” she replied quietly, walking over to watch.
"I was able to make the man-child take his medicine, so that's something," Peter said as Wade laughed a little at that. Peter's smiled dropped as he watched Wade get bowls ready to feed the sickos, the superhero wondering why it had been so weird between them lately.
“Oh, hell no,” her Tati said and began shifting the two off the couch.
“That’s my girl!” he cheered as he brought her onto his lap and covered the giggly baby in kisses. He even clapped his hands together as Steve rolled his eyes fondly at him.
“Thanks, Pop,” she said quietly.
“Got your meds?” he asked the teen after throwing an arm around her.
Tony stopped hearing her at this point, leaning away from her as he laughed harder than he had in weeks.
“Uh oh, I think he’s right,” her equally frustrating Pop added. She rolled her eyes at both of them until she heard May speak up.
“Yeah cause babies usually are born at nine months and he was born at seven and a half.”
“Yeah! I met Butterfingers and U! And I met DUM-E, but he’s in timeout right now,” Leo finished sadly as Peter glanced back at his Dad who was glaring at a corner of his lab.
Sorry for the wait! Life happened, but I'll be writing more this weekend :)
“Pretty sure I’m the lucky one,” he said, before pointedly looking down at his husband’s crotch. His love shoved him lightly and took a step back.
“Tony,” Steve said breathlessly, “you...did you build this?” he asked in excitement.
"She's almost eighteen, I can cuss in front of her
“Oh jeez, don’t remind me. The team would not shut up about it, Rumlow took the crown and did god knows what with it.”
And one time, Uncle Loki snuck him to Asgard.
“You…you and your
“Well, then enlighten me Steven,” the shorter man grumbled as he sat up to face him.
“Why? So you can yell at me?” she asked defensively, holding the toy closer to her chest.
Steve wondered if he and Tony were like that as Bucky kept talking.
“I’m sorry -”
“Did Barnes convince you to join baseball? Or at least borrow his pants?” Tony asked with wiggly brows, causing the once warm feeling in his chest to quickly turn to annoyance.
“Like you were ever the cute one?” Steve chimed in, laughing as he caught the pillow his brother threw at him.
He was so damn grateful for May, who happily accepted having Joey for the night so Steve could talk one on one with his husband without any distractions. Plus Joey seemed more than excited to hang out with May and Peter, so win-win.
“Mm,” Tony grunted in response.
Barnes was back, and looked completely different.
, he reminded himself.
“Even when I pull stupid shit like this?” he asked when he pulled back, eyes focused on how puffy Steve’s lips were.
“Steeb? Where you go?” she asked suddenly.
“Are we going to see your favorite animal Clint? Tati said they have wolves and those are my favorite.”
“-you’re relying your secret identity on another stupid teenager you barely know?” Peter hissed out, gripping his fist as they heard a sudden knock on the door.
“Are you really trying not to let a sixteen year old win?” Bruce asked in disappointment.
"Dads, we talked about this," Miles said annoyed as he cross his arms at their parents.
“I am sorry though. For being such a bad boyfriend and not knowing what you wanted to do with your future…”
And that’s when Steve lost his shit, doubling over in laughter as the realization of the situation clicked in his brain.
“Look, as much as I hate to admit it, your husband does have…
“There’s somethin’ wrong with being gay?” he said just as angrily. Steve stole a glance at Joey, rolling his eyes fondly to see she was just reaching for the cookies in the basket – not paying the men any mind.
“Sweet dreams, Petey,” Steve said before planting a kiss on his cheek.
“So…wanna tell me what that was about?”
“You’re not losing me, you beautiful idiot,” Buck said with a smile.
“No, you’re not,” Pepper quickly added, while Tony couldn’t help but smile at the genuine fear in Marcus’ eyes.
"Okay, so. I had a panic attack, followed by a flashback. Jarvis apparently told Pop who caught me before I unconsciously...climbed out my bedroom window. Which, apparently there are safety measures for such things. Anyway, it all happened because I haven't seen Kate in like a month. I was sick then she was out of town and then I thought I was doing better which lead to...me...not taking my meds for the last...week. But Pop made me take them today and I have to take them in front of him the next two weeks and I just...am done," she finished with a hopeful look back to her father.
“NO FAIR,” Hulk pouted as Daci gently caught her breath.
Clint’s eyes bulged as James stalked over to him before throwing the unsuspecting blonde over his shoulder. He shrieked in laughter as the much stronger teen easily carried him off to oblige the blonde’s request.
“–I know how my Dad died!” she snapped at him. The cloud around him only darkened at that, crossing his arms tightly over his chest.
Tony was apparently waiting to see her face to speak again, having helped her right her clothing and sit up to face them.
"Bubba." Everyone whipped their heads to the baby, who was smiling and reaching for Harley.
Kimberly took a step back at that, glaring at the child she abandoned and not saying a word. Emerson knew she was losing time and needed to head back, taking a breath before saying her final words.
“Mrs. Walker, I ask that you wait before contributing.” The angry looking middle aged woman sat back dramatically waiting for him to continue. “Now, I will remind both parents and all students that neither violence nor bullying is tolerated at my school. However, I am to understand that that was exactly what happened earlier today. Hunter and John Walker, I have several people telling me you began the altercation by antagonizing Peter here for his sexual orientation. Then others tell me Miss Emerson here threatened –
He frowned when he didn’t hear a response for a moment.
“I don’t believe this,” Steve said quietly.
They went two more rounds before falling asleep together, both sated and exhausted.
“Heck yes I did,” Tony said, all the while changing his background to the new wallpaper his husband sent him.
“Do you need to work tonight, beloved?” Steve asked Tony before they left.
“And we are two well trained superheroes who aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. Long haul, right?” The billionaire laughed while shaking his head, should’ve known his love would be able to read his mind again.
“A snotty toddler for three months sounds great to you?” Joey asked skeptically, getting an eye roll and groan from Steve.
He owed Cheryl.
He smiled before responding, “it’s good to be back, Jarvis. Where might my husband be?” What he expected was a snarky response from the AI with a possible lecture about his husband’s poor sleep schedule. But what he got, was refreshingly unexpected.
“Mr. Stone is a powerful man, as is his father –” Michael added.
“But…” Steve fumbled, “…then why did you date him on and off?” Apparently that was the wrong question, Steve immediately feeling extra guilty when Tony finally turned to face him and looked absolutely broken.
Clint was scooting to the edge of the bed and sitting on it, looking wearily at Bucky as he walked over to sit down next to him.
“Clint...I don’t know how much longer I can do this…” the brunette said in exhaustion.
Teary, big green eyes looked into his, terrified.
As he was holding her, still smiling minutes later after hearing her call him ‘dad’, he remembered something he wanted to show her.
Their Pop then picked up the chuckling youngest, kissing his cheek loudly to get more giggles from the five year old. She followed them back into the living room, just now noticing that her Dad had remained sitting in his same spot to finish his breakfast. The blonde flipped the tiny kid until he was holding him upside down as they walked to the genius to join him. She sat next to Peter on the other side of the couch, rolling their eyes when their Pop sat next to their Dad after chucking a laughing Miles in between them and the teens on the couch.
“Hey Jo,” the brunette said gently as she whipped around to face him – apparently too blazed to even notice they’d walked up to her.
“…you’re coddling me. You make Peter apologize when he hurts someone. If he is expected to apologize then so am I. You have to treat us the same.” She looked at him with such finality… it felt eerily like his own look enough to send a shiver down his spine.
He was much better at this when she was little. He had more patience because she couldn’t fully comprehend her actions. But as a teen? Jesus…
,” Bucky said, obnoxiously kissing the shorter teen’s temple as he grumbled in protest. Bastard knew he couldn’t retaliate with a sleepy baby in his arms.
“Don’t tell me how to parent you condescending prick! You think you’re a bigger man because you have a few stars on your hat? I’ve got friends in high places, fucker,” Howard spat out, going so far as to poke the taller man in his chest. Tony had his tongue caught in his mouth, wanting to ask Joe to go easy on the ass kicking...but also not wanting that.
Those four words had the brunette retching away immediately, panic shooting up his spine at Clint possibly connecting the two.
"Hey," her brother began, but quickly hung his head in defeat when his Dad gave him a
That’s what he focused on throughout the game, that and the feeling of Steve’s lips again as the Avengers quickly destroyed whatever school they were playing. Tony watched the players walk off to the locker room as he and his friends made their way to the gym amongst the sea of teens.
“Pees Seeb?” she asked, tiny hands grasping for the not-toy. Bucky let out a laugh, walking over to her to help her start by standing up, determined to have her walk again.
Did you catch my Rugrats reference? For my fellow 90s babies
But still, the fear was there and she felt herself trembling from both terror and exertion.
He could feel his brother glaring at him, but chose to ignore it.
“You’ll be happy to know we talked,” the blonde whispered to him with his eyes closed.
“Josephine, no more whining or Jose won’t come over at all.” Steve was glad to hear her sigh but did frown when she simply climbed on top of him.
He looked back at the teen who was cleaning her glasses off with her t-shirt and thought about his brother again. He got up to kiss her on the cheek, following his husband out of her room after they wished their daughter goodnight.
“Mm?” she questioned eloquently, turning her face to squint at the intruder.
“Petey what’s wrong? I thought you liked your tux?”
“Dr. Chase, how is he?”
“JARVIS, can you ask the Starks if they’re free to go to the zoo with us?”
“Well I could’ve come after getting her to the hospital.”
“You don’t know that, kiddo,” Tony piped in softly, “you still could’ve asked us or at least told us about it after.” She glared a little at the man, unable to stop the words from coming out.
“Aladdin!” Harley said, in a much better mood but still climbing into Tony’s lap.
A member came up and asked for some towels, so Steve went back to the front desk, counting on his Pappy to cheer the pup up. As he helped other members sign in and hydrate, he stole a glance at his kid.
“I’ll go look for reinforcements,” she offered, ignoring Steve’s pleading look.
“Because, my dear Pop,” she added a chuckle, “you are a dumbass.” Steve blinked at her several times in disbelief, whispering “language?” as a question. This only increased the laughs from the teenager and added confusion to the super soldier.
Tony leaned his body to cuddle with the man, who offered an arm to wrap around Tony, both sitting happy and content with their family.
It was almost a similar kind of love she felt for her Tati.
“Don’t start with me Anthony. You’re
Steve took that opportunity to drink from his own cup, unable to hide the smile as the brunette still squinted his eyes at the other man.
“Okay…so I’m not in trouble?” she asked hesitantly.
His husband joined him a few moments later, frowning at Steve.
“No you don’t!” Clint said more forcefully, shaking from his embrace and pushing himself to stand up. “You don’t know what’s going to happen, and neither will I! Cause I’m just your boyfriend that’ll be stuck in high school and can’t get to you or find out how you’re doing. Or know who you’ll eventually leave me for!”
“You purchased this,” Steve said aloud, shaking the thing and looking up at the man biting his bottom lip.
“No you don’t,” Steve replied.
“If you let me pay for dry-cleaning, I could dirty that uniform for you…” Tony said with a mischievous smile. Steve felt himself blush, all the stress and anger from today slowly draining out of his body at finally seeing his husband. An idea popped into his head…but the thought of either of his kids seeing him in between the lab and their bedroom made the blonde hesitate.
“Is he a weirdo or is that his actual–”
He wore jeans and a hoodie, figuring if he was going to be sober he was at least going to be comfortable about it. His dad let him borrow his jeep - he was still saving up for his first car, if you had to know - and of course it needed gas.
“Commander, to what do I owe the honor?” Fury took a moment to close the door behind him, walking over to sit across from Steve’s desk.
Being Spiderman.
“You sure you don’t wanna talk about
The ones in front of her were not small or scrawny.
"Do you get off on people not knowing just how dirty you are?" the brunette asked as he walked over to the beautiful bastard. The sexy beast shrugged his shoulder in fake innocence, smirking at his love as the smaller man leaned up to kiss him.
Clearly, this was something that needed to be returned to him asap.
“No Papa,” he whimpered quietly, clearly exhausted. She watched her dads share a look before Steve tried again.
“What if you just sedate her?” he asked, moving his drawing pad out of the way when she started kicking next to him in protest; still screaming.
The genius just laughed and nodded his head, hugging himself close. They weren't sure how long they'd be there.
~~~~||||~~~~||||~~~~
The boy unknowing who this other little pup was looked up. His eyes were wide and scared as he took in the small stature of Anthony who looked on in confusion, confusion at the lump and form which was behind the scrawny boy hidden in the cave.
~~~~||||~~~~||||~~~~
His 5th birthday came along and all he got off his father was a ruffle to the hair. His mother had wrapped him up some new sketchbooks so he could practice his 'doodles' as she called them no matter how many times he told her he was designing a robot that could help his father with his work she thought it was a game, not knowing how serious Anthony was. In his head he knew maybe if his father had a bit of help maybe he'd have more time to play. That was the beginning of one of Anthony's greatest joys, mechanics, engineering and design but his 'doodling' wasn't quite enough to keep him entertained. There was only so long you could keep a pup inside before they started to get cranky.
~~~~||||~~~~||||~~~~
The first time they both became aware of the others situation was on an Avengers promotion tour. Everyone wanted a piece of the team and so they'd been invited to Vegas for a showing. It was all well and good, but the hotel they were staying at had a little bit of trouble that night with the heating.
Steve just laughed, a short laugh really because it hurt his chest, "looks like I'm really going to be a Capiscle this time, but  come on, we're going to be fine and to prove it .... When we get out of this I'm taking you for a hot coffee"
The next time was the result of a brain freeze. As spring entered Thor brought with him from Asgard some chilling pink coloured ice cream, labelling it as 'The desert of my people!'
"Steve" The scrawny pup said slowly and shook his head at the final question he looked down at the lump behind him, it was clear it was a blanket hiding something and Steve pulled it down to show the young pup the face of a woman, "My mama is not poorly" He whispered tears in his eyes.
Jarvis took the boy by the shoulder and led him to a small shop on the corner, it was a small shop, they didn't deal in such things as money for they had no need for it. So there was no need for any displays as such. The shop was also filled with all things natural, either made within the community or plucked straight from the forest and Anthony went straight for the berries taking his selection of the delicious fruits. The mistake that the Beta Butler made in that moment was that he took his eyes off the pup for a few minutes to take to the Omega woman to the side, asking how she had been, how her pups were etc. This gave the young pup the perfect opportunity to slip from sight with a paper bag will of berries he went to explore.
The second time was after a mission, it had been weeks since their cuddling night in Vegas and Steve had all but forgotten it ever happened really. It was no big deal and not worth pondering on.
They didn't move for a while, and they didn't hear Bruce walk into the room. He took one look at them snuggled on the couch, smiled and backed out.
"They expect me to take up the mantle as pack alpha as soon as possible, the elders have advised we move to the mansion. I'm sorry, I wish we had more time"
The genius trudged into the common area to find only Steve with his feet up on the coffee table, sketchbook in his lab, pencil moving delicately over the paper. It was a sweet sight to see the Captain so relaxed especially after such a tough and tiresome mission. Tony didn't really say anything as he approached, he merely slipped into the space beside the blonde and curled up against his side; bringing his dressing gown and blanket with him but making sure not to block Steve's way to his sketchbook.
There was one major reason why Steve constantly found his body temperature to be higher than anyone else's. The serum. The serum was what kept him alive while frozen in the ice, his heated blood keeping circulation through his body. It meant despite popular belief of 'Captain America must surely be cold all the time due to 70 years in the ice' Steve actually found himself completely unaware of cold temperatures.
The genius chuckled and squeezed him a little, "you are warm aren't you? I'm making you my personal hot water bottle that's what I'm doing" he joked. Or Steve presumed he was joking anyway.
I know this chapter seemed long and not particularly much happened however it has set up the basis for the rest of the story. I would love some genuine feedback on what you guys thought and I'm going to try and get another chapter uploaded within the next week.
He found himself walked down a track that took him away from the town and towards the forest, throwing another berry into his mouth he thought to himself maybe he could find some himself and take them back to his mother, show how good he was that he could find his own food amongst the undergrowth. He showed no fear unknowing at this point that his absence had been noticed and the Beta was frantically looking for him.
The time that Steve pulled Tony to him took place on another mission. A mission in the Himalayas, they'd discovered a faint alien signal in the mountains and Tony being their tech expert had taken to going, Steve went with him, it wasn't safe to fly a jet or the suit into the mountains so they went the old fashioned way. Mountain climbing. Steve carrying the heavy load of course. And it was cold, even Steve was wrapped up and Tony had two coats on and was still shivering.
The woman (Maria) shushed her significant other and present a gentle kiss to the boys head, "Sweet dreams Anthony" she whispered to the 4 year old before she straightened up and tiptoed from the bedroom. Looking back over her shoulder once to look at her pups face, highlighted by a stream of moonlight coming through the window. With a quiet click she shut the door behind them turning to her mate with half a smile, a smile which soon faded when she saw the crinkle of worry on the alpha's face.
This was the start of a fascinating and unusual love between human and beast. Without a tribe to return to unknowing where they were the female had been allowed to stay within the pack, protected by the Alpha who had brought her. How their relationship grew, as pure as a true bond woven between beast and human.
"That's exactly what I'm proposing, how come here so I can squeeze you more"
~~~~||||~~~~||||~~~~
Everyone had been invited so everyone was present and accounted for. But as it got down to a minute before the new year they all stopped dancing, drinking and eating. They all stood and looked up at the sky. The minute felt long and the air was cold. Tony found himself leaning against Steve's side. The captain made no objections and wrapped an arm around the smaller man in an attempt to keep him as warm as he wanted to be. Transferring that extra body heat into Tony.
Anthony was lucky it was not the home of a bear, as bears were known for wondering in that area instead more surprisingly and luckily another voice answered him back from the dark. A voice which wavered, scared and alone. "Hello? Who's there?".
Tony shook his head gestured for him to come over,"share then", he opened his blanketed arms for Steve to slip inside. Now they weren't dating, they hadn't even considered a romantic relationship between them but their friendship certainly had grown. So Steve had no problem slipping onto the couch and bringing Tony close to him so they could cuddle.
They managed to find shelter, a small ice cave to the side, he tugged Tony inside and though it was still deathly cold the wind wasn't hitting them where they were hidden. Tony's teeth were chattering and they sat together like that for at least an hour before Tony started rubbing his hands together, maybe he felt too awkward cuddling up to Steve in a mission. Maybe he had thought it wouldn't be professional but that time Steve took it out of his hands and tugged the smaller man to his side, "human water bottle to the rescue eh?" He teased, breathing hot air against Tony's ear.
"Hey tones, nice shower?" He asked, unknowing of Tony's situation.
"Always thought I'd die in battle not by getting turned into a human snow man" Tony whispered.
The 5 year old toddled into the dark, sniffing the air and following the scent of something unusual that he had never scented before which he didn't think unusual as, as pointed out, he'd never really left his own home. He followed his nose for a good while, he'd had to climb up a rocky area onto some slopes and followed a very rural path lined with the prettiest flowers he'd never even seen before. He was away for a good while in a dangerous area that was coming close to his packs boarders (unknowing how dangerous it would be to leave the boarders of his own pack). Up the slopes he walked until the scent he was following got stronger and stronger leading him into a small cave in the side of the cliff. The pup poked his head inside, calling out as he did so, "Hello?"
They stayed curled up like that through the night, eventually they fell asleep tangled together and Tony did later admit it was the best nights sleep he'd had in a long time. He didn't have any nightmares of the cold darkness of space, or of the chilling caves. He didn't have chance because Steve was keeping those cold thoughts away with his warm presence.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve looked down at Tony, who now had his head resting on the broader man's shoulder, and smiled slightly. He didn't bring attention to the randomness of the situation and instead turned his gaze to the page.
For a man in his forties Tony jumped out of that shower terribly quick. Grabbing a towel and rubbing himself dry, trying to warm up his now chilling bones to no avail.
It was one particular morning when his father had escaped the house quickly followed by a couple of other pack members who were more regularly seen around his father in recent years, when his mother had ran out quickly upon hearing one of the omegas down in the pack was in labour leaving Anthony alone in the mansion with only his Beta butler Jarvis. It was on this morning that the 5 year old decided he wanted to explore more than just the walls of the mansion. He called out to his Beta butler and asked him whether they could take a walk into the town, he was bored he wanted to do something a little interesting. Jarvis looked a little unsure, Anthony had never really been allowed out before, their previous home had been out the way of the main pack and town as Howard had wanted to have as much private family life as he possibly could before he had to step up to become Pack Alpha. However, he didn't see the harm in taking the young pup into the town to buy some berries from the shop.
“What? Who are you talking about, baby?”
…was that…was that a new couch?
“It was Cheryl,” he said quietly, hanging his head as he felt James wrap his arm around him again. “She kissed me on the head and...it...reminded me of an old foster mom.” He took another shaky breath before continuing, glad James was being quiet and patient with him. “She uh, you know...molested me…”
"Maybe when I get discharged, but I'm pretty sure you owe me dinner first," Clint - that beautiful sassy little shit snarked, earning him another deep kiss. They were kissing for another few seconds when they suddenly heard cheers. And sure enough, watching them through the glass from the hallway, was Natasha and Daciana.
“-Alright, Tony. I like you. I would like to date you. Do you want to go see a movie with me tomorrow night?” Steve said blatantly, smile plastered on his stupid handsome face.
“It’s close enough to start to worry. Even your backstabbing father was concerned…”
The thing was, this man may have been heavier than Steve, but the blonde had more inches and muscle tone. So Steve stared down at the man until he finally took a step back, still not letting Steve in to the house.
“We don’t have to match, cub. Vivienne said I’d look better with shorter hair and I agreed,” Barnes said with a bright smile, kissing the girl’s head before standing up.
EMERSON
company,” Howard said as he reached forward and yanked Tony out of the doorway.
He glanced back at James, who had an equally concerned expression on his face, before turning back to grab his key and open the door.
"Emerson, I am a little mad. But please let me speak my peace, I'll keep it short, then you'll help me pick out the playlist for the runway show, okay?" he said and smiled as she smiled in return.
“And what am I saying now?” his boyfriend asked, eyes suddenly bulging and crossed and looking so crazy Clint couldn’t help but chuckle.
“Steve, there are three steps, I do not need an ambulance.”
When she got to the local clinic, she walked around looking for someone important to tell. Her breathing was ragged as she tried to find a woman to tell, not really wanting to see a man. A dark skinned nurse made her way over to the frightened child, out of adrenaline. She stared at the lady’s brown eyes as she kneeled down to her level. When she got her breathing under control, she said with a shaky voice “my name is Ashley Sanchez. My father is Robert Sanchez and he sells drugs. He sells drugs…and he sells me.” Tears were in her eyes as she said that. She listened as the room had gotten quiet, other patients and people in the clinic now focused on her. The pretty nurse gave her a small smile before placing her hand on her shoulder.
? Because you’re currently giving me several…” It was her turn to sit back in surprise, not initially believing he would actually go through with his threat.
“Thanks for the vote of confidence, asshole,” Clint growled out while he felt Buck wrap an arm around him and pull him close.
“I see how it is, don’t even need me,” he teased as he climbed into bed. They both laughed at that, Joey untangling herself to curl up with the father she was more concerned about tonight.
And maybe the group hug felt nice…
“– it’s fine, Em. Tony and I were thinking of doing a date night that night anyway. Just don’t pick too late a show time, alright? Pepper invited all of us to brunch Saturday.”
“I hated you. And I’m so sorry for that. The truth is…I hated myself and couldn’t punish myself any further – so I took it out on you. For what I thought you did. I told myself you were a monster like your father. And that’s not true,” she added before looking up at Emerson again.
“I should hope so, I did marry you after all.” Tony pulled his left hand out to look at the band. Which made them both chuckle, as it wasn’t his actual wedding ring. They ordered these cute plastic glow in the dark ones that they were currently wearing, not minding if they lost them.
Her cries turned into full on sobbing which quickly escalated into practically flailing to get out of his embrace.
“Bye,” he said, smile growing on his face when Steve made his way back into the kitchen. The teen was behind him, walking around the pair to grab something out of the fridge.
A loud, thundering voice echoed throughout the halls, startling her a little as both she and her father froze in their tracks.
“Jesus Xavy, the only ‘Cane’ I’m concerned about, is Cassandra. Why are you yelling at me at seven in the morning?”
“Sucks for you,” she said, sticking her tongue out for good measure.
Tony's heart sunk at the realization, not that he'd outlive all of them. But that he was this upset about it.
, especially given your track record,” Steve said without looking at her, focusing on the oven that had just beeped.
“Oh…?”
“Um, I appreciate the compliment, Barton, but-”
Very carefully so as not to disturb the now sleeping pup, Tony pulled his phone out of his pocket to take a few pictures.
"Yeah," the man answered as he turned back to the teen, interrupted from continuing as Miles asked a question.
“Seriously?” the pup asked in more exaggerated offense. “Well...what’s your favorite movie? Is it something old and boring?” Steve chuckled as he turned to face the boy before answering.
“I didn’t drink,” she croaked out, confused by his demeanor.
Steve easily returned it, frown still on his face as he burrowed himself into Buck’s neck. His brother just tightened his hold on him as Steve felt traitorous tears start to burn his eyes.
"Pete said around four," her Dad said as he started grabbing more pillows and blankets from the closet.
And also loved spending time with his son.
“Daddy?” Peter asked from the backseat of Tony’s car. The boy wasn’t as vocal as he usually was, so Tony was glad he finally spoke up half-way home from school.
"It's not that good of a story, really Miles," Thor tried to intervene as Loki spoke up again.
“What did I say would happen, huh punk?” Steve smiled as the wiggle worm continued flailing and failing to evade his captor’s embrace. Emerson scooted a little closer to Tony, not wanting a stray limb to hit her.
“Clint...what’s a handler?”
“Kind of...I mean, you love him right?” she asked after he rinsed her hair once more.
She stayed buried in his neck, mumbling something again as the man felt tear drops begin to stain his shirt. He smiled and rubbed her back in comfort.
“Wait, why did HYDRA teach you that?!” Clint asked in further panic. “You’re a child?!”
“No kiss goodbye?” Tony called after him, earning more laughs and smiles at the three remaining.
"Fuck yeah," Tony growled in agreement before beginning to drive away. He smiled at his boyfriend, wondering how he every got so lucky, while also cradling the book to his chest.
Steve breathed a sigh of relief even if he could feel that.
“Please Uncle Bucky? Pleeeeeeeeease?” Peter asked.
“Steve?!” he asked incredulously while running his hand over his face, further proof his husband was here, he was home. He threw himself at his husband, wrapping his arms around his neck and inhaling Steve’s sweet musk. The super soldier returned the hug, just as glad to have him in his arms once more. They stayed like that for a while until Tony unexpectedly rolled himself on top to straddle Steve.
"Why are you under house arrest?" Both Tony and Steve coughed out a laugh, which turned into a real laugh when they saw the other one do so. They were able to collect themselves quickly, wondering if that was necessarily an appropriate question a five year old should ask.
"Are Miles and Emerson safe?" Steve asked the general as she spoke to someone off to the side to find out.
Steve kissed his cheek again when he got in the elevator, using the time it took to walk to the kitchen to hum an old melody to the boy. Well, technically younger than him, but he had discovered Miles Davis when he woke up from the ice and had bought all of his records.
“Nice to meet you,” Tony said with a smile, sticking his hand out for Steve to shake. As Steve did, he felt a small electrical shock that he chalked up to static.
"Oh, no, it's really not that baaaaaaaaaa-" she finished with a groan as she keeled over. She ignored the comforting back rub as he said, "elevators kiddo."
“Oh my god,” the arachnid said fondly, “you are such a cheeseball.”
“You haven’t at least seen Jurassic World??” Harley asked with an adorably offended expression. “I’ll have to ask Daddy if we can watch it after dinner. It’s still not better than Jurassic Park, but it’s better than Lost World and Jurassic Park Three.”
“He’s dead,” Bucky replied as he stood up with Daci in his arms. “I’ve got Daci, rendezvous at the jet.” She barely stirred in his arms as he ran, alarming the man but not enough to stop and look. He had to get her on the jet and back home.
Eh, maybe this isn’t really about me, she thought to herself. They both looked happy even if they were also talking over one another. She did add her two cents about not allowing any press, which she was thankful the adults agreed with as well. She was also thankful for Peter, who joined the group a moment later, reminding the pair that she’s still a kid and this would all probably be overwhelming to her.
“Oh, I’m so sorry, he was probably a bastard anyway.”
“I...I need to go talk to Steve,” Tony said before hopping up out of the chair. “Thanks Bruce.”
“I’m sorry,” she started, further surprising the genius. “I didn’t mean what I said,” she finished without looking at him. Tony sat there quietly, letting the silence sit comfortably between them as she continued looking at her lap. He thought those words over, wondering if she was focusing on one thing in particular she was apologizing for or everything she said last night.
“So you knew there was going to be a fight, and ended up getting jumped?” he asked, hitting the nail on the head as she buried herself further into her chair.
“Petey-pie, how old are you?” Steve suddenly asked the boy who was giggling in Bucky’s arms.
“I do,” he said pulling away, wrapping his arm around her shoulder and walking her to the bedroom. “I just wanted to tell you something,” he said, stopping them just outside the door.
“Clint?” he asked before swallowing in anxiety, unsure why his nerves were suddenly getting the better of him. He hadn’t realized he was looking away until a soft hand gently guided him back.
Who was he kidding, he hasn’t found an unattractive side to Tony. Even when he was being obnoxiously competitive and a sore loser, Steve couldn’t help but checking his love out every chance he got.
He stared at the note in one hand and noticed his cell phone had materialized in the other. He looked back and forth between the two for several moments longer.
“Abso-fucking-lutely I do! I can take the time off work, Pepper would probably prefer me away from work right now anyway – been doing nothing but piss her off lately. But yes! Absolutely, when do I get the little monkey?”
“You...want a break?”
“Every inch of you is beautiful,” he said in his best no-nonsense tone, glaring a little more when Tony simply rolled his eyes in response. “Fine,” Steve said, accepting the challenge. He quickly finagled his husband’s pants off, along with his underwear before Steve quickly shed his own clothing, triumphantly kicking off his undergarments before turning back to his man.
“You’ll have to have an increase in your dosage, which I know you’re not a fan of.”
"Did dads send you to wake me up?"
Clint felt his brows shoot up in surprise,
“Yeah, well…there’s a pretty big difference between the two of us,” she said as she settled back down in her bed.
After the ceremony she quickly found her family, the love of her life running to her; kissing her before swinging her around in her arms saying "you did it baby!" She was a little dizzy when she was finally put down, kissing her love once more before turning to her brother who had also ran to the new college graduate.
“Jo,” he said gently to get her attention. When she didn’t look up, he repeated “Joey?”
"Then you're not the Tony Stark I know," his friend countered, continuing even when Tony looked back at him offended. "Cause the Tony I know said
“Thank you, Mr. Stark but we should be getting back,” Steve said even as he felt his cheeks warm at the implication.
Tony felt his eyes get misty as he absorbed those words. Especially since...he pretty much feels the exact same way about Steve.
“Go save my little brother and I’ll go be the responsible one - again - and make sure
“Who is it?” Natasha asked.
"He means you have good taste, little man," Peter said with a laugh as they were interrupted by Steve.
“Protective later, kiss me now,” the shorter teen growled before standing on his toes to kiss those perfect lips. Steve made a noise, but just smiled into the kiss and even deepened it. The blonde then tightened his arm around the teen, which had Tony melt in his embrace.
“–Why would you tell me that?” she asked incredulously. “What…what did you think would happen after you dropped that bombshell on me? That I’d go running into your arms? As if realizing…that my
He never wanted to be one of those people that ignored their friends in favor of hanging with their significant other.
“What would you say about Papa, Joey?” Peter asked, most of his attention back to his drawing of a …dog?
“Come on James,” Clint said with a smile, grabbing Buck’s hand and leading the two out of the apartment before adding, “bye asshole!”
“Steve?” Tony said, unable to stop the tears pouring down his cheeks. Still disbelief in his heart even though he felt reassurance through the bond.
“Pietro, could you sit down for one second?” Clint whined out.
He and Steve both snorted in laughter at that.
“Meeting at seven, Pepper threatened castration,” the brunette mumbled as he pushed Steve out of the way of the door frame so he could enter the room. He made a beeline for the bed and ignored his husband’s huff of disapproval in favor of collapsing onto the twenty thousand dollar bed.
Other times, well...other times Steve felt the distant ‘step’ in ‘step-dad.’
“What’s this about wizards?” Tony asked as he came back into the room with a smile on his handsome face.
“Tony, I was there in your late teens when you went through your ‘drunk whore’ stage, you
Emerson smiled before answering, "cause he 'borrows' things, mainly his foster father's tools. Because he wants to build a robot. The parents are concerned because there are two other children under the age of five there and since the father is carpenter and the mother is a teacher, they well, can't afford the
“Ty was possessive and manipulative and fucking ruthless. He was smart and his father was powerful. I kept coming back to him because I was convinced I couldn’t do any better. It wasn’t until,” Tony paused, an actual smile spreading across his face. “It wasn’t until Peter was born that I finally woke the fuck up. That and, Rhodey kicked his ass for me. Pepper got a few licks in too, don’t worry, then she helped me slap a restraining order against him,” he said as Steve found himself smiling at the thought.
“What?” Clint asked quietly, eyes going to James’ arm still tucked behind him.
“–what did you say? ...w-what are you talking about?” the older woman said, shaking her head in disbelief.
STEVE
“I take it you like them?” Steve asked below him, eyes twinkling but voice filled with uncertainty.
Peter and Emerson had buried Tony halfway under the sand, sculpting him into a mermaid. His husband was complaining because the “boobs are too small, Steve!” he shouted at his love, realizing he was watching them. The two teens turned to their Pop, arguing back that “Dad has a small chest!”
“Um, yeah,” the shorter blonde said before opening the door all the way, revealing Steve and Bucky sitting on the couch. “James! Put your shoes on, we're taking Lucky for a walk,” Clint added loudly with an obnoxious wink in Tony’s direction.
“No, I’m shit at this…”
He clearly wasn’t telling them enough.
, he thought fondly as he leaned down to kiss her cheek one more time before obliging her request, Tony finding comfort in the dark room as he walked towards the open door.
“Be nice,” the older brunette said with a stern expression as Daci sheepishly nodded back at him.
“Yes I absolutely can, Pepper! That fucker will go down for what he fucking did to my daughter,” he growled at his friend who was dragging him back down the hall of the hospital. Rhodey, the other traitor, was on Tony’s other side bringing the man back to his daughter’s room.
"Until next time, Stark family," Thor said as he grabbed his brother and moved to exit.
“How angry you are, and my face got exploded,” Wade said.
“That’s not fair,” his Pop said, will power also fading.
. I think you’re a little...
Every instinct told her this was a bad idea. But something deep down inside of her wanted to have an actual conversation with this woman.
like a baby,” Clint argued, smiling when the baby screamed in excitement.
“Thank you.”
Daci laughed for the first time that day, loving to see Morgan squeal with delight and her father send her a mock glare back at her. It got the attention of everyone else, who turned and let out their own noises of joy.
“Hello, gorgeous,” he said with a smile into his phone.
When Peter remained in the same spot, Emerson couldn’t help a “tsk-tsk” and head-shake from her foster-brothers antics.  A moment later, Steve returned, not surprised to find his son hadn’t moved. Instead of picking Peter up and moving him, Steve surprised the two by slowly moving around the couch until he was able to flop on top of an unexpected Peter, who offered a squeak in response. Steve laid on his back, stretching his limbs dramatically over Peter who was failing at moving the super soldier.
“– NO POP,” she said, fierce green eyes boring into his blue. She took another pause before continuing.
“What are you talking about, Steve?” The blonde took a shaky breath of his own before reaching for the brunette’s hand, who gave it to the Alpha freely.
And that’s when he spots Harry. And his lifeless body. Miles blinks a few times before moving his feet, removing the shards covering him to pull him out of the wreckage and onto a safe surface.
“Right?!” the man squeaked out as they approached their car. “That is the single toughest kid I know, and that’s
“That’s great Tony! Maybe we can bring up adoption soon?” Tony simply smiled up at the man before grabbing his shirt and pulling him back down to kiss him again. He would never get tired of kissing that man. After a few more minutes of making out, Steve pried himself away, remembering the breakfast promise.
He looked at his dads as they fought Wade over the check, wondering if he’ll ever have anything close to the kind of love they have.
“Hi, Leo,” he said, smiling when Leo offered a small wave back. They stayed silent like that for another moment before his girl spoke up.
“I’m sorry Jo,” she heard Steve apologize, turning her head to see him. He sat cross-legged on the bed, hands resting on his lap as his watery blue eyes bored into hers. “I promised your dad I’d never talk about her.”
“Wanna sit on my shoulders?” he asked. Without hesitation, she lifted her arms up, having seen other kids around them on other adult’s shoulders. Clint lifted up and settled her on his shoulders, wrapping his hands around her shins as she rested her hands on his head. Now she was tall enough to look at the monkeys.
It got another yelp out of his genius, but Steve felt justified enough not to feel guilty.
The bubbles came up to her chest and the rainbow sparkles made it that much less scary.
“Oh, you mean the stoner who abandoned you? She abandoned you,” Sam said angrily.
The shorter teen was rummaging in his closet, surrounded by a few boxes left behind from Tony moving in with his godmother. Other than that, the room was creepily empty. A triumphant ‘aha!’ snapped him back to Tony, who was backing out of the closet with…
But then she started hearing the words. The words that froze her entire being.
Tony took it upon himself to take lead, gently pushing the blonde back against the couch in order to climb fully onto his lap. Steve gave him a half-smile, reminding himself they had both made vows they’d sworn to never break. He ran his thumb across Tony’s cheekbone, the genius returning the small smile as they looked into each other’s eyes. The brunette then brought his hand up to rest against his husband’s hand still stroking his cheek.
“What’s wrong?” he asked, still frowning as she winced while sitting down cattycorner from him.
“Don’t call me stupid,” she said quietly.
“Yeah…good luck with that,” Steve said with a smile of his own, not wanting to think what kind of trouble she could get into if she did this much as a toddler. He felt lucky he could watch her from afar, loving his niece dearly but not wanting that kind of responsibility.
Settled between her two loving fathers, she quickly fell asleep, nightmare free.
“Tony?! Baby what’s wrong?” Steve asked, his frantic smell barely matching Tony’s.
“What?” Steve asked innocently. “He’s a good boy,” he said, turning back to the bot that was waving his claw around in agreement.
Not yet. Maybe one day, cause he was already crazy about this guy.
His Dad thought Wade had done it to spite the older man.
, Steve went for his usual morning run. He took a shortcut through a park and almost tripped over his own feet when he saw a certain someone sitting on a bench.
“Apparently we smell different cause we’re bonded. Did my Dad know? Are you okay? Did he threaten you?” Steve had the audacity to chuckle, patting Tony’s arm gently.
“It’s to help you when times get tough, or you doubt my love for you. That book got me through a lot of heartache over the years.” Steve was somehow more confused, looking back and forth between the book and the book giver. The bastard only chuckled, not explaining anything, before he sat on the floor and motioned for Steve to join him.
They ended up staying at the café for another hour and half, chatting away like they’ve known each other for years. And strangely enough, it feels like that even if he barely knew the man. It wasn’t until Tony’s phone went off several times in a row that either noticed the time or how late it had gotten. Tony generously paid the staff and thanked them for the privacy as the two made their way outside into the sunshine.
She had laughed when the fathers embraced their oldest, reassuring him that he'd
“Put that out, Barton,” the man said after sneaking up on him, causing the teen to yelp in surprise.
“You can do whatever you want to my head, baby,” Tony whispered seductively. He laughed when his husband proceeded to roll his eyes before reclaiming his mouth, effectively silencing the man.
She had asked to be the one to tell him, the padres only agreeing that she'd do it in front of the whole family. So they decided they'd do it after school the next day.
, I overheard my father selling her on his phone. Exchanging her for a debt
!” Steve shrieked out, face fully red and
“Just...you know, until you sober up,” Steve said with a blush. It was at that moment he heard his friends come outside to join them.
“We’re in the living room!” he shouted to the pair, staying seated as the boy crawled onto Tony’s lap. Steve walked in first with Joey following close behind, the teen looking around the mansion in awe. The blonde walked over and smiled at the pair, moving to sit near Tony but not so close he’d scare Peter. The toddler cuddled further into his father’s embrace, hiding his face from the stranger.
“Yeah, he has reminded me of that many times.”
“Oh poor baby,” she sympathized as she smiled at her frustrated oldest. “Do you want me to spank him?” Now Steve didn’t try to hold back his laughter, seeing his brother throw his arms up again dramatically as his niece nodded furiously in agreement.
“She wanted it to snow,” the man said as he looked at his younger brother. Steve let out another laugh, glad to see Bucky join him this time.
“Twenty four minutes isn’t half an hour,” she muttered.
“How did you know?” Tony asked in bewilderment, shrugging his shirt up higher even though he’d tripled checked that it covered his gland. His Mama rolled her eyes at him, glancing at her grandson before continuing.
She snaps out of her depressive thoughts when she hears footsteps in the hallway. Maybe…maybe he came home early. She pulls herself off the bed and walks slowly to her door. Opening the door, she peaks out into the hall and frowns when she sees nothing.
out of our lives but...Harley wants to know him. I feel like I owe it to the pup.”
"He's coming by later to bring some soup, little Flower," the older brother said as he fluffed his little brother's pillows. Miles eyes slowly closed as he settled back into the couch, Peter helping tuck him in. He turned to the other two, glad to see them passed out as well so he could finish cleaning to cut his Pop some slack. He'd have some time to kill before Wade got there anyway.
The tall blonde looked relieved, glad that this was over, even if for now.
“Was I bad?”
“Whole mansion to yourself, sounds fun,” Steve said absently, looking at more technology in one room then he’s seen in his entire life.
“Oh Daci,” Vivienne said, squatting down in front of her and placing a gentle hand on the girl’s shoulder. “You should always trust your first instinct.” Before Daci could react to that, she felt a pinch in her neck, looking up as Vivienne pulled an empty syringe away from her.
“Alright, I’m apparently picking him up at ten, so be ready by nine forty five, alright punk?” Buck asked, not waiting for an answer as he ushered Steve out of his front door after he stopped by earlier.
“Wow...you know Pepper also threatens me with castration. You’d never do that, you like them too much,” Tony smirked, glad to see his husband shake his head fondly. He grabbed a hand towel for Steve to dry off on before continuing. “Also the meeting ran long, I promise I didn’t do it on purpose.”
“Wait,” Emerson began after a moment. “Does Peter still get to be Spiderman?” Both fathers turned to glare at her. Peter sat quietly with a small smile.
,” the British man said quietly. The sick feeling made its way back into Steve’s soul, the thought that this has happened before.
“Hey, don’t just walk away from me,” Steve said as he followed his husband into the kitchen, where the brunette had his back turned as he rifled through their tea selection.
“See now this is cause for celebration!” Sam said, slapping Steve’s thighs and standing up before heading into the kitchen.
“And why couldn’t you come tell me, huh?” he asked as he practically dragged her back to the mansion, ignoring her ludicrous question.
. And he had that thought on loop as he waited the few minutes it took for Steve to bring two fresh brewed lattes and assorted chocolates. The smell helped perk him up, shifting to a sitting position and extending his hands out to accept the drink.
"Where are my flowers?" Wade whined as Miles pouted with a "I don't get any flowers?" The others in the room laughed at the two as Peter felt his sister elbow him in the side, whispering "
…Emerson figured she should probably be a more supportive sister….
Which doesn’t count…since it was a phone call. And there was one email.
He went to check the kitchen for his husband, but frowned when he didn’t find him there. Which meant he was probably in his lab. The blonde sighed before heading to their bedroom to finally crash.
The blonde started making plates and bringing them over to the island as he saw Miles shimmy down from his other father.
“Do you want me to stop?” the blonde asked. Tony grumbled in response, not wanting to admit how incredibly hot this was…except this was one of Tony’s favorite outfits!
“But we’re her parents. Wouldn’t we get a say in something like that?”
"If I am it's your Pop's fault for acting so weird," the older man said childishly, loving seeing his kid laugh at the antics.
“I am…
“But see Joey?” Peter asked as he pushed Steve back to sit in his lap and face Joey. “He’s the best Papa. You gotta say it,” he finished with crossing his arms in challenge. She glared at the boy, both for being right and calling her out on it.
.” The fathers stood in absolute astonishment, never hearing her use such a menacing threat against someone.
“Aunt Peggy?”
“You can still read her a story, Mother Goose, I’m sure she’ll be smiling in her sleep from it,” Buck said as he put his shoes and coat on. “Not that I’m jealous, or anything,” he added with a wink before grabbing his keys to leave. “Bye punk.”
The two assassins who he loved dearly but had driven him crazy the last half hour, thankfully took the hint and left the room they had so “graciously occupied.” His Pops nodded to them in thanks before closing the door behind them, Peter now registering that his dark clothes were actually sweats – and not his uniform.
Steve was walking around the living room, a cuddly Harley in his arms. His pup’s face was buried in the Alpha’s shoulder, tiny arms wrapped around his neck as Steve mumbled some quiet words into the boy’s ear. He didn’t stop moving when he spotted Tony, just smiled at the Omega before moving the two to sit back on the couch.
. To some elderly man on the other side of the world; I knew what kind of life that meant for her.”
Peter was still dancing when they heard the elevators ding, indicating Joey was home.
Her stupid locker wouldn’t open, resorting to pounding on the damn thing to get her stupid binder for stupid history class.
Three days later and Steve’s staring at the note in his hand as he sits in his kitchen. It was his day off and he was thankful for that as he sipped his coffee and thought his life over.
“Mr. Hoggs, I believe we have heard quite enough,” the official began. “Martha,” he turned to the mediator who was also taking notes. “Please help Mr. Stark and Mr. Rogers with the final paperwork. I believe we can all conclude this is an excellent fit for Miss Smith,” he turned to smile at the young teen, “and I’ll be happy to report all of this back to the Department of Human Services. Your new parents have already passed the background check and home visit. We are all very happy for you, Emerson. This concludes this meeting.” The official and mediator stood up to shake hands with Peter and his parents, all ignoring the steaming Mr. Hoggs refusing to move from his chair.
Shaking his head fondly, Clint knocked on the door and only had to wait a moment before the door swung open. Standing there was a young boy, who looked like the blonde version of Bucky.
“Can I get two cookies Papa?” Peter asked with a sniffle, mostly past the crying and making Steve suddenly proud in that moment.
“Daddy no!” Harley cried before tightening his hold around his father and suddenly bursting into tears.
“That’s fine! Samwise! Want to take a break from crying like a baby?” she teased at his grumpy friend.
“Hola, mija.”
“Speaking of stegosaurus, they happen to be my favorite dinosaur,” Steve said, holding onto his pup’s legs and waiting for the inevitable debate. The Alpha didn’t have a favorite dinosaur, but he knew the best way to distract the pup was to bring up his favorite hobby.
“He’s perfectly healthy, however. He’ll need to stay in the hospital for about a week for observation, but then you’ll be able to take your baby brother home after,” Dr. Strange supplied with a smile. “In the meantime maybe you two can come up with a name.”
His love stood on his tip toes and kissed his lips, Steve finding it easy to return the kiss as his hands roamed down to the most amazing ass, cupping both cheeks before bringing the two closer together.
“Wade if you even think about pooping on me,” Tony growled out to the baby, who only giggled and slapped Tony’s face in response.
“That’s okay,” Steve said in reassurance, patting her knee before leaning back against the couch. “We’ll go pick them up after we leave here.”
So Tony was totally relaxed and happy and totally tranquil when he turned to his ex.
“This is nothing that a simple apology can’t fix. And then we can find out what that lying bitch was up to,” Steve cursed for him, which almost put a smile on Bucky’s face. Except he replayed the way he treated Clint and his own daughter in his head. That just curdled the sour in his stomach and made him feel more betrayed than he’s felt in his life. Which is saying something.
“Alright fine, twist my arm why don’t you?”
“Where’s your brother?” The super soldier asked, letting up on crushing the teen. He noticed she didn’t immediately break away from him, hesitating until a moment longer to stand back and answer.
“Anytime, Stevie. Go check on your boys.” Feeling more comfortable and confident, Steve shook off the last of his nerves and opened the door to the surgery waiting room.
“Peter do you know what ‘privileged’ means?” he asked the boy. Peter shook his head with confused eyes.
“Look, it’ll be fine! And now you know, so you can train me!” Peter dropped his hands and glared at his little brother. “Or...maybe not right away…”
When he simply resumed sleeping, he turned his attention back to his sketch. He was so deep in concentration that he almost missed Bucky opening his eyes a few times in waking up.
She swallowed her anger enough to not challenge him any further; not particularly wanting to get her ass tanned this evening. He’d done it once before, and he was way harsher than her Dad had been.
“Daci! Daci did you hear we’re going to paint today?” Peter asked, coming to a halt in front of the table with crepes and eating one.
She nodded in response, clutching Wolf tighter as Steve’s words rolled around in her head.
"Alright, my turn," his husband said as he reached up for their granddaughter.
“Oh come on, Emerson is
“Oh, um. I mean, it was…fine. Lonely, but fine.”
"Like...a week?" she said as he closed his eyes anger. She started to look away again when she heard him take a breath and use one finger to gently guide her back to look at him.
“I think I’m just going to sit here and wait for you,” she said as she gestured to the comfy seats in the lounge area. He offered her a nod in response before heading towards the elevators.
“Daddy she isn’t anywhere! I checked da kitchen, da bafrooms, I even checked MY room!” he exclaimed, fatigue affecting his enunciation. Poor kid sounded exhausted physically from running but also emotionally with worthy. Tony immediately picked up on this, beckoning the boy over to him as he tried to reassure the 3 year old.
They made it to the lab in record time, guard still up as they inspected the destroyed area. There was obviously an explosion, evident by the charred remains, as the super soldier tried to focus on the fact that she was definitely still alive.
“Yes, I also told her the paint is edible but I think you’re the only one excited about that,” Steve said with a smirk as he grabbed Morgan to sit on his lap.
. No, I don’t see why it took you so long. You’re fucking amazing,” Tony said in disbelief as he rifled through the rest.
“So are we going to sit out here going over my sexual orientation or do you want to go back inside and dance?” Wade finished his cup, standing up to offer his hand to Peter. Peter grabbed it, standing up next to the guy he’s been in love with for two years. He hesitated a moment longer before quickly kissing Wade on his lips, unbelievably happy.
“I love you too baby girl. We’ll see you soon,” she smiled again at the quiver in his voice.
“Apologize?” Peter graciously asked. Wade’s eyes watered a little as he nodded.
“No, I think I’ll let the internet do its job when he’s old enough,” the man teased back.
“Your pelvic region works, and I can grab you an ice pack if you’d like,” Steve offered.
PETER
Long before he fell head over heels for that man.
Steve looked at her head downcast before replying, “I could handle it, if you’d prefer. Though I can’t promise I would follow the judicial system…” He smiled when she did, glad to see some humor with her.
To Tony.
me do it as an excuse for me giving in so easily. It’s just a joke, Daci.” While that did make her relax a little, she still had a frown on her face.
Clint’s husband trailed in last, newest addition to their household held delicately in his arms. One of which momentarily distracted Tony long enough to stop walking.
The other Alpha started speaking to Tony in French...unaware that Steve also spoke French...
“Harley? Where is he?”
“Beauty takes time!”
Fun note - this is based on a true story. I ninja mind tricked my brother during Uno, however it only worked once. One glorious and victorious time.
He blinked several times in surprise at her, should’ve guessed she knew him better as a smile broke across his face.
“If it makes you feel better, Thumper.” He was startled when she sat up suddenly at that, bumping the super soldier in the jaw before looking at him with a huff.
“Sam?” Joey asked dazedly.
“What?! Even me?” Joe asked in a whiny voice just as Steve grabbed Tony’s arm and led them to the stairs.
“Well, Harley’s middle name is Patrick and Morgan’s is Elisabeth,” Steve answered with a smile as Daci mulled those names over in her head.
FLASHBACK
did you just call my kid?” he asked, remaining sitting but turning his attention now fully to the red-faced shrew.
EMERSON
She wishes she could go back in time, tell her twelve year old self to stop complaining.
“Happy birthday Petey pie!” she said again, ignoring the groans coming from him.
Please don’t be what I fear this is.
She hadn’t.
“If that’s what it takes,” his boyfriend said with a smile as Clint sat there quietly smiling for a moment before taking a deep breath.
Harley even let Steve carry the sleepy pup home, which won the Alpha sweet, sweet rewards from his Omega when they went to bed that night.
she truly thought to herself as she hugged the men that changed her life.
Bucky didn’t know…
“And I don’t care that you got mad when you found out something re-traumatizing. That is a normal reaction. You’re allowed to make mistakes, kiddo. You’re still human. You just try not to make them again in the future. And remember…it’s not about your mistakes; it’s about how you handle them. And you have handled them beautifully.” He smiled when she finally relaxed in his arms – still hugging him tight.
“Steve?” May asked after putting the phone to her ear. “Yeah not a problem at all, Joey’s a delight. Uh huh. Well…that’s why I offered the tea, Steven,” she threw a wink at the teen, who felt herself calm down a little at that.
“Hey, just the girl I was looking for,” he said with a smile as she felt tears begin trickling down her cheeks. She leaned down to carefully embrace him, ignoring the questioning look on his face in favor of hugging him tight.
Granted, she was super proud that her dads are intersectional feminists, but none of the three had ever given her that feeling.
“What um...what’s happening right now? I…”
“Nice shot Katniss,” Tony said to the girl, who pinched her face back at him. “She...is a fictional character who shoots bow and arrows really well. Like how I sometimes call Clint ‘Legolas’,” Tony said with a wave of his hands.
“JARVIS is anyone awake?” he asked the AI once he got on the elevator to the tower, checking his watch to see it was half past six.
“Steven!” Tony cried out as the man ignored him in favor of walking back to the house. The brunette retaliated in kind by smacking the blonde’s ass, which only got him one in return. “Put me down you caveman!” he tried again, though the laughter was clear in his voice.
“Ah yes I’ve heard about you from my grandson. Nice to meet you, great-grandson,” Pappy said with a smile. Steve was conflicted when Harley grabbed Steve’s jeans, happy he was seeking comfort with him and sad he was seeking comfort in the first place. Harley was still clearly upset, which his grandfather quickly picked up on. “Who put a bee in your bonnet, lad? You look upset. Sad or mad?”
“Come on, baby,” Steve said, giving her head a quick kiss before opening the door. She followed him in, both sharing a chuckle that Tony and Peter were
His husband bit his lip and raised his arms up, making it easier for Steve take the shirt off completely. He smiled at the small scar on his husband’s chest as he gently shifted the man further up on the bed where he could lay them out.
Wade's smile at realizing Miles does in fact like his alter ego made Peter feel infinite love for his man and his siblings.
As everything faded to darkness, she heard Vivienne whisper the two words she hoped she’d never hear again.
“You should go tell your Pops! And your awful brother,” he said with a smile and a wink.
“Maybe I could…help you get out of your head for an hour?” he asked, hands trailing up the genius’ thighs. He was suddenly grateful they were the only two on board as autopilot continued their journey.
He wasn't some naïve teenager anymore.
…which means he can’t exactly openly kick their asses. The other students in the hallway had already formed a circle around the three.
“That was...that was so fucking hot,” Bucky growled with a smile before kissing the chuckling blonde again, the smaller teen wrapping his free arm around him in return. When he pulled pack, he couldn’t help staring incredulously at his boyfriend. “You sat on my lap on the ride over here, where did you hide the gun?”
“Marcus, you’re fired.”
“Yup,” he said leaning forward to kiss her forehead before he stood up. “What about you, sweetheart? I can stay if you need me to…”
“Anything I should be concerned about, Peter?”
When he heard nothing but silence, he took his jacket and shoes off before walking into the living room. There, on the floor, were two passed out beings that immediately brought a smile to the fourteen year old's face.
“See Steve? Stark. Like I said,” Tony said as he sat next to his husband, cuddling up to give Em space on the other side of his husband.
“Maria…”
“Tones, I know, okay? I know how difficult this all is for you, but screaming at your legal team instead of facing your husband is not helping you! And neither is a caffeine drink at nine o’ clock at night, Marcus,” she said with a glare in the assistant’s direction.
"You want a kitten instead of a party?" Steve asked.
“Hey kiddo, it’s Tony.”
“I don’t even know what to say Tones, that’s…
“Why don’t I get the warm welcome?” T’Challa asked in a teasing tone, knowing damn well why and chuckling when she simply glared at him. “I am here for a UN meeting and decided to drop by and see how my little sister is doing.”
And when his Omega let out a strangled growl, Steve knew he had won this round.
"It's only cause of Daci that I'm even
“They won’t let me in to see Dad,” she tattled, too overwhelmed with the anxiety of seeing him safe and alive to care how whiny she sounded.
scarier.”
“Want me to take him back?” Barnes offered, sitting on the ground next to the shorter brunette.
“Okay first of all - you’ve totally done that before. So don’t even go there. Secondly, I have to go get Harley and I’ll bring him here - so I’ll only be gone half an hour or so. Tell Pappy if he asks.”
“I have to say, I’m kind of surprised you came. Thought maybe you’d chicken out,” Tony said as he leaned back against his chair.
“He’s right, Tony,” Steve said getting his emotions back on track – face still flushed red. “I’m sorry you two…it um…won’t happen again,” he finished confessing with hand pinching the bridge of his nose, clearly embarrassed.
Tony smiled brightly at his husband, glad to see a little of his dirtiness rub off on the Captain.
“This is not my home,” she growled at the man, trying to use her brain-squishing power and feeling an electric shock for her trouble. That’s when she noticed a thin strap around her neck, unable to see it but feeling it’s presence and suddenly understanding its purpose.
Bucky frowned in confusion, settling his bag down and looking at Steve with a patient expression.
“Come here baby,” their mom said with a smile, picking the messy toddler up from behind Steve and placing her on her hip.
“See? I told you nature is the worst,” Tony grumbled as Steve carried him piggyback the mile back to their villa. The man had tripped over a goddamn tree root and rolled his ankle. Although, if he was being honest, he did not necessarily mind the ride…
And what the hell could Tony say to that? Nothing, is what he could say. Because the next instant he grabbed the sexy naked man by his face and brought him down to kiss him senseless. Goddamn, how Tony had gotten that completely wrong.
The mansion had a gorgeous indoor pool, and though she’d rather make everyone begin to pick out Halloween outfits, she conceded to joining them. Plus it would give her the opportunity to get to know her new foster-nephew better.
“I love you Joey,” he added for good measure, promising himself he’d say it more often. She squirmed a little in his lap, only to bury her head in his neck and wrap her arms around him again.
“There’s nothing to talk about,” Clint said angrily, pulling his knees up to his chest. Bucky couldn’t help sighing in frustration, not knowing how to navigate this situation and feeling frustrated with himself because of that.
The three adults had stopped talking, her dads pausing to look over at her for confirmation.
“Why do you think he left, Pete?”
“I’m ready to add another person to our team, my love. If that’s what she wants. You’ve seen how happy Peter is with her. And you know she needs this. And I think…I know we can do that for her. And I want to, Steve. I want to help her, protect her from one more animal putting his hands on her.” He takes a moment to breathe, burying down his growing frustration. “But only if you feel the same way, Steve. Long haul, remember?” he stopped himself from rambling any further, unsure what to say.
Steve stood there for another moment, hands on his hips as he tried to think about who Bucky’s crush could possibly be - since he never leaves the tower. And he must know Nat is with Bruce...or maybe he didn’t? Shaking his head of his thoughts, he wiped the counter before asking JARVIS to turn off the lights as he walked to his bedroom.
“Tony…”
That’s not the kind of Alpha Steve was.
After the ceremony they officially adopted each other’s kid, laughing as Peter excitedly removed the jacket of his tux in celebration.
Those words took two full seconds to register in his mind before he felt his anger begin to shift to the small child.
Steve nodded, giving himself some time to just breathe.
The weeks that followed were uneventful. Tony went back to school, and although he stayed away from Steve for a little bit, he gradually relaxed back into his presence, making jokes and laughing the way he used to. Steve and Tony were still closest, but Tony had made an unexpected bond with Loki. The two could often be found in the library, reading books of myths and languages Steve didn't even try to figure out. Tony and Peter could also be found together quite often, studying together or just joking around. Of course, he and Bruce could be found in the labs any moment they could. Steve was happy to see Tony bond with so many people, finding his own place in their makeshift family.
"You must be Antonio Stark," the pirate said.
As the boy made his way to his seat, Steve made eye contact with his best friend.
"That's it, I'm taking you to the vet," Tony decided out loud, grabbing Ana's leash. He hesitated as he saw her vest before deciding it wasn't necessary, leaving it behind. He walked back to his dog, talking softly to her. He didn't know if he was reassuring her or himself. He picked up his phone to look for the nearest animal shelter, sighing in relief when he saw there was one not too far away.
Natasha opened the door to Tony's dorm, knowing that's where he would go. She quietly closed the door behind her and made her way towards Tony's room. The door was ajar, and she pushed it open, expecting to see the young boy on his bed. She didn't expect to see him frantically throw his clothes into his suitcase, furiously wiping away the stubborn tears from his eyes.
That shut the archer up. Nat shook her head and kindly turned her gaze to Tony to explain the game.
"Thanks," Tony said with a small smile. Bruce smiled back, sincerely hoping Tony would take his advice.
Peter happily greeted FRIDAY as he entered the building, stepping into the elevator. FRIDAY welcomed him kindly, asking politely about his day.
"Alright, Pete. Who's the card for?" Nat interrupted before a food fight could get going.
Tony was lying on the pavement, his phone a small distance away from his limp hand. A puddle of blood was forming around him at an alarming rate as he lay unmoving on the sidewalk.
"Where were you planning on going?"
sorry, Nat," he choked out. "I-I wasn't thinking, I just-" he sighed, looking down at his feet. "I have no excuse. What I did was not okay. I didn't mean any of it." His voice broke, a fresh tear rolling down his face.
Tony grumbled something incoherently but didn't push Steve away, which the blonde counted as a win.
"Alright, I want you all to simply introduce yourself to your neighbor-- in Spanish, of course. Tell your name, where you're from, where you live now, your family, etc. Comenzar."
"Right. And the pit bull around 2 PM, that little ginger cat around 2.30, and the husky between 4 and 5."
"He did?" He squeaked. "What did he say?" May chuckled.
"Outsider buddies?" He asked, his adorable accent firmly back where it belonged. "I've never been buddies before. But I think I like it."
in Venezia. I learn language to speak with them. Molto bello."
The kiss lasted way longer than necessary. When they finally pulled back, both men were grinning as their foreheads rested together.
"Hi, it's May," she said softly into the phone. "I hope I'm not interrupting anything, but can I ask you a favor?"
"H-hi, Mr. Stark," he said softly, not really avoiding Tony's gaze but not meeting it, either.
Tony took a deep breath as he slowly walked towards his class, ahead of his friends. This morning had been tense, and he didn't know what to make of his friends' reactions. He thought they'd be happy that they no longer had to struggle to understand him and constantly correct his grammar. Was he not as good as he thought he was?
Tony nodded. "Different love," he said hoarsely.
"Tony." He licked his lips, unsure of how to start. "Tony, I need you to be honest with me, okay? Really honest. If there's questions you don't want to answer then that's fine, but we need to talk about this, okay?" At Tony's nod, he took another deep breath.
Steve took another look at the lump of sandwich in Tony's hand before shaking his head. He took the bag from the boy's hand and threw it in the trash. Before Tony even knew what was going on, Steve was gently steering him towards the cafeteria.
"No, you're not. The fact that you think you are is exactly what worried me. We're going home now, but we
. Tony didn't know why, but thinking of Steve made him happy- happier than thinking of his other friends. He'd felt guilty at first for liking Steve more than the others but then realized that was just because Steve was his
"You have to tell us about your most embarrassing moment from your childhood,"
Before he entered, Steve decided to see what was happening inside, and what he saw melted his heart.
"Follow me," Coulson said before leaving the principal's office, Tony hurrying after him. They were silent on the way there. Tony was a bit confused but also too shy to ask questions. Soon they exited the large school building and were walking across the open space Tony had spent lunch with Steve and the others. Once they reached the other side, Tony saw staircases leading towards what looked a lot like apartment doors. Some students were milling about on the stairs or crossing over to each other's rooms. Coulson led Tony up two staircases and two doors down, almost at the end of the hall, before they came to a halt in front of door 203. A quick look told Tony this hall started at 204 and ended at 200. He figured that if he crossed the bridge-like connection between this hall and the next, it would continue counting up.
"Trust me, Cap, I have survived on a lot less hours than this,"
Too worried to fall back asleep, he got out of bed, tiptoeing through his room to put on some more presentable clothes, suddenly hyper-aware of his looks. Shaking his head with a sigh, he left his apartment.
"You not hear me? I call your name, like three times!" Steve avoided his gaze. "Anyway, you missed history when you go to the nurse, so I make your notes. I have them in my bag!"
“Do you know about the War? The Civil War in America, I mean?” Steve asked.  It seemed like an entirely stupid question to ask of such a creature, and yet...and yet.  “I know I talk about it some. The War. Which is--well, that’s neither here nor there, I guess. But, do you--have you heard of it?  Know of it? I keep going on, and,” he broke off with a sigh, running his hand through his hair. “I sometimes think you understand far more than you possibly should, and then I think maybe I’m crazy and just lonely and
Thoughts like that were probably the reason Tony didn’t even notice the woman until she was shoving a handful of papers and pictures under his nose.
Tony dropped the silken cloth into the fire.  Steve half-expected to feel some kind of burning pang, but nothing happened.  He wondered if it even worked.  Could whatever this was between them truly be torn asunder so easily? Standing here with Tony, he wanted to believe it couldn’t, but Tony clearly thought this would work. Hoped it would work.  Hoped it would finally set him free from a promise he made to a child all those years ago, and who was Steve to try to force his hand into something more?  He’d asked for a night, and if that was all he wanted, Steve couldn’t bring himself to try to use whatever remained between them to demand more.
“What do you do there?”  Steve asked, trying for a subject change.
life.  What a fucking joke.  It had never been his life, not his own, not in the way that he imagined it must be for other people. He was someone else now, but he’d never really been him, so what did it matter?  They’d sloughed off his entire identity and given him another with the stroke of a pen, and were too busy patting themselves on the back for their sheer awesomeness to notice Tony’s world crumbling in on him.
Tony lunged for the door, nearly knocking his knee on the coffee table as he went. Steve was rounding the steps by the time Tony got out the door, though he slowed when he saw Tony appear.
It wasn’t long before he felt Steve’s body tightened and stiffen around him. Tony kept pumping his hand up and down, shifting his hips down and then up slightly, gently at first, then two hard pumps so that his knot hit right up against Steve’s prostate. Steve’s back arched as he threw his head back and screamed, the walls of his passage clenching around Tony’s cock like a vice as Steve came into Tony’s hand in stuttering, jerky movements. Tony heard himself shout as well, the sharp, quick contraction of Steve’s channel as it squeezed around him enough to send spirals of pleasure-pain through his cock as Steve’s body vibrated with his orgasm.
“Not a problem,” Tony said under his breath, hoping it was true.
“I don’t, true.  But, I know Steve.  I think. And you’re his best friend. Ride or die.  I get that, ‘cause that guy over there,” Tony said, nodding at Rhodes, “spent three months looking for me in the desert, even when they told him to stop, and I kind of think that you’d do the same for Steve.  Which, you may have guessed, kind of counts for something with me. Look, fine, you’re not perfect. Who is? Probably none of the people we’d be trying to help, I’m guessing. All of this…maybe it’s something good that can come out of all the crap that got slung your way by people who are supposed to be looking out for guys like you.  And Steve. Plus, it’s my money. Now, raise your glasses,” Tony ordered, reaching around for a bottle of beer from the row on the kitchen counter and popping the top off. “Good, okay, that’s more like it. To BARF! Come on, come on, everyone, glasses up! Sourpatch, where’s your toast?”
After breakfast, Steve announced he wanted to swim, which turned out to entail him floating on the gently lapping surf while Tony hovered above in the armor, presumably watching out for sharks or dolphins with consent issues, Steve wasn’t sure. He didn’t really mind, though. There was something comforting about Tony’s presence, and the motion of the waves, letting him just float there, filling his ears with the steady rush of noise, the sun warming his skin. It was soothing. Well, except for the skin cancer risk, he thought wryly.
Tony groaned deep in the back of his throat, sending vibrations along the length of Steve’s shaft.  He thrust again and felt his cock slip into the back of Tony’s throat, the muscles working as Tony swallowed around it.  Tony’s mouth slipped off Steve’s cock with a wet, smacking sound, while Steve struggled to draw a breath.  Pleasure-pain throbbed along his length. A mix of saliva and a thicker, pale substance coated him where Tony’s mouth had been.  Everything felt tight and hot, with a steady wall of pressure pushing its way down to the head of his cock in waves.
“You know, I almost bought it, hook, line and sinker,” the woman said.
“Are--are we dating?” Steve broke in, sending Tony to a stuttering halt.  Steve turned to look at him from across the living room while Tony’s mouth opened and closed around words that refused to come out.  “You—you seem to know a lot about me.  The museum, the fondue, baseball.  You said we’re friends, and, okay, some of that, sure, but at the gala the other night…you knew.  That I was…that I wanted to leave.  Then you, with the,” he said, waving his hand in the air, which apparently was meant to indicate the fuck-up of a kiss.  “And  tonight…tonight, you knew things…things I wouldn’t just…you knew about me,” Steve ground out, frustration and confusion leaking into his tone. “About Bucky and…and you knew me.”
She had a monkey.  On a golden leash.
Nat welcomed him into the apartment with a cup of hot cocoa spiked with some kind of sweet flavored vodka, no questions asked, and a long hug that spoke of a deep understanding.  Steve spent the rest of the night curled up on Bucky and Nat’s couch, though he slept surprisingly well, all things considered.
“I just spent an entire afternoon on BARF, Tony. BARF.  Don’t you dare—” she began.
He looked down and realized that he had nearly eaten the entire plate of food and felt a flush of embarrassment creep up his neck and warm his face.  When he looked up again, Tony was watching him with an expression of such hunger that almost made Steve draw back.  Tony’s lips were red, Steve noticed.  Dark and pink against the whiteness of his skin.  Steve blinked and looked back down at the nearly empty plate.  What was wrong with him?  It was surely impolite to stare, and certainly not appropriate to think about the man’s lips.  He should have insisted Tony eat something, too, instead of scarfing down the man’s food.  Even though Tony certainly appeared wealthy, who knew how difficult it was to get food up here? Steve’s mother would box his ears for such rudeness, surely.
Steve thought it was supposed to be soothing.
“Disobey me again and find out,” Tony replied, then grinned wickedly, waggling his eyebrows in an exaggerated motion.   Steve rolled his eyes. “I saw that.” He gave Steve’s ass a sharp, stinging slap, making Steve jump and hiss, then bent over and placed a quick kiss to the curve of Steve’s hip, smiling teasingly up at Steve.  “I knew you would be trouble the moment I saw you. I swear, I have never seen anyone kneel with less obeisance,” he laughed up at Steve, shaking his head at the memory. “You looked like one of those wild beasts, crouched down about to pounce and tear my throat out.  Naturally, I wanted you right away.”
“Ask Cam, if you must,” Steve interrupted sharply.  “He will answer your questions truthfully.  Ask about how they brought him a white wrap to wear.  Ask about how Zola didn’t have the overseer prepare him as he did me, because that was how Stane wanted him.  Ask the other boys who are still at the compound, if Zola hasn’t already gotten rid of all of them.  Ask the other children who hide there, trying to go unnoticed, what it is they do for Zola!” Steve finished, his voice raising to nearly a shout.  At Tony’s fathomless expression, Steve stopped.
“You think too much,” Cam said, tucking the folds of the gown into place with an annoyed frown. “The King would agree with this, I think.”
Beat up was a bit of an understatement. Out here, he could see the extent of the damage to the ship.  There was a sizeable chunk missing, and the parts around the blast were warped and blackened. Whatever had happened, whatever tiny error, slight misstep, or random set of circumstances it was that set off the explosion, whatever he had missed, it had a sense of inevitability to it now, Tony thought as he floated.
“This is nice,” Steve offered instead.
“He always took care of me, my David,” Charles replied.  They were approaching a pair of tall, wooden-paneled double doors, flanked by a doorman in a pristine black tuxedo, with a gold plaque next to the right door signifying they had reached their destination.  “Now, I get to take care of him.”
“See?  Something in common already,” Stark replied.  “A…shared life experience, you might say.  I’m told those are…very important,” Stark said, mouth twisting into something of a pained grimace.
“Only because you’re too stubborn to just admit you’re stupid in love with Tony Stark,” Bucky retorted.
The stories.  He remembered the stories, after all.  Truth or tale, they came from somewhere.  Here, Steve thought with a start.  They came from here.  The lights. The sounds.  This is the lair of the Shadowman, where he takes the naughty children he steals in the night.  Except, of course, it wasn’t.  That was a story, nothing more. He was going off to war soon. A soldier. Not a terrified child running from his father’s wrath.
“MIT?  College?  Tony…what are you talking about?” Jarvis asked quietly, but firmly.
“Yes.  I’m sure, Tony.  Please,” Steve pleaded, his voice thick and watery.  He wanted this.  God help him, he wanted this so much.  Tony. Iron Man. The man on the road.
“You wascally wabbit,” Tony huffed out as they raced for a second door at the end of the hallway. He heard a shriek of metal behind them, and realized it was the door being thrown open. A quick clatter of boots on metal followed. “Elmer Fudd’s on our tail,” he shouted. Something pinged off the wall next to his ear, and he zigged, grabbing for Steve, who was lagging too far behind. “Come on, come on, just a bit further,” Tony urged. Technically, he didn’t know what was beyond the door in front of them, except it put one more barrier between them and their pursuers, and right now, he’d take that. Tony ripped open the door in front of them and shoved Steve through it, slamming it shut behind them and searching in vain for a locking mechanism.
“Guys, guys, not in the living room, please!” Clint called.  “Though, if you wanted to in here, we could leave.  No.  Wait.  Damn it.”
Steve slowed and pointed, nudging his elbow gently into Tony’s arm to direct him to what had Steve’s attention.  A cannon, mounted on a large, wheeled wagon, appeared to have come apart into its various pieces. The vent piece that screwed into the touch hole was laying next to the trunnions that served to mount the cannon to its carriage. The rimbases and reinforce ring were also laying almost carefully next to one of the carriage’s wheels. The canonical chase of the cannon itself sat in the grass with a few broken muzzle rings.
Vampire Tony meets Steve and irrevocably changes the courses of both of their lives
, then I can say, hey, that’s a little because of me, too.  Not just all the shit, you know? Not—not to pressure you or—God, Steve, you know I just want you to be happy, right?” Bucky said, mouth twisting around the words.
“Have you changed the picture yet?” Rhodey asked by way of greeting.
“They don’t get every part of me,” Tony replied, ducking his head down for a moment, then looking back up at Steve as they walked.  “Not many people do. Not many people want to,” he added after a moment, looking away.
“I’m just building crew.  They have special cleaners for the labs,” Steve replied, then looked over at Tony, flattening his mouth a bit, before giving up and continuing.  “You crazy college kids did get up to some seriously questionable hygienic practices,” Steve recalled with a touch of wry fondness.  “Still can’t figure out the piano in the second floor supply closet at Wiesner.  Which, that part was weird, sure, and physically impossible, but why the stuffed penguin?  That kept me up nights.”
“Daniel!” Maria scolded with a light laugh.  “Well, at least he talks to you two.  And Jarvis, of course. Always, Jarvis and Ana.”
They sat there in the still, silent limo for a moment, hands wound together on the space between them, which maybe said something about their relationship that Tony didn’t want to think about too hard.  Steve made no move to get out or extricate his hand from Tony’s.  Instead, he flexed his fingers, curling them tightly underneath Tony’s and held on.
“Come on. Let’s get you home,” Steve urged, turning Tony towards the SUV when the black-clad driver hopped out to open the door.
“Yes—yes, I swear it,” Lady Bain managed while the man kneeling next to her choked off a sob.  “Thank you.  You are most merciful.”
Of course, it all comes back to Tony.  Who ditched him.  Apparently, something in his penthouse holds more fascination for him than Steve.  Steve sighed and placed the Iron Man poster back on the table.
Tony was gone when he woke, but Steve could hear the camp stirring already. The day of the demonstration dawned early, with the sun barely peeking over the distant mountaintops and just starting to ripple over the sands when Steve first ducked out of the tent. They still had a ways to travel to reach the site General Ross had chosen for the Jerak’ho’s demonstration, and the camp was already a hive of activity as servants and slaves hurried to pack and soldiers readied themselves for the long walk next to the caravan.
It was cozy, Tony would give it that.  Long wooden booths along the large front window were sparsely occupied.  Scattered tables covered in red-checked tablecloths under real candles sitting in cream-colored saucers.  A line of wine bottles sat atop the chair railing and circled half the room.  Posters of Italy, mostly the stock kind of the Coliseum, Forum and the Leaning Tower, decorated the walls, but it was cheery and smelled promising.
“He’s never walked away from a fight.  He’s not walking away from this one,” Tony replied, keeping his eyes on Steve’s face, thumb running rhythmically back and forth over the back of Steve’s hand.  “He wouldn’t do that,” Tony finished with a firm nod.
“Yeah,” Steve shrugged.
This one isn’t quiet, Steve thought to himself, and felt his chest tighten with warmth.  Troublemaker, Steve mentally repeated, the thought almost seeming to float in his head on a bubble of a laugh.
“Calm down, Outbreak, geez,” Rhodey grimaced, but handed Tony the binoculars.
.  Guilt, probably, Steve assumed.  It just…it felt so good to be
“Neural translator?” Tony questioned.  The alien reached up and rubbed at a spot behind his ear, and Tony mimicked the motion, feeling a tiny bump there that hadn’t been there before.  “Huh. Imagine that. Wow, so you....wow. How’d you even know my name?”
Tony’s hand came up to cup Steve’s jaw, holding him there, and his tongue darted out to taste.  Steve wasn’t sure which one of them surged forward, deepening the kiss, maybe both of them, all he felt was Tony suddenly up against him, flush with his chest, legs tangling, hands roaming, just Tony, all around him. It was heady, overwhelming, almost too much, all at once.  It had been so long. So long since he had been able to let someone touch him like this, and now, it was like he couldn’t get close enough to Tony.
“What’s not exactly a squire?” Cam asked.
“I have a flying suit. I’m sure I’d save us before we actually crashed. I know this jet is technically one of a kind, but I honestly don’t give a fuck,” Tony replied.
“Dinner tonight?  To celebrate, knock on wood.  Do we have wood here?  That…sounded dirtier than I meant,” Tony said with a teasing grin.  “Though…technically, my pre-meeting doesn’t start for another hour, so…”
“Hey,” Steve said, laughing good-naturedly.  “No fair.”
“What’s going on here?” Steve asked as he stepped out of the elevator and came to a halt, four heads swiveling towards him.
Tony had changed into a pair of loose-fitting drawstring pants.  There was a damp spot just to the left of the groin.  Steve leaned over and mouthed ati it, sucking lightly on the fabric. “God, Steve. Fuck.  Fuck. Fuck,” Tony repeated, letting his eyes fall shut, then snapping them open, as if he was unable to look away from the image Steve presented.  He felt Tony’s fingers wind through his hair, petting more than anything, Steve realized.
“What part of ‘I like him and made him a mixtape’ is not an emergency?” Tony demanded through clenched teeth.  He cast a quick look at Steve, who was checking his own phone, then turned away again, nodding at two startled women as they exited the restroom.
A woman with piles of hair the color of obsidian coiled on top of her head, dark, almond-shaped eyes above a light dusting of freckles, a small straight nose, pierced with a twinkling stud that connected by a chain to the curve of her ear, and wide, generous lips that pursed together as she watched Steve enter the pool sat to his right.  To his left, two men, one of them, with skin the color of sand and seemingly no hair anywhere at all, bigger than Steve by at least two hands, one thin and milk-skinned, though dotted with more color than Steve had ever seen, and had hair like fire over eyes as green as grass.  Next to them, another girl, younger than the other woman, plump-cheeked with a mouth that curved into a ready smile and eyes that danced merrily as Steve entered the water. They were leaning close together, their laughter and talk ceasing as soon as they looked up, one after the other, and saw Steve.  He sank into the pool and sat on the stone bench opposite the woman, returning her curious stare.
Tony gripped Steve’s hips, making Steve let out a cry, then drew back until his cockhead caught on Steve’s rim and thrust all the way in again.  He set a hard, pounding rhythm, fingers digging into Steve’s ass as he held him in place.  Steve could hear the slap of flesh on flesh, the only sound other than the occasional guttural grunt from Tony.  It would be over fairly quickly, Steve thought, though he didn’t really care.  It didn’t seem to matter.  The count was done.  He could just
“Hey, ah, so--so whoa there,” Tony breathed out in a harsh rush of words. It hurt to say them, for some reason. Not physically hurt, but hurt, a deep pang inside his chest that made him want to take them back.   The alien paused where he was kneeling between Tony’s legs and looked up at Tony with what could only be described as a questioning look.
“Do you understand better what I meant about punishment?” Tony questioned, raising his eyes to Steve’s.  “I won’t tell you that there is never pain, but punishment, when properly administered, can bring you to pleasure in a different way.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You already are, Tony,” Steve said, brow furrowing into a confused frown.
Okay, then.  Steve felt something low and heavy settle in the pit of his stomach, some sort of odd anticipation that he wasn't sure if it was about getting it over or something else. Moving up the bed, he saw that Tony had left a pillow in the middle, and he had the absurd thought that this was thoughtful.  He lay down on his stomach with the pillow under his hips and turned his head in Tony’s direction.  He felt Tony’s hand run through his hair and then Tony was moving to position himself behind him.  He spread his legs to give him access and felt Tony nudge his knee up, then lean down to press a kiss to his hipbone.  “It’ll be easier this way,” Tony said quietly, his voice low and strained, as if every word took effort.  Steve nodded and shifted his knees up, spreading himself further.   He heard Tony rustle about in the bed and the squelch of the tube again.  He couldn’t help but tense up as he felt Tony’s hand rub gently over the cleft of his ass, but he didn’t move away, didn’t so much as twitch when a finger was pressed into him to the knuckle, but instead forced his body to relax and allow the intrusion.  Tony pushed his finger further in, and it felt odd, true, but not bad-odd, just different and then he moved it and
"Fa male," he sobbed softly. "It hurts."
Tony sighed, running a hand through his messy hair before leaning back on the table. Peter carefully came closer, only to stop after a few steps. He had no idea what to do.
His brother, Loki, was an even bigger mystery. He had an accent like his brother, but he was quiet, slim and basically the exact opposite of his sibling. Where Thor was big and loud, Loki was slim and quiet. And where Thor was happy and outgoing, Loki seemed mostly irritated and secretive. The only thing besides the accent that they had in common was the fact that Steve knew they were both good people, even if Loki didn't want anyone else to see.
"What is it?" He asked softly. The silence that followed made Steve doubt he would get a reply, but Tony eventually took a deep breath and opened his mouth to speak. The response that came out, however, was too soft and too jumbled together for even Steve's enhanced hearing to understand. "What?" He couldn't help but blurt out. Tony rolled his eyes but spoke a bit louder when he tried again.
He was sitting on the ceiling, throwing a tennis ball on the ground and catching it as it bounced back. He had been doing this for over ten minutes now, as he had previously been shooting webs at the wall until one of the neighbors had yelled through the walls for him to stop.
Sì: yes
"Right," he confirmed. Tony was still hesitant.
"Anytime, Tony. Anytime."
"I'm sorry, mi dispiace, I'm sorry," Tony cried, rocking back and forth as he hugged his knees closer.
There was a soft knock on the door which had both men look up. Steve was standing awkwardly in the doorway, looking way too much like a kicked puppy.
Clint watched it happen from up in the vents. He bit his tongue to stop himself from interfering when Steve reminded Tony of Nat's file. Nat's
"No," Peter simply repeated, and before the mechanic could reply again, he added; "You're not okay,"
"Thanks, Friday."
Tony gave him a strange look, almost shocked. He quickly recomposed himself and smiled.
"Shut up, Barton."
"I see you've met Steve," she nodded towards her star pupil, who looked up from his frantic writing about the second world war to smile at her.
"I- I don't-" Tony stuttered, taking a step back as Steve loomed over him.
Also I will point out that although this is a primarily Tony/Steve based story I aim to introduce many characters and many relationship dynamics. It will be a slow build, I am not going to jump straight into their adulthood here as I have the story in my head and it wouldn't work if I skipped the background.
"What are you drawing?" Tony asked casually. Looking at the many lines on the page and how Steve moved his hand so gracefully.
The first year living in that mansion the young pup made it his mission to explore every hiding spot, every room, every secret area. Soon it was no longer his mother who put him to bed, or made his breakfast. Very soon he got used to only seeing his father coming in and out of his office (which was a strike no pup zone) or in and out of the house. His mother hired to help of a Beta from the pack, a man named Jarvis and Anthony got used to seeing more of that man than he did his own parents.
"Do you often draw Thor? Does Spangles have a crush?" He teased, but his voice was laced with warm fondness for his friend.
~~~ RainbowStar ~~~
Anthony didn't know what to do and so innocently reached out and offered the pup some berries.
With the birth of their children began the birth of our modern age, an age of Alpha’s, Omega’s, Beta’s who can walk the earth in their human skins as well as on all fours like the wolves we are at heart”
Another few hours passed and Tony was so cold, even with Steve holding him tightly like that and rocking them back and forth it seemed that it was too cold even for the human water bottle.
"Howard? What is it? is it your father?" She whispered, keeping her voice low to stop from waking their son.
Steve just rolled his eyes and abandoned his pencil to wrap an arm around Tony's shoulders, tugging him a little closer in nothing more than an affectionate gesture, "no, I've got a sketch of you all look ..." He flicked through the sketchbook, showing Tony his many different pictures from Natasha, in a mid kick in the gym to Clint perched up on a rooftop. There was Bruce messy haired and studying and Tony, grinning and clad in red.

“The legend goes that long ago, hundreds if not thousands of years before now a human female found herself lost in the deepest darkest depths of the woods. Humanity was on the verge of extinction their food resources were dwindling, their inability to hunt effectively left most of them starving, leading to violence. How this female had managed to stray so far from her tribe into the wilderness it wasn’t known but she did and there in the dark she saw a pair of big amber eyes. They stared right into her soul, as if this creature were seeing something beyond what human eyes could, she had sat there frozen, tears streaming down her face. Lost and scared. Upon determining her distress and her lack of threat the owner of those eyes stepped out of the undergrowth to reveal himself. Fur was as black as night, fangs as sharp as knives. He was an Alpha, a wolf of the woodland pack. He’d been watching the girl, he’d become fascinated and almost felt pity on her soul and maybe just maybe he had seen something special when he’d gazes at her from the dark. This was the beginning of something new. Lost and alone the female allowed herself to trust this animal who approached her so gently, climbing up onto his back so he could carry her back to his pack.
Howard nodded his head and with a sigh he brought his hand up to pinch the bridge of his nose, "He's gone" he whispered, "fever has finally taken him". Silence hung between them for a moment because they both knew what it meant although the alpha wanted to leave it just a couple more moments before he said it out loud.
He quickly came to realise that his father was too busy to play, in turn his mother grew to tired to tell him his bedtime stories. He did ask his mother one day what it was his father did, why he was always working so hard as a young pup he didn't understand. Maria had looked down at him with soft, kind eyes and said "Your daddy loves you so much my little Anthony, but he has big responsibilities now. He can't just look after you and me anymore. He has to look after everyone". To a child though this didn't mean anything. As a child all he knew was that his parents didn't have the time. Didn't want to play and for an only pup who had previously always had the spotlight in his parents lives it grew to be a little frustrating.
There was no problem though, they found the source, they analyzed it and then they began their journey down. Their journey down however wasn't nearly as easy as their journey up. They got caught, in a terrible snow storm that climbed the mountains. The wind whistled and struck their faces. Tony's nose was blue and for the first time Steve found something that reminded him of that ice cold water.
Anthony continued through his eyes quickly adjusting to the dark as his wolf senses took over and his eyes shifted from his human chocolatey brown ones to his amber wolf ones. The young pup made no question to why this voice was alone in the cave but he followed it anyway and eventually, a few metres more into the dark and Anthony could see the form of a boy in the dark maybe only a year or two older than himself though the boy was thin and scrawny, blonde hair dark from filth.
Anthony was more than excited, he was wrapped up in a coat and mittens and told that he had to stay close to the butler at all times otherwise he wouldn't be allowed out again. What Jarvis didn't realise was that the young pup took that as a personal challenge.
"SOMEONE HAS BEEN MESSING WITH THE BOILER!" Came a screech which brings us to the next time the two shared a cuddling moment.
They did go for that coffee and eventually Steve became Tony's human hot water bottle til death do them part.
Of course they were found, Bruce caught onto the weather later on and they sent a shield rescue jet for them. They were both freezing but after examination it was concluded that they couldn't possible of survived that long in the cold if they hadn't had each other's body temperatures. Steve just looked at Tony and smiled. Tony smiled back.
This story is a work in progress. I cannot for definite say how long it is going to be, I cannot for definite say how regularly I will be posting. I am going to try and post at least once every week or so. I aim to have quite lengthy chapters so I hope they will be worth the wait.
"What on earth are you doing Capiscle can't you feel how cold it is in here?" He pondered. Shaking a little under the chill. To which Steve just shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.
A figure appeared at the bedroom door, a man (an alpha) dressed in a tailored suit a half crooked smile on his face as he took in the sight before him; "Are you filling that boys head full of stories again Maria?". His name was Howard, and he looked there before him at his bonded mate and their boy and it was probably one of the most perfect sights not that the likes of Howard would ever admit such a thing out loud, especially with the news he had to bring. He was after all a private alpha, kept himself to himself as much as possible didn't cause any trouble mostly because of what was coming.
It was clear in that moment that the blonde had spent many days in that cave, Anthony furrowed his brow in confusion at why they were in a cave alone instead of in a town like his own, in a house like his own but he was only young and hadn't been taught about the world around him properly this was his first contact with two rogue wolves it seemed. Normally rogue wolves were wild and dangerous but the pup just seemed scared and worried as he stroked his mothers back, his mother who was barely alive in some sort of fevered sleep.
The story could be heard in the whispers of the wind as a mother told her child the legend of their beginning, in the heart of the forest where nature met man kind their settlement was the perfect combination of all that was natural and man-made. Their lives evolved around both aspects of their being, their human bodies walked the town together, their hands built their town, their building and their shifted forms could roam free, could hunt and play. Whether the love story was true or not, whether there ever had been only wolves and human as separate beings (though many doubted it as nobody had ever been shown to be human, everyone could shift) the story of true love and of the first true bond was one that warmed many hearts. The little pup who laid in his bed eyes fluttering closed with a smile on his face believed there was nothing better than being in the heart of the forest, surrounded by the bristle of trees. There certainly couldn't be anything better than a pup being able to drift off to the sound of his mothers voice on the air and her scent so warm and comforting that it eclipsed all else.
Tony got up from his place on the floor and headed out the front door to the deck.  He stopped, just above where the small stream flowed from the rocks under the wooden planks, and gripped the railing with both hands, tilting his head back.  Without the city lights, the stars seemed closer somehow. Brighter.  Like someone had strung those pointy Christmas lights around the world and they were pushing their tips through the dark expanse of sky.
“He says that you may build whatever you like,” Yinsen told him, his face coloring a bit.  “He says an Omega who builds is very, ah.  Very unusual, I think you would say.  Very…very special,” Yinsen continued, clearing his throat.  “He will see that you have what you need to build, and he will carry what you build with him, and this will be…ah, this will be an–an honor, I think he means.”
He opened his eyes the barest amount he thought he could get away with, then closed them again.  It was dark.  A single light floated somewhere off to his side, giving off just enough light to make out the two figures where their shadows moved against a large window that had the blinds pulled closed.  The voices echoed a bit, which meant a large space.  The air was cool. Cooler than regular air conditioning would be, and other than the voices, it was quiet except for the rush of air.
Tony followed Happy back towards the ballroom.  People greeted him as he entered, though Happy was pretty good by now at keeping the throngs far enough back.  Tony nodded at Rhodey, and stopped to say hello to Matt and Foggy.
“Have we…met?” Rhodey asked, a slight frown marring his expression.
“I know,” Steve replied.  Tony wasn’t sure which statement he was replying to, though he supposed it didn’t matter.
“We both made mistakes,” Steve acknowledged.
“Noble,” Zola said, brushing his hand across the front of his robe, as if removing imagined dirt.  “Stupidly futile, of course.  The boy will be put to use, whether it is tonight or some other time.  But, I’m afraid, even were I inclined to consider your offer, you are not Lord Stane’s preferred choice of companionship, shall we say?  Now, time to go.  I suggest you remember your manners tonight.  Lord Hammer is known to have something of a temper when he is displeased.”
“It’s even better inside.  You’ll like it,” Tony replied, and Steve could hear the fondness in his voice.  Steve supposed if he had a house like this, he’d be pretty proud of it, too.  Money could buy lots of things, but certainly not taste or the willingness to create something spectacular and beautiful.  And there was no denying what this house was.  Art.  Any other time and he’d be giddy to go inside and explore.  He turned to Tony to say something to that effect, but stopped himself when he found Tony’s liquid brown eyes staring at him instead of the house, seeming to drink him in and Steve blinked, caught off guard for a moment.  Of course, it was his house, so he was probably used to it by now.  It wouldn’t be a big deal to him.  No telling what he would think if Steve started waxing poetic about Gehry’s influence.
“Maybe I just
do this.  Scare him.  Probably, it would.  But, hearing them talk about Tony like that, Steve thought it hurt Tony in some indefinable way that he could barely see, let alone understand. Whatever it was, he didn’t like it.
“Sir, I am currently unable to take orders from you. And I should tell you that one more word from you will likely result in my protocols requiring me to report you to the F.B.I., New York Police Department, SHIELD, and possibly the D.E.A.,” JARVIS informed him.
“I’ll take care of it,” Steve snapped.  “Just…give me a minute, okay?  Can you do that?” he asked, looking between Barnes and Tony.  Tony watched Steve sigh, then turn and head into the small bedroom, shaking his head.
"Which would all be well and good, maybe of interest to the IRS, but not exactly under our purview," Fury continued, "except AIM has been funneling tech and money to a terrorist organization known as Hydra. Hydra has been funding and supplying wars and things we don’t call war all over the world since sometime just after the First World War.  We sent Agent Romanov in to infiltrate the club, see what she could find out about our players. Agent Barton volunteered.”
“You don’t have to, really.  I can do it.   I should probably just—“ Tony began, then cut himself off.  He had kept Steve away from his life once before, and how had that turned out?  “Sorry.  Habit.  I’ll grab my tablet.”
Steve could feel Tony near him, standing where he had been at the edge of the deck, looking out over the mountains as if lost in thought.  The delivery man didn’t look his way, of course. That was good. Steve could still taste the metallic bitterness in the back of his throat, salty and co--no. No, it wasn’t salty.  It wasn’t cold. He swiped a hand over his face.  The urge to pummel something until he could feel his knuckles tear so he knew he wasn’t dreaming pounded through him.  So, yeah. He thought it was probably good the delivery driver didn’t look at Tony.
“Okay, so, can I just say that, a lot of what you may have possibly heard, that was probably from the TV,” Barnes said, holding up his good hand in front of himself.
,” Anthony repeated.  “
“Tony likes it when Steve does all that romantic bullshit.  Loves it.  Completely falls for it.  The cheesier, the better,” Rhodey said.
“Excuse me?” Howard snorted.
“He knew how I'd react,” Tony said in a dim, faint whisper. “That I wouldn't look far enough.”
, but Cam was right there.  He suspected Tony knew that, too.  Tony knew that Steve was suffering. He was up there thinking about it.  Doing his duty, playing his role, and thinking about Steve. That thought, almost more than anything else, burned bright inside Steve, sending a thrill of desire straight to the head of his cock.  He could imagine it, bulging against the gold bars of the cage, a deep, angry red, the vein on the underside throbbing with need.  He wondered if Tony was imagining it, too.
“Yes.  Well. If he’s going to be like
“Steve,” Tony’s voice rang out from the stable entrance as he very clearly tried to measure his steps, sounding more like a prayer or a benediction than a name. “You’re late,” Tony accused lightly, flashing a grin, his whole gait and posture shifting to something far more predatory as he approached.
Rebecca and Sugar exchanged a look, faces flat and expressionless. Social tiers colliding, Tony thought, as the dance of politeness continued.  It was strange, Tony thought. Even amongst ourselves, we scrabble for scraps of power.  Maybe that wasn’t so strange, when you thought about it.
“Sam’s not everyone.  He’s a friend,” Steve replied, looking sharply at Brock. “It’s important to me, Brock.”
Steve ignored him and started unstrapping his bedroll from behind the saddle, while the horse pawed at the ground with its front hooves. He ran a soothing hand up and down the horse’s neck, patting it gently, then went back to undoing his pack where it was attached to the saddle on top of his bedroll.
“They’re giving us the Presidential Suite tonight,” Tony reminded him.  Steve nodded and swallowed thickly.
“Right.  Obie takes the junk specs to Pierce.  Pierce turns it over to the obviously bad guys, and boom!  We’ve got them straight up sharing tech with a terrorist organization.  Steve here and I have a very amicable ‘divorce,’” Tony said, flashing air-quotes with his fingers.  “Simple.”
Through the glass panes that surrounded the room, Tony could see grey-coated agents working on various projects.  A holo-table floated blue schematics of what looked like part of a turbine engine in front of a group of agents, one of whom pointed at a spot with a thin metal stick, causing the schematic to instantly zoom in.
“Uncomfortable with that idea. I don’t know.  You’re just—all you and…and stuff,” Tony stuttered.   It wasn’t that he hadn’t thought about it.  Of course, he had thought about it.  Hell, he’d thought about it since he was a teenager.  What it would feel like, what Steve would look like, the sounds he would make, how it would be to be the one that Steve trusted enough to want to do that with…so, yeah, he’d given it some cursory thought.
An image of his old room in his parents’ house came unbidden to his mind.  His dorm at college. His workshop at the Malibu house. Home, he thought, and saw himself, as if from above, curled in a pink cocoon that shone with a soft light, the alien wrapped around him with his forehead pressed against the back of Tony’s skull.
The King blinked at him, then walked around the table and sat down heavily in his chair, cupping his head in his hand and massaging at his temples.
Then he realized he hadn’t seen Tony in a suit since that first night, when he’d been so nervous he’d barely been able to string words together, let alone appreciate anything about how Tony looked. There was a strange, fleeting expression of almost fondness that floated across Tony’s face, lost before it ever actually settled there, and Steve wondered, not for the first time, how Tony remembered that first night, when he’d brought Steve home and asked for only what Steve chose to give.
“I…actually have a lot of…flexibility with my schedule.  Maybe put Europe off for another time, but, one day.  Soon.   If you wanted,” Steve replied, then cleared his throat when Tony remained silent.  “Speaking of, ah, trips, I was going to go into town again at some point, maybe pick up a few things at that shopping mall there.  Happy said you two stopped by?  Uh, there’s a—end of next month—there’s this gala, ah, thing, that Fury wants me—us--to attend.  Not a big deal,” Steve said, in the way that said it probably was a big deal.
He was big. Tony knew that from when he had cared for Steve’s injured leg, though he had tried not to look. That would have been impolite. Still, he’d had to help Steve make his water at first, and so he knew Steve was big.  Bigger than Tyber. But, Tony was so empty, like a wide, open vessel, and there was this deep, unceasing ache inside him. Whatever fear he had was gone, faded to dust and left behind, along with everything else. He was Tony now, and Tony loved Steve, and Steve shared Pleasures with Tony, and it was good.  Tony knew it would be good.
“You’re so going to hell,” Rhodey said.
Please give me something.
Anto sighed.  He wanted to be where people made beautiful things for no reason and didn’t hide them.  Where they made happy noises when something was funny and had eyes that leaked when they were sad.  But, the man didn’t want him, and certainly wouldn’t want to take Anto with him, and there would probably not be a child of this man’s spirit in his womb when the man left, though he thought Steve’s spirit might be strong enough even for his unnaturally strong one.  Maybe, though, Steve would teach him his words before he left, so Anto could find his people one day and be able to talk to them and tell them that he was one of them. That he had been lost. But, he was home now. If he had words, he could tell them that.
“SI has a lot to answer for,” Everhart was saying.  “And so do you, Mr. Stark.”
Once, he nearly lost Tony to that certainty, the absoluteness that sometimes filled his mind, making everything so clear that he could not see what was right in front of him. He knew now that so many of his assumptions about Tony had been cobbled together from his own fears, stone by stone, until it formed a wall around him of his own making. Perhaps at least a part of him was still trapped there, he conceded as he glanced around at the walls of the tent. After all, Tony was reaching out, yet again, and here he sat.
“Do the doctors think—” Peggy began.
“The world doesn’t have to be what it is, like it’s some immutable state of being, that was all I said,” Bruce said, holding his hands up again in a sort of weary protest. “Now, can I gather my flowers in peace? Or did you want to argue politics more?”
, he thought, struggling to explain what had driven him from Tony’s bedchamber the night before last without giving away the true cause of his disquiet.  He wasn’t even sure if he understood it fully himself. It was all a hazy, disjointed mess in his head when he tried to think of it. Even now, he could taste the panic, like ash and blood in his mouth, and if he closed his eyes and tried to think about it for too long, all he could see in his mind was a map with a path through the mountains.  “Leaving behind what I guess I’d become used to, I don’t know. I didn’t mean to cause a problem. I never thought about running into someone else. I don’t know, I didn’t think. Couldn’t. It was like it was all too jumbled in my head and then it just…spilled over.”
“You believe I gave that vow to my King, to some symbol greater than the man you are, but I gave it to you without any crown, in the woods when it was just us. It was always you, Tony. You credit me with seeing things in you that were already there. You are the one who took something that would have destroyed a lesser man and made it something more, something strong,” Steve continued, voice scratching against the words.
“I don’t know what you mean,” Tony replied.  “I—I do want to do this.  Really.”  That much was true in the way that he imagined someone pinned under a pile of concrete wanted out.  Then, no matter how bad things turned out to be, at least the waiting would be over.  Rogers gave him a dubious look, then looked across the table to the row of windows.
“Night, Tony,” Steve replied, raising a hand in a half-wave. He stopped, just at his door, and turned around to Tony.  “I do love you.  You know that, right?”
“It was awful and terrible and I kind of nearly died, but I’m glad it happened.  Well, I don’t know if glad is the right word, but…like your—your best memory thing?  You got the shit kicked out of you, sure, but, you—you felt something change.  Something important.  That’s how it was for me,” Tony told him, breath hitching around the words.  “I can’t believe that was you,” Tony added after a moment, shaking his head and letting out a huff of disbelieving laughter.
“Yes.  Please,” Steve managed to gasp out.  “I’d like that.”
“So, I’ll be bleeding out slowly, instead of quickly, then,” Tony said, a spasm of pain contorting his features as he shifted to look down at the gash.  “You ever think the things we’re grateful for leave a lot to be desired these days?
A grimace flickered over Tony’s face before he shuttered it and replaced it with a lopsided smile. “I am very glad to hear that, my love.”
“Re-up?” Tony interrupted.
.  Things that could be solved.  He liked the neatness of it. The order.  It helped organize his mind in a way he couldn’t explain.
“I know you. I know who
Six hours and thirty-six.
“I’m not what he wants,” Tony said flatly.  He was staring at the ceiling, expression blank.
“Yes,” Steve acknowledged. "I'm so sorry, Tony.  More than I can say."
“Zola has a man who does it. With a…he uses a…” Steve stammered, waving a hand in the air and turning his head towards the fire where it crackled in the hearth.  He didn’t have the word for it.  Didn’t want to say it, even if he could.  “He does it.  I don’t.  I don’t—I like what you do.  But not.  Not that,” he added, then clamped his jaw shut.  That was all he could say, and even that admission hurt in a way he couldn’t quite explain.
“It was just a rudimentary connection. With time, a more sophisticated interface could be possible,” the alien replied.  “The gel is a biological electromechanical system of billions of particles. We call it Extremis.”
“I don’t want another Alpha,” Tony said in a high, thin voice.  Probably because of the altitude. Or the fact that he was about to hyperventilate.
“We’re seriously going to the Grand Canyon,” Tony told him, tilting his head a bit and watching Steve for long enough to make Steve feel a blush creeping up his neck. Tony grinned, and finally looked away, seemingly satisfied with whatever he saw on Steve’s face.  Awe and disbelief, probably, Steve figured.
“No telling,” Tony replied with a shrug.  “Throwing things, probably.  He likes to throw stuff.  I don’t know. It’s a thing for him.”
He smelled incredible.  Steve breathed in his scent again.  Like rich, deep wood and coppery metal.  Like his shield.  Like...like Iron Man. He didn’t consciously do anything, but Steve could feel his mouth and jaw…shift.  Elongate.  And he wanted.  Craved.  Needed it, this gift, this wondrous gift.
Tony hummed and glanced over his shoulder at him.  “Don’t worry, I politely declined,” Tony replied. He grinned at Steve, knowing and...fond, perhaps, a playful secretiveness flashing across his features.
Steve dropped his gaze and bowed his head slightly, and it was the most beautiful and terrifying thing Tony had ever seen. Tony wrapped one hand around the base of Steve’s neck, massaging his thumb over the mark he’d left earlier. He felt a tremor shake through Steve’s body and placed a long kiss to the top of his head. “Not that, as an Alpha, I don’t appreciate the gesture, it’s fantastic and all, but I do miss seeing you look at me,” Tony urged.
“Steve,” Tony breathed out, swaying forward slightly.   Tony’s eyes were blown wide, dark pools of want flicking up and down over him, heating Steve’s skin like wisps of fire.   “Are you—do you—“ Tony stammered, then closed his mouth, one hand scrubbing over his face, like he could wipe away the words.  “God, you’re beautiful,” Tony rasped out, then seemed surprised by the sound of his voice, like he hadn’t meant to say it out loud.
“I know.  But, feel free to say that as much as you want,” Tony said, mouth tugging up at the corners.  “What I’m saying is, I think—I think we could do this.  You and me.  We could figure out a way to make a difference and do it the right way. I don’t know how, not right now.  I
out of my league.”
Naked, Steve approached the bed, stopping only to pick up something off the table, his eyes dark and watchful as he regarded Tony.  He sank down onto the furs next Tony and dropped something next to Tony’s hands.  Instinctively, Tony reached out for it and held it up to the firelight.  It was a small, spherical framework of rings with various lines and notations on them  around circles representing the sun and earth.  Naturally, it was broken into pieces, meant to be remounted to form a representation of the heavens.  Tony sighed, and held up the parts, admiring the workmanship in the light.
“Go on.  I’ll give you the run down on the upcoming Board meeting later,” Pepper called out as Tony stepped into the elevator, the door sliding closed on the last of her words and whatever it was she and Rhodey were about to talk about.  Him, obviously.  Some little tete-a-tete entitled How Do We Solve a Problem Like Tony’s Terrible Past Life Choices, probably, he thought with a beleaguered sigh, though their shared indignation was something truly inspirational to behold.
“Love is—love is wanting to be with someone.  Wanting to care for them, protect them, provide for them.  Wanting them to be happy, even more than you want to be happy.  Putting their needs above your own. Being proud of them, excited for them, holding them when they are sad, and trying to make it better, if you can.  It’s when you’re happy just being around them. Even if, for example, you don’t understand them and they refuse to even talk to you and run away if you look at them too long, even though they are gorgeous and how can you not stare a bit?” Steve said, all breathless and giddy.  “Love is this, Tony. What I feel for you. I can’t…I can’t explain it, exactly, it’s—it’s too much. Too big. Love is the most powerful force in the world. It’s how you find people in the next world. We find the people we love.”
Tony would rather pull out his own fingernails than watch a romcom with Steve sitting next to him for reasons he wasn’t going to think about, but they made it through the original Star Wars movies, the even-numbered Treks and all the Lord of the Rings without incident, unless you considered the Great Eagle Debate to be an incident, which you couldn’t, really, when Steve was so clearly wrong about that, and it was awesome and magnificent, clearly foreshadowed in The Hobbit, and not some deus ex machina Tolkien cooked up because he couldn’t figure out how to rescue the characters he had a penchant for, okay, fine, somewhat dramatically stranding places.
Tony’s hips jerked hard once, and a jet of cum coated the sleeve of Steve’s inner thighs, running down the length of his own cock and pooling on the bed as Tony came with a shout, thrusting in and out a few more times before he collapsed against the broad expanse of Steve’s back, panting heavily, one hand digging into the muscle of Steve’s upper arm while the other gripped the sheet into a fist.
“It’s fine,” the man called Jarvis said stiffly, making Steve smile at the sheer loathing the man managed to project in two words.  “It was my fault. We got separated in the crowd.  My apologies.  I’ll let security know he has been found.”
Shellhead didn’t answer, of course, but he did appear just starboard, several lengths of the boat away. He was moving about in the waves, clearly agitated.
“No.  He really, really doesn’t,” Tony replied.
“Wait, what?”  Tony said, his voice strained.  And now Steve wasn’t sure what was going on.   Tony seemed genuinely confused, which just put Steve even more on edge.  He’d had that feeling all afternoon, like he was missing some piece of a puzzle, but couldn’t see where it could possibly fit.
Tyber was there in the clearing in front of the mouth of the cave, where it looked like everything inside had been tossed out onto the ground.  He had a long spear in one hand. Several of the other men surrounded him, each armed with spears or thick clubs, and in front of them, with his back to Anto, Steve stood, looming over all of them. His hands were out in front of him, palms up, clearly trying to show he wasn’t a threat while Tyber yelled and shook his fist at him. There was something Anto couldn’t see clenched in Tyber’s hand.
“That’s good, Steve.  Just like that,” Tony urged, voice tight and biting with strain.  He saw Tony wet his own lips and reach a hand down to cradle his cock as Steve repeated the motion.  It was easier now, with Tony watching, so clearly affected, because he could be doing it for Tony.   He didn’t know why that mattered, but it did.  Steve took another pass of it from his forehead and brought his fingers to his mouth.  “Stop,” Tony ordered sharply, eyes dark and hard, roaming possessively over Steve, making his skin tingle and warm.  “Use that on your cock,” Tony said, voice going low and hard.  “Make yourself come for me with my seed.”
“Why not?” Tony replied.
“I gave it back,” Steve said again.  “I went to the bank, but I… I just couldn’t do it, Brock.  I’m sorry.  I know what I said, but I couldn’t do it.  It didn’t feel right.  Not any of it, if I’m honest, and I get that it’s on me.  It was my call.  I’m not--I’m not blaming you for that, but,” he stopped shaking his head.  “I couldn’t keep the money.”
Stuffing the Army shirt back into the drawer, he shoved on his t-shirt and boxer and climbed into bed.  Sleep refused to come, though, no matter how many digits of Pi he mentally recited.  He kicked the covers off his legs and rolled over, staring at the wall between his room and Steve’s.
-like.
“Okay, that….
“You ever make it back to Boston?” Steve asked, which wasn’t a no, so Tony decided to let it slide.
“Did he touch you? Hammer?” Tony asked, almost as if it were an afterthought.
“Good,” the man said.  Anto looked up, hoping to catch an unguarded glimpse of the man while he was distracted, and was caught by the man’s steady gaze.  “Good,” the man repeated, reaching out to cup Anto’s cheek in his hand. Anto went still. He wasn’t sure what he was expecting, but not for the man to rub the pad of his thumb across the bruise that still darkened Anto’s cheek and make some kind of face that Anto recognized as distress.  The man was looking at him carefully, his gaze sharp, then he dropped his hand and leaned back against the cave wall again, mouth twisting into an expression of displeasure. I’ve done something wrong, Anto thought, and quickly dropped his gaze. He was being rude. No wonder the man was displeased.
Steve frowned warily down at the leather-bound books on the table, though none of them appeared at first glance to look like tomes of the Devil’s majiks. They were, in fact, beautiful in their own way, leather-bound pages embossed with gold, their edges delicately painted around the words.  Granted, Steve had no idea what a book of dark majiks would actually look like, though he suspected it wouldn’t simply state plainly what it was. Certainly, the names engraved on the fronts of the books he could see didn’t exactly offer much reassurance.
