It is nothing new that the detective cares, of course, but it is one of the rare times that he suggests it himself and doesn’t just listen to Watson spilling his heart freely and without paying attention to whether it matters to Sherlock or not. Both of them know that the man does in fact listen, closely and attentively to offer (more or less) helpful advice or to just make sure that his best friend is feeling better after letting it all out.
“But back to the topic… You know I was devastated when you died, Sherlock. I have lost count of how many times I had the gun in my hand and pressed to my temple, really. So when Mary came around and we got to know each other and she was so obviously interested I thought I could make this work and forget you. But you came back.”
It’s not about his daughter, he would otherwise unconsciously rub the skin behind his ear where he once put the fake white flower when Eurus approached him for the first time. Mary is not bothering him either, then he would bring his hands together to feel the now empty space where once his wedding ring has once sat. Work can’t be it since John always complains about it but then lets it be as soon as he has voiced his misery. Now what could it be?
“You have only gotten one very essential thing wrong…” For a moment, there is some heavy silence hanging between them. And Sherlock actually considers climbing on the roof of the hospital and jumping down for real this time.
He hears him before he sees him. The careful yet heavy steps that indicate John must be carrying his daughter. The loud bang as the front door slams shut without the following speech coming from Mrs. Hudson that he should care about the old house instead of trying to ruin the lock since she is too caught up in cooing over the small girl that is basically living with them at this point.
John glares at him as he places Rosie’s bag on the floor and then straightens up to stretch out his spine. “You are no genius for deducing that.”
“My dear Watson,” Sherlock whispers and walks over to the child, “Your father is only in a bit of a bad mood, nothing to worry about.”
The same thing is it that Sherlock once again comes to hate when John is sitting in his usual armchair, newspaper in both hands as he tries to pretend that he is reading. He is not fooling anybody, though, with how his eyes keep coming up to watch Sherlock who is standing in front of the window. Hell, Watson hasn’t even changed the page he is looking at for more than twenty minutes now!
“Elementary, my dear John,” he whispers and pulls back a little, just so he can get a look at the other man’s face, “After all this time I thought you would notice how I behave around you. Even if you are blind when it comes to the most obvious things.”
“You asked me whether I had a girlfriend. I told you that isn’t my area. You said it was fine if I was gay and I responded that I know it’s fine, how come you are not getting this?”
At that, John lets his arms slip from the taller man’s frame and takes a step back with his raised pointer finger almost stabbing the detective in the eye. “I was not jealous!”
It was only when Sherlock has left early, walking home instead of taking a cab even though it was cold and windy, that he has noticed how much Mycroft actually worries about him. His older brother had waited for him in his apartment, sitting on the sofa that is pushed up against the wall only to jump up as soon as Sherlock has entered.
“Of course I’m not,” Sherlock retorts and spins around to walk over to the kitchen, “Even an idiot like Lestrade could see it in your face but he probably wouldn’t know that it is bad enough that you have went to the bar on the street next to Rose’s kindergarten to drink away your misery for what… one and a half hours?”
He cocks his head a little. “The sweaty hands, the dilating pupils, the attentive care. Not to mention that your mind always seems to be elsewhere lately, you are in a bad mood when you are not around me and when you are, you still keep your distance even more than usually. And it all started with Mary’s video.”
Being rational and mind-controlled has its perks most of the time yet Sherlock can’t help but think that maybe going after his gut isn’t so wrong in certain situations. For example now, when he has John pressed against his chest with one arm around his back and one hand on his nape, when he can’t even recall why he decided hugging was a good idea. But when the doctor slowly brings his own arms up to cradle Sherlock in the same way, a decision made by heart surely can’t be bad.
Not even the high screech, the sound of porcelain hitting the carpeted floor and the splash of water from where Mrs. Hudson has dropped their tea upon seeing them bothers him the slightest although John stiffens in his arms. Instead Sherlock just smiles against his soldier’s lips and only lets him go when their housekeeper starts screaming about how she was right and why they kept on denying it for
The next sentence that flows out of Sherlock’s mouth surprises both of them. “Tell me about it then.”
With another kind of dramatic sigh, John falls onto his chair – cup slamming onto the table and a little bit of hot water splashing out of it. His kid is startled by the noise and mumbles gibberish while widening her eyes with tears glistening in them.
Now he does shake his head before letting it hand and fleeing from the look in his best friend’s face. It is rare that they talk about these times. Hell, those times are barely more than one of them can count on a single hand’s fingers.
John shakes his head and chuckles quietly to himself, his gaze yet still not breaking away. “I don’t even know if you are into men.”
Leave it to John to know exactly what to say and what to do in a situation where others lose their heads. A solider indeed. At last to Sherlock it feels exactly like standing on the battle field.
“I-“ Sherlock starts but for once, he can’t seem to find the right words to say. Somehow, he has a déjà vu from the time John asked him to be his best man. Overwhelmed, happy to some extent but this time, he is missing the slightly breaking heart of realizing that it was now too late to take his move. Still, not saying a single word is wrong in so many ways that-
“Great, now my own daughter likes you more than her own father,” John mutters and shakes his head before burying it in his forearms that are lying on the table. Sherlock would make a bad joke about it but seeing him like this, actually upset and disarmed, he just stands up and walks over to his friend to sit down beside him.
always - be nothing short of remarkable to me, and I thought I had made myself clear. In all your shortcomings that have been laid before me, and all our years together, not once have you disappointed me. You have erred, perhaps, on occasion - but I have not once thought ill of you for it. In fact I was heartened by them as it indicated to me that you were as human as I am. All I ask is that you trust me.”
I gave him the coin. “You may report back to Mr. Holmes that I received his message, and tell him this. ‘I am leaving for the club now, and that I will return to him at my earliest convenience’. Can you do that for me, Dawson?”
His smile bloomed to full fledged at my answer, and he linked arms with me for the rest of our walk.
“Alright.” I conceded, finally, because any resistance to Sherlock Holmes was futile from the start. Exhaustion was starting to take hold, the adrenaline finally seeping away and leaving me to agree to his terms. “But you will wake me at the first sign of trouble.”
“Some ten months, almost to the day I would wager!” Macnair was almost exactly as I’d remembered him, a man of distinctly sharp features, dark hair at his shoulders, and piercing eyes that belied a large, jovial smile. He was a handsome sort, and while our relationship had never moved past some flirtatious talk, he had been witness and confidante to many of my breakdowns and I considered him a friend even in my evidently noticed absence.
Even as he deemed it to be a triviality, he tilted more toward me from where he laid on the bed, and there was some spirit regained in his shoulders as he explained the simplicity to me.
I let out an involuntary noise out of horror, and that must have been what finally galvanized Holmes out of his temporary paralysis as we both then rushed to our knees before the body. I placed my hand underneath and within the man’s undone collar to feel for a pulse.
“The whole purpose of this venture is to keep you away from danger, why on Earth would I bring you before said would-be murderer in the first place! No, you are safest at Baker Street.”
He shrugged, then immediately winced. “‘Wanted your attention, didn’t I? And you were one for a puzzle, so I did my best to give you one,” he shifted, shutting his eyes, “- perfectly suited for you.”
“Mary was… a dear friend.” I said tentatively, before leaning forward slightly in my seat. “But that is all you have to say, Holmes? I have just confessed my greatest secret, something you could send me to the gaol for-“
“She has been for some weeks now courted by a man by the name of Theodore Langley, and believes he is on the verge of asking her to marry him, but is growing impatient as despite their heading in that direction, he has yet to respond to her hints or show any outward sign that he will be proposing. Yesterday, when calling on his sister Sally, who she is good friends with, she found herself alone and in close vicinity of his study, and had the brilliant idea to go through his things - I believe with the intention to get a better hint at his feelings somehow.”
It is here where I felt safe, and where I regained a part of my personhood once again, even as those months still remain a blur to me through my pervasive grief. Here, where I was understood, I felt my tongue could loosen, and it was here that I made friendships that I could not mention outside of the walls of the club.
That expression from the previous morning appeared in his eyes again, from when he made the deduction of where my interests lie and I met them to be found with surprise and no little amount of awe. However, he still took a step back from me, even as he acceded, “
Hearing it aloud and confirmed by Holmes only intensified what fear I had been feeling since the beginning of these events. It was chilling to suddenly find myself targeted so specifically, and within a place I felt so safe. I put a stop to these thoughts, however, as I endeavored to keep this panic at bay for it was not useful. My brain was needed for other exploits at the moment and I could not appear to be weak. I pulled myself together, and faced Lestrade’s incredulous gaze.
“Oh Sherlock,” he has said and that was all it took for the detective to crumble since he has been sure as hell that this was the end. The end of an Era, the end of a great friendship, the end of all hope. It was the first time after his jump from the roof that Sherlock has cried, in the arms of his brother at that. It came as no surprise that the drugs came for him soon after – Magnussen was only a welcomed excuse in that matter to justify himself. Not to mention all the other shit that went down during the last year even after Mary’s death. Sherlock could still kill Eurus for playing this bloody game with them that almost cost his soldier’s life.
“Okay, you know what? I take it back.” He grabs the newspaper and stands up, “I haven’t felt anything in the last five years.”
Judging by the way his gaze seems stuck on himself, Sherlock supposes that it has something to do with himself. Then again he has not behaved any different from how he normally is and since they have known each other for half a decade now, Watson is probably the very one person who is actually used to the detective’s unruly, mostly rude antics. But Sherlock has to admit that the dynamic between them does seem to have changed over the past couple of days – maybe weeks even. Now that he has come to think about it, there has been something off about his friend’s behavior after they have found the second video Mary left behind.
John, first totally speechless then obviously flustered, laughs and turns his head to the side so that he doesn’t have to look at the man. “Shut up.”
“Please,” Sherlock snorts, “When we were working on our first case and you flirted with me, I basically told you.”
Sherlock is not sure whether this is his cue to start or if he will just ball things up again (as he is so famous for it) when he does but letting it all hang there, out in the open, is the worse idea. So he takes a step back, because he really needs to breathe and to actually think straight for a few moments and he can’t do that with John in his space like that. Not that he is able to even form a single coherent thought or make a simple deduction so all he is left to do is react like a normal person – and to ask what he doesn’t know instead of jumping to conclusions.
Feelings are completely new ground for Sherlock since nothing has ever compared to the situation he finds himself trapped in now. Yes, he has had a long time to think about it and to get used to the whole concept of… being attracted…to somebody but this doesn’t mean that this makes everything easier. Not even Mycroft with his always helpful advices was able to ease Sherlock’s mind in that matter.
John looks up again while stuffing his hands into the small pockets of his pants. “The second video Mary left behind.”
What could be the reason why his mind is once again having field days. Not in the fun way, no. Oh how much Sherlock would give for Lestrade to just involve him in some kind of ‘unsolvable mystery’, serial killer maybe, another row of suicides, a whole restaurant filled with people who die from poison would be alright too but no, Lestrade has to be gone for two weeks because apparently, most persons need holidays from time to time. And since nobody else in the police department is willing to work with him, Sherlock sits in his flat and has solved all the interesting cases for his private clients.
Exactly five seconds later, a quite exhausted looking Watson is carrying a tinier version of himself (who seems to be more than energy filled though) into the living room and greets his fried with a merely mumbled, “Hello”.
They are on the same level now. Almost two feet apart but so close right the same instant. Even Sherlock feels quite clammy like this. His chest tightens and his stomach does a tiny little flip but he ignores it for now, just how he has always ignored it up to this point.
“Of course, Mary was still there and she had already agreed to marry me,” he continues and shrugs as if it is not a big deal when his tension clearly speaks of something else, “And I really thought I could go on with my life like this because in all honesty, Sherlock, I never thought that you would ever return those feelings I had… have for you.”
As much as John has been the one to show confidence at first when he started the kiss, it is Sherlock who keeps him close cradling his face in both hands and in that making sure he won’t get away so quickly. He has lost so much time focusing on his work and on understanding the world around him when he could have been with John in exactly this way – pressed together, joined by the lips and connected deeper than he would have ever considered possible.
Sherlock already opens his mouth to answer but the doctor just continues to talk, his gaze still not breaking away from their eye contact. They have been staring at each other like this for so many times already but it has never, not once, been like this where everything is out in the open and so bloody vulnerable.
By the time he is finished with his little explanation, the water in the kettle is already bubbling and a high chirping noise indicates that it has the right temperature. Without even checking that everything is right, Sherlock blindly fills the cups that John has already put onto the blank space next to his right elbow. It has become a well-known routine by then.
“Sherlock, if you would please say something so that I can stop feeling like an idiot,” John eventually shakes him out of his thoughts.
The detective shrugs, “Well, you always say that I am either a bloody drama-queen or a giant cock. Insults are a coping mechanism when people feel small or downgraded so there is probably nothing out of the ordinary in you feeling like an idiot when I am in the same room.”
Sherlock sighs as Mary’s voice falls silent, then he pauses the video and rewinds it to see it from the beginning yet again. It is the seventh time he sees her smiling face then. And, like the past six times, he speaks every single word of those bloody one minute and fifty seconds with her because, of course, he knows them by heart.
Closing his eyes, Sherlock slowly brings both palms together, rises them towards his face and gently dips his head until his forehead touches the tips of his thumbs.
There is the faint siren of a police car blaring in the background, as well as the usual traffic that clogs the streets of London each day, every day. Added to that, the quiet ticking of the clock that is placed next to Sherlock’s scull and both of their shallow breathing are all the sounds that fill the air between them. It’s uncomfortable to say at least, because of them don’t know what to say, how to react, how to talk with the other from then on.
“I have been blind,” Sherlock growls and begins pacing up and down the living room of their apartment, “so bloody stupid as if I was a normal person and not, well, me!” His right foot slides out of his slipper but he just lets it be, doesn’t even notice it properly, and continues to run full kilometers in the tiny flat.
Now that he has actual proof, Sherlock is absolutely certain about this. John looks vulnerable, sure, with how he is curled into himself a little, as if hiding his chest from the other man would somehow keep him safe from unwanted emotional pain in retrospect to how confident he always hold himself in the I-am-a-soldier-posture. It was the first thing Sherlock has found out about him and dear, if he hasn’t come to cherish that small detail over the years. Add to that the button up, plaid shirts, the cozy sweaters and the comfortable pants (basically the style of every men that has reached the age of 60), the already grey hair and the rare but so honest smiles and you have the sole reason why the one and only Sherlock Holmes has started to feel something. For the first time since he can remember.
“Because I wanted to be close to you,” John said simply, brushing Sherlock’s fringe away from his forehead.
When they pulled back for air, John’s eyes were dark in the lamplight, his lips red. He smiled softly. “Let’s get some sleep, okay?”
“Don’t mention it,” Sherlock said, and took his phone out of his pocket and dialed Mycroft’s number.
“I should get up,” Sherlock slowly sat up, still holding himself. “I need to brush my teeth and use the loo, anyway. I’m tired of this bloody bed, too.”
John cleared his throat. “Yeah. In the past I tried not to, but you know. Wasn’t easy. I wanna experience this with you, but only if you’re on board.” He truly would be okay with never having sex with Sherlock, but if he had the opportunity to be the man of action he always was and smother him with kisses and bring him to ecstasy, he would take it. “We don’t have to do anything crazy.” He sounded husky to his own ears. “Just kiss a bit.  Hold each other. Touch each other.” He wasn’t completely comfortable saying this, but the way Sherlock’s breaths were growing heavier made him go forward. “Just have a good time. We can try?” he offered, trying to suppress images of Sherlock naked and splayed out on the bed so he didn’t grow aroused at the kitchen table.
“I think I get it now,” John said, “why you didn’t say anything, I mean. Especially after…” his eyes flickered down. “After what a horrible prick I was to you.”
John bit Sherlock’s lower lip hard and he cried out, clutching at John’s broad shoulders helplessly. He was sweating, his entire body consumed in heat and sharp tingles of pleasure. He felt his balls tightening, and by this point, he and John could only pant and huff hot, harsh breaths against each other’s open mouths, too far gone to properly coordinate a kiss.
Sherlock eyes roamed over John’s sleeping, vulnerable face, feeling protective. He would start taking care of him immediately. As much as he didn’t want to wake John, the urge to touch him was too strong. Sherlock lifted his hand slowly, careful not to make any sudden movements, and delicately ran his thumb over the growing stubble on John’s jaw. When John didn’t stir, Sherlock’s hand moved to his hair, and gently stroked the (soft, surprisingly soft) tufts between his fingers. John sighed in his sleep, but only seemed to get more comfortable, so Sherlock kept doing it, his hand moving slowly as if he were touching something precious and fragile. John wasn’t a fragile man, far from it, but he needed more support than Sherlock had thought. Being married to someone who constantly disrespected you would do that to someone, he supposed.
Still, there were things he wanted to know. John felt like he could not truly begin to move on if he didn’t know everything. “Sherlock, can I ask you some things?”
John answered him with a kiss. He slid their lips together and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s slim waist. He thought his idea was working out wonderfully. This felt amazing, and slowly, the tension was melting from their muscles. Sherlock Holmes was in his arms. The love of his life. This...this was really happening. John kissed him deeper, coaxing his mouth open. He brought Sherlock’s lower lip in between his own ever so slightly, not enough to get wet and messy, but enough to suck a little and feel hm tremor in his arms.
John’s eyes widened and he brought his hand up to touch that exact spot. He knew what Sherlock was talking about, then. “We didn’t--” He stopped.
John felt his cock stir again, and there was no way he could resist. He latched onto Sherlock’s neck again, kissing his neck, and delicately nibbled the skin. Sherlock’s other hand came around his back, and all ten fingers were gripping John tightly. He was breathing hard, tilting his head upward to give John better access to his throat. John took a chance and sucked harder, and felt Sherlock shiver in his arms.
John looked down at the note and then up at Sherlock again, almost like his brain was having difficulty accepting the connection. He was breathing out of his mouth. “You…”
He needed to get the subject back to Culverton’s crimes. “This isn’t the only reason, or the main reason why I’m doing this. I needed to hear you confess. I needed to know I was right.”
Although it was against his better judgment, John really didn’t want to let him suffer, not when his mental health was already suffering. He turned down the morphine a bit.
Sherlock was silent for a moment, then said, “I must admit, your poetry is much more flattering when it’s directed at me and not some woman in an email.”
“I never expected you to be so bashful,” John commented. “You don’t get like this when I praise your intelligence.”
Sherlock got up, stomped to the pile of his discarded clothes, and pulled his pants up under his robe. He stomped back to his chair and sat down, spreading his legs. “There, is that better?” he pouted.
John felt trapped. He wasted two years of his life with Mary, and he felt further apart from Sherlock than ever. He sighed shakily. Out of all people, why did he have to fall in love with Sherlock Holmes?
“No,” he slurred into his pillow. He liked this fun side of John. He wanted to have fun with him more. He opened his eyes. He felt like his thoughts were wandering away. There was something about John’s warm body pressing down on his which turned his mind into pudding. He nuzzled his pillow, his muscles turning into pudding, as well, and the aftermath of his orgasm was catching up with him. John’s arms wrapped around his torso and he rested his head on his back. He could feel each rise and fall of John’s chest against his body. This was bliss.
“You know how to open a door,” Sherlock said from inside the bathroom. He was defensive. He was certainly upset. But, he was willing to let John in.
“Thank you, John,” Sherlock said, phone in his line of view. “There are certain things only you can know.”
The corner of his mouth twitched, and he stared at John from out of the corner of his eye. “What do you think?” he asked, an edge to his voice.
Sherlock still couldn’t look at him. He wasn’t sure if he ever felt this vulnerable in his entire life, physically and emotionally. “You know how it felt,” he snapped.
A smile was still in Sherlock’s eyes, but his tone grew more hesitant. “Yes. Nothing is ever ordinary with us, is it?”
John chuckled. “Nothing. I never saw you take any pictures of yourself, so I guess it makes sense. I’ll have to take some pictures of you with her.”
“Holmes,” I insisted once again, for I confess I was getting rather impatient. And rattled, for that matter. I had been a soldier, and saw dangers and horrors almost just as regularly in my time with Holmes, so long as to grow somewhat numb to the fears inspired, but to see it invade our space like this was another thing entirely, and it unsettled me deeply. Even so however, I would not leave Holmes’ side. His not providing me with further answers except to dismiss me and attempt to keep me in the dark once again only left me more anxious to know what he had deduced thus far.
He snapped his fingers, for despite his words and the tension currently between us, he was still impatient at my slowness. “His words tonight. He painted a picture of a man heartbroken over one he had loved and lost. Do you deny being that man?”
Still, it was best to ease him into it - it was an emotion-filled topic after all. I stood to take one of my cigars off of the mantle before regaining my seat. “Do you have a match, old fellow?”
“He- he did in fact, on two or three separate occasions that I can remember,” I swallowed. “What of the motive you mentioned? Surely it could not be jealousy alone that spurred his actions? That body found in the park before the one in our sitting room - how could he be pushed to that extreme?”
Holmes appeared sympathetic. “He was inordinately protective of you, and cognizant of your every move, pointing to, I could not help but notice, an extreme feeling. He seemed to make overtly clear to William Vernet at least that he had laid his claim to you, and that I am not worthy.”
“Watson, his main method of murder thus far has been poison, so I am sure we will have ample time to step in should it get dangerous in earnest. It is not like a shooting - in order for us to catch him in the act we must have staged everything so as to make his involvement irrefutable.”
The case of the mysterious floriography was in the end, more of a personal adventure than a crime-solving experience, so would not be due for publishing regardless, but the memory of events has been one I have touched upon in the years since then that I have spent with Holmes, as a testament of how far we have come since we first took those fumbling steps toward each other, and to understanding what we had between us. Douglas Macnair was a regrettable foe, and I did indeed mourn his loss as both a friend and person I had once dearly trusted, but he made his choices as well as I made mine in the end. His final act was to bring me to voice those words unsaid, and however awful I do have him to owe gratitude towards for that ushering of a new era in mine and Holmes’ relationship. As for the latter, I still have but the highest regard for him, and he is still as he was then and forever will be to me, the best and the most wisest man whom I have ever known.
Macnair laughed loudly, though he uncocked his gun, bringing me some relief. Abbott, who had been sitting frozen on the settee observing the events and escaping notice, relaxed slightly himself.
He gave me a rare smile, bowing his head. “Still. Idiot that Douglas Macnair may be, in many respects some of the things he said tonight can be marked as true.” His tone was one I was familiar with, but only in scenes where he was minutes from triumph, after putting pieces together that no other man would ever fathom.
I have always been guilty of embellishments in my stories and that novel is not exempt, but better put, is in fact the example that proves the rule. When I first met Mary Morstan I did remark that she was a very attractive woman, however that was as far as my feelings toward her went at the time for I was still very much hopelessly infatuated with a man I believed would never be capable of returning my affection. After the conclusion of the case however, she approached me because as sharp as she was, she had deduced my situation without either of us saying a word, with that sense that only those who were of our inversion could ever truly reach. She offered her counsel, and when I rebuffed her and told her that she did not know my friend as I did, she then asked if I could be of some further help to her instead.
Holmes sniffed and stood up, taking a turn about the room and assuming a haughty countenance that I knew after much observation meant that he was about to reveal something sobering, or indeed even humbling. “What I could not put into words there is that you were interesting.”
I poured us both some brandy from the sideboard before taking my own glass as I took an uneasy seat into my armchair, where the corpse yesterday had lay at my feet. “You mean to say if I had not gone with you then, then there would have been no reason for this second man to have died. Or if I had just gone back and visited him at the club once again, this all could have been avoided.”
“Here again we disagree, Holmes. For I say there is no one more worthy of my high regard than you.” Despite the lump building in my throat, and the disbelief in my stomach, my heart began to rise in my chest, and I felt as if I was in danger of letting out a laugh.
The villain before me let out a dark laugh. “Layman that I may be, it was simple. Your coat and hat still on the stand, the fire already lit when we entered. Not to mention the shock sent through me at having received an invitation to dine with one John Watson, one that had not been extended to me in all the months of our closest acquaintance but suddenly appeared now, on the heels of my largest foray into criminality.” His stare turned to me. “It was all very
Anger once again restored to its place beneath my left breast, I found my resolve and my revolver and set off behind Holmes, to regain my role once more as his protector.
He continued as if I hadn’t spoken, nodding to himself. “Indeed, you possess a certain charm that allows you to understand what people need from you at that present moment, which speaks to a great generosity and an open heart.”
“Simple, it is a test of wills, and will play out as I have said. Bring forth your poison, and put a substantial amount into this glass. We both will drink from it, and continue to do so until we reach an indeterminable round that proved fatal for one of us. Whoever survives emerges victorious.”
“He has been poisoned, although an odorless one that will need to be identified by a coroner. Most likely arsenic, placed in the water procured by Mrs. Hudson so as to provide a quick yet clean death - this mysterious gentleman is clever, Watson.”
“So much that I fear I will not be able to sleep,” said I. Indeed I did not know how I would be able to leave this room and Holmes’ comforting presence as security, let alone close my eyes to drift off tonight.
As far as emotional climaxes went, I guessed that was as far as he would be willing to go tonight, and I knew and respected his limits so I withdrew. Still, I remained in reach, speaking to Mrs. Hudson for the both of us when she came to see about the mess and the conclusion of our homefront adventure, and then as she left finding one of my well-loved novels to read as comfort after the harrowing past few days. At length however, it all began to catch up with me, and after my third or fourth yawn I decided to admit defeat and retire for the night.
Fortunately, I was saved from answering by the return of the constable, asking for a word with Lestrade outside. I watched him go, aware suddenly that his presence was both the biggest threat to me at the moment and yet my only rescue from the realization my friend had just made about my nature.
Holmes had not moved from my hold, except to lean into my touch. His face was warm and his expression was bright even as he asked the question: “But what of the time lost?”
, if you’ll pardon the innuendo,” I merely coughed, and indicated for Macnair to keep going, as the concept of Holmes being friendly in any sense was foreign, let alone in that intended notion, “but then it was as if a flip switched, and he was here all the time from then on.
“So you knew all this and did not inform Miss Finnegan? But her nerves could be soothed, for she may be thinking the worst.”
The remainder of the day was spent in a similar vein, until finally the hour began to match the darkness of the sky outdoors. Holmes was still on the floor, though he now sat next on the other side of the room in front of the settee, and we had switched tasks sometime around the letter N. It was now I who read aloud, still from my armchair, while Holmes recorded.
“I was always aware that I’d always be playing second fiddle, but really, Johnny. If you’re that torn up about him why don’t I just introduce you?” Macnair pulled me out of my thoughts with a chuckle, though there was a hard line to his eyes and he was frowning somewhat. I realized I had been staring at Holmes’ back, and tried to smile apologetically, however, before the fog of my wonderings finally cleared and I caught his meaning.
He shook his head. “Now. I will need the title and the names of your closest associates of this club. No need for alarm, if anything they will merely point me in the right direction.”
Holmes slumped slightly, from where we were leaning against the wall of an alley observing Macnair walking away merrily, poison in hand. His mood was very different from our last discovery. “Sometimes it depresses me, Watson, that the criminal mind of London does not need too large of an imagination to exact evil upon its populace.”
My view was suddenly hindered, however, by a gentleman’s upper half and when I looked up it was to see the easy grin of one Douglas Macnair, a face I had not seen in many months. I stood at once to greet him with a handshake. “Watson! Imagine my surprise at seeing you here tonight!”
“Still,” said he, almost wildly, “do you not wish to know why I attended that club, that by some trick of Fate herself you in time called your own?”
“John Watson! Why it’s been quite some time, hasn't it! Some of the lads reckoned you’d done forgotten about us completely, especially when we heard the news about your fella returning from the dead and all.” He unlocked the door to let me in immediately, and I was able to see once again the age-hardened and kindly elderly man that guarded entry to this sanctuary of sorts.
“You ain’t foolin’ me, guv, I can read, can’t I? But I shan’t pry, no need to worry.” He winked at me before taking my coat and hat, and I had had to suppress a groan.
“You said it was an emergency, Mr. Holmes, and that boy of yours who flagged me down was insistent! What could possibly be the matter that you called on me at home?”
I finally broke it some minutes later, the not knowing getting to me. I could not see a possible way to prove Macnair’s guilt without telling the complete truth of our relations.
“Of course you did not. He took great pains to hide it from you, as you were the target of his desire. Knowing you as he began to, and your dislike of rows and superfluous displays of anger, he had to have realized that all of this would have made him disagreeable to you at once, and so he endeavored to cover his tracks. Did he ever attempt to dissuade you from speaking to certain persons without adequate reason?”
When at last he spoke, it was not in fact about my inclinations at all. “I had long known your marriage was built more out of compassion than love, but I confess that even now your capacity for kindness astounds me, Watson.”
“What is of utmost importance is that you are safe!” Holmes yelled. I found any possible retort drying up suddenly. “I will not knowingly put you in harm’s way in this matter, there are too many unknown variables in that it is specifically designed by one who knew you when I had left you at your most vulnerable! I will not do it.”
Holmes ignored him. “Judging by the floriography and the nature of the murders themselves, I am inclined to suppose that this has some relation to a romantic entanglement of yours, Watson.” And then to my astonishment, his eyes were on me, but they were fresh and it seemed as if he was seeing me for the first time.
Before I knew it, the music was ending. I could not tell how long we had danced for it felt timeless, and yet I was grieved to find it over so soon. We stood still as it swelled to a stop, in the closed position of the waltz, and then Holmes raised my hand where it was still clutched in his to his lips, like he had done as his French counterpart, and kissed it softly. Then, in a reverent tone that was both familiar and yet unknown to me, “I dare say we are finally nearing our time, my dear.”
“I will never understand him then, I suppose, for I have never truly understood jealousy, at least not in these affairs.”
I took it, with no small amount of relief at seeing him, and drank whatever it was in the glass without tasting it, except to agnise that it refreshed me and felt like liquid gold entering my veins. When I finished, the glasses disappeared, or I had forgotten about them, and then Holmes waved his hand and led me by my left elbow to the center of the room, his touch gentle but firm and insistent as ever.
Holmes just shook his head, not looking at me. “This is the way it has to go, unfortunately. I hope you may forgive me one day, my dear Watson.”
“That is not what I said.” I sighed, annoyed with myself now that the conversation had taken this unexpected turn. “No. I have long since forgiven you for that, I meant it when I said as much at the time. But the scars are still there, Holmes, and it is not as if you have stopped! Would you really believe I am a weakness to you?
“That is a flawed fallacy to fall into, my friend, and you should know better than to lay any fault on yourself. You are an equal victim here.”
We finally reached a respectable enough street that I felt comfortable to call a cab, and we got in. I was eager to have this conversation at Baker Street instead of a London taxi, but I sought answers, so I merely asked Holmes to lay out his reasoning. He did so, but even I could tell he was curtailing some of his relish for my sake. “Currently the largest indications of his guilt are circumstantial, but they are certainly substantial enough to put him under great suspicion. He shares all the personal qualities we have agreed that the suspect possesses, as well as a decent motive. He matches the visual description that Mrs. Hudson was able to give us, with his strong jaw, shoulder-length hair, and defined nose. And there is likely an established connection between him and our victim last night, with their both being journalists - we need only to have the man identified and it will be clear that they knew each before and therefore he had the means to lure him to his death. Not to mention that he has been established to be a violent man in the past.”
There are multiple discreet gentlemen clubs from which to choose for men who shared my condition, and even in my state the one I frequented was one of a more upper class slant, and had clientele that all were the more skilled at avoiding detection and blackmail. I had not, as I mentioned, attended an establishment like this in my time since coming to London; I had somehow escaped the notice of my proclivities from a man who could glean so much just from the way I folded my handkerchief, and so had no illusions as to how my attending a questionable and queer gentleman’s club would be only too easy for him to determine. Now of course, I had no such barrier.
Wordlessly, Holmes nodded and knelt before my side, lighting my cigar as I held it between my lips and fingers. His expression was concentrated on the thing as he did so, and the second it was lit he stepped away from me as quick as he could, his stare transferring to the carpet at my feet.
“Well of course you are!” Holmes genuinely shouted, his arms extended, and I was shocked into closing my mouth. He growled before approaching the mantle and picking a cigarette from his case, only to seemingly think better of it and throw it unlit into the fire, his every movement reading of agitation.
“Watson. You are courageous. Honest. Considerate. Trustworthy. But most of all, my friend, you are forgiving, and it is this trait I have exploited time and time again so that I may satisfy my own need to keep you from harm’s way. And yet I cannot bear to think that you believe that my actions are as a result of my lack of trust in you. For you to even believe that I do not- that my regard for you isn’t but the highest! It is unfathomable.”
Holmes was silent, before he took a seat on the settee. He appeared to be confused, and distraught as a result. “But I do those things to protect you, and keep you out of unnecessary harm - surely I have made myself clear on that?”
It was very fitting that the night in which the relationship between Sherlock Holmes and I finally crescendoed was not spent in pursuit of a dangerous villain nor under duress of some seemingly insuperable problem, but in the heart of our sitting room surrounded by the evidence of our past.
“Funny sort of fellow, isn’t he?” Macnair said as we watched them leave. I remarked that I did not know what he meant, and the man merely shrugged, though there was something in his eyes I had not seen before, and when he met my gaze it did not immediately leave.
Macnair simply nodded. “William Vernet, I believe, yes. French fellow. He’s an alright gent, a bit fanciful for my taste, of course. I’m not sure you would know him actually, he was a regular patron before your time, although we all haven’t heard from him for some years now.”
Holmes dittered, standing. “Yes well, there are certain nuances I was not able to convey to you last night. William Vernet, I am sorry to say, is an invention of my own and merely a disguise. We are one and the same, and so it was actually I who asked you to meet here today.”
Sherlock supposed, however, that being in love did not necessarily mean he could be in a relationship, and perhaps that was what John thought. That was another big component of what he was feeling: shame. Maybe John was right. Maybe he
He stared at the fireplace. “Remember when I patched up your hand? Wait,” he looked at Sherlock, “how is your hand?”
Thankfully, Sherlock was in a talkative mood, so John didn’t have to respond. “Thank you,” he flashed a grin, “but please leave.”
“This is the best night of my life,” Culverton whispered, fingers twitching in anticipation. “None of the others were as fun as you.”
John started eating. This all felt so domestic, unsettlingly so, considering what had happened yesterday. It was a nice distraction, sure, but it felt unnatural. He knew Sherlock was trying, though. John wanted to talk with him, but how could they talk about anything without bringing up the elephant in the room?
“Thank you,” he told Sherlock, kissing the center of his chest chastely. “That’s kind of you, Sherlock.”
John rolled his eyes. “You’re a grown man. You shouldn’t rely on an elderly woman to clean your room.” He stopped. “God, I feel like I’m parenting you.”
“I think…” He opened his eyes, but his gaze was on John’s chest. “I think it was your wedding. It was a wake-up call. Seeing you officially, legally partnered with someone else put a--sense of hurt in me,” he admitted, uncomfortable, “which I couldn’t deny.”
Still, John wondered what the hell was up with the past two dreams he had. It was almost identical to the last one, but this time, Sherlock had lifted his head from his hand, and his face was soaked with tears.
There wasn’t a mirror, around, but John needed to see his reflection. Something was very wrong. He grabbed a spoon and tried to see his reflection. Although the image was small and blurry, John could make out the shape of a moustache. He dropped the spoon and held his hand over his mouth in shock. He felt the moustache beneath his fingers. He shaved this off years ago! Back when--
He got quite dramatic when in a sour mood. “I think that goes without saying.” He didn’t open his eyes.
Three months later, Sherlock and John walked away from the courthouse hand-in-hand. They didn’t even look at Mary as she was put into a police car. They decided that, no, they didn’t want Mycroft to handle it all for them, and instead wanted her to face consequences from the law itself. Her drugging, kidnapping, and assault done to Sherlock were only the tip of the iceberg to the jury compared to her crimes as an assassin (and, okay, they did get Mycroft’s help with that). Sherlock had given his own testimony as if reciting the facts of any case--devoid of emotion. Mary didn’t deserve his sadness.
John stood perfectly still, heart beating so hard that he could feel it in his throat, palms sweating profusely. He felt like he was going to take a panic attack. He brought his fist too his lips and bit his knuckle.
better,” John felt his eyes grow wet with tears. Why did Sherlock treat his body so badly? Why did he always do this?
That was a good question. He probably would have still gone through with the plan, but let John in on it. Or, maybe not? The version of him now would have let John in. In some ways, he felt like a different person since 2012. He had thought John would have stayed at Baker Street, but he moved out and found a fiance. He didn’t know John’s feelings as well back then. He didn’t John would have been so affected, but if they had a romantic relationship, would that have changed? “Like I said, I really don’t know. I don’t. If we’d been together, and you thought I died, would you have still moved out and found Mary?”
“Yeah, but you do need to be careful,” John warned, Sherlock’s pale, thin face leaving him uneasy. He really shouldn’t have been leaving the hospital tonight, but John knew this wasn’t a battle he could win. If he were honest, he was sick of living in the hospital and looked forward to the two of them being back at Baker Street, and with Mycroft’s men watching the flat and searching for Mary, he would feel a little safer from her.
Sherlock inhaled sharply. “Yes. I--mmm, John, it’s hard to talk like this,” he managed to mumble out in between kisses.
John’s hand hovered in the air, and he took in Sherlock’s weak, exhausted face, exhausted just from leaving the bed. But, his light, pleading eyes stopped John.
Sherlock ignored the pang of fear which hit his chest. “How do you know this? I never told any of you about Mary.”
John arranged it so they were going to meet Mary at Speedy’s at 2 in the afternoon, which would give Mycroft plenty of time to set up a couple security cameras in and outside the shop, and have one of his men around the area in case she needed to be apprehended (Sherlock had told him that was unnecessary, but Mycroft said, “I would rather not run the risk of your heart stopping again, brother”, and Sherlock shut up). They had a few hours to kill until then, and Sherlock and John brushed their teeth, threw on a couple of Sherlock’s dressing gowns, and ate breakfast in silence, minds occupied with Mary. Sherlock didn’t want to get himself worked up, but he had to anticipate the worst. The joy he felt from when he woke up with John was gone, replaced with dread, but exhaustion, too. He wanted all of this to be over so badly.
“I don’t know why you called me, Lestrade,” Sherlock spoke rapidly, “the victim was clearly killed by her daughter’s ex-lover because she was the one who urged them to break up, so he murdered them both out of revenge. Ridiculous, you could have solved this on your own, you wasted my time.” He got all of that out in single breath.
We had reached home, and I got out of the cab onto somewhat unsteady feet. Neither of us had had overmuch to drink at the club, however I could feel the effects of the alcohol all the same, and see it in the less than graceful fumbling of Holmes attempting to locate his keys in his ridiculous tailcoat on our front stoop. I was just about to offer my own when he found it and showed them off with a triumphant smile. I was reminded of him on our steps just the night before, when everything hadn’t yet gone wrong, and found that reconciling the two images was almost laughable. And yet how I felt for him then as I felt for him now, even changed as we both were by everything learned tonight!
Holmes stopped stalking about and glanced down before his eyes flitted back just as quickly back to my face, his voice holding some rebuke. “Did I what?”
I smiled at his demand, and was intrigued by all he had discovered, and what it meant for the final confrontation to be had tonight. I took out a coin for the boy, who was looking at me expectantly while trying and failing to stand still before me.
- Wilde v. Queensberry, or the ordeal when Oscar Wilde accused his boyfriend Lord Alfred Douglas' dad for libel for calling him gay. thats the nicest way of putting a very tragic trial.
One of these men was the one who had evidently met his untimely end here, and the other was a charming gentleman who had cajoled her into letting them past the door. Mrs. Hudson dutifully described this other gentleman as being of medium height, with a Roman nose, snake-like eyes but not unhandsome features, and hair just to his shoulders, wearing a navy overcoat that he denied her request to take.
! I have failed to see what lay directly in front of me - what shared my rooms and breakfasted with me day after day.”
Whatever his true motivation for keeping me away was this time, I would not be privy to it until the end of the case, and even then maybe not. Forgiven him as I had, I had still not forgotten how he had allowed me to fall victim to the note on those dreadful Falls, turning me away in order to face the threat alone. And then letting me believe he was dead and gone for three long terrible, painful years, all for some reason that would only be revealed to me afterward when he returned to me in my consulting room only ten months prior. Try as it might, it had always seemed to me as a lack of trust.
It was a bit much, I will admit, but it served its purpose in placating her, and she sniffed but agreed to bring us our meal before closing the door and descending back down the stairs.
When Holmes spoke next he was as equally careful in his wording as I had been. I chanced a glance to see that his eyes were still intent on me, but his usual steepled fingers and stony expression that brooked no argument appeared softer somehow and once again he was looking at me with that mixture of surprise and almost awe. “I would not ask you to reveal anything should you not be comfortable, my dear Watson, however present circumstances do mean that there is a distinct need to hear it, as well as some details.”
When he reached the entrance I imagined he would have some difficulty. It was customary for patrons to have memorized some secret phrases to repeat before the doorman, but if they were regulars then they were often fortunate enough for Archie to recognize them. I had not given Holmes any secret phrase, not knowing it myself as I had not occasion to learn the new one in use, and as one of the aforementioned fortunate few Archie let through on sight alone.
“Why in this manner? What has he accomplished other than making me fear for my life? I do not see how this is an attractive way of courting someone!” I cried.
“Yes, there has been sufficient turmoil tonight, hasn’t there, Watson.” said Holmes, as ever reading my thoughts as if I had said them aloud.
I cleared my throat, “I dare say you will, Holmes, although even with your disguise I would recommend caution. Your reputation should not be damaged.”
However to my surprise, all it took was some scarce handful of words before Archie allowed him in with a jovial tone to his voice, although I was too far to make them out clearly. Holmes patted him on the back and let out a laugh that was clear and low and unlike his own before disappearing within. This raised questions I did not have the time nor the facts to answer.
Still, I acted as planned, and was benign and unassuming as ever, inviting him to supper at Baker Street, and so as not to seem remiss, extended the invitation to Abbott as well. As if I had now been trained to look for it, I noticed the twitch in Macnair’s forehead at this, as if the poor fellow had somehow done something to him by merely being present.
“Yes, well, I have become somewhat busy once again and it has kept me from paying this old place a visit.”
“To gain your trust, that is chiefly why I endured so much blabbering - of course I believed I was at least entitled therefore, to the final product! Night after night of listening to, ‘
“I see.” I said, and went to take my seat at the breakfast table, before having to get up to relieve my chair of its own stack of papers. “May I be of any help?”
I looked down to my walking stick hitting the pavement as we walked, appalled. I had known Macnair had more attachment to me than I had to him, I was not completely blind, however I again believed it to be harmless. I would have thought that the extended knowledge of my grief and lost love for Holmes would have dissuaded him if anything. Even if he nevertheless persisted in his regard for me, could he really be behind such extreme and outrageous acts as these?
That expression from the previous morning appeared in his eyes again, from when he made the deduction of where my interests lie and I met them to be found with surprise and no little amount of awe. His other hand came to join our grasp, and I fear that the tears that rose within my eyes could not be stopped this time.
“Of course you are my weakness, Watson, I would have thought that obvious from the start! You need only look through our case history to see that my every blunder was almost a direct result of my being distracted in showing off to you, or in wanting to keep you engaged. I have made no secret of wanting your presence as my partner in my work because I desire your insight as much as your company, but it does also bring some assurance to have you living, breathing in front of me. Watson, you are my weakness in that you are evidence that a man’s heart can live outside his body, for you carry mine with you always.”
Holmes beckoned me further into the shop, and we facilitated a meeting with the shopkeeper, a stout, but pink-faced and lovely woman who greeted us cheerily. “What can I interest you gentlemen in? Is it a special occasion?”
He looked up at me and answered my question before I could ask it. “His maintenance and habits make it clear that he has been in close proximity and in the warm care of a woman, however he bears no wedding ring.”
“It’s no matter, there are more pressing things at hand that are of increased relevance. For instance, I believe I have solved our case.”
“Mister Holmes said to say ‘stay on course’.” Dawson recited proudly. “‘Nd I’m to give you this, sir,” and he pulled out a small piece of torn paper from his pocket. The note was in Holmes’ penchant scrambling yet elegant handwriting, and read as follows:
I should have expected this, had I ever let myself dream this far. From a logician’s view, to point out the time in which we had both spent loving each other but in secret, close to a decade and a half by my own count, was prudent and relevant, even to this matter of the heart. A subject which I, thankfully, have never deigned to apply logic to.
Holmes’ eyes went to mine, and I saw something like regret form behind his resolve. “There is no greater one like it. John Watson’s heart.”
For there in the inviting warmth of our sitting room and at the foot of my own armchair, lay a man supine upon the floor, unmoving.
1888. That was the year I’d met Mary, and we’d agreed to our engagement. I had not told Holmes the details because I hadn’t wanted to betray Mary’s secret, and then he had vocally denounced me as abandoning him and we hadn’t seen much of each other until I was married and settled in Kensington and he requested my presence on a case and all was as usual again. If I was arrogant enough to consider that it was I who inspired his supposed bad temper, then the nights before we made up and I was not living with him had ostensibly been spent here. And then of course in 1891, with the rising threat of Moriarty, he was too busy covering his tracks to even begin considering partroning a compromising establishment such as this. By the time I had showed up for the first time in late 1893, it had been two years since he’d last stepped on our country’s soil, and so in that way we had passed each other like two ships in the night, or however the phrase had went.
Whatever it was, he was heartened not to find it, and simply smiled before leading the way out the door.
Holmes remained bent at Mrs. Hudson’s feet, his eyes no longer closed as they had been throughout her account. “And did this gentleman say anything else while he was here? Come, woman, the slightest detail could be of importance!”
Lestrade’s officers had preceded him just before, taking away Macnair's body, and yet the evidence of the ordeal was still all around us. His bouquet of flowers remained carelessly thrown onto Holmes’ desk, and the glasses of whiskey were both strewn onto the floor, emptied of their poison into the floor and Holmes’ black pinstripe trousers. His vial of arsenic sat innocently on our breakfast table.
“A history lesson in the middle of what should be a murder - you are just as unique as your Watson claims.”
Holmes gave an elegant shrug, curled as he was on the bed. “At that, I can only speculate, my dear. Perhaps to remind himself from time to time that he had once been loved, even if it was in the past? It is not so uncommon after all, to keep remnants and gifts from old sweethearts, no matter how much time has passed.” He smiled at me knowingly, and I knew he was thinking of the toy soldier that sat on my bookshelf, given to me some fifteen years prior by a boy I had loved back in Edinburgh in my university days.
Abbott looked around, still bemused. I noticed that his handsome beard had in fact now been cut down to merely a recognizable mustache and some short, sharp sideburns. “I’m sorry, I thought I was here to meet an acquaintance, William Vernet- but you are Sherlock Holmes. are you not?”
After the conclusion of a case involving a widow, a walking stick, and a wardrobe, I did not know what to expect, and it is not without dread that I awoke the next morning, and was disheartened to see that it was raining thunderously outside my window, providing either of us with no escape. Still, I dressed and descended the steps to a late breakfast, braving myself to the other storm that could be brewing behind the sitting room door.
However instead of pulling me in as I envisioned he went suddenly in the opposite direction, jumping up and standing to face the fireplace in a pose of frustration made familiar to me by many years of cases. For the life of me I could not understand why it appeared now.
I sank slowly into my armchair, exhausted by the stressful events of the day. Holmes’ eyes were on me, I could feel their weight, and yet I said nothing so as to give him time to percolate, taking out my cufflinks as I waited. They had been a gift from him last Christmas, and I took care to wipe off any blood I could now, but they would need proper cleaning later. I placed them down onto my side table and sighed, only to find that Holmes’ gaze was still trained on me.
He gave the tucked flower a peculiar look before raising his eyes to mine, a small smile in its beginning stages upon his lips. “And what meaning would you yourself ascribe to the flower now?
He straightened, and his expression at once became controlled and very blank, and yet he did not move from in front of me, or remove his gaze. I realized that he was waiting for me to act - to determine where we went from here after he had just revealed a great deal of emotion, and put a great deal of himself on the line. I had always known him to be a brave man. My heart ached for him, words I would never have thought belonged out of the world of maudlin fiction, and I took both his hands into mine, pulling him in even as a proper response evaded me.
“Of course, I was foolish enough to believe I had a chance then, because surely, once we got past your grieving period you would come to see that he was merely a man like any other, smart yet selfish and bound to disappoint. Your hero worship of him could then cease and you would finally see the specimen you had in front of you, at your very beck and call!
He appeared to be a new man, but in the details I could see he was in fact a heightened form of himself. He now bore false sideburns that made his head seem rounder, almost. His cheeks were as clean shaven as ever, as was his liking, but he had done something to make them shine and it seemed as if his cheekbones were sharper and more defined along with some rouge. His hair was not slicked back in his usual style but fell differently around his face and into those new sideburns, glossy. His eyes were brighter somehow, as if he had outlined them to stand out so, and when I peered closer it seemed he had. He was dressed to the nines once again, but with some other flair that gave him a more dandyish air, most notably his elegant and richly coloured tailcoat, and large bow-tied cravat. Holmes had always been likened to be somewhat of an aesthete, but now it looked like he belonged fully as a member of that movement.
Sherlock collapsed back on the sofa, panting. It only took a second for a deep, shameful blush to set his face on fire, his kiss-swollen lips turning down into a grimace, his eyes looking anywhere but John.
“Dunno,” he croaked. God, he felt like shit. When he opened his eyes again, Sherlock’s face was clearer. He realized he was lying on the sofa and Sherlock was sitting on the coffee table, wiping him with a cool washcloth. Was he feverish? He felt hot. The fucking suit was still on him. His mind was sluggish, and he felt like a moron for getting himself nearly kidnapped again. At least he didn’t wake up to flames this time around.
His quick response made John laugh. “Probably,” he admitted. Not waiting any longer and pushing away all traces of doubt, John curled a hand around his side, and kissed him. He braced himself. He could do this. He would give Sherlock space, let him cope with things, but this time, he absolutely would not let him get high. They would go through the shock together, and John would be understanding when he pulled away. He knew the truth. He would--
“I was just asking,” John held up his hands. He busied himself by folding the blanket on the sofa. “So, are you going to dinner with her?”
Up to this point, Sherlock was not able to grasp the concept of the whole fuss about kissing or being with somebody. Sure, he has seen how it makes people happy, just taking a look at his parents but never once in his lifetime has he imagined that the simple act of his mouth meeting another mouth would trigger this rush of content and joy which is now pulsing through his body. Yet now that he has had it once, he doesn’t want to let it again. Not even for a single minute.
For a moment, there is nothing but deafening silence. It is second nature to Sherlock to analyze each and everybody by their looks, their expressions and the way they hold themselves. But for once in his lifetime, Sherlock has actually no clue what is going on in his best friend’s mind. Not to mention that he has never wished to be right about his deductions as much as he is now.
Yet, Sherlock decides not to pry. Trying to get information out of John that he isn’t willing to give on his own has proven itself to be a very bad idea. It has ended in screaming quite often and even with a slap in the face once. Speaking from experience, it is better to let the small man come to him on his own.
Huffing out an annoyed sigh, Sherlock shakes his head. “Not even you are enough of an idiot to not know that. After all-”
It’s even more obvious that his mind seems to always wander off in how determined his face sometimes looks only to crumple into unsureness again with the small wrinkles on his forehead and between his eyes deepening in concern and concentration. Then he pretends to read again only to watch Sherlock not even half a minute later. And really, the detective is clueless what all the bother is about.
“This still doesn’t tell me what you feel,” John mutters into the detective’s shoulder. The morning gown muffles his words yet even without saying anything, Sherlock would have known what his friend tried to say. He knows him after all.
John rolls his eyes harder than he normally does. “He wouldn’t make wrong conclusions, Sherlock. We lived together while studying at the hospital and one night he came back home earlier than he was supposed to. I wasn’t alone that evening and I wasn’t with a girl, is that enough of an explanation for the greatest detective of all time?”
“Great,” Watson says. Now he does sound annoyed, “Thanks for showing off once again. Yes, my day was shit if you must know.”
“I knew he was trying to set us up,” the detective muses, “But since you so strongly disagreed when I thought you were flirting with me, I came to the conclusion that he had made some wrong deductions concerning you – just like most people do.”
Lips cut him off quite efficiently. Although it does feel a little awkward at first when Sherlock still has his mouth slightly opened and since he hasn’t done something like this ever since the incident with Janine. Yet he recalls how to do this (at least he thinks he does) and tries give John as much of a good kiss as he deserves. After all, five years of waiting surely have contained a bit of imagination on the doctor’s part. Well, maybe it was not only Watson who has dreamed.
He remembers vividly how his older brother has always suspected something in that direction – and acted on it only when it was too late. Back when John and Mary got married, he didn’t manage to get to the party (nobody knows why) to give Sherlock his moral support. The detective had to suffer through the whole day alone, give a speech during which he basically confessed to his best friend in front of everybody since he was too bloody nervous to actually say what he had rehearsed.
He was more worried about what was supposed to happen after dinner than anything else. How could he fake being experienced? He had knowledge of what went on during sex with another man. He had watched pornography over the years out of curiosity and read up on how to perform anal sex on the internet. He found the porn to be ridiculous more often than not, but sometimes, he would come across a video that would have him growing hard and reluctantly shoving a hand into his pants, finishing the job quickly. He abstained from sex for so long, all to keep his mind functioning at its best. Now, he was completely out of his depth. John was not. John had sex numerous times throughout his life. Surely, he would detect Sherlock’s inexperience?
John got up and walked to the doctor, and then they engaged in further conversation as Sherlock retreated into his own head. The past several minutes with John were
“I’m just saying. It’ll be fine. We’ll be here on Saturday, anyway. You were planning on having her here, right?”
But John was tired of their aborted conversations. “Talk to me, Sherlock. You should at least tell me what the fuck was going on in your head. You did it to protect us--yeah, I get it, and for some reason, you didn’t want me with you--”
John’s eyes burned from fatigue, but he startled into full alertness when he felt Sherlock’s hand twitch under his.
John did not want her touching him like this. He tried moving, but his arms stayed weak by his sides. Something about being manhandled by Mary was humiliating, especially in front of Sherlock. His skin was crawling, and he wanted to push her away.  He felt no comfort in her embrace. He looked past her face and at Sherlock.
bad--nor had he ever seen John in such a state before when he broke down into tears, and it shook Sherlock to his very core. John’s small, agonized sobs broke Sherlock’s heart, and he wished he had been able to hug John under happier circumstances. Learning about John’s guilt over cheating made Sherlock understand his recent behavior better, and he deduced that John never really blamed him for Mary’s death, but himself. It seemed obvious, in the end.
“You, um, you know I’m a romantic, but I don’t think I knew how much or what that really meant before we met.” Was he making sense? It made sense in his head. “You make me feel in a way I never felt before.”
John cleared his throat and started to walk into the kitchen, trying to function through the fog in his head. “Teaching her how to deduce?” he tried to sound casual. He put the bags on the counter and began to put the food away.
Sherlock could picture it now. First, John would be confused, but then he would mourn over the dead wife he couldn’t even remember. He would look at old pictures of her, especially the ones of her with Rosie when she was first born, and wish that he remembered her. He would then feel guilty all over again for cheating on his wife who then went and took a bullet for his friend before he could come clean. Sherlock wasn’t sure if he would be able to take that. He wouldn’t be able to handle John mourning and moping for the woman who was the cause of the scar on his chest and the worst rift in their relationship ever. Their relationship had been recovering when Sherlock came back from the dead in 2014, and their downfall had been because of her. Sleep-deprived, hungry, and shocked, Sherlock could admit to himself that he just could not
And now, suddenly, Sherlock looked like he could have started crying. His eyes turned ridiculously blue, face open and vulnerable. “John?” he rasped.
? This was dangerous. This was doomed from the start. John would likely regain some of his memory, and when he did, he would certainly hate Sherlock. He would probably never forgive him for this. But John was able to forgive him for faking his death; that was much bigger, right? Sherlock thought it was. Maybe John would forgive this, too?
“Hm, don’t think so. You should go home. You might look young still, but you look worse for wear. When’s the last time you shaved? I don’t think I’ve ever seen you with stubble.”
“Fucking Christ,” John groaned, squirming, his cock begging for attention, tingling with pleasure. “Look at you.” He rubbed this thumb over Sherlock’s tip again, smearing the hot, sticky liquid.
John whipped around, and the blood drained from his face. Irene was coming from Sherlock’s bedroom. John turned back around, staring at the floor, a ball of anxiety smashing into his chest. She--she did that before. Back then, he and Sherlock came home to find her in his bed. She liked to get a rise out of people. It didn’t have to mean anything.
“Here I am,” he mused. John licked his lips. “Is this your ‘kiss me’ face?” he asked, voice turning husky.
“John,” Sherlock said breathlessly above him, “John…” He trailed off, seemingly afraid to ask for more.
“Hello, brother dear,” Sherlock had a cheesy smile. “Yes, I’m awake. What an idiotic question. Order your staff to keep an eye on Baker Street until you apprehend my would-be killer...Yes, it was Mary. John was right….I want to come home, that’s why.” He grimaced. “Well, convince the hospital to discharge me! John can take care of everything….” A smirk. “Glad you understand.” He hung up and gave the phone back to John.
“Reading in on her sofa. She didn’t say a word the entire time, and you know what? Neither did I. I didn’t have anything to say to her.”
John’s lips pulled up into a tiny smile. “Yeah,” he turned his face towards him. “I am. You think Mrs. Hudson would be angry watching Rosie tomorrow night?”
“I--need another moment, please,” he whispered. His thumb stroked over John’s cheek, and his eyes opened. They were a deep blue, darker than usual, and vulnerable. “I’ve wanted you for a long time,” he spoke quietly, rawness in his voice. “You’re the best man I’ve ever known.”
John was on his stomach and sat up on his elbows. He cupped Sherlock’s bruised face gently, cautiously, and brought their lips together. Sherlock sobbed into his mouth, the warmth of John’s lips a better balm on his wounds than any medicine. He tossed the ice pack aside and it landed somewhere on the floor.
Sherlock swallowed. He was completely unaccustomed to being coddled like this, and it made him feel a bit shy. “It’s okay,” he mumbled. “What you were doing, it was nice.”
,” he cried, chest heaving with small sobs. “Please, I’m sorry, I love you,” he babbled. “I love you. You can’t do this to me again,” he choked out, Sherlock’s expressionless, clammy face sending horrible chills down his spine. He didn’t have the capacity to process any of this--it all felt like a dream (
John took off his jacket and shoes and joined him. He turned on his side and held out his arms, eyes growing wet again. “Come here.”
“No.” Sherlock said petulantly, wrapping his arms around John’s middle and burying his face into his shoulder. “I like it here, even if you’re a filthy liar.”
Sherlock sprung into action. “Well, Molly, Mrs. Hudson, don’t you think it’s time to give Rosie her gifts?”
Sherlock stopped pacing, horror dropping into the pit of his stomach like a ton of bricks. This was going to make John miserable on all counts. An image of John living alone invaded his brain. He pictured John sliding back into the depressive state he was in before they met (Sherlock had read John’s early blog posts, and the sheer hopelessness in the tone of his posts was all he needed to deduce his mental state. They never talked about it because they rarely talked about their pasts, and Sherlock could not bear to think about John like that). The feeling in his gut rose like vomit up his esophagus, nearly making Sherlock choke. He was so
Mary looked like she wanted to vomit. She took off her wedding ring and slammed it down on the table with a clang. “Take it back.”
John looked caught between wanting to protest and grinning. He pressed his lips together. “Just, don’t ever think I don’t care about you, okay? You’re everything to me.”
“Why do I keep fucking up?” he asked himself, not paying any mind to the visitors and nurses passing by. Why was he such a fucking screw up?
“Well, you’ll figure it out,” Sherlock said briskly. “Thank you for this, John,” he lifted his injured hand.
John crossed his arms over his chest, sighing, feeling stiff from spending so much time in the chair. His thoughts wouldn’t cease, drilling a hole in the center of his forehead. He was so consumed by the crippling guilt wrapping around his gut that he didn’t even notice when Sherlock fell back asleep, worn out from leaving the bed, until a nurse came in a few minutes later to bring in his lunch, and she and John both found him out cold. Sherlock’s face wasn’t at ease; he was frowning in pain even in his sleep.
