We met at the laboratory, where I found Holmes once again immersed in some experiment, surrounded by test tubes and liquids. It was a short ride to the address of our new lodgings, at 221B, Baker Street, and as I sat beside him in the hansom I strove to make conversation without dwelling too much on the imposing presence beside me. Despite his leanness, Holmes' height and the wiry strength of his body, evident even beneath his suit and ulster, lent him an air of suppressed power. Just as he had at our first meeting, he seemed to be humming with barely suppressed excitement, and I could only conclude that his experiments had gone well.
“I believe you have ample evidence that I do not object to criminal activity, at least in particular circumstances,” I reminded him with a sideways look.
“And now, doctor, I suggest you depart. You may make your report. It matters not to me. I will deal with Holmes later and I doubt that, once I have taken care of him, I will have any more trouble from you.”
I sensed Holmes shift beside me and hastily looked away from my old friend, fixing my eyes on Annie Harrison, his fiancée. She was undoubtedly striking, with her olive skin and dark eyes, and her steady gaze radiated a sense of strength and calm that was appealing. Unlike myself, Phelps had never, to my knowledge, taken an interest in women. For a moment I felt a flash of pity for both of them. I was rarely in a position to feel thankful for the fact that I had no living relatives but I was struck forcibly by the thought that my isolation allowed me far greater freedom than most of my countrymen, who must marry or face the suspicion, disappointment or even ruin of their families.
“There is still time. I believe there is a performance of Wagner coming soon to Covent Garden. Perhaps I can be of assistance to someone with a private box. As a last resort, there is always Mycroft. And in the meantime I have no shortage of other fantasies that we can work on fulfilling.”
“I told you.”
“Allow me to clarify,” I said, in the cold clipped tone I had learned from the man who was currently resting his dark head in the hollow of my shoulder, just above my rapidly beating heart. “Unsatisfied with the way I was carrying out your instructions – investigating your case, at your bequest, and on your behalf – you travelled to Montpellier and concealed yourself in some other establishment, without seeing fit to inform me that you had left Baker Street, where I was diligently wiring daily accounts of my progress?”
“I am sure it is nothing important. Perhaps he simply does not wish to draw you away from the investigation. After all, the treaty was stolen in London and it is here that the answer must lie.”
Accustomed as I was to Holmes’ love of drama, I smiled to myself as I awaited his next move, certain that he would startle and amaze Phelps with his deductions and impatient to witness my old friend’s surprise at his powers of insight.
It was Holmes’ turn to flinch, I saw with a savage pleasure, as my blow hit home. Then I paused, appalled, as it occurred to me that only an hour ago Holmes had ripped his hands to shreds saving my life, and now we were tearing each other apart.
He turned a look of great curiosity on Holmes, who was standing near the doorway, his gaze fixed on Phelps’ pale face.
“I think it would be best if you found somewhere else to live,” he said. “Now that I have so many regular clients I am no longer in need of a companion with whom to split the rent. I will give you a week or two to make alternative arrangements.”
“I am afraid so,” said Holmes gently, examining his hastily wrapped bandage and so avoiding bearing witness to the moisture that had risen in Phelps’ eyes.
I have never hated anyone as much as I hated the woman. And yet, I acknowledged to myself grudgingly, as I fell back onto Holmes' bed, the detective's warm weight pressing down on top of me, her presence in our lives had worked a small miracle. Without her, I would never have known that, although I might never have Holmes' love, I had his trust. As the detective tugged off my shirt and began to kiss his way down my chest, that seemed almost as precious a gift.
I have already written of my first encounter with Sherlock Holmes, but I must admit in these private memoirs that there remain many details of the first weeks and months of our acquaintance that I felt it necessary to omit from my public account. I mentioned, I think, that my time as a Doctor of Medicine in the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers had brought me nothing but misfortune and disaster. That was the truth and I am guilty only of recording in too little detail what that meant. After the fateful shooting at the battle of Maiwand, I was left with a shattered bone and a damaged artery, but far worse were the wounds inflicted upon my mind. The effects of prolonged agony on the human body I was only too familiar with, having witnessed pain and suffering in Afghanistan that I had never imagined during my medical training in London. What I was not prepared for was the toll the war and my own injury would take on my mental fortitude.
Sherlock meant it when he told John that he doesn’t have a death wish and he’s not trying to make John angry anymore, so it’s not a calculation but a misstep, a tiny error of judgement, which leads to disaster. Sherlock miscalculates a step and trips ungracefully over the edge of a Turkish rug as he’s drawing back from the knife-wielding murderer whose husband Sherlock has just deduced is lying in pieces under the floorboards on which they stand. She catches him in the sternum with the tip of the blade and draws it all the way across the right side of his chest to his shoulder before John tackles her and she thuds to the ground under his weight, the knife skittering away under the sofa where Sherlock must remember to tell Lestrade to look for it later.
“I don't know how they managed to obtain a medical certificate – if she died of an overdose of chloroform then perhaps they were able to make it appear like heart trouble.”
“That was unexpected,” I muttered, half under my breath.
“You are a better companion than I deserve,” he said quietly. “Do not think that I am unaware of it.”
“Precisely. I had already left when I received your message, but I know that you do not ask for such details if they are not crucial to the case, even if you do not see fit to share your reasoning. I wired to the manager of the hotel there immediately.”
“Very well, if your friend desires to see you alone, do not let me come between you,” he said, as he folded his tall body into his chair and began to pack the bowl with coarse shag.
“You are right,” I said.
“Nonetheless, I fear that my talents at dissembling do not always extend to how I feel about you. I am a stupider man than you give me credit for. It took me all night to figure out what the Shlessingers planned to do with you. It was no prevarication when I told you that emotion does not aid in the art of criminal detection. Knowing that you were in danger made it almost impossible for me to think. You can have no idea how it felt to know that the only way I could save you was to use my brain and yet find myself utterly incapable of preventing myself from dwelling on what would happen if I did not save you, to the exclusion of all else. As it was, I was almost too late. When I saw you in that coffin, I was certain that I had failed you.”
“And I’d spend every moment of my life with her wishing that I was instead with Sherlock Holmes,” I said gently. “My dear fellow, I do not want that life. I do not want any other life than the one I have with you. The Watson in my stories is a poorer man than I in every respect, because he does not know the Holmes that I know.”
“I suppose that man Phelps does not drink?”
Sherlock struggles to his feet and forces himself to place equal weight on the ankle that still feels as though someone has stuck two hot needles right through the skin and into the bone. The snake wasn’t venomous but it turns out its bite is still decidedly unpleasant. Worth it though, Sherlock thinks, ruthlessly suppressing a smile.
“It does not tell us very much, does it?” he said, holding it loosely in his long fingers.
Holmes gave a strange, fleeting smile that was almost a grimace.
Rising from the chair I had occupied by the window, I crossed to the sofa where he sat, his face set and determined.
By night, however, everything had changed. When Holmes caught me staring at him with hungry eyes as he stroked his bow across the strings of his violin, his gaze would darken in a way that left me melting, ready to crawl to him across the floor of Baker Street and worship him. One evening, when I acted on this previously unthinkable impulse, he demonstrated the extent of his self-control by continuing to play as I unfastened his trousers and began to stroke him. His bowing did not falter even when I took him in my mouth, his music becoming wilder and increasing its tempo as I increased mine, until finally he broke off playing with a ragged chord just before he spilled on my tongue. When I found him lounging on the sofa, wrapped in his blue dressing gown, his perfectly sculpted feet bare and a slice of his angular chest on display between the buttons of his lazily fastened shirt, I no longer had to steal covert glances at him in the looking glass above the mantlepiece or the reflective silver surface of the coffee pot, but allowed myself to feast my eyes on the sight of him, just as I knew he wished me to, until one or other of us lost patience and we collided like meteors in a shower of sparks.
“Your hands are shaking,” he said gently. “They do that only when you have not had a drink in more than a day. Having seen your watch before we took up residence together, it did not take long to notice the symptom or to deduce its cause.”
I awoke late the following morning to find that Holmes had already breakfasted and was making ready to go out. I saw his eyes take in my unruly hair, which I had not yet taken the time to tame, and flicker briefly to the mottled skin of my wrists. The smile that touched his lips echoed the happiness in my own heart and I had crossed the room and kissed him on his shapely lips before I could think twice about such an intimate gesture and what it might convey. Although it broke the unspoken pact we seemed to have adopted to save our illicit activities for the hours of darkness, he did not pull away and we shared a warm, lingering kiss by the door, Holmes holding his hat in one hand, about to depart. When it was over, he met my rapidly darkening eyes with a knowing look.
The culmination of that strange and macabre case I have detailed elsewhere, but I will add here that it was the moment when I made the first big leap in understanding that allowed me to begin to truly know Holmes. Although murder had been committed, the case was far from black and white, and in the patient way he listened to Jefferson Hope’s story and the understanding written on his fine features I saw that he was moved by the man’s tale of loss and revenge. I began to realise that Holmes’ coldness stemmed from his determination to base his deductions solely on facts and to suspect that perhaps he was not incapable of feeling emotions, only unusually capable of suppressing them.
“Boredom was certainly one of the reasons,” said Holmes. “You may be content with the relentless ennui of existence, though from my observations I think that unlikely. I, however, cannot survive each crawling day in this world of violence and petty cruelty and endless, endless stupidity without a stimulus for the mind. If there is no puzzle to occupy me, I find that a dose of cocaine or morphine usually suffices. And now I think I will retire to my bed. No doubt your hypocritical objections to my lifestyle will keep until the morning. I imagine your upcoming nuptials will provide you with just the reason you are looking for to leave Baker Street and your disappointing former colleague behind you.”
Sherlock blinks. John’s face is now worried, as well as angry. Sherlock blinks again. Something is still wrong with his brain. Is this what it’s like to be ordinary? Dear God, it’s intolerable.
“You said you loved me.”
All night, as my body lay in Baker Street, my mind roamed the battlefield of Maiwand, sometimes alone, sometimes with Holmes at my side. Once, he kissed me so sweetly and passionately that when he stopped I begged him to kiss me again, but he turned away in disgust, leaving me calling after him. Another time he appeared in Afghan garb. Just as I recognised the pale grey eyes in the sun-browned face, he shot me and I felt the bullet burning through my shoulder as he laughed.
Unable to meet his eye, I stepped over to the window, where I watched Miss Morstan make her way down the street, a graceful, elegant figure with energy in her step. Behind me, I heard Holmes settle back onto the sofa and begin the familiar ritual of lighting his pipe, which he often smoked when immersed in deep thought.
I had leapt to my feet and stood with my revolver in my hand as Holmes waited, poised, for some signal I could not discern. We watched in silence as two figures levered themselves up from the tunnel and into the room. Only once they were standing in the cellar, surveying the crates of gold with a look of awe, did Holmes spring forward and grasp the taller of the two men by the collar. I saw the other reach for his revolver and raised mine, my hands sure and steady as I aimed, but, moving so fast that I almost missed it, Holmes lashed out with the metal end of the crop. The blow collided squarely with the thief’s wrist and he dropped his gun with a howl, as I wondered just how many uses Holmes had for his chosen weapon.
“She is an admirable woman.”
“And why not?” I prompted patiently.
“Have no fear, my dear friend,” he said. “Not one of the qualities that you characterise as vices has ever made me like you any the less and I’ll wager there is not a man on earth who thinks you either weak or broken, save only for you yourself.”
“Well Watson, what do you make of the matter?” Holmes asked me, as soon as his client left. It occurred to me that he never failed to ask my opinion, despite the fact that my limited insight was certain to be of no use to him. Busy remembering the breathless sound of my first name on his lips, I confessed myself entirely baffled by the tale – not an abnormal state of affairs. Holmes, as confident as ever in his own abilities, retired to the sofa with his pipe, ordering me not to disturb him, and I sat fiddling with a manuscript at the table. It was a relief when, an hour or two later, he suggested we go to a concert, for Holmes always enjoyed music when he was mulling over a problem and I always took pleasure in his enjoyment.
“I fear that the conspiracy against me is more complicated than I was able express when I saw you and Mr Holmes yesterday. Last night, I slept without a nurse in the room for the first time. Since the fever, I sleep lightly – indeed, I cannot help it, for I fear falling back into those same endless cyclical nightmares that dogged me every hour of the night during my long weeks of illness. About two in the morning, I was aroused by a slight noise. It took me some few moments to realise that there was a man at the window. When my eyes adjusted, I realised that the face was a familiar one – it was Joseph.”
“I didn’t rescue you,” I protested, unwilling to be distracted, even by Holmes, in his unforgettable way. “I got you locked up.”
“Why not?”
I was recalling the insistent slow push of him inside me and the ease with which he had reduced me to an incoherent, writhing mess within minutes. He had taken me slowly, learning every inch of my body with his hands and tongue, and I, in turn, had learned that he reached completion as silently as he laughed, clutching my hips in a bruising grip as he spent himself inside me. But in the darkness, I had not been able to see his expression, to study the colour of his eyes as he finally lost control.
And so I became the unofficial assistant of the world's only consulting detective.
“I would have been here from the beginning, if you had asked me,” he said.
“Comfortable though the rug doubtless is, I was hoping you would accompany into my bedroom,” he said. “I am not finished with you yet.”
Perhaps it was inevitable that it was over quickly. A few minutes of ruthless self-control, as I listened to his quiet gasps and a smattering of urgent words uttered too quietly for me to hear, were all I could manage before the urgency of my need overtook me and I increased my speed, my strokes becoming stuttering and irregular as I approached my release. Words of affection, of love, threatened to pour from my lips and I bit down on the thick line of muscle where his shoulder met his neck as I felt him approach his own climax. I was half-aware that he was no more in control than I, a thought that only pushed me closer to the edge. Too soon, knowing that I could not last much longer, I released my clutch on his hip to take him in my hand, tugging at him urgently in time with my thrusts. He came apart almost immediately, bucking before me as his warm fluids coated my fingers. I convulsed inside him a moment later, his name spilling from my lips as I did so.
“I suspected,” he said quietly. “The positioning of the bell-pull, coupled with that of the vent, were highly suggestive.”
“I hope that Mrs Hudson did not hear that,” I said, already overcome with remorse at the risk I had brought upon him.
John sighs but his mouth curves upwards at the corners. Sherlock knows that smile. It’s the reluctant version of the soft smile, the one John uses when he calls Sherlock an idiot.
He gave a wicked grin.
“Miscalculated what? You know as well as I do that if you call an unhinged killer holding a knife one of the stupidest people in Britain they’re likely to take a swing at you. I mean, if you called a random bloke down the pub one of the stupidest people in Britain in that tone of voice he’d have a swing at you too but at least he probably wouldn’t be holding an enormous bloody knife at the time.”
“Holmes,” I whispered. “I am so sorry.”
Holmes had given no indication of his feelings towards me – other than his obvious, surprising, electrifying appreciation of my battered body. Having often heard him remark on the dangers of sentiment, I had no idea whether he might wish to repeat our unorthodox activities or whether he intended to put them behind us and return to a state of amiable friendship – and I could think of no acceptable way to ask him. I was uncomfortably aware that, having expressed no sexual interest in me, despite, as I now knew, having divined my attraction to him several months ago, Holmes had chosen to escalate our relationship to a physical level only when he was heavily drugged and half crazed with anger. The thought of never being able to kiss him again was more painful than I would ever wish him to know, and yet I could not be sure that he would welcome any attempt on my part to repeat what we had shared. In addition, I could not in good conscience ignore the fact that our activities of the preceding night would be viewed by the wider world as the most repulsive form of perversion and that, should they ever be discovered, Holmes’ life would be destroyed. A detective could not attract clients if he was himself discovered to be engaging in criminal acts, particularly acts of the nature we had indulged in, and I knew that without his puzzles Holmes would never have a moment’s happiness – save, perhaps, at the tip of a needle.
“John, I – I do,” he says.
“Oh yes. Very nice. This could be perfect.”
Some minutes passed in silence and I wondered if we were to return to our state of cold distance but to my relief Holmes soon began speaking to me of the case.
The hideous, decrepit old man who had replaced my handsome, vigorous young friend, twitched and writhed and then said, in a hoarse, muffled voice, “I know nothing about any man. No one has been in here all day until that young gentleman broke in and disturbed my rest.”
“Dear Annie’s brother, Joseph Harrison.”
The King was still lamenting his situation and the power that Miss Adler held over his upcoming nuptials.
Holmes’ breath hitched, very slightly. His eyes were pitiless as he reached forward and ran one long finger slowly along the line of my jaw, so lightly I could barely feel it. When a shiver ran though me at his touch, his eyes blazed in triumph.
Here I stopped, realising too late that what had begun as an attempt at scientific research had taken an altogether more dangerous turn. I knew that, ravaged as I was by war, I could not possibly be considered attractive by a man like Holmes. I was anyway certain that he was not an invert, although I had never heard him express any particular admiration for women, even after I had quite unselfconsciously remarked on the beauty of a well-dressed young lady who had arrived one afternoon to avail herself of Holmes’ help. I confess I had wondered if he shared my own unusual preferences, my curiosity sparked by Stamford’s unexplained reservations about living with the man, but as our acquaintance grew I was certain that his inclinations did not tend towards my own – which, after all, were deemed by respectable society to be both unnatural and unlawful. In fact, Holmes rarely expressed admiration for anyone, seeming far more preoccupied with his books and his experiments than he was with human beings.
It was strange to see Percy Phelps again after so many years. He was lying on a sofa in a room that was furnished both as a sitting room and as a bedroom, clearly a space that had been adapted to a long convalescence. My eyes fixed immediately on his face, pale and tinged faintly yellow by long illness, his eyes limpid blue and too large in his thin face. He gave a half smile as he met my eyes and despite my shock at his appearance I found myself smiling back, suddenly reminded of the uncomplicated happiness of our former intimacy, all innocence and curiosity, free from the emotional weight and irresistible, sometimes painful pull that Holmes exerted over me.
It was not Holmes’ naked body that held me captive, however, but his eyes. I had admired them in many moods and in many lights, but never at such close quarters. Last night, I recalled, they had been almost black, liquid and compelling and burning with anger. In this stolen moment of calm, they were clear and bright and uniquely unguarded. My habit of cataloguing every stolen detail of Holmes’ actions and appearance awoke within me and I began swiftly to record their myriad shades – the cool lustre of water under a winter sky, the bewitching sheen of quicksilver, the raw gleam of steel. I was lost in trying to think of the right word to describe a shade of grey that was almost green – perhaps the muted velvet of a sage plant or the matte shine of an olive leaf – when Holmes began to laugh.
I felt myself flush at his words. I had always known that to Holmes I was in all probability an object of pity, no different from the men I had tried to patch back together on the frontlines as they moaned and screamed, all traces of dignity lost to them, or those who had lain beside me in the hospital as I raved and burned with fever, their eyes dead and their bodies ruined. But to see him acknowledge my weakened state so clearly was worse even than hearing his casual identification of its many shameful manifestations.
Miss Adler turned her dark eyes on me and I saw that they were dancing with amusement.
I felt Holmes’ hand fumbling at my chest and then he was gripping me tightly, both hands clenched like iron around my upper arms.
“You are aroused by it,” he murmured, his voice husky in my ear.
He hummed silkily.
The door was stronger than it looked, and I had to throw my body against it three times before it finally gave and I tumbled into the room. It was empty. No furniture stood on the ancient boards, no curtains shielded the windows. The only objects in the room were a heap of wooden crates and a pile of rags in the corner. I ignored the blond stranger, who was firing questions at me, and set to searching the room. I had examined the unmarked crates and was about to kick out at the heap of filthy, torn fabric to see what lay beneath when I realised that there was a person half-hidden in the folds of cloth. It was an old, disfigured man, his face deeply lined and misshapen by a hideous scar that twisted his lip upwards at a dreadful angle. His hair was grey, his mouth drooping and his eyes rheumy and bloodshot – and a very familiar shade of grey. The old man must have seen my eyes widen and a name form on my lips, because he shook his head once, very slightly, Holmes’ eyes staring up at me from his wrinkled face.
“Thank you, Mr Holmes. You are every bit the man that Watson assured me you were,” he said, and I coughed suddenly as the breath I had started to take caught in my lungs. Phelps continued quickly, “But I do not quite understand what drove Joseph to steal the treaty. I believed him to be my friend and I confess I was looking forward to counting him my brother-in-law.”
“I must admit I would relish the chance to duel with her again,” he mused. “I rarely fail, and it is not a sensation I enjoy.”
Dawn was breaking when the delirium lifted, and I knew at last that I was in Baker Street. I was lying atop the bed, naked in the cold winter air, my shoulder aching and burning as it had in the weeks after my injury. When I turned my head in search of my watch, hoping that I had remembered to wind it the night before, I saw Holmes lying beside me. His eyes, as pale and brilliant as sunshine on snow, were fixed on me. I stared at him for several long seconds, believing – hoping – that I was still in the throes of the fever.
“Because I know you. I know you think sentiment isn’t your area, but you feel things more deeply than anyone else I know.”
He was still standing some ten feet away from me and I could not take my eyes off him.
Before I could respond to this outrageous statement, there was a rustle of fabric in the dark and suddenly Holmes was looming behind me, his hands gripping my shoulders. He held me in a vice-like grip as he bent forward and ran his tongue down the side of my neck. His mouth was burning hot in the cold of the cellar and it paused over my pulse point, as though measuring my increasingly rapid heartbeat. I felt, more than heard, Holmes’ words as he ceased his ministrations to whisper in my ear: “Bend over the crate and do not make a sound.”
It was only after he left that I realised my whole body was shaking. Though I took deep, steady breaths, it took a long time for it to stop. I lay waiting for Holmes to return, already bitterly regretting the awful words I had flung at him, even as his own hateful insinuations echoed in my head. I did not believe that it would be possible to fall asleep. As the minutes passed, however, the events of the day began to take their toll and my eyes grew heavy even as I jolted myself repeatedly back into wakefulness, guarding against Holmes’ return and the inevitable nightmares.
“Joseph was the thief!” Phelps cried, when Holmes finished his story, and I saw that he had turned quite white. “All that time, it was he who had taken the treaty. He knew that the papers were in the very room with me as I lay raving and insensible with fever.”
“Braggart.”
In answer, he kissed me, his firm lips slamming against mine with unexpected violence. His hands were fisting in my hair and I found myself kneeling between his spread knees, gripping his shirt tightly, bunching it against the firm muscles of his back as our tongues duelled and our breathing sounded loud and urgent in the silence. Holmes moaned as I drew back, catching his lower lip between my teeth as I did so. For a moment I was staring into his eyes, wide and black with desire above flushed cheeks, and then his hand was at the back of my neck and he was kissing me again, even more urgently than before. He did not pull back, even when his hands slid round to my chest and he began to unbutton my waistcoat. As he fumbled with my buttons, he sure fingers suddenly uncertain, I ran my hands up his strong thighs, feeling the thick muscles give beneath the firm press of my fingers. Finding the bulging evidence of his arousal at their apex, I began to stoke him through his trousers, at which he pushed my waistcoat roughly off my shoulders and tore so urgently at my shirt that I felt one of the buttons fly off and heard it skitter away across the floor.
“Happily, it is easily remedied,” I said. “The constable will be back in a minute and we shall fetch Inspector Bradstreet. He will release you immediately he grasps your true identity.”
I let his finger slide out of my mouth, caressing it with my tongue as he reluctantly withdrew it.
“I found her just entering its vestibule,” he explained. “It was almost noon and just as I was wondering on what pretext to follow her, a tall, dark man came rushing out and dragged me inside, where I became the sole witness to the tying up of Irene Adler and a Mr Godfrey Norton.”
“Go to bed, Sherlock. Your bed.”
I did so just as I finally wrapped my lips around his member, sinking slowly down until I had taken his entire length and he was pressed against the back of my throat. He cupped one hand around my face, feeling the working of my throat and jaw, even as the other kept a firm grip on my hair, holding me in place as I pleasured him. I had enough experience of kneeling before my friend to know exactly how to please him and I used everything I had ever learned, silently expressing my gratitude, my longing and my desire for every part of him with my hands, my lips and my tongue. When I slid one finger into my mouth along with his cock and then ran it, wet and slippery, up between his buttocks to tap gently over his fundament, he began to shudder involuntarily, thrusting deeper into my mouth. As I gently pushed inside, he let out a string of expletives, choking out words I had never heard him utter and had never suspected him of knowing. I could no longer resist my own consuming need. Reaching down, I began to stroke my aching member in time with my movements, desperate for release. When Holmes saw what I was doing, he let out a low moan and drew back, freeing himself from my mouth.
My first case with Sherlock Holmes changed my perception of him utterly. I had already marvelled at his intelligence and observed, half in admiration and half in censure, his extreme confidence, which at times bordered on conceit. Witnessing him at the scene of a crime, however, I began to realise that for all my study of Holmes I had never before seen him at his most vital and compelling.
He gets to his feet, wincing at the stab of pain behind his eyes, washes his mouth out thoroughly, examining the strange grey hue of his skin in the mirror, and staggers down the hallway. John has his back to the door. He is staring down at the two mugs in front of him. The smoke has dissipated – luckily the window had been open when Sherlock conducted the experiment – but there is a strange heavy smell in the air, metallic and alien. The remains of the poison are still on the table, soggy and black in a small puddle of cold tea.
On a case, Holmes was often driven by a tireless, animal-like energy. I had seen him go days without sleep or food when immersed in solving a particularly difficult mystery. His compulsion to uncover the solution to each puzzle that crossed his path was enough to keep him working with a machine-like determination, but I confess that there were times when it was only my own compulsion to understand Holmes that kept me by his side when a warm dinner and a soft bed awaited me at Baker Street. Over the next two days, Holmes was relentless. He disappeared the following morning, again choosing to conduct his investigations alone, and I did not see him until that evening, when he returned in high spirits, his eyes alight with excitement.
John is staring at him and Sherlock drops his eyes.
I had begun to think that the inspector was not a very smart man.
Holmes punished me – or perhaps rewarded me – with a flurry of long, deep thrusts.
“And you were spying on us, I suppose?”
Holmes glanced at me with a familiar smile as I took my seat opposite him, then returned to the newspaper as I turned my attention to my eggs, fervently grateful that Mrs Hudson was accustomed to the strange demands of his profession and the odd hours at which we often chose to dine. As Holmes read and I breakfasted, I wondered how and when to broach some of the dozens of questions running through my mind. I desperately wanted to know how long he had been an addict and how often he filled his empty hours with a shot of morphine or cocaine. Even more desperately, I wanted to know what had driven him to the anger he had displayed the previous night, whether he had truly intended me to kiss him and why, if kissing me was something he wanted, he had not done it earlier.
It was the following evening, after breaking the news to Miss Morstan that she had not inherited a treasure – and from making plain, in the kindest and subtlest way I knew how that I was not a man in whom she should invest any romantic hopes – that I came home to find Holmes on the sofa with an empty syringe beside him and a drop of blood in the crook of his arm.
“How are you feeling, my dear doctor?” he said, and I closed my eyes in despair as I realised that he was really lying beside me. I remembered the cool cloth on my brow and understood that he had been ministering to me for hours in my delirium.
I finally fell into an exhausted sleep in the early hours, only to awaken just after dawn from a horrific nightmare in which I was back at Maiwand and was caught in delicate circumstances with a soldier from my brigade. We had been court marshalled and were about to be executed when I awoke, sweating and in pain, my shoulder throbbing in a way it had not in many weeks.
“Come Holmes, you must stop this. Phelps has eyes for no one but his wife to be,” I said, exasperated. My heart soared as I sensed him break into laughter behind me.
When John finally does say it, Sherlock isn’t expecting it. In fact, Sherlock is on the floor of the bathroom, his skin grey and his stomach empty but still roiling and twisting like it’s trying to claw its way out of his mouth.
“You should have done it,” I gasped.
“It was you who took me in your mouth,” I said, daring him to respond. “Among other things. In fact, I believe you initiated all three of our nocturnal encounters.”
“Damn you,” he hissed. His face was twisted with anger and his strong hands clenched into fists at his sides. He took two heavy steps towards Holmes, only to stop as Bradstreet raised his own weapon warningly, his face furrowed with disappointment, anger and sadness.
“What did Wainwright want from Whitney?” I asked. “We must end this farce immediately and take you home to Baker Street.”
The following morning, Holmes and I were at breakfast when I received a telegram. “Jagged or torn,” it said. It had come from Baden.
“Mmmm?”
Smiling despite myself, I rolled over, and was struck silent by the sight of him. Holmes lay atop the coverlet, his long limbs pale and glowing in the clear morning light. The room still lay mostly in shadow, but a single sunbeam had crept around the edge of the hastily drawn curtains, illuminating the sharp angle of Holmes’ right hip and his narrow, finely muscled chest. The fine smattering of dark hair that narrowed to a thin, beckoning line towards the base of his stomach was as black as the locks on his head, which were wildly dishevelled, standing out in all directions. A flush of dark heat ran through my body as I recalled the verve with which I had run my hands through it as we kissed, euphoric at finally being free to perform a gesture that I had itched to execute a hundred times.
Stamford’s stated misgivings about the man – his eccentric set of interests, including an enthusiasm for science and an aptitude for chemistry – seemed hardly reason enough to object to him, particularly given my own vices, and I hastened to suggest a meeting. I had already partaken of several glasses of wine by the time we made our way to the hospital, Stamford still seeming to wish to impart some obscure warning about Holmes, who he described as cold-blooded and possessed of a passion for exact knowledge. His vague objections, and his wild tale of Holmes beating subjects in the dissecting room with a stick, served only to enhance my curiosity. By the time we reached the hospital, I was so engaged in finding out more about the man that I hardly noticed the familiar sounds and smells that had plunged me into a deplorable state of anxiety on my previous visit, leaving me sweating and shaken and struggling for breath.
“I don’t have a death wish.”
“There goes a very attractive woman,” I remarked, my back still turned. I meant every word of it - and yet perhaps I might not have said it had I not been desperate to put any lingering awkwardness behind us.
Even as I uttered the words, I knew how ridiculous they sounded.
He had already removed my cravat and was reaching for the buttons of my shirt, stroking his fingers teasingly over the skin of my chest as he did so. Taking advantage of his languid state, I pushed him back into the cushions and opened his dressing gown, reaching for the fastening of his trousers. By the time I held his length in my hand, I had identified the ache that lay heavy in my chest, despite the growing ache in other areas that was beginning to distract me from everything but Holmes’ sure hands and his inviting mouth and the compact strength of his half-naked body. I ached because, despite how much I had fought it and no matter how assiduously I had fooled myself, I could no longer deny my true feelings. As I sank to my knees before him and watched the way his eyes slid closed as my mouth engulfed him, his long lashes casting shadows across his cheeks, I admitted to myself, at last, that I had failed. Despite my best efforts, I had fallen in love with my friend and companion. And not only would he never love me in return, I reminded myself, as his hands tightened in my hair, but I had a painful premonition that this would not be the last time that his passion for his work would cause him to leave me.
Holmes feathered the lightest of kisses on the back of my neck, perhaps anticipating the frosty reception that any more overt gesture would receive.
“There is nothing wrong with Percy, Holmes. He is simply possessed of natural human emotions. To have feelings may seem to you a womanly trait, but I can assure you that it is one that many people find admirable in a man.”
“You favour Wagner.” He was not asking.
“Perhaps I may after speaking with Phelps,” he replied. “We shall inform him of our movements yesterday and see what he has to say and before we determine our next move.”
“No. That’s not it," he said, suddenly angry. "I need – I want –. I am asking you to take me.”
“You brought me back to life,” I said. “We may live in a world that believes what we feel to be a perversion. I cannot help but believe otherwise, if only because the way I feel about you is the most profound thing that has ever happened to me. In my eyes it is the opposite of unsanctified. It borders on sacred. I would weather any danger rather than sacrifice it.”
Before Holmes walked into my life, I had never met anyone on earth capable of transforming my mood from a state of near-bliss to one of blistering irritation in a matter of two sentences.
“He is none of your concern,” Holmes replied, with all his damnable arrogance. “He is a problem that I'm taking care of and that I will be better equipped to handle once you are no longer living at Baker Street.”
“But why on earth would he attempt to break into your sick room?” I demanded. “It is preposterous. My dear fellow, are you quite sure that you were not dreaming?”
All his habitual coldness seemed to have turned suddenly to heat. In response, I felt my own need for him overwhelm me, burning away the walls I had so carefully constructed. He sat, still as a statue, watching me. When I lunged for him, unable to pretend any longer, I felt his lips curve into a smile of victory under my own. His shoulders were wiry and broader than they looked, taut and masculine in my grasping hands. His skin smelled like smoke and rain and his mouth had already opened to my coaxing tongue.
Holmes’ melodies lingered with me long after he put down his violin and made his way to bed and I would sometimes wake in the night to find them running through my mind. On one or two nights, I was so soothed by his music that I felt able to run the risk of attempting to sleep without the aid of a numbing agent. I longed to learn more about Holmes’ love of music but on this subject also I refrained from questioning him, ever careful to maintain the easy pattern into which we had fallen, which seemed to rely on respecting certain elements of each other’s privacy. We had found a way to live quite harmoniously in this way when I, in a moment of inexcusable pomposity, made a mistake that upset everything.
“Do you think that the police will apprehend him?”
Only when we had almost reached our destination did he inform me that I was not to confront Miss Adler with him but to wait outside as he sprung his trap. Standing outside the sitting room window, holding the plumber’s smoke-rocket he had handed me and waiting for his signal, I watched as Holmes, bleeding slightly from a blow sustained in the brawl I suspected him to have orchestrated, lay back on the sofa, and Miss Adler – now Mrs Norton – tended graciously to him.
“She is protecting her interests,” he said. “A woman like that, when she loves, will put love above all else.”
“What on earth is a consulting detective?" I retorted, stung to sharpness. “It does not sound a very useful profession. Do you mean that you work in some part-time capacity as a private investigator? Or perhaps you investigate people’s private affairs in the hope of discovering a scandal that will pay?”
Holmes was watching her with the predatory interest of a cat watching a mouse.
I was anxious for the sordid case to be finished and most curious to see the woman who had made such a strong impression on Holmes. I gladly agreed to accompany him to Miss Adler’s abode. To my surprise, he retreated to his bedroom and returned in the garb of a clergyman. I was not the first time I had seen him don a disguise and, as I had in the past, I found it in equal measures astonishing and disturbing. Holmes did not simply change his clothes, he seemed to change his entire being. He moved differently, he spoke differently. Even his face somehow conspired to look different, his features altered by expressions that I had never seen on the face of the real Holmes. Despite his lean figure and his striking features, Holmes had somehow adapted to his clergyman’s role in a way that made him seem completely sexless. Knowing him as I did, it was a profound shock to witness all his confidence and effortless grace vanish, replaced with a tentative, shambling walk and a slightly hunched posture that hid both his natural height and his innate poise. Only his eyes were unquenched, glimmering at me with veiled amusement as I gaped at him.
He turned to Holmes, lying as if insensible under his heap of rags, looking as haggard and withered as the addicts slowly poisoning themselves below.
“I thought you were dead!” I expostulated. “You disappear for two days, with no word, and then I find you drugged and disguised in an opium den. It would take a better man than me to weave an elaborate deception under those circumstances – and I still do not know for whom the deception to which I have found myself a party is being enacted.”
I waited out of sight, in the dank shadows near the entrance, for what felt like hours. The cold seemed to cut deeper with every moment and several times I began to think that if I did not move around I should freeze to death where I stood, but eventually I heard the jingle of a horse’s bridle and the quiet sound of wheels and then Wainwright came around the corner on foot, silhouetted against the single lamp that lit the entrance of the accused den. He disappeared inside, and I waited a few minutes and then followed him, as unobtrusively as possible. Ordering a pipe from the attendant, I sat in a shadowed corner, from where I had a clear view of Whitney, slumped over his own glowing bowl of sweet-smelling poison. I hoped that the lure of the drug had not overcome my instructions to partake only of the smallest amount, smoking just so much as was necessary to avoid arousing suspicion.
About those other vices he could never know, but I trusted to my ability to remain discreet, should I ever wish to indulge them again in the future. About my drinking I said nothing, and I did not share the reason for my frequent night-time disturbances, but the shrewd look he gave me from those piercing grey eyes led me to believe that he had perhaps guessed at some of what I left unsaid. I could only hope that it was the nightmares he had read in my face, and not the other aspects of my character that I felt it necessary to keep hidden.
“I am sorry,” he said quietly but with disarming honestly.
I do not now recall how I intended to continue my rambling speech, for at that moment Holmes kissed me with such force that all coherent thought flew from my mind and all I was aware of was the insistent press of his tongue, the soft curl of his hair under my fingers and the rich tobacco scent of him in my nostrils.
“Last night I did not know you were here!” I cried. “You saw me. When the fever takes me, I lose control of my mind, as well as my body. And it is not just the fever. Every night I dream – the most debilitating nightmares. I am haunted by the war. I cannot put it behind me, though it has been months. I never wished you to see me this way.”
“I am sure,” he said. A faint blush of pink had risen to his sallow cheeks. “You see, Watson, all is not quite as it should me between myself and my future brother-in-law.”
When at last I came to myself, exhausted and emaciated, I was a ghost of the blithe young Doctor Watson who had set out to Afghanistan, driven by thoughts of the men I would save. Instead, I was haunted by thoughts of the friends I had failed. The month’s journey to England on a troopship did little to improve my condition and by the time I landed at Portsmouth, not only was my physical health irretrievably ruined but I began to fear that I was to remain a ruined man forever. I have recorded for the public some few details of my first weeks in England and the featureless, anonymous hotel in the Strand where I began to while away my days and my money with meaningless distractions. What I omitted to record was the ways in which my time and money were spent, and I am ashamed even now to recall the card games and drinking and the women and men in whose bodies I found some temporary escape. Some I paid after a rare night of luck at the tables, though I had never thought to buy my lovers before the war. Others, I met at the docks or in one of several London alleyways I came to know rather too well. I was careful. I was, after all, still a doctor, although I might never practice as one again, and I had no desire to come by any unlooked for offspring, nor a missing nose.
“Are you so surprised?” he responded, and his voice had regained some of its usual cold precision. “You saw two nights ago what I was. You have surely known since then that this was inevitable.”
Sensing my mood, as he so often did, he placed one hand gently on the back of my neck, stroking long fingers through the soft hair that grew there.
He favoured me with one of his most feline and inscrutable smiles.
I heard a soft, familiar voice murmuring and felt something cool pressed to my brow.
An hour or more must have passed before he stirred again and began to pull himself up into a sitting position.
We had recently wrapped up a case for one of the most prominent politicians in the country and Holmes had been in high spirits, despite the fact that he had no new puzzle to solve, for the first time in several weeks. The night before, we had celebrated the end of the case by going to see a concert, where he had taken immense delight in the beautiful sound of a violin played with almost as much innate talent as he played his own. I had allowed myself to slide one hand onto his leg in the dark, a rare and risky expression of my unspoken feelings towards him, and we had ended the night with a very satisfying encounter in Holmes’ bedroom. I still bore the faint marks around my wrists from where he had restrained me for a very frustrating hour, teasing me as only he could, and the inordinately satisfying memory of how I had turned the tables on him when he finally freed me.
“No,” said Holmes, thoughtfully. “And yet I do not think she was entirely surprised. I believe that our minds work in similar ways. In my place, she might well have taken a comparable approach. Now that she has her chance to anticipate me, however, it is my turn to anticipate her.”
My voice was shaking. Even in that desperate moment, I hoped that he would think that the cause of my distress was anger, not the exquisitely painful sensation of my heart splintering into fragments, deadly shrapnel nestling inside my breast.
“I remember seeing Dr Shlessinger's wife come into the shop,” I said aloud at last, unable to bear the silence. “She had a set of earrings that matched the pendant. I had intended to follow her home and then return to Baker Street but she did not go home. She went to meet with an undertaker. I knew then that our time had very nearly run out. I followed her back to her house in Brixton and when she opened the door I rushed inside, determined that I would not leave without Lady Carfax. I had hoped that perhaps she was being held captive awaiting the culmination of their plans. When Shlessinger appeared, I kept him at bay with my revolver and told him I would not leave until I had searched every room. I remember him instructing his wife to call the police. And then nothing until I awoke in the coffin.”
“Well, Watson, do you have something to show me?”
The voice in the darkness, smooth and deep, could have belonged to no one but Sherlock Holmes. His innocent tone was belied by the heat of his breath ghosting over my member, which he had evidently succeeded in extracting from my nightwear with a delicacy of touch that had failed to awaken me. I was disoriented from my dream and already damp and throbbing from his attentions. In the faint glow of lamplight that leaked into the room, I could just make out the devastating angle of his cheekbones and the glint of his eyes. A moment later, he was in my arms and I was kissing him as though we had been apart for months, rather than a matter of days. Still only half sure that I wasn’t dreaming, I pulled away and addressed him with unusual frankness.
I attempted to remonstrate with him, repeating for the third time that I feared I had been mistaken, but he would not be moved. Within a few minutes, he had forced Holmes, staggering and exhausted, to his feet, placed handcuffs around his thin wrists and led him from the building. They soon departed for the station and I was left, shocked and confused, outside the drug den, alone. The knowledge that Holmes was alive warred in my breast with worry and guilt at my own actions, which had inadvertently led to his arrest. I stood for long minutes wondering what to do. Were I to call upon the help of Lestrade, or any other inspector of our acquaintance who might be able to alley the suspicions of Wainwright, I would destroy Holmes’ disguise, and I still did not know for what reason he had adopted it or from whom he intended to hide. In the end, I could see no other path but to return to Baker Street and await the morning, when I could visit Holmes in his cell on some pretext and attempt to speak to him privately.
Wainwright sniffed disbelievingly but did not contradict the man.
“Why?”
“If he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense, I am the very man for him,” I found myself saying eagerly, as soon as Stamford mentioned his acquaintance. “I should prefer having a partner to being alone.”
“It’s nothing,” I said, placing the letter back on the desk.
I confess I was at a loss as to how he had known about my lack of employment, but I supposed that given my need of shared lodgings it was not too difficult a conclusion to draw. I found myself reluctant to answer him, nonetheless. The truth was that I did not believe I would ever be in a frame of mind to practice medicine again, but I little wished to reveal so much of myself to the man beside me – at least not on such early acquaintance.
At that fraught instance, there came a knock at the door. Into the room strode a lady of medium height, with fine blond hair, an upright bearing and startling blue eyes. There was something about her face that gave a suggestion of great kindness and of innate strength. She was not classically beautiful, but I found her immediately appealing – she was exactly the kind of woman I had always pictured myself one day choosing to marry, in the days before the war, when I believed that my future held a comfortable medical practice, a partner who shared my interests and a clutch of children.
“Jealousy is a strange thing. Human beings, I believe, are the only creatures that often act contrary to their own interests. Harrison could not have what he wanted and so he chose to destroy not only his sister and his lover but himself into the bargain. It was a timely reminder to reign in my own suspicions regarding Phelps’ designs on a certain doctor, retired soldier and former lover.”
“It is the wrong photograph!” I exclaimed.
Sherlock stops. He’s missed something. Something important. Honestly, why do none of their clients ever explain anything properly?
“It is not the same thing,” he said. “The circumstances of your injury were – ”
A familiar feeling of excitement mixed with dismay rolled through me as I realised that once again Holmes had seen far more in the matter than he had chosen to reveal to me. I could not understand why he had not spoken to me of Phelps’ telegram, nor why he had chosen to respond by wire, rather than confiding in me. Little wishing Phelps to read my misgivings in my face, lest he determine the cause, I affected nonchalance as I drew back and turned to ring the bell.
“Not a better man,” he murmured. “Only a more calculating one. I am sorry that I did not send word.”
“My dear Watson,” came the calm response, “I knew that your interest in me was based on some assumptions you had made about my character that were entirely inaccurate. Forgive me if I did not wish to put at risk the comfortable arrangement we have fallen into for the sake of a short-lived affair.”
“I fell deeply in love with Annie but I had yet to gather up the courage to ask her if she would consent to pledge her life to me. One night, Joseph came to meet me, as he often did, and we went to my club, where we ate dinner and shared a bottle of wine. Anticipating his joyful congratulations, I told him of my intentions towards his sister. To my surprise, he turned quite pale. He seemed deeply shocked and left soon afterwards without offering me any words of advice or congratulation. That weekend, he had arranged to come down to Woking. Annie was to join us on Sunday for the day. I had determined to speak with her then. On Friday, to my relief, Joseph met me at my office as usual and we took the 9 o’clock train. We did not speak of our last meeting. At home, we opened a bottle of brandy and sat in front of the fire and began to speak idly of this and that. I was reassured to find that his humour had returned and he seemed quite himself again. Several times he topped up our glasses and eventually, after several pleasant hours, I took myself off to bed, somewhat unsteady on my feet. I awoke to find him kissing me.”
I turned away in confusion and at last took note of the blond man, who was standing at my elbow, asking with increasing irritation what the problem was.
He trailed off as Holmes turned sharply away, walked across the room and shut the door in the faces of the small crowd in the hallway.
I felt the curve of his smile against my neck.
As the weeks dragged on, these dalliances grew fewer and I spent increasing amounts of time alone, drowning my sorrows in the whisky bottle. I avoided mirrors assiduously, unable to meet the eyes of the man who stared back at me, a wasted shell of a person, scarred and broken, who I often found myself unable to recognise. Such was the state of affairs when I realised to my horror that my free spending had left me in a desperate position and that new lodgings must be sought without delay, were I to continue to afford numbing escape from the nightly terror of my dreams and to remain amid the stink and bustle of London. An enforced stay in the quiet of the countryside, I feared, might very well be the death of me.
“Of course I thought about it!”
“Watson, do not tell me that you are jealous,” he said, and the amusement in his voice cut me more deeply than anger would have.
“When you’ve eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth,” John says, as though reciting something.
“Your presence might be invaluable,” he admitted.
I felt a wild urge to laugh rise up inside me and had to bite the inside of my cheek quite hard to quell it.
“Why should I confide in a man who is keeping secrets even when he is inside me?” I cried, stung to the point of crudity. “What of the case that has so distracted you these last few weeks that you sent me off to Switzerland to trace Lady Carfax without you? Maybe if you had seen fit to include me, instead of keeping me in the dark, we could have worked together on this case, instead of alone. Perhaps then she would still be alive.”
“Your caution is admirable, but there was no need to worry on that score, as it happens,” he said, with a strange half-laugh. “It seems that my disguise was useless from the first.”
“You are always a distraction,” he said. “It is just that often the benefits of your presence outweigh the negatives.”
When he was at home, I found him easy enough to live with. He was a quiet companion and most often to be found absorbed in reading and smoking his pipe on the sofa, often with his feet up and his limbs all akimbo. His habitual air of relaxation was belied by the keen intelligence of his eyes and the quick flickers of reaction that passed across his angular features as he read from newspapers, periodicals and documents that he kept stored in several boxes stacked under a desk he had moved to beneath one of two large windows. I noticed that many of these documents were hand-written and I found my curiosity aroused, for, although I did not share Young Stamford’s seeming wariness of Holmes or disapprove of his habits, I had noticed that he seemed to have few friends – as few, almost, as myself. He had no regular callers, as far as I knew. Once every few days, however, he would ask me to vacate the sitting room so that he could meet with a client in need of his mysterious skills. Though I studied each one these visitors as carefully as I could in the moments before retreating to my own quarters or departing our lodgings to pace the streets or take refuge in a nearby bar, I could find nothing among them that explained what service Holmes was providing. On the contrary, they were a strange assortment of people from all classes of society. Wealthy gentlemen and finely dressed ladies stopped by as often as seedy looking peddlers and poorly dressed maids.
“Did you tell anyone that you had this special task to perform?”
“No. Not like that. You said…”
“What is it that you do?” I asked him, breaking the silence that had fallen between us.
“You woke me for another round,” I said.
“Snakes are venomous. They inject venom via a bite. Poison is ingested.”
Within a few minutes, Phelps had elicited a promise from his fiancée and we had made our way into the sunlight grounds. He walked slowly but steadily, leaning on my arm, and it was some minutes before we reached a small corpse of trees within sight of the house, where he sank onto an ornate, wrought iron loveseat and gestured me to sit beside him. The birds were singing in the trees above us and the smell of cut grass saturated the cool spring air, whispering that summer was on its way. A sudden feeling of optimism swept through me, but when he turned to me it died away, as swiftly as it had come. His face was haggard and he looked almost haunted. Without thinking twice, I reached for his hand. His fingers were cold and surprisingly delicate in mine, more like those of a woman than a man. Then I realised that I had grown use to the feel of Holmes hands, with their long, scarred fingers and strong square palms, and another rush of regret went through me at the way I had left him. I drew my own hand back and placed it on my knee.
“You don’t seem very surprised,” Sherlock murmurs after a moment, running his fingers down the knobs of John’s spine.
At Baden, I learned that Lady Carfax had become entangled with a couple of religious zealots, a Dr Shlessinger and his wife, and began to feel that perhaps I was making progress. I learned, with relief, that the entire party had departed for London some three weeks earlier, at last giving me reason to return to Baker Street and continue the investigation from there. When, on my arrival in Montpellier for what I hoped would be the final portion of my Continental investigation, I received a telegram from Holmes requesting a description of Dr Shlessinger’s left ear, I was equal parts exasperated and amused. The following morning, I set out to interview Lady Carfax’s former maid in good spirits, and retired that night anticipating a return to Baker Street the next day. I fell asleep fantasising about the many ways in which I might wordlessly communicate to Holmes how much I had missed him.
“Why did you not warn me?”
“You do not have the authority to decide what is best for me,” I heard myself say, almost as though it were someone else speaking. “I don’t stay because I need you, I stay because I am so in love with you that I cannot imagine living without you… but you already knew that.”
Sherlock sighs as dramatically as he can.
“I'm fine,” I said reassuringly. I didn't know who I was addressing. The words came out muffled and slurred. There was an awful dry bitterness in my mouth and my tongue seemed heavy and unwieldy, too large for my mouth.
“Good night,” John murmurs, and Sherlock grunts and wraps one long arm around John’s chest, nestling his hand under John’s chin.
