Tony didn’t understand anything. Maybe he clicked and shared something by accident. There was a slight possibility that his account was hacked. Maybe -
Steve watched in the reflection, as Red Velvet combed her hair to the back as much as possible and then used bobby pins to keep some strands in place. Then she took out a black, small net and stretched it, pulling it over her head.
Steve turned his head and whispered into Tony’s ear, lips brushing over the shell. “I am guessing you didn’t leave me any pizza?”
"Calm down, we have plenty of time!" Kamala said, taking the tray and putting it aside. "If you want to get it done, help me too," she said, pushing a cupcake holder box in his hands to fold.
Steve smiled back and pecked his boyfriend's lips briefly. "You know that this is not all that I planned for us, right?"
“Before we continue, I have to tell you something,” Steve said with a grimace, well aware that if he kept talking, there might be no continuation at all. Wonder if Loki had a persona non grata list and if Steve’s name would make it there. He needed to come clean. “I am not a journalist,” he admitted in one breath, keeping his hold on Red Velvet’s waist. “I lied because I really wanted to meet you. I think you are just amazing, and I was always to shy to talk to you, so when I saw you that night outside… It was then or never.”
Steve gave a fake laugh, feeling hot under his collar. He should have forked out some cash for a dictaphone, but honestly, it slipped his mind. Who would have thought that being a fake journalist was such a tough job?
“Don’t be mad,” Tony said, not sounding apologetic at all. He stepped into the kitchen, bringing the stinging scent of cigarettes with him. “Besides, such a great morning required a smoke. I am glad I am not performing today, I don’t think I can walk on heels,” he tried to joke and kiss Steve on the neck, but was stopped by blond’s stern look.
"Good, thanks," Steve smiled back, breathing in the scent of fresh pastries. Yesterday was a great night. It still felt a little unreal to him, having a fiancé, but seeing the engagement ring on Tony's finger while he had leaned down to kiss his sleeping queen and went out to get some fresh bread for breakfast was a very real reminder. "Do you have any brioches today? I want to make French toasts for Tony's breakfast."
Tony whistled, but obediently walked to the bathroom. “You know, if I was wearing a dress, you wouldn’t use that tone towards me!” he yelled, reminding Steve of their first meeting outside the club. Steve was too stunned back then and it was no opening line to call someone out on smoking, but after almost a month of dating, he felt he earned the right.
Tony didn’t realize he started to hyperventilate until Pepper’s voice brought him back. Everyone was staring at him and Tony felt like vomiting.
Natasha nodded, grabbing trotting by Arrow, male name Clint, as Steve learned with time, by the arm and twirled with her. "Ah ah ah! Where do you think you are going? You and your hairy pits are next."
“No, Steve, I - ” Tony walked into the bedroom, trying to make his voice strong. Just remember what he had planned and it would be fine. “I want to talk first, okay?"
Steve wasn’t exactly sure for what. For something secretive. Something he wanted to hide. Things he didn’t admit even to Steve.
"I wouldn't have it any other way," Tony kept smiling, putting his arm around Steve's shoulders, Steve drawing his husband close and holding him by the hip. Pressed together, gently swaying to the music, they celebrated Valentine's day just as they liked - intimately and close.
Steve's face exploded with a new shade of embarrassment. He pushed himself and Red inside the room hurriedly and slammed the door behind. Seemed that she just loved making him flustered. "Maybe not now," Steve muttered, feeling that everyone in the club was already observing him.
Just because was a good enough reason for Steve. He stopped, and turned to face Tony, and leaned into a kiss. Sweet and long. And this time, Tony didn't even wince, just ran with the affection, right in the middle of the sidewalk, not covering from curious eyes around them.
“Can’t help it,” Steve answered miserably, looking longingly at his wristwatch. Still, ten minutes remained. Why couldn’t time go faster?
“Thanks,” Steve took it in both hands and slowly sipped. It was working and soon he felt warmth spreading over his limbs and helping him think. He looked at Tony, who was actively avoiding his gaze and sat on the edge of the bed, near him, waiting.
Figaro's ears twitched and he swooped his tail, Peter's bright eyes immediately following the movement and finding it amusing, chubby fingers trying to reach and touch the tail. Figaro didn't allow that, and walked a semi-circle around Peter's head and curled in the corner of the crib, forming a fluffy donut and closed his eyes. Peter babbled some more, turning on his tummy to better see Figaro. Somehow, the presence of the purring cat soothed him, and soon, Peter leaned his head down and closed eyes to sleep.
"You know I will step on your feet, right?" Steve asked teasingly, accepting the hand, and stood up.
Steve smiled, sensing the honesty in Tony’s voice. “And I like how you look now,” he booped Tony on the nose playfully, meaning the tiny bathrobe and nothing else underneath. Steve’s outfit was even skimpier as it consisted only of a towel around his hips.
“Hi! I am Tony,” he said in a pleasant voice, waving his hand, “you must be Steve’s mom. Your son looks very similar to you, Mrs. Rogers.”
"Alright," Steve agreed, lying back in bed and pulling the covers to himself. "Just watch Tony for me, okay?"
"Hop!" Steve jumped out of the way, just when Peter got too close, sending his boy stumbling forward. He didn't let him go far, and grabbed by his arm, turning around and sending crashing into him.
alright, so we are moving forward! promise next chapter will be sooner. hope you will like this chapter, if you do, remember to leave kudos and comments :D!
Red Velvet seemed speechless, while the crowd laughed at the playful remark. Steve had to bump his shoulder with Red's, trying to break her out of the trance, and put the mic to her lips, urging her to speak.
Tony dug his heels into the floor, stopping them both. "I can't!" he yelled, his voice already trembling. He can't. No one can know.
“And we never discussed it, you know? We keep seeing each other, but I don’t know what it makes us—”
"Hey Fig," Steve smiled, making room for Figaro, who tried to get to Steve's lap. Steve picked him up and lifted high in the air, looking at him. "So, you're an Avenger now, huh?" he asked, smiling at the new collar the cat had, blue, with a white print of '
Tony looked shyly at Steve, almost as if asking what happened and if it was all okay, and Steve pulled Tony more to himself and squeezed his shoulder, hoping to give his boyfriend some reassurance and smiled encouragingly. For him, everything went fine and he had a very promising feeling about this evening.
“It is okay, I like you,” he smiled. “Do you want to have a nickname? That will make it much easier for me to write when you are involved.”
“Huh…” Steve mused out, bits of information falling into one picture. They never discussed it, but in the back of his head, Steve had this thought that Tony enjoyed being tickled, or at least didn’t mind terribly. The way he squirmed between Steve’s tickling hands but didn’t try to run away. How he laughed and screamed for mercy whenever Steve targeted a sensitive spot and always seemed a bit disappointed when the tickling ended but masked it with a smile and complaints of being assaulted. Sometimes, Steve just felt provoked into tickling his boyfriend, like that one time, Tony had taken his sketchbook and hid away, refusing to say where he hid it and Steve had to tickle the information out of him until Tony was absolutely incoherent from laughter and breathless.
"Cack attack means being nervous. You know I am half Irish, right?" Steve said in a light tone, taking his shoes off while trying not to jostle the bag with pastries.
"My nights were so cold without you," Steve admitted to the belly, and Tony rolled his eyes playfully, knowing that Steve meant the evenings when Steve liked to lie sideways in bed and use his stomach as his special pillow. Truth to be told, Tony enjoyed those moments too. It was comforting and Tony was ready for that routine to resume. "Are you still in good shape?"
“Okay,” Steve agreed, turning his eyes to many pairs of shoes and dresses, of course, red. Then, in the corner on a mannequin, he noticed something that made him blush from head to toes. It was a breastplate. Silicone, milky in color with raspberry red nipples. Red Velvet’s bosom. He would probably remain stunned if it wasn’t a buzzing sound of an electric shaver that made him peek out from the closet.
“Of course that I am not breaking up with you,” Steve said suddenly, and Tony winced, not realizing he said it out loud. “Is that what you thought?” Steve asked, sounding shocked. Reluctantly, Tony nodded. Somehow he was used to being rejected and walking away from problems was one of the things he did and expected the same happen to him.
"I am kinda full, but - oh," Tony grinned, understanding the hidden meaning behind the words. "Aren't you a smart cookie," Tony cooed, flicking Steve under his chin softly, "I would love to, but I have to go to work."
"What you just said. It sounded great. Like song material. You should write it down and use it as lyrics to your next song."
"Just Thor will be enough. I wish you a nice evening, ma'am," Thor smiled gallantly and went to resume his position in front of the club.
if you read the previous chapter and it seemed a bit odd, it might be because I made a formatting mistake and like half of the chapter got cut off, please go back and read again. sorry for that!
The temporary comfortable feeling was gone again and Sarah felt out of place once more. She had an open mind and was willing to accept many things, but didn't like to be lead astray. She was a patient woman, but enough was enough. Sarah opened her bag and reached for the phone when she noticed a familiar face near the bar and a smile immediately jumped on her lips. "Sam!" she called, waving to Steve's friend.
Tony had been working a lot, slept a little and finally, it had to gain on him. He just hoped he won't get a bruise on his forehead because that wouldn't be an attractive look for the annual Avengers and friends Christmas party. Festive food, gleaming decorations, and the biggest Christmas tree they could fit into the Avengers conference room. Tony was looking forward to those few days of comfort.
the very first chapter! if you would like to read more of this fic, let me know, as this is still a work in progress. will have some references to Ru Paul’s Drag Race and the beginning is based on my very first contact with drag culture, which was a scene in Friends.
Something new awakened in Steve. That was yet another face of Tony, one Steve didn't have an occasion to see.
Steve huffed. On most of the days, he was used to Tony's loudness. Heck, on most of the days, he found it extremely appealing, enticing even as Tony was wonderfully responsive to every touch and it was very rewarding. Just there was something about today that ticked Steve off, and he was not able to name it, but he would appreciate if Tony could... tone it down a bit.
“Sure. I would love to,” Steve said softly and they began walking to the parking lot, chatting excitedly. It was surprising how easy everything was going for them, and Steve loved how open Tony could be about everything. It was a nice change in his life.
"Come on, I will clean you up," Red Velvet said, taking Steve's hand and guiding him to the vanity station. She sat Steve down and took a fresh cotton pad, pouring the same liquid she had used earlier on the pad, and gently rubbing Steve's face all over with it. Steve closed his eyes and enjoyed the touch. He was getting used to all those cosmetic stuff.
Steve didn't know a lot about love. He never really experienced it, rejected by most of the girls back in the times before he got the serum, while his time with Peggy, the girl he truly felt close to, was cut short and the blossoming feeling never developed. After waking up in the 21st century, Steve didn't expect to ever fit in, not even mentioning finding love, but a miracle happened and he and Tony found each other. That, that Steve could call love. That warm, soothing feeling whenever he looked at Tony, was close to him, and listened to his voice. Their love was growing and filling his heart and soul with something he never experienced before. Steve wouldn't call himself an expert on love, but he knew that what he was feeling towards Tony, that was true love. Pure and passionate and everlasting.
Tony's vision got black for a second when a painful and strong punch was aimed at his stomach. He doubled over, and Tiberius stepped away, letting Tony fall on his knees and into the mud, clutching his stomach.
Tony never had his coming out story, never finding the right time for such talk and then being robbed of that opportunity by a car accident that took both of his parents away. Sometimes he thought about how his coming out story would look like. In the worst-case scenario, his mom had burst into tears, wondering what did she do wrong, his dad exploding with rage and yelling that his only son can’t be gay and it all ended with disowning and forcing him to leave his family house. The best-case scenario wasn’t any better, as there his mom still ended disappointed and heartbroken, but calm enough to keep her raging husband away from him, and managing to find a safe place for Tony, somewhere where he could keep low until his father calmed down.
"Yes, Friday?" Steve asked, luckily not smelling any more smoke, but having a feeling that he might not like what he would hear next.
"Hi!" Tony replied cheerfully, trying to be hearable among the crowd. "Sorry I was staring! I really like your blush!"
"Tell the director what happened! Steve won't say a thing, I know he won't, and Stone would just slide his way out of this one-"
Steve listened, convinced in his belief that something along Tony’s life did go very wrong, seeing how deeply he was wounded and how well he had masked his scars. They would work on that and maybe one day, Tony won’t have to hide behind a mask of lipstick and foundation any longer.
It was late evening when Tony had just finished putting the leftover veggies into the fridge and straightened up, stretching his spine out. He could call the drag queens meeting a success, but he also felt so tired. He smiled when he saw a torn out page from the fashion magazine stuck to his fridge with a magnet, a ruby red maxi dress with an open back presented on a model and Arrow's print next to it.
"Whaaat?!" a young girl with a head full of black curls showed up, holding a notepad and looking irritated. "You told me to do a stocktaking! Do you know how many types of tires we have here?!"
“Bye, ma,” Steve said quietly, feeling like hiding into the floor. When his mom mingled with the crowd, Tony slid his arm under Steve’s and urged him to walk.
“Baloney!” Tony gruffed out suddenly, and Steve’s shoulders jumped at the harsh tone. “Sorry,” Tony giggled, back to his own voice, “that’s what she used to yell at me whenever I was trying to be smarter than her.”
"He never had any complaints," Tony said in a rush, taking Steve by the arm and turning in the direction of the door, hurriedly opening them. "Go, go, go! I don't have much time!" Tony urged, forcing Steve to stumble into the changing room after him.
“If you want to,” Steve said truthfully, “or maybe you can keep it for a bit longer because I might need some inspiration on how to take you apart.”
"Nothing, it's nothing - " Steve tried to brush it off, but another sneeze happened. And then another one. And then he felt his throat becoming tight and eyes water and all of this was oddly familiar and disturbing.
Steve looked at the man, recognizing the voice from the intercom. It was a tall male, pale and with dark hair slicked to the back. He was wearing a dark suit, just like the blond bouncer in front of the club and eyed Steve with a hostile look.
"THE HELL ARE YA DOIN'?!" Steve suddenly sprung up, waving his arms wildly and Tony had to duck to avoid a hit. Okay, maybe it wasn't the right time. Steve clearly was deep in the game mode, and no matter how hard Tony tried, he couldn't reach half of the level of enthusiasm Steve was showing. He decided to occupy himself in a different way and scanned the crowd. He didn't have to look far, as the person on his left attracted his attention. It was a girl, looking as bored as Tony felt, sitting next to a guy around her age with silver hair (kids those days) and a dark goatee, who just like Steve was yelling at the poor players. But what really attracted Tony attention was the red blush on girl's cheek. It was matt finish, with some reddish brown tint to it. It would look perfect on him. The girl noticed him staring and turned in his direction, smiling insecurely.
"Huh? Why?" Red asked, genuinely surprised. She thought Steve was enjoying himself. "Are you still worried we will put you in drag? Don't worry, we won't-"
Just he would love more to be in bed with Tony, than alone on the couch. The anger in him was slowly fading away, a feeling of emptiness and longing taking its place. The thing they argued about didn't seem important anymore, and the only thing that mattered was that he really, really missed Tony, even if he knew that his boyfriend was just a room away, probably already sleeping, curled under the covers. He squeezed one of the decorative pillows closer, one that was carefully selected by Tony to match the couch and the living room, wishing that he was holding his boyfriend in his arms instead. Steve felt like a piece of him was missing. It was an unpleasant, cold feeling, twisting his stomach and not letting him rest.
"Okay, stop, stop," Tony giggled, batting on Steve's hands when the touch turned more ticklish than soothing. He turned around and wrapped hands around his boyfriend's neck, standing on his toes and smiling.
He was stuck between two crying people, absolutely not knowing what to do. What was worse, those were the last two people he wanted to see upset.
"Go ahead," Tony invited, smiling back. Steve intended to, but… The evil grin disappeared and was replaced by a more and more confused look as he was examining Tony's face. Eyebrows in a neat shape, no strand hairs. Smooth cheeks, the goatee trimmed to a perfect length. In a desperate, completely dirty move, Steve even looked for nose hair, but those were also properly taken care of.
"Oh, I want to hear all the details," Steve leaned in with a cheerful smile. "But maybe later, I have to get back to Tony, but first I want to know - why Parfait?"
"I didn't think it was necessary," Tony said calmly, gently lowering the wig back into the soapy water. His lips quirked into a small, mischievous smile he tried to hide and Steve narrowed his eyes angrily - of course, Tony was pleased with frightening him.
"I am glad they are not coming with us," Steve said in a grim voice, taking the towel off and twisting it.
"Good, good," Sam smiled, taking a seat next to her and Sarah kept smiling, hearing that that deeply hidden tensed note that had always been in Sam's voice whenever he talked about his work was gone. Just like if something got unblocked in him. "Mrs. Rogers, what are you doing here?" Sam asked, not understanding.
Tony laughed wetly and almost hysterically. They all were. It just seemed like one of those nights that crying happened for very little reason.
“In the interview,” Tony smiled again, and Steve felt like something slapped him in the face. Right! He got so busy with looking and admiring, he completely forgot about the fake part of the meeting.
It was quiet around them and Steve saw people in the distance, attending the graves and visiting people buried in them, not paying attention to each other. In all its eery setting, the cemetery grounds were quite beautiful, with all the paths and wide, old trees.
"Really," Steve nodded, feeling Tony's heat and getting weak in the knees. It was unfair how gorgeous Tony could look in any circumstances. He leaned down to a kiss and-
“Oh,” Steve mumbled out feeling foolish, “I am sorry. But if you knew, why did you let me come here with me?”
"Oh man," Steve's voice dropped and he rubbed the back of his neck, feeling bad. Seemed that because of him, none of his friends got any decent rest, while he and Tony cuddled for the whole night, feeling blissful and in love. "Sorry."
"Always," Steve grinned and took a piece, popping it into his mouth. Crumbly, buttery, and sweet. With some floral note to it.
"Are you asking because you want me to…?" Steve didn't finish. Her smile was enough to confirm that thought. In less than a second, Steve was off the chair. "Oh no, no, no," he said quickly, walking backward and seemingly terrified. "No way. I am not wearing drag."
"Do you want me to kiss your elbow better?" Steve asked, looking at his husband who started to resemble a puffed-out, angry cat. Adorable. "In all honesty, babe, Peter warned us that that movie had bad reviews."
“Will you calm down?” Sam hissed, sitting at the other end of the table. The grip Steve had on an empty glass of Long Island Ice Tea was alarmingly tight and Sam began to worry that some accident involving shredded glass and blood might happen soon.
Steve laughed to himself, watching pleased looking Sam handing a hungry Bucky another roll, his friend biting right into the soft, baked goodness. Bucky wouldn't be Bucky if he didn't add something, and he kept muttering more things that had layers between the bites, including ogres and, for some unknown reason, witchers. They chatted for a bit longer and when first customers started to line up, Steve took his bag with bread and headed home, back to his fiancé, his steps as light as air.
Uh oh. Seemed that he wasn't as good at masking his laughter as he thought he was. Steve sighed, and sat up on the bed, invitingly patting the covers. "Hey, Fig! Figaro! Come here!" he tried to get his and Tony's cat's attention but without any results. Figures, Figaro was their cat, but he bonded strongly with Tony. Steve was more of a food dispenser, litter cleaner, and occasional heater. He had no authority when it came to Figaro and his moods. "Figgy, daddy will be out soon! Tony, tell him you will be out soon!"
Steve blinked, thinking back into their conversation what Tony meant before it dawned on him. He didn't answer. And times changed and the truth shouldn't be shocking. There would be always people who would have a problem, but it shouldn't stop anyone from living and being happy.
Backing down was not an option anymore. Peter was sure that neither Ned nor MJ would let him forget about this anyway, so at least he could go down with style. With a loud roar, he ran at his pops.
"See, this happens when you smoke. Your lung capacity shrinks and this why you are already out of breath."
," Figaro just gazed down on his human, stretched out in all his enormous length. Steve smiled wider and cuddled the cat close, and went back to watching TV, planning to bake a chocolate fudge cake for Tony later on.
"You were complaining about your job a lot lately," Red Velvet hummed, coming closer to him, hips swaying with every step and high heels clinking on the floor. Steve furrowed his eyebrows in thought. Well, maybe. To be honest, he was pleased with his job, finding it quite easy and manageable. Just customers were sometimes a pain in the ass, but all jobs had ups and downs. "I am sure you have a lot of more options, we can brainstorm later and find something suitable for you," Red said in a comforting manner and Steve buried his face in the material on Red's stomach and she ran her long fingernails through his hair delicately, scratching his scalp. Such simple touch and he was already melting out of pleasure.
“Did you like my new song?” Tony asked as he locked his arms together with Steve’s. “Wrote it for you,” he added in a flirting tone, batting his eyelashes, which still were long, even without the fake ones attached.
What was stopping him? This time the feeling of moist, red lips against his was replaced with cold, pale hands with long fingers, and the imaginary pain of snapping his arm in two.
"Hm?" Tony looked up, hearing the door creak open, and watching a fluffy bullet running towards him, "what the - ow, ow, Fig!" he protested when thirty pounds of a cat jumped into his hands, clawing at his bare thighs. "STEVE!"
"Hey, ma," Steve said, taking a piece of the tender beef and mushroom on his fork and into his mouth. "You look different."
"Just look at you," Sarah drew back a bit, running gently her palms over Tony's cheeks. "I thought Stevie was exaggerating when he told me that you were having a complete cack attack."
“Okay!” Steve jumped off the sofa and trotted to the closet to get the box, careful to not knock anything over. He tapped his knuckles against the wooden door and it opened slightly.
Tony chuckled, looking at the design. He would never walk out on the stage in a dress that showed his ass crack. Showing to Steve like that in the privacy of his home, was a totally different story… He took the page with himself and went to the bedroom, thinking that maybe he would try some new facial mask and take an extra long bath. He just finished changing into his tiny bathrobe, when he noticed his phone vibrating on the nightstand and Steve's photo flashing on the screen. Tony accepted the call, already smiling to the thought that Steve was so sweet and called him just to wish him a good night.
Minutes passed, and when Steve felt ready to leave, he heard a round of applause. That had to mean that Velvet already went on the stage and was greeted by her usual crowd.
By Tony's smile, twitching and spreading and the happy sparkle in his eyes, Steve could say that Tony felt the same, pleased that his Valentine's surprise worked out so well. Every day, their bedroom presented quite simple, with crumpled sheets, lone clothes here and there, organized in a modern, minimalistic style and with few heartwarming accents like their wedding photo on the nightstand, or more humoristic ones, meaning the tie with a ducky pattern, looped over the wardrobe handle. This was like cupid decided to drop by, got drunk on Tony's scotch, and vomited everywhere.
"What?" Steve asked, opening his eyes and looking at Red Velvet smiling hopefully at him. "Me and you? On the stage?"
"Oh my gosh..." Tony shivered, curling closer to Steve's body, when a warm finger started to play between his butt cheeks, testing and finding his opening, circling it. "Hah... HAH!"
“That’s my room,” Velvet said, stopping in front of the door with a golden star in the upper part, with a ’Red Velvet’ written in a curly font. She reached into her pocket for the key.
It wasn’t a long ride, and it was quite pleasant, with the road being almost empty and the distance seemed shorter to Steve. Tony’s apartment was in one of those new building, and it was in pristine condition, and everything was sparkling clean and neatly organized and had more of a hotel vibe than a home feeling to it. Tony handed Steve some clean towels and a toothbrush, and even lend him a shirt and pants to sleep in. They both were tired after a long week and soon collapsed on Tony’s king-sized bed, sharing a goodnight kiss and nothing more, not having strength.
Tony laughed. "Yeah, sorry. I will get cleaned right away, there actually is a bathroom with a shower behind my office, so-"
“Huh,” was all Tony could say looking at Agent Coulson. In a dark suit, as always, smiling coyly at him. It was that smile that threw Tony off his balance.
“Sorry if this isn’t what you expected,” Tony turned to him, when Beth was gone, losing the battle over if Tony should or should not eat, and Steve blinked in confusion. Expecting what? The mouthwatering sandwich or the mouthwatering man in front of him?
After the question, Steve looked at his boyfriend. At his unruly hair and dirty face and did Tony always had such muscled forearms and overall had a very nicely muscled body?
"Yeah - eep," Tony made a high pitched sound, feeling fingers walking down his heel. Across the sole, and Tony had to bite a laugh down, and then fingers hooked around his ankle, dragging him on the bed. "Ah, Latrice, sorry, I gotta go, fiancé fever, you know how it is, stay fabulous, love you girl, byeeee!" Tony squeezed many words into the short moment, in which Steve pulled him close, surprising Tony with a long kiss.
“God, Tony,” Steve rubbed his face again. “I just panicked, okay? It doesn’t have to do anything with you being who you are.”
Couches were the worst. The couch in his and Tony's living room was the worst. Steve felt like setting it on fire.
“Oh, interesting!” Steve suddenly said, ending the kiss too soon and looking at one of the comments, smiling wickedly.
Steve bit his lip, legs bouncing impatiently on the bed. He tried to keep his mind occupied, but the twisting feeling in his lower stomach didn't allow him to.
Steve usually didn't need a lot of sleep. Five, six hours of rest were pretty standard for him and plenty to let him function through the whole day. Maybe it was that yesterday, he and Tony had decided to stay late at the Pitted Olive, prolonging their stay to see Tootsie's rock performance and Arrow's new juggling routine and he indulged more in the Long Island Ice tea than his body was used to, that the next morning it was exceptionally hard to get up from bed. He just wished to stay in, wrapped in warm covers and softness, and let his body decide when it wanted to wake up, instead of his always disciplined mind telling him that it was way past his usual sleep hours. He heard Tony woke up some time ago, but his boyfriend remained tactful and quiet and didn't want to disturb the blond, and moved swiftly and unnoticeable. Steve had moments of wakening up and nodding off, always feeling Tony's presence somewhere close, without being able to pinpoint exactly where he was, but it was enough to keep him calm and deep in sleep.
Tony groaned, looking away, some blush spreading over his cheeks. "You are doing it again," he tried to complain, but there was some weak note in his voice, something that told Steve that he didn't completely mind what was happening. And Tony blushing during sunset was a very pretty sight.
Steve smiled softly, watching his boyfriend curling into him, as they kept strolling down the street, closer and closer to his mom's place. On their way, they had already picked the earlier ordered pastries from Sam's bakery, including Tony's favorite eclairs with a chocolate glaze and a custard filling, and a bouquet of wildflowers, Tony insisted on getting for Sarah. It wouldn't feel right to come empty-handed for such an important meeting.
Tony just broke. He hid his face into Steve’s neck and started sobbing in relief. Steve wouldn’t become one of the coming out stories that ended without a happy ending. It was all he wished for.
“Yeah, but times change,” Steve shrugged, hooking their arms together and walking with Tony to the food court, his steps lighter than ever. “And I hate raw fish.”
It was good neither for sitting, not having proper support for arms, neither for laying down comfortably on the narrow, often too short space. And don't get him even started on the pillows, which were solely for decorative purposes and not fit to use.
The conversation continued, and there was some scolding and deflecting the reasonable arguments, but Steve spaced out again. Tony. Tony and Red Velvet. Red Velvet was tall, had long dark hair, and milky white skin and icy blue eyes. Tony was more or less Steve’s height, had short brown hair, tanned skin, and warm, brown eyes.
Steve was sitting with opened, alert eyes. He was trying to calm down his pounding heart and pull himself together, but his body didn’t listen. As sad as it sounded, Steve was slowly getting used to living in stress. It didn’t mean, that he was any better at controlling and dealing with it.
Sarah didn't say anything. She frowned deeper, perfectly groomed eyebrows furrowing, eyes framed with dark long lashes narrowing, lips contoured and colored with a coral lipstick thinning. All the changes in her face where thanks to Tony, who guided her in the makeup and skincare world. Steve felt that the calculating look wasn't any longer pointed at Tony, but at him and his blue eyes met with his mother's. There was some confusion in his mom's eyes and a silent question if Steve was okay with all of this. Slowly, Steve smiled at his mom, hoping to communicate his thoughts properly - he was accepting every aspect of Tony, both his male and female side and couldn't imagine his life without Tony in it any longer. Sarah didn't have to approve of it, but it wouldn't change Steve's mind. No matter what, he was staying with Tony.
Steve snorted, reading the text. Of course, being dead was Sam’s first guess and the only valid excuse for missing Red Velvet’s performance.
“I wrote a new song and would love to share it with you all,” she said in her smooth, velvety voice, and Steve felt like melting. The crowd around him started to disappear and blend into the background. It was now only him and Red Velvet.
"To miss such a shot!" Steve growled as the crowd let a disappointed whine. Steve heavily sat on his seat, looking angered.
“Oh, babe…” Steve sighed softly, reading more posts, some screaming nervousness as Tony was pouring his heart out, feeling miserable with his inability to tell Steve the truth, some so heartwarming and oozing happiness when Tony was describing Steve’s last tickle attacks and how incredibly good and completed it made Tony feel.
"Ha, I am the top with Stone and Hammer gone," Tony laughed, swinging a bit harder and Steve's mouth open as he didn't expect to hear Tony say his oppressors' names any time soon. "Part of the therapy. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself."
"Pops! Stoop!" Peter called, the whole situation causing him to smile. It was just like when he was little and Steve used to play rough house with him all the time. Just that back then, Steve used to force him in submission either by blowing raspberries on his cheeks or tickling him, but Peter was definitely too old for this now -
"Just imagine how frightened I was when they both stood in the doorway looking like that! I thought someone assaulted them!"
"I still have like two dozens of cupcakes to frost--- why there is a cupcake missing from the display?"
It wasn’t supposed to happen. Not like this. Maybe it was never supposed to happen, staying as his hidden fantasy and dark secret. What if he deleted the account, right here, right now, would he be able to convince Steve that it never existed?
It was like Steve just waited for that and effortlessly threw laughing Tony over his shoulder, changing the direction and going straight to their bedroom. Tony already felt all excited but there was one thing that didn't want to leave him alone.
"Awww, but I told it is an artistic choice!" Arrow argued in a whiny voice, walking with Natasha to her changing room.
Watching Tony change into Red Velvet was a weird experience. Steve kept as quiet as he could, not wanting to disrupt the process, and taking it all in. He couldn’t help but stare in confusion as Red Velvet applied glue to her eyebrows, covered the trimmed goatee, and put a white foundation all over her face and down to the neck, hiding the tan. Then many layers of concealers and fluids, her face covered in stripes and dots. It looked better after blending with a pink tear shaped sponge and then, even more, makeup followed, bronzers and highlights, giving a softer shape and bringing out a female facial structure. The most mesmerizing part was the eye makeup. Black, sleek eyebrows. A perfect, dark cat eye, as Red Velvet used many brushes to blend and blend, creating a smoky look.
When Steve walked back into the apartment, it was barely after 9 am. He knew that Tony liked to sleep in after his shows, and Steve was really surprised when he heard Tony's voice, high and excited, coming from the bedroom.
"Hm," Steve made a disapproving sound, feeling that Friday was withholding some information from him. But he did miss some sleep and didn't have anything urgent scheduled in the morning, so...
Red rolled her eyes. "It is fine. If you don't want to, I won't force you," she said but sounded a bit offended. She sat on the chair and resumed her beauty routine without a word.
" flashed on the screen, read in a strong voice, with listening to the shops where the toys were available. Steve narrowed his eyes, spotting something written on the bottom of the screen. "
“You seem surprised,” she said, showing her teeth in a smile, and Steve realized that his mouth was hanging open. He quickly closed it, not believing in the transformation, even if he saw it with his own eyes. Red Velvet looked at the clock on the wall and seemed pleased with everything going according to the schedule. She stood up and Steve felt many different emotions with seeing Red Velvet’s face, but still on Tony’s body.
"If you let me do it, you and Red Velvet will -" Tony leaned to him, whispering something into his ear, words that made Steve's blood immediately flow south of his body and culminate at one point. That was unfair.
While Sarah was putting finishing touches on the mashed potatoes, Steve slowly finished a plate of tomato soup with noodles. His mom remembered that he wasn't a fan of the acidity in tomatoes and added a generous splash of sweet cream, making it smoother for the palate. With time, Steve's taste changed and he was better at handling more sour flavors, but still, the gesture was sweet and the soup tasted like his childhood. They didn't talk much, but the silence around them was so comforting and Steve just soaked in the serene atmosphere, feeling like a kid again.
Another thing to smell. Steve faked a smile and moved closer, taking a sniff of the ball in milky blue color with the shop’s name stamped on it. It wasn’t that bad. It smelled sweet and subtle.
"Huh, so we have a lot of random stuff under the couch..." Steve said from underneath, holding the couch, and Tony, over his head without any effort.
"Buck, what are you doing here?" Steve asked, watching Bucky yawning and snatching a fluffy bun from the display, hearing Sam's hiss to not touch the bread.
“You’re welcome,” Steve said happily, already knowing that Tony appreciated that, but it was nice to hear him say the words. “Just for the record, you would be happier to see me than pizza, right?”
"Guys day out?" she repeated, sounding amused. "Will we go to a strip club? Poker night and cigars? That stuff?"
"Nah, man. It is all about the love you put into your baking," Sam replied, smiling gently and Steve was sure that that smile wasn't for him, but for the dough. "Mixers don't give love."
“Tony!” Steve stopped, making someone behind him almost collided into his back. There was some angry cursing, but Steve didn’t pay any attention to it.
Tony hosts a meeting for his drag queen friends and Steve hangs out with his mom, deciding to share some big news with her.
"Tony and I started drag at the same time. The drag community was much smaller back then, all performers knew each other," Mint answered with a polite smile.
"Uh, sorry, no," Steve shivered again, quickly standing up. Tony looked puzzled after him. "I can't be here while you are doing that," he apologized, voice wavering with panic as he pointed at the bathtub. "Just… no," Steve said breathlessly and walked out from the bathroom in a hurry. Before he closed the door behind himself, he heard Tony bursting into cheerful giggling, that he should find offensive, but he was too relieved with getting out alive. The longer Steve thought about it, the more convinced he became that long hair was overrated and that short wig, with curly, chin-length hair looked the sexiest on Red Velvet.
"Good evening," Red Velvet kept smiling and the applause dimmed. Red took the microphone in her hand and started walking on the stage, her dress swiping over the floor. "I know you all noticed something different about me today," she said in a playful tone, getting a small laugh from the audience. "But this is not the end of surprises. First, I want to tell you a story. Some time ago, I met this guy," some suggestive whistling from the audience and Red winked, "this very special guy. One of a kind, but I am sure you already know this story, a guy meets a guy, they fall in love, yada yada yada," she rushed her own monologue, wanting to get to the gist faster. "And everything is great. Wonderful. And then… it happens. Just like that," she snapped her fingers, building the tension. "So I sadly inform you all, that this is one of my last performances as Miss Red Velvet," she said in a sorry tone, nodding her head sympathetically and rising a disappointed whine from the audience. Before the sad mood could start for good, she shook the sleeve on her left arm, letting it slide down and putting it out for everyone to see. "Because very soon I am gonna be Mrs. Red Velvet, I am engaged, bitches!" she shouted with a big smile, a gold ring with a row of diamonds shining on her finger.
“Why?” he asked, fearing that their meeting would end while it just started, and the word came out sadder than he planned.
"Don't forget about her back!" Red Velvet called, grinning broadly. Arrow flipped her sister off and it was met only with a giggle.
"Em, uhm-" was all that came out of Red Velvet's mouth and Bianca put one hand on her hip and glowered in a very motherly fashion.
"Who said you can go?!" a growl, a hand yanking on the back of his shirt and dragging him off behind the school building as soon as he stepped outside. The air was temporarily knocked out of Tony, when the neckline pinned into his throat, making him gasp and struggle. No one cared. No one noticed, everyone rushing to get home and forget about school until tomorrow.
Steve decided to not say anything more, only kept a gentle smile on his face as he let his pouting husband first into the elevator and followed selecting their penthouse. Their date night, coinciding with Halloween, something Tony might have matched earlier, was kind of a disaster. All movies in the theaters were horrors and modern horrors were not what he remembered from when he was growing up. The stories were repeatable, movie effects were tacky and the acting was horrible. To add to the offense, the restaurant they wanted to have dinner in, had an emergency and was closed for the day. Tony was irritated and hungry and just wanted to go home, order pizza and spend the rest of Halloween on the couch, eating miniature sized candy bars. Maybe watch some movies from Peter's childhood, because watching Peter roll in his blanket and rompers and babbling happily always cheered him up and Peter's embarrassed groans were a bonus.
"What do you mean?" Steve asked, not understanding what happened. He came into the bar just minutes ago and didn't have time to do anything yet, except maybe chatting to Thor at the front and sitting at his table.
“Hm? Hi!” Red Velvet smiled at another male approaching them. Sturdy, middle built, with short dirty blond hair, a nose that looked like it might have taken a punch. Bright smile. Steve could swear he saw that smile somewhere.
"I would say he even likes," Tony smiled, petting cat's fluffy head, who became very interested in the cat-Hulk plushie.
"What? Pops, no!" Peter denied, not needing to be smashed into the carpet in front of his friends. The conversation behind him suddenly ended and he could feel everyone looking at him.
Tony groaned and hid his face into Figaro's happily purring form. To show love and support, Figaro brushed his face against Tony's forehead, gently head butting him. "Thanks, buddy," Tony said, imagining that the photo of Iron Man, sitting on a can, with pajama bottoms around his ankles and a lap full of a fluffy cat would become an instant Internet hit. Lucky for him, Steve decided to save him shame and kept the photo private, and by private, he meant himself and the Avengers group chat.
"Hey, I will be going," Steve said, taking Red by the elbow and interrupting the discussion over a fashion magazine and material samples about if Red could pull off a dress with an open leg or not.
"I would love to have a dog," Steve said, smiling at the idea. He never had pets growing up and dogs were wonderful companions and friends.
"Stay where you are," Tony ordered, ending the connection. He didn't care to change and only wrapped a coat around himself and slipped bare feet into a pair of sneakers, not wanting to waste any time. He grabbed his keys and his phone, just in case, and ran down the stairs, ignoring the elevator and finding it too slow in such an urgent situation.
"I think," Steve started in a heavy voice, feeling his throat becoming dry, "I think I like you this way," he twirled a wet strand of brown hair between his fingers, before tugging it behind Tony's ear.
Steve laughed quietly, wrapping Tony tighter in his arms and smiling brightly. "No, you don't," Steve cheerfully refused the request, not keen on denying himself the pleasure of seeing Tony Stark struggling to keep his mouth shut.
"Oh my God, get out!" Tony panicked, not liking what he was seeing, and easily identified as an allergy attack. Roses? The scented candles? The new silk sheets in red color sprayed with essentials oils? There were too many variables and there was no time to analyze them all before Steve's head would swell like a tomato.
"What?" Steve stopped, sounding a bit impatient. Tony grinned, hearing the hunger in his boyfriend's voice.
"Hey, honey," Red Velvet said, turning her eyes to Steve. "Want to feel how smooth I am," she purred, taking his hand and slipping it under the robe, his palm resting over smooth, heated skin near the inner thigh area.
“If you keep asking, it takes the surprise factor AWAAHHAHA!” Tony’s newly found boost of confidence was efficiently cut off when Steve latched hands to his sides and squeezed repeatedly. Tony doubled over in laughter and squirmed away, watching with a pounding heart as Steve followed him, smiling beautifully mischievous. “No, no, no, wait, Steve! STEHEVE!” Tony screeched in laughter when Steve ran forward, pushing Tony on the bed, and falling with him. “ACK! STE - hahaha! Waaait!” Tony wailed when fingers were going up and down his body tickling intensely. When Tony became pink in the face and a little breathless, Steve stopped, leaning in and kissing Tony’s smiling lips.
Steve swallowed thickly, looking at her. A tight, long-sleeved red dress hugged her hourglass figure, accenting the porcelain skin tone. It wasn’t long, sleek hair this time, but a wavy bob cut, giving some youthful and fresh look to her face. She looked absolutely stunning. And yet…
Tony sniffled for the last time and lifted the sunglasses a bit to wipe his eyes. “Let’s go back. I have an evening show to get ready for.”
“Pathetic,” Sam remarked, shaking his head at his friend’s behavior. He knew Steve since forever and knew that the blond was usually better in control of his emotions. Just this place had such weird effect on him.
"I need to tell you something," Steve continued, trying to keep the trembling out of his voice. Now or never.
okay, this part was the most difficult to write so far… with all the steps of getting into drag, I watched and read a lot to make it as accurate as possible, hope it is believable! how did you like the big reveal of Arrow's identity? did anyone guess who Arrow is? more Marvel characters will appear with time!
"Well, it is complicated… Sam didn't really have a choice," Steve said, scratching the back of his neck.
Tony narrowed his eyes, not liking how easily Steve could read through him. When it came to food, Tony’s mind worked in a simple way - he saw food, he ate it. There was no point in wasting a good pizza and pout that your husband was too busy for an impromptu make out.
After nearly 40 minutes, there was some knocking on the glass door. Tony didn’t understand, because Steve had his personal code, but maybe it was part of the fun. Like, waiting for your date to show up at the doorstep. Tony smiled fondly, thinking that Steve could be all orders and strictness, but was a romantic deep down, and romance wasn’t something they had a lot in their superhero lives. Tony went to unlock the door, just to find out that it wasn’t Steve on the other side.
Bianca shook her head in reprimand, but smiled in the end, her cheek dimples showing again. "Your lovely boyfriend invited me here! He can be a persistent one," she said, gesturing at Steve. Red whipped her head and stared at Steve in shock and he smiled sheepishly. Reaching Bianca wasn't easy, but he wanted all of Tony's friends to share this moment with him. "I guess he is not your boyfriend any longer though! So, just let me congratulate you both and I am just gonna sit quietly here and enjoy the show," she added, turning her voice down, pointing at the table where Sarah, Sam, Rhodey and Lady Mint were sitting at, Thor already putting another chair for her, between Sarah and Lady Mint. "Thank you, darling!" she smiled at Thor and turned to the people at the table. "Hi, I am Bianca del Rio," she reached her hand to greet everyone, "you must be Steve's mom?" she said looking at Sarah, who seemed stunned but pleased, not really understanding everything that was going around her, but delighted to be a part of it, "kids grow up so fast, right?" she sniffled exaggeratedly and sat down.
"Um, sohhahary," Tony giggled, straightening up and trying to mirror his husband's look. He couldn't and just curled in laughter again after a few seconds.
“Ma, Tony is—” and Steve’s voice got stuck again. Who? Who is Tony? A drag queen? My boyfriend? God, they never even discussed who they were for each other. Steve’s mind whirred in panic.
"And now, I would like you all to meet him," Red said into the mike, trying to be louder than everybody, "you probably already seen him," she added in a playful jab, meaning Steve's almost stalking her, "but it is the first time you will really meet him, my personal Prince Charming, my future husband, Mr. Blue Velvet! Come on, hun!" she called, gesturing at the silver curtain.
“What is int - noooooo!” Tony wailed, understanding the reason behind the smile. It was stronger than him and Tony started to panic. “It is a lie, Steve! Don’t believe the lieeee no no aaah HELP!”
"Mhm," Tony hummed contentedly, turning to better face Steve and wrapped hands around his, officially, fiancé's neck, pressing their bodies together. That short bathrobe and a ring on Tony's finger - it was everything Steve wanted to see for the rest of his life.
"Oh," a flashback of the drag queen meeting in Tony's apartment came immediately to Steve's mind. Or the home spa evening he and Tony had from time to time. "Am I invited too?"
The crowd laughed at the unusual joke but used to Red Velvet’s type of humor. Steve would laugh too if he was in the crowd, but he knew that the words were directed to him, so he obediently sat in the chair and hid his phone away, hoping that Sam would do the same. After all, the show was on, and when Red Velvet started to sing it was as sweet as honey.
"Welcome home, babe," Steve smiled lovingly and finally gave some proper attention to his boyfriend and kissed Tony's smiling lips. It was a nice kiss, sweet and pure, but way shorter than how Tony imagined after two weeks of not seeing each other.
"Thaaaaat - Loki ate Thor's sandwich again," Steve lied smoothly, and Tony laughed, buying it. It was a plausible scenario after all. Not having time to lose, Tony sat in front of his station and Steve took his place on the couch, his thoughts drifting away and distracting him from the current moment. The catalog with engagement rings was still opened in his phone and his and Tony's conversation, the one from before they had entered his mom's house, kept repeating itself in his mind. The words he had said came easy to him, rolling off his tongue smoothly, like if it was the most natural thing and something bound to happen, but just with Tony and no one else. He couldn't imagine wakening up and falling asleep next to anyone else than Tony. He wanted Tony's lips to be the last thing he tasted in the evening and the first one in the morning. Touch him, love him, kiss him. Only Tony. But was it the right decision? It was a huge step, they had a good thing going on, and a too soon proposal could ruin everything.
Steve looked with sad eyes at the dark-haired teen sobbing, his clothes getting soaked from the wet ground. It was a miserable picture. "Let's go," Steve decided, hooking his arms with Tony's and pulling him up on his feet. To his surprise, Tony didn't struggle, didn't say a word, just kept quietly crying, not having any strength left.
“Ladies and gentleman!” a voice echoed in the bar, one that Steve had assigned to Loki - seemed that he wasn’t only a bodyguard but also an announcer. “Please give a warm welcome to our first performer of the evening, Miss Red Velvet!”
"Aw, you two are such frat boys, it is adorable," Red Velvet smiled. "But don't you have somewhere to be?" she said, looking directly at Tootsie.
"OW!" Tony yelled when a paintball pellet hit him between shoulder blades. That would leave a bruise.
"I… I think I know you," Steve said, not letting his eyes off Tootsie. The guy turned to him with a slightly mocking smile.
“Okay,” Tony said quietly, before taking a trembling breath in and finally looking at Steve. “I am ready when you’re ready,” he said.
Steve took a deep breath and plopped down on the swivel chair, making it squeak. His heart was beating rapidly and he could still feel Tony's body pressed into his and the overwhelming heat lingering on his clothes and tingling his skin.
“Um, sure,” Steve said, not entirely sold on the idea, but not wanting to shot Tony’s idea down. “You call yourself Spare Parts Man, right?” Steve asked and Tony nodded. “Soooo… How about you call me Iron Man?”
"Ah, thanks," the girl smiled, turning more into his direction and leaving the boy she came with unattended. "It is from the new collection from Madam Viper-"
"They released a new collection?!" Tony asked, widening his eyes in surprise. He usually was more up to date with the cosmetic market. Just like that, he found himself a new conversationalist for the game.
Sam nodded in understanding. “Maybe you should ask Tony to lend you one of his facial masks,” he added in a playful tone.
"I know, silly!" Sarah laughed, turning around and walking to the kitchen. "Now hurry up, or dinner will get cold!"
"Oh, not only for that," Steve said in a low murmur and Tony squeaked when Steve slid his hand lower and squeezed Tony's butt, digging all fingers in. "And after you eat and rest, I will give you and your whole body all the attention it deserves."
"I guess you were right, I like doing that," Steve replied sounding proud, resuming walking and leaving Tony alone. For now.
Tony kept it short. He had left Steve at the bathroom and ordered him to take a long and hot shower to warm himself up and go straight to bed after and wait for him. In the meantime, Tony headed to the kitchen and used the freshly restocked supplies to make a warming up drink for Steve. Orange slices, ginger, cloves, cinnamon, a bit of honey for sweetness and a lot of boiling water to let it all steep. His hands were shaking a bit and it wasn’t from his short trip outside or from holding Steve’s cold hands in his. Tony tried to scold himself and stop coming up with more and more terrifying scenarios, and wait for Steve’s story, but it was becoming increasingly difficult.
“What color is better for me - this one, or this one?” Tony asked, holding in his hands two lipsticks. He was trying to hide it, but his lips were twitching into a mocking smile, almost as if he planned to torment Steve with the task.
For a second, Red Velvet didn’t do anything. She didn’t move away either, which was a good thing, but Steve couldn’t say anything from her eyes. Those beautiful eyes, with icy blue irises, hiding the warmest shade of brown. Steve was torn, not knowing which look he loved more.
“It is not my story to tell,” he said and Tony dropped his head down. There would come a time for Sarah to find out about Red Velvet. If he and Steve were supposed to be long term couple, there was no way to hide it. “But I have a different story,” Steve continued, his voice sounding more enthusiastic, as he held Tony closer and reached for his hand. “I want to introduce you to my ma. Properly this time. With titles and everything,” Steve joked.
"Uh, my what?" Steve blinked owlishly hearing Tony asking him a question. Not Tony, Red Velvet. Somehow he missed the entire transformation process and saw Tony, all dolled up in red material, sitting in front of her makeup station. She was putting some sparkling earrings on and watched Steve in the mirror, her eyes shining with mischief.
"Ummm… fine?" Steve answered insecurely, not understanding why he was being asked that again. Red's smile dropped to morph into somewhat fond expression when she thought how cute and oblivious her boyfriend was. Steve didn't get to ask more questions, because Red continued to talk.
"Oh, I have everything I need to keep me sustained right here," Steve said in a dark voice, shamelessly groping Tony's round butt with one hand.
"Babe!" Steve called, knocking on the bathroom door with his knuckles. "How much longer will you take in there?"
"No!" Steve yelled out, grabbing at Tony's wrists and trying to pull his boyfriend to himself and trap under and Tony was successfully not letting him.
It wasn't their couch's fault that he and Tony got in a massive argument over something stupid and Steve was banned to sleep in the living room. Steve just needed to take out his anger on something, and well, he had only the couch to do that.
"Hello. Can I help you?" a guy with a friendly smile approached Steve. He was dark skinned and medium built, in orange coverall. He was wiping his hands with some cloth, leaving car grease stains on the material.
Red's breath stopped when she saw the ring on the black insert. She looked back at Steve, eyes glistening with emotions, and said something Steve certainly didn't expect but found very fitting.
"Hm," Steve smiled softly, grateful for that point of view. Sam always supported him. Bucky was back in the city. And he had Tony. Everything was turning out so good.
"Nu-uh! I am out!" Steve protested, one time being enough. He darted off the stool, just to be firmly pushed down again.
"Son of-" Tony cursed, drawing away suddenly. "Sorry, Steve, I have to handle this!" he said, nearly running out of the office. "LOGAN! How is it going, my friend?"
In the end, Steve had to admit that home spa evenings were not so bad. And bath bombs were pretty amazing.
He didn't let anyone on his plan and so far, everything was going good. The only person who knew what was about to happen was the owner of the Pitted Olive, an exceptionally somber-looking guy named Nick Fury, who, as Tony had told him, was once a very famous drag queen back in the day called Madam Wrath. A very fitting name.
Steve left the bakery, holding the pink package and smiling lightly. He was hoping that Tony would love his surprise.
“Luckily, I have a one,” Tony said lightly, rummaging in one of the baskets, “and it can fit in two people. You always want to take the ones that are on the bottom, they are the freshest,” Tony said before the first sentence had a chance to sink in Steve’s mind. Taking a bath with Tony sounded like a nice reward after this ordeal. “You will love this one.”
"Shh," Steve soothed, leaning more on his husband's smaller frame, entering even deeper, feeling Tony tremble in pleasure. He pushed his hips forward, angling downwards and Tony jerked his head, screaming in delight.
"Told your mom wha-" Tony's voice got stuck when he realized what Steve meant. Sarah was a sweet lady, but hearing that your child was gay was probably never easy, even for the most loving parents. Tony really feared what he might hear next. "Oh, sweetheart…" he started in a voice so compassionate, the only answer he heard was a chocked out sob, Steve tried to hold in. "What happened?" Tony asked, not hearing the answer, just the sound of a car zooming past. "Wait… Steve, where are you?"
Tony hissed in slight pain but grinned in the end. Steve used to freely express his love for Tony's bubble butt and that always made Tony feel good.
“Any plans for the rest of the night?” Steve asked, putting both hands on Tony’s hips and swaying with him. “Wanna grab a bite?” a shared late night meal after Red Velvet’s show became one of their rituals.
It wasn't like Tony to be a considerate sleeping partner - Tony could flop all over the place, kick the covers down or pull them to himself and wrap with the material, creating a cocoon. Other times, he tended to crash into Steve, rolling into his sleeping body with force and holding, looking for his husband's sleeping form and being a clingy octopus. Even if that usually woke Steve up, it was comforting and Steve quickly fell back to sleep, lulled by the sound of Tony's breathing and his warmth, unlike on those nights when Tony wrapped himself in the covers, and Steve had to wrestle some material from underneath him. So, even if Steve woke up, he decided to not give it away, because Tony clearly didn't want to disturb him. Tony tried to be all sneaky and quiet, slowly moving to the side of the bed, almost sliding, trying to evenly distribute his weight and not let the mattress dipping give him away. It would be a success, if not for the final part, when, probably he stepped on something on the floor, most probably the socks he had carelessly thrown to the floor the evening earlier, and spectacularly slipped and tumbled down the bed, landing on the floor with a loud thud and a bit back curse. Still, Steve didn't react, and Tony did neither, just staying still and out of Steve's line of sight. The moment continued, and Steve felt alarmed, thinking that Tony wasn't a klutz, but he had a history of unfortunate accidents while not fully rested, and Steve feared that maybe his husbands slipped so badly he somehow managed to bang his head, but before that thought could fully form, there was Tony's head popping up over the edge of the bed and very, very slowly, Tony stood up, taking his night robe and quietly tiptoed out of the bedroom.
“You remember that shop where I bought the flowers and candles?” Tony said suddenly and Steve looked at him. Tony’s eyes were fixed on the grave and hidden behind the sunglasses, but Steve could still see some sadness in the brown eyes.
The couch he and Tony liked to sit on and watch TV, Tony somehow always ending with his butt in Steve's lap, despite plenty of room left. Their couch wasn't that narrow but sometimes seemed so, whenever Steve walked on Tony napping and Steve just had to slot himself between Tony and the backrest, just to be close to his boyfriend. Their couch was also perfect for the times when Steve liked to read books and could sit comfortably, Tony's head resting in his lap, while his boyfriend kept working on a tablet or on his phone. To be honest, Steve loved their comfortable couch as it brought him and Tony many moments of closeness.
Everyone started clapping to welcome the performer, but it was nothing in comparison to how rapidly Steve’s heart started beating. Through the silver curtains showed a hand, and pushed the fabric open, letting it drape a bit over herself, and prolonging the moment. When the person walked out and to the middle of the stage accompanied by applause, Steve had to try hard to not stand up and start whistling.
If Steve was still debating being ready to take that step with Tony, the ultimate reassurance came days later from a very unexpected place.
"Sometimes I forget how freakishly strong you are..." Tony muttered angrily to himself, not directing the complaint to his husband, but Steve laughed anyway still hearing it because of his super-soldier hearing. Of course. "Put me down!"
Tony frowned gently, already familiar with Rogers' family fair complexion and occasional freckles, but he didn't think much about it, assuming that Steve got his pale skin after his mom.
He closed his eyes, breathing in the invigorating smell of coffee and maple syrup. It was early afternoon, and he was sat in an unknown diner, at the counter, waiting.
"Wow, you're so gorgeous," Sarah said, instead of the usual hello, and Mint smiled gratefully. "I am sorry I am staring, it is just the first time I am seeing a drag queen up close. Sorry! Is that something I shouldn't say?" she grimaced in panic and looked over at Sam, silently asking for help. Sam just smiled good-naturedly, because this was so like Steve's mom to be so honest and mindful at the same time.
“Red Velvet can attract — a varied type of crowd,” Loki said, looking back at Steve, sending him a warning.
“Believe me, you make a great first impression,” Steve smiled in all honesty, remembering how he had been twice stunned by Tony. First, with him as Red Velvet in the club, and then in the diner, when he showed up as himself. The first impressions were what made Steve want to meet him, but it was the things that he was learning now, that made him want to stay. “Tony?” he asked when Tony still refused to look up. “Come on, look at me.”
Steve just kept Tony in his arms, grinning triumphantly, as the camera moved away from them to force more couples to show some affection to each other.
Steve knew that after all, they went through, Tony feared facing his mom. He could understand that, but he really wanted them to meet. Both of him and Tony were used to hiding who they were and to break this cycle, Steve felt that it was essential for his mom to meet Tony as Tony. His boyfriend.
"Oh my gosh, dear, come here," Sarah said, reaching her hands to Tony and cradling him to her chest, noticing how very distressed he became. She brushed her hand over Tony's hair, soothing him and Tony accepted the hug, even closed his eyes, savoring the moment. It has been a long time since the last time he had received a hug like that, not by a friend, not by a lover, but by a parent. Tony could feel the unconditional love Sarah had for Steve and it felt like she was building the same feeling towards him.
It was almost frightening how quickly all those feelings grew in him, almost rapidly, without any control. That was just such a Steve thing to do, to jump forward into his feelings, to let them succumb him entirely. It was exactly the same when he had seen Red Velvet for the first time on the stage, falling hard for her, and with time falling even harder for the man who brought Red Velvet to life. It was haste, poorly thought out decision to ask Red Velvet to met with him, and only good things came out of it in the end, but what if he already used up the amount of good luck in his life? What if, from this moment, everything would just go downhill? He was lucky, very lucky and had great people around him, and maybe it was the moment to slow down and enjoy what he had, instead of cutting off bigger and bigger slices of the cake life handed to him.
Oh, it would be so easy to get an upper hand again. Steve didn’t know if Tony was just terrible at self-defense, but he left his torso completely in the open and just one, well-measured poke and Steve would have a lap full of a giggling Iron Man. But he didn’t want to spoil the moment, quite fond of their new play.
After riding a few blocks, Steve parked his bike at the appointed spot. He leaned his head to the side, looking at the building in front of him. It was an auto repair shop, one belonging to the T&R franchise, located all over the country. That was Tony's day job? He couldn't imagine Tony working in a place like this. Maybe Tony was an accountant of some sort. Some office job. That sounded more like the Tony he knew, who didn't like to get dirty and went for manicures on regular basis.
"Uhhh?" Steve looked up from his phone, seeing Clint next to him and smiling brightly. Tony had been running late and Steve was waiting outside Red Velvet's changing room, looking through some catalogs. Who would have guessed that choosing an engagement ring could be so daunting?
"You know, baby, I didn't know there was so much heat hidden in you," Tony purred, moving closer to the blond, and putting his lips to the other's ear. Maybe they could find some private corner and -
"Come on, come at me. Get your toy shield and try to knock me down," Steve encouraged, gesturing for Peter to charge at him.
"I can't believe you talked me into this," Steve grunted, curling on the stool in the bathroom, only in his boxers. There was more warmth on his back and he felt the scrape of a wooden spatula on his skin, smearing the sticky substance.
"Uh. Yeah, sure!" Tony called back, his voice sounding a bit amused that Steve even had to ask about that. Well, maybe using the bathroom in front of your partner was just another step in becoming a couple. They bathed together, slept together, Steve even sometimes partook in Tony's home spa rituals, it wasn't like either of them would see something new.
They both sat on the facing sides of the table in a booth, and the guy kept looking at Steve. The same sort of amusement he knew so well.
Watching Tony transforming into Red Velvet… That was something Steve didn’t know he needed in his life, but he couldn’t wait to see it.
“You could have,” Steve nodded. Finding out that Tony and his mom met a couple of times was a shock, but his mom seemed to blossom thanks to that friendship and in the end, Steve wanted the best for her. “Why you didn’t?” Steve asked.
Steve laughed and nodded, agreeing, not imagining anyone else in that role. Sam could do some amazing things and uniquely combine flavors. There was no one better for the job.
Red Velvet made some gesture with her hand and piano music started to seep, filling in the room and Steve’s heart. Calming and soothing and sad. Red Velvet closed her eyes and started to sway her beautiful hips to the gentle music.
Somehow from being too shy to pee in front of the other, their relationship developed to this. That was some progress.
"Come on, let's go eat," Steve decided, smelling the pizza and feeling hungry. He let Tony go first and followed him. He was honest, and he really didn't like bullies. It was one of the reasons. The second reason was, that he liked the teen in front of him a whole lot more than he would like to admit to.
And then it happened. The camera zoomed on them, showing Tony and Wanda in a pink pastel screen, little red hearts floating around them. Wanda laughed shyly, and Tony froze, his hand still on Steve's sleeve. There was a cheer, urging Tony and Wanda to kiss, and, after getting a confirming nod from Wanda, Tony did the friendly thing and kissed her puffed out cheek delicately. It wasn't what was expected from them, and the camera didn't leave them, urging to a proper kiss.
From there it went smoothly and Red Velvet performed a spontaneous singing duet with her fiancé before singing her usual repertoire, Arrow did a magic act out of her routine, Tootsie sang some heavy songs, and even Lady Mint and Bianca got talked into performing. Halfway the night, Sam had sneaked out to his bakery, and with Rhodey's help, rolled in trays of white sheet cakes, covered in vanilla buttercream and decorated with piped out roses and written congratulations to Red and Steve and everyone got a slice, wishing the newly engaged couple all the best.
It was a brief, tense moment, and Sarah narrowed her blue eyes before her face relaxed. "Ah, you boys and your secrets," she said in a fond reprimand, "it is okay, Stevie, you can say gay bar - "
Arrow hummed in agreement, Lady Mint smiled, glad for her sister finding happiness, and it was again Tootsie who had to spoil it all.
“Aren’t you full of surprises,” he purred out playfully and put the samples away. He added the rose lipstick into the basket and that made Steve feel a bit proud. Steve hoped that it would be the end for today, but Tony just trotted away to find more products.
“Uhm, well,” Tony said when Steve let him go, looking adorably shy. “Back in my days, people tried to stay more covert.”
"Hi! Nice to meet you," he said politely, trying to mask his confusion. When Tony managed to make a friend?
"I am gonna ask you again, maybe this time you will get it right," Bucky clapped in his hands, his grin spreading, "hey, Steve, how's your head?"
Steve stopped. Still holding Tony, he reached down for brunet's hand and put it to his mouth, kissing the knuckles. Chaste and sweet. "Milady."
Tony wasn’t sure what to think. On one hand, that wasn’t what he ordered (pun intended) and Steve instead of bringing his ass to the workshop, sent pizza as if silencing him with food. On the other hand, the hunger pangs in his stomach started and Tony efficiently had quieted them with work and caffeine, but couldn’t control it anymore, not when the scent of hot and delicious pizza was filling his whole workshop.
“Yeah, but I need time to get in drag. Told you, I am a fishy queen,” Tony hummed, taking out his wallet.
No. Not until he would get to the other side, and Figaro scratched and meowed with double force. He won't lose this battle.
’ part,” Steve admitted, as cold night air surrounded them when they walked through the back door of the club and into the street.
"And I can burp out the alphabet," Tootsie bragged and Steve laughed together with everyone and heard Lady Mint turning to Tootsie and asking if she ever thought about doing a comedy routine.
"Eyes on the wig," Steve warned, feeling Tony's curious gaze on him. There was a small disappointed whine, but Tony obeyed, giving his boyfriend some privacy.
"Woah!" Red gasped, and her hands jumped up to her face in shock, a very Tony like gesture, before she toned it down and pressed one hand to her lips. "Steve, what's happening?" she asked, her hand sliding down, just a little to not obscure the words.
Seemed that Sarah understood. After all, if Steve was at peace with Tony's lifestyle, she wouldn't be the one trying to force them to change. At the end of the day, the most important factor for her, was if her son was happy and seemed that Tony made him a happy man. Not only Tony, as Sarah also valued her friendship with Tony.
Tony was bored. So, so bored. He caught a glimpse of Pepper sending him a scolding look and straightened up in his seat, pretending to pay attention. He just wanted to go back home and curl up next to Steve, feeling Steve’s fingers stroking his hair and maybe, if he got lucky, Steve would rub his belly, using just enough pressure to make him smile and feel like melting. He started to smile at the thought and Pepper sent him a confused look. Uh oh. He better control himself. Tony grinned sheepishly at Pepper and set his face in a schooled, thoughtful look, trying to focus his attention on the meeting. Just half an hour more… It was all ending statements, so it was nothing bad if he decided to check his social media, right? Cautiously, Tony took out his phone and unlocked the screen, keeping the phone under the table. A new tasting video from Thor, with a package of sweets sent from the Netherlands. Tony made a mental note to drop later to Thor’s floor and ask if he had any stroopwafels left to share because they were amazing with black coffee. Clint commenting on funny cats videos, Tony added it to his watch later list. As usual, his own social media were bursting with notifications, people raving over Iron Man and asking for more videos of Steve training routine, which, Tony couldn’t blame them, the sight of his boyfriend working out was heaven. He even decided to check his Tumblr, curious if anyone sent him some more tips or maybe just left him a nice message -
Tony almost jumped away, when Steve came closer and wrapped arms around him. After a moment of hesitation, Tony buried himself into his soldier’s arms, his face pressed against Steve’s neck. Probably the last hug he would receive from Steve. This whole thing won’t make Avengers stuff awkward at all. What if Steve would quit the team? Tony couldn’t imagine not being able to see Steve anymore. He needed him. He would change, he would do better. Steve couldn’t break up with him.
The crowd cheered, the loudest being Wanda and Pietro, but maybe because they were the closest. Steve could feel how tense Tony became, but he didn't move away, allowing Steve to take the lead. When the kiss ended, Tony stayed close to the other man, putting his heated face in the crook of Steve's neck, needing a minute for his racing mind to calm down. They had kissed in public. Again. It was some big steps for him.
“God, Tony,” Steve said in an exasperated huff, not believing how quickly this whole thing could escalate in Tony’s mind. Then again, he should know, because Tony did think too much and sometimes didn’t stop his thoughts on time, letting them drag him deeper and deeper. “Tony, I am not breaking up with you,” Steve said again, just to make sure the words sunk in his boyfriend’s head. “And I am sorry,” Steve gently put his thumb and forefinger under Tony’s chin, encouraging him to eye contact. 'Sorry you turned out to be messed up in the head,’ Tony finished in his mind, looking into Steve’s blue eyes.
“And it is all organic too!” Tony chirped enthusiastically, rubbing some gray goop into his wrist and putting near Steve’s nose to smell. It was a bit sweet, but also an earthy smell.
Tony waited two weeks for this. The excited way, Steve immediately jumped off the couch and rushed in his direction, looking like an oversized Labrador puppy. Leaving for business trips was hard, but coming back when he was having such a warm welcome, was so much sweeter.
Tony smiled weakly, grateful for the gesture. “I enrolled in A.A., went to therapy and slowly fixed my life. Bit by bit. But it wasn’t until I stepped into a drag queen bar where I felt… Safe. And accepted. And then one evening - I had the last glass of alcohol in my life, on the night of my first performance as Red Velvet. I wanted to celebrate her,” when Tony looked at Steve, tears were shining in his eyes and he noticed Steve frowning at him and he knew the reason why. “It was alcohol-free,” he laughed, meaning the bottle of sparkling wine he kept drinking yesterday, brought by Bucky. “Tootsie knows I have a problem.”
Steve couldn’t help but feel confused after hearing the news. In comparison to the blond bodyguard, Loki looked rather… unimpressive.
“HAAHAHA! Stoooop,” Tony tried to swat Steve away, feeling too blissful to move. Of course that a long, intimate tickle session changed into an amazing make out. It was incredible how the tickle foreplay increased their appetite and how wonderfully responsive Tony became.
"Daddy will be out soon!" Tony repeated without a second of hesitation. Figaro sat his fluffy butt down under the door and when it seemed like a success, he meowed deeper and longer and resumed scratching.
"Ohhh you gotta be shitting me," Tony gritted out, desperately needing Steve's touch and calling it a bluff. Steve wouldn't. When the touching stopped and Steve's hand slipped away, Tony panicked. It wasn't a joke. Steve was serious. And he was in no position to argue. Tony sucked in a long breath and exaggeratedly puffed his cheeks out, showing that he had no intention of talking anymore.
Oh, that was weird. Usually, he had maybe two or three messages, some reblogs, and a few comments. This time, his app was bursting with notifications and Tony didn’t post anything that could cause such a commotion in the last days.
"Why do I even bother with having interns?!" Tony complained loudly, just for the sake of complaining. "Watch them for me, okay?" he said quietly to Rhodey, using a softer voice. Rhodey nodded, walking for starters to Harley, who seemed to be getting overwhelmed.
"Par-fè," Sam corrected, using French pronunciation, ignoring the way Bucky ostentatiously rolled his eyes, "because it has layers."
"The last one," Steve negotiated, pulling Tony closer and wrapping hands possessively around his lover, "and then I want you all to myself," he said, obscenely groping Tony's round butt, just to make a point.
Maybe it wasn't the intention, but the first thing that came to Red's mind was that Prince Charming from "
Steve was taken by surprise, when a pastrami sandwich and a glass of orange juice appeared in front of him, while the guy received a small cup of strong coffee and a glass of water. The sandwich looked and smelled delicious, with coleslaw and pink pastrami neatly stacked inside on a thin layer of yellow mustard and a side of cut gherkin, yet he still kept staring at the guy in front of him.
"Hey, come here," Tony demanded, not liking the sudden empty and cold feeling. When Steve leaned back in, Tony lifted his head and turned to the side, locking their lips in a kiss. Long and needy, lips overlapping and tongues rubbing against each other, lasting and lasting, because who needed to breathe anyway.
Steve smiled crookedly, putting his hands on other man's hips and pushing him closer. Holding Tony in his arms did get some of the sting out from the previous offense. "You will like it. We will eat something now."
"You think you can be a better Captain America than I am?" Steve asked, some growl making its way in his voice. Just there was no real anger in it. More like some playfulness mixed with a challenge.
"Dear, don't talk with your mouth full," Sarah reprimanded, glancing briefly at her son, and focusing back on the photos. "Here is Steve when he was eight years old."
"Only if you have some better proposition for me," Tony fluttered his eyelashes in a flirty move. As an encouragement, Steve kissed him again, long and sweet, letting the feeling linger.
"Um, not really, I just have some favor to ask," Steve smiled shyly, scratching the back of his head. "I will have some guests coming today, could you make sure they get to my usual table?"
Clearly, Tootsie waited for something, but Steve just shrugged again, really not seeing any problem.
Steve's appearance was met with more applause as he entered the stage in his blue velvet jacket, smiling insecurely, but clearly happy. After having a final confirmation, Sarah sobbed into her hands from happiness, and Rhodey, Mint, and Sam stood up, joining the cheering for the just engaged couple. Steve walked to Red and put an arm around his lady, and they kissed briefly, Red cupping Steve's face tenderly. Usually, Tony had to stand on his tiptoes or pull Steve down into a kiss, but thanks to high heels, Steve had to tilt his head up just a bit, Red slightly higher than him.
“Are you sure you don’t want to join us for lunch?” Tony asked when the three of them walked out of the shop. He enjoyed Sarah’s company, and Steve had a nasty feeling that Tony liked her more than him at this particular moment.
"Hey, what do you know, he is also handsome and dreamy," Tony walked over, grinning adorably and swaying his hips. "Hi, baby," he greeted Steve, standing on his tiptoes and kissing him for hello. He smelled like grease and heated metal and sweat and Steve already felt dizzy.
Tony snorted, his whole body jumping with the movement. "Mhm... Steve?" He started, sounding tired and on a verge of sleep, but in that good, satisfied way.
Steve blinked rapidly, the words sinking in. "That… That was really good," he said in awe, temporarily distracted from his dilemma.
Steve clicked his tongue, not knowing how to put it to not offend Tony. They had a great, steady sex life, based on mutual pleasure and feeling secure and it was really, really good. He didn't want to ruin it.
Steve uncurled, his face less heated. Okay, it was coming to an end. Some more talking, and soon a red-haired woman in a white cosmetician coat walked out of the room. She spotted Steve and smiled, in a bit terrifying way. "She is all yours now."
"Aaah, I don't know," Steve said, awkwardly. He was happy for Sam, and anyone who found their calling in drag but wasn't sure if it was for him, even if Tony subtly tried to convince him to wear drag, even once. And well, he already wore high heels. And used facial masks. And waxed. Was that the next step? Just to see how it is to be 'on the other side'? "Maybe? But I am not getting married in a dress," Steve said quickly before anything could pop into his friend's mind.
"Bye! Hope to see you soon!" Tony waved at Wanda and Pietro walking away. The game had ended and Tony and Steve said goodbye to the siblings, not before Tony invited them over to the Olive for his nearest show. Wanda seemed more interested than Pietro, especially eager to hear all about makeup tricks Tony knew and Tony already promised her an exclusive backstage tour to which she reacted very enthusiastically. Maybe going out for the game wasn't so bad after all.
And just like that, the smile and a friendly stance were gone and the man visibly tensed up. "For Tony?" he asked, his voice sounding lower and more rumbly.
Tony really didn’t understand. No yelling, no screaming, no crying. Unless… Tony looked at Steve, guilt, and confusion written all over his face.
"No, only shave some parts. Which, between you and me, wouldn't actually hurt to do, you know, I have enough of plucking your hair out from between my teeth each time---"
Tony giggled, and it was a cute reaction he always had whenever Steve kissed or tapped on his nose. Almost as if the tip of his nose was ticklish.
Tony and Steve exchanged surprised looks, before smiling at each other in relief. Thanks to Figaro, the rest of the night would be calm.
"Negative!" Tony called back, and Peter kicked his legs with another ear drums ripping scream, not liking this position.
"Oh my God, Pete, come on, it is okay, it is okay, little bee," Tony repeated frantically, pacing around the baby room, holding his and Steve's almost one-year-old son in his arm. Peter, red-faced and screaming, kept crying bloody murder, big tears rolling down his cute, chubby cheeks. For some reason, whenever Tony heard Peter crying, he immediately started to tear up too, and Tony looked like an absolute mess - he was ruffled from sleep that had been brutally interrupted by the piercing cries, eyes circled and wet and shiny and a frantic, panicked look in them.
"French toasts for breakfast?" Steve asked after the kiss ended, leaving Tony a bit breathless and starry-eyed.
"Wish I could say the same about you, but there is an awfully lot of clothes on you for me to be sure," Tony breathed out. Steve wouldn't call a t-shirt and jeans a lot of clothes, but the message was well received. Their lips finally met, slow and passionate, and they stumbled together, falling on the, of course, rose petals covered bed, making them fly everywhere. Greedy fingers went into motion, peeling clothes of each other, lips wanting more and more -
Steve straightened up with a pained grimace on his face, when Peter started his crying concert again, safely nestled in his crib, but bothered for some reason. Tony curled in himself and buried face in his hands out of desperation. It seemed no one would get any sleep in this house tonight.
Thor sent Steve a calculating look, not really keen on fulfilling the unusual request. After all, he was a bouncer and a bodyguard and it seemed more of a task for Arrow who had waitress duty today. Thor was ready to refuse, politely, of course, when Steve smiled broader, that bright, sunny smile that made him resemble a labrador puppy. And Thor liked labradors.
Tony didn’t have any problems, and even if he had one, he didn’t let it show. He made Sarah laugh and joked with her, and was eager to explain every product and find the most suitable ones for her. He even let her use his discount, which was a sweet gesture.
"My little rebel," Red laughed fondly, taking a cotton pad and pouring some blue liquid on her face, starting her makeup routine. "I taught her how to walk, how to apply makeup, gave her her first cincher to hide her hog body---"
"Define 'nice'," Tony grinned, using air quotes at the second word, showing that while it was supposed to be nice, at first, he got carried away and crammed as much Valentine's day gadgets as he could fit in their bedroom just because he could, which pretty much caused his husband to suffocate, literally. Steve didn't reply, just jutted his bottom lip forward, feeling that he ruined the day. "Hey, don't make that face," Tony said softly, framing his husband's face with both hands, thumbs brushing below the jawline tenderly. "I can always reuse that stuff next year," he grinned, trying to fix the mood.
Steve was no expert on relationships. He never was in love, but he could tell that there were no warm feelings between the couple. And looking at today's encounter, there was something more happening… Something really, really bad.
“You know, not all drag queens are homosexual. Some are bi, some are hetero, some are pan, some are ace. I like to think that everyone is welcomed in the drag community, no matter if being biological female or male. Not all agree with that though.”
"Coming, coming!" Steve opened the door, seeing Bucky, holding a bottle of sparkling wine and six pack of beer.
"Rest a bit, okay?" Steve said, kissing Tony's nape lovingly, as he moved away to discard the used condom and fix the covers around them.
“A makeup artist,” Tony came up with a smooth lie, which wasn’t really a lie. “Steve helps me to restock,” Tony explained, and Steve only nodded, not finding his voice.
As a teenager, Tony was very careful. He always knew he was a bit different, equally drawn to sports cars and women fashion magazines, his eyes lingering on both women and men. Just one time he let his guard down. That evening in late Autumn, where his parents had been getting ready for the gala, and Tony watched his dad in an expensive, perfectly fitted tux, tying a Windsor knot and schooling Tony what neckties were appropriate for which occasions and Tony listened, nodding his head. Just when his mom joined them… In a flawless satin dress, one that draped over her shoulders and covered ankles in a silver cascade of material, showing silver high heels with a strap. Tony was in love. He was more drawn to the way his mom moved and the way the material twirled around her, the sound of it rustling and the shine of the lipstick, then his father’s lecture. And when they had left for the gala, Tony couldn’t control the long-suppressed urges. He sneaked into his parents’ bedroom and sat in front of his mom’s vanity mirror, carefully brushing his hands over numerous makeup supplies, looking at the brushes and feeling different consistencies of powders and creams and sticky lipsticks. Looking wasn’t enough. The first coat of ruby red lipstick on his lips was crooked and uneven, yet Tony felt gorgeous and confident. Black eyeliner made his eyes pop, mascara accentuated the long eyelashes and shimmering powder on his cheeks gave his face a whole new dimension. He got lost in the world of makeup, losing track of time and not noticing when the car drove back home, Maria Stark coming back home earlier than her husband, having to attend a morning meeting the next day. When she reached her bedroom, she saw Tony in full, sloppy makeup and wearing her pointy-toe pumps in black and the brightest smile on her son’s face. And then Tony saw her, and he couldn’t read anything from his mom’s face and the smile was immediately gone, replaced by overwhelming fear. There was no yelling, there was no crying, it was barely any emotions at all. Maria had closed the door quietly, pointed Tony to the adjoined bathroom and told him to clean his face and then come back for a talk. Tony listened, locking himself in the bathroom, the makeup disappearing quicker when mixed with tears, while Maria waited for her son to come back, still and silent. Tony didn’t know what was going on in his mom’s head, and the whole evening became a blur with time, but he remembered sinking to his knees in front of his mother, putting his head in her lap and crying and apologizing, and his mom stroking his hair delicately, forcing Tony to make a promise that this won’t repeat ever again, and with a broken heart, Tony swore and he had been breaking that promise for almost two decades. They got back to their usual lives, everyday routines, never speaking of what happened.
