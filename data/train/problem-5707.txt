He laughed again. "But that would put you back in a cell."
"Shouldn't you be resting?"
Clint narrowed his eyes. "Natasha," he said, a silent warning in his voice.
"Your friend don't seem to have a lot of faith in you."
She patted him on the shoulder before she picked up her pace. "I would've teased you either way," she said with a chuckle as she stepped toward Phillips and Peggy. They were making their way toward the center of the camp, trying to put some distance between them and the guards posted at the gate. "However, it would've been much worse."
, not after everything that has happened. The idea that she can fool around in his head on a second notice scares the shit out of him; plus, he doesn't think he can take another one of her visions. "Allow what?" he asks with bitterness in his tone.
"You went into cardiac arrest and flat-lined. You need to relax."
Toni shook her head as she tried to focus on her device so she wouldn't be shocked again.T She had lost count of the number of times she had been shocked. A part of her blamed her father, since he was the one who added a low resolution interface; however, she knew it would give her better control of the time that she would end up in.
for an unknown length of time. There were no time lines for SHIELD missions; no way to know when he was coming home. Was she going to be alone for Christmas? Again, that wasn't new to Toni, but that didn't mean she liked it. She was just used to it. "Did the government come to its senses? …Oh, wait. What am I talking about? The Government will never come to their sense. Bunches of idiots who can't agree on anything. 'Oh, look I am fire. What should I do? Use water? No! I can't agree with you, even if you're on fire. You're a—" She started to mock.
"Yea, because her mind won't stop," Bruce replied. "Her brain is always moving, always thinking." He had a weak smile on his face. "It's that brilliant mind of hers."
Toni narrowed her eyes. "Yes, as only a complete idiot wouldn't know what it is. It's the power to take private property for public use by the government following the payment of just compensation to the owner of that property," she stated, annoyed. "However, I did not get paid nor are you using my device, which you had no idea what it is, for public use. Besides it's not the same kind of property; it's not land. Eminent Domain applies to land." She so needed to get out of here with her device, but she needed to find an escape, which would be hard. Maybe when they moved her again, she would be able to escape from that cell.
Tony isn't sure when his opinion changed on Barnes, but he no longer hates him. If he really thinks about it, how could he hate someone who went through what Barnes had gone through? He went through decades of torture, which no one else can say. So how can Tony judge him? Though his torture cannot compare, he knows how it feels. He knows how it feels to know only pain. He knows how it feels to completely lose oneself and not know who you are anymore. He doesn't know why it took him so long to realize that, but now that he does, he can no longer hold it against Barnes, though that isn't to say it still doesn't hurt. Though he may not have gotten along with his father, it doesn't mean he didn't care for him, because he did—does. He does care, and it hurts.
She stood there unsure of what to say to the depressed Rogers. "I call everyone by their last name. It's my thing." She closed her eyes. There were only five people that she didn't refer to by their last names: Pepper, Rhodey (yes it was a play off on his last name, but that didn't count), Happy, Bruce and Clint (which was a recent development). Okay, there was also Thor…..but he really didn't have a last name besides Odinson, and she didn't consider that a last name. With Rogers, it was on principle that she called him by his last name.
"You have to tell someone. You can't keep it in. I can see it is bothering you."
The genius blinks a few times as the reality of the situation comes rushing back at him. It's like someone has hit a switch in his brain, and he can see. He can think. "When were you born?" he counters, his throat killing him. "W-why is it okay for a woman to ask a m-man that, but yet, a man can't ask a woman that?" His voice sounds like nails on a chalkboard, and it hurts to speak, but he can't seem to keep his sentences short. "I-isn't that a bit sexist? Are you sexist, Doctor?"
However, her silence didn't help, and in the end, she ended up alone in the tower—well, not completely. There were people in the lower levels, but they were nonexistence to her. They were just people in the distance, like the people on the streets. They were shadows as her mind got the better of her. Normally when she was like this, she went to her lab, but right now, she just needed to get away from it. She had been in her lab so often that things started to blend together, making feel worst. With so many suits, she couldn't make heads or tails of anything anymore, making countless mistakes.
...Then there was the fact that she doubted herself. Was she really going to do this? Was she really risking her life just to get home? Even after a few minutes of that negative thinking, she knew she was.
The plane was the same plane from before, and it still made her nervous to no end. Maybe, it was because she knew all the schematics and issues with these planes. Maybe, she knew the likelihood of these things being shot down from the sky. Maybe, she knew what this plane was missing in terms of technology, but whatever it was, she had to fight her flight urge to remain on-board and take a seat.
Toni kind of wished she was asleep for this part of the conversion, because she didn't want to listen to them talk about her. She hated when people discussed her like she was something needed to be fixed. She didn't need to be fixed; she didn't want to be fixed. She needed to be left alone to deal with her pain.
"You mean when you stole the Mark 2, right?" Pepper corrected, glaring. "That was a legal headache."
"Barton, you need to calm down," Natasha stated as they walked down to the labs. They both had suitcases in their hands, and each held heavy important equipment.
"No. No, I don't." It didn't take a genius to know why Salty didn't need the answer. "Against my better judgment, I'll let you go, Stark." He paused "You're going to kill me, you know that?"
She turned to the bag that she spotted earlier and took a look inside. "What? Where did these come from?" she asked. There were a few different outfits in the bag for her, and to her dismay, there was no pants. There was one pot-a-dot dress, one grey dress, two blouses and one skirt. At the bottom of the bag, was a pair of black flats.
Toni knew why he brought up Steve, as the super solder calmed her, but she didn't want him. Sure, she would always need him, but she didn't
It was around midnight, but the streets were anything but quiet. They were anything but dark. New York was a very loud city, and even at this hour, there were still hundreds of cars and trucks passing by on these streets. There were police sirens blasting, waking any sleeping person or persons, as cop cars were flying down these streets. Even the buildings were alive, as images were flashed against them. Plasma Screens plastered the skyscrapers flashes burr after burr and color after color, and these buildings were humming. They hummed as if they were live, which was what called a certain genius out even if it was unwise to go out at this hour.
*O*O*
"Miss, please calm down," a nurse came flying in.
Shaking that out of mind, she turned her attention to the small room.
However, Steve was so darn good at kissing that he was stole her breath. He stole her ability to think, and that was something she wanted. She wanted to forget all of her problems. She wanted to forget her guilt and shame, though this was much more than that. Sure, this was a happy side effect, and she had used sex for this very purpose of forgetting the past even if it was for a few hours. No, this time, it was something more, and it started with this strong feeling in her chest. It started with this deep desire in her heart for Steve and his happiness.
"Stark!"
"What would a fifty dinner look like?" he asked her. His eye brow was raised as he stared at her. "I think there would be aliens or something, right?" He laughed.
Toni took a large step back, though there wasn't anywhere she could go with her desk digging into her back. "If I want to create more super soldiers, I can," she said, giving him a smile. "Well…with Rogers' help, if you know what I mean." She winked at him, without realizing she was doing it. She hadn't no clue why her hand went to her stomach or why she even brought up, considering having children was the last thing on her mind. Her going crazy was the first thing on her mind. She must be sane before she could think about anything else—not that snort nose monsters were ever on her mind.
Toni had wondered before if her father had never paid any attention to her due to the fact that she was a woman and not a legacy that he wanted. Now, she knew that wasn't true. It was clear that she was enough for him. "Who said you were a horrible father?" she asked.
The Captain's fingers danced along the side of her arm. "Just pieces now," he said softly, holding her close. She was small in his arms, almost hidden behind his shield. He was looking around again, watching someone. "Get everything you see bagged," he ordered. "Quickly."
He gave her a long look as he stepped to the metal equipment cases of all different shapes. His fingers traced the Stark Industries logo on the top of the cases as if he was trying to memorize it. "Those names mean nothing to me, and if you agree, they will mean nothing to you as well," he said.
"You came here to speak to me about my love life, Loki? Really?" Her day was getting worse and worse, wasn't it?
The letter and journal in her hand dropped to the ground as she scooted away from the Captain. Her breathing became heavy as she leaned over, her head almost touching the ground. It looked like she was in some physical pain. "Stupid," she uttered. "So stupid."
Toni slapped back to reality at the sound of her own name. "No, I am only pretending to listen as I always do."
Her father's name froze in her mind, and she could think of nothing else. "What? Bet?" she uttered, wondering where her words went. Her arms wrapped around herself, as she tried to keep warm. Did it get colder?
He wanted nothing more than to shut Loki up. "What's the matter? Scared of a little lightning?" he asked, noticing some distance thunder. The sudden storm struck Steve as odd, but he enjoyed seeing the worried look on Loki's face. He rather enjoyed it compared to the hunger look that he spotted whenever he looked at Toni.
"Sorry. Sometimes I don't know my own strength," he stated, letting go of her as if she was burning him. "Maybe, you should rest." He was looking at her as if she was going to break.
"And have you found anything out?" Peggy asked from her spot against the door.
Snapping back to reality, Steve suddenly turned from the door and faced this three teammates. "What are you three talking about?" he asked, having not paid any attention to them.
Toni meant more to him than anyone else in the world—Buck was another story-, and she touched his heart without even trying to. So that call to Pepper hurt more than he expected, and he never wanted to make or receive that call again. Pepper, even if she didn't agree with Toni, had and will always care for her, and even if she removed herself from Toni's life-to cut the craziness and stress-, Toni would always be important to her. She would always care, and her heart would always break. This was no exception. Pepper was worried beyond belief, and Steve could hear it in her voice. And he would do anything to not hear it again, because hearing her broke his heart. Almost broke him in two.
As he undid every buckle and snap as fast as he could, he wondered if the person who designed this suit had planned this. Was their purpose to keep him in the suit and away from Toni? It was feeling like that as he finally reached the last buckle. After the armor was loosen and unzipped, he was able to lift the top half over his head and throw it to the ground. Normally, he could fold or hang it up, but at the moment, he didn't care.
She winked in pain as he pulled her to her feet. With her Jello legs, she didn't think that she would be able to stand, but Schmidt's painful grip kept her on her feet. "What would you like to show me?" she asked as she felt her legs shake.
talk about this."
In her exhaustion, his words stared to blend together, and it was getting hard to understand what he had said. His fuzzy shape started to fade into the complete darkness and the feeling of his hand started to disappear. She wasn't sure if it was because he removed his hand from her face or if she was losing feeling of her face. She was voting the latter, because she was fading quickly, and that worried her. Was she dying?
"Nothing," Barnes replies back, bitterness in his voice. His eyes are drilling into the side of Tony's head as the genius doesn't speak, doesn't move. "Because why else would he fly into that building without
Steve took a seat at the hole's edge and hanged his feet over. "I'm just worry about Toni," he said after a few seconds of silence. He was staring at his hands, unsure of what to do with them.
"Well tell me then," he replied.
Toni's eye twitched. Though she wasn't sure what Phillips told Peggy, she knew it wasn't much, that she was working on limited information. She had a reason to be harsh as Toni could be a spy for all she knew. "It was a misunderstanding," she replied. She needed to change the subject. "Can we get something to eat? I got to feed the beast."
voice, only the one rugged voice. She didn't know when she started to hear Barnes' voice, but she heard it daily. She heard it in the shower. She heard it in her lab. She heard it in her sleep. And at times, she saw the man from the corner of her eyes, almost like he had came for a visit. Or how she saw it, she was being haunted by his soul, cursing her for allowing him to die. Feeling ashamed and crazy, she kept it to herself. Who saw dead people?
"Toni will understand."
"Who's flirting now?"
"I came to see my favorite-"
The Asset's mind froze, spotting a woman jogging through the streets. As he was high up in one of the many high rises, it was amazing that he could spot this dark haired Brunette on the crowded streets, but his eyes were glued to her. He could barely make out her face from this distance, but certain feelings came flooding back to him. Even with her name escaping him, he remembered one thing: she was
"Stark had showed me the specs for her lab once, and from what I could tell, she made that lab into a fortress. Nothing would affect it," Natasha stated. "Unless you found a way."
Like someone had struck him, Steve's hand fell. "Toni," he called out, knowing her voice from anywhere. "You're here? Why are you here? Did Natasha call you?" He tried to ignore the guilt rising up inside of him at the thought of grabbing her too hard. Why was he so careless? "D-did I hurt you?" His eyes dropped to her wrist looking for some kind of mark.
Why did everyone have to bring it up? Maybe, he asked too soon. Okay, yes. He did, and maybe, he was an idiot. "I don't know what you're talking about?"
But he's angry at himself for being a damn fool. He's idiot and he knows it. He hates the idea of love and here he is, falling for two—not one, but two—guys he can't have. Again, he's an idiot and he knows it. He knows he's fucking screwed, but what's a guy supposed to do? Tony isn't sure, but he is tired of this. Tired of his emotions. Tired of how they attacked him. He isn't supposed to fall for them. He isn't a teenager with uncontrollable urges, damn it.
Steve forced a smile to his face. "I'll always be glad to see an old friend," he replied, weakly. He just wished he could see Toni again. He needed to see her again. "And who is this?" he asked the young man, after giving each of the Commandos a hand shake and a hug.
Steve glanced toward Natasha, giving her a confused look. "Dad?" he asked.
"You're willing to let them risk their home?"
The voices were getting louder, interrupting her rest. She needed to sleep, damn it. Toni groaned as these voices were giving her a headache. Why couldn't they shut it? Why was there so many voices? She just wanted to listen the one.
Romanoff eyed him before turning toward the door. With her hand on the door's handle, she glanced back at him. "We can't have you pretending to be fine, Rogers. If you can't operate, then you will need to sit out."
"I can see that," she chucked as she picked up the bag, knowing she couldn't turn it down. She would need to blend into the 1940's if she wanted to keep her secret. Plus, she would pay Rogers back, but if she really thought about it, didn't she already do that? He was living in her Stark Tower, which she had refused to call the Avenger Tower like everyone else had been. Until SHIELD started to pay the bill, Toni refused to call it anything but Stark Tower. "But you know. I like the bad guys." She showed him her winning smile.
"I l-love hearing you say my name," he said, stumbling over the word love.
"It is okay, FRIDAY," Vision says, his voice echoing. "Sergeant Barnes and Captain Rogers means no harm to Mr. Stark." He goes silent, and FRIDAY does not speak again, but Tony knows there something going on between the two.
She shocked her head and looked at him. "Sorry," she uttered with a deep sigh.
After a few seconds, Toni broke the kiss and pulled back slightly. His kiss was able to wipe her mind completely, and she couldn't help the smile that formed on her face, never thinking that Rogers would be this touchy. Seriously, who would've thought? "Geez, Rogers. Never knew you had it."
Though Toni could be a bit much with her teasing, he would rather hear it than her silence. "I already have you in bed, so…" He teased.
"That won't do this time," Barton stated.
Toni laughed with a smile. "You're perfect."
Rhodes took a deep breath and stepped toward the suit. "Yes. Let's head out."
The Brunette, whose name still escaped, slowed down as she came across the park. There was a bit hesitation in her step as she turned to the park. As she stepped toward the park, he studied her body language, wondering what had gotten her out in this time of night. It was more than just wanting to run in the night air, because he could see the weight in her step with each step. He could see the exhaustion in her step as she made a sharp turn. It took all that she had to remain on her feet. There was something on her chest.
I hope you liked the chapter. :)
*O*O*
"Toni." Peggy called again. She seemed unfazed by Toni's taunts. "You aren't thinking clearly. You need to rest."
"It's handier than you might think," The Captain responded. He glanced toward Toni, who was blowing her hair out of her face.
Without Toni realizing it, Steve had laid her the sofa and pinned her with his body. With one knee between her legs, he pressed his body against hers, though he was careful not to put his full weight on her. With a gentleness that no one would ever thought the Great Captain America was capable of, he ran his hands under her shirt, caressing the skin up and down her back. He smiled against her lips as his hands worked their way up her back. She could feel her body tremor, as his lips left her and traveled to her neck ever so slowly.
Toni, who didn't have time to brace herself, landed hard, and she couldn't recall anything besides the extreme pain. Her head smack hard against the metal computer panel and whipped forward. After the pain ended, it was just pure never ending blackness.
Her fists balled at her side as she thought about all of the pain that she had caused. It was sickening to think of how many people she could've saved, while she did nothing and allowed them to die. She had allowed Bucky to die, without even warning him. How could she do that to a supposed friend?
"Yup." She smiled. "But at least, I'm a basket of fun. Aren't you glad I'm coming with you?" She put on the biggest smile ever and she held it for a few seconds, even with the pain.
"That wasn't very nice. Someone should teach you matters."
Peggy looked her over as she took a few steps toward her with the gun still trained on her. "Keep your hands where I can see them."
Each time Steve even thought about asking, Fury sent him on a mission, barely telling him anything. He kept insisting that it wasn't important for him to know and that infuriated Steve to no end. Not only didn't that not settle his mind, it made him push harder. It made him lean harder on Fury, though he knew that man would never spill anything. That man was good at keeping secrets.
"There's a rumor he'll be at this base," he stated as he pointed to a location on the map.
"You know what this crater reminds me of?"
"However," she interrupted, "that doesn't mean jack shit." She took a deep breath. "Doesn't change anything."
"You've been asleep, Cap. For almost seventy years," said the man. He took another step toward him.
"Oh, that," she said, putting on an innocent smile. "Well, don't take my stuff." Yes, she regretted it, but she wasn't going to tell him that. That one of the lessons that her father taught her: never admit when you're wrong.
Rogers stood up and walked to her. "I got this too," he stated as he took the pan from her and put the ice pack down.
Toni caught him looking at her as if he was trying to judge her mental and physical health. She wasn't sure if he saw what he wanted but he was smiling at her. He turned to the Stalker, who hadn't gotten to his feet yet, and glared. As the stranger reached down to grab him, the Stalker rolled back and flipped out of the way. Before the stranger could react, Toni's tail bolted out of the alley.
"He probably wouldn't like that," Toni said. Sure, it was a nickname, but she wasn't sure if he would like it, not that she was trying to make him happy. She didn't care if he was. "So what are you guys up to?" she asked, glancing around.
After the first few blocks, Toni had lost track of how long she had been running for or how far she had gone, but if she had to judge by the number of people who flirted with her, she could guess that a few hours have past, that she had ran a few miles. She could feel her body protest as she pushed her body passed her limits. She was never the runner, never wanted to be, so this was a challenge. She could feel her legs tingle and her muscles contract. She had the urge to sit down and rest, but she refused to listen, refused to stop.
Shaking her head, she made her way back to her tent. They were on the move again with the SSR targeting Schmidt's hydra bases. Right now, Steve was out with the Howling Commandos taking down base number two, and it was the second time that she found herself going crazy. She wasn't sure why she was worried or why she was so invested. This was the past and what was going to happen would happen. There was no changing that. People were going to die and there was nothing that she could do to change it. It was useless to worry.
There was no way Toni would touch those pills and the Colonel knew this. If she had been poisoned and that device was blocking the poison from entering her heart, he knew she would not touch it. Was that why she didn't trust anyone? He asked himself. It didn't matter the reason why, because she wouldn't take anything from anyone.
ghost again? Toni closed her eyes, forcing herself to take a few deep breaths.
"Rogers didn't have to do that," she said looking at the clothes. He really didn't have to do it, because now, she owed him.
"Shut it." That was an insult that she didn't want to hear. "I'm not my father."
He needed that. He needed some kind of anchor, because this time period scared him—not that the tech frightened him. However, he was weary of it, weary of this time that was taking him more time than he expected to get used to. Sure, he loved the color TV that could take up an entire wall, but he hated how attached everyone was to it. People turned to technology for
Steve looked completely heartbroken with shame written all over him. He looked small—something that Toni didn't think possible of the famous Captain Rogers. His shoulders were hunched, looking like he was curled into himself. "I-it wasn't l-like that. I would never hurt Toni." He uttered, struggling to get the words out.
Steve Rogers was a great many things but he wasn't a fool in any sense of the word. He was smarted, even before the serum; however, at the moment, he doubted his intelligence. His mind kept playing tricks on him and he found himself filled worry, fear and stupidity, which he hadn't felt in a while. Missions could not keep his mind off everything that was happening, though he had to admit that he really didn't know what was happening. And that just made anything worse: the not knowing. Fury didn't tell them anything besides the fact that items were stolen from Black Hawk and they had the ability to disrupt Toni's equipment. He was being very secretive and Steve couldn't help but think that was a bad sign. He had to be hiding something… though he shouldn't find that surprising. Fury was a spy after all.
"Yep," he stated, smiling. "I want a nickname."
Taking a page out of Steve's book, Toni decided to go for a run when she couldn't force herself to sleep. The second time she tried going to sleep, it only lasted for 20 minutes before she bolted up and out of bed in a cold sweat. She was shaking so badly that she had to do something. So in the middle of the night in the cold evening air, Toni put on a pair of running shoes, pants and a hoodie. She didn't care that it was past midnight or that there were shady people out, as she just needed to get out. She needed air.
Tony can feel his chest tighten as that's too early for their morning run, but there's no other reason for his soldiers to be out of bed…unless they had a nightmare. It isn't uncommon for one of the three to have a nightmare and need to get out bed, but usually, they ended up back in bed later to cuddle with each other. This waking up alone isn't new to Tony, but he doesn't like it, not after having spent weeks with those two in his bed.
"I know! Why are people surprised at me for having children?" Gabe asked, chuckling. "I was a smart, good looking fella back in the day."
Before Toni could respond, the door to the hotel room jolted open, startling her, and before she could react or speak, two elderly men walked in. "Watch it, Trip. She's the Cap's girl," one of the older man replied.
Peggy let out a chuckle. "Slow down, Howard. She isn't even born yet."
Howard gave her a look. "That's different."
JARVIS didn't answer, annoying the genius. "Answer me. Where's Steve?!" she demanded. "Don't make me regret creating you. Or maybe, I should reprogram you into a 7 year old girl." With the Lawyer's suit jacket draped over her shoulders, she looked tiny even with her arms folded across her chest.
Howard still had not handed over the hydra core, but he told her that he would as soon as got back from wherever he went. He left to do something though he wouldn't tell her what, but he did say he would be back soon. It was annoying, but if Toni waited this long, she could wait a little bit longer.
"So no calling me Salty?" he asked as he stepped into the room.
Barnes stared at her, unsure what to make of her. "You have some energy. What do you use that for?" He winked at her, causing her to blush.
Steve's eyes snapped to her, as she covered one of her eyes with her hands. Though she was always like this, he surprised with her outburst. Sure, he understood that she had a mouth and didn't respect authority, but now, wasn't the time. That was one of the things that annoyed him about her. She never seemed to take things seriously, though he wondered if she did it to protect herself.
"You don't need to understand. You just need to comprehend that you can't tell or see her."
Rumlow, as he stared down at the ocean. Even with the emergency response team, Toni's house and the ground around it was unstable and not safe. Every few seconds, pieces of the house and cliff fell, pelting the water at the base of the cliff. Steve knew why Toni had chosen to build a house at a side of the cliff- it was breath taking-, but the Captain didn't like it. Being a soldier, all he saw was risk, and it drove him crazy. Now, he couldn't help but hate himself for that, because he was right. Toni was gon—No! He refused to believe that. Toni wasn't gone. She couldn't be.
Toni laughed softly in his chest, but she still had a death grip on his uniform, not letting go for anything. "I need my Brooklyn soldier," she said, faintly. Her voice was soft, barely audible.
"What?!" She yelled as her eyes snapped open, realizing her peace could not last. If she could glare at JARVIS, she would, as he had stepped on her peace.
Clint snorted. "You take insult to everything."
"No," he replied, sharply. He had already felt sick and uneasily about it. Sure, he understood why Natasha had kissed him, understanding the strategy behind it. One, it stopped him from going after Rumlow and demanding to know where Toni was. And two, it allowed them to escape with the drive. Whatever was on that drive was vital. However, it felt wrong, not to be focused on finding her. Toni finally said yes, and things had started to fall into place.
Rhodes' grip tightens on Tony as if he's afraid that Tony is seconds away from bolting. "Why don't we just watch this movie?" he says with a sigh.
He turned back to her. "I will try," he stated with a sigh.
Toni glared at him as she shoved him hard, and in his shock, she was able to dash by him. "I'm fine," she yelled as she ran out of the room. To her luck, she wasn't wearing a hospital grown, but she wasn't wearing any shoes. However, she wasn't going to let that stop her. She needed to get out of here, and Salty calling her name wasn't going to stop.
However, when he wakes up the next morning, he finds himself completely alone in his huge bed, which is far too large for just him. At first, he thinks his men just left to get something, but both sides of the bed are cold, a clear sign that he has been alone for some time, and even if he tells himself not to, he worries. His insecurities are flooding back, and there's nothing he can do to stop them. "How long have they been gone?" he asks his AI, hoping they're just on their early morning run.
It felt like someone had knocked the air out of her lungs. It was how she felt when she had made weapons for the military. It was one of the reasons why she stopped making weapons after she was tortured. She had seen what her weapons had done. "You didn't pull the trigger," she replied, knowing it wouldn't help. But it was what she had been told.
"Mommy didn't go far," Toni answered. She sighed, knowing she better get this reunion over with because the longer she waited the worst it would be. "Take me to my subjects."
*O*O*
Toni, silently thanking Steve, crossed to him and patted him on the shoulder. "I was on my way to see Colonel Salty."
The Archer let out a chuckle. "Oh, I tried, but Rogers wouldn't let me! He's a joy sucker. So gloomy."
"Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you?" Banner said, drawing his Steve's attention.
"Ah," Toni uttered. There were parts of her that wanted to spoil the ending for Peggy, but she wouldn't play that card. She didn't need or want to play that card. Why in the hell would she want Rogers?
Rumlow glanced back, sharing a long look with his buddy next to him. It was unnerving to say the least. "Well, you're probably the prettiest guard I have ever seen, but I'm here on business." His smile grew once more, almost painful.
I know. I know. I know. I'm horrible at updating. In my defense, I'm presenting you with a monster of a chapter, so I hope that makes it up for you. 13,500 words monster.
"I thought you died days ago, Stark," Barton states as he closes the refrigerator's door. "You seem like it."
"Of course, I don't think there was ever a time you weren't," the same elderly said with a smile.
Phillips took a deep breath as he rubbed his forehead. "You're still not going out."
New York anymore. This city was a dangerous at night.
With the biggest smile that Gary could muster, he exclaimed, "I knew you were still alive! Does Captain America know?! He must know! Is he around here something?" He asked, as he went to look out the van.
"Steve," she uttered. "I'm sorry. I mean it. It's… just…I don't…" She drifted off.
"He thought what he was doing was correct," Howard said, fighting every urge to reach out to her.
Wilson laughs. "No, they love us. They just have a date tonight, which is why we aren't staring at Barnes begging for food."
"You should watch what you say," Agent Carter warned as she walked out of the room. "And the exit is this way." She turned to the left and waved Toni to follow her.
"Are you okay, Miss?" JARVIS asked as the three men stepped onto the elevator.
"You need to find her mother first," Peggy replied, giving him a look.
She jumped at the voice. "What the hell?!" she yelled as she turned to Dugan, who was standing over her.
The only thing Toni could think about was the whiskey in her bedroom. It was a 100 year old whiskey that she hid so no one would find it. She was saving it for a time when she wanted to forget everything, and after becoming Iron Man, she never thought she would need it, but now, she wanted it. She wanted to drink and never remember the pain. She wanted to forget everything. She wanted to forget the hollow feeling inside of her, the feeling that she would be completely alone for it was the punishment that she needed. Not even Pepper or Rhodey could relief her of that pain.
"Let's see them," Toni stated as she turned back to Gabel and the game. "Maybe, if you win, I might call you by your first name." She winked at him.
he thinks, as he wishes for ice or something.
He lowered Toni's legs and slid the towel up. His thumps ran up the entirely of her legs as he dried her smooth skin. There were a few scares covering her pale skin, but it didn't subtract from her beauty. It just made her worth so much more. It made this worth all that more.
Tony has been flying for hours, soaring until the sun pops up, when he gets the alert to assemble, and he's lying if he says he didn't react. For a few seconds, he fights with himself, wondering if he should stay back. With Captain America, Winter Soldier, Black Widow, Vision, Falcon, War Machine, Scarlet Witch and Ant-Man, he knows he isn't needed, and there's nothing that they can't handle. With the team they have now, no one can defeat them, and they would be a fool if they try. If Tony's a supervillain, he would be pissing his pants, because he knows how deadly Barnes and Rogers are together. He knows how much damage those two can do alone. He
Her eye started to twitch again, as she took a step back, trying to put some distance between them. "Just me? I can't be the only one you men want," she stated.
Steve held her tighter, realizing what this was all about. Even if it was quite a number of years ago for him, he remembered everything that she said when she had learned Bucky had died. He remembered how she called herself a horrible, shitty friend, and now, he realized why. "Toni."
"Deal with it," Clint says, taking a seat next to Wanda and Natasha, who don't waste time resting her head against him.
"Toni…" He hated when she did this.
"You've been a naughty boy," Rumlow stated. "You went against Hydra when you supported that bill."
Don't worry, shouldn't take me too long for me to get the next chapter out. :) Maybe, the more reviews I get the faster I get the next chapter out. So hit that review button! Really, hit it!
However, it was at that moment that Natasha and Clint stepped into the room. With hand on Natasha's shoulder to guide him, the Archer covered his eyes with the other. "Is it clear? Are they dressed?"
The Asset followed the Brunette, keeping track of everywhere he went. He watched her at every movement, reporting every move and thing that she made. He, however, did not report the itch that he got whenever he saw the brunette with the beefy Blonde, and he definitely didn't report the urge to strange the man whenever he touched the woman. Again, the Asset had no idea why he felt like this, considering he had no idea of who the woman was. He had never seen this woman —not that he remembered—before this assignment, but yet, there was this feeling in his chest. A feeling he didn't understand.
Frustration growing, Barton, a master spy, didn't know where exactly Rollins was, but he knew in which direction the man was heading before his signal went offline. He knew Rollins was heading out of town and on which road the traitor was taken, but if the man had taken any side roads on that road, that could put some real distance between the two. However, it shouldn't take long for Clint to pick up the trail, but no one was perfect. No matter what you did, you left tracks. Plus, Rollins was a meat head working with limited smarts, while Clint eat this shit for breakfast, lunch and dinner. He hunted for fun and this was a hunt with no escape. By the end of this, Rollins was going to be dead and his head was going to be Clint's prize.
These voices annoyed the Asset as he wanted nothing more than to shot his brains out. He should tell Rumlow about these voices, but he knew what they would do. It was the most logical course of action. They would put him in the chair, which only brought pain. He didn't need that as he could still function. At the moment, his success rate was still 100 at the moment even with the mystery voices in his head. He could still function. The Soldier knew Rumlow found this behavior strange, even though his focus on the Senator.
Steve smiled softly at her as he wrapped his arm around her and pulled her back to him. She didn't fight him again and allowed herself to pull into his arms. "If we're playing the blame game, I beat you. You were unconscious, laying in a hospital bed. How could you do anything?" he asked. "I was the one that was there, that could've stop it. I was the one he was trying to protect."
"It was a bet you see. Back when my law firm was just Pearson Litt, Howard Stark came to us and asked us to deliver a package to you on this date at this place," the Lawyer stated with a smile.
Looking away from the Captain, Rhodes glanced down at the genius in his arms and his expression soften at the sight of her. He loosened his hold on her but kept her close. "Sorry, Tones, but I've been so worried," he said, tenderly. "Though, I have a bone to pick with you. You revoked my access to the Mark 7, while in combat, Toni."
"I was in serious trouble the day I was born," Toni stated, remembering the story that her mother had told her. A nurse had tried to steal her from the hospital the day she was born; her father's security had stopped her before the nurse could step out of the building. That wasn't the only kidnapping attempt Toni faced when she was a child. "This is nothing new for me."
"If this is what having a child is like, I'm glad I didn't have any," he replied.
She didn't have time to catch her breath as he pulled her back to her feet. "Look at my power," he ordered as he made her look at the glowing weapons that Zola had designed. As his hydra soldiers were creating even more weapons, she wondered how anyone could last against him. How did Rogers beat this man again? "Are you doubting your choice?"
Toni kicked the blankets off her and swung her feet off the bed. "Wait, why am I in a bed?" She remembered leaving the apartment, while Barnes and Rogers argued over her. Usually, she didn't mind when men fought over her, but she didn't like that
"Oh, so that's the only thing stopping you?" she asked. "Or don't you find me attractive?" She wasn't an idiot, and she knew full well that he found her hot. And who wouldn't? Yes, she was quite full of herself, but she had no doubt that this man found her completely sexy. She had no doubt she was in many wet dreams.
Toni wanted to protest but keeping her eyes open took all of her strength and she started to drift again.
"I hear you talk about me to them." Her mind was a dangerous place, and he did not need in.
"Let's leave her be," Phillips said, grabbing Toni's arm lightly. "There're a few things to wrap up here."
As if she was nothing—not that she could fire at full strength-, the man deflected the shot with is metal had. "Ты не сделаешь мне больно." He hissed, sounding like he was yelling at her, but his voice didn't rise at all. "И я не сделаю тебе больно"
"I can't help it. I have a teammate missing and there isn't anything I can do." He stopped and looked to Bruce, who was building something. "Have you heard from Barton and Romanoff yet?"
"I thought Thor sent you back to help me. Why must I promise anything to you?" she snapped. She wouldn't give this murderer anything besides a bullet to the head.
"Okay, Cowboy, lets head in before they're anymore antsy," she said, laughing at him. She pulled out of his arms completely as she turned to the door.
In the middle of the camp stood a flag pole, and even if the camp was empty, the flag was flying high. Not far from the pole, a dirt line was drawn into the ground in a circle pattern. In the middle of it, Toni's device laid opened with loose wires not yet connected traveling away to a machine shaped like a podium, where Howard was working. Around him were cases of different shapes and sizes, and each were opened as her father worked from all of them. He was silent, focused.
If the situation wasn't serious, Pepper would've chuckled at Steve's snappy reaction; however, something that Bruce said had her worried about Toni. "What happened to Toni? Where is she?"
For the last three hours, Toni had been pulling at the handcuffs to the point that her wrist was bleeding, but she didn't stop. She kept pulling, knowing this was her chance to escape. If they had been watching her, they would've come running. You know you're being stupid, right? She told herself. Even if she was able to escape the room, there was no way she could make it out without anyone noticing. She was being held by the military not by some Joe. Sure they weren't as advanced as they were in her time, but they still weren't a force to be messed with. However, Toni loved to take stupid risks, and she didn't care if it got her in trouble. She didn't care if it put her in hot water with her team or not. She didn't care if she got yelled at by Rogers. It just meant she did her job.
"That's frozen! What do you want me to do with raw chicken?" the archer asks as if that the dumbest thing ever.
"Not scared are you?" he asked, stepping every closer.
There was no window besides the police style window, which made it hard to tell how much time had passed. There was a chair in the corner of the room, and it didn't appear to be bolted like hers, which wasn't fair. Why does the interviewer get the free chair? "Hello," she yelled, getting annoyed at the silence. She had enough of it; she wanted to talk to someone and make them cry, which was her specialty. She was known for getting under people's skin; just ask her team. She had gotten into fights with the other Avengers over her mouth. "Did you forget about me?"
him die.
Before seeing her that raw, he had all the intention of killing her, which would have angered his handler though he didn't care. Sure, killing a target that he wasn't permitted to would put him in the chair, and the Asset would do anything to avoid the chair, but he would do anything to rid himself of this disease, which was what these emotions were. They were a disease, but after disarming her security system somewhat—not completely as she would notice—and going in to kill her, the Asset froze on sight of her. His body didn't listen to his commands and refused to move, which was something he could and would never understand. He still couldn't understand why she made him feel like this.
Toni froze for a second, taking a few minutes to realize what the hell he was talking about. Usually, she only half listened whenever someone talked, and now, was no different. Most of the times, she acted cool and played it off, like the awesome person she was. But, there was more to his comment then her half listening, and when she realized what he meant, it took everything she had not to laugh. She forgot she had given him the idea that she was pregnant with Steve's kid, not that she understood how he even got the idea. However, she still couldn't believe that he believed that. Killian had the creepy scientist vibe…well, the creepy vibe in general, but how completely stupid he could he be? How did he not know she was lying? Maybe, the blonde dye had gone to his head.
The little Captain lowered himself down to her. "I…I have always been this size," he stated, unsure of himself.
She smiled into his neck. "Just admit you like it," she teased as she placed her hands on his chest.
Glancing back, Toni held back her scowl as Pepper smiled at her. Note to self, replace glass doors with metal ones. She had no idea why she thought glass doors were a smart idea, because it made it exceptionally hard to hide. "I'm surprise she doesn't just use the code." Pepper was one of the few people, who had code for the door.
"Thanks," Barnes said as he dragged Rogers off into one of the bedroom and closed the door.
Jones laughed. "She's his nurse, and I think she can handle him."
"What we should do with the woman."
She narrowed her eyes at him. "Are you flirting with me, Mr. Barnes?" she teased with a wink. If he wanted to play the flirting game with her, she would, and she would have him crying mercy.
After they restrained him and a few additional, long, painful treatments, he returned to the field, killing even more targets, and for a while, he had forgotten about her. She didn't plague his mind for god knows how long, but while returning to the base after a kill, he froze, eyeing a news article. It was about that unknown woman. For a few long minutes, he stared at the image of her as all his desires came flooding back, and it took all that he had not to hunt her down. It would be easy now, because he had a name. He knew who she was. She was Toni Stark, and she was
Pepper stared at Natasha before slamming her fists on the door. "JARVIS, let us in!" Before she could hit the cold metal again, Steve stopped her. She glanced at him from the corner of her eye, ignoring the stinging in her hand. "Let us in!" she ordered, pulling her hand away from Steve.
"Are you sure?" he asked, inching his hand closer to her.
in New York. She had come to learn that she hated that. Though, it probably also has to do with the fact that the voice was worse when she was alone. "Damn straight. And we can talk about the body later."
Toni eyed Peggy as she inched her way toward Rogers. Why in the hell was she trying to comfort him? He was being a total dick. He didn't need that. "Skully got lucky before," she muttered. Besides, she knew they were going to be caught, but she couldn't tell them that.
That did not to curb Barton's anger. "What do you call that?" He hissed, glaring at the broken lamp.
"You could tell me this sooner?" Toni asked.
Barnes gave him a smile. "No, I would just invite her to my bed. She's easy on the eyes." He was smirked with a chuckle.
"Doesn't matter. He needed to be taught a lesson," he answered, proud of himself. "No one should talk to a lady like that. And imagine what Steve would have done if he heard."
"Why do you care if she does?" the Captain asked. "What does it matter what I feel? Maybe, that's why Erskine thought I was special."
"Yea," she uttered, still feeling odd. Though she would blame it on the temperature, she was shaking. "I'm good."
Needing some breathing room, she side stepped away. "How is not important," she replied, not having any interest in explaining what she was planning. "However, I do need the core back as well."
to find her, even if it went against everything that his handler taught him.
Toni grabbed the gun from her belt, and training it on the tail, she slowly made her away toward him without taking her eyes off him. When she got within a foot of him, she struck him hard in the back, causing the man to stumble forward and fall on his hands. He tried to stand, but Toni didn't gave him the chance and hit the side of his face with the gun, sending him back to the ground. "Who are you?" she demanded as pointed the gun at his upper back.
However, it didn't seem like that was possible with Rumlow yelling in his ear. He was yelling commands, ordering him to leave. Both Rumlow and Rollins had come across the bloody body of the man he had killed, and they were not happy. He knew he would be punished, but he didn't want to leave her, not with that look in her eyes. He wanted to stay with her.
Rotating in the chair, Toni turned her attention back to the device, which she still hadn't named yet. She wanted to wait until she got it working before she named it. "I'll take it down here."
*O*O*
Taking a deep breath, S
After drying off and wrapping the towel around his waist, he stepped toward the mirror and stared at his reflection. Even with the shower, he looked like a puppy looking for a home, and he hated that. Why was he like this? Why was he so useless? All he could do is bust down doors, while everyone else did the important things. They were the one collecting information and using it to bring Toni back.
"We met before outside the theater. You were with that Rogers guy," he stated. He sounded bitter. "I still have no idea why they choose him for the project but I guess it doesn't matter now. He's just a poster boy." He waved a comic in her face. Even though she couldn't get a good look at it, she knew it was a Captain America comic.
Steve hated when she got like this, so negative and insecure, but he supposed it was his fault for leaving her alone for so long. "Trust me, there isn't," he said, putting on smile. His eyes wandered up her form again, stopping at the dog tags which laid over her shirt. As she usually had them hidden under her shirt and close to her heart, he could guess that she had been recently holding them.
*O*O*
Natasha adds.
"He just wanted to make sure that someone was here to meet you when you returned, and he wanted to make you didn't overwork yourself. He knew you would try to do too much too soon. He had strict list of things he didn't want you to try. Sure, he wanted it to be him to meet you to calm you down, but…" Dugan trailed off.
"What condition?!" Ton snapped, tired of this game.
"Miss Stark has connected the device to an Arc reactor," Jarvis answered. "However, the device drained the reactor and fried all of the circuits, making it impossible to repair."
Toni found herself staring at a big white sign for a countless amount of time. She didn't know how long she was staring at the sign, but it felt like it was a while. She felt the passing of time as the sun changed location in the sky.
Steve stared at her for a few seconds, searching for something to say. "And you have to realize something as well. In order for this to work, you need to lean on me. I'm here for you. Use me, Toni. Use me."
The words 'Poker Game' rang in her head, and she thought back to every single game she had played. There was only one that popped into her head. "Dugan, Jones, is that you? Geez, you two looked horrible. Time didn't do you two any favors."
"Toni's changing things?"
"I expect everything," Toni replied. "Genius you know." She sat up, allowing the blanket to fall from her. "And grab me some pants or something." She had nothing under these shorts, thanks to a certain Super Soldier who just put shorts on her. It was weird, and she would use this as a remainder to never let Steve dress her again...Wait, maybe she should.
This may be fun and cheery, but it was also bittersweet. Toni was not Maria and Howard was not walking through that door no matter how much she wanted him to. However, there was nothing wrong with staying in this moment for a little bit longer, right?
Interrupting again, Howard stepped forward. "I think Colonel Phillips is getting annoyed," he said as he nodded toward Phillips who was still staring at them. "I do think it is time."
"Rogers," Clint replied, stepping toward the bulky Cap.
going to happen again. Though, it wasn't every day that SHIELD was taken over and Toni had no access to her suit.
I also hope that Loki doesn't seem too OOC. This is why I avoided Thor so far in the story.
Though Steve knew he shouldn't take her insults personally, they hurt. "Stop with the insults," he said, almost snapping. It was so hard to remain calm with her, when she did this. "Why don't you just say what's on your mind?"
? Why did it matter to them if Toni didn't come to D.C.? He didn't blame her, not when he didn't want to be here. He preferred New York himself. But again, why this was so important? Steve didn't wait for another word before he headed to the closest door. He wanted to get out of here before he said or did something that he would regret. There was an insult on the tip of his tongue that was dying to come out.
"Why don't you let me do it?"
"We're already putting together the best men," Phillips answered as he stepped to the side to allow Toni a better view. He eyed her as if she was able to fall over.
"Just fix it," Toni replied, unable to keep her anger in check.
"Miss."
The End for now! I hoped you enjoyed this chapter. Sorry No Rogers this time, but he shall be back in the next.
His hand dropped to his side, as he took a step back. His eyes narrowed as she refused his help and used the wall for support. For a few seconds, he watched her slowly get the feeling back in her legs. "I was hoping to speak with Pepper."
"I have a feeling you won't let her go," Bucky said, knowingly.
"We've been looking for you," Howard said, his hand still on her shoulder.
"I think I can hear your brain from over here," Sharon spoke, turning to her cabinets.
Steve's eyes soften as he stared at her. "Hey," he said, softly. "It's okay."
"You didn't want to talk about it and I can see that. I don't know what it is, but I know it can't be good." Barnes took a deep breath. "And I know Steve. He wouldn't have dropped it if you didn't tell him something." He ran his hand through his hair. "He can be so annoying sometimes. Sometimes, I just want to…" He drifted off.
"That sounds cool," she said, trying to start up a conversion. She could only take so much silence. "Can I see some of your work?" She had never seen Rogers' work as he was very guarded with it. She had asked a few times, which only resulted in him glaring at her and asking why she even cared.
When the town car arrived at the Tower, Pepper didn't waste a second before she dashed in. Her heels clicked loudly against the floor as she rushed through the lobby. The first place Pepper headed was the labs, knowing that it would be the first place that Toni would be. However, just like searching for something and not finding it, Toni wasn't in the first place she looked, and Pepper's irritation was growing.
Natasha picked up a book. "You're an idiot. You scared her away earlier, when she had come out to eat, which is something that she needs, and now you have her locked in her lab." She stared at a few pages before putting it back down.
"Careful, Bird Brain. That's my trademark," Toni said, giving him a look before looking back to her bleeding finger.
"I do." Rhodes said. "This could help Toni, though I'm not going to enjoy the ass chewing that I'm going to get from her when she get back." His tone changed slightly whenever he spoke about Toni. It always changed when he talked about her. It was clear that Toni was important to him.
Toni leaned in to Steve, resting her head on his shoulder. She didn't say anything at first, as she listened to the narrator. Listening to the story, she couldn't look away. The two best friends had such large smiles as they teased the others. It was clear that they both had heart of golds. "Thanks for being me here. It helped," she said.
Toni took a deep breath and let him take it. She did her best to ignore the feeling of his hand on hers. Once she was sure he had it, she let it go and hopped off the couch. It was then that she realized how close she was to him. Turning away from him, she hid her face as she didn't want him to see her red face. She didn't want Steve Roger to know that he did this to her. "I got the kitchen," she stated, changing the subject.
There was something in her voice that Steve couldn't read, but he didn't like it. Sure, Toni and Natasha got along for the most part—better if Toni didn't push Natasha's buttons for fun, but the spy wasn't so sure of the relationship between Toni and Steve, which annoyed him. Sure, Toni didn't have the best track record with relationships, and she was terrified of commitment, but this was different. It felt different. "Yes," he said, smoothly, as he slowly got to his feet.
Toni snorted. "I did, but he was useless." She only saw a doctor because of Barnes and the stink eye that Rogers had been giving her; however, he was useless, only giving her pain pills.
Toni, after wrapping her hand, returned to her work. The wrench hurt as she held it in her burnt hand, but she wanted to work on the device, which could fit in her small hands, in front of her. The device, when operational, should be able to shut down all electronics within a 10 foot range. If it worked, she would increase the range to 25 feet or more, but she couldn't get it to work right. It fried electronics and reverse, which she couldn't understand how, the time on her clock by 15 minutes each time it fuzzed. That wasn't what she wanted.
No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go," Maya said with a grin on her face.
"Not long," he said making his way over to Steve. "I think I might make me a sandwich as well." The meat, lettuce, bread, and tomatoes were still on the counter.
Steve made a face as he let out a deep sigh. "It isn't a good fit, but yes, that's one reason. I want to be with you."
"Oh, yes, she is," Dugan replied. "I almost feel sorry for Steve. He doesn't know what he's getting himself into it."
"My voice-" Loki started but was unable to finish as the door to the lab opened silencing him. Out of habit, Toni's heartbeat raced as she glanced up, expecting Madame Hydra to walk through the door. Yes, she knew it was highly unlikely and it couldn't be her, but she couldn't help it. Her stalker was also still out there and there was no doubt that they were still after her to give her to Loki, who was right there. This could all be a trick to get her where he wanted.
She could feel the Captain's breath. "The man you knew maybe, but he isn't the man I knew." She looked down, not wanting to see his eyes. Toni didn't want to speak to him, but somehow he had gotten her to come out of her lab, when she didn't want out. She didn't want to think about what that meant. "Please just leave me alone. I don't want to talk about him with you, especially you."
Steve's hands balled at his side, because he knew exactly what he was going to do, and he didn't care what Fury or anyone said. "I-"
"Whatever you say," Steve said, chuckling. Here he was only in his shorts and she was complaining about his socks.
"Toni?" Harley called out. His softness leaked through his tones, though his fear also leaked through as well. It was clear this boy was in over his head. "Are you having another attack? I didn't even mention New York."
"Why doesn't it?" Pepper asked.
giving me that puppy dog look, which…" She drifted off, as a realization dawned on her. She glared at him. "I'm screwed! He could get Satan to give in those pretty blue eyes. Damn it."
He wasn't an idiot. He noticed that she hadn't told him she loved him. At first, he didn't notice. He didn't think any of it; he could see how she felt. However, he couldn't help but notice now, especially after the proposal. He didn't want to, but he couldn't help it. "Stop it," he yelled himself as he pushed the door open…
Peggy stepped to the table toward the Captain. "No one has forgetting anything."
The Doctor reached into his bag and pulled out a gauze and medical type. "Hold still." Finding some burn cream, he applied it to her skin before wrapping her arm in the white gauze. After making sure it was typed properly, he let go of her arm, stood, and headed to the door. "Just keep it dry for a few days."
She asked herself. It shouldn't matter to her what they were doing, because once she was back in the future, none of this would matter. It wouldn't matter what they said or did, or whether they making out. None of it would matter, so why did she care? She shouldn't care. She really shouldn't.
He looked at her. "I never got to debrief you on what happened."
She thought, not liking being ordered around. However, she didn't have it in her to fight. Everything was finally catching up with her, and she just wanted to sleep, to really sleep. She wanted/needed to get that man out of her head, wanted his words to just stop.
unlikely that Toni would have visited more.
She snorted. "Like that's ever going to happen. You don't know me very well, Rogers."
"Two weeks and no," he answered eyeing her. He took the toothbrush out of his mouth and held it in his hand
"Please don't," he chuckled. "Though I need to warn you, I wouldn't consider those cores stable at all. I suggest putting on protection gear." He set a few items of protective clothing onto the table in front of her.
Toni could feel her heart beat against her chest, as Gary's excitement grew. "Keep it down," she demanded, worried that someone would hear him and notice her. "SSSHH," she hissed.
Toni's eye was still twitching. "I can take care of myself," she replied. She had heard of military women getting harassed in her time, but she could imagine that it was worse now. It scared her a bit to think about it; however, she wasn't going to let it get to her. Men were like dogs; if they smelled fear, they would attack.
Steve had to pull the speaker away from his ear, as Jim's shrieking was painfully loud. "What happened?" he asked, trying to keep his cool. Yelling back at Rhodes would do nothing but make this situation worse; besides, he was a soldier. He could handle being yelled it; in fact, it was a normal for his line of work. However, there was something different about it when Toni was involved.
"You wouldn't mind me asking what's up," Barnes asked as he stopped at a turn. He glanced back at her before gradually looking round a corner. Seeing no one coming, he waved her on.
With a deep breath, Tony rotates in his chair to face the smiling Rogers. He can feel the tingle in his chest as he faces Steve. "What can I do for you, Cap? Make it fast. Have to get this completed for Pepper," he says. He is lying, but the Captain does not need to know that.
"Again in this?" Clint uttered out, sitting up. His eyes were glued to the window.
Both Barton and Rhodes' eyes widened. "W-what? Why?" Rhodes said, stumbling over his words.
"Stop playing innocent, Sark," Peggy stated as she returned. "It doesn't suit you."
:) I wasn't going to add Past Steve into this chapter but I decided to do so at the last secon
She felt the tears flow as she thought about Bucky and her last moments with him. He had promised her that he would come back to her, so why hadn't he? It wasn't fair that he kissed her and left her confused. It wasn't freaking fair. How dare he do that? Why was she blaming him? It wasn't his fault. If he could have, he would've came back to her.
Hesitating, Steve leaned over and placed a supportive hand on her back. "Talk to me. Tell me what's going on."
He took a deep breath. "As you are here, I believe you have failed. Please, just cooperate. It would make things simpler." Colonel Salt stood up and stepped to the glass window. He stared through it as if he could see the person on the other side. "If you aren't a spy, what are you trying to hide?"
"Toni," he uttered, looking back into her eyes. His fingers dropped to her arms, gently caressing her skin. Even though he taken off her wet hoodie, she was still wet. "I just-"
"I have ways to kill you without anyone knowing. I just don't want to waste them." Toni waved the wrench at him.
Sharon let out a chucking smile as she takes a seat next to Toni. "I can agree with that."
be a stalker. Having dealt with craze fans, that was the last thing she wanted for her Captain, and she would do whatever it took to keep that insanity from him…though was it too late? She was the reason why he overreacted when he thought there was a zealous fan in his bed. Taking a deep breath, she focused back on the two and their conversion.
She took a deep breath as she turned to the other stone. "Hey, mom. Hadn't forgotten about you either," she replied soft and lovingly. Not moved from her father's final resting place, she smiled at her mother's grave. She missed her mother dearly, wishing that she could speak to her. Being wise beyond belief, Maria knew how to fix everything, and she would know what to do with Rogers. She would know how to fix this.
With a deep breath, she forced the scream down her throat as she attempted to get out of the car. Yes, attempted. Her body was barely listening to her. It felt like she was trying to move an elephant who weighted a ton. Granted, the seat belt wasn't helping either. The buckle was completely destroyed, making it impossible to unclick. For a second, she wished she had the foresight to unbuckle before almost killing herself, but that only last a second when she noticed the shattered windshield. There was no doubt that she would have flew out of car and died by a tree branch through the heart if she. She doubted that was as fun as it sounded.
"You have faith in these Americans," he stated.
"Shrimp? Did she call you a shrimp?"
"I-" he started, but Toni interrupted him.
"Well, I do like your accent better," Toni teased. "So much better than theirs." She leaned toward him with another glass of whiskey in her hand. "I'm a sucker for accents."
"For not shutting down the possibility of having children. Sure in our line of work, it's risky and probably won't happen, but it's nice just to think about it. To know it is possible," he said softly, staring deeply into her eyes
she yelled at herself.
With a laugher, Sam Wilson groaned, "Okay, get a room." Acting like child, he covered his eyes. "Shit! Why don't I have camera? I would get a pretty penny for a picture. The media will eat it up."
Though she liked Peggy, it worried her. "Is that a good idea, Salty?" His eye twitched at the name. "I did almost shoot her the last time we met."
Toni's hand balled and her nails dug into her skin. She wasn't playing anyone, though there was a time in her life that she did.
The man eyed her, studying the wobble in her step. "Brock." He said placing a helping hand on her shoulder.
The man's eyes snapped open, ready for a fight. "You know!" he said, loudly. "I would-Oh, crap. It's Toni Stark."
"Bucky." She touched her chapped, cracked lips in shock. She could feel a drop of blood on her lip.
Toni shook her head, as she tried to clear her mind. After a few deep breaths, she turned to Rogers, who seem to be glaring at something and it wasn't her. What was he glaring at? It couldn't be Barnes, could it? Was he glaring at the hand of the knee? Was he confused by the hand on the knee as well?
Bruce tried to hold back his smile as he eyed Fury and Hill. "At least, Steve won't be so gloomy."
He looked at her. "I doubt an engineer can win a fight against a trained solder."
"I must contest that, Miss. Do I need to make a list for you?"
"Only for you," he replied, pressing his lips against her. It was simple at first, a quick kiss to her lips, but he didn't let her to step away, as he tilted his head down, resting his forehead against hers. His thumb spiraled around, caressing her jaw. "I won't hurt you. I promise."
"Don't worry, Cap. You'll see Stark soon," Rumlow said from the back of the quinjet. He was nose deep in the mission debriefs, barely looking anywhere else, but there was a small grin on his face. His STRIKE team sat next to him with only a few words here or there from Rollins. "And I'm sure you'll make all the newspapers happy with your reunion."
She hated heels. "Where did these come from?"
If it was odd to hear that from Rumlow's mouth, the Asset did not comment. "Very well," he replied.
She took a deep breath as she made her way to her tent. She had a few things to pack before they were off for another location. This time they were heading to a base, near some large city. Toni couldn't say which city as Phillips didn't tell her, just telling her to pack. It was annoying how he ordered her around, but she supposed that he was doing his job. He was the Colonel and all.
make Barton cry?" he asked, sticking his hand in the bowl.
Before Toni could finish her sentence, one of Rollins's hand left the steering wheel and belted her, belted her hard. "Enough!" he roared.
"Transport?" she asked, catching the word. Why would he use the word transport? Did he know what it did? But there was no way that he could know the truth, and even if there were clues, no one would believe it. "And you found the Tesseract? Where is it?" She knew the danger of the cube and what would become of it if it stayed in the SSR's hands. However, she couldn't do anything about that either.
"Miss Stark, the others had inquired about your location," JARVIS replied with instead. "I think it would be wise to go back to the Tower."
(See the end of the chapter for
"We have to make it look like nothing's wrong," said Barton.
Tony winks in pain as the pain meds have completely worn off, which is the last thing that he wants. He doesn't want to be around them when he's like this. He doesn't want to be a mess in front of them. "Don't worry. You two don't need to be concerned about me anymore," he says softly, as he reaches for the door.
"You know what?" he said. "Let's get you home before you try something else against me."
"Nothing," he stated as he walked closely to her.
Steve, it's me." She paused for a second, resting her head against the cold glass. Feeling ill, she was struggling. "I don't k-know if you'll get this, not with your c-computer skills, but S…Steve… " She paused again. "I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time, so I hope your fossil butt is getting this. Can you even work the buttons to log in?" She stopped again, annoyed at herself. Even now, she was throwing out the banter. "F-first off, I'm sorry that I'm stupid and reckless and stupid. I'm sorry that I put you in harm's way again. Steve, that was selfish and… and it w-won't happen again… W-who am I kidding?" She felt her heart stopped, because she knew she couldn't promise that. She couldn't stop herself, no matter how hard she tried. It was like her DNA was against her.
Toni glanced at him before turning back to the window. "I was going to leave but I had nowhere to go, and it was cold. I was too chicken to face the snow." Her voice was quiet and it was hard to hear her.
The End for now.
*O*O*
Knowing what he felt for the woman, the Asset could understand the urge to go after the Brunette-as she was his. No, that didn't make sense. How was she his? Sure, she caused a flop in his chest, and he had an uncontrollable, incomprehensible urge to protect her, but he had no right to claim her as his own. He was the Asset, and he did not have things. He was not allowed to have things, but yet, these things in his chest made him want to claim her. But what? Why did he want her? What purpose would she serve? What kind of service could she provide for him? How could she help him be a better Asset? He wasn't sure, but he also didn't know if he cared or not.
"What? That look at them." She waved at the window, as she looked up at Steve, who had a smile plastered across his face. He really had a pretty face. A smile to die for. "I s-" Cutting off the genius, the Captain placed a firm kiss to her lips. With his free hand, he gently placed a finger under her chin, lifting her head up ever so slightly. There was this hunger in his kiss, as it seemed like he was trying to tell her so many things in one kiss. It was almost overwhelming.
Toni wanted to say something snappy, but she thought better of it. The nurse, who looked stupid in her uniform, was correct: she needed to rest. "Okay."
"So where's Stark?"
"Are you sure?" Barnes responded, with a smirk.
"He's an idiot you know. He refused to listen and just let himself to die, not listening to my warning. How dare he do that to me?" she asked, not expecting an answer. "After everything, after hating him for years, I really started to like him,
Toni stuck her tongue at him. "Well everything is an offensive," she said. "Just look at that color on you." She waved at the purple outfit that Clint was wearing. She could never understand the purple, especially since he was a goddamn spy. Spies weren't supposed to be colorful.
Holding up her hair, Toni could feel his cold hand on her back and his hot breath on her neck. "All good?" she asked as she felt him go all the way up. He was getting her hot again.
"But I might hurt you." It was raw as it came out. Toni wasn't afraid of him hurting her. She was afraid of hurting him.
He had studied the hole and watched the security footage. He was shock at first that JARVIS even allowed it as Bruce did not have the authority, but it seemed that the AI cared about Toni's safety, even though JARVIS had no heart. The footage was croppy and kept skipping, which he couldn't understand. JARVIS told him that there wasn't anything wrong with the video.
"I don't think anything, Captain. Not one thing. You always wanted to be soldier and now you are. Just like all the rest," Peggy said as they walked pass her.
Anyhow let me know what you think.
Natasha, narrowing her eyes, gave him a calculating look before taking the phone and putting it on speaker phone. "Romanoff." She said, her hard expression still planted firmly on her face.
"Oh, how you pain me!" Toni whined. Clint's rose an eyebrow, studying her expression like Natasha was. There was a struggle in his eyes as he remained quiet, and it was clear that he was fighting to remain silent. Toni didn't like the way they were looking at her, but she didn't call them on it. "And, Brucie! My ankle hurts!"
"Toni," Rogers called, softly. Toni flinched at the sound of his voice. After getting over her shock, she could tell that he was worried.
Natasha shook her head, the idea painful for her. "I get it. Toni was never a big fan of SHIELD, but you can't-"
Steve looked at her. "Why should I smile? I got rejected again."
I proofed this while half a sleep, so there could be all kind of nonsense in here.
It would've happened anyhow with or without her, which was what she told herself; however, she couldn't believe it. She had done so many things in her life, and she had hurt so many people. How could this be any different? However, this time it was Peggy and her father telling her this, and she knew she could believe them, especially Peggy, who would never lie. She would never steer her wrong. "Okay," she said, slowly pushing herself off Howard.
Toni turned to the Mark 7, which had arrived at her side when she was reading the letter. "JARVIS, can you give me the number for the Law firm Spector and Ross?"
The Genius' mind spun as she thought about what Barnes had said. Considering how she disappeared on Rogers, would he even care if something happened to her? Surely, after she disappeared without a word, he would have pushed her out of his mind. She knew she would have if someone did that to her. "I don't think Rogers would care." Something inside of her didn't like that thought.
It felt like he could breathe again, though he didn't know when he stopped. However, that feeling didn't last long as he thought about the Beefy Blond with his Brunette. The idea that the Blond was trying so hard to find the Brunette, when all hope seemed lost didn't sit well with him. Sure, the Asset would search and hunt for the Brunette—as she was his-, but why did the Blond feel the need to risk his own life for her? Did he feel the same strange feeling in his chest as the Asset did? If so, did he not see that it was hopeless since she wasn't even down there—not that the Blond knew that?
"I know," she stated. If she wasn't already damaged by the nightmares, she would be worried, but she wasn't. Her mind and soul were already damaged.
Her heart was about to pop out of chest, her mind going into a downward tailspin. She tried to remember how she got here, this room with no windows, but all she saw was Bucky. Bucky in his bloody uniform. "This isn't real. You're both dead." Her voice was shaky, and she felt like she was drowning in everything that she had ever hoped for. "I'm dreaming. This isn't real."
"Ain't that the truth?" Toni felt herself start to drift again. Trying to stay awake, she shake her head slightly. "And look we're getting along. That's a first."
"Where would the fun be in that? I like to see you like this," he said, inching his face closer to her.
He reached for her and pulled her in. "I have been told that," he stated as he held her. "You can tell me." He paused. "Do you think someone's following you again?" He asked, not letting go.
The genius didn't know why she was fighting it so much, why she wanted to believe that he was alive even if it was impossible. Sure, she cared for Barnes, and he was important to both her and Steve, but it was something else, and she knew it. Maybe, it was anger. She was mad at him, pissed that he had broken his promise to her. How dare he tell her that he would be back then not come back? Did he not understand that people weren't allowed to leave her? Did he not understand that she didn't—couldn't handle abandonment? That she had abandonment issues? Okay, she knew she was being unfair, because it wasn't his fault. If he had any choice, he would be at her side, and she knew it.
Trip pushed off the window, stepping toward the door. Dugan was also pushing himself to his feet to chase after Steve, who was halfway out the door. "I don't know any of you and have only met Stark a couple of days ago, but it's clear that something is on her chest. She looks like she's drowning."
So, she got yelled at for a little bit of damage while Steve blasted through buildings? What crap was that?
"I think we can lose someone in the amount of wrapping paper in here," Barton teased as he looked around the room. It was everywhere, including in the large Christmas tree. It was sticking out the branches in every direction and at every height as if someone was lauching it at the tree. There was even a pile of paper to the left of them.
"I wanted to see how you're doing," he stated with a smile. It came out as a cheesy pickup line.
Forcing her eyes open, she found herself staring at Rogers and she was completely shocked by his appearance. There had to be something wrong, very wrong. "Steve," she uttered, her voice cracking, as the hold on her hand didn't die.
"Good." There was a pause. "And she hasn't awoke yet?"
she yelled at herself.
"Old married couple?" She questioned as she narrowed her eyes at him. "A married couple? That's what you come up with?" Why did she find that so insulting? "We aren't anything close to marry."
Schmidt looked at her. "You don't know when to be quiet. Maybe, that's why the Americans sent you in. A way to silence you?"
"I have, but that doesn't matter here."
But Toni was sick of their conversation. They were loud and annoying. How could anyone sleep through it? "So loud," she moaned as she tried to open her eyes. Her eyes lids weight a ton.
Toni didn't know how Steve thought this would work. Glasses and hats weren't a good disguise at any place, but she didn't dare tell that to Steve, who was beaming ear to ear as he looked at her. If she thought about it, the glasses worked for Superman and Supergirl, so hey, it could work for them- though those were fictional characters. SSSSHH! It could still work. Besides, who would think that Toni Stark was at the Smithsonian Museum; plus, no one would expect Steve to visit an exhibit dedicated to Captain America. People think she's an ass, not him.
*O*O*
Why was his door unlocked? That wasn't good, but that didn't mean anything. Toni was here after all, and when she had an idea in her head, she tended to be forgetful. "Toni," he called out as he entered his apartment. "Toni?" he said a little bit louder. His eyes scanned the apartment, looking for any kind of movement. "Toni," he called one last time before giving up. She wasn't in the apartment that much he could tell, but he wasn't sure when she had left. He panicked for a second, worried that she left for New York before saying bye. However, that didn't last for long as he spotted her phone the night stand.
Sharon beamed. "You too." She didn't wait for another word as she disappeared into her apartment.
Toni wiggled as he held her tight against him. "Don't think like that. Why are you acting like this? We-" Before she could finished, Barnes smashed his lips against her and kissed her with everything that he had. At first, Toni didn't know what to make of it, and after she got over the shock of it, she was confused as to what to do. Did she kiss him back? Did she push him off? Why in the hell was she putting so much thought into a stupid kiss? She had never in her life put so much thought into a single kiss. It's because you care, she thought. She cared for him more than she wanted to admit. She cared for a lot of people that she didn't want to care about. Rogers, Barnes, Phillips, Peggy, the howling Commandos… All of them. Screw it. She leaned into him and kissed him hard.
"I have my moments." She stepped toward the table that the officers were standing moments before and stared down at the map. As they were still in Italy, she knew before looking at the map that it was of Italy and the surrounding areas. "So why did you call?"
His heart skipped a few beats as he thought about Toni alone in Central Park. Why was she in Central Park at this time? Did she not understand how dangerous that was? This wasn't
Toni looked at him before she turned her attention back to the IV and suddenly torn one out.
The Genius let herself relax as she strengthened her legs. "So what were my father's instructions?" she asked. The Howling commandos gave each other a look, which Toni did not like. She was not a child, who needed protection. She would take care of herself.
Shaking her head, the genius focused on finding her shoes, which wasn't too hard to find. They were at the end of the hospital bed, but as she reached for them, the door to the room creeped open. Ignoring her fear, her third thought was that it was Colonel Phillips, coming to yell at her, but the footsteps were too light to belong to him.
Her mind drifted to what she would do if she was stuck in the past. She couldn't work in that hardware store forever or she would go crazy, but what else could she do? She could try to get a job at Stark Industries and outsmart her father at every turn just to piss him off, but that wouldn't be a good idea. Plus, she couldn't really stand him and she didn't want to see him every day. If she did, the cops would probably be called daily.
Steve paused, glancing back to the window before looking at the door. He hesitated for a second, fighting with himself. He knew it would be logical and quicker to wait, but he hated doing nothing. It was like he was back on the sidelines, and he hated that. Hated it.
Toni glanced between the three of them before her eyes rested on the door. "So you did take apart my device and took the core?" she said, slowly as she tried to calm herself as she said it.
"Picking you up? Good thing that you aren't heavy," he joked.
"She's resourceful. She'll probably figure it out on her own." He reached for the unfinished, nonworking device. "So if we are able to get enough power to this, we should be able to travel back to Toni."
have a relationship, and she would refuse to have one.
Clint didn't answer right away. It felt like they had to pull the answer from him. "No, and I lost the trail. I'm still waiting on Agent 13 to see if she has anything, but—"
"I thought you…were…someone…else." She said slowly. She didn't want to admit that she was afraid and that someone was stalking her.
Steve could feel the color form in his cheeks as everyone knew about his feelings for the Brunette. Everyone knew how
"What are you talking about?" Natasha asked, her eyes narrowing.
She closed her eyes, as she took a deep breath. "If it makes you feel better, I can take the Iron Man suit and go a few rounds with you. I won't easy on you. I promise. But let's face it, I'm awesome, and I wasn't lying when I say I would end the idiot who could to dare to lay on hand on me." With a deep breath, she forced out the image of Barnes' face.
"Yes, I realized he wasn't, but by then, it was too late."
"I remember everything, Romanoff," he replies as Natasha closes the door behind her.
"I know," he replied, coldly.
"Toni," he called to her.
Chapter 6:
Toni knew that, but denial was her best friend and it would help her hide, which was something that she was good at. "Only people with nicknames can lecture me," she replied, as she shut the cases.
Any way, it seems like Toni is finally seeing ghosts? Do you think she will tell Steve or lose herself down that rabbit hole? Or is Hydra going to get what they want?
"Oh, you think you can run Stark Industries, do you?" he asked.
She stared at him wondering why she thought of Rogers before Barnes. "I know," she said as she followed him out of the bushes. "Plus, I'll be harder to catch this time." She forced a smile.
His apartment building was no exception. The only one person in the hall besides him was his blond neighbor, Sharon. His blond neighbor that Clint teased him about endlessly as if there was something there. He wasn't sure why Clint kept pushing it, kept bring her up, but it was getting old fast. Granted, he would be feel like this because of the day he had. "Hello," he greeted, as he passed her in the hall, attempting to give her a smile.
He was an asset, and he wasn't supposed to feel, just kill without question, but yet, here he was feeling. He wasn't supposed to feel as it made his weak, but he was feeling, which annoyed him. He was a weapon, a tool to use, and he couldn't doing that if he was feeling. Emotions were the enemies, and they needed to be destroyed. He could kill the Brunette to do so as she was the cause of them, but the idea of killing her didn't sit well with him. It stole his very breath at the thought her dead. He didn't know why, didn't know much besides the fact that he couldn't kill her.
The door to the room started to open, silencing the loud genius. Mr. Salty walked in with an expression that someone just farted in his face, which made Toni chuckle. "Sound something smelly?" she asked with an annoying smile on her face. "Or that could be just your normal face!"
