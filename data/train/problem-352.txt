“I know,” John said peevishly. Sherlock’s ability to read his mind, or at least deduce his thoughts from the slightest changes in his expression, was unnerving. “So why don’t you think it was a mistake?”
"You need to look like you're enjoying it," Sherlock critiqued, "not like you're getting a tetanus jab."
Sherlock was holding him like he was something important, precious even, and John hated that he was just understanding now, when it was too late.
"I can tell you the cuts were made by different knives at different times. I can tell you the width and make of the blades. However, I need more data to form a viable theory as to the circumstances in which they were received."
Mycroft sighed. “It’s disappointing how slow you are, little brother. Come now, try to think. Do you like the way you feel?”
In the waiting room at the hospital, Lestrade stood as the doctor approached. Relief flooded through him when she explained they had been able to stabilise Sherlock’s condition. “We’ll have to notify the next of kin,” she was saying. “Can you tell us who that might be?”
Mary flinched, so John had done his best to adjust his voice from explosive to seething. “I know how stupid you think I am; trust me, I know. But I am actually a doctor. A doctor! Wow! For someone as stupid as you think I am, I did somehow manage to pass medical school and gain a decent reputation for being good at what I do.”
“Sherlock, she’s not in Berlin; she’s dead. Terrorists got to her in Pakistan. Mycroft said he was absolutely certain.”
Sherlock had scrutinised the corpse Molly wheeled out for him that morning: David Rodgers—the corpse from the alley, but unclothed this time, allowing him to do a more thorough examination than he had been able to do on the street. He’d texted the photos on to John at his surgery. There was nothing particularly noteworthy about the body—thirty-five years old, fit, a regular runner judging by his muscle tone—except his thighs. On the otherwise unmarked, un-tattooed, unblemished skin, thin silver scars latticed the man's inner thighs. In a word: Odd.
The nineteenth century dream was connected to the incident in the cemetery tonight. He knew it was connected, somehow, but the chaos in his mind left him grasping at sense in a storm of discordant thoughts.
shouldn’t have survived. Anyone with even marginally less strength would have died. He himself had been at death’s door, actually flatlining for six minutes before he had somehow managed to fight his way back. How? Why? It wasn’t fair. A few more minutes and it wouldn’t have been possible. A few more minutes and the doctors would have stopped trying. A few more minutes and right now John would still be in love with her. She would be the doting wife, comforting her husband. And he would have adored her for it, the way he did when they first started dating.
“I guess this means you didn’t get the milk, then?” John asked as they swung open the doors of the school pool and stepped out into the car park. Moriarty and his snipers were long gone. There was no sign he had been there at all.
John had lost all of the newlywed weight he’d initially gained and more. And the nightmares had worsened. Some nights he was back in Afghanistan—in the field seeing his troopmates fall beside him. Some nights he was back on the side street of Barts hospital, struggling through restraining hands to get to the body on the pavement. And still, some nights, to his surprise (it had been so long ago), he dreamed of the pool: the bright red of the sniper’s laser sight on Sherlock’s forehead and then the much deeper red that ran from the same point. He remembered the dream well—a recurring nightmare that had started after the confrontation with Moriarty: Sherlock falling into the water and John jumping in after him, but the pool was vast and the vest full of explosives weighed a ton and it was pulling him down and he couldn’t reach Sherlock’s hand and he couldn’t breathe.
“Criminals are so obvious these days,” Sherlock continued. “All you have to do is check the fibres in their socks. That’s what the police never get. It’s the socks.”
Funny that Sherlock should be holding onto him like that. In his dreams it was always the other way around. John desperately trying to hold onto Sherlock as they pulled him away, placed him on a stretcher… Sherlock had never lost John. He'd always been here, whenever Sherlock needed him. But John supposed it was just a reflex. He might hold sheets or a pillow in his own bed.
John could not believe what was happening for the first few seconds it was happening. And then a rush of heat through his veins burned off the paralysis. He reacted. He kissed him back, sliding his hands under Sherlock’s open coat to wrap his arms around the detective’s lean frame even as he felt Sherlock's hands skimming down his back to grip at his waist.
Sherlock reached out and languidly tapped the keyboard. The tab switched to Twitter. Bauer’s latest tweet informed anyone who cared to know that he would be spending the evening in, binge-watching telly. Sherlock unconsciously wrinkled his nose in distaste as he reread it, and John felt a small smile tug the corner of his mouth.
But looking over Sherlock’s notes, Mycroft knew he couldn’t have done anything like it in such a short amount of time. It had been a dangerous exercise in passion: Sherlock’s passion for chemistry tested by his passion for John, and he had pushed himself past his own limits, accomplishing in three days what would have taken even the most brilliant researchers months if not years. But the cost had been high.
Mary dropped her gaze to her lap. John had been upset with her for deceiving him, but he had deceived her too. Their first date—his heart was available like she was Mary Morstan: not at all. And here he was now, opening his eyes and asking for Sherlock with single-minded desperation. No, there was nothing she could do. Not now, not ever. John had chosen his fate long before he met her.
Sherlock watched his flatmate walk agitatedly back up the stairs and wondered if it was just John who got upset about having nice things or if it was a more widespread phenomenon.
They looked around the edges and could see a group of costumed people half walking, half stumbling directly toward them.
He blamed the drugs for the sentiment involved in going to John’s blog, to the story of when they met, after take-off.
She was sitting in John’s chair. Mrs. Hudson had let her in. He would have to have a word with Mrs. Hudson.
He reclaimed his mouth, demanding and fierce, and Sherlock melted into him with a small noise that made John’s blood pound in his veins. He yanked Sherlock’s shirt out from his trousers as he worked his mouth. He ran his hand down the front of that expensive grey shirt, flicking open buttons and letting his fingertips trace the trail of bare skin. Sherlock responded by slipping his hands beneath John’s shirt and sliding them up his back.
Sherlock also knew that Mycroft would offer him money. He wouldn’t take it, because accepting money from his brother—as opposed to stealing it—would mean submission. Mycroft would use the money as a contract, requiring Sherlock to comply with his every request. Sherlock, for his part, would rather spend an evening of quiet conversation with Anderson than sell his freedom to Mycroft. And since both of these options were only slightly better than suicide—real suicide, elaborately staged fake suicides were excellent fun—he needed a better idea.
The sight of him, on the edge of the table, looking at him like that—it triggered something deep within his core: a primal instinct that made him want to grab Sherlock’s hair and force him back, kiss him and bite him and claim him in a way John was sure no one had before. There was a certain wiring in his brain that wanted to shove Sherlock down now and have at him until both of their visions blurred.
It wasn’t until the next night that he picked it up again, uncrumpling the paper a bit more forcefully than was necessary.
“Sherlock,” Molly said carefully. Was it possible he didn’t know? Had his brother not told him? “You do know John’s been in a coma since they brought him here, don’t you? He’s here. Or at least he was this morning.”
Even as a very young child Sherlock had always been fiercely independent. He hated that Mycroft was seven years older and that many times more capable. Sherlock would have been the smartest boy in England if Mycroft hadn’t been there first, holding the title above his head. And Mycroft never lost an opportunity to remind his little brother that he was stupid by comparison. Whenever he felt Sherlock’s ego needed an adjustment he would ask him a question he knew he wouldn’t be able to answer.
How many times since then had he encountered John in his mind palace, in a dream, only to witness John place his gun in his mouth, sinking to his knees in front of Sherlock, resting its length on his tongue?
to fall in love with someone of either gender. It’s less likely for someone closer to one side of the spectrum, but it’s not impossible.”
John couldn’t believe his bad luck. Apparently there were two times Sherlock was going to admit to John that he admired him: at his wedding and at his deathbed and now he was missing half of it.
He still had a key to 221B. Mrs. Hudson had never asked for it back when they thought Sherlock was dead. Sherlock had never asked for it back afterward.
Things went along smoothly (read: gratingly) enough for a few years until suddenly there seemed to be a crime drought in London. For more than half a year Lestrade’s work was trivial enough that he didn’t contact Sherlock at all. So finally, when there was a really nasty murder, he was surprised at receiving no response to his text. Sherlock was usually so (unsettlingly) enthusiastic about murders he responded within minutes. After receiving no response to three messages in a span of three hours he decided it was time to call round to Sherlock’s flat.
He’d been so certain when he kissed John that he could handle it. But he had underestimated by far the strength of John’s reaction and the strength of his own. He'd thought he could tolerate the damage, withstand the impact. But upon being confronted with the reality of the destruction—the perfect organisation of his mind palace upended by the chaos of emotion—he couldn’t let it happen.
His phone rang. Again blocked number. He swiped to answer it and slowly raised the phone to his ear.
The ensuing struggle was halfhearted to say the most. Laughter is not conducive to muscle tension, and the drug only intensified the pudding feeling.
Moran looked pleased. “Thank you. It’s a fine compliment coming from an accomplished chemist such as yourself. Chemistry is a hobby of mine; I might have gone into the field, but psychology has always had my heart.”
But now, he could take a week off. Why not? He would go somewhere with nice scenery to gain some perspective. He needed a reminder that the world was still a beautiful place—that the timeless perfection of nature endured unaffected by such petty human quibbles as failed marriages and assassins and difficult friendships. Yes, a holiday would do him a lot of good. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to throw Sherlock for a loop for once, by being the one to disappear wordlessly. The thought of giving Sherlock a taste of his own medicine was not the primary reason for John’s decision, but it really didn’t deter him either.
“Have your observational skills deteriorated so far? You might have noticed I’m wearing an entirely different outfit.”
So John set about calling his colleagues, asking them to cover his appointments while he was away. They were more than happy to oblige, considering John had spent the past year picking up as many of their unwanted shifts as he could in favour of spending the time at home.
Sherlock stood stock-still in the living room facing the doorway. In the number of seconds it took him to understand the gravity of the situation he felt the earth shift under him. New results from an old experiment. Fascinating. Unexpected. Everything he’d been prepared for, the arrangements he’d personally influenced, had switched completely and without warning.
“It’s incredible,” John marvelled. He had always known Sherlock’s childhood must have been nothing short of extraordinary. “So you think—that night in the street—you think he was speaking Czech?”
Mycroft smirked with cold eyes. “The respect is mutual, brother dearest.” His voice went dangerously quiet as he added, “Although
Through the confusion a vision of that afternoon surfaced. The same turmoil—the rushing thoughts slick like poison in his head. But he’d known how to handle it then. He’d known how to hush the storm even as it surged through him…
“No, no,” John said quickly. “It’s fine. I have a lot to do here.” He gestured to the disaster zone currently substituting for a living room.
John watched Sherlock guide his partner across the floor as fluidly as if there were no one else present. As if the steps were as natural as walking. Mesmerising. The consulting detective was a violinist. The violinist was a chemist. The chemist was a dancer. Incredible.
If John had been on his game before, with Sherlock’s eyes burning into his back he was a force to be reckoned with. He hadn’t heard from the detective since the
behaviour. He leaned back in his chair; the cheap metal scraped against the floor of the cafe. He watched his sister’s expression soften from reproving to concerned. He didn’t know which was worse.
Sherlock recalled the reference to John’s wedding. However, he maintained there was nothing ‘weird’ about preventing a violinist from butchering a Mozart classic. One would expect a so-called professional to recognise the difference between forte, mezzo-forte, and fortissimo, and that he should be reprimanded upon his failure to do so.
. In a flash of clarity Sherlock understood: In John’s mind Sherlock had been a good enough reason for him to live, but he hadn’t been a good enough reason for Sherlock to live.
He struggled to order his sluggish thoughts. Why? Why was he back at Baker Street? He was supposed to be in John’s hospital room. They had moved him here. Why? They wanted him out of the way. Or perhaps there was something they didn’t want him to see—
He stared at Sherlock blankly through the haze the kiss left over him, and Sherlock looked back at him for a moment before he strode out the door, slamming it shut behind him.
Nine days. Sherlock’s heart must have stopped, falling deadly still as the numbers clicked by in his head. Parker had died nine days after receiving the poison. Rodgers had died in fourteen. John could have up to five more days, or he could die tonight.
Sherlock watched her for a moment and Molly’s blush deepened. “Always, you know I’m always…” she fumbled, “happy to help.”
Sherlock recognised it immediately. He’d known about John’s nightmares from the moment they’d met in the lab at Barts. He’d observed it. Tired, under-eye circles plus psychosomatic limp plus PTSD equals nightmares. But he’d cleared those up along with the limp. There had been no nightmares at Baker Street.
Lestrade had called for the thirty-eighth time since John had been back from the hospital (Scotland Yard needed him for a hundred things, as usual, but most importantly this time they needed his testimony for the Moran case), but he’d been putting them off until he felt John was recovered enough to leave him. And still he’d stationed Mrs. Hudson in the flat as a precaution.
as much as my wedding suit, and I know how much I spent on that. I mean, thank you, but I can’t accept it. No way. It’s too expensive. I won’t wear it.”
"Are we done then?" John asked. Sherlock was surprised to hear a trace of disappointment in his voice. "I think I was just getting the hang of it."
“People tend to find giving orders difficult after they die.” His eyelids were heavy. He fought to keep them open.
John walked into the wrong room and the nurse there gave him a strange look. He needed to focus. He had another patient to see. He couldn’t think about what he’d done or the likelihood that when he got home Sherlock would give him another awkward speech about being married to his work and, trying at his best ‘polite’ tone, ask John to find a new flat. That would be the worst of it, if Sherlock affected some kind of detached attempt at ‘polite’ with him. They were so far beyond that first night at Angelo’s. If Sherlock pulled anything like that again John might finish the job the attacker had started in the warehouse last night.
Mycroft's lips twitched to something more grimace than grin. “This conversation will be less unpleasant if you dispense with Hollywood gangster terminology. No. According to our information his target will be a prominent drug dealer who’s in town for a few weeks.”
It couldn’t be possible and yet it had to be, because Sherlock was lying under him now looking at John like he might want him just as much. But still the idea seemed to jam the gears in his head. He couldn’t believe Sherlock, Sherlock Holmes, the man who scorned all forms of affection, especially physical—could want this, could want this with
“Leave then,” she said with as much venom as one can manage first thing in the morning. “And don’t bother coming back. I mean it.”
John had finally opened his mouth to say something, looking horribly uncomfortable about it, when Sherlock cut him off.
She swayed, moving her hips slowly to the rhythm. John was more than happy to see Scotch again, the disagreements of the morning forgotten entirely.
Anticipating trouble on Sherlock’s first day of school Mycroft waited by the schoolyard until his brother inevitably got himself into a fight with about five other boys. Sherlock was irritating, yes, but these imbecilic, inferior children were not worthy of touching him, let alone hitting his (admittedly annoying) face. He didn’t care if it was Sherlock’s fault (he was almost certain it would be). If Sherlock was going to start fights, then the world had better understand that Mycroft was going to finish them.
There were more words. Not as clear. Something about dishes and the sink… Why was Sherlock talking about dishes? Was his brain garbling the words? He strained to hear more.
Sherlock was lying on his left side, facing him though lower, lips at John's clavicle, nose almost brushing the underside of his jaw. John had his arm draped over Sherlock's back and—he shut his eyes in mortification—the world's only consulting detective's knee caught between his thighs.
And there was still the possibility of coincidence. Though it rankled, he couldn’t completely rule it out. If men were dropping dead around London with scars on their thighs it wasn’t out of the realm of possibility that two of them could end up in the same funeral home. Whatever the truth turned out to be, their morning client was an innocuous component.
Nine p.m. approached and Sherlock braced himself for an assault from Mary. She would come in screeching about her right to stay overnight with John and he wasn’t sure he would be able to prevent himself from tossing her through the window.
“This was Karina’s specialty,” she said, moving across to John’s chair. She dragged the knife gently down his chest where she’d opened his shirt.
But then John was a man comprised of contradictions, and Sherlock couldn’t resist contradictions. The man who walked into the lab that day was a left-handed doctor who’d learned to shoot with his right. A soldier and a doctor: a killer and a healer. A man who limped from a shoulder wound: a backward trauma that caused him to literally ache for the war, an outward manifestation mirroring Sherlock's own internal damage. Of course he’d known the cure.
When a strategically timed police officer arrived and scattered the midnight cemetery revellers, Sherlock waited a moment until the area was clear. He started to stand but John caught his arm.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow and it probably occurred to all of them just how literal that statement was.
“I can’t believe I can no longer say I’ve never kissed a man,” John said with some astonishment, half to himself.
John sat in the back of the cab, rocking back and forth, doing his best not to jump out of his skin. It was the longest cab ride he’d taken since the last time Sherlock pushed him away and he’d had to get a cab back to him.
Lestrade saw it in the way Sherlock—a veritable expert in blocking people from his sensory awareness—inclined his head, even just a fraction, whenever John spoke. He saw it in the way Sherlock watched John—gaze unsettlingly intense, causing whoever was on forensics to throw uncomfortable glances at each other. He saw it in Sherlock’s face whenever John complimented him. John was not the first person to tell Sherlock he was a genius, but he was the first person Sherlock had ever responded to with more than an eye roll. He heard it, internalised it, savoured it. Sherlock Holmes, who’d never given anybody the time of day, wanted John Watson’s approval.
But he decided he would let this one go. When dealing with Sherlock Holmes, John had learned to pick his battles. Because if he hadn’t, well, he would have lost his sheep a long time ago.
He was older than Moriarty, closer to forty, sharp suit: Hugo Boss if Sherlock was not mistaken (he was never mistaken about suits). As Sherlock walked closer the deductions about his new opponent scrolled through his head.
The strength and energy in the detective’s sinewy muscles was provocatively different from the soft curves John was used to. Sherlock’s body was firm, powerful, challenging, directly opposed to the supple and pliant form that John had found attractive in women. And yet John discovered that the more he felt the more he wanted the challenge.
He snatched the vial of blood and a microscope slide, swiftly using the dropper to create another film. His hands were shaking. He grabbed another vial with one of his latest solutions and she scampered out of his way as he swept over to the microscope.
“And you’re asking me what then? To tell you a ghost story? Really, Mr. Holmes, I could have sworn someone told me you were clever.”
John stalked off to the bathroom and as he brushed his teeth he wondered if there was anyone else living with such a difficult detective. He wondered if there was a support group for people living with difficult detectives.
John felt his body respond to being pushed with a surge of adrenaline. He locked his eyes on Sherlock’s and thought the whole thing would be a lot easier if the man didn’t have to be so distractingly gorgeous all the time: his nearly black, beautifully curled fringe sweeping across his forehead, impossibly bright eyes electric with the same arousal John could feel quickening his own breath.
he’d grumbled to the woman at the Battersea power station. But it wasn’t true, was it. Sherlock had followed him then. And then again on the railway lines, investigating Andrew West’s murder; Sherlock was suddenly at his side.
But now—Mycroft unconsciously clenched his jaw—now there was finally something Sherlock was asking for that he couldn’t do. Sherlock’s MI6 big brother who had saved him from bullies at school and terrorists in Serbia could do nothing now but give him morphine.
Those two years had been nearly unbearable. As much as he knew it had hurt John, it hadn’t been any picnic for Sherlock either.
He felt a tug on his sleeve and he followed Sherlock over to a stage where there were two empty seats.
, but strangely it never came. This was Sherlock. Uncontrollable. And more importantly this was life with Sherlock. Unstable. Ever since that first night he’d understood this was how it was going to be. Sherlock was going to be constantly getting himself into scrapes—because he was the most idiotic genius in the world and he had danger written in his DNA—and John would be spending his life trying to save him, and Sherlock was never,
“Exactly the amount of arrogant we can expect from someone who never gets caught. It’s a common Ukrainian name; why shouldn’t he use it? The brilliant part is, if anyone were looking for her they would never think to look in a cemetery. Murderers don’t buy plots and bury their victims.”
“It’s because of John, er, Dr. Watson—I should have said. Sherlock won't tell me what's happened, but he's trying to invent a new drug.”
“I take it you met Moran last night?” Sherlock watched John's posture relaxing as he realised they were not going to discuss the bedroom events of the previous night.
The morning had started off well enough, waking up in Emily’s bed, getting up gently so as not to wake her, slipping into the kitchen to start the kettle, then one text from Sherlock and all thoughts of coffee evaporated.
“It is. It comes from the old days when a shepherd would be in such trouble if he lost his sheep that he could lose his wits.”
“Yes, he needs a lift home,” he replied, indicating Sherlock’s unconscious form on the gurney. “See that he gets there.”
“I was a surgeon, in a war, Mary. I know bullet wounds. I had one myself. Or did you forget? You missed his heart by less than an inch—that’s still a fatal shot nine times out of ten.
John wanted to scoff at this, but then again, he supposed if anyone had a right to be paranoid it was Sherlock Holmes. When Sherlock thought there were microphones and cameras in their flat, there usually were.
"Yes, that's it. So you can probably go ahead and look at her. You can make eye contact like, erm—" He gestured at the air between them.
“Good,” Moriarty grinned with sharp teeth. “There’s a good lad.” He tossed John’s gun over the water and Sherlock caught it, blinking down at the familiar weapon. Dangerous. Familiar and dangerous, just like John—
“Kathleen Bauer told us that on Friday, October ninth, she brought her friend, Amy Elliot, to Monroe’s to pick up her brother, Tony, and his friend, Brandon Riley. Brandon had got the drug that night and Tony hadn’t.”
He spun around and grabbed John’s upper arms roughly. “John, I did it. I solved it. This means we can— We can—”
John knew the guys would understand. This was only the latest of many similar texts he’d sent over the years. When apologising for breaking off plans John only had to type the word ‘Sherlock’ to be excused.
The hot water felt wonderful as John washed away the dirt and sweat from the afternoon, pieces of grass sliding down the drain as he rinsed the shampoo from his hair. Rubbing soap across his body he felt the spots on his arms where Sherlock had gripped him during their fight, and the spot on his hip where he’d hit the ground. There was no doubt he would have bruises tomorrow.
“Really?” John said when he’d finished unloading the food and walked back into the living room. “But she didn’t have scars.”
Sherlock flexed his fingers in his pockets, suddenly craving a cigarette the way he hadn't in a while. In truth the only thing preventing him from smoking one now was the fact that he didn't have one. Sometimes the simplest solutions are the most effective.
obvious. It had been obvious to everyone but the two of them all along. There had never been anyone more important to him than Sherlock Holmes, and hadn’t some part of him always known there never would be?
John breathed slowly in an effort to calm himself and was surprised to find Sherlock's scent—something he'd been unaware of in sleep and too shocked to notice until now—was doing just that: quieting the frantic buzz of
Emilia Ricoletti: An old case filed somewhere in the archives of his mind’s library. The woman who shot herself through the head and continued on to commit various murders. In his altered state of mind he’d been convinced that if he could solve Ricoletti’s case then he could solve Moriarty’s. It made perfect sense.
“I don’t want you to have sex with her,” Sherlock snapped. “But you can act like you’re interested. Keep her attention, you know the drill.”
His eyes swept over his doctor—the familiar curves of his face, the scent of his hair fresh from the shower—the proximity was overwhelming. John stood his ground but Sherlock could hear his breathing quicken. He felt the same lack of oxygen as the air seemed to rush from the room. He’d thought about it all night and concluded he could do this. It wouldn’t be the first time he’d chosen John over his work.
John grinned, looking up at him from where he was lying on his back. "You never tell me why when you ask me to do things."
— And he had all of it now, here, tonight; this is what he wanted. So it was with no small amount of horror that Sherlock realised it wasn’t enough.
John lifted Sherlock’s head gently and moved his tags around over his shoulder. There was nowhere for John to put his left arm besides across Sherlock. Sherlock hadn’t buttoned his coat, so John did his best to pull it around him to keep his bare chest from being exposed beneath his torn shirt. Then he reluctantly rested his arm over his flatmate’s waist. He decided he could defend himself against the imaginary crowd accusing him of groping his drugged flatmate by saying he was acting as a seatbelt. At least this way he could prevent Sherlock from rolling off the seat if the cabbie hit the brakes. And Sherlock didn’t complain. He must have been comfortable, because in a matter of a few minutes he seemed to have drifted off, whether to sleep or a heroin-induced stupor John couldn’t say. He felt his concern tightening his jaw and he consciously unclenched his teeth.
"Nope," John said, crossing his arms and dropping into his chair. "Better to just call the whole thing off, I think."
crashing through here. And I can’t—I’m not strong enough to stop it. I tried.” Sherlock looked away. He didn’t like admitting failure, even if it was just to a figment of his own imagination.
"The girlfriend who died in the car accident. She doesn’t have scars but I want to check her blood too.” Sherlock turned back to Hannah. “In the meantime, we’ll require any information you have on the three corpses."
With a flick of his wrist he held the lighter under the kid’s sleeve. Flames ripped across the boy’s jacket. The children standing near him shouted and jumped back. The boy screamed, running in circles and flapping his arms.
You’re pathetic. Is this all it takes to defeat the great Sherlock Holmes? Something as ordinary, as
Adrenaline surged through him with the pounding of his heart. He felt the flex and tension of his muscles like a blessing as he ran. His body had been aching to work off his frustration through the torturously long days spent recovering. His medical knowledge of convalescence told him that a rugby match was probably not the best move so soon after recovering, but his medical knowledge could be damned for now. He had aggravation wound through him tightly enough to make his head spin and he needed physical action to break it.
“Vodka martini with lemon,” Sherlock replied, adding a bit of the James Bond touch to being undercover. Actually, John doubted if Sherlock knew who James Bond was. John looked at his friend suspiciously. He must know.
For the meantime, it was necessary to get out of the current compromising position before John woke up yelling about not being gay and possibly blaming Sherlock for sleep-hugging.
John tightened his grip on Sherlock’s hair and was rewarded by his lips parting in a small gasp. John took the opportunity and slid his tongue into his mouth. And
"A and B died in a car crash on Monday, October eleventh. They were a couple and the families chose to do a joint funeral; I worked on them both. C died on Sunday. There was a break-in at his flat and he was shot, maybe you heard about it."
How things had changed. Sherlock steepled his fingers as he often did unconsciously when thinking. The skull now was
John stood up straighter and a weak smile pulled at his mouth. “I’m fine. I just—I might have to sit out on the rooftop chases for a day or two.”
Sherlock’s eyes swept the Ikea-laden room as he and John sat on a fading green couch. Sherlock checked off the deductions in his mind.
A fate worse than death and it was entirely preventable, he realised in time when the wound wasn’t so raw and cold logic could soothe the burning pain. It was really quite simple. If one never fell in love, one would never experience such suffering. Because people were not permanent. People could be ripped away at a moment’s notice. Cancer, a missed red light, a spontaneously rupturing blood vessel, a random act of violence.
When Sherlock finally sank the needle beneath his skin with practiced skill—the prick of pain like a welcome home—it had nothing to do with fear. He cared nothing about the mission he’d been sent to die on, and Mycroft was right (for all of his brother’s infuriating ways of existing, he was right). It was infinitely preferable to die on the field than it was to rot in a prison cell. Sherlock knew himself well enough to know he wouldn’t survive a prolonged jail sentence: the torture of boredom without the relief of The Work, and the drugs low quality and hard to come by—his brain would tear itself to pieces. It would break him. He would be unrecognisable by the end of it, and no matter how quickly Mycroft managed to negotiate parole, there would be nothing left of him worth salvaging.
Sherlock’s eyes met John’s for an instant before he continued. “As soon as I saw the lip gloss in Alexa’s room the idea occurred to me. But it hinged on whether or not the drug could be transmitted via secondary contact. I figured the poison would be a much higher concentration than the drug, which”—he checked the results of the chemical analysis—“is true. So, if the regular drug could be transferred through a secondary kiss in the correct timespan, then the poison must also have been.”
“One that works for the same... establishment. I have good reason to believe the woman who killed the men is dead too.”
John checked his watch. They were to meet Mrs. Hudson downstairs in twenty minutes. “Do you want a drink?”
As for himself, John had known within twenty-four hours of meeting him that Sherlock was someone he’d live for, kill for, and die for. Not everyone is lucky enough to find someone like that. And John counted himself lucky. He’d chosen to live for Sherlock at a point when he’d had nothing worth living for. He’d killed for Sherlock when he needed to, and now he could die for him as well. It was nothing more than the fulfilment of the original design.
He looked down at the two pieces of destroyed pillow in his hands, and at Bonkers and Minnie, playing around his feet with the little puffs of cotton that had fallen to the floor.
John hadn't lived with him since his 'suicide' and he kept forgetting. Why should he use valuable storage space in his mind palace for such disagreeable information? Agitated, he raked his hand through his hair.
John halted in his tracks. It was like warmth filtering through the mist: invisible, intangible, but it surrounded him, comforting in a way nothing had been since the embrace of Sherlock's arms around him in the street before he'd closed his eyes.
Sherlock could feel him leaning slightly over his shoulder to look at his notes. The familiar smell of wool and toast mingling with the unique, warm scent of John’s skin enveloped him. Sherlock had an unusually sharp sense of smell and a remarkable scent memory. It allowed him not only to pick up but to differentiate with unerring accuracy between barely lingering traces of perfumes, tobaccos, and even deodorants. Considering this and the fact that there was no one he spent more time in physical proximity with, John’s scent was as familiar to him as his childhood bedroom, as instantly recognisable as the smell of blood, formaldehyde, propane—It was different though, because it was softer than any chemical or perfume and certainly more agreeable. But despite its subtlety Sherlock could pick it out of a crowded place and know John was there even before seeing him. He found it unexpectedly… nice, even comforting in a way no other human’s was. John’s scent was an integral component of 221B, and the flat had never smelled right when he wasn’t living there.
John had thought about going down to Barts several times already. The chemistry was more than beyond his abilities, but that was usually the case during the many long hours they’d spent holed up in the lab, and still he’d been able to keep himself busy with menial tasks, just content to radiate companionship if nothing else.
Mycroft’s posture was rail straight and Sherlock knew that even if his fighting skills were superior, his detestable brother could make things more difficult than he had time for.
John moved better with a partner. Apparently a sense of responsibility for another person's movements was motivating for him. John had a strong, innate sense of responsibility for those around him. The mark of a good soldier.
“I suppose I’m not getting the money back I paid for tonight,” John muttered half to himself as he put on his watch.
Sherlock gave John a look that suggested he was being unsympathetic. John avoided it by ducking into the kitchen to make tea.
John closed his eyes, replaying the dream-sequence from the garden and seeing Sherlock as his brain had imagined him. He was so young. Why? He thought for a moment and it occurred to him that the answer might be quite simple. Sherlock had to be a child in the dream because John was incapable of imagining the adult Sherlock saying any such things. The child could be vulnerable—the child could say what the adult couldn’t.
Startled at the noise, the attacker let go of Sherlock—first priority accomplished—and spun around. But John was already running toward him; he had momentum. He collided with the man twice his size, simultaneously kicking his leg behind the attacker’s and shoving his weight to the side, tripping him backward. The man fell, grabbing at John. John went down with him, rolling at the same time to avoid getting caught. He snapped to his feet as the man was pulling himself up. Perfect position. He whipped the man across the temple with his pistol. It was a killing blow and John hadn’t given it a second thought.
Mary’s eyes welled up with tears. She’d been expecting this for so long, but now that it was happening she felt defenceless, shattered.
Greg Lestrade checked his watch. Eleven-thirty. He was standing in an alley with a few police officers and a dead body. The body had been found much earlier, around five o’clock in the morning by a group of young people stumbling home from a night of clubbing. Lestrade, unfortunate enough to be on call at the time, had been summoned to the scene.
Sherlock scowled. “They had only miniatures of food at the party, and the fat people were guarding it.”
And then Sherlock had come back with Candyland and they'd both lost it entirely, John keeling over onto his side and Sherlock brushing tears from his eyes.
John found his thoughts cut off by Sherlock grabbing his waist and yanking him forward into a kiss. And then Sherlock’s hands were in his hair and he was biting into John’s lower lip and the flash of pleasure-pain had him amending his previous thought:
The teacher who had been supervising a game on the field came running toward them when the kids screamed. Mycroft just had time to give Sherlock a wink before he took off, jumping the fence and returning to his own school.
But the past was nothing compared to now. He’d never been more furious than he had been this past year. And he also knew, with a conviction that made him squeeze the pillow harder, that his anger had never,
John was falling and Sherlock caught him but it didn’t seem to matter how tightly he held him because John was still falling.
“You’re going to get him killed and you know it. If you really cared about him you wouldn’t allow him to stay with you.”
John wearing only his boxers—his toned muscles; kissing John: the taste of whisky, the smell of wool and rain; waking up tangled in John, the heat of his body—
Ever since the bizarre, half-miscommunicated conversation that first night at Angelo’s, John had been trying to piece together the mystery that was Sherlock Holmes’ sexual history. And he had to say, after years of careful attention and collection of various clues, he’d done a right lousy job of it.
No matter how many times he replayed the arguments, voluntarily or involuntarily, the conclusion was always the same: According to ‘Sherlogic,’ Mary had only done what she’d strategically needed to do at the time. According to non-crazy-people logic, his wife had chosen to murder his best friend rather than accept any consequences for her lies.
But even if John wasn’t capable of reciprocating, and even if Sherlock didn’t recognise his own feelings (Lestrade knew the cold logician considered himself above feelings, just as he did everything else), Lestrade could say without hesitation that John Watson had been, by far, the best thing that could have happened to the self-destructive genius he’d met all those years ago. John grounded him, stabilised him, humanised him, made him smile (not smirk). And Lestrade was glad to see it. As obnoxious as the consulting detective was, he truly did care about him. Certainly more than he’d ever admit to Sherlock’s smug face.
“Well, it was after midnight!” she said indignantly. “It must be against public ordinances to be lowering an armoire out of your window in the middle of the night.” John twisted around in his chair in time to see Sherlock’s lips twitch to a half-smile before it dropped. “I could tell they were trying to be quiet about it,” she continued, “but it’s noisy business loading furniture onto a moving van. I can’t imagine why they couldn’t wait until a proper hour.”
“A front. For most patrons Monroe’s is just a strip club. For those who know better it’s a brothel. I would guess they sell drugs too. The two usually go hand in hand.”
He had completely forgotten—and he had the work party tomorrow night. He groaned inwardly. He’d promised Sandra, his colleague at the surgery, that he would go. Time moves differently when you’re with Sherlock Holmes. It was easy to forget which month it was, let alone which day.
Of course Sherlock knew immediately that he had something important to say, apparently just by the sound of his footsteps on the stairs, since the consulting detective hadn’t even glanced up from his microscope before proclaiming John had news to tell him.
He wasn’t the only person Sherlock cared for. There was Lestrade and Molly and Mrs. Hudson and Mycroft (yes, Mycroft; Sherlock would scowl and deny it but John, who was not a petulant child, could see the admiration and respect the detective held for his older brother that ran deep beneath the childish feud). In a more wilfully blind time John would have grouped himself in with the rest of them—just another of the select few Sherlock tolerated: the allies who balanced around the edges of his life, ready to aid when called. But it wasn’t true. He knew with deep-seated certainty that he wasn’t in the same category. Lestrade’s place was Scotland Yard, Molly’s was Barts, Mrs. Hudson’s was Baker Street, and Mycroft’s was the inner-workings of England itself. But John’s place was at the heart of all of it, with Sherlock—at his side, always—inextricable in a way the others weren’t.
He felt impossibly light, almost unaware of the pavement beneath his shoes. As a doctor, John knew the warning signs of fainting. He knew the symptoms of the poison too: hypotension, eventually hypoperfusion. His brain wasn’t getting enough oxygen. He should probably sit down somewhere.
“You’re an idiot for just walking in like that. The plan was underdeveloped. I’d almost call you a genius for pulling off something as brilliantly stupid as that.”
John demanded, startled into peals of laughter. Sherlock laughed with him and John hoped they weren't loud enough to wake up Mrs. Hudson. God, what time was it? It must be past three o'clock in the morning.
“We need to know who owns the club. If this place is what I think it is the person on the books won't be the real owner.”
would have felt if their situations had been reversed? He guessed not. The world’s only consulting detective was not known for his ability to empathise.
He’d never had to worry about John inhibiting his ability to work, annoying him the way everyone else always did. It had never been like that with John. John was different. He alone enhanced Sherlock’s thought process instead of deterring it; he made him better. And now it would be the same with his mind palace. He wouldn’t shut his feelings for John out; they would transform the space; they would improve it. The silent falling water had a calming effect that would help Sherlock concentrate. It would make him better than ever. The way John had.
As Sherlock moved away, unrolling the tape, John finally choked out, “Emily broke up with me for this.”
Without warning the detective turned and shoved him hard up against the building lining the narrow alley. The stones dug into his back where Sherlock was pressing his shoulders into the wall. John’s left hand instinctively flew up to grasp Sherlock’s right wrist, to pull it off, but he didn’t get that far.
Dinner was an unremarkable affair. They made the typical small talk about work. They’d met when they were working at the same surgery several years ago. But now (thankfully) they were at different locations. They smiled a bit, exchanging stories about patients.
Sherlock pressed his palms into his eyes. He couldn’t hold back the floods anymore. He didn’t want to. He’d thought he would simply let go and deal with the consequences accordingly. He had been naïve. But how could he have known? He’d suffered through the disagreeable act of kissing in the past; he’d never experienced anything like what had happened in the kitchen today.
“Sexuality is a scale, and no one is one hundred percent directly on either endpoint. Not me, and not even you, with all of your girlfriends. Everyone has the
“I loved Karina. She was like my sister. We came here to England together. I assume you’re here about her.”
When Sherlock returned to London after his ‘suicide,’ the first thing he noticed was John’s ridiculous moustache. The second thing he noticed was that John was tired. Purple under his eyes like bruises. Nightmares or insomnia? Either way he estimated the cause was withdrawal. By being unable to work with Sherlock, John had been deprived of regular exposure to danger. Cold turkey. Memories of the war creeping back without better threats to replace them.
It was ridiculous. The fear was nameless. There was no concrete reason to believe Sherlock was in any danger at all. It was only the memory. If Sherlock had pushed him away, told him to go to his party, there was a good reason for it. Of course by ‘good’ reason John meant ‘very, very bad, underhanded, idiotic plan to get into loads of trouble’ reason.
He looked at John’s chest. He was wearing a t-shirt, The Who, one of John’s favourites, faded and worn. He remembered the vest that had been strapped there last night. He remembered his own hands shaking as he undid the fastenings. He couldn’t pull it off fast enough. He’d actually yanked John’s shoulder hard enough to hurt as he ripped off the coat.
Seeing his brother like this—trying to hold on to John—he felt the familiar constriction in his chest. It was the same one he’d felt in the helicopter, when Sherlock shot Magnussen in the head.
Sherlock's eyes flew open. The room was cold. His body was warm. No blanket. Doctor. He was in the exact position he'd been in a moment ago in his mind: tangled up in John. He was instantly surrounded by his scent, absent from the dream but thick around him now. John: his soap, wool, toast and tea, and something colder too, like gunmetal, like risk. That cool, thrilling undertone beneath all of the warmth and comfort was the reason John wasn't boring—John's layers, his contradictions.
“Considering your average typing speed I wouldn’t be surprised if your whole arm had gone septic by the time you finished.”
. What kind of question is that? What does it have to do with Amy’s death? Who the hell are you anyway? Do you even work for the police?”
“Nevertheless,” Mycroft cut him off, “he’s made a rather bad habit out of inconveniencing people.” He frowned checking his Rolex and Lestrade knew he was referring to himself. “I’m afraid I’ll have to ask you to come here again tomorrow afternoon. Let’s say one o’clock? I have a few words to say to Sherlock when he comes round. I’d be very much obliged if you were present to hear them too.”
John kept his eyes moving between the stripper and the detective. He had to appreciate the exceptional circumstance of being at a strip club with Sherlock Holmes. Even a Sherlock who was not remotely paying attention was an extraordinarily out-of-place figure at a pole-dancing performance.
John made an effort not to laugh. Instead said sceptically, “So what I’m hearing is you need a maid. And possibly an accountant.”
Slowed heart rate, excessive vasodilation (widening of the blood vessels), loss of elasticity in red blood cells causing them to clump together and move sluggishly, not delivering oxygen fast enough. Fairly straightforward precursors to shock, the potentially fatal panicking and eventual failure of the body’s circulatory system.
“Don’t be ridiculous, John, it would be impossible to wire the entire cemetery. It would be too obvious. People would—” John was grinning widely and Sherlock stopped. “That was a joke, wasn’t it.”
The experiment was simple. John had to believe Sherlock was dead in requirement with the plan to defeat Moriarty. Sherlock would merely allow John to continue to think so. His hypothesis was that given enough time John would get over his infatuation with Sherlock’s work and crime-fighting lifestyle in favour of settling down to a quieter life. Because didn't Sherlock believe the worst about people, and didn't he like to push them toward it? Don’t we all do our best to fulfil our own pessimistic prophesies?
He lifted himself up off of his detective (a certain section of his mind kicking and screaming in protest) and stood. He offered his hand to Sherlock, who took it, and once he was standing the flush around his neck was even more apparent, and even more appealing, and John had to remind himself of the effort it had taken to get them both upright to prevent him from knocking Sherlock back down.
“I’ve told you so many times! I thought I would lose you if he told you about me! I didn’t want you to leave. I wanted-”
There must be a wasp nest he could step on, or something better he could do than listen to his lesbian sister give him a lecture about sexuality.
Sherlock snapped his head back to give John one of his severest glares, but stopped. The adrenaline from the fight subsiding, he’d regained enough peripheral awareness to notice his surroundings again. They had moved a considerable distance from the path and were now quite close to the edge of the cliff. (They would have been worryingly close if anyone's mother had been there to worry about it.)
“The bullet was meant for you,” Moran continued. “We thought it would be fitting for the poison expert to die of a poison he couldn’t remedy. The final failed challenge. But it’s a rather pretty twist of fate that John took it for you. Moriarty couldn’t have been more pleased. This way, you get to watch the one person you”—he paused suggestively—“live with, die before we kill you. A psychological death followed by the physical one. It’s perfect because I think we both know that the psychological death is far, far worse.”
back—and it would be just the two of them again like it had been before he died, before Mary… Just the two of them against the rest of the world. This—this moment—was everything he had thought about: out in London in the night, hot on the trail, new evidence, case nearly solved, John at his side, laughing,
“I’m not going to spend the whole night trying to stop Sherlock from being Sherlock,” John continued.
Sherlock had told him once. No, they would still play the game; that wouldn’t change. In fact, there might even be little visible difference to those who knew them. Because they were right; they were all right: Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade, Sally, Irene Adler, all of his girlfriends, even Moriarty and Magnussen and Moran. He was Sherlock’s boyfriend. He’d been Sherlock’s boyfriend since the night they’d run through the alleys after the serial killer cabbie, forgetting his pain, his loneliness, his past, as Sherlock pulled him into his world and asked him, without ever asking him, to stay.
“The point is it hardly matters if he's dead or alive,” Sherlock continued. “He would have arranged his plans to be carried out by someone within his circle. If he didn't come back from the roof that day his plans would still go forward.”
“He died somewhere else,” Sherlock concluded, jumping to his feet in an outright age-defying manner. (No man over thirty should be able to hold a crouched position for that long and then leap to his feet as lithely as a child.) “He was dragged here and then stabbed in order to make it look like a mugging. The position of the body was the first clue.”
Mrs. Hudson also seemed to be one of the better dancers on the floor. John supposed it wasn't entirely surprising, considering she
John crossed from the window to sit down in his chair. He would have to think like Sherlock if he was going to figure this one out.
Sherlock stared at the page in amazement. His infuriating older brother had anticipated everything. He had been at the hospital. He’d known. He’d seen exactly how it would play out with John, right up to Sherlock being here, looking for cigarettes, and searching his desk before the bookcase. It was only at times when he was forced to interact with Mycroft that Sherlock got the smallest glimpse of why ordinary people hated him so vehemently.
“Didn’t,” she repeated, face dropping a bit. “We’d gone from the restaurant to a bar and it was quite late when I got a call from my brother.”
Finally he heard the door to the lifts open and when he looked around the pillar it was Moran walking into the garage. He was certain. He’d memorised his picture from the web page. He was alone. Perfect.
John’s hand skimmed from the scar lightly across his chest and he heard Sherlock’s breath hitch. The effect of the drug, he knew, would intensify the touch. Sherlock’s chest was smooth, virtually hairless. John didn’t think he had ever seen Sherlock with facial hair either. The detective was meticulous about shaving and also (John had been amused to note) just not very good at growing facial hair.
And then he knew. He had seen that expression on Sherlock’s face only twice before today. The first time he’d been standing beside a swimming pool. The second time he’d been on his back in the grass, on Guy Fawkes Night.
Kissing Sherlock was like nothing he had ever experienced. How could a person with such hard angles have such soft lips? His coat and hair smelled like the night air, cold and sharp. John let his tongue graze the edge of Sherlock’s lips and Sherlock parted them for him, allowing John to slip his tongue inside, meeting Sherlock’s and feeling a heady rush at the taste of him. The scent of him, the taste—it was overpowering and he needed more; he had to get closer though there wasn’t any space between them. He found himself undoing Sherlock’s suit jacket and running his hands up his sides and around to his back.
Thick, course hair combed back, silvering dark brown: bold confidence excludes the need for hair dye. Successful military career. Ex-colonel. Married. New mistress approximately every four months. Cunning: deep understanding of human behaviour translates to great skill in manipulation. The dangerous kind of amoral. Certainly on the psychopathy scale. Regular brandy drinker and cards player reveals old-fashioned conservatism. Compulsively organised. Fiercely competitive. Devoutly materialistic.
“Taylor?” John muttered to Sherlock as they crossed the crowded floor, knowing he wouldn’t be heard over the music.
John turned onto a dark, quiet side street. He was always amazed that such a thing could exist in the centre of London. Even somewhere between Piccadilly and Westminster there were empty streets, sheltered from the noisy throngs of tourists just a few blocks over, all herding up and down the same narrow routes.
Another murder, another investigation. He knew beyond doubt that Sherlock never would have made it this far if it wasn’t for John. John had not only saved Sherlock’s life, he’d also given Sherlock something to live for.
“Yes, I’m sure he would have responded nicely if the doctor had simply asked him to leave, don’t you think?”
Sherlock drew the second sheet of paper from the envelope and balked. It was a page torn out of a book. Eighteen lines of text. It was a poem.
“Not last night,” Mary corrected. She’d been surprised to find in the visiting records (confidential unless you knew where to look) that Sherlock had not been in John’s room since Monday night. But then she supposed that was Sherlock; he wouldn’t have the patience for sitting by a coma patient.
It was the fact that he still wanted her phone, even after John told him it had been wiped clean that prevented John from trying again to tell Sherlock she was dead. Because it was
For John it was stating the obvious, but with Sherlock you could never be sure. He would do anything himself for a case.
“No,” Mycroft said casually, “if you, or any of you, so much as touch Sherlock again”—he flipped a lighter out of his pocket and bent to their eyelevel—“I’ll light you on fire.”
John shrugged. “Well, the wedding wasn’t important enough to attend; I don’t know why the divorce should matter.”
“Do you know any of these men?” Sherlock asked quickly, holding his phone down under the table where they’d placed their empty drink glasses. He swiped through the pictures of David Rodgers, Neil Parker, Brandon Riley, and Tony Bauer. John knew the pictures would be necessary for Alexa to recognise them if the men didn’t use their real names for 'appointments.'
“Yes,” she said. The skip of her eyes toward the phone had barely been visible. John couldn’t help feeling like he was in one of those dreams where you're on stage in the middle of a play and you're the only one who doesn't know the lines. She flicked aside half of his shirt with the knife and teased him with the blade. Perhaps Lestrade had a point. There
Sherlock pried his eyes open and looked from one arm to the other. He was vaguely surprised to see a patch on each arm. “Nope,” he said languidly, “forgot about the other one.”
Sherlock tightened his grip on John’s sleeve and shook his head as determinedly as his sluggish movements would allow. He reached for his phone and after a moment of typing John’s phone chimed again.
She wasn’t listening. “You’re quite tall,” she grinned at Sherlock, reaching out to touch his knee. He jerked it back.
“Well, come in,” Tony said, opening the door wider. “I’ll have a quick look round and maybe I can find it.”
Irene Adler was gay. She was living with a woman when they met her; she liked women. But she’d fallen in love with Sherlock. And she had assumed that John, straight, had done the same. She was gay and he was straight, but
“Well, that’s optimistic.” He took Sherlock’s hand and stumbled forward when he stood up. Sherlock caught him at the upper-arms.
The physical exertion combined with the breath-taking scenery gave John a natural high which worked wonders on his nerves. He’d been so achingly stressed in the final weeks with Mary; now he felt the tension leaving his body. He imagined his negative feelings falling away from him as he ran, and he came back to the hotel each day feeling lighter than ever. He used to run to keep in training, back in his university rugby days, and he liked the feeling of getting back to it.
He thought about Sherlock as he walked the half-mile back toward the car park. He wondered if Sherlock had returned from Switzerland yet, and tried to imagine his reaction upon finding the flat sparkling clean and himself missing. He’d be furious about the flat, of course, and it wouldn’t take him long to discover where John had gone. Being flatmates with the world’s only consulting detective meant little opportunity for secrecy.
Manipulative bastard. He’d done this as a way of balancing the lie—weakening Sherlock’s justification for being angry with him. Rubbish older brother, blocking Mary from John’s room. Sherlock might even get him a Christmas gift for this.
“What?” the driver snapped. “Can’t I just what? Use my mental bloody superpowers to clear the streets?”
And Sherlock was looking at him, breathing heavily, eyes questioning, unsure, waiting, and suddenly John wanted to do none of those things. He moved forward and ran his left hand through Sherlock’s hair, gently tangling his fingers in the curls at the back. With his right hand he held the side of Sherlock’s face.
“You may also be interested to know that the girl who died in the car crash—Amy Elliot—has traces of the poison in her blood.”
Assuming Sherlock hadn’t spontaneously gone violently insane (still not a possibility to entirely rule out), there was a logical reason why he needed samples of their blood. He would be testing them for something. Had Moran injected Sherlock with more than just heroin last night? John felt his throat constrict, suddenly aware of the effort involved in both breathing and swallowing.
“Does it matter if they see us?” John asked, keeping his voice low. He didn’t have to whisper. Sherlock was so close, practically on top of him. “They’re just a bunch of drunk teenagers, and we have masks.”
Breathing hard he tried to steady his thoughts. This was everything he’d ever wanted. He had it here, now, wide-eyed underneath him, but still he had to know why—
Mycroft Holmes seemed less terrifying now in the daylight than he had been late the night before, but still not someone to be trifled with. Just the fact that Sherlock was allowing this man to scold him, uninterrupted, for such a length of time was shocking enough to keep Lestrade quiet.
John coughed and his face flushed again. So, not ‘police partners’ then. What the hell was it with every single person they’d ever met? What was it about the two of them together that made everyone and his mother (and grandmother apparently) think they were
“It’s six, and we’re leaving,” Sherlock replied. He was already dressed, hair done (curls arranged fashionably messy), and he had his hands full of John’s shirts.
John glared. "Sherlock, this is serious. It's going to be humiliating when I step all over her feet."
It was senseless. Random. Meningitis. Dangerous swelling of the brain. The severity of the case was rare in England. A freak occurrence. She was only fifteen.
“Sorry, but three years is a bit optimistic. No one could live a month at Baker Street without losing his sheep.”
“You’re both very attractive,” she purred, lifting her hands and running them through John’s hair. “Such a shame that you’re cops."
Sherlock grabbed fistfuls of John’s hoodie in return and shook him once hard. “Did you hear what I said? I did it for
Sherlock halted in his tracks. Dazed vision sharpened into focus as he dragged himself from the rushing torrent of his thoughts back into reality. His legs had taken him exactly where he needed to go.
“Yeah, I’m fine. It was just…” He exhaled heavily. The moon cast enough light for Sherlock to see traces of perspiration around his temples, lines of tension in his face.
He leaned down, sliding his hip down to lower himself. His eyes swept Sherlock’s face, beautiful in the half-dark. Lightly, he pressed his lips to Sherlock’s. They were soft, partly open, perfect. John shut his eyes and kissed him again, wanting the firm pressure to answer Sherlock’s question.
As much as he hated to give his addict (or, what was it Sherlock had called it? 'Occasional user’) brother a drug like morphine, he felt he’d made the right decision. In this circumstance it was undoubtedly preferable to have Sherlock sedated in a controlled environment than it was to leave him up to his own devices.
Suddenly something shifted in John’s expression. If he'd been worried that John might start tearing off his clothes, he realised, as John ran his hand back through Sherlock’s hair almost caressingly, that he needn’t have been. John tightened his grip on his hair and pulled back gently, causing a highly pleasurable sensation that shot directly to Sherlock’s groin. Sherlock’s eyes locked onto John’s as John cupped his face, and when he kissed him again it was completely different.
John looked over at him and smiled ruefully. “No, thanks, Sherlock. I’m fine. Have to get some sleep before my shift…”
This was the reason why Sherlock had to go in for the psych test and Mycroft hadn’t. Mycroft had the wherewithal to pretend to empathise, to pretend to care about other people. Sherlock didn’t have the patience. His psych test came back labelling him a ‘high-functioning sociopath’ and their mother had cried. Sherlock didn’t understand. He was only six years old at the time.
He couldn’t fight sleep any longer. He felt his hand slipping down from Sherlock’s chest as he lost the ability to hold on. Sherlock gripped him harder but John could barely feel it. He was vaguely aware of Sherlock’s curls brushing his face as his eyes fell shut.
John caught the ball and raced forward. He made it the few metres to the halfway line before an opponent slammed into him. On the ground, with heavy bodies strewn over him, he managed to scrabble the ball out to his teammate. The crush of weight pressing him to the grass lifted and John sprang to his feet, darting back into position.
"Not necessary. All research today. All boring. Well, for you anyway." And with a sweep of his coat he was gone.
“Fuck off,” John said, suddenly feeling more tired than anything. He turned his back on the detective and crossed to the other side of the small field in the park they used as a rugby pitch every Saturday. His gym bag was the only one left and John slung it over his shoulder as he walked to the path leading out of the clearing. Sherlock had taken a more direct route and was waiting for him by the trees at the edge of the path.
He shoved the thought aside. He could ignore the impulse. It was harder now that he was aware of it, but as long as John didn’t touch him again, he could do it. He had mastered the art of ignoring. People, things, thoughts, feelings, he could ignore them all.
“If you’re interested in the fate of Mr. Tony Bauer I can tell you he’s safe for the time being. His blood sample tested negative. No poison.”
Really real TAB spoilers this time. A Johnlock argument of events. In other words, all the spoilers.
“It’s obvious,” Sherlock said, because it was his favourite thing to say. “Just look at the wound.” He lifted the man’s shirt and gestured to the mark as though it were sufficient explanation.
Mrs. Hudson grinned from ear to ear. “Oh, wonderful! John, thank you.” She took his hand and pressed it affectionately. “You certainly won’t have to dance. Just being as handsome and charming as you are will be more than enough.”
John looked at Sherlock strangely. "I was joking. I don't really think she'll dump me over it. The whole thing would just be a lot less painful if I knew what I was doing."
A slew of memories from the past week seeped from his subconscious to his conscious mind: John, leaning back against the wall on the street for support, lightheaded; John, stumbling out of his bed in the morning, off balance; John leaning against the building outside the strip club, dizzy; John standing up quickly after crouching in the cemetery, stumbling again, off balance; John, now, dizzy, almost falling backward…
Sitting at his desk he felt a dull pain in his left hip and shoulder and knew he must be sleeping on his left side on the floor. His legs were warm and his chest was warm; perhaps John had thrown a blanket over him. He stood up from the desk. He'd done enough work for the time being; he might as well wake up.
Sherlock looked up at the man. “Pleased to make your acquaintance,” he slurred, trying to blink his vision clear.
John’s eyes glanced down over Sherlock, sitting on the couch beneath him, skin still damp from his wet shirt, and John wondered, not for the first time, if there wasn’t some part of him that could be attracted to his flatmate. He would be lying if he said there hadn’t been the occasional dream… The memory of pulling Sherlock up against the bars of the railing (one hand handcuffed to the mad detective and the other gripping the lapel of his coat) somehow morphing so that when Sherlock ducked his head, looking at him through the metal rails and through thick lashes, instead of turning his head John pulled Sherlock harder into the bars, into a bruising kiss…
“Think, John,” Sherlock said, deep voice automatically ensnaring John’s attention, forcing his eyes back to Sherlock’s and holding them there.
you self-important snob. I choose to do less demanding work with better hours so that I'm more available to
He knew what it was, that sense of uneasiness. It was a memory. The memory of the last time Sherlock had agreed to do what John asked too quickly.
The clever part, he supposed, was that the chemicals in the poison rendered the body unresponsive to vasoactive drugs: his blood vessels wouldn’t respond to vasopressors (the medications that would constrict his blood vessels and help raise his blood pressure) and his heart wouldn’t respond to inotropes (the medications that would support the strength of his heartrate). Like triggering a bizarre kind of stasis in his vascular system, the poison had made it resistant to interference via any conventional methods.
There had never been a good category in his mind for Sherlock. ‘Best friend’ had to do simply because there was nothing else to describe it. But after the age of twelve John had never had a ‘best friend.’ Friends were people like Stamford, or his rugby mates: people to see on occasion, to laugh with over beers. Bizarrely, despite his heterosexuality and their complete lack of physical intimacy, Sherlock had always been more like a lover than anything else. Their cohabitation, their attunement to each other’s rhythms, their jokes, their bickering and their fights, their practically shared finances, their mutual need for each other, the fierce protectiveness and loyalty Sherlock inspired in him, the electricity between them—it was nothing like a friend. Even ‘best friend’ fell short of whatever their connection was.
The cab ride home was a giddy affair. Mrs. Hudson was overjoyed to have her boys back together in 221B, and she was in the highest of spirits in the wake of the ball. Sherlock had turned out to be a spectacular dancer; she had received compliments on their dancing all night. The evening couldn't have been more of a success. She sat backward in the cab gleefully watching the doctor and the detective struggling on the seat across from her.
“Released yesterday. Your antidote worked perfectly. We were able to get him the injection in time. I must admit it was a rather clever bit of chemistry you managed.”
She scrambled for her purse under Sherlock's icy stare, and John took comfort in knowing that if she was indeed a regular reader of his blog, at least she couldn't be caught off guard by Sherlock's behaviour.
He lost himself in the slide of tongues, the heat beneath his hands radiating through the detective's thin shirt. This was Sherlock. Lean muscles,
“Sherlock!” Moran’s voice was pleased. “Congratulations on winning the match last night, with a little help from your friend of course. How is Dr. Watson?”
“Oh, brilliant, yeah, nice one.” John pushed past him, pacing the space between their chairs. Sherlock watched him, feeling his control of the exchange slipping as confusion trickled through his mind. As with most injuries on pale skin, the bruises made it look worse than it was. As a doctor, John should know that. He’d meant to irritate him about Mrs. Hudson. The intensity of this reaction was… unexpected.
clothes, not to mention the exorbitant cost of such a practice) had been enough to make John grit his teeth and go himself.
, John thought: The quickest, most efficient, most sociopathic way to get what they needed. John took a deep breath. He should have seen it coming. What other solution could Sherlock Holmes possibly come up with for this particular dilemma? It was fast, effective, cold, and utterly lacking in empathy.
“And why would someone stab him if he was already dead?” Lestrade asked, doing his best to pry more information from the consulting detective who did far more smug withholding than helpful consulting. Lack of competition. That was the problem. The world (namely Scotland Yard) was suffering from an acute shortage of consulting detectives.
He looked back toward the living room. He would have liked to at least change into his pyjama trousers first, but Sherlock didn’t seem interested in letting go of his arm. John sighed inwardly. In truth he was exhausted, and flopping down into bed—any bed—didn’t seem like such a bad idea.
“John, I’m sorry. I should have been faster; I should have known sooner. I don’t deserve to have you back but I’m asking you to come back anyway because I’m spoilt and selfish and I need you. There. I’ve said it. I need you. I’m sure it was obvious anyway but now I’ve said it. So...”
He walked slowly through the first row of cars, observing where the cameras were just out of the corner of his eye. He wove through the row and stepped behind a pillar. A blind spot. There was no camera facing his direction. He could get Moran as he came through the door. He checked his watch. Seven o’clock. Moran’s last appointment would just be ending. He was proud of himself for having gotten so far without the genius of deduction at his side, though he wished Sherlock were with him anyway.
John let go of the spoon he was using to stir his coffee, round and round the cup, creating a small whirlpool. Harry was looking at him sternly. As though
John's eyes were heavy and Sherlock's warmth, his slow and steady breathing, was lulling him back to sleep. But what to do about the current flatmate tangle situation? John knew if he moved at all Sherlock would wake. He assumed this was not a desirable outcome, considering his knowledge of consulting detectives not to be the cuddliest sort.
“According to these results he received the poison just over two weeks ago. I would estimate sometime between the seventh and the tenth of October.”
He circled the grand piano as he made his way from the living room to Mycroft’s office and back again. Of course Mycroft’s flat was large enough to contain a grand piano. (Sherlock hadn’t heard him play in a long time, but under duress he would admit that his brother had more talent than even the most revered of the modern pianists, though he never played in public. It was their mother’s greatest joy when she could guilt trip the two of them into playing together, and they made sure to do it as seldom as possible.)
These thoughts were not new. He’d been left alone with them once before. A week in prison. Solitary confinement. They’d driven him mad. Mad enough upon his release that it had taken sleeping pills and then painkillers and eventually heroin to silence the voices that tormented his waking hours.
“Such confidence.” Alexa stood up and moved over to give Sherlock his share of the lap dance. “What makes you so sure?”
Sherlock shot him a glare and John licked his lips—a longstanding habit of the doctor’s, but Sherlock had never remembered it being so distracting.
“Why yes, Sherlock, that’s just the thing I need right now. It’ll be a great distraction from my impending divorce.” John glared at the empty chair. “It’s so kind of you to not completely forget about me at a time like this.”
John went back to the window now, running his fingers over the dressing he’d just finished on his own hand. He knew his flatmate’s erratic behaviour was a direct result of that phone call. He suppressed a shiver. Sherlock’s expression—colour drained from his face, eyes unblinking, shallow breathing.
John was glad he hadn’t tried to guess. He turned around and Sherlock must have seen the mixture of confusion and concern on his face because he rolled his eyes and said, “Oh come on, you must have noticed the board behind the front desk?” John continued to look at him blankly and Sherlock explained, with the longsuffering air of one doomed to be forever explaining, “It’s covered in pictures of corgis. The receptionist owns two herself. It was an elementary deduction that she’d be understanding about the necessity of an early departure owing to a corgi-related crisis.”
He felt Sherlock shiver beneath him but John held him steady as he kissed his way down Sherlock’s carotid artery to the base of his neck. When he sunk his teeth in there, not hard enough to hurt but hard enough, Sherlock’s hips arched involuntarily and John groaned at the sensation. Sherlock’s arousal was as obvious as his own. Not good for public places.
The boy was not surprised to see him there, and he returned his attention to what looked like a pen in his hand. He pointed it toward a line of ants on the ground. He pressed a button and trained the thin laser light on a specific ant until it burned. He did the same to the next.
He had always thought it would be enough—that he would be satisfied if he and John could just live together and work together, coexisting in the kind of odd balance that worked for them, the deep-seated friendship that kept them so strongly bonded together. But tonight he had discovered it wasn’t. The scent of John, the weight of him, his warmth, his sturdy presence… His flatmate’s physicality was becoming impossible to ignore the way he used to.
John pushed aside Sherlock’s unbuttoned coat and reached into the inner pocket of his jacket. It never seemed to occur to Sherlock how intimate it was: the way he was always asking John to get things from his pockets.
He thought grimly that Moriarty and Moran had really outdone themselves this time. John’s death would paralyse him, they knew that, but they’d taken it even one step further. Because if John died of poison, not only Sherlock’s area of expertise but his point of pride— He couldn’t imagine a more decisive way to destroy him. He agreed with Moran wholeheartedly on this one: If John died of a poison Sherlock couldn’t save him from, he would not need to be told twice to jump off a building. No landing gear this time. No tricks. He would be more than happy to meet the pavement.
Sherlock put his hand on John’s arm, below the wound, and tugged him sharply toward the sink. John glared, and Sherlock took the opportunity to start cleaning the cut.
"Sorry I'm late," John said, walking up to where Sherlock was standing still. "Here, take this." He brusquely shoved a small brown paper sleeve into Sherlock's hand, not meeting his eyes.
“You know how he is,” Mrs. Hudson was saying. “Would you mind—would it be all right if you still plan to come? You know how Sherlock forgets about these things. You could come in case he has to run off at the last minute, or you know, in case he doesn’t.”
John stormed up the stairs to his bedroom. A short while later, when he came down again, fully dressed, Sherlock was sitting with his back to him working at his laptop. John didn't say a word as he grabbed his jacket and opened the door, and Sherlock didn't turn around.
Sherlock frowned. “Unless we all missed it. Perhaps there was something more important on the news that day. New photoset of the royal babies or something. That would be embarrassing.”
It occurred to John that he and Sherlock had always been connected by scars. His own wound had brought him back to London and prevented him from being able to live anywhere but 221B, Baker Street. And now Sherlock’s had brought him back again.
So, at the age of sixteen, Mycroft looked down with clear eyes at his nine-year-old brother and said, “No, Sherlock, I don’t love you.”
“You have been vulnerable since that night in Brixton, and your enemies know it. Surely you must understand that the logic evaporates if you are
The couples took their places on the floor, and John desperately ran through everything Sherlock had taught him when he'd been preparing for his wedding. The song would be a waltz, Mrs. Avery kindly informed him. He knew he could manage all right if he could just remember the steps.
He rolled his shoulders to stretch them and sighed. As always in these situations Lestrade wished he had something more useful he could at least appear to be doing, rather than helplessly waiting on Sherlock’s every whim. As the years went by it had become more and more tempting to just throw in the towel and bring a book to the crime scenes. But he hadn’t given up yet. Each time he allowed Sherlock free reign of an area, he crossed his arms and managed to maintain his dignity by snapping at Sherlock to hurry up and barking orders at everyone else.
Taking advantage of this open-door policy, John quietly peered into the room. Sherlock was there, asleep, sprawled on his stomach with the duvet hitting just the middle of his bare back, strikingly pale against the green sheets.
This wasn’t working. He needed John’s responses to centre his thought processes. And for some inconvenient reason, only John’s. All other voices were grating to his ears: either too high or too loud or too nasally or too fast or too slow or too mumbling or too stupid. Vile people and their witless cadences, ugly and full of the ignorant sort of arrogance people effuse whenever they speak about things they don’t understand, which is always. But not John.
They reached the car park and it occurred to Sherlock to mention, “Someone ransacked the flat while we were away.”
“Oh, er, hi,” Tony said, looking confused. He was, unfortunately, fully clothed, wearing jogging bottoms and a hoodie.
The drug Sherlock invented for John had worked. It had stopped the progression of the poison and had acted as a catalyst to allow John’s body to begin healing itself. Mycroft had ordered Sherlock’s notes brought to him from the lab. It was nothing short of incredible what his brother had been able to do in a span of seventy-two hours. The imagination he’d used in selecting chemicals, the balancing reactions: beautifully intricate equations, intriguingly experimental mixtures.
“The infamous Frederick Davis case, 1902. Triple homicide: wife and children. He was acquitted due to lack of evidence. Apparently the inspectors handling the case were about eight years old; at least that seems to be the only probable explanation for such shoddy detective work.”
Perhaps Lestrade would be able to trace the drug deal back through Sherlock’s murder. He very much doubted it. Moran would clean up his tracks well. Like the other poison-deaths they had been investigating, his murder would be staged to look like something else. They would arrange it to look like a junkie shot him while he was trespassing through boarded up warehouses. Lestrade wouldn’t be bright enough to figure it out. And John…
He couldn’t kill Moriarty; Moriarty was already dead. It had taken Sherlock Holmes to kill him, and it would take Sherlock Holmes to stop the aftershock too—the waves rippling through England that the consulting criminal had put in motion before he died.
Yet as absorbed with his work as Sherlock seemed, John thought he could sense Sherlock’s gaze on him whenever he closed his eyes, or whenever he walked back to the bedroom. And the weight of it was heavy in a way that made John’s heartrate quicken.
Happy New Year and happy Abominable Bride watching! If the next chapter's not up on Monday you may assume I've fallen into a Victorian Homles-and-Watson induced swoon, and will be out of commission (probably babbling about needing a blond-haired, blue-eyed army doctor) for the foreseeable future.
And yet… Sherlock stopped pacing and leaned back against the doorjamb between the living room and kitchen. He folded his arms and looked down at the floor, black hair falling into his eyes (remember to get haircut) …And yet, just because he was happy about it didn’t mean John would be. It was another thing in John’s life wrecked and Sherlock had no idea what to do about it.
Sherlock was the better detective; of course Lestrade knew that. He’d have to be as thick as Sherlock assumed he was not to understand that. That’s why he continued to call him in. At the end of the day catching the murderer was more important than pride. He just had to grit his teeth through the investigation and count backward in his head to keep himself from kicking the world’s most brilliant detective square in the arse.
It’s a moving experience to watch Sherlock Holmes at a crime scene. It doesn’t matter how many times he’s done it before, John is never bored. It’s like watching a performance. Flawless. Art heightened to precision. And Sherlock is elegant. He walks slowly, seemingly casual, but John knows it’s controlled. Carefully controlled. Because Sherlock’s energy is electric and John can feel the hum of it in the air. The detective’s bright eyes sweep the scene, reading invisible information. He’s completely engaged; he’s fascinating.
While she waited for him to wake up, she dug into her bag and pulled out her phone. A few clever stokes over the screen and a few would-be top secret codes and she was into the hospital’s system. John’s file downloaded within a few seconds. (The ‘security’ at such a ‘secure’ hospital could stand to be improved, not that the holes in the system weren’t currently working to her advantage.) She needed more than the terse, clipped responses the nurses had given her—all they were willing to provide to someone who wasn't immediate family.
“What did you take?” There was a sharpness in his voice that seemed to get Sherlock’s unfocused gaze to clear momentarily.
Sherlock did not want to talk about the previous night. He did not want to explain why he’d asked John to stay in his room. He did not want to have to talk to John about finding a new flat. Because he’d thought about it all day, in the back of his mind, and the unavoidable conclusion was that Moriarty was right.
Sherlock didn’t stir when he entered and Mycroft knew that was the morphine, providing him with a numb, dreamless sleep.
“You know it’s fine,” John said from where he was finishing his dinner at the kitchen table, “if you say that when it’s just the two of us here. But I hope you haven’t forgotten our discussion about not calling things that kill people ‘delightful.’ At least not in front of sane people.”
“Could be a skill that comes up in personal life,” John offered, voice slightly tentative as he saw a rare opportunity to question Sherlock further about said mysterious personal life.
And suddenly there was heat around his left wrist. A glowing band of heat and soft pressure that shot feeling up his arm and through to his chest. Real heat, not dream mimicry, but real sensation. It flooded through him, rushing solidity and presence into what had been fading. He held his arm out in front of him. There was nothing there, but it felt like someone had wrapped an electric warmer around it. Was it possible—was Sherlock holding his wrist?
There was a tap at the door and the server set down their respective drinks on the table between the chairs. When the door had clicked shut again she tossed off the dressing gown entirely and cast her gaze down as if to indicate her own figure.
“So that explains the request this morning for an exhumation warrant on three completely unrelated graves,” Lestrade said, walking closer to look at the pictures of the bodies. “You think these people were poisoned too.”
Sherlock seemed satisfied by this, because he disappeared into the bathroom. Exhaustion hit John like a wave, and soon he was drifting toward sleep, lulled by the sound of the water from the shower.
. Already sent out an alert to the morgues. We’ll hear about it if another one turns up with the same pattern. But in the meantime…”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock said with unaffected expression. John felt the deep register of his voice resonate in his chest. “I should have told you I was alive.”
Because the truth was, Sherlock had lied. And he had really hoped he’d never have to explain his actual reason for allowing John to think he was dead.
Actually, John's expression while he danced was remarkably similar to the one he had worn the night Sherlock had been bored enough to google 'Martha Hudson,' and shown John the resulting clips of her former exotic dancing days.
John cleared his plate and came to stand behind Sherlock’s chair. “How does it work then?” he asked.
John said slowly, controlling his voice, “Do you mean that you called me away from Emily’s this morning to
John swallowed hard. Dreams of it, fleeting and opaque, had haunted his subconscious since the day they’d met and the gorgeous scientist in the lab had made his head swim, a phenomenon that had only allowed him to be half-interested in the women he'd dated while Sherlock was still alive: vibrant and demanding and overwhelming, absorbing John so completely there had never been room for anyone else. And now, conscious of it in the way he’d never been, the way he’d never allowed himself to be, the desire slammed into him hard enough to make his chest ache. Oh god, Harry was right. All his life he'd only ever been interested in women, and then he'd met Sherlock: Improbably beautiful, magnetic, exceptional, and more importantly, the exception. The exception to everything. Even just the thought of Sherlock’s skin beneath his hands, the heady taste of his mouth, of Sherlock lying back and
game like Cluedo then?” John said, delighted in having seized this opportunity. “Since it’s much too infantile for a mind like yours.”
“Crucial, yes crucial,” Sherlock muttered dismissively, using his phone again to record the numbers. “Keep your arm still.”
"That's right!" Hannah smiled, apparently willing to ignore that half of what Sherlock said was rather insulting. She had frozen with her purse on her lap and was gazing at the detective. She seemed to have forgotten what she was doing as she witnessed, John assumed, her favourite character in action. But receiving no reciprocal smile she quickly resumed digging in her purse. She pulled out her phone.
Sherlock sighed dramatically. He tossed the journal onto the coffee table and sat up. He took the bags with a scowl and went off to put them in his closet. John smirked. He looked over at the article Sherlock had been reading; it was about circulatory shock.
“Your socks are the same colour,” Sherlock said, glancing at John before turning to look up at the roof of the building.
John mentally pulled him toward the door. (If Sherlock could read his mind, John decided he might as well use it to his advantage.) Sherlock didn’t resist, and only paused to say, “Thank you, Mrs. Bennis, you’ve been most helpful,” before following John out of the flat.
Sherlock blinked at his brother, the room was swimming before him, circles and pricks of light dotted his vision.
“Bunch of teenagers. We saw them run the other way. I don’t think they’ll be back.” Sometimes John surprised himself by how much smoother he’d got at lying. But he supposed he’d had plenty of time to learn from the best.
Sherlock had figured that as a successfully (at least for the most part) retired assassin, Mary would be able to balance him. John would continue to work on cases with Sherlock, and the rest of the time Mary would do the mundane things with John that Sherlock couldn’t—like going to the cinema, and cooking dinners, and seeing people in social situations. Sex too, he supposed, due to his own aversion to it and John’s rather frequent yelling about not being gay.
John, in turn, had removed his jumper, his long-sleeved button-up, and was now down to a black t-shirt.
“I think you know enough about me. Now, you may drink your drinks, and I’ll give you a little dance.”
“All right,” John said, taken aback by Sherlock’s sudden sincerity. “So it’s settled then. I’ll move back in.” John finished the last swallow of whisky and set the glass down. He checked his watch; it was past eleven already. “I’ll just go unpack.” He stood up, and slung the duffel bag over his shoulder.
As Sherlock watched Moriarty snorkel away he almost envied ordinary people who must have inane dreams about flying or being late for their school exams or whatever. Almost.
in those days. They even arrested him one night for making a scene at the Yard. He’d slept in a cell overnight and gone home only slightly subdued the next day.
Sherlock walked swiftly to the bed, avoiding looking at the person in it as he snatched the chart off its clip. He scanned the information. Yes, yes it was all correct. John’s body had responded to the antidote—it had halted the deterioration of his circulatory system and redirected his body to heal itself. There were improvements: steady heartrate, blood pressure still low but approaching normal numbers. But the injection had been late. Sherlock knew that. Like a knife in his chest he knew that. John’s body had already shut down by the time he got it. Coma: the body's the final, desperate method of conserving energy in order to heal from trauma. He was stabilised now, but comas like this one were unpredictable. John could wake up in an hour or a year or never. He had been here like this since Friday night and Sherlock hadn’t known. Mycroft had lied to him.
crucial information you’re getting from these measurements,” John said louder, watching Sherlock walk over the coffee table to stand on the other side of the room.
John had the briefest glimpse of what it must have been like to be Mycroft, and felt a sudden, bizarre pang of sympathy for the man.
you!” He clapped his hands together. “Just look at this!” He spread them wide. “The chaos, the wreckage! I couldn’t have caused this much damage even if I’d tortured you.” He dragged his eyes over Sherlock at the word ‘torture’ as though he might like to have at him now.
It hadn’t taken long to get used to John though. He was reserved, not overly warm and friendly, but nice enough. Adjusting to Sherlock looking at someone with that expression was much harder.
John’s replaying of the argument was cut off by a vicious swipe of claws across his shin, which thankfully was protected by denim. The other cat, Bonkers, had appeared and when John looked down at the kitchen floor he saw both cats glaring up at him. A flash of hatred shocked through him. He didn’t like cats. He’d never liked these cats and they’d never liked him. But he’d put up with them because they were Mary’s; because he’d loved her. Now he briefly fantasized chucking Bonkers out the window like a discus.
She was fifteen and she was pretty and her laugh made him smile when almost nothing else did. She was clever and she teased him and she held his hand and one day outside of a café she kissed him before darting off to catch her bus. He eventually concluded that he loved her on the grounds that he had never
But this time was different. John was a human time bomb with no visible clock. His presence in the lab would cause additional stress, and without being able to contribute to the science in any meaningful way he would only be a distraction.
Sherlock’s eyes widened and he propelled himself off the steps so that he was standing in front of John, glaring into his eyes. John had blue eyes. Dark, deep blue eyes, constant and steady as the ocean with just as much potential for storm.
, he had learned quickly to forget about thinking. The surgeries were too important; the scars were necessary.
“So this is it then,” John said, the amazement in his voice travelling through the mask. “You solved it. With her body here, in a cemetery you can prove Moran has connections to, you have enough evidence for a warrant for his arrest. Once they dig up her body the rest will be paperwork.” John blinked in astonishment. “Is this the end of the road?”
He deserved this, he knew. The pain was nothing compared to what he’d done to John. But Sherlock was not used to being at the mercy of emotion and he didn’t know how much longer he would be able to tolerate it.
There was a silence and Sherlock listened to the waves lapping at the cliffs below. The sky was a brilliant array of warm colours but nothing was more interesting than the person sitting in front of him, sitting cross-legged with an unzipped hoodie hanging loosely off of one shoulder and his hands slowly worrying some blades of grass he’d unconsciously ripped from the ground. He was looking out over the cliffs and Sherlock watched the profile of his face. John’s face had such soft features, his rounded nose and kind eyes; nothing sharp, nothing dramatic. Women probably liked him for his honest, youthfully handsome face. He seemed built to inspire trust, and Sherlock had done everything in his power to shatter it. Now he waited, one more time, as always, for his friend’s forgiveness.
Sherlock had had the advantage of living with John, when he'd walked around the flat in t-shirts and pyjama trousers, but for others it would be hard to tell the state of John's figure under the nearly comical number of layers he wore. T-shirts under button-ups under jumpers under coats—a Victorian lady in January could hardly wear more clothing. He hadn't seen John wearing just one shirt in a while and it was… agreeable to know he was still in good form.
It had been easy to slam the memory of the overdose shut in his Feelings Closet after the fact. Moriarty was back. Not necessarily alive, but the challenge was finally a puzzle good enough for Sherlock to focus on, and the bizarre inconsistencies in the drug-addled dream remained safely locked away, unacknowledged and unconsidered. Until now. The memory snagged and his hyperactive mind tore through its details with relentless fury, desperate for more information on what John was doing to him—on these waves of
“So, how shall we start?” she asked, moving to stand in front of them. She undid the silk belt around her waist and the dressing gown fell open. John swallowed, dragging his eyes up from her lingerie to her face. “How about a private dance?”
They were there with Moran to buy, Sherlock deduced, reading the situation. The two men standing opposite were closer to Moran’s age, one with light grey hair and the other with a brown beard and moustache. They were there to sell. There was more information, the standard stream of data accompanying all people (Russian, grey hair studied in France, brown beard had a dentist appointment yesterday—) but Sherlock did his best to ignore it. He needed to focus on Moran. Excess information would only serve to distract.
Sherlock realised his error as soon as he said it. It wasn't 'our' flat; John didn't live there anymore. Neither John nor Mrs. Hudson seemed to notice.
Sherlock heard the squeak of the stairs as John went up to his bedroom. He supposed killing people and going for a jog wasn’t an altogether alarming combination of behaviour, but nevertheless he thought about it and concluded that he would still like John even if he went mad.
Oh, John was good. Better than good. He was surely the consulting doctor of manipulative healthcare.
“Yes. I needed you to believe the suicide in the beginning because it was the only way anyone else would believe it. I had to be dead to disappear. And your—your grief was what made it convincing. It’s true I could have contacted you later, after a few months perhaps. I didn’t because I couldn’t pass up the perfect opportunity for the experiment that presented itself. If you continued to believe I was dead I could observe how you would do without me,” Sherlock explained coolly.
Unfortunately for this plan, John heard fast footsteps coming up behind him and he’d barely had a moment to groan inwardly before a hand was on his upper arm arresting his movement and spinning him around.
“Damn, Watson,” Sullivan said, offering John his hand, “tell your model to come to the games more often.”
John leaned over him, dog tags dangling in the space between them, and Sherlock looked up at his face with a kind of muted curiosity. John held the detective’s chin. His forehead was cool, no fever, too pale though. Pupils dilated. Hardly daring to push his luck with how docile his flatmate was being, he circled Sherlock’s wrist with his hand, fingers resting on his pulse point. Heartrate elevated. God, he could faint.
“There was a horrible noise in the alley just a moment ago,” she said, bringing a tray with cups and saucers back from the kitchen.
Lestrade put his hand to his forehead. “Look, no one down at Scotland Yard appreciates your assistance more than I do—”
A few days later Sherlock was looking out at the back garden and Mycroft caught tears in his eyes in the reflection of the glass door. He stepped up behind him.
“It’s always games with you geniuses, isn’t it,” John said, though he couldn’t help the smile pulling at the corner of his mouth. He could go home. Sherlock would be there. At home. Baker Street. Their home.
Mycroft, Sherlock had discovered later, had known what he was up to from the start, having recognised the connection between the expiration dates on his cards and Sherlock’s ‘impromptu’ visits. What had they always said about coincidence?
John hung his head. He was not in the mood for this conversation. He hadn’t been in the mood for it for almost a year now.
They sank to the ground, Sherlock’s arms around him. He reached up, holding on to Sherlock’s jacket—where was his coat? Wasn’t it cold? John didn’t know; he couldn’t feel; it wasn’t important. He relaxed into the detective’s embrace. He was tired, so tired. His vertigo made the street slant and tilt precariously beneath them.
“I am human,” Sherlock said through his teeth. He hated to admit it, even in his own head. “Everyone knows that.”
“What then?” John sat down in his chair across from Sherlock. His tone suggested he did not appreciate that his answer could have been correct in an alternate universe.
behind him, hard enough that he was vaguely aware of Sherlock falling to the ground. At the same time, he reached his right hand around to the back of his jeans, pulled out his gun, and shot. He heard two gun shots and knew Reeves had fired at the same time.
Sherlock looked sideways out of the corner of his eye to take in Lestrade’s expression. “Don’t worry about the cameras,” he said. “I won’t have any trouble fixing those. Technology is lost on the
After the shower John redressed the cut and pulled on pyjama bottoms and one of his more comfortable long-sleeved shirts, resolving not to go anywhere for the rest of the evening. It had been a long twenty-four hours beginning with tackling Sherlock in Ireland and ending with shooting an assassin through the head. But standing in the empty living room he suddenly felt uncertain about what to do. He realised he’d been unconsciously looking forward to a night in with his flatmate. Thanks to both Switzerland and Ireland they hadn’t actually spent any time together at Baker Street since he’d left Mary’s house, and he found he was eager to fall back into the old routine he hadn’t yet acknowledged how much he'd missed.
Sherlock, holding the bottle of disinfectant, thought it would be useful to remind John of the rate at which bacteria multiply.
The streets of London slid by under his feet as he unconsciously navigated their twists and turns, breath clouding in the night air, oblivious to all passers-by in a kind of walking meditation. His head was buzzing with the memory of John pressed against him behind the cemetery monument, the memory of that alleyway kiss, John's mouth warm beneath his...
Sherlock was more than a little irritated by the time he heard John’s footsteps on the stairs signalling his return from work. Mrs. Hudson had been buzzing around their flat all day like an annoying and silly bee. Tidying, cooking, making tea, fussing over his neck injury, sitting, talking, incessantly talking, and absolutely refusing to go away.
“Good,” Sherlock replied. “Then I suggest you get on with that and let me continue with my work, which incidentally involves
you.” He shifted his expression into something like pity. “Oh, Sherlock, you’re in deep. Waterfalls worth of Feelings deep. John saved you the last time, but he can’t save you now. Because, if you think about it, this is really all his fault.” Moriarty looked delighted as something occurred to him. “You know you should
Sherlock’s eyes swept John’s face and lingered for a moment, his expression briefly a mixture of several things, before he turned his head away.
Sherlock stopped and turned around. John had the satisfaction of watching the detective’s eyebrows leap up beneath his fringe before his face resumed its trademark nonchalance.
Sherlock was still and John didn’t even bother getting his arms into a grip. “I divorce myself from my emotions by locking them out of my mind palace,” he explained. “My mind is precisely organised and there’s chaos if emotion gets in.”
Harry’s advice was lurking in the back of his mind. At the moment, the back of his mind was the only place it was allowed.
Other dreams were not based in memory, just vivid impressions: Sherlock’s pale skin under his hands, Sherlock’s lean, slender body beneath him, pale eyes watching him in amazement as John used his hands, his mouth, to teach the world’s most genius detective about pleasure. John woke up in a sweat, with no small amount of alarm, on the mornings after those dreams. But he dismissed them. Dreams were insanity. His subconscious was confusing the amount of time he spent with his flatmate and the depth of their friendship for something more.
,” Sherlock said with an eye roll. “Thigh scars.” He gestured to the pictures he’d finished putting up. “Did you know
“No. It’s only a catalyst. It triggers an effect that tricks the body into killing itself. Evidence of the poison could only be found by someone who knows exactly what he’s looking for. And no one knows that, except me.”
He looked at the time. It was only seven o'clock; his practice wasn't until the afternoon. He could do with a few more hours of sleep.
John turned from where he was walking into the kitchen and Sherlock realised there was no concrete formation of words present in his mind to produce a following sentence. He regrouped quickly.
Mycroft strode through the swarm of little kids, scooping up a struggling Sherlock and placing him safely on top of a slide. Mycroft turned to the boys glaring up at him, they were older than Sherlock, he guessed about nine years old. But he was thirteen and much taller.
John breathed. Billy said Sherlock was looking for drugs. It didn’t necessarily mean he was looking for drugs to get high, he reminded himself forcefully. It could be related to the case. Moran was involved in drug dealing. He could be investigating the drug ring connected to Moran.
Sherlock shrugged. “It’s the easiest piece of furniture to fit a body into without having to chop it up first.”
He smirked; it came in all sorts of handy to have an ex-soldier with lingering homicidal tendencies living with him.
He would have imagined a porcupine would be cuddlier. He would have imagined Sherlock, who—according to all evidence thus and lately presented— had never slept with anybody, would have been startled awake at the first touch and shoved him back. But Sherlock was nothing if not unpredictable. He could defy expectations in his sleep. Literally.
“Hang on,” John said several hours later. They were both on their laptops, John in his chair reading an article about a new drug for narcolepsy, and Sherlock continuing his research at the table. “I asked you if you thought Irene Adler was somehow involved in the murders and you said you
John knew what he meant. It was as if there was a pleasant pressure securing him to the rug. He lifted his arms and let the intensified gravity drag them down.
John was on the verge of protesting, but in the spirit of letting sleeping detectives lie he kept his mouth shut. One chair thrown at his head was enough for one day.
"Yeah, ten minutes." The room was pressing in on him, warm, as though it were tucking him in. Nice living room.
John sniggered at his own terrible jokes and when he turned his head sideways he could see Sherlock smiling as well. Maybe the joke wasn't that bad. Maybe the drug was that good.
Mycroft stopped at the end of John’s bed, tapping his hand on the rail. John watched the brief tension in his shoulders—not entirely dissimilar to Sherlock’s posture in the minute pause before a quick decision. Mycroft turned around.
“It suffocates the body from the inside,” Sherlock explained, straightening in the chair as he realised he had unconsciously leaned back. “It lowers the victim’s blood pressure to dangerous levels which eventually results in—”
But why were they lying like this? His dream had been a mimicry of what was physically happening, but obviously it wasn't accurate. John hadn't spoken to him, hadn't told him to move closer. Sherlock supposed the automatic attraction toward body heat was responsible. The living room was cold and draughty. They must have unconsciously drifted toward each other.
Ok, now *lifts hands and backs slowly away from murderous mob* um, let’s just remember that this mind palace thing was an unresolved issue that did need to be addressed… Um, there are still two chapters left… please still read them?
However, his brother had called him a virgin, in more or less terms. And Mycroft would know, wouldn’t he? Sherlock could read a person’s sexual history in a glance, and John had seen first-hand that Mycroft’s skill in deduction was at least as good, if not better than his younger brother’s (John remembered Mycroft even correcting Sherlock’s observations once or twice). Assuming Mycroft was right, would Sherlock really have sex for the first time with Janine for the case? John supposed he would. There was nothing he had known Sherlock
Sherlock eyes widened just perceptibly. His lips quirked to a small smile as he turned to look out the window.
“Nope.” Sherlock grabbed John’s forearm and he was caught off-guard enough to allow Sherlock to pull him to his feet. As soon as he was standing Sherlock turned on his heel and disappeared into the bathroom. He heard the sound of water from the tap.
“Excellent deduction. I would congratulate you on solving the case, except I’d say you lose rather a lot of points for not noticing there was a case in the first place.”
“Right,” John said, backing out into the open space of the room from where Sherlock had him trapped between the couch and the coffee table, “if you do go mad, any chance it could
He opened the door and John saw his relatively small room reduced by half with a portable bed crammed in.
Lestrade thought he saw something flash behind Mycroft’s eyes, but then they were empty as he said, “I had hoped we were beyond this particular brand of Sherlock’s nonsense, but I see now it was an overestimation. Good evening, Detective Inspector.”
"Genius,” Sherlock had corrected him with a rather stern look. Music should be evaluated on its own terms, not whether it had been hijacked for some action film.
She nodded. “I’m very sorry, gentlemen, but the time is up. If we continue any longer without sex it will look suspicious.”
Unfortunately, more often than not, these moments came coupled with a reminder of why they were in the situation to begin with: a mental picture of Sherlock the way he’d been in Magnussen’s office when John had rushed into the room, not realising the full extent of what had happened until he pushed his friend’s jacket back and saw the blood, gasping for breath as he reached for his phone,
“It’s the drug,” Sherlock said, looking into his eyes. He jumped up from his crouched position and moved to sit on a crate next to him.
Black. Heavy, suffocating black was pressing in on him from all sides. He couldn’t see. His limbs were too heavy. He couldn’t move. He fought against it. He had to get up. He had to get back. He had to get to John. A glint of light. He willed himself toward it, dragging his mind forward.
The waves tumbled and crashed and Sherlock wondered if John was aware of how hard he was actually gripping his wrist.
John grinned. He snapped a picture of the cup and saucer on the table and sent it to Sherlock with a message:
The plan had required him to call John to ensure John saw him fall, and to keep him in place. But from John’s perspective… He’d never even considered it from John’s perspective.
John let his eyes move over Sherlock’s sleeping form. He had almost lost him again tonight. If there really was, or could be, something between them he would have to consider it sooner rather than later.
“Here’s the deal, Mr. Holmes. I’m a very busy man. Loads of evil to do.” He winked at Sherlock. “I’m going to take my associates and my snipers now. But I will leave you with one of my bodyguards here.”
By the time John got out of the shower it was still only six thirty. He looked at the receipt-less tux on his bed. Sherlock Holmes was nothing if not manipulative.
Sherlock smirked down into his microscope. “‘Interesting business technique’ might be the best euphemism for illicitly drugging people I’ve heard in a while.” John scuffed his shoe on the rug, torn between pleasure at the compliment and concern that his morally bankrupt flatmate was rubbing off on him.
He was amazed to find that the fluttering thrill gripping him now was no less intense at thirty-four than it had been when he was fifteen. If anything it was even more powerful now, because the person sitting next to him, whose hand was still gripping his wrist as though he’d forgotten to let go, was a force stronger than any he’d ever encountered.
He walked straight to the lifts and pressed the button for the parking garage. Besides the button for the lobby it was the only one that didn’t require a keycard to make the lift work: a trick he’d learned from Sherlock.
Sherlock breathed deeply through his nose as he realigned his concentration. He couldn’t think about endings now. They were only distraction. Now he needed to focus on the problem. The problem and the method.
like that), and it would be a waste of energy to convince himself otherwise. Besides, he wasn’t ready himself for what it would mean if—if…
He wondered how such a place could exist without the police knowing about it. Maybe they did know about it. But John didn’t have time to speculate about the level of corruption at Scotland Yard. They stopped at one of the doors.
He watched in fascination as Sherlock faced the stripper with an expression that would have looked mildly interested to anyone else. But John could see he’d gone away. To his mind palace, he supposed, hopefully to run over the plan for their impending encounter.
When John arrived downstairs the next morning he went to check Sherlock’s bedroom. He had a vague memory of his flatmate coming home last night, but he’d been so out of it he wasn’t sure if it had been a dream. He'd spoken to him, hadn't he? Maybe not. He couldn't remember.
“You saved my life.” John struggled to get the words out under the intensity of Sherlock’s stare, which hadn’t moved from his face since he’d separated them.
“Oh this poison!” Sherlock couldn’t help saying out loud for the second time. “Absolutely delightful.” He reached for another blood film and readjusted his microscope.
“I’m not going anywhere,” John said, handing Sherlock back his laser and standing. “There’s nowhere to go in this fog.”
Sherlock was looking at his friend with raised eyebrows. "I wasn't aware a dance could be an arsehole."
It was after two o’clock in the morning when Mycroft stepped quietly into John Watson’s hospital room. His brother was sitting in a chair, half-lying on the bed, one hand clutching John’s wrist.
As a very young child their parents had, for the most part, kept Sherlock close to home. He had private tutors and little interaction with children his own age or even other adults. Because Sherlock managed to offend nearly everyone who was unfortunate enough to cross his path, their parents wanted to reduce his contact with people as much as possible. He called his tutors idiots and his peers dumb and ugly. It did nothing to reduce Sherlock’s ego that he actually was better looking, smarter dressed (even as a small child), and cleverer than all of them. It might have done wonders for Sherlock’s ability to adjust if only he’d had glasses or plain brown eyes or perhaps even thinner hair.
John pulled back a fraction. Sherlock had closed his eyes and when they opened again there was a warmth in them that hooked and pulled beneath John’s chest, an aching almost-pain. Was it possible Sherlock Holmes’ eyes could look like that? Was it possible that he, John Watson, could be the cause of such an effect? He took a deep breath. It was difficult to believe there existed such a beautiful, challenging, fascinating, thoroughly unmanageable creature as Sherlock. And almost impossible to believe that he was here, now, beneath him, looking up at him like— John swallowed.
John watched him, waiting for the surge of anger toward the irreverent detective who’d lied to him, gone off and gotten himself drugged and nearly killed
John’s jaw tightened as he tried to push aside the memory of Sherlock, nearly broken, on the verge of collapse even as he negotiated John and Mary’s reconciliation. The detective's heart was failing.
Sherlock noticed a flush around John’s neck as he ducked his head and cleared his throat. “Erm, yeah, all right.”
of all people. It’s true he could put up with Sherlock’s moods better than most, but he certainly hadn’t been Sherlock’s only option. Molly, for example, had always been an option. And now that Sherlock was internet-famous he had fan clubs worth of options. But he’d never shown the slightest inclination toward anyone else.
John reached to feel his neck, to check the extent of the swelling, but with quick reflexes Sherlock caught his hand, giving him a hard look. Severe pain confirmed.
If Sherlock was often catlike in the agility of his movements, his indolent lounging and languid stretching, then Sherlock on heroin was doubly so. The moment John sat down in the cab and swung the door shut Sherlock stretched out.
And without the game… In the past there had been drugs. An exhilarating rotation of cocaine and heroin. Up and down, round and round, a beautifully destructive carousel: blurring sensations and blissful numbness. It had been dizzying, the risk and the rush, never enough and then suddenly too much all at once. And then the decision to stop. A grinding halt. And now there were only nicotine patches, an empty flat, and silence.
He saw an image of Sherlock’s face in the street—the last thing he’d seen before the fog of the coma. John had fallen and Sherlock had caught him. He would never forget that expression. He’d do it all over—the poison and everything—if he could see Sherlock look at him that way again. But near-death experiences are ephemeral. A momentary, fear-induced sentiment is not reliable for predicting whether it would be sustainable long-term. Sherlock had been afraid of losing him. But now that he wasn’t dying—What now?
John glared at his entirely unmanageable detective. He supposed he wasn't treating her any more abominably than any other client, but she was sweet, and John's more gentlemanly principles objected to Sherlock handling her as roughly as any other bloke that walked through their door.
Mycroft tightened his grip on his umbrella. There may be a certain kind of sadness for the child who loses his dog, but there’s a certain kind of danger reserved for the person who loses love.
victim, David Rodgers, has a strange pattern of scarring all across his thighs? No? Did you know that there have been two other corpses this month with the same kind of scarring? Did you know
John angled his head to kiss him, but ducked at the last instant, bringing his lips to Sherlock’s neck instead. The water poured down the walls, becoming audible as the amount increased. Sherlock’s eyes fell shut as he felt the scrape of John’s teeth and the dart of his tongue—a blissful alternation against his skin. Sherlock ran his fingers through light strands of hair, catching them and pulling John's head back and kissing him properly, claiming his mouth in a way that wouldn't allow John to forget who it belonged to now. The waterfalls tumbled down the walls around them, picking up volume until they were roaring—a reminder of a time they'd stood together on the cliffs under the Reichenbach Falls, danger in the air around them like mist, but this was home.
“I knew there was a good chance the shot would kill him,” she’d said quietly, keeping her eyes down. “But I hoped—”
“Look at the chemical composition!” Sherlock said, waving at his laptop. John leaned in to look at it. “You’re a doctor; you can see it’s harmless. It’s a good high with no side effects, come on.”
He touched his left upper arm, tracing the cut where Carl Reeves’ bullet had grazed him through his sleeve. That, he assumed, was how the poison had gotten into his system. The bullet had been aimed for Sherlock. And John had taken it for him. Perfect.
He didn’t need drugs when he had John. Only the certainty of losing him—the private plane that would take him to Eastern Europe and never bring him back—had made him reach for his syringe again. And now… If he lost John now...
Sherlock had his elbow propped against the car door and his fist in front of his mouth, thinking. He smiled around his glove.
So, no, they wouldn’t talk about it. They wouldn’t have any conversation that would lead to the inevitable conclusion that John would have to leave. Not if Sherlock could help it.
. If Sherlock tried to convince him to have sex with the prostitute for the case, then John wouldn’t hesitate to remind him that
Sherlock quirked a brow and Lestrade surmised that ‘options’ were not typically part of the elder Holmes’ plans.
After all, John thought he must have the better end of the deal. As he knew from past experience, it’s much easier to die than to watch someone die. Or at least it is when that someone is a (
They turned a corner and John leaned back against the side of a building. He shook his head. “That was ridiculous.”
“Forty pounds each! I looked them up. And god knows how much the rest of the products in there cost.”
Leave it to Mycroft to give young Sherlock illegal ‘toys’ to play with. The strength of the laser was undoubtedly higher than regulations allowed.
John was wearing trainers, dark grey jogging bottoms and a navy hoodie, which was unzipped, revealing a white Barts t-shirt underneath. The circles under his eyes had been erased by several nights of good rest, and his blond hair was glowing bright in the low sunlight. In a flash Sherlock saw him as he must have looked ten years ago, a university student in rugby training wear, before Afghanistan, before him, and before Mary.
"Ok, ok." John tossed the blankets back. He stumbled out of bed and Sherlock caught his elbow with quick reflexes. Their eyes met for a moment before Sherlock hastily dropped his hand and stepped back.
As an alleged ‘front’ for prostitution and drug dealing, John had imagined Monroe’s to be a dingy, seedy place that would practically spell out crime. The place the cab pulled up to, however, was decidedly upmarket, with a valet option at the door.
And then Sherlock knew with certainty that if John were there, he would have said, “If I promise I don’t have any tea, can I come in?”
Sherlock turned away from the living room window, ducking his head as Mycroft’s voice went dangerously soft. “You remember what happened last time?”
“Stuck,” John replied. Having got the waistcoat off he’d moved on to the considerably smaller buttons of his shirt. Upon failing to get them he had attempted to pull the shirt over his head.
“Look, corpses don’t bleed do they?” Sherlock said, diving into the explanation. “It’s difficult to fake a stabbing on a dead body. But not impossible. If you’re in time—and judging by the amount of blood I’d say they can’t have been more than thirty minutes after his heart stopped—you can drain the blood using gravity. They stabbed him on the left side and then positioned him on his left to allow the blood to drain from the puncture, making the amount of blood loss convincing despite the heart having stopped sometime earlier.”
She ruffled her hair a bit and said, “I don’t know what you’re accusing me of, but I can tell you I’ve never seen Brandon’s legs without trousers on.”
“Considering Scotland Yard is determined to bungle their own investigation by throwing a wrench in my process—slowing everything to a grinding halt by making me wait until Monday for an autopsy that could just as easily be done at the weekend if it weren’t for some arbitrary social constructs about ‘days of rest’ designed to indulge laziness and curtail productivity—I thought I’d do some background reading in the meantime.”
But what did his sexual history, or lack thereof, have to do with any of it? Why had his mind fixated on it in the midst of a (hypothetical) case?
Fortunately it was late enough that most of the building’s workers had already left. One or two stragglers walked through the parking garage and John pretended to be texting if they passed him.
"I want to apologise in advance, Mrs. Avery," John said. "I think I've fallen down a set of stairs more gracefully than I dance."
goldfish. And though their meeting had been coincidental, he hadn’t agreed to live with the army doctor arbitrarily. Sherlock would never have chosen to live with an ‘average’ and ‘boring’ person. He would never have chosen to live anyone at all (regardless of any amount of umbrella-waving on Mycroft’s part). But John had walked through the door and Sherlock understood immediately that John wasn’t ‘anyone.’ Of course he was ordinary in the standard non-genius sense of the word, but he was different. Better. The most superior of any goldfish Sherlock had ever encountered. And suddenly, inexplicably, there was space and time in Sherlock’s life where there had been none before. Space for another person walking at his side or moving around his kitchen. Time to slow down a bit and wait for John to catch up; time to explain, and even time to laugh when John’s responses surprised him—something his skull had never been able to do.
John stuffed his hands into his coat pockets a bit awkwardly. “I’ll just go lie down for a bit then.”
“He’s at Scotland Yard,” Mrs. Hudson gave him a knowing smile. “They needed a testimony or something. He told me to ring him as soon as you got home.”
He smirked and Sherlock glared at him. He was English, born and raised in London judging by his accent, tall with thin, pale features, and a pointed nose. Like the other lackey who had followed Moran, there was a public school air about his look and affect. Sherlock would know.
So she continued to work at his side, trying her best to stop calculating the exact amount of cocaine Sherlock was ingesting and to simply appreciate the fact that they were in a hospital, and help would be just around the corner if he overdosed.
is fascinating, is it not? You, the man who defies all categories—even inventing your own profession to avoid being labelled anything ordinary—you find yourself irresistibly attracted to the system you reject. What’s more categorised, labelled, more controlled than a soldier?”
“Do you want to know the statistics on how often ex-wives either murder or are murdered by their ex-husbands?”
It was around six o’clock in the evening of the third day and Sherlock had been working silently, racing around the room with bloodshot eyes and hair standing up wildly: the very portrait of a mad scientist. He hadn’t spoken for hours and when he did Molly had to do a double take.
Sherlock leaned back against the window. "Mrs. Hudson, if you insist on burdening us with your presence you may as well tell us what tiresome reason you have for being in our flat."
When John had walked into the lab the day they met Sherlock had immediately been struck by John's voice.
John was satisfied with his decision to leave. Things had changed since they’d been flatmates the first time around, and he was determined to prove that despite having left Mary, Sherlock would not be the only thing in his life now. He was not a shadow on the periphery of Sherlock’s awareness waiting to be called into focus. He was an independent person, capable of doing and enjoying things that had nothing at all to do with Sherlock. And if Sherlock thought John was so enamoured with him that he’d just be sitting on the front step of 221B waiting for him to come home—
