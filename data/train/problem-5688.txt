Tony was now circling the drop ship, looking for an area where the soil was softer and easier to remove. He was breathing fast and trying to walk as quickly as he could. Bucky arrived with shovels and their other friends, all of them with tight, anxious faces.
wow, i got this chapter done early. woo. yay for me, i guess. anyways, introducing another one of my queens (apart from nat, she's the ultimate queen, as we all know): valkyrie! yas, finally. also: varol! varol is happening, guys :)
'They forgot to lock my cage. I got out. It was easy,' Rumlow spat back, using his already stained shirt to wipe away some of the filth on his face.
'Done!' he said triumphantly, just as the first Grounders emerged from the trees on the opposite bank of the river.
Tony stood up and hit Pepper head-on. 'Sorry, sorry, Pep,' he said quickly, and she steadied him, scanning his face. 'Don't beat yourself up, Tony, they made a choice,' she said quietly, pulling him into a hug. 'Yeah,' he said, not convinced, and she sighed and grabbed his hand.
She narrowed her eyes at him. 'You'd be the first one to know if there were guns for me to play with in this place, Barton. You and the remains of your head.'
Bruce had been in the makeshift med bay, treating a scratch that one of the delinquents had gotten while out hunting. It was a long scratch but it was shallow and looked worse that it actually felt. He just needed to clean the wound, put antiseptic and then wrap a bandage around it, and the delinquent would go back to normal activity.
'Well, it seems our business here is wrapped up, unless you got something else,' the smooth voice said, and Loki must have shook his head because the voice continued, 'Alright. We're gonna take this to Pierce and you can run along back to your little friends.'
'Closing yourself off from the rest of the world isn't going to help you at all, Natalia, and trust me, I should know. How exactly do you think I lost my arm? In a fucking battle. And I know everyone's different and you probably have been through a lot worse, but just try, okay? There's a lot of things better in the world than solitary confinement.'
Laughing, Steve followed and hugged Valkyrie, and then awkwardly hugged Tony as well. The corner of Natasha's mouth quirked up and Clint pulled her into the chaotic group hug.
He nervously stood behind Steve as the other boy quickly explained to Sam that they needed to speak to the Chancellor. Natasha had gone to tell Clint about the new developments and Bucky and Thor were out collecting nuts and berries. T'Challa was also away and so was Wanda, which left himself, Steve and Tony.
Display cases and counters ran around the room. Tall shelves, cupboards and laboratory equipment were everywhere. The floor was tiled and free of dust and filth, and there were television screens on the walls. Clint leaned forward and tapped a glass display case containing what seemed to be a pair of gauntlets, and beside it was a stack of notes and a tablet which he saw was long drained of battery.
The drop ship had landed in the opposite direction from the Grounders' territory, much to the scouting party's relief. Thor had been walking for half an hour when he caught scent of smoke and burning metal. He wrinkled his nose at the stench and turned to the others, who were making the same face, having detected it too.
'Yeah. Anyways, I didn't come here and risk my life to bitch about the system. I wanted to tell you that they're lying. Project Exodus... the first ship it isn't ready to come down in three to four days, first of all. Secondly, it only has space for seven hundred people, and there are two thousand on the Helicarrier. That bullshit he was saying about your parents coming down? It's not even finalized yet. They might be coming down next year, they might not come down at all.'
'- you, boy, have been nothing but an annoyance to us. I wonder why Pierce even allowed you to live,' a rough, deep voice was saying.
For the most part, she ignored Barnes. He was handsome and he knew it, but she knew that she wasn't lacking in the looks department either, so that gave her a boost of confidence. They'd both been eyeing each other up - Barnes, especially, he clearly didn't know the meaning of being subtle - but she didn't expect that they'd both be holed up in a bunker together.
Stunned, he stepped out of the spacecraft and onto the ground. It was springy, and green, and blue, and oh, so beautiful.
As soon as Steve had entered the drop ship, Rhodey and Pepper had removed his gag and bonds. His friends had immediately crowded around him, speaking in low voices.
'I was in Mount Weather and I remembered your inexplicable love for hammers,' he continued smoothly, as if he'd never changed his position, as if he wasn't about to fall over from the weight of the item in his hands.
They peered at the place she was pointing at. Sure enough, on the control board there was a chunk where the radio was supposed to be, torn wires poking out.
'Sorry, sorry!' he yelped, reaching out and steadying her. He'd had to do a lot of steadying today, he realized. Maybe it was a quality of his - bump into people and then steady them because you're way taller and bulkier and therefore have as much of a chance as falling over as a tree.
from inside the drop ship and then came Rumlow’s maniacal laughter. ‘What would I do with you, Potts? My justice is not delivered. Save yourself the time and just walk away. You can’t do anything.’
The two of them watched the drop ship's path across the sky. At the last moment, its lander activated and the drop ship floated down to the ground not too far away.
And Darcy. Darcy was there too, not as often as Natasha. Actually, now that Clint thought about it, Darcy usually visited when Natasha was out hunting or on border patrol. Clint had already explained to her that Natasha was only a friend, and their relationship was platonic - but then Darcy was too.
'Never mind that now - we have to tell everyone! If we get back there and Rumlow's somehow converted the whole camp to his twisted idea of freedom -' Clint began, but Natasha interrupted him.
She ducked out of the tent and James followed her. As they walked towards the gate James unconsciously reached for her hand and she allowed him to tangle his fingers with hers. It was oddly intimate and she wasn't used to it, but it felt nice and rather comforting. She reveled in the new sensation and craned her neck for any sight of the news James was talking about.
The camp had organized itself into a functioning society, with assigned tents and equally distributed supplies. They had been stocking up on food because winter was fast approaching, and they had been fashioning crude spears and knives out of metal from the drop ship for defending themselves.
It was very wet. Water was practically pouring from it. The wires stuck out, looking like they'd been hastily sawn off by a knife.
'I don't really know much. I was an outsider. They call themselves HYDRA. I think they came down to Earth around twenty years ago. They're working to take down SHIELD and the other nations in space. They used to live in the Helicarrier, but stole a drop ship and came here. There's still agents in space, though.'
'In, like, thirty hours, if I was paying attention to Fury's babble. Sometime around tomorrow. Why?'
I know you're lighting a fire! I'm asking you why you would feel the need to light a fire when there's a massive bonfire in the middle of the camp!'
She tensed up but decided to ignore him. They spent a few minutes in silence, sharpening their knives, when he spoke up again. 'I'm Clint Barton, by the way.' 'Good for you,' she replied shortly, and he snorted. 'Are you always like this?' 'Like what?' 'You know,' he said quickly, realizing he'd just put himself into a very bad position, 'standoff-ish. Cold. Not very... outspoken. No offense though.'
Bruce already had to cut away the infected flesh around his wound and Clint had woken up, his eyes glazed over, screaming until his throat was raw. Natasha and Steve had to grab him by the shoulders and pin him down as Bruce worked on his wound. When Bruce was finished Clint's eyes rolled back into his head and he blacked out again.
Bruce shook his head. 'I've never treated acid burns like this before. I don't think there's anything we can do now.'
'Fine, then. You tell me what information you got and then I'll decide if I slit your throat and call it self-defense,' the rough voice growled.
'I just wanted to say - I'm really sorry,' Bruce told her sadly. 'I didn't mean to do any of that and I especially didn't mean for you to get hurt. I'm really, really sorry and if you didn't want to be my friend anymore I'd understand -' 'Bruce,' Betty said firmly, 'stop beating yourself up. I'm fine, see? None of that was your fault. I wasn't even injured badly at all, just a few scrapes. If anything I'm the one who should be sorry for even asking you to go through that experiment without testing the primer first.'
'I know both of you are worried about Clint but, like I said, Betty had an idea. She thinks she knows what to do for him. If she tries it and it works, will you come with me?' he asked tentatively.
Steve let out a sharp exhale and caught sight of Bucky and Natasha. 'Hey, Buck, Nat. As you can see, that was an absolute shitshow.'
He took a deep breath. 'I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. For snapping at you in the drop ship, and for the whole thing with Loki - I was just really angry. Steve was hurt, Loki wasn't doing anything to help him, and we were wasting our time while he was dying, and I just couldn't deal with it anymore.'
He'd ran back to camp as fast as he could, literally stepping on the back of Clint's shoes, trying to outrace the acid fog. Thankfully he didn't get any severe injuries and the red welts faded away after a few hours.
'He's asleep. Finally. I made sure of that, and I left water and food, too,' Tony replied, rubbing a hand across his face. There was stubble on his chin and his neatly clipped facial hair looked scruffy after days on Earth with no razor and shaving cream.
'That is all I have to say for now. Be sure to broadcast the Unity Day celebrations. Remember to build walls around your camp and investigate the emergency aid depot. Stay safe.'
He glanced at Natasha, who seemed exceptionally quiet. Not surprising, considering her personality, but he was still concerned.
yo, new chapter. sorry it's so late, i've been really busy and just realized i hadn't posted a chapter like an hour and a half back. this is literally the fastest i've written, lmao.
'Yeah, I could. If it makes you feel better, it's not a bomb if you scrap it together like that. The official designation is IED—improvised explosive device,' his boyfriend told him.
'Also, speaking of relationships, what's your status with Nat?' Steve asked, glancing at the redhead.
Natasha rested her head in her hands. She remembered a moment in the drop ship when two delinquents had walked in, complaining about the screams. One of them had actually told her that Clint was a lost cause and trying to help him would be a waste of their supplies. She'd almost taken his head off but Bruce had restrained her.
The night was lit up by little lights. He wasn't sure what they were. They looked like objects someone threw from space, and they were burning up in Earth's atmosphere. As they came closer to the ground, they blinked out, as if they were scorched to ashes.
'I don't underst - oh, look, there's Darce. Bye, Nat!' Clint stood up, almost fell over, but still managed to walk over to the brunette, who gave him a smile and handed him another cup.
'You are most kind,' Natasha responded to his jab, pushing past him and gripping the ladder. She made no noise going up even though the ladder looked old and creaky. Daggers were in both her hands and it was a wonder she didn't slice her palms off as she climbed.
'They happened!' he said angrily, gesturing towards the gate, where the three backstabbers had just left the camp.
Steve rolled his eyes and turned back to the launcher. It wasn't too difficult to set up, because Valkyrie had given him step-by-step instructions, but Steve knew that he was going to go wrong somewhere. Anything involving machinery or technology was far from his strong point.
'Yeah, well, I did come onboard the Helicarrier once,' she said casually, 'before I got thrown into jail, I mean. You would've seen me around then.' He nodded slowly but didn't look convinced, so she steered the conversation away from those dangerous waters.
'No, it's not. Don't even start. You don't know who I am, where I'm from, what I've done - you don't know anything about me, so don't start making assumptions or whatever -'
He was so engrossed in his Steve-filled thoughts that he very nearly missed the blood splatter in front of him.
Jane must have seen him sitting alone with his chin on his hands because she wandered over, her gaze both concerned and amused.
And, being the athletic superstar he was, he promptly tripped over a tree root, rolled down a hill, hit his head on a rock and then blacked out.
'Careful, my friend,' Thor rumbled, steadying him and then clapping him on the shoulder, which then resulted in Thor having to steady him again.
'It's terrible, isn't it?' Darcy said softly, sticking her fork into her mouth, 'all those people up on the Helicarrier, and we can't even tell them it's safe to come down.' He nodded. 'And they would, except dicks like Rumlow decide to remove the only thing connecting us to them,' he reminded her, and she groaned and rolled her eyes.
It hit her that she was giving out way too much information about a gun than what was considered normal and she shut her mouth, but Barnes clearly was a quick thinker.
Rumlow hesitated, but the pistol didn't move from Steve's head. 'I don't need to tell you why I'm doing this, Rogers,' he said roughly, 'and besides, I think you already know.'
'What do you mean you don't fuck - why did you stop?' Darcy asked, confused, slowing down to a jog beside him.
Tony whooped and immediately hit the release button of his seat while Pepper glared at him furiously. He shot her a smirk as he drifted away from his seat, completely weightless, floating through the spacecraft. Two other kids saw him and immediately unbuckled their seatbelts as well.
'A dummy clip. Or a dummy round, whatever. The bullets don't have any explosive charge. I guess they used this for practicing their aim down here.'
'Loki, what do you think you're doing?' he demanded, crouching beside the fourteen-year-old black-haired boy who was striking a match against a pile of kindling. 'I'm lighting a fire, you oaf,' he snapped back, and Thor arched an eyebrow. 'Oh, no, I'm blind, I couldn't see that -
He grinned and kissed her, pulling her closer to him, and she wound her hands into his soft brown hair. His arms were still around her waist. His lips were slightly chapped but she was sure hers were too. She stood up on her tiptoes to deepen the kiss. A few moments later they broke away, flushed and gasping for breath, but they were smiling.
Bruce tried to catch sight of the HYDRA agents' faces, but he was too afraid to wiggle into a better position for fear that they would see the bushes shaking and investigate. Instead, he focused on the conversation happening.
'I'm sure it's safe, but one can never be too sure,' he told them, 'which is why I'm not going first. All yours, ladies.'
'We're on Earth, Tones! Can you believe it?' she said excitedly, as Rhodey joined them. 'Oh, my god, is that
He sighed and stood up. There were no pictures, no diaries, nothing personal in the bunker except for those toys. Whoever had lived here was long forgotten.
To Bruce's horror, more delinquents stumbled and fell, desperately trying to contain the flows of blood from their mouths, noses and eyes. The younger kids were crying, losing blood even faster, and the older ones were trying their best to shut them up.
James looked up as she walked out. She was wearing her poker face, and she knew it was impeccable. Not one of them would be able to make out what she was thinking just about then.
'Stevie,' Bucky said, appearing out of nowhere. He looked weary and he had blood on his face, but he still managed a grin.
'Hey, hey, it's alright,' she whispered to him, and pulled him into a hug, wrapping her arms around his neck. He buried his face in her shoulder, his arms automatically going up to encircle her waist.
'Don't question Pierce unless you want to end up dead. I'm sure he had his reasons.' The second voice was higher and smoother but most definitely male.
'Yeah, but you gotta know when to stop, man. His entire life is some kind of cosplay because of some nutcase ancestor - no offense, Thor.'
The camp was abuzz with activity. Steve and Bucky were explaining the journey to Mount Weather and were setting up scouting parties to get more gear and weapons. Everyone wanted to go and get stocked up. Some of them, like Bruce, Jane, Darcy and Pepper opted to stay back, either because they didn't want weapons or didn't need them.
They had a gate - a very small gate - at one side of the camp, and they had a constant guard system beside the gate, to let people in and out.
Thor didn't care much for that. He was worried about the people, sure, but he knew the Helicarrier's Exodus ship wouldn't come down in time. HYDRA would attack them far before reinforcements arrived, and they needed to be prepared. It steeled his resolve. He was afraid, but he also knew that fear cut deeper than any weapon, and he needed to keep his wits about him or else he would end up like the fifteen delinquents in the makeshift graveyard.
The two of them moved further into the darkness, which was exactly how you died in every single movie he'd ever watched, and the light of the match disappeared from his view. 'I'm beginning to think Barton may be right. If you die, scream, will you? It'll be real helpful for us, we won't have to come down there and check on you,' he told them.
Up until the day he came out as gay to his father, got his ribs broken, his hopes crushed, his pride shattered, and then built a robot programmed to make Howard Stark's life a living hell.
'And if Steve's not there I say T'Challa,' Sam added, and everyone easily agreed. T'Challa was just as fair and as good of a leader as Steve.
ackkkk i adore writing thor. i feel like thor's one of the characters least written about in the marvel fanfic world, which is such a shame, because although he doesn't have a backstory that's a tragic work of art like bucky and nat, or a personality that shines through and hits you in the feels like steve and tony, he's a cinnamon roll who's been consistently optimistic even when he doesn't need to and is seriously not talked about enough. poor dude's been through so much and still manages to smile and make my entire day.
'No. That's the whole point. The sickness is designed to weaken you. They're going to attack you tomorrow. The sickness lasts for around two or three days and then it goes away by itself, but it might be too late by then. They're depending on it,' Loki said matter-of-factly, pointedly leaning back from the ill delinquents.
'I do get it. It's okay, I understand. If you want to talk about it...' he trailed off hopefully, but she shook her head and watched the last light in his eyes go out.
'Did he - did he just disappear?' Bucky asked incredulously, already by Natasha's side. 'What in the actual fuck just happened,' Tony burst out, his mind still trying to process what he'd just witnessed. 'Where did he go?' Steve called out, craning his neck upwards.
Natasha smiled and turned her attention to the gun before she remembered that she'd asked a question.
Clint Barton wandered over, sporting a black eye and a split lip but grinning nonetheless. He held up a fistful of... arrows? 'Hey, Rogers, check this out. Rise and shine, Barnes. Me and Tasha went out earlier to that lake we found and guess what was lying there? Flint. So I made arrows.' He displayed his possessions proudly. They were crudely whittled and the heads were attached to the shafts with some sticky kind of sap, and a few feathers were tied to the end of each, but they were remarkably uniform.
'Of course I do, dumbass. I won't for much longer if you keep making smart remarks, though,' she warned, but there was a teasing glint in her eye.
He paused, and then pointed out the red plant Natasha had seen. 'However, they've also used whatever that is. I think it's some species of seaweed. It seems to have a good amount of medicinal properties, judging by how long Clint's managed to survive on it, but I suppose you're going to have to go and find it, along with the others I mentioned.'
'Everyone get away from the drop ship,' Natasha ordered, but her eyes widened and she touched her throat just as dark red blood dripped from her eyelashes, sliding down her cheeks. She turned to Clint but he was already on his hands and knees, violently gagging.
Clint took the gun, a slow smile spreading across his face. He chugged the water and threw the cup to Wade, who caught it effortlessly and gave Clint the bird, which he promptly returned.
James opened his mouth to argue, and then caught sight of Steve's pleading eyes and reluctantly gave in.
His best friend had refused to let Tony go out alone. Pepper, who'd forcibly stuck with him even when he told her he was sick, had caught the sickness herself and was now critically ill back at camp, with Betty tending to her.
Immediately there was a round of gunshots. Tony went back to working on the doors, trying hard not to think what it meant.
Natasha exhaled sharply and looked over at Bruce. The poor boy had tried so hard, staying awake the entire night along with Natasha, working on Clint the whole time, and finally he'd fallen asleep, exhausted. Betty had come along to help him but she couldn't stay for more than an hour at a time.
'So make sure he doesn't get found out,' Bucky said matter-of-factly, and Thor turned on him as well.
new chapter! i'm early this time, woo. i wanted to say to all those people who have watched the 100 - i'm not going to follow the grounders' backstory for obvious reasons. hydra is a whole other can of worms and i changed it, mixed it up a bit. even the ending is going to be different from season one's ending. anyways: carol! yay! she's kind of like abby, except she's not anyone's mother, not a medic, and has a girlfriend.
Her lie was partially based on the truth. She had told Clint a bit about what she did in Mir, but she still hadn't told him about the whole I-almost-killed-you-and-your-boss thing. And she'd spoken with James about her life as a child, even though she completely avoided bringing up the name of the Red Room.
He tried very hard not to think about how terrible his life was as he jogged through the forest, being very careful with his cargo, followed by around five armed delinquents. He'd never thought he'd end up in this situation, not in a million years. It was frankly quite funny if you looked at it from any point of view other than those of the ones doing the actual funny stuff.
She turned to look at James and he must've seen the way her eyes lit up because he grinned at her. 'Then what are you waiting for?' he asked, and Bruce and Betty immediately got to work, carefully removing the poultice from Clint's wound.
'Do you think I care if you tell that oaf what I did?' Loki snapped, and then his voice got smoother. 'You can go ahead and tell him. I'm sure it won't affect me as much as it would affect you if I blabbed your secrets to all your little friends.'
However, all of his love for human beings and what they could do did not give him an inkling of why he loved that anarchic, irresponsible, foolhardy, unreasonable dingbat who called himself - or didn't like to call himself - Thor's younger brother.
'No idea. They haven't learned from that fiasco which was the Culling. After they sent you down, they had to inform the people why, but they never did. Instead me and Val broadcast a message across the Helicarrier telling them we were running out of oxygen. The people didn't rebel. Actually, what they did was very sweet.'
'About the winter. We've found some records that show an old emergency aid depot not too far from where you are. Don't worry, it's not the civilian bunkers you've already discovered. It is of military design, and if the cold gets too bad you can temporarily move there.'
Then was Thor Odinson, who Clint found himself warming up to, with his cheerful demeanor and old-fashioned way of speaking. Strangely, Stark decided to tag along as well. A quiet boy with glasses who'd introduced himself as Bruce Banner wanted to come as well, saying that he just needed to get away from everyone at camp, which Clint could understand.
sup, babes. new chapter :) as the story proceeds i find myself having increasingly less to say in these little end notes of mine, so... just pretend i said something relevant to the chapter and let's call it a day, shall we?
Steve shook his head, trying to clear his thoughts. 'Tony, I like you. I like you a lot. And there definitely was sparks. But I'm not too sure about the whole boyfriend thing. I don't really do dating, and -'
Winnifred Barnes had been on the Exodus ship. When Steve and Bucky heard the news, they broke down. Bucky hadn't talked to anyone ever since the declaration. He was in Natasha's tent, where she was sitting with him, and Thor could hear quiet sobs from within. Steve had sat in a corner of the camp, his eyes blank and his shoulders stiff. He wouldn't look at anyone and the only person he even acknowledged was Tony.
'Woah,' Steve mumbled. He turned to Bucky. 'Your mom's coming down, Buck!' he said excitedly, and the two of them broke into wide grins, all enmity forgotten.
She'd aimed the sniper rifle at him when he was giving a speech to the residents of the Helicarrier, in order to create the chaos that was instrumental to avoiding detection. She'd taken her shot - and it had hit the mark - but she hadn't escaped the eye of Fury's guard dog.
Once he was through, Rumlow seized a gagged and tied-up Tony and shoved him outside, immediately closing the door once he was through. Steve warily backed away from his arch-nemesis.
Natasha had been right. There were many large metal sheets, most of them rusted and broken off at the edges. Thor and Steve picked ones that looked fairly sturdy and headed outside to where Natasha, Vision and Wanda were sitting, Wanda sobbing into Vision's shirt. Her brother lay on the ground, his eyes open but unseeing, the knife still in his chest.
'Guess we're now facing nature's revenge, or some shit like that,' he mumbled. Steve snorted. 'Nature's Revenge sounds like a movie - like, Nature Strikes Back.' 'Yeah, and the sequel - the Return of the Human Race. We aren't gonna be in the sequel, though,' he mused, and earned a choked laugh from Steve, reminding Tony of what they'd been doing before the scream. It was way too awkward to continue now.
He got a job as a children's entertainer and juggled balls and did stunts at birthdays or made cute balloons to sell at celebrations until he was fourteen, when his skill at an archery range on Unity Day - the day the twelve space stations joined together and formed an alliance, which clearly didn't work out well - attracted Fury's attention and he offered Clint a spot on guard duty.
'It's injured,' Natasha told them quietly, when they tip-toed up to her. 'It's a male and it's injured. We should be able to take it down in one shot.' 'We shall feast like kings,' Clint proclaimed in a low voice, and Natasha rolled her eyes at him.
Steve told him all that Loki had said. Fury's eyebrows rose progressively higher during the tale and when Steve was done, Fury's eyebrows were so high up his scalp Bruce was sure that if he had hair, his eyebrows wouldn't be visible at all.
'Are we leaving, or are you dysfunctional assholes going to stand around chatting like old ladies the whole time?' Tony questioned, and at his prompting they all trooped towards the trees, weapons out and ready, Clint going off on a tangent about how Tony was the most dysfunctional out of all of them and the king of assholes while he was at it.
He was in the middle of the bridge. It was really high, he couldn't jump off or he'd die. It was also really lengthy. He needed to run.
The delinquents had found that only some of the animals were grotesquely deformed. Most were actually quite normal-looking, and there were also a few new animals Steve had never read about in his textbooks. Thor, who'd been considerably depressed after Loki's departure, somehow managed to regain his spirits and valiantly accepted the role as taste-tester.
'What's going on?' Steve asked, wandering over, his blue eyes wide and his entire being screaming honor. Bless him and his stupid styled hair.
There had been a change in the air ever since the delinquents got the rifles. They were no longer scared shitless, waiting to be picked off one by one like fish in a barrel. They were ready for whatever the hell HYDRA might throw at them.
Tony was climbing down the ladder, his hair sticking up in eight different directions, soot on his face and his hands dirty, but he was smiling as wide as the Cheshire Cat.
'What the -' Steve muttered, getting up and running towards the hatch. He climbed up the ladder and pushed it open, Tony right behind him - and then he yelled. 'Tony, get back down there, now!'
Clint's family had been a terribly fucked-up one. His father was a drunkard, which wasn't legal on the Helicarrier - the reason he was floated - and usually beat Clint and Barney after a day of overdoing it on the booze. Clint had tried to run away from the cabin and live with the nice old lady on the opposite side of the Helicarrier several times, but he was always dragged back.
Steve was walking beside him, eyes focused on the back of Bucky's head. Tony tried to ignore his presence, but he just couldn't. Steve was like a fucking magnet, or something - Tony couldn't keep away.
Just as she realized that he appeared at her side, blue eyes dancing, a crooked grin tugging at the corner of his mouth. He was holding out a beautiful eight-petaled white flower and her heart ached at what she was about to do.
As if he'd been summoned by her thinking about him, James wrapped his arms around her waist from behind and she closed her eyes, leaning back against him. He was holding a cup of whiskey and he offered it to her. She mulled over it for a moment, and then took it from him and chugged it bottoms-up. He laughed against her neck.
'Is anyone in this room going to bat an eyelash if I tell them you walked naked into that storm outside waving a torch and singing Adele?'
So, Pepper and Rhodey, being the absolute best friends they were, got themselves in jail as well for sabotaging Howard Stark's latest project. When Tony heard the news he very nearly cried out of a combination of sheer shock, utter delight and anger at them for even trying to do that.
Bruce was about to follow him when Betty caught his arm. 'Hey. Are you going to be alright out there?' she asked softly, and Bruce shrugged. 'I really don't know. Wonder of wonders, they didn't send that antidote - the one that reduces my heart rate so I don't freak out.' 'Just be careful and stay out of it, okay?' Betty told him gently, and he nodded. 'Yeah, will do. Thanks, Betts.'
'That's why you fell,' Romanoff informed him, pointing towards a metal handle sticking out of the dirt. Tony frowned. 'Well, then, it's a shitty... whatever it is.' Barnes, Thor and Bruce were all scrabbling at the dirt around the metal handle, and the others joined them.
If they got into that area they could find the wires to manually open the drop ship door. If only they could tell Steve that he needed to distract Rumlow as much as possible.
'He was hanging out with Rumlow's gang earlier. They were getting on Steve's nerves, lighting torches and then waving them around, nearly catching the trees on fire. You can thank Bruce that we're not burnt to a damn crisp,' Clint said irritably. Thor sighed and put his head in his hands. 'I'll talk to him. I doubt it will make any difference, though.'
Thor walked over to Shuri, who was holding the black box from the Exodus ship. They'd cleared out that area, taking back all the usable scrap metal for materials to build the wall and help make weapons. Shuri was using the radio of the Exodus ship to make more walkies. Previously there only had been three - now there might be enough for around ten delinquents.
Sure enough, at the gate, Steve and Thor were standing there, talking with hushed tones and flying gestures to someone Natasha couldn't see. When they got closer, Natasha saw the familiar sharp cheekbones and slicked back dark hair of Thor's younger brother, Loki. He was dressed neatly in HYDRA gear, his body language betraying nothing.
He looked around at their motley group. After the whole thing with Rumlow, Stark suggested that a couple of people should head out from the makeshift camp and look for where they were supposed to be. The blond, who'd introduced himself as Steve Rogers, was first to volunteer, and Bucky Barnes was close to follow.
Loki didn't reply, but he met Thor's gaze, and there was so much anguish in his eyes that Thor died inside.
Clint and Natasha, who had gotten out far before the others, were standing at a safe distance. Natasha's eyes were focused on her boyfriend and she nodded.
They told him Betty was fine, but he hadn't seen her after that. They'd given him an injection to keep the monster at bay and lower his heart rate, apparently designed by Betty herself, so there were no accidents after that, but he knew for sure the Helicarrier was very pleased to get rid of him. Not many people knew about the gamma radiation accident - they all believed Bruce Banner had been put into jail for wastage of supplies - and he knew they'd like to keep it that way.
This was clearly the control room, meant for manual operating, but it wasn't needed. Tony, who had his back to them and was working on a dashboard full of buttons and screens, explained that the Quinjet had originally been designed for travel between the space stations but they'd changed it to make it suitable for a drop ship, which was why there was an unused control room. If anything went wrong one could work the ship from here but none of the delinquents could operate a drop ship, so it was practically useless.
Natasha was getting increasingly more desperate. She was an expert at not showing it, though. Only when she glanced behind at them could Tony see the actual pain and fear in her green eyes.
Thankfully they were too caught up with the more pressing matter at hand - reaching Mount Weather in time. Steve and Tony were talking together, leaving Clint and James to do their weird man-bonding thing. Loki was silent, always at the head of the party, never opening his mouth unless it was to give directions. Once he tugged at the collar of his gear and Natasha saw a snake tattooed on the back of his neck, glaring at her with its onyx eyes.
'Good, you're enjoying it. You may not be able to do that in the future if you keep on talking like that.'
'Okay, we're a functioning society, that's a lot more than we were a few minutes back,' Betty remarked, appearing out of nowhere.
'Get out and get ready,' he whispered to Barnes, 'I'll get these doors open.' Barnes nodded and crawled back out. He heard him relaying Tony's message to the others.
They were walking deeper and deeper into the jungle, following Clint's trail. If Clint really had been speared and kidnapped by whatever the fuck was hiding out here, Tony really didn't think it was a good idea to walk directly into its lair, but he knew if he ever told this to Natasha he would be castrated, so he kept his mouth shut.
Natasha never had love. Sure, her parents must've cared for her but they died before she could even talk to them properly. And when she was in the Red Room, no one loved her. They all cared about how useful she was. Yelena Belova was maybe the only person who even gave the slightest fuck about her after her parents died, and when Yelena died too, she didn't have anybody.
He realized he could hear the conversation happening above them and he tried to listen while looking for the wires.
Fifteen minutes later, all of Thor's friends were gathered in the drop ship. Steve had been allowed to come up because it was important. Bucky, Natasha, Wanda, Bruce, Tony, T'Challa, Valkyrie and some others were standing in a circle around Loki, who had finally allowed Thor to clean his wounds.
They were walking through the forest, Steve pretending to focus on the hand-drawn map of where the emergency aid depot was located and Tony generally looking in all directions except for the one Steve was in.
Natasha turned her face to hide her laughter and Clint scowled, but he was trying not to laugh as well.
Steve told her that she would meet her son soon but they had to speak to the Chancellor about recent developments. She was reluctant but eventually caved in and went off-camera to call the Chancellor.
Clint turned to his left. Darcy Lewis was fast asleep, her brown hair scattered across the pillow, dressed in nothing but a bra and her underwear.
'One of us is a killer,' Steve said softly, watching her go. 'It could be any of us, really. I could've killed him. You could've killed him. I just - I don't know, man, this is terrible.'
So far all they'd gotten from him was that there was a hurricane incoming, and the Grounders were preparing for it, so the delinquents started battening down the hatches as well.
'Steve's fine with me,' Bruce put in, and Thor nodded. 'He is fair. I am pleased with this arrangement.'
Natasha followed him. 'I met Loki outside,' she said in a low voice, sitting down next to where he'd collapsed.
But soon the hole was a considerable size and he climbed up and pushed himself through it. There really was no elegant way to achieve that. If anyone walked through that door they would see his ass and his legs kicking in the air like there was no tomorrow.
But everyone unanimously agreed that putting children on death row was inhumane, so they got to be put in holding cells instead. And once they turned eighteen, they were floated - tossed into space. That punishment was non-negotiable. It was a waiting game.
Sure enough, the fibers of the rope began to fall apart and he easily snapped it. His head still hurt like a bitch and so did the cut on his leg, but at least he could move around now.
Clint quickly earned himself a high rank because of his precision shooting and his excellence at the bow and the arrow, and eventually Fury became a father figure in his life. He was assigned to the special group of people always around Fury, good enough to be his bodyguards, and life was finally taking a good turn for him when everything came crashing down.
'I'm sorry, I really am,' Tony said sincerely, breaking away. He'd never meant for Rhodey to get so anxious about him.
Bruce liked to stay under the radar. He liked to stay back, not get involved, live his life peacefully with no drama.
Loki coolly looked at the tall flames leaping higher and higher a short distance away and then went right back to making his own. 'It's too crowded, and besides, they're cooking that deer you found earlier with your buddies. I'm sick of that smell.' Thor sighed and sat down next to his adopted brother. 'It's not that bad, you know. The smell,' he said, just to be saying something. Loki didn't even acknowledge him.
'Why is it that I always find you three bickering like three-year-olds whenever I come by?' said a very familiar voice, and Steve's heart both skipped a beat and then sank.
'Hey,' she said. He must've discerned the fatigue in her voice because his eyes softened and he stood up straight.
'Do not worry. Even a hammer as mighty as this one could not make a dent in a skull as thick as yours,' Thor teased back, surprising himself with the ease at which the insult was delivered. Mocking was Loki's forte, and he'd never been good at it, but there was a first time for everything, and Thor was proud of himself.
'They might, you never know. What if they trip onto a chainsaw? Or into a pool of lava, or some shit like that? It's game over then, boys -'
Tony whirled on him. 'Nothing? Are you dumb, Rogers? The entire world is out to get us and you're saying it's nothing? Not everyone has lived the happy-go-lucky, perfect American life you've had, okay? Stop acting like dumb shit like this is going to change anything. We're screwed and that bald dickhead in space is doing nothing to help us!'
Clint didn't care much for any of the fancy gear and the new age weapons. He made a beeline for the other side of the room, where he saw a template of a diagram of an arrow with added features and several heavy steel boxes that had 'handle with care' stamped on the side.
Steve asked him what his terms were, and he had told him that he would only release Tony only on the condition that he got justice for what happened to him. Steve asked him what justice meant for him, and Rumlow had simply replied, ‘Justice means an eye for an eye.’
He felt a steady hand on his shoulder, pushing him aside, and he obeyed, moving back as the new person knelt beside the dying girl.
'They're sending you to Earth, Steve! They're running out of supplies, they can't hold so many people anymore! Find Bucky and stay together, I already told him! I love you!' 'I love you too!' he shouted back desperately, trying to keep sight of her, trying to understand what she'd just told him, but she faded into the crowd.
However, he liked the company. His newfound friends not only seemed to like him, but they even tolerated his jokes, which put them pretty high on his list of people he would choose to go to a deserted island with. Also, they were great at hand-to-hand combat, which meant that Clint no longer had to worry if some dickhead took him by surprise and tried to do him in at close range.
He propped himself up on his elbows. He was in someone's tent, lying on the mess of sleeping bags and sheets they had inside. He wasn't wearing anything except for his boxers. Was he really that drunk last night? To be fair, it was Unity Day. He was allowed to have a little fun, right?
'Yeah, well, first off, she's using a pistol, secondly, no idea where she learned it but she's awesome at using a gun. Which you are not.'
HYDRA didn't have any airborne vehicles, which was their only hope. They needed to either find a place where the river was shallow enough to cross with all their equipment intact - which would be quite a distance away from the delinquent camp, judging by the force of the river - or they had to design waterproof equipment. Both options would take a long time.
As she curled up in her sleeping bag, the last thing she saw was the white flower, one of its petals torn off, lying on her open palm.
'Nat - please, just calm down - we'll find him, okay? We're gonna find him, he can't be that far, whatever took him should be just there,' Bucky told her softly, a hand on her shoulder. 'Just breathe. You're a tracker. He's injured - so that equals blood trail.'
Bruce decided he would stay for a bit longer and then try and make his escape. His leg muscles were aching.
Thor ignored Clint and Natasha's bickering and wandered away from them. He liked his friends, but their customs were different from his and they used far too much figurative language and sarcasm for him to hold a proper conversation with them.
The very year Steve got in, when they were fifteen, Bucky was sent on a reconnaissance mission to the Russian space station, Mir, and things went horribly wrong. There was a battle and Bucky's arm had been lost. SHIELD may be strict but they thankfully weren't monsters, and Howard Stark had made a new arm for Bucky, almost better than his old one.
Steve gave him a single anguished look and ran towards the others, leaving Tony staring after him, the rest of his words hanging in the air, unspoken.
He longingly thought of his home, Asgard, the little space station unregistered with the other twelve but instead floating around on its own, surviving by itself yet somehow managing to look far more beautiful than the steel-grey and blinding-white of the other space stations he'd seen.
His father looked just like how he had on the day he'd stood by and watched as the guards took Tony away, screaming, and then threw him into the jail cell. His button-down shirt and slacks were neatly pressed and ironed, and his short brown hair and mustache were combed and slicked back.
Steve nodded. 'You should rest. You're bleeding. In the morning we can continue. Everyone, back to sleep,' he ordered, and the delinquents slowly went back to their tents, whispering amongst themselves.
'C'mon, Stevie, you gotta be kidding,' James said angrily. 'These are the same people who killed Pietro and four other kids. They hurt Clint and want to get rid of all of us. You really think they're going to play nice now?'
Bruce felt faint. He reached up to wipe his nose and his hand came away red. He needed to find a cure for it or else they would all die.
Yeah. Keep telling yourself that and you'll eventually become so much of a clown that you won't be able to go anywhere without your fucking red nose, Rogers.
Tony curled up into a fetal position and closed his eyes. He could feel the world flipping over. Why was it flipping over? Why was everything so insane?
Much to Thor's surprise, Loki had come as well, his eyes inscrutable, his black hair slicked back. He hung out a good distance from everyone else, and as soon as they smoothed down the soil and stuck a piece of metal there to mark it, he left quickly, ignoring Thor. He didn't give any explanation as to why he was there in the first place.
'No, it isn't that -' Steve said desperately, but Tony was already turning away, his haughty mask back in place.
'She's right,' Bruce agreed. 'If we somehow make it to that bunker Fury was talking about there's got to be some sort of system to communicate with the Helicarrier, which was why Fury had chosen that specific bunker to land beside. Also, communicating directly with the Helicarrier is a more suitable way to convince them to come down than to crudely hint at survival with our steady ranks or whatever.'
Nothing was off yet. As far as Bruce knew, Steve had instructed him to tell parts of the truth and make it sound like important information or else if he was found out, they would kill him. He'd been told only to tell harmless truths, however, like the body count. HYDRA wouldn't benefit from knowing exactly how many delinquents were dead if they didn't know anything about the ones who were alive.
I know you're mad but doesn't mean you murder somebody, what the fuck?' Tony was saying, trying to catch the crowd's attention.
Clint recognized her as Darcy, the girl Thor said had a crush on him. Well, if a pretty girl who liked him was offering to share food with him - he didn't see why he should decline.
'No, no, I overdosed. I'm sorry for everything, Betty -' 'Stop saying you're sorry. You shouldn't be, no one could've remotely expected that to happen. We're all fine. Friends?' she asked, and offered her hand. Bruce shook it, smiling. 'Thanks, this really means a lot, Betts.' 'Think nothing of it. I could never hate you. What're you doing here, anyway?'
The words came unbidden. There was a pause and Tony realized what he'd said in his blind panic. He winced, wishing he could take it back, but the damage was done. He waited for what Steve would say.
new chapter, and it's actually done early this time :) bomb stuff - no way am i an expert, again, just following the plot of the 100, all i know is raven made a 3 part bomb with hydrazine, gunpowder and ignition and nothing else. steeb and tony being dumbasses in love and everyone still bleeding like crazy - the normal stuff, obviously.
He wasn't looking where he was going, still musing over Loki, when he bumped into someone. A short, definitely female someone.
He nodded. 'The god of thunder is my namesake! I will honor him in both character and choice of weapon,' he declared.
He sat up. He'd never seen a horse before, but they looked cool. He couldn't wait to see one in real life.
'But we are going to have to punish you,' Steve continued, ignoring Rumlow. 'We never meant to hurt anyone. We just wanted to find the killer. I don't know why you did it, but I hope you understand that what you've done is sick and fucked-up and we really can't have you in the camp anymore.'
Steve ventured further into the room. He realized that his first assumption was wrong - not everything was cleared out. There were several untouched boxes. He presumed that they hadn't gotten time to take everything with them - they'd only taken what they could carry.
Betty came over after everyone cooled down, her eyes troubled. 'Rumlow's got a strong argument going. He's managed to convince some other kids to throw away their wristbands as well. He says that if they come down, they're not going to forgive us. Habits die hard and they're gonna reinforce their rigid control over us - which obviously didn't go down well, not when we've just had our first taste of freedom,' she said in a rush, twiddling her fingers.
ACKKK the wonderful nxghtmarefuel (https://nxghtmarefuel.tumblr.com/) made the aesthetic moodboard for my fic and it's soooo pretty, thank you so much! i love it!
Steve said nothing. Tony, further angered by his lack of response, kicked at a barrel and it fell to the ground with a crash, spilling out grease, oil... and assault rifles.
While Steve was adjusting the other boy's grip, he realized he'd moved a lot closer to him that he'd actually meant to. He was right behind Tony, one arm hooked around him to move the gun a bit lower. He could feel the other boy's muscles through the thin material of his shirt.
'Are there any more? One gun isn't going to be very helpful in a camp of ninety-eight delinquents,' she remarked, and he was about to reply when he was cut off by a scream.
She explained that HYDRA had made a move on Unity Day. As they were having the celebrations, after the speech given by Fury, someone had set off a bomb. It had severely injured around fifty people and had killed twelve. Their doctors had so much work to do they needed all hands on deck as well as volunteers.
don't get used to this, i have highly inconsistent posting schedules, lmao. since it's quarantine i probably will be able to post a chapter almost daily, maybe every two days, since i really have nothing else to do, but i wouldn't trust myself and my constant companion, writer's block.
'Hey, it's alright. I know. They said some things to me. My mother, as well. It was all a hallucination, Tony, they don't really think that, you know -'
'Well, I mean... thank you, guys, I'll try my best,' Steve finally said, still blushing. Tony's grin grew wider and he kissed Steve on the cheek. 'Good luck, babe.'
They pushed past him and down into the trapdoor. There were stairs, but it was musty, dark and smelled horrible. Natasha tried her best to breathe through her nose as they made their way through HYDRA's outpost. The stairs led them to a long hallway with several hallways branching off from it. Loki, who seemed to know the place quite well, held a finger to his lips, went ahead, peeked through a doorway and gave them the thumbs-up.
He sighed and closed his eyes, sitting there in silence until somebody tapped him on the shoulder. 'Hey, you hungry?' a female voice asked. He opened an eye. 'Maybe.'
, Bruce tried to reassure himself. He decided to scratch his plan of escaping. He would sit there until the HYDRA agents left and then he would watch Loki very carefully.
'Hey, you're Bruce Banner, aren't you?' he asked, stopping right next to Bruce's little corner. Bruce adjusted his glasses nervously. 'Yes, I am.' Tony's face split into a wide grin and he sat down next to Bruce. 'You're the one who studied gamma radiation, aren't you? They gave you a PhD for that.'
Steve looked around, grabbed a rag and threw it to Tony. The other boy used it to pick up the rifle and then arched an eyebrow at Steve. 'Do you know how to use this thing?'
Bruce watched in horror as they pushed Rumlow's buddies onto the ground as well. They tried to shelter themselves by holding up their arms over their head but the crowd was absolutely brutal and didn't give them a chance.
'Take him to the drop ship,' Steve ordered, his words icy, his eyes hard. It was obvious he still hadn't gotten over the death of Mrs. Barnes. Bucky, who looked even worse, seized Rumlow by the arms and dragged him over to the drop ship, ignoring his yelps and whimpers.
He caught sight of black boots. He counted six. That meant there were three people. The black boots were part of HYDRA agents' gear. Loki had told them that the low-tier HYDRA agents all wore the same kind of gear, which was full black and just had the HYDRA symbol above the left breast.
Loki gave a short laugh, but there was no humor in it. 'You really don't get it, do you, brother? They hate me. The only person who ever loved me for who I am was Mother, and she's dead. Father wishes he never took me in, and Hela? I don't even think she knows I exist,' he said bitterly.
It was amicable and quite pleasant, if he was being honest. He actually liked sitting with Jane and looking at the stars. It was a nice change from the constant activity of the camp and the tension of everyone around him.
Tony had run off into the forest. Yeah, bad idea, but he wasn't thinking right. After Steve had literally rejected him, he wasn't thinking straight at all. He was so angry - at himself for naively believing, at Steve for not sharing his feelings, at his father for being the root cause for all his problems - at the world in general, really.
'Why are we playing volleyball with Barnes and why wasn't I invited?' a very familiar voice questioned. Tony Stark strutted over and grinned at him, slinging an arm over Clint's shoulders and ignoring the other boy's vehement protests that he was in fact, not a pillow for everyone to rest on and use as they please.
He took a closer look at her. She looked on the verge of tears, her bottom lip wobbling a little, but she was smiling down at him.
'No, no, it's fine. Bruce needs to rest,' Clint told her quickly, and she relaxed a bit in her chair.
Then he'd come out and seen the damage done by the acid and he'd thanked whatever spirit had given him the strength to run as fast as he did when he was in the jungle, because that very easily could've been him. They'd discovered the bodies of the other two delinquents who'd been trapped outside the drop ship during the storm as well.
He knew it was a bad idea - he was already weak from the sickness and he had been poisoned and stabbed a few days back, but he wasn't about to let Tony go out there alone and set up the bomb. He wanted to be there with him.
He stared at his sketch of Bucky, grinning mischeviously next to skinny Steve, an arm carelessly flung over his shoulders. Back then he'd towered over Steve, but when Steve finally hit his growth spurt at fifteen and began to work out, they became almost the same height.
this fic really goes well with ruelle's song 'game of survival', which is where the title of the fic is from. i really think ruelle is an underrated artist. they use her songs for tons of shows and movies but she doesn't really get recognized, so yeah, go check her out. also check out the 100 if you're ever looking for shows to watch.
Bucky sighed, realizing that if Natasha was coming there was no way he could carry his weapon, and handed his gun to a passing Scott, who looked startled, and then very delicately carried it all the way across the camp, keeping it at least a foot away from his body, and gave it to T'Challa, while Bucky watched with an amused look on his face.
Thor nodded. 'Lead the way,' he told her, and she set off towards the direction where the drop ship had landed.
Valkyrie looked on the verge of collapse. She was trying to hide it but he could clearly see it. 'Hey, I think she has a concussion,' he interrupted, and everyone turned to look at him. 'Maybe I should treat her first and then when she feels better she can explain why she was in the drop ship.'
'Yeah, right,' he said, much to her disappointment. 'I don't know, Romanoff, but there's a lot you're hiding.'
He walked over to the bonfire, cast a last glance at Loki, who'd gotten his fire going and was poking something into it, and sat down on the ground a few feet away. He heard a thud next to him. 'Hey, man, how's it going?' Barton asked cheerfully, stretching, and offered him a skewered piece of deer meat.
'He's coming,' Natasha confirmed, materializing behind Tony, her trusty gun on her hip as usual. Steve chanced a quick glance at Bucky, who was openly staring at her, and smirked.
No one said anything. Even Tony, who usually had a snarky comment on the tip of his tongue, was quiet.
Natasha stood up. 'So, you're saying if you can find out what's in that poultice, and if I bring back the ingredients for it -'
The lead Grounder stopped ten feet away from the delinquents. He got off the horse and approached them until he was standing just five feet from Steve.
They nodded to the guard at the gate - Drax - and set off in the direction of where the drop ship had landed. The forest was eerily quiet. They were all holding their guns in defensive poses, aware of the threat that lurked above their heads at every moment.
Thor was looking up, into the foliage, his eyes narrowed. 'Hey, buddy, what're you looking at?' Clint called. He shrugged. 'I have glanced upon what my forefathers called a squirrel.' Everyone scrambled over to the tree. If what Thor was saying was true, then the squirrel was the first sign of animal life they'd seen so far.
Clint craned his neck. He had excellent eyesight, a feature of his that had once saved Fury's life, but his hearing was rather poor. His brother had joked that when God made Clint, he accidentally made his eyes overpowered and decided to reduce his hearing to compensate.
After a few minutes Tony finally managed to connect the right wires, disable others and change the circuit, and he heard the familiar grinding noise as the doors of the drop ship began to open.
She turned back to Loki. 'Those are the first words you've spoken since you've been in here,' she replied coolly, avoiding his question.
'Also nearly died,' Natasha added, sucking in a deep breath. 'We saw them. The ones who took you. They're people. Normal people. They look like us, act like us - I don't know how, but they're on the planet, and they're human beings, and they're pissed off.'
Once they were done, Steve gestured for Bruce to close the door of the drop ship, told everyone else except for Clint and Natasha to clear out, and stood in front of Rumlow, who refused to meet Steve's eyes.
She'd reported of the situation in the Helicarrier. Most of the people were weak from lack of oxygen and the very young and the very old were already dead. The catastrophic damage from the untimely drop of the first Exodus ship was nowhere near fixed. Fury had been talking to the other space stations but they were either unwilling or unable to help, seeing as none of them had space for around two thousand people.
Steve groaned in frustration. 'What are we, Tony? A one-time thing? A fling? An actual relationship? I really don't know, and it's stressing me the fuck out -'
Steve was standing behind him, holding a gun, his face determined and his jaw set. When Tony looked back at the trees he'd been facing before, an injured Grounder was glaring at him viciously. Tony scrambled backwards, managed to get on his feet and ran.
The same thing seemed to occur to Natasha and she shouted Clint's name just as Clint's eyes widened and he dropped his bow.
They spent most of the evening in companionable silence, occasionally chatting with their friends or discussing the storm. Bruce brought with him the solemn news that three of the delinquents were nowhere to be seen on the drop ship and that they'd probably been stuck in the acid fog.
Steve ignored him and turned to Thor. 'Tomorrow we'll send a scouting party. You, me and Natasha. That's all. No one else.'
She jerked her chin towards where the massive blond was holding Rumlow in place, shouting something indecipherable from their distance. 'I don't get it. Why would anyone be so idiotic?' Bruce frowned. 'Yeah, none of us get it, either. Sometimes I feel like the human race got what was coming to it,' Pietro said unexpectedly.
'Yeah, well, let her think what she wants,' Natasha muttered, collapsing on the couch and closing her eyes.
Jane, true to her word, appeared in front of him, her hair tied back in a ponytail and a wide smile on her face.
Steve made it to the far left corner and waited. Rumlow moved forward, finally letting the pistol drop to his side. Steve immediately began to scan the drop ship. With the threat of the bullet no longer keeping him frozen, he could look for an object to possibly overpower Rumlow with.
They were near a large body of water and ruins of what was once a house, or several houses. Steve approached a broken-down pile of bricks that looked like they were once part of a wall. He touched it and it instantly crumbled. Wincing, Steve stepped away, wiping his fingers on his pants.
He fell to his knees and crawled over to where he'd carelessly thrown his backpack onto the ground. Water, his hazy mind told him, and he pulled out his water bottle and chugged it down, spilling water all over his shirt.
There was a short moment of silence when Bucky yawned again, stretched and punched Steve lightly in the shoulder. 'I'm gonna look for food. You coming with?' Steve shook his head and Bucky shrugged. 'Your loss.' He sauntered away and towards the drop ship.
'You can get your stuff and go now. Take just one knife,' Steve said firmly, and the four delinquents trooped off to the drop ship, Rumlow and his gang muttering in hatred. Bruce sighed. They were supposed to be the good guys, weren't they? Yet somehow Rumlow had nearly died for something he hadn't even done.
'Yeah. He went into the woods earlier. Thought you'd asked him to, didn't check it out,' he said nonchalantly.
'Jesus, Barton, give a warning or something, I nearly had a heart attack,' he complained, as Clint leaned over and took a swig from the water bottle.
Thankfully Tony had laid off the flirting, and although he occasionally made eyes at Steve, he was focused on talking to Bruce, Rhodey and Pepper, and Steve's face slowly returned to its normal color. Bucky emerged from the drop ship in a much better mood and handed Steve some of the dried beef jerkin they'd sent down with the delinquents, much to Steve's relief, because he was, in fact, hungry.
Tony shrugged. 'Either way, you're pretty awesome. I've always wanted to meet you. Your work is incredible.' 'Thank you, thank you so much,' Bruce told him, smiling despite himself. He'd always thought Tony Stark was an arrogant, holier-than-thou sort of person, judging by the way he acted on camera, but his impression of Tony so far was the opposite of that.
Out of the corner of her eye, she saw the boy with the crooked grin and the messy blond hair who'd been sitting next to her on the Quinjet. He was leaning against the tree next to the pile of rocks she'd chosen as her perch.
'There are new developments. A lot of new developments. I assume you already met HYDRA's latest experiment?' he questioned, pushing through the delinquents and standing a good distance from Bruce and the others in the drop ship.
Thankfully he'd already walked half the distance to camp when they spotted the storm. They'd started running but it was faster and the front line caught up to Clint maybe six hundred meters from the camp, and he'd screamed so loudly he was pretty sure the others in the bunkers could hear it.
Steve was in the makeshift medical bay - the bunker with the bed. He had worsened greatly. He was spasming and twitching convulsively, covered in sweat, and he looked nauseous. Bruce was by his side, anxiously pressing cool cloths to his forehead, holding a cup of water.
Natasha was eyeing Loki. She looked just as hesitant as Thor. When she looked up to meet his gaze, he saw his own uneasiness reflected there, and he was glad to know he wasn't the only one watching their backs. As much as he loved his brother, Loki was calculating and cunning from a young age. He always had an ulterior motive.
'I mean, she'll live. I just hope she'll cope with it in a healthy way. Right now she's still grieving but I bet in a few hours, when reality sinks in, she'll be obsessed with finding his killer.'
'Yeah. Um, okay. I wanted to ask if you were willing to come to an agreement with us -' Steve began, but he was cut off.
'Hey, what are you doing?' an angry voice said, and Tony turned to see the blond Adonis from earlier glaring at him. His smirk grew wider. 'What does it look like I'm doing, handsome? Don't you want to see the view?' He winked, purposefully striking a pose mid-air, and the blond boy blushed furiously, looking around to see if anyone had noticed their little exchange.
'They do,' Tony said, sitting up straight, his voice suddenly firm and steady. 'They think every single bit of whatever they said to me. My father, he hates me. He wishes I wasn't born. I was a disgrace to him.'
'I love meeting people from other space stations, too. I haven't the vaguest idea of astrophysics, but I was training to become the next Chancellor, back in Asgard,' he said genially, and Jane opened her mouth to say something when another girl barreled into her.
'Don't listen to him, Rumlow, he's just a whiny baby,' one of the other boys sneered. The leader of their little group - Rumlow, or whatever his name was - turned to the blond. 'Don't tell us what to do, Rogers. We aren't listening to you. We spent our whole lives held in place by those fuckers up there and as soon as we're free for the first time in years you decided to lord it over us.'
