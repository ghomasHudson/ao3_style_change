“Yeah, uh...congratulations,” Sam said, still frowning worriedly between Dean and Castiel.
Wesson winced, spreading his hands. “The Water Test should be infallible. I wish I could see, could study the Creature.”
Castiel waved a hand. “I feel safe with you, Dean.” Offering Dean a bit of a crooked smile, he added, “You're not as intimidating as you think you are.”
After a while Dean released Castiel's finger and lightly kissed the tip. Castiel couldn't help smiling as he quietly drew the touch of power needed to heal the wound.
Dean stared at Sam a little stupidly. “About...him.”
“Yeah, working on his
But Dean's mind had kind of gone to static in that moment in his dingy little kitchen, at the idea that someone
“I do,” Castiel confirmed.
Dean smirked, shooting a quick sideways glance at Castiel. “About having sex with me?”
“Dean,” Sam tried, “that doesn't count.”
That wasn't exactly a terrible idea, but... “You're—we're....still going to do something today, right?”
“Cas?” Dean let go of Castiel's wrist to put his hand against Castiel's cheek and guide his face back to looking at him. “Just so we're clear: I am interested. Exactly that way.” Maybe it wasn't the best line he'd ever used, but maybe it still got his point across. Leaning in, he brought his lips to meet Castiel's, gentle and tender, like something from one of Sam's chick-flicks, exactly the way a 'just proposed and got accepted' kiss should go.
“Castiel Novak. Nice to meet you, Charlie,” Castiel shook Charlie’s hand. “So are you two... dating as well?”
“Yeah. That,” Dean said and refused to look at Cas.
“Be aware, Cas. Charlie will have all your background information and life story collected before you even know it.”
“Yes. Of course. I was just lost in my thoughts.”
“May I kiss you?” Cas asked, breaking Dean out of his deep thoughts.
Cas took the lube in his hand and covered his hands with it. With his other hand he touched Dean’s cock, and he slid the other one over his perineum all the way to his hole. Dean gasped.
That night Dean cooked them dinner. (“Hey, you haven’t tried
“Hey Cas!” Charlie said brightly, when she opened the door. “Oh jeez, what happened to you?”
“Mmm, I thought you liked my food.”
“Live action roleplaying and a tabletop game. Basically she runs her own kingdom in both.”
“Yes. I have been… surprisingly busy.”
“And for Christmas we’re going to have a whole bunch of people coming. I’m actually not sure all of them fit in here, but I guess we manage somehow.”
In Cas’ opinion, Dean’s smile was brighter than any of the fireworks.
“Good. Make sure you do. Dean will drive me insane, unless something happens soon. And by something I mean action.”
Cas was quiet and kept playing.
Cas didn’t have to play a proper host to all his guests, because apparently all his guests could make themselves at home anywhere they were. They refused to accept help from Cas with anything and just told him to sit down and relax, because he helped enough by providing a place for them all to eat and for many of the guests to sleep. Ellen, Jo and Bobby were the ones who were supposed to stay at Cas’ place, but Cas expected that at some point he would have to pull out some extra blankets and pillows just so all the other guests could stay over should they so choose.
“Don’t worry. We could twist the character a bit so that it’s like a court wizard type of thing. That means you would get to spend most of the game with Charlie, because Charlie plays the queen…”
Cas was done with talking for now. Dean’s words made him want more than just mutual confessions of love and Dean’s fingers in his hair made him long for less clothes between them.
“That sounds nice. I don’t keep a busy schedule, so I’m free pretty much all nights and weekends.”
“Just a long day at work. Can I come in?”
“Happy New Year, Dean.”
“I’m close. Give it to me,” Dean asked between hard breaths.
“Hmmm, I think I take the challenge, Dean. I don’t think my eye-hand coordination is lacking either. We should definitely try a match.”
“I don’t think so, Gabe. I’m sure Dean has been over me for a long time. I cannot expect the feelings to last for a decade and stay the same.”
“Did you hear, Charlie? Cas is gonna come over for Thanksgiving. And we can borrow his house for Christmas!”
“Ah, sorry. I have several new workers coming to meet me this afternoon. I have their paperwork and work ID’s, so could you please call me down to meet them at the lobby when they arrive around 2 PM? I have a list of them here.”
“So… Uh.”
“There may have been other benefits involved in our friendship too, but we kept it secret. Dean’s dad was… shall we say difficult person and not tolerant of anything else than masculinity and complete heterosexuality from his sons. And there’s a reason why Gabe is my only relative I still keep in contact with. My family didn’t welcome my sexuality with open arms either.”
“So yeah, I live with Charlie for now. Makes it easier when our lives overlap so much anyway with work and hobbies and neither really having family nearby.”
”Dean is not the most open person about his sexuality,” Charlie said. “He’s not straight, you know?”
“Whew. When those are ready, I think that’s everything.”
“You never know when you have to. At least I know where I can find an oven big enough to roast a whole turkey.”
Gabriel sounded frustrated and fond at the same time.
“Alright, sir.”
“Did I ever tell you about how I broke off things with my parents?” Castiel asked. The air was crisp, and he could smell a hint of winter in the cold air.
Cas didn’t ask more about why John Winchester had so many different ID’s. They had talked about what John had done for living a few times, but mostly Dean had just told him that Cas wouldn’t want to know and that not even Sam knew, so Castiel had stopped asking. It was Dean’s history, Dean’s family, and in time he might share some more of it and if he didn’t, Castiel wasn’t going to pressure him.
“It was not… pretty. Bobby almost shot dad when he forced dad to leave. I finished high school, got a job, and then Sam convinced me to look into scholarships and possible colleges. I had gotten some experience with fixing cars when I was working for Bobby’s garage, so I thought engineering might be fun. I got in, somehow paid my way through college without insane debt, and got a job here.”
“Yeah. Austen died unmarried. I don’t know if she even knew what happened after the happy ending.”
Bobby waved at his hand dismissively.
Bars or clubs had never been Cas’ scene. He always preferred nights spent with his chosen people. In college and after it, he had learned to tolerate parties at people’s homes, which had nothing to do with the memory of one particular home party years and years ago, but he still mostly didn’t like going out to drink just so he could party the night away. The music was always too loud, and the other people couldn’t keep their hands to themselves. It was much more comfortable to just stay home or go at someone’s home and have a few drinks where he could have actual discussions and hear what other people were saying.
“Dean, Charlie was definitely right. This is enough for at least fifteen people.”
“You don’t have to do that, Dean.”
“Of course we want you here, Cas,” he said gently. “Now, go clean up your face and hands and go check if Charlie has all the plates and things at the dinner table already.”
After third finger, Dean was breathing hard and moaning any time Cas even moved.
The dinner was a chaos in the best possible way. Cas ended up sitting between Dean and Sam, and he kept being pulled into discussions and asked a lot about himself. Gabriel kept giving him knowing looks from the other side of the table. Luckily he too seemed to have a good time in this group of complete strangers. Gabe had always been more social than Cas though, so it shouldn’t have been a surprise.
When Castiel stood in the kitchen with Dean, preparing the food for the evening, all these thoughts went through his head and he realized he had somehow, without meaning to, fallen back in love with Dean Winchester. For the longest time he had thought it was just the teenage love, that time had gilded the memories, and he had just put Dean up on a pedestal in his teenage mind. But now as an adult having experienced both dating and sex with people he had been attracted to, Dean Winchester still was above all others in Castiel’s mind.
“If you’re going to say the both of you don’t want to fuck each other’s brains out, you’re a filthy liar and there’s no helping you. What’s even
“Yeah, you do. As Bobby always says, family doesn’t end with blood. We’re going to have a Thanksgiving dinner with Charlie, but now you’re coming too.”
The way Dean looked at him in the robes made Castiel feel self-conscious though. He felt it would be fun to take part in a hobby that Dean and Charlie clearly enjoyed so much, but he also thought there was a considerable possibility of him making a complete fool of himself in front of them both.
“Then how do you… Oh. Oh. I think there’s a story here. Let’s hear it then.”
Charlie was gone, before either of them could say anything. Cas suspected he’d been brought along just to keep Dean company while Charlie was chatting up people.
“Holy fuck, that feels so good,” Dean gasped. “Please, Cas, please.”
Cas stared at Bobby.
“Would you care to clarify that statement?”
“I told you I have read the book, Dean. I didn’t expect the movies to be short either.”
Cas slid down Dean’s body back between his legs and let his fingers continue their work. He teased Dean’s hole until it felt a little loose and then he carefully pushed a finger inside.
Castiel felt silly in the costume, although Charlie was gushing about him looking adorable in the long robe type of clothing. Luckily the costume didn’t have a hat, but it did have a hood just in case he wanted to look more mysterious or hide his identity. The robes were warm but it was surprisingly comfortable.
“You know. I always found kissing to celebrate the start of a New Year such a delightful cliché,” Charlie said casually before going to get more snacks.
“Yeah. I’ll get you a drink if you beat me again. I’ll  begin this time.”
“I like the sound of that. I also like the idea of making breakfast and after that coming back to bed for round two.”
“Well yeah. He was clearly missing you too, although I never put it all together until a couple of years later. John was dead and after building up the Impala, Dean just sat in the car staring into the distance. Finally I got him to open up about it. He told me he had a friend he had left behind in some small town, and he kept wondering if you’d be home for the summer from college like he was. He wanted to drive to your town just to see you.”
“He told that they lived with you, so they could finish high school and apply for colleges. He didn’t go into details.”
“Anyway, the most important question is, did you have fun?”
“I hope you know it’s creepy to stare at sleeping people.”
“Is there something stopping you? Horrible haircut? Beer belly? Ugly beard?”
He pushed Dean to sit on the bed while he removed his jacket and shirt.
“Yeah, if you ever want to try a match at a computer pool, I’m sure I will beat you both. Meanwhile I’m going to get a drink and let you boys play with your sticks and balls,” Charlie said. “I also saw the pretty lady over there giving me some eyes, so wish me luck.”
Castiel sighed. He was sure he wasn’t being that obvious. On the other hand Dean couldn’t be that obvious because Cas still wasn’t sure Dean even liked him like that. He never flirted with Cas like he did with other people. He just talked with him, but that’s what friends did, right? Just because they often, lately even most of the time, sat together and spent most of the evenings just chatting together didn’t mean Dean wanted anything romantic or sexual to happen between them. It was just one of those things.
Leaving before it hurt too much might have been easier, but at this point Cas was sure that Dean would find him where ever he went.
Dean Winchester was the most wonderful person Castiel had ever met. For a moment Castiel felt overwhelmed with his feelings for the man, who had so much love to give to everyone around him and who would do anything to care for and to protect the people around him.
“Thanks, Cas. Really. We can go over whatever else you need to know and any questions you have tomorrow. Good night.”
with a number written under it.
“Mmm, sorry,” Cas muttered against Dean’s collarbone.
“We need to go over the results of the meeting with Dean in the afternoon, but basically we can do it anywhere if needed,” Charlie said and pointed at her laptop bag. “So you two have time to catch up, and I have time to get to know you, Cas.”
Charlie sat with her phone still in her hand, but she was staring at Cas.
While they were talking Dean spotted them and stopped next to them.
Dean’s voice had matured and turned lower since Castiel had known him in their teenage years.
Dean wrapped his legs around Cas and pulled him into a hard kiss full of tongue and teeth.
“Gabe? Are you still there?”
“Mmm, I like the striptease. It’s like the present is opening itself,” Dean said.
“Cas?” Dean said. He seemed to be going through a similar attack of feelings as Castiel was, but also seemed to get over his shock a lot faster.
“Sure. Dean isn’t home though. I think he’s out with Benny.”
“Gabriel, I’m not twelve. Or a virgin.”
“Dean? We’re going to be late,” someone said behind Dean. Castiel looked at the young, red-haired woman who was with Dean, and now had identical visitors’ badge around her neck.
“I don’t think you’re in denial of your feelings for him. What you fail to see is that when you look at him, he always looks back at you. He stops any conversation he’s having with anyone else just to say hi to you. He comes to a room and looks disappointed if he doesn’t see you there. Bro, he’s fucking gone on you. He likes to play it cool because you’ve given no indication that you want the same. And I must say your man is horrible at flirting with people who actually matter.”
“What do you mean? I didn’t… I haven’t saved Dean at any point.”
“So, yeah. It helped to give me something to do instead of focusing on my anger towards dad or sadness.”
“Sam’s on his way of becoming a hotshot lawyer in California. He got a full ride at Stanford of all things. It made the money situation a lot easier, I can tell you.”
“I’ve already done some while you were making rounds. The wine glasses are in the kitchen unless I missed some, I took all the plates people forgot to bring into the kitchen as well, and I think the guest took some of my balloons with them. Oh well. There’s mostly vacuuming and doing the dishes left for tomorrow.”
“THREE. TWO. ONE. HAPPY NEW YEAR.”
“I don’t think that’s going to be a problem,” he said, looking at Cas.
“THE HANDMAIDEN. THE QUEEN’S HANDMAIDEN,” Charlie shouted again.
“You never told me, how you got the Impala. I thought you didn’t talk to your dad after you stayed with Bobby?” Cas asked Dean one night when they sat on the porch.
“Riiiight. So what I’m hearing is that you should just man up and ask him out and you could enter the world of lovely committed naked tango kind of bliss.”
Charlie turned around and looked at Cas with a thoughtful expression.
“I have friends, Gabe.”
Castiel sighed deeply when he saw his brother’s name on his phone screen. He had avoided talking to Gabriel for a few weeks since he had been so busy at work and with other things. It wasn’t like he wanted to keep meeting Dean again as a secret from Gabe, but he knew Gabe more than anyone could make him reveal his feelings out loud.
Cas kissed Dean a lot gentler and pushed inside.
“Hey, don’t worry. Dean’s definitely not going to let you go. Now, interrogation is over. Do you want to watch a movie? I might have some things Dean thinks too silly to show you in my collection!”
“Do tell,” Cas asked, fearing that Gabe was going to tell him, he was acting in some ridiculous way around Dean.
Gabriel laughed.
“Cas? You okay?” Dean’s voice shook Castiel out of his reverie.
Cas put his hand on Dean’s shoulder. They were almost as tall which made this much easier to do.
“He… talked about me? About missing me?”
“Yeah. With all these confessions I think I have to tell you that I borrowed that book from you just so I could say goodbye. I promised I would. I did actually read it though.”
He sent the message before he had time to overthink it. Just when he was starting to think he should clarify his intentions, his phone beeped.
Dean Winchester was an amazingly human person. He had a wide variety of issues from the abuse and neglect he had undoubtedly suffered in his childhood, going from fear of abandonment all the way to doubts of self-worth, but he was also loving and smart and caring and funny.
Castiel picked a new level in the game.
“Yeah,” Dean sighed.
At some point Charlie came to him.
While waiting in the line, Castiel was watching at the other people in the lobby. Most of them were just giving their names and taking their visitors’ passes, before taking off, and there were several of Castiel’s coworkers doing their thing, but one couple had stopped in front of the reception desk to chat up the woman behind the desk. The receptionist was giggling while giving them their visitors’ passes, and the tall man looked pleased with himself when he turned away from the desk and put the lanyard around his neck.
“Brilliant! This one always makes food for an army of people which doesn’t make sense if it’s just the two of us. If you help him in the kitchen you can also maybe stop him from making extra servings of everything.”
Dean and Charlie looked each other again and seemed to have a complete conversation with their eyes, although Castiel didn’t know what they tried to tell each other. After a moment Dean turned back to him.
“I don’t want this to be awkward, but I had really good time today. Charlie said she’d like to meet you again too and told me to ask you to come visit us sometime. You might meet some of our other friends too.”
The lobby seemed to be unusually full, and Castiel cursed himself for forgetting that there were several negotiations with other companies going on today. No wonder that the reception didn’t have time to answer the phone.
“It’s just a friendly conversation. You’re my friend too. I like to be on top of things.”
“Give me the condom? I told you it might make the clean-up easier.”
Cas smiled and nodded.
“Hello, Gabe.”
“College friends who you meet twice a year don’t count, Cassie. I think you haven’t had a real friend since you were sixteen.”
“What are you doing here, Ellen? I didn’t know you were in town yet!”
“I’ve not even said his name once in this conversation but you know as well as I do, who we have been talking about.”
“Dean, we should let Cas go back to his job. Cas, from Dean’s description I knew you’d be brilliant, and I wouldn’t mind at all if you joined our friend group.”
“I… have been spending time with some people.”
“Of course I have to,” Gabriel said. “So you have somehow managed to find friends?”
, is the way you look at him. You don’t just want to get dirty with him; you actually want to hold his hand and take long walks on a beach and be sickeningly sweet with him.”
“I had fun. Thank you both,” Cas said when they were standing back in front of Castiel’s workplace.
Apparently he had made an impression though, because Dean kept asking him to spend time with them after that as well. Some people Castiel liked, like Charlie, who was an all over bubbly personality and got overly excited about anything she liked. She was also super smart, and seemed to like Castiel, even though most of her references to popular culture went right over Castiel’s head. Some of Dean’s friends Castiel wasn’t as fond of, like Benny, who was one of Dean’s best friends and kept calling Dean ‘brother’. Neither of them never told Castiel how they had met, and even though for a week or so Castiel thought Dean might be dating Benny, Dean just brushed that off and denied it was like that. Not like it was any of Castiel’s business who Dean dated anyway, but it was somehow a relief to know Dean was not in a relationship.
“Do you have intentions of feeding a whole army out of my kitchen any time soon?”
“Um, yeah. I’d like that.”
“Then I’m glad you both were saved.”
“That sounds acceptable.”
“Hmmpfh. I just like cooking, that’s all.”
“Yes. Yes, I did.”
“You’re so amazing. I can just finger you if that’s what you want?” Cas turned Dean’s head with the hand he’d been using to work on his cock and gave him a gentle kiss.
“What’s the tradition?”
“You don’t need that, by the way,” Dean told him. “I’m clean.”
“He has the closet door open but still another foot in fucking Narnia. Personally I blame it all on his dad,” Cas said, just when he finished the level and the game started throwing confetti on his scoreboard.
On the other hand, Dean was a master of avoiding a subject if he wanted to. Maybe it was time to let actions speak louder than words.
“Yeah right. And both trying not to think about each other without any clothes on. Having sleepovers at each other’s place. Dancing naked tango together. If the sexual tension between you is similar to what it was ten years ago, there’s no way you haven’t already been on a date.”
While Dean was overwhelmed with feelings, Cas could sneak in another finger. He wrapped his lips around Dean’s cock and enjoyed the sounds Dean was making. Little gasps and whimpers and shouts made Cas hard in his pants even when he hadn’t even been touched yet.
Castiel considered the information.
“So Cas, do you have big plans for Thanksgiving and Christmas?”
“Dude, you could make a meal for a whole army in here. This is my kind of kitchen for sure.”
“TEN!” someone shouted nearby. “NINE.”
Castiel’s phone rang late one night just as Castiel was about to go to bed and seeing that it was Dean, Castiel still answered the call.
“You are my queen, Charlie.”
Gabriel had never stopped laughing at Castiel for working in human relations. However, even though Castiel was the first to admit that his “people skills” were “rusty”, he managed to be very good at solving the everyday problems HR people faced in their work. Castiel was fascinated with people and wanted them to feel their work was appreciated and relevant. Somehow he was also a very good judge of character and almost always succeeded at finding the right people for the company. At first the bigger bosses had objected to Castiel’s choices, criticized him for not looking at the numbers and costs enough, but since Castiel’s approach of putting the people first and actually rewarding them for a job well done had ended up making the company more money, Castiel had been left to do things his way.
“You? Busy with what? Too many books to read? It’s winter soon so you can’t be busy with your garden. Unless you have been working extra on top of your extra work, and in that case I hope they pay you well for overtime, you must be having actual living human contacts somewhere.”
“Thanks, Cas. I appreciate that.”
“Cas…”
After LARPing Castiel felt more secure about his friendship with Dean and truthfully a bit more relaxed. Dean also apparently felt the same, because he sometimes just appeared at Castiel’s door at nights they hadn’t planned on anything. Sometimes they watched a movie, but mostly they just talked about everything and nothing. Although they did also touch on difficult topics.
When everyone had seemingly gone back to minding their own businesses and stopped staring at them, Dean turned towards Cas.
“Sounds ideal.”
“Ew, no,” Charlie said quickly, as Dean made a disgusted face. “My preferences run in completely different direction. I like the ladies.”
“Yeah, but the movies are an experience of their own. I think they’re best as a marathon, but since Cas here is clearly a beginner, we should watch the first one now and the rest tomorrow.”
“That’s great! I got to go, but it was really fun to see you again. I’ll call you again to let you know time and place. Night, Cas.”
“Yeah, it was at a party, wasn’t it? You never told anyone… Holy shit! That was Dean?”
“Don’t stop! But no one has ever… you know. I mean they have and I have with fingers and toys and things, but…”
Cas couldn’t hear whether Dean answered her or not.
Cas laughed while still having most of his focus on the game.
“Most is already done, prince Charming. You can deal with the dishes tomorrow. I assume I don’t have to wait up for you to come home for the night?” Charlie said to Dean. “I fully intend to lock the door and not let you in anyway, so you need to find some other place to sleep.”
“Cas,” Dean’s smile was brilliant. “I’m sure everyone already knows about us.”
“Some of dad’s ‘friends’, or business partners, whatever, I don’t even want to know, got a message for us two days after the accident, one day after dad died. Dad didn’t leave a message for us or anything, before he died, but his friends let us know that they had taken care of dad’s things and his hospital bills and whatnots. I asked about the car through Bobby, and the next day dad’s friends had left the Impala on Bobby’s yard. It was basically just a pile of scrap metal, but after my first year of college I spent the summer with Bobby building it up again. I even got some extra credit for college when I reported on the project to my professor and showed her some pictures of the process.”
“You must try to find yourself a significant other who likes the same thing.”
“Dean?”
“That’s my personal mobile phone.
Charlie winked at them and left.
“He saved me too, by the way. He changed me just as much as I him.”
Dean looked at Castiel warmly.
“And you know what gives your feelings away?”
Dean’s arm brushed against his several times during the meal and every time it made Cas feel like he’d been given an electric shock. It too felt surprisingly right.
On the New Year’s Eve Dean came to help Cas with putting up decorations and bringing champagne glasses for everyone. Cas hadn’t actually invited anyone over, but Dean had let all of his friends know that they would be celebrating at Cas’ house. Charlie got a bit overboard with all her decorations and balloons welcoming the start of the New Year.
“You should know that the way people look is not what matters the most. But no. He looks the same. Older version of him in high school.”
“Thought you’d never ask.”
He was sitting in a small restaurant that was made to look like a medieval tavern with Dean and Charlie. They were all still dressed in their game costumes, and all around them other players were drinking and eating and talking among their own groups of friends.
“Hey! I don’t do that.”
“Certainly not you,” Dean mumbled and waved his hand to shoo Gabe away.
Castiel hadn’t celebrated Thanksgiving since he cut the ties with most of his family. Gabriel had never been much of a family celebration kind of person, although they did usually have a Christmas meal together. This time of year had for the last couple of years been difficult for Castiel, because he really loved all of the traditional holiday season celebrations, having lots of happy people in the same room, and he enjoyed cooking the dishes. Holiday season always reminded him of the more innocent time of childhood when he had still been blissfully ignorant of the problematic past of Thanksgiving and hadn’t yet figured out his family was a bunch of bigots that would disown him for just being himself. Without a family to celebrate with, it was difficult to have family celebrations.
Charlie also told her story, although Castiel could tell it wasn’t ’the whole truth and nothing but the truth‘. Brilliant computer queens probably had some secrets they liked to keep from strangers as well.
“Come on, babe. Fuck me. I know you want to.”
Dean stared at him before bursting out laughing. He poured a little more Scotch into their glasses.
“I’d like that. Although I think some of these people are just my neighbors and not at all your responsibility. I think they are surprised that I have so many people over since that has not really happened while I have lived here.”
“In a couple of months John came to collect the kids. I had seen it happen many times before. Sam always wanted to stay, but left with them kicking and crying, even when sometimes Dean had to carry him into the car. That time though… Well. Sam was in the middle of reading for a test, and Dean was finishing an essay, when we heard the sound of the car’s horn. Sam froze, but Dean seemed calm. I have never before or since seen him that calm and that cold. Instead of telling Sam to pack their bags, he told Sam to just keep on reading and that he would handle it.”
“I think we should ask the rest of the people to leave. Gabriel promised to take care of those people who still want to party some more. Most have already gone anyway.”
Dean rubbed at his neck.
Castiel agreed to watch one of Charlie’s picks, ‘The Princess Bride’, which made him completely forget his bad day at work. When Dean came home later in the evening, Castiel and Charlie were playing cards, telling awful jokes, and quoting lines from the movie almost every time either of them said anything.
Dean kissed him like he couldn’t keep that far from Cas for another moment, and Cas felt the floating feeling in his stomach again. This time though, he could just enjoy the feeling instead of fearing the consequences of his actions. He started to notice the sounds around him again, although processing Dean’s warmth and movements was still taking most of his brain power. Dean remained the focal point where all his thoughts concentrated on.
“Oh no, she’s going to interrogate you,” Dean warned.
“You, my dear little brother, are not as smart or observant as people say you are.”
“Hope you are sitting comfortably, Cas, because you’re not getting out of this house until you’ve seen them all. The extended editions are not short movies.”
“Yeah. He told me about your friendship and how thinking about you got him to pull himself free from his daddy and said you were the only reason he was in college. I thought I’d like to meet the kid who saved our Dean too, but he never drove down to look for you.”
Except this year.
When people started coming over on Christmas morning, Cas was getting more relaxed about the evening too. Meeting Ellen already helped, and Jo had already visited him as well, to help with the cooking and cleaning yesterday. Sam had sent a message that Jess had a flu and was staying with her parents to get back to health, so Sam was flying in without her. Bobby came in the morning and introduced himself to Cas gruffly, Charlie appeared not much later with bags full of Christmas gifts, and Gabriel arrived early afternoon bringing more than enough mayhem just with his presence.
Dean and Castiel stared at each other, until Charlie broke the tension with a cough.
“It was surprisingly easy for me. I’m sorry if I seemed unconvincing at any point,” Castiel said.
“You actually do the finger quote thing! That is adorable. I thought Dean was just messing with me when he told me.”
“So, what’s up? Anything I can do?”
Castiel wrote a quick message on his personal phone and sent it to Dean.
At the end of the night Charlie was the only one of them who had apparently been talking to people outside their group other than the bartender. She appeared back to them and announced that she got a phone number from the girl she had met.
“Yes! I swear you got yourself some new admirers too, with the scene you were showing off with your magical powers! I mean if I was even slightly into guys I might call it hot.”
Cas sighed deeply.
“I wanted to go with you that day. It was just an impossible dream but I thought that if I went with you we could find somewhere to call our own,” Cas said and for a moment he could feel the phantom pain of losing Dean all those years ago. “Even after we met again, I thought it just an impossible dream. I’m happy to be your friend, but you never gave me signs that you’d want to be something else too.”
Dean winced at the memory.
“You still know me so well. Charlie, burgers okay with you?”
“This is Charlie Bradbury. She’s my coworker and friend.”
“Me too, Cas. I’d like to see you again soon. Now that we live in the same city and all.”
The only time he had actually felt silly and got out of his character’s head was right after he had “done some magic” in the game. He couldn’t tell afterwards what he had said, but he had done his best to be authoritative and look like a menacing character who could destroy whoever was opposed to him. After his little display of power, he happened to look at Dean who was staring at him like he had never seen Castiel before. It made Castiel for a moment wonder if he had overdone it and if Dean was looking at him in horror for messing it up, but all the other end of game events began to happen so quickly that Castiel just decided to think about it after the game ended.
“So you… dated in secret?”
“Do you still have feelings for him?”
“Could you put these in the oven next, Cas?”
“Come on, Dean. You don’t have to do everything yourself. And I assure you Ellen is more help to you in the kitchen than I am.”
Dean took a drink out of his glass and looked somber. For a moment Cas thought Dean was angry with him for asking, and he was about to apologize for intruding into something that could be personal.
In reality Castiel’s days didn’t change that much through the months. This morning he had woken up, had a run in the early hours when it was still cool outside, had a shower and a breakfast, and now he was just finishing up his coffee before leaving for work. After work he would get  some groceries, come home, have  dinner, and usually read a book before going to bed. He didn’t have anything to complain about; he had a steady job, a small home with a small garden in the back, some friends from college living in the same city as him, and a big brother that liked to “surprise” him from time to time, trying to “get him out of his shell”, as he called it. Although Castiel’s oldest friend Meg did live on the other side of the country, and they barely got to see each other, maybe once or twice every year these days, she was a steady part of Castiel’s life too.
Castiel did love playing pool though. Promising him that there was a pool table at the place others were going was one of the only reliable ways to lure Castiel with them in a bar.
He was, not surprisingly, spending an early November Saturday afternoon at the apartment Dean and Charlie shared when Dean brought up the subject.
“I AM THE QUEEN, WINCHESTER,” Charlie’s voice shouted in the background of the call. Cas laughed.
Castiel rang the doorbell of Dean and Charlie’s apartment. He’d had a long day, and he just wanted to see some friendly faces. Usually he called beforehand, but this time his car had almost drove itself over here and before Cas knew he was in front of the door.
“Umm, alright? I think I can try it this one time,” Castiel answered even though he wasn’t at all sure he knew what he was getting into.
“You know, we’ve got to the point where romance novels usually end,” Dean pondered aloud. “Though with Austen it probably ended before even a kiss.”
“I don’t know what you are talking about.”
“Is this okay? If you want to do this in another position, I can…”
“Sure. Lead the way.”
“I’m a fast learner? I also did play some games in college, so I’m not a complete ‘newbie’.”
“Uh, yeah. Handmaiden then. But I’m also with the queen most of the time, so we would get to hang out together while playing around in silly medieval costumes. Charlie even promised to get you some robes to wear. Please say yes!”
“No, I want you to… fuck me.”
“I’m thankful for family we choose to keep. Both blood relatives and the people we choose,” Dean said.
“You don’t…”
Dean reached for the wrapper on the table and gave it to Cas. Cas pulled his fingers out and together they removed the rest of Cas’ clothes before Cas got on top of Dean again.
“Fine, we’re not talking about your boner for the Ken doll. But we’re going to continue the discussion later.”
“Don’t whine. It will be fine. Dean promised to help you clean up tomorrow. If you’d like his help, that is,” Charlie told him while she was arranging the balloons to stay in the right order.
Cas had a bag of chips in his hands and he carefully poured them into a bowl before answering.
“You’re very important to him. He enjoys your company more than Sam’s, and that’s saying something. And when he’s with you he kind of… lights up.”
“A rematch?” Cas asked innocently.
“You were amazing, Cas!” Charlie said. “If I didn’t know it I would have thought you’ve been LARPing for years.”
“So Cas, you remember me saying how your kitchen would be awesome for cooking for a whole army?”
“Thanks, Charlie. I think we should clean up a bit though?”
“I talked with Bobby on Christmas. He talked about how you fixed the Impala and thought about finding me,” Cas confessed.
“Yes, you do, Dean,” Castiel and Charlie said at the same time.
When fall turned to winter, Castiel was busy with work. Still he found it delightful to see his breath turn to mist one morning when he was leaving for work. It was a crispy morning with a hint of winter in the air, and Cas thought about how much his life had changed in a few short months.
“Do you want a drink?” Cas asked and took two whiskey glasses from the cupboard.
Bobby smiled at him.
The thought of sneaky Dean borrowing a book just so he could demand to return it before he left, made Cas feel warm all over. The day Dean left had been a bad one but as Anne Elliot said, when the pain was over it was now a sweet memory they could share.
“Ah,” Castiel cleared his throat. “Well.”
They did enjoy the party and even talked with some other people. Cas went to talk with the people he thought might be his neighbors, and Dean found some of his friends he hadn’t seen for a while. All the time, however, Cas was aware of Dean’s presence and where Dean was at any given moment. He wanted the party to be over already, because he just wanted to spend some time alone with Dean, even when it also meant he should put his feelings into actual words.
“No! Dean and I are not… It’s not like that. We are just spending time together.”
“What happened?” Cas asked, after Bobby seemed to fall silent.
“No need. I think they can stay for a while more. Some are already leaving on their own. Charlie will help us with moving things back inside when most of them have left.”
“Well, have you ever tried LARPing? One of our group fell ill, and there’s this large event coming up next weekend. You would get to play a wizard if you want to! It’s not a large part, and it can be done by a rookie player, but it’s kind of important for the story.”
“That was his own doing. His own work and talent that got him in a college. In the end Dean saved himself.”
Cas could almost hear how Gabe shook his head in disappointment at the other end of the call.
Castiel might as well stretch his legs and go down to the reception himself.
“I don’t mean saving him in a way where you save his life. I mean saving him from himself. Although that might’ve saved his life in the end too. He might’ve ended up like his dear old daddy.”
“Spit it out, Cassie.”
“Sit down, boy,” Bobby said, gruffly, and pointed at the empty place beside him on Cas’ own sofa.
Later that night when Castiel was relaxing on his couch with a cup of tea and a book and not taking in a word on the page he was supposed to read, his phone ringed.
Charlie’s face was full of understanding when she put her hand on Castiel’s arm.
“I wanted to. But in the end I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I always wondered whether you’d even want to see me after all that time. Whether you had any feelings for me anymore.”
“Kindly fuck off, Gabe. None of your dang business,” Dean told him as if the one fingered salute hadn’t been enough. Gabriel put his hands up in defeat.
Castiel Novak poured coffee in the cup and stepped on the porch leading to his backyard. In September the sun was still warm on his skin, but he could feel fall approaching. Somehow Castiel had always loved the atmosphere when seasons were changing. To him it didn’t feel like things were ending, but like something new was beginning.
Cas laughed. It was true that he hadn’t been deeply in love with Dean for all these years, but it was also clear to him now that he had never felt this way about anyone else. In the end it had been very easy to fall in love with Dean both times. There was no question in his mind that he would have fallen for Dean at any point between their teenage years and now.
“How the fricking frack are you that good in this game? Dean insisted that your house didn’t have any video games when you were growing up?” Charlie asked, frustrated.
“I do. I’m also thankful that you wanted me here today.”
“I trust Cas. I don’t know him as well as you do but I definitely think you’re going to get your ass handed to you, Winchester.”
. He could just as well text him now and get it over with.
“Yeah, Charlie is more like the little sister I never wanted.”
Dean grinned.
“Oh well, when I was 17, me and Sam ended up living with my uncle Bobby. He’s not really my uncle, but he had let us stay there before. I shouted at dad until he let us stay.”
He was also worried that maybe Dean’s family wouldn’t like him. He was an outsider in Dean’s circles and just because everyone had been welcoming to him so far didn’t mean that they would all be. The people who Dean had grown up with and who knew him best were completely different than Charlie or the others. Cas didn’t even know why he worried about it so much. It was partly because Cas being like family to Dean also made them Cas’ family, and he was scared that he would be kicked out of that family for being too odd like he had been kicked out of his own.
There was a moment of silence.
Now that I’ve found  you again, I have no intention of losing you.”
“Well yeah. He was my best friend. For a while at least. You remember the story I told about my first kiss?”
“Shh,” Cas put one finger against Dean’s lips. “We can talk later. Let’s just enjoy the party for now.”
“I love you, Dean. It’s not the wine or scotch talking. Not just the memory of you either, but you as the person you are now. And you don’t have to say it back. You don’t have to feel it back either. It’s enough for me that you know it to be true.”
“Uh. You know, it’s easy to, uh, make advances to an attractive guy you’ve only just met when you both are teenagers and you know you’re leaving the town anyway in a couple of months. It’s a lot harder to flirt with them as an adult who wants to keep them as a friend whether or not they want to share the foreseeable apple pie future with you or not.”
“Mmhmm, the trick was to get them not to throw me out for my queer lifestyle, but let them help me pack my things and move to a liberal university town, where I spent the next four years trying out all kinds of things that had been forbidden from me. Including dating other guys and coming out of the closet for my friends.”
“Please. So full, Cas. I want you.”
Castiel liked the changing seasons, because it felt like a celebration, like a rite of passage, something to look forward to. For at least ten years now, he had always felt like something in his life was missing. Familiar things changing made him feel like new things were possible.
“That wasn’t so bad, was it?” Dean asked.
“EIGHT.”
“Hey,” Dean said as he appeared next to Cas. “Thanks that we could come here for the night. And sorry for all the people. I didn’t expect this many to come. I guess people at my work brought spouses and friends and such so I don’t really even know all of them. I can help you get them out after midnight if you want to.”
“Well, we could uh...” Dean suggested, “shower together. If you like.”
“Eleven,” Adam corrected.
“Hey, the last time Cas and I went a week without talking was...” Dean frowned. “Um.” His cheeks heated a little. “Probably before we met.”
A grin spread out over Castiel's face and he chuckled, shaking his head. “I don't think I'd get very far with most straight guys at all, Dean.” He took a sip of beer, still grinning. “Much less if I tried to offer them lingerie.”
with Lisa.” Dean shook his head. “But she didn't want me.”
Dean winced. “I know. And I'm not changing my mind about that.” He pressed another kiss to the back of Castiel's hand. “But I'm just saying we don't have to do this
Castiel missed Anna and Balthazar terribly. Objectively it was probably best they weren't here, but he just—wanted to see them both, to hug them and tell them he loved them. Perhaps he should have asked for ink and parchment and written them a letter rather than simply sitting up with Wesson all night. Wesson would no doubt have fetched the things, even scribed if Castiel's hand had trembled or eyes blurred too much to write. But maybe Castiel just didn't want this to feel real.
“Thanks,” Dean says, accepting the flask from Benny and taking a swig before handing it to Castiel. Benny—as a surprise to probably no one—is skilled at using wood stoves, so they've got a cheery warm light to huddle around as they eat. They've got their damp shirts and soggy hats hanging wherever they could find a spot. The chair Dean's in has his shirt hooked on one side of the back and Castiel's on the other. Good thing everyone had a dry shirt in their saddlebags, since even with the fire going the cabin isn't exactly warm. The door doesn't fit right—not anymore, anyway. Settling's a bitch. And the ill-fitting door might not be the only source of drafts, but it's the biggest.
. We have time.” Hell, they hadn't even set a date yet. They could...put this off indefinitely if they had to.
“That's part of it,” Dean agreed. “But it's...more than that. I think.”
“He's selfish,” Castiel countered. “Which can be as bad.”
“I do talk a big game,” Crowley added with an unconcerned flick of his brows, “but in truth I haven't even been able to convince either of mine to take on a much more appealing masculine form.” Shooting Dean an encouraging little grin, he added, “Can you do the human one?”
Dean gaped at him. He'd known Castiel for more than five years now and this was the first he was hearing anything other than 'gay'. He shook his head, slightly dizzy from the alcohol. “You're what now?”
“On this matter, no,” Castiel answered truthfully. Balthazar's concern had been more about Dean's obvious demonic appearance. All Anna had said was to be careful.
Moseley nodded. “Contact with a Shade can have unpredictable effects. While not all Shades are destructive by nature, we know
Rolling his eyes, Sam flopped down on his back again. “You're the one who wants to marry him. I assume you've got your reasons, and to be perfectly honest I don't need to know the details.”
“And you've administered Blessed Water to your familiar at some point?” Wesson asked.
Castiel grimaced. “Do you ever...resent me, our bond?”
“You wanna ride a horse down the aisle?” Sam teased.
Castiel watched Crowley's exit with narrowed eyes then turned back to Dean. “We owe him a favour? That's what you offered him?”
“Never,” Dean told him. “Though,” he added with a chuckle, “this might go a bit smoother if one of us has some idea what he's doing.”
“Well, yes, but—” Dean sighed. “I think I'd prefer that to saying we're
Dean frowned. “Why would I?”
Offering them all a smile, Jess said, “I am about three and a half—almost four—months pregnant.”
Castiel stood and walked to the barred window, looking out into the incongruously pleasant night. It seemed so unfair that the moon shone so softly and the breezes blew so gently on this of all nights. “What would you do, had you the time?”
“No, I have,” Dean insisted. “I've had a lot of honey and alcohol—that's what Crowley's familiars, Meg and Ruby, eat the most. But we've had meat too. Venison mostly. It's nice.”
“I think most people hyphenate,” Dean responded.
Dean grimaced. “Why wouldn't I be fine? I should be...great, actually.” He shoved one hand back through his hair. “Tonight went...better than either of us could have hoped.” He worried the inside of his lip. “Right?”
with that?”
“Would we fit if Castiel or Dean took the bed?” Kevin asks, looking from the bed to the mess of half-placed bedrolls. “Because I really don't mind.”
“Well, let's see.” Dean dumps the rest of the saddlebags off the bed and he and Castiel lie down on their sides, both facing away from the wall. “Well.” Dean laughs. “It's certainly not the most relaxing or comfortable. But I think it's still a few steps up from bumping into that wood stove.”
Dean gaped at him. “I did
After a beat, Castiel commented, “Effectively.”
Raising his brows, Benny steps away from the wall and spreads his hands a bit. “I just don't want anyone falling off the bed.”
Castiel turned the teacup in his hands. “There certainly are a few things...texts and talismans and the like that I'd prefer not to lose, if possible. But the most important things...I never wrote down.” Taking Dean's hand, he turned a soft smile on him. “My true life's work? That's Dean.”
“No, I agree,” Castiel said, nodding. “It is none of their business and the only way we're going to normalize queer relationships is if we treat them the same as any other relationship.”
“I—” Dean cleared his throat. His cheeks did feel a bit hot, now that he thought about it. Damn it. “Well, I dunno what I've got to blush about,” Dean countered. “I'm not the innocent virgin.”
Reasoning that panicking couldn't really help, Dean made himself crawl out of bed and shower and shave and brush his teeth and even have a breakfast of toast and coffee.
“How many would you want?” Castiel asked softly.
Castiel shifted and rubbed at his arm through the material of his robe. “He's perfectly capable of getting most things for himself—he even cooks for me sometimes, especially when I get busy and distracted.” A soft smile stole onto Castiel's face. “He loves meat. And sweets.” Castiel pressed his lips together. “But he was craving blood, my blood. I was translating, trying to finish a particularly vexing paragraph. I said...once I'm done, but before I was done the knock came at the door begging our help.”
“Hey, I don't even want to wear a cummerbund,” Dean groused. His brows drew together and he pointed at Sam with his fork. “Sammy didn't have to wear one for his wedding.”
Sick worry and guilt twisted painfully in Dean's gut. “What'd I say, Cas? When I was drunk and...even stupider than usual. What did I say?”
Castiel considered that, nodding. “Okay, so you want to get married.” He rubbed at his arm and added, “Because you've got to that point in your life and you feel like you'd better do it soon before you lose your chance.”
“Well, you said...” Castiel frowned at the memory. “You said plenty of married couples, straight couples, aren't having sex.”
“Well, I...” Frowning, Wesson shifted some sheets of parchment in front of him and shook his hair off his forehead. “I feel like there must be something important that we're missing.” When Edlund raised a brow, he said, “For one thing, in your first listed possibility, the Water Test—I maintain that with valid Blessed Water a properly-administered test should be impossible to fool.”
“Oh,” Jess said softly as Sam just gaped.
Crowley's smirk turned into a grin and he stepped away from the wall to offer a smooth bow. “At your service.”
Castiel puts his hand over Dean's as though to keep it there and makes a quiet little contented sound, and Dean is so damn glad he's got his back blocking everyone's view of this. The blankets don't feel nearly opaque enough, even in the dark.
to ask but wasn't quite drunk enough to break whatever code of etiquette that happened to be, so Dean finally took pity on him, turning to look back out the window and saying, “First guy was Nick Munroe. He and I had a couple classes together second semester of my freshman year. He was...very into me, very obviously interested. I was...I dunno, Cas, I was young and stupid. I liked the attention. Liked how it felt. And I figured...” He shrugged. “I was in college, right? That's when you're supposed to experiment with stuff like that. So I went along with it.” He glanced back at Castiel. “Sam knows about this, by the way. It's not like I exactly kept it a secret.” Looking out the window again, he sighed. “It didn't exactly...go well, though. He was obsessive, controlling, demanding. So, uh, after I'd finally managed to drop his ass, I...tried again. With Aaron Bass. He seemed cool.” Dean scrunched up his face at the memory. “But it turned out he wasn't as into me as I thought.” He shrugged. “So, I mean, I just kind of gave up at that point. Went back to what I knew.” He made a vague gesture with one hand. “Experiment failed: subject is effectively straight.”
The gathering crowd murmured and stared, and perhaps it was some comfort to think how most of them didn't know him. They were of this city, not the smaller village where he and Dean had lived and worked these past few years.
Castiel hummed thoughtfully. He started to pull his hand away, and Dean made an embarrassingly plaintive noise in protest. Castiel chuckled, patting Dean's cheek. “I suppose you really do like my hands.”
Sam snickered. “This I know.” Dean elbowed him for that and Sam said, “Okay, but what did you say?”
Sam gaped at Dean for a moment. “And he...didn't say yes.”
“Yeah,” Dean said flatly. “They disowned him. Essentially.”
That was...a fair point. Probably. Dean made an unhappy face. Even Adam had managed to get someone to say yes to his proposal. Both of Dean's brothers were officially better at life than he was. It was kind of depressing. Okay, it was a lot depressing.
Dean waived a hand. “He told me tonight that he could never stop loving me, that he could never have abandoned me. That's what
just got engaged.” He rubbed his hand over his mouth. “He's ten years younger than I am. I guess I'm starting to feel like the immature brother, getting left behind while everyone else grows up.”
As they merged onto the freeway, Castiel spoke up again, “So...is there a chance some of them might be...accepting, supportive?”
Dean cleared his throat. “Sam might. Jess too, I dunno.”
“But Dean,” Castiel said, “are you saying you feel attraction towards men?”
Dean laughed, pointing at Sam with his fork again. “Now
Dean stared at John, blood pounding in his ears. Finally, he just said, “Cas and I are engaged.” After a beat he clarified just to be sure, “To each other.”
Dean pulled back, blinking and shaking his head in an attempt to get his face to feel normal again. “Okay.” After a moment of feeling like the world was still spinning off kilter, he asked, “So you'll...come to the wedding and everything?”
“I'm just
“So Adam, you're still in school?” Jess asked.
“Healer Castiel,” Edlund's voice cut through Castiel's thoughts, and her tone suggested perhaps this was not the first time she'd tried.
“You probably can't see me in the dark,” Dean tells Sam, “but I'm flipping you off right now.”
Dean's features twisted with incredulity. “Yeah? So what. Is that bad or something?” Sam grimaced like he was about to give Dean some obnoxious lecture about correct modern terminology. “Katy Perry says it in the song,” Dean pointed out. “And she's bi.”
Dean managed to avoid visibly wincing. The thing was, he didn't feel very confident around Cas. Not when it came to this, anyway. Wrinkling his nose at Sam, Dean said, “I'm sure you know all about how to get the guys, Sammy.”
He probably should have texted or called.
Keeping one hand firmly gripping Dean's arm, Castiel stepped a little away from him to face Crowley. “What does he owe you?”
After a pause, Wesson said, “Given enough time, Dean's injuries should heal to the point where it would be safe for him to come to you.” Castiel nodded. In truth that time had likely already come. Maybe it was a testament to Dean's wisdom that he had stayed away thus far. “Would he...? Do you think, were I to administer it,” Wesson asked carefully, “he could pass a Water Test?”
“Since when do you get to be the expert on proposals?” Dean grumbled.
Everyone echoed the “amen” quietly as they released each other's hands and raised their heads once again.
Dean twisted his lips a bit. “I think four seems like a good number. Two at least, but four if I can make that work.” He gestured about with his beer bottle. “I could fit four kids into this place so long as Adam's fully moved out: two to a room. That's pretty reasonable.”
“That may be true,” Castiel said, smiling in soft amusement. He patted Dean's cheek, eyes fond. “But I think maybe...” He pressed his lips together and looked away, then looked back. “They say anticipation is half the fun. I think perhaps we'll both enjoy it more if we take our time.”
“Oh, I can imagine it quite vividly,” Sam replies with a grin in his voice.
“Not it,” Dean comments, “but one of us could technically sleep out on the porch.”
,” Dean shot back. “Which means he's already got a degree and is officially smarter than you.”
“I, uh, I could go get them right now,” Dean offered. “I've got—um, do you have a preference for the colour? They're not all pink. One's purple. And I've got black as well. Or we could just both go to my place, since Adam's not home this weekend, so...um.”
“Yeah, no offence, but...” Dean says, considering the bed once again then looking back at Sam and then Benny, “there wouldn't even be room for Kevin on here with one of you.”
“Well, I approve,” Dean said. “Less formal sounds good to me.”
“Give me a date and I'll make sure I keep it free,” John replied, giving Dean's bicep a squeeze.
“During the battle with the Shade,” Edlund countered, “this Creature when injured took a demonic form—many witnesses, in fact all present, have reported seeing curved horns in the place of branching antlers and leathery wings replace the transparent 'insect-like' ones upon his back.” She pinned Castiel with a sharp look. “You were present for the battle, Healer Castiel. Surely you must have seen the same.”
Benny laughs. “That's fair.” He takes a swig and makes a face at the flask. “It's not the best whisky.”
“I suppose it...did.”
“We weren't really going that formal,” Jess put in.
That mutual coming out debacle had been a real mess and they'd both said stupid shit they'd had to take back, but Castiel had stayed that night anyway. It turned out Dean didn't need to offer sex to get Castiel to hold him, and thankfully Castiel loved Dean enough to forgive him for joining the long list of men who'd learned he was gay and immediately tried to get into his pants. It had been months and it still blew Dean's mind: despite everything, Castiel loved Dean so much that he was willing to try to make things work.
Dean laughed softly. “Yeah, um...should be fun.” Finally tugging off his jeans, he tossed them over the back of the chair he used for hanging clothing he was going to re-wear. Cas had insisted early on that leaving clothing on the floor was unacceptable and Dean had to admit Cas had a point. Picking up his pyjama pants from the chair, Dean stared down at the material twisted in his hands. “Why...why do I still feel like this?”
and them still thinking we're doing it anyway.”
“We could always stack people,” Dean jokes.
“Well, I guess...” Castiel sighed. He pressed his lips together. “I suppose maybe...it's easier for me in some ways, because it's simpler; my parents cut off contact.” He shrugged his shoulders. “I didn't even get a choice in that. With your dad...he loves you and accepts you. You can't hate him.”
With a frustrated breath and a disgusted roll of his eyes, Dean pushed himself up and walked—a little unsteadily, admittedly—to the window. He put both hands on the sill and looked out over his darkened back yard. “You think I've never thought about any of this while sober, Cas? Just because I don't say something out loud doesn't mean I wasn't thinking about it. And anyway,” he blurted, “if you need more gay cred to believe me, I dated a couple of guys in college.”
Edlund turned to look at the three people seated at a table to her right whom she had previously introduced as Scholar Sam Wesson, Seer Missouri Moseley, and Seer Kevin Tran. “Scholar Sam, is it indeed a crime?”
“Would you mind so much if I was?”
“It's just...” John rubbed at his forehead and grimaced. Looking away, he sighed. “I heard something a while back, that he'd had a...falling out....with his family.”
to me, for things to go back to the way they were. Things were
Dean grinned, finally feeling at least a little relieved. “Sure, um, if you want. What're you making?”
Smiling fondly, Castiel stroked his hand through Dean's hair again and up over the glossy curve of one horn. “There's my sweet boy.” Dean looked up at him through his lashes and sucked harder, making a helpless sound. His wings gave another little snap. “Shh, shh.” Castiel stroked Dean's cheek. “It's all right. I'm here.”
Dean can imagine a lot of ways he'd rather be sleeping. A nice big bed, clean sheets. Actual comfortable pj's instead his jeans. A convenient thermostat keeping the room at a constant pleasant temperature.
“Yeah, but you're more on the other end of that spectrum,” Dean said.
Dean chuckled, dropping his gaze. “Maybe you're stuck with me.”
“You're not going to lose me again,” Castiel promised, placing his hand over Dean's heart. “I want to be angry at your father,” Castiel added after a pause. “And for what he said to you all those years ago and for only taking it back tonight, I am.”
After a beat or two, Dean asks, “Warm enough?” They have a couple blankets but the cabin is still drafty as all hell. “Because we could switch places so you're closer to the fire.”
“Yeah,” Dean replied with a nod. “I mean, I can see a level of appeal there.” A bit of a grimace flickered across his lips and he cleared his throat. “My first time...wasn't exactly planned. At all.” He shifted his grip on the steering wheel. “There were...probably a lot of good reasons why we should have talked things through ahead of time, but you know.” He twitched his shoulders in a small shrug. “We didn't.”
“S'okay, Cas,” Dean murmurs. “Pretty sure it's still the middle of the night.”
Raising his brows, Castiel reached for his beer and took a swallow of it as well. “We have just now, in case you've forgotten, established that I myself am technically bi.”
“No, because then I'd have to cuddle with Sam,” Dean shoots back, even though the main reason is that he's just too damn
“Any Creature corrupted enough to accurately be called a 'demon',” Wesson countered, “could not tolerate any contact with Blessed Water.”
“Oh cool.” Sam smiled. “I know you two used to talk about getting a place together.”
Dean scrunched up his nose at that. “What, they want you to pick one or the other?”
Dean nodded, remembering. “How's Jess doing, anyway?”
Dean's hooves scuffled a bit against the stone floor as he shifted to sitting cross-legged at Castiel's feet. “Do you mind? Being stuck with me.”
Dean scrunched up his face, moving finally to pull on his pyjama pants. “That he'd disown me if I ever had a gay boyfriend, or whatever. But he didn't even remember saying it, and obviously he didn't really
“You realize,” Castiel said, one corner of his lips curling upwards, “that having children would be considerably easier with a female partner.”
“Anyway,” John said, clearing his throat with emphasis. He made a vague circular gesture around the table. “We're supposed to say congratulations.”
“Since I actually got married to the person I proposed to,” Sam answered with a laugh.
“Will you
Castiel chuckled. “They have many different styles. Perhaps we could pick one out together.”
“Okay, well, do this as a favour to yourself,” Sam said, putting his hand over Dean's heart for a moment, “and a favour to him.” He waved his hand in a circular, encompassing gesture. “And as a favour to everyone else too.”
“Yeah.” Dean blinked, staring down at the carpet. “I mean, just look at my dad, right? He...changed his mind.”
“I was thinking of maybe a pink suit,” Castiel commented.
“So who's volunteering to cuddle?” Sam asks. “I think both Benny and I already called not it.”
Castiel shook his head. “He's always tolerated it without any complaint or physical sign of distress or lingering symptoms.”
Dean twisted his lips. “Yep. I mean, I knew it was a bad idea...but I did it anyway because...I dunno.” He twitched his shoulders in a shrug. “It didn't seem to matter. What do I even have left to give the person I marry?”
“As you do,” Sam commented, hefting his own beer bottle.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Gee, thanks.”
“I suppose that's....finally panned out,” Dean commented, managing not to shift awkwardly in his seat.
“Dean might not be as tall as some of us,” Benny comments, “but he's pretty solidly-built; he might just crush poor Cas.”
“He is engaged now,” Sam pointed out.
Castiel grimaced. “Dean was always recovering, gradually but steadily. There were no major new injuries, but he'd never fully recovered from the injures he had when I first found him.” It had been a while, but, “It takes a lot to bring a Creature such as him to the brink of death; his injuries were deep and profound.”
Crowley flashed Castiel a grin. “No; he's yours. But you do have a point and I should get out of your way. I've had Meg and Ruby ready the baths for you. Dean can show you the way. It's not far.”
Castiel's grin turned rueful, and he looked away a bit, ducking his head. “Dean, I—I've been in love with you for...a very long time. I just...never thought I'd have a chance. I assumed you weren't...interested. Not that way.”
One side of Castiel's lips flickered upwards. “I don't suppose you've had any Blessed Water?”
about this—this whole Adam thing. It's all easy for you, I guess, to just go 'change' your mind on a whim, 'correct' your 'unreasonable' opinion when suddenly that suits you. But you
“I'm a bit rusty myself,” Castiel admitted. “So if you don't judge me for that...”
John raised his brows and rubbed at his stubble with one hand. “Sure could have fooled everyone at that table.”
“Well.” Edlund folded her hands on the dark wood surface before her. “If we determine that your familiar Creature was in fact malevolent, all magics you performed with his aid will be rendered unlawful.” She considered Castiel for a moment. “You do admit that you had a Creature known as Dean Smith in your employ?”
.” Reaching over, he patted Castiel's knee. “The next time we see Kevin you can out-number-crunch him while I go take a nap.”
“Yeah, of course.”
not going to happen.” He wrinkled his nose. “Though I suppose I'm also not entirely sure what that would be, exactly. Probably Sam
“Thankfully Sam's still the same overgrown height,” Dean teased, smirking a bit as he poked at his green beans. “If he got any taller he wouldn't fit through the doors.”
“What? No.” Dean shot Sam a confused look. “What could you even do?”
Castiel opened his mouth and his gaze moved upwards to look upon what he could see of the starry sky. Finally he admitted, “I...don't know. It's certainly...possible.”
Castiel nodded. “I do. In all the time I've known him, Dean never once behaved in a manner I could describe as 'malevolent', and as a magic is only unlawful if it by design or accident harms another person or their property, I maintain that I have not performed unlawful magic.”
“Maybe you want...to be allowed to hate him,” Castiel suggested. “To feel like it would be justified.” He grimaced, shaking his head. “I mean, I don't hate my family. And to be quite honest I wouldn't want to either. But I think maybe it's easier for me, simpler, knowing I'd be fully justified if I did.”
“Really?” Adam looked up at that with interest. “That sounds sufficiently gay.”
“He...” Castiel grimaced at the memory of Dean's bloodied form trembling on the ground. “His eyes were open and he seemed to see me.” Castiel winced. “He—flinched, as I approached him.” The memory of Balthazar warning, 'There's no going back from this, Cassie,' swam vivid within Castiel's mind. Grimacing again, Castiel swallowed. “I cut my finger and offered it to him, speaking gently, letting him know I wouldn't hurt him.”
“Yeah, as a friend,” Dean countered. “A fully platonic guy friend who happens to be gay and likes to cuddle sometimes, because apparently that's totally normal and healthy.” The remaining beer in Dean's bottle sloshed as he gestured with it. “He made it very clear that he doesn't want to marry me and have a bunch of kids together.”
Benny chuckles and says, “Not quite how either of you two imagined ending up in bed together, huh?”
With a soft whimper, Dean laid his head against Castiel's thigh, gently sucking at Castiel's finger. One of his hands caught Castiel's ankle, just holding on.
to fit in the spot of floor Kevin's using. “The only reason you don't have to right now is that you're tiny.”
Castiel shook his head. This was necessary and nothing for which Dean needed to apologize. “Just relax, all right?” Castiel ran the fingers of his other hand though Dean's hair. “You don't have to look a certain way,” Castiel said. “It's just you and me.”
Castiel scrunched up his face. “But why me?”
Castiel's features broke into a soft grin and he met Dean's eyes under his mop of messy dark hair. “Something like that, I guess.”
“Congratulations,” Castiel said, offering both of them a warm smile. “I'm very happy for you.”
Dean shoulders past him because Dean is cold and the way his shirt is sticking to his skin feels awful.
Castiel reached out hesitantly and took Dean's hand in his own. Dean's heart hammered painfully in his chest and he might have forgotten to breathe. Castiel laced their fingers together and raised his gaze to meet Dean's. “Like this?”
Dean raised his brows. “You're not gonna make me wait until our wedding night are you? Because we haven't even set a date yet.”
John jerked his chin towards the house. “The way you ran out of there, sure seemed like you were scared of your skinny little brother.”
“Is the running joke of this whole night going to be that I'm small?” Kevin asks.
Castiel stared at Dean in wonder. “You find me attractive.”
“Maybe I'll get you one,” Castiel suggested.
Castiel twisted his brows and tilted his head to one side. “Clothing preferences have nothing to do with sexual orientation.”
“I don't think you'll get rejected,” Sam argued. After a beat, he added, “And even if you do, at least then you know it wasn't just 'cause you were drunk off your ass.”
“I'm sorry,” Dean said, grabbing Castiel's hand in a quick grip and pressing his lips to the knuckles. “I'm...so sorry you had to go through that. Once. Already.” Soothing his thumb over the back of Castiel's hand, Dean took a breath and added, “Look, we can back out now. We don't even have to go tonight.” John might deserve that for all the plans he'd cancelled early on when Dean still bothered to try to make them. But this wasn't just John; Sam and Jess and even Adam were all supposed to be there. A proper 'family dinner' and it wasn't even Thanksgiving. “Or we can decide here and now we're not going to tell them, that you and I are 'just friends', keep the physical affection low-key and platonic-like—”
“Well.” Dean cleared his throat. “For the record, it feels pretty good. In the moment, anyway. Not that I'm—that I'm trying to sway you in that direction or anything.”
family.”
“So, uh,” Sam said, turning to smile at Dean in the setting sun, “not that I'm complaining, 'cause I'm not—it's nice to hang out just you and me like this. We don't hang out enough anymore.”
Grimacing, Adam shrugged and pushed his food around his plate with his fork. “I don't really know. Only been at my new school for a couple of days.”
“I don't know, Cas.” Dean spread his hands in helplessness. “Is it rude that you've been more than halfways ghosting me? After you agreed that we'd forget that stupid conversation even happened?”
“You still had your heart,” Castiel suggested. “The rest of your life. Speaking as the person you're planning on marrying...those are...pretty important. To me.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “Well, apparently I'm really stupid when I'm drunk.”
Dean rolled his eyes and tightened his arms across his chest again. “I'm pretty sure I already know 'his side', Sam: he had a whole list of objections that he was happy to share.”
Castiel worried his lower lip a bit in thought as he let his thumb slide along the curve of one of Dean's horns. “Do you ever—?”
“Oh, right.” Dean was an idiot, because the Sam and Jess thing had barely even begun when Castiel did his disappearing act so they probably hadn't actually had a chance to meet. “Jess, this is Cas,” he tried, motioning a bit awkwardly between the two of them, “Cas, this is Jess.”
“You're my
Castiel nodded again. “I do.”
Dean smirked a bit, ducking his head. “Yeah, well,” he countered, “you gotta admit it would simplify things.”
Wincing internally, Castiel chose not to comment on that particular idea and simply said, “I'm not trying to force anything.”
“Speaking as someone who still hasn't broken the pledge...” Castiel shrugged. “I agree. Completely. I never really thought about it like that, but that was pretty manipulative, the way they did that. Especially how it was public, the peer-pressure aspect.”
Castiel shifted slightly where he stood, clasping his hands behind his back. The material of his robe itched just a bit around his neck but he ignored it. The smells of dust and too many people irritated his nose but he ignored that too. “Dean was injured when I found him.” Castiel winced slightly as the memory washed over him. The copper flash of Anna's hair in the unnatural light, the dull clatter as the broken pieces of the collar tumbled to the ground, the smell of blood and sulphur in the too-hot air, Balthazar's grimace as he turned from Dean's crumpled form and suggested the merciful thing would be to end his suffering swiftly. “Dying, in fact.”
It was unlikely enough to seem impossible, but Castiel merely nodded.
Dean winced and Sam shot him a worried frown. Dean groaned and only just suppressed the urge to hide his face. “I...think I may have fucked things up really badly.”
“So he was,” Wesson added, “typically affectionate?”
“The child appears to be recovering,” Moseley assured him.
Castiel's features softened into a smile. “I'm not sure I could fully restrain myself from jumping you in the shower.”
Wesson's brows drew together. “Had he not eaten recently?”
Castiel shifts against Dean's chest, making a sleepy questioning sound.
“Yup.” Rolling his eyes a bit, Dean said, “Mine was blue.” The image sprang forth vivid in his mind: the not quite smooth curve where someone had cut it out with scissors, the scrawl of Dean's name in Crayola marker. Like some sort of elementary school art project, basically. He worried the inside of his lip a bit. “I—speaking as someone who broke the pledge, I think maybe it would have been more helpful if instead of asking us to pledge to 'wait until marriage' they'd asked us to pledge to think things through before just jumping into bed with someone. Because...once it didn't work out with Lisa, I kind of figured...well, what's the point anymore? I already broke the stupid pledge. Virginity's gone.”
“Am I preventing that?” Castiel asks, voice edged with a worried frown.
“You're blushing,” Castiel pointed out.
“Uh...yeah.” Dean chuckled awkwardly, cheeks far too warm to be comfortable. “That's...a boner.” No point in trying to hide it or talk his way out of this one. He was marrying a man: the point of trying not to 'look gay' was long past. His grin slid into something a bit crooked. Was this something he was supposed to apologize for? He didn't particularly feel ashamed. He felt...amused, and maybe a little smug. “Pressing right into your thigh.”
With a quiet sigh, Castiel cast his gaze heavenwards as though for help. “You're the one who brought it up.”
Castiel nodded. “Would you...” He pushed the door a bit further open. “...like to come in? I was about to make lunch. I can make enough for the two of us.”
Shooting Sam a glare, Dean sits up. “One thing I don't need is cuddling advice from my baby brother.”
“You said Cas thinks you're not gay enough for him,” Sam prompted.
Castiel tugs Dean tighter against his chest. The breath from his soft laugh teases at Dean's hair. “We'll have to try it that way sometime.”
Castiel turned away quickly and moved towards the living room. “Can we please not do this, Dean? I've had...a rough week.”
“Wow, gross,” Sam commented, looking like he'd just stepped in something vile. “I did
Benny smirks. “Sounds like a dream come true, Dean.”
“I'm not sure Cas would agree with you,” Sam commented.
Dean swallows roughly, squeezing his eyes shut. “I swear to God, Cas.”
It was just shortly after eleven thirty when Dean rapped on Castiel's door. The front door had a bell, but it had been years since Dean had come to Castiel's front door. The side door was just more convenient, and this way Castiel would know it was him. Dean could have texted or called first, but...
Chuckling, Dean replied, “Now, anyway.”
“You had a couple folding chairs in the trunk last time,” Sam said, shaking his floppy hair out of his face. “Jess came, and she sat in one of them.”
“You didn't really look fine,” Castiel countered as he pulled away and started unbuttoning his shirt.
“I just mean you shouldn't have to,” Castiel insisted. “It should always be your choice.” He winced slightly. “Anyway, I'm so sorry I'm still making you wait.”
Twisting his brows, Adam said, “I guess that makes sense, then.”
“Never,” Castiel replied truthfully.
“And any one of them could wake up at any moment,” Dean counters. He lets out a frustrated breath and adds, “Look, Cas, I think I'd like very much one day to kiss you in front of all of them.” An image of himself and Castiel in nice suits with flowers on their lapels standing at the front of a church springs immediately to mind, and Dean blushes so deep his head spins. “But, uh, can the first time be private?”
“I have an associate degree in accounting,” Castiel commented.
Castiel laughed softly, leaning in to kiss Dean. “I love you,” he whispered against Dean's lips. “And you really are an idiot. At least when you're drunk.”
“Could we both wear engagement rings?” Dean asked. “Is that a...thing?”
Frowning slightly, Castiel flicked the screen back off and slid the phone into his pocket. “Is it creepy that you remembered that in such detail?”
“I don't...really want you to be angry at him,” Dean admitted. Grimacing, he shook his head. “
“It is,” Castiel confirmed.
“Before.”
It stung, of course. And it was in fact a little different letting Dean be the one to puncture Castiel's skin. Dean murmured, “Sorry.”
Castiel raised his brows. “I have no doubt he would fail spectacularly.”
Dean shrugged, looking away. “There was a spell—in one of your books—for contacting another magic user. I think I actually did very badly at it, but he was...waiting for me.”
“Well, I don't know.” Sam shrugged. “They are probably his most striking feature, but just pick whatever you personally like. His hair. I dunno. His abs.”
The wooden legs of Dean's chair scraped roughly against the floor as he stood, the ringing in his ears almost drowning out Sam saying, “Dean!” as Dean flung open the door and stalked outside, slamming the door behind him.
“Oh, Dean,” Castiel said. “Hello.”
Dean blinked up at him. “Do I ever what?”
“It's been a while,” Sam commented, clearing his throat. “It's nice to see you, Adam. You're looking well.”
Dean sighed, resting both hands on the wheel. “I can't imagine it could go
At least, it started out that way. They'd never quite made it all the way to the couch, and in the time it took Castiel to shove Dean up against the wall, Dean's entire body was alight. Dean groaned helplessly. Somehow being pinned and trapped felt
“All right, well...” Castiel grimaced slightly and shrugged his shoulders. “You were drunk and said a bunch of stuff you didn't mean, and I'm mature enough to accept that.”
Castiel's lips twisted unhappily. “Right.” Frowning, he pressed his lips together as he buckled himself in. “So just...be prepared for...the worst.”
Chuckling again in apparent disbelief, Castiel shook his head and leaned forward to set his not quite empty beer bottle on the coffee table with a hollow sort of thunk. “But why would you want to get married?”
“He brought Kinsey up first,” Dean argued weakly.
Before Castiel managed any response other than widened eyes, Dean wrapped his wings tighter around Castiel and everything winked out.
Castiel pressed his lips together, eyes somehow managing to look confusingly sad and hopeful at the same time. “You're thinking about kids?”
Castiel glanced at the wall clock and then frowned and pulled out his phone. “Shit, it really is late.”
“We'd sleep if the two of you would quiet down,” Benny drawls.
The sun shone pale and bright in Castiel's tired eyes, and the air was cool against his face and hands as he tried to keep them from shaking.
“Dean,” Castiel said with a touch of an indulgent smile, “you're drunk right now, and—”
“Thank you.” Smiling, Sam took Jess' hand in his on the tabletop. “Best decision I ever made.”
“And you're sure you can...” Kevin asks, looking the bed over dubiously, “both fit?”
Frowning slightly, Dean glanced sideways at Castiel before turning his eyes back to the road. “Is that—is that why you never—?”
Dean dropped his gaze, setting his phone aside on the nightstand. “I'm fine, Cas.”
Edlund's clear voice was reading out Castiel's conviction, but he couldn't make himself follow the words. He'd heard it before, anyway. He knew why he was here: he'd shown more compassion than he ought to and by doing so he'd put many people in some vague danger. He couldn't quite feel like that was wrong. Maybe sometimes a person's conscience demanded they save the one and let the hundreds sort themselves out. And if a law defined 'malevolence' on appearance and the ability to tolerate a certain type of magic water, then the law was wrong.
A smirk twisted Crowley's lips. “I haven't decided yet.” He turned to face Castiel more fully. “Ah, but where are my manners? You must think me a terrible host. Come, have a seat.” He gestured to a bed against the nearby wall. “You must be exhausted from your ordeal. I've had my own familiars prepare this room for you and Dean—I trust it's to your liking, but if there's anything we can do to make you more comfortable, don't hesitate to ask. And as I'm sure you're in need of some refreshment, I'll just go fetch that.”
