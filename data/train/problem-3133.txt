Cas squinted at him. Dean was pretty sure angels didn't need glasses, but he was considering taking Cas to get his eyes checked, just in case Jimmy had a prescription Cas was stuck with even after he had been rebuilt with an empty vessel. "How does one know if they find another attractive?"
Sometime after Sam had given them the rundown (some sort of curse on the local movie theater, which used to be the house of some long-dead rich asshole who had a lot of asshole guests who died with the same manner and frequency of the movie-goers), in the midst of laying out their plan for the night (sneak in, find the focus for the curse, destroy it), Dean noticed Cas's focus starting to flick away to something at the bar behind him every so often. Dean glanced over his shoulder, wondering if some hot girl had finally caught his eye, or if Cas's attention span was just shortening the longer he spent on earth, and saw the guy. Dean immediately swiveled back to look at Sammy. Cas was getting distracted by that guy? It
His hand fell to Cas's waist, holding him in place, tugging his hips ever closer to his own until Cas's crotch slid against Dean's thigh enough for him to realize that Cas was hard too. Suddenly it wasn't enough, getting more than he had ever gotten from the angel, Dean needed more, tugging Cas's dress shirt out of his belt and getting his hands on the warm waist of Cas, the slight curve of his hips, the touch of his skin shooting lightning up his arm, Cas's response of a too-hard bite to Dean's neck the thunder crackling after.
"Cas, I don't need you because of some angel mojo, or because you can hop 'round the globe in a second, we can get by without that. I need you 'cause you're
Cas ran. Ran for the garden Dean had headed towards, ran until he saw the body and fell to his knees. Dean was dead. Gone. Would there even be a heaven for him without the angels? The rest of them, Chuck and the others were doomed. Dean was gone, there was no backup plan. All they could do was wait for the Croats to get to them.
how to ask a celestial entity in the body of a radio ad salesman if he might like to take it up the ass (or stick it up someone's ass?).
Then there was a waitress who told Dean her shift ended at 10, who had looked up at him as her lips closed around the tip of his dick and made him think
it wasn't the aftereffects of the drugs making him think that Dean was kissing him back. If Cas could fix Dean by tearing himself apart with this kiss, he would have. And even though he knew he couldn't, he tried; tried until his eyes began to fill with salt water and his mind began to fill with the broken pieces of Dean. But they were all sucked back into him the instant Risa called outside of the cabin for Dean. His jaw tightened as he pulled away from Cas. Observing him with some unknown look that Cas wanted so badly to be desire in his eye before his expression hardened and he jerked his head for Cas to come.
Instead, Dean found his way into the bed of a woman staying in the motel room next to theirs, and when he heard her first moan, elicited by a kiss at the base of her neck, his first thought was
And Dean could always pull Cas where he wanted him, could drag him under his arm after their failed brothel visit, could turn him around to look at whatever needed looking at, could push him to movement if he was lingering too long staring in his Cas way, but it had never really sunk in how much he really
?" Cas pushed Dean off with his last word, all of his self-hatred coming back swinging, held back too long by a fuzzy haze of drugs.
There is a beat of silence, in which Dean realizes that the alleyway is, in fact, visible from the street and he should probably get his dick back inside his pants. He is saved from wondering if it would be polite to do that same for Cas by realizing that Cas had mojo-ed himself back to decent while Dean was distracted.
It's Cas who seals the deal, Cas who takes Dean's too-long stare and turns it into action with a wry smile. "Would you like to, I believe the correct saying is 'Get some air?'" And Dean had taught him better than using air quotes a long time ago, but that didn't stop them from coming through in his voice, teasing, laden with the knowledge that
When they had gotten back to camp, Cas found a silent, empty little place behind a cabin and rolled his sleeve up to inspect the wound. It was a jagged cut, and flowing from it was more blood than had ever so much as touched him. It stung. It burned; it seared its presence onto his memory forever.
Wonder and shock and awe and a million other confused feelings flitted through his mind in an instant. He barely registered the conversation with Dean, but 2009 and Zachariah were the only things he really needed to know. So it shouldn't have been a surprise when Dean asked for him to "strap on his angel wings" because, to Dean, he still had them, he was still
Now they were in yet another bar in yet another town and Cas kept glancing over at some guy playing pool instead of listening to Dean recount the tale of the bloody Mary case way back when while Sam half-successfully flirted with some girl. Dean wouldn't be so bothered by it if Cas had decent taste in men, but this guy--like the others--set off his douchedar. He didn't even know how to hustle properly, was playing strangers but was too cocky about it, his self-satisfied smirk every time he made a shot keeping bets low and casual.
Dean would say he had forgotten what Sammy looked like, but that would be a lie. His brother was in an impossibly white suit and wearing a smile that was so
So when the past Dean was angry at his future self for torturing again, Cas laughed, a small vindication after all these years. The Dean of now glared at him.
That, he thought with a spark of satisfaction, brought Cas's attention fully back to Dean. Then Cas, just like the last time, took a measuring scan of the room, his gaze resting on the pool-playing man for a hair longer than the rest, before turning back to him. "There aren't any women here I find to be attractive. To me. Is there anyone you are interested in seeing more of? I assume in more than just the one implication of the phrase."
Dean didn't know what to say to help. He understood--he thought, he had started kissing girls when kissing was all he had to figure out, had never kissed anyone he wasn't attracted to, never had to catch up to what was supposed to feel right. He didn't know what to say to help, but wanted to help, wanted to do something to make Cas feel better, to make his eyes to leave the spot on the wall they had been glued to for the past 10 minutes. He would later blame that for what he said next. "I could help with that."
A bolt of arousal shot through him, spine to dick to knees on the craggy ground, wondering how he must look, hands in his hair and dick in his mouth, hand moving furiously over his cock. He hadn't even checked if the alleyway was visible from the street, hadn't checked to see if anyone walking by could see him so turned on by Cas's dick so, so hard in his mouth he couldn't stand not touching himself. The thought of someone walking by, of
to countless girls at countless bars in countless towns over the years. He wasn't out of practice, but suddenly it seemed momentous to ask. Anyone else, everyone else, it hadn't mattered. He would find the next girl, maybe in the next bar in the next town, maybe in the same one. But even with Cas looking at him like that, even with Cas saying earlier that day he was down, the prospect pumped Dean full of the same adrenaline he felt swinging a machete towards a vamp's neck, or saying the last words of an exorcism.
"Well, maybe next time." Dean smiled, more genuinely this time, his insides settling back in their usual places as Cas prompted him to continue his story about bloody Mary.
"What? Is that was you think?" Dean asked, his voice scraping over the words in the incredulous tone that was so
Cas's head lolled back against the wall as he gave Dean a bitter smile and laughed again. "You need me? Oh, that's just great. I can't fly, I can't heal, I can hardly even remember the Ennochian for my own name, why would you need
The next two months Cas spent as he had spent his time before, except with more drugs and somehow, more sex. Dean visited at first, if only to check up on his foot, until Aaron started to come by often, growing bolder in his visits as time progressed.
Dean may have been losing it a little himself, because he tensed his fingers together and tugged on an angel of the lord's hair. And Cas made a
, hurt like a million things he had never thought he would experience -- was, to him, the first marker of his true fall.
The next time they were alone, it was waiting for Sammy to finish talking to a potential witness who may have seen Dean breaking into the house of one of the vics. Cas was sitting next to Dean in the impala, breaking their silence by asking, easy as anything, "Dean, would you be amenable to kissing again?"
He was achingly hard, trying to angle his hips just enough that it wouldn't be terribly noticeable against Cas's thigh. He wasn't exactly sure of the etiquette, exactly what roads Cas was interested in going down in his "exploration of physical intimacy." He needed more though, needed Cas closer despite him being pressed against Dean as much as he could be already. So he slipped a hand under Cas's ill-fitting trench coat, under his suit jacket to grasp at his waist through his shirt, feeling the give of human softness, knowing how much power lay beneath it. Cas moaned--actually moaned, no gasp, no little turned on noise--dirty, debauched,
He entered his cabin, the one of only ones with a proper bed, and gathered everything he had. 27 different pills washed down with tequila and rum ought to do it, right?
"What? I like past you." Cas snarked at Dean. Past Dean, the one Cas had fallen for -- in every sense of the word.
His brain started racing for a way to backtrack in the next split second: creating and running a dating profile for Cas, filtering out anyone judgy or pressure-y, talking it out, conveniently timed interruptions to any hookups so things didn't go to far too fast--but then Cas's eyes were on Dean, closer than he had expected when he had sat down, the unblinking focus Dean never quite got used to again trained on him at full force. And Dean's brain cut out again, every neuron relaxing as Castiel finally looked at him again. And he doubled down. "Y'know, like, practice. Work up to it. I can't judge you because I don't know jack shit about kissing dudes, so no pressure."
And with the pill coating his mind with a syrupy-sweet layer of fog, he forgot that Dean didn't need him anymore, that Dean thought-- Dean
It turns out the monster they're hunting will crawl back into its burrow (underneath the house of the first victim) around dawn, so after one drink at the local dive, Sam turned in early. It's just Dean and Cas and Dean trying to teach Cas how to play pool. Cas couldn't get the grip quite right, instinctively holding the cue like a weapon, and once Dean touched his off hand to get his fingers into place he couldn't stop touching, a hand on the hip, then the back adjusting his stance, a gentle hand around Cas's hand guiding the cue, a slap on the back after a good shot, brushing his hand against Cas's thigh as they traded places around the table. By the end of a few games Cas is wiping the floor with him and Dean has fewer excuses to touch and it's driving him up the wall a little.
It made him remember how once, in the very beginnings of the world, when winds had yet to begin blowing across the world; trees would grow and grow, with no troubles placed upon them. No air to push and push until they reached their breaking point, just water and sun and life. But the instant the winds were released, the moment the first light breeze began to rustle through their branches, the tall, tall trees collapsed under their own weight, their lost invincibility crushing them faster than any storm could have.
So Cas was the best he could be for Dean. He followed all of his orders, did his best to keep the Croatoan virus contained, flew around the world to find any supplies left to hoard when Dean asked, any survivors to help them fight -- and Dean was holding it together, Cas thought. He still drank, he still fucked half the women at camp, but he didn't spiral down into hopelessness, didn't put a bullet in his head and leave the survivors with a half used-up angel and an anxious prophet to lead the rest of the refugees. So Cas accepted it for what it was, and carried on. But then the rest of the angels left.
but he had gasped because Dean put his hand in his head. He had never felt more powerful in his life, but Cas was still kissing Dean in the same measured way, still just practicing, treading the making out waters, and Dean wanted him to lose it even more, wanted him to moan and bite and get wet and sloppy, wanted to hear that gravel-road voice say his name.
Dean wished Cas's angel powers let him be in three places at once, let him be kissing Dean while Dean sucked him off while Dean ground his hips against Cas's thigh. Instead, Cas did the next best thing, something Dean wouldn't have thought him to do in a million years, not on his last night on earth, not in this dirty alleyway next to a bar on an April Tuesday. Cas, between gasps and moans and little jerks of his hips, said, "I want you to touch yourself," his voice even more fucked up than normal, rattling under Dean's skin. And pushing his hips against Cas's leg like a horny teenager might not have been enough to get him off, but his voice, the voice that had told him he was saved, that he was worthy of saving, again, and again, and again, might be enough to do it.
reason they must have thought. He wondered for a split second if Cas's hair was that soft because of something Jimmy Novak had done, genetically or shampoo-wise, or if that had been angelic intervention, before deciding that it was not worth giving up Cas's mouth against his to hear the answer. Instead, he tugged on his hair just as he had tugged on it in the car, and Cas made the same turned-on noise except it was better because Dean could feel the rumble of it against his own chest, could pull Cas closer against his body, make him press Dean even harder into the rough brick behind him.
Later, when the camp knew what had happened to Cas, they didn't talk about it. They quieted when they passed him in Dean's clothes, just a bit too big for him. Cas wanted to fly away, off to the Andromeda galaxy, to explore Orion's belt until he could forget the accusations on their faces, the disappointment. But he couldn't do that anymore could he? He couldn't even ease his own mind. He didn't even know how to be human, how could he possibly help run the camp?
Dean decided against telling Cas that bars usually stayed open a lot later in cities than they did in small towns and they could probably still get a couple hours in before last call. "Oh, they're always playing them this time of night. Try channel 8, I'll catch you up."
. In that moment, 5 years' worth of inadequacy and pain came roaring back into his head in a millisecond. If he hadn't been stoned to all hell already, he probably would have fallen to his knees. As it was he just began to giggle, high-pitched and watery-eyed, feeling like someone had shoved shards of glass through the spaces in his ribs, all reaching straight for his heart.
Dean didn't know how to bring it up. How were you supposed ask an angel of the lord if he likes dick? Dean wasn't even sure (he was pretty sure) Cas was checking that guy out. How many times are you supposed to watch your friend maybe check out guys before you brought it up? Or was Cas supposed to bring it up? Would Cas even realize? He had
Risa and the grunts had died quickly and Cas was surrounded by demons and Croats when he heard a gunshot. The first real smile he had cracked in five years crept up onto his face. Dean had done it. But then the demons began to smile too, and the Croats began laughing. They all were gone the next moment. Disappearing into the crevices of the old building, a burnt-out angel not important enough for them to bother killing the only living thing left.
"No, no, I'm not feeling it tonight." Dean brushed him off, figuring that if Cas had figured it out enough to avoid the subject, Dean had waited long enough. "You say no women, anyone else?"
And Dean suddenly felt trapped, not wanting to send Cas over to this guy who didn't even know how to hustle pool, not wanting to seem like he was being weird about it being a dude, wanting Cas to keep his attention firmly on Dean instead of looking away so often. He forced his face into a half smile, the best I'm-not-going-to-be-an-asshole-about-this expression he could give while distracted by the indecision fucking up his stomach. "You gonna go talk to them?"
A week before Cas was off bed rest, Dean came into Cas's cabin. Cas, in his half hung-over, half still high state, barely noticed the clenching of his jaw and the tightness in Dean shoulders when he saw Aaron and Cas tangled together. He had come to bring Aaron on a mission, his first one out. Cas heard the gunshot when they got back, knew Dean had shot an infected Aaron in the head even before Chuck softly knocked on his door to break it to him. Cas barely heard him he was flying so high.
Except the next time Dean had sex--with a petite redhead who had lived across the hall from a dude with a deeply haunted doll about 10 minutes after finishing it off--he thought about it. Dean was normally real proficient on not thinking about his very male friend while fucking women, but the last coherent thought he had before his brain briefly shut down to knock him on his ass with a more-than-passable orgasm was
Instead, a dog barked near them and Dean was brought back into awareness of the fact that they were in a suburban street in the middle of the day waiting for his little brother to come meet them and if he continued on the path he wanted to continue down, wanted to pull Cas down, he would almost certainly get them arrested for public indecency. Which should have been a concerning thought to have about his best friend, but as they pulled apart Cas's gaze lingered on Dean's mouth, distracted in a way Dean had never seen him distracted before and Dean knew that even if they stopped here, he would never stop thinking about this.
time, Sam. At least I don't make out in the back of mini vans with girls with purity rings like a teenager." Which, admittedly, also happened just the one time), but agreed. When they were settled in to their motel, Sam broke off to go to a gym (apparently sitting in the passenger seat for 8 hours and the driver's seat for 7 most days was messing with his fitness). Dean cracked some jokes, but had been counting on his little brother peeling off for the night to do something or other (whether the gym was a cover story for "other," and Sam just was trying to lose Dean for the night to pick up women, Dean didn't need to know until there was a walk of shame he could make fun of). When Sam was gone, he turned to Cas and clapped his hands. "So, I was thinking we could hit some bars? Maybe some more, ah,
When Cas got back to camp, everyone stayed their distance. They could tell something was wrong. Cas hoped they'd give him at least an hour until they wanted questions answered.
Cas cocked his head, seeming to evaluate Dean's reaction for a moment before looking over to the pool guy. Dean's stomach dropped oddly watching Cas openly look instead of stealing furtive glances when Dean looked away. "No." He said eventually. "He is heterosexual."
"It is just another thing that humans happen to do with their bodies for pleasure. It should be no more desirable or anxiety-inducing for me than eating a burger or receiving a hug from you or Sam. I had no issue engaging in such activities with Amanda. And yet I find myself concerned that a man I do not know nor care about would think poorly of me for performance. I am a soldier thousands of years old in the body of a 34-year-old man; I should be capable of engaging physically with another man, especially when I was able to do so with a woman."
Dean knew a hell of a lot about Cas, but he didn't know how much silent staring Cas could be on the receiving end of before he lost his own nerve, so still caught in the middle of his own thoughts, he forced out a "Yeah, yeah that would be good."
When he woke up the next morning naked beside her, he couldn't remember how her limbs had gotten wrapped up in his, though he had a vague notion of what they had done together. Unfortunately, all he remembered of the night before were some half-clear ideas of how to describe the softened curve of Dean's jaw as he slept in the old language, older than Ennochian, older than Death.
all of it had been Dean's doing. He lowered his mouth to the head of Cas's leaking dick, eyes not leaving his, wanting to see exactly how Cas's face changed when he felt a tongue on his cock for the first time. He flicked out his tongue to taste Cas's precome, to drag it slow over the head of his dick and see Cas's eyes flutter closed and his mouth open further in shock, too caught up in the sensation to do anything else. Then Dean was lost.
"It was adequate. I understand the human need for physical contact as something to be fulfilled, and it seemed a passable way of fulfilling that need." The last thing Cas had called a passable way of fulfilling a human need was the chicken Caesar salad Sam made him try. Sex, in Dean's opinion, was a hell of a lot better than a chicken Caesar salad.
"Anyone here you're into? I bet this gig could be a two-man job if you were trying to get up close and personal with any of the locals."
About halfway through the second month, Cas had discovered a lovely combination of booze, pills, weed, and some hallucinogenic mushroom Chuck had found in the woods that made it oh so easy to pretend Aaron's huge brown eyes were green, his lithe body was well-muscled yet lean and his round jaw wide and square. He made sure Aaron stayed every day after that, made sure he stayed nights too.
in guys, I mean, you probably don't want to go with anyone who doesn't have any experience with other guys, if you're looking to do anything that might, uh, be better with experience."
there, no center console in between them, no awkward sitting forward next to each other, just Cas's mouth against his, his just against his, his legs slotted between Dean's. Dean had been thinking all day about the sound Cas had made when he kissed him, how he would get him to make that sound again, but instead he was the one moaning. The tension he had been holding, not knowing when he would be able to kiss Cas, bled out of him, chased out by the glorious heat radiating out from every point of contact. Cas had always been a quick learner, Dean noted with a spark of pride as the angel took control, Cas slip his tongue across Dean's upper lip, letting him deepen the kiss and lick into Dean's mouth.
Cas smiled an impossibly soft smile, one Dean had never seen before, and turned to walk out of the door closest to them, one that was probably meant for fire alarms and smokers, not for best friends sneaking out to make out in an alleyway, but one that served their purpose just as well. Dean took one last pull of his beer before abandoning the pool table and following Cas. He nearly lost his nerve walking through the door, tried to think if it would be weird if he just went for it, or if they should try for cursory small talk, if he should point out to Cas that he totally would have won their game if he had kept at it, if he should make fun of him for quitting while he was ahead, when Cas was suddenly in his space. The door had barely clicked close by the time Cas's hands were on his shoulders, pressing him against the wall, and his mouth was on Dean's.
"Yeah, I mean. It won't be exactly the same as going for it with someone you're attracted to, but maybe that would take some of the pressure off?" Dean wondered if he sounded like he was trying to fuck Cas. "I mean, only if you think that would be helpful it's not like. . ."
So, within a week of Dean telling himself he would wait until Cas brought it up, give him time to figure it out, he found himself again asking, "Anyone here you're trying to see more of?"
He nearly startled when Cas's eyes slid away from his, scanning around the bar. They came to rest on Dean again without settling on anyone for more than a second. "No one here."
was didn't want to do it again? This was Cas, he would just say so if he wanted to stop or continue, right? Would he want to have a whole conversation about it or would he just go for it?  Should Dean just go for it? But he didn't want to freak Cas out, the whole point was a slow introduction to the whole kissing dudes thing, maybe that would be too fast for him.
"Could you zap over to Japan or someplace, see if there's any soap or toilet paper or something left? We're runnin' low on supplies and unless we get our asses in gear we're gonna have a lot of angry campers on our hands," Dean had asked, still confident, still kind. Because Cas was an
Dean laughed for real this time, it was nice to see Cas shift away from his normal celestial-being-funneled-towards-a-single-goal seriousness to these little sparks of bitchiness--much better than his earlier shift to someone embarrassed and unsure. "Yeah, um, about Sammy. . ."
for God's sake. The first girl -- Cas forgot her name -- came because she heard of his strange little white pills. Cas had assumed she wanted to take them from him, but it turned out she only wanted to share her own, as well as a strange plant they smoked together. It was like flying, soaring through the cosmos without a care in the world.
Cas stared at him for a moment, hollow defeat choking him as he forgot the ways he had grasped just a night ago to capture Dean's essence in his anger. He choked out a hollow laugh and turned to pour himself a drink of the hardest liquor he had.
He had had some pretty damn good blowjobs in his life, knew that sometimes the best way about it was a good tease, a good slow build, showing off tricks and different sensations, focusing more on the favorites but switching it up enough to track it out. He knew he couldn't do that now, knew he needed this just as much as Cas did, needed to feel him fill him up, feel the weight of him pressing down on his tongue, against the back of his throat. Dean could drag it out another time. So he sucked him down, pressing his tongue against the underside of Cas's dick and heard him make a strangled sound above him. Dean grabbed Cas's thigh, the very same one he had been grinding on earlier, and gripped it for balance, for grounding, as he pulled off and took him in his mouth again.
had been the same for Cas as his "passable" earlier encounter, until he registers the wry smile on Cas's face and lets out a laugh that is more relief than amusement.
"Our fearless leader, I'm afraid, is all too well schooled in the art of getting to the truth." Cas had been furious when Dean took up torture again. He had yet to discover drugs and was just barely adjusting to life without wings when he had heard. Cas had found Dean in his cabin and Cas had yelled until he was blue in the face, but Dean's calm wouldn't break. The next morning the camp had run slow, everyone jumpy and anxious with their hero too hung-over to do much of anything.
. Just gentle kisses, no depth or heat, lips sliding against each other with little pressure behind them, like a lingering goodbye after an afternoon coffee date, no intention of taking things further or heated memories behind it. It had been a long time since Dean had kissed anyone like this. It had been a long time since he'd kissed anyone he'd known longer than a week. He wasn't sure if he'd ever kissed anyone he'd known more than a year (maybe you could count Lisa, if the nine year gap between meetings still counted). He would have thought it would be weirder, kissing Cas, kissing a friend. But it was nice. He loved a good panty-dropping, we-just-met-but-we're-gonna-know-each-other-a-whole-lot-better-soon sorta kiss, but this was nice. He felt settled, feeling the feathers he had felt ruffle in himself over the course of their conversation, over the last few weeks watching Cas watch guys, not knowing how to nudge him in the right direction, smooth back into place. His nervous thoughts slowed and quieted until he wasn't thinking at all any  more, just kissing Cas slow and steady.
"That was, uh . . ." Dean starts and immediately trails off, unsure if he'll be able to put together a coherent sentence at the moment.
"I mean, you've kissed people before though, yeah? I wouldn't think there's all that much of a difference, maybe some beard involved, but--"
" Cas gasped, and it was Dean's favorite way anyone had said his name, wanted to make Cas say it like that a million times more, but before he could tell Cas to say it again, his hands were tightening in his hair, holding his head in place. Cas wasn't quite fucking his face--and if Dean's mouth were free, he would tell him that he could, that he should--but his hips were thrusting forward in tiny, desperate movements as Cas let out choked out little gasps, higher and higher and higher until he shuddered forward, coming in Dean's mouth. Dean felt him pulse against his tongue as he swallowed him down, wanting to keep Cas's dick in his mouth for as long as possible, feeling satisfied and safe under Cas's hands, between Cas's legs. Eventually, Cas softens and Dean lets him slip out of his mouth, still in a daze as Cas pulls him to his feet.
He thought maybe, just maybe, if he flew high enough with this one last go, if he was lucky enough to find the perfect way in the old language to precisely encapsulate Dean, maybe Cas could find his soul on its way up to God-knows-where, and they could make their last journey together. And maybe, just maybe, Dean would want Castiel by his side.
, wanted to make him gasp again, make a noise again, wanted to taste his mouth with his tongue and get lost in it. He wanted Cas to break, to drop the mirroring act and go for what he wanted, to
"Human," Cas finished for him, disgust for himself welling up. He couldn't even hear Dean say the word that made him redundant. "Yes."
"That may be a problem…" Cas stumbled over the words, reluctant to let Dean know how inconsequential Cas was now.
Dean nearly lost his balance with how fast his hands went to his own belt, shoving his pants and underwear just far enough down his hips to take himself in hand, too dry until he pulled off Cas's spit-slick cock, groaning at the sight, and spit into his palm to ease his way, diving back down to his task.
Dean how to tell if he was attracted to someone. But Dean had told him and he had checked that guy out, so maybe he was figuring it out now? Dean thought he should maybe give him some space, not at all influenced by the fact that he had
Dean sat down next to him on the bed, not sure if he wanted to provide comfort or to break Cas out of staring off, if he just wanted his attention back on him. "It's important to you. You don't want to mess it up." He didn't know if talking about his first kiss--he had been 13, palms sweaty and leaving town the next day, but still desperate for it to be good, for him and the girl, Amelia Hutchins, even if he wouldn't ever see her again--would come off as condescending or not.
Cas himself first noticed when they were shimmying under barbed wire to escape an ambush from Croats. A gash on his arm, bright red against his pale, still clean skin that wouldn't heal-- that
Now-Dean began to lay out his plan, suicidal and idiotic. Cas felt the need to point out the sheer insanity of his plan to him.
moaned. Dean's minimal self control snapped, and he thrust his hard-on against Cas's thigh, the friction nearly making his eyes roll back in his head before he froze, not knowing if he had crossed a line. But Cas just moaned again, and Dean was off, grinding against Cas's thigh as they panted into each other's mouths. Their kisses got sloppier and sloppier as Dean practically rode his best friend's leg, unable to focus on making his lips and tongue work in tandem as all his attention fell to how
been a guy, right? He suddenly doubted himself. Not just a flat-chested woman with short hair? Maybe that was his type? The woman he had sent Cas home with before had been on the bustier side, maybe that was the issue? He nodded along to Sam's plan until he was finished and starting to ask about any intel they had gathered from witness that help might them figure out what object the curse was tied to, then tapped his empty bottle on the table and announced that he was going to get another round.
How Cas hated it, to see Dean thinking the only thing that could possibly go wrong with his plan was for the rest of the world to have as little soap as they.
, but instead his mouth was dry and his heart was racing and he was afraid he would lose his nerve if he let them go a second longer sitting next to each other like this. So he leaned in and kissed him. Cas made a brief, pleased noise of surprise as he relaxed into it that Dean suddenly, intensely wanted to make him make again. His hand came to rest on the back of Dean's neck, Dean realized just as Dean's had on his just a few days ago. Learning by example, it seemed.
"Ah, Dean. Nice to see we've finally made it to this point. How long has it taken you? Five years? Probably would have gone a lot faster if you hadn't been worrying over your little pet angel. What was his name again?"
There was a bump outside the door, and they jolt apart, Dean's entire body tensing at the thought of someone finding them like that. A curse and stumbled steps away suggested some drunk guy just wobbled a little too far off his path and had found his shoulder suddenly assaulted by the rough outside wall. Dean laughed, more a sound of sudden tension dissipated than genuine amusement--he felt like a teenager again, almost caught by his dad, risking wrath for indulging in such a distraction. He couldn't imagine his dad would have reacted well to this.
The werewolf was back, teeth snapping an inch from Dean's neck as his heart took off again. "Uh, yeah. Yeah sure." His palms were sweaty. He looked away, and looked back, and looked away again, and laughed. It felt strange to go from having a normal (well, kind of normal) talk with Cas to making out, even if he had just
Cas looked at him for a moment, seeming to run the suggestion through his normal-person-to-uptight-angel translator before responding. "I don't think sexual intercourse is worth leaving you and Sam without backup."
"Hopefully that wasn't Sam missing the room after overexerting himself at the gym." Cas said, apparently on the same page as Dean regarding Sam's interest in going to the gym for any reason other than ditching them for the night--though he probably knew Sam's actual intentions though his angelic intel, instead of Dean's good old-fashioned knowing his baby brother.
And then, in a flash, Dean was on the ground with a foot pressed into his neck, just catching a glimpse of his past self before Lucifer pressed down and he heard a final
Dean first noticed weeks after Cas, weeks that Cas had spent horrified at the idea that he couldn't fly, couldn't heal, couldn't help anymore. His old language -- the one of northern auroras and dewdrops in the morning and the birth of stars -- was fading fast and he could barely even wrap his head around what a dust storm swirling through the desert was supposed to
Dean just gritted his teeth and pulled the Colt out and aimed it right at his little brother's head as Lucifer made Sam's face twist into a smile. "Die you dumb son of a bitch."
"Perhaps you must have to teach me about misrepresenting my abilities to people as well. It seems my habitual honesty can be a sticking point for many humans."
A week later, they're in a dive bar waiting to meet up with Sam, who must be nearing last call at the local library, when Dean brings it up.
what Cas was doing to him, what he was doing to Cas, drive him over the edge, moaning around Cas's cock as he spilled onto the ground.
? Didn't panic the instant you thought something was wrong with him? Don't think I don't know every little thing that goes on in that little camp of yours. He was all you had left and all he wanted to do was forget about you. Don’t think I don’t know you would have given the world for him to have meant that kiss, for him to not have been gone from the world because of some hallucinogenic plant or another. Don't think I don't know you wanted to murder the girls who slept with him. Or that boy. The big-eyed one, I would describe him better, but I can't keep as close tabs on the little cockroaches that aren't infected with my little masterpiece of a disease."
He kept running over their conversation in his head. Had it been implied it was a one-time thing? Or that they'd do it again? He didn't know if he was supposed to look at Cas or not. How much was normal for him to look as Cas If he paid enough attention, could he tell what Cas wanted? Or would he freak him out staring? Could anyone could freak Cas out by staring? Sammy would notice if he was staring. Especially when it was hard to keep a straight face looking at Cas, he had kissed him intense and studious, exactly the way Cas would kiss someone. It was too normal, too much like Cas, to separate it from the Cas who explained monster lore to them. It hadn't changed anything that they had kissed. Hadn't changed Cas, or their friendship, or the way he acted. Everything continued on as it had before.
Before Dean could tell Cas to let him know if he saw someone and he could wingman for him--which would certainly lead to an explanation of the term "wingman" and Dean making a joke about it applying to Cas more than Dean, which would lead to Cas explaining that his wings aren't
Of course he disapproved. Cas was a shitty little soldier after all. Couldn’t stay an angel, couldn't heal himself, could hardly keep his
Dean let out the breath he had been planning to use for the rest of his awkward ramble. "Oh. Okay, good, we're on the same page then." Dean thought maybe he should kiss Cas again, but the mood had shifted and he wasn't sure if he was supposed to.
Dean. The one he had first seen broken in Hell, the one that still had his brother, the one that thought of Cas as important. It was messy and sloppy and Cas so
Gearing up to kill the devil wasn't the best experience when you knew it was a suicide mission. Old-Dean was hissing at Cas's Dean about letting friends die, but Cas had known this was a long time coming. This suicide mission was a welcome the pit of crap that had become his life. Maybe if Dean killed the devil he'd start smiling again. Maybe, if God was kind, he would let Cas see that before he wiped his existence from the earth. So Cas went in guns blazing, ready to take out a million Croats and demons on his way out.
he learned to do that, because Dean certainly had not been involved in any neck-kissing of any kind with him, before Cas pressed a simple kiss to just below his ear. He must have seen someone else do it, a particularly PDA couple or on one of the Dr. Sexy episodes Dean had made him watch, slightly unsure of the actual mechanics of it. It didn't matter to Dean. The press of his lips against such a vulnerable spot had Dean groaning, head falling forward to latch his own lips onto Cas's neck, running his tongue on the underside of Cas's jaw, sucking bruises he knew Cas could easily heal, running his teeth down the side of his neck, feeling Cas mimic his actions on Dean himself, making him shudder. He moved the hand not on Cas's waist to tug urgently at Cas's tie, getting it loosened enough that he could open up the top buttons of his shirt, drag his collars--three of them, god damn it--open to expose more neck for Dean to get his mouth on.
Dean groans and takes his wallet out of his back pocket, counting bills and tossing them in the middle of the table for the annoying vultures to snatch at their own leisure. He finishes his slices of pizza and gets up to toss his paper plate in the garbage.
“My dad didn’t,” Dean starts, and then he doesn’t quite know how to finish that sentence. He tries again. “Mom was a touchy subject, growing up.”
The first two years, Dean couldn’t really separate Jack’s birthday from the day Cas—you know. Even now, when Dean’s the happiest he’s ever been—his angel on top of him, his brother and his kid down the hall, the world free of a wrathful, manipulative god—he can’t help but think of that night by the lake and the bright white flash of Cas’ grace. Can’t help but think of how close he came to not having any of this. Like he knows the track Dean’s mind is barreling down, Cas makes a noise and presses even closer, finding Dean’s other hand and tangling their fingers together. Overwhelmed, Dean breaks the kiss and leans back just enough to look into Cas’ eyes. He’s never been good at verbalizing his feelings, but it feels like if he doesn’t get this out, he’s going to explode.
“Forget the laptop,” he says. “What the hell are you two doing getting mud all over my bunker? Huh?”
“Here,” he says, handing it over. She takes it slowly, cautiously, and Dean watches her face closely as she opens it up and processes what she’s looking at. Her eyes flit from photograph to photograph rapidly, before moving one by one like molasses, drinking every last detail in like maybe Dean’s going to take the album away once she’s done.
“Nah,” Dean says, even though a monkey cowboy sure is tempting. “Don’t wanna steal your thunder. I bet we can find something just as cool.”
Dean holds out a hand, and Cas takes it, pulling it up to his lips and placing a kiss on Dean’s knuckles. Dean feels heat flood his cheeks. He’s getting better when it comes to shameless expressions of affection like that, but it still takes him by surprise sometimes. Cas had his own shit to deal with, of course, but he didn’t grow up in a world that taught him to be ashamed of who he loves, like Dean did. A few months ago, Dean would’ve torn his hand away right after, but now he keeps it entwined with Cas’ as they make their way to the garage.
“Hey,” Dean shouts, gathering everyone’s attention. “We gunna stand out here all day or are we going to go build some bears?”
Emily leads them towards the back of the store, where she proceeds to explain how the day is going to go. Dean booked the most expensive party package, so they’ve got free reign when it comes to bear choice—no option is off limits, apparently. They each get to choose a bear, an optional sound effect, and an outfit. One whole wall of the store is filled with all the potential bears to choose from, and Dean is shocked at how many options there actually are. Some of them seem to be normal teddy bears, whereas others are famous cartoon characters, like the ones from the Lion King. Dean spots the How to Train Your Dragon one Jack mentioned. It
Emily has him stand on the operating pedal while she stuffs his hot pink sloth, asking him questions like what’s his favorite animal (axolotl), his favorite holiday (Valentine’s Day), and how old he’s turning today (four). That last answer throws her off enough that some stuffing escapes the tube and floats through the air. Cas reaches out his hands to try and catch some, and Dean just gives her one of his prize-winning grins instead of trying to explain—he wouldn’t even know where to begin. Looking a little dazed, she finishes up with Jack’s sloth and then walks Jack through the heart ceremony, adding a few extra steps for him, since he’s much more into the whole thing than Sam had been. After that, it’s Dean’s turn.
It’s late when she gets in, a few hours after Sam, Eileen, and Jack have all turned in for the night. The first thing she does is make fun of his hot dog pants. After Dean locks the door behind her, she follows him down to the Dean Cave, where Cas is waiting with the movie paused.
“Yeah,” Dean says, rubbing his hand across his mouth. Even he hears how unconvincing he sounds. “Yeah, being here just...” Dean waves his other hand around, gesturing at the whole place. “I guess Jimmy and Amelia brought her here one time.”
Their group disperses along the selection wall, pointing at various displays and picking up the unstuffed bears from the bins below. Dean figures a monkey is as good a choice as any, so he grabs one of the freaky little skins and searches out Cas. He’s further down the stuffed animal wall, apparently debating between a sea turtle and a plain, light-colored teddy bear. Dean slides up next to him, one hand in his monkey skin like it’s a puppet.
Jody and Donna take turns hugging him next, wishing him a happy birthday and asking if he was surprised. Jack nods vigorously and tells them all about his surprise breakfast, too. Dean catches sight of Cas watching Jack talk to the girls—Cas has got this awestruck smile on his face, half euphoric, half disbelieving, like he can’t completely comprehend the kid in front of him. Dean thinks he knows the feeling.
“Yeah, no, you’re right,” he admits, snorting, as he slips the button into his monkey and passes him to Emily. She instructs him to press down the operating pedal with his foot, and Dean watches as she methodically moves the monkey around so that stuffing makes its way into every nook and cranny.
Jack’s mid-conversation with Cas, too caught up in whatever he’s telling his father about to notice where they are, and it takes Cas nudging him gently with an elbow for him to finally look away. Dean watches as Jack’s eyes travel from the Build-A-Bear sign to the girls to Dean and back to Cas.
Walking into the Dean Cave, Dean takes note of the DVD title screen on the TV and throws a handful of popcorn kernels at the back of Sam’s head, where he’s bent over trying to set up subtitles.
thinking about the fact that he’d been planning to send some pictures to Rowena at the end of the night.
“Jack’s birthday is coming up,” Dean says. Jody hums in acknowledgment. “Cas and I are thinking of surprising him. Taking him to that Build-A-Bear place. You know it?”
“Damn straight,” Dean says, fixing a second plate for Cas, who hasn’t moved from his place next to Jack. Just as they all sit down and start to dig in, Dean hears the unmistakable sound of the bunker’s front door opening. For a moment, his adrenaline spikes at the thought of something or someone breaking in, before Sam scoots his chair back and stands up.
When he gets back, that drawer is empty, so Dean slides it back into the dresser and pulls out the next one. There are a couple of pairs of sweatpants haphazardly shoved inside, which Dean folds neatly and stacks on top of the bed. Seriously, he’s going to have to teach Cas a few things if this is really how he’s been living these past few months. Dean loves him, he does, but if Cas remains this chaotic and blasé about organization, then Dean’s not so sure this relationship is going to work out.
The two of them get in their car, and Claire approaches Dean, having already said goodbye to the others. He stares at her for a moment, both of them with their hands in their pockets and waiting for the other one to say something first.
Claire avoids eye contact with all three of them, and subtly runs a finger under both of her eyes to catch the unshed tears. Dean notices it smudges her eye makeup.
Claire shakes her head, raking the brush over the turtle a little more aggressively. “My mom didn’t pack a whole lot for me when she abandoned me at my grandma’s. I went back to our old house after grandma died, but I guess the bank took it back or something. I don’t know what they did with all our stuff.”
“Hey, uh,” Dean starts, licking his lips and trying to keep his voice neutral. “How many songs you got on this one, bud?”
“And then you’ll be ready to take your furry friends home!” Emily says, and Dean realizes he spaced out throughout her entire speech. Oh well. He can just follow Cas around the whole time—
The timer beeps, and Dean takes the pan out of the oven, setting it on the stove to cool for five or so minutes.
Dean settles back onto the couch, pressing the entire length of their sides together and leaning his weight heavily into Cas. They’d been sprawled across the whole thing horizontally before Claire texted, Dean on top with Cas’ hands running absentmindedly up and down his spine, but Dean figured that, as comfortable as Claire had gotten with them lately, that might’ve been a bit much.
in yellow lettering. Jack holds it up to his body, and Dean gives it five minutes before the kid takes off his jacket and replaces it with his new sweatshirt.
When Dean’s alarm goes off the morning of Jack’s birthday, Cas is the one who groans in frustration and flings an arm out to slam on the snooze button of Dean’s clock radio before burrowing even deeper into his pillow. A laugh bubbles out of Dean’s chest at the sight, and he runs his fingers down the side of Cas’ torso.
“You can put a sound effect in your bear,” Emily explains, pointing at a fixture behind Dean. “There’s a heartbeat, and some songs from kids’ movies. You can also record your own if you want.”
“No friggin’ way,” he cheers as he rushes to the far corner and tugs a Han Solo costume off the hanger. He presents it to Jack. “This is the one.”
The drive goes smoothly—no traffic; only one stop for gas, snacks, and a bathroom break; and Jack is happy to let Dean put on
“This is so the dough doesn’t stick,” he explains, smearing flour along the length of the rolling pin, too. “It starts sticking, you just add more flour.”
Jack sets the books down on the table and dives back into the bag, re-emerging with what looks like a silver and black metal suitcase. Jack unlatches the closure and opens it, revealing a fancy art kit—one with a bunch of markers and crayons and colored pencils and paint. This one even has colored charcoal, which seems way too fancy for a kid, but who’s Dean to judge? Jack launches himself into Cas’ embrace, and they hold each other tight as Jack repeatedly thanks him and Cas repeatedly wishes him a happy, happy birthday.
“In your dad’s wallet,” he says, and she looks up at him sharply, eyes wet. She swallows thickly, and Dean finds himself doing the same, more emotional than he had expected.
“Huh,” Dean repeats, albeit this time less confused and more contemplative. He looks over the options and grabs one of the do-it-yourself buttons, holding it out to Cas. “You wanna say something, angel?”
—being Tilda Swinton and Balthazar being a demon was absolutely batshit insane. Dean’s brain hurts if he thinks about it all too hard. It was entertaining, at least.
that, so he nods, commiserating with Claire about how fucked up the whole situation is. “You can say that again.”
Jody and Donna both make sympathetic noises, and, luckily, neither of them asks for more information. Dean decides to change the subject, and he doesn’t care how unsubtle it is.
Jack nods and opens the top drawer of his desk, where Dean knows he keeps some of his favorite books. Dean exits and is about to knock on Sammy’s door when something occurs to him. He takes a few steps back and smacks the doorframe to get Jack’s attention.
“Is Claire okay?” he asks, gazing somewhere over Dean’s shoulder. Dean follows his eyeline and finds Claire next to Jack, the two of them considering the outfit options for their bears.
Claire approaches the swing set and says something that Dean can’t hear—whatever it is, it inspires Jack to quite literally
To his left, Cas beams in pride. All at once, everyone sings the happy birthday song, and Dean honestly thinks this is the happiest Jack has ever looked in his whole life. At the end of the song, Jack squeezes his eyes shut and makes another wish—his third of the day—and blows out his candle. Everyone hoots and hollers and applauds loudly.
Claire does, and she lets out a quiet laugh when she sees the next photos. Her gaze is less heavy as she explores the third and fourth pages, which isn’t too much of a surprise, but it makes Dean feel more like he’s done something right with this. Eventually, she closes the album and sets it down gently on the armchair. Then she springs forward for a hug, standing on her tip toes so she can wrap her arms around Dean’s neck.
“It’s not a date!” Dean demands a moment later, finally turning away from his brother—intent on ignoring him from here on out. “Cas had promised his ex,
“Uh …” Dean’s baffled mind resets, working strictly on default now and canceling out all the vile, angry things he should be saying, “Winchester. I’m Dean Winchester.”
“So, this must be Susan—nice to meet you, I’m Dean.” Dean reaches out his hand and shakes the woman’s, and her fingers are soft and warm.
“Would you like me to get you something? I know Marty just made a batch of blueberry muffins. They smell amazing.”
. Castiel made it quick though—and he even began humming a time or two, just a nameless tune but the rumbly sound was pleasant all the same, and it was a good distraction from everything else Dean
Dean had stopped eating, taking a moment to just stare at Lynn instead. Her neat bun sat poised atop her head, grey hairs woven in between the dark strands like braids. Her skin was soft, dark and rippled, like the surface of his coffee, but something about the way the afternoon light caught her between the counter and the dust, she looked young. She looked beautiful—and she looked broken. Like a bloom with only half its pedals.
Sam does feel a little guilty now, because he knows how hard losing Cas was on Dean. He saw just how broken his brother had been; and he saw just how whole he became again when Castiel finally returned. And here
Charlie giggles and then loops her arms around his neck, popping her chin over his shoulder so she can see what he’s doing. “Uh—
by specialty. And there's something about that thought makes Dean feel warm inside, all the way to the tips of his toes, so he decides that when the waitress comes back—he’s going to do what he doesn’t do very often: he’s going to chat with her
“Yeah, well—as usual, Amelia turned him down; but then I—” Dean stops, as if he’s suddenly unsure about telling the rest of this story.
He wants to give Castiel a happier memory in the back of this truck—something to make him forget the hurt of his past.
A slight tinge of pink graces Castiel’s cheeks, and he eventually shakes his head. “Well, actually—I think I’m talking more because … you make me a little nervous too.”
seem really happy with his newfound relationship, and Dean couldn’t be happier because of it. And he can’t wait to tell Charlie all about their unique little dinner on Monday at work. She was hounding him for details all day, but he had none to give. Bobby didn't tell him much about his mystery girlfriend, other than her name and that she was "real pretty— too pretty for me." Charlie promised to knock some sense into the old man later for not having confidence in himself.

” Castiel says even more stiffly, and Dean thinks that the simple name has never sounded so awkward.
suddenly bounces the carriage beneath his seat, and then the pedal gives way under his foot, feeling free and floating within the socket.
“Dude … clumsy doesn’t even start to explain what you did to most of those books! The slug? The nail? I mean—one was covered entirely in paint!”
anymore, Sam! Once your face is up beside Tyra’s and Giselle’s, you can’t trust anyone! That kid may’ve been harmless, but he could’ve just as easily been a little psycho who wanted to carve out your spleen for a keepsake!”
He had been sitting in his office for well over an hour. Charlie had given up on pounding at the door nearly twenty minutes ago, but he knew that her pause would only be temporary. What he
But there’s no answer, and even though he knew there wouldn’t be, Dean still expected one. He still expected that old man to come into this room, cussing at him to get off the floor and stop crying like a baby. And as long as he stays here, he’ll
can really shine. Dean laughs once Castiel disappears into the hallway, and then he laughs louder as he imagines how he must look right now…
his original plan—but as Dean drove up the long drive towards the main farmhouse, he saw the archway set up outside in the garden, and all the tables spread out across the lawn, bordering a checkered dancefloor in the middle of the grass. Cars were parked along the edge of the space and the entire wedding would apparently be taking place outside, and outside of Dean’s range of safe distance. He couldn’t park with the other cars—Cas would surely recognize the Impala. And if he parked around back, he wouldn’t be able to see a thing with the farmhouse in the way. Panicking, Dean turns off at the right of the main entryway, following the catering van that was pulling along the other side of the building.
Dean sighs. “What do you want me to do, Cas? Do you want me to call you my boyfriend? Fine—you’re my boyfriend… if you wanna be, of course.”
Dean quickly turns and continues on down the road, following Hoss’s directions to the barber shop. He’s never actually
… it’d be hard if you have people waiting on you at home, because you may not be there very much.” Dean is yammering and he’s backpedaling, and he scratching at the walls, but all he’s doing is making himself slip deeper into this well of idiocy, so he finally shuts up.
alright? Happy?” Dean rolls his eyes, dumping the sugar into the mixing bowl with the flour and coco powder before going back to the paper in front of him to read the next step.
With a chuckle, Castiel eats another fry. “Dean …” he starts again once he swallows, “you are not the first gay man that I’ve dated; and straight women are worried about the exact same thing. It makes sense that you’d have questions if this type of situation is unfamiliar to you. It’s normal. And in truth, I’d much prefer you ask me directly in order to express your concerns, rather than staying quiet and letting those questions consume you.”
“That’s right. This end o’ town is much more quiet. Ya ain’t gonna find any of those cookie cutter stores and shops in these parts. We got the ma n’ pop places here. It’s a
He’s ashamed that he’s never thought about it— about what Dean had to do after they broke up. They were already heading into separate dorms for their Junior year, but Castiel did his best to avoid the man beyond that. They were in separate majors, so that helped, but if he saw Dean walking one way, he’d immediately walk the other. He never thought about what the aftermath truly looked like for Dean once he ended things—where the man went and who he confided in. Cas supposes he didn’t want to know, because hearing about it now, imagining Dean crying on his mother’s shoulder, venting to his little brother, showing all the raw pieces of himself to his family so they could try to help him mend, it all makes Castiel want to run simply to spare Dean even the slightest bit more pain.  Yet, he has grown too, and he has learned all too well that life is short, but even that brevity can spare a lot of time for loneliness if you let it; and Castiel is through just allowing life to have its way with him. “I’m so sorry, Dean. I’m sorry I was so selfish before, and too scared to acknowledge how I felt … how I
Dean is a busted, rusty, squeaky, torn up office chair, and for some reason—Castiel said that he wants to take him home.
“It’s alright. I realize now that I would have not been happy in the life. I thought I would be because it would have made my parents so happy; but I learned a long time ago that their happiness in no way reflected my own.”
With that, the towel is quickly pulled away which causes the cool air to prick at Dean’s skin like mosquitoes. He squints a little, now feeling like the dim, yellow light filtering throughout the shop is just a touch too bright for his comfort.
So with a snort, he reaches over to the side of the table where an intercom button has been set up, eventually pressing it and calling out “Next!”
With another nod, Dean grabs the book again and starts walking towards the door so he can get to the circulation desk. “Okay, well—I’ll check it in now and find out who this book-destroying D-bag is.”
“Don’t be nervous! Remember what the book said … lean into the turns and lay off the clutch!” Suddenly, with a loud rev and a hiss of the tailpipe, Castiel is off … speeding down the dirt path like the Road Runner, and Dean is left behind, coughing in a cloud of dust—as stupefied and pathetic as Mr. Wile E. Coyote himself.
now. This felt like neither the time nor the place for Castiel to be a soldier. He needed to be more and less, stronger yet powerless. He needed to be the grey area within this black and white world. Whatever this was—whatever they were doing here, Castiel needed to be different than any other form he has ever taken. He didn’t know if he was okay, because in that moment, he didn’t know who he was supposed to be.
“Yup!” Dean says happily, practically skipping the rest of the way to the circulation desk so he can hand her the bag of supplies.
Dean ignores him while looking at the book that he wants to check out—heart leaping into his throat when he reads the title: “Rock Climbing for Beginners”.
“I know, girl Not much longer, okay?” he whispers to her, patting her roof as he swings the door closed behind him. With a soft smile, he then turns away, picking up speed as his stomach starts to rumble. A tiny bell chimes when he enters the diner, and soon, a rotund, sweet faced woman is waving him over to a stool pressed up against the counter.
Sam steps up to the two of them and pats Castiel’s back reassuringly. “Yeah, man. Really. I have been wanting to meet ya, and I know that our mom would cosmically kick both our asses if we didn’t make you feel welcome just because of the date on the calendar.”
“What? Do you not believe me?” Castiel asks, still looking at his tea. “I know, it is a rather unbelievable story.”
Dean isn’t really sure, nor does he care, because Castiel is squatting down now, inspecting the levers on the underside of the chair, gripping one and manipulating it slowly, making the chair move up and down.
He’s not even sure why he thought it at the time. He hadn’t known the angel long at that point, but maybe it was because he could tell, even way back then, there was something special about Castiel. There was something fun and unique, powerful and strange, something Dean knew he had to hold onto.
. Because no matter how many times he sees Sam walking around in the bunker, hair longer than ever, reading books and acting like his old nerdy self, and no matter how much he still feels Jack around him
“It’s fine” she says, but now Dean is noticing just how tight her voice is, almost as if she’s trying to whisper.
Dean nods against the phone, wondering why he even had to ask. There were only two places around here that people got hitched—the old church on main street, or out on Thompson Ranch. If people didn’t get married at either one, then they were usually traveling out of town—something that Dean was worried about up until now. His plan to check in on Cathy and Cas would be thwarted if her sister decided to get married somewhere far away. “Gotcha.  So what time does the ceremony start?”
“Oh yeah! Where is that book? I wanna see it! You didn’t throw it out already, did you?” Charlie asks, now sniffing around the tiny office like a bloodhound.
“And I was there when you fell out of the window of that house … directly onto that anthill.” Castiel’s smile suddenly drops. “You killed so many ants that night, Dean. It was awful.”
, rolling up just as the dancing begins. And then a slow song comes on, and Cathy pulls Cas reluctantly to the dance floor.
“When you grow up with such a large family, you get used to people always being around you; and it’s easy to feel lonely when they’re not there.”
Bobby chuckles but then waves Dean over to sit down at the small table by the window. “Want some sausage?”
a god. Still don’t know what the hell you are, and I’m still not sure if I believe any of this is actually happening, but at least I know
“Dean?” Sam’s voice calls out from the living room, and Dean’s brain short circuits—too many emotions, too many surprises, too much out of the ordinary that he wasn’t planning on for today is making everything spark.
“Wait—Dean …” but he isn’t sure of where that thought will end. Cas isn’t used to not working out his thoughts. Sometimes, they are the only things he feels he has control over, so he will work them nearly to death. He doesn’t sleep nor does he need to eat or drink. He has no distractions, so his mind can work constantly, and that usually allows him the advantage of knowing what to say and how to say it. But he has just had some of the best distraction of his life, and his mind is having a hard time getting back into the rhythm of working like it used to.
Castiel shakes his head again—and it causes misty tears to float from his eyes, flitting through the air,
… I don’t …” he questions aloud, turning the book over and over in his hands, trying gently several more times to pull the covers apart. “Why?” he finally exclaims to the dust, now noticing some large staples as well, like from a staple gun—imbedded in the back cover near the spine.
Sam laughed. “True. But then she’d probably get distracted by some book she hadn’t read yet and leave you there.”
, you did a number on him, but he’ll heal.” He can feel Castiel relax a little in his arms with the news before finally pulling away again.
Castiel floats upright and seems to grow even larger in doing so. "Well, I am always close if you decide you want to speak with me again. I would very much enjoy asking you more questions as well. I think we could learn a lot from each other."
Charlie rolls her eyes at him. “I was going to do it after work today, but since you’re basically doing
seems to have made a deal with the Devil himself, because any extra line that he might have, only accentuates his appeal
Castiel bobs his head slowly and then folds his hands in his lap. “Yes. I began studying it fifteen years ago, when I started college. My roommate was already very skilled in the art, and I took an interest.”
It wasn’t a question, it was simply fact—and up until this very moment, Dean had never realized it. When Brad first approached him with that cucumber in his hand, he had laughed. He thought it was a joke, but Brad was serious. He was serious and he was insistent. With every bit of resistance that Dean put up, Brad offered some other seedy reason why it would be “hot”.
All at once, the figure slows and turns its head. Bright, familiar blue eyes shine across the field and latch onto Dean’s, and for a brief and blinding second, the thing smiles— and the world goes white.
Dean takes one, short breath before climbing up to kneel on the bed, quickly leaning forward to collect Castiel’s face in his hands. He pulls him close and he kisses him soft, but with a fierceness that the angel wasn’t expecting. “Have you ever known me to abandon you?”
Dean had dreamed of it far more than he cares to admit. He was dreaming of it even back when he still hated Castiel. But now that he doesn’t … now that they’re here, lying on top of one another in the bed of this truck; now that in some, almost supernatural way, Castiel is
“Hey! I’m not self-loathing, I just think that I could probably do better in every single area of my life and everyone is too good to be around me.”
“All the more reason to love him!” Dean shouts a moment later, raising his glass to Magda before she can continue her speech.
Dinner was amazing—not necessarily the food. The food was fine; but Cas was being serious when he said he wasn’t much of a cook. The amazing thing though was the fact that Dean laughed nearly all the way through the meal. Castiel started telling him about his life on the farm, from having to breed the cows to horrible mishaps with an automatic tiller.
Dean smirks and then turns his attention back to the bar—but the couple is gone now, and Dean’s throat closes with the thought of them tangled together in one of the sedans outside.
“I knew the moment I saw your face and Brad behind you, what had happened. I suppose, that’s all it took for me to lose control. I am sorry for that.”
Castiel nods stiffly and Dean reaches out his hand to him. He takes it, and soon enough, he’s upright again—peeling off his helmet and drinking in the fresh air. “That was …
“I left to put the animal back near his mother’s remains, and then I spread more seeds over the disrupted land. I also directed many of the neighboring insects to the dead bodies—the sooner they start the process of breaking them down, the sooner the earth there can begin to mend.”
Magda wastes no time in rushing over, helping to steady Cas on his feet before bending down to pick up his mess. “Are you alright, sir?”
The stranger—now known to be the notorious Castiel Novak, sighs—as if explaining all this is completely unnecessary. “I was attempting to brew my own beer, but the hops weren’t boiling down correctly, so I was reading the book and looking over the edge of the vat to see where I had gone wrong, and then I set the book down on the edge of the vat to check the temperature gauge, and I must’ve knocked it in with my movement. I didn’t realize it was in there until a few days later, which of course, had a poor effect on my beer. In any event, the book was illegible at that point, so I couldn’t figure out how to rectify the process; then I gave up on it, and now I’m here.”
“I … it was a joke, man” Dean stutters, looking Castiel up and down—wanting to think he’s all sort of weird, but instead, he’s just finding him positively
“Was the woman alright?” Sam asks, obviously showing quite a bit more decorum than his older brother.
Castiel is the one grinning now. “Yes, Sam. Please do.” He liked Sam the moment he met him. They got along swimmingly; and for all of Dean’s teasing, Sam could bring it right back in tenfold—giving Castiel a nice break whenever they all hung out together; which was quite often these days.
Heather purses her lips, obviously noting the change in his demeanor, but thankfully, she doesn’t ask if he’s okay again. Castiel doesn’t think he’d be able to come up with a lie anyway. After another few seconds, she raises her hand and lightly rubs his arm, making sure that she catches his full attention before she speaks. “Let me know if there’s anything else you need, alright?”
A bald-headed man with a few painful looking piercings gawks up at him from a short stool set up beside the tattoo chair; and for a moment, Dean wonders if he should get some of
“I'm sorry about that. The antarctic ice shelf was cracking again, and I needed to check to make sure it wasn't about to break off completely." The hazy man then appears to shrug, like the statement was a mundane one. Castiel then lifts his chin at him, obviously noting how Dean is geared to run away. "Are you leaving?” he asks, staring at Dean inquisitively, like he
But Claire isn’t buying it. “I bet he does. According to my dad, you guys were always all over each other; and he also said that when you weren’t around, Dean could
… what are you doing here?” Dean finally whispers, feeling suddenly very trapped in that rather large bathroom.
“Another Novak book?” Charlie groans, coming closer to take the colorful, flaky thing from Dean’s hand. She tries to open it, but all the pages are painted shut.
here had some more questions for you …” he grunts, clearing his throat a second later to try and snap Dean out of his sudden bout of
“Let him go, Dean!” Sam grits, and with a growl—Dean finally drops the frightened boy, causing him to crumble like a dried up sand castle upon the white tile of the studio.
, there was one time when I invited Sammy over for some brews and a couple of steaks. And he asks if he can bring a friend, right? So I’m like—sure, whatever. And then that kid shows up at my door with freakin’ Adriana Lima on his arm!
, and I’m so fucking happy that you’re back. You could never look at me again and I’d still just be so fucking happy that you’re back.”
Cas comes back a few minutes later, after Dean’s pretty much already made his decision. He pulls his baby down onto his lap, one arm secured snugly around his stomach, and hooks his chin over Cas’ shoulder. He silently holds his phone out for Cas to look at, which he does while taking a long pull from Dean’s beer bottle.
, because there’s no way in hell he’s letting Sammy have the last word, when Cas not-so-kindly tells them both to “Shut the fuck up—the movie’s starting.”
Dean barks out a laugh and turns his head. He cups Cas’ cheek in his hand and leans in for a kiss. This friggin’ guy…
“I know,” Cas answers, with a wide happy smile and a mischievous twinkle in his eye. Dean groans loudly, rolling his eyes, and flipping them over so he’s the one on top.
“This one would be in honor of that guy Aaron,” Claire continues, presenting a bright blue shirt embellished with
He's debating whether or not to label the pictures with a date and description when he hears the bedroom door open. Soft footsteps grow closer, and then Cas is wrapping his arms around Dean from behind. Dean leans into the touch, resting his head against Cas’ bicep. He turns the pages slowly so Cas can see all the pictures, ending on the first ones of Jimmy, Amelia, and Claire. Cas doesn’t say anything, but he does press a kiss to Dean’s skull, where the bone juts out a bit behind his ear.
Handing Jack a knife, Dean instructs him to cut the log into twelve small pieces. They wind up a little uneven, but not so much so that they’ll bake funny. Jack places them one-by-one into a new pan.
The only answer Dean gets is the sound of the ball bouncing against the floor again. Dean sighs dramatically as he returns to his drawer, hoping for some attention, maybe a kiss or two, but Cas is already focused on his own task. Grumbling under his breath, Dean gathers the various burner phones and charging cords and carries them over to his room. He’s got a shoebox full of his own phones on top of the shelf in his closet, so he adds Cas’ to it, doing his best to keep them separate enough that they won’t confuse them in the future.
walking parallel to the road. He's running his hands along the tips of the grass. His shape wavers in and out of focus, almost as if he’s only being
Castiel picks up the pace, pushing in and out, causing a blissful sting to ring through Dean like electricity. “Something tells me, this isn’t enough for you.”
He and Susan both share a laugh at that, and Bobby groans with embarrassment. “Will ya stop flirtin’ with my gal, Dean? It took me long enough to do that myself. I don’t need you comin’ in here and makin’ it seem all easy.”
“He’s straight, Sam! Okay? He’s fuckin’ straight and I didn’t see it until it was right there in front of my face!” Dean pants, suddenly feeling his eyes burn—as if he could cry right now. He clears his throat, determined not to let that happen. Not over
Charlie chuckled and threw a piece of pepperoni at him, and he grinned, thankful that he at least has
wait for you in the restaurant this morning. I thought that you’d surely come in and have breakfast, but Claire saw you leave out the front doors, so I thought I had missed my chance. I suppose, that drove me a bit crazy.”
might be the only time she’ll get a chance to, since Lawrence isn’t teeming with any other fancy parties for them to attend. Once they were introduced, Dean was pretty quiet, but then he spotted the beautiful old Indian motorcycle that Dorothy had rode in on, and soon enough, they were both geeking out over engines and custom finishes mixed with original parts. Afterwards, he proudly showed off his baby, a 1967 Chevy Impala, and Dorothy was drooling before he even popped the hood—and after that, he had to admit, she was a pretty cool chick. But no matter how cool she is, it doesn’t mean he wants to watch her and Charlie swapping spit right in the middle of his office.
“If you hire me, sir—I would not take any aspect of the job, lightly. I would be dedicated to ensuring that your brother is safe in any situation. I would be on high alert and always on the lookout for potential threats. No one would make it past me … not without takin’ one hell of a beating first. I can promise you that. If they’re a threat, then the threat will be eliminated.”
. Reese McCanton was another model, always nipping at Sammy’s heels during every fashion show and photoshoot. If people actually do have arch nemesis in real life—Reeese would be Sam’s, at least ... he was in Dean’s opinion. Sam doesn’t really seem too bothered by the guy, but something about him rubs Dean the wrong way. He quickly looks over and sees Reese coming out from the crowd—apparently he had ducked past the barriers to go sign some autographs, judging by the sharpie in his hand.
The girl scowls at him, but it lessens as she notes Dean and Cas’s fingers intertwined.  “Mhm … you bet we will.”
Dean groggily pulls his gaze to the lanky young man who’s ripping the empty glass from his fingers. The guy sorta reminds him of
Castiel continues to scan his eyes across the body before him, seeming altogether un-phased by this heated invitation. “I doubt you truly mean
Jack smiles, glancing down at the table while staying quiet for a moment. “You know” he says finally, eyes shining amber in the yellow lights of the kitchen, “it’s funny—he just asked me the exact same thing.”
Dean shrugs. “Not usually … not unless it’s gonna be useful for me to open my big mouth.” He huffs and looks around the small, empty diner, feeling oddly safe here, and he’s glad for it. “But like I said … you’re nice, and that’s kinda rare these days.”
much. And not the cheap kind either! None of the chalky crap! You better be getting me Toblerone or Ghirardelli. I want the good shit that melts as soon as it hits the tastebuds!”
Dean doesn’t remind Charlie that Shakespeare has been  required reading in most schools since the early sixties—he’ll  just let her have her moment, considering out of the two of them,
Castiel’s eyes are wide. His heart is in his throat and he feels like he could both vomit and faint all at once. “I’m sorry” he rasps, still trying to whisper, but he barely has any breath left in his lungs. “I’m so, so sorry.” He quickly picks up one of the bottles and hands it to Magda before shuffling past her and bolting out the door.
The breeze picks up, warm and sweet—just like how his mother’s arms felt when they wrapped him in a hug.
So, Dean does what he knows how to do—he fights, he wins, and he prepares himself to lose… lose another friend, lose
emotions, that was the angel’s life, the angel’s accomplishment, and Dean suddenly just feels very lucky to have been a part of it. He sighs into the steam of his coffee. “He loved me” he whispers to himself, weighed down with the new finality. He
With a soft smile,  Castiel closes his eyes.  "Every time..." he whispers,  almost reverently, as if this is something he's cherished for a long while, "every time you saw me,  you'd pause.  You'd look around ... and then,  you'd stare directly into me. You'd stare like you could see every detail that made me up.  No matter where I was centered,  or how high I was above you—your eyes tracked me down in an instant."
Sam huffs and then turns fully to Dean in the booth, making the small space feel even tighter. “Seriously, Dean. Don’t crash that wedding—Cas said that he was taking this woman there as a friend, and you should trust him.”
He gags, but manages to swallow down the majority, still convulsing wildly on the waves of his own orgasm the entire time. It’s a blur after that—he remembers Castiel bending down to kiss him, and wipe the remnants of his release off the side of Dean’s cheek.
“What was the option?” Dean is genuinely curious now, caring less and less about how he’s coming off, and more about what Castiel has to say.
Dean swallows thickly, immediately spinning back to step over his brother’s lanky body as it sprawls across the hallway. “Sorry, Sammy … but you’ll be alright” he mutters, finally dashing into his room to get the lube from his drawer. He briefly looks at the condoms in the box sitting beside the bottle, but then realizes that there’s probably no venereal diseases that can be transmitted from an angel to a human—if anything, Cas’s cock will probably make him explode into a pink mist or something, and no amount of rubber will save him from
“Not necessarily. I don’t enjoy putting people in situations that scare them so thoroughly. It is not my idea of a good time.”
“Dean …” Sam finally mutters, so soft, Dean barely heard him over his own breathing. “Don’t die too.”
“Because they’re always what you died in!” Dean spits, tears building in his eyes. “Damn near every time I saw you get killed, you were in that fucking trench coat! It was either covered in your blood or in black goo, or
Castiel narrows his eyes at the girl as she leaves his office, but as soon as she does, his face sags with remorse. Again, she could be right. This might be Castiel’s only chance to see if there are any good feelings still there. If there aren’t—if Dean really does hate him for how Cas ended their relationship, then he’ll be gone by Monday anyway and things will just go back to the way they were before; but if Dean
, that much is certain, and Dean won’t know what it is until he gets in there and starts assessing the damage—but his stomach aches on
Even when he was just a name on a screen, Dean has to admit—the drama was exciting. Yeah, he was pissed as hell that someone was hurting his precious bound babies, but it was also thrilling to go on a quest to figure out who it was and why.
Soon, Bobby is chiming in too. “Yeah—that don’t sound like a good idea to me, kid … why would you put that in the boy’s head?” he’s asking Susan a second later.
Drop it in that slot and make my fuckin’ day! I can’t wait to see the look on your face when I bust outta here and catch your smarmy ass mid-run!”
hour of morning? Scaring an old woman half to death? Was this your idea of a joke? A prank? I would think someone in your position and at your age would have outgrown such foolishness, but apparently, I am very wrong!”
…” Dean yelps, finally thinking enough to throw his hands over his raging erection and back away from the other man. “Sorry—shit, I’m sorry … that’s not … it’s not what you think. I’m just—”
The lawyer leans back even more, but he remains calm. This is probably not the first outburst he’s witnessed and it certainly won’t be the last. “Mr. Winchester … I am not making any such assumption; but your uncle had no living blood relatives. He obviously saw
“I did it with Anna that one time. Oh, and that Amazon chick. I thought she was a human at the time though.”
.” He brushes the side of Dean’s hand once more before gently taking it into his own. “And although I knew there was no chance that you'd ever be interested in me— I still wanted to see you one more time, because I thought that maybe—
Dean looks over at his baby brother, a little surprised by the offer, but he’s touched all the same. “Really?”
Dean hangs his head as guilt begins to flood his veins. “I’m so sorry, Cas … I should’ve known. I should’ve seen it! I should’ve seen how fucked up he was! I could’ve—”
“And you don’t remember what he looked like, or even checking these things out to him in the first place?”
The man in his arms glances away while biting his lip—inevitably weighing the pros and cons of each possible answer, and Castiel feels his insides begin to melt as he waits. He didn’t know how much he wanted this, missed this,
sorry. But neither thing would work on this dude. He was a fucking weirdo! It’s like—it’s like he didn’t even think there was a problem. Like, it seemed as though he thought
Protecting Sammy has always been Dean’s number one priority. He protected him from the monster under his bed, that mean neighbor’s cat who always tried to eat his pet lizard, and Donny Hascum in eighth grade, who once told Sam that he would end up being homeless because their dad couldn’t afford to buy them the latest Nikes. Donny was obviously not the brightest bulb, so Dean didn’t feel too bad when he punched his lights out. Anyway, if Sam was scared of it or hurt by it, Dean would be there to protect him from it—that’s what big brothers do; but he never could’ve imagined it’d one day turn into a paying job.
Castiel gawks at him, knowing that Dean is waiting for him to speak, but he finds that he’s actually scared to.
Dean chuckles, reaching out to tug on the angel’s trench coat. “Yeah, man. I mean—I’m all for a signature look, but like … you
He walks through the automatic doors of the office supply store—bright pink post-it blazing in his hand. The words on it are written in a heavy ink, scrawled through multiple times, indented in the paper and underlined with force—the physical representation of Charlie’s seething rage.
Dean gawks at the guy, wondering where the hell he gets the nerve to be so callous. “Look, I—” but then he spots it, the book that the other man is holding … at least, it
“Oh c’mon, Cas! Don’t be embarrassed! It was a cute story—and now that I’ve seen the guy, I don’t blame you. The dude is hot!”
Dean is practically choking now on the thrumming and thumping in his neck, and there’s sweat pilling all down the ridge of his spine. He nods again.
It’s amazing. It’s amazing that Dean can fuck this up time and time again—say the wrong things, do the wrong things, be basically an awful human being, and Castiel still doesn’t completely give up on him. “Why?” The question falls out of his mouth like a dead-thing, motionless and unfeeling.
“He’s changing” Dean says softly, feeling his cheeks burn because he knows that Sam is going to read too much into this.
”  Charlie yelps. “Now go out there, check out the damn book to the guy and ask for the money up front, considering it’s pretty much
“In any case, may I check out the book, or should I go to the other side of town to east county library?”
; however, that would only reflect poorly on Dean, who is innocent in all this. And if the treatment
“I love you too, Cas. I’m sorry I didn’t say it that day. I should’ve—I shouldn’t have let you go without telling you.”
The girl snorts in amusement before giving him a squeeze and then standing upright once more. “Gah, Dean—you’re such a prude. Just because you don’t like vaginas doesn’t mean you’ll die from hearing about them. Besides,
“Look … I’m sorry, okay? Y-you were right … I made all the wrong decisions and then … I was too stupid to learn from them. I’m … I’m a fuck up.” Dean’s unsteady legs manage to step just a little closer as he continues to speak. “And even though that’s the main reason why I wanted to …
Castiel just waives her off as she backs out of his office, but the pain in his chest remains long after her and her words have faded from the room.
“Wait …” Claire hums, stepping closer and looking her adopted father up and down, and the truth may as well be written all over his face. “That was
“Oh, I’m Dean—Dean Winchester.” Dean shakes Hoss’s hand and then Helen’s, before looking shyly back at his phone.
It’s dumb that he’s drawing nothing but blanks right now—and the longer he sits here, the more likely it is that Castiel will notice something is up (if he hasn’t already) and come back to ask Dean what’s wrong.
Dean snorts, but he seems to understand Castiel’s disbelief. “Yeah—turns out, I’m pretty good at writing down all my snarky opinions in a way that people want to read.”
to you. I enjoy listening to the filth that spills from it” Castiel chuckles wickedly, still stroking Dean’s cock up and down.
“I'm sorry” he finally huffs, embarrassed that he's losing it right, in front of this woman— a perfect stranger.
” Dean is skidding to the floor in an instant, pulling the old man up—but his body is heavy in Dean’s arms. His eyes are closed … his chest isn’t rising. “Bobby?” Dean cries out again, gently laying the man back down so that he can start pushing his palms against the center of his chest. He doesn’t know proper first aid,
Castiel’s shape instantly softens, but his eyes are still angry. “Yes … yes, I need to remain calm.” He then looks back at the squirrel and Dean follows his gaze—only, as soon as he looks down at it, the squirrel and Castiel are both
“Happy birthday, kid,” Dean says, spreading his arms wide. Cas and Sam echo the sentiment, all three of them watching attentively as Jack examines the scene before him. Jack takes a second to process, and then a brilliant smile erupts across his face, so full of surprise and joy that Dean feels something clench tightly in his own chest.
“No,” Cas confirms, shaking his head. “Their shells aren’t removable. I don’t know why the stuffed shell isn’t attached to the stuffed turtle’s back.”
Jack hums in contentment and flips the page of his activity book. Dean pulls out of the garage and uses the button to shut it behind them. Town isn’t too busy as they drive through, but Dean waves at Marta from the post office as they pass her on her route and Christopher from the community center, too. Once they merge onto the highway, Dean grips the wheel with his left hand and lightly rests his right on Cas’ thigh.
“It wasn’t forty minutes,” Dean argues out of habit, but now that he thinks about it, he’s really not sure. Whatever. Sam can suck it. He lowers his voice and asks, “You put all the presents in the car?”
in realization. On top of the cooktop is a pan of what were apparently supposed to be cinnamon rolls but are instead eight balls of completely charred dough.
Dean gestures to the rest of the group’s bears: Sam’s Snoopy in a pilot costume; Eileen’s bunny in scrubs and a medical mask; and Claire’s skunk in, worrisomely, a devil costume—horns, tail, pitchfork, the whole nine yards.
Under where the sweatpants had been, Dean discovers a black leather wallet. He pauses, glancing at the nightstand, where the wallet Dean picked up for Cas at the Lebanon General Store rests next to Cas’ phone and alarm clock.
Cas doesn’t answer, and Dean knows him well enough to recognize when there’s something he doesn’t want to say—for fear it’ll make Dean angry, or sometimes sad. Dean’s not sure which one Cas thinks it’s going to be this time.
Dean holds his hand for balance as he steps down onto the floor, and they don’t untangle their fingers until they’re in the kitchen and Dean accidentally burns his tongue trying to tear open the hot bag of freshly-popped popcorn with his teeth.
Dean can hear the shower running as he passes the bathroom on the way to the kitchen, which means Sam has been up long enough to leave for and return from one of his morning jogs. Disgusting. Dean can’t believe he’s related to that freak, honestly.
“Was thinking earlier,” Dean explains. “Kinda pointless for you to have all your stuff in another room when you just sleep here every night. Figured we could—you know. Make it official. Move in together. Whaddaya think?”
two, in case they get distracted. They carry the hanging clothes over together, and then they crack open the dresser drawers. Apparently, no one ever taught Cas the normal human way to organize his room, so half of the dresser is full of random junk instead of actual clothes.
“Did you know you can make your own Toothless at Build-A-Bear?” Jack asks during one of the scenes where the dragon’s soaring through the air. Dean’ll never admit it out loud, but it takes
The first thing Dean does once he flicks the kitchen lights on is start the coffee maker. He turns the stove on and gathers all the necessary pans and ingredients while he waits for it to heat up. The pancake mix is nothing special—just the cheap, off-brand box from the grocery store—and it doesn’t take more than a minute or two to stir in the bowl. He pours a few circles of batter onto the griddle and starts in on the eggs. Jack likes them scrambled, which is easy enough. Dean flips the pancakes over and fetches two mugs from the cabinet, filling them both almost to the brim with hot coffee—one black and the other with a stupid amount of cream and exactly one and a half sugar cubes. Then he moves the finished pancakes onto a platter, pours another round onto the griddle, and heads back to his bedroom, cream-and-sugar-monstrosity in hand.
“I’m serious,” Jody continues, turning her glare towards Dean now. “I better not hear a single one of you call this stuffed horse Jody.”
Dean holds both hands up in surrender, while Donna descends into undignified giggles. Jody gestures to the paddle brush Dean still has clutched in his grip.
“This one would be good every time you think about Crowley,” she says, handing him a grey t-shirt that reads
After, Dean dries off and passes his towel to Cas, who has a tendency to forget to come prepared with his own. Dean pulls on his boxers and jeans, admiring the view as Cas runs the towel through his hair and down his body before wrapping it semi-securely around his waist so as not to scar the rest of their family on his trek back to his bedroom. He gives Dean another kiss before he goes, and it’s a testament to how much Dean loves their son that he pulls back before they get carried away again. Once Cas is gone, Dean brushes his teeth, puts on some deodorant, and pulls his henley over his head. He stops by his own room to lace up his boots and unplug his phone from the charger. He’s got emails from Build-A-Bear and the bakery, confirming both the party and the cake. They should be just about good to go.
Plus, if I have to hear Dean swoon about that guy’s eyes one more damn time, I’ll lose my appetite.”
But Dean can’t look at him now. He can’t smile or play this off, so he stares at his boots where they hold him in place, and he lets the only emotion he’s comfortable with, take him over. “It’s not a fucking joke, Cas! Don’t you ever—
Castiel—in the ways he wanted to know Francis. He wanted to ask him questions and debate things with him. He wanted to challenge his point of view on things and then,
Dean watches him go just a little too closely, and Sam has to slap him in the back of the head before he finally can tear his eyes away. “Ow! Jeez! What was that for?”
They ended up at the small bar in the corner of the restaurant that has wrap around windows giving them a panoramic view of all the planes landing and taking off over the corn fields. It’s actually really peaceful—and the fact that they’re the only ones in the place besides the wait staff and the bartender doesn’t hurt either.
“Well that ain’t right” Dean grumbles, sitting himself down while picking up a menu. “A lady as beautiful as
“No—but the thought of you sticking your fist in a cow’s—” Dean couldn’t finish because he began laughing again.
The dimples in Dean’s cheeks give him all that and then some. “But I gotta admit, you offer some really strange perks.”
. I didn’t really like myself for wanting it at first, because … well, you’re an angel, and you were just wearing some poor guy’s meat suit—”
, don’t do this!” With another second of helpless fumbling, Dean finally thinks to pull his phone from his pocket and dial 911. The phone seems to ring forever.
“Woah—wait, Cas. Hold on.” Dean is reaching out and pulling him back down before Castiel can even get his foot off the bed. “I didn’t mean … look, yeah, okay, sex with randos at some highway bar doesn’t matter to me. That’s exactly why I do it, because it doesn’t matter, so I can haul ass outta there with no regrets.”
The last thing he remembers from the night before was stopping for gas. He was just standing there waiting for the pump to click, yawning and dreading the drive ahead— but then everything got foggy ...
. It’ll talk to Castiel, keep him company. It’ll let Cas know that Dean was here, and that he’ll be back soon to visit, not to worry. He’s not alone … never alone.
Dean stops just outside of Castiel’s bedroom door and then gestures inside, waiting for the angel to round the corner and take a look.
right,” he grits under his breath, and then burps, bile and uncertainty rising through his throat in one, toxic lump. He quickly swallows it back down and avoids Justin’s gaze.
Lynn’s own tears rim her eyes, but she wipes them away before wheeling around and grabbing the burger from the pass-through window. She quickly shoos the cook away as he peeks through the opening at the two of them. “Go on, Hank! Make up that cherry pie … we’re gonna need it.”
“Thank you, Cas” Dean gravels, feeling half dead and blissful. “Thank you for not blowing me up with your dick.”
goofy and immature, Cas wondered how he ever passed the second grade, yet he could still turn around and quote Tolstoy and Maya Angelou and make some of those most deep, thoughtful comments on life and love and politics …
“I guess that’s me” Claire chimes in, shocking Castiel as he whips around to see the girl stand up beside him. The DJ jogs over to hand her the microphone, which she takes shakily, already turning red as she scans the large room.
“Sorry ‘bout that, hun” Lynn whispers, pulling up in front of Dean once more so she can place the plate in front of him.
“Then why don’t you see him more? Family’s important, boy. You never know when they’ll be gone so you got to cherish the time you have.”
He looks back at Claire who is blinking at him pathetically, awaiting her punishment for the mistake she made, and Cas knows that she still deserves one, but part of him wants to forget it all and just wrap the girl in a hug; but he steels himself and moves along—knowing that right now, he needs to be the parent that Jimmy would want him to be.
Castiel swallows thickly, understanding Dean’s hesitation, but it doesn’t make it hurt any less—although, he figures he deserves a little hurt after all that he’s caused. “But … do you
The whole reason he came back here was to be around the one person he felt closest to in this world, and then he went and basically told that person that he means nothing to him.
As third dates go, this was the first and the best one that Dean has ever been on. He supposes the other guys he’s dated gave him more than three dates, but only shallow assholes could really classify them like that. Dates should be planned, exciting, something to look forward to … not just saying “your place or mine?” before an eventual, rough fuck. Castiel thinks of dates the same way Dean does, and their last two are evidence of that; even though their second date was cut short by Charlie. All the computers went down in the library, so Dean had to go back to work to help her manually get through the rest of the Saturday rush. Before her call though, he and Cas were heading to the driving range at the edge of town. Even though Dean hates golf, and Cas has never tried it before—they both still agreed that whacking the crap out of some tiny balls sounded like fun. And it
Castiel tilts his head to the side as he looks over Dean’s face, obviously trying to figure out what game he’s playing. “Well, no … it wasn’t fine, Dean. You know that.”
They all chuckle and then gather back into the booth—Sam switching sides to slide in next to Dean, while Bobby and Susan cozy up right across from them.
“Take your time” the man says coolly, and the depth of his voice shoots through Castiel the exact same way it did back in college, giving him goosebumps all up and down his arms while making his knees shake.
It’s been eight hours since he started driving with that old wooden box riding shotgun; but this time, the driver didn’t get to pick the soundtrack for the trip. It has been silence the whole way, only broken by Dean’s sporadic cries and the crashing of his fist against the steering wheel.
Dean nods slowly and begins to shuffle away. He hears one the other caterers ask if they should help Dean find it, but the one who told him where to go says “Nah—let the drunken redneck figure it out for himself.” Dean damn near drops the act to go back and sock the dude in the nose, but he does
It’s true, he did stupidly turn the conversation down this road, but that doesn’t mean he can’t turn it right back around again. “Whatever, just go and do what ya need to do, and feel free to
, it’s the state’s library but as long as he keeps the place above water, the state doesn’t really care about it much. So, Dean considers it
“But …” Sam adds on, unfolding from himself before putting his hand on the knob of the door, “just remember—things might get complicated if you end up sleeping with him.”
—this is my job. I don’t mind it at all” she’ll say, but Dean will just shake his head and continue sweeping or mopping, or emptying the trash … anything to help her out.
” Dean mutters to himself, looking Castiel up and down over and over again. His shoulders are broad and his thighs are thick and muscly. His arms look toned and tan beneath the rolled up sleeves of that white button up shirt. And now that Dean’s thinking about it, the first two buttons on that shirt were undone, exposing a rather delicious bit of collarbone. Blue eyes, dark hair, pink, pink lips—if this guy wasn’t such an asshole, he’d be straight out of Dean’s wet dreams.
Dean rolls his eyes again. “Yeah well—after watching a scary cat lady wield scissors at your little brother just so she can cut off some of his hair, you become more inclined to be thorough.”
“Who’s that?” Sam asks, looking a bit scared now that their secluded little bubble of hurt might get popped prematurely.
The three of them laugh louder and louder, until their sides hurt and they’re all wiping tears from their eyes, and for the first time in at least a few weeks, Dean isn’t angry anymore.
“Exactly! Remember when you first found out about Cas? You stalked the guy and then nearly punched him in the face!”
. He’s not a child. Plus, if we did that, he might pull out his angel blade or something. None of us do well with surprises.”
Castiel only stares at Dean, eyes stern and cold—but eventually, a warmth swills through them and a light smirk tugs at the corner of his lip. “Are you saying, you will be the book’s bodyguard?” he asks, taking one half step closer to the counter, closer to
is one of those girls who shows up late everywhere. Dean grimaces—he doesn’t like this chick. He knows he has no real reason to, but he
” Charlie cries, equal parts surprised and horrified, judging by the squeak in her voice. “I would’ve noticed
not. And I know that you hate it when he eats all the food in the house and then tries to blame me for it … but still, he’s a good guy none the less.”
, crashing into the very palm of his hand. “I can maybe ease something’s pain—like I did with that bird just now; but
Dean smiles to himself, suddenly remembering the way Castiel’s lips felt on his, and for a moment—it doesn’t seem like he would ever need anything more in his life. “And he did …” Dean blushes, looking around the library for a second to make sure no one else is listening, even though it’s early and they haven’t even opened the doors yet, “he did turn down that hot bartender because—well, he said that he wanted to see if I was interested first.”
"Oh,thank-"she flew away from me before I could finish thanking her. Man,those friggin angels were all work and no play.
I know that it has been awhile since you have heard from hell (aside from empty threat letters) but I assure you this is not a threat letter. I, for one am tired of all this fighting. To be honest I don't even really know what we are fighting about.
"It's worse than you think. He sings all day he taunts us. tells us disgusting sex stories of him and his dead lover. Makes you go a little crazy."
"If you're a demon that's not so long" he spots me in the back of the room and rolls his eyes at me to show his annoyance and shortening patience
"I thought you would be angry with me" he whispers. I give him a little peck on the lips and put my hand up to his cheeks and he rests his hands on my wrists
"Oh hey, I wanted to give you, your present in private but turns out that me and dad are leaving first thing tomorrow morning so I guess now is good." He takes my hand and pulls me to a corner and hands me two box's .
I can't form proper sentences so I just push past Gabriel and run into my room to try and compose myself
"But what about kids? Their are both male. I know for a fact that male demons can't get pregnant"John said
I hear the door open and I see dean walk in. I run to him and wrap my arms around him and bury my head in the crook of his neck. I feel his arms wrap around me returning the embrace.
"Really bro? You tattled on me? What are you six?" I didn't even look up from my book to acknowledge him
I lay down on my bed. I start to really come to terms with my fate.I start to cry quietly for a few minutes before it turns into full blown sobbing. That night I cried myself to sleep, But trying to enjoy the last night that I have in my home ,in my own room, in my own bed before I am sharing it with a demon.
"Oh please dean I'm old but I'm not clueless, anyways you can't put if not getting to know him forever and sex is a way to move things along"
"Looks like it's time for you to go" I look over and I see dean walking towards us. I sigh and I pull Gabe in for one last hug.
"How dare you waste my time with this bullshit. I have more important matters to do than sit around and listen to this. I don't handle jobs so if you have a problem take it up with your boss,not your king. dismissed" the man walks out with a stubborn look on his face.
"In my head. He tends to do that to annoy you." I looked at him confusingly. "He likes to get in your head and bother you. like he will take form of some one else and make it seem like a real conversation but in reality it's all in your head. It makes you go crazy after awhile and ruins a lot of relationships "
Lucifer was unhappy and he wanted more than what was in heaven. So he went down to earth and met a women named Kelly Kline. they fell in love and had even had a kid. But one day when lucifer was out shopping his family had been killed by demons. Lucifer went crazy, he had went on a killing spree. he had killed demons,4 humans and even angels. Eventually dad had to lock him up. He is now in the cage in hell.
"Your right I'm not going to touch you, I'm just here for your body. I want to make an example out of you. Dean is going to do the fun part" Gabriel winks at me. He puts hand on alistair's shoulder and pushes him down the the ground hard. I point the gun at his head.
I got up and went to my bathroom to my bathroom to turn on the shower. While I waited for the water to warm up I walk  over to my closet. I pull out a red dress shirt and black dress pants and lay them on my bed. Then I jump in the shower.
"Other than listening to your...interesting conversations. I wanted to inspect the cage. Which one of you knows the most about it?"   They both looked at eachother
" Well, well. If it isn't dean winchester. I hear that voice and I immediately feel dread. there is only one person whose voice is that disgusting
"Mr. Winchester. Dean and I have been married for a month. We barely know each other. Just give us sometime to bond and get to know each other before we throw a child into this." I say in a very calm tone.
"How are you doing your father announced the date of the wedding to the kingdom. I'm sure that this is hard for you." Charlie says in a sympathetic tone.
"I don't know this is overwhelming for me. I don't know why we have to have a kid so fast. I mean I'm still one myself" I try to hold my tears back
When I get out of the shower I realize that I have no clothes except for my nightgown and my robe. So I dry myself off and put on my robe and make my way to dean and I's room.
"Listen dean you don't want to do this" Alistair says. Here comes the begging. I've heard this before many, many , many times. It's all the same 'you don't have the guts', 'you don't want to do this', or the classic 'this isn't you' it's all the same at the end of the day.
" whatever. at least let me help you clean up. we have lunch soon and you can't go looking like you just murdered some one." he starts walking to the bathroom and I follow him. I sit down on the toilet seat and I see Cas take out a wash cloth and some alcohol
"Oh my fuck" I gasped. It hurt like hell  if I'm being honest. I've read that it can be uncomfortable for the receiving  side but that was a little bit of an understatement. I mean it's not like dean is small because he is definitely well endowed.
"Dad! We just met last week I don't even know that much about him. I'm not ready to have sex with him yet" he scoffed and rolled his eyes at me.
"It was an arrangement if winchester married an angel then the war between heaven and hell would end. " lucifer laughed
I stand at the alter for a few seconds. While I was staring off into space I hear music start to play. I look up and I see the doors open
"I mean, I guess I could manage if you married me off to another angel, hell I could mange and lower class demon,but the prince of hell, dean freaking Winchester!"
"Are you ok?" He asks. I move my hands to the back of his neck and play with the short hairs that lie there.
"That's not our place dean" I clench my fist but then the meaning behind what he just said dawned on me
"Yeah, but we hung out yesterday and the day before and many other days" I move over to sit on a stool that was on the side
I checked myself in the mirror one last time to make sure that I looked good. I mean I wanted looked god for chuck it's not every day that you meet the king of heaven for the first time. I just wanted to make a good impression.
"I don't want to fight. There is no point in doing so. We are stuck with each other we might as well be civil and kind to each other." I wrap my arms around him and put my face in his hair and I inhale deeply. His hair smells like honey-suckle.
I walk into the throne room to see my dad talking to a commoner obviously bored of whatever his is saying
"Um, you can put it right by the closet."  he nods and walks over to the closet and puts his stuff down
This war between heaven and hell has been going on for as long as I can remember and trust me that's a long time. I don't even really know how it all started .Whenever I asked my father he would just say"Those fluffy winged dick heads thought that they were better than us and now we are trying to put them in their place." ,and he would say that in a harsh tone that I took the hint and backed off.
"Ha...that's a good joke Sammy I didn't think you had it in you to joke like that." I said wiping a happy tear from my eye.
"My brother is in the cage and he paid me a visit today and I wanted to see if it was normal for him to have his powers" My jaw dropped.
"I know it's great. I can hear myself think. He hasn't really spoken today other than a couple words here and there."
"Huh. I guess that what isolation does to a person."  Before belphegor can say something back a voice speaks
I moan softly as he bring his tongue to trace along bottom lip as a silent way to ask for entrance. I open my mouth and his tongue darts in my mouth and tangles with mine. I move my hands up to the bottom of his hairline and pull a little at the hairs there and I hear dean moan a little bit. Dean grips my hips and puts me on his lap.
"Well I am going to meet with John Winchester to see if there is anything we could do to stop this war."
I fall asleep thinking about dean. I don't really know him and some part of me wants to get to know him, but there is also this part of me that doesn't, and that part of me keeps reminding me that I am being forced to be here. I am here as a band aid. I am merely a solution to the problem of the war.
" First off, that is no excuse to cheat. Second of you never asked me to help you 'satisfy your needs' I'm not a mind reader dean, if you need or want something. Be a big boy and use your words"
"Believe it or not some people don't believe in heaven?" he cocks a brow at me and does his famous head tilt
" It's 6:45" When Gabriel says that my eyes widen and I scurry out of bed and I hurry over to the closet and I grab my navy blue dress shirt and black dress pants.
"I don't give a rats ass what you think. Lower rank demons are flaky that's why they have guard duty. If we lose one or two demons there are many more" He looks me in the eye
"19!? Dad, he is just a kid not to mention that he is an royal angel so he will totally have a stick up his ass"
I walk into Cas and I room at around 2:00 in the morning. I don't see Cas in the bed sleeping, Which is weird considering how when I usually come home around 12:00. He is usually knocked out with a book right next to him.
"there is nothing we can do" He smiles sadly at me. I sigh and put my head in my hand. I feel a hand on my back  I look up and over at dean. Put's his hand on my head and moves it so it lays on his shoulders
"Dean, I'm old but not clueless. I know how you come in and out of the castle late at night, looking like a wreck I might add. I'm just suprised he hasn't called you out on your shit sooner" I look at him with wide eyes and my gaping mouth
While I was waking down the aisle I found it harder to move, harder to breathe. I guess my brother notice because he squeezed my arm. I was walking down the aisle with my dad on one side and Gabriel on the other. I was still mad at my dad for doing this to me but I wanted to be with him because I don't know when the next time I see him will be.
"All due respect your majesty what are you doing down here?" The guard with the bald head said. I think his name is Gerald.
" I don't know little words here and there like 'Cassie, soon, team, together' Something like that I don't really pay attention" Cassie that name sounds familiar. I have I slept with a cassie before?
"You are a criminal, a murderer. All those demons, angels, even human are dead because of you and your lack of self control. I had friends who died trying to take you down. Friends who you killed. You may be my brother but you are not my family!" for a split second there is a look on his face that I can't place. It's a look between regret and sadness. Then his eyes flash red and he looks at me with anger
"It's all good. I'm sorry for my behavior last night as well as also not saying some not so-nice things" He starts walking towards his side of the bed.
I put my book down and got out of bed. I was walking to the throne room when I started thinking about why he wanted to see me .Did I do something wrong? Is giving me bad news? Oh no what if he was dying or worse what if he got someone pregnant? What if he found out about the million dollar vase I broke in the library. If that's the case ill just blame Gabe.
He gets up a walks over to the closet and takes of his shirt to put on his sleeping shirt. I stare at his back. I watch as his back muscles flex as he is taking of his shirt and moving to put a new one on. I would be lying if I said I didn't think dean was attractive, because he is very attractive.
"Don't play dumb dean, it's time for you and castiel to consummate your marriage"  I raised my eyebrows in surprise
"You can't harm me it's against the law, it would make the whole marriage treaty void and restart the war" Gabriel leans down looking him in the eyes
I can't hold back the tears that are streaming down my face. I run out of the room crying when I bump into Gabriel he stops me
"No. He didn't do anything nor am I on anything. I'm just in a good mood. Is that so bad?" He start to study me. Which is odd because I feel like I'm under a microscope. He then gasps and points at me
Then the priest turned to me  " do you Castiel Shurley of heaven take Dean Winchester to have and to hold and to be true and faithful til death you part." I felt a tear run down my cheek. I looked around the room and I saw all eyes on me . I looked at my father who nodded his head sadly
"Dean. I'm gonna-"  he buries his head in the crook of my neck and thrust faster and faster. I can feel him losing control in his thrust.
"Or what? You gonna fight me?" Alastair chuckles and then his expression turn into slight fear. I look over to sam and I see he has a shiny looking pistol
"I don't know Chuck I mean I told Dean that he would never have to worry about me marrying him off"He said in a concerned tone
"Yeah coincidence. Maybe lucifer got into their heads and drove them a little coco" I look back down at the papers that I was reading before cas came in.
I examine the room. there is a king size bed with red sheets and red pillows. The room was painted white. There was a desk in the corner of the room. I assume for deans work. There is a door one one side of the room that leads to a closet and another that leads to a bathroom. I look around the room and walk over to the bed, I lie down on the bed and I look over to to the clock on the wall and it reads 5:00. I have some time to kill, so I close my eyes and rest my head on the pillow.
"Prince Winchester, How can I be of service" Crowley comes in with a rag. I can only assume was for wiping his hands of blood.
"-Marrying me off" I cut him and he nods" You didn't think that I deserved a say in this? I'm a big boy I should get a say in who the hell I get to marry!"
I walk back to my room. When I get to my room, I go to my closet and take out my suitcases and I start to put clothes in there. While I was packing my thoughts started to wander.
I wake up with a huge headache. Which I can only assume is from me getting drunk. Then I remember why I got drunk. I was just about to wallow in my thought when I heard a knock at my door.
"I'm Castiel" I said as I shook his hand. When I told him my name I saw a hint of recognition in his eyes.
"Oh so now your not ready to have sex? Says the guy who lost his virginity at 15 years old" when he said that my eyes widened in surprise
"Yeah well, there were a lot of people at the party and may I say some people were getting down and dirty right there in the crowd so that's why." I can literally see his face change from neutral to angry.
" You two are adults. And you always knew that there would be a time were you had to produce an heir, The only change is that you don't get to choose who you have an heir with"  I could see deans cheeks turning red. He opens his mouth to say something but I put my hand on his arm to stop him
"I was looking for Cas so I could give him this book on gardening because he wanted to plant some flowers. I was walking to where he asked me to meet him and when I couldn't find him I called his name. About 10 seconds later I hear him call to me for help then a couple seconds later a pained yelp coming from the green house. I ran into the greenhouse and I saw alastair strandling cas from behind.I pulled him off of Cas and he stood up to face me. I told him to get out then he said 'or what you gonna fight me' I pulled out my gun and I told him to leave and he did then-"
Sam nods and makes his way to the garage, presumably stopping to pick up Jack and Eileen on his way. Dean continues down the hall until he reaches Cas’ room. The door is cracked, and Dean pushes it open to find Cas sitting on the edge of his bed, bent over at the waist and tying his shoes. Truthfully, Cas doesn’t spend a lot of time in his bedroom. He sleeps with Dean every night—has since he got back from the Empty—and during the day he’s usually gardening with Jack or reading in silent companionship with Sam or watching movies in the Dean Cave with, you know, Dean. He keeps his clothes in the closet and some of his accumulated possessions on the desk, but Dean doesn’t see why he can’t clear some hanger space and a drawer or two to make space in his own room. And besides, his room has that cool ledge above the bed—the perfect place for a few of Cas’ smaller potted plants and the various rocks Jack has collected and carefully placed into Cas’ palm at the end of an adventure. Dean doesn’t see why they don’t make it official and just—move in together. Maybe he’ll bring it up when they get back this evening. For now…
“Uhhhh,” Dean fumbles. He looks to Cas for help, but Cas is just staring blankly at him, head tilted to the side in confusion, a perfect mirror of Jack. Christ. Dean will never get over how alike they look. Somehow, he manages to come up with: “Grown up stuff.”
“How’s it hanging, old man?” Claire asks once she arrives at the bathtub, two bears in hand—Cas’ turtle and what looks to be a skunk.
when Jack’s mix finishes. As they get closer to the Oak View Mall in Omaha, Cas pulls up Google maps on his phone and gives Dean soft-spoken directions from the passenger seat.
Before Dean can respond, something happens on the screen that makes both Cas and Jack gasp. Dean whips his head back around to look at the TV.
Claire pauses in the middle of the room. Dean stands up and goes to the bookshelf, grabbing the photo album from the shelf he’d set it on earlier in the evening in anticipation for her visit.
Cas looks up, gaze flitting between Dean’s face and his monkey. He’s got that eyebrow wrinkle again, his mouth turned down in a confused frown.
“Thank you,” he says in his most sincere tone. “These will be nice to have on hand whenever I get sick of Han Solo.”
Jack rushes off, bumping into Cas in the doorway. He wishes Cas good morning—receiving only a grunt in return—and then speeds down the hallway towards Sammy’s room. For a moment, Dean hopes Jack doesn’t accidentally walk in on anything inappropriate, but he’s not worried enough to go burst through Sammy’s door himself. Instead, he focuses his attention on Cas. His pajama pants are dragging beneath his feet as he slides across the floor, and he has one of Dean’s hoodies zipped most of the way up over his bare chest. He collapses inelegantly in a chair next to Claire.
“Forgot what my mom looked like ‘till I was like, twenty-six,” he hears himself say before he’s even finished thinking it.
Dean lifts the top off the cake box, revealing the image-laden, rainbow monstrosity within. Jack’s going to love it. The bakery provided them with a large wax candle in the shape of a 4, and Sam sticks it in the cake, making sure not to ruin any of the pictures or letters, and then he uses his lighter to light it. Donna has Jody’s phone in hand, though Dean’s not sure if she’s taking photos or video.
Jack measures the ingredients three times each just to be safe and stirs the mixture in the bowl carefully, so nothing splashes over the sides.
“Thanks, buddy,” Dean says, finally breaking eye contact with Claire to accept the blaster from Jack. He slides the tiny wrist strap up his monkey’s arm. “You wanna help me with this?”
Jack is the only one who actually responds—“Bears!”—but everyone makes their way inside the store, where an employee is waiting to greet them. She looks somewhat taken aback, which Dean can’t really blame her for. For all that Jack is four years old, he still looks like he’s about to pack up and move away to college. Dean comes to stand behind Jack, placing his hands on his shoulders and presenting him to the girl.
Dean turns to look at her and finds she’s already looking up at him, eyes glassy and bottom lip wobbling. He’s about to open his mouth to say something, anything, he has no idea what exactly, just something to keep Claire from looking as lost and lonely as she does right now, when they’re interrupted by Jody and Donna.
Dean considers it. There’s still stuff to move from Cas’ room into Dean’s, but it’s not like they have anything else to do tomorrow. “Yeah,” he decides. “This thing’s pretty much done. It Eileen’s turn?”
And, well. She’s not the only one. Dean drops the almost-argument for now and starts unpacking his bag. Jack sits at the center of one of the wooden benches, with Cas on one side and Claire on the other, patiently waiting for everything to be set up. Jody scoots the cake box in front of the birthday boy, and Sam passes soda around the table.
“You done?” Dean asks Claire. She fidgets, biting her lip and looking anywhere but him, and then she nods.
