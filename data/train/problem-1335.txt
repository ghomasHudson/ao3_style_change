“There we are,” Mycroft said, patting Sherlock’s kneecap. “Here,” he said, offering a hand which was begrudgingly taken. He pulled Sherlock to his feet, steadying him in front of the vanity. “Brush your teeth—it’ll make you feel better.”
However, John was quickly becoming the center of his thoughts, and even Sherlock couldn’t hope to stop it.
I give Ella a look, causing her to merely shrug and scribble something in her little black book. I swear I see the word '
Earlier was...
However, the one thing she doesn't expect is to see the Freak and his lapdog at the snack table, looking pointedly at the dance floor with growing bouts of laughter.
I glance to the skull atop the fireplace mantle, hollow eye sockets peering back at me. It may just be a figment of my own imagination, but it's like he's waggling his nonexistent eyebrows;
"Coffee?" I turn back to him at the offer, examining the genuine crinkles around his eyes;
"No...haven't been too tired," I respond, tapping my fingers impatiently against the table. I really just want to be alone, where it's safe, with myself, the only person I know, for sure, that I can trust. I wish Mrs. Hudson would move faster.
God why don't you two just elope already?
He then strode away, closing the bathroom door gently on his way out. Sherlock immediately sank to the floor and bowed his head in his hands.
"There," Sherlock pronounces, returning to John's outstretched arms. "If you don't have as good a grasp at dancing as you do with killing," Mycroft sees the soldier flinch, and he does so wish Sherlock could be a bit less insensitive,"then I will have to lead."
A hiss in response. "The tray fell over; it wasn't my fault!"
"Oh, and Mum?" I call behind her retreating form. She turns her head around and quirks an eyebrow at me before walking closer.
For good measure, he upended the syringe and flicked the barrel gently, then tapped raptly at his arm in order to coax his veins into view; the old track marks were a fine enough indication, but he was too impatient to be able to deal with a missed vein at the moment. He pumped his left arm up and down, clenching and unclenching his fist in an even greater attempt at enticing the veins into view. Needle positioned, poised just above the most prominent vein, Sherlock bit his lip in equal parts anticipation and dread. With practiced precision, he aimed the needle and pricked it gently into the exposed vein. Globules of blood curled inside the barrel and, without further ado, Sherlock pressed down the plunger.
"No need to fret, brother dear. I'm sure you'll find your John eventually."
"What is my name?" He gestures to himself, and I shift uncomfortably when his elbow brushes against mine.
long time.
“Come, I’ll call a cab,” he said.
Defeated, I push past her and plop onto her floral couch, messing with the teared cushion beside where I'm seated as she sits down in the chair across from me.
"Second," I state, plopping onto the couch after placing him on the floor. "No bodily functions inside the house; those are reserved for when I must walk you." Abruptly, he tries leaping into my lap, just like Red-
Hmmm, it's curious, the predicament I'm in, looking up soulmates on my laptop when the last time I've done that was when I was 7. I just can't seem to get John out of my head, now that his name is branded on my wrist in this peculiar "blue" color. I was tempted to give up this whole soulmate nonsense before, after I thought I was never going to get one, but now that I've found that I, indeed, have one, I can't get my Mind Palace in order. It's rather frustrating.
it was John’s—familiar touch.
me. You’ve just been so bloody quiet. You won’t tell me what’s wrong, but something obviously is.”
"If you insist on calling me that, then yes, I am," he confirms, letting his arms fall to his sides. I feel the need to pull at my hair as Mycroft silently smirks at Lestrade's assertiveness, usually nonexistent.
I scream as Bill pulls another shard from my skin, placing it again on the tray beside me. I squint at it, and there are so many I don't feel like counting.
The lean man looks less subdued as he walks forward almost eagerly, taking my mobile in hand. "I can tell your brother's drinking habits and sham marriage from this phone," he states, then gesturing to me, continues,"as well as I can tell you're an army doctor from your demeanor and tan."
"Your point being?" I reply petulantly, placing my violin on my chair. Crossing my arms and turning my nose up, I glare down at the DI, using my height to my advantage. Lestrade puffs up his cheeks and huffs before stepping closer, which is decidedly not a good thing.
“I really must be going,” said Sherlock, starting towards the stairs, waving to Klaas as he went. The coke still sent a pleasant murmur through his veins, tangled low and warm in his belly. No need to spoil the coke high thinking about the unattainable pleasure of smack.
, they both said.
21 February 13:52
love you, that much I meant, but...not in the way you love me.”
Sherlock had hoped John could slyly reinsert himself into the narrative of their life together, that the transition would be easy and carefree, like their interactions used to be. Of course, as per usual, Sherlock was denied simple pleasures.
"You're keeping the 'mutt', as you call him, and that's final," he says calmly, gesticulating at the dog. I narrow my eyes, raking my gaze over the cage before studying Lestrade's face, wrinkled in anger; he doesn't understand.
I remember I used to always converse with Mycroft about soulmate markings, and I'd always be sure to ask if he finally got his. That was when I cared significantly about finding my "Other Half", and now, I haven't even bothered to remember his partner's name. Abruptly, I realize I'm curious about his soulmate, even though I seem to have deleted their mention from my Mind Palace. I guess, now that I know I have a soulmate, and I'm not one of those few, shunned upon outcasts who don't have a marking, I've reinvested myself in the world of soul mates.
Sherlock started frantically grappling onto the bathroom vanity and looked himself over in the mirror. Track marks and scabs encircled his arms, which he yanked his sleeves over. The Stericup clattered as he practically threw the damn thing into the vanity cabinet, then shoved the filter and syringe baggie which he had thrown into the waste bin down further into the can, in hopes that John wouldn’t see it.
“I was in NA and everything, at one point,” said Sherlock with a little scoff. He patted his inside coat pocket and removed a yellow envelope. “12 step program, weekly meetings, relapse prevention plans—the whole shebang.”
-lated..." Her breath hitches audibly, and I can see her figure etched into my vision. She's sitting in my desk chair, sobbing into her palms. I blink slowly.
"I'd just like to...can I leave?" My legs are practically aching to pace, even with the burden of a cane everywhere I go. I see it leaned against the side of Ella's desk.
"Thumbs and toes," I respond, pulling at the seam of the chair, still pushing into Mycroft; he won't get up. He's making my chest tight, like a coil ready to be sprung.
John hummed in response. He padded into the kitchen, presumably to make a cup of tea.
Sherlock still woke up early in the morning and sat in the living room with John and Rosie, quieted by things unspoken and an awkwardness which had never existed before his own death. John still left for the clinic, and always brought Rosie with him to go to Molly’s or Mrs. Hudson’s. Sherlock would still immediately shoot up in the bathroom with the instruments Mycroft had given him, then usually pass out either on the loo or the ratty sofa. He would still awaken feeling worse than when he had fallen asleep, mouth dry and eyes puffy, quivering and alone. He would still seldom eat or drink—instead he angrily scratched notes on his violin and filled up his time with fleeting fantasies.
Oh you DARLINGS! The stories are adorable and the mental images are adorable and I wish I was there to see such absolute indicators of true love! Ah you two are such soul mates! Ted and I wish you both the best with a big group hug! Xxxxxxxx
Publically insulting my kissing skills? I apologize for my lack of knowledge in this area, 'Three Continents Watson'.
"Bloody Mary, yes?" I question triumphantly. She glances up to me, her face pinched up like she's been smelling something particularly awful. It kind of reminds me of Mycroft's smug face, and I barely register the way my fists clench at the thought of him.
It's only then that he notices the pair are pressed flush together, John pinned against the wall. There are merely a few inches between their lips, and Lestrade suddenly wishes Sally had brought the phone in.
He returned moments later, questioning still evident on his face. “You feelin’ alright?” he inquired, gesturing at Sherlock’s prone form and the swaddle of blankets. “You look a bit peaky. Have you eaten yet?” he said.
Suddenly, I wish there was a red thread though; at least I'd be able to see the color. I wonder...
“How much for an eight ball?” said Sherlock.
I smirk as he finishes drying the glass and opens a cabinet, placing it inside. I wait for him to come out from behind the bar and grab his own coat. Then, we both stride out of the pub, and I pull out my key to lock the door as I say,"See you on that next case, Lestrade."
I give her a smile; not a pained one, or a crooked one, but a genuine one. It's small, and my muscles twitch at the stretch of my lips when I feel so drained of energy, but it's real, and I actually feel reassured.
what I did to you.”
"Sherlock...have you...
I realized that I couldn't imagine any of it while I was standing there, letting the spray wash over me, and I felt disappointed; I
“No,” he mumbled, shaking his head. He still couldn’t exactly pinpoint why it had seemed imperative he come here. “I...I wanted to see you.” He surprised himself with his own honesty. “And to apologize.”
them.
He had always wanted, hadn’t he—before Mary and Rosie? God, he had wanted so badly to reach out his quivering hands and run them reverentially over John’s face, to breathe his name like a prayer.
"Oh, God, yes," Sherlock murmurs, neither caring nor asking why he felt the need to exclaim the name of a deity he has never once prayed to. In this moment, nothing else but the expression on John's face could ever matter.
it is they have." My arm snakes up into a toast, as do the audiences before I finally say,"May their relationship prosper, as it is written that soulmates complete each other. Let us hope that Mycroft would drop his cakes and pastries and God awful umbrella for Lestrade, even though I firmly doubt it."
I was sure Donovan and Anderson had tried warning him away. More than anything, I was surprised by their instinctual suspicion of me: they were shite at their jobs in every regard, yet they were the only ones that got the “creep vibe” from me. The
“Greg,” corrected John.
"Now, I wouldn't suggest you meet him if I didn't think you could handle it, but I just want to warn you that he might- well,
"Hmmm...decent layout. Mantle; good place for a skull. Practical chair, facing the window, but in the middle of the flat;
That's good enough for Sherlock.
Almost immediately, I hear the loud, characteristic whistle of the kettle, and Mrs. Hudson hums as she opens the fridge to scour for milk. I merely remain seated as she pulls out the carton and sits it on the counter, grabbing two mugs from the cabinet.
..." She exits the closet, jar of sugar and tea in hand as she glances curiously at me.
Squeezing a dollop into my hand, I roughly rake my hands through my disheveled hair. The white foam smells cheap, but it still smells good enough for me as I inhale deeply and turn to get the body wash.
," I tisk, pulling on his arm, to which he levels me with an almost glare. "I would like to know a bit about you first, since you almost knew my whole life in a glance."
"Why?" she sneers, chancing a glance at the 'dynamic duo'. The Freak has a sour look on his face from the glass of punch held in his hand, and the doctor chuckles warmly at him. She frowns again; this isn't, can't be right. Their relationship can't be like this: he's supposed to be a psychopath.
Greg doesn't say anything back, and it's only when she sees where he's looking that she realizes exactly why almost every sound in the room has suddenly fizzled away.
"O-oxford stree-t...hurry. They're saying th-ere's too mu-much bleeding to save him...I want y-you to see him be-fore he goes..." I don't respond. l clamor to my desk chair; I can't stand to look at the babe anymore.
Then, my thoughts morph into ones of my family; Mum, Dad, Harry. I remember I have a photo hidden in my nightstand, and I lift up from my bed, pulling the drawer open. I scour the whole confinement before triumphantly pulling the picture out and shutting the drawer.
Only being able to see color after meeting a particular person was more like a fairy tale than anything else. It seemed to defy all conceivable logic. How could the cones of the eye simply not work until in the presence of someone else? How did one’s body manage to intrinsically detect one’s “other half”, as if one’s counterpart had actually once been grafted to one like an extension of the body?
OMG! You guys are such a couple!
It had been a time since the derisive looks of the sober had been directed at him. Then again, he supposed he would always face this problem, of being isolated from the sober.
I nod in understanding as I swiftly transfer to the man beside her, my eyes scanning quickly up and down his form. Ah; he's a whiskey man.
“Okay,” Sherlock conceded, slowly, rattled and confused. His shaking hands came up to rest against his chest. “But really it’s—“
This wasn’t fair, thought Sherlock petulantly.
...," I smile through the tears, and suddenly, she gives up. I see her face drain of any fight at the whining tone of my voice, and, I admit, I don't like the way it sounds much either.
He took a pebble from the little lake surrounding the property, one like the very same which he and Victor always skipped along the lake’s surface, and threw it at Victor’s bedroom window.
Harry, do you always have to inject your two cents?
“No,” Sherlock said, searching for something in John’s eyes, but not knowing exactly what he was searching for—perhaps for what had changed John’s mind, what had urged him to make Sherlock tea for the first time since he’d moved back in. He relinquished John’s arm after a moment. “No, everything’s under control.” That was his mantra—if he thought it often enough, perhaps it would become the truth.
"Met any new people?" she asks, her eyes trained back on mine. I inhale sharply, glancing to the window before looking back at her.
"What color was it?" I continue, shifting slightly to avoid crumbles of dirt, deciding to ignore her use of the nickname 'dear', again.
"Uggh...it's Mycroft
“What an absolute twat,” John said, approaching me from behind. “I’m surprised
Christ, he thought, cradling his head in his hands. Everything was fucked.
Her jaw tensed in distress, but she seemed somehow relieved. “I hope he sees you one day,” she said earnestly, staring Sherlock directly in his eyes. “I...I know how you feel, and I never want you to feel that way. I hope John gets his head out of his arse soon.”
? How did he manage to return to sobriety, however tentatively, after each relapse? How had he managed to get clean in the first place?
I groggily reach for my bedside table and pull out an outfit for the day, cradling it in my arms. I sigh, turning to see my "roommates" still lounging lazily on their cots and snoring softly. I shake my head fondly, my feet pattering against the floor as I make my way to the barracks for a shave and a shower. My hair has grown...unruly since my recent deployment; it's really been bothering me.
John’s response to this was much different from yesterday. “I
“Okay,” Sherlock always said, hiding the dejectedness behind his popped collar. John never looked anyway, or at least not long enough to catch the lonely, desperate look. Not enough to see the
I glare at the font, suddenly annoyed at it for forming such frustratingly true sentences at my brother's insistence. Next thing I know, my BlackBerry has been flung across the room, and apparently I can't catch a break because the characteristic message indicator still chimes.
“Nothing,” Sherlock snapped. “
"But-But weren't you married?" I chuckle vaguely, awkwardly, trying to lighten the mood, just a little.
It was obvious he was fingering a pocket knife in his jacket pocket. Sherlock, despite the immediate realization, somehow felt totally detached. The man posed a threat—surely he would actually stab someone if he felt cornered—but Sherlock felt only a startling impatience to get false pleasantries out of the way and get on with business.
considered safe and understandable. If Mother could explain blue to me scientifically, she would.
I'd really appreciate any feedback, criticism, suggestions, questions, anything, honestly.
. Sherlock nodded.
21 February 12:51
The back of a hand was pressed to his forehead. “You’re warm,” John said, voice noticeably soft. He pulled at Sherlock’s hand again, shifting him so his legs were hooked over the front of the couch. “Here.” He gestured at the cuffs of Sherlock’s pants before tugging gently at the bottom of each leg, pulling them down until Sherlock was in nothing more than boxers and socks. The soaked pants were placed in the same pile as the shirt. “Go up and take a hot shower. I’ll clean up the mess.”
“Listen, when I…” He seemed to be warring with some great affliction. “When I hurt you, at the hospital—“
He stumbled blearily into the direction of the bathroom, which he had still somehow remembered the location of despite he hadn’t entered this den in over a decade. It was amazing how the brain chose certain things to remember.
had never seemed like one of his roles. John had been grieving, and Sherlock was, after all, without fail, a difficult person. That’s what everyone said.
Mrs. Hudson strides over to where I'm sitting, placing one mug of tea gently beside my right hand. The steam wafts up from the cup, ghosting over my face as I smile at her. People have told me I have two kinds of smiles: ones that meet my eyes, and others that almost do. This is one of the real ones, where my eyes crinkle at the corners.
Also, my writing style has changed considerably in these last two years. That’s why I deem it more acceptable to completely discontinue this version of Two Halves of the Same Whole and completely overhaul it. The first chapter of the rewrite has already been posted under the same title if anyone is interested.
Lighten up, mate. Seems like you need some capitals in your life.
John meets an old friend and chats with him over a cup of coffee. As this friend leads him to what he's yet to realize is the epitome of his life, he ponders on destiny, on how he got to this moment and that everything he did makes him up. Then, he meets the person he has no idea is his person.
I lean back against the sofa, trying to conform my buzzing thoughts, but it's proving to be more difficult to reign over my mind now than usual. I tap my forehead repeatedly, annoyed. Then, I answer truthfully:
Sherlock tried to remove John’s presence with the same sheer force of will it might have taken to conjure it. Yet John still stayed stubbornly rooted to his side, hands always touching, words always tender.
I suppose most of my thoughts always end up back on the subject of color, but I just can't get it out of my head.
Mrs Turner would like to know if you boys want some biscuits.

“You seem quiet,” Victor said. “Are you alright? Aren’t you excited?”
They smile slightly at the nickname, and although it may sound a bit harsh, they've been around me long enough to know it's just part of the way I show affection.
Eventually, after having grown tired of trying to tease apart his intrigue from his conscious, he instead honed in with surgeon-like precision on his deepest thoughts. Memories of his mother resurfaced—moments long passed, from when he must have been only a toddler. His mother had told him stories of soulmates. It was all probably highly romanticized accounts, seeing as his mother, at least upon gaining colored vision, only seemed to look at the world through rose-tinted glasses. She talked of immediate connections between soulmates; soul-sucking intimacy; and most especially that vaguely familiar but also strangely unsettling sensation one has upon seeing someone one’s surely met before, but can’t seem to recall from where.
I debate on whether to tell her the truth or not, but I suspect she'll know that I'm lying: she
Even if Sherlock and John never talked about anything warm, never gazed at each other like they used to, never went on cases, never got mistaken for a couple—which somehow stung just as deeply as everything else—it had to be okay. Sherlock had grown, over many years, very adept at hiding his own feelings. It’s not that he didn’t experience any, as his peers had taunted, but that he found it was excruciating to ever let his full breadth of feeling exist. He tucked his emotions into a dark back room of his Mind Palace.
"Do you make good tea?" I give him a side-long glance, but he just shrugs. "Just a general, curious question. I can't deduce everything." He turns again to the microscope.
"Nonsense; you're too lethargic for all of that." I swiftly turn to Mycroft's smug face, his eyes glinting with some wry form of humor I don't find amusing nor tolerable.
There are a few things Sally expects tonight- loud, probably obnoxious music- terrible punch and stale gingerbreadmen- nosy questions and idle gossip- a heavy supply of lights and mistletoe- maybe even a few employees shagging in the toilets. The Met Christmas party is nearly the same every year, and she sure as hell doesn't know why she keeps coming.
"Uh, er...yeah?" he mumbles, hands abruptly reverting back to their cleaning motions. I stare intently at him from the corner of my eye, catching the way his jaw is clenched and his mouth is terse. I admit, I'm not the best at emotions, but I can tell he's uncomfortable.
, Mycroft!"
"By the way, is it Afghanistan or Iraq? The tanline doesn't say everything." He smiles broadly, but it doesn't seem to reach his eyes all the way; there's only a pit of feeling there. It seems to morph, though, as his eyes glance to me again. The modicum of feeling suddenly looks larger, but only for a second before it's gone.
mind.
wrong of me.”
It's Mycroft. He's opposite me, ridiculous umbrella still in hand.
No Captain, or Watson; just
“Steady now,” said Mycroft, hands on either of Sherlock’s shoulders. He gently pried the toothbrush from Sherlock’s quivering hands, rinsing it and putting it back in its cup. He said nothing further, merely guided his brother out of the bathroom and towards the sofa. He pushed him down into the cushions, silencing the protests with hushing, as if dealing with a child. “Stay here. I’m fetching you some water and a bowl in case you have another...accident.”
"Come back at 11," I whisper, and he nods before lifting up from his stool and starting for the door.
I wince slightly as they shrug me onto the soft cotton of the stretcher, my shoulder bouncing painfully. The four of them, one woman and three men, look apologetic as they continue to move my sensitive body.
It was heavenly.
The man smiled toothily. “Name’s Andre. I’ll take you to him.”
"Although, the one thing I find odd is that he spies on me all the time, so he must've known your name a long time ago, even if you didn't know his. So; why would he avoid you for so long, if he knew you might be his soulmate?"
Another time we had been chasing a criminal downtown, and seeing as I'm not as young as I used to be, I was very out of breath once the police had finally intercepted him. The git thought it good to snog me when I could barely inhale, not to mention his mouth was covered by his scarf, so I received a full mouth of fabric.
I smile. "I've gotten used to it," I say simply, and he accepts what I'm saying, then, he's walking to the showers.
Sherlock ignored how John’s visit seemed to be borne only from necessity rather than desire; how John had only turned to Sherlock’s company as a last resort; how when Rosie seemed to toddle, John didn’t trust him to watch her; how nothing seemed to be the same; how his best friend had managed to slip through his fingers like water; how whenever he thought of their relationship in the past, the present one seemed like some miserable approximation in comparison—some parody of it, taunting, jeering.
He opened the window, stifled momentarily by the brightness of the sun. It had no alternative but to shine, Sherlock thought. It wasn’t to blame.
Donovan can't help but snort. "What could he possibly need help with? Not his ego, that's for-" She pauses at the tense line of his jaw and simply forgets the rest of her sentence. "What kind of help does he need?" she repeats instead.
She rushes me, wrapping her arms around my torso and shoving her head in the crook of my neck. I freeze momentarily, contemplating what she's just said, but I don't know how to continue. It was so easy to just deny that I was gay, but I can't deny it anymore, not with...
Before Sherlock could bite back a scathing reply about his actual
“Sherlock,” said Klaas, voice oddly reverent. “A pleasure to see you again. Where’ve you been? It’s been a while.”
John yells back a curt yes as she opens her door and starts for the kitchen. Taking a small sip of her tea, she flicks through the refrigerator, scouring for the unopened carton of milk she swore she had.
"Where's the Freak? Got a call from a...Mycroft Holmes?" Donovan covers the phone speaker as she says, quieter,"I didn't know Holmes had a brother. Probably a twat, as well."
“That’s good,” said Sherlock gently, though his smile faltered. “Only the best for such a smart cookie.”
“For being a huge arsehole,” he said, smiling tightly, a rigid laugh escaping him. Her expression seemed to sadden, which made his smile, already tense and hesitant, fall away. “For not treating you the way you deserve; what I asked of you on the phone…I knew how painful that was for you.” A sigh wrenched itself from his throat. “I
Sherlock couldn’t hope to sleep the remainder of the night. John’s words and touch still lingered like a permanent brand, as if they had been seared into his soul. Hopes and wanting flared in his chest, fanned by the dawning possibility that, perhaps, John didn’t hate him. Perhaps he wasn’t actually such a bad influence on his best friend after all.
Even Mycroft's already gone color.
Anthea’s expression sobered. “He worries for you. Constantly.” At that, Sherlock had nothing to say. The silence stretched for several moments before she nodded, then began to walk away. Sherlock watched her duck into Mycroft’s black car; watched it pull away from the kerb with a rising feeling of dread, realization, and overwhelming nausea.
“Take it,” said Mycroft, pressing the book into Sherlock’s shaking hands. “All of John Watson’s therapy sessions—recorded in this journal.” Sherlock's eyebrows climbed into his hair, even though he wasn’t surprised by the admission—had come to the same conclusion when he first saw the book. “There’s information from his last several sessions in here that I think you may find...most interesting.”
John rubbed a hand over his haggard face. “I wasn’t planning on it...unless you wanted me to?”
So we lay, and we don't talk.
He couldn’t help the unfair swell of disappointment in his chest. The name was common, but Sherlock could only hope it wasn’t a reflection of his partner’s overall character. After all, soulmates were supposedly perfect for one another. Someone dull would not do for someone like Sherlock.
Mycroft returned to find Sherlock rolling around on the couch. He deposited the glass of water on the end table, along with a small pack of saltines to help settle his stomach. He also placed the promised bowl on the floor next to the couch, then surprisingly sat himself on the coffee table across from Sherlock.
"Easiest, fastest way to wake them. Breakfast is soon, and I wasn't going to wait up for them if they were still asleep," I reply, glancing to Bill's agreeing face. He nods slightly as he finally finishes tying his shoe laces and I sit back down on my bed. I lean back onto my pillow, continuing,"If you don't mind, while they're all not here, I'd like to get some peace and quiet."
"Aw, have a heart, Sherlock; he just wants to play," the DI guffaws, Mycroft placing a hand over his shoulder. As I ardently try to escape the dog's path, I spot the two of them darting out of the door, and I hear the subsequent clack of their shoes as they descend the staircase.
"Yes, well, I thought I could settle for him, but I suppose I couldn't, considering neither of us ever saw colors and now, well, you've killed him," she says, rather bluntly, smiling slightly despite the way she's averting her sad gaze. I'm not entirely sure how to comfort her.
She doesn't smile.
I lift up from my bed with a groan, stretching my back as I turn to look at my clock.
John’s expression softened. A breathy laugh exited his throat. “Thank you,” he said, sounding sincere. His voice was touched with gratitude and warmth, and sounded hauntingly like John’s voice once had when he and John had lived together once, without Mary, without Rosie, and without grief. “I don’t have much furniture, but I’m bringing a child into this now.” His expression became gravely serious, as if he expected Sherlock not to know the situation’s gravitas without some physical manifestation of it. “Will that be alright with you?”
Of course, all that work and effort and Sherlock had still managed to relapse several times throughout his acquaintanceship with John. He hadn’t resorted to the use of heroin again, not since just before those first NA meetings, but he had used morphine and cocaine, even a bit of speed. John had found him a few of the times—he’d gotten angry, disappointed. Sherlock was a difficult person after all. It was a miracle John had managed to tolerate him so long.
I wince, glimpsing the writing on my wrist. The name's clear in the sunlight, but my eyes dart away quickly. I clasp my hands together in my lap.
his body, which recently seemed to constantly be contradicting him, convulsed. He scrambled to the toilet and dry heaved, throat stinging with the stomach acid lurching from his throat. No food came up sans for some biscuits he had eaten several hours ago. The bile coated every inch of his mouth and throat—made him want to cut out his tongue, scrub his mouth clean, pull out his teeth with pliers. All that would somehow be less uncomfortable.
Woohoo! Out within less than two weeks of the last chapter!
"John?" she says firmly, now taking my face in her palms, ignoring my slight flinch away. "Did you get your marking?" she asks, and I can't help but think it's a dumb question
consider you my family. I thought I had made that astoundingly clear.”
There John Watson is, roving back and forth between Baker Street and Speedy's, and suddenly Sherlock wants to ignore this altogether. Yet this light feeling in his stomach makes him wait with bated breath until finally, the doctor enters through the door.
At least Lestrade has the courtesy to refrain from mentioning anything color-related around me, even when I'm probably an arse to him a fair share of the time we spend together. He only rarely slips up and points out how particulary beautiful the sky looks or accidently forgets I can't see in color.
Sherlock opened the car door as if to put a barrier between himself and John, as if the action could act as a buffer to prevent an argument from arising. He looked at John, rigid in his seat, strategically avoiding his gaze. His whole anatomy collectively screamed his discomfort. Sherlock wondered when John had started being reserved with him, when his best friend had begun keeping secrets, holding grudges, refraining from praising him. Was it fair of him to wonder any of that at all?
“She’s going right downstairs,” said John, already grabbing her diaper bag from the sofa and his coat from the rack by the door. His voice held an air of offense at Sherlock’s comment, as if he had taken it as an implication that he was a bad father—which, Sherlock thought, was the furthest thing from the truth. “Mrs. Hudson watches her all the time. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m gonna be late.”
"Your...your f-
“All of it.”
“If I’ve been short with you lately, it’s not something you’ve done wrong. I’m trying to deal with my demons, as they say.”
Surprisingly, Gladstone remains asleep despite Mrs. Hudson's shout. Trying not to startle him, I place him by my feet and step over him softly as I get up; it's probably better for both of us that he doesn't wake up just yet.
"Alright," I sigh, clapping my hands together. "Mrs. Hudson will have to watch you, and...I'll have to figure out a name later," I assert, wrapping my scarf around my neck.
“Okay,” said John, impatience creeping into his voice. “What’s the matter? You’re on edge—you’ve practically paced a hole into the carpet.”
"You better have my drink, then," he says jokingly, pushing the glass door open.
Something treacherous was about to leave his lips—something like,
He lit a cigarette, inhaling and expelling curling tendrils of smoke from the window. He watched as the smoke dispelled into the sky, as he flicked ash onto the rotting floorboards beneath his feet. Reveling in the pleasant burning of the smoke, he took another drag and blew out a long, satisfying puff. An onlooker on the kerb below caught his attention, narrowed beady eyes at him with disapproval akin to that of a parent towards a child who had snuck out, then continued on his way with an indignant shuffle. Sherlock watched him amble away with a startling amount of steel, finding that some sort of defensiveness had swathed over him, as if he felt the need to take arms against anyone who disapproved of his lifestyle.
Something ached deeply inside Sherlock’s chest. “You’re always welcome here,” said Sherlock.
shade of forest green,” she said offhandedly, with a certain amount of wistfulness choking her voice.
"Hold on, just breathe," he supplies, gripping my arm. I jerk away, and I don't want to, but I'm wound up and-
Mike continues to walk down the corridor, and I follow closely behind, examining signs and instruments hanging along the walls. My shoes make a clunky tapping noise against the blinding white tiles, but his are even louder ahead of mine, heavily echoing inside the hallway as he finally brings me to a door.
"No; it was
I sense the pounding boots more than hear them as I'm drowned by Stanley's shadow. I feel a sudden cold rush over me again, and the pliers being dug back into my flesh doesn't help.
"Why, that scarf you always wear is blue," she admits, gesturing to the scarf around my neck. I glance down at it for a moment just to see a rich hue of gray wrapped around my neck. No blue, just gray, and suddenly I'm aggitated at the fact that colors simply can't be described. You can say that the ocean is blue, but what is blue? How do you describe blue to someone like me, who's never seen anything other then black, gray, and white?
of such a confession. “It means a lot to hear you say that.”
Then again, John’s mistrust wasn’t so unjustified. After all, he
Sherlock buried himself under a bundle of covers which had been resting on the top of the sofa. His nose was running and his stomach felt knotty. It was agony to sit still, so he repeatedly tossed and turned, trying and failing to find a comfortable position.
"I have a soulmate."
"I could kiss you if you like," John whispers, anxiously fisting his too-big jumper which Sherlock has such a fond weakness for, but that bias is ridiculous and stupid and he will never, ever use the word 'adorable' to describe his counterpart, ever. A grin stretches over his tanned face, a hesitant pull of lips.
And yet you got them anyway.
He nods faintly as he asks,"How do ya get up so early, John?" His words are slurred with sleep as he grabs an outfit from his nightstand and makes his way to the hallway.
25 years of being alive, and I
“Come on,” Sherlock muttered, setting a cigarette filter in the spoon, then sucking the solution into the syringe. He held it needle-up, flicking the barrel to dispel any air from the instrument.
, thought Sherlock, though something like guilt seemed to sour the idea. He shifted as one would subconsciously in their slumber, letting his hand curl slightly over John’s extended arm.
"What's your sibling after, Harry, yes? The issue is money, isn't it?" he inquires, cocking his head like a cunning animal. His eyes peek down at my mouth oddly, and it's only then that I realize my jaw has literally dropped; I try to compose myself.
He smirks, which is utterly unacceptable in Sherlock's flat, especially since the British Government has already tainted the sanctity of his blogger's chair. "And you aren't wise enough to accept the advice of a man who cares for you and the chaos of the lifestyle you have chosen?" Another dainty, slow, painfully satisfied sip, yet Sherlock remains silent.
He glances at me as he goes and turns on the sink, rinsing and cleansing his mug as he replies,"Wow; you actually remembered my name."
Sherlock could almost picture the disapproving frown in John’s voice when he said: “You’re getting too thin again.” A finger prodded at a protruding rib through his paper thin shirt. “You’re looking quite pale too.”
smack? Not since he’d gotten clean—rather, since Lestrade had forced him into NA.
"Did you ever "go color", to use a colloquial term?"
, and I feel choked and my eyes are stinging still.
"Morning, Bill," I respond, finally finished putting on my shoes. He smiles at me as he rolls over and yawns, rubbing at his squinty eyes. "Might want to wake the rest up soon," I say, gesturing to the rest of the barrack's filled beds.
“Sir, are you sure?” The cabbie stopped at the light and glanced furtively back, voice slightly trembling. “You don’t look so—“
He set his silver spoon, which he had grabbed before leaving Baker Street, on the kitchen sink. He then took a one gram baggie and tapped it gently, grains of white powder sprinkling into the spoon like a funnel. Once just enough was settled, he pulled a water bottle—another item which he had brought from home—out of his pocket and swirled some into the powder, crushing up the larger lumps. He then took the lighter from his pocket and ignited a flame just below the spoon. Fire licked and danced around the already blackened metal, waving about in a circular motion. After several lingering, almost agonizing seconds, the solution began to boil as it grew hot. He removed the heat source and dropped a cigarette filter into the solution; he promptly stuck the needle into the filter and sucked the cocaine solution into the syringe.
! You've known for
Sherlock nodded, for ultimately it was John’s decision to continue with such things. He couldn’t deny that some of the tension drained from his shoulders, that something warm and affectionate flowered in his stomach at the news that John had started an endeavor wanting to better himself—that when he was disappearing off to somewhere that he wasn’t doing so out of hatred, but out of...love? Whether the apology was due or not, it felt nice to receive it—it meant that John still cared for him, deep down, that maybe their relationship wasn’t so irreparable as he had once thought.
"Ah, Sherlock...you need to take better care of yourself," she mutters sadly. "Have you at least been sleeping better?" she continues, spooning the loose tea into the pair of mugs.
He cried and tried to delude himself into thinking he was okay.
Suddenly, I'm genuinely glad Mrs. Hudson is taking the time to make me tea.
"No, sadly, I won't see the last of you until you're dead," I sigh, mocking dismay as I splay my hand over my chest. "Such a tragic, depressing life I will live without your presence."
Sherlock shakes his head momentarily, then gestures to John's chair. "Be my guest," he welcomes, walking over to sit in his own chair. With what seems to be a grateful nod, he slowly sinks into his cushion, letting out a sigh that Sherlock recognizes as his 'keep going' sigh.
: We kissed today.
He disappears down the hallway as I get up from my cot and press the alarm button on my clock. I turn the volume knob all the way up before slapping my hands over my ears and sitting back down on my bed.
He looks incredulously at me for a moment before his face softens in an odd way. The tightness of his jaw disperses, and the expression on his face oddly reminds me of one Mrs. Hudson has given me before.
I examined the wounds; there were twenty eight in total. They all ranged anywhere from seven to fifteen centimeters in length. Some were located on the scapula and deltoid muscles, others on the abdomen, yet more on the arms and hands, and even across the face. Whoever did this was involved: this was personal.
Mycroft smirked, much more himself now that the most worrying of Sherlock’s behavior had passed. “I beg to differ,” he said, crossing his legs and gesturing to Sherlock’s prone form: he looked like a bedridden child with a mother who had waited on him hand-and-foot.
Before Sherlock could seethe at Mycroft’s invasion of his privacy, or for scaring him half to death—which was a very uncommon thing indeed—his brother proffered a little book. It had a latch that buttoned on the front and was leather bound and small, able to fit in an inner coat pocket or convenient place. The spine was becoming torn and flimsy while the pages were evidently yellowing from age. There, along the spine, it had John Watson’s signature inscripted, carved into the leather. Sherlock stared down at it in awed silence.
"Well, I don't want to call it 'relationship help', but...relationship help," he grins, glancing at the Freak and his sidekick pointing at other Yarders dispersed around the open room. "Figured the mistletoe hanging everywhere could be useful to him and John."
Inhale, exhale; I need to tamp my urges down. I can't cry;
"We're leavin', Cap'n." Bill's voice is so relieved, so overtly happy as he calls,"Get the stretcher over hear! Gun shot wound to the left shoulder; shattered fragments have been removed!"
"How did you-?" I look to Mike, words dying in my throat and sticking to the back. "You told him about me?" I'm trying to understand because no normal person has ever done this or would ever attempt to.
them,” John said with a wince.
I cant my head to see the livid and clammy face of the man from before, a snarl curling his lips. I grimace at him, but I comply after a moment, bound to conform to his requests if I wish to receive a paycheck at the end of the week.
Awh, this post is so lovely!
His counterpart makes a thoughtful hum in his throat. "Simply fit the puzzle pieces together." He shuffles, smoothing his suit down in a way that reminds Sherlock of the expression 'ruffled feathers'. "Obvious mutual attraction. You notice the signs in everyone else."
“Why are you here?” she said, voice edged with steel—or as much as she could muster when her expression betrayed her hope and curiosity.
lying, wasn’t feigning, or inquiring in the way people sometimes do just to be polite.
Mrs. Hudson seemed scandalized. “Now don’t say that!” she said, swatting at his shoulder. “John’s only a bit overprotective is all—rightfully so. After what happened with Mary being dishonest, and all that other nonsense, I can’t say I blame him.”
Mum and Dad had no idea, Sherlock thought as he twirled his spaghetti. Of course, neither did he—not gender, nor name, nor location, nor personality, nor
"What were you even doing with the stuff?" Another snarl of pain.
21 February 14:35
"I'd like to see my new bedroom, now, if you don't mind," I murmur. She seems reluctant to say or do anything, but she nods eventually, ambling back to the kettle.
I turn my alarm clock off as I shout,"Good morning, sleeping beauties!" None of them smile at me as one glares daggers and some others cross their arms. I smile mischievously as I scratch the back of my neck in mock embarrassment. "Oh, sorry; did I do that?"
Like now, for instance, peering at the live feed of the CCTV cameras perched in his brother and Dr. Watson's flat. Some may call it snooping, but Mycroft prefers the more formal 'eavesdropping' as a pleasant alternative. Either way, he certainly won't deny that he does, indeed, snoop on his brother dear.
The sound is soft, carries across the floor and up the stairs and breaches a barrier so familiarly fitted that Sherlock can't breathe. He feels the need to respond, even if it's something scathing, but his throat is incredibly dry.
to care about the term of endearment right now. I nod faintly, slowly falling back down onto my chair.
He lasted less than two hours. Before long, his curiosity had taken hold of his legs, carrying him to his father’s tiny library downstairs. Fueled by childish wonder and an almost desperate sense of longing for something which he had no name, he unearthed every book he could find about soulmates. He researched how the death of one’s soulmate would wipe away the scrawl on their wrist and leech the color from their life, in a literal sense. How most soulmates fell into severe depression upon their counterpart’s death.
until now?!"
"Sorry?" he coughs, almost choking on his tea. He's quiet for a moment before asking, incredulous,"You want me to dance with you?" Ah; Dr. Watson does have such a propensity for repeating things. "Do you even hear yourself?" He hears the rustle of John's morning newspaper as he folds it into thirds, like he always does.
Christ, he probably looked like shit. Not as high as a kite anymore, but certainly his profile was suspicious.
“Nothing,” said Sherlock, tongue feeling swollen and puffy. The words felt like ash and soot.
"Hey," I snap, pulling the item away before Gladstone can tear it. He stares innocently up at me, but I'm not fooled as I slowly look at the present, glancing at him from the corner of my eye.
“Okay,” was all Sherlock said: this was not at all how he wanted to respond, but could think of nothing more fitting. John smiled back at him, a little reassuring quirk of lips Sherlock had been longing for, but that somehow seemed misplaced.
There had once been a time where, maybe,
"But seriously; what
“Did you see the note?” said Sherlock tersely. He cleared his throat, waving a hand towards the kitchen.
"Just because you may be a "proper genius" doesn't mean you get to insult the rest of us like our IQs are equivalent to that of chimpanzees."
“What do you mean by nothing?”
"Ah: let me see it!" she exclaims, reaching out and wrenching my hand towards her face. She inspects it for a moment, face slightly amused, yet...soft(?). "Oh, guess we won't be getting any grandchildren from you boys, huh?"
“Which part?” said John.
I feel Carver's fist pounding into my stomach and the ache that accompanies it, and my breath hitches as I try desperately to wriggle out of Derek's grasp, but he holds me firmly. I feel his breath against my neck, and I can't help but shiver.
She smiles at me, but it looks professional and oddly dispassionate. That's alright, though; I don't want her sympathy. I don't care if she doesn't actually give a rat's arse if I get "better" or not.
Well, this seems to be the end! I started writing this thing years ago so I’m glad I finally posted the rest. Anyway, thank you all for reading! Hope you all enjoyed.
"Better?" he asks, and I take a moment to nod '
Sherlock could see Eurus observing them on the outskirts of the lake. Their mother had said she had chalky blue eyes, omniscient and ethereal almost; even without their color, the hairs on Sherlock’s neck still stood on end. Her gaze wasn’t that of a curious little girl, but was more akin to the predatory gaze of a prowling cat surveying its prey. Of course, their parents would call Sherlock dramatic for having such an over embellished thought, but he couldn’t help the discomfiture Eurus’s presence always caused him.
If she can't have Sherlock, at least she knows he'll be happy with John.
I usually don't gape like a fish out of water, but I can confirm unwaveringly that I know I am right this instant. How could I not?
John has been invalided back home, but everything is amiss. Shouldn't he be better not seeing war and blood and death? Then why does he feel worse, and useless? It doesn't make any sense, and when his hysterical mother calls, everything starts falling apart at a faster pace than anything should be able to.
I won't glance at the colored label, but I still can't help but recall a time when I was fascinated with the very prospect of soulmates.
," but I honestly don't care.
Sherlock pre-John—as he had come to call that phase of his life—would have scoffed at the idea of small-talk, or avoiding the bits that actually mattered. He would have vehemently discarded the very notion, ripped through John with deduction after deduction, telling him the story of his entire day in the spool of thread on his shirt or the stain on the seam of his pants. He would have been vicious and savagely focused, with the concentration of a flamethrower. He would have pushed John until the man either pushed back or retreated into himself.
Sherlock would prefer chocolate with raspberry jam, thanks.
How about when we were doing that cliché movie kiss with spaghetti strung between our mouths. Somehow he managed to push his saliva covered noodles past my lips.
I stop suddenly, forgetting myself as I try to remember what it is this conversation had even started because of. Then, the answer is blatantly obvious, and it enrages me.
The atmospheric shift is tangible, even through Mycroft's screen. Sherlock allows one elegant, admittedly dramatic bow, but it drags on to a point where he doesn't even pull the soldier up. The doctor is held only by the boffin's lingering hand, and when his brother dear leans in ever the slightest, Mycroft sees a viable opportunity to annoy, and gladly takes it.
A sudden euphoria washes over me so strongly that my face breaks into a faltering grin. I refrain from moving the rest of my body, though, because I don't want that blaring ache to return just yet. I want to celebrate accordingly.
"I know this excellent coffee shop just around the corner-"
I start with my neck and shoulders, then my arms, hands, and chest, next my torso and back before going to my legs, feet, and, well, you know, the...others. After cleansing my whole body, I watch the foamy soap and shampoo combine with the water and slither away, pooling by the drain as I rinse myself off.
Sherlock did receive a message some time later, whilst still meandering down the sidewalk; he was disappointed to find the messenger ID did not belong to John.
"Um, well, I just wanted to ask...," I mumble as I scratch the back of my head,"what color is it?"
One day, much like when the dreaded and revered name came to him, Sherlock lay on his bed. A tree branch tapped erratically against the windowpane; the floorboards creaked from downstairs; a dog howled outside; all the calamity just seemed to so quaintly coalesce that everything became unbearable and Sherlock wrenched up his sleeve. Before he could look, he ran reverent fingers over the patch of skin, his bout of courage flagging at the actual reality of seeing the name that may or may not haunt him for the rest of his lifetime.
"You wouldn't believe." He shakes his head ever the slightest, but his smile looks fond. "But actually, I've never seen him quite like that..."
I growl as the pliers bite back into my shoulder, scouring for another clip of the bullet. The tool waggles around, digging in so deep I think it might touch the bone there.
He makes his way behind the counter and stands to the right of me, wrapping the towel around the glasses I've already washed.
This was an M.O. I’d seen before. One long, continuous cut severed the jugular whist another sliced across the abdomen. I’d been on the hunt, several weeks ago, when I’d encountered a corpse in a similar fashion. I was tailing a cabbie—a serial rapist—and was about to sneak into his car to hide and wait for him until I came across the lacerated body in the alleyway. Despite the man wasn’t any victim of mine, I decided to take a sample of his blood, seeing as it was mostly fresh, and put it on one of my microscope slides. I had later identified the man’s DNA at St. Bart’s—one James Doakes.
. He's
Sherlock settled into the couch, steepling his hands under his chin. There was a haphazard restlessness building at the base of his skull. It felt as if maggots had niggled their way under his skin, burrowed and worked themselves into his innards; it elicited the same sort of gut wrenching disgust and skin-crawling sensation as would the stench of offal. He wasn’t sure if the feeling was the direct result of withdrawal or rather the thought that John might be close to figuring him out.
Sherlock felt bile rising, burning along the length of his throat. He prayed he wouldn’t need to use the bowl tucked behind the leg of the end table—hoped there wouldn’t be a second fit of vomiting today.
He clears his throat awkwardly, and Sherlock's head snaps to him. His and John's eyes both light with recognition as the detective practically leaps away and a scant flood of red dusts the doctor's cheeks.
, Sherlock screamed.
Suddenly hands were holding him by the face, guiding him ever further downwards. His eyes shot open just as his head was laid down in John’s lap. He looked up into his face, heart rate abruptly spiking. John seemed to loom over him, and there was something unsettling and powerful about his current position of dominance. But then his fingers were entangling in Sherlock’s hair and everything felt
. The man's body is so slender, but at the same time lean, and I would say that he just needs someone to make him eat more and he'll be fine.
“Yes, dear?” she hummed as he bristled beside her, an unwilling participant in her name-calling game.
Sherlock’s cheeks burned red with humiliation: he felt like a child being reprimanded by their mother.
"He's more than that, hence how we got into the position we are currently in." His eyes soften slightly then as he says,"Now tell me, really, who is he? Will he hurt you?"
John had been distant for some time. Sherlock felt like an outside observer in the inner workings of his own life. He prepared tea in the morning with shaking fingers, pushed the mug into John’s hands, to which he was only thanked stiffly. He held Rosie until she fell asleep against his hip, swaying around the flat, to which John merely watched. He rarely spoke to John unless spoken to, for fear that something he said would push him off some unspoken precipice. It felt dreadfully like walking on eggshells. It seemed imperative that he do
The hand shifted to his forehead. “You might have a bit of a fever.” There was a terse pause, followed by a drawn-out sigh. “Why do you never take care of yourself? If you don’t be careful, you’ll kill yourself one day.”
Lestrade and Mycroft might be each other's
"This is an old friend of mine, John Watson."
So you admit you implied it?
"I love you, John...," she whispers. It's the first full sentence she's said; my eyes prickle.
I oblige almost immediately, lunging from my armchair and swiftly pulling Skully to rest against my thigh. His silence always pulls something deep out of me, probably because I know he can't mock me. He's just an object, but he's better than people.
I used to always ask Mummy if there was someone out there for me, someone who would love me unconditionally and not hate all of my supposed quirks and icy comments. She had always said that there had always been someone who loved me, and who would always love me, unconditionally.
John seems like he's finally embarrassed as he says thickly,"Uh...thanks, Mrs. H. I was just going out to get some, but I needed to have a talk with Sherlock about...what is and isn't acceptable behavior." His stare shifts to Sherlock's.
We're only happy for you, mate.
“Tell you what, I’ll give you them with a discount—£150 each.”
“What?” John said, sounding genuinely confused. His body heat was radiating into Sherlock’s own, warming him invariably. It mingled with the warmth creeping up his neck in shame.
of it.
Yet another time when he was experimenting with facial hair(luckily he's clean shaven again)...
Sherlock knew most people, if they even met their soulmates at all, didn’t do so until well into their twenties or thirties. He fully knew that John wouldn’t have a physical presence in his life until much later.
"Did the Freak's lapdog drag him here, or what?" she scoffs, turning to Lestrade. He glares at her from the corner of his eyes; it's strangely intimidating.
The niggling in my skull suddenly becomes unbearable, and I find myself wrenching my left sleeve down. Before I can glimpse my arm, though, I close my eyes, allowing my fingernails to skim over the sensitive flesh of my wrist.
said a voice startlingly like Mycroft’s.
A fond sigh before he responds,"Now you're just acting like a child."
“Yeah, that excuse would have held up for maybe a good two hours,” said John, leveling Sherlock with a particularly omniscient expression. “It’s been nearly seven. And that’s only since I
, but Ella just continues to look at me.
“I grabbed you the blanket too,” he said. “I figured we can both watch some telly so you can rest and I can keep an eye on you.”
"Yeah, Johnny: why're you hiding it?" Derek adds, and now my books are splayed on the concrete below. He stomps on my binder and wrenches my book bag off my back as Carver tries shoving me to the ground. I resist him, gripping his arms in mine and holding him back.
I feel queasy again as my vision fades slightly. I rapidly blink, trying to keep awake.
21 February 13:21
The puppy cocks his head, almost awaiting the subsequent list of rules. "Firstly, no chewing any of my things, and I promise I'll get something suitable for you to chew on in return." His ears seem to perk up at the prospect of a chew toy; I grimace.
"Of course. You're allowed to leave anytime you like. Would you like me to see you out?" She unfolds her legs, eyes still locked on my face. There isn't much warmth to them.
I'm babbling. In vain, I rub circles into my head that are meant to be soothing. My chest feels tight, and I scratch fitfully at it.
When he reinjected, supernovas collapsed and constellations exploded. Everything was right with the world.
"Nonsense, John." A confident tone.
"Yeah, but..." A long pause, almost too long. "I won't always be there to tell you what makes sense and what doesn't."
forgive you. I’ve been told I’m a difficult person. I’m surprised you never wanted to do worse.”
I really love to explore Mycroft and Sherlock’s relationship, especially in a scenario like this. Their banter is always fun to write.
“Very well,” said Mycroft. The book was plucked elegantly from the linoleum tiles. After confiscating it, Mycroft gently pushed Sherlock into a sitting position against the bathtub. He had a cloth in one hand, though from where Sherlock was unsure, and began gingerly dabbing at the spittle accumulating on Sherlock’s chin.
etched in Sherlock’s features.
later.
I grin as the recruits shift in their sleep, then almost flinch away from their cots. One soldier rolls completely off the bed onto the floor, and he startles awake. Another tries pressing the off button on his alarm, but just manages to turn it on, making him almost leap from his bed as he quickly turns it back off.
Now that I think about it, I vaguely remember thinking about all the colors I might see if I looked into the mirror across from my shower stall. Mum told me my skin is a tan color, and she tried to explain it, but it's still difficult to imagine. She told me water looks blue, but not in small quantities, so I tried to imagine the "clear" color she told me of. I wondered what color the shampoo and body wash and loofa and tiles were. I wondered what the blue of my eyes and the blonde of my hair looked like, trying to think of how Mum had described it.
"Lestrade is always making fun of my lack of political knowledge and how I don't know the current prime minister," I explain, squinting slightly at the computer screen. "But now, with your name, I can rub in his face that I know at least one well known one..."
“Take me to Loretta’s supermarket,” said Sherlock, pressing himself against the window pane of the back seat.
"What do you think I'll first see that's blue?" I query, leaning forward to pick at one of the marigold's petals. I rub it between my thumb and forefinger, waiting as my mother hums thoughtfully.
You know, that really makes me sound like a dick. He's not a bad kisser, per se. More like he seems to have an...I was going to put it lightly, but he has an awful kissing filter for when and where it makes sense to kiss and when and where it doesn't.
!" I exclaim, pushing off of my chair, laptop cradled in my arms. The canine shifts in his position at my feet, tilting his head to look curiously up at my grinning face. "That's going to be your name!" I've taken 'Blackbeard' into consideration, but it reminds me too much of Redbeard, and I don't want that.
"Let me get you a cuppa, first, dear," she replies, and I find I'm feeling too...
She idly stirs two scoops of sugar into Sherlock's mug, taking care not to put any into John's. Scampering to the fridge and pulling out the carton of milk, she pours a bit into hers.
I don't finish, the sentence left sharp and prickly in the air. She doesn't say anything, or force me to continue, but that may only be because she knows the ending.
"I kept warning,'
"Yes, Sherlock," she says, gesturing for me to come in, I guess. I wave away her offer, still standing awkwardly under the doorway as she patiently waits for whatever I have to say.
"Now, Lestrade has been a good friend to me, although he can be a bit overbearing. I know I'm obnoxious, but he deals with it, and with me forgetting his name." A wave of laughs from the audience. "I'm glad he can find some sort of happiness by being with Mycroft, although I'm not sure how he can stand him." More chuckles.
“If you say so,” said John slowly, returning his attention to his daughter’s face.
I can hear both of them laughing in my ear, then I feel my sleeve being tugged up forcefully.
“Oh,” she said happily, taking his wrist in her fingers. She pulled his arm closer to her, positioning it in the direct sunlight. She ran a reverent hand over the scrawl, face a mixture of amusement and something decidedly softer around the edges. “No grandchildren from either of you boys then? That’s fine of course.” Her smile was like sunlight. “It’s all fine.”
I haven't realized how good his name sounds out loud; how
“You feel obligated to stay with me after what you did,” garbled Sherlock, tongue feeling thick as he spoke, as if it was puffy and rooted to the roof of his mouth. The familiar sting of tears nipped at his vision but he bit down on his lower lip to replace the distress with physical pain. “That’s why you stayed. You felt guilty because of what you did. You want a clear conscience.” He exhaled tiredly, keeping his gaze squarely on the television. “Well you already have my forgiveness. There’s nothing else you have to do so—“
"There's another sensitivity lesson next Friday, if you need it," he threatens, gesturing to a clipboard on the wall. "I've already signed Anderson up for it, and the next two after that."
John shifted on his feet, readjusting Rosie’s position on his hip. “Well,” he said with a certain finality, although he hadn’t even started, “I’ve been alone with Rosie for the past couple weeks and…” There was an inarticulacy to his thoughts, mirrored by a seeming unease and incompetence in his movements. He fluttered about the flat, toying with the edge of the fireplace mantle, scuffing his foot against the carpeted floor. “And...now that Mary is,” he paused, then waved his hand in an all-encompassing gesture, “y’know...The house has been very lonely and, frankly, I can’t afford to be there without her, and…” He trailed off, looking lost and perturbed.
Thank you for your patience and consideration.
"You won't
yet?" he says uncomfortably. I see him shift in his seat as he pulls his hand away, instead tapping his fingers against the bar.
"And if you must know, I was the one that forced Sherlock to come," he says, giving a little shrug as an afterthought. "Thought he could use some help."
Where did this come from?
"Oh, you arseholes!" I call incredulously, the canine still yapping beneath my legs, trying to pull on my trousers. I swiftly lift him up, keeping him away from my body as he continues trying to nip and bite. Redbeard was like this as a puppy.
I sit silently for a moment, examining the gray flowers and wondering all about colors:
"How do you feel about the violin? Will barking bother you?" he says, not even looking up from my phone as he continues to type away. He swivels around suddenly and throws me the phone, which I barely see in time. "There's bound to be a bit of it."
He wanted to cry.
Suddenly, there's a ping from my pocket, and I wrench out my shabby BlackBerry to see a text notification labeled '
"Just be good at the wedding, won't you, brother dear?" I faintly register the slight smirk on his face, and I have the "sudden" urge to punch him, here and now.
frustrated. I want to know everything, and I know it isn't possible, but that doesn't mean it doesn't anger me.

I shift my gaze to him as I say,"My apologies. I must've deleted it."
Although Sherlock still felt infinitesimally small, like a loser, like one of those doped up druggies in the den which had giggled coyly and operated without a care in the world, he nodded. He said nothing more.
“Did you eat anything before you left?”
However, before Sherlock heard John’s familiar gait on the stairs, a featherlight kiss was pressed to the center of his forehead. “Goodnight, Sherlock,” was mumbled into the inky darkness of the flat before John returned to his room upstairs.
, he wanted to kiss John. The rush of smack, euphoria mixed with elation, made the silly fantasy seem somehow possible.
"Mycroft," I state, and he seems convinced enough to back off a little. He looks worried still, but I just focus on breathing instead.
A ping from the side of the camera's parameter startles the pair, and Sherlock almost drops the doctor in his hysterical fit to pull away. Gliding to his mobile, Mycroft watches in mirth as Sherlock's face sours into an almost snarl.
Sherlock stiffened as John entered several hours later with Rosie, asleep in his arms. “John,” he said carefully, adjusting his position on the sofa. He folded his hands in his lap, bowing his head a bit in a show of something akin to submission.
“Yes, yes,” Sherlock said hastily, already bounding out of the car. He tossed a wad of pound notes in the cabbie’s general direction with a fleeting goodbye.
"Shhh, I'll get it out; don't you worry."
"Actually, I almost have, Graham," I state proudly, placing my hands on my hips.
I pull at the hem of my jumper, adjusting the collar of my undershirt as I glance up at the mirror in front of me.
“No, you didn’t,” said John. “That’s it, nothing more to it. I’ve already been going to the classes, and seeing the therapist—that’s the end of it.”
“Positively,” lied Sherlock, and smiled for good measure.
"Love you too, Mum," I return. I hear her wipe at her eyes before she hangs up. My mobile feels heavy in my palm. I place it on the desk, then I cradle my head in my hands. I just rub circles into my head and blink.
I feel terrible because I kept saying “Yes, I will update this fic, of course I’ll finish it” and yet I never did. The least I can do is refurbish it and repost it. I will leave this version of the story accessible, however, in case anyone still wants to access and read/reference it at any time. The new version will have changes to dialogue, characterization (to a degree), plot (due to new information from season 4 which I lacked while writing the initial story).
not knowing why.” There was no way he could seem to voice this cloying feeling adequately, no matter how dearly he tried.
That night, Sherlock, unable to flee to his room—which, he reminded himself, was now John’s—still tried to avoid John simply by feigning sleep. As soon as he heard footfall on the stairs, he curled into himself on the sofa, facing the cushions, and covered himself quickly with the duvet. He felt John’s heavy gaze sweep over him before it disappeared. John took Rosie up to her bed, came back down, puttered about the kitchen, then retired to his own room.
I wonder past the pain if it's just me, or Bill sounds more frightened than I feel. He sounds fuzzy in my ears and he doesn't look like usual, which, frankly, is terrifying.
He looked at himself in the mirror for a long moment. His hair was sweat slicked and frizzy, matted to his forehead. His pupils were constricted pin-hole thin, and the sclera was red and riddled with prominent blood vessels. Flush crept over his skin, which was riddled with goosebumps and raised hair. His clothes hung limply over his form, bony shoulders protruding. Hands quivering and unsteady, he smoothed down the front of his shirt. Extending his arm, brandishing it at the mirror, he saw fresh marks in the crook of his elbow, little pinpricks along the veins.
Why would I be asking you to kiss me right now if I think you're bad at kissing?
"Ligature marks here, around the bulk of her throat. About the width of her purse's strap, hence the murder weapon has been right under your noses." Sherlock flicks his coat collar up with a dramatic flourish, looking to Lestrade's frowning face.
John’s expression softened. “Every word,” he said, letting out a gentle sigh. “More than you know.” His hands now moved down lower towards Sherlock’s shoulder, softly tracing shapes into his skin. “I swear I’ll never hurt you again, Sherlock. I
A bunch of clapping follows the kiss, but I'm left wondering how Mycroft and Lestrade know so many people; how many friends can the British government actually have?
After all, I haven't even seen their name myself. I don't know what gender they are, or where they live, or what they're doing, or if they're tall, smart, friendly, loyal:
Lestrade sighs thoughtfully, taking another sip of lager before he questions,"Don't you think it's a bit weird that I've known you for almost 2 years, but I don't even know your bloody brother's name?"
'. He actually looks relieved, and his almost always pinched face relaxes into something more natural. We sit for a moment, me still trying to catch my breath and him watching over me, before he breaks the silence.
The gentle fingers moved away after a moment; Sherlock almost verbally keened at the loss. Relief inundated him when the warm presence returned, this time to the small of his back. Hands kneaded his tense muscles, firmly enough to be tangible but not so roughly to alert him to their presence—if he hadn’t already been awake.
The D.I. looks thoughtful momentarily as he absorbs what I've said, tapping his fingers against the dark gray mahogany of the counter. His forehead creases in thought as he frowns at his mug of lager, sighing after a moment.
Sherlock did as John said, hoping he could at least be
Pushing open the office door, she sets the mugs in the sink, slinking over to the office desk in the back of the room. She supposes she really needs to clean a bit if she's to find anything; Sherlock had requested the autopsy of the man she promised him he could take a look at.
of Sherlock. “Are you feeling ill? You look a bit peaky.”
The fact stings a bit, but she knows there was only a slim chance of her attraction being mutual; how could a couple mugs of coffee change Sherlock's whole perspective of her? She hadn't even been considering John, either, which is probably a no-no if she ever wants a relationship with the detective.
Yet he was on Cloud Nine. Everything was under control.
21 February 13:53
The last of her inhibitions and guard seemed to melt away, expression now touched with fondness and forgiveness. “For what?”
“Listen, Sherlock,” John’s voice broke through his musing.
The pallor of his skin, the constriction of his pupils, his flush—everything was practically a dead giveaway to a doctor who had been in practice for over fifteen years.
but he couldn’t decide
There the pliers are, deep in my shoulder, nipping at my skin, and then, oh, the warmth I feel when a shard is removed.
"I was in the car with him, almost like the guardian angel beside his shoulder. The devil was himself, and he was speeding, over 100 miles per hour," I explain slowly, heaving a deep, soothing breath. My fingers itch to do something other then stay limp in my lap, but it's almost as if my body's locked.
“I know things have been...strained recently,” John continued, fiddling with the arm of the chair, worrying the fabric between his fingers. “And Christ, I want us to
It was like ripping off a Band-Aid, Sherlock thought, and quickly removed his hand. His eyes honed in on the dark gray script. The name which had been tormenting and intriguing him day-in and day-out for however long was only comprised of four letters.
"John."
“Why are you telling me this now?” she said.
"Yes, dear?" she asks, and I unconsciously bristle at the implication of the pet name. Brushing off the term of endearment, I settle on the soil beside her trowel and shovel, watching her tend to the bright gray flowers.
Sherlock felt cotton mouthed, throat pinhole thin. He nodded minutely, reaching for the clothes and taking them with shaking fingers. “Thank you,” he said, though he felt like he was suffocating. Everything felt wrong, strained—like at any moment something would crack. He was expecting ire and yelling and rage. “I’ll be down in a bit.”
And she beams at me, her teeth nearly completely white compared to the black of her hair.
At that moment, Sherlock threw up—unceremoniously—into his lap.
"What happened in the dream?" I fight the urge to correct her; it was definitely not a dream, but a
"I also know that you're here as a potential flatmate," he explains, turning on his heel and starting back to his microscope. He takes my phone with him, typing something out that I assume is probably just his number. "So, onto a question or two."
! What a pleasant surprise of my dear brother, his husband, and their newly acquired canine companion to visit me," I exclaim, laying the sarcasm on thick. I glance to the dog's muzzle, but I don't see any Redbeard there.
She hummed in response.
"Cheers," I finally shout, and everyone tips their glass as if they're tipping a hat in thanks. Then they all guzzle the champagne as I swallow a meager sip, and the hall bursts into fits of laughs and shouts and applause and hollers.
Warning: explicit drug use in this chapter, and heavy use of cursing.
Suddenly he felt like a kid with his hand caught in the cookie jar. “Well,” he started slowly, walking closer to the center of the room and collapsing into his armchair. He fiddled with the baggies in his inner coat pocket discreetly, reassuring himself of their continued presence. “You know how Graham is.” He shrugged his shoulders in a gesture as if to indicate the complete lack of need for further exposition.
Sherlock watched him leave with a growing sense of distress. The baggies were burning a hole in his coat pocket. All he needed now was a syringe and a bathroom; he spotted a woman sitting in a rickety chair by the far window, a smattering of syringes littered behind her.
“Would you like to go to the lake?” Sherlock suggested. The words felt foreign on his tongue, for it wasn’t often that he invited Victor on such ventures. It was usually the other, more outspoken boy who had always asked him over for cucumber sandwiches or to watch telly or play pirates outside. “I have something I’d like to talk about, if you’d please?”
They stopped at Baker Street first. The vehicle pulled up to the kerb, the familiar 221B gleaming faintly in the moonlight. It seemed to beckon him as much as it seemed to dissuade him. John was looking at the knocker as if it were something more—as if there was some answer to the world’s unanswerable questions in the curve of the metal. Still, however, he didn’t speak. Silence seemed to strangle him.

to shake John Watson. I'm already getting too attached.

"I know because I usually have to ask if you've had nightmares, and even then you aren't so forthcoming with information. Am I wrong in assuming this one was different?" She folds her hands primly in her lap, crossing her legs. I shift slightly to turn to the window, glimpsing a woman walking her dog outside; I'm glad Ella keeps the blinds open.
A lump formed in Sherlock’s throat. It was an uncomfortable and unwelcome nuisance, like a gnat flying around your head.
Sherlock watched the ripple-effect as he thought how best to phrase it. After a moment of hesitation, he simply came out with it. “Have you gotten your soul-marking yet?”

I unhook the loofa from the showerhead and squeeze the (once again, cheap) body wash onto it. I rinse it under the water and smooth my hands over it before starting my way down my body.
"Nurse, the chopper is landing!"
John, who had been smiling warmly at Rosie, directed his gaze at Sherlock. His expression sobered. “Are you sure you’re alright?”
Sherlock watched it with a semblance of detachment, as if observing the nuances of a painting. He felt far away, disconnected from the sight. Here, right in front of him, were the two people he cherished most in this world. They were bubbly and affectionate, familiar and comfortable. Here he was, the one person he loathed most in this world, sitting across from them, trying desperately to partake but seemingly falling short—as he somehow managed to in every capacity. An incongruous and discordant presence.
“I was starting to worry,” John half-laughed, smile going slanted. Sherlock couldn’t detect if it was genuine or joking. “Come and sit down.” He patted the space next to him gently, as if in invitation. “We can watch whatever you want. I know you like that Jeremy Kyle Show.” He scoffed as if he didn’t quite understand the fascination but the prospect of watching said show was bearable if it was in the name of Sherlock’s amusement. “Whatever you want,” he said again with that crooked smile still present.
The only problem was that it was so obviously false.
“You look so peaceful like this.” More petting, fingers shakily smoothing down unruly hair. “You don’t have that little dent in your brow.”
He knew the love of family, if not that of friends—or just the one, Victor—but nothing could ever seem to successfully fill up the lonely chasm inside him, borne from expectations of the special kind of love only a soulmate could provide.
Not with the truth of his own feelings, and certainly not with Rosie’s safety. The realization sent a crippling wave of sorrow through him.
Sherlock was suddenly reminded of himself ten years younger, huddled in a drug den, close to overdosing; surrounded by strangers and syringes—comforted by that—only for Mycroft to somehow track him down. He would pull him into his black sedan and bring him back to Baker Street with the most tenderness he was capable of displaying; he would give Sherlock fluids and some saltines to eat, wash his face gently with a cloth. He would force him to shower and get a fresh set of clothes, then to brush his teeth and rest in bed for a while. Mycroft stayed even when the withdrawals began, would give Sherlock soup and pile blankets over his shivering form; put a cold damp cloth on his forehead when he developed a fever later on.
Sherlock could sense the exact moment the solution entered his bloodstream. His heart beat frantically against his ribcage, caught somewhere in his throat. The rush assailed him like the harsh yet invigorating words of an ex-lover. His body sang as the familiar euphoria inundated him. Warmth flooded into his face, curling throughout his limbs. It was a bit beleaguering, but the rush felt even better than he remembered—like visiting a dear friend after not having seen him for many years. Like a soldier returning home from war; like a fire growing larger with a steady swell of oxygen.
—but not in the same capacity she loved him; not in the way she deserved. It was just another thing for which to hate himself, another person he had disappointed. His failures were scratched like tally marks into his soul. He remembered in his youth when he had relished in always being right, but realized now, staring into Molly’s somber, tentative eyes, that he hadn’t been right for a long time now. Perhaps he had always been wrong, always been a failure, a disappointment.
They had been so close that people often assumed they were a couple. They worked in a steady push-pull fashion, give and take. John would push Sherlock to talk about his feelings, and when he received snarls and disdain, he would pull back. Sherlock would deduce something about John which was particularly raw and painful, to which he would hastily backtrack.
With his overcoat already shed from his shoulders and shirt cuff already rolled above his forearm, he extended his arm flat on the vanity, positioning the syringe directly above the inner elbow. He watched blood seep into the syringe barrel and, without further deliberation, pushed down the plunger.
Finally, I find my patience has worn thin as I idly spin my fork on my plate, twirling spaghetti around its tines. I haven't told my parents that I've received the mark, and they wouldn't know, considering only the recipient of the marking can hear the characteristic chime, and every person receives their mark at different times in their life.
"What...," I stop, lips thinning into a frown. My eyes find the sun and stare. "What happened?"
"Whiskey on the rocks, I presume?" I say, his head snapping up, eyes peering at me from beneath greasy hair. His utter lack of hygiene is plenty repulsive; at least the woman prior had on makeup and had curled her hair, even if she knew she wasn't considered 'pretty'.
This was all routine. If he thought of it like that, instead of like failure, then it might not hurt so much.
I lay my head down completely as I'm hulled onto the helicopter; considering what I just went through, I feel like I deserve a breather.
Sherlock said nothing. It felt as if his heart was trying to squeeze its way out of his ribcage.
I nod faintly.
"Come on, Myc." Greg is in the doorway, beckoning my brother, and I find that I'm glad Mycroft found his soulmate, in some twisted sense of the word; he has someone else he can bother now. Someone who can keep him away from me.
"Oh," escapes my lips because what should I really say? "Hi." It's all I can come up with as I take his hand in mine, giving a light squeeze before dropping it to my side.
21 February 14:26
“How you doing?” said one of the men. He wore a tattered leather jacket and had his hands out of sight. His eyes were abnormally sunken-in, skin sallow, greasy hair held back in a ponytail.
She's right; I
It was most likely early afternoon, or somewhere thereabouts, and he was quickly growing impatient with the complete lack of stimuli. The light acted merely as a safe little distraction, something fascinating to watch but clearly simple in nature when thought about more than just fleetingly.
“And how’ve you been, Watson?” said Sherlock, pushing aside the sting and instead smiling at her bubbly face.
, but it is a different sort of attractiveness; I'm not sure he's the definition of an attractive man because people have called me attractive, and neither of us seem very similar.

again.
"I was bloody angry as
Mycroft waddles over to me, a smirk spread across his pudgy face. His expression is less scrunched as he clamps a hand on my shoulder; his way of saying thank you, I suppose. Honestly, he doesn't have to thank me, and I really don't want a hug.
"Would I have to...," my voice trails off, meek and gentle, and it's only now that I realize I've been shaking. I don't want anything in my mouth, and I just want to gag to wash the nastiness away. "He wouldn't make me..." I want to vomit.
Phantom light seeped through and illuminated the insides of his closed eyelids. Fabric shuffled against the linoleum kitchen tiles; cabinetry opened and closed, faucet turning on then off. There was a brief reprieve, a tense moment where Sherlock remained stiffly coiled on the sofa and no sound permeated the flat. Then, he felt movement at his back.
She scrawls another note into her book before ending on the cool line,"Oh, really?" As soon as she finishes writing, her eyes are back on me as she says,"May I ask what was different about this one?"
I blink lazily, seeing the sun eclipsed by Murray's concentrated face. I'm glad to have Bill, otherwise I would probably already be dead. Bleeding out and letting a gray puddle soak beneath me and into the sand.
junkie. More cautious, more knowledgeable, less stupid. He had more self-control than any of the others, thought Sherlock. The smack this morning had merely been a momentary lapse in his usual rigid self-restriction.
, and to have some idea of what his soulmate was like. After thinking that, he immediately felt guilt flood into him on John’s behalf.
Stop sulking.
"So although I despise my brother, and my relationship with Lestrade is usually limited to business, I stand here as their best man to congratulate the consummation of...
John’s expression was imploring, but not in the way Molly’s had been. Molly had been inquisitive, allowing Sherlock to go at his own pace. John was desperate, crazed in his manner of inquiry, almost as if demanding Sherlock to tell him.
fucking
"Putting aside the one time I already saw them ready to snog each other senseless," he smiles again,"they're pretty obvious. I mean, look at the way they're looking at each other." He gestures subtly to the pair across the room.
He looks oddly stoic, and he startles me as his eyes flash my way, curious, scrutinizing. The man's eyes then train on Mike, to which my friend smiles politely; he looks amused.
Her fingers brush tentatively at the flesh of my wrist, and I nod for her to continue, seeing the clear expression of hesitancy on her face. Suddenly, she forces my right sleeve up, and she stares at it for a moment. Then, I see confusion blur with the look of amazement.
“It’s alright.” He said it with the air of a widower responding to the obligatory consolation of a funeral goer—like “alright” was an unspoken but all-known code for the opposite. “I know you get caught up in your own head sometimes.”
—when he raised his arm in greeting.
“Hey, hey,” John cooed, brandishing a wet cloth and carrying a bucket with soapy water. After placing the bucket next to the couch, he pulled gently at Sherlock’s sleeves, prying his hands from where they were pressed against his chest. Squeezing, he gently ran his thumbs over Sherlock’s knuckles. “Here, shift this way a bit.”
The detective and soldier are sitting on the end of his bed, both of their body's impossibly close, shoulders brushing with every breath. They look almost as if they're relishing in the feel of the closeness, inhaling the other's air.
glad.
"Wait, where are you going?" I ask, disappointed as he barely gives me a second glance. "I don't have your address or name, yet." The man seems to catch himself as he turns back around and gives me a falsely apologetic smile.
I told Lestrade most of my conclusions, leaving out the bit where I’d actually encountered this method before, as well as the bit about me making so many of my conclusions based on my own killing experiences. He seemed abated, nodding and directing his team from the scene once he was seemingly satisfied. John, all the while, stood firmly rooted to my side. That was still odd. It was something I hadn’t yet become used to—and I wondered if I ever would.
, Sherlock thought,
"Not a word," my friend murmurs, and he still has that smirk mixed between smug and amused. My head shakes on its own accord, rotating back to face this strange man that could tell all of that by a few glances and slight observations.
I startle from my chair, squinting at the light cascading through the window and shedding on my lap. Gladstone is still there, cuddled up against my chest, and I suddenly realize I fell asleep. I glance at my watch: 5:26 PM. I actually stayed asleep for almost 2 hours;

Finally, I look to the figure against the countertop, leaning over a microscope, and the first thing my brain supplies is
I snort in amusement as he turns his narrowed eyes on me, clearly unamused with this whole situation. I hold back another snicker as I start to clean a new tumbler and pass it over to his outstretched hands.
"I, Gregory Lestrade, take you, Mycroft Holmes, to be my lawfully wedded husband."
A faint noise disrupted his idle observation. Unmistakable, he thought, so clearly unmistakable. It was a soft noise, akin to wind chimes catching a gentle breeze in the autumnal sky. It was so gentle that he could have pretended it was a simple conjuration of his imagination. He could’ve forgotten the moment, tucked it into a corner of one of the lesser used rooms in his Mind Palace, completely wiped it from memory. He could’ve lived life without the knowledge that the brief moment ever passed—after all, no one else had heard or would ever hear the sound as he had.
stupid.
, per se, but definitely nostalgic. I spent my whole childhood there, and going back almost seems like a dream that I could wake up from any moment now. Of course, I've been gone so long that it seems almost foreign to me; I can't even remember what my school looked like or the layout of the subway.
"Dance with me, John." Sherlock directs the phrase at his companion, who is settled into his chair with a cuppa. Oh, and here is a delightfully snoop-worthy moment! Mycroft isn't ashamed as he, with an amused smirk, watches the scene intently.
Suddenly, I remember the canine is behind me; I can't just leave and expect him not to ruin anything. And somehow, I've gotten so caught up in items that I've forgotten to even give him a name.
Even the way he said her name was undeserving of her greatness. He couldn’t seem to infuse his words with everything he meant to; couldn’t phrase the sorrow, express the regret, show the sincerity. He spoke as if nothing in their relationship was remiss, as if there wasn’t an elephant in the room.
He doesn't get paid enough for this.
', go on." I wildly motion to the door again, much more annoyed with his actions than I overtly show; I can't have him thinking he's winning anything.
Sherlock shook himself as if he could dislodge the shards of memory, then rolled over, tucking his arms into his stomach. The duvet was draped over his emaciated form. He had given John his room so both he and Rosie could have their own beds. It was fine, Sherlock thought, sleeping on the sofa was an old friend. Before John, he had often occupied the couch rather than a bed, feeling some strange comfort in the fireplace mantle and the large bay window. His room had never been his own anyway. It was a place to sleep, but it wasn’t a home.
, I suppose. I'm too ashamed right now, too exhausted, and I find that I just want to sip my tea and then go to sleep, for once.
"I don't particularly mind either; the violin sounds lovely," I respond honestly, warming comfortably at his approving look. "That's if you can even play well." My jab gets a grunt of acknowledgement, but little else.
He hesitates, because maybe his haughty brother is actually right. But then he sniffs pointedly and crosses his arms to cradle the pillow against his chest. "Preposterous," he scoffs, bypassing the fact that he must look like a complete child.
would you delete that?" he stammers, face now darker in anger, not out of sheer humiliation.
Sherlock nods faintly as she leaves the room, empty mugs clinking in her hands. John offered to help her carry them, but she didn't want to make a bigger deal about it than it already was; it's obvious Sherlock knew what she was doing. It's also obvious the type of affection she holds for him isn't returned in the slightest.
himself—for John and Rosie’s sake—that he wouldn’t resort to smack. Coke was bad enough, but to return to the warm, enticing embrace of heroin after so many years...Sherlock winced.
“For yesterday,” John clarified, clearing his throat. “I got frustrated with you, and that was unfair of me. I was worried and you were being...you.” He waved his hand in the air in an all-encompassing gesture, as if the meaning of his words was clearly evident. “Sulky and standoffish. God, you were actually
John’s posture grew rigid, jaw tightening. The familiarity that had been present seconds ago fell away, and Sherlock felt even less secure than he already had moments ago. “There’s something I’ve been meaning to say to you, for a long while actually.”
of a brother has been very...
“So soon?” said the woman.
Now it sounds resolved, and I rotate completely to see a man waving me down. Again, there is something familiar about him as he smiles, but I can't quite put my finger on it.
"Another appointment tomorrow?" her voice chimes. My head turns back to her inquisitive expression, my hand resting on the doorknob.
"Hmmm...it was forest green, I believe, like the color of the needles of a spruce tree. Quite pretty," she ends offhandedly, tilting the water pitcher in her hands for the liquid to cascade over the flower's petals. I suppose looking at the things in a garden wouldn't be too bad, that is, if mother isn't exaggerating about all the variant colors of flowers.
"What ever are you talking about, Gavin?" I reply innocently. "Greg;
here, and without you I’m…” He grimaced, pausing like he wasn’t really sure of the right word.
I squint at the text from my position at the table, and I wish the phone could've just smashed and it would have been done with.
"You hav-have to come s-ee him, John...his face...he's dying...!" Her voice cracks. I suddenly want to roll back into bed; it would be easier. Anything other than now would be easier.
"Oh," she smiles, moving her hands to tend to the next flower over. "It said Gregory, dear," she finishes simply, not turning to glance at me. Well, I suppose my parents are okay with my soulmate being male, then, if Mycroft's is. That's good, I assume.
I look again down the hall before starting out and half-heartedly waving goodbye to Mike, to which he waves back, and nodding at the woman.
21 February 13:56
Once, John would have gotten offended at any insinuation of being left behind to banalities and domesticity. He would have jumped at the chance to come with Sherlock on some intriguing adventure or go to Scotland Yard.
"Maybe so, Mycroft, but the fact still remains that he will leave like the rest, soulmate or not. They always do," I intone dejectedly, and Mycroft's eyes harden with something close to understanding. He pivots to look out the window, taking a clump of the chair's arm in hand, pulling, worrying at the fabric.
He staggered from the bed, wrenching open the curtains. The window was caked and blurred with an amalgamation of humid summer air and rain water. The road was flooded already, but the rain didn't seem like it was going to let up any time soon.
The man nods vaguely, not looking at all impressed with my deduction. I frown at his lack of reaction, but nod before finally striding to the last customer. She's gazing at her phone as my eyes take in her chubby face.
that I would never hurt anyone.” Self-loathing seemed to tighten around his neck like a noose; he pulled at the collar of his jumper as if attempting to free himself. “I decided to take anger management classes. I’ve been going to them for a few weeks now. I’ve also been seeing a new therapist.”
“It wasn’t okay. You’re making me feel worse,” shouted John, expelling an unsteady breath, pinching the bridge of his nose between his fingers. “It was
the sincerity of John’s concern clinging to every feature. The intensity of it was disturbing, after such a long reprieve from John’s affections. The worst part, thought Sherlock, was that John
Another shake.
Sherlock picked up a stone of his own and walked towards the well, which had quickly become his and Victor’s safe place. He relinquished the pebble and counted the seconds before it inevitably hit the murky water below. Victor came up behind him and handed him another stone. At the same time, they both dropped their stones and watched as Sherlock’s hit the bottom in marginally less time than Victor’s own.
to us! You said you weren't gay, all this time, but we knew better! We knew you were lying when you said you were straight! Well, you can't lie now with William on your wrist, can you?" Carver yells, inching closer and closer to my face.
Sherlock quietly lamented the distance between them. He lassoed John with mental ropes, urging him closer. He cast a neuron net over his figure, concentrated so wildly on hauling him closer. What had changed, thought Sherlock,
You would think it would be overly hot when you die, all of the blood pouring from your warm and insulated body. I just feel cold, though. My blood feels frigid and it snakes under my palms and rubs itself along my back. Everything is so
Mrs. Hudson looks sorrowfully down at me, and I know she's just trying to comfort me by wrapping me in a hug, but her arms aren't welcome right now. I try pushing her off, my arms feeling limp, more like noodles than appendages.
"I...where?" My eyes linger on the couple again; I notice the stroller they're toting around. I can see their baby.
“Yeah,” said John, finally, to which Sherlock sagged with immense relief. “Yes,” he repeated, almost as if to solidify the promise to himself. “We’ll talk later.”
It's no secret that Mycroft enjoys, possibly a little too much, the way he irritates his brother. Mostly, he actually is worried about what Sherlock does, and his brother merely acts overdramatically, but on the occasion that he does find an opportunity to annoy, he doesn't pass it up.
Abruptly, a sob catches in my throat, and now I'm choking on my breath
“Mother?” Sherlock said.
“Actually,” said Sherlock, quieting for a moment, “it was...it was quite nice.” Another wave of nausea and guilt assaulted him, weighing in his stomach like a litter of drowned kittens. It felt as if he had been forced to eat a collection of rocks, which had sunk to the bottom of his cavernous stomach and settled there. “But it just...hasn’t been working for me anymore.” He grimaced, teasing apart the envelope and peeling out a collection of pound notes. Now that the coke was so close, his skin was singing with want, searing. He pushed aside the rising fountain of guilt, instead honing his tunnel-vision, focusing only on the desire to get high.
A hand pressed against his forehead. “You’re burning up still,” said John, brow furrowing. He reached around and grabbed the bowl of what looked to be chicken noodle soup from the table, brandishing it for Sherlock to take. “I’d suggest getting some food in you.”
A warm weight settled on his shoulder, rubbing shapes into his clavicle. Sherlock simultaneously wanted to leap from his skin and melt into John’s—because
My thoughts drift to colors again, to the crimson color that was explained to me during medical school when I asked what it looked like. To the olive color that Bill explained is the hue of my camo cargo pants. To the sandy tint of the sand of Afghanistan that Mum told me about before I left.

But I'm not deterred so easily.
JOHN! God, you're such a romantic x
I scoff before I can rein in my emotions. "This mutt?" I snort, bringing the bow of my violin sharply over its strings(causing my 'visitors' to flinch). "He'll be more of a nuisance then a companion; he'll trample my papers, knock over my experiments! I am
Mrs. Hudson doesn't follow me, and I don't turn back.
Sherlock stared at the offending appendage with blurry vision. Perspiration slid down his temples, and he was made suddenly aware of the chill running down his back. “I can’t do it,” he mumbled, running reverential fingers over the leather-bound spine. He was shaking, from the drugs or something else he was uncertain. “He would...never forgive me if he found out...I would never forgive
Sherlock followed Andre through the narrow alleyway behind the supermarket. There, tucked behind a dumpster, was a door on which he knocked. After a moment, the lock clicked and Andre swung the door open.
Hey, long time no see. So I know I haven’t posted in like a month, but I really just haven’t had time to write at all these past several weeks. I’m definitely still gonna finish this story, and I’ve got a lot of ideas for it which I just gotta build up to. School and work and college applications have just got in the way. I’ll try to begin updating somewhat regularly again!
By the way, are you boys messaging each other while sitting in the same room?
John only made tea for himself now. He drank it at the kitchen table, head bowed against the cool granite top, as if mentally preparing himself for the moment Rosie deigned to wake up crying.
Redbeard is special to Sherlock. Nothing will ever change that, he knows, yet he somehow fears Mycroft giving him a dog still will. He acts decidedly petulant, but his brother has always been educated in the ways of compensation.
Sherlock hummed in response and curled more tightly into the fetal position in his chair. His stomach cleaved to his ribs, empty except for a pack of biscuits which he had eaten the night before. The thought of introducing anything solid into his stomach induced a looming sense of nausea. He wrapped his arms around himself, cushioning his head on his wrists.
No matter how he tried to handle the Saint Bernard that was his curiosity from wandering around his Mind Palace, he couldn’t seem to shake his own interest. The big dog lumbered from room to room, upturning furniture and kicking up debris in its wake. It always called Sherlock’s attention and he came bounding into whichever room to see the canine. The dog cocked its big head at him as if to indicate simultaneously its displeasure at being ignored and its bemusement with Sherlock’s seeming dilly-dallying. What are you waiting for, it seemed to say, and Sherlock had no answer.
“Be quiet, you git.”
In actuality, soulmates were less gravity-altering. Gazing upon one’s other half was more or less like experiencing a shock of electricity. A current would surge through one’s limbs and inundate one’s core. It would fill one with warmth like only a drawn bath could. It was like the inherent attraction between two magnets. Of course, soulmates could exist without the other; they were less like two halves and more like a pair of socks, Sherlock thought. One sock could function perfectly fine when paired with any other sock, but of course one always strived for a match. It was just better that way, but not a prerequisite for success or happiness.
, but that a catalyst was needed to decrease the activation energy of such an event. Literally, everything around him was already in color, just unobservable by his own eyes. He was so close yet so far. There was nothing about the whole ordeal that didn’t unleash primal fury inside his chest.
Sherlock clammed up, feeling abruptly empty. His chest seemed to crack open like a yawning chasm. He felt short of breath, heart hammering against his hands where they were clasped in his lap. “I’m sorry—“
, don't make me show it...don't let them know that I'm like
At first, when I realized my soulmate was male, I was
shirt!" I shout, and I carefully try to calm the rising edge to my voice. I want my point to get across.
Adapting to life again is making me anxious. Civilian life is so...boring, for lack of a better word. Nearly nothing ever happens, and danger is difficult to come by. The worst thing bound to happen is, what, I get robbed by some
"At ease," I command, and they all assume the position, as do I. "All of you are required to take showers, so go get into a bathroom stall, you sleepy prats."
“Sober,” Sherlock said, giving a gentle half-shrug. “Or trying to be, anyway.”
He stumbled blearily out of the den, hailed a cab, paid the cabbie a considerable amount, if only to prevent him from tattling, and returned to Baker Street as quickly as he could.
He suddenly felt guilty for still
“Fuck,” Sherlock sobbed.
oh again with the capitals.
The cocaine high was beginning to wear off—the second had lasted even less time than the first. Fuck, the come-down was one thing he never missed, except it almost always led to the exhilaration and exaltation only smack could provide.
There was another time where he was sick and sneezed into my mouth...
“Fine, right,” said John. He had finished feeding Rosie, bottle now held under his arm as he got up. “Whatever. I’ve gotta be off to work now. I’m taking Rosie down to Mrs. Hudson.”
"I suppose I do." My fingers clench around the cane, tapping it against the tiles. I'm not even sure why this stranger would even bother with a crippled sod like me.
Sherlock feels the overpowering, primal urge to pull John's lips onto his. He resists. "The moment seemed to warrant it," he shrugs, and his whatever-he-is descends into a fit of giggles that seemingly affects the chemical balance of his brain and contents of his stomach.
John returned some minutes later, flopped himself on his signature chair, and let out a deeply tired sigh.
At John's nod, Sherlock continues,"In that light, I don't find it ridiculous at all. I would like a dance with 'Three Continents Watson'". Mycroft doesn't even hide his amusement at the soldier's embarrassment, a blush creeping up the back of his neck and settling on his face.
He exhales a long, exhausted breath. "What am I to do with you, brother dear?"
He silently nods to me as he leans back onto his cot as well, saying,"Yeah, I'd like a bit of a rest before we go to breakfast."
“Alright,” said Klaas, handing over the items: three eight balls of coke and two one-gram baggies. 12.5 grams of cocaine—that should be enough for a few days worth of highs. The thought of amphetamine sulfate flashed briefly across his mind, as did the alluring image of heroin, but he tamped down his desire stubbornly. Only coke, thought Sherlock,
Another bout of guilt twisted in his stomach. His influence, once again, had managed to disturb John’s happiness. He was encroaching on something special and private by being here, by watching the father and daughter’s comfortable companionship. Once again, he was out of place and at the same time reminded that he was, after all, a difficult person.
Sherlock couldn’t help but laugh a bit brokenly as Molly brandished a watery smile.
Sherlock gave a gentle half-shrug. “William will be on his wrist, so I can’t feel too put off by it. I gave him an equally as common name.”
21 February 11:53
"So, you go a month more without any drug use, you get a case; deal or no deal?"
"Appreciate it," he states, tipping his pint of alcohol slightly in further thanks. I just nod at him before going to collect utensils from the disheveled tables.
"Well, Sherlock...such a nice little chat we've had...may I ask if your answer is yes or no before I leave?"
to get high, but wanted the high of the drugs to forget his guilt. He knew that would only lead to vicious self-hatred and no progress, but shooting up for comfort was an old friend. It made sense to do it; he could fade away from his body, relax, forget reality, and push everyone away all at once. He could be alone and guarantee that no one wanted to stay with him—that he would never drag anyone down.
Curious, Sally tails them further, barely hearing the click of door hinges down at the far end of the hall. She frowns; she's sure the room they're in is a custodial closet. She's even positive it's labeled as such.
Klaas shifted in his seat, hooking his leg over the edge. “Dreadful business,” he deadpanned. He lounged like a feline, eyes flickering from Sherlock to Andre, at whom Klaas nodded before he walked to the edge of the room.
Expectation led to heartbreak, he thought, and settled back down on his bed.
His blogger rises from his chair, soft steps treading towards where the detective is still sat in his respective seat. "That's my line," he chuckles, looking more fond than his voice lets on.
Ya, you should know that by now xxx
I don't glance eagerly down at my wrist to see the arrival of a name, written in colored ink: a color that I can't see, mind you.
—————
Sherlock hummed, hoping it could cover up his growing unease. Talking about things, as John had put it, was something they had never been good at. They were both too sporadic, too frantic, too damaged and brutal. There was an unspoken fragility to both of them, a quality that, if exposed, made them easy to shatter and hard to mend. No, talking about things was not in their nature and often over complicated things that were already too emotionally complex for Sherlock to accurately comprehend.
"If you really want a dance, you will not call me that insufferable nickname." Mycroft thinks his scowling is only minimally effective when he's blushing so much. Sherlock seems to think the same and just holds out his hands invitingly. The doctor lets out an obliging sigh, leaving his mug and paper on the chair's arm to grip Sherlock's hand.
Mycroft was still hovering over him, though his expression was now softened with a hint of concern. Sherlock only now felt the presence of fingers in his hair. They massaged at his scalp with a strange facsimile of love, hesitant and begrudging. “What am I going to do with you, brother mine?” said Mycroft, voice barely a whisper.
Mummy would always tell me of how, when you saw your soulmate, you'd just know that it was them. I'd asked how you could just know by a glance that you and someone else were meant to be, and you'd immediately see the colors, but she said it wasn't nearly as simple as it sounded.
21 February 13:15
21 February 14:31
Sherlock wanted to cry again, but refrained. No part of him wanted to see John at the moment, for fear that John's expression would betray the seeming easiness of his words. Images of John’s potential expression ran rampant through his head: lips curled in a sneer, brow narrowed with distaste, eyes squinted with scrutiny. He feared that John had reached his tether, that this event would finally set him off.
Two weeks went by before John visited Sherlock at Baker Street, little Rosie tucked in his arms.
It's a simple statement, really. It's like saying,"
Sherlock’s hands tightened minutely in his lap. “Yes, but I thought I’d ask about your day. Friends do that.”
Twisting the door handle, phone cradled in his left arm, he calls into the room,"Oi, Sherlock? Got a call from your brother."
He shifted uncomfortably, pressing further into the couch cushion. “It’s fine, John, really—“
of his soulmate’s. If only he could deduce someone without knowing them, or do something equally as brilliant.
He looks almost pleasantly surprised, and the kernel of warmth blooms a little again. I feel glad that my praise can make someone smile like that.
“How’ve you been?” said John, stiffly, without much warmth or any intimation at caring to hear a proper answer.
“Christ, I’ll make you some tea.” John moved to get up from his chair, but Sherlock took him by the arm before he could enter the kitchen. He turned back to Sherlock, face expectant. When silence lingered for a beat too long, he said, “Is everything alright? Has something happened?”
"You're welcome. I'll be downstairs if you ever need me." She continues to smile, closing the door gently before turning on her heel and starting for the exit.
Sherlock pocketed his phone and tried to think about nothing at all.
Hesitantly, slowly, finally, they pull apart, and all he can think to do is press his lips to John's again, yet this stare must not be broken. He has to seize the moment, squeeze it and hold it, because this minute is irrevocably golden.
“You’re welcome,” said John, like an automated voice message.
I sense another sharp sting again as the tool is lodged back in my shoulder, and I look at it this time, despite my better judgement. The metal glints in the sun, and I hear myself hiss as he yanks the pliers from inside.
Victor’s face was visible almost immediately, and he opened the window to poke his head out.
Sherlock was gripped with grief and elation in equal measure. In that moment, soul-sucking and crushing, two thoughts simultaneously came to him:
He slipped another £180 from the envelope and handed it to Klaas. “Two of those.”
“Whatever it is, your color will appear incrementally. It won’t come to you all at once, but rather over time. It will grow in its intensity, so as not to overwhelm you too much.” She smiled in that wistful way she often did when talking about the times before pregnancy and marriage. “I remember how I first saw the color red, and I had gotten headaches in the beginning from looking at it. It takes a while for your anatomy to adjust and take the newfound ability of colored vision into account.”
"Thanks, Mum," I smile.
Suddenly John moved just a tad too quickly, flicked his wrist just a bit too aggressively, produced a noise just a bit too loudly. Sherlock flinched into the sofa, shielding his eyes for the briefest of moments in the simplest of instincts. John’s expression was laced with smoldering fury and intense reprehension.
. No matter if I were to say it or sigh it or shout it or sob it, it would still sound absolutely beautiful to my ears.
21 February 13:44
21 February 13:48
John still awkwardly shuffled about the flat. He still seemed to be strangled by indecision and discomfort. He would still leave Baker Street for hours at a time—when he had no shifts at the clinic—without Rosie. Not once did he ever explain to Sherlock the subject of his ministrations, or the location to which he was traveling. It left a taste like soot in Sherlock’s mouth, made something roil beneath his ribcage. He felt nauseous and uneasy, like his mental turmoil was listlessly affecting his physicality. Then again, John didn’t owe him anything really: his indifference stung, but it couldn’t be helped.
“Thanks for...the syringes.” He gestured vaguely, in an all encompassing way, to which the woman nodded with a very subtle smirk. “
Lips dragging over his china, Mycroft sets his cup and saucer on John's side table. "That's a product of your own doing, brother mine," he says, far too smugly for Sherlock's liking. "You've led a dangerous life formly, so what has caused such a monumental shift in your logic?"
"Hey!" I bark, pushing away from his slobbering mouth;
**Explanation of Absence**
“Be down in ten minutes,” Victor said, smiling as he shut the window.
His condescension is really starting to push all the right buttons, and I know he's doing it on purpose. My eyes narrow vaguely as I turn away to hide the disgusted curl of my lips. I wonder how me and him were even friends at one point.
Turning the knosel off, I step out of the shower and reach for a towel from the rack beside me. I ruffle my soaked hair with it before rubbing it over the rest of my body.
And before the Freak can possibly try to justify their positions, or insult her, or have the last word, she slams the door shut.
; we're leaving soon, John."
"Would you please look after my...pet?" I ask, opening the door and quickly trotting out with an exclamation of,"Much obliged," without her even responding. I tread the sidewalk, exasperated as I pull out my mobile with a quiet mutter.
?" I scowl, my fists clenching at his resounding resolve not to respond, or even acknowledge, my jab at him. I want to scream; I don't need another Redbeard.
He jostled the package in his arms, finding it was as substantial in weight as it was in appearance. It was a plain, inconspicuous parcel, which made Sherlock increasingly convinced that the contents of said package were far from legal.
“I’m sorry,” he blurted.
thought Sherlock with a flushed face and lazy smile.
Stubbornly, I just lift my chin and look out the window, wishing I could destroy their choice of transport with my mind. I can practically hear the smirk melting off of my brother's face as it sounds like he roughly places the cage on the floor.
...," I whimper, and she suddenly looks so tired: so
I turn slightly, registering something vaguely familiar about the voice.
"Come on; let's see it!"
Sherlock stepped past her and walked into the living room, where Rosie was swaddled and fast asleep in her bassinet. John and Mary—Sherlock winced—had bought it and given it to Mrs. Hudson for the occasions when she babysat, which was more often than not. After all, John and Mary had both worked full-time, and Mrs. Hudson was in short-supply of anything interesting to preoccupy herself with.
Rosie sighed, chest rising and falling with her shallow breathing. She seemed completely at ease, either unaware or uncaring of the pair’s proximity to her. Children were so incredibly trusting—the most vulnerable, but also the least guarded.
I was even more surprised that John didn’t heed their warnings. He even, rather, seemed spurred on by them, like the advice to abandon me was ill-advised and unsubstantiated. Which it wasn’t, at least to my knowledge.
, Sherlock thought with a surge of newfound anger.
He nods to me as I pull the key out and turn to face him, saying a last,"See you later," before nodding. He starts off down the sidewalk, waving slightly as I hear thunder crackling in the distance.
“I’m counting on it,” said Sherlock, looking stubbornly out the window. He avoided the cabbie’s stare, which he could feel piercing the back of his head. “Just take me there.” Impatience and desperation flooded his voice. He clenched his hands so tightly into fists that his fingernails imprinted purplish crescent-shaped welts in his skin.
He swallows the lump in his throat. His Adam's apple bobs. He strokes his hands down his robe. "You disliked all of it."
As soon as the question leaves my mouth, Lestrade rubs the back of his neck, a flush rising on his cheeks. I gather data, recalling any information I may have retained to determine what is being left unsaid.
The meat swirled in the salty broth, bobbing around amongst carrots and celery. Sherlock wrinkled his nose. “Not to sound ungrateful, but the last thing I want to do is eat.”
With this fresh predicament suddenly brought to his attention, Sherlock found himself hoping that wherever his soulmate may be, whether they met or not, that he was safe and healthy. He even hoped, if only slightly, that his soulmate was thinking of him too.
"What happened to your father, then?" she questions, reopening her little notebook. "It must've been recently, right?"
I need to sigh to keep my breathing relatively normal, now, thinking too deeply into this.
21 February 14:11
I've researched plenty about how deaths affect a soulmate. The wrist of the counterpart left alive will have its name wiped away, erased forever, like they had never even known they had a soulmate, let alone spent most of their life with them. All colors will be reverted back to dull shades of gray. Usually, a person whose soulmate has recently died will fall into a mass depression, and suicide is usually imminent.
"No, not nonsense, you git. You just don't have any common sense." The fondness sneaks through his sentence, now, despite the scolding.
Something in John’s expression shifted and grew weary. After another moment, sadness folded into his face, distress pulling at his mouth. “Christ, Sherlock. I’m sorry—I’ve done it again. Look, I’m not mad at you.” John’s face made it obvious he would mentally chastise himself later in due measure. “I’m mad that I’ve somehow made you believe that you
It had been hard. No, it had been
You just need practice is all. You seem a bit tetchy. Why don't you text Lestrade for a case?
My resolve gave slightly: the kids did it, always the kids. I wanted to be there for them like Mycroft had been there for me after Father died. Mycroft made me what I am, not that I would pervert Hamish and Rosie in the way I’d been perverted. I wanted nothing more than for John’s kids to lead a normal life. I didn’t want them to end up like me.
John said nothing, even as Sherlock ambled into the living room. He did, however, look up from his book.
"Mummy?" I call, canting my head left and right, scouring our backyard garden. Then, I spot her by a bunch of marigolds, and I start towards her kneeled position as she beckons me over with a wave of her hand. I've never understood her like for gardening as a suitable past time: seems rather dull, to me.
When he and John had lived together years ago, there had been a comfortable quietude in the morning. John would make tea for the both of them, and they would sit in the living room together, preoccupied with their own devices.
get it!"
“Sounds like the flu,” he said finitely, lips twitching into a frown. He relieved Sherlock of the tea once it seemed like he had gotten his fill, depositing the mug back on the coffee table. He then leaned back into the couch near Sherlock, looking him over with a piercing gaze. “You should rest.”
She surveyed him. “One gram,” she said finitely, without pause, voice brokering no argument. She indicated towards Klaas, as if referring to the coke she’d seen Sherlock buy.
“I want to die,” he said aloud, frantically scrambling for the open baggie on the sink basin. He took the spoon and poured another batch of powder in it, and started the process anew.
I pop the treat into my mouth as I replace the wrap over the top of the plate and slip it under my cot. I can't have the others knowing I have sweets; the whole plate would be gone by this afternoon.
Sherlock had spent an innumerable amount of time studying the science of color. He had read about the visible light spectrum, which consisted very broadly of what was known quite quaintly as “the colors of the rainbow”. He had read how the visible light spectrum was simply born from electromagnetic waves, of which cones in the eye were particularly sensitive to and therefore able to delineate. He had even memorized the proposed wavelengths of each color, categorized them from shortest to longest. He had studied photons and frequencies and anything he could get his hands on to help quantify and qualify the reality of soulmates.
There had once been a time where John had said he would trust Sherlock with his life. That, despite Sherlock’s unpredictability and fanaticism, he still knew wholeheartedly that he was protected and secure. Trust had been the integral backbone to their relationship, even when they had first met; it was a testament to their faith and understanding of one another.
A drab silence passes, what feels like infinity to Sherlock(which is utterly ridiculous) but has to have actually only been marked at three minutes as the kettle's characteristic whistle sounds. John slowly, with what looks to be forced calm, pours the boiling water in both cups.
I feel the man's eyes on me again as I look back up, him scrutinizing my cane and leg. A thoughtful hum falls from his lips as he goes back to his notepad and writes something down.
Sherlock grew restless. He paced around the carpet, worried at the fabric of his pajamas, peaked through the curtains, scrubbed a hand through the hair at the nape of his neck. He looked over pieces of papers strewn on the desk, fiddled clumsily with a pen, glanced at himself in the mirror; did anything and everything he could to ignore the knowledge of the drugs nestled beneath the floor, dangerously within Rosie’s reach and John’s scrutiny.
(See the end of the chapter for
In time with the beat, John obediently tries to follow Sherlock's lead. Much to Mycroft's entertainment, 'tries' being the operative word. John was right about the toe-stepping. The good doctor surely means well, he muses, but giving Sherlock broken toes will certainly be the outcome if this continues. Maybe he can buy his brother ironclad shoes if they persist in holding dancing sessions.
“She’s a sweet girl,” cooed Mrs. Hudson, standing beside the bassinet. Her pruned and fragile hand stroked over Rosie’s forehead. “Doesn’t fuss or anything. Always happy and smiling.”
“You scarf even,” she intoned, preoccupied with tending to the flowers. Sherlock ran a finger over the fabric, which to him looked about as dull as it always had. This whole color-business was frustrating, as it were. It was tedious and exasperating to know that every object had so much potential to be and look
Sherlock scowled, but the look lacked its usual heat. Mycroft only simpered, satisfied, then made his way to the front door. “Well, brother mine, I hate to leave so soon, but I have business matters to which I must attend.” He sounded genuinely remorseful, even going so far as to allow the smug smile to fall away. “I will, of course, return your calls if you need me in the meantime. I’m also taking your stash to insure you don’t cave in.”
"John, don't you dare give out on me!"
My anger subsides dramatically at the thought.
Sherlock swallowed, feeling dry mouthed suddenly. His heart settled in his throat. “Yes, I understand, take your time.”
"Currently, I am not deaf, so yes, I did hear myself, but I assume you rather are asking if I know just how ridiculous of a notion it is, correct?" Allow Sherlock to give the longest and most thorough answer possible while still ending with a question.
"His face looked like Glads when I gave him a special treat from out of town for no reason, except because I thought he would appreciate it." The analogy startles even me, and the way I smile when I say it is slightly disconcerting; I
Also, you guys have started asking for a post about our best kisses.
"What is it, Johnny?!" she shouts, a hint of anxiety trapped in her voice.
“For all you pretend like you’re unaffected by the world, you are—deeply. I just want to share that burden with you.”
He’d stashed the drugs and syringes in the loose floorboard beneath the fireplace. He glanced at it every so often, now, as Rosie toddled about the flat. Christ, thought Sherlock,
He laughs, a hysterical sound that confuses and frustrates Sherlock, because what is so bloody funny about his suffering. Soon the mirth softens into something that seems to him a lot like sadness. "You're an idiot. Of course I didn't dislike it."
Sherlock couldn’t help the new surge of curiosity that ballooned in his gut as he blurted, “What color is it?”
"Keep your eyes open, Watson."
When had they been reduced to inane small talk? It seemed like nowadays all they did was dance around one another, talking about nothing of importance and avoiding everything worth actually talking about. There was something despairing and poignant about the situation which Sherlock feared might never be said aloud: that he wished for nothing more than to shake himself from this inescapable bout of babble and talk to John about something
“True, I always forget,” Victor said absently, pitching another stone into the recesses of the lake. It skipped across the surface for a few moments before plunging and making the strange glug sound it always did.
There was something hauntingly familiar and vaguely disquieting about the faint flickering of the cubicle, the blurred lights that illuminated the tiles only slightly. He remembered in the early days of sobriety, wandering into the bathroom and forgetting why he’d come—
Frankly, although I hate to admit to a weakness, I'm scared to tell anyone about my soulmate.
"You lot might be soulmates!" I quip, smirking smugly as his already flushed face morphs into a deeper shade of gray. His embarrassment quickly turns into anger as he suddenly turns on me, eyes wild and jaw taut.
He thought about it for a moment.
He unsteadily took the syringe and flushed the residual solution into the sink basin, then wrapped it in a bit of loo paper and shoved it into his pants pocket.
"What's wrong, John? Let me see it, please?" she pleads, and even though I don't want to, not even in the slightest, I stretch out my arm, allowing her the chance to roll my sleeve up.
forgive me. Sherlock—you shouldn’t let anyone abuse you. Even people who say they care—
He hadn’t seen her since the phone call; since she said she loved him, and since he said it back. Sherlock did love her—
?" I hear Derek breath into my ear, and suddenly, I want to cry.
, Jo-hn..."
They entered a dimly lit room. The wooden steps creaked as their feet shuffled upstairs. Cobwebs shone in the corners of the ceiling. A mustard yellow armchair was nestled in the corner of the second floor, fabric threadbare and faded, and on the chair sat Klaas. His feet were propped up on the arm of the chair, body contorted like a rag doll. His chalky blue eyes gazed out at the nebulous skyline. The groaning floorboards alerted him of Andre and Sherlock’s incoming presence, and the blue eyes shifted from the first newcomer to the second. They squinted with suspicion before widening with recognition as the clouds seemed to lift.
Something foreign and indecipherable swathed over John’s face. His eyes seemed to flicker with a differing emotion from moment to moment, then eventually settled on uncertainty. “Not you,” said John, with an expression Sherlock had never seen.
“Yes, but that doesn’t mean he trusts me,” blurted Sherlock. Dazed and restless, self-effacing and crazed, his filter was weakened.
Sherlock couldn’t seem to voice the intricacy and depth of his feelings aloud. All that came was: “Devastated.”
Often times, when the uneasy tension constricted his throat and stung his eyes, he went out alone on a case to loosen the noose. John didn’t even seem to mind.
I try and drown out the pain, reopening my eyes. I can discern the bodies in the distance, caked with such a dark, thick-looking gray, so much so that they look drowned. They're the ones Bill and the others couldn't get to. The ones
"Oh, God,
I knock my stupid cane against my leg, feeling myself bite my lip as I turn to the window. This flat has barely enough space, even with the little amount of items I've acquired. The sun is a blinding white, seeping through the blinds and causing a shadow to stretch out against the door. I glance at my clock.
It used to be that John and he had a mutual look. John would look at Sherlock, and somehow both would know what it meant. The same raised eyebrows and pinched mouth could be discontented or amused or exhausted, and the subtle nuances were burned into Sherlock’s mind. He would hand John the morning paper without being told; John would make him breakfast and set it on the table, or hand him his phone without being asked; Sherlock would place Post-It notes on the containers in the fridge so John would know which were leftovers and which were experiments. They used to peacefully coexist.
"No," I respond simply, and her pen starts across the paper again. I cross my legs as she finishes her note, peering at the word upside down; '
haven't found John. The number of Johns I've met in my entire existence has been...38, I believe. Since being 14, I've met 24 of those 38.
"So you believe yourself to be the cause of your father's death?" Her fingers tap against the notebook, and I wonder offhandedly when she got her fingernails painted.
"It wasn't about the war...it was about my dad." I glance at Ella to see an actual increment of feeling in her eyes. It isn't pity, but there's understanding there; it's better than sympathy.
I just endlessly wonder when I'll finally get to meet him.
The detective scoffs. "Like there's much of a difference between the two!"
There was nothing left to throw up, but the amalgamation of the bile’s stench and the sight of it made him continue vomiting. His stomach clenched painfully, cleaving to his ribs with each heave. The cold porcelain of the loo chilled his hands, burning his skin like contact with ice.
I don't thank her because she already knows I'm grateful. I don't even ask if I can leave for my new bedroom; she just nods slowly at me, taking her own mug as she walks into the living room, then ventures down the stairs. I hear the soft click of her apartment door as I rise from my chair, starting to my soon-to-be room.
the note.”
It was only after a moment that Sherlock realized John was watching him. There was a curiosity and a sort of intrigue to his gaze, measured and distant. It set something like anxiety aflame in Sherlock’s chest, made him fidget with the corner of the blanket and curl his arms ever tighter around his middle. John’s gaze elicited more heat in Sherlock’s face than the blanket strewn over his shoulders: he had to turn away after another moment, becoming uncomfortable under the intimate scrutiny.
“Will you be alright?” said Sherlock, surprised at himself for asking.
He never thought he’d have to resort to this again. Of course, hadn’t he said that after every relapse? This was just another in a long list of failures.
"I don't know...it just does," I reply, crossing my arms. Her eyes linger on me for a moment before she flips the page of her book and writes something else. I'm tired of trying to decode her notes, so I don't bother looking at it.
Not very much later, footsteps sounded and John, soon after, shuffled into the living room. His eyes landed on Sherlock for a moment, sweeping up and over the expanse of his form, as if in silent questioning. However, he had a sleeping Rosie cradled in his arms, which prevented him from speaking. He quickly made a simple gesture before heading off to, presumably, tuck Rosie into bed.
"How so, dear?" she asks, going back to watching and tending the boiling water. I huff, what I hope can pass as good naturedly, at the use of the nickname.

I let out a large breath, one almost too big for my own chest, but it helps, and I actually relax into the chair. My brother slips his hand away, placing it in his lap, but still tries to placate me with arbitrary, empty statements.
? Bumps in the road? There'll be a lot of those, I'm sure; I've become so accustomed to military life that I almost feel like I...thrive in dangerous situations.
I wince slightly as I respond,"The flow of cases has been...
He wasn’t quite sure how long he lay there. There were no windows in the bathroom to indicate the time of day. The only reason he realized how much time had passed was because he felt the withdrawal coming on.
"Thirdly, no barking unless it is absolutely necessary, such as if you are alerting me of oncoming defecation or the need for sustenance." He yips again, his stubby tail wagging back and forth.
"Get off of me! You have

"I know," he interrupts, pointing slightly to my wrist. "But he may not be the one, Sherlock, and I'm sure if he is, he won't be-can't be-any of the things you said."
I suppose the immediate attraction between two soulmates is helpful, considering the fact that there are many Marys and Johns and Michaels and Lisas in the world, and the colors don't always come right away to confirm your relationship.
Murray sounds muffled, but I can feel his breath ghosting over my face; the feeling is unpleasant. It tickles my cheeks then trickles down my spine, and it's only making me feel colder.

“Why of course not,” I smiled, burying my hands comfortably in my coat pockets. “I bought some of that cologne you’re wearing in an attempt to lure him in, but he just seemed to be
"Would he..." My words are no longer words, just incoherent sounds, and now my breath is hitching and my heart hurts and my throat feels constricted. I need water, or
"Sorry, gotta dash; I think I forget to feed my dog this morning." A calculated lie, and an unbelievable one at that. "The address is 221B Baker Street, and the name is Sherlock Holmes."
Tedious.
FYI, Loretta’s doesn’t exist. Also, I tried to make the price of the drugs as accurate as possible, and tried using correct terminology to the best of my knowledge.
“What else do you know then?” said Lestrade, face sobering and becoming less devastated. The irritation and impatience began to bleed into his expression: I preferred that. Frustration was easier for me to understand than guilt, regret, sympathy.
Oh? Seems quite like it, yet I'm not sure why. All I was doing was blogging like usual.
“Thank you,” said Sherlock past a lump in his throat. He was still fiercely uncomfortable and craving heroin, but this was as cozy as he could possibly feel. “You needn’t attend to me any longer. You’ve got more...important things to do.” He fiddled with the saltine packet and opened it, taking small nibbles from the cracker. “I’m not a child that needs coddling.”
), and he smoothes his hand over my back, shifting the sallows of my shirt. "Everything is fine..."
But Sherlock’s nature was not to shy away from knowledge. Even at the age of eight, knowledge was his weapon of choice. It was a second skin against bullies; the shield he brandished in self defense; the javelin he hurled; the missing puzzle piece to every predicament. Knowledge was power, as his young brain had come to learn. To deny the noise would be to succumb to an irreparable and unforgivable lapse of ignorance. No, he thought, ignorance was unforgivable, but a good dose of suspense was acceptable.
Instead of hating William, I find myself fascinated with him, albeit I've never even seen him. I wonder what I'll first see that's this 'aubergine' color, and what he'll look like, what he'll sound like, how he'll act, if he'll like me. I'm sort of infautuated with him, I suppose.
The cabbie’s look of concern peered at him from the front view mirror. “Everything alright?” he said hesitantly.
"Sex is terrifying," I admit softly. Mycroft tells me I talk in a small voice every time something sexual is brought up. He's probably right on that account. My experiences have always been...less than pleasant, but it's easy enough to ignore when I'm not thinking about it.

"Oh, John, don't listen to what anyone else says...having a soulmate is a wonderful thing, no matter what the person's name or gender. Don't ever let anyone tell you that you're bad because of your soulmate...Who cares what anyone else thinks? You'll always be my little boy, and me and your father will always love you," Mum reassures, and I can do nothing else but smile at her words, even if I don't believe any of them.
...his face is gone..." I inhale, then there's nothing. But it's only a moment before my breath is back. It hurts, it all hurts, and I just want it to
“Oh, Sherlock.” Mrs. Hudson was the only one who could get away with saying his name in such a manner without it feeling like pity. “He has a child now, love. He’s grieving Mary still. I would just give him time to come around.”
“Oh, Sherlock,” said Mrs. Hudson as she opened the door. Her mouth was opened in a delicate shape, indicating her pleasant surprise. “Come in, dear. I’ve just put Rosie down for her nap.”
Sherlock is very clumsy, nipping where he probably shouldn't and using far too much tongue in the process, but the doctor doesn't pull away. He retailiates with an enthusiasm Sherlock is certain prevails his euphoria on even their finest cases. It is wonderful and perfect.
“Maybe you’re right,” he said, setting his mug on the side table. “Maybe I’ve been expecting too much.”
Lock might sound nice. Sher? Sherly; no, sounds too much like a female-

"Yes, Johnny; what is it?"
Hastily grabbing my mobile from the coffee table, I stuff it into my pocket before wrenching open the door and calling back,"I'll be back soon...mutt," and taking the stairs two at a time.
The dull ache in my shoulder seems to fade away as the voices of the medics and sounds of the helicopter trail off. The last thing I register is the sound of the helicopter's blades ripping through the air, destroying the sound barrier.
