<< From Thursday afternoon a real storm is going on >> replies Anthea, who had already carried out the research while her boss was reading the data. << It is not possible in any way to reach Threlkeld and Penrith, the cities closest to the Lake District Ski Club >>.
<< Forget it, George. It is wasted effort! >> Greg says.
<< I do not know, John, but for the point where we are I am willing to accept any type of suggestion >>.
<< And I will take good care to keep it for me >> concludes the detective, by indicating that he has no intention of returning to the topic.
<< You closed the phone in my face, I was afraid you went to look for him alone >>.
<< Mr and Mrs Jackson, do you have any idea of the meaning of the drawing that your daughter has engraved on her arm? >> Sherlock asks them, going straight to the point, leaving out pleasantries and condolences. The two spouses look each other, looking for courage in each other.
<< Shut up! >> John thunders. His voice echoes against the walls. << You screams orders since you arrived and doesn't even know what you talking about. No, now listen to me >> says John, interrupting the chief. << This child is not our son >> he says, pointing the finger at William, who, intimidated, hides behind Sherlock. << He is the son of Albert Ford. Yes,  the man that could ruin your private economy with his death. Our dog found  this child hidden inside his bedroom closet. Mr. Holmes, the consulting detective, is successfully pursuing the investigation. To your knowledge >>, John adds, approaching the chief, threatening. << I am Captain John Watson, ex fifth Northumberland riflemen, three years in Afghanistan, veteran of Kandahar, Helmand and of the damned Saint Bart hospital and now official blogger of the consultant detective Sherlock Holmes. It will be a real pleasure for me to write in my next article how Scotland Yard's chief commissioner gives priority to investigations not to save the victims of a kidnapping but to safeguard his wallet! >>.
<< Oh, your brother thought about recovering them >> says Sherlock, continuing to send and read messages from his cell phone. Lizzy looks amazed at her brother, who smiles contemptuous of the danger. She doesn't yell at him this time. Lizzy shakes her head in resignation before smiling at him.
<< ... and I'm sure that somehow that man has something to do with it. You can clearly see that he hates his workplace from the way he rolls up his shirt cuffs >>.
The fire crackles in the fireplace and a few sprigs of lavender must have been added to the wood. The sweet fragrance expands into the small guest room.
<< You can't sedate him right now that he's recovered! >> he says stopping the nurse's hand ready to inject the sedative into the IV to which Sherlock is tied.
John sighs and a smile is drawn on his lips, one of those that make Sherlock’s heart beat faster. John sits beside him on the bed.
<< Yeah >> he sighs, passing his hand over his tired face. << Well, then we just have to start the game, as Sherlock always says >>.
Mycroft studies him with a serious face and Greg supports his gaze, resolute.
John laughs, biting his lower lip while he draws circles around John’s navel with that long finger.
<< Gentlemen, I renew my request: can you accompany me and my son to Mr. Ford's house? >> asks Sherlock and John.
This, however, continues to send him disconnected images of a distant past.
They leave the 'Speedy' and go into the urban traffic. The puppy runs around happy and gives confidence to anyone who approaches him.  John understand that walking a dog can have its positive sides. In fact, he chatted with three really nice girls. When the first of these asked him the puppy's gender John take a quick look before answering 'male'. To the question: 'What's his name?', John sais each of the girls a different name (Shock. Logan. Jan), to each of which the puppy doesn't answering.
Sherlock stops at the sound of that angry voice. He is trembling from head to toe, frightened, as if that man is chasing him.
"What's wrong with that?" Harriet asks him in his head. John shakes his head to chase her away once more. His sister with her questions almost as sharp as Sherlock's. She with her hidden truths that when they come to the surface do harm, above all harm him. Just like Sherlock's hidden truths. Apparently, the consultant and his sister have many more things in common than he ever thought. They are both homosexuals, both victims of an addiction they cannot handle, both selfish and both born, it seems, to drive him crazy.
<< Sleeping pills. A whole bottle >> continues analytical Mycroft. << Fortunately, she got scared and sought help, finding that of her younger brother, equally scared >> he says, turning his gaze to Geore. Like his sister, the boy also looks away, frightened. << Two kids left to themselves, lost in the desperation of a world that collapses around them, in the absolute indifference of the adults present. Let me tell you, lady, that you are lucky >> says Mycroft, turning his icy gaze on Margaret. The woman, already devastated by what she has heard, looks at him with amazement. << You are lucky to have married an honest, balanced man with a solid morality and strong ethics. A man who didn't kill you as soon as he found out he was betrayed. He is a smart detective and if only he had wanted he could have made your body disappear or turned your death into an accident and be credible to the point of leaving himself clean. Only someone like my brother would have noticed his guilt, but I don't think he would have raised a finger against him >>.
<< Quiet and balanced much more than the two of you >> retorts Greg, approaching the door. << I think it will be more useful than I am at the Diogenes Club >>.
<< That's right >> Sherlock confirms.
<< He works in a case >> he deduces. The order in that room is an indication of an ongoing investigation and therefore of absence of sleep for the only consulting detective in the world. John smiles to himself, shaking his head, as he closes the door.
<< You don't want me to participate in the case and I understand that you are doing it for my sake. But I ask you, please, since the children of a dear friend of ours are involved, to tell me what you found out about the drawing. The few things you and George said this morning are not enough for me >>.
<< It can happen to be injured during an investigation, director. This is the unexpected of the trade >> Sherlock replies, sketching a smile.
<< Come here, what do you do? >> John laughs, getting up in turn. He grabs Sherlock by the hips and brings him back to the sofa. The consultant shouts and laughs trying to free himself.
<< When he was in the recovery community, you mean? >>.
<< I'm sorry >> he only manages to whisper. Sherlock looks at him in amazement and barely sketches a bitter smile.
<< John, come here! >>.
<< Seriously? >> Sherlock exclaims, turning incredulously towards her. << Serial killers are much more interesting >>.
<< It is the only thing that I have not been able to teach him. Maybe because I like to  have him here >> Sherlock admits, sinking his face into the soft fur of the dog. << When I was a child I had an Irish setter and we always slept together. The bed seemed less large and more warmer >>.
‘Mummy… or this version of her, at least, is inconsolable. We’ve spent years searching for you. But it’s time for Mummy and Father to move on. I won’t tell them the truth. They deserve to spend the rest of their days without having futile hopes of ever seeing their youngest’.
Yes, Archie is a mute swan cygnet, so the illustration has been made accordingly.
This night, frustrated and angry, John hunted down and killed two monstrous hounds before going to the chapel to wait for Sherlock, as he did most nights. Somewhere deep inside, he’d hoped his actions would somehow summon Moriarty, since John had been destroying his property. In any case, he felt a bit better after venting his anger on the thrice-cursed creatures. And, of course, Sherlock deduced all of it soon after flying into the chapel. Once he transformed and recovered from it, John could see the younger man’s lips twitching in an approving smile. It lifted the Prince’s spirits a bit more. At the same time, it told him how much he wasn’t ready to leave his martial past behind, despite the life-changing injury.
‘Must you frighten me so?’ the Queen smiled again, feigning shock half-heartedly. She didn’t hate Harry, she hadn’t really cut ties with her, either, even though Harry’s lifestyle wasn’t making their reputation any favours. It was Harry’s own decision to stay away from the royal affairs.
His hands were shaking so badly now that it took him all of his willpower to cook up another dose. It also took him a few failed attempts to ease the needle into his vein properly. So much for being careful and leaving as few marks as possible...
It was only then that he noticed a small, neat stack of papers on the table. Sherlock’s lists for Mycroft… He proceeded to checking them at once. They all had dates, and John closed his eyes for a few moments, suddenly feeling too old and too tired. Sherlock had been using for days on end, several times per day. He was on a fucking drug binge for at least a week and a half! The list with the current date was somehow wrong. It said that Sherlock had taken a mix of heroin and cocaine, but the doses weren’t enough for Sherlock to overdose, even though it would’ve been too much for anyone who hadn’t been using as much as Sherlock normally did, according to these notes and the one John had seen on the plane. So the list, apparently, wasn’t complete for this particular day, and Sherlock had taken something else afterwards, likely heroin, considering his current symptoms and the drugs listed for the previous days.
‘You’re wearing a crown’, the boy noted levelly. In truth, Sherlock had tried to get rid of it twice, just taking it off and leaving it on the altar (the second time he’d just discarded it in the forest, as an experiment), but, as soon as he had turned into a swan, the smaller phantom version of it was back on his head. The next night, as a human, he’d had that same coronet on his head again. He only disliked it because of the fact that Moriarty had given it to him, but he had to admit it looked good on him, and he had grown to treat it as nothing more than a fancy piece of jewellery. He also had to admit he was a bit vain, even though it didn’t make sense here.
The man was watching him with his head tilted, just like the owl a minute ago.
He kept filling his friend’s lungs with air and compressing his chest in hopes to restart the heart, as he had been trained to, as he had done before; not always successfully, because things didn’t always depend on a doctor, regardless of how skilful and experienced they were.
2. In the ballet Prince Siegfried has a loyal best friend, named Benno. I decided that Bill Murray makes a perfect 'Benno' for Prince John.
it was the left one. If the years spent in a body he hadn’t been born with had damaged his mind, he wouldn’t be surprised. Or, perhaps, it had started even earlier in his life. He still remembered his reaction to the vielle and Mycroft…
Sherlock had doomed himself, this time he definitely had… John had kissed him and Sherlock had panicked like an absolute idiot. And now that John was gone, Sherlock was having a full-blown panic attack, to the point that his conscious mind turned off for a while. Later, he found himself sitting on the ground with his back against the tree. He willed his breathing to come back to at least almost normal. With that, the recollections of what had happened earlier came back fully.
was the one who was unwanted; a third wheel. Despite the absolute agony, her words still managed to hurt. She stood up, apparently ready to leave and let him die in peace now. He wasn’t even supposed to be still alive with a wound like this. Perhaps, it was just a matter of time before he drew his last, painful breath. He was rapidly losing consciousness and everything was becoming out-of-focus.
All Sherlock could do was wait for his transformation. Maybe then he’d be able to come up with something. For now, he could only rest. His body never stopped shivering and he wasn’t always entirely conscious, which, in fact, was a mercy. And, just as mercifully, nobody bothered him again, even though he could detect some worried looks directed at him. Most swans were busy worrying about the adolescent that was back at the lake now. Sherlock hadn’t seen how they’d managed to get her there, as she still looked unresponsive and empty-eyed, unless she’d had a moment of clarity the others had used to guide her back. Ironically, it was Beatrice who had survived, while her sister Alison, who had done pretty much everything in her power to hold her back and protect her from danger, was dead now. Beatrice had been left to live with that knowledge.
‘What do you propose?’ John sighed again, becoming serious.
Not everyone in the group could read and not everyone could read on languages that were foreign to them, even though they all had no problem understanding each other. Sometimes Francesca read the borrowed books aloud by the fire where others gathered to listen.
3. The ballet starts with the Prince's coming of age (in some sources it's his 21st birthday). I decided to make it St John's day in this story, instead, because I wasn't sure John would be in such a great mood about his birthday. Plus, it would've been odd for him to celebrate it with peasants in a foreign country (in the ballet the peasants are Prince Siegfried's own countrymen and he has no problem having a party with them).
John could tell that to Sherlock it was obvious that he wanted to talk from the moment the swan first saw him upon entering the chapel. To John it was obvious that the younger man didn’t like it, but he couldn’t very well confront the Prince about it beforehand, without raising even more suspicions, which was counterproductive, because it was raising suspicions on itself. John was postponing the talk, even some time after the swan’s transformation into the human. For the conversation to happen they needed to be alone. As always, Archie was easy to bribe with sweets and another opportunity to shoot a few bolts from the guest’s crossbow. John had noticed the boy’s interest and had given him a few lessons on how to wield a crossbow. He gave it to the boy sometimes to fool about outside, and even helped to build a target for the practice. He did it all on condition that Archie would be careful and would never aim at anyone as a joke. Accidents could easily cost a life to people that couldn’t even leave the place to get a proper help or medical supplies (it was probably a good idea to provide them with the latter next time he visited). John had promised that, if Archie didn’t lose interest after some time, he would present him with a crossbow of his own, probably something smaller and lighter, yet no less durable. While Archie was taciturn with John (or probably with everyone else, except for Sherlock, to some extent, at least), the promise had livened the reticent child up.
Dispirited, the Prince went back to the castle.
And, one day, it finally dawned on Sherlock… He was in love. It felt natural, as if it had always been there, yet special and overpowering. It wasn’t like him to feel this way, but it was about John… With John everything was different. John
And, just as unexpectedly as it had started, it all came to an end when all of them, suddenly, started turning back into swans. At first there was a lot of confusion and slow realisation of what had happened, and then there was panic in the flock. They wondered if they’d had a chance to escape, but missed it due to being absorbed in their amazement and joy, which had made them lose precious time. Sherlock doubted it. Mycroft wouldn’t have had him supplied with all of those things in the chapel if he believed that Sherlock could escape the place. He’d said specifically that Sherlock was trapped (and that, somehow, it was his own fault. But he didn’t want to think about it now that he had a more pressing matter to think of). And, if he wasn’t, wouldn’t have Mycroft waited for the change to happen before taking his younger brother home, if that was possible? Sherlock didn’t want to believe Mycroft would have just left him here either way, whether he could leave the enclosed area or not, even though some traitorous part of him insisted that Mycroft didn’t want to take him home and had got rid of him by not getting him out of here. He knew it was ridiculous and he was simply upset, but he couldn’t help it. He had no choice but wait and see. Maybe the change would occur again if Sherlock entered the chapel ‘when the sun sets’, as Mycroft had said. He couldn’t be sure, but he’d go to the chapel every evening, if necessary. Maybe it were only certain days when it worked. Secretly, he, too, was afraid that he’d lost his chance to do something he should have done, but had failed to discover exactly what, to stay a human and he’d never have another chance.
It took his arm and wing more than a month and a half to mend. It was quite long for a wing, and he blamed transformation. For human bones it was an average time, though. He got rid of the bandage then. It was getting quite dirty and took quite some time to get dry, since, as a swan, he’d started to swim again, so he was only glad he no longer needed it (everything had been itching so badly underneath!). At the same time, it was uncomfortable that his limb no longer had support. He avoided moving his weakened arm or wing too much at first, before he started stretching and exercising it. Playing the violin again was both a good exercise and a relief, because he could play again. Sometimes his arm or wing ached, though, and felt more fragile than it actually was. The wing hadn’t quite returned to normal. Even after the moulting when he had his flight feathers back, a few months later, flying was barely possible, despite the fact that the wing seemed fine, apart from getting tired and a little stiff at times. But even that was a progress, achieved through a lot of work. He consoled himself with the fact that he didn’t need much flying and wasn’t comfortable with heights anyway. Waterfowl needed their ability to walk and swim more than they needed flying, unless they were migrating. Sherlock didn’t have anywhere to fly away, and flying to the chapel was still possible, so things weren’t as bad as they could’ve been.
As soon as the dance was over, he thanked his shy and quiet dancing partner, who thanked him in return, and, with a goblet of wine, ascended the stairs to the inner balcony that covered nearly the entire perimeter of the hall. It was good to watch people dancing and pretend that he wasn’t really a part of the event. He let his mind wander away and simply revelled in the music.
Deep inside, he kept waiting for Mycroft to at least visit him again, but his secret wish never came true. Mycroft had said good-bye. It felt wrong that someone as meddling as his brother would just leave Sherlock like that.
‘Can we go home now? Take me home. Please’, Sherlock whispered, all of a sudden feeling like a little child again. But there were just soft swan noises escaping him. He was pretty sure his brother couldn’t hear any human speech in those noises. It didn’t matter that he was a swan. He just wanted to go home. There was a small pond behind their castle. He could live there and enter the castle sometimes. Who was he fooling, he’d spend as much time indoors as possible! He’d be able to see his family any time he wanted to. It was all that mattered now.
person, as if there was someone specific, someone who had meant a lot, but someone he couldn’t remember), with whom Sherlock would’ve shared anything at all. Everything. He tried to concentrate on this thread of thoughts, but it always felt like he ended up coming to a broken end of that already ragged, weak thread and there was nothing after that. Had that mysterious, faceless and forgotten person ever existed? It just felt like another case of his mind playing tricks on him.
The dinner was quite lavish, even for a rich family, apparently due to Mycroft’s return from some important family business. Sherlock hated politics and wrinkled his nose every time they started talking about it. And, of course, Mycroft was as pompous and important as he always had been.
‘I just thought that, perhaps, Moriarty is bothering you again’.
‘There’s nothing to tell’, the younger man interrupted. ‘You barely know me. I’m prone to such moods’.
A few nights later, however, The Prince’s visit turned into an absolute fiasco.
Fortunately for him, after that everything went rather well; or at least as well as possible, considering the situation the Prince was not aware of. Concerned by Sherlock’s reaction to him being late, he seemed to have started coming to the chapel a little earlier than before, though it was hard to tell whether it was conscious or not.
Two of his new prisoners were adolescent twin sisters and the third one wasn’t related to them in any way. He was a rather young boy, just as young as Sherlock had been when he’d been turned, which was unusual for Moriarty. The sisters were quick to find a bit of comfort with the older pens. But when some swans tried to act motherly towards the young cygnet, he wordlessly protested and even bit someone when they became persistent. Eventually, he was so annoyed by their recurring attempts to take him under their care that he moved closer to Sherlock, without intruding his personal space, though. The crowned swan didn’t mind. He had been just as small as this taciturn cygnet, a child, when he had been brought here, while most other swans had been young adults or somewhat older than he had been, anyway.
‘Sherlock’, the man replied. It wasn’t that he had out-silenced Archie, it was more like he had given him time and opportunity to talk when he wanted to talk, not when he was ‘required’ to.
‘You’re making it worse, darling’, the sorcerer muttered, unperturbed and rather absorbed in his task. When the dark blades of the shears were brought closer to his wing, Sherlock froze and closed his eyes. He knew that, if a wing of a bird had a fragmented fracture, removing the affected part of said wing, or even the whole wing, was a sensible option, in many cases it was the only possible option. Moriarty was going to cut his wing off… The shears in his hand weren’t small, but it wouldn’t be a quick cut, not to mention that he would have to cut through the bones. Sherlock couldn’t even start imagining the pain. There was no way to brace oneself for anything like that. Shock and heavy bleeding were inevitable, but he wasn’t sure he wouldn’t lose his mind in the process to care about those. And, even if he survived the nightmare, as a human he would no longer have an arm. He was so doomed.
They decided not to waste a minute this time and, as soon as most of them regained their senses and overcame dizziness and confusion, they started planning their short trip to the ‘fence’. Francesca was quick to take most of the planning upon herself to both organise everyone and to voice her ideas on their safety, since the hounds were more likely to hunt at nights and, generally, were more active at night-time. They formed a group of seven people and Sherlock decided to join. He was terrified of the hounds, but there was no way he could miss seeing what was going to happen. He seriously doubted they would achieve anything at all, but he wanted to see everything with his own eyes. Others were staying behind, because if there were too many of them, they were more likely to attract attention sooner. The majority of the flock were staying at the lake. There were four of them who were still reeling after the transformation, but two ladies among them were only pretending to feel ill, because they felt nervous that they’d be required to go with the group, and one of them was also a bit lazy to be a part of it when others could do it for her. They just didn’t want others to accuse them of cowardice or of making others do all the work, so they were pretending, just in case. There was nothing really unusual about this sort of behaviour when it came to groups of people. Sherlock bit his lip to avoid deducing them aloud. He just smirked to himself, due to the theatrics of those two and the amount of attention it was earning them. He shrugged it off, deciding to focus on the task at hand.
‘So you have just given your heart to Mary Morstan’, the Englishman sighed sombrely. It wasn’t a question. John frowned a little. Why would anyone meddle with his affairs like this? But, perhaps, the man was an interested party and had a relative who had come here in hopes of becoming the future queen of John’s country. It wouldn’t do to waste their time if they still had some empty hopes of changing the situation. He always preferred honesty to polite lies. At least, the man was in no way intimidated by the Prince's rank, though the stranger could very well be a royal person himself. To John he appeared to be more royal than John himself would ever be.
<< Do you think that Sherlock is not able to cuddle him? >>.
<< The fact remains that she tried to kill you too, proving to be a potential danger and to have been able to take part in some of the murders perpetrated by his family >> Mycroft replies ruthlessly.
<< Well, it wouldn't be the first time >>.
There were also other registers, those on which the hospitalizations of locals and foreigners were noted, who, however, had someone waiting for them. Ms. Abbott had noted the 'kind donations', as she called them, of these people. Hataway had contacted some of them, who had only had words of gratitude for 'that family so kind that took care of me, saving my life'.
<< Dad ... I ... sorry if I didn't come to you, but ... you always talk to me so well about him and ... and I didn't want to worry you >>. George trembles slightly. He barely holds back tears, keeping his eyes down. When Greg turns to him, George barely looks at him, unable to bear his gaze. The detective smiles as he puts his hand on his son's shoulder.
<< I am sorry. I regret all my sins, Mary >> Sherlock mutters.
<< Oh my God! >> he says.
<< Lizzy, now stop it! >> Greg thunders with a tone so impressive as to frighten everyone present. His daughter looks at him in amazement before melting into tears.
<< What is the plan? >>.
<< None of them ever stopped here for the night, Sherlock >> John growls, clenching his fists tightly.
Virgin Mary
What turns out to be a storage room, however, contains only a series of boxes stacked on each other.
<< No, that's not it >> John admits, bringing his hands to his head again.
<< No, Dad, I don't calm down anymore! >> exclaims the girl out of her mind. << I can't stand what she did to you! I can't stand that I can't be with you, even if for a short time. I do not accept this decision and I do not take peace of the fact that even for a moment I thought she was right and that it was fine with you. I thought that you really didn't want to stay with us and that you didn't love us anymore, as she continues to say >>.
John sighs and places his small hands on hers.
<< Mycroft is coming >>.
<< Can you tell us who kidnapped Mr. Ford? >>.
Sherlock observes Mary while, with her usual clumsiness, she tears away the empty vial. Sherlock grabs her hand just a moment before she places the new one.
<< Obviously, the invitation is also extended to your adorable dog. It was good that Morgan was with Billy. I want't imagine how it would have ended, otherwise >>.
<< Actually no. We haven't talked about it >>.
<< Yes, Billy, I have bad news. I watched the video and, to be sure, I confronted Juan and we came to the same conclusion: that man is in shock >>.
<< My doctor, always romantic >> Sherlock smiles, touching John's leg with his bare foot. << Kelly, William's nanny, said I would be an excellent father >> he says carrying on to touch John's leg with his foot.
“I will be satisfied, then, to bring Sherlock home safely" he sighs. These three hours will also pass and they'll go to that house of horrors and there they will find him. John's more than sure. And Sherlock will be alive. Yes, it can only be this way. John wants it to be so.
<< His name is Greg >> says George, pointing to the father.
<< Because I don't want to lose you! >> Sherlock shouts exasperated.
<< You're becoming as nice as Sherlock >> teases him. << So, I will see you get to the crime scene with the puppy?  >>.
<< We must hurry! >> exclaims the woman with a worrying urgency in her voice. Mary take Sherlock in her arms. Sherlock's stomach making a turn and he must play attention to not vomiting on her. Mary seems to suffer no effort in carrying him down the corridor. She puts him on a cold and smooth surface and only when she activates the shower does Sherlock realize that he is in a bathtub. The water takes a while to warm up and when it finally becomes hot it is so pleasant that he can relax. Sherlock gives himself up completely to the water and, with a trembling hand, he grabs a wrinkled soap without any perfume and uses it to wash himself. The broken leg hangs out of the tub and continues to pulsate waves painful and angry. Sherlock try to isolate this pain in a room of his Mind Palace and thanks to this hot shower he manages a little.
<< Have you heard, Mycroft? This is the truth >> the father mocks him. Mr Holmes, however, does not find the support of his older son for his laughter. << I'll tell you what the truth is! >> explodes, standing up, this time, before clapping his hands on the precious wood. << The truth is that I should have killed you when I had the chance. I would not find myself now having a son who continues to throw mud on my family's good name and who squanders my money by buying drugs to 'stop his mind too fast'! As if the scandal that you and Trevor have been done four years ago was not enough already, >> he adds, beating another blow that vibrates, also in Sherlock's chest. << From today you will no longer receive anything from me, William, nothing! I think you are perfectly capable of obtaining from you what you need for that scum poison. On the other hand what could I expect from you? You are a whore, just like your mother >>.
<< I'll join you at Diogenes >> says the detective, approaching his destroyed family.
"I know, Sherlock. Anyway today it is gone. Now she will go down and until tomorrow you will not have to deal with her. Today the battle is over. "
<< I didn't call him, John, far from me to do this. I think he did two plus two and he found that it still does four >>.
<< It was a pleasure to help you >> whispers the man in his ear.
<< From the worst things the greatest lessons are drawn >> Sherlock tells her, handing her a handkerchief.
The woman nods slowly and a long, slow tear falls to mark her cheek.
<< Don't interrupt me, Lestrade! I was very skeptical of the idea that this private detective could really make a difference! Now I am more than convinced. Albert Ford is a majority shareholder in one of the companies in which I bought shares. Do you have any idea how the shares will drop if the kidnapper decides to kill him? >> shouts the chief to Lestrade.
Sherlock does not listen to him and brings the mouse cursor to the 'x' of the 'Laboratory' folder, but stops just before clicking on it. He blinks on the last of the titles present.
<< Dad's one >> answers confidently. << I stopped believing in mom from a long time >> the boy whispers, looking at the tennis shoes.
<< I don't care, Inspector. She may have gotten rid of him recently. The smell of ammonia is terribly strong and therefore recent. I'm not going to waste any more time >>.
<< How does the kidnapping end? >>.
<< You really are Sherlock Holmes! >> exclaims. Sherlock nods and kneels before him. Morgan approaches him and his gaze goes from the consultant to the child.
<< We are facing a single kidnapper. Sherlock come  through the main door. There is no signs of intrusion, so Ford opened the door for his kidnapper. It is possible that Ford knew him, because his footprints are regular >> Sherlock says pointing to the signs on the floor. John, Greg and Morgan follow him closely. << At this point something must have happened >> Sherlock says, stopping near the footprint of the kidnapper's feet, distant from each other and more marked, as if he wanted to anchor himself better on the ground. Sherlock looks around, embracing the whole room with his eyes to analyze every corner. << Here it is! >> Se says, pointing to the ceiling.
At the rhythm of his man's regular and calming heartbeat, Sherlock sees in his mind the child and the puppy running happily, chasing butterflies and chimeras. As he used to do with his faithful Barbarossa, friend, brother and confidant. Sherlock finds himself happy to have allowed William and Morgan, the new pirate couple, to start boarding for new adventures.
<< What a funny hat! >> exclaims, trilling like a child.
John shivers. He woult like to jump at the neck of that useless homunculus who has deigned them only with grimaces of disgust and looks of sufficiency since they arrived. Greg puts his hand on John's shoulder beforehand.
<< Yes, now yes >>.
Sherlock wakes up in sudden silence. Heavy silence. Spectral. After days of perennially vibrant glass and shaken by the wrath of the wind, of screaming and chilling drafts, of wooden crunches, sometimes so strong as to make people fear that everything could collapse on him at any moment, now silence reigns.
<< Give me some satisfaction >> Sherlock says to John, continuing to hold him against the wall.
<< So, Mr. Fox, how is the operation? >> Mycroft question, which has not escaped his brother's attitude and the journalist.
<< This will make you feel better >> she says, smiling sweetly.
<< A sect >>.
<< Mary, could I take care of it? >> he whispers carefully, studying the woman's words and reaction.
<< Hey, do you agree? >> asks and the puppy barks. The girl laughs amused and gives to the puppy a piece of bread.
<< About what? >> he says without taking his eyes off the booklet. John wrinkles his face and takes a deep breath.
<< Oh my God, how blind you are? >> Sherlock replies, shaking his head in a theatrical way. He grabs John by the arm and brings him to the wall. << The victim has very evident bruises on his left biceps >>, he says, grabbing John’s biceps with his hand, << a sign that was held firmly by a man's hand. The victim also has a bruise less marked but still visible on the left cheek, which tells us that the killer must have kept it this way >> he says, placing his left hand against John's cheek. << And another on the right collarbone where he rested his elbow >> he says, leaning against John. << It is possible to deduce that premises on him with considerable force. Do I have to go on or is it clear enough? >>.
<< Yes, a man in his fifties >>.
<< Do you think it is appropriate to warn his brother? >> whispers.
<< Are the photos and the piece of cloth important? Really? >> asks the boy excitedly.
Sherlock seems to wake up to his touch. He turns his gaze on him.
George's face squeezes like a sponge and in an instant flies to Greg's chest, hugging him tightly while giving vent to tears. Greg supports him, cradles him with the same sweetness with which he held him in his arms just a few years ago. In the nights of fever and ailments. In moments of fear and nightmares. Following quarrels and tantrums. But even when he simply fell asleep peacefully feeling safe and protected in the strong arms of his dad.
<< And you did it >>.
<< I can't stand rapists. Even less  who allowing them to perpetrate their crime and, above all, who try to make their own profit from it >>
Sherlock turns to William, who laughs cheerfully because Morgan licks the residue of milk and biscuits from his face. John see  the heartbroken sigh that Sherlock tries to disguise.
<< John, it's true, I haven't treated my machine well in the last ... let's say twenty years. This, however, does not mean that I want to be abused by a perfect stranger. I prefer to have you behind me >> he concludes, winking.
The first clear memory John has is that of him sitting on this same chair in this room. His hand clenched in that of Sherlock asleep. John's look to move at regular intervals from one monitor to another and then move on the face of his friend, on which there has always been a serene expression after all.
<< Oh, forget it, I'm digressing >> laughs John, caressing Sherlock's nose with his own again. << Is that okay for you? >>.
The woman stops suddenly. Here is the catatonic state, indicating an ongoing reasoning.
<< Are you sure? >> John whispers to Sherlock, noting his shining eyes.
<< If the stork doesn't bring them, the bushes will think about it >>.
<< It is not true >> he replies, by moving his pelvis in an attempt to free himself. The rubbing it produces is pleasant and with satisfaction John sees Sherlock's cheeks turn red. << Do you want to leave my hands free or not? >> asks him, embarrassed.
<< London >>.
<< Thank you, dear. I will have more time for the research that I am carrying out with Captain Watson. He is a doctor, you know? As was your father >>.
Sherlock sees a body lying on the pavement at a fair distance between the car and the gate. Lying on his stomach. The head pours into a pool of blood that still expands.
<< If this is how you like it, I will give you so many punch to make you pass out >> the man roars, bringing another punch that Sherlock dodges.
<< Oh my God, you won't be talking about pedophiles >>.
<< Close them. I'll keep my eyes open >>.
The woman turns and stares at the photograph for a long time, before exploding with a loud laugh.
<< That absurd story! >> exclaims shaking his head.
John stands up and goes to the bedside table to pick up the phone.
<< So I don't have any clothes anymore? >>.
<< Oh >> the consultant  feels his heart beat mad. << It really took, thank you >>.
Mary hits the door with those hammers that are hers hand. She punches, grunting and laughing together. She suddenly stops. She stops hitting the door and making any other noise. After a long silence, Sherlock hears her go away, go downstairs and exit the front door.
<< I will report to the chief commissioner >>.
<< I've attended saunas and Turkish baths. They have significant health benefits >>.
John watch the flames dancing just as it did on Sunday morning. That morning, he shifted his gaze at almost regular intervals from the flames to the pleasantly asleep consultant on the sofa. John had spread a blanket over Sherlock, that he had snuck into. Sherlock had a serene smile on his face and slept as John had never seen him do in this long year of connivance.
<< Too many >>.
<< Moriarty! >> John exclaims. He feels the weight of that explosive-laden jacket on him. In the belly the fear that the sniper fires making him blow up. Fear that then gave way to determination, when, with that exchange of glances with Sherlock, he said him that he was ready to die in order to stop the mad criminal consultant.
<< You are very dear to me, why should I not behave well? >> Sherlock asks her, feeling his heart beat faster.
<< Not the storm, Mary. My life. She will take me to the pit as soon as the snow stops falling >>.
The memories of those terrible days spent between cramps, retching, high fever and hallucinations invade Sherlock mind. He doesn't want to go back there. He doesn't want to fall prey to his nightmares, not yet.
<< Let's go and see if Morgan and William agree >> Ms O'Hara says, confirming to them that Morgan will be in good loving hands.
John feels he has blushed and is mortally embarrassed.
<< Don't worry, Sherlock agrees. But tell him to take a breath: it's a little too rigid >>.
John can't take his eyes off her. This woman have a face so strange and a body so massive as to arouse a curiosity without any education, John realizes it, but difficult to drive back down.
<< Yes, but I'm more sorry to have woken you up >> he says cautiously.
<< Yes, she certainly doesn't go unnoticed >> chuckles Hataway, who has noticed the effect that woman has unleashed on John.
<< Oh, Jesus, yes >> John sighs, letting his head dangle in his arms. << He ... was so peaceful. Quiet. Different from the usual, in short, and I ... I got scared, Greg. I was afraid of him >>.
<< Will you tell my father, Mr. Holmes? >> George asks him worried.
<< Call me Sherlock >> says Sherlock, smiling at the child.
"Alright, I know you are hurting bad so we are putting you on the good stuff. This is Fentanyl, it's much stronger than morphine and it should keep you nice and comfortable. I'm going to give you a one hundred microgram injection to your central line in just a moment that will probably knock you out pretty quickly and you will be getting regular doses for the next few days. I am attaching this button within distance of your thumb. If you have pain, press it and it will automatically dispense ten micrograms into your central line, and you can have a dose every fifteen minutes. If that's not enough use this button in your other hand to call the nurse and she already has my approval to increase as necessary. Don't try to be a hero, you've already done that and now your body needs to recover. The best way for it to do that is for it to do as little as possible, and that includes communicating with itself that you are hurt. All your medications and nutritional needs as well as any blood that needs to be drawn can be handled through your central line. You can also call the nurse for mouth swabs and small amounts of ice chips, but I'm afraid you won't be eating anything for a while. Though with hospital food I doubt you will really be missing much. Do you have any questions?"
"I know."
John gave up, Mycroft couldn't be reasoned with, it was free, someone else was cleaning up the mess, and he needed a cup of tea. “Come on Sebastian, cup of coffee, and lunch on the house.”
They ducked back under the tape to Sally's puzzled look, and made their way straight to the line of press. Bulbs flashed dozens of times a second and reporters started shouting a hundred different questions. Sherlock just stood there waiting patiently for two whole minutes before the racket died down, none of them had noticed they were no longer able to leave. Sherlock raised his hands for silence and every last one of them shut up. In a smooth, clinical tone with absolutely no hint of his public school accent, he spoke to the crowd.
“What?”
"Are you a prince uncle John?"
They all marveled that their patient was still breathing, and Mark insisted they double date sometime, he wanted to see what Sherlock was like for himself if he'd managed to get 'Three Continents Watson' to settle down and be monogamous. If nothing else than to get together when there wasn't a dying man between them, maybe more dinners and drinks acting like normal blokes instead of super surgeons.
“Well, that was exciting. Might I ask what you might have done to have hooligans throwing bricks through your windows during lunch time?”
John sighed, Mycroft still had him on a total communications lockdown aside from that one phone call he'd allowed. John honestly wondered if it was more to punish John himself, or to torment Sherlock for some unknown petty reason. Neither answer would surprise him, but he hoped Sherlock was doing alright.
"Colonel William S. Davis MD, senior medical officer here."
Having long since gotten used to Sherlocks' mad dashes off, he pulled out the takeaway hot cup he'd taken to keeping on the tray and poured in Sherlocks' just delivered order. Handing it off as Sherlock shoved a random few bills from his wallet into his hand and John also passed him a folded pastry bag before he ran for the door in glee to tell Lestrade. There was a bacon, lettuce, tomato and cheese sandwich on eggy bread with packets of mayo and mustard inside, ready for when he wanted it. "Case is done, eat something, you've earned it."
In the bathroom, Sherlock removes his clothes entirely and takes stock. Pressure abrasions around his wrists, more so on the right when John had immobilized his dominant hand behind his back, it would bruise on the inner wrist, easily covered with long sleeve shirts an inch longer than he usually wore them. Left shoulder, strained from wrenching, be easy on it the next few days. Another pressure mark on the back of his neck from John's forearm to hold him down, insignificant, it would disappear in the next few hours. Bite mark on the back left shoulder, broken skin and bruising, disinfectant and a bandage, invisible under a darker shirt. Several marks on the pelvis and hips from the table edge and John's hands, most would bruise, wear trousers with a slightly higher waistline so they aren't irritated. Bruises already forming on kidney marks, sleep on side or stomach the next few days just in case. Anal discomfort from friction and hard penetration, ointment, briefs, and some paracetamol tablets. And finally, crescent-shaped mark on his left cheek from the blasted mug. Definite bruise, dark purple and red abrasion, small cut but not truly bleeding, already swollen. Annoying, hard to hide, possibly a plaster, wearing hair a bit more forward, maybe even makeup. Annoying. All in all he's had it worse, but the ones he has are still going to be noticeable over the next few days.
“Shatter resistant glass. It has a protective film on both sides so that such a thing cannot happen again. It can withstand tornadoes and hurricanes, bricks should be no issue. It's a gift of course, nothing to concern yourself with.”
"What on earth are you doing Sherlock? They'll all have my head for this, not to mention my boss!"
"D-di I loos leg?"
Six Squad Sunday was the worst day Mark and he had ever had working together. It was the year before he was invalided home. Four separate squads had come under direct attack, and two squads had an unfortunate encounter with landmines that day. The wounded were coming in not even an hour apart from each other, and they were the closest med station available within fifty clicks in any direction. They had only been able to save two of the thirty-five critically injured soldiers who had been transported in that day. They were short on supplies, people, transport, and worst of all, time. It was a complete no win situation and after that thirty-four hour nightmare shift, John had gotten drunk. Not just any drunk, but I-can't-even-move-let-alone-think-about-walking drunk. They had broken into Mark's private reserve and polished off three and a half large bottles of fine Irish whiskey together. John had a feeling they both would need a drink after this one too.
He had wanted to scream at John, grab him by the shoulders and shake some sense into him, and when they got home he had challenged him, tried to force John to see reason, that he could never be among the lowly, that he was so far above them they couldn't even dream of touching him, let alone of dragging him down to their ranks.
"Is it even legal for him to do that?" Lestrade questioned.
"I don't want you to go. Please John."

“That sounds very like him. So what's the point? You aren't telling me all this just to reminisce on your youngest brother. There's something else.”
"I didn't want you getting charged with assault of an officer and carted off to jail because it would have made Anderson's fucking DAY! And it's not insinuation when it's true Sherlock."
Dear M, Sorry you don't like the fact that John said 'gods' instead of 'God'. And FYI it has nothing to do with me being narcissistic and trying to insert myself into my character, and stand out as being non-christian/ pagan/ 'look at me I'm a special snowflake!' or whatever. I intentionally use it in most of my writing so that I am not singling out a particular deity of anyone's faith in order to be respectful of people, and it tends to be less harsh of an expression. Not to mention a lot of people are polytheistic, not just pagans, do your research. So I'm sorry that's what you are using as a basis to leave this story over, my suggestion is to not make assumptions about the author's intentions, and also don't assume you know someone based on one word you read out of context in a work of fanfiction, it's an insult to your own intelligence, not mine.
"So John, this seasonal house favorite of yours, is it a mocha with added toppings?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Lestrade felt rather warm inside just knowing a man like John, it renewed his faith in humanity a bit after being exposed to such an ugly side of it with what he did for a living. Sherlock had a strange little look on his face, one might almost mistake it for fondness if one wasn't talking about Sherlock Holmes. Lestrade knew that he himself was the closest thing to a friend that Sherlock Holmes had, somewhere on an invisible fluctuating level between Benign Disdain, and Tolerable Idiot. But the look on the man's face right now as he looked at John, had all the classic signs and subtleties of a five year old wanting to help someone with a push on the swings or give them a boost onto the climbing frame just to have an excuse to say something to them or get closer to them. Sherlock Holmes was interested in another person, and that's something that just doesn't happen.
Sherlock glanced up the stairs where John was coming down.
John and Moran shook hands, it wasn't nearly the same as what they used to chase down and neutralize, but the rush was almost the same, and the reaction was the exact same: react when attacked, assess threat, neutralize threat. They both understood it all too well.
"Oh come on Lestrade not even you can be that blind! Look! Leftover food, an office that isn't opened until after closing time, the staff are all college students! Of course, it's so obvious, you can take away a surgeon's tools, but that doesn't mean he's not still a doctor."
"Multipurpose usage license, and you'll notice he isn't running both at the same time, and that the clinic is technically separate."
The door opened and clicked shut and a second later the hood was pulled off right before he was slugged across the face. Thank gods Mycroft had probably never truly been in a fist fight before, he missed his nose entirely and hit him square on the cheek. Hurt, yes, but he'd had far worse. It probably wouldn't be a good idea to laugh and tell Mycroft his sister routinely drew blood with one punch when she slugged him. Well she had until their mother told them that if Harry threw the first punch, John was allowed to hit back whether she was a girl or not. A few busted lips and noses later and Harry had stopped hitting him altogether.
Half past noon and it was a quiet lunchtime for any cafe. Only ten people. He knew why and it angered him, he didn't think any business that had to resort to such things had any business being open. He chased off the crowd of delinquents standing a door down on either side of his shop, scaring off the customers, and bringing down sales considerably. This time he really scared them, he walked out with a digital camera, took their pictures and made sure they saw him do it. They immediately took off, trying to hide their faces, but he had them on camera. John smirked and resumed working.
He runs a hot shower, lets the heat of the water help soak away the ache in his arm, lower back, and hips. When he finishes he dries himself and tucks the towel around his hips before making his way gingerly to his room for some clean clothes. When he opens the door, John is waiting for him on his bed, he knows John saw him flinch and grip his towel tighter, as if it could protect him. With sad, almost destroyed eyes John holds up the first aid kit.
James nodded.
Sherlock is no ones punching bag, he always has to be in control of every situation even when it seems like he isn't. You probably know this better than most. You aren't abusing him John, for whatever reason he’s got going on in that head of his, Sherlock has been goading you into your actions and you've been reacting exactly how he wants you to, probably from the very start. I couldn't tell you if it's for an experiment or if it's something he likes, all I know is that things aren't what they seem. He's the one who has been hurting you, though as I said before, it’s likely he doesn't understand it. I would tell you not to be mad at him, but I know I was pretty upset when I found out. It's why we had you brought here, we wanted to give you some time away from him in a safe place, to tell you the truth, and to let you have some time to process things before taking action. Mycroft thinks very highly of you, enough to bring you here, which I have never known him to do before.”
Moriarty actually chuckled and then turned to John.
I accidentally combined chapters 3 and 4 before, so I separated them, sorry for any confusion.
"Very much. Though I'm wondering where that hint of butter flavor is coming from, the marshmallow whip?"
So John told them about the other restaurant, and it's habit of making the neighborhood impossible to survive in, and how its favorite method was to drive other restaurants into bankruptcy, or to intimidate them out. What it had done to several other places that hadn't even lasted a month, but that he hadn't started doing anything until it had been the Bistro in A Bientot's sights, and then on the chopping block, and now they were doing the same to him.
John never stops until this proud, cold, brilliant man is impaled on his shaft, writhing and whimpering as John slams his hips home and bites harshly into the junction of his shoulder or arm, anything he can reach, hard enough to taste blood. He doesn't stop until he knows that Sherlock has been made to feel it, him, something, anything... until Sherlock screams. That's when he cums. He ALWAYS cums when Sherlock screams like that, when his body is covered in marks, his wrists or hips or throat bruised from John gripping them, clothes disheveled or ripped and still uselessly clinging to those impossibly long limbs, and his eyes, if he can see them, filled with pain. Gods what kind of monster is he?
When John's entire focus is on him, it becomes his drug, and he can't ever get enough of John. He knows he can't, and he doesn't want to. Maybe this is love, maybe this is the madness that poets and lovers have written about for millenia that he always used to scoff at. If it is, then he's okay with it, he understands, he finally knows WHY it can drive people mad, or sane, or both at the same time and they accept it. He wouldn't mind it either if it means he gets to keep this.
A pager began beeping uncontrollably and Mycroft immediately went for his belt. The fact his eyebrows rose momentarily was enough to worry John. The world was ending somewhere if Mycroft actually managed to look worried like that. A beat, then another, before a signal was given and John's hair was released and the knife removed.
"After all of my leniency and generosity, is this really the gratitude I receive in return John, Sherlocks' physical and sexual abuse? Given your complete and utter repetitive failures in this endeavor, perpetuated by your own two hands no less, can you give me one singular reason as to why I shouldn't kill you right now and leave your worthless corpse to rot?"
I did my best to wrap up all of the plot lines for this story. I wish I had gotten to explore certain aspects of it a bit deeper, but the plot bunny just wasn't having it. But I think that you would rather have a finished as I can make it story instead a forever unfinished one. I truly loved this prompt. Thank you so much to Axelle for originally asking for it. I hope that I at least made it worth the wait.

“You completely manipulative BASTARD, you fucking
Mycroft looked puzzled.
Because offsetting angst with sex is always a good thing.
"Are you Uncle Mycroft's boyfriend?" The little girl demanded with all the imperiousness she could muster while clinging ever tighter around Mycroft's neck and locking her ankles around his waist. "Because he's MINE."
"Perhaps. What do you think John? Did we kiss and make up?"
Sherlock probably knew exactly where they were when they arrived, but John had lost track some 20 minutes previous. Harcourt had turned off the lights a good 2 minutes before then, and sure enough, a large crowd of reporters was waiting at the barrier.
The murderer was re-enacting something, like a macabre and demented play that slotted his victims into the roles of either people who had tormented him in the past, people he had already killed and wanted to kill again, or possibly even both. He dialed Lestrade, grabbed his coat and laptop and rushed out the door. It was a mistake to have gone along with Lestrade's request of not doing more than finding an exact cause of death the first time, he would have caught that the first time if they had given him longer at the scene and then Anderson had distracted him completely. The autopsies and toxicology reports would take too long, he needed to see all the bodies and the exact layout of the crime scene again.
"Is he really so strict he won't even let you guys have music on the road?"
"I'm really not picky, I like most anything really, something I don't have to rush away from the middle of, I consider a treat."
Mycroft was smirking at him in a most mischievous way. "Careful John, or I will have to tell Sherlock that you are flirting and giving flowers to pretty girls behind his back."
"What on earth are you talking about? I threw you at a bleeding man and arranged for a helicopter and that's about it, you and the others are the ones who saved his life."

"I'm not going to chase you off or anything, but I'm just letting you know I'm going to have a few customers coming in you might not have expected. You're welcome to stay if you want to, but I have to ask that you ignore them, they tend to not trust strangers and can get jumpy if they think you are staring at them."
“So John, what do you think so far?”
The End
His mum was abused by his father, and he's studied injuries, forensics is his life's work, and so he knows, he just KNOWS that the horrid looking crescent-shaped bruise, semi black eye, with the small cut in the center on Sherlock's face that was revealed when he took off the mask and the plaster fell off with it, wasn't from a fist, and with the lack of marks on his knuckles, if Sherlock had been hit, he didn't fight back. He remembers with vivid clarity the night his father had backhanded his mum in the face with a vase, and the day after it looked startlingly similar to what Sherlock's face looks like now. Then he saw the man reach for his coat and the bruise around Sherlock's wrist, his skin so fair that it was showing individual finger marks, made him gasp.
Sherlock grinned, kissed John on the cheek, and grabbed up all of the evidence. “We'll celebrate your recovery as soon as they're in jail John!”
"It's a pleasure to meet you Mrs. Hudson, Sherlock has spoken of you very fondly."
Warning, this story is extremely Explicit in the food porn area, I mean seriously, it's practically obscene. I highly recommend having snacks nearby for protection.
Wrong. Thing. To say. John's fists clenched, and he began making a move towards Mycroft, but this time Sherringford was ready, having taken John's previous threat to heart. He pressed a very restraining hand across John's chest, and purposefully stepped forward, placing himself between John and Mycroft before offering a hand to help his younger brother up from the floor. Mycroft had barely gotten his feet under him before Sherringford landed a forceful but controlled punch to Mycroft's midsection, enough to wind him, but not enough to cause true damage. He then sat Mycroft back into his chair so the man could try and recover a bit. He had obviously knocked the wind out of him good and proper.
Sherlock set down his tea and leaned back.
"Yes. I don't know if he'll ever make a full recovery, but he's not a vegetable, and that's more than almost any other doctor would have diagnosed for him on arrival. Congratulations, you saved a man's life Mycroft."
Sherlock applies the plaster, then swallows the tablets before applying the ointment and putting on briefs and pajamas, very much not in the mood to do anything the rest of the day that would require going out or interacting with other people. He curls into the covers and decides on a nap. It's an hour or two later when he wakes up, puts on his dressing gown and slippers, and emerges from his room in search of tea and whatever food he can smell cooking, only to find a guilty eyed John setting down a cup of tea just the way he likes it, and two plates of chicken, potatoes, and peas.
"I don't get it either. The location isn't hidden, The sign is visible and welcoming, it's near a main thoroughfare, and only a block away from the tube station. I wonder how he advertises. Have you told the people at the Yard? People are far more likely to go to a place a friend has suggested or rates highly, than one recommended by a stranger."
"I observe, and he and I have talked several times. He was a combat surgeon, got shot twice on his last deployment to Afghanistan, received commendations, moved up a rank, then didn't heal up as well as he'd hoped, was invalided out, couldn't continue as a surgeon, and opened this place with his limited pension money. He lives in a studio apartment upstairs if I'm not mistaken, and I know I'm not."
"Yes! Fucking bastards never said a fucking thing about any fucking cops!”
He called Lestrade, who directed the police cars to his and then Moran's location. Moran was just sitting smugly on the small of the back of the one he'd pinned face down on the grass in a nearby park, idly picking dirt out from under his nails until the cops showed up, and looking like a guard dog who had neutralized the intruder by simply squashing him into the ground, and was just waiting to be praised and patted on the head for a job well done.
John smiles at the dapper gentleman and his assistant as they come in promptly at seven just like always. "Good morning Mr. Mycroft, a booth is ready for you if you will be staying today."
Chapter 6 should be up around Monday or Tuesday when I am on self prescribe bedrest after my company leaves, because I will no doubt be broken, and what better way to recover?
Even so much later, Sherlock couldn't figure out just why that had made his pulse race so fast he was dizzy, how the simple application of soap and water with a flannel that wasn't held by his own hand, could be so completely enthralling, arousing, and sensual. It hadn't been a sexual experience for John, yet Sherlock had been so achingly hard that he'd had to bathe his own genitals to prevent embarrassment, a move he would later regret wholeheartedly. He had been trying to recreate the experiment ever since. He wanted to know if it was the fact that it had been John's hand touching him, or the fact that the experience had happened in a bed and his instinctual brain had taken the act as sexual, or if it was a combination of those and other factors that had made the simple act of John giving him a sponge bath, the same as countless nurses around the world gave their patients everyday, the same as he had experienced himself a few times during his lengthier visits in hospital, into one of the most singularly stimulating, arousing, and wonderful moments of Sherlock's life.

A/N: So Happy Yule/Winter Solstice to all of you, I hope a 7,000+ word chapter less than a week after my last posting counts as an acceptable gift to you, even if it might have been more Halloween appropriate with all the gory bits in it. I hope that you enjoy celebrating the wintertide festival of your choice with the people that you love and that you all have a safe and happy new year.
This wasn't just 'a bit not good', this was Bad. This was an unforeseen complication, and it was driving him absolutely MAD. He wanted to pace, to think, to scream, to kill Anderson, (though slashing his tires had made him feel slightly better), and part of him wanted to smack John too, but what he really didn't want to do was admit that this was his own damn fault for not seeing it sooner.
Sherlock was being abused. It finally made sense, the annoying bids for attention, constantly trying to prove his importance and self-worth, the ridiculous coat and scarf even in summer, the... the split second guilty look in John's eyes when he came out of the room and flinched at seeing Sherlock's face...
"Near the door?"
"Good, when you wake up again a primary care physician will come in to talk to you about the details of your surgeries and to discuss your options. You're scheduled with your orthopaedic surgeon Dr. Wheaton tomorrow morning, to discuss the other surgeries you are scheduled for once this infection clears up. We also have a vetted trauma counselor on hand if you want to talk to someone once we unwire your jaw, and we can easily arrange for the clergy member of your choice to visit you if you are a religious man."
John opens his eyes and stares at Mycroft in astonishment.
<< Why do you tell me about him? >> asks him annoyed.
<< It is the first time that such a thing happens to me >> says Martin in that low voice that Sherlock well remembers.
<< Good boy who finished all the food >> she cheerful chirps, rising from the chair. She takes the tray and goes to the door. << Given the huuuuungher you have, double portions for you tonight >> she chuckles, heading to the door. The woman turns abruptly and her face returns hard and expressionless. << It was to your liking, right? >> asks him and the consultant nods.
<< You don't… don't you digest that I smoke during a case? >> asks him amazed. John nods, realizing how stupid the thing he just said is. Sherlock smiles and shakes his head.
They touch the ground, finally. The impact is strong to the point of creating a twinge of intense back pain. The backlash of Moriarty's body that falls on him takes Sherlock's breath away.
<< I don't smoke, you know >>.
<< It will be your word against mine >>.
<< Here are the stories you told me on the phone, John >>.
<< I ... I don't know. I think so. In her way. She ... she wasn't very affectionate. She liked my hair >> Sherlock says, sketching a smile.
The drawer contains a bulky and overflowing red folder, that the consultant pulls out with difficulty. He opens it and he, William and Morgan sink their noses into the contents.
Mycroft finally grants a proper look to John and frowns, leaving the documents in his hand on the precious wooden table.
John blinks several times and a funny expression of amazement is drawn on his face. Sherlock does not wait for an answer from him. He walks the streets of the Pall Mall neighborhood, where the Jackson reside, headed for Trafalgar Square.
<< Thanks, Mary >> remembers to thank her and she blushes.
<< This is just a hypothesis, Greg, and I don't like not having at all certainties! >> John says, standing up again. << Jesus, how is it possible that, after the first ten years of the new millennium, there are still problems in communicating because of the weather? >> blurts out, kicking a chair. From behind the venetian blinds, pulled down but open, John sees the agents peeking at what is happening in their boss's office. They are curious to see the usually calm and patient doctor alter, since there is not even the 'freak' to justify his behavior.
<< Yes... we wouldn't have done it >>.
<< How about getting to know us better? >> asks Martin, but He doesn't waiting Sherlock's  answer and he rushes against him. Sherlock kicks him in the lower abdomen.
<< I ... I don't want anyone else to be involved in this challenge that he launched me >>.
Behind them, Albert Ford exits the corridor, leaving the room that hosted them. His shoulder is bandaged, his arm supported by a bandage and he walks with difficulty.
John's stomach boils with anger. So much anger and so much annoyance at the idea of being there, unwanted intruder in front of a silent flirtation.
<< You are a disaster, look at yourself! >>.
<< Nobody? >> insists the woman, becoming even more wary.
<< Oh, silly >> chuckles Mary, moving her hand against his face. << The storm is over. There is always silence when it ends >>.
<< Do you see that overturned table? >> points to it with his finger. << The student's homework of my mom was there. It was a very high pile of short stories that she corrects every evening. Before I went to bed, yesterday, the homeworks were there and she promised me that she would come up to read me one that she thought was really nice. Mom knows that I like crime stories and when some of her students write them, she always reads to me the most beautiful ones. I always immediately discover the culprit >> William says proudly. Sherlock messes up the child's hair more spontaneously than before.
<< Of course not, Greg! >> John says, turning to him.
<< Greg, seriously: do me and Sherlock really look like a couple ? >> John asks Greg the question that has remained in the balance many times between them. Greg looks at John, undecided whether to take it seriously or not and opts for the first option.
.” She said and winked, before looking a tad worried, “You did study.. safe though, right?”
“So do you, never have I been this close to finding a girl attractive.” He said jokingly and Janine nudged his side.
Mummy only laughed softly at that, continuing to stroke Sherlock's head, not minding that Sherlock had tried to stop her from doing that – well, actually he kind of liked it even, not that he would admit it. "Sherlock, you and Mycroft are extraordinary boys. We only hired those private teacher to grant you the best possible education, it had nothing to do with you not being able to make friends. You're a lovely boy. Stubborn, arrogant, but under your aloof mask, you're adorable."
He heard the common squeak the door to his room made when it was opened and then his room was flooded in much too bright light, coming from the tread.
The barkeeper cracked a little smile, “Well, happy birthday.” He said and – did the guy just wink? The big grin on Janine’s face seemed to say that he did.
“Violet, please.” His mum said as she shook Janine’s hand, still grinning from ear to ear. “See, Sherlock, I told you, you’ll make friends in no time.”
“Well, I live here.”
And being on the subject of special – today was special as well. The time had finally come for his 18th birthday. He’d finally be able to move out, which he was still convinced to do, even though the idea had started to become scarier the closer it came into reach. But it was the next step into adulthood and he was pretty sure everyone was a little scared to live on their own.
"Yes! Fine! I call her off!" John called and sighed, shaking his head about himself.
»Morning...« John muttered then, averting his eyes after a slightly too long moment of staring at the other and trying to let his voice sound normal. »Coffee?« he asked and sighed silently, barely audible. God, how he wished it had been reality. But it was not and he had to deal with it.
“Are we all done gossiping now?” Mr Watson asked in his military manner, looking around the class that grew quiet in an instance. “Right then. Would anyone be so kind to let me be part of the fun?”
Sherlock Holmes was different than other people his age. He was in no way a usual a normal seventeen year old. Probably the only thing which could be described
“So about what you said before..” Shouldn’t have jinxed it, he thought as his mother continued. “That you’re gay, I mean.. it’s okay, you know. I actually had that suspicion about you for a while.”
“Fine.. you’re such a spoilsport.” Janine said and chuckled, shaking her head. “Okay, back to operation finding Sherlock a boyfriend then.” she said and nipped at her beer. “Aw yuck… that doesn’t taste even remotely like I thought it would. How is something that tastes so godawful this popular?”
itchy and horrible cotton, but not as worse as the brownish-black trousers which jarred with the blazer.. The tie was designed in diagonal stripes in three different (ugly) shades of blue, white and black. Not that Sherlock was a fashion fetishist, but that was an insult for the eye. And to crown it all the already cumbersome uniform was even bulkier on him since Sherlock had to take the school's largest size because he was already taller than most of the teachers and even with the largest size, the sleeves along with the trouser legs were too short.
“I think I’ll go with Lock, then.” Sherlock said and chuckled, shaking his head. Maybe this friends thing wasn’t as bad as he had thought? It definitely was entertaining anyway.
»Black, two sugars.« the blonde interrupted him and finished his sentence. »I know, Sherlock.«
either of them knew that he’d have the next period with him too.
It did feel strange to walk around an empty school, though. Schools were just one of those places supposed to be filled with people and massively crowded – even he with his limited experience had that image in mind. Like hospitals. The empty corridors seemed somewhat unsettling. Although still not as much as they did when they were populated. At the very least there was no one pointing fingers at him as he walked over to his locker to put away his things, before he grabbed his things for English class and walked to the classroom.
Sherlock lowered his kisses down John's neck while his slender fingers teasingly slowly unbuttoned John's pyjama jacket, eventually reaching his waistband and pulling down John's pants.
“So basically, we’re going to try, but if it doesn’t work out, shrug shoulders and leave?” Sherlock said and Janine nodded with a grin.
“Let’s drop her off first.” John said and Sherlock nodded, giving the driver Janine’s address as he got in, followed by John.
The rest of the school day passed relatively uneventfully. People were still gossiping behind his back when he passed them in the hallways, which he had expected. What he hadn’t expected was that this Janine girl continued to follow him around all day. They had pretty much all classes together, except for English. And Sherlock actually, reluctantly, started to like her – or maybe he just liked the fact that there was someone that kept telling him not to listen to ‘those cocks’ when another of his peers insulted him. He could get used to having that kind of bumper. Sherlock knew of course that she’d eventually get fed up with him, no question, but until then he’d just roll with it.
"Are we going?" the detective asked, obviously not minding that John had other plans at all.
“Relax, I’m just kidding.. and hey, I don’t blame you, he
I'll leave you with this mental image because it's appropriate for this chapter
Sherlock sat up and watched John walking into the kitchen. »Bla..«
“What did you just call me?” Sherlock asked and raised a brow.
“That chemistry may not be my strong suit, but sewing is. My brother always wore the largest size they have here, I mean you’d fit into it at least four times, easily, but the sleeves should be long enough at least. We’re going to my place first to pick up the jacket and my sewing kit. And I’ll fit it for you at your place.”
“I’m just worried, alright! It’s not often that my sons bring home girls..” she said and chuckled.
. “ Janine giggled, toeing off her shoes and crossing her legs on the bed.
“Drinks are on me tonight, okay, so you might as well try your way through all the beverages they offer.” Sherlock said, figuring that she was working on a budget here, which was totally alright, but he kinda wanted her to have fun tonight and not think about money issues.
He wasn't all that special. He was nothing. He was just another idiot. An idiot with a pretty face maybe, but still an idiot. His IQ was probably average at best and he was rude. And it took a lot for Sherlock to point that one out. There was a difference between being just dumb and being dumb and rude.
. Of course Sherlock knew her opinion wasn't worth a straw. She was a mother. Her brain was designed to find her own children adorable and pretty even if they were too tall, too thin, weird-faced and wearing a school uniform, he'd fit in twice. Or in Mycroft's case weird-faced and fat with OCD which made him carry an umbrella everywhere he went and always – really bloody
“Are you sure?” she asked and got back up, though she was still really very unsteady on her feet.
Anderson nodded. Was this really going to be discussed by the whole class now with the teacher right up there with the gossipers? Seriously? Even the grumpy girl next to him started to look somewhat amused.
»Oh, yeah, that's me. Hi.« Sherlock said nonchalantly and finally turned around, giving the voice a face and … oh. Not just a face, but a round, pale face that looked timeless and … handsome?
“You’re sure about that colour.” Sherlock asked and raised a brow as he took the - oh silk - shirt from her. “And the size? I mean, don’t get me wrong, I’m not a bulky clothes type. But I’m also not a take one breath and the buttons pop off type.”
“Two beers, please!” she shouted over the crowd when the barkeeper eyed them with a raised brow.
“Oh, yes. She does. The way you uncomfortably pulled me past her and said we were ‘studying’.. that is totally code for ‘
Giving Sherlock a dirty look – Anderson seemed really giddy to humiliate Sherlock just that bit more – he stood up. “Well, Mr Watson, turns out our little Mr Rebel is a fag.”
Calling his parents to pick him up and letting him go back to having private teachers wasn't an option at the moment, though. What was he supposed to say? I was hit on by some uncouth girl, accidentally said I'm gay to get her off my back and now I'm being bullied? That'd probably work, but it would trigger a sort of conversation with his parents he didn't want to have. For one, because it just wasn't their business and second, he wouldn't know what to say if they asked if he was in fact gay as he did know he was more interested in males than females.
“100%.” Sherlock said and smiled at her, “I was there. I would have heard that.”
wear your uniform properly.«
"Dinner?" The doctor asked and frowned at his cup, "I don't recall you mentioning that before." he continued and sighed, dinner would be a terrible idea tonight. Not that he wouldn't like to spend time with Sherlock, but he really needed a bit of distance after the dream last night. It was still so real in his mind. It didn't feel like a dream. It didn't fade slowly like they usually did. It was all still bright and colourful in his head.
“Well that was a random change of subject.” Sherlock said with a huffed laugh, looking up at her.
Edit: okay I kinda figured it out xD it's not super pretty on mobile but at least it the text shouldn't get mixed up anymore :D
If someone would have asked, John wouldn't be able to explain why he had
Then the teachers. Sherlock was already far more educated than them, that was for sure.. He was sure they'd be dull and ordinary and not worth his time. But that wasn't even the worst part of the problem. The absolutely worst was the horrible School uniform.. A blackish-greyish-blueish, somewhat bulky blazer (if you could call it that), a white shirt that was matching to the blazer just as shapeless and made of
“Actually.. erm.. sir, I’ve done my homework.”
” he said with a roll of his eyes, raising his voice at the last bit and biting back a smile when he heard rustling from the inside, before the door opened.
“I don’t know? Beer? Maybe?” Sherlock asked, having no experience with alcohol unless used in experiments and that was typically not the kind you were meant to drink.
“Are you rich or something?” Janine asked and looked at Sherlock with a laugh.
“Sherlock.” He said instinctively, he despised it when someone called him Mr Holmes. It just sounded weird to him.
Putting his half full cup into the sink, John turned to go to the bathroom, "I'm taking a shower." he called and closed the door behind him, stripping off his robe and boxers, before stepping into the shower.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “Well.. my mother force read the books to my brother and me when we were little.”
“Yeah, I can see that. I’d rather say witch, though… because it didn’t seem humanly possible to me to do
“Doesn’t have to.” Janine said with a shrug as they started to walk towards her place.
PS: I'd really like feedback here, because I'm not too sure about this chapter... so critic is very welcome^^
“Because you looked so disgustingly happy getting the chance to publicly humiliate another student, Mr Anderson.” Watson said and just briefly – so much that Sherlock almost hadn’t noticed – made eye contact with him, just before he sat back down and told everyone to open their books.
John moaned lightly, flushing even deeper than before as he felt his erection grow against Sherlock's thigh. Biting his lip, he shifted a bit, trying to cover it up, before he felt Sherlock's arousal hard against his stomach as the man readjusted to John's struggling, obviously not intending to let go and dear god, John didn't want him to stop.
Once arrived at the school, Sherlock realised that his mother might have had a point. There was literally no one around as he entered the building, which was already unlocked though so he took that as a go ahead as he walked in.
“But why am I the only one getting detention now?” Anderson kept complaining and Watson turned back to him.
However, have fun with this chapter and let me know what you think :)
Sherlock needed only a few minutes for his morning routine, really glad that Mummy had mercy with him and at least let him wear something similar to his usual clothes. After dressing, Sherlock went down the stairs, followed just as usual by Redbeard – his two year old Irish Setter – who followed Sherlock everywhere he went. Walking into the kitchen, Sherlock first filled Redbeard's bowl.
“Well now you have.” Janine said and grinned, “You’re like super good at chemistry, right?”
“Sherlock, let’s talk about this, please?” His mother called from outside, making him sigh in defeat.
agreed to call a date off only because the great detective said so. But Sherlock was like a drug. He was hooked and there was no way to get out of it. Why was he even still trying? Wasn't it slow but steady time to just settle with it? To simply commit himself to Sherlock and stop dating, even if he knew they'd never be a couple? After all John was sure that even as friends, Sherlock and him would spend the rest of their lives together.
