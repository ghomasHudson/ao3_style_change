“Did they offer you my baby?” Mycroft asked in a dangerously low voice. Sara still didn’t answer, glaring away from Mycroft. Mycroft, without warning, punched Sara in the nose. Fury was building up inside of him at the thought that this stupid woman was being so god-forsakenly stubborn while out there people were plotting against the safety of his child. “I will ask again,” he said, deceptively calm. “Did they offer you my baby?”
“Sherlock?” he called through the door. A large sniff was the only answer he got. “Sherlock, I’m coming in.”
Thank you for reading, my life is starting to slow down so hopefully I will be able to post a little more regularly!
Hermione stood. “I have to get back to the office. We’ll be in touch. John it was nice to see you, Sherlock, nice to meet you and Liz, I hope you feel better.” With that, Hermione walked over to the fireplace and pulled a small pouch out of her bag. She took a pinch of Floo Powder out of the bag and stepped into the fireplace. In a rush of bright light and a muffled “Ministry”, she was gone.
“Alright,” Mycroft said after taking a deep, calming breath. “Strip down to your pants, and go kneel in the bedroom.” Quietly Greg got to his feet, slipping into their bedroom. Mycroft watched his sub leave and sighed, bracing himself for what he needed to do. Slowly he got to his feet, giving Greg enough time to get ready before he slipped into the bedroom, greeted with the sight of Greg on his knees by the bed. “Gorgeous,” Mycroft breathed. “So, why are we here, Gregory?”
“If there’s anything you don’t want to talk about, you don’t have to,” Sherlock continued from her other side.
“How was school this week?” Greg heard Mycroft ask through the door. Greg walked through the door, putting Charlie and Alice’s bag in the room they shared when they were staying at the flat. As he was exiting he saw Jackie come tottering towards him. She had started walking in the past few months, much to Mycroft’s chagrin. It was much harder to catch a running baby than a scooching baby when she put her mind to it.
“I don’t think I’ve ever been this relaxed in my life,” Sherlock admitted on an exhale, arms coming above his head in a full-body stretch that had him arching in John’s lap.
“So, is there anything else you can tell me?” Greg asked when the silence had become unbearably heavy.
“Yes, it is the best way to go unnoticed.” Although Mycroft could think of several different ways they could go into town without pretending to be a couple, Mycroft chose not to mention them. It was easier this way, he told himself.
“Well, tough shit. If you don’t want to talk to me you don’t have to, if you don’t want to LOOK at me you don’t have to, but damn if I’ll let you be on your own.” Greg was trying to reign in his anger, knowing that Mycroft had already been through enough. Mycroft stared blankly out the window of the car, watching London slip by. They rode the rest of the way in silence, Greg pulling up to his flat. He got out, walking to the passenger side and opening the door for Mycroft. “Come on, love,” Greg soothed, reaching in to help Mycroft out. He took Mycroft’s hand in his own, and was shocked when Mycroft ripped his hand out of Greg’s.
Sherlock glared at him over his crossed arms. “No. Go ‘way.” He tucked his face back into his folded arms.
“Good morning, sleepy,” Greg said when he turned and noticed Mycroft watching him. “I heard her crying and figured it would be alright if I came in and took care of her.”
“Up we go,” John said, taking Liz’s hand and leading her into the building, Sherlock trailing behind. They entered the building and went up to the second floor.
“No thank you John, I’m just stopping in to drop these off.” He brandished the garment bag, pushing it towards John.
Sherlock hummed unconvincedly, but didn’t say anything. Sherlock looked outside and realized they were sitting outside the flat. “How long have we been sitting here?”
“As I saw? Yeah, as I saw, as I saw your unconscious body on this bed and I waited for you to wake up and took care of Jackie and hoped that you would wake up okay.”
“That will be unnecessary. Please finish cleaning up the mission, and find me anything you can on Jaclynn. Then, if you could handle any other emergencies that may arise over the next few days, I will be taking the rest of the week off to get her acclimatized.”
“That’s perfectly fine. I wouldn’t do any more now that the fever has gone down. Unfortunately with babies the most you can do is use a saline solution to clear her nostrils. I’ll text you instructions and bring over some saline. You wouldn’t happen to know if she’s had her shots, would you?”
" Yes, sir." With a salute, the other man trotted back down the alley and disappeared around the corner.
“I know you’re scared, but I need you to tell me your name.” When he got no response, he changed tactics. “This isn’t your fault, okay? I know you’re scared. You’ve probably made things like this happen before, yeah? When you were scared or angry?”
“Thanks Sherlock, that’s really great.” Sherlock tried not to enjoy the warm glow that started in the pit of his stomach and grew to the tips of his fingers and toes at the words of praise. They were interrupted once more when Mycroft and Greg strolled up to them hand in hand.
“No, John,” Sherlock lowered his eyes but his lips quirked at the fond exasperation laced in John’s voice.
“You can go now, Gregory,” Mycroft said, voice equally quiet. “I’ve eliminated the threat. You are no longer obligated to be here. No need to pretend to like me anymore.”
“London, originally, but Mycroft here is the British ambassador in Canada. He had a little bit of work to finish up there before we could go on vacation and since I’ve never been to Canada, I decided to tag along. We came straight from there. We’ve been flying around a lot.” Greg chuckled.
Greg silently took a bite of the sandwich, tears slipping down his cheeks. Mycroft quickly took the second-to-last bite of the sandwich, quickly putting the last bit in Greg’s mouth. Greg chewed and swallowed around soft sobs that were bubbling in his throat.
“You did so well, Gregory,” Mycroft praised, pulling Greg upwards and grabbing his legs so that he was straddling Mycroft on the big plush chair, practically sitting in his lap. “Now, I want you to put your hands on my shoulders and don’t let go.” When Greg had done it, Mycroft leaned forward to whisper in his ear. “If you don’t let go, I’ll let you come.” He bit Greg’s earlobe as one hand reached for his nipple, the other one tripping down the corset and into his pants. Gripping Greg’s cock, Mycroft grabbed the hard length gently, teasing his hand up and down his length. “Do you think you could come like this?” Mycroft asked, sucking hard into the side of Greg’s neck as he gently brushed his hand once more up and down Greg’s shaft. “Just my fingers ghosting up and down your length, me biting and pinching you.” Mycroft sunk his teeth into the meat between Greg’s neck and shoulder, moving his hand from his nipple into his hair. “What if I pull on your hair? Will that tip you over the edge?” Mycroft suddenly grasped Greg’s length firmly, twisting his hand around the head of his cock and spreading the pre-cum he found there. “Or maybe you need it quick and rough, will that get you there? Hm?” He tugged relentlessly on Greg’s hair and cock, crushing their lips together and nipping at Greg’s lower lip. “Are you going to come for me?” Mycroft asked, nipping at Greg’s earlobe again. “Are you getting close? Look at all that pre-cum, you’re so wet for me Greg, you look so gorgeous coming apart on my lap for me, come on now, let go, you can do it.” Mycroft raked his finger nails back down from Greg’s scalp to his chest and scratched over his nipple. “Come for me, Gregory.” He jerked Greg relentlessly until with a cry he came, spilling into Mycroft’s hand. Mycroft worked him through his orgasm, sealing their lips and drinking Greg’s moans down. When he was finished, Greg rested his forehead against Mycroft’s shoulder, panting and sweaty. Mycroft wiped his hand on Greg’s pants, silently promising to wash them later.
“You will die, you know?” he told her conversationally. “If you don’t tell me, that is. So I will ask again, who do you work for?”
When she was done, Marcia put the needle and thread down on the bed. “Now we’re going to need to flip him,” she said. “I’ll grab his arm and hip, you push from behind, yeah?”
Strictly speaking there weren’t supposed to be points, but Sherlock was giving each item thought so John let it slide.
“Well, it’s an option, regardless,” Mycroft said. “I won’t leave you, Sherlock. I’ve always been looking out for you, and location won’t change that.”
“Ah, my dear I’m afraid you’ve shown your hand. No use trying to stay quiet now. You clearly know something. So do you know what the experiment is about?”
“Do you mean… how often we’ve scened? Or just had straight sex? And isn’t this a little personal?” Greg asked.
Mycroft waved towards the cart he was pushing. “Yes, of course.” He smiled, knowing he would eat the whole pack himself if he wasn’t careful. He occupied himself with Jackie, who was seated in the cart in front of him.
“Well, since everything is in order, I will be saying my farewells for now,” Mycroft said, interrupting John’s thoughts. He looked at Liz, eyes softening imperceptibly around the edges. “It was nice to meet you, Liz. I’m sure I will be seeing you shortly. Brother, John,” he nodded at each man in turn before turning on his heel and retrieving his umbrella, hooking it over his arm before letting himself quietly out of the flat.
“She started screaming,” an older male worker said, “and it sounded like something from another world. Like the gates to Hell had opened up and all it’s creatures were being let loose.”
“Da!” she cried crawling back towards Mycroft. Mycroft scooped her up and nuzzled into her belly, eliciting a laugh. Greg had never seen him so easy with her and wondered if the painkillers had something to do with it.
Mycroft took a moment to observe Greg. He was confused as to why Greg had touched him as he had earlier. Obviously he was only pretending to like Mycroft in order to continue the charade, but didn’t he realize he didn’t have to do that in private? Mycroft carefully ignored the pit that opened in the bottom of his stomach when he thought of Greg only pretending. Greg was too kind to be attracted to someone as emotionally stunted as he was, and it was best he let him know that now.
“Good boy, thank you for your help,” John said, taking Sherlock’s hand. “Now, let’s go get you into a nice bath.”
“No more than usual,” Greg insisted. “As long as you’ve got tea and maybe a little something to throw down my throat, I’ll be good to go. I was just going to sit on my sofa and watch the match anyway, may as well be a little more social.”
“Okay.” Greg laid out the afghan that was draped on the back of the sofa. “You know where to find me. Please, come get me if you need anything, alright?”
"Hello, sir," Marcia, the only paramedic that Mycroft trusted implicitly, greeted him. "Bit of a rough night?"
“Thank you,” he said. He considered her for a moment. She seemed loyal enough, relatively smart as far as thugs went, and could obviously withstand a certain amount of pain. If his people hadn’t been there, her and her people would have had a chance at getting Jackie. “Your team, is that a permanent arrangement?” he asked.
“Alright, so the trick is to say your destination in a clear voice,” he told Sherlock. “I’ll be taking Liz with me, and you’ll follow after.” He handed the pouch to Sherlock, kissing him quickly on the mouth. Then, he took a pinch of powder and threw it in the fire.
John, who had been enjoying a rare quiet afternoon with a book, looked up at his partner. Sherlock was draped across the sofa, head hanging off one of the armrests.
“Yes,” Mycroft sighed, knowing it wouldn’t be fun when the time came. “Anthea, I’m sure you have more important things to be doing. Thank you for bringing me the information.”
“So what? You need this, Mycroft. Don’t stop until you’re ready to. You need to get all the sad out. That’s how you start to heal.” Greg took his hand from Mycroft’s and cupped his face instead. With his thumb, he wiped away one of tears still coursing down his cheek.
Sherlock didn’t answer, preoccupied with finding his brother’s contact and lifting the phone to his ear.
It was the day before, and the three of them were in the living room, John tapping diligently on his computer while Sherlock and Liz coloured. It was a peaceful quiet in the flat, broken only by the soft murmur of the telly in the background and Sherlock softly teaching Liz the scientific names for the animals they were colouring.
The silence was broken by a knock on the flat door. John frowned but put his computer aside, heaving himself from his chair and going to open the door. He was met with the sight of Mycroft on the other side, umbrella hung delicately off one arm and a garment bag in his other hand. He smiled cooly at John.
“Right.” John retreated back into the kitchen and emerged a few minutes later with two mugs of tea. He set them down on the low table in front of the sofa. “Do you have anything on how to deal with older children?”
“Open it,” Mycroft prompted softly. Liz did as instructed, carefully taking the locket out of the box and prying it open. Inside on the left was a moving picture of Sherlock ,and on the right was a picture of John. They were both candids, neither of them looking into the camera but rather smiling off into the distance. John wasn’t sure how Mycroft got the pictures, but wasn’t about to question the lovely gift.
John looked confused and a little hurt. “No, of course not. Like I said a minute ago, those three were being asses and needed to be told.”
“Well, that is something I’d rather never experience ever again. In fact, I may need to burn my eyes out.”
Her fingers flew across the keyboard and her eyes scanned the screen in front of her. “He’s still in surgery, but you can head to family waiting room F down the hall, I believe some of his family is already there.”
"Come, I'm not going to hurt you," he said, annoyed and pressured as he heard the pounding footsteps getting closer. "You are making the situation worse, not better," he singsonged through clenched teeth. The baby went stiff as a board, sobs still wracking her small body as she heaved ear-piercing shrieks. Mycroft hooked one arm around her back and the other beneath her bum, securing her close to his chest even though she was stiff and unpliable.
“Probably don’t put eggs in the fireplace,” Greg said as he watched Mycroft look contemplatively into it.
“Well it’s a good thing I’ve already solved it, then,” Sherlock groused from behind the steadily reddening tissue.
“Oh, aren’t you the sweetest?” The lady behind the counter asked. She was in her late sixties, grey hair cropped close to her head. “How old is she?” she asked.
“So it has been decreed,” Greg said grandly, using his free hand to bat Mycroft’s hand away from the knot of his tie.
“Hello Jackie,” she said, and Jackie waved tentatively back. “Oh, isn’t she just precious.” The woman smiled at Mycroft who smiled thinly back.
“Great, go save the world,” Greg said with a smile, scooping Jackie off the floor and holding her out towards Mycroft. “Say goodbye to Daddy.”
Mycroft pulled the menu towards himself, scanning quickly down it. There wasn’t much to choose from- there was one salad, four sandwiches, two soups, three pasta dishes and chicken fingers to choose from.
“Looks good,” Sherlock said as he sat down, taking a piece of toast and a spoonful of scrambled eggs.
Mycroft and Lestrade try to figure out their dynamic- in a slightly explosive manner. Meanwhile, Sherlock and John make a big decision.
“Sir,” Anthea greeted. “I’ve just about finished tying up the loose ends of the case. I’m just outside the flat and I’ve got a onesie, a diaper and a bottle for the baby. May I come in?”
“That would be me,” John admitted, a touch embarrassed. Greg noticed an underlying tension in the set of John’s shoulders and could tell he was not happy with Sherlock.
"All it took was killing a man to earn your trust, eh?" Mycroft asked drily. He took a moment to lean against the wall and looked down at the baby, noticing a small bracelet on her wrist. 'Jaclynn-13522' was engraved on it, similar to a medical emergency bracelet. He noticed that now that the child had calmed somewhat, she was still very warm to the touch, which was worrying. "Well, Jaclynn, we'd best get moving." Tucking the girl closer to him, Mycroft started running once more down the hallway, each breath burning a little more. When he reached the end of the hallway, he ran headlong into another man. Lifting his gun on instinct, it took him a few seconds to recognize the man as one of his own people.
“Hello, Jackie,” Greg crooned at her, rubbing her stomach soothingly. It seemed to calm her somewhat and she let out a few more whimpers. “There you go,” he soothed. “You’re alright. Daddy will make it right as soon as he gets back.” Greg looked up and saw Mycroft in the door, looking equal parts despairing and relieved. “I’ve had ten years of practice,” Greg reassured him, looking back down at Jackie. “The first time Layla got her pokes, I thought I was the worst parent ever because I couldn’t make it better and I couldn’t protect her from the pain. And then I realized that it was normal and that I won’t be able to protect them from everything, no matter how hard I try.” Greg made eye contact with Mycroft once more and smiled gently. Mycroft felt his stomach flutter but pushed down the emotion.
All of the adults had calmed down and were calming down the rest of the children. The silence was almost worse, as it seemed as if everyone in the room was listening to them.
“Fine,” he grumbled, swooping in to take Jackie from Mycroft. “Let’s go show Lestrade what you learned.”
“Liz, I know this may be hard, but I need you to answer. Did your mummy hit you because of things you couldn’t control?”
John chuckled a bit. “Well, before you go, would you mind taking my number? So that maybe we can text and meet up outside of these gatherings? Only if you want to, of course.”
“There you go, then.” He paused for a moment. “Although you do know that you can call John if you’re ever concerned? Or do a quick internet search? Not that I’m not pleased that you asked me, because I really am, and I love getting to see you and Jackie on a regular basis.”
“Stay still!” John wrapped one arm around Sherlock’s waist, holding him in place. “Now, I’m going to spank you until I feel you’ve learned your lesson. No need to count.” Without waiting for an answer, John let his hand fall in a measured rhythm onto Sherlock’s trouser-covered backside. John had never had to punish Sherlock with a spanking before, corner time usually doing the trick. Although spanking was in their contract as an acceptable form of punishment, John kept a sharp eye on how his boy was reacting.
“Can we help you lads?” The man asked. He was in his late thirties, a receding hairline haloing the crown of his head. A bulbous nose stood out from wide, kind eyes buried under bushy brows.
“Dominant, going to uni for medicine, father is a drunk,” Sherlock quickly deduced. “From the second wave of the experiment, same as me, older brother also a drunk probably passed out under a table somewhere. Sports injury in the left shoulder, likely football or rugby.”
“Okay, let’s do this,” he said. “On three. One, two, three.” They both stood, Mycroft leaning heavily on Greg for support. They made their way to the bathroom one step at a time, Mycroft wincing the entire way. When they reached the toilet, Mycroft looked at Gregory.
Sherlock watched Greg turn on his heel and stalk to his police car, where he knew Mycroft was waiting. Sherlock quietly slipped his hand into John’s, pulling his blanket tighter around him. John didn’t seem to register what Sherlock had done, taking subconscious comfort in the weight of a hand in his.
“John, it’s Sherlock, I’m okay. We’re at your house. We’re both safe. You’re having a nightmare. Please wake up.”
“Fine,” Greg answered, pulling his hands out of Mycroft’s and standing, walking towards the windows and looking out at the dark skyline sprawled out in front of him. Mycroft frowned at Greg’s back, standing and going over to the windows as well. He stood beside Greg with his hands in his pockets, the only sound that of Greg’s slightly elevated breathing.
Sherlock, meanwhile was donning his own robes, fastening the gold clasp at his clavicle. “They’ll suffice,” he said, standing straight and brushing invisible lint off the front.
“No,” Jackie pouted, tapping Greg’s chest with her open hand. “No no no no no,” she chanted happily.
“Yes, of course.” Mycroft handed Jackie once more to Greg, who took her to the kitchen table and sat on the chair that had earlier been occupied by Sherlock. He picked up the teddy bear and held it in front of Jackie, bopping it’s nose against hers and making her giggle. Greg and Mycroft both smiled at her as her face lit up.
The brothers didn’t talk during the car ride, both lost in thought and trying their best not to fidget. When they finally pulled up to the building, Sherlock reflexively let Mycroft get out first before following. They entered the building and were met by the sight of other young adults crowded into a room, similar to the last time. This time, however, there were less of them, around one hundred and twenty where last time there was two hundred.
“Of course not,” Mycroft assured him. “Why don’t you kneel on the floor?” Greg slid gracefully to his knees, turning so that he was facing Mycroft. “Good boy,” Mycroft purred, running his hands gently through Greg’s hair. “There you go. Deep breaths. Let the tension out of your shoulders.” Greg let Mycroft’s voice wash over him, his words gently rocking him towards subspace. Fingernails started scraping against the back of Greg’s neck, leaving red marks in their wake. In the few times that Mycroft had brought Greg down, he had learned that it took a careful balance of pleasure and pain to get him fully down, unlike Sherlock who needed pure pleasure.
“I’ve been better,” Sherlock said, eyes softening as he looked at John. “Did you catch him?” Sherlock asked, looking at Lestrade.
Liz quietly slipped off the sofa and followed John into the kitchen, afghan still wrapped around her shoulders. She slipped into one of the chairs at the kitchen table, feet swinging in the air.
“We’ll be right there,” he said, hanging up. “We’ve got to go.” The two of them abandoned their coffee, sprinting out of the shop.
Mycroft pressed himself up against Greg in the guise of kissing him on the cheek as they proceeded forward.
“It was good of you to know you shouldn’t be alone, but you also should have called me. I could have met you here.”
“Look, Mycroft, I’m fine, alright?” Growling, he spun away and raked his nails roughly through his hair, aimlessly pacing around the large flat.
Sherlock resisted for a moment, digging around in his pocket until he came up with a card with his name and number on it. “If you ever need my help. This is where you can reach me.” With that, he handed the card to the officer.
“Alright, let’s get those potatoes boiling so we can mash them,” Greg said. “Fill the pot with water and put it on the stove, please.”
“No, Liz, look at us please.” John felt Liz shake her head against his neck. “Liz, come on, you’re okay. We’re not angry, we were just worried about you.”
“Yes, I’m sorry, John. Although I have to say, as far as your first lecture for misbehavior, you have done quite admirably.”
“Stop, please just stop, plea-“ she leaned over and threw up on Mycroft’s shoes. Mycroft grimaced slightly but did not let go.
“Yes, well, family run businesses tend to have more original names,” Mycroft said. “Most of the stores in this town are local, family-owned stores. It’s a tourist attraction in the summer months but it dies down in the winter.”
“That wasn’t really his place to do,” John mumbled, continuing at a more normal level, “but we have just legally adopted you, so we are responsible for you now. That’s okay, right?”
It was a week and a half later when John and Sherlock broached the idea of daycare. They had talked about it a few days before, after a session with Dr. Witter. Although he had been unable to find a wizard daycare, he had found several Muggle ones that other wizard families had used. John researched them and found that one was relatively close to the flat. Although Liz was still relatively non-verbal, her nightmares and panic attacks had lessened, and she was able to go for several hours without touching one of them. They had discovered through trial and error that she enjoyed colouring, wasn’t fond of cards but really enjoyed board games and reading.
“On the count of three. One,” John knelt down. “Two,” John grabbed the skin of Jackie’s arm between thumb and forefinger. “Three.” John quickly stuck the needle in, depressing the plunger and pulling out the needle. As soon as the needle was inserted, Jackie screamed a blood-curdling howl, pulling against Mycroft. Mycroft held on tighter burying his face in her hair and humming soothingly in her ear. It did nothing as Jackie tried to twist out of Mycroft’s grip. John watched Mycroft as he tightened his arms around Jackie; he also watched as Mycroft let a mask of indifference slip over his expression, going glacially cold. Worried at what that meant, he hastened to finish up.
“Well you aren’t a submissive, so you aren’t biologically built to obey everyone around you,” Sherlock sulked, glowering at Mycroft.
Getting up, Sherlock crept to the door, which was closed. Slowly turning the handle, Sherlock cracked the door open and peered in. He was met with the sight of John on the bed, the sheets tangled around his legs at the end of the bed. His arms were thrown above his head and his face was twisted, grunts breaking through his gritted teeth.
“No talking. You’ll eat everything I give you, not a morsel more and not a morsel less. And you will kneel on that rice without shifting or complaint and think about how important it is that you care for yourself and recognize how hard you work and how much you deserve every bite of this meal and every second with me. As soon as the meal is done, your punishment will be over.” Mycroft brandished the piece of carrot stick once more towards Greg. “Now eat.” Greg offered no more complaint as he gently took the carrot stick between his teeth, sucking it back and chewing efficiently. Mycroft fed him a few more carrot sticks the same way, the only sound their combined breaths and the gentle sound of chewing. Mycroft took a carrot stick for himself and ate it before picking up one half of the sandwich. He took a bite out of it, chewing and swallowing before offering the same edge to Greg. He took a careful bite, watching as Mycroft brought the sandwich to his own mouth to have another bite. About halfway through the sandwich, Greg started shifting, the rice digging deeper into his knees.
“Indeed.” Scooping up the bowl, Mycroft spooned some of the pasta into his mouth as he watched Jackie pick up one stackable teacup and put it in the other. Then, she reached over to the small cake and pressed the button on top, prompting it to play a garish song.
When he re-entered the bedroom carrying two mugs, it was to the sight of Mycroft with Jackie sitting beside him, happily babbling at him while he answered her.
“Quidditch is a wizarding sport,” Rose pitched in from Ron’s side, leaning forward so she could see Liz. “There’s a beater, a seeker, chasers and a keeper. Dad and I play in the yard sometimes, but there’s only two of us so it doesn’t work as well.”
“It’s been a week, mother, not a century,” Sherlock groused as they entered the house, leaving their coats in the hall closet and proceeding to the living room.
Shaking himself back into the present, John made his way more sedately up the stairs and stopped at the nursery door, knocking softly.
“That’s not true!” He stalked swiftly over to Sherlock and, before John could react, punched him in the nose.
“It’s alright, you’re alright,” he murmured. “What’s the matter?” Rubbing her back, Mycroft went into the kitchen and laid Jackie on the kitchen table, which had become a temporary changing table. Laying her down, he unsnapped her onesie and opened her diaper; greeted with the cause of at least some of Jackie’s distress, Mycroft quickly stripped it off and grabbed a wet wipe, wiping her down and putting cream on her before putting on a new diaper.
“And I’ll continue to say it until you believe me,” John smiled softly at him. “Goodnight,” he said after a moment, letting go completely of Sherlock.
“NSPCC wasn’t available to take her, so we offered to keep her for a couple days,” John answered quickly. Liz’s eyes darted back and forth between them. John looked down and smiled at her. “It’s okay,” he said reassuringly. He finished getting her out of her coat and hung it up just as Mrs. Hudson knocked on the door.
Please note that the first chunk of Mycroft and Greg's session is straight from the movie Mr. & Mrs. Smith.
“No! Of course not!” Sherlock hastened to reply. “I trust you indefinitely. It’s just a sort of knee-jerk reaction I have from a childhood of bullying. I’m sorry, let’s get on with it.”
“Thank you,” Greg said, taking the carrier and car seat as Mycroft reached for the dog. “Have a good day.”
“That’ll be sixteen sickles and twenty Knuts,” she said and John dug into his pockets, pulling out another pouch and pulling out a large coin. “Keep the change,” he said, handing it over.
“And you know you’ve got your safe word so that at any time, if you feel I am being truly unfair, you can back out.”
“Very good. Now to start the list again.” John lifted the list once more, picking up his pen from beside him on the sofa. “Abrasion.”
Rose scurried off to find robes and John followed after her, hoping to be led towards the children’s section. He passed by mannequins of all shapes and sizes wearing different robes. As he passed, the mannequins shifted into different poses.
“You’re not fine. Do you know how I know you’re not fine? Your EMT had to drag your unconscious body in here, and then I had to help her drag you to your bed. And then I had to watch her stitch up your gunshot wound. No hospitals? Jesus Mycroft, what if you had been seriously injured? What if you were on the edge of death, with me and Jackie waiting anxiously at home, and you refused to go to hospital?”
“Tales of Beedle the Bard!” John exclaimed, pulling out a tall thin book from the shelf. “This was my favourite. Look, Babbity Rabbity and the Cackling Stump! And The Wizard and the Hopping Pot. These were my childhood. I’m buying this.” He tucked the book under his arm, reaching for another.
“Okay, okay,” John chuckled, taking the jumper and quickly pulling it over his head. “Let’s go.” Sherlock swept out of the bedroom like a tornado, collecting his coat and scarf on the way out and flying through the door. Collecting his coat, John followed Sherlock out the door and locked it behind them. Sherlock was already hailing a cab, arm imperiously in the air. In no time a cab had pulled up to the kerb and Sherlock slid gracefully in, John sliding in behind him. Sherlock fired off an address and the cab pulled into traffic. The ride was quick and quiet, both men caught up in their own thoughts.
“I know,” he said meekly. “It seems I may have grown a touch rusty in the time that I have taken a more stationary role at my job.”
Mycroft sat in the van, thinking on the plans they had formulated and pushing out any thoughts of Greg or Jackie. Emotion would not help him in a situation like this, and he endeavored to shut it out.
“We’ve got about three more bites. We’ll do this together,” Mycroft encouraged Greg. “You are so strong. You can do this.”
An indeterminate amount of time passed, Greg sinking further and further into his thoughts. When the door to the flat clicked opened, Greg didn’t notice, the buzz of the thoughts in his head drowning out all other noise.
“We won’t be moving right away,” Mycroft said after a minute. “The fact that we’re looking is good enough for them to give me the job. I won’t be leaving for a while yet. Enough time for you to get annoyed by me, for sure.”
“Sir, everyone’s ready to go in when you are,” Anthea said from beside him. She would be coordinating the raid from inside the van.
They left the store, the sun shining cheerfully as they walked out onto the sidewalk. Greg had Jackie propped on one arm, the bag with the DVDs in the other hand. A group of two couples were approaching them from up the sidewalk. They paused in order to let the couples pass them, but the couples insisted they go first.
Mycroft was embarrassed, loathe as he was to admit it even to himself. He had obviously let the situation get to him, and he wasn’t thinking straight.
“Liz, do you remember last night when I asked you if you were hurt?” Liz nodded. “And you shrugged, which I thought meant that you weren’t hurt.”
“I think I will lay down, now,” Mycroft said. “But I will not sleep. I have done that enough, already.” Mycroft laid Jackie on her back beside him, lying on his side on the thigh that was not shot. Jackie looked at him from her position on her back. “Would you care to join us?” Mycroft asked tentatively of Greg.
“Tea?” Mycroft asked. Both men answered in the affirmative and Mycroft moved to start the kettle as John set out the needles on the table. By the time Mycroft was done making the tea, Sherlock was done feeding Jackie and she was sitting happily on his lap, waving her fists sporadically. He had one arm wrapped around her waist and the other one was waving in front of her, captivating her attention. Mycroft brought the two mugs of tea to the table and placed them in front of John and Sherlock.
"Shift switch successfully completed at 02:30," Anthea's voice buzzed quietly in his ear. "Free to move, sir. You should have ten minutes to get in and out before the guards are near your area of the labs."
“No, not tonight.” Sherlock regarded John once more before gently pulling his feet out from under John’s hands and rotating 180 degrees, plopping his head in John’s lap instead. “Continue,” he said imperiously, humming low in his throat as John’s fingers slid gently into his dark curls. John didn’t make comment, just continued to run his hands soothingly along Sherlock’s scalp and down to his neck. Sherlock’s eyes closed involuntarily and he felt his mind drift, not settling on any one particular thought.
Mycroft looked back up at Greg for a moment before stalking over to him and handing Jackie back to him.
“Liz!” John cried as Sherlock practically crashed into her, kneeling down wrapping his arms around her. John bent down and wrapped his arms around both of them, breathing out a quiet “oh my god”.
“Yes, I believe there is a store in town that will provide what we need,” Mycroft said. “We will stop there first, and then pick up groceries before going home.”
“Yes, we’ll go get you some food,” Greg chuckled. Picking her up, Greg went to the kitchen and grabbed a bottle and enough snacks for the afternoon for both him and Jackie. Then he went to the sitting room and grabbed toys for Jackie and books for both of them. Carrying it all, he went back into his room, sitting on the chair again and giving Jackie the bottle. She happily sucked it back, dropping the bottle onto Greg’s lap when she was done with it. Greg gave her a digestive cracker to munch on, which she did happily. Halfway through, she offered the mushy cracker to Greg.
“Did you really think we hadn’t put more security on the building after last time?” she asked calmly, gun not wavering in her hand.
“I think this is it,” he said, turning to Greg with a smile. They were standing at the large windows lining the wall, overlooking the skyline of London.
“I look forward to it," Anthea said with a small smirk, turning away and heading back towards the car.
“Don’t take that tone with me,” the man who belonged to the hand said, voice low. He was taller than Sherlock by a couple of inches and built more broadly. A man and a woman stood behind him, both leering at Sherlock.
They pulled up a little over an hour later to a small house surrounded by trees and not much else. Mycroft got out, making sure to grab the diaper bag on his way out.
By the time they got to the restaurant, Jackie was well on her way to a fit. Mycroft pulled a digestive cookie out of the diaper bag and gave it to Jackie, who whined a little more before sticking it in her mouth, glaring at Mycroft to let him know she was unimpressed.
“Liz, we can’t help you if you don’t tell us what happened. You won’t be in trouble, I promise.” A long moment of silence passed before Liz’s small voice filled the room.
“Perfect,” he said, picking it up and dropping that into the cart as well. “I’m not sure if you’re walking yet, or what your mobility is, so we’ll hold off on a walker right now.” Then another brightly coloured toy caught his eye. “Or maybe not. A 3-in-1 bounce, stride and ride elephant. Well, that seems good for all developmental stages. Let’s get one of those then, shall we?” He put the large box into the shopping cart. Then he spotted a brightly coloured, flashing toy. “This?” he asked hesitantly, showing it to Jackie.
“No! No! No! No! No!” Sherlock shouted, punctuating each “no” with a stomp up the stairs. When he had reached the top he stomped into the room, slamming the door behind him.
When he emerged once more into the sitting room, Mycroft crossed to the sofa and sat down, plunking the two mugs of tea onto the low coffee table located in front of the sofa.
When they arrived at their destination, Sherlock swooped out of the cab, leaving John to pay the cabbie. By the time John exited the cab, Sherlock was already down a dark alley on the public side of the tape, listening intently to the same D.I. as the first crime scene.
He arrived at the base a few hours later, back-up close behind. This time, the plan was to find the head of the project and put a stop to the whole program. Mycroft had had enough of being on high alert, and he couldn’t stand the idea of other helpless children being taken advantage of.
“Yes. Now, that’s all I wished to discuss. Is there anything you would like to discuss or ask of my list?”
“No, no, she’s an orphan, both parents dead in a plane crash. Maybe that’s what I saw in her. I don’t know. But now she’s in danger. Because of me she is in more danger than she was in that stupid lab. I shouldn’t keep her, but I will never be able to give her up to a safer life. How selfish.” He was quiet for a moment as he took a long sip from his glass and topped it up. “I’m sorry,” he said suddenly.
John and Sherlock meet again and talk a little more, and Sherlock starts to be swayed. Meanwhile, Greg and Mycroft see each other for the second time in person.
“Shh,” Mycroft soothed, gently bouncing up and down. “You’re probably hungry, but stores don’t open for another,” here he checked his watch, “five hours. Please don’t wake up.” Jaclynn seemingly complied, stilling once more in his arms as her breathing evened out. “Good girl.” They reached his floor, the penthouse in his building, and he got out of the elevator, digging his key out of his pocket and shifting Jaclynn to his uninjured side, inserting the key into the lock and pressing his thumb to the print-scanner beside the doorknob that he had had installed when he first moved in. With a click the door unlocked and he pushed it open. Turning on the light in his front hall, Mycroft kicked off his shoes and beelined to his bedroom, stopping briefly in the kitchen to drop off the ORS on the counter. Quietly opening the door to his bedroom, he placed Jaclynn gently on his bed and arranged pillows to bracket her on both sides of her torso, keeping her in place. Grabbing a thin blanket from the end of his bed, he tucked it gently around her small body. Looking at her for a moment, Mycroft smiled gently before turning to his closet and opening it, quickly taking out a sleep shirt and sleep pants. He donned them, careful of his grazed side, and climbed into the bed beside Jaclynn. Turning to face her, he watched her eyes flicker behind her pale closed lids. There was still a light sheen of sweat beading on her face, so Mycroft picked up a corner of the blanket, gently running it over her face to clear it of sweat. Jaclynn’s brow furrowed momentarily before smoothing out once more, and Mycroft watched her sleep for as long as he could before he succumbed to sleep as well.
“We can pick that one up, too. We’ll read it together.” John stood and ran his hand over Liz’s head. “Liz, I’m going to go look at the Healer books right over there.” John pointed to a shelf a few bookshelves down that was still in sight. “I want you to stay here with Rose and keep looking at books. I won’t be out of sight, alright?”
When he made his way downstairs a few minutes later he was met with the sight of the dining room table laden with all of his favorites, and his family gathered around the table.
“It sounds like you are both in a very good place. And it also looks like our time is up. For our next appointment, please think of a time when you didn’t communicate properly with each other, and how that affected your relationship.”
Sherlock’s eyes flitted around the room, taking in the small one-bedroom flat easily. They were in the main room, near the front door.
“Do you think that’s something that you’ll be able to get over, or should we pause here for the night?”
“Yeah, this is going to work out just fine,” Greg sighed. “But we should probably talk a little more before getting too lost in,” here he gestured between the two of them, “this.”
“Now as usual, we will use the traffic light system. If at any time you feel like you are in danger or in an unbearable amount of pain or you want to stop for any reason whatsoever, you say red. If you want me to slow down or pause, you say yellow. If you’re liking what’s happening, you use green.”
“No,” Greg said calmly. If he was to die today, at least it would be protecting a child he loved. He spared a moment of regret for not getting to say goodbye to his own children before resolutely making eye contact with the woman. Jackie started crying. “I’m not handing her over.”
“Good.” Sherlock closed his eyes again. “Can I hold her?” he asked quietly without opening his eyes.
“That’s nice.” The woman smiled at Jackie before looking at the two men in front of her, a twinkle in her eye. “Why don’t you give us a kiss, then.”
“Even so, kiss your daughter.” Mycroft, realizing resistance was futile, leaned in to kiss Jackie. “Have fun, you two,” he said, leaning back and smiling at Greg as he answered his phone. “Holmes,” he said into the phone, going into the study and closing the door.
“I’m sure you are.” She turned back towards the shelves. “So we’ve got these three models, I would recommend this one because it is adjustable and can be turned into a booster car seat as she gets older.” She was pointing at a vibrant red and black model that was mid-sized compared to the others.
“I’m fine,” Mycroft snapped. He knew he was acting irrational in his anger but couldn’t seem to stop.
“Are you asking because you just saw that submissive police officer wannabe go outside?” Sherlock asked pointedly.
“Why the hell would they make anyone go through this?” Greg asked tiredly after a moment. “I felt like shit all day.”
“Likewise. You were extraordinary. Remember to drink water and take an ibuprofen tonight, you had quite a bit to drink.”
Ten minutes later, Sherlock was gently snoring in John’s lap and John thought he had never felt so in love. Gently he eased his fingers out of Sherlock’s hair, knowing Mycroft would be coming home soon. “Sherlock?” he called gently, tapping him lightly on the shoulder. “Sherlock, wake up.” Sherlock’s eyes slowly cracked open.
“John, come look.” John crouched down next to Sherlock. “Clearly bled out, shot twice in the chest. What can you observe?”
“Honestly? A little worried we won’t be able to help Liz the way she needs. And a little overwhelmed. Everything’s moving so quickly. I’m worried we may have taken on more than we an handle.”
“It’s not that I don’t want to go down, t’s that I have more important things to do.” Sherlock was avoiding eye contact with John, looking pointedly at the floor.
“Now! Seven minutes in the corner, and then we’ll talk. While you’re there, I don’t want to see you moving, and I want you to think of why you’re in the corner, and how you will avoid being there in the future.” John gave him a glare that said he meant business.
“Aren’t you always getting annoyed at my prying? Here’s your chance to fend for yourself. I’ll find you later,” Mycroft promised.
Jackie was starting to squirm in his arms again, beginning to get bored of waiting. “I know, pretty girl, it’s dull, but we have to wait for Daddy and his men.”
“And what if you give an order that I’m incapable of following? Physically or mentally? Will you punish me for that? And what about when I’m physically too tired to go on. Why should I be punished simply because I’m physically exhausted from a long day at work?”
“Actually, I obtained some information about Jackie before I got shot. If you look in the lining of my tac jacket, you’ll find documents detailing a booster that was administered to Jackie.” John picked up the jacket, finding the papers after a little more direction from Mycroft. He opened them up, eyes scanning quickly over the papers.
“Well that was all obvious, but not necessarily wrong. He was killed by his wife, who has life insurance out on him. Obvious in the area of skin around his ring and the mud on the bottom of his shoes. She shot him in an alley as a way to make it look impersonal, so that she wouldn’t be suspected. She should be at home right now, but will be running shortly so you may want to get a move on.” Sherlock looked up at the D.I. who was hovering over his shoulder, furiously scribbling in his notebook.
Sherlock felt his heart rate pick up slightly. The idea of John beating someone else up for him had a disgustingly saccharine affect on him.
“Of course.” Mycroft thought for a minute more, but couldn’t bear sitting at home waiting to hear news. “I’m coming. I’ll be there in fifteen minutes.”
“Sherlock, you don’t talk to me that way. This is your warning.” John was starting to lose patience. “Now come on, let’s get changed.”
“Sure.” John moved to the side to allow Mycroft to carefully toe his way inside. He leaned his umbrella on the wall by the door and continued inside, standing in front of the coffee table.
“Next one,” John called over Jackie’s wails, pinching the skin on her left arm and getting the needle in and out of her arm as quickly as possible. “Last one,” John said, coming closer to Mycroft and Jackie.
“Let’s try this, shall we?” he asked, sitting down on one of the chairs at the kitchen table and sitting Jackie on his lap. Opening the container, Mycroft dipped the spoon into the purée and presented it to Jackie. Leaning forward, she wrapped her lips around the small spoon and Mycroft pulled it out of her mouth, clean. She smacked her lips, a clear invitation for more.
Well, we are nearing the end, I have an epilogue that I'll hopefully post in the next week or so, and I will probably write more in this universe eventually. Hope you've enjoyed it, let me know if you did :)
“Sherlock,” he heard John’s voice dimly, but didn’t notice any speakers in the room that could be the source of the voice. “Sherlock?” he heard again. Slowly he came out of his Mind Palace, the notes he was absently playing on the violin petering out. He opened his eyes.
“Yes, we will.” Turning back, Mycroft quickly gathered the diaper bag and discarded papousse and motioned for the doctor to lead the way. The three of them followed her in silence until they reached a closed door. When Dr. Michaels opened the door, she revealed a pale, sleeping Sherlock stretched out on a crisp, clean hospital bed.
He sat back down, opening his laptop but keeping one eye on Liz. He watched her wake fully, open and closing her eyes before sitting up and sliding off Sherlock’s lap. She kept the blanket wrapped around her.
“I don’t think you realize how hot it was when you were chasing down that woman,” Sherlock breathed.
“No, brother, she was talking to this figurine of a cow,” he said, showing Sherlock the figure. Sherlock looked amused.
“Hello Constable Lestrade, D.I. Nolan. I am here to inform you that the government will be taking over the case and your assistance is no longer necessary.”
“Much,” Greg said. “Just one more thing.” He reached forward, unbuttoning the first two buttons of Mycroft’s shirt. Mycroft jerked back a little initially and then held still, gulping when Greg’s fingers lingered at his throat.
Sherlock peered at John. “As much as I’m sure your dominant side would like to see me home yourself, my brother is also a dominant and very much holds that fact above my head, so you need not worry.”
When Liz opened it, she saw a beautiful locket an inch long nestled in the fabric. It was made of a dark wood with delicate silver filigree covering it.
“Make sure she sleeps,” Sherlock told Mycroft. Mycroft knew it was his brother’s way of showing his affection towards Jackie. They let themselves out while Mycroft moved into the bedroom, gently laying Jackie in the crib and pulling the light blanket over her. She went down without much of a fuss, falling readily into a deep sleep.
“Hail a cab,” John ordered him. Petulantly, Sherlock held out his hand and flagged down a cab. They slid in and John gave the address, leaning back into the seat and putting his hand over Sherlock’s. “If you don’t stop pouting, I’ll have to smack some sense into that arse of yours,” he said under his breath, leaning close to Sherlock’s ear. Sherlock shuddered, nuzzling his nose into the crook of John’s neck.
“The lipstick on his collar is from his lover, right before he died. Clearly seducing him, getting him into an alley for ease of killing him. There are hairs from two different kinds of cats, two breeds that generally don’t get along. Two different households that he visits. There’s a significant amount more of one, so he lives with one. There’s also a hamster in that household. One cat belongs to his girlfriend, and one to one of his lovers. How do I know it’s two lovers and not one? A woman wearing that shade of lipstick wouldn’t own a cat. Three women, then. And the stain on his left knee. Clearly, he went down on one knee tonight. I think he was proposing to his girlfriend. The lover, jealous, kills him in a fit of rage. Crime of passion. Boring.” Sherlock shrugged.
Greg drank his tea more slowly, watching Mycroft from his chair. Jackie was now crawling towards Greg on the bed.
“Goodnight, John,” Mycroft said, lifting his hand. John let himself out of the flat and took the stairs quickly, emerging into the cool night air and tucking his hands into his pockets and letting a goofy grin grace his face. Pulling out his phone, he quickly typed out a text for Sherlock to read when he woke up.
They ended in a brightly-coloured corner of the shop, small robes of all colours stuffed onto several racks along the wall.
“Hello!” Greg exclaimed, swinging her up into his arms and kissing her on the cheek. “Have you been causing trouble?”
“There was the director of Sherrinford,” Mycroft said brokenly when he re-caught his breath. “And his wife. And three innocent men. All of whom died for no reason. And all at my hand, although not directly. No, I was too much of a coward for even that. Even when a man begged me, I couldn’t do it.” Mycroft laughed humorlessly. “And then of course, she made us turn on each other. And I tried to convince Sherlock to kill me.” Mycroft voice broke and his body shuddered as he relived the moment. “He pointed that gun right at me and at that moment, all I could think was that I didn’t get to say goodbye to you.” Mycroft met Greg’s eyes, tears slipping down his cheeks. “But I knew it had to be me. Sherlock could survive without me, but he would never be able to go on without John.” Mycroft sniffed quietly. “I would have done it, Gregory. Left you behind. You’re strong. You could survive. But not Sherlock. Not Sherlock.” Mycroft turned his face into his pillow, guilt washing over him again.
“Traffic light system,” Sherlock replied readily. “Red for stop, yellow for pause or slow down, and green for go.”
“All you have is Earl Grey, so I assume that will suffice,” he called good-naturedly from the kitchen.
“If I must,” Sherlock drawled, but his heart wasn’t in it. He slunk out of the room and came back quickly, teddy bear in hand. Giving it to Mycroft, Sherlock sat in his chair once more, staying out of the way. Mycroft took it in his left, snaking his right arm around Jackie and trapping her arms under his.
John and Sherlock arrived at the Ministry via Floo Powder ten minutes later. As soon as they stepped out of the fireplace, they were greeted by Anthea.
Lestrade, who had been staring at the papousse, jerked out of his distraction. “Yeah, one of my constables caught him on his way out the door. Sorry, is that a baby?”
“Of course I believe you,” Sherlock sighed. “I’ve always been able to recognize your honesty when talking about dynamics. And you haven’t given me cause to think you’re being deceitful in any way, consciously or otherwise.”
“Good.” Greg ran to the sitting room and then returned to the bedroom holding the baby carrier. “Ta-da!” he said, proud of his idea.
Mycroft deliberated for a moment. Although he didn’t feel necessarily comfortable punishing his sub when he didn’t feel he deserved it, he also knew it was something that Greg needed.
Liz seemed to be the only one not crying, standing apart from everyone else with wide eyes. She flung herself into John’s arms when they entered, burrowing her face in John’s jumper.
It all started when Sherlock turned fourteen. Well, it actually all started when Mycroft turned fourteen, but Sherlock was only nine at the time and was therefore oblivious to the change in his brother’s life.
"I wouldn't make any sudden moves if I were you," Mycroft warned the woman. "Grab the child and I will allow you to leave unharmed. I was never here. You were never here."
“Okay,” John agreed after giving Sherlock a long, scrutinizing look. “But don’t be afraid to call a stop to everything.”
Sherlock found he could not lie. “I have been texting one,” he admitted. “We seem to be getting along. Only time will tell I suppose.”
Greg chuckled tolerantly. “Alright.” He laid a gentle kiss on Mycroft’s lips. Then he turned to the realtor who was again waiting patiently by the door. “We’re going to have to make some adjustments to our flat specs.”
“Liz, come on out,” John coaxed, pulling her slightly away from his midsection. She turned her head so that she was looking at Hermione, but didn’t move to pull away from John.
“Thanks,” she said, reaching in and grabbing the rag. Wringing it out, she wiped the wound on Mycroft’s leg. Greg realized that she had cut off the leg of Mycroft’s tac suit in order to reach the wound. When she was done cleaning and drying it, she inspected it for a moment before pulling out a needle and filling it with lidocaine. She numbed the front of Mycroft’s thigh quickly and then got the thread and needle ready.
“On the contrary, I have every faith you will both be exactly what she needs. You’ll be able to show her that magic isn’t a bad thing, for one.”
“You’re safe with us now,” John reassured her once more. “We promise, we’ll take care of you, alright?”
“Hm, quite smart,” Mycroft acknowledged as Greg strapped it onto himself. Mycroft handed Jackie to Greg, who kissed her on the head before sliding her into the holder on his front, her head tucked into his chest. Once she was secure, he slung his arm around Mycroft’s back.
“Dear Ms. Watson-Holmes,” she read aloud as Sherlock came in from the kitchen, sleeves rolled up and a beaker in his hand. “We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later that 31 July. Yours sincerely, Minverva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress.” She beamed up at them. “I really get to go!”
“Good to know.” Mycroft took his hand back to write a note on his copy of Greg’s list. “I don’t know that I will end up using them, but it’s good to have the option.” Mycroft ran down the list once more. “As previously discussed, we will be exclusive to each other.” Greg nodded. “Now, for bathroom use control, you mention the difficulty of day-to-day activity. If we did do this type of play it would only be in a pre-planned scene that wouldn’t last more than a few hours. Some examples of what that might look like are age play where you wear a diaper, golden showers, or it could be a punishment where you’re not allowed to visit the bathroom for a certain amount of time.”
“Of course,” Mycroft responded, shocked at the doctor’s outburst. “I’m just not sure how to do that.”
“’Kay.” Charlie did as instructed, wobbling slightly under the weight of the pot but managing to get it on the stove without spilling a drop.
“Da! Da! Da!” Jackie happily slapped two blocks together as she repeated the word over and over again into the camera on Mycroft’ mobile.
“-but you need to toe the line if you don’t want to be kicked off this case.” Greg continued as if Sherlock hadn’t interrupted him. “Just think, you be good, finish this case, and John will put you down nice and easy.” Sherlock, despite himself, did like the sound of that.
“Oh dear,” Mycroft sighed, pulling her out of the shopping cart and propping her on his hip, bouncing her gently as she continued to sob. “There, there,” he soothed. “We’re just going to have to borrow that for a second, my dear,” he continued, gently prying the teddy bear from Jackie’s fingers. She sobbed even harder, and the saleswoman quickly scanned the bear before handing it back to Mycroft. “Thank you.” He quickly pulled out his card and paid, bouncing Jackie continuously in his arms to no avail. “Come, Jackie, it’s okay.” Then, he remembered a trick that used to work on Sherlock when he was a baby. Digging in his pockets, Mycroft pulled out his house keys and dangled them in front of Jackie, getting them to jangle enticingly. Jackie’s sobs slowed as she focused on the keys in front of her. Reaching out, she grabbed onto the keys and tugged, sticking one into her mouth happily and dropping her bear in the process. As long as she was quiet and happy, Mycroft was happy as well. Picking up the dropped bear, he threw it in a bag. His driver approached just then, grabbing the assembled bags in both hands and walking towards the door. Mycroft followed, taking a content Jackie with him. He slid into the backseat, holding her once more on his lap. Although he had purchased a car seat, he was having it delivered along with the other big items. The drive was quiet, Mycroft occasionally jangling the keys in front of Jackie to keep her occupied. When they got in, Mycroft and the driver went up to his flat, and the driver dropped the bags in the sitting room.
“Yeah,” Greg dropped Mycroft’s hand, positioning himself on the opposite side of the bed from Marcia so that he could push. Together they flipped Mycroft over onto his back, his head tilted towards Greg. Greg took Mycroft’s hand again as Marcia picked up the needle, giving another shot of lidocaine to Mycroft. Marcia picked up the needle, making the first jab into Mycroft’s skin. At the first jab, Mycroft stirred, groaning as his eyes cracked open.
“Oh my god,” Greg breathed shakily. “That was possibly the best orgasm I have ever had in my life. Thank you so much.”
“My sentiments exactly,” Sherlock replied, putting the bag on the counter as they entered the kitchen.
“Hands behind your head!” John barked and Sherlock quickly obeyed with a soft growl. “Seven minutes starts now. No moving.”
“Diaper change,” he proclaimed, moving into her bedroom to the changing table there. Quickly Mycroft unsnapped her onesie, opening the nappy on auto-pilot.  He glanced quickly at the nappy, stopping when he noticed the rosy colour found within. Mycroft’s mind stuttered momentarily and, without giving it a second thought, Mycroft was pulling out his mobile and choosing Gregory’s number in his contacts. Putting the phone up to his ear, he waited impatiently while Jackie started to fuss, the air on her bare bottom uncomfortable. The line rang three times before clicking through.
“The goal here is to incapacitate any security that might be in the building. From our intel, we know that there are only four scientists who partake in this particular experiment. At this time of night, the leader of the program will be the only one in the building. She will be my target. Our back-up is approximately ten minutes away, but unless there is exponentially more security than predicted, we should be fine and they will serve more as clean up. Any questions?”
“Shouldn’t you boys be getting home? It’s kind of late.” “John looked at his watch, noticing it was shortly after ten.
“Unfortunately, no,” Greg said. “We’re just going to wait on Mycroft, and then we’ll be on our way, hopefully with the rest of your company in tow.”
John glanced over to see Sherlock put his last toy away, closing the lid on the toy box and glancing back at John.
“It will be on a temporary basis at first but, if all goes well, we will see about making it more permanent. For right now, I think it’s best you both help Liz to heal.”
"She seems to be about thirteen months, if it matters," Marcia supplied, both of them gazing at Jaclynn as she fought to keep her eyes open.
Sorry I haven't posted in a long time, I haven't had a day off in two months so it's been me sitting in small spurts to try to get this out. I can't promise it'll get any better for the next few months, but I haven't forgotten this story, I promise!!
He felt her nod against the small of his back, and he reached down and unwound her arms from his waist. He turned around, picking her up and continuing into the kitchen. He sat her in one of the chairs by the table.
“First thing as soon as the shops open,” Mycroft responded as he climbed out of the ambulance, Jaclynn cradled carefully in him arms.
“Thanks Sherlock,” John said warmly. “You’re a good submissive.” Sherlock tried to quash the warm feeling that wriggled in his stomach for a moment before deciding the effort wasn’t worth it. Although they hadn’t engaged in any sort of dynamic play, it was the small things like John constantly looking out for him or Sherlock continuously trying to make John proud that helped them know they were compatible. “Now, how do you take your tea?”
“I’m not sure what drew me to her,” he admitted, staring determinedly into his glass. “Why I didn’t just hand her off to CPS, or leave her there for someone else to find.”
“I can take no credit for that,” Mycroft said as he emerged from the bathroom, straightening his tie.
John placed his hand on Sherlock’s warm lower back, rubbing lightly as he reared back and let the paddle land on Sherlock’s ass. Sherlock rocked forward with the impact and moaned low in his throat at the deep ache that took a moment to sink into his skin. John hit him another two times with the paddle before pausing.
Darkness stretched out endlessly in front of him, a halo of light surrounding him from the small window in the door the only illumination into the room. Digging in one of the many pockets of his tac suit, Mycroft retrieved a flashlight and clicked it on, creating a concentrated circle of light. Swinging the beam back and forth, he took in the rows and rows of long, empty workbenches, supplies piled on the counters and in the cupboards lining the walls. Quietly, Mycroft stalked down the main aisle, scouring the space for a filing cabinet or desk that might hold the information he was after. Going deeper into the room he noticed another metal door at the end of the main aisle, this one without a window. He hummed quietly under his breath, considering whether he should enter the room.
“I wonder what’s going on,” Greg said softly to Jackie in a silly voice, keeping her entertained. She chortled in response.
“Well, since we haven’t ironed out limits yet, your punishment will be that we will start at the beginning of the list again, and you will repeat each item that I say and then give me an honest number. Am I clear?”
“John,” Sherlock murmured sadly, sitting on the side of the bed but not touching him. “Let me at least get you untangled from the sheets, okay?”
Hearing Gregory’s voice snapped Mycroft out of his panicked daze. He practically ran the whole country for God’s sake, but every time Jackie so much as bumped herself he panicked.
When they made it back to Baker Street, John paid the cabbie and they all climbed out and up the stairs. John was helping Liz out of her coat when there was a call from downstairs.
“Sherlock,” John mumbled, face contorting into a pained expression. “Sherlock, no!” Tears started coursing down his face.
“Seems harmless enough, mostly just a mixture of vitamins and immune system boosters. I’ll take a look at her and you should keep an eye on her, but I’m not too worried. Luckily, it seems to have actually helped.”
“Hello beautiful, were you quiet so that daddy and papa could get more sleep this morning?” he asked as he lifted her out of the cot. He checked her nappy. “Ah, looks like we need a nappy change.” He laid her down on the changing table and unsnapped her onesie, changing her nappy with a practiced ease. Snapping her back into the onesie, Mycroft moved out to the sitting room, Jackie in his arms.
“Give us a ring tomorrow, let us know how it’s going,” John said as he made his way carefully towards the door. “Wait- your people are outside, aren’t they?”
“Who’d want a freak like him anyway?” the woman sneered, turning on her heel and leaving. The other two quickly followed after shooting murderous looks at Sherlock.
“Sorry,” John said waving his hand. “That was just amazing.” A giggle escaped through his tightly pursed lips. Sherlock felt a chuckle escape from him and soon both he and John were overcome by giggles as they walked away, hand in hand, from the crime scene.
“I know a few people who have done it, with only a few accidents, but let me see if there’s a particular daycare I can find. I’d also suggest trying to get her to talk to you. She seems to trust you already, maybe she’ll talk to you more than she’ll talk to me.”
“There are always non-perishables stored in these houses, and we will go into town tomorrow to pick up groceries.”
“Please,” Greg said quietly, looking up at Mycroft. Mycroft reached to his chair, where he had discarded the collar. Picking it up, he leaned forward and slipped it around the back of Greg’s neck, carefully clasping it at the front.
“Why isn’t he in hospital?” Greg asked as he watched her, frustrated that there was nothing he could do to help.
“Four,” Sherlock was tapping away at his phone. It was held precariously over his face as he lay on the sofa, head in John’s lap. At their first therapy session, the therapist had handed John what he called a ‘limits list’, a long checklist of activities often found in dom/sub relationships. Even though this list was based off of relationships between unmodified adults, it provided a strong basis for discussions between couples.  They had been sitting on the sofa for twenty minutes already and Sherlock had been steadily giving curt answers. John made notes diligently on the paper- although Sherlock didn’t know it, they would be going over the list again to discuss each answer once they were done going through it.
When they were done, Greg took both their dishes quickly washed them while Mycroft laid a changing mat on the table and changed Jackie’s nappy.
“We’re almost there. It’s best to get it over with now and then you can hold onto her for as long as you want afterwards.”
John had received a text message last night from Mycroft that read “8:00 a.m. Dr. Clark Witter. Wizard and PhD.”
“One minute,” Mycroft told Jackie, leaving her happily babbling to herself in the high chair he had unpacked that morning. Reaching the sitting room, he picked up his phone.
“It was very nice to meet you,” she said beaming at all of them. “Maybe Liz can come over and play sometime?”
“Very smart!” she said. “Well, let me show you the models we have here.” She circled out from behind the counter and bustled down an aisle, not looking back to see if the two men would follow. They did, Greg taking the lead.
John gently opened the door, poking his head in. Sherlock was sitting on the white-washed bed on top of the cartoon sheets, knees drawn up to his chest and arms crossed on top. His Belstaff was fanned out behind him like a muddy cape.
They sat together, letting one episode roll into the next. John kept glancing down at Liz and, although she had a small furrow between her brows, she seemed happy enough to sit and watch telly.
“That’s enough,” John snapped, snatching the phone out of Sherlock’s hand and tucking it between his back and the back of the sofa. “Why aren’t you taking this seriously?” he asked, exasperated.
“Good.” Jackie was craning her neck, trying to locate the other voices in the room. “Yes, it is a baby, her name is Jackie. Seeing as we’re going to be here for a while, I’d like to get her out of here. Doctor, your assistance?”
“Do you want to find eggs, as well?” Mycroft asked as he put her on her feet, keeping hold of her hands to keep her steady. She happily chased after Alice and Charlie, Mycroft making sure she didn’t fall. Greg watched it all from his perch on the sofa, laughing and enjoying the view of his family having fun.
“Sure,” Hermione answered. They all made their way over to the table. “Hi Liz, it’s nice to see you again,” Hermione said, smiling warmly at Liz as she sat down across from her. Ron sat down beside her, across from John.
Sherlock nodded, sucking hard on his pacifier and enraptured with the mermaids dancing in the water. John watched him indulgently for a moment before going into Sherlock’s room, taking a pair of footie pajamas and a nappy back into the bathroom.
There was a note of panic in Sherlock’s voice that John had never heard before, and it grounded him. Clearly he would need to be the composed one this time.
“We’re going to stop in hereand say hi to George, so we’ll be parting ways. It was good to see all of you again. We should do this again soon.”
Hi guys, thank you so much for reading! This may the last story in this story, or there may be one more, and then I'll be doing one-shots as serrate stories in the series after that. I'm kind of at a loss at where to go from here, I'm thinking children, but if anyone has something specific they'd like to see, please feel free to comment.
Greg gaped at him for a moment. “I- what? You think I don’t care? God, are you thick? I literally sat here for hours waiting for you to come back and then waiting for you to wake up, and you think I did that because I don’t care? Where the hell did you pull that from?” Greg was ramping right back up. “Look Myc, I don’t know why the hell you think that would be the case, if something happened in your childhood or whatever, but I do care for you. Goddammit I haven’t felt an obligation to be here since after that first day. This has been, I hesitate to say now, nice. Really rather enjoyable, for all that we were being chased by bad guys. And before that, I really thought we were becoming friends, at least. More, hopefully. So don’t you dare pull that ‘not obligated’ shit out of your ass. I love you, Mycroft Holmes, and I love Jackie and I would love to be a part of your life if you’d let me!” Greg’s voice had not gone down in intensity, so he ended up partially screaming the last part.
“She disappeared.” Sherlock blinked a few times, trying to clear his thoughts. “We were about to pour the vinegar when the beaker shattered in our hands. I got the brunt of it, but she got startled and disappeared. How do we find her, John?”
“And she’s not taking it so well. Yeah, I can hear her over the line. Have you tried your usuals for soothing her?”
“What now?” he asked Jackie. “Shall we see what Daddy brought you to play with?” Jackie clapped her hands, smiling. Moving into the sitting room, Greg opened the diaper bag and pulled out blocks, teddy and a small plastic tea set that played music when different buttons were pressed. Jackie immediately reached for the blocks, picking one up and putting it on the ground, picking up another and lining it up with the first. “Very good,” Greg praised, clapping his hands. Jackie smiled and clapped her hands in return. Picking up both blocks, she slapped them together, producing a sharp sound. She laughed maniacally, doing it a couple more times. Greg chuckled back, piling a few blocks one on top of the other. Then, with a glee reserved for childish pleasure, he knocked them down. Jackie looked shocked and a little scandalized until Greg piled a few more blocks closer to her. Carefully, she reached out and pushed them, toppling the tower over. Giggling, she clapped her hands together once more, Greg joining in.
“Quickly, if you please.” Mycroft could feel the blood steadily draining out of his leg, and spots were starting to dance. He focused on one point on the wall ahead of him, trying to maintain consciousness as he simultaneously watched over the scientist in front of him.
“Does it really matter who?” Mycroft asked, trying to avoid eye contact even though they were inches apart.
“Hold on, I think there’s a list of different kinds of service down near the bottom… Ah yes, here we go. So, serving as art.”
She started sobbing again, all the fight going out of her. John sat and rocked her for what felt like hours, until her sobs slowed and her eyes fell closed as she cried herself to exhaustion.
“You can’t know that just from those,” the camera technician, a man in his mid-twenties, scoffed from his position beside the body.
Eventually Jackie grew tired, crawling back towards Greg and holding her arms to be picked up. Greg scooped her up and held her close. “How about a story?” he asked her, leaning down and picking up the first picture book he saw. It was “The Jolly Postman”, one of Greg’s favourites. He read it to her, holding it so she could see and touch the pages as he was reading. Soon she was leaning her head back against his chest, fast asleep. Greg stopped reading, putting the book down beside him and closing his eyes. He figured he was safe to rest them for a moment.
“No means never, a.k.a. a hard limit. Zero means I don’t like it but would do it if you really wanted to, a.k.a. soft limit. One means I’ll do it if you ask. Two means I’ll do it but it doesn’t have any particular positive effect on me. Three means I like it occasionally. Four means I like it and would like to experience it regularly. Five means it is incredibly pleasurable to me.”
“I picked the lock. And you have my thumbprint encoded into the system, as well as Anthea’s and John’s.”
“Ah, is that the dynamic in this relationship?” Sherlock asked, eyes cutting between the two of them.
“We’re on vacation here,” Greg said, taking over as Mycroft found the bottle of juice and handed it to Jackie.
Sherlock let his eyes run over John once more, but could detect no lie or deceit, and offered up his phone. “Here, put your number in my phone and I’ll send you a message.”
Greg felt his breath catch slightly at the words Mycroft had never said before. “It has to do with the fact that if you’re punishing me for not good reasons, I won’t be a part of that relationship. And saying that you love me won’t get you out of trouble,” he said around a dry patch in his throat. “We still need to talk about you not listening to me.”
“Good,” John said distractedly, looking into her eyes. Putting his hand gently on her cheek, he pulled down the bottom lid so that he could examine her eye. He quickly did the same on the other side. “Eyes are clear. Penlight?” he asked from the brothers.
Sherlock reluctantly clambered off John’s lap, rubbing his arm across his face and tucking his thumb once more in his mouth.
“It’s been a long day,” Mycroft whispered, looking down at her. “Sleep now, my love.” Going into the living room, he rooted through some bags before finding the baby monitors he had purchased. Quickly inserting the batteries, he turned them on and moved back to the bedroom, placing one on the floor by the bed. Taking the matching one, he moved back into the living room and stretched out on the couch. He had only gotten a few hours of sleep the night before and was starting to feel the exhaustion of a busy day. Moments later he fell asleep, baby monitor still clutched in his hand.
“Okay.” Greg backed away a step, making sure Mycroft got out of the car before turning and unlocking the door to his building. He could feel Mycroft following him so he didn’t bother turning to make sure, just passed through the doors until he was finally in his flat. Mycroft closed the door behind him and stood there, looking unsure.
“Well, I believe it’s time for us to go,” Mycroft said, standing. Sherlock followed suit, eager to be out of the line of fire.
“Don’t be absurd. Nobody in the village knows who I am. Tomorrow, we will go into town posing as a couple on vacation stocking up their cabin for the week.”
“They say it’s to provide stability for the submissive, and to care for them if they start going into subdrop. Also in case they are in need of punishment or being put into subspace. Like I said, ridiculous.”
“Yes,” Mycroft nodded. Greg had told him to go along with whatever he said, and it was the easiest option in Mycroft’s opinion.
John tossed and turned for hours until finally falling into a fitful sleep.  When he woke, the weak light of morning was shining through the curtains. John rolled over and looked at the clock. Neon numbers blinked 6:30 back at him. He sighed and rolled out of bed, throwing on a robe and heading straight downstairs.
John took his finger back. “Of course you’re not, no one really is and you didn’t have any time to prepare. That’s perfectly understandable. And you’ve got a support system. You’ve got me and your prat brother, even if he pretends otherwise, and you’ve got Greg and Anthea and Molly I’m sure. You are not alone, Mycroft Holmes, and don’t you forget it,” he finished fiercely.
“Look Jackie,” Mycroft cooed. “Teddy. Yes, good girl,” he cooed, shaking the bear in front of her. Meanwhile, John circled around behind them and reached Jackie’s right arm.
“I won’t be able to sleep anymore, but I will take the glass of water,” Mycroft said, leaning back. “Can I hold her?”
“Maybe not, but doms definitely still need the attention, it’s just a different kind. We crave the attention and trust of our subs the way you want to give us that submission. And personally, I would be obedient to anything my sub asked, but that’s just basic human decency. And someone kissing my foot would be a little strange, frankly.”
“Thanks, Hermione,” John said, looking down at Liz as she pulled slightly away. “Did you hear that, Liz? You get to stay with us. Is that okay?”
A curious look came into Liz eyes and she looked over at John and Sherlock, considering them for a moment before nodding and grinning a bit. She scampered over to Sherlock and John, clambering onto the couch so she was curled up between them.
“Of course,” Mycroft smiled at Greg’s dopey tone. He was clearly in subspace, if only a light one. “Come on, up we get,” Mycroft prompted, lightly tapping Greg on the bum to get him moving. Groaning, Greg clambered off of Mycroft’s lap, but glued himself to Mycroft once he was standing. Together, they made their way to the washroom where Mycroft carefully undressed Greg, placing the corset and collar to the side and throwing Greg’s pants in the laundry hamper. He then quickly undressed himself. “In we go,” Mycroft said, helping Greg into the shower and propping him against the wall. Turning up the hot water, Mycroft let the steam fill the shower as he ran his hands carefully down Greg’s chest. He lathered up a flannel and ran it efficiently over Greg’s body, washing the dried semen off of Greg’s cock and stomach. Greg stood boneless against the wall, grinning loosely at Mycroft.
“Now, I was told very firmly by Marcia that you need rest and fluids. So I’ve got a glass of water here that I want you to finish, and then you’ll be going back to sleep.”
“Alright, Little Miss. Let’s see here, jeans and a jumper I think. Ah, here we go.” Greg found the appropriate pieces of clothing in her wardrobe and pulled them on Jackie after making a quick nappy check. Greg grabbed a small rain jacket and put it on Jackie, just in case it started to rain. Moving back into the sitting room, Greg watched Mycroft slip a laptop and gun into the diaper bag. A loud bang reverberated through the room, followed shortly by another. They were trying to break down the door.
They had started the process of moving into their new apartment a few days ago and were slowly but surely settling in. The movers had done most of the work, settling the big pieces of furniture and getting all the boxes sorted into the right rooms. And then Mycroft had descended, nitpicky and ordering everyone about. Greg had found it endearing at the beginning but was now starting to feel a little chafed.
“Not to worry,” Greg said easily. “Jackie and I will put the groceries away, and then I think it will be time for a nap.” He smiled at Mycroft.
“Idiots!” Sherlock was stalking around the perimeter of a crime scene, careful not to disturb evidence even in his rage. “You’ve trampled all over the evidence. Does Scotland Yard purposefully hire negligent imbeciles to muddy up their crime scenes?”
“It’s a good thing I have a spare room,” Mycroft said to Jackie, who was sitting on the floor of said room, happily banging blocks on the floor. He had quickly snapped out of his panic after the moving men arrived, directing them to drop the large boxes in his spare room. He turned down their offer to help him set things up and sent them on their way with a generous tip.
“Not at all,” Mycroft agreed readily. “But the way I see it, we’re already pretty fucked. They modified us without our consent, yes, but they can’t unmodify us, so unless we figure out some way out of this biology, and trust me, Sherlock is always searching, I’m afraid we’re hooped.”
“Good thinking,” Greg said, scooping Jackie off the bed and holding her close. “She really is beautiful,” he said, brushing a bit of hair off her forehead.
“You are right,” John said, a glint in his eye, “but I will not hesitate to take care of you the second this case is over and we are home.”
“Putting aside how unhealthy that sounds, wouldn’t you want to do what makes me happy? Even if that means never seeing me again?”
Liz just nodded, nose buried in John’s neck. Sherlock stayed a moment more before going to the bathroom. When he returned, Liz was bundled in a blanket, and the telly was set at a low volume.
"Copy that. Going in now." Quietly Mycroft tiptoed to the door, pressing his ear to the seam and hearing nothing on the other side. He wrapped his fingers around the cool metal of the handle of the door and threw it open, gun preceding him into the room. Light spilled forth as the door swung open and Mycroft was greeted with the sight of a room shallower than the previous one, containing only one workbench and an examination table. At the examination table was a woman in her mid-twenties, hair tied back loosely into a ponytail and white lab coat hanging haphazardly on her frame, questionable stains covering it. Laying on the table in front of her was a small child, eyes glassy and blonde curls plastered to her forehead with sweat, dressed only in a diaper. She was sobbing quietly, hands pressed to her chest by one of the woman's hands.
Sherlock went limp, resigned to his fate. John, assuming he’d get compliance, went to lift Sherlock by the armpits. As he did, Sherlock leapt back into action, slithering out of John’s grasp. “No!”
“Hurry back,” Greg grinned impishly. Mycroft quickly went into the other room, coming back out with a box wrapped in gold wrapping paper.
“No! Jackie, don’t eat that!” Mycroft said, plucking the paper from her hand. Jackie’s lip jutted out and her mouth opened in preparation of a wail. “Look, Jackie,” Mycroft said, taking the wrapping off the rest of the present. Jackie’s impending cry was cut short as her attention was grabbed by the stuffed bunny being revealed. She let out a squeal as she reached forward, grasping onto the bunny’s soft fur. “That’s a rabbit,” Mycroft said gently as Jackie rubbed her face against the soft fur.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “No, of course not, don’t be silly. He’s just very controlling. About everything.”
John looked over towards the fireplace and saw Hermione stepping out of the fireplace, Rose following quickly behind and Ron bringing up the rear.
“No the situation is pretty self-explanatory. Clearly it was an accident and no repercussions will be implemented. I’d suggest Liz see a psychologist. We’re lucky she didn’t become an Obscurial, and we need to take steps to ensure it doesn’t happen.” Hermione looked at John gravely for a moment, making sure he understood the severity of the situation. “We’ll take care of everything else on the Magic and Muggle side.” She scrutinized them for a minute. “This is a lot for you two to take on,” she said carefully. “I just want to make sure you understand, as of right now we are not looking for alternative arrangements in terms of Liz’s guardianship.”
“I would only do it as a form of extreme punishment, and we would talk about it extensively first, but I don’t see it ever coming up,” John said.
“Of course not. I’ll be right over.” With that he hung up, not giving Mycroft the chance to go back on his decision.
A little while later Sherlock came to, realizing with a jolt that his brother was perched on the edge of his bed and was running his hand through his inky curls. Sherlock also noted with slight disgust that he was relaxing involuntarily into the soothing touch.
“Judging by the small stain on your pant leg and the state of your right cuff, I would say you know exactly what I mean.” Sherlock squinted at Mycroft. It was true he and John had been texting consistently since the night of the party, but they hadn’t been able to meet up yet.
“Right, because if it is, does “one” equal “not much” or is “one” nothing. Because strictly speaking zero should be nothing.”
“Sure, why not,” Sherlock replied. They found a quiet bench off to the side of the terrace and sat down, at least a foot of space between them. John took a pull from his beer and tipped his head back. The two sat in a fragile silence, only disrupted by the chirp of crickets and the muffled voices from inside.
This one is a bit of a shorter one, but we're getting near the end here, folks! Only a few chapters left!
“Alright. I do like the idea, but I will stick to it as a punishment for now. We can discuss at a further date if necessary.”
“Quite. Well, shall we go get ready?” Mycroft asked, aiming the question at both Jackie and Lestrade.
“She was… found at a crime scene we were working on. NSPCC wasn’t available to take her, so we offered to look after her.”
“Yes, let’s do that,” Mycroft said, standing and pulling Greg into a standing position. “Shirt and trousers off,” Mycroft told Greg, taking the corset and collar from him. “Fold them and put them on the sofa, please.” Greg hastened to do as he was told, returning to stand in front of Mycroft. “Now, hold this.” Mycroft gave one end of the corset to Greg, circling around his back and moving back to Greg’s front. Taking the side that Gregory was holding, Mycroft did the gold clasps down the front, taking his time on each one. When he was done, he rested his hands on Greg’s chest and looked into his eyes, smiling. “Gorgeous,” he said, leaning his forehead against Greg’s. He dug his fingernails lightly into Greg’s exposed chest, leaning down to kiss him. He took control of Greg’s mouth, pressing relentlessly against him. Gliding his nails up to Greg’s shoulder, he pushed forcefully down, prompting Greg to kneel.
“Yes, spanking,” John said. “You had your warning and chose not to heed it. Now you get a spanking. You know how it works, Sherlock.”
“That means her sister is also off the table.” Mycroft pointed to an equally dark-haired woman approximately four years older.
John backed into the fire, holding his hands out calmly to Liz. She looked furtively at him but, seeing no averse reactions to the fire, she took his hands. He gathered her close, making sure he had a firm grip on her before strongly saying “Diagon Alley!” With a whoosh they were off, the world spinning around them as grates flashed before them.  Liz kept her eyes screwed shut, hands gripping John’s tightly.
“Emotions are tough, hm?” John asked sympathetically, running his hand up and down Sherlock’s back. Sherlock hummed in agreement, letting himself rest in the quiet space for a moment.
“Yes, of course.” Sherlock stood and as he passed John, he squeezed his hand. John took Sherlock’s place on the sofa, slinging his arm around the back. There was a bright pink cartoon pig on the screen.
“Well, are you going to be staying at your house, John? And what about Sherlock? He can’t very well stay in 221B at the moment.”
“You try,” Greg said, offering the syringe to Mycroft. Mycroft took it, switching places with Greg. He put a hand soothingly on Jackie’s stomach and gently inserted the syringe, allowing it to fill with mucous and then emptying it onto the handkerchief. “Good,” Greg praised. “And it looks like she’s starting to calm down.” It was true; Jackie was gazing at them both unblinkingly but had stopped crying.
Greg hesitated for a moment. As much as sleep seemed like a good idea, he didn’t think he’d be able to sleep for the next year, as keyed up as he was. He also had a sudden urge to protect Mycroft and Jackie at whatever cost.
“Well, she’s gorgeous,” the woman continued, bending down so she was level with Jackie and cooing and waving at her. “What’s her name?”
“Well that’s idiotic. John would never neglect me if I was truly in need.” John, realizing this was as close to an apology as he was going to get in public, took his hand once more.
“Of course,” Mycroft answered. “Well, since I’ve met him I’ll allow you to go out with him, but you must be home by 12:30 at the latest.”
“Well, it sounds like he deserved it,” Mycroft chuckled as he started peeling carrots. Looking up, he smiled at Greg. “Hello, Gregory. I put the ham in an hour ago like you told me to.”
She paused a moment before shrugging. John, figuring he wasn’t going to get much more from her, tucked the afghan tighter around her.
“Thank you,” she whispered, holding it out so that Sherlock could secure it around her neck. He did, careful not to get it tangled in her hair. When it laid on her chest, she rested her hand over it.
Greg grinned at Mycroft. “Yes, sir,” he said, only half teasing. A shudder went through Mycroft at the words and he let out a soft huff of breath.
Greg moved to the sitting room when he was done to find a drowsy Jackie propped on Mycroft’s chest, head supported in his large hand.
Sherlock hummed in agreement. This gathering was supposed to be some sort of party designed to find your eternal mate. Sherlock thought it was ridiculous that two hundred people between the ages o f eighteen and twenty-five were meant to find their soulmate among a selected sampling. The scientists had assured them that not everyone would find their soulmate in one night, and that there would be a line-up of similar socials held at later dates. Sherlock was determined to do all he could do to drive away any potential suitors. He didn’t need people or relationships to make him happy or complete; he was fine on his own, had always been fine on his own.
“For you,” she said, handing them each a badge that read ‘Visitor, clearance 1’. “This way,” she continued, turning and stalking off towards the lifts. John and Sherlock followed, Sherlock glancing around and trying not to gape at the large polished hall in which they had landed. A large empty area halfway down the hall was the only blemish in an otherwise gilded, grand hall.
“A perfect angel. Slept through the night last night.” As if she could sense her father’s presence in the flat, a piercing wail broke through the room. “And there she is,” Mrs. Hudson said, turning towards the other room.
"The info is in the pocket in my shirt," Mycroft told Anthea, nodding at the shirt in question, still laying on the floor. Anthea quickly retrieved the sheets of paper, tucking them into her own shirt. The thermometer beeped and Marcia pulled it out, glancing down at it. "Fevers gone down considerably. Probably all that crying spiked it as well. I'd say you're both clear to go, and Anthea, I'll be sending you instructions to pass on to Mr. Holmes on the care and keeping of a baby."
“It’s time for us to go, regardless,” Mycroft informed the group. They walked as a group to the front of the building where the Holmes’ car was waiting.
Mycroft sat himself easily on the table. “Yes, I… rescued her. I’m not sure of all the details myself, but it did not seem like a good situation she was in. She seems to realize on some level that I saved her, as it were.”
“Yes, of course, I’ll meet you in the kitchen.” Rubbing his hand over his face, Mycroft looked over to Jaclynn, whose face was scrunching up as she started waking up. Small little whimpers started escaping through her nose as she started squirming and fussing on the bed. Mycroft quickly sat up, scooping Jaclynn and the muslin into his arms and rubbing soothing circles on her back, shushing quietly in her ear. It did little to soothe her, and her cries ramped up in volume and intensity very quickly.
“Murder, obviously,” Sherlock murmured to John. “Male, mid to late forties, worked as a pet groomer. Dating three separate women, one serious and two on the side. Recently divorced. Had a hamster, probably his girlfriend's. No children.” They had drawn the attention of one of the police officers, who made his way over to them.
This time it wasn’t a baby crying that woke Mycroft but the soft murmur of a male voice coming from the baby monitor. Clearing the sleep from his eyes, Mycroft cursed the fact that he had slept yet another night on a sofa. He moved stiffly to Jackie’s room, pausing in the doorway to take in the sight before him. Gregory was at Jackie’s crib and had her in his arms, slowly rocking her back and forth as he murmured gently to her.
“Look over here,” John said, leading her to the other side of the street, where a window held only one item, a shiny broom. Liz looked up at John, a question in her eyes.
“Of course,” Greg said, forcing his eyes from the thin strip of skin he could see peeking from Mycroft’s shirt. As Mycroft shifted away from the bed Greg squeezed past, narrowly avoiding dragging his front against Mycroft’s. Looking away, Greg focused on Jackie, picking up the dress that was laid out beside her and slipping it on.
“How old? Twelve months?” Sherlock asked, looking down at her and grabbing the hand that was reaching for his curls. “Do not grab that,” he cooed at her.
They walked into a small, cozy waiting room with several cushy chairs gathered around a low table. There was a front desk with an elderly receptionist sitting behind it. She looked up when they entered, smiling gently.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes in response and stalked over to a door across the room, revealing a closet.
“Shit,” he swore roughly, slamming the broken tap on the counter and growling in frustration. He slammed the tap handle back on, making sure it worked. He rubbed one hand roughly over his eyes and considered succumbing to the pressure building up behind them when a loud commotion came from the front door. “Seriously?” he mumbled quietly under his breath, pulling the gun that Mycroft had given him out of his hip holster and moving quietly to the kitchen door, carefully leaning around the corner. A giant dark mass was outlined by the front door and Greg could hear grunting. Slowly moving towards the front door he raised the gun, clearing his throat.
He turned back. “I haven’t had much time to think about anything,” John admitted. “But it’s something we’ll consider. She’s too young for school, but daycare may be an option to get her to socialize. Would putting her in a Muggle daycare be safe?”
“And neither one of you ever feels like your partner isn’t giving you enough? Greg, do you ever go into subdrop? Or Mycroft, do you ever get overly antsy?”
“Why don’t you start on your toy box?” John asked, walking over to the nappy supplies and starting to put them back in place. As he did, he opened the top drawer on the changing table and pulled out a spare pacifier, walking over to Sherlock.
“We do. We’ll call you if there is any trouble at all.” She reached for Liz’s hand. “Now, how about we go find some toys to play with, hm?”
“Yes, good idea.” He handed Jackie to Greg, who situated her in the car seat. Then, he took the proffered dog from Mycroft and tucked it in beside Jackie. “There we go, all snug,” he said. “Time to get groceries.” He and Mycroft got into the front and Mycroft drove the couple blocks to the grocery store. When they got out, Greg put the carrier on and Mycroft helped slide Jackie into it.
Greg felt any remaining fight go out of him at Mycroft’s words. “Thanks.” True exhaustion laced Greg’s voice.
“No, don’t apologize!” Greg hastened to say. “It’s just something we should iron out before we go out in public.” Mycroft nodded as he gave Jackie the last of one piece of toast.  “So how about we stick close to the truth? We say that you adopted her because you wanted a family, and then we met, and this is our first vacation together.”
Thank you so much for reading! I feel I should mention I do not have a child, so there's a lot of googling happening for the milestones and stuff, so if it's wrong, apologies. Enjoy!
“Good,” Sherlock sighed. Although he wasn’t quite in subspace yet, he could feel his brain slowing and detaching. “Not quite there yet.”
“I don’t want anything from a manic depressive pedophile. Not to mention you’re heterosexual, why would you want anything from me?” The man’s eyes flickered quickly to the side. “Ah. I see. A dare, is it?” Sherlock sneered.
Sherlock pocketed his phone and picked up the violin that was resting in its open case. Placing it under his chin he slowly dragged the bow across the strings, allowing the low notes to guide his thoughts.
“Oh, hey Mycroft,” he said softly, looking down to make sure Jackie was still asleep. “How’d it go?” Sitting up slowly, Greg lifted Jackie and handed her over to Mycroft.
“Oh.” He went slightly pale as he took in the small form in front of him, his eyes flicking back towards the front of the room where the body was still floating. He knelt down beside Greg. “Hello, my name is John. Can you tell me your name?”
“Oi, you can’t go in there!” the constable cried from behind him. Everyone in the sitting room turned to look at Mycroft as he entered.
“Well that’s cool,” Greg chimed in, tucking Jackie safely against himself as the bookcase slid closed behind him. Through the bookshelf, he heard the front door splinter under the weight of a battering ram. Swearing softly, he picked up his pace as he followed Mycroft down a stairwell and to a waiting car at the back of the building.
“Of course,” Sherlock dove into the nappy bag, eager to show John that he was serious about his commitment. He pulled out the mat and spread it out on the kitchen table, taking out a nappy and wipes, as well as cream.
“That’s a pretty mouth,” he heard from beside him. His eyes darted quickly to the side, quickly taking in the tall, leggy brunette now standing beside him.
Because his back was turned, Sherlock didn’t see the woman slink out of the shadows behind him and leap over the body, shoving him into the ground before scampering out of the alley and down the street.
“Yes alright, you great git, let’s go,” John said, leading Sherlock towards the street. “Get us a cab.”
“Sherlock, what are you doing on your phone?” John asked finally, irritated that Sherlock wasn’t paying attention.
“Then you’d better spend that time with your child,” Greg said. “I’ll take care of the shopping and you can grab Jackie,” he continued.
“What now, my dear?” Jackie gave no response. Mycroft looked around and decided that he should put away the shopping that he hadn’t gotten to yesterday.
“I’ll need to stitch both sides of his thigh. He’s passed out right now but he may wake up. I’m going to need you to hold his hand if that happens. Do you think you can do that?” She spoke to him simply, clearly shifting into crisis mode.
“Oh good, you made it through,” John said, accepting the pouch of Floo powder from Sherlock and slipping it in his pocket. John moved to a larger table, sitting down and pulling Liz down onto the chair beside him.
“That would be great, Mrs. H, ta,” John answered. She bustled back downstairs and John ushered Liz further into the flat motioning her towards the sofa. “I’m just going to put the kettle on, I’ll be right back,” he told her. She nodded and looked over at Sherlock.
“This I not a one to ten scenario,” Evangeline interrupted. “It’s a straight question. How often do you have sex?”
“Yes, I think so too,” Mycroft answered, bouncing her gently. Sitting down on one of the hard plastic chairs, Mycroft sat Jackie on his lap and brought out her teddy bear from the diaper bag. Holding it in front of her, Mycroft wiggled the bear in her direction. Jackie reached out with both hands, grabbing fistfuls of fur and fluff and bringing the bear towards her, swinging it up and down. Mycroft smiled softly at her, holding her firmly on his lap. She looked up at Mycroft, smiling and giggling. “Yes, very good,” he praised her softly.
“John, it’s okay, just calm down,” Sherlock said, walking around the bed so that he was standing beside the bed. “Can I touch you?”
“Come.” Sherlock said, taking John’s hand and leading him into the kitchen. He sat him at the table and moved to the kettle. “Food?” Sherlock asked him.
“Thank you,” Mycroft said. At this point he was scraping the bottom of the jar of mashed carrots. “Good?” he asked, addressing Jackie.
“Oh trust me, I know. And it’ll only get better once we get home. But in order to get home, we need to finish up at New Scotland Yard. So the quicker we do that, the quicker we’ll get home.”
“Of course not. How long we gonna have to stay here?” Greg felt the world start to spin as he rested his head back against the chair.
“Of course it is,” John said with a cheeky grin, smacking Sherlock on the bum. “Now, hands back on the bedrail, please.” Sherlock turned and complied, closing his eyes once more and bracing for the impact.  John picked up the flogger once more, swinging his arm back and forth before bringing it down with a loud CRACK on Sherlock’s back. Sherlock jerked from the unexpected force but felt a thrill go up his spine at the contact. Another strong impact landed, and Sherlock shivered at the goosebumps that travelled up his spine. It was like the shockwaves from the strong impact were going straight through his nerves and to his brain, making it shiver on impact.
“Stop patronizing me,” Sherlock snapped, taking his hand back and restlessly scooping up his phone. John leaned back in his chair, visibly taken aback.
They arrived there quickly, and Mycroft climbed out of the car, slinging Jackie so that she was securely on his hip. “Practical things first, I think, and then the fun stuff,” he told Jackie as he slotted her into the seat in the shopping cart.
The people from the lab come to try to get Jackie back, prompting the three of them to escape to a safe house.
“Goodnight,” John chuckled, his heart full to bursting. Leaning down, he brushed a gentle kiss over Sherlock’s forehead and then over his lips.
“Hi Rose, nice to meet you. Do you guys want to join us?” John gestured to the table where Sherlock and Liz were still seated. Liz was holding Sherlock’s hand and had abandoned her pumpkin juice.
“Knifeplay. This one’s a hard limit for me, love, same as gunplay,” John said to Sherlock, who had ended up with his head back in John’s lap. “No particular reason, I just don’t like the idea.”
“What, erasing memories? We train very hard in order to be able to perform that spell with the precision and accuracy it requires,” Hermione answered primly.
Mycroft looked confused and stunned at Greg’s sudden outburst. “I don’t see why this is a problem. It’s no hardship on my part to provide the funds for the flat.”
Sherlock huffed and slammed the folder down onto the sofa, flinging himself up and stomping to the corner. When he got there he crossed his arms.
John came back in and placed a plate of plain toast in front of Liz and a plate with jam on toast in front of Sherlock. He put his own plate on the table leaned forward, picking a wedge of toast and popping it in his mouth.
The woman sat in stony silence, arms bound to the back of the wooden chair she was seated in. They were in one of Mycroft’s many abandoned warehouses, Mycroft facing the woman as two of his men stood watch at the door.
“Never mind then.” With a small smile, she left Sherlock alone. Well, that was shockingly easy. Sherlock knocked back the rest of his drink and made his way to the bar for another.
John put the mugs down on the coffee table and placed the plate of biscuits straight in Sherlock’s lap. “Eat up,” he said, resting his arm along the back of the sofa. Sherlock took a biscuit and popped it into his mouth, leaning into John. Humming happily, he leaned forward and took a sip of tea, putting the plate of biscuits on the table.
“Why do you do that guessing thing whenever you meet people?” he said, finally looking at Sherlock straight on.
She grabbed onto the bar in front of her, slamming her fists onto it a couple times and giving Mycroft a small smile. It was the first time she had smiled at him, and Mycroft smiled back, looking around at the signs and heading towards the children’s section. He quickly headed to the big items, picking out the best crib, pram and car seat, as well as a black leather changing bag and plain front-carrying papoose. He also picked out various three-packs of muslin, one with jungle animals, one with elephants and one with raindrops on them. He also picked out a Burberry check sleep bag, a change mat, a baby bath, several baby towels and a bath wrap that looked like a bear. An assortment of baby body washes, shampoos and conditioners followed, and he determined that he would experiment and determine the best brand. Other essentials including several jumbo boxes of diapers, numerous tins of formula and a bottle of baby paracetamol later, and Mycroft figured they had finished the practical side of their shopping. He quickly arranged with a sales associate to have all the large items shipped to his flat that day.
“Move in. Here. With me. It’s where you belong, John,” Sherlock dipped his head so he was making eye contact with John.
Sorry that it's been so long, this fic is not abandoned, I promise! Between this and another multi-chapter fic, as well as graduating from University, road tripping, looking for a flat across the country and getting ready to move to said flat, my life has been a little hectic. Please accept this extra-long chapter as my way of saying "I'm still here!"
“I’ll be back in a tic with that tea,” Greg said, smiling at Mycroft to reassure him. Most of his anger had been released in the chewing out he had delivered. They would eventually have to talk more, but Greg was confident it could wait until Mycroft was feeling better.
“I have incapacitated the scientist and acquired the information. I will need some assistance getting her out,” Mycroft said into his earpiece.
“Goodnight, my love,” John whispered, closing the book and replacing it on the shelf. “Sleep well.” He turned on the small moon nightlight plugged into the wall, turning off the overhead light. Before he left, he took one last look at his sweet boy, marveling at the fact that he was lucky enough to see this side of Sherlock.
“Alright, if you insist.” He put her on her feet, watching her run back towards the kitchen where Mycroft and the kids were. Greg followed her, smiling at the sight of Mycroft peeling potatoes at the counter, Charlie and Alice sat on the benches watching him and keeping up a constant chatter.
Sherlock, who had been watching quietly from the other side of the sofa, reached forward and rubbed a hand soothingly down her back.
“Okay, that’s enough. The ham is just about done,” Greg interrupted, leaning down to peek in the oven. “Everyone grab a dish and bring it into the dining room. I’ll be in quickly with the ham.”
“And God, am I grateful every day for it,” John said reverently, leaning down so he could kiss Sherlock gently on the lips. Sherlock melted into the kiss, humming happily. John pulled away after a moment.
“Yes, I had thought of that. ”Mycroft was walking towards a store called ‘Lots and Lots For Babies and Tots’.
“Yes, one would say it is impossible.” Mycroft was proud to note that his voice only wavered slightly. “Although, I suppose the genetic modification helps with that.”
“It’s the D.I.!” he exclaimed, trying to push John away with one hand while answering the phone with the other. John, for his part, was bodily trying to drag Sherlock back towards him while his sub resisted.
“Spend time being a human before you have to go interrogate our attacker?” Greg said drily. “I’d say that’s exactly what you need. I’m not dumb- I know that what you’ll be doing when you leave this place will not be pretty, or nice, or even maybe humane. That comes with the territory, I’m sure. But you need to take what time you do have to be with your family.” Greg left no room for arguing.
“Yes, a full night’s sleep seems to have done wonders.” They let silence reign once more, only broken by Jackie’s giggles on Mycroft’s lap. All three men sat and watched Jackie play innocently, unaware of the tension in the room.
"I'll just take her temperature one more time before you leave" Marcia said, brandishing the thermometer towards Mycroft and Jaclynn. Mycroft lifted the sleeping baby's arm up, allowing Marcia to slot in the thermometer.
“Alright Gregory,” Mycroft said, pressing on the back of Greg’s neck. “I’m happy to say that most of our kinks follow the same lines. That will make things easier.”
“Sorry, sorry,” Greg said. Both he and Sherlock were looking at the ceiling for some clue as to what had made the body fall.
“Sorry about that, love,” John said, wincing as he looked up at Sherlock. He went and sat in his chair.
Inside, Hermione and Mycroft were sat at a table, pieces of parchment scattered around them. Mycroft was on his cellphone while Hermione was muttering and waving her wand over a large piece of parchment.
“Yes, well as I pointed out to my brother, you have not discerned what was stolen and in fact what has been stolen is sensitive to the government, so I will thank you to remove yourselves and your team from the scene.”
“Wait, this is the Mycroft I’ve heard so little about?” the D.I. appraised him once more, this time for a different reason. Obviously seeing something he liked, he nodded. “Yeah, I see it. Alright, Mr. British Government, we’ll give this one to you. But don’t expect me to hand over all my cases.” Pointing at Mycroft for a second, he walked away to round up his constables.
John just nodded, sobs still wracking his body. Sherlock carefully reached down, sliding the sheets gently from John’s legs. He moved so that he was at the head of the bed, right beside John. “Come here, John,” Sherlock said, opening his arms. There was a moment of uncertainty before John collapsed forward and into Sherlock’s arms. A few tears escaped from Sherlock’s eyes and slid silently down his cheeks. Silently, Sherlock held John and rocked him as John’s hands slowly slid from his face to grip onto Sherlock’s shoulders. He balled Sherlock’s shirt in his fists as his sobs slowly petered out into uneven breathing.
John got Sherlock to hold her as he looked her over, sitting on the edge of the bed and laying her down or sitting her up as directed. Greg and Mycroft watched from the middle of the bed, both working their way through their plates.
“No need to be shy, it’s just Mycroft,” Sherlock teased gently. Liz didn’t answer, face still pressed to Sherlock’s sleeve.
“Just stay still,” Greg told Mycroft, gently running his hand down Mycroft’s hair. “It’s almost done.”
“My boys,” their mother Violet crowed, cupping the sides of both their faces. “Come in, come in.” She let the hand cupping Sherlock’s cheek wander to his hair, idly grasping a curl here or there and trying to place them in some semblance of an order.
“Well, I’m going to get going. It was nice to meet you, and to see her again. Remember, sleep and fluids. No getting out of that bed until Dr. Watson comes tomorrow morning. And probably not even after that. I’ve left some pain relievers on the bedside table for him.”
“But you bring other things to the relationship,” Mycroft insisted earnestly. “Please, let me provide this?”
“I wouldn’t have had to if you stopped putting yourself in harm’s way,” Mycroft retorted back. Sherlock hummed low in his throat and rested his head back against the pillows.
“Alright everyone, dig in,” he said with a smile around the table, passing plates around. Everyone loaded up their plates, save Sherlock who only took a small helping of mashed potatoes and ham. Mycroft cut up bite-sized pieces of ham and carrots, putting them on the tray of Jackie’s booster seat. She picked up the pieces between two fingers, putting them in her mouth and humming happily.
“I’ve, uhh, I’ve been sleeping in the guest bed. Since Mary, um, since Mary…” John petered out, nodding awkwardly.
“Yes well, we’re not really here for the décor,” Mycroft said, glancing around distractedly. “I believe I’m going to wander over that way for a while,” Mycroft indicated a shadow-shrouded corner that a dark form had just disappeared into.
“Right over this way,” she said, bustling down the next aisle. “Now for these, I would suggest this one because it can be converted into a front carrier or a back carrier.”
“My pleasure,” he responded sincerely, looking back once more at the sleeping detective before heading back to the sitting room to gather his coat. As he was pulling it on, he heard a key in the door. A moment later, Mycroft and Greg sauntered through the door, hand in hand.
It was a few days later that Mycroft and Jackie were lounging on the sofa after a productive morning of eating, playing and eating some more. Jackie was cradled carefully in Mycroft’s lap, playing happily with a ring of plastic keys, teddy sat faithfully at her side. Mycroft occasionally bounced his knees, jangling the keys with the hand not holding Jackie in place.
Liz stood and walked up the stairs, Sherlock following close behind. The Afghan lay forgotten on the kitchen chair. Once they were done, John pulled out his wand and got the dishes washing. While they took care of themselves, John went into their bedroom to get changed for the day.
“Nothing out of the ordinary, thankfully,” Mycroft said, putting the new nappy on. Just as he was finishing, his mobile rang. Fishing it out of his pocket, Mycroft glanced at the screen. “Duty calls,” he said by way of explanation. “The linens are in the closet at the end of the hall, and I will be in the study. It is the first door on the right. I do have to ask that you avoid entering the room unless it is a matter of emergency. I will hopefully be out in time for supper.” He didn’t bother giving instructions on how to care for Jackie; in the interactions he had seen, Gregory was more than capable of handling her.
Jackie tottered up to Alice’s bench. “Up!” she said imperiously. Alice leaned over without hesitation and picked her up mid-sentence, putting Jackie on her lap.
Sherlock easily flagged them a cab and gave John’s address when they got in. They rode in silence, Sherlock’s hand still wrapped around John’s.  When they pulled up to the house, John paid and slid out of the cab, Sherlock following close enough behind that their hands didn’t unlink. They were both still wrapped in the blankets they had been given. John unlocked the door and they both stepped in, standing in the doorway. John pulled his hand out of Sherlock’s, pulling his blanket tighter around himself self-consciously.
“Five minutes ago. No. Just disappeared. I don’t know Mycroft, you know magic for God’s sake, you tell me!”
“Right,” Mycroft said, picking Jackie out of the car seat. He went inside the house, Greg following behind. Mycroft moved into the living area with Jackie, sitting on the floor with Jackie and pulling out some of her blocks. Greg moved quietly into the kitchen, putting away the groceries. When he was done, he moved back out to the living area, perching on the arm of the sofa and watching Mycroft stack the blocks as Jackie pushed over the stacks. Mycroft’s expression was unguarded like it rarely was- he was looking softly at Jackie, a grin fighting to turn into an outright smile as Jackie cackled delightedly.
“M’kay,” Liz held her arms out and Sherlock took her in his one arm, holding the other out to John to scoop off the robes. John took the bundle up to the witch behind the counter. While he paid, Sherlock exited the store, Liz in his arms.
“Unfortunately, I have work that needs attending,” Mycroft said when he had placed all the bags in the kitchen.
"Anthea, is there another room attached to this one on the ground plans of the building?" he checked. He couldn’t recall there being one, but wasn’t above double-checking.
“Yes, quickly to pick up groceries. And to show our faces; I’ve used the house as a safe house before, it’s good let the locals know we’ll be staying here for the forseeable future.”
“Well, good thing we found each other anyway, then.” Sherlock rubbed his face into John’s shin before accepting the next piece of sandwich offered. When they had both finished their sandwiches and the mug of tea, John put the plate and mug to the side and picked up the discarded folder.
“I think it might not be a good idea for Liz to continue attending daycare,” Hermione said without preamble.
“Wouldn’t you like to know?” Sherlock answered at the same time as Alice, who shouted “Chocolate cake!”
“Hi, love,” Greg went and wrapped his arms around Mycroft from behind. “Thanks for peeling and getting everything ready. I’ll take over from here.”
Mycroft let the next one fall harder than the first two. “Three, thank you,” Greg said. By seven, he was speaking through clenched teeth and by eleven his fingernails were digging into Mycroft’s ankle.
John put down the paddle and grabbed Sherlock around the waist, catching him as his knees gave out. “Sherlock?” he asked alarmed.
“Well…” John was stumped for a moment. “I’m training to be a doctor.” He could also comment on how he kept Sherlock grounded and focused, but didn’t think the D.I. needed to know that.
“From the second wave of subjects, so approximately eighteen years old, graduated high school and looking at the police force as a career,” Mycroft continued.
“Flowers, hm?” John asked. “They’re cute.” John spotted them on a rack and pulled out a size he thought would fit Liz. He handed the robes to Sherlock to be added to his pile. Sherlock looked insulted at being turned into a shopping cart, but didn’t verbally complain.
“I’m going to get you to hold her on your lap,” John said, pulling another chair out for Mycroft beside the table. Mycroft took Jackie from Sherlock and sat her on his lap facing out. She gurgled happily, clapping her hands and grinning gummily at John. “We’ll keep her in her grow. We’ll be doing three jabs today, one in each arm and one in her leg.” John had slipped into his doctor voice. “I’m going to need you to hold her hands down. Wrap one arm around her and use the other to distract her?”
“What about some Jammie Dodgers?” Greg asked Mycroft, holding up a packet. “We could always use Jammie Dodgers.”
Mycroft hummed. “That is a grey area,” Mycroft said thoughtfully. “For now, I think I will save pain for pleasure until I have discerned what your threshold is. Which means that punishment will be meted out in other forms.” Mycroft examined the list once more. “You have marked boot/foot worship, being locked in cages, enemas, eye contact restrictions, forced servitude, lectures for misbehavior, orgasm denial, sensory deprivation, standing in a corner and water torture as non-violent punishments. I’ve noticed a trend of isolation, mild humiliation and extreme control as forms of punishment. Does that sound right?”
Sherlock did as told, looking confused and intrigued. With a wink, John took a step forward and all three of them blinked out of existence.
“There are people who have broken through my security. I believe they may be the same people that I rescued Jackie from. I’ve contacted my security team, there will be a car for us in short order. I’m sorry Gregory but if you want to live you’ll have to come with us.” Throughout this, Mycroft had been dashing around the sitting room, scooping up toys and freshly laundered clothes and throwing them into the diaper bag he had grabbed from the end of the sofa.
“Hey!” he shouted, rushing the technician and swinging at his head. “You do NOT hit him!” John shouted as the technician fell to the ground, dazed by John’s punch t the side of his head.
“Come back here, you wanker,” John goaded, hooking his hand around the back of Sherlock’s neck and pulling him in for another kiss. Sherlock let himself get pulled in for a moment while he dug in his pocket for his ringing phone. He let out a triumphant grunt before pulling back once again from John and looking down at the screen.
“You hold her, and I’ll feed her,” John said, intercepting the applesauce. Sherlock propped her up so that she was sitting in his lap, leaning against his front. John opened the applesauce and dug the spoon in, bringing it to Rosie’s lips. She opened and wrapped her lips around the spoon, leaving it clean in her wake. They sat like that until the whole container of applesauce was done and Rosie was sitting clapping her hands together, applesauce all over her face. John grabbed a wipe from the bag and wiped off her face.
“It’s Sherlock. I called him in on a case and the perp was on the scene and tried to make an escape, and in that attempt he sliced Sherlock pretty bad with a knife. He’s in surgery now, but I thought you’d want to know.”
“Yes, but they’ve got roots deep into the government and law enforcement. Hell, it’s how we got our jobs. And I’m always keeping an ear out for rumblings of unpleasant things coming from their side of things. If I ever hear anything too troubling, I will be the first to organize an uprising.”
Greg squinted. “Ah, so one of those you-could-tell-me-but-you’d-have-to-kill-me positions, hey?” His grin stretched teasingly.
A week passed by quickly, Mycroft and Greg simultaneously dancing around each other and working together seamlessly to take care of Jackie. Mycroft was shut into his office more often than not, leaving Greg with Jackie for stretches of time, something Greg wasn’t complaining about. He quickly found himself falling in love with Jackie.
“Yes, well I don’t believe submissives are less that dominants. In fact, the amount that I want to please a submissive puts me at their mercy, more often than not.”
Watching Sherlock for a moment, John observed the tense lines in Sherlock’s shoulders and neck. He knew this case was stressing his boy out and he was determined to fix that. Heading back into the kitchen, John put their sandwiches in the fridge, knowing they’d keep for however long it took him to get Sherlock back in order. John made himself a tea, carefully watching the clock.
“Please, make as much noise as you want,” Mycroft murmured, leaning forward and biting playfully at Greg’s earlobe. While he was distracted, Mycroft pinched the other nipple with the other clamp, letting Greg get used to the sting. Running his finger gently over the chain, Mycroft gave a soft tug before capturing Greg’s mouth in a consuming kiss. “Now, I want you to crawl into the kitchen and make me dinner. Something simple, please. Bring it to me in the sitting room; you can stand once you get into the kitchen.” Mycroft watched his sub crawl out the door, smiling softly at the backside that greeted him. Going back over to the drawers that held their implements, Mycroft took out a small bag of rice and turned it over in his hands, feeling the hard give between his hands. Following his subs path, he made his way into the sitting room and opened the small Ziploc bag of rice, pouring it in a roughly two foot by two foot patch, trying to spread it as evenly as he could. Sitting down on the sofa, he reached for his lukewarm tea and took a sip, grimacing slightly but drinking it as he waited. He listened to the soft tinkling of knives and plates, comforted by the constant noise. A few minutes later his sub walked in, carrying a plate with a sandwich and some carrot sticks on it in one hand and a glass of water in the other. Greg paused and looked apprehensively at the patch of rice on the ground. Then, seeming to steel himself, Greg placed the plate and glass on the coffee table and kneeled resolutely on the patch of rice, resting his hands on his thighs and bowing his head. The rice dug into his knees immediately, sending small shooting stings up his kneecap and upper calf.
“Yes, John,” Mycroft said. They had done this enough times over the years that this part was routine.
“I am ready now,” Mycroft said, ensuring he had his guns in place before climbing out of the van. His men followed him out of the van and gathered around him.
They said their farewells and John booked their next appointment with the secretary while Sherlock impatiently tapped his foot. John glared pointedly at the foot for a moment while talking politely with the secretary, squeezing Sherlock’s hand that was still laced with his.
“Are you sure?” Sherlock nodded, grabbing John’s hand and threading it once more through his hair. “Alright, but we will talk about this eventually. Even though we both hate talking about feelings.” Sherlock hummed and closed his eyes, some of the tension immediately falling from his shoulders as he surrendered. “You are so good, you know that right?” When no answer was forthcoming, John tugged gently at Sherlock’s curls. “Answer me.”
Greg ached to put his hand on Mycroft but resisted, going straight to his room. He got ready and climbed into bed, reaching across to the empty expanse of bed beside him. He tossed and turned for a while, ears constantly tuned to the sitting room, before falling into a fitful sleep.
“Interesting,” John said. A whole new dimension to the brother’s relationship had just revealed itself.
“Four,” Sherlock said distractedly, fingers tapping for a few more seconds on his phone before his eyes widened and flicked to John. “four…seeing the future. It is dull,” Sherlock said in a monotone.
“I do,” Sherlock said. He put his hand on John’s shoulder, turning him so they were facing each other. “Go to bed, John. I know where the spare pillows and blankets are. I’ll be fine.”
“He is doing well, he’s just got out of surgery. He’ll be asleep for a while yet but he’s in his room now so you may go see him if you wish.”
Mycroft debated following him for a moment before deciding against it. It was better this way, anyway. He had gotten to say goodbye to Jackie, and it wasn’t as if he was planning on not making it back. He would see them again I a few hours, a few days at most.
John knew that although he and Sherlock hadn’t had a proper conversation about it, he was telling the truth.
“Thank you.” He slipped past Greg, pajamas clutched tightly in his hands. He closed the bathroom door quietly behind him. Greg watched him go, feeling like a buoy on the wind-wracked water. He understood that Mycroft had been through a lot, but he felt the need to hug him and never let go, just as much as he knew that Mycroft would hate him for doing that. It was a disconcerting position to be in.
“Can you wave to Marcia?” Greg asked Jackie, demonstrating. Jackie tentatively waved her hand up and down, head burrowing shyly into Greg’s shoulder.
“Perfect.” Mycroft wrote down a few more notes. “You’ve also noted a few times here that you like to feel pretty.” Mycroft smiled indulgently at Greg and raised an eyebrow. “I would very much like to help you there. That does mean that during some scenes I would choose what you wear, such as corsets or sexy clothes, which would be considered having clothes chosen for you. You have marked that as a soft limit here.”
“It’s okay,” John soothed, reaching down to take the phone from Sherlock’s hand. He replaced the phone with his own hand, towing Sherlock out to the sitting room.
“Let’s take a look then.” John placed his medical bag on the bed and opened it up. “Sherlock, will you go help Greg with breakfast?”
“Right over this way!” she said, heading down an aisle confidently. She stopped in front of a small, tilting bookshelf that was crammed full of colourful books of all sizes.
A string of expletives exploded out of John as he yanked Sherlock up by the arm. “Get behind me and let’s go!” he shouted, sprinting out of the alley.
“I feel like this… experiment has made me more susceptible to emotion. Others aren’t nearly as affected as I am by things.”
A few days later found Sherlock and Liz in the kitchen, performing a small experiment at the table. Liz had expressed interest earlier in the form of standing beside Sherlock, looking aptly up at him. Sherlock had conceded, picking her up and placing her on his lap. At first he had only let her peer through his microscope, hands hovering nervously around her and the microscope. She had been extra careful, peering into the microscope and quietly asking a few questions.
Gratefully, Mycroft followed the other man out of the building and down the block, entering a deep alley that had an unmarked ambulance parked at the end. "Thank you, report back to Anthea."
“I can, and that is the plan if Mycroft moves out. Worse comes to worse, he’s said I can move in with him and Lestrade but I’d really rather not.”
Shifting her to one arm, Greg dug in his pockets for something to entertain her with. He found his set of car keys.
Just wanted to let those who are subscribed to this story know that I've made it a series and posted a second story in this universe. Enjoy! :D
“Yeah,” John answered, handing Rosie over to Sherlock. Mrs. Hudson returned with the bottle and handed it to Sherlock. Feeling a little out of his depth, Sherlock brandished the bottle and aimed it at Rosie. He put the nipple to her lips and was thankful when she latched on eagerly.
“Hi, Mrs. Hudson,” John greeted, wrapping his arm around Liz’s shoulder. “Sorry we haven’t come down to visit, we’ve been a bit busy.”
“Sherlock, I respected you at the crime scene, please respect me in this.” Sherlock narrowed his eyes at John.
“There, that’s better,” Mycroft tried to soothe, but Jackie wasn’t buying it. She kept crying, kicking her tiny legs into the air and waving her fists. Mycroft picked her up, propping her on one hip as he went and gathered a bottle and the formula. Juggling the baby in one arm while making the bottle with the other hand, Mycroft quickly put the formula and water in the bottle, warming it up and presenting it to an unimpressed Jackie. She fussed a little, huffing a few angry breaths out of her mouth before accepting the nipple.
John took a step and the world twisted and reshaped around them, solidifying into 221B. John walked over to the couch, sitting with Liz in his lap.
Sherlock opened his eyes and cut them towards John, quickly taking in the situation. He knelt down on the floor facing them, hands hovering uncertainly in the air. John rubbed his hand soothingly up and down Liz’s arm, hoping to gently coax her awake. She continued to sob, hands and legs kicking out.
Slipping into the sitting room, Mycroft picked up a stuffed animal and the set of blocks with the periodical elements on them. He brought them back into the kitchen, dropping them on the floor beside Jackie and making sure she was confortable before he turned to the multitude of bags.
John pulled out his wand and held it out, pointing it at the bruise. “Brackium Emendo,” he said, watching Liz’s face. She frowned at the white glow emanating from his wand, and there was a moment of tightness on her face before she relaxed. “Better?” John asked as the light faded. Liz nodded. “Good. Now, how do we feel about a lunch?”
Mycroft, although of a similar mind, had been approached by the scientists and offered a position in the British Government if he managed to find a mate. He was extremely interested in the position offered and therefore was determined to find someone tolerable tonight.
Jackie tore into the paper covering her present without abandon. After getting a fistful of paper, she stuck part of it in her mouth,
“Very good,” Mycroft praised, laying her on the table and laying the soiled muslin beside her. Removing her diaper, Mycroft looked and noticed a rash starting to form on her bum, and added cream to the mental list of things that needed to be picked up. He put the new one on her, quickly slipping her into the onesie and snapping it up. “There, that’s better,” he crooned softly at her.
“When we were little, Mycroft flew into a tree,” Sherlock said absently, eyes still glued to the computer screen. “He was being chased by a dog and got so scared that instead of climbing, he flew into a tree. Mummy had a fit.”
When they pulled up to Bart’s, Mycroft exited the car, grabbing the diaper bag on his way. He hurried into the hospital; when he reached the front desk, he greeted the woman behind the desk with a “Holmes, Sherlock. What room?”
“We’ll see you later, Mycroft,” John said, and Mycroft gave a wave of his hand before letting himself out.
True to his word, Gregory showed up fifteen minutes later. Mycroft had changed Jackie’s nappy and put her onesie back on, but had kept the other nappy.
“Gregory, hello, you’re busy, I’m sorry for disturbing you.” Mycroft went to disconnect the phone but was stopped by Gregory’s voice.
“Cheater,” Greg chuckled good-naturedly, smacking Mycroft on the bottom as he flew past him to hide his own eggs. He decided to let Mycroft win and he would take the midnight shift.
“Neither are you,” Mycroft insisted. “Admittedly, you were engineered as a submissive, but submissive doesn’t mean blindly obedient. It means willingly giving yourself to someone and making them happy because it makes you happy. You don’t do anything that doesn’t make you happy, alright?” Mycroft ducked his head to meet his younger brother’s eyes.
Legwork. Mycroft curled his lip in distaste as he watched the video feed playing on his phone, tucked in a hidden nook in the wall. He abhorred legwork and had hoped to be done with it ages ago, but this mission was of a delicate nature and required his precision in execution. There was no sound in the hall he occupied, the sound of his breathing prominent in the dead silence. It was two twenty in the morning and the air was still with it, no life force disturbing the peace around him. The weight of his gun was a comforting presence in the hand not holding his phone, and the comm nestled in his ear provided another level of security, no matter how fragile that security may be.
“It also means you have to listen to me when I tell you I’m tired and I don’t want to do something. There’s take and give in any relationship.” Mycroft was still regarding him coolly, but there was also a considering, calculating look in his eyes. “What, are you going to punish me for being tired?”
Mycroft chuckled at the butchering of his name. He found it adorable how deeply Greg could fall into subspace with just a bit of touching. “You really needed it, hmmm? You went down very easily today.”
The three of them sat in comfortable silence for a moment, Liz holding on to each of their hands. John turned on the telly, flicking through channels until he found a suitably crap show. Sherlock huffed and rolled his eyes but settled in, slinging his arm over the back of the sofa and playing with the hair at the nape of John’s neck. John looked over and smiled gently, leaning over Liz to peck Sherlock on the lips before settling back in, leaning into his touch.
“As I suspected,” she chuckled. “Go grab her and bring her in. I can watch her for a couple hours if you want to take a nap.”
“Okay, serving as furniture. That could include me sitting on you, and me using you to put things on, like a table.”
Well, I've finished writing the last three chapters, so now it's just a matter of seeing if I can wait a week to post each or if I just dump them all. Anyway, enjoy this one!
“Sure,” John said, taking a sip from his tea and put it on the table, picking up the list and pen once more.
Mycroft rolled out of bed and moved into Jackie’s room, opening the door gently and peering in. Jackie was on her back in her cot and cooed gently when she saw Mycroft enter.
They exited the vehicle, going up to their flat. “I am going to do some work,” Mycroft said as he hung up his jacket, scooping up his laptop and carrying it to his room.
“Nope. Now, I propose a required five hours of sleep every night and at least two meals and one snack a day.”
“There you go, you’re all done, you’re forgiven, here we go,” John soothed, lifting Sherlock up and cradling him in his lap. He tucked Sherlock’s head into the crook of his neck and held him there, letting Sherlock cry it out. “Now, how about you help me clean up the mess, and then we’ll get you in a nice warm bath, alright?” Sherlock’s sobs had slowed and now he was sniffling, his breathing dangerously close to hiccups. “Take deep breaths for me, love,” John whispered, rubbing Sherlock’s back. Sherlock did as he was told, taking deep breaths and huffing them into John’s neck. “Good boy.” John held him for another moment before tapping him lightly on the rump. “Up we go.”
“Thought I‘d pop by and give Jackie her pokes. Also, as soon as this one woke up he got on every nurses nerves, and was discharged into my care so he could get on MY nerves. He’s been in a strop since then so I thought visiting Jackie might help.” John didn’t mention that he also wanted to distract Sherlock so that he wouldn’t go gallivanting about and pull his stitches. Mycroft easily read the truth of John’s words on him and stepped aside to allow them to enter. Wordlessly he pointed Sherlock to his recently vacated chair, plopping Jackie into his lap and pointing to the half-eaten container of food. Sherlock rolled his eyes and grumbled about doing Mycroft’s job, but dutifully scooped the pears onto the spoon and into Jackie’s mouth.
“Yeah, then Mycroft gave me a lecture about having you home by midnight and swooped up to his room. What were you playing there?”
“Definitely going to be drinking tonight,” Greg mumbled, turning to get his crew back into the flat.
“Yes, you keep playing,” John appeased. “I’m going to go get your pajamas. I’ll be back in a tick. You’ll be alright for a few minutes?”
“He was going to infiltrate the lab where he found Jackie,” Greg huffed as they gently lowered him onto the bed.
Sherlock grimaced. “No, thank you.” Disgust coloured his tone. The woman came around from behind her friend, cornering Sherlock in on his one side.
Tears started coursing down Liz’s cheeks as she nodded weakly. John wrapped an arm around Liz and pulled her close. Sherlock looked on for a moment before awkwardly patting her back.
Usually I have a Sherlock-John portion and Greg-Mycroft portion, but I didn't have time for both so you only get Sherlock-John. I'll write a Greg-Mycrfot accompanying one eventually though, no worries.
“Okay, that’s fine. I’ll go get your pajamas, then.” Without saying anything else, Greg turned and moved into the bedroom, quickly getting Mycroft’s pajamas from the drawer dedicated to his things. They had been together for a few months, and were at the stage where they were staying at one flat or the other most nights. He took the pajamas out to Mycroft, who hadn’t moved from his place in front of the door.
“Sorry about that,” Greg said softly when she had left, not letting go of Mycroft’s hand. “Acting the part and all that.”
Sherlock turned and walked down the road, towing Liz behind him. With a last smile and a “I’ll text you later,” John turned and followed his partner.
A soft light began to emanate from the wood in the locket, the light dancing off the silver filigree.
“Who are in no more danger than they ever are. And frankly, who I see so rarely they’re really not in any danger.” His ex-wife had gotten custody in the divorce and he got them every weekend and on holidays. “I won’t be able to take them this weekend. And I won’t be at my job.”
“Okay,” Sherlock agreed. John didn’t waste time, pulling back and hitting Sherlock on the back sharply. Sherlock sucked in a breath and let it out on a sharp exhale. “More. Please.” Sherlock ground out impatiently. John chuckled before hitting Sherlock four times in rapid succession. He made sure never to land in the same spot twice, but to evenly space out the hits. Sherlock was starting to slip into subspace, the sharp hits stinging and prompting him to simultaneously focus on the pain and let himself float in the heat on his back. His mind was going fuzzy, the onslaught blurring into one pleasantly stingy sensation. Previously he had thought that only pure pleasure would get him into true subspace, but this combination of light to moderate pain and the trust he placed in John turned the pain into a warm sort of pleasure that seeped into Sherlock’s bones. He barely noticed when John paused and then stopped hitting him with the riding crop.
“Yes, that’s why I’m allowed to place the Trace at all,” she answered distractedly, focusing on the map. Her wand flared brightly for a moment before going out, and then a small blinking light appeared above the map. “Aha! There!” she cried.
“As long as he doesn’t put weight on the leg,” Marcia answered. “So you’ll have to help him get there.”
Mycroft had gone beet red. “That’s quite alright, I don’t mind,” he said. The two men locked eyes, the tension building until it was broken by Jackie’s exclamation of “Da!”
“That will work just fine.” Greg held his had out for it. As the handkerchief and syringe passed from one hand to another, their fingers lingered. “Right. So it’s pretty easy, all you do is depress the bulb part, insert the syringe into the nostril, and then release the bulb, allowing it to fill up with mucous. Once it’s full, just squeeze the mucous onto the handkerchief.” He demonstrated as he explained, squeezing the light green mucous onto the handkerchief. “That part always grosses me out,” he admitted with a low chuckle.
“Then we’ll kill you too,” the woman shrugged. She seemed to be the leader. “The baby is our top priority. Give it here.”
“Sure,” Alice said. Greg slid the bowl, tongs and pre-made salad towards Alice. Standing Jackie on her lap, Alice reached forward and opened the plastic salad container, dumping the contents into the bowl. Picking up the spoons, Alice dug them into the salad, Jackie leaning back so that Alice supported her and trying to grab the spoons as well. Alice brought the spoons closer to Jackie, dragging the bowl to the edge of the counter. Together they mixed the salad, Jackie giggling delightedly in Alice’s lap.
“Not really,” Greg said, looking around. He noticed Jackie staring at a stuffed dog in a police outfit. He broke out into a grin. Mycroft narrowed his eyes at the mischievous glint in Greg’s eye. Following his gaze, Mycroft noticed where he was looking, huffed and rolled his eyes.
“Well we can’t very well go to Baker Street at the moment. It’s a little… blown up.” Sherlock smirked at John.
“I am eighteen, my interests are the violin, chemistry and murder mysteries. Sometimes I go for days on end without speaking. I also do not agree with this experiment we’ve all been forced into and don’t believe that good relationships can be chemically engineered.” Sherlock smiled coldly.
“I have something important I need to tell you. All of you.” John beckoned the other two men over. Greg had dismissed the rest of his people a few minutes earlier, so it was only the four of them in the flat. “I… I don’t think you need to look for whoever did this.”
“Sure,” Greg said slyly, watching as Mycroft did exactly that. He poured their coffee, buttered his slices of toast and spread jam on Mycroft’s. Dropping the mugs and plates in front of their chairs, Greg sat at the table. Mycroft joined him there, Jackie on his lap. Keeping her in the circle of his arms, Mycroft ripped a bite-sized piece of toast from one slice and handed it to Jackie, who stuck it happily in her mouth.
“It’s sort of a mini-wand,” he explained. “There’s a bit of unicorn hair to act as a core. It can’t do much else than glow, but it serves the purpose desired.”
“I have to go and get changed,” Mycroft interrupted, speaking over Greg. He stood and handed Jackie back to him. The movement woke her up and she started crying. “I only came home to check on her and change my clothes before heading out again.” Turning on his heel, Mycroft ran up the stairs. While he was upstairs, Greg rocked Jackie back and forth, his distress matching hers. He could have sworn that him and Mycroft were getting closer and, after the kiss the other day, he was sure… well, he had really screwed up now. Jackie stopped crying quickly, having only been momentarily shocked.
“No you don’t!” Sherlock practically shrieked, pointing once more at the technician. The technician turned red and stood swiftly, hanging his camera around his neck.
“You’re doing so well,” Mycroft praised him as he took a bigger bite from the sandwich. He knew Greg was starting to get near his breaking point and worked to finish up the meal. “You remember your safeword, right?” Greg nodded, swallowing thickly. He could start to feel tears building up behind his eyes, the pressure pushing on his skull. “Use it if you need to.” Mycroft watched Greg, but he gave no indication of wanting to use his safeword. Giving him the sandwich once more, Mycroft watched tears well up in Greg’s eyes.
Greg arrived twenty minutes later, knocking at the door. Mycroft let him in gratefully, looking lost and a little hopeless. Jackie’s crying had slowed fractionally, but now her nose was running at an alarming rate.
“Come on, Liz, we talked about this,” John said, kneeling down so that he was eye-level with her. “Just two hours, and then we’ll get ice cream on the way home.” Liz, skinny as she was, had a love for all things sugary. Although john knew it wasn’t the healthiest way to get meat back on her bones, he was willing to indulge her.
“You don’t even have to talk to anyone if you don’t want to,” Sherlock said. “We’ll be here right at twelve, alright? We promise.”
They walked out to a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a dustbin and a few weeds. John pulled out his wand and reached forward, tapping the wall three times with the point. The wall came to life, bricks moving and slotting themselves in place to reveal an archway on to a cobbled street. The street wound down and around and out of sight, bracketed on either side by crooked buildings proclaiming the selling of various wares that Liz had never seen. The Alley was relatively quiet, only a few shoppers wandering up and down the street. To her left, she saw a group of women surrounding a tub filled with what seemed to be various plants. To her right, she saw a shop who’s display window was filled with various cauldrons and gems displayed on velvet cushions. She gravitated towards the window, pulling John and Sherlock behind her. She stood staring in at the shiny jewels, looking to Sherlock to see if he was just as impressed.
Mycroft, who had been avoiding eye contact throughout most of the conversation, made an extra effort to not look at Greg.
John hummed, thinking of the few casual robes he had from his uni days and how he may need to stop at Madame Malkin’s himself.
“It’s beautiful, sir.” She smiled at him for a moment. “Well, I’ll be leaving you two now. There’s a car downstairs waiting for you. I’ll be available by phone if you need me.”
“Thank you, doctor,” Mycroft said, walking towards the bed and sitting in one of the chairs pulled up to the side of the bed.  Dr. Michaels shook John’s hand before leaving the room. John and Greg pulled chairs up to the other side of the bed and sat, and they all waited. Mycroft was near the foot of the bed, and there was enough room to sit Jackie on it. Pulling a few blocks from the diaper bag, Mycroft sat them beside Jackie on the bed. Leaning forward, she grabbed one in each hand and picked them up, banging them together.
“Grip the bedrail, please,” he said, walking around to the foot of the bed. Sherlock followed, facing the bed and bending so that he was gripping the bedrail, slightly hunched over. “Good boy,” John soothed, running the flogger gently up and down Sherlock’s back. Sherlock took a moment to catalogue the feeling of the cool leather sliding against his skin, knowing it would be producing a very different sensation in a few moments.
“Ah, hello John. No, unfortunately the Trace is only put on young witches or wizards after it is brought to the Ministry’s attention that they exist. It takes a few weeks for the Trace to be implemented, and Liz’s hasn’t been placed yet.”
“And so you had two children- one dominant, and one submissive,” he continued for his mother. She nodded in response. “And I’m the submissive, aren’t I?” he asked, already knowing the answer. Both his parents nodded in response this time.  “And, what, I’m just supposed to find someone to boss me around while I clean the house and tell me I’m a good boy for the rest of my life?” Sherlock screeched, in full panic mode. Replaying his youth, he started making connections that previously had slipped his attention. “So that playgroup when we were young…?”
“Madame Malkins?” John asked as they exited Olivanders. It was starting to get late, and John could tell Liz’s energy was waning.
“Liz?” John said, slightly alarmed. He loosened his hold on Liz, but didn’t let go completely. “Liz, wake up!”
“Yeah, well three against one isn’t fair odds for anyone,” John answered. “I’m John. We met briefly last time?”
“No, I’ll just hold her for right now,” John answered back, wrapping his arms more firmly around her.
Anthea nodded once more before quietly letting herself out of the flat. Mycroft watched her go before going back to his bedroom, taking Jackie with him and placing her once more on the bed before quickly getting changed into a suit, foregoing the tie. Picking Jackie up once more, Mycroft wrapped her in the muslin, folding the side with the spittle facing out. “We’re going shopping, just for you,” Mycroft whispered as he made his way to the kitchen. Laying her on the table, Mycroft made himself a travel mug of coffee to take along with them. When it was ready, Mycroft picked up Jackie and propped her on his uninjured side, keeping the muslin draped loosely around her. It was an unusually warm summer, so Mycroft wasn’t worried about Jackie getting cold. She was still sniffling and snot was occasionally dripping out of her nose, so Mycroft made sure to tuck a few tissues into his pockets before leaving the flat. The door locked automatically behind him and he quickly got into the elevator and then into the car waiting for him.
What met them was a gruesome sight. A middle-aged white man was splayed spread-eagled on the pavement, arms severed from his torso. Blood pooled under and around the body.
“What a silly man,” Mycroft murmured to Jackie. “Now, what have we here?” he picked up the figure of the cow. “Can you say cow?” he said, pointing the cow at Jackie. “Come on, cow.” Although Jackie was becoming more vocal, there weren’t many words past no and da that she had mastered, and Mycroft was starting to worry that she was falling behind developmentally. Some of the parenting books said that babies could start talking as early as six months and, although he hadn’t known her at six months, Mycroft had a suspicion that she hadn’t been talked to much wherever she had been. He tried to make up for that neglect by speaking to her as often as he could. Other books said that she could be starting her first words at 11 months, which placated him somewhat.
“Well, I’m off to bed,” Greg said, standing and putting his hand unsteadily on Mycroft’s shoulder. “Get some rest, okay?”
“I think a stop at Madame Malkin’s will be in order,” John said, smiling as he watched her explore her new robes.
“I know,” Mycroft said, grinning at Greg and kissing him sweetly on the lips. “And now I think it is time for bed.”
They wandered down the street, Rose stopping at every one. Liz followed gamely behind, peering into every window with wonder. When they happened upon Flourish and Blotts, Liz gasped and her eyes widened.
Greg Lestrade stood with his hands on his hips, looking up at a woman’s corpse. What was strange, besides the fact that there were no wounds, was that it was hovering upside down in midair, seemingly not attached to anything. Sherlock stood staring up at the body, hands steepled in front of his face.
“Mr. Holmes,” the woman greeted. She had frizzy brown hair and was wearing a pair of plain black robes. “My name is Hermione Granger. I’m here to talk to you and John.”
Sherlock, noticing movement off to his side, glanced over and spotted Mycroft who was pointing at his watch.
"Um, sir I wouldn't-" but Marcia's warning came too late as vomit covered Jaclynn's front as well as a good portion of Mycroft's lap and bare chest. Mycroft just shrugged and sighed; honestly his day couldn't get any worse. Marcia got flannels from a compartment in the ambulance and quickly mopped up the vomit, throwing the dirty flannels in a plastic bag and settling in to look at Mycroft's side. "It's not bad," she commented as she cleaned it. "No stitches I'll just bandage it up for you." And she did just that, efficiently wrapping Mycroft's torso in white gauze and taping the end to the rest of the bandage. She then handed him a paracetamol to swallow dry. Jaclynn had slowly calmed down throughout the process, the tears stopping but her thumb staying firmly in her mouth.
“It is evident by the lipstick on his collar, the different cat hairs on his pants and the stain on his left knee.”
"Alright, we'll get you patched up quickly and see what we can do for little miss," Marcia replied, smiling kindly at the baby.
“No, I pretty much say that all the time,” John rebutted. They stood for a moment in awkward silence. “Would you like to get a drink with me?”
The silence in the flat was broken only by Liz’s small sniffles as she wiped at her tear-stained cheeks.
“No, I think we have everything we require,” Mycroft said, pushing their cart towards the checkout lanes. Mycroft paid for everything while Greg entertained Jackie in the cart.
“Alright,” Sherlock replied, flopping onto his back on the sofa. Holding his phone above his head, he typed out a message.
“Let’s get you in a nappy,” John said, tone gentle but betraying that he was still unhappy with Sherlock’s behavior. Sherlock felt a few tears slip down his cheeks as John led him over to the dark wooden changing table. John sat him on the light blue pad on top, reaching forward to strip him of his Belstaff. After he was done, he pressed lightly on his chest to get him to lay back. Sherlock went without complaint, one hand tucking up under his chin while he tucked the other thumb in his mouth. He was still quietly crying, mouth curled down around his thumb.
“Not that it’s any of your business, but some things require my personal attention. This is one of those times.”
“Her mother left when she was ten, and the money coming from the experiment is the only thing that kept them afloat,” Mycroft deduced of the dark-haired female standing several feet away from them.
“Good choice, that one is quite cute,” the saleswoman said. “I’ll just ring these up for you, shall I?”
“I brought a gift for Liz,” Mycroft said, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a small box no larger than his palm. “Often, the day of adoption is recognized every year by the family. I thought I’d start the tradition.”
“Here,” came a gentle murmur from beside him, and the bottle of scotch that he had been absently clutching was pried from his hand. A cool glass was pressed into his hand. “Take sips.”
“I’ve just been appointed Deputy Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, actually. You’re still at St. Mungo’s?”
“That’s fine. Just tell everyone Sherlock dashed out the back door and I followed merrily along,” John smirked.
“Unless we’re not,” the scientist said with a smirk. As if triggered by Mycroft’s thoughts, she shifted in her seat and shot at Mycroft. He dove to the side, but not quickly enough. He felt the bullet rip through his thigh, coming out the other side. Hissing, he slumped against the doorframe and gritted his jaw against the pain. This was much worse than the glancing shot he had received last time. Raising his gun, he shot at the scientist. A bloom of red appeared on her shoulder, just above her heart. She fell backward into her chair, a look of shock painting across her face. Apparently, she had forgotten that shooting him in the leg would not prevent him from shooting her. Mycroft moved forward, keeping his eyes and gun trained on her. He swallowed back the pain, sweat beading on his face. It was not the first time he would be working through intense pain.
