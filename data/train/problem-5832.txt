It had been quite a few weeks since Steve had last stormed into his room like this, but still, he immediately knew that sound-
that being with Tony meant being bitten by him. That they couldn’t possibly be together any other way.
off for me - thinking that if you just make enough effort, and do enough of the right things, it’ll work. It doesn’t work, believe me. That’s exactly what I tried to do for Pepper, and it just made us both miserable - when we were actually perfectly happy as we were. Look, if you want there to be
And Tony thrust into him again, and those stars fizzed brighter again, like a second burst of fireworks,
And it came in the same casual, breezy tone – but still, Steve immediately registered the strangeness of that statement. The…niceness, of it…
“Don’t worry, everyone does that when they first walk in” Maribelle assured him, offering him a hand up.
Steve had grown strangely fond of these thoughts over the course of the last few hours. They felt warm and comforting and genuine. Everything felt so
And it was a conflict that one side won, easily. Rapidly. Leaving an aching loss as Tony recognised that he’d
But the stairs down to the lower level were at the far end of a long corridor, and Tony was already halfway along it when he heard the flutter of panicked footsteps coming up from the basement-
… it was the other stuff he said,” Tony went on, more cautiously. Not confident the words were going to be there when he got to the end of the sentence. “I don’t really know how it happened… But suddenly, we’re talking about all this
“More than anything,” Tony assured him, punctuating the point with one final kiss before he went on, “
It was deeper than any of these individual memories he was now seeing anew, it was more than any of these singular points-
Tony kept his eyes fixed on Steve’s throat as he wet his fingers, and then ran them over Steve’s hole.
Even fresh out of the ice, facing the prospect of an alien invasion, while under the control of the mind stone, Steve still hadn’t completely let go. He’d lost his cool, yes, and been more controlled by his emotions than he’d like - but still, that whole time, he’d resisted the urge to scream or swear or cry. He’d been
Steve wanted to do was run to Tony. He could feel it pulling from the bottom of his gut, tensing his muscles to action over and over again,
That, if he wanted to help Steve let go, if he was going to take control of this thing for him, if he was going to make all the choices for the rest of the night, then he had to be very sure that Steve had made this one.
“...but if… all of that puts you off, I wouldn’t blame you,” Steve sighed. “I mean, I can’t even tell you that it’s no big deal, because I don’t know that either. And I can’t tell you anything about it, until I work that out for myself. And if you’d rather not… get involved, in any of that-”
he’d never told Steve he felt that way. He wished he could bury all of it, act as if he’d never thought it, erase that scene from a narrative he now wanted to shape another way.
Steve just heard it, loud and unambiguous in his head. No way to unthink it. No way to deny it. So, he simply acknowledged it, stoically, and waited for the wave of frustration and confusion that must surely follow. Telling himself he should at least
And then Nick strolled into the room, a raft of envelopes dangling casually from one hand, looking more relaxed than Steve had ever seen him-
And then he tilted his head up and pressed a long, slow kiss to Steve’s lips, confident and possessive… but still soft. He stroked his hands up along Steve’s ribs, and over his back, caressing his palms into Steve’s muscles as he pulled himself into his chest.
And just as Tony was beginning to accept that they’d probably made this long, sweaty, ridiculous journey for nothing, he heard the sound of someone
somehow made the grade after all - that maybe he could be more than his past mistakes, that maybe he would get the chance to work with a team and make a difference and be something better than he was-
thread of shared understanding between them, some experience or responsibility they all had in common, however different they otherwise were…
Tony let his head fall back against the couch, his hips jerking involuntarily, his mind whiting out completely. A low, aching pleasure tightened deep inside him. A sharp heat pulsed in the tip of his cock as Steve drew back, slowly, the flat of his tongue pressed to Tony’s skin.
The second appointment was the first time Bucky had to be put under a general anaesthetic – and Steve was more nervous about it than he was.
Steve groaned as that low ache grew heavier, the throbbing pain of it getting hotter and sharper with every needy little sound Tony made.
But it wasn’t the same dreary routes he’d trudged along on so many other sleepless nights. It wasn’t the obvious anxieties, the topics he might’ve expected to fixate on right now.
you to say anything. Well, unless you were already very tempted to say it, and only held back by fear, I suppose…”
Something slipped, setting off a chain of sensations that Steve knew he couldn’t stop. A tight, pulsing pleasure that was running on its own power now, pushing him ever closer - so close-
“And I don’t care what that looks like, and I don’t care what it might mean - there isn’t anything it
Tony grabbed at Steve’s t-shirt, his fingers curling into the fabric. And Steve stopped, and then sat back and smiled – and shrugged his way free of his shirt. And Tony just put his hands on him. There was no command from his brain, no connecting processes… Just that beautiful body, and that desperate desire to touch it, and then that perfect skin under Tony’s palms… Tony ran his hands over every inch of him, indulging in him in the most basic way. And when Steve went back to reaching over his head, Tony took the opportunity to touch more of him, grabbing at his ass before it apparently occurred to him to unbutton Steve’s jeans and tug them over his hips-
There was the rush of excitement, the thrill that ran up Tony’s spine and set his skin alight, more intense than it had ever been-
worried that I’ll be bad for you. I’m worried that I’m jumping into the unknown, just because I want to… And really, I just want to be able to say I told you that, and you said it was okay.”
,” fell over Bucky’s lips before he could stop it - and then there was a sharp jab in his ribs. He looked up and found Sam shooting him a warning glare… And Bucky would’ve liked to be put out by that, but, begrudgingly, he recognised that Sam was right-
“Or were scared, or threatened into helping…” But Tony didn’t sound especially convinced by his final suggestion. His shoulders slumped, heavily, with a weariness Steve could feel soaking into his own muscles. “So, there are Maribelles and SS Guards on every planet, then.”
do differently, if he woke up on the floor of that Bunker right now, and it was 2016. Even with all these new revelations, he would always have been stuck without some offering from Steve… And yeah, he could’ve apologised for the whole Bucky thing sooner, he could have amended a few individual mistakes. Maybe he’d have been less inarticulately furious, when they finally saw each other again…
It was also the first chance he’d had to wonder what the hell had happened to the others today. He’d been in such a rush to get to the finals before Bruce performed - and then so overwhelmed by the shock, amusement and bewildered pride of watching Bruce perform - that everything else had been pushed down the agenda. Of course, now that Bruce’s turn was over, and Tony and Rhodey had finished exchanging ‘
He left Steve fixed under his last command and stepped off of the bed to finish undressing, watching Steve pant and writhe under his gaze the entire time. And then Tony reached over to grab the bottle of lube that was already waiting on one of the bedside tables – along with ice, and bottled water, and anything else that he’d thought Steve might conceivably need tonight.
“But you can’t knock a guy out without him telling someone that you did it,” Sam glared back. “Since we’re trying not to draw too much attention.”
a neurological, scientific analysis of what makes a good painting, or a good song. Like there is a scientific reaction behind everything a cook does – but that’s not how they do it. They do it by sense and skill, more than by rational application of the process.”
“No, I really don’t think she knows what that is” Steve agreed “But she’s lying about everything else.”
you. I wish I’d been braver, and looked at all of this before I wrote that letter… before any of it happened. And I am so sorry for the hurt it all caused. I
And Tony was better placed to take a bullet or two than any human being on earth… But blood loss was one of the things that
In one clean step he’d gone from deep, comfortable sleep to completely awake, fully aware of the surroundings that he’d been
And then Steve just grabbed Tony’s wrist, and pulled him into his lap like he was weightless. Tony let out a surprised yelp, still grinning when he felt Steve’s arms close around him…
After all those years of pain and loneliness and confusion – all those years he’d had everything so wrong. Two decades believing he could never be anything other than what Obie had made of him-
, Tony could really only think about the fact that Steve would be here soon. Thinking perfectly ordinary things about it; wondering if he should kiss Steve when he got there, where they could actually sit and eat, trying to guess if Steve would be dressed up and what Tony could read into it either way…
And for a second Tony was so thoroughly overwhelmed by the bravery in Steve’s voice, so endeared by the earnestness of it and so moved by the vulnerability of it, that he didn’t hear the actual words.
them watching now. He could hear the way the background murmur of conversation had faded, and centred on them.
“Because knowing I can’t have him is hard enough,” Tony confessed. “I don’t want to have to make that case to
Tony opened his mouth to scream, but still no sound came out. He arced up against Steve’s lips, his muscles tensing against him as he twisted his grip in Steve’s hair-
Because the fact that he didn’t support The Accords, and the fact that might not want to cede authority to a government, and the fact that he might want to keep the right to make that choice himself, didn’t mean he couldn’t ask that question. Didn’t mean he had dismissed all other opinions or objected to the very idea of others input or that he didn’t think other people had rights to consider, too. None of this had
“After we had the big talk,” Tony replied, a little sheepishly. “I just decided it would be a good idea to kiss him – which makes
He couldn’t stop the memory of that first morning after, and the state he’d gotten himself into, right before he trashed his workshop.
This could’ve been minutes or hours after Tony collapsed onto Steve’s chest, panting and whimpering and pleading. He had no idea how long he’d whited out for, or how long it’d been since he’d come around, cradled tightly in Steve’s arms. And, for
Eyes burning, he took a quick glance around the workshop. There were unsteady piles of papers stacked on every surface, upturned boxes thrown at random across the floor, holographic displays full of nonsensical observations layered ten deep on every wall-
, in being dominated. He’d long since recognised a pattern in the images that caught his attention, and a few recurring themes in his - admittedly vague, still somewhat naive - sexual fantasies…
She fixed him with what was probably supposed to be a meaningful look… But Tony still didn’t really know what she was talking about, so he just stared back at her.
“...Are you okay?” He enquired, in a softer voice. She blinked at him, and then dropped her shoulders.
ask myself if it is. I have to let that be an option, so I can know it really wasn’t the answer. And that means I have to face the possibility that it might be all of those things, even when it’s someone as special and different as you are. I can’t… do something hurtful to
“I’m… not,” he sighed. “I just… You know, he’s leader of the Avengers, and it’s a little worrying when his location is unknown, and he’s uncontactable…”
“We try,” Coulson responded.  “Tony, these are Agents Paz and Dupree.  They’re fresh from Sci-Tech, and working in our robotics division.  Captain Rogers thought that might be a good place for you to start.”
“Could use a shield, I suppose,” Steve replied from where he was reclining in one of the wooden Adirondack-style deck chairs with a paper plate holding a sandwich perched on one knee.  He caught Tony’s frustrated groan and grinned goofily like he had said something amusing and not simply bat-shit crazy.
This was smart, really, he told himself rather unconvincingly.  Get it done, before Barnes or this lawyer friend-person managed to convince Steve to roll the proverbial dice on Tony’s threats.  Lawyers, in his experience, lived and breathed settlements, and it wouldn’t take long for one to sniff out that possibility here, given Tony’s circumstances.  So, this made sense.  Getting in Steve’s face a bit, which, really, was what Rhodey was up to, Tony knew.
He looked over at the pile of broken bags. Stacked like that, they looked like body bags, he realized and looked away, stomach churning, one hand reaching out blindly for something to grab onto and finding only the punching bag, which swung out of reach.
“Tony,” Rhodes cut in.  He, too, sounded tired, though his voice was laced with something that sounded to Steve like sympathy.  “Don’t do this to yourself.  Don’t. I know you, and I see what you’re…it’s…it’s not ever going to be what you want.  There’s no ending here that can be even close to—to what’s in your head, okay? You know that. I know you do.  You’ve got to be smart about this.  Look, I don’t know what’s going to happen.  Maybe nothing.  Maybe I’m wrong.  You know that I want you to be happy, Tony, not just as my King, but as my friend.  And he’s good for you.  I can see that plainly enough.  But, so can others, Tony.  Others—Obie, for one-- see how much power a concubine has, and—alright, fine, you don’t want to hear it?” Rhodes demanded.  Another scrape of a chair, and Steve started backing away, though where he was going, he didn’t know.  “All I’m saying is that I have years of having to be right when it mattered telling me that this is dangerous.  Something is…moving the wheel, something that I can’t see, and I’ll not lie, Tony, it scares me.  Someone is going to come looking for him, Tony.  One day.  Someone is going to come.  You know I’m right.”
“Like that, huh?” Tony questioned, sounding smug as he thrust again, hitting the same spot.  Steve was writhing on the bed, toes curling, hands scrabbling for purchase as Tony found a rhythm that pounded against that pleasure point over and over.  Steve was riding the top of some wave that refused to crest.  He couldn’t come down from the pleasure that sang through his body before Tony’s thrust found it again.
.  Yeah, he thought a few minutes later as he rested his head against the Kia’s backseat, this was probably not going to go well.
“Come here,” Hammer ordered, leaning back and crossing his arms over his chest.  Steve started to rise.  “Eh, no.  No reason to get up.  Crawl.”  He made a short, whistling sound and pointed at the spot between where his knees were splayed, then snapped his fingers, twice.
Might as well light a candle, burn the place to the ground and sing Happy Birthday to me, Tony thought bitterly.  He should’ve just shut up.  Let Steve cast his vote for Ellis. What was the big deal?  Ellis was going to win, anyway.
, Steve,” Tony shot back, turning to face Steve with a flurry of irritation.  “I don’t do that. Not anymore.  Not since you…”
Wherein, Steve's love of Tony's ass prevents Civil War and saves the universe from the Snap. Seriously.
“No worries, I have a knack for sharing appropriately curated slices of important historical pop references with the uninitiated,” Tony assured him lightly.  “If you don’t get annoyed with me too quickly, we’ll work our way through the entire Cusak oeuvre.”
Of course, none of that explained why he was sitting here huddled in his car next to the back entrance of a diner watching someone unload bags of soda and CO2 canisters.
“Sam’s call sign.   It was Falcon,” Steve reminded him.  “You shouldn’t…” he grimaced.  It bothered him, Brock’s dismissive mocking of Sam, even if it was just between them.  Sam didn’t deserve that.  “Pararescue’s pretty hard core, you know that.  You shouldn’t say stuff like that about him.  He’s a good man, trying to do some good for people who need help.  The program’s a worthy cause and always underfunded.  I want to help, and I can now.  That’s what… that’s what all this was about, right? ”
“Cool, cool, if it bothers you so much, no problem,” Brock replied, then paused and after a moment, smiled over at Steve.  “All I’m saying is, what would you do without me, huh?” he asked rhetorically, sending a teasing smile over at Steve as he nudged his arm against Steve’s shoulder.
, Steve thought.  Was there any higher expression of this than to mourn for a loss that wasn’t your own?  When Bucky released him, Steve walked slowly towards where Tony knelt, stopping just short of him.  The wind off the sea was whipping across the field, stirring the tall grass, spots of the bright yellow weeds that they had picked as gifts for parents when they were children bursting through the waves of green.
“Aren’t you?” Natasha questioned, voice low. He wanted to say no, but that wasn’t entirely true, and she would know it for a lie the instant it left his mouth.  She stared at him side-eyed when he didn’t answer, then clucked at her horse and kicked her heels into its side, urging it forward along Clint’s mount, which she pulled behind her.  Steve watched her wind her way ahead through the forest until she drew to a halt some ways ahead where Clint lowered himself from the limb of a tree overhead onto the back of his horse, which jumped and shied in objection until Clint managed to gain the saddle.  Once he did, the horse reared up, as if testing the new weight while Clint entreated it to whoa, rather ineffectually from what Steve could tell.   Steve shook his head a bit, feeling the corners of his mouth tug up as the scene played itself out.  Clint hated the horse, and Steve was confident the feeling was entirely mutual.
can have anything you want in the world,” he promised, already searching his way along Steve’s throat, finding that one particular spot.. “Because you are good…”
“We’re talking about a lot of people,” Tony mocked back. And then softened into something more sincere. “...But I might get it more than you think.”
Steve’s entire body was immediately alight with such an intense excitement that it was actually frightening.
And Steve softened back into his seat, allowing himself a genuine smile - because, yeah, he knew exactly what Tony meant.
His bones jumped at the shock of it, as a shout of alarm echoed in his own head. And then he recognised the sound, not simply as a phone ringing but as
, and even so much smarter than anyone thinks you are – that you keep trying to get even better, even when you know people are going to think the worst of you anyway, and that’s a genuine goodness that I’m in awe of, sometimes-”
Century France, in which she described the process of becoming a vampire as ‘very much like the process of becoming a woman’. A few lines that Tony knew by heart, by now-
It was just so unexpected, so surreal - so much better than anything he’d been bracing for. In the first instant, Tony was relieved and shocked… Without really knowing why.
- I mean, I’ve still not really figured all of this out. I literally thought of this in the shower this morning, so, you know… But, I’m sure of this much, at least. And, I’m sure that…” and he had to swallow down a bitter taste, and take a deep breath to prepare himself for the big finish. “I need to tell you what I really have planned, once we’re done with SHIELD.”
“To be honest, I thought I was being ridiculous writing any of it down, so…” Steve started awkwardly, worried he’d already killed the mood. Desperately scrabbling for any way to move on from this topic… Maybe just a
“How’s the pain, now?” Tony turned to talk to Bucky directly, his voice perfectly pleasant and professional.
That he didn’t know how much grip or force or extension to use, or something… that he’d have to be careful, not to miss, or smash the glass…
...But then he remembered Rogers telling him that he’d already tried keeping it a secret from him once, and it had worked out badly. Tony remembered thinking,
Steve felt his body soften. Like he’d just stumbled on a magic little fragment of time that stood sperate from everything else.
If Gary was found before he woke up, someone would probably just assume that he’d become unwell and fainted on his way to get that glass of water - and, as Steve had gone out of his way to steal a very specialised tranquilizer, with no long-term effects, they would likely put it down to his general ill health.
And then it might occur to him that if he didn’t drink again, he’d never run out, and then never have an excuse to call Steve again… which might lead to a stab of guilt for being manipulative, or a frisson of confusion as he wondered whether he could call Steve again anyway, or wave of embarrassment at the idea of being considered… a glutton, or a user, or something…
are you planning on doing that?” Bucky asked, sounding unimpressed. “You can’t just jump out there and do the hula - this isn’t the Lion King.”
My apologies that this update comes a little late in the day - my internet connection threw a tantrum this morning and simply WOULD NOT let me upload this before I went to work... So, I'm blaming rural broadband services for that one 😂
- and that’s not the weird part. That’s not the bit that confuses me. It doesn’t even confuse me that I sort of want to kill anyone that hurts you…”
“Is just one issue that complicates this a bit, yeah” Tony agreed, unhappily “And what the relationship is between these two groups – I mean, there
“Okay, fine.” She huffed, and then pointed impatiently at the device in his hand. “So, enter the co-ordinates then.”
Somehow, every hurt and anxiety and angry disappointment he’d ever carried got rolled into this aching physical need. As though it was powerful and pure enough to overwhelm everything about him.
“Hey, you’re here!” Scott announced, just a bit too jovially. From the performative edge, Steve had to guess that he was trying to lighten the mood - although, of course, it had the opposite effect.
“And then, when you asked me if I knew… Then I realised, of course I did. That Zola had literally told me that your parents had been murdered, and shown me a fucking picture of Bucky – just in case I hadn’t put two and two together, what with Bucky being Hydra’s fist, or whatever it was… And it was more than that, really. It was this horrible
Tony barked a frustrated groan at himself, all alone in his hallway, pausing mid-step so that he could screw his face up in anger.
Only that he wasn’t going to do anything that would hurt or upset Tony - which was still true. He still had no intention of putting Tony in an awkward position, or doing anything devious to sabotage his relationship, or asking him to choose
“There is?” Tony perked up - because he immediately knew what Rhodey was getting at, even if Rhodey didn’t seem quite sure…
defining factor that allowed someone to get close to him, the one thing his few genuine friendships had in common-
There was other… paraphernalia, set up in little areas through-out the room… Tony might’ve noticed a bath somewhere off to the left, and some sort of… bench, thing, that he didn’t look at for long enough to work out…
How could Tony possibly explain that he was doing everything he could not to think about it anyway? That even thinking about it would change him, would force him to face what he’d become already?
to apologise to you right now.” And Steve stilled completely, and sat back compliantly, for no reason other than Tony had asked him to… because he’d told Steve what he wanted.
And there was the tiniest little intake of breath on the other end of the line, a sound that managed to be frightened and brave, stoic and defiant, all at once…
,” Steve explained. “Or, I mean, I don’t know if either of them care, actually – but I mean it makes a difference… about them? If you say,
Tony was just too clever, too adaptable, too impossible to beat. He’d found ways to hide his kindness, and his vulnerabilities, but they were all still there. He took all of those impossible, unfair burdens onto himself – but he wouldn’t let them best him. He’d found a way, after all those years, to put up a mask and hide the hurt and push beyond it, a way to reach out to people whilst still keeping his distance…
“...Just… Having a look,” Tony managed, clenching his teeth against the rapidly increasing threat of giggles. He had to drop his eyes - he knew, if he looked at either Bucky or Sam, he was done for.
“Ignore what?” Steve heard himself asking, his outrage running on autopilot while that enlightenment continued to unfold in his head.
himself… “And if they ask in advance we’re just going with the hours of fully-clothed cuddling fantasy thing. It’s fine. Let’s do this.”
The walls and floor were made of the same dark, imposing wood, embellished with the same formulaic carvings. At the far end of the room, directly ahead of them, was a raised stage with a long, stoic looking dining table - which Tony automatically named the teachers table, even though he’d figured out that it was for the Avengers. The crest that was built into the wall behind it was far showier and probably far more expensive than the one at Tony’s school - possibly made out of solid gold, and studded with tiny diamonds - but still, it sat in exactly the same place, and to the same effect. The rest of the guests were seated at rectangular tables that lined the room, all leaning into the centre so that they could gossip excitedly…
behalf came with a subtle judgement that he wasn’t capable of dealing with it, that his way was wrong.
Steve was dizzy by the time Tony broke away, too breathless to attempt any of the frantic pleas that were building up in his head-
And Steve looked up, and saw Maribelle standing just there beside them, smiling warmly. And then he saw the blonde guy, still holding a tray of shot glasses, standing behind her like a royal guard.
He paused, hand still raised towards the door handle. A queasy awareness curled in his stomach, as he rushed to identify this oddly familiar anxiety...
And then, the specific choice of argument, the flow of words and the internal logic that led you to believe he’d really thought about this – that, underneath his likeable egotism, there was almost certainly a competence and a desire to do good…
“Okay, so the rest of the building is being dosed with a very mild earth-based sedative, and… something else that’s mild, I don’t know – but, as a safeguard, if the drug-feed was ever cut, so that everyone doesn’t just crash out” Tony explained.
Tony was glad that he’d had the chance to simply be close to Steve like that. It felt like it changed things. Like maybe, when they did get around to talking, they could do it from a completely different place now. Like maybe it mattered beyond just being nice.
“Well, it’s just a thought,” Tony shrugged. And then he glanced back at Steve. “Why, what’s he like, as a roommate?”
Steve pushed Tony’s legs further apart as he sucked, eagerly, the back of his tongue dragging over the head of Tony’s cock as he took him right to the back of his throat. Tony was immediately flooded with a heavy, pulsing pleasure, a wave that swelled up to the very limits of him – and then ebbed back into a compulsive, stinging need.  Involuntarily, Tony pulled Steve’s hair into a fist – earning a groan from Steve that he could
The faintly amused observation that it would be really silly to say it out loud, that – if he was in his right mind – he should be outraged at himself for doing this…
as he was about to feel bad about it, he felt Tony shuffle closer to him, and put a tender hand to the side of his neck…
But it was just an echo now. A shadow of what it had been. Nowhere near strong enough to over-ride how much he’d recently learned.
He shifted into panic mode immediately. He didn’t think about the next words he blurted out – he was blindly
And Steve felt an immediate and organic instinct to open himself to Tony completely, to let Tony see every part of him, to answer any question Tony put to him honestly and without hesitation.
There was a split second of confusion at that response – a reaction Tony took advantage of to push Steve onto his back. Steve lost a surprised breath, his hips arching upwards instinctively as Tony stood up. He glanced up in time to watch Tony step free of his shorts, and flash him another devious grin, before he knelt down at the foot of the sunbed
“I’m good, I’m sorry” She answered quickly, slurring slightly. “Sorry, I swear we’ve not started this early in the morning – this is still last night.” She explained, holding out her hand for her partner. Slowly, and without an obvious comprehension, he took it, and let her pull herself up.
And with that thought, Tony’s frustrations evaporated completely. He actually felt silly, for ever thinking those petty things mattered.
Steve smiled more naturally when he nodded at that. He tried to make a mental note of that detail, for when he was invariably baffled by something Lorien said-
Tony got to announce that they were done. He stood back swiftly and turned away, only thinking of giving Bucky space-
to say all these things to Steve. “Everything about you is beautiful. Just looking at you, being with you, makes everything beautiful… safe, and happy, and
A sharp tingling broke out all over his skin as he tried to process what about this one image was so instantly, disorientingly thrilling-
“You know, I don’t think we were officially ‘a couple’, before last night,” he said instead, his voice still rich with laughter. Rhodey scoffed at him.
Was still a deeply disturbing thought, yes, and clearly Tony still had a lot of ugly issues to work through. Fine.
“I’d say that counts as a loophole,” Tony reassured, light-heartedly. “You have a solid argument for wearing an armoured sweatshirt.”
Rhodey didn’t ask him to explain that. He just said that he was there if Tony needed him, and that he’d be back again the following day… And Tony didn’t bother to argue. He could tell from the way that Rhodey said it that he’d be coming back anyway.
his clothes - that this somewhat translucent shirt and too-tight pants were simply the least-worst option, when it turned out he really
Steve’s internal crisis had come on much hotter and faster than Tony’s - and consumed itself far more quickly.
“Good morning - or should I say, good afternoon,” she offered politely, in a slightly more caution tone than he remembered.
It had all fallen into place in one horrible, vivid instant – even before he read the title on the other side of the flyer, now visible through the damp paper.
Without being asked, Steve shuffled back so that he was sitting up by the headboard, right in the middle of the king-sized mattress - leaving plenty of room for Tony to sit beside him. Tony put the bag down on the end of the bed, and then deliberately took his sweet time over removing his cufflinks, and sliding his jacket down over his arms, and loosening his tie… Steve could feel the tension building with every second he was forced to wait, the heat flooding up his back as he watched every little movement Tony made…
Steve exhaled softly, as he began to recognise that he wasn’t looking at anything worse than the aftermath of any every-day mission…
And all of that was just sounds in his head. Isolated sentences that drifted through his mind like clouds across a summer sky. Purely decorative elements, with no power to shape or define the mood he was in. He noted some of them, and ignored others, and felt nothing specific about anything-
He’d never wanted any of those things, specifically - he’d only ever wanted Steve. Those might have been the images he chose to represent it, but only because they were loaded as a default. All he really cared about was sharing a life with Steve, he didn’t actually have his heart set on any other detail, he didn’t
If it was really as simple as ‘be completely honest’, then Steve should tell Tony all of that, right now.
To the point where he felt as though he’d lost all hold on his long-term plans, but not the toxic reliance on them. To the point where he felt bad about where he was, no matter from which angle he looked at it.
“You’re right. I apologise for unfairly disparaging assholes,” Bucky grinned. Steve breathed a laugh.
“Ah, no – the short answer is that I got carried away…” Tony answered, grateful that it wasn’t physically possible for him to blush.
“And now everything is ruined, and even if my brother doesn’t kill me and the Council don’t arrest me, I’ll have nowhere to go” She sounded numb now. Almost resigned. “My family are monsters, and I have done horrible things, and there’s just nothing for me now.”
“You know… You should be able to say the things you aren’t sorry for, too.” Tony told him, softly – his voice uncharacteristically fragile. “And… I know I’ve probably made that as hard as saying you’re sorry. And it’s probably hard for a lot of the same reasons… But, you know, if you can’t say those things, it’ll end up being just as bad. And I am sorry if I’ve been… defensive, or judgemental or unsympathetic about that stuff before, and taken things personally, and… yeah. I just mean…”
Steve felt his ribs clench, his whole-body tensing in sudden alarm. He stepped behind Tony, his hands braced to grab him, his eyes fixed on Tony’s arm. Waiting for something terrible to happen.
we’d realised the potential of Tabula Rasa… People like Andrew would come to us, and say that they were struggling, and all we
In the end, this mission that they’d spent so long thinking about and worrying over had probably taken less than five minutes, start to finish.
, thinking back to the instructions he’d heard before and the things he’d learned about all manner of tech… the same way he’d worked out how to use all of modern technology, with such little fanfare…
“He was okay,” Tony said eventually, his voice stiff. “Also quiet…pretty sure he didn’t like me. I don’t know… I’m thinking maybe that I should just ask Bucky to come on his own next time…”
wasn’t in his right mind, and couldn’t make a decision like this, and Tony would’ve just had to make him understand…
And then he sat up on the couch, instinctively reaching for his shirt as he shifted back into work mode. But before he put it on, he turned to Steve with a sigh,
“Something like that” He thought aloud, going back nearly ten years to something he’d not really been listening to in the first place “Fury said something about the serum making my intellect ‘more functional’ as opposed to ‘just better’… or something… To be honest, I think I’d been out of the ice a week when he tried explaining that, and I didn’t really care…”
“No!” he warned again, stepping into Steve so that he could use him as a human shield, talking to Peter over his shoulder…

Steve. The shape and warmth of Steve’s body there beneath him, the sheer strength Tony could feel pressed up against his chest, the
“But…Mine?” Steve interrupted sharply, his body so tense by now that it was sitting up of it’s own accord.
“What would be the point?” Steve frowned “She’s only going to lie to us again. We don’t know enough about what’s going on to threaten her, even.”
, or something, and Zan’s telling us that’s torture and the government are saying it’s a very merciful punishment – and we’re just thinking it looks like goo. You know, when it’s a thousand complicated issues all layered on top of each other, and loads of stuff we can’t know for ourselves.
And then there were these moments. Moments of minor reprieve, in which Bucky simply existed, and nothing was much of anything…
And she managed to pause, in the middle of her stream of consciousness, to look at each of them in turn – like some part of her
situation, then maybe it means you’re clinically insane.” Tony finished, breezily. And Steve huffed a soft little laugh, a genuine softness somewhere in his eyes now.
desperate to hold on to what you’ve experienced here, and if being here has been so life affirming that you can’t bare to undo it, why are you so sure it’s wrong for the whole world?”
Steve felt maybe the briefest flicker of confusion as Tony dropped his head – maybe he’d assumed that Tony would lean up to his neck, or take his wrist-
? What sort of relationship could there be, what possible sense of self could Tony have, if the other person simply existed to support him?
“And… I think maybe sometimes you will feel bad about doing the right thing,” Tony carried on. “If you’ve spent your whole life listening to people tell you that you
“Adam’s research team worked with the local population, to produce drugs that were effective on humans – some recreational, some medicinal. And all initial trials here on New Eden were phenomenally successful, in both categories, and Adam was hugely optimistic when he brought the final products back to earth.” Dramatic pause. “Where they had no effect what-so-ever”
A woman’s voice came on the line almost immediately. She recited an address and a six digit number. The line went dead. It happened so fast, Steve barely had time to think. He frowned down at his phone. So, that was it? A number and an address. Was he just supposed to show up there? He supposed that was the idea. Anonymity, after all. It probably moved around, whatever this place was. Never the same location twice. That’s why you called.
“Why not? If my nobles and guests want to find entertainment for the evening, they will find an abundance of it in the city, where they can use their own coin instead of mine,” Tony said with a low shrug, though the casualness was belied by the hard gaze he leveled on Steve. “The Royal Harem is a long tradition, I’ll grant you, but we were no more than ironmongers once with little more than the hammers and anvils of our forebearers to our names. Wandering the wastes, looking for a home. We didn’t have harems then. We built things,
“Excuse me, Sirs,” JARVIS intoned as evenly as he could probably be managed under the circumstances.  “Director Fury has arrived for the debriefing.  The team is gathering in the conference room.  Your presence is requested.  I am to tell you that you can be assured that the bubble will be respected and it shall not be necessary invoke Rule Number Four, which, despite this representation from Mister Barton, I feel compelled to inform you, would violate the Geneva Convention if ever utilized.”
“It’s Spring Meadow,” Steve pointed out with a small, lopsided smile, eyes twinkling.  Then his expression softened, and he reached out to trace his thumb over Tony’s cheek where a small scar cut across his skin, nearly invisible now, but they both knew it was there.  “You’re a great Dad, Tony.  The best,” Steve said.
He wasn’t sure what woke him.  Movement or a noise or the dawning realization that he was alone in the bed.  Steve blinked the sleep from his eyes and squinted into the darkness.  The fire was down to embers, and the torches burned low in their cradles.  He sat up and glanced around, gaze landing on one of the large, stuffed chairs by the fire, where a figure sat in shadows.
“Good, Tony.  I’m good,” Steve replied, the words sort of thrumming through his mind in a blurry, hazy sort of mash. He considered if they were true and stretched a bit, testing. It felt a bit like coming up for air after being underwater, not unpleasant, but sharp.  He could feel his breath in his chest, the press of Tony against his ribs, the warmth of the room. A dawning sort of awareness of things beyond just how he felt started creeping in. He closed his eyes, trying to sink back into the feeling from before.
She let go of Steve’s wrist, tracing her metal nails up his arm to his collar, where she tapped at it, giving him a long, knowing look.  Her tongue darted out to wet her lips.  She dropped her hand and clasped them together, clacking her fingertips in a careful motion that made Steve think of watching a spider as it readied to wrap its prey.
“That’ll do for a start.  You should know that Agent Romanov is going to be assigned to the strike team with him,” Fury casually mentioned, the grain of knowledge apparently Tony’s reward for agreeing so readily to Fury’s demands.  Tony decided he absolutely hated being manipulated while he knew he was being manipulated.
It didn’t really matter, Steve supposed.  What was done, was done, whatever his stupid scenarios he might fantasize about.  Besides, Steve was fairly sure he wouldn’t have left even if Tony told him the money was off the table.  Not that he was ever going to mention that to Brock. He should probably feel guilty about that, but every time his mind edged toward guilt, he just remembered something else about the night.  A flash of Tony’s eyes as he watched Steve in the helicopter.  Tony’s laugh.  The way his hands skimmed over Steve’s skin, reverent and carnal at the same time.  He’d wanted Tony, and it had been
“That was designer,” Tony argued, grinning back at him.  “Point being, people will buy me marrying a stripper on a drunken whim.  That’s half expected, truth be told.  People will not buy me marrying—God, you look like Andy Griffith.  Or Mr. Rogers.  Do you have a cardigan?  You do, don’t you?  You’re going to ‘aw-shucks’ and ‘swell’ me any minute now.  I can feel it.  I need more coffee.  I can’t handle this without caffeine.”
“I think,” Cam began, walking slowly over to the window to peer out into the bailey.  “I think it is easy to forget what you are when someone like the King treats you as different.  But, you are not different,” Cam continued, his voice slow and halting. “Not really. Not to the rest of the world.  You are only different because he says it is so. So, you should make sure that he keeps saying it and give him no cause not to.  That is what I think.” He turned to face Steve, eyes narrowed, then he grinned and clapped his hands together with clear anticipation.  “Though,” he started, drawing out the word with as much dramatic flair as he could muster, “the last Raj’Inama only lasted a short while. She was poisoned by the king’s wife, or so they say, for the queen did not like the king’s favor falling so heavily on another. Then she gifted him with three new concubines who all looked exactly alike! Can you imagine such a thing?”
“Exactly so,” Jarvis nodded, tapping a finger against his mouth as he considered.  “Really, Tony, don’t be an idiot.  Kiss the man.  Visit your mother.  She would do with seeing you.  And tidy your room.  It’s atrocious, even for you.”
“I know you miss where you are from.  Your friends.  Then finding yourself as you did with Rumlow, and with years of war only barely behind you.  At first, I wanted you to put all of that behind you.  Your longing for the past, it…well, the truth of it is, I was jealous of it, small man that I sometimes am,” Tony grimaced, shaking his head and letting out a breath.  He reached up and pinched the bridge of his nose between his fingers and squeezed his eyes shut for a long moment.
“I’ll think about it,” Steve said, which seemed the most expedient way to end the conversation and get out that didn’t involve breaking the damn door.
“Come for me, Steve,” Tony urged as he worked his hand and the sponge with as much deft ease as he usually reserved for building his machines.  Steve moaned, tearing his lips from Tony’s and let his head sink to Tony’s shoulder.  “So good for me.  Almost there,” Tony said, then wrapped the sponge around the head of Steve’s cock and twisted his wrist in a circular motion once, twice, and then Steve was coming so hard he nearly sent them both reeling into the edge of the bath, though Tony held him and kept his hand working Steve’s cock as the last of the pulses shook through Steve’s body.
“Master Zola said I’m to be your attendant now.  I made you a bath.  Just like the King said. It was nice and hot, but, you were gone so long, I-I think it got cold now, though,” Cam said with an apology in his voice.  “Sorry.”
The world tilted on its axis, blurred, then formed into almost too-sharp relief, everything crashing into him at once, but none of it made sense.  It was there, in front of him.  He could see it.  Right there.  But his mind couldn’t make any sense of it.  His vision blacked for a moment, everything seemed to dissolve, then reform.   When it did, it was wrong, distant somehow, like he was above it, not fully present, watching it happen through a long lens.
“With just your bots on fire safety?” Steve teased with a wide smile, making Tony startle at how close it was to what had been running through his head.  “Besides, I figured you were getting a bit tired of my cooking, anyway,” Steve replied.  “I could do with a bite, though.  Didn’t get much chance to eat in the field.”
“We are both of us quick to grant each other an absolution we cannot seem to grant to ourselves,” Tony observed, then fell quiet for a long moment, eyes fixed, staring at nothing.  “You would see the best of me, and I can’t even bring myself to correct you. Not really. I want it far too much, selfish bastard that I am. That night,” Tony began again, then stopped himself and took a deep breath, turning to look at Steve with an unwavering gaze. “You don’t know—you don’t know what I’m capable of. When it comes to you, anyway. That night… I thought you would be better off away from me. I still think that might be true. I see it. Every day, I see
Steve swallowed, shook his head a bit and shoved his hands in his pockets, looking down at the carpet, where his shoes shone with such a high polish, he could see a bit of his reflection distorted across the toes.  When he looked back up, Tony was looking him up and down with an almost shocked expression, that Steve hoped meant that clothes made the man and all that.
do, seeing only the parts of my life that were missing or messed up,” Steve began, picking his words carefully.  It seemed important, to explain himself to Shellhead. He owed his friend that, true enough, but he wanted to say it, too.  He wanted Shellhead to know how important all of this—how important
Tony wasn’t quite sure how it happened, but he was soon lounging against the overstuffed arm of a sofa with a plate of food on his lap and a cup of punch on the low table in front of him, listening in rapt wonder as the Omegas traded stories, gossip and advice, like well-dressed crows on a telephone line.
He tasted bile and blood and realized he’d bitten the inside of his cheek. He grabbed a tissue from the box on the table and spat into it, then tossed it in the wastebasket. As he did, his gaze caught on something else on the table, and suddenly, his flagging cock started pounding. His hand itched with need, and yeah… yeah, that’s what he wanted. Needed. No restrictions, right? It must be something the man liked, if it was here, and God, yes, Steve wanted this, he realized, his mouth watering. This. This was what he needed.
The warehouse, with its sturdy walls of stone and packed clay, was like an oven in the heat of the day, though it turned cold at night, when the sun left and the ground underneath him cooled.  He tried to think of that.  The way the stone wall felt against his forehead as he curled against it at night.  How the grains of sand that covered the floor chilled as the sun waned.  Back home, it snowed.  Drifts so deep they swallowed your leg when you stepped out into them.  It would be snowing now, he thought, though there was no one left there to curse the cold and pray for spring.  They were all gone.  But, Shmidt was dead.  Shmidt was dead, and that was worth Steve’s life.  That was worth even this.  He stopped thinking about that and looked toward the door.
It didn’t take long. Sensation rushed through Steve like a wave, emanating from where Tony’s cock rubbed against his, wrapped in the heat of Tony’s oil-slicked hand. Steve’s hips bucked and he thrashed his head from side to side against the press of Tony’s forehead, and then he was coming, hard, hips jerking, body going rigid as he spasmed, coating Tony’s stomach with thick streams.  Tony stroked him through it, whispering soft words in the space between them that slowly filtered into Steve’s pleasure-addled brain.
“He’s—mom, he’s kidding, he’s—“ Tony tried, biting his lip to try to keep from laughing.  “It’s a—an inside joke.  Would you stop?” he demanded, looking up at Steve with what he hoped was an exasperated frown.  “No one knows when you’re joking.  You have the Serious Face going and everyone thinks they should salute or back away slowly or something.”
“You don’t have to stop,” Tony said.  “Not because of–I—I’m early.  I wasn’t going to bother you.  I told you to use the gym anytime you wanted.  Happy said,” Tony stopped, clearing his throat.  “Happy said you’d been down here awhile.”
“Okay, see, but there’s really nothing to worry about, and if I tell you, you’ll worry, because you strike me as the type who worries.  You get that cute little thing on your brow, right there,” Tony said, tapping his finger between Steve’s eyebrows until Steve batted his hand away, “Which, I love, true, but I’m a tad concerned your face is going to get stuck like that—this is a legitimate phenomenon.  Jarvis warned me like a hundred times when I was a kid, keep making that face, it’ll stay like that—Butler Jarvis, not AI JARVIS, though he
“I think I’m going to see if I can pull Andrew away. He promised me a dance,” Sugar said, standing up and smoothing out her pantsuit.  Probably dusting off the cooties, Tony thought with an inward grin.
In retrospect, he could have been a bit more helpful instead of just assuming that there was a bright future at the end of their rainbow. He'd ranted and railed at the injustice of it all, cut back where he could. That had seemed painful, at the time, but now, he wondered how his tightening of the proverbial belt had really looked to Steve. Little rich boy, playing at being poor like it was one of those charity-vacations the well-meaning, well-off went on these days, going native for just long enough to feel better about himself, but never actually having to internalize any of what Steve dealt with. Easy to judge when everything is always easy, Tony could admit, at least now, if only because he wanted to, and what did that tell him?
“I kept imagining you, back here, in my bed, while Stern and his ilk droned on and on about taxes and tariffs.  The guilds are demanding military escorts to stave off raiders on the Eastern routes, and we haven’t the admiralty for it, but with the Assarians still refusing to properly patrol their own shores, what choice have we?  We’ve lost far too many merchant ships in those waters already, and Stern is all but refusing to provide letters of transit without the Crown’s backing.  Thoughts of you might have been the only thing keeping me sane,” the King muttered, half under his breath as he dipped his head and knocked his booted toe against the bottom of the bed.  “The finding, though.  That…quite exceeded the imagining,” he said, giving his head a light shake around a huff of deprecating laughter.  The King pushed himself off the poster and walked the few steps up the bed closer to Steve.  His eyes were dark, heated and narrowed as they swept up and down Steve’s body.  He rolled his lip between his teeth, as if weighing something Steve couldn’t begin to fathom.  Steve could feel an embarrassed flush prickle across his skin, and his cock twitched and thickened where it lay against his thigh, as if in memory of what that mouth could do.
“Really, all this—all this business talk.  Honestly!  Can you all manage to not talk shop before dinner even gets started for once?” Maria asked brightly through a painted-on smile.  “They’ve just Bonded!  They don’t want to talk about contracts and…armor, or whatever, for goodness sakes.  Anthony, Susan Brightman, you remember her from my bridge club?  She said she saw you at the Honoring Our Heroes gala.  Now, I want to hear all about it!  Don’t skimp on the details.  You know your father never takes me anywhere anymore.  Tony never did much care for those kinds of things, Captain,” she continued with an exaggerated sigh.  “Always had to be a bit difficult about it.”  Over his mother’s words, Tony heard Howard swallow a cough at the understatement. “I’m sure it was different with his Alpha  there, though.”
“Would that this were true, General Ross. It would certainly make my job far easier,” Rhodes replied.
“Couldn't sleep,” Tony admitted, shoving his hands under his arms to keep them warm. “Thought I'd, you know, mess around in the garage a bit. It—sometimes--it helps me sleep. Slows things down enough, I guess, if I can get some of it out.”
“Does…Iron Man know that?” Steve shot back, earning a frown from Stark that quickly melted into a roiling laugh that had Stark banging a hand on the table and grinning like a fool.
liked kissing Tony, who returned even Steve’s somewhat fumbling attempts with a surprisingly eager fervor and soft, encouraging moans that echoed warm and sweet into Steve’s mouth.
Unease, sharper now, prickled along Steve’s spine and settled into his gut. Something was wrong about all of this. Not just the strangeness of this place, but the man himself, something about him made Steve think of a rabbit in a snare and the sound of boots crunching on leaves as the hunter approached.  It was such a vivid thought, he had to wipe a hand over his face to try to shake it from his mind.
“You liked my picture,” Tony repeated dully.  He wasn’t sure what he’d expected to hear, but not some half-baked, swipe-right, lame-ass reason for suddenly finding himself Bonded.
Tony pulled the door opened and stopped, one hand on the knob, the other braced on the doorframe with his jacket in his fist.  He looked over his shoulder at Steve, one glance, up and down.  “I like how you painted me,” Tony said, then pulled the door closed behind him as he left.
If this idea had occurred to him as part of that jumble of anxious thoughts, he would have shut it down.
“...Well, I’m not saying he’ll be any better in a couple of hours,” she added. “I’m just saying, no one seems to be getting anything out of him right now.”
He remembered the car ride to the hospital. The razor-edged focus on Wesley; the hyper-awareness of every move he made, every word he whimpered under his breath, every pained expression. And, looking back on it, Steve was horribly aware that he’d not even been thinking of Wesley as a threat, at that point. By then, it was like a concentrated hatred, an inability to move past his blind outrage that this man had
Natasha exactly how cruel she’d been to Tony, how cruel she was prepared to be to him - how sorry he was to have overlooked that, back when it didn’t directly affect him. How much he regretted never standing up for Tony on that one. How he intended to redress that mistake, this time around.
“I wouldn’t know what I was missing, but that doesn’t mean I wouldn’t be missing out” Tony argued – and then, when he realised that’d been a bit close to some line, he added “You could say that about anyone you cared about”
“…She called the team after you hung up on her,” Pepper continued, somewhat awkwardly. “She’d already tried to contact Captain Rogers by the time I called back, no answer. I passed on the details I had – she said they’d send a response right away.”
still,” Tony explained apologetically, as he took a screwdriver – or, something a bit like a screwdriver – and
His eyes fell on the champagne bottle as he strolled by it again, and this time he mindlessly picked up the card. As expected, it was the name of the hotel embossed on the front of it. Tony opened it, and automatically translated the handwritten message inside,
The happiest memories were the most painful, now. These were usually the memories he flinched from, the moments he had deliberately buried under layers of righteous anger. But now Tony thought he might prefer thinking about last Christmas, if it meant he got a break from endlessly rehashing what had happened
“I know,” Steve nodded. “But the truth is… I realised a long time ago that my life might not look exactly like a Hallmark Holiday Special – and I mean before the serum, even. I was never someone who could take a certain life for granted, or had my heart set of one type of future… I mean, I knew I wanted to serve my country, and I knew I wanted to fall in love – but I never cared much how I got there, or what it looked like,” a faint blush ran up Steve’s neck as he remembered himself in a poorly fitted wool uniform, selling war bonds to the tune of
Bucky allowed himself a relieved breath, just because it sounded like good news. Of course, he didn’t really have a concept of ‘the last time around’. Steve had explained the basic steps on his journey from Brooklyn Heights to where they were right now, but Bucky only really understood that on an academic level.
“Well, for what it’s worth, I’d not really thought about how hard it is to write a letter,” Tony mumbled… He didn’t know why he’d said that, either. “I mean, it’s been forty years since any normal person did that…”
a little longer for the two of you, if the serum enhances those effects at all - but even so, I can assure you, you’re at no risk, and you’ll soon feel like your normal selves again. Well, unless you’d
“Well, I thought he might be good for you, obviously,” she began. “He seemed to understand the things that made you special, right off the bat. And the way he talked about Bucky, I just thought… that he clearly see’s the humanity in people first. So, yeah, I thought maybe he’d be good for you. But I’ve thought that about a few people, in the last ten years. I’ve met lots of people and thought they might be able to help you… But that’s no good, is it, if there’s nothing you can offer them.”
He was right to tell Steve his point of view, as well as being right about several of those arguments.
a fairly convincing performance. Just heartfelt enough to seem sincere, and understated enough to sound natural-
He knew that he could take her keys by force, that he’d remember how hotwire an engine – and he’d have done it, if there was no other option.
“Oh, hey,” Rhodey greeted him. “This is Figaro - he was explaining the difference between a hallucination and a shift in your perception.”
So, Tony let Steve grab him by the waist and pull him on top of him, immediately surrendering to Steve’s kisses, accepting the messier, more frantic pace that he was setting. Moaning low in his chest as Steve ground up against him, the sound muffled against Steve’s lips. Tony dropped his head to kiss Steve’s neck, sucking softly against his skin, creating a trail of little red marks along the column of his throat that faded far too quickly. Steve’s hands swept excitedly over Tony’s back, grabbing erratically at his shoulders and waist and hips, stroking over the curve of Tony’s ass just as he rocked up to meet him. Tony dug his nails into Steve’s skin as a hot friction curled tightly in the core of him, pushing a desperate gasp over his lips.
...And he looked down at Steve, his skin flushed to the point of glowing, his eyes alive with such a
-” Steve keened, a sharper sort of frustration in his voice. Tony could see the way Steve’s shoulders had started to tremble, the way he clawed at the sheets as he arched up off of the mattress.
In fact, the only time Quill troubled Steve’s thoughts at all was when the faintest echo of muttered singing bounced off of the rocks behind him…
And Steve blinked at him, and there was a stab of panic as Tony realised just how bad that had sounded.
Tony scanned the group to look for Steve. By then, they’d walked a little way across the wide, paved plaza in front of the hotel; the sort of place that Tony expected to see dancing fountains. He was very briefly distracted when he recognised the soft pink and purple glow that seemed to bathe the courtyard - or, rather, by the observation that he couldn’t see the source of it… And then his eyes caught on Steve.
Steve felt a bit self-conscious, suddenly second guessing his wording and unsure of the reaction he was expecting, even worried that he’d regret sharing something this personal.
to say that I am sorry I didn’t tell you about your parents – not just sorry I hurt your feelings. Sorry I did it, because it was short-sighed and reckless and... wrong. And I
related to those diaries we found in London, but I can’t say for sure,” she finished on an upward note.
“We can talk about that later,” Rousseau number one replied, with a patronising wave - but his partner was simply too excited to keep his mouth shut.
He opened his eyes, at last. He waited for them to burn… and then causally remembered that, of course, they wouldn’t.
And then, for a full minute, she was actually quiet. She just sat, exhausted, and looking thoroughly miserable.
He saw the dark crimson stain, still spreading slowly through the fabric, an illicit thrill pinching in his hips as he remembered how exciting that was…
He felt Tony smile against his skin, his hand caressing affectionately into Steve’s side as he carried on kissing him, slowly and deliberately…
The tension had gone from his shoulders, and he wasn’t gritting his teeth anymore… but in place of that was a sad sort of heaviness. He looked as though he’d just finished hearing bad news, or thinking very hard about life… Steve would’ve liked to ask.
There was a sudden, bright flash in Steve’s head as Tony hit his prostate again, his other hand dragging roughly over the head of Steve’s cock. A more urgent sensation shot through him, catching him off guard… an edge of hunger, echoing after it.
a Mortal Blessing is a ceremony… Like a wedding, or something… I don’t actually know if any of that is right. There really isn’t much in there about that-”
His legs fell open. His head fell back into the pillows as he arched his back. He didn’t even know why - only that it felt good, and he
And, okay… maybe he’d not used the best examples during that rant either. Maybe he’d pushed certain points beyond being
Steve finally recognised it was his turn to talk… but he still couldn’t. There was a lump in his throat, for a start. And even if he could’ve physically formed words – what words? There were no words.
“I just… I don’t know, I think it got it into my head that he was a threat,” Steve shrugged. “I don’t know what I thought he was going to do… And… I was just so angry at him…”
Now, as he made the final walk up to 10880 Malibu Point, his only thought was of Tony. By the time he reached the end of the driveway, Steve had been moving at a near run, barely noticing the way his pace had picked up to meet his heart rate-
It took Steve a second to realise what Tony was getting at. And then his shoulders tensed just slightly, his mind coming into sharper focus as he looked at Tony.
“So… You know, when you asked me, if I knew… in the bunker…” Steve started, his voice a little quieter now… Partly, it was just because he was talking about
...And discovered that it was a sketch of a man's forearm, clearly intended as a medical diagram, with lines pointing to seemingly arbitrary points, and no annotation.
But he’d been dutifully slogging through the details for nearly three weeks now, and the initial novelty had long since worn off. Any vague ideas he’d had about finding some deep, spiritual meaning had been smothered several data tables ago. Besides the ever-dwindling hope that he might yet stumble across something enlightening, Steve couldn’t really claim to care about it.
Mindlessly, he threw the ball again, still with too much force. He quite liked the way it stung his palm to catch it.
“I think that guy maybe takes too much of his own… flowers,” Rhodey grinned, once they were out of earshot.
“One of the basic rules, I’m afraid. Can’t be altered.” Her tone suggested that she’d explained this once already.
By the time Steve had drunk the water that Tony brought for him, and taken the bath that Tony had run for him, and wrapped himself in the blanket that Tony had given him, the sun was already shining brightly in a clear blue sky. Tony had offered to pull the curtains for him, but Steve found that he rather liked looking out at the view - and hadn’t thought any more about it than that. He’d simply been lying in Tony’s lap, gazing out over the hills while Tony played with his hair, for almost an hour now…
“I was thinking – so, you know…there were a lot of things, I, uh, phrased very badly, last night?” Tony went on, a bit more softly – giving his equipment one final glance over before he shuffled back from it, to sit closer “I just… So, I
But before he could even work out why, Tony had glanced away to take a steading breath and put his mask back up. When he looked back at Steve there was a fragile sort of courage in his eyes.
recoiled from any attempt to protect him. He’d learned it well enough that he didn’t have to think about it anymore. He’d walked away from so many relationships for that very reason. It was perhaps
the feeling of it being familiar. He remembered these unnatural impulses being the most natural things in the world…
If he’d been even slightly less sure of Steve’s love for him, Tony might’ve been threatened by that… But as it was…
And, when Steve finally broke, Tony could feel the release of it - a lofty, heady sort of euphoria that swamped him as Steve came inside him.
But it reminded Steve of Clint’s old farm house. Clearly, the Bartons had particular tastes, and even though this place was smaller than their last one, and closer to the city, it still had that
sorry, for some of the things I said when we first met. Even if there are reasons and – whatever, my point is… I do look back and think of telling you that I knew guys worth ten of you, and that you weren’t the guy to make the sacrifice play – and, if nothing else, that’s just really embarrassing.”
...Or he was going to completely forget about the horrible things that Nat had done to someone Steve loved, commit himself to his casual forgiveness, simply because her crimes hadn’t upset
Steve felt all the tension leave his body, the air evaporating in his lungs, every thought in his head stopping dead and disappearing.
It was only as he began to piece the evening together that a queasy sense of dread rose up in him, reaching a tipping point when he actually revisited the memory of punching that man…
What was actually going to happen in three days was that Nick was going to receive an ominous warning to wait for a week…
He learned that there was a vampire family from a little German town that he happened to have visited recently, on a mission… which wasn’t even an interesting coincidence really. Just
“Are we sure that I’m even invited?” And, as expected, Bucky responded by collapsing back against the easy chair and groaning theatrically.
that you can’t cultivate an eco-system on a single day. Doing that will take years, and the co-operation of everyone on Earth.”
. It was far too big an idea to just get started on like that, especially considering the mood he was in.
“You know, I think you two will benefit from being here more than anyone” She decided. And Steve huffed out a dry little laugh,
“It’s okay, I know” Tony cut him off, struggling awkwardly to get out of Steve’s lap. Trying desperately to hide the fact that he still had an aching hard on – although why he was bothering with that, when he was just grinding against him-
“…Mainly, I’m worried about hurting you.” Steve said, oh so carefully, taking as much time as possible over every single word. And Tony actually smiled at him, and told him softly.
“Steve….” Tony breathed, as Steve took his cock in his hand again, rolling his thumb over the head as he flexed his grip against him. And then Steve began stroking over the length of him again, slow and firm, never taking his eyes away from Tony’s…
So, he tilted his head up, and put every ounce of affection, and elation, and admiration into a kiss.
“Pres, come on,” Ty said, motioning the other man forward.  “You’re gonna love it,” Ty said in a placating tone, patting Tony’s shoulders and pushing his hair back from his forehead.  Tony wasn’t sure who Ty was talking to.  He wasn’t sure it mattered.
“You don’t…I mean, we agreed.  With the painting,” Steve said, twisting back to look at the canvas as if it held answers while his mind and certain other parts of his body kept repeating ‘blow you’ on loop.  When he looked up, his eyes caught on Kirk’s mouth for a moment, and when he did finally find Kirk’s gaze on him, it was knowing, heated and sharper than before.
“Nice shot, LeBron,” Tony wheezed,  voice high and tight, so the medicine must be wearing off, Steve thought, though he sounded stronger than he had before, at least to Steve’s ears.
“I guess I’m ready to go when you are,” Steve said.  He was already standing up to go, turning for the balcony doors before Tony could cut off his mental beratement and focus on Steve’s words.
was good. He didn’t let himself feel enough, always held himself back, put on one mask, then another, but the alien saw him.  All of him. The man behind the curtain, Tony thought hazily, though he couldn’t have said where that notion came from, just that it felt right.
“Thanks again, Sam.  I’m sorry to bother you with this…I just…I just couldn’t go back there tonight,” Steve said, sitting down heavily on the sofa and unfolding the blanket.
Wait.  Why didn’t he want it?  And how had the whole conversation gotten turned around so quickly?  He felt a bit like he had whiplash.  One minute, he had been asking Brock to slow down, and the next, he was somehow apologizing.  Why was he apologizing?  Sure, he’d not really timed that well, and he’d be the first to say, he wasn’t the best at these conversations, but… it all felt off.
“Too soon, man, too soon,” Rhodes protested, shaking his head.   “Steve, don’t panic, he’s just teasing.”
“I’m not--he’s not--we broke up.  Well.  I broke up with him.  Broth,” Steve blinked, then let out a shaky laugh.  “
“You two doing the tourist thing today or what?” Rhodey asked, taking a huge bite of panic muffin as he did.  “You should do one of those bus tour things with the little headsets.  I’ll pay.”
“Charming,” Rhodey observed as Tony pulled the Audi into a space a block away that was marked for deliveries to a dry cleaner’s promising suits in by nine would be back by five.
The kiss was wet and sloppy, but the dual sensations of Tony’s mouth and Tony’s body was enough to send Steve over whatever edge he’d been holding to, and he started to thrust in long, slow gliding strokes. Tony’s body rocked in time with the rhythm, losing Steve’s mouth, then finding it again.  Steve finally pushed himself back, settling on his knees between Tony’s thighs, lifting Tony again so he could find the angle Tony liked, then ramming home.  Tony’s hands, which had been reaching for him in protest, clenched into fists, then dove to curl in the blanket as he tossed his head back and forth.  Steve hooked an arm under one of Tony’s knees, and got his other hand around Tony’s cock again.
Okay, but there was nothing special about that day.  Nothing happened.  Nothing that would make Steve suddenly decide to go from asking Tony out to pounding him into next week, not when Steve wasn’t that guy to begin with.  Or Tony, didn’t think he was.  Who the hell knew?  Maybe Steve was fine just getting his rocks off, particularly if he’d been waiting.  Had he been waiting?  What did that even mean? Waiting for what, exactly?  Opportunity?  Not easy to find a discreet outlet for this sort of thing if you were a superhero who maybe didn’t want to become more of a gay icon than the outfit already made him, and yes, Tony could do discreet, if only for shits and grins.
.  He couldn’t bring himself to answer out loud, but Tony wasn’t stupid.  He could clearly see the flash of pain across Steve’s face at Stane’s words.
He huffed out a harsh breath, and let his head dip down to his chest, breathing in and out and letting the constant susurration of the water fill his head and push everything else out.  When he looked in the mirror again, he could see the star on his chest, grayed out now, discolored by the soot and smoke, like it had absorbed part of the destruction.  Maybe it had.
“Guess I don’t have to ask if the rest of your night went well,” Tony bit out, looking him up and down with such derision that Steve almost took a step back. It took a moment for his brain to catch up to the implication, but when it did, he felt a hot spike of anger shoot down his spine and settle in his stomach.  He couldn’t stop the flush creeping up his cheeks, though he wasn’t sure if it was anger or embarrassment at the team thinking that Tony was right or a combination of the two.  Where did Tony get off judging him, even if that had been what he’d been doing last night?  He’d tried to never judge Tony for his lifestyle.  It wasn’t his business, after all.  Or at least, he’d told himself that while he stewed and burned “Eric’s” bacon the next morning.
“He went looking for something he wanted to show Vernon,” Stane replied.  He was leaning one hip against the counter, leaning over the smaller man, with one hand on the man’s shoulder, as if holding him in place.
“Can’t say that I can,” Stane agreed. That was when Steve knew that Stane did, in fact, recognize him, and he hated the man a little more for that, even if it wasn’t entirely fair.  “You did always have a weakness for the uniform, if I recall.”
“You know that on this trajectory, you will soon be out of range of the SI satellites,” JARVIS told him.
“Stable. For now,” Bruce responded carefully, not taking his eyes off Steve, as if saying it out loud could jinx it.  “Everything arranged with the medical team and Dr. Cho?”
He couldn’t see much in the dark, except the silvery slash of rain when lightning flashed and the deeper, shadowy darkness of the mountains beyond where lightning crackled at the peaks in an impressive show.  All of a sudden, he realized his arms and the front of his shirt were soaked, and he made a distressed sound and slammed the shutter closed, wondering just how long he had been standing there, staring out at the storm.
Steve surged up and kissed him, then, half laughing against Tony’s mouth.  “God, you’re impossible,” Steve said as he pulled back, wiping a smile from his lips.  His face fell, brow pulling together. “Tony, you…you messed up. You’ve never hidden that. Not from me, not from anyone.  Yeah, okay, the details…I’m not going to lie, Tony, it’s hard to hear. A part of me wants to just shake you, yeah, but…I know how easy it is to see everything that you missed when you’re looking over your shoulder.  It’s all right there, as clear as day,” he stopped, looking down and away, chewing on his lip. Finally, he looked back at Tony again. “The choices we made over there, sometimes I find myself looking back at them and second-guessing every single step that got me to that point.  And with Gulmira…it would be so easy to blame you. You’d let me. You’d take it, whether it was fair or not, and—God, it’s tempting to let you. Because then it wouldn’t be on me, you know? If you took the blame, then I wouldn’t have to, and that…that would be so easy, Tony. So easy.  But then, I’d have to give up on this. On
The alien shifted around the table and moved between Tony’s outstretched legs.  The not-gel bubbled and rolled, splaying Tony’s legs further apart. The alien was watching Tony.  Not curious like before, but focused. Intense. He made more noises, soft and soothing, almost like chanting.
“I wish I’d gotten a chance to learn more languages.  Wish I understood yours, the way you understand mine,” Steve sighed, mouth flattening.  “It’s different, that’s for sure, your language. But some languages are like that, aren’t they?  Different. I know you’re saying stuff, I just don’t have the faintest idea what. It’s nice, though, all your sounds.  I’ve got some of them down, I think, like when you’re happy, which is sort of a high-pitched hum that kind of has a vibration to it.  Or when I’m doing something wrong on the
Sure, he would miss it.  Who wouldn’t?  The warm, wet drag of Cap sliding into him, hand splayed wide over his lower back, almost a caress, the way he lost his breath and kept stuttering out Tony’s name as his thrusts became more and more erratic, how he’d always run a hand down Tony’s neck, fingers carding through the damp curls there, so gently Tony almost couldn’t feel it…well, Tony would have to be dead not to miss that.  Literal God-damn fantasy come to life, after all.  So, sure, he was disappointed, if not surprised, when Cap called it off.  They were adults, in addition to being Avengers, and just because whatever this was hadn’t lasted, well, that hardly meant he was going to let whatever minute pang of regret he might have felt get in the way of doing their jobs.
It went on like that until they reached the bottom of the stairs, where Lord Rand waited next to his son and some of the other visiting nobles.  At least Cam’s chatter provided a welcome distraction from the way the gold chains shifted over his body as they walked down the steps, Steve thought with a grimace. There were a number of new faces, Steve noticed, who must have arrived just for the tourney.  Their party followed Lord Rand and his son to the large box in front of the tourney field where a high-backed wooden chair with a cushioned seat and crest mounted above it waited for Tony. Next to it, a tufted ottoman was clearly meant for Steve, so after Tony and the Lords Rand sat, he sank down onto it and spread his robes around him.
“Now,” Tony said, holding out a long strip of red silk embroidered with gold threads.  He held it in front of Steve until Steve gave a small nod, then placed it gently over Steve’s eyes and tied it behind his head.  “You need not do anything.  You need not think, or speak, or see, only feel.  Only me, and this, that is all that matters for tonight.  You will be good for me, and I will take care of you.”
“Um…hey, well, uh…David, this is Tony.  Tony Stark.  You probably know him as Iron Man, one of the Avengers.  Tony, this is David Sterling.  He owns an art gallery in Soho and was just telling me about an exhibit he’s working on involving photographs taken by soldiers on the front lines of various wars that sounds fascinating,” Steve said by way of introductions.  Tony face tensed, almost imperceptibly, but Steve was hyper-aware enough of Tony to take notice.
Steve was trying to be reassuring, which was very sweet. Tony doubted he’d feel better about anything until Camp was a good six hours into an erection that wasn’t supposed to last more than four, but he sat down on the bed anyway and took his helmet off because Steve had asked him to and the idea of being able to actually look at Steve with his own eyes was too tempting, even as he looked up the dosage to weight instructions for Propofol.
“I keep telling him that he’s lucky she likes tiny things,” Tony shrugged.  “For some reason, he seems to get slightly peeved with me over that.”
“Thanks, Buck,” Steve said quickly, deciding for now to ignore Bucky’s jibes, if for no other reason than he really didn’t know what to say in response.
“I wish you luck, then, Master Zola.  I’m afraid you will need it with this one,” Sitwell commented with a slight sneer.
No more scars.  It would heal what was wrong inside first. Knit bone and tissue and sinew.  Stave off infection and inflammation.  The serum fixed everything.  It would fix the scrapes on his knuckles and the bruises on his chest.  Make him whole again.  That’s what it did, over and over, never stopping, an endless line of putting him back together again.  That should be comforting.  He wasn’t sure when it starting sounding slightly terrifying.
“Safe to say, astronauts and low gravity have nothing on you,” Tony grinned, flipping up the faceplate as he landed next to his telescope.
“He’s going to chase off dinner,” Steve warned, though he didn’t actually sound particularly worried.
A small, balding man with a squished, pallid face rushed out.  He wore flowing red robes held at the shoulder with a large gold pin in the shape of the same flower that graced the doors came out to greet the Lord as he stepped out of his carriage.
“Ask Cam, if you must,” Steve interrupted sharply.  “He will answer your questions truthfully.  Ask about how they brought him a white wrap to wear.  Ask about how Zola didn’t have the overseer prepare him as he did me, because that was how Stane wanted him.  Ask the other boys who are still at the compound, if Zola hasn’t already gotten rid of all of them.  Ask the other children who hide there, trying to go unnoticed, what it is they do for Zola!” Steve finished, his voice raising to nearly a shout.  At Tony’s fathomless expression, Steve stopped.
“I’m going to hit the gym,” Bucky announced, pushing himself off the sofa.  “When do you two leave for dinner?”
“Beautiful,” the King murmured, then seemed to catch himself. Steve’s stomach swooped and his breath caught as the King held his gaze. Suddenly, the King’s fingers were gone from Steve’s chin and he was turning towards Zola.  “But, unless he happens to maximize the height this counterweight can all without the whole damn thing completely coming apart with the recoil, then I have little use for him.  Take him to Stern or one of your other favorite customers. They’ll thank you handsomely for it, no doubt.  Go,” the King ordered, pointing a hand in the direction of the door.
They spent the night at some lesser lord’s keep, which he and his family had vacated to make room for the King and his entourage.  Tony worked late into the night, only coming to bed when the fire had all but gone out sometime in the moonlit hours long after Steve had fallen into slumber.  He woke long enough to roll over and wrap himself around Tony’s warmth, then fell back into a dreamless sleep.
“Like that?” Tony asked, his voice teasing and all too knowing. “You’re gonna love this,” he promised.
The range of items so casually displayed in store windows, and the shameless claims spelled out beneath them…
He just looked so much like all of the things that Steve loved about him – that spark of genius, that childlike playfulness, that irrepressible spirit… all in that one beautiful smile.
And that was especially inappropriate now, because something far more important than that was happening… but, God, if
Really, Steve already knew that he would have to think about all of this at some point… But the very idea of opening that wound, and all the things that might come spilling out of it, and how messy it would be, and how much it could possibly cost him-
Steve recognised all of this. It all came together to form one of many reactions that he was used to having around Tony…
An excited murmur broke out in the room, which added to the creeping feeling gathering on Steve’s skin. He knew the showcase thing rang a bell… But every time he tried to go back to that foggy memory, he could only find the spike of panic and the words ‘truth serum’ - apparently, his reaction to that detail had been strong enough to blot everything else out-
before he could take Steve’s opinion into consideration. Before it would be fair to ask Steve what he wanted.
And then he felt Steve’s fingertip, now wet with lube, press firm against his hole and push inside him - and everything sharpened again.
“Well, yes, there’s that,” Tony laughed, shyly. “And… I… I was going to talk to you about something, is all…”
Steve felt his stomach drop as he watched Tony slide his phone back into his pocket, his entire body tensing as he waited for Tony to look at him.
When he was finished changing, Tony felt as though he was wearing chainmail armour - and looked like a stage concept that Elton John would’ve considered ‘a bit much’.
This was the conversational equivalent of dangling your keys in front of a toddler while you tried to deal with a grown-up task.
Steve had by now accepted that he had a full blown crush on Tony Stark. Obviously he did, he knew he did, it would be ludicrous to deny that he did…
that cloud of animal lust growing denser, the connection between his head and his body becoming shorter and more impulsive. He parted Steve’s legs, dropping to kiss and bite the inside of his thighs, his hand running roughly over the outline of Steve’s cock, now pressed hard and wet to the fabric of his underwear
“No, actually,” Steve conceded, with a weary sigh. “As a matter of fact, I have a whole timelines worth of experience of them doing that to
They were both thinking the same thing. That there was no option to go back to the room and think about this, no way they could carry on covertly gathering intel, no chance their cover wouldn’t be blown in a few hours, one way or the other. Now, they had one simple choice. Decide to intervene themselves – or get out of the situation, and hand it over.
By the time he’d finished, Tony’s ears were ringing. Steve was looking back at him in abject shock – but, in complete fairness to him,
dangers to any of the drugs we offer. We’ve done extensive testing for that, and all of these people are exactly the same, physiologically, as they were when they joined us. But, of course, there are other considerations. People who have been
Suddenly Tony was thrusting into him in a deep, brutal rhythm, his hands pinning Steve under him, his breathing growling roughly from the bottom of his chest.
it. More than any serum induced arousal had ever triggered in him… or just entirely different to, maybe.
And just as he said it, the song hit the chorus – someone yelling that they were not okay, over and over. Steve threw Bucky a sharp glare.
They were going to Maribelle’s party tonight because they’d decided it made sense to do that first. Because it made sense to gather as much information as possible before they gave up their vantage point– that was the point of being undercover, after all.
Recognising that it was irrational hadn’t made it go away. Acknowledging where it came from hadn’t made it go away.
“Trouble sleeping?” Nick enquired wryly, casting a knowing eye over Steve’s tensed muscles. Steve huffed a little breath of acknowledgement, and stepped back - but didn’t loosen his shoulders. Out of spite.
. It was beyond beautiful. Steve felt such a sense of peace when he looked at him, such a pure, unlimited happiness…
As expected, he’d fidgeted out of his seat again before he’d even finished with the introduction, leaving Steve perched attentively on the edge of the couch, watching Tony give his presentation.
Steve realised there was no way he’d be able to work out exactly who ‘Talleroy Communications’ were, or what they were planning, from the clues in this dingy basement – but it didn’t matter. It was obvious that they weren’t allies, that their purposes weren’t legitimate… that, whatever the specifics, he and Bucky were better off
Well, he was supposed to carry on walking past the windows. But apparently the sun had set since he last hit this checkpoint, meaning the glass was dark enough for him to catch his reflection - and that was enough to stop him in his tracks.
Steve began kissing his way back down along Tony’s chest, quicker and messier and more urgently than before. He heard Tony whine softly when he had to move his hand, so that he could tug Tony’s clothes down over his legs, undressing him as he was still kissing his stomach. And then Steve lifted his head…
remember that feeling. He felt as though he might be able to find words for it, if he gave it some thought…
daydreaming about Steve’s chest, wanting so much just to be pressed against it like this, to be able to indulge in the power of him, the perfect form of him, the softness of his skin…
And that was one of the places his thinking kept threatening to derail. Those sharp turns and sudden stops, where he could so easily have just skipped into thinking something completely new…
to drink – even if he’d completely forgotten his hunger. It wasn’t about his own physical needs anymore.
that your bosses are actually doing all this to test me, to unnerve me - believe me, we’re well past that too. So, do you want to just call whoever it is that you’re going to call,” and he gestured to the device, to indicate that he’d noticed it, “and I can tell them directly why I’ll be leaving now.”
“Well, I was,” Tony answered honestly. “But then I nearly set the house on fire again, so I’m taking a break.”
Whatever the answer to either of those questions – Tony already knew that the Steve he’d been mad at didn’t really exist.
And, now, Steve realised that something about his voice, and his shape, was familiar… Jimmie, Jesse, Jamie…something like that – the ‘marketing guy’ from Talleroy Communications.
But, as he couldn’t rely on that, Steve also threw a punch to where he’d guessed Adam’s face would now be – feeling the crack of his temple at the edge of his knuckles, not quite a direct hit. There was a hot, wet spray – blood, or spit as Adam hissed another profanity, Steve couldn’t tell.
And Steve didn’t even have chance to lose his breath before Tony had engulfed him completely, taking him right to the back of his throat.
To Sam and Wanda, it was still 2019. That was the shared experience of half the world now - if that half put their foot down and insisted that it
Remembering Rhodey’s off hand comment about Zan making friends with Nebula… hoping it was true, actually…
And he dropped his eyes for a second, almost shyly. When he looked up again there was a hint of sadness there.
“Yeah, I probably should…” Steve agreed – already knowing there was literally no chance of that. Actually, he was just trying to get out of this phone call before he blew it. “But, I’ll call you, okay?”
It was going to mean facing up to the fact that he’d been hiding in a workshop for twenty years. It was going to mean confronting all the things he’d been hiding
By now his skin was numb from the cold of the water, his jaw clenched painfully against shivering – and, as Steve’s cock was still pressed hard against his stomach and his hips ached with the effort of ignoring it, he figured it wasn’t working anyway. He turned the hot tap, and focussed on the feeling of the water slowly warming up, the relief of it sinking into his muscles.
But if Steve came over now, and found Tony just as he was… then it really would have happened. Whatever Tony said or thought or did, that really would be him. He felt like, when he thought back to this later, it would still look the same…
“There’s always a situation happening somewhere,” Nick breezed, confidently walking over to where Steve was standing.
Steve raised his eyebrows questioningly, shifting slightly under the weight of the silence… and Tony let go of a defeated sigh. Loathed though he was to admit it, he
He could imagine letting his fingers trail over Steve’s stomach… sliding his hands under the waistband of Steve’s jeans, touching Steve the way he was touching himself, feeling Steve’s hips roll to meet him like this
the ways that he liked Tony - that, underneath the unnatural, impossible draw that he was trying to explain, there was also the perfectly human crush he had on Tony… And the increasingly important friendship…
him, and it wasn’t that Tony thought Steve was lying, and it wasn’t even that Tony thought he was fundamentally unloveable – it wasn’t about any of that.
Steve went between glancing over the balcony, and glancing at Tony, as he booted up the system and began trying command after command to get a response. And then his eyes lit up.
that Tony had said yes, feeling giddy at the thought of actually getting to do this… accepting this reaction, as if it was the most normal thing in the world…
have been a total ass since you got here,” Tony repeated, squaring his shoulders. “I have picked at you, and I’ve wound you up, and I’ve never given enough thought to any of the things that I know you’ve been through –
Big towers, especially those outside of cities, were built and run by the people who built and ran everything…
“I love you” Tony answered, his voice almost slurring… And then Steve felt him melt into sleep right there in his arms.
Steve screamed, as a searing pleasure crashed up along his back, shattering through his hips, crawling up through to his shoulders and down into his calves. And he would’ve carried on screaming, except that Tony immediately slammed into him again, and again, setting a deep, brutal rhythm that knocked the air out of his lungs.
been on the same drugs that Tony was… And, actually thinking about it like this, Steve wasn’t sure he had any more responsibility in that situation than Tony had. He wasn’t sure he’d taken advantage any more than he’d been taken advantage of – and he was quite sure he’d not been taken advantage of. He knew immediately that
, I’m pretty sure, is the Varian chemical it’s derived from. And… I think… No, I’m sure, this is a Varian truth serum.” He pointed at it, more animatedly now. “Or at least something that’ll work that way, if we need it to. I just think… It has a lot of similarities to the chemical formula we use…
. His lips still damp and parted, and almost pouting they were so full. His skin flushed across his cheekbones, his hair mussed up and matted against his forehead…
And then he remembered the other thing he wanted to balance. And, now, he felt more sure of it than he ever had. Almost excited to say it, thinking that maybe he could achieve that same rightness in an even more fundamental way.
By the time he recognised himself he was just too many tears in, his breathing already hitching under the weight of it, the pressure already past the tipping point-
know what was going on - the man he was in love with had said he didn’t want a serious relationship, and Steve had been so desperate for any sort of relationship that he’d agreed to it. Championed for it, in fact.
Steve. That was a… thing. A specific hurt that Steve harboured. A reason he liked Tony so much. Something.
about to do a quick scan of the room, and think about how to get out of there safely, and consider all the things he might find when he did-
. One hand grabbed at Tony’s hair, the other hand balling Tony’s shirt into a fist, exposing the skin at the small of his back. His cock pulsed sharply as Tony moaned.
So, at the opportune moment, they made their way through the crowd, subtly parting ways when they were about a hundred feet from Maribelle, so that Tony could casually circle round behind her.
After a hundred pages or so, Steve was so deeply calmed by what he’d read that he started to daydream again. This thing that had once held such power over him was reduced to a mild distraction for him to run his eyes over, while he mused about other things…
“So, tell me – how do you really feel about Steve?” She went on, in the same casual, conversational tone… So Tony just…
Steve followed unthinkingly, still too stunned to think in sentences. When he turned to face the Red Skull...Johann Scmitt… The Stonekeeper...again, all of his vast existential question and incredulous observations came out as,
“Part of it I have to do on my own,” Tony corrected, gently. “Part of it is literally that… I can’t twist what I am, what any of this means,
, in and of itself, and something it would be unfair to do to someone, except under specific circumstances…” He mused… Settling into this conversation in a strangely comfortable way…. “I mean, if we think about this and decide it’s just flat out
when he was 21? Did it even matter, seeing as he was never going to be seen in any outfit ever again?
So, his horrible burn already completely forgotten, Tony poured himself a cup of coffee and went to sit on the couch. As he walked, he looked around at the chaos in his workshop – fragments from ten different armoured suits, in various stages of completion, arranged on every available surface.
Tony was sure, if he was an outsider watching this scene, he wouldn’t like himself. He knew he was being bitter, and childish – he even felt a pang of sympathy, once or twice, when Steve made some earnest observation about the food or asked a desperate question about Tony’s energy research. The way he absorbed Tony’s cool, closed off responses like physical blows, immediately steeling himself to do it again…
any super soldiers, now. And, when it first happened, Steve had realised all of that, and he’d felt terrible about all of it, and he’d tried to accept the consequences of it…
He has no idea what any of those details are, and he doesn’t think to look for them - but he is aware that they must exist.
Bucky looked up, and waved at him - and Tony wasn’t sure if he’d ever been as happy to see anyone in his life.
need to feel like they’re doing something. That’s what stops them feeling helpless. That’s what stops them sitting up all night thinking about it. That’s what saves them from torturing themselves when something does happen to you – because then they can at least tell themselves they did what they could.”
Both he and Steve had spent the first two hours of their shift patrolling the warehouse, like they were supposed to. Growing increasingly bored as they walked up and down between rows and rows of refrigerators, occasionally checking the entrance and the secure doors through to the rest of the facility… But even that level of enthusiasm wore off after a while. Now, Gary was also reclining against the wall by the main door, looking every bit as disinterested as Steve was pretending to be.
“You too, Erik,” he said, sincerely. And then, with only the slightest pang of residual guilt, added, “good luck with the project.” Selvig nodded and gave a little wave as he followed the last of the staff out of the lab.
And Tony remembered the spirit of what he wanted to ask him, even if he couldn’t quite find the words yet… He felt pretty confident of what he wanted to say, as he gestured for Steve’s attention, and took a step closer…
He felt a sudden plunge in his stomach and recognised immediately that it wasn’t a reaction to the text – at least not directly. This was something he would have felt anyway. This feeling was the reason he’d known to listen for that text in the first place…
This hadn’t even been on his list of regrets, before tonight… But it seemed quite obvious now. He could apologise for
to you - I mean, I’ve only known you a few weeks, and they’ve not exactly been typical weeks… And I think that’s one of the things that was making me hesitate, if I’m honest.”
“Ha, I don’t think I’ve ever eaten this sitting down,” Steve reassured him, nervously handing him his meal.
” Tony whined, trying to keep it together, “look, I really don’t care how big it is - I only care what it
uncomfortable to be around… Well, maybe that was to be expected, under the circumstances. And as Steve didn’t really know the circumstances, he should know better than to judge. That it was unreasonable –
“Did your research, huh?  Had to.  The suit,” Steve confirmed.  “I’d had something of a growth spurt. Nothing fit, not even one of Bucky’s.  He accused me of shooting myself up with growth hormones or something,” Steve remembered with a shake of his head.  “Kept making jokes about it.  I think he was trying to distract me or piss me off, something.  Get a reaction, I guess.  I wasn’t—it was hard.  It had been me and mom for so long, and even after her diagnosis, I don’t know.  I guess it didn’t seem real until it was over.”
Tony nodded, then shifted in his seat, straightening himself.  “I’ll see that it’s arranged. What?” he said at Steve’s shocked expression. “A recommendation from you is enough for me. You might be surprised at what I am willing to do at your request.”
“Language,” Clint called out from the cockpit, then scrunched up his face.  “Sorry.  Felt it had to be said.”
Shellhead snorted with an air of disapproval, then frowned and glanced over at Steve, his face softening.  Steve wasn’t sure if Shellhead was disagreeing with Peggy’s assessment or just showing solidarity, but Steve appreciated it, nonetheless.
“I don’t…I’m sorry, I don’t…what is the comparison?  A stone and a beetle?” Steve asked, leaning forwards so his forearms were against the edge of the table.  “Is it…they’re both round?”
“Yes, Your Highness. Thank you!” Cam nearly shouted in his excitement at the praise.  “Everyone loved him, did they not?”
It was apparently bath first, Steve quickly realized as they stopped in a large chamber filled with attendants washing various men and women while they stood in gleaming metal tubs.  The room smelled almost sickly sweet from the perfumed soap.  He was stripped again, then moved into one of the tubs.  Awkward, since they left the chains on his hands and feet. Two attendants leapt forward with brushes and sponges to clean him from toe to head.  The water was cold, but it wasn’t as if he could complain.  They fed him.  Not much, but enough to staunch the gnawing in his stomach.
“Yeah.  Yeah, I did,” Tony replied quietly, coming to a halt beside where Steve stood rigid.  “Sat in a car in the hospital parking lot, getting updates from some General who likes to take the yacht out when he’s stateside.  I—I should’ve come inside.  It was a chicken-shit thing to do, sitting out there like that,” Tony rushed out, watching Steve’s face for any guidepost of where he should take this conversation.  Off-ramp, please, Tony thought to himself.  “I don’t know—I heard about your—the accident, and I just got on the plane.  I don’t know what I was thinking.  I just…I had to be there.”
So, he drew. Haltingly at first, then feverishly, the pencil flying across the paper, almost like it wasn’t even really his own effort, but something possessing his hand as it moved over the page. For the first time in a long time, he drew something real.  Not the things screaming in his head from while he was away that had found a way in.  A crack.
That was what it was that was bothering him, Steve realized.  He didn’t want last night to be a punchline to Brock or some salacious bit of gossip, but he also wanted Brock to, well… to
Steve wrapped his lips around the shaft and sucked lightly, using his tongue to circle the head and lap at the slit there, the way he knew by now that Tony liked.  Tony pulled back, then slowly pushed in again, repeating the motion until Steve felt his throat slacken and relax.  His lips were sloppy and wet, leaving a trail of saliva catching on Tony’s cock like a spider’s web, dribbling down his chin as he sucked against the steady, shallow thrusts.  Metal and musk smells mingled, filling his nose, as Tony pushed deeper into Steve’s mouth with a low groan that went all the way down to the tip of Steve’s cock.  Steve continued to suck and work his tongue around Tony’s cock, even as a gasping choked-off breath was punched out of him as Tony thrust deeper, hitting the back of his throat before pulling almost all the way out again.
“You’re going to be fine. It’s going to be fine,” Tony insisted, glancing over at Bucky, who just shook his head and sighed.  “Let me do the talking, like we practiced,” he implored. “Pepper and Matt aren’t going to let this thing go off the rails. A press conference is far more scripted than you might think.  Though, I guess now you have an idea,” Tony added, nodding down at the cards in Steve’s hand. “Just remember, trick of the trade, you don’t have to actually answer what they ask. Floor’s yours after they ask the question, so you get to say what you want,” he assured Steve with a practiced calm.  “It’ll be fine. You’ll see. You’ll barely have to do anything. It’ll be over and done before you know it.” He paused and tilted his head, eyeing Steve, his face softening from the too-bright, pinched look it had before.
Falling into a relationship certainly hadn’t really been on Steve’s mind when he saw Brock again. Mostly it had just been nice to be around someone who understood him without needing long-winded explanations that Steve wasn’t ready to give. Then, somehow, they just sort of drifted together, and Steve...didn’t have to be alone all the time, which was nice.  Having someone.  Not that he didn’t sometimes still get lonely or wish things were maybe a little different, but who didn’t? Everyone felt that way sometimes, even if they were in a relationship. Grass is always greener on the other side, right? That was probably why so many failed, because people jumped ship as soon as it wasn’t everything they hoped it would be.
“I trusted him. Obie,” Tony said again, shaking his head, his voice thick and wet.  He could feel his eyes stinging, his body held taut, waiting on some word from Steve one way or the other.    “I thought…I thought he was a good man.”
“You should get some sleep,” Steve suggested.  He lay down himself, though sleep didn’t come easily.  His thoughts were too muddled, swirling around and smashing together like waves on rocks.  He looked over at Cam, snoring softly where he curled on his pallet.  At least, Steve thought, he had done something good in this God-forsaken place.   For however long it lasted.  That was the question though, wasn’t it?  How long would this reprieve stand?  Did the King really not realize Lord Stane’s depravity or was he only looking the other way to avoid a scandal?  Or did he simply not care?  They were only slaves, after all, and what king bothered with their fates unless it directly affected him?  The King hadn’t been concerned with Steve, after all, except that he hadn’t been available when he wanted him.
Tony sighed, stuck the picture in its place, and put the book back in the nightstand drawer.  He hugged the pillow to his face and drew in a deep breath.  Soap.  The green marbled kind that Steve thought might have been a joke. A hint of musk and
“You’ll hate this. This…this life with him.  You’ll hate it,” Tony said flatly.  “He won’t make you happy.  He won’t know how, even if he cared to.  Which, he doesn’t, by the way.”
Oh, good Lord, I’m going to have to take both of them, Tony thought with a heavy sigh.  A matched set of self-sacrificing, co-dependent, stubborn-as-fuck, honest-to-God good guy-heroes who bickered like a couple of fishwives.  Actually, the prospect wasn’t nearly as daunting as it had seemed a few days ago.  He shook his head and watched the two of them glare at each other until Barnes finally relented.
And then he felt Tony’s hand cup the side of his face, tilting his chin up just slightly. So, of course, Steve made himself focus,
“I hope this one wasn’t too much effort to track down…” He mumbled, as his mind provided and then rebelled against the translation,
understood, here. The anxieties and emotional responses you take for granted would sound quite strange, even frightening, to most people in this galaxy… I understand that, to you, any substance with calming effects would actually be considered
wanted Steve to say something and make it all better – so much so that he was terrified of giving him the chance.
Tony's shame at letting Obie stay after the attack happened, and the fact that he didn't immediately lose all familial feelings towards him.
“So, he said it might make us feel uncomfortable, and – well, moody, basically.” Tony began. And then paused, ominously. “And it might make us more – well, his exact words were relaxed, open and
And, this actually being the first available opportunity, of course Tony’s mind went right back to the night before.
It was late afternoon by the time Steve had finished with his various photo ops and ‘networking meetings’ in DC. The adrenaline had gathered at an increasing rate as the itinerary dragged on, until his skin tingled, and his shoulders began to ache… Although, he had to admit, it was far more manageable than it had been.
a sharp clench of anxiety, and an ordinary, everyday pang of hope, simply because Tony knew that he was putting himself out there with that statement-
And, oh, it hit differently now, watching Steve writhe gently against the sheets. Steve was less guarded now, more vulnerable, more honest in his reactions. For a moment Tony just watched, mesmerised, as Steve parted his lips in sincere, simple pleasure.
Steve’s face lit up with the most beautiful smile. Tony felt a sharp tingling in his pit of his stomach, a feeling that was so foreign and so familiar all at once. He remembered this attraction. This simple, immediate reaction to Steve, this physical appreciation of this perfect, pretty form… It had been obscured by anger and hurt and doubt for so long that Tony had become accustomed to an entirely different version of it, a confusing, complicated, shameful copy of it, almost forgetting how it used to be…
“Okay, so your room is just along here” Dev gestured to one of the corridors. “Tony is already waiting for you.”
Steve wasn’t sure if Tony had even blinked in all the time that he was talking. His face was still frozen in that expression of blank disbelief… his lips soft and slightly parted… his eyes wide and shining…
The idea of using terms that Tony would find offensive, or giving an impression that Tony would think false, or saying anything that Tony wouldn’t like – about this, of all things – filled Steve with a sense of dread.
And Tony didn’t know what it was, exactly. How Steve could suddenly look so different, and still look so much like
issues, a few months ago, when the Maximoffs first joined the Avengers. Arguments between politicians, about whether they had committed a crime by volunteering for Strucker’s experiments, and if they were suitable to be Avengers, and whether the government should get a say in that anyway. But, as far as Tony knew, most of that had finally been ironed out. The meeting today should really have been a box ticking exercise…
“Well, I’d like to think we’ve stopped the whole thing from happening,” Steve sighed, relaxing into his chair. “But, I don’t know - it seemed far too interwoven into a universal plan, to just go away… But it’s okay,” he reached over and placed a reassuring hand on Tony’s knee, “we didn’t have a warning the first time, either - and we beat him then. We’re better prepared now than we’ve ever been. Whenever he comes, and whatever he comes at us with, we’ll deal with it.”
And when he first stepped out of that container, feeling like he was walking on stilts and not knowing where his limbs ended and worried he might be dying because it felt so strange to
“It may be that you feel a little unsettled, for a few moments at a time. You may feel a bit more emotional, for short periods.” Dev conceded. “Or, that you’re aware of a lack of inhibition – you may find yourself feeling more relaxed, more open, you may find yourself talking more, or speaking more quickly… All of which is perfectly normal, and will pass.”
Steve’s body thrummed with it, the conflicting urges sparking against one another, barely contained inside him. There was an edge of controlled panic, a hypothetical disbelief that this could really go on… And a complete and total confidence that it would all be okay. Like being a kid in the audience of an illusionist’s show, free to enjoy this incredible sense of danger because he
Steve just nodded, miserably, forcing himself to at least look in their general direction as they left the room. As soon as they disappeared from view, he heard Sam pipe up,
the finishing line. A tremor of aftershocks ran though him, his muscles tightening and releasing erratically, his breath catching in his throat. And Tony just held Steve firm against him, supporting all of his weight by now, as it ran its course. Until at last every part of Steve had been broken down, until every last drop of tension had been dragged out of him, and he just fell loose and heavy into Tony’s hands.
And it was only when he got to visualising what was about to happen that Steve finally recognised that the bed had a slatted, wrought iron headboard - in a completely different style to the rest of the furniture in the house… But perfect for
Steve and Tony both snapped to attention, turning to face the man who was watching them from just a few feet away. A tall man with a round, kindly face and a solid body, dark olive skin and eyes that looked worn rather than wrinkled… It was impossible to guess how old this man was, or where he was from, or even what level of strength he might have been concealing, under his lab coat.
“Same,” Tony grinned, before he’d even thought about it. “I’ve built maybe ten armoured body suits, and nearly burned the house down at least a hundred times.”
talk, one day, without either of them having to consider the future working relationship, or the knock-on effects for anyone else…
“I think I’ve seen your lover, in one of the ground floor rooms.” She nodded – and Tony winced so hard it hurt his eyeballs.
And then he felt Bucky’s hands caress roughly over his hips, pulling Steve into him again, and again, setting that deep, pounding rhythm that
“I just – I’m just going to say it: There is an awful lot of sex going on here, in the weirdest of places” Tony went on, giggling himself now, mostly at how much Steve was laughing “And I know we’ve done the shifty eyes ‘you know what might happen’ thing, but I just thought, at some point, one of us should just point out that we’re at an orgy, and that is weird.” And because Steve was laughing too hard to answer him, and because Tony just wanted to keep on making him laugh, he tried to keep talking “And at some point we’re going to have to write a
He still wouldn’t have mentioned his father to Steve, even though they were both aware of the connection.
Tony’s hastily calculated – and created – route through the building had proven pretty effective. He’d made it down the first flight of stairs in a few seconds flat, and without encountering a single staff member.
Somewhere in amongst all this he had the vague impression they’d walked along several corridors… and through a few rooms he didn’t remember…
He remembered the morning that he and Tony had set off for The Facility. That feeling that they hadn’t really talked this plan through, because of all the other things they couldn’t talk about first. The faint, unplaceable itch of all the things they’d half said. The nagging concern that they’d both been swept into it on a rush of awkwardness and making-do.
And the man they were guarding was more openly unnerved than a Hydra boss or a black-market weapon dealer would’ve been – so, either this was a small-scale operation in big scale trouble, or this was a lower-management guy.
Except that now he wasn’t sure he even wanted to bother with the ‘toasting’ part. He knew from experience that alcohol never improved a mood like this. And anyway, it wasn’t as though he had much to toast – in the outgoing year, or the upcoming one.
Jan Nowak was a SHIELD agent who had met and immediately fallen for the girl of his dreams at a family party – when she had already been diagnosed with terminal cancer. And he had dated her, and proposed to her, and married her, and buried her, all within the space of two years.
mistakes – didn’t make what Steve did right. It didn’t mean that Steve didn’t have to apologise, or that Tony couldn’t expect Steve to feel bad for what he’d done…
“Steve,” Tony whispered – or tried to. And then Steve smiled, and gathered Tony up against his chest, so that he could lie down on the couch with Tony cradled against him. Tony melted against him immediately, feeling as though he could carry on falling into him, like he could drown in the warmth of Steve’s skin.
Tony swallowed, greedily, desperate for the taste of him – that euphoria blooming up in him again, momentarily overwhelming the hunger…
“Yeah, I’m fine,” he managed. “Just… Um, well, drunk, I think… and maybe still high, I don’t even know… The flower show was also a bad idea, as it turns out…”
Tony gave his palm an amazed little smile, and then glanced back to the Bunsen burner, still roaring nonchalantly in the middle of the desk. With his uninjured hand, he reached over and turned the gas off, and then gathered up the fragments of whatever it was he’d been working on – unrecognisable, now that he’d angrily thrown it across the floor. Then he cast a final glance over the various pieces of body armour that he had laid out on his workstation, and decided it was probably a good time for a little break.
“Look, Steve,” Bucky began on a sharp intake of breath. “I’m not saying that I understand everything that’s going on with you – but, you know what, I don’t understand a lot of what happens, these days. I don’t understand what the hell Bruce is. I don’t understand most of Asguardian culture. I don’t really understand how I’m still alive, seventy years after falling one hundred feet from a moving train. And, honestly, I don’t really understand how any of us make a relationship work – I don’t really understand how anyone makes a relationship work. I just kind of hope that they do. Like I still don’t understand how this works,” he gestured to his metal arm, “I just hope that it
Because as much as it would hurt to relive that security tape over and over for the next few weeks - as much it would test him, to live each day knowing that Bucky was still going through that - Steve
“Can I help?” He whispered, eventually. And Tony sighed another smile, and brought his hand up to the side of Steve’s face, tracing his thumb gently over Steve’s jaw as he answered.
It wasn’t quite enough to wash the smile from Steve’s face… but the utter bliss of getting everything he’d ever wanted hadn’t been enough to drown it out, either. Not completely.
to be that. And I know it sounds so… entitled or whiney or… but I never wanted it to be that, I’ve never wanted that. I wish I could’ve been unsure, that I could’ve
Steve is there the next time Bucky wakes up, and, at first, Bucky recognises him as the voice he so often wakes up to.
But, of course, he knew the situations were entirely different, even if the narrative parallel was somewhat amusing.
about it, that he was picturing it all with a sense of longing rather than flinching away from an awful thought. He
“Fuck…” Steve breathed, letting his head fall back again, as the heat of Tony’s mouth melted against the shock of cold on his skin, little tingles running down through his legs. The pressure in his hips began to ache, his cock burning against the cool evening air as Tony worked his way lower – too far gone to be as gradual and teasing as Steve had been. He lapped greedily over Steve’s stomach, his tongue rough and demanding, his hands pressing hard against Steve’s thighs. “
bad calls, in retrospect… I know they don’t make you reckless, in general, or mean you have bad judgement, or that you weren’t really trying to think of everything. Or, I should’ve known it, because I’ve been caught out on plenty of missions, when I really
Tony’s lips parted, his eyes widening in amazement… And then he blinked, and shook his head, and frowned again.
In fact, after a few stilted comments about the weather, things actually began to move quite fluidly. Tony heard himself telling Bucky where to sit and Steve where to stand, without panicking over every individual word. He wasn’t thinking a thousand different things, when he was gathering his tools and arranging his workspace. This part of things felt natural to him… and somehow, having other people here didn’t make it all completely different. Not this time.
Because he would really have liked a moment with all the issues that question raised, before he even thought about answering it.
It helped that it was so remote. The GPS had given ‘Stykkishólmur’ as the entire address, because the house itself was miles from any named road or landmark. It wasn’t in any ‘area’, beyond the broad region of Iceland. The nearest town was over ten miles away.
...And Steve had just worked out that he was in love with Tony Stark, who was still lying in bed with him, and it just seemed so much easier to think about that-
Thinking about it, maybe it was because it came from that same instinct to protect Steve above all else. The way Tony understood, so naturally accepted, that the objective best outcome was the one in which Steve suffered the least. That there was no compromising on that one, no way to accept some pain or sacrifice on Steve’s behalf in pursuit of a greater victory… what greater victory?
answer. He was simply looking for something he could say quickly, something that would placate Rhodey while Tony finished making his plans-
“So, just to summarise.” Steve exhaled, wearily “We have a family of potentially evil aliens, with one potentially less evil member, who enslaved another group of aliens, with the help of some other probably-not-evil-but-certainly-complicit aliens. They partnered up with a coloniser named Adam, who might have been evil, or might’ve just been cold hearted, but who is probably now mentally ill. He has hired some probably-not-evil-but-certainly-complicit pharmacists, who think they’re working on a capitalist plan, but who are actually working on what is probably an evil plan, written by a mentally ill person who thinks it’s a good plan –
“Or, I don’t know, maybe they want one of us to do something for them, or build something for them… Tell them something we otherwise wouldn’t, I don’t know,” Tony stammered on, hoping to create some conversational distance. “I’m just saying, being here seems to make us all a lot more… suggestable, so, maybe they brought us here to suggest something to us….”
Instantly, a thousand other videos started playing in his head, one on top of the other, a montage of all the most awful things that Steve could imagine happening to a person.
“You’ve got a…” He muttered gently, gesturing to her cheek – before reaching forward as though to brush a hair from her face. She didn’t even think to move away, before she was overcome by the sedative.
had a chance to evaluate his tendency to take the world’s problems on as his own. To acknowledge that his fear of doing the wrong thing had paralysed him all too often… led him into letting the wrong thing happen, because he couldn’t think of the perfect way to stop it. To recognise that trying to be Captain America for everyone had only resulted in him never being Steve Rogers to anyone... And it had never worked, anyway.
“Look, Tony…” He began, softly, leaning forward slightly as he spoke. “I’ve never thought it’d be easy for you, whatever way you did things. I know that you’re gonna have to shoulder a lot in this world, whatever happens – and I
The same way he was sure that people from even the most isolated and restrictive communities probably figured sex out for themselves – because, even without anyone explaining it, people just felt and understood and
For a few minutes Tony surrendered all of his body weight into Steve, his limbs hanging loose and liquid by Steve’s ribs…
“Yeah, Monday was not a good day,” Tony conceded, with a self-conscious wince. “And I’m sorry, by the way.”
“...And that Stark intern could probably receive a grocery delivery without worrying about the FBI,” Tony just
He didn’t even know which previous enlightenment he’d let himself down over. He didn’t know whether he should be angry at himself for still trying to plan things, or angry that he’d lost sight of all his promises for the future so quickly…
“No, actually,” Tony reassured him automatically, already running calculations in his head. “In a weird way, it’s a good thing. It means the, uh… bad connection, for want of another word, is probably in the joint we updated yesterday. I think it’s gotten…
“Which is why falling in love with him in the first place was such a bad move,” Tony went on. “I mean, if I’d just
He sighed, dragging his attention back to the situation like he was trying to motivate himself through a chore. Telling himself that this was all very serious, without really believing it…
He trailed off when he heard Steve’s bitter sigh, Steve’s shoulders slumping under the weight of a revelation that he’d fully expected. The sad, disappointed laugh that slipped out under his breath was entirely genuine - and he could see that both Nat and Nick felt it. Nat especially seemed unduly put out by it, her mask slipping for a full two seconds as she struggled to place such a personal reaction from a total stranger.
“Most likely because of these,” she gestured modestly towards the neat rows of tiny terracotta pots on the stall next to them. Each one contained a single, fragile looking flower, like a buttercup - but these apparently came in a hundred shades of blue, pink, and purple… Steve’s eyes caught on one that was the exact same colour as Dr Arden’s hair and, amused by that observation, he simply reached and picked it up.
And, honestly… Partly, it was just that he liked to read them. Apparently, at some point in the last few weeks, he’d become the sort of person who liked nothing more than to curl up with an

” was swallowed up with a gasp as Tony pushed a fingertip inside him, and then a high pitched, pleading sound as Tony began to tease his rim. Tony poured more lube over his hand before pushing two fingers into him, slow and deep, watching Steve throw his head back further, balling the sheets into a fist.
thought dead, as he dropped his cup into his era-appropriate enamel sink. He most certainly did not have the energy to get into paranoia right now.
“But… I mean, only you can say how you feel about it…” Steve prompted – trying not to get his hopes up.
He would never have thought about Steve’s history, when interpreting his tone. The fact that he’d been tasked with taking down the Nazi Science Division. The fact that he was himself the product of an experiment designed to win a war. That he must think, all the time, about what the
“The place is rigged to gas intruders – it has to be someone who doesn’t have to breathe,” Tony replied.
So, with no other options to grab for, he took a steadying breath - exactly as he might’ve done before he went into battle - and stepped over the threshold into his own house.
“Maybe I could’ve just shut up, and stopped thinking about myself, and just said what you needed to hear. And you know what, I actually
“Yeah, that’s what I thought, of course you would…” Tony whispered, like he was suddenly afraid his voice would crack “But then… I hit play on that tape, and it was like you already knew what it was – and then when I asked you if you knew, you just said… yes, so, I thought… you just… knew…”
Tony loved the thought of Steve being that desperate for him – but not as much as the thought of giving him everything he wanted.
A mindless act of tidying, a subconscious instinct towards politeness or neatness, or maybe just something to do with his hands-
, he’d have just said them anyway, and maybe they’d have been right. But it was so much harder to force the words over that frantic self-doubt.
Tony really thought he was just going to step forward and kiss Steve. Seeing the world as it actually was, it seemed such an obvious thing to do – so obviously what
insensitive questions about HYDRA, even when Bucky was quite clearly getting upset. And who could forget the team at NASA, who broke into an aggressive argument amongst themselves while Bucky was still wired into a scanner. Steve would like to hope that Stark was going to be different… But, since he had literally nothing to base that on, it would have to be his job to help Bucky through this.
He could recall the vaguely condescending, sing-song tone. The jaunty little flourish as she turned off the faucet. He remembered thinking that she sounded nervous, and not knowing why.
The relief was so overwhelming that his grip slipped. And then Bucky jerked forward, and Steve snapped back into battle mode, pulling Bucky tighter against him.
, it’s just that last night was amazing, and I do want to do it again - and I just want someone else to tell me that I can. That’s the truth of it. I
“I dunno, because they used to work for Thanos?” He suggested, sounding weary “Because they’re actually Loki in disguise, because it’ll turn out later that she blames us for the death of her mother and this is all part of a plot for revenge… because they work for whoever’s running this place, because someone here is keeping an eye on us… probably would’ve made more sense… than those other suggestions…” He trailed off, defeated.
“Woah, you’re okay,” Steve murmured to himself, as he braced to take Gary’s dead weight into his chest. There was a sharp spike of adrenaline as Steve shifted fully into battle mode, swiftly pulling Gary’s unconscious body to the very back of the storage unit, and the hiding place he’d carefully prepared. He was as gentle as he could be as he tucked Gary out of sight.
A high pitched shriek from the end of the road grabbed Steve’s attention, and he looked up in time to see an excited toddler bolting around the corner, several feet ahead of his harassed mother.
He heard himself whisper Steve’s name, his breath catching in his throat when Steve’s eyes finally met his-
finalised yet - and I wouldn’t be determined to stick to this idea, if it didn’t come together,” Steve added, trying so hard not to sound like he was selling it.
He found that he had to search for the meaning of the word - and, for whatever reason, the first thing that came to mind was a half-remembered news report about Prince Phillip. Which wasn’t of much help.
He took a moment to look out over the landscape, searching for any sign of where her body had fallen… It seemed especially sad to him that her final resting place warranted no sign of it’s importance. But in the end he had no choice but to whisper his goodbye to Natasha into the air, and to suffer that bitter sadness at losing her, just for a moment, as a way to mark her passing.
But Steve wasn’t here, so Tony had no choice but to throw his arms around himself, and let this feeling wash through him.
Without much background knowledge and no frame of reference and no one to talk to about it, Steve had simply absorbed one particular meaning of these words. Ideas like
“I’m stranded on an alien planet, with Tony Stark, and I’ve been dosed with a truth serum,” Steve reminded him. “Ideally, I would like to think about sex as little as possible.”
So, he made do with berating himself for never asking about things that might’ve been useful - you know, practical, mission focused regrets…
He looked up for Tony’s permission before he examined it more closely, and Tony glanced at it, and smiled.
Tony let the warmth of that sink through his skin, almost getting carried away with the daydream of it-
A little advance warning of the unreliable narrator at the start of this chapter - Steve is still very much trying to figure himself out here, and sometimes he's a little hard on himself (Tony's view of the situation is far closer to the truth IMO :-D)
Tony glanced down again, and then back at the door. And then he turned to give Steve a long, measured appraising look, that seemed to go on forever…
Tony sucked another long, slow mouthful, pulling that pleasure up from even deeper, tugging it from the small of Steve’s back. That feeling moved hotter and thicker now, like it was caressing Steve from under his skin, curling low in his groin, pulsing deep in his muscles.
So, in a fleeting moment of very poor judgement, Tony just stepped forward and threw the door open anyway.
It was an entirely different type of blow to anything Steve had prepared for, different to anything he’d previously lived through. Coming face-to-face with a Norse God or a horde of aliens or a mad titan was one thing. Learning that magic was real and that time travel was possible, yeah, that had certainly taken some time to process.
A warmth bloomed up in Tony’s chest, swelling into his limbs. His hands moved of their own accord, naturally finding their way to Steve’s hips, his body leaning into the motion.
But Steve Rogers had made a different assessment of him, apparently. And not even the generic, fawning assessment that lifestyle magazines copy and pasted to one another on a regular basis - not
Tony felt his shoulders sag in resignation, as he noted that he had made yet another trek for no reason whatsoever. Steve was already with someone far better suited to look out for him. Steve was fine.
This reminded him of being a short kid from Brooklyn, before he and Bucky headed out on one of their ridiculous neighbourhood adventures.
Shoulders tensed, he carefully surveyed his environment, and selected his optimal starting position before he answered…
this guy looked like Steve. His hair was longer than Steve’s was the last time Tony saw him, and he had a neat, dark stubble that was almost a beard - but still, the resemblance was startling.
He’d gotten as far as being wondering what the fuel source was, and the rationale behind specific design choices - which is to say, completely distracted - when he heard Bucky clear his throat, reminding him of the question.
“Well, the first question is what do I need to know,” Tony corrected, and waved a hologram into life in the space between them.
And then Steve ran his thumb over Tony’s hole, firm and determined and just a little bit rough, and sent burning pleasure shattering through the very core of him.
“I’m not saying that,” Tony corrected, with a speed and certainty that was somewhat reassuring. “I’m just saying that… I have to know more about what we’re getting ourselves into, before…”
Something about having screwed it up and needed to cover his tracks and wanting so desperately to pursue it-
And then he felt the hot press of Tony’s tongue, flat against the bite, and an immediate rush of dizziness.

Just a reminder that there will be points in this fic where both Steve and Tony think, feel and say things they might not ordinarily think or feel - and times when things they *did* already think might be somewhat corrupted, or exaggerated...

“Firstly, the Nazis used to say all of that, too,” Steve sighed, impatiently. “Secondly - yes, that’s exactly what I always did when I was captured by Nazis. Look it up. Thirdly, that’s

And Steve might’ve liked to listen to that, but he was already too far under to drag himself back. He could only be carried along by the soft affection in Tony’s voice, letting it soak into him, as he fell deep into sleep.

“Oh! Sorry-” Steve laughed, when he realised that he’d just spilled ice cold lemonade over Tony’s stomach…
Steve exhaled slowly and rubbed a rough hand over his eyes. God, this was even harder than he thought it would be…
And then there was the giddy little dip in the pit of Tony’s stomach, as Steve dropped to lay him out on the mattress and crawled over the top of him. When he looked down at Tony it was with a feral sort of hunger, something primal, and superior, all at once.
