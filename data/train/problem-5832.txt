"They took Tony."
After Carol’s breakdown, Tony and Rhodey completed their rounds of Charles and Clint before they were faced with meeting their new patient. Carol had been whisked off to get rid of her flowers and the other two still firmly believed in their love no matter how unrequited. Charles especially refused to cave despite how his time was running out.
, how are you faring?” Natasha continued with a warmth in her voice that was only reserved for her closest people.
i didn’t think having a lab would come back to haunt me like this
“Your chart was updated five times last night. You threw up three times and had two coughing fits. Your condition is progressing quite rapidly. I’m sorry to say this Steve but you won’t be able to go home now. Constant vigilance is now vital to your health. I’ll have to speak with Doctor Rhodes to see what we can prescribe you. We definitely can’t suppress the cough but we can give you something for the pain,” Tony said while going through his routine checkup and making updates to the medical chart.
“Dirty and tired babe. Did Steve make dinner, or did we miss that?” Sam replied and fell against Natasha on her other side.
“Tony, you broke me first,” Steve murmured and got up from the couch.
Steve died with a rose on his lips one night.
“I’m saying we can’t be together. I know in the long run that I’ll probably need to make an advantageous decision when it comes to my partner and...I love you. Please don’t think that I don’t because I love you so much and if I could just run away with you then I would but I can’t Steve.”
“The Avenger has good reporting and when you’re a vigilante you end up spending a decent amount of time seeing what the press has to say on. It’s important to keep a low profile. Well as much as you can in such a busy city like New York.”
“The articles were so brutal you almost got fired for being too controversial and you write for the tech beat more than anything else.”
“Very well. We’ll make note of it and leave you alone to rest. If there’s anything you need from us, please let us know,” Rhodey said as he jotted down the time of his coughing fit after a glance at the clock on the wall. He returned the chart to its place on the footboard before nodding to their patient and exiting the room.
“I don’t think I would die for them but I don’t think I would tell them.” Stephen answered and Tony nodded while not completely understanding the thought process. It would just be so much easier to tell the other person.
You love us Stevie-kins, don’t lie sugar plum.
Go get him tiger!
“Hmm...well it’s all related to medicine. Researchers trying to find ways to create essentially human body friendly weed killers with nanotech. Something to help people get rid of the flowers without having to give up the feelings attached. But I don’t think that’s anything that’s gonna happen any time soon. Testing out the tech in itself would probably be pretty hard. Hanahaki patients are generally pretty stubborn people so they’re unlikely to want to give up their flowers and feelings in the event the experiment fails. It’s complicated.” Tony explained and the other two hummed in agreement.
you got this bro!
“Now you just sound bitter.”
Oh, I see what you’re doing you beautiful meddling super-spy.👀
You ever just think someone’s tweets are perfect? Like everything is just funny or like meaningful and good? Asking for a friend.

"So it's been a while since we've been able to go on a date. So I figured if we couldn't go out, we could have one here." Steve explained as the elevator opened up to reveal the Tower rooftop where he'd set up their picnic.
Love you too, Rogers!
makes really good coffee and the baristas are cute 👀
"Oh my god Steve...I'm out of weed. This is terrible." Tony bemoaned from his bed. The mechanical engineering major had decided that today was a bed only day. Considering how little Tony tended to sleep and spend time in his bed, Steve was uninclined to mention it. Hopefully Tony would accidentally fall asleep. Those were the best days.
“Why don’t you want me to skip class? It’s a big thing for the engineering department,” Steve asked as they waited by the counter for their coffees.
He clutched the other man closer as he heard gunshots coming from Natasha’s direction and briefly let go of Tony with one hand to reach for the shield with his right hand. He would protect Tony and keep him safe.
“It just feels like I don’t sometimes Buck. Tony knows me so well. He can anticipate what I’m going to say or how I’m going to feel. He knows the things I like and he never gets me things I don’t like. But sometimes when I give him things I somehow miss the mark. Or I end up catching myself because what I’m about to say to Tony isn’t something he’d like and I know that.”
On my break and I purposefully took it during a time when Bucky would need clean dishes and there aren’t any. Maybe I’m just feeling petty today lol.
"Hydra."
Tony’s plan was very simple: seek out crime, actual crime, the kind of stuff that would attract defenders of justice and virtue out of hiding, and then go from there. He just needed a situation where The Quartet would have no choice but to come to the people’s aid. The Captain was definitely the most justice driven of the group based on the situations he most often appeared at. The plan wouldn’t require a lot on his part and sometimes simplicity really was the best solution. The saying after all goes if it ain’t broken then why fix it.
But again, none of that information was valuable to Hydra. He didn’t know who the Captain really was, which was fucking ironic considering Tony had fallen in love with him despite that. So in love that now he was coughing up pretty forget-me-nots more and more with every passing minute. And it was certainly unrequited because the Captain had been clear that nothing could take place in his life until he finished taking care of the mission he’d been on for years now.
As soon as the front door shut behind him, the torrent of tears wouldn’t let up as Steve headed for the stairs. Steve hoped Tony was okay because it wasn’t his place to care for him anymore.

Because with every new day that blurred into the previous one with Tony being absent it became harder for Steve to forget.
The art show second semester of freshman year was a chance for the school to schmooze donors while simultaneously showcasing some of the best and the brightest of the school’s art program. From visual stuff like Steve’s work to music performed by the likes of students like violin prodigy Stephen Strange and Russian ballerina extraordinaire Natasha Romanov. They were names that the school never hesitated to throw out there and Steve had already accepted the necessary evil of having his work be used for schmoozing if it gave him an opportunity later on in life to use it for his own means. Everyone starts somewhere his Ma used to say.
i’m going back to
Tony nodded and then watched as the Widow on a sleek motorcycle seemingly appeared out of nowhere beside the Captain before he wrapped himself around her to take off after the other people in the chase.
It was cruel of fate to make Steve’s flower a rose and a rose of a medium pink hue. What Steve had done to deserve such a cruel fate when he’d never been anything but utterly sweet as far as Tony knew was one of life’s biggest mysteries. After the episode that had resulted in Tony tossing out a whole rose, he’d quickly made use of his work computer to look up the meaning.
“They’re on the move. Seems like New York is the new base of operations. Only makes sense to follow from a distance. Time for you and Bucky to go home.” Natasha murmured and Steve hummed quietly. If Yelena’s intel was right (and when was it not?), then New York was their next stop.
Steve was with the others when the phone rang. It was Tony's burner phone.
"Nah. I meant what I said. Grown and raised in the tower. I always figured I was an experiment of my parents that got out of hand. I somehow got out and now I'm causing havoc all over New York."

know better. What can I say though Steve? We both know you’re gonna do it.” The smug look on Tony’s face made Steve want to punch the engineer or kiss him. Maybe both. It was hard to tell sometimes with Tony Stark.
“It’s fine. Steve and I have practically been sharing bunks since diapers anyway.” Bucky responded and proceeded to toss his backpack onto the top bunk.
“I’m one buzz away if you need anything,” Tony assured him and was met with another smile, this one genuine and grateful, before he was out of the room.
And then everything went to shit as so often does in Steve’s life because he was apparently unable to ever catch a break. The universe hated Steve.
“Technology is the way of the future Pepper. What am I supposed to do? Ignore that I’m a futurist? That’s just not possible. Plus, honestly? Someone had to put Elon Musk in his place. He’s not a superhero.”

Day by day Steve was weakening and Tony found himself growing more desperate. He didn’t want him to disappear in a breathless flutter of flower petals. Whether he liked him as a friend or more had nothing to do with it. He’d simply become attached to the sort of person that Steve was and now it seemed impossible to think of a world without him.
What a jerk. No one needed to have their safety so blatantly disregarded like that. God but he really hated hostage situations. They were not nearly as interesting in reality as they seemed in the movies. Definitely lack luster or maybe that was just the people who had taken him hostage.
“You know? Didn’t get the best grade on it but my classmates really liked it. And who actually cares what their stuffy professors have to say on their work?”
“Yes, I am well aware of the Nazis, sorry
“I expect this kind of betrayal from Steve but not from you
“So, you mentioned pie?” Sam asks sitting up from his own cuddling with Natasha.
Very few people could simultaneously say something so well informed while sounding so disinterested. Then again Loki Laufeyson was known for his calculating nature that only ever simmered down in the presence of Thor Odinson. Tony always wondered about those two and their strange friendship/rivalry that had immediately taken root from the first time they met in the office years ago when they’d been starting out as budding reporters. Tony had for once in his life not been the most complicated person in his cohort and what a relief that had been for him.
Almost.
you’ve got it so bad bro
The thug’s friends have joined the fight but the Widow is holding her own, dodging and swiping at the enemy with quick jabs that has them leaping away from her in fear. It seems like the thugs have forgotten that they’ve got guns at their disposal since they’re trying to take the Widow down with their fists.
That however, wasn’t going to stop Steve from trying to convince Tony to maybe not buy drugs off some frankly suspicious app.
“Tony, what are you saying?” Because this conversation was never going to be a good one but now it seemed like it was going to end on a worse note than Steve had been mentally preparing himself for.
Steve was an idiot. That much was fucking clear from the way the other three couldn’t help but judge him. He knew he was but he didn’t need the constant reminder from the other three because he could dwell on it enough on his own. He knew he had fucked up and that he shouldn’t have continued to keep his secret from Tony.
Where was Tony?

Tony hadn’t even meant to get so close to the Captain and despite their late night meetings and their communications via encrypted phones, it wasnt like Tony knew anything of actual value to an organization like Hydra that was clearly hell bent on imposing its nationalistic views. Instead Tony knew that the Captain had a deep fondness for dogs and really wanted to adopt a shelter pup the moment his life allowed for it. He knew the Captain liked to draw and that his favorite way of getting around New York was on a sleek motorcycle Tony had once gotten the pleasure of riding on.
“Lets go.”
The machine sputtered and started making Tony’s coffee. Finally.

At a certain point in every patient’s life, no matter what their original decision had been, Rhodey offered them the way out through the surgery. He made the offer while there was still hope for recovery from the surgery with a high likelihood of no further complications. The fact Steve had gotten to this point made Tony rather afraid. There would be no turning back soon and Tony wasn’t sure if he was ready to face that.
“Shut up Buck.”
It almost made Steve forget about the weird limbo they’d fallen into a couple. One they couldn’t even really break out of because they never really had time to themselves to figure out what was happening. Why they were falling apart.
Before Steve got the chance to respond though a knock resounded throughout the whole suite. The blonde and brunette met eyes and Steve sighed before getting out of his desk chair with a  roll of his eyes.
“How much?” Steve responded and the kid swallowed nervously before holding out a brown paper bag.
“I can but I can’t fight them and keep you safe at the same time. Now go through the window.”
5:32 PM · Oct 4, 2020
“Please don’t tell me you’re complaining about going to New York. We’re finally going home, Stevie. Lighten up!” Bucky immediately said upon landing grey blue eyes on the newcomers. He was leaning back in his desk chair with his feet up on their table. His boots were inches from their map of Sokovia.
Steve didn’t talk to Tony about his frustrations though and they disappeared overtime but then Steve started to notice that Tony would do a lot of things without him. Steve would invite Tony to things and where once Tony would have agreed to go now he wouldn’t. He’d mention something he had to do for a class or he’d mention a Stark Industries thing that his father wanted him to help with. So Tony would be gone and Steve would find himself alone or spending more time in his old apartment with Bucky, Sam and Natasha.
He could only hope Tony held out long enough for that.
Because that’s what they were, friends, even if Tony didn’t really know anything personal about the Captain the generic pop quiz kind of way. The fact they were friends was something that Tony both loved and hated because on the one hand it made him someone special to the Captain but on the other hand he was just a friend. He wasn’t a lover, he wasn’t a partner, he was just a friend.
"Hey Cap. I'm good. No trouble for once. I just wanted to tell you that I broke the encryption on the phone but there's nothing underneath it and I don't get it."
Tony had managed to find a real life superhero, had managed to constantly himself in need of saving despite the fact he wasn’t actually that helpless, and had somehow in spite of everything had also managed to fall in love with a man that he didn’t even truly know. He knew it was stupid but by god was he really unable to stop himself from doing so. Because the things that he did know about the Captain were such good things. They were the sort of things that he wanted in a partner.

“At least I won’t ever have to worry about flowers trying to grow out of my lungs.”
“You really had to ask didn’t you?” She continued in that deadpan way of hers before leaping at the thug and quickly engaging him despite the gun he so clearly was trying to use against her. While she was occupied by the thug, the sound of others arriving behind Tony and the other hostages becomes clear.
"Oooh a surprise? What kind of surprise honey?"
“It hasn’t felt like it in a while.”
gets brought up or not. It worked. You should be happy you didn’t have to watch your friend die.” Tony replied rather bluntly and the doctor beside him sighed but Tony knew he’d seen reason.
Steve walked down the grey walled hallway and peered into empty cell after empty cell.
“Stevie is definitely the one we gotta watch out for. He may be small but he is scary.  I hope you’re a clean person Sam because otherwise, this is going to be one long fucking year,” Bucky murmured and Sam started laughing.

“Yeah yeah.”  Steve mumbled, as he approached the front door to their room. He peered at the person on the other side of the door through the door’s peephole. It was someone he didn’t recognize. He took a deep breath and opened the door.
"I'll give you that but what about this time Tony?" The cuffs made a clicking noise as they unlocked and fell to the ground. Tony immediately rubbed at his wrists while the Captain went to peer out the door of Tony's holding room before turning to the meagre window.
“What does that mean?” Steve returned and shifted in bed to look at the other.
"Anyway I’m sure you think I'm not taking this seriously enough and are resigning yourself to sending someone to watch over me. But Rhodey bear? Believe me when I say that I’ve thought about it and I think it’s gonna be alright. I have a plan.”
9:12 AM · Oct 1, 2020
“Bucky is much more manageable when his mouth is full.”
"Kick. Kick your ass. That's what I meant." Steve stuttered, blushing redder than a tomato as he backtracked. Of course his supersoldier boyfriend couldn't say that in front of the others without getting incredibly embarassed.
There wasn’t much left to say. There wasn’t much left that Steve could say without bursting into an ugly pile of tears. So he grabbed his jacket on his way out of the front door of Tony’s apartment because that’s what it was ultimately. It had been theirs for a while but it was about to be just Tony’s again.
He rose from his seat and made his way over to the espresso machine he’d brought for the office and made himself a new drink. If he was going to spend so much time here then he’d be damned if he didn’t have proper coffee. He looked at the other two men as he waited for his drink.
“Okay,” Steve nodded and turned to look back at Tony. “Okay. Just promise me that that’s the only reason for this. That there isn’t someone else--”

The man rushed him, a wickedly sharp blade clutched in one hand, and the stolen flash drive in the other. The man was fast, but obviously not used to fighting in such close combat-- his movements more panicked than practiced. The Captain brings the shield down in front of him before the man can get a quick stab in and pushes the man back with a forceful shove. His opponent stumbles back but doesn’t fall. Still this fight had gone on long enough.
, and all the other big bads that they seem to constantly be butting heads with. Still that being said, sending a soldier to do a journalist’s job? That’s just not how that works and we both know that’s the case. I have to be the one to get the information about them.”
"Hmm I guess."
“Of course.” Tony agreed despite the million things he should be doing instead of sitting by the blond’s bedside.
But the thing was that Steve wasn’t sure how Tony would take it so he kept it to himself. Probably longer than he should’ve in hindsight.
Steve took the elevator from the top floor of the tower to Tony's workshop. He could see his boyfriend busy working on the suit while humming along to his music of choice for the day: Metallica. Jarvis let Steve into the workshop while turning down the music.
He was their nurse. He was there to ease the pain until it couldn’t be endured further. He didn’t have to agree with their decisions. All he had to do was his job and provide them with their limited options until there wasn’t one left. He was entirely used to this after a few years much like Rhodey was.
Tony typing fast was never ever a good sign. Steve shifted in his desk chair to wait for Tony to explain what had him so excited. Finally after what felt like a small eternity Tony's eyes met Steve's with a big sparkly twinkle in them.
Finally!
"I don't think I can do that." Because when he thought about it and realized that would mean staying away from the Captain? Tony couldn't bring himself to do it either.
he’s perfect, steve is so handsome and nice and makes the best coffee,, look at this! i’m gonna keep him forever❤️💙
“Come on
He loved his friends, his family if he was being honest, but by god did they test him. They were obnoxious.

“Oh? And how did that go over?” Tony said, turning back to look at the painting. An amused smile graced his lips and Steve felt at peace once more that the other man wasn’t going to walk away.
"Oh it's your reporter-in-distress calling. Here." Bucky said while tossing Steve his phone. Steve caught the phone while continuing to look at the screen he'd been examining with Natasha.
"How is it?" Steve asked, a small smile and that adorable twinkle in his baby blue eyes that made Tony want to swoon.
To talk to his boyfriend about why they seemed like they weren’t really boyfriends anymore. How could they be when they hardly even spent time together.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
“Don’t worry Steve, we’ll get him back.” Sam said as he appeared in Steve’s doorway already dressed up in his suit.
"I don't think anyone would believe a) I'm not buying drugs for you, and b) that I'm buying them for myself. I'm your roommate and you're not exactly nobody. You're the Stark heir." Was Steve still gonna open the door instead of Tony? Yeah, probably, but someone had to remind Tony that his fame inevitably extended to his friends.
“I know all of that. That doesn’t change the fact that I wish it wouldn’t have to be this way, especially for Carol’s sake. Hanahaki is awful,” Rhodey said in a tone that always left Tony in an awkward place. It frustrated him that Rhodey continued to buy into that bullshit mentality that wishful thinking could actually make anything better, the media and society loved to push this idea, as ridiculous as it was, and yet it was understandable. It was relatable. Tony sometimes fell into the trap.
And that had been the start. Sometimes Steve thinks back on it and wishes he hadn’t made a point to keep Tony amused. It would’ve saved them both so much pain.
“Well as her boyfriend you probably do know things about her that I don't because you’re her boyfriend. You know there’s always stuff that people know about their partners that other friends don’t know.” Steve continued. He was definitely asking this in the awkward way possible but he had no other way of asking.
“Does a blowjob count as an act of service?” Steve asked with a smirk adorning his lips and the matching one on his boyfriend’s face was more than answer enough.
“I’m going to wait it out,” he answered before he began coughing up pink rose petals. The petals were few but still a good enough reminder of why Steve was here in this room with Tony.

After the blankets were smoothed out to Steve's satisfaction, he moved onto setting up the plate of finger foods: cut up fruit, Tony's favorite cheeses, crackers. The cheeseburgers he'd spent the past hour making were being kept warm in the grill just out of sight of the picnic. The champagne that Steve was generally too shy about drinking was chilling in a perfectly placed bucket with two crystalline flutes standing beside it. The wild flowers Steve had asked Jarvis to order were arranged artfully. Red cosmoses, yellow zinnias, white sweetpeas, blue bellflowers, pink dogwoods, orange poppies, verdant bells of Ireland.
"Who?" Sam asked Steve after the group had stood in silence.

The night of the text messages and his first set of blossoms was not Steve’s final night. While Tony had used his position to sneak in and see Steve, it hadn’t been his last night. Regardless of that he’d stayed with him like he asked and watched over him as he suffered through the night. There had been more days to spend by his side. Days where Tony had seen what seemed like countless rose petals leak from the blonde’s lips. It was a wonder how he hadn’t managed to drown in them yet. He was far too resilient to let his one-sided love kill him off so easily but even his resilience was running out.
From that moment they had become inseparable. They did everything together because Bucky had quickly learned that if left to his own devices, well Steve was likely to end up picking a fight with someone. It was just the way that Steve said things. It made other people mad. As they grew older and learned more about how shitty people could be well the more Bucky had become a solid presence in Steve’s life.
“You say that now.”

“Time to head out.”
Tony looked across the table, Jan was enthusiastically pitching a story about the upcoming Met Gala and its theme. He could tell that Fury while not necessarily interested in the topic was very impressed by the preparation that Jan had put into her pitch. It was just something that Jan Van Dyne did though and something that everyone else at The Avenger were never going to quite achieve.
Still he hadn’t expected it to actually happen because the people who were likely to try something also knew that he was close to the Captain. For a lot of people that had seemed to be deterrent enough but whoever was following him wasn’t included in that group. As he walked through a crowd of tourists on his way to work, he found himself surrounded by people and with a gun carefully hidden pressed into his back.
It’s your fault for always being too busy to hang out with us.
A few minutes later the Captain jumped out through the tiny window and Tony smiled at him. At least they were both safe now.
The next time that the Captain saved Tony wasn't even on purpose. Tony was chasing up a lead on another story he was working and just so happened to be crossing the street in the middle of a crazy motorcycle chase through the streets of Manhattan (which by the way was ridiculous because for crying out loud they're in Manhattan where there's negative road space) and had to be literally yanked out of the way by the Captain to avoid being run over.
"Then we'll burn them to the ground sooner than we originally planned." Natasha promised and Steve nodded. Now wasn't the time to lose his cool no matter how much he wanted to.
They hadn’t had a family conversation about the whole thing for nothing.
maybe?👀
Tony wasn't going to be a statistic. It was just a matter of time before he mentioned it.
They’d gotten the drop on the Hydra agents. Steve had immediately taken off for the holding cells that they’d seen on the facility map with Natasha taking up the rear. He flung the shield like a death frisbee to push agents out of the way. Knocking them unsteady before flinging them out of his way and into Natasha’s path to be knocked out. It was a steady series of movements that Natasha and Steve had executed a million times. Something that they’d worked on for hours when they’d initially started working together as mission partners.
He knew what that meant.
Love was not worth dying for.
you can say that again
“Okay I get that but also I would like to submit for the jury: we live in New York. The New York Times is right there. Good reporting is in our city's blood, Pep.”
Steve turned in his desk chair to look at his roommate with amusement. This was far from the first time this had happened. Tony liked to keep himself high. Something about passing the time in the best way possible. Steve couldn't really relate, he wasn't much of a pot guy himself, but he appreciated the thought of floating at least. That's how it worked right? Who was Steve kidding, he didn't know.
“You read my articles?”
Are you okay?
“Crystal.”
yeah and like every time you see that account tweet you die a little bit more?
“Fuck. Are you here alone spidey?” The thug that had been arguing with Tony asked with the same mocking tone he’d been directing at Tony only seconds ago. The Widow tsked before dropping down gracefully from her vantage point above them.
Rhodey sighed and Tony continued.

“It’s a good story and people will read it. Plus I want to know what they’re packing. They’ve been single handedly protecting New York way better than anyone else has in the past few months and that’s something worth trying to understand better. Don’t you want to know what makes them tick?”
“Nothing. It was a fucking bust. Total waste of time.” Bucky muttered and slinked his way over to the couch to snuggle into Natasha’s right side. She lifted her arm to draw him into her chest and pressed a soft kiss to his hair before wrinkling her nose.
So yeah, he’d spent more than late night wondering how he would die and he had never imagined that it would be like this. Dying alone, in some god forsaken decrepit condemned warehouse building, choking on the literal bunches of forget-me-nots that were growing in his lungs. The irony of his chosen flower wasn’t lost on Tony either and while he found he wanted to laugh, he couldn’t because it would hurt even more than breathing already did.
He had already been dying on the inside anyway. The flowers had just come along to serve as a reminder of that pain.
As Tony began to type a reply another text came in.
I’ve been practicing the same latte art for the last three hours and it’s not coming out right.
“Actually it’s acts of service first and foremost. I like doing things for the people I love. But also yes, I do love spoiling you with gifts. It’s what you deserve.”
Steve’s ability to fight was rapidly diminishing day by day and the cannula helping him breathe simply wasn’t enough anymore. He was in pain. The thorns tearing at his insides as the roses viciously tried to grow their way out of him entirely. It was hard to watch and after a particularly bad episode, Tony would always find himself making excuses to get out of the room. He’d find himself in the bathroom holding onto a sink for dear life as he released his own set of blossoms.
Yelena’s information was swift. She had clearly called in favors as soon as Natasha called regarding Hydra’s base in New York. They’d gotten distracted trying to clear other sources of trouble in the city and hadn’t focused on their original mission. But with Tony in danger, Steve turned all their focus on dismantling Hydra so they could find the other man. It had been days since he’d received the call and they were no closer to figuring out where he’d been.
Maybe they’ll get their coffee before noon.
"It's not like it matters what they want from me Steve. They're not going to get it. I won't give it to them." Tony explained while looking at the laptop screen where he was running some trials of a new application he'd been making.
“Got it. So you’re the one to watch out for. Got it. So you’re Steve and that’s Bucky.” Sam nodded as he saved the information for later.
“Come on Buck--”
There would be no saving Tony from this, not when he hadn’t even been able to give the Captain a call.
Steve had never really been able to take the piece seriously ever since.

It was stupid for Tony to be so in love with a man that he didn’t even really know. Frankly it was kind of embarrassing how easily it had happened and how it had come about. He didn’t know what the man looked like under his cowl and he didn’t know the man’s real name. He just knew the sound of his deep voice and that his eyes were the prettiest deep blue he had ever seen. He knew that the Captain firmly believed in protecting those who needed it and believed in justice despite the fact he was a vigilante.
“Oh sorry for asking. And what are yours? Gifts and more gifts? Because you do spoil me a lot sweetheart.” Steve teased as he  leaned down to press a kiss to Tony’s forehead. The other smiled softly at him before rolling his eyes in amusement.

Steve's hands moved to cradle Tony's face so he could look the man in his eyes. Time seemed to stop for a second as they just gazed at each other. Then Steve seemed to come back to himself, he kissed Tony's forehead gently and traced a cheekbone with his thumb before releasing Tony's face.
"Don't you mean born and raised?" The Captain teases and Tony can't help but grin.
Alright I’m gonna go talk to him. Wish me luck!
Tony tossed the horrifying vine of bloody blossoms in the trash and gasping for breath made his way to his room to lay in bed. There wheezing for breath, he looked up the meaning of wisteria on his laptop. Wisteria had always been one of his favorite flowers despite everything and once he’d gotten his job he’d stopped looking into the detailed meanings of flowers unless he absolutely had to. It had been easier and better that way.
“You will.” Natasha promised as she appeared behind Sam and Steve nodded as he grabbed his shield from its place by his bedside and made his way to the door.
“I made dinner and kept it in the oven for you two. I figured you’d be hungry when you got here.” Steve answered as he walked into the living room. He was carrying a sketchbook and his trusty pencil case.
Tony had been kidnapped before Steve had been able to get Tony alone to tell him the truth and now he had no fucking idea where the other man was.

You’ll look good no matter what.
“Plus they have pictures of all their writers at the bottom of the articles. Yours is a very good picture.”
“Yeah,” Steve answered as he recalled the memory, “I met Bucky in a playground fight.”
“Nah. Widow can handle a few thugs easily.” Comes from above as the Falcon lands on the other side of the Captain, the man turns to report. “The area is secure, took care of the stragglers. We should be good to go now.”
Steve huffed quietly to himself while he quickly suited up. Tony’s kidnapping had been broadcasted to the general public. Hydra wasn’t fucking subtle about their attempts to force Howard Stark into giving into their demands. And Steve knew that Tony’s relationship with his father wasn’t the best. He couldn't even be certain that the older Stark would actually be willing to give something up to get Tony back.

“Well, I love originals!” Tony uncrossed his arms and glanced briefly at Steve before turning his gaze back at the painting, “What’s your name handsome? I do need to know whose original painting I’ll be adding to my dorm wall.”
“Clear.”
The line moved forward and they were finally through the doors to the busy shop. Tony could make out the baristas running back and forth to fill the midmorning coffee rush that had their line perpetually out the door.
“I am relatively clean. I think we’ll be fine.”
And college was a perfect breeding ground for opportunistic assholes who just found excuses to take advantage of people. Steve hated posturing but sometimes the only way to get people to leave Tony alone was for Steve to be very blatant about the fact
“I love how competent this woman is.” Bucky muttered as he rose from his seat to help the redhead with the encryption.
“Yeah, yeah I’m good.” Tony responds and gets up from his seat to move away from the escalating fight in front of him. The other hostages follow Tony’s example and move behind the Captain and Winter Soldier quietly, clearly shaken. Tony’s attention is drawn back to the fight unfolding before them.
“You’d never do that Rogers. You love me too much.” Bucky replied with a grin as he pats Steve’s shoulder on his way to the bathroom.
“Well now that Van Dyne has put you all to shame again. Who is next? Hmm…politics? What do you have for me?”
“Thanks Steve!” God but Steve couldn’t ignore the smugness in his roommate’s voice.
Fate was entirely too cruel.
“You’re ridiculous Tony. You’re really chasing after the Quartet? To write on their equipment of all things? You know how stupid that sounds right?” Rhodey scolds over the phone and Tony shrugged as best as he could with his phone trapped between his ear and shoulder as he tried to sleepily put together a cup of coffee in his kitchen. Why Tony bothered explaining to his non-writer best friend what he wanted to write on was a mystery.
Practicing my fall art!💞🎃✨
"Ah." And it sounds like the Captain had been expecting to hear this from Tony at some point because he doesn't sound surprised, if anything he sounds amused.

"Jarvis actually got you out of bed?" Clint muttered trying to reach for the chocolate chips that Natasha was folding into what was undoubtedly waffle mix. Waffle mix that only forThor and Clint as they were the only ones on the team that were against consuming pancakes unless they absolutely had to. Natasha slapped his hand away with a glare but that didn't deter the blond archer from trying again a few seconds later.
“Now everyone here wouldn’t be in this situation if it weren't for the shorty.” The burliest of the men said while he paced back and forth in front of the hostages with a gun loosely clutched in his left hand. His friends were hanging back in the edges of the room. He stopped right in front of Tony for a second and stared him down before resuming his pacing in front of the other hostages. He seemed to be holding the gun more for the effect of scaring his hostages than for actual protection.
“That’s what it’s supposed to do though. It’s supposed to give Carol the ability to breathe easy whether s
So this guy sitting in the store tweeted about how he thinks I’m cute.?? Should I try to talk to him? He’s still here.
oh i got that last time. It was so cool
“She’s not my girlfriend Rogers.”
“Don’t use your girlfriend as evidence against me Barnes.”
And like before Tony wouldn’t really invite or expect Steve to go to the same things that he was going to. Steve had never gone to a Stark Expo and very rarely was invited to family dinners. It hadn’t bothered Steve before but now that it was becoming harder to ignore that he and Steve were not spending as much time together well it was different. Steve felt like he was alone and he couldn’t even get Tony to stay around long enough to ask about it.
“” Im sorry Henry… I was grounded until the news stopped running the story… Howard didn’t want me coming to work with him where people could see me and I could make him look worse…””
“” Ahh, a man of my own heart.”” He bit into the burger and moaned in pleasure. Tony put a coke next to him, pulling out his own to take a sip. “” I also got a cheeseburger “” He grinned. “” And french fries! Then I got two more burgers for Charlie so he can have dinner- and you can have this!”” He pulled out the $10 bill. Henry looked shocked, gingerly taking the money.
“” One day we go into George’s, we were all the greatest of friends then- oh I loved it, they never had those damn conversations without me that were ‘just for adults’ I was always included… I mean I was just as smart as them, just as up to date on history and current events.””
“” Hello Mister.”” Tony smiled up at the man on the bench, puttying the bag of food down so he could climb up and join him. The older man smiled and looked over.
“” Hmm?”” The billionaire hummed absentmindedly, hands linked with Steve’s as they walked along central park, ignoring the occasional paparazzi’s camera flash.
“” He is very nice Henry. I like dogs but I can’t have one, dad says they ruin everthing-“” He giggled as Charlie padded over, the dopy shepard thrusting his head into the boys lap to be petted. “” Hello Charlie! You are very nice!”” He squealed as the dog licked his nose before curling up at his humans feet, nosing at the greasy food bag.
“” No- I-I- I have money- I’ll take the bus- Im sorry for coming back- I um need to go-“” He whimpered shrinking away.
“” Good bye Mr Stark.””
“” Tony!”” Steve shrieked, “” You’re gonna get us hit by cars!””
“” Because ketchup is gross!”” Tony looked at him as if he should have known that already.
“” Tony!”” The old man lit up, hobbling to where Tony met him half way, hugging him tight.
A brief shout out to @unmedicated_daydreams for the kudos I received most recently. It was enough to kick me into gear and actually want to go through with this idea I've been entertaining for a while!
“” Buddy, we did it.. we had time to while you were gone… Its been almost two weeks. You don’t need to work today. You can go curl up with Charlie.”” George smiled sadly. The boy was exhausted. Too exhausted to do more then nod and move along like he was expected to at home. Charlie made a nice pillow though, and before long he was fast asleep in the corner of the little store, the sound of the radio softly playing the Beatles in the background.
“” So what did you do!””
“” You really think I am like him? “”
The five year old just rolled his eyes and walked out and over to the little burger shop next door, waiting in the short line for his turn. He was too short to see much over the counter but he wouldn’t let that stop him when it came to his turn.
Tony ran into Henry’s arms sobbing. “” He left! Henry he left without me- I don’t know how to get home- “”
“” Um… No George… I was um… Im not going to eat here today- I promise I’ll tell you about the comic later!”” He quickly added not wanting to lose his friend.
“” I’m okay… Im really sorry I ran out and worried you both-“” He sniffled. He was still getting over the sickness he got from being out in the snow all night.
“” Thank you George! Im going to sit with that man across the street!””
The woman was looking at him with wide eyes. “” Kid. Go find your parents. You don’t have the kind of money to pay for that-“”
“” What did he do?”” Steve knit his brows and rubbed Tony’s back.
“” Oh Tony, it is really really nice of you to do this! There is no need to be worried!”” He smiled down at the dog happily munching on the food, jumping a bit as a burger was thrust under his nose.
“” I have my coat-“”
In all seriousness, to everyone who has red this and given kudos, thank you for giving me 5 years of smiles when I receive an email stating you care. This is for you guys.
“” My mother would have never hit me- hell neither would my dad!””
“” He dragged me to the car, took me home and beat the shit out of me. Oh don’t give me that face Steve. You know full and well corporal punishment was very much legal.””
“” Of course you are! Now, how would you like to hear a story about how Charlie and I fought in ‘Nam?””
“” Please!””
“” Your parents weren’t Howard and Maria Stark. “” He sighed. “” I didn’t think twice about it. I did have a black eye so Henry was pissed the next day. It was always great… He called me son and we hung out all day playing silly games like trying to find the alphabet in the license plates speeding past, and one day it was freezing cold and I only had my one jacket so we went inside to George’s sat there for a while drinking hot chocolate and we always read the Captain America comics together so we scoured over the new one while Charlie the doofus pestered George- and don’t tell him I said this, but he liked it. The costumers loved the dog so there was no business scared off.”” He smiled into Steve’s arm, leaning up for a quick kiss.
raised better than that. Anyway don't change the subject, I still need to know more about this phone thing. Maybe we can meet somewhere and you can explain it to me in person?” Tony asked before he realized what he was doing.
“Now Mr. Rogers we need to go through procedure and—” Tony began only to be cut off by his new patient.
“Do you ever think about how well you know Natasha?” Steve asked Bucky one night. They were hanging out just the two of them for the first time in ages.
oh that’s bucky lol, he’s steve’s bff
Tony’s body was limp and his eyes were half open but hazy. Clearly he hadn’t been doing so well in the cell and no one had bothered to give him any medical attention. Steve looked around at the flowers again and couldn’t help but get upset at the idea of Tony being in love with someone. Because it couldn’t be Steve after all. Tony knew nothing about Steve Rogers. He only knew the Captain and that was going to haunt Steve forever. He knelt down and gently lifted Tony into his arms. The other man mumbled but settled against his chest. The reporter’s movements served as a comfort that Tony was still alive and Steve hadn’t been too late in saving him.
"So why is that?"

But back to his impending future death. He’d thought about how it would happen many times and never once had he expected it to be dramatic in this way. Had he expected gunfire? On the low? Yeah. But Hanahaki Disease along with the gunfire? No, no he had not expected that to be on the table. To be fair, he had never expected to fall in love with someone who did not love him back. Tony knew he could be charming and he’d always figured that his charm would find him a partner who was just as in love with him as he was with them.

“Oh? You guys childhood friends?” Sam asked as he pulled the chair from his desk out to take a seat.
“She totally is and also does not count as support for your argument.”
Except somehow around their friends they were still very close. When they were around the others it was like coming home. Tony would be the considerate present boyfriend and Steve would feel like before. Before he had started to notice that maybe he didn’t know Tony as well as he thought and before he had noticed that Tony didn’t really seem to want Steve around for the things that mattered to him. Instead Tony would be extra thoughtful and would pay extra attention to Steve.

“Do you want to break me while you’re at it?” Tony asked, pain and stress gripped his throat like a vise, “This hurts enough as it is Steve.”

Pepper cringed before changing the subject back to the city's newest vigilantes.
“We have Charles, Clint, Carol, and a new patient named Steve Rogers.” He responded while handing over the file of the new patient. Rhodey took it with a nod and began looking at the charts of their newest admit.  Tony had already reviewed it and found it to be as sad as all the others that had come before him.
“Well if I’m Superman, does this make you my Lois Lane?” Steve had found himself asking and the smirk on Tony’s face had been worth it.

And as the tears began to stream down Tony’s face and the sobs tore through his throat he felt it. The itch in his throat.  The itch to cough, to cough up something that shouldn’t be there. Tony coughed through his sobs and like some innocent but terrifying harbinger of coming danger there were a few wisteria blossoms resting in his palm.
When Steve and Bucky walked into their new dorm room, Steve had expected to be ignored by their third roommate in favor of Bucky. Most people assumed that Bucky was the one who called the shots in their friendship anyway, never mind that the one who was always picking fights and couldn’t keep his mouth shut was Steve, but their new roommate wasn’t like everyone else. Sam saw both Bucky and Steve. He joked with them both and it felt easy. Like they had been doing this their entire lives as opposed to only a few minutes.
“Stevie people aren’t all equally disgustingly thoughtful. It doesn’t make you a bad person. But if you feel weird about it then maybe just talk to Tony.”
It was quick but the Captain met his eyes and gave him a small smile before turning his attention back to the motorcycles that were disappearing three streets down and one right turn out of view.
Hydra didn’t need Tony for anything but to torment Steve.
And then there was a third time and fourth time and a fifth time.

As they walked towards the main room Steve scrolled through the different files. The information was carefully cultivated, well organized, and clearly a gift from Yelena from the way it had arrived with no preamble.
either.
Steve didn’t know what he had expected when he had received that initial call from Tony but it hadn’t been the eventual meetings they would have on the rooftop of his workplace. It often reminded Steve of how superheroes would always secretly meet up with their contacts like this to avoid being overheard by the villains. He’d mentioned it to Tony in passing and the other man had laughed, his warm brown eyes sparkling with mirth.
9:49 AM · Oct 1, 2020
Despite that though Tony had made his way across the room to where Steve was standing beside the paintings he had submitted for the display.
"It's so good. I'm gonna drink the whole pot and then you're gonna make more babe." Tony said and proceeded to refill his mug with the carafe he'd grabbed a few seconds ago.
And while his romance with Pepper had fallen apart, that was the only instance in which Tony could envision himself being on the verge of catching Hanahaki. No one else in his life had come close to drawing him in and keeping him so enthralled. And no one had managed to be so engaging after Pepper until now with the Captain.
They turned to smile at their clearly overwhelmed barista and ordered their drinks quickly before paying and leaving a huge tip.
“I’d definitely like something for the pain and maybe something light to stomach. I don’t think I can handle solid foods right now,” Steve murmured quietly from where he was reclining in his sheets. He was just a shade darker than the sheets he was unconsciously clutching onto and Tony knew the signs of a bad turn coming and coming fast.
“I wonder who he grew flowers for.” Tony couldn’t help but wonder aloud. Stephen just slurped his coffee while he leaned against the counter.
“I don’t have massive crushes on them. I just admire them for their bravery and good hair respectively. Anyway, this article isn’t great. The only reason I clicked on it was because it came up on my feed and my other option was the rising numbers of Hanahaki Disease fatalities, which you know? No thanks.”

Tony was tossed into a small room without preamble a few hours later. It was just three grey walls and a set of bars that no matter how much he tried he wouldn’t be able to squeeze through. His belongings had been taken and he’d been left with just the clothes on his back. The lights in the cell were dim and the air in that room seemed harder to breathe.
"You're not actually going to do that. I know for a fact you had more than enough caffeine yesterday." Steve said while setting down the wooden spatula in his hand with a quiet tap on the marble counter. The blond turned, hip against the counter to try to stare down his partner. Steve looked far too good in his blue sleep pants and tight white t-shirt but coffee? Coffee was better than sleep ruffled Steve Rogers in the mornings.

“How do you deal with that regularly?”
“I think we might need space. We aren’t working anymore. I just,” Tony took a deep breath and turned to look at Steve. Steve looked away from the tv to meet his boyfriend’s eyes. “I need to do my part. My parents worked so hard to make my life a good one despite the stereotypes of the rich and the public scrutiny that comes with the amount of wealth we have.”
"You'll see. Come on sweetheart." Steve held out his hand for the engineer, and after a second or two of putting aside his project tools, Tony slid his hand in Steve's.
"I love you too Tony."
“Tony--”
He had to find the other man. There was so much left unsaid between them. Steve peered through three other cells before finally coming across one with a person in it but it wasn’t Tony. He quickly released the woman before moving on to the next cells.
What do you mean?! Who???
“It’s how I knew your name that last time.”

Sitting next to Steve and talking to him soon became routine, just as routine as checking on his chart first thing in the morning when Tony saw him. Hearing stories about his life, his aspirations, and his hopes. Getting to know little facts about him like his favorite color being sky blue and that he loved to draw since he was young and had sketchbooks upon sketchbooks of the Avengers, especially Cap and Iron Man. Steve was the kind of man that could make Tony laugh.
“Shouldn’t one of you guys help her?” Tony asks as they continue to watch her disarm and immobilize the remaining thugs.

The thing was, from an outside perspective they were perfect. They were in love and inseparable. Their love made the world go 'round. But alone and in private? It seemed to fall apart little by little until there was nothing left. Steve didn’t understand how they’d gone from being so good together to not knowing how to be around each other because that’s what it felt like a lot of the time. Steve would look at Tony and the other would just look
Tony was constantly in awe of the man’s caffeine intake because it was a fucking miracle he hadn’t had a stroke from all the caffeine.
“Hold still.” Comes a deep pleasant voice before the ropes holding Tony’s wrists behind his back loosen enough for him to slip free. Tony turned his head and met the Captain’s eyes. They’re the clearest blue eyes he’s ever seen. It’s honestly very distracting.
“Awww Rhodey, it’s cute that you think I’m going to give up this story just because there are other people who are also trying to figure out the same thing that I’m going to be working on figuring out. Like it or not, I will be writing this story and I’m going to do whatever it takes to get it done.”
The time seemed to go by without Tony taking too much notice. He had become accustomed to keeping track based on how often Steve had an episode. Good days were two to three episodes and bad days were six to seven episodes. It was painful to watch and awfully familiar to watch someone Tony could admit to caring about get sicker by the day.
Tony learns that the Captain likes to draw. The Captain learns that Tony likes to build small things in his free time. Tony learns that the Captain is from Brooklyn when his accent slips out one day while he’s telling him a story about his childhood. The Captain learns that in another life Tony would have been an engineer but he’d gotten side tracked during college and that’s how he’d become a reporter instead. Tony learns that the Captain’s favorite color is blue and that his favorite food is shepherd’s pie and that he reads Tony’s articles.
"Ugh fine fine. Is everyone downstairs Jarvis?" Tony asked as he ran a hand through his sleep tousled hair while sliding out of bed. He grabbed a dark red robe that he'd tossed on a chair the last time he'd decided it was time for sleep and slid it on as he left his bedroom.

"What did you do to him? Where is he?"
Was he in love with Steve now? Was he dooming himself much in the same manner Steve had doomed himself months ago?
It was perfect.
When girls had decided that they wanted to look at Bucky and Steve with appraising gazes, Steve had been wary. Steve loves Bucky like a brother and could easily admit that the other boy was the sort of person who attracted attention. He was just like that. People wanted to be around Bucky, he was charismatic and handsome. It made sense. Steve on the other hand was skinny and small for his age and had inherited all the Irish paleness of his ancestors. He looked sickly often. It was hardly any wonder why Bucky was always drawing pleased gazes and why when Steve was standing right next to him he seemed to receive even more appraising gazes. As if being next to the ugly duckling somehow enhanced Bucky’s attractiveness.
the situation more: you or the situation itself.” The man mocks and Tony couldn't help but roll his eyes at the words. Really did anyone actually listen to him when he talked?
HE SAID YES
“Hey Rogers, you barely live here bro. We may as well start charging Nat the rent and not you,” Sam called from the kitchen and Steve had bitten his lip in frustration.
“It’s encrypted. You can reach out to me if you need help and I’ll come. Just don’t share the number saved on it with anyone else okay?” The Captain asks and Tony nods.
Tony could not believe it. Hanahaki Disease was horrible but it was curable. Was it humiliating and nerve wracking to seek out the solution to the illness? Yes but it was still an option. Hanahaki wasn’t cancer. It wasn’t incurable but so many people made it akin to cancer. Made it sound like there was no real escape and maybe in some ways that was true. You had to either get the feelings returned or have the flowers along with the feelings surgically removed. But you could still live to see another day, live to meet someone else who would return your feelings and live a fulfilling life. It wasn’t quite the death sentence people made it out to be.
“Oh? That’s generous of you.” Steve smirked as he crossed his arms,” I wouldn’t pay for this if I was in your shoes.”
"Are you sure? You're like some of the most high tech people in New York right now and we have Stark Industries based here. I would know. I was basically grown and raised in the tower."

“It means that you show your love, your affection, by spending time with people and reminding them how much they mean to you with your words. It’s pretty self-explanatory honey.”
After the fifth time before the Captain disappears into the shadows again after saving him from a group of trigger happy mobsters, he hands Tony a phone with a look that clearly says Tony isn’t meant to use the phone without good reason.
The others just groaned and mumbled at the display of affection and went back to what they'd been doing. Tony smiled against Steve's lips.

"I get that. I know you won't let these people get to you but shouldn't it bother you?"
“What’s been going on?” Steve asked even though he had a good feeling he knew what the other was talking about.
“Babe come on let's just eat.”
“The entrance should be just up ahead. I’ll open the doors for you.” Bucky’s voice came through over the comms and Steve hummed quietly as they reached the doors. A few seconds later the doors slide open with the hiss of pressurized doors.

“The beautiful intrepid reporter? Yeah that sounds like me.”

The reply left Tony hanging because of course to some extent it was his fault. He’d failed in keeping his patient alive and as a nurse that was his main priority. Being a Hanahaki nurse was different but first and foremost Tony was just a nurse. Someone trained in keeping people alive, not comfortable while they waited to choke on their unrequited love flowers.
"Only sometimes. You know the motorcycle thing wasn't my fault. I was just walking there."
Sophomore year came and went in a whirlwind of stolen moments and warm smiles. Junior year was ten- minute dates in between busy schedules and Steve finally getting to go to engineering events when he had the time. It was Tony parading Steve around like he was the real prize and not the engineering genius put to life in different robots and AI. It was two years of Steve and Tony becoming so used to being around each other and living with each other in almost every sense of the word.

The only problem with Tony’s ingenious simple plan was that it had worked. It had worked too well if he was being completely honest with himself. You know given that he was currently tied to a chair along with a few other hostages in what was obviously a drug deal gone incredibly awry. Who knew the local knitting shop was a drug front? That had honestly been a happy accident sort of discovery on Tony’s part.

For some reason his coffee machine was not doing what he wanted it to do. Maybe he’d spend his Saturday taking it apart and putting it back together to work better. Sometimes Tony regretted switching from mechanical engineering to journalism. Howard would’ve been much more willing to give Tony access to the labs of R&D if Tony had graduated as an engineer.
“Are you telling me or asking me?”
"I'm going to eat your ass, I swear." Steve threatened while trying to grab the coffee from Tony. No doubt concerned that their resident genius was going to be over caffeinated before the day had really begun.
It worried Steve because he didn’t want to be the sort of boyfriend who didn’t know anything about his partner.
And that was the first time the Captain saved Tony.
Sometimes Steve wondered what he had done to earn the love of someone like Tony because the other man was just so
i don’t have friends anymore. three slots just opened up, send in your applications
And it kept the flower petals at bay when he got to see the Captain more often as if his body thought that his continued presence in Tony's life was an indirect way of him accepting Tony's affections. It was a bandage on a knife wound but he'd take it.
They’re waiting in a ridiculous Starbucks line that’s more on the street than in the store. Still every other coffee shop in the area was too overpriced for the quality of their coffee. So somehow they’d ended up in the local Starbucks.
Yet somehow you boys thought moving to a bigger apartment to accommodate Tony’s dream of a “lab” was a good idea...
"Hey J. Why'd you turn the music down?" Tony asked without looking up from what he was doing. Steve watched as Tony finished securing a wire before answering for Jarvis.
And later when they were out of this situation and safe again, he would tell Tony the whole truth and hope the other man wouldn’t hate him for lying to him for so long.

Sometimes Tony skipped a class to go with Steve on a march or Steve was invited to an art thing and the engineering major would set aside time in his busy schedule to go with Steve. They were sacrifices that Steve was both aware of and very appreciative of. Ones that Tony never wanted Steve to make for him in return. The one time they’d talked about it had been enough to stop Steve from insisting on it ever again.
“I’ve been thinking that maybe we need to talk about what’s been going on,” Tony whispered while they sat on the couch watching some ridiculous athletics competition. It was mindless but they both thought it was amusing so they’d made it a nightly ritual.
